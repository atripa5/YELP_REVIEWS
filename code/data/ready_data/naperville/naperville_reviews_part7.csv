Time of my visit: Lunch

Let me start by saying, this was not my first time here...  I remembered why it took me this long to come back...  It might be awhile before I come back again...

I always liked little moms &amp; pops type places.  My first test is always to try the gyro.  I ordered gyro, fries and a drink.  Total came under $8 with tax, I thought that was reasonable.  My first reaction was to reach for my AMEX, oops they didn&#39;t take it.  That was a strike one!  Look, I get it, it&#39;s expensive to take that card, but either take them all or be a cash only.  They were busy, so it took them a few minutes to get to me.  I asked my order to be for here and instead I get it to go, at least they apologized.  Normally, it would not be a big deal, but I have yet to get my order correctly at this place (usually I get no onions on my gyro, since I have to go back to work, so either screw no onions up or something like for here or to go).

On to the food, the fries were average and nothing special.  Gyro meat was a bit dry and average.  I have had better gyros.

Honestly, I am not sure when I&#39;ll come back again, but I will try something else and some point, I just need to remember not to reach for my AMEX.  Overall C-."

It&#39;s a little hole in the wall, with a small dining area. I&#39;ve been going here for about 10 years. It&#39;s family owned, and the staff is very friendly. 

They offer just about everything you would expect from a good hot dog joint, and I&#39;ve never had anything bad off their menu. 

Their steak sandwich is killer, the burgers are good, they also have really, really good gyros. They also offer tacos, burritos, and that have menudo on the weekends. 

The prices are great too. Another reason I keep going back. Not like Scooby&#39;s down the road, who have a two hot dog special for $9.99....."

Not sure why he wrapped up everything in a bag to-go, I was dining in. Tried to unfold the mess that was the dog. Onion rings are generic and he tried to charge me a $1 for a cup of water. I paid $7.81 for a very disappointing meal. I think they may appeal to a different style customer. At least I can remove them from my bookmarks. No warm fuzzy feeling from the staff."

I got a cheeseburger and fries with a horchata. Because I could. It set me back $6.72, which is nothing short of amazing if you keep track of beef prices like I do.

The burger was pretty good. It&#39;s hard for me to describe a run-of-the-mill, hole-in-the-wall burger without using more hyphens, so I&#39;ll just say that it was a good burger. Fresh lettuce and nice, melty cheese.

The fries tasted slightly off. I can&#39;t tell you how, because my wife didn&#39;t think they tasted off, but to me I thought maybe some of the flavors from other fried foods leaked into the oil.

The horchata was very, very good, cold, cinnamon-y and exactly what I was looking for.

Overall though, it&#39;s pretty difficult to beat Diana&#39;s - which, by the way, appears to be run by a Hispanic dude, and I wasn&#39;t sure if red hots were actually on the menu - at this price point. I&#39;d come back."

This place has a really weird menu but I am seeing more of this. They have Mexican, American and a little Greek selection. I have tried a few and am a fan.

The service is super friendly. The food is always perfect. Everything is cooked to order so there is no cold food or old food!

The hot dogs are their specialty. Typical Vienna dog but they do it all so well. It comes with fries at no extra charge. I have had their gyros, tamales and as I mentioned hot dogs. All were good and I trust that everything else in there menu, which is huge by the way, is going to be just as good.

Looking forward to my next visit."

When you walk in you&#39;ll notice that it&#39;s very hot inside as the cooking equipment is very closely packed into the front. When I went to Diana&#39;s I ordered the hot dog.

The hot dog comes with fries and is a skinless vienna beef dog. The bun was a regular non-poppy seed bun. The pickle was cut thinly but was not quite long enough to get pickle in every bite. It was light on mustard and relish but had a decent amount of onions. The relish included was not the neon green style found at most Chicago style hot dog joints, but wasn&#39;t too sour either. The peppers included weren&#39;t too hot and complimented the dog nicely. The bun wasn&#39;t particularly soft, but it wasn&#39;t hard either.

The fries included were thick, they were fairly cripsy on the outside and had a decent potato filling. They weren&#39;t too salty, but were a bit on the greasy side. 

Overall this was an average at best Chicago style hot dog. The light condiments, regular bun and so so fries included keep it from reaching the three star plateau. Not awful, but I&#39;ve definitely had better."

This place is a dive in and out joint, its small not too cozy but packs a punch in food and flavor. Their gyros are awesome, it is a very generous portion of meat, tomato, onion and &#34;gyro sauce&#34; as they like to refer to it, and if you order the plate (comes with fries and a drink) you&#39;ll definitely be walking away full (make sure to grab some Louisiana hot sauce for them fries mm mm). 

Their hot dogs and cheese steak sandwiches I would recommend next, the hot dogs are classic nothing extraordinary but their sandwiches are, I definitely recommend a try. Finally, their menudo on Saturday and Sunday is extremely tasty. Although sometimes they sell out quickly due to phone in orders, I got their today at 10:09 am (they open at 10 am) and they were already sold out, yeah its that good. 

Anyways, the location and setting can be a little off putting but the food and service is excellent I highly recommend this place if you like good food at a decent price. 

Oh yeah and they also serve good burritos and tacos. Check em out."

Went recently with love of my life and his aunt. 

They have a nice little $20 all-you-can-eat sushi and appetizers. Only catch is you gotta finish what you order or they charge you for it.  The sushi was quite good, and the appetizers were to die for! 

I thought the service could have been better, seemed like they were rushing us the whole time which bugged me, a lot.

This is my local haunt for a reason: they have the best all-you-can-eat sushi around. Just the best. My favorite rolls are Jo-Jo, Torch Dragon, and Sapporo. Be aware that they do  charge you for uneaten rolls, which is logical bc wasting food is bad, so just don&#39;t be a turd and it won&#39;t be too expensive. The Shumai and Gyoza usually come fried, but you can ask for them to be steamed instead. I prefer this for taste reasons but also because it makes me feel like I&#39;m being healthy while stuffing my face. Efficiency! Irony! Success! If you are getting the takoyaki(sp?) or the fried scallop, just know that they are hotter than the fiery depths of hell and will hurt you if given the opportunity. As far as the individual pieces of sushi go, I&#39;m a fan of the salmon, tuna, and eel.

They usually have pretty good service. I&#39;ve been there tens of times and they&#39;ve never made any mistakes with orders or anything. That being said, it takes time for them to make sushi so gauge your hunger earlier on and order based on that.

If you&#39;re able to walk comfortably after you&#39;re done eating here, do better next time :D"

While most AYCE seem like they throw you either day old fish or a version of the California roll with 10 different toppings, Sushi City does not play you like that. 

You pay about $20 and everything is up for grabs. Drinks are extra but even the apps are included in the price. If you&#39;re all about the grub, you&#39;d keep your liquid consumption to a minimum and save that precious stomach space on bomb sushi rolls instead. 

Between 6 people, we probably ordered every damn specialty roll on the menu, at least 3xs. Being fat is fun. 

Keep in mind everyone is ordering a ton of food like you, so when you place your order, it&#39;s gonna take a while. The quality of sushi is actually bomb as are the freshness of the fish so it&#39;s all worth it. 

When you decide you want a second or third order, just try to combine them all and stuff yourself because you can&#39;t leave food unless you wanna pay extra. You won&#39;t leave anything because it&#39;s all so damn good.

Prepare yourself with some leggings/jeggings and enjoy.

We came here for dinner with a big group (17 people) and they did pretty well.  The food came out on the slow side, but I got my food and had a happy belly by the end of the night.  There was no issue paying separately, either.  We just one by one paid at the cashier up front before we left.

I was looking for the Torched Dragon maki on the AYCE menu but didn&#39;t see it.  Just now realized it&#39;s not on that particular menu, but you can still order it as part of AYCE because it&#39;s on the house special menu.  

My one qualm about the rolls, especially the Godzilla roll, is that it&#39;s way too big!  What if I&#39;m eating with a smaller group of people, how will I get a variety of rolls if the Godzilla roll is so enormous that I can&#39;t even eat 1/3 of it by myself.

The kids instantly agreed, but the wife was hesitant when I mentioned it&#39;s an &#34;all you can eat&#34; place, since she&#39;s on a diet. But I talked her in and everybody was super hungry so might as well go on a pig-out.

The place is situated in a strip mall where toys r us, shikara, and Royal Buffet in 75th is located. Don&#39;t let the facade fool you since it&#39;s a little small from the outside but there&#39;s ample seating and a bar area where the Itamae (Sushi chef) does all the magic. I&#39;m more of a nigiri and sashimi guy so this place was perfect for me, but there&#39;s plenty to choose from including specialty rolls and makis. Me and my wife went for the eat all you can 20$ each and kids shared the teriyaki plate for 11$.

So our journey started with miso soup, takoyaki (one of my fave Japanese street foods), chicken yaki (bbq on stick), ika salad (squid w/pickles), few standard rolls, and a specialty roll. What stood out was the Torched Dragon which is now my favorite like everybody elses. The other dishes came out as expected and fresh, not the ones you eat at buffets where the sushi rice was stale and ingredients have dried out.

2nd round we asked for a mango roll with potato crunch on top, salmon roll, various nigiri (eel, tuna, salmon, mackarel). The problem with this batch is that there&#39;s a strand of hair stuck on one of the rolls. So we told the guy. He was very apologetic and hurried up took the plate, told the Itamae about it and they gave us a new batch. The server handled the situation very well IMHO, but at the back of my head, I wanted to check every piece of sushi. My other problem is the mackarel nigiri is not prepared consistently. I got one piece with just chewy fish skin, then another thick piece too big for one bite, and few others were the fish is not glued together with the wasabi.  But if you ask me if I will go back here again, I&#39;d definitely will, just because of great service and now that I know what to order or what to stay away from the menu. Overall it&#39;s a really good experience and for the price point. Btw, they charge 1$+ for left over sushi so you would want to order only what you can finish, another rookie mistake I made."

They have great tasting rolls and a great all-you-can-eat sushi and appetizer spread. The only reason that they don&#39;t have 5 stars is that it&#39;s sloooooooooow. The price of 20.99 is more than reasonable for the sushi buffet. You get to choose from a slew of appetizers as well. 

What sets this sushi buffet apart from others is the sheer amount of specialty rolls included. I have never been to a sushi buffet with a list of 10+ specialty rolls you can order from. I think this is what truly slows them down. There is no limit to how much you can order per sheet-most places limit you to two specialty rolls at a time. 

This place wants you to go all out at all times. And people do. This means the kitchen is inundated with 50 blue sheets at a time with a bagillion rolls listed on each sheet. The sushi chefs work their butts off, and the rolls always come to you prepared nicely, but it&#39;s gonna take quite a while for those rolls to get to you. As far as specialty rolls go, I recommend the Torched Dragon. 

Definitely check out Sushi City, but only if you&#39;re prepared to be there for a good chunk of time. The food is quite tasty, though."

Those are no doubt some of the best places for sushi in the country, but sometimes I just like pounding back mystery nigiri until I pass out into a food coma.
I would be the first to admit that I come here way too often. The sushi is probably only 7/10, but the value for the all-you-can-eat is incredible. The only better deal in the area is Lawrence Fish Market in Albany Park, and they are takeout only. It&#39;s just a place to have fun and fill up after a day of go-karting and paintball. 
Like I said, nothing is mind-blowing, but I would definitely recommend Sushi City for carb-loading, preparty dinners, post shopping relaxing, and just meeting up with friends."

1) service is decent 
2) sushi- not the worst but I could have something better. (We were disappointed &amp; we love sushi) 
3) the seating was not great. On a winter day, how could you seat someone by the window..? Cold air. But they were kind enough to change our table to an inner table when we asked. 
4) finished eating, paid. While driving home we both didn&#39;t feel so well. Our stomach started to hurt. 

We don&#39;t think the fish was fresh. This problem never happened when we go out for sushi.

We usually go on Sunday afternoons when it seems less busy. I was thoroughly impressed that despite the crowds, service was great (even though we were missing soy sauce and soy sauce dishes, we got those after we asked) our orders came correctly, AND we each received our respective orders at once on our own plates. (They&#39;ve been coming out as made/piecemeal lately otherwise.) 

They&#39;re good on refills, everything is clean, and service in general is usually good. The rice can be rather plain IMO (vs. true sushi rice). A few girls recognize our mugs by now.

The only problem we seem to consistently have is that they don&#39;t include wasabi + pickled ginger, so we always have to ask for some. They give us a generous amount though. I ordered 4 rolls and a few pieces of nigiri and it was the perfect amount - I was pretty full but it was manageable. 

                                  - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Fast forward to last night (Sunday, 2 days later): my boyfriend and had the AYCE. The server said, &#34;Besides water, do you want anything else to drink?&#34; I asked for a hot tea. She brought 1 water and my tea, so we had to ask for my water (..which I thought was coming anyway based on her wording, but whatevs; we got it).

We had to ask for wasabi and ginger. Again.

We each ordered 4 rolls and a few pieces of nigiri, which we agreed was the perfect amount. However, it seemed we got way more - so either we over ordered or somehow ended up with someone else&#39;s. Anyway, we were STUFFED and raised the white flag. 

The server came over and asked how we were doing. We said fine, but couldn&#39;t eat any more. I asked her to tell us what we&#39;d owe for the rest. She then began to question us about why we ordered so much.

Wait...what? I thought I heard her wrong at first.

&#34;Why did you order so much?&#34;

&#34;..Uh.. we were hungry and thought we ordered enough..&#34;

...I was thinking, Are you scolding us? Orrrrr do you think we planned to have excess? Because that&#39;s what it felt like. Very uncomfortable.

She just kind of looked at us, then counted up the pieces and gave us a price  ($15), told us &#34;I&#39;m supposed to charge you 50 cents per piece.&#34; That was fine, but it was just all kinds of awkward. I mean, I understand they charge you for what isn&#39;t eaten. But that&#39;s MY problem, right? $55 of sushi pre-tax ($61 post-) and second-day sushi that never ever tastes half as good.

So, yeah, total 3 star experience last night.  Still, I hope it was just a fluke with this one girl.

I don&#39;t know..maybe Friday night is the best time to go. I&#39;ll be sure to stick to 3 rolls in the future (and order more if needed/wanted) to avoid being scolded otherwise."

This place is alright for AYCE (not amazing but worth it for the price they charge). Sushi City used to turned me off because of the noticeable amount of rice they put on the sushi -- seriously, they put A LOT of rice (even for what you would expect from AYCE). I used to dismiss this place as among the worst AYCE sushi restaurants in Illinois, but I gave it another shot yesterday on my 18th birthday and was pleasantly surprised.

The nigiri here are PACKED with rice, BUT the fish is surprisingly not bad. I&#39;m very impressed that this place actually has white tuna (yes, by white tuna I mean albacore tuna, NOT escolar) and sea bass. I&#39;m also gonna say that the fish quality here is MUCH better than the quality from Para Sushi &amp; Ramen that is located slightly east of here on 75th. Most of the rolls here are what you would expect from an AYCE place, but some of them here are red flags in terms of the amount of fillers they purposely use to fill you up.

So let me caution every sushi lover here. Acknowledge that everything is packed with a little extra rice compared to what you would normally expect from other places, but some items aren&#39;t as bad as others in terms of filler (some of the sushi here is actually tasty despite the generous rice portions). To any serious sushi lover, I would recommend to stay away from the Godzilla roll and any roll that seems to have too much filler or is deep fried; stick with some nigiri (if you can stand the amount of rice they put) and some of the house special rolls.

And this gets me to what I really wanted to say: the house special rolls IMO are the only reason for me to come here, specifically the Torched Dragon Roll. Not all the house special rolls are great (some of them are just bad in terms of sushi fillers), but the Torched Dragon Roll is really something special here. It&#39;s a roll with shrimp tempura and imitation crab inside with fresh fish on the outside drizzled with spicy mayo, eel sauce, and lemon wasabi sauce and torched under a flame to give it a nice grilled taste. No wonder it&#39;s the most popular roll here; I would come here just to get the opportunity eat the Torched Dragon! The Jo-Jo and Turtle Roll here are alright as well IMO; I&#39;d advise serious sushi goers to avoid the Downers Grove Toll (too much filler).

All in all, you gotta be careful eating her to get your money&#39;s worth of sushi."

The rice to fish ratio is way off here. Obviously they want to control their overhead...I get it, but I&#39;m not liking it. The portion of food is dramatically different from roll to roll. One kind may be huge, the next roll is a baby-sized portion. If you have leftovers, you get charged extra. I came in more than 30 minutes before closing and was told I had to order all my rolls in one go.

We had our food within 10 minutes here and the server was very attentive.  I don&#39;t think my water glass ever got less than half full.  The amount of fish in each roll was great compared to other places where they overstuff all the rolls with rice to fill you up.

They had open tables and weren&#39;t all that busy when I went in, after the promised half hour when I placed the order for an appetizer plate, sashimi dinner, and some sides. They promptly took my payment of almost $50, then made me wait another half hour while they then scrambled to start and put my order together.

I waited in the waiting area, mouth watering as I watched other platters make their way to the few occupied tables during the half hour I was forced to wait. Some of those tables that got served were people who arrived and were seated after I had gotten there and paid.

What separates them from the other ACYE sushi places in the suburbs are their ACYE special sushi rolls, like the Torched Dragon - flamethrower-ed to perfection - and the Turtle Maki. I also really like their Godzilla roll, Spider roll, and Nigiri pieces. While my check-ins don&#39;t show it, I have probably been here about 10 to 15 times in my life. Sometimes the service can be slow, and on Fridays and Saturdays, it can get pretty packed. But time and time again, we come back hungry and leave stuffed. As you can see form other reviews, price is like $20 for AYCE dinner. The wasabi is good, ginger is plentiful, and sushi taste great. But yes, service can be slow sometimes, but I think it&#39;s worth the wait.

 My favorite rolls were Torched Dragon, &amp; the Godzilla. Had the sweet potato it was interesting! Ask 4 wasabi &amp; ginger between samples. I had plenty of green tea to wash  down between rolls.

I came to city sushi, I heard they were known in the area for great food. I do have to say, the sushi was excellent. Very tasty, well prepared, and visually appealing. The service however was terrible. When we arrived, we were only given 3 menus to order from when we had a party of 5. Our waiter was extremely rude. He always seemed to be giving us dirty looks. Never came by and asked how things were. He didn&#39;t really do anything for us at all. The one thing that bothered me the most... It took extremely long for our food to arrive at our table. One roll of sushi would take around 30 min or possibly more. I think that I will be visiting sushi city again only because the sushi was great. I just hope that the service gets better. Otherwise I may not be back for a third visit.


UPDATE: since the last review I made, I have been to sushi city twice more. I have to say, I got a terrible first impression. Their all you can eat menu for $20.99 is quite amazing... An array of appetizers, a plentiful amount of different rolls. And not to mention the house specials are included in the AYCE menu also. I suggest coming here on a weekday when its not too busy.

We weren&#39;t sure if we were supposed to be sampling them.  We were sitting at the bar,  they put so many out it looked like they were setting up a buffet. Upon asking the manager he informed us that they were indeed for us.  We weren&#39;t too familiar with Japanese culture and were concerned they would be offended that we didn&#39;t eat all the sushi they gave us to sample.  We gave it all we got.  At one point there was a lot of chatter and attention from other patrons directed at us.  We felt a bit uneasy,  thinking this might be some kind of prank on a Japanese game show.  After three hours the check came.  There was a base charge of 20.99 for each of us and additional charge of $272 for all the uneaten sushi. We were quite taken aback that they were charging us for uneaten sushi we didn&#39;t even order.

Nice that there was constantly someone at our table, but annoying that there was zero communication between the servers as to who was taking the lead. However, once we told them we were trying to catch a movie, they hustled our food out and we made it in plenty of time.

Try: Downers Grove (our favorite), Torched Dragon, Sweet potato, any of the individual sushi pieces

Don&#39;t waste room in your belly with: Philly roll, Rainbow (bland and lacked the proper layering of fish over the roll), any of the appetizers (especially the fried &#34;scallops,&#34; which we dissected and discovered to be flavored, compressed white fish. Gross).

IMPORTANT NOTE, the servers all emphasized that while its policy to charge for leftover sushi, if you leave only 3-4 pieces, they won&#39;t charge and will actually give you a to-go box for them. I appreciate that, as that last forced bite of sushi can have tragic consequences afterward"

Went here for the first time with my bff on a Wednesday night around 4pm. Place was about 1/3 full, which I Love. (Can&#39;t wait til I&#39;m over 60 and can actually capitalize on that early bird dinner mess) 

First off, the service was beyond impressive. The servers at most to all AYCE sushi restaurants I&#39;ve been to have been unfriendly and seem to always rush you out in order to fill your seats. Not Sushi City. Our waitress was very patient, our waters were always full, and she even asked us if we were hungry for more on multiple occasions. Whaaa?! It was hard to understand her through her accent and mumbling, but who cares when she&#39;s not sweeping under our feet and rushing us out?! 

Second, the speed. Our apps, nigiri and rolls seemed to come out in perfect timing. Everything was temperature appropriate and spaced out just right. Glad we came before the dinner rush! 

And lastly, the SUSHI. I swear they had a barge come in with our names on it just before we arrived. Fish was fresh, generously cut, and the sauces were impeccable. For $19.99 a person, you can not only order off the AYCE dinner menu, but the huge list of specialty rolls were also included in the price! At an average of $12 per roll, you CANT beat this awesome deal! Highlights were the Torched Dragon roll, New York roll, and the Mexican roll. Portions were MASSIVE. I almost wish I had other friends so we could&#39;ve tried more. Truth be told, I&#39;m a bit selfish when it comes to my sushi so larger portions actually work out perfect. #gluttonousamerican

I WILL be back. Even if I have to go alone. Free parking, great service, excellent sushi, crazy good prices, I think I&#39;ve found my new fish feeding frenzy!! 
Ps, can I just comment on the clean, multi stalled restrooms...? Now there&#39;s something you rarely see in an authentic sushi restaurant!!"

As others have mentioned, service is a bit weird. They seem to have plenty of staff but they are a bit slow, and seem not organized. They have a lot of offerings on the menu, but the torched dragon seemed to be the best. Other rolls I ordered, such as the Godzilla roll, had way too much cucumber and rice(to get you full I assume).

Great place with a variety of sushi! I really don&#39;t eat sushi, as I&#39;m not the biggest fan of the stuff, but this place was delicious. All of the rolls are made to order, the fish is fresh, and you can eat as much as you want of it! My favorite roll was the Turtle Roll and crab Rangoon. I will not disclose how many orders I had, but lets just say I could clear house. 
The place was dead, but we did go on a Wednesday evening for my sisters birthday. I hope that it gets packed on the weekends because I would hate to see this place drown. The staff is super nice and informative on the menu and what exactly it is. 
There is a catch though, you do have to eat everything you order. Anything left over they will charge you per piece (it&#39;s not too much though) so make sure your eyes aren&#39;t bigger than your stomach."

But for an all you can eat sushi place in the Chicago area it isn&#39;t bad. The service is what really shines here. My glass was always filled with water and whenever our table needed anything they seemed to be able to read out minds and know when to service the table. I do have some complaints which is why they don&#39;t get 5 stars. The eel tasted fine But was &#39;stale&#39;. That&#39;s all I will say about that. Each piece of sushi had a little more rice than I would have liked. Really packed in with an average size of fish on top. The fish didn&#39;t taste super fresh. Fresh enough but I&#39;m being picky here and comparing the fish to upscale sushi joints. The fried scallops use fake scallops just be advised. But I could have sworn the first one I ate was a real scallop. Who knows maybe they mix and match.

In the end the food was ok. Nothing spectacular, but not bad. The service was amazing and the people there very kind. Nice place for lunch!"

This is by far the worst.  We tried it because it was close to us and the reviews were good.  We went on a weekend lunch and it wasn&#39;t too busy.  Perhaps we had come before the rush?  The rolls have too much rice, which I understand, this is a business and they are trying to fill you up but the amount of cucumber that was in each roll was ridiculous.  I usually prefer a different all you can eat restaurant and will be driving at least 40 minutes next time for better food.  None of the rolls really stood out or were that great.  Basics again were just overstuffed with cucumber and rice in comparison to the amount of actual fish.  The decor is very nice and the place is bigger than it looks from the outside.  Location has ample parking in a large shopping plaza.  Service was good, and the ingredients were fresh and well-prepared.  I have no qualms about quality but overall, I was turned off by the fact that I accidentally ordered a roll with nothing but rice and fruit... no meat and had it be half of my meal because it filled me up too much.  Hehe my fault for not looking at the ingredients closer but so sad I couldn&#39;t try something more yummy.  In all we ate about a good 6 rolls or so.  Some were more yummy than others which I forget the names.  

Price was similar but very disappointing.  I had high high hopes for this place.  Will most likely not be going back."

My most recent visit had me stretch my sushi eating abilities and venture into uncharted waters by trying a Turtle Maki, New York Maki, Highway Maki and a Blue Sky Maki rolls and then following up with a Dragon and Torched Dragon rolls. All of these rolls were delicious and prepared perfectly.

My only criticism is that the customer service lacks on occasion by the wait staff and orders seem to occasionally get lost and disappear in thin air. This makes it difficult especially when you are with a large group and those around you have been served and are eating while you are waiting....and waiting...and waiting."

We all got the unlimited sushi. With their dinner price, you get the speciality rolls along with any appetizers or causal rolls. It was a long wait for our first set of rolls, but considering it was a Friday night, they came out pretty quick! 

I was not displeased with any of the food brought to the table. We as a table tried almost every speciality roll and loved everything. 

They had the absolute BEST crab rangoon!! My favorite roll was the Snow Mountain which was a coconut flavored sushi roll. It was so full of flavor that I just had to get two of the rolls! The other table favorite was the Scorched Dragon! This was a shrimp tempura with a spicy mayo. 

The presentation of the food was also beyond impressive. They were flawless with it and I almost didn&#39;t wanted to eat the rolls. The service was great. They constantly were filling out water and making sure we had everything we needed.

Para (Palatine) in the Downer&#39;s Grove area for a while now and I&#39;ve finally found it!

Similar to other all you can eat sushi places, the service isn&#39;t great. The servers are nice enough but the interaction mainly consists of just setting down your food and walking away rather than engaging. They are really good about checking in with you to make sure you have enough to drink.

We ordered Crab Rangoon to start (1 order includes 2 pieces) which are included in the all you can eat deal ($19.99!) They were delicious!

The sushi was amazing - it was all very fresh and I liked that their portions were very reasonable. 

With the all you can eat deal you can choose up to 10 specialty rolls. We decided on the Turtle Maki and a Dragon Roll. Both were very good but I would recommend the Turtle!

Overall I feel like Sushi City met my expectations. Considering the service 4 stars may be a little bit generous, but the sushi was THAT good! We will definitely be coming back!"

The service and the cleanliness was good. The waitstaff was very attentive, and kept the refills on my water coming. The sushi, however was another story. I now see why they serve an all-you-here...becasue 90% of the sushi is rice! I even took a picture of their Boston roll.

The service here was horrible. We came in and it wasn&#39;t busy, yet they told us we couldn&#39;t have a booth. (There were 3 available in the back) we asked about those and they said they weren&#39;t seating anyone there. So they seated us at the table right at the front by the cash register and sushi bar. Throughout our time there they sat people in all 3 booths. One opened up and we asked if we could move there. She said no because we already ordered and we have to before we order. We said there isn&#39;t many people here, can&#39;t you just bring our food there or can we move once our food comes to the table? She wouldn&#39;t let us. 

When ordering, she kept reminding me that I couldn&#39;t eat off their buffet because I chose not to do the buffet because I wasn&#39;t that hungry....which is annoying to assume that I would. This also made me think this is why they wouldn&#39;t let us sit in the booths in the back. 

The food was just okay. They messed up our order a few times and she would bring and say &#34;___ doesn&#39;t have this or that, can you guys just share it?&#34; instead of taking it back and fixing it, she would try to have the other girl doing the buffet eat it.

On my dude-date with Andres D, last week, we did just that thanks to Sushi City&#39;s all you can eat for $20 policy. Was it the best or freshest sushi? No. Not even close, but it was decent and a few rolls were downright outstanding and and totally made it worth the trip and set me up for what I know will be repeat visits... hopefully also with Andres D, because as far as appetite goes, we&#39;re a good ass match.

Also worth noting is that the $20 AYCE sushi doesn&#39;t just go for the sushi, it&#39;s the whole menu. Any roll, maki, nigiri, sashimi, etc +  edamame and rangoon and all apps count towards A total steal, but that&#39;s not even the best part- you can get all the miso soup your little heart desires... and my little heart desires a sh*t ton. 

When doing Sushi City, you MUST get the Torch Dragon Roll. It&#39;s hands down, world&#39;s above the rest. One of the better sushi rolls I&#39;ve had in my nominal time as a sushi connoisseur. The char flavor had me going back or bite until my gut just about burst.

Another notable, the Blue Sky made with blueberry mayo. Flavor was good, not great, but the presentation was what killed it... in a good way (like phat, not fat). Defo check out those pics. 

I feel like seeing is believing, so just check out the snaps of The Great Andres &amp; Candice Eat-a-thon of 2012 and let your gubber guide you to greatness... and by greatness I do mean quantity, which sometimes, the stomach prefers over quality. And anyone else who&#39;s ever gone to a fancy seafood restaurant and paid several hundred dollars for food that was exquisite, but left you hankering for a cheesy beef from Portillo&#39;s after knows what I&#39;m talking about.

It is located in a big shopping plaza, so there are tons of parking. You usually don&#39;t have to make reservations or wait when coming here, which is a plus. However, the last time I came, which was this past Saturday around 7pm, the place was packed, but we were seated right away. I don&#39;t know if it is just this time, but we usually come during weekday and weekend at this time and it has never been this packed. Maybe everyone is beginning to find this place good!

The sushi selection on their buffet is decent size. The selection isn&#39;t as big as House of Sushi, but the quality is a little better. The appetizers here are really really good. We normally get tons of sui mai, gyoza, ika salad, seaweed salad, and sesame balls. For the rolls, the Torched Dragon is by far my favorite roll here. This is under the special menu which is written on the board there, or you can simply ask them about their special menu. Other rolls that are good are Hi Way, Spicy Shrimp, Godzilla, Spider, Unagi, and Jojo (another special menu item). They also have nigiri which is really good and fresh as well.

I love coming to this place because I never have to worry about parking and I never have to wait at any time that I have came here so far. Although I live in the city, which is a 30 minute drive, I still find myself coming here vs. other sushi buffets in the city that is around me."

Try ko sushi on weber and boughton road for all you can eat at 19.99.  Rolls are good and they don&#39;t try to pack rice and skim you on the fish.  There are other options you just need to find them out."

But if you&#39;re looking for a date night spot, might want to try someplace else.  (For that, I recommend Hokkai [AYCE] in Glen Ellyn)

We went based on a recommendation and having wanted to try a new AYCE sushi place.  When we arrived, we were seated quite quickly.  The interior was nicer than I anticipated.  They have boxed lamps on the ceiling, which looks really nice.  There was very little people there, maybe 10 other people in total.  We went to order and after placing our first order the waiter made sure that I had chosen the right roll from House Specials, because one side is included in it, the others are not.  I changed it and our apps and our sushi came out pretty quickly.  

The croquettes were fantastic, as was the coconut shrimp and the sauce that it came with.  The rolls however, were a different story. We ordered the Downer&#39;s Grove and the Godzilla Roll and the Crazy Maki.  While they lived up to their giant name, they came apart far too easily when picked up.  I feel like they weren&#39;t rolled well enough or the rice just wasn&#39;t sticky enough.  The quality was alright, about what you&#39;d expect from most AYCE.  We barely finished all three rolls before we were full. 

The one downside is the service after serving us.  I say that because no one came to refill our water, we had to explicitly ask someone to come and refill our water.  Then they messed up someone&#39;s order and delivered another coconut shrimp to our table.  When we informed them we didn&#39;t order it, they looked at us puzzled.  They didn&#39;t even ask if we wanted to go for a second round.  (WE didn&#39;t, but that&#39;s not the point).

  The service was less than ideal, but the food was alright."

It&#39;s so easy to mess up the pronunciation whether you say it with a slow or quick pace. Sushi City.....Sushi City.....Sushi S*itty..... Excuse me for such vulgar language but the sushi quality was in fact along those lines. 

It was a dinner for four on a Sunday evening at 7:00pm. There were a total of three tables including ours. With all the hype from my fellow FB friends, this definitely didn&#39;t feel right. But enough with the hesitation, we proceeded to ordering: miso soup, edamame, shumai, goyza, seaweed salad, tako su, sake sushi, tobiko sushi, ika sushi, tako sushi, unagi sushi, hokigai sushi, and dragon makimono. We ordered at least three rounds of food and it was enough to feed a village. 

The appetizers were much more appealing. I could&#39;ve spent my whole dinner chowing on the tako su and seaweed salad. The texture and quality were on par as was the portions. I particularly liked how the tako su had a hint of vinegar. The sushi was mediocre at best. They were more than generous with the rice. I imagined they took one huge chunk and squeezed it tight enough that you couldn&#39;t even find a piece of rice in full form. The sashimi slices atop the rice weren&#39;t any flattering. They were sliced to paper-thin. 

The generosity of the rice balls will most likely stay as is. I just hope they&#39;d lessen the amount of salt and rice wine vinegar with the sushi. On our way home, I was on the verge of passing out from thirst. I literally chugged one whole bottle of water the moment I arrived home. 

For $20/person, I think I can get the same &#34;punishment&#34; from the city from our fellow Para joints. In the meanwhile, any sushi buffet will be staying off my radar!"

We didn&#39;t over order or take advantage of the all you can eat...   What a pathetic joke!  My husband and I could have become extremely loyal and ongoing customers since we live so close but we won&#39;t be.  The waiter was so pushy and insistent!!!

Everything is fresh made-to-order and included is a wonderful, plentiful and great quality selection of food. By far the best all-you-can-eat sushi place in the Western suburbs of Chicago. Great service and ambiance as well.

*A note about the service: With word of mouth spreading about this place, it has gotten considerably busier. The service does their very best to handle it and doesn&#39;t deserve all the flack they get.

*A note about food quality: It&#39;s great quality food, very delicious! However, some people like to complain about the amount of rice and fish... the food is absolutely wonderful and overly-picky people with unrealistically high expectations have certainly tarnished its reputation. Each roll is hand-crafted with freshly-cooked premium white jasmine rice and the freshest fish in the suburbs.

Great options for non-sushi eaters, such as tasty dinner entrees and noodles. Vegetarian and vegan friendly as well! Definitely worth a visit!"

And to my surprise, this amazing deal doesn&#39;t just apply to sushi but with appetizers and such.  But for real, why go with filler when you can get all killer, right?!?! haha. That being said, the Torched Dragon and Blue Sky signature rolls are what you need.  These sealed the deal for me. 

The only complaint I have about Sushi City is that the service is sooooo sloooow.... Don&#39;t come here if you&#39;re in a rush or get impatient easily.

So, lunch AYCE was something like $15, I can&#39;t remember.  Even if you come in time for the lunch hours you can still upgrade to the dinner menu for $20.  So if that&#39;s your thing, go for it.  The dinner menu definitely has much more options and you can choose from the signature roll menu too, but we opted for the lunch menu.

I think I can speak more for the sushi than I was able to in my first review because I was more or less calm when I went there the 2nd time.  The sushi was good, not the freshest, but really, we&#39;re in the burbs so I&#39;ll let it pass.  Service was more attentive this time around, probably since it was less chaotic."

Sushi City. Unlike my yelp bud, Derrick T. I enjoyed this place. I know he compared this place to Sushi Para and his review was a few years back so maybe at that point in time the 2 stars was warranted. For myself, I would say Sushi City is a good 4 stars. Sushi Para has gone down in quality and I thought the rolls at Sushi City to be good for AYCE sushi.

Although we came during lunch we did the dinner AYCE option to order some of the specialty rolls. Not going to name all the sushi we ordered, but we only had one miss and that was the blueberry mayo one. Avoid that and all should be well. 

Oh and avoid the fried stuff like the tempura as those were really greasy when we went. For the price though, still quite happy with the meal here!"

I have never gotten more than half way down my glass of water before having it quickly shoshed full of filtered ice water. I have had many of ever single selections on the ayce menu and several from the regular menu. They are one of the only sushi places to serve my fav. super white tuna...remember to be careful with this &#34;colon blow fish&#34; and if you don&#39;t know, gurgle it. This has a wonderful oily taste, but have more than a few cuts of this fish actually called &#34;escolar&#34; and you will feel like John Candy on Xenical. 

Anyhoo, yes, it can take a while to make the food. There are two little sushi chefs behind the counter. So yes, order lots of stuff. BTW if you watch them, they are actually quite quick with those pointy razor sharp knives. I would imagine you would not want to piss them off and damper that quiet Asian smile they always seem to have. I could just imagine someone trying to rob the place and get made into a bunch of sushi. Heh. &#34;Twy our new, fresh convict sashimi, so very sowwy, no burglar maki roll left&#34; Uh so yeah, don&#39;t order a single stinking roll, eat it and then another. Just order a bunch of stuff. I have pulled rolls apart and left a cup of rice and seaweed on my plate and the wait staff just cleared the plates and brought clean ones without a word. 

That being said, yes of course thy want you to eat all the rice...which is good, well cooked ahort grain rice btw....but if you have a few bites that you don&#39;t want, just put it in your napkin or something. Jeez. I didn&#39;t find this out of proportion. You know,  eating sushi actually means eating rice, yeah?

So the Miso is salty,... it is cooked down for hours. Nobody wants it. That is just stuff that comes for free when you go eat expensive sushi by the roll. The best is the fresh shrimp dumplings and pot stickers....whatever they are called. Order three orders for each dude...trust me they are small. All the other fish was pretty top shelf. Of course I am spoiled because I eat sushi in New England where the fish is still wriggling around a little when you eat it because you just chose it while it was still swimming around and watched a sushi master slaughter it before your eyes.

It was kind of fun being the largest four people In the place. The people of Wal-mart does not hold a candle to me and my boys. The 90 lb Asian waitress looked at us like we were going to dip her in wasabi and eat her. But despite our ordering literally about what would have been $150 in sushi for our first order, the staff didn&#39;t bat an eye. They didn&#39;t lecture us about leaving left overs or some stupid rules. Yes, we ate a lot. No, it was not the top flight sushi you could pay $7.50 for two little cuts for. But it was flavorful and plentiful and it is sashimi grade fish. The place was decorated with simple minimalist design. There was plenty of sake choices if that is your thing....hot alcohol, not my thing. The subsequent orders did not really take that long at all. 

It was really fun to re- order and eat the same $150 quantity of the same thing three more times and eat every bit of it. Again, no one bitched or recited stupid rules to us. The 90lb Asian waitress actually seemed either impressed, or disgusted. Either way, we were pretty happy and tipped her a twenty."

My friend has been raving to me about this place so when my daughter and I were in the area we stopped in for lunch! 

It was quickly approaching nap time so I decided to get out order to go. I ordered the turkey spin-art with chips and a pickle for myself. My daughter got the kids menu grilled cheese which comes with apples sauce and chocolate milk. I also grabbed a turtle jar and a chocolate chip jar. Everyone in the store is so friendly. I really enjoyed that! 

When we got home I expected the sandwiches to be soggy as someone stated in another review. No way! They held up perfectly. The turkey spin-art was so good. I will definitely be back for that. My three year old is the pickiest eater and she ate 3/4 of that grilled cheese. There is something to be said about that for sure. 

But the jar was really where I was impressed. The cheesecake was the perfect consistency. I didn&#39;t think the crust was crumbly at all. It was perfect. As I lay on the couch right now with the cheesecake-sweats all I can think about is how my husbands chocolate chip jar is in the fridge... 

If you are local get yourself over there. It&#39;s a much better alternative to the fast food that&#39;s all over the area. I love supporting small business and this one rocks!"

My wife has been here many times before during weekday hours for lunch, and absolutely raves about it.  We went here for lunch on a Saturday. 
I was expecting it to be like a bakery, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It is set up like a deli, but with a more upscale feel. Plenty of seating inside and out. Order at the counter and they bring the food to you. You can help yourself to a can of soda or other drinks, and they have a case for their cheesecake jars.
The menu is pretty descent. Mostly panini and other sandwiches. All of them sounded great, but I tried Kelli&#39;s Grilled Cheese. It was a panini with two cheeses and sliced tomato. Excellent!  Choice of sides, but I was simple with chips and a pickle. There is a good kids menu here. My son had a grilled cheese also. I tried it, and it was pretty good. His side was homemade apple sauce. I could probably eat it with every one of my meals.  
My wife got a cherry cheesecake jar for after our meal. I tried a bit of it, and wow!  I&#39;m not a cheesecake fan, but this was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. My toddler son tried it as well, and he actually wouldn&#39;t let us have any more. 
The food was great, and inexpensive. There are plenty of choices here, so probably anyone can go here and find something to eat, including picky toddlers.  The staff was very good as well. Everyone smiles and they are very social.  It is a very comfortable atmosphere as soon as you walk in the door.

I&#39;d had my eye on SB&#39;s Cheesecake Store for quite some time, and when I finally visited, I was pretty pumped. Mini mason jars? Filled with cheesecake?! Totes adorbs! I&#39;ve been several times, and here are my pointers:

Cheesecake: Reader beware - not all cheesecake is created equal. I&#39;ve had very flavorful cheesecake here, and I&#39;ve had very bland. This is much of the reason I&#39;ve only marked three stars - no consistency. Some of the flavors I&#39;ve picked have been wildly disappointing. However, this won&#39;t stop me from continuing to try out new flavors. 

Food: Pass. This is the other main reason that I docked stars. We were here to pick up a bunch of cheesecake jars around lunchtime on a Saturday. We always try to support local businesses, so thought we&#39;d give the food a try. We ordered carry-out, because the restaurant only has a few tables and they were all taken. We&#39;re also only two minutes away. By the time we arrived at home, my panini (which the person behind the counter recommended) couldn&#39;t be lifted up, as it was completely soggy and falling apart. The lobster bisque (which other reviewers raved about) was lacking the lobster and was heavy on the cream. As my husband put it, &#34;this isn&#39;t anything I couldn&#39;t make at home&#34;. Another wild disappointment.

Deals: If you return your mason jars, you get $.50 off your next purchase - and you can combine them! Since I&#39;ve purchased for two small family parties, I have enough to redeem for several free items. I&#39;ll do my best to pick out some great items, but if flavor is lacking again, this may be the last time we visit."

The cheesecake in the jars is a great idea! I have zero complaints about portable cheesecake! I tried the key lime and the cherry cheesecake.  The cheesecakes were OK, they could have been more flavorful and the texture is not what I expected.  It was more like a very thick custard, than a cheesecake-like texture.  Which is fine, just not what I expected.

I tried the lobster bisque which was also OK. Again, not much flavor and very little lobster. To me it tasted very similar to the lobster bisque they sell at Mariano&#39;s.

Then, I tried the Reuben panini. This was pretty tasty! The slaw instead of sauerkraut was a really nice touch! Also really liked the hummus as a side.

The restaurant itself is clean and very nicely decorated. The staff was so friendly!!! I&#39;d really like to try the cheesecake ice cream, so I&#39;ll probably be back."

A friend of mine is obsessed, and I had been meaning to try it, but whenever I had been out that way, the store would be closed. Finally made it out there on New Year&#39;s Eve, and danggggg did it smell heavenly in there! Next time, I plan to bring my husband back to try their sandwiches and salads. I got 4 jars of cheesecake for us to split and try- all of them delicious! We got Turtle, Cookies and Cream, Vanilla Bean, and Gingerbread(my least fav out of the 4- it was too &#34;spicy&#34; of a ginger flavor).

I do have a suggestion though! They should offer cheesecake parfaits- layers of cheesecake filling w/ the crust in between. The crust was the best part, and just not enough IMO!!

There was a young girl(maybe 10?) running the cash register. I&#39;m assuming she&#39;s the owner&#39;s daughter. But she was pleasant and did a great job too.

The Cheesecake Store is in a new, mostly desolate, strip mall on Route 30 in Plainfield.  The area is mostly dotted with newer subdivisions.  Since it is so close to home, I couldn&#39;t resist checking this place out.

I was surprised that the Cheesecake Store has more than just cheesecake.  I was expecting a small bakery, but there&#39;s a full cafe inside with limited seating.  The menu consisted mostly of panini and salads, with some options for kids.  And this place really packs in the business - there wasn&#39;t a single open seat on Saturday afternoon.

The cheesecake is stored in the refrigerator case by the register.  Even though it was busy, there was still a nice variety of flavors available in both jar sizes.  Small jars are $3, and large jars are $5.  If you bring back a clean jar, you get 50 cents off of your next purchase.  

Small jars are perfect portions for one person, and I wanted to try two flavors, so I chose the Salted Caramel and the Key Lime - both in small jars.

I really liked the salted caramel, but the key lime wasn&#39;t very tangy or limey.  I do love cheesecake, but I didn&#39;t particularly like their graham cracker crust.  It was soggy and crumbly, probably from being under the moisture of the cheesecake and then sealed in a jar.

I would come back here for cheesecake cravings, especially since there isn&#39;t a Cheesecake Factory in the area, but I&#39;m not quite at the point where I&#39;m telling all of my friends in distant lands all about it."

I was disappointed to see at noon they only had 3-4 varieties available. It seems to get the flavors you want, you better be here early. We picked the Salted Caramel and Turtle and set out. While checking out, I was surprised to find out they had only been open for 3 weeks. Those are amazing reviews to have after only three weeks! 

The salted caramel was great. The topping was delicious and the cheesecake is incredibly smooth. My only qualm is the amount of graham cracker crumb at the bottom. It&#39;s a thick layer and hard to get to in the first few bites. The turtle was OK, but not as good as the salted caramel. I wish we were able to get/try more but there wasn&#39;t much available.

The colors are darker greys and browns, the table tops for the holidays are decorated with simple holiday snow globes.  I ordered the Kung Fu Tuna Wrap which came with my choice of side(hummus and veggies.) The food is served on what we thought to be old china.  All of is compared it to items we remembered from our grandparents. This only adds to the charm.   

My food was fresh, so tasty(I ate it all), and perfectly portioned for the price.  I added to my mean a small cheesecake in a jar(cherry cheesecake).   I love my sweets.  I have a sweet tooth that never stops and I have now found my new love.   As it states in the history of the store on the shops wall, these are literally portable slices of cheesecake and taste like a thick perfectly sweet, not overpowering, New York cheesecake.   I think it is a great idea and I also like that if you return your mason jar(clean), you will receive a $.50 off when you next visit.

There were about five cars waiting for delicious cheesecake the day we went. 

My wife and I bought four jars of cheesecake and two orders of the lobster bisque to go. 

The owner, Steve, was very kind, welcoming and friendly. But the entire store smelled like burnt oil (or burnt something?). Not sure if that&#39;s normal, but even tho we were only there a few minutes we left with our clothes smelling of it. 

To be quite honest, our lobster bisque wasn&#39;t impressive. That burnt smell had permeated into the soup and it was rather unpleasant. There were only two tiny pieces of lobster in my whole bowl, and most of the contents were shallots (or onions? I can never tell the difference). 

The cheesecake jars were very nice. Creamy. Sweet. Smooth. I enjoyed them a great deal. The first one I ate wrong, and as I reached the bottom I was left with a 2-inch pile of graham cracker dust. The second one I had I tried to mix the crust in with my bites of cheesecake, but eating it from a jar is not really conducive to such a method and I was still left with a hard graham cracker dust crust when I was done. To be honest, I&#39;d prefer either less crust or no crust at all. 

I understand the business started as a mobile cheesecake truck, so the jarred cheesecake concept makes sense. But now that there&#39;s a store I would have preferred slices. The jars are difficult to eat out of and I hate wasting them. Steve offers a $.50 discount on your next purchase for returning clean jars, but honestly it&#39;s kind of far and I probably won&#39;t be back so I had to toss them in the recycle bin. Sad. 

Overall, great cheesecake. Excellent service and friendliness. Not fond of the crust or jars. Didn&#39;t like the soup. It was fun to try but I probably wouldn&#39;t make the journey back."

The flavor of the cheesecake itself was mild and on the unsweetened side.  I prefer more sweetness and flavor in the cake.  Most of the flavor came from the mix-ins:  caramel, nuts, chocolate, etc.

While they were pretty good, it&#39;s a little bit impractical to serve them in mason jars. For one thing, there really is no crust, just a crust like crumble at the bottom of the jar. The problem with the jar concept is that you can&#39;t really get any bites of cheesecake with the crumble until you get almost to the bottom of the jar and that&#39;s all that&#39;s left. I didn&#39;t even bother eating it once I got to the bottom because I had already ate all the cheesecake, and who just wants plain crumble? I get that the mason jar thing is their gimmick in hopes of making their cheesecake stand out from the rest, but it would seem more economical for them to just sell slices of cheesecake instead of having to buy mason jars to put the cheesecake in. They do have an offer where they give you a percentage off your next purchase if you bring back the cleaned jars, so I guess that helps defer some of the cost of the jars. I do plan to go back to try the sandwiches as those looked really good, but I&#39;d probably take them to go. The reason: the place has a strong odor of what smells like garlic when you walk in. It&#39;s so strong that I was still smelling it in my nose when I got home. It was very overwhelming. But besides all that I will try the sandwiches one day."

Steve&#39;s cheesecakes have graced my fridge and my company&#39;s luncheon more than a few times so I know I&#39;m getting a great dessert.  But now it was time to try the food!  
Grown Up Panini with Jicama slaw-  Perfectly toasted panini with pesto, fresh tomato and a yummy piece of mozzarella . The cheese was not oily like other places sell, or dry and crackling.  It melted perfectly and was so smooth!  The slaw was cold, crunchy and lightly flavored with cider vinegar and cilantro among other flavors. So good! Like so good I had to pace myself!
Son had---Kung Fu Tuna Wrap with chips and a pickle
Great all white tuna flavored with a little kick!  The wrap was lightly toasted too! Very good!
Also for my son---Grilled cheese panini with side salad.  Cheese again was not oily like other well known places serve.  It melted so perfect I was tempted to snatch a bite! Side salad was a great mix of leafy goodness!
Ice cold lemon infused water free of charge was waiting and the staff was very friendly!
I will be back!!!
Topped it off with Cherry Amaretto and my son had the the same!

When you visit Steve will most likely be around.  Ask him anything!  He takes great pride in not only serving you great food but providing great service and food that is good for you!  Chef Logan is the bomb-diggity!!!  The staff is always friendly!  Service goes a long way but great food stays with you!  Definitely have to come back!"

It has been a wonderful thing to watch him grow and I admire him for enduring and overcoming all the obstacles it has taken him to succeed. 

My family and I had lunch on day at his store and thoroughly enjoyed the Lobster Bisque soup. It was homemade and divine! 

We also had his cheesecakes which as phenomenal.  

If you are looking for a cute cafe for lunch with the best cheesecake around, look no further."

Decided to check this out, my son and i really enjoyed the novelty of the cheesecake.

They have about 12 or so flavors written on their menu, food items like sandwiches and some soups.

The cheesecake come in a little mason jar type of thing, a big and small portion. It is reasonably priced and tasty.

The staff is nice and friendly. I look forward to coming in again!

And now he has a restaurant! My friend and I ventured out today for the first time, and it was everything I had hoped it would be. 

His new place is so cute and the staff is very welcoming. I had a delicious caprese panini with a salad and the salted caramel cheesecake. It was heaven in a jar!

The only downside is that my clothes smell kind of funky? Not sure what that&#39;s about, but for the amazing cheesecake, I&#39;m willing to change my clothes!

When we came for dinner I had the All-Grown Up panini and it was very tasty! We left with a few jars of cheesecake and a personal check-in with Steve himself. He was super polite to my kids and wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.

The daughter raved about the grilled cheese, I stole a bite and it defiantly deserved all the praise she was giving it! And we can&#39;t forgot about the cheesecake, my favorite is still salted Carmel but the eggnog was a nice Christmasy feeling treat for the day.

I arrived to KFC at around 7:00 pm. I asked for two meals, before I was told that they are out of grilled chicken. When I asked how long it will take for them to grill a new batch, that same employee, who initially told me they do not have any available, changed her mind and said that they do have a few pieces left. I said fine. My wife was told to wait 2 minutes, yes 2 minutes for her order (regular fried chicken). The employee looked and sounded completely wasted and her eyes were extremely red, as if she were high on drugs (my assmuption, given the way she was talking and behaving). Still, I minded my own business and I said thank you and stepped aside.

My order arrived missing the side and my wife&#39;s order took over 25 minutes, not 2 minutes as we were initially told. During that time, I made more than 3 visits to the counter to ask about the status and that same employee constantly ignored me and forgot about the order. Finally, I went to her and expressed my concern and asked her to bring my food asap, because it was getting really frustrating to just sit and wait and be ignored. Her rude response to me was, &#34;yeah, well I have been working since 5 am&#34;, even though that KFC opens at 10:00 AM. (As I was told later by the district manager)

So, I decided to speak to the manager, but there was non on duty. Then, I asked one of the other employees (a gentleman who was very nice and professional) to give me a phone number that I can call. He gave me the number of the district manager. I did call her on her number (779) 435-3442. I explained what happened and she was very surprised that there was no manager on duty, even though I never complained about that matter.

She was nice at first and while I was explaining to her about the issue, that same employee heard me as she was exiting the restaurant. I left the restaurant and did not accept getting a refund for the meals and started driving. Few minutes later, my phone rang and that same district manager started telling me that 3 &#34;different&#34; customers called her to say that I was screaming and swearing at the poor &#34;high&#34; employee and that it was all my fault.

She did not even allow me to speak and she hung up at me after telling me that I am not welcome at KFC and that she will give my number to the police.

My wife called her to explain to her that non of what she was told is true. I believe that the employee made her friends call and pretend to be customers after she heard me complain over the phone. However, instead of allowing my soft spoken wife to speak, again she shamelessly hung up in my wife&#39;s face and told her not to ever call again.

Now, I am a 44 year old professor at a very respectable school. The last thing I would do is swear and yell at a 16 year old girl who works at a KFC. The store had cameras all over it and one would expect that a district manager who manages 9 locations as she claimed, to at least investigate things before jumping into conclusions of that magnitude. 

I have kids with the same age group as this employee. It is outrageous for a manager to believe that &#34;3 different&#34; customers would call an unpublished number, that is only available upon special request and lie about what happened; (mind you that the store did not even have 3 customers at the time). The district manager insulted me, nsulted my wife and did not even give us the chance to speak. I was begging her to just let me talk and she would just not stop talking and hang up.  

I have travalled accross continents and have been always loyal to this chain and never in my life witnessed such attitude and behavior. It really is not about the food that was late and it is not about the teen ager cashier. It is about the principle and the customer&#39;s right and minimal respect. This behavior from a district manager is completely unacceptable.

I will never eat at any KFC again. I will make it my very mission to let as many people that I know, know about what happened, unless if that disrespectful district manager calls back (she knows my number) and listens to me and to my respectful wife and  appologize for her actions. Those many cameras at the store are not for decoration and should be used in such situations. It would have taken her 5 minutes to validate who is at fault instead of acting the way she did.

What a shame that a big brand like KFC would step down to this level and acuse customers of illogical lies. Absolutely disgraceful and insulting to even think about what happened.

Note: I did file a complaint through the KFC website and I did call the customer service center and spoke to someone about the matter. I am supposed to recieve a call very soon from the HQ and I will update this story based on how things progress.

Thank you.

District manager:

Shame on you and shame on who gave you that job."

I must say the food is very good, and quite unique in comparison to other Mexican restaurants. It actually tastes closer to homemade food than anything else. I like the chile relleno and the cheese enchiladas. The refried beans are delicious, but as a warning to anyone who eats halal or kosher, I used to taste pork in it, though now I don&#39;t taste it anymore. It may be wise to ask if the refried beans have pork in them. The chips and salsa they give you are very good, though the &#34;mild&#34; salsa isn&#39;t spicy at all (possibly to suit the tastes of the inhabitants of central Wheaton). The only complaint I have is that I received my food a little cold once, but this is one out of at least 20 times that I&#39;ve been here.

The service has always been very good and the manager has always been very polite and friendly. There&#39;s no time any waitress has been rude.

I&#39;m not a huge fan of the price range, but what can you expect from a place in downtown Wheaton? Luckily, they do give you a lot of food. Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t your local taqueria, a lot of the dishes are set up to fit the tastes of central Wheaton (which has to be among the least culturally diverse Chicago suburbs).

The general ambiance is pretty nice. It&#39;s definitely a step-up from the other non-American restaurants in downtown Wheaton. It&#39;s also more pleasant than your typical taqueria, while still maintaining that Mexican feel, but it&#39;s not like being in one of Gordon Ramsay&#39;s restaurants. The one thing is that there is somewhat loud music at times, but this is no surprise to anyone who goes to Mexican restaurants frequently.

Overall, I&#39;ve had great experiences and the food is definitely good. I definitely recommend this place."

I opened up my to-go container if nachos to find 8 chips with barely anything on them. A little sprinkle of cheese, a little beef. Eight chips... That is not an exaggeration. Needless so say I was pretty upset that I paid so much for eight chips. I will say though, on a positive note, the guacamole was delicious.

I can&#39;t say I was thrilled about the &#34;cock fighting&#34; implied in one of the murals, but otherwise the overall theme and ambience is pleasant.

I had a decent margarita and the food was ok. The chips and salsa were not particularly exciting. I surely would not pay $2 for a basket of chips. Christopher had steak fajitas. The meat tasted good, but it did not come out sizzling, but on a regular plate and buried under a huge pile of grilled veggies. The ratio of veggies to meat was way over the top. The rice and beans were decent, though typical. Nothing was a stand out.

I had the Chilaquiles with steak. The steak was pleintiful and very tasty. The chilaquiles were very soggy, and although the flavor was not bad, it kind of turned me off because it was like mush. I would not order it again.

They seemed to do some things well (like steak), but other elements of our meals ranged from ok to fair. The guacamole side I ordered was average. I am glad I did not get a full order. Christoper opted for fried ice cream for dessert. He said he it was mediocre and that he had much better at other places.

As we do not live in Wheaton, we will not be back to this place. If you are a local however, and sort out the food items they do best, you can probably put together a decent meal."

I think the food is good, however, I did feel nickel and dimed. I ordered a combination with two items for myself, and a combination with 3 items to split amongst my 3 young children. I was surprised to see a $1 per extra plate charge for splitting the combo amongst the kids. I didnt even ask to have them split in the kitchen. It would have been a waste to order them individual meals. Not to mention the $2 charge per additional chip basket. I mean, chips? Isn&#39;t that a staple complimentary item in Mexican restaurants? Although the food was ok, I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place. You can literally walk around the corner to the cantina and get a much better deal. $54 for two meals and a drink a piece. Pffft.

Anyway, walked in about 7 PM (MAD DINNER RUSH) and we got a table right away. This place is on a street corner; small, unassuming, and very good. We didn&#39;t get our water right away, which wasn&#39;t a big deal at all, because I wasn&#39;t sure if the staff knew who had the honor of having me as a patron.

Of course, par for the course, they bring chips and two types of salsa. Chips are double bogey for nutrition. Don&#39;t waste your stomach on that! My mom got a combo with three things (tamale, burrito, y enchilada). I went with the Huevos a la Mexicana and double black beans. It was a great choice for both of us. My mom had been here before, but I never have (you would think, 22 plus years of being a Wheaton resident and actually working for the city, I would have hit all the spots, BUT I DIGRESS). Salsa that came with the chips was good. I hit the spicy salsa hard, as my mom described the mild as tomato soup like.

Those murals on the wall, the decor, and the ambiance of the place make it feel more, authentic, if you will. I certainly can&#39;t be objective about it, since I haven&#39;t been south of the border, but I was in San Diego and Tucson, which are pretty much the same, right?

As I took in the atmosphere, it was some guys birthday, and the waitress put on the &#34;El Zarape&#34; sombrero, which was displayed for all to see. It was also hilarious that said guy enjoys a breese, as his behind was hanging out of his pants as he ate. 


All in all, if you&#39;re looking for a solid meal, come here. For the reviewers who posted about cock fighting, it&#39;s the culture. I just wish Enrique was there singing or something. Small, unassumming, and SOLID!"

We normally come on a Saturday night which is probably their busiest night of the week and we have always have had a good experience.  I do not believe that they take reservations but normally we never wait more than 10 minutes for a table for two. The staff has always been friendly and efficient.  The dinner always begins with complimentary chips and two types of salsa; hot and mild.  This works out great for us because my boyfriend prefers hot and spicy while I prefer mild.  The serving of chips is always plenty for two people.  The servers have always been friendly, prompt and efficient.  The manager/owner is always there and often stops by the table to check in and ask if we need anything.  The margaritas are good but often we opt for beer.  I normally order the same thing - bean burrito with rice and beans but my boyfriend usually orders something different each time.  The food is always fresh and portions are ample.

I stopped in for a margarita while I waited for my train. The waitress said she had to check with her manager about my government issued Texas ID. He came over to question me about it, though it clearly stated that I was over 21, the picture matched me, and watermarks confirmed the ID valid. He asked for a second ID, which I assured him he didn&#39;t need with a valid 21+ ID in front of him. I ended up having to show him a credit card with my name on it to prove my identity I suppose? How unbelievably insulting and rude. And he made a scene in front of the whole restaurant. 

They then proceeded to charge me for the chips and salsa, which I didn&#39;t order. My margarita was over $10, more than the usual price of a meal, but they charged me for chips! I have never been to a place that charged for chips. Truly rude. They said that I should have &#34;not eaten them&#34; after she placed them in front of me in order to indicate that I wasn&#39;t ordering food. What, would they have served them to the next guest? I let them know that I thought it was both rude and wrong to charge for those. He argued you with me, holding up multiple customers waiting to pay, making a scene, and almost causing me to miss my train. I told him I&#39;d be the gracious one and pay, but I wanted him to know that I thought it was terrible hospitality.

It&#39;s really too bad, because it was a pretty good margarita. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t patronize a place that treats their customers this poorly."

We are glad we did. Excellent chips, the salsas were good (the warm mild sauce was almost creamy -yum!). Basic margarita was OK, I had the Patron Margarita rocks+salt, much better. Daily special pork carnitas were like pork fajitas, but slow-cooked, not grilled - wonderful, juicy, meaty with excellent sides. Fish tacos also on special were great. Excellent FRESH coffee, and good friendly service.

My only beef is with drink prices. I thought the entrees were fairly priced, but the menu did not show drink prices. The Patron Margarita was $12, a regular $8. Seems more of a downtown Chicago price. A bottle of Bohemia was a much more reasonable $5. Booze seems a little pricey. Our food was $28, drinks were $40. But was good. I would definitely go back and drink beer. Negra Modelo!"

It&#39;s more Americanized than local taquerias, but has a solid menu with lots to choose from.  Perhaps it&#39;s just a fuzzy, warm memory but I love the orangeish warm sauce which comes with the chips and is on the enchiladas.  Simple, yes, but real good.

My boyfriend and I found this restaurant driving through downtown Wheaton looking for something that looked appetizing.  

As we walked in, I smiled because this was exactly what I had in mind.  The painted mural, various Mexican decor, as well as the sound of today&#39;s pop hits (en espanol, of course).

We were promptly served by a friendly waitress who took our drink order and brought chips and salsa.  Chips seemed to be homemade, but the two salsas definitely were.  The mild salsa was warm (in temperature) and had a tomato base.  The spicy salsa was chunky

For my meal, I ordered the two chicken enchilada combo plate.  It came with rice &amp; beans (I chose black beans).  The enchiladas were excellent!  Homemade tortilla wrapped around shredded chicken topped with a flavorful red sauce.  My boyfriend opted for the two (beef) taco lunch special.  Looked pretty basic, but he seemed to enjoy them.

Overall, our meal was very enjoyable.  I mentioned that I would like to come back again to enjoy a margarita or two.  The only thing I would like to see in this restaurant is a salsa bar, (similar to Salseria in Elmhurst).  That would be enough to bump my rating up to 5 stars."

But really what brings people in is the food.
The chips were oily and the salsa was either bland or too hot.  After we finished the basket, being charged $2 for more chips was not reasonable and very off putting.
We ordered a tostada, enchiladas, tacos and a burrito.  So we had quite a variety.  None of the food was good.  It was very bland.  The beans and rice were tasteless.  If a Mexican restaurant cannot make tasty beans and rice, then it can&#39;t make anything more complicated is my opinion.

While the food is nothing extremely out of the ordinary, it&#39;s tasty, and the chips and salsa are great.  The salsa itself is rather spicy, and the enchilada sauce given for dipping as well is perfect if spicy is not your thing.  The entrees come with beans and rice, so you leave feeling full.  The price is just right for me, and I&#39;m not rich, so not sure where the gripes with the prices came from.

I love the fact that the owners are very nice and that they decorate the heck out of the place.  Every month has a theme and the curtains and tablecloths are changed to fit the theme.  Halloween has little pumpkin curtains and July has patriotic themes.   I think they make them themselves and it adds to the place.

The restaurant itself is quite small (one little room), and rather dark inside, but, again, the owners make up for this by adding a lot of charm to the decoration.

For dessert, make sure to get the hot sopapillas (fried dough) with the chocolate dipping sauce and whipped cream.  Those are at least 75% of the reason I go there!  SO tasty.

The margaritas are GOOD.  We got 1/2 pitcher of the grande and I could taste the alcohol and not that sweet stuff that is usually poured on.  You get the salty tortilla chips and 2 containers of salsa, one is mild and one is spicy, when you sit down.

For dinner I got the chicken fajitas with black beans and rice.  Normally you get refried beans, but they let me substitute with no problem.  Hubby had the Carne Asada ala Tampiquena and his skirt steak was perfectly cooked.  They had tons of authentic Mexican stuff on the menu and it was hard to choose.  They also have authentic Mexican sodas.  It wasn&#39;t the same as being in Cancun, but it was MUCH better than some of the other &#34;authentic&#34; places.

We split a fried ice cream for dessert and lingered for a long time without being hassled.  We drive by this place all the time and had never checked it out.  It was a nice surprise!"

Have never been a fan of their rice due to some wierd after taste and after effects, but there were other items to order. Tried their tacos one evening, not so bad. So, it was a rainy afternoon and we stopped by for lunch. Only one other table being served at the time, although they didn&#39;t appear to be happy with the food. Left most of it on the plate, then left. I ordered tacos with black beans and rice. My partner ordered enchiladas. When the orders came out, you couldn&#39;t tell which was which. It was just a runny mess. The black beans that I ordered came directly from a can. They were not rinsed or cooked, but cold and swimming in that liquid that canned beans have.  We sampled each others entrees. They tasted exactly the same!  Like frozen microwaved Mexican? Food.  Eww!  Maybe this place changed owners or suffers from lack of customers, the recession, i dont know.  Make something up!  But it&#39;s not fresh or good."

The warm sauce reminded us of Hernandez in Delavan, WI.  The bad, they do charge you for more chips ($2.00), which we can live with that because they were tasty and addicting.  The service is not very good and not one person that works there had a smile on their face (that generally flows down from the owner/management).  The lack of friendliness tends to bring down the entire tone of the restaurant.   The unfriendly service is odd as the restaurant is decorated very cute and cozy.   We had the pork (carnitas) special, which was very tender and was seasoned very flavorfully (this came with a couple of flour tortillas).  The other entree was a beef enchilada special, which was kind of heavy and somewhat over flavored by all the shredded cabbage on top and heavy on the potatoes.   They do not appear to change their specials, as they were the same ones when we were in a couple of weeks earlier on a Saturday for lunch.  The ugly comes in when we asked for two more tortillas for the pork dish we ended up being charged an extra $1.25 for them!  I would have to say that we have been to over 60 Mexican restaurants and have NEVER been charged for little flour tortillas!  When the owner was asked why would they charge a customer that just purchased $29.00 for two entrees and $22.00 for 4 tap beers to pay an extra $1.25 for a couple of flour tortillas, he was actually aggressive and stated other high end restaurants charge for extra tortillas.  Well sorry to inform you Sir Owner, this is certainly not a high-end restaurant.  The prices were on the high end, but realistically, that was it!  We would have liked to come back to this restaurant as we did feel the food was overall very good, but with no one smiling and friendly, and the owner&#39;s non-concern for the customer; it leaves us no choice but to go spend our hard-earned-money elsewhere.

For tacos, try &#34;el pastor&#34; - the green sauce and onions are wonderfully tangy and not too heavy. 

For starters, the two salsa selections are both good, but I agree with other raters that it is an annoyance to pay for seconds of chips &amp; salsa when you are ordering dinner and drinks.  I wonder how much business they&#39;ve lost since implementing this policy.

If you are looking for a burrito (or chimichanga) you might like Front Street better, but for a subtly spicy main dish and a family-run restaurant vibe, I choose EZ."

We got a burrito and flauta.  The fact that we spent over $20 yet they still insist on charging us for extra chips is absolutely ridiculous to me!  I have NEVER been to a Mexican restaurant where they charge for extra chips, especially when the basket they come in is so dinky and small!

French fries and a lifeless-looking plate of iceberg are offered as replacement for the beans and rice but who eats French fries with tacos?

To make matters worse, a la carte ordering is no longer permitted at dinner - each person now must order a complete dinner w/ rice &amp; beans.  That was never a problem for me, but my wife has a small appetite and always ordered a couple of tacos a la carte.

This is definitely not authentic Mexican food, but what Chipotle does it does pretty well. The food is fresh, you can customize your order, and the price is decent. 
     For this particular location, there are few things that are bothersome. First of all, it gets very cold in this Chipotle location. In the winter it is almost unbearable to eat inside. Second of all, the employees are pretty restrained with the toppings. If I&#39;m paying over seven dollars for a burrito bowl I would like to at least see the meat that I&#39;m paying for. I do understand that as a business maybe you need to be frugal with the meat, but it wouldn&#39;t kill to put more veggies on top (and I&#39;m not talking about the lettuce). 
     A problem with Chipotle is that your food ends up being cold because all of the toppings are straight out of the refrigerator. There&#39;s been plenty of times I&#39;ve had to take my food home and warm it up in the microwave. Despite all of this, I still like going to chipotle when I need something fast and fresh to eat."

Now for the rational of 1-star.  My husband and I visited this location many times and each time we have the same experience.  NO FOOD.  

Last friday which was April 17th we arrived at 7:10 and didnt leave the line until 7:30.  
They had run out of white rice (a Chipotle staple) and they had also run out of steak and chicken.  We decided to wait rather than go across the street to Buona Beef.  HUGE MISTAKE!  We waiting for 15 minutes along with 6-7 other people.  When the food became available they didnt notify any of hte people they knew were waiting.  After seeing other leave with chicken we went up and asked how come no one notified us this was ready.  The said they forgot.  You forgot? About 7 people staring you down from the side of the line?  Strange. 

Regardless we finally had our food.  My husband got the steak and I the chicken.
The chicken was very good but my husband steak bowl consisted of 1/2 fat and 1/2 steak.  Not sure what is going on at this location but no manager was to be found anywhere."

Let&#39;s start out with the burrito bowl. I had one for the first time thanks to a recommendation from a friend. You get meat, rice, beans, veggies, among other choices in a GIANT bowl for about $8. It&#39;s my new favorite item on the menu. Their tacos are amazing as well but for the price you don&#39;t get as much food.

The Chips are warm and taste amazing with the homemade guac they sell.  There is also food for vegetarians as well."

Has a great patio area but doesn&#39;t seem to handle crowds well. I got the my usual steakburrito and it was poorly wrapped, fell apart half way through and someone had brought back their burrito because it fell apart and they remade it.

We ate outside but by the time we starting eating the burrito (and my wife had tacos), were getting cold, yet it was 80 degrees out, so that means the meat and all as barely hot.

I consider El Famous to be the &#34;gold standard&#34; in tacos and burritos (yet my wife isn&#39;t crazy about them), but after this trip Chipotle still has a ways to go."

Sad to say not going to be in my top 10. I like the food but during busy times they get skimpy. If you need anything that&#39;s not on front of the team.... They aren&#39;t sure what to do. The  chicken has gotten dark with  fat globs.  Love the freshness. I think it&#39;s a bit pricey and needs attention to dining room during busy hours. This is NOT wheelchair friendly . the way you have to order is difficult to maneuver and the dining room can not be rolled through when busy.

For me it&#39;s the rice with a dash of lime taste to it plus the grilled veggies is the main thing here...Then I usually try different kind of meat, depending on my mood. My kids like the chips and guac and the cheese quesadilla. The freshly brewed ice tea washes the spiciness of the salsa in a good way. The line is always long specially during meal time but the service is quick so it&#39;s worth of a little wait.

For a long time, I was like &#34;oh yeah chipotle&#39;s ok&#34; but then i realized my issue was just that those burritos are so stinkin big it was just overwhelming. That&#39;s when I discovered the BurritoBol. Hooray, all the insides of a burrito but in an easy to use bowl. I had always been going with chicken on mine. Then one day I tried the steak. Sweet! Whatever magic they use to season their steak...I must confess my love to those spices. The chips rule, Salty goodness. The guacamole is delightful. I don&#39;t exactly understand why they charge you $1.25 to put guacamole on your burrito but whatever. 

When we go with the kids we drop a tip in the jar because we feel bad that there is going to be a rice explosion under our chairs when we leave. So hopefully that makes up for it....."

I have been to 4 different Chipotles but this one is by far my favorite.  Their steak is always very tender and juicy.  The location in Oswego (where I live) the steak is dry and tough.  I don&#39;t know what they do different but there is something different about the way they cook the steak.  I will drive all the way to the Bolingbrook location for my buritto.  The staff is very friendly and I go there often enough that they know what I want before I order it.  They use the best products from the best farms.  All pesticide and hormone free!!!  Yummy.

Of course, it is a very new location, so it&#39;s very clean, well lit and maintained.  I like the fact that every time you order something, there is a mild taste variation, so you pretty much know that it is made fresh daily.  The hot salsa and barbacoa is just a little tangier from one visit to the next.  The service here is always quick and friendly.  And fresh brewed iced tea is always a good thing.

The Naperville location is cool. It&#39;s right across from a Barnes and Noble, in downtown Naperville. The space is big and the layout is not weird. I&#39;ve always got fresh, hot food from here, and efficient service. 

I like the bowls because you get more and you dont have that flour torilla (not very healthy for you).

I have attached a picture below to help yelpers see. Steak tasted like a gummy bear with a steak appearance. It was so chewy it reminded me of eating a marshmallow. Aside from that it looked undercooked. I told the cashier about my concerns and she said and I quote &#34; I will tell the kitchen to cook it longer&#34; so basically she knows that they are not cooking that steak for long enough. Felt sick the next day. Terrible service and quality. Cannot recommend this based on my experience.

I feel like whenever I go they are just running out of sauté veggies, or steak, or lettuce, or something... just my luck to get the scraps :( I hate scraps.

To me it&#39;s actually comical how much you can tell that the people working there do not want to be there at all. Between how they throw your meal together or lack of smiling, it&#39;s hilarious. Out of all of the times I&#39;ve been there, only a handful of times was someone there taking my order with a smile on their face.

I have never eaten inside the restaurant, because there&#39;s too much loud music and way too many hard surfaces.  I find this a major downside.  However, the restaurant is clean, attractive and bright.

I have found the service to be fast, friendly and reliable, although my tendency is to watch the preparers closely.  Everything looks fresh. My consistent bottom line for Chipotle is that everything is fresh.  However, the net effect, when all those food components are all glopped together in that bowl is that the sum is MUCH less than the parts.  That&#39;s why I might only allow it into my diet once every month or two.  I don&#39;t think that they should charge extra for guacamole.  Suck it up, Chipotle!

I know people that eat their Chipotle favorites several times a week and mainly out of convenience.  I couldn&#39;t do that, but it&#39;s probably a step above the other fast food options.

I stopped in with my mom and grandma to pick up some lunch to go. There was about four people in line ahead of us, but we actually showed up just in time because about a minute later the line was flowing out the door.

The employees working the assembly line were frantic and sloppy. Sure, it was busy, but the way they were flinging food was ridiculous. I felt bad for the woman in front of me who had questions about the kids meal options. They were not explaining things well at all and kept rushing her along. Customer service really went out the window.

Needless to say it was uncomfortable for everyone. The food was good and what I would expect from Chipotle, however my chicken burrito bowl wasn&#39;t made exactly how I like. I usually ask for just a little hot sauce and a tad sour cream, but because I was rushed and food was flying, they globbed &#39;em both on pretty heavy.

Disappointing. I think I&#39;ll stick to the Chipotle on Route 59."

The restaurant was reasonably busy but the staff was welcoming and friendly.  I asked for white rice without cilantro and they happily went in back to get me some.  I appreciate that.  The order was assembled quickly and was rung up correctly.  The seating area was clean and there were plenty of napkins, straws, utensils and a small assortment of hot sauce.  The food orders were warm and tasted great!  My family enjoyed a good meal and we will definitely be back again."

He approached while we enjoyed our lunch outside. He simply asked &#34;What can we do better?&#34; I thought it was really neat how genuine he wanted to know.

We have chipotle a few times a week and love the quality that they deliver. The only negative would be two of the cashiers that are not the most friendly ladies out there. When Chipotle sent out the free coupons one of the ladies rolled her eyes and said &#34;another free one&#34;, although I purchase food there all the time. But alas, it is about the food for me since it is a fast food restaurant."

The person (white young guy, a bit overweight) that placed the last ingredients into my burrito, surprisingly used a counter top rag to wipe the INSIDE PART OF THE FOIL WRAPPER before wrapping my burrito. I saw it and repeatedly asked him why he did that.  He denied it and said he used a napkin. My friend next to me ALSO saw it and confirmed it too!! After leaving Chipotle I called them asking for the manager.  They gave me a person named Kirin. Kirin said I misinterpreted what I saw, but I know I saw a rag, NOT a paper napkin being used.  So, she continued to deny it.  I knew this was going nowhere. So, later in the week I spoke to the store manager, Juan.  He thanked me for the feedback and said he would look into it. I don&#39;t know if something was really done about it.  Anyway, if there is anything that you want to take away from this review, it should be that you carefully watch the people that are assembling your food.  THEY SHOULDN&#39;T BE PUTTING YOU AT RISK FOR AN ILLNESS FROM IMPROPER FOOD HANDLING, LIKE USING A RAG TO WIPE THE INSIDE FOIL WRAPPER OF YOUR BURRITO."

Ordered ahead, wasn&#39;t ready when I arrived. When I got there, they started making right away.  I noticed they were doing it incorrectly so I pointed it out. They fixed it. Once the food was assembled (4 meals in total), they bagged it up and handed it to me. My my order incomplete. It was missing FOUR items. When I told the employee, she proceeded to make another guests order. I stood and waited and basically had to beg to be helped. After that, they still questioned my order and finally another employee said &#34;just give it to her,&#34; which made me feel like they thought I was lying???  I had ordered two kid meals...they only gave me one drink and one side.  Should have been two. Also, I ordered a salad and wasn&#39;t given dressing. So when I noticed, I went back and asked for it and they told me they were out of dressing. It would have been nice to know before they made the SALAD. The best part of that salad is the dressing, imo.  Finally I left without the dressing or any sort of apology.  Coming off the bad rap recently from all of the food born illnesses (chipotle in general), you&#39;d think they would make an effort to step up their customer service game.  Worst part, food was basically cold by the time I got home after all the nonsense back and forth."

Trust me when I say the drive to the one more north on 59 by Meijer or the one in Bolingbrook is worth it!

Food: The same as every chipotle you&#39;ve been to, but for some odd reason they always manage to screw something up... Rice isn&#39;t cooked well enough, chicken is not seasoned well and tastes horrible, guacamole tastes like nothing. One time I got a burrito and couldn&#39;t finish it because it was bad.

Service: Others have already mentioned this before, but the service is laughably slow. The lines aren&#39;t even THAT long maybe 10-15 people. Every other Chipotle I&#39;ve been to could easily handle twice the crowd in the same amount of time. Severe lack of communication between employees on the line leads to a lot of wasted time. The employees look confused and just as annoyed as the customers are. I think the root of this is that they keep hiring braindead high school/college students leading to high turnover. Every time I go in there is an entirely new fleet of staff. Portion controls are abysmal (I have to ask for DOUBLE everything to get a semblance of a burrito I could get at any other Chipotle.)

Store: Minimal seating, but I guess that&#39;s the bullshit feng shui ambiance Chipotle goes for... I would not plan to dine in here during lunch or dinner as I doubt there&#39;d be seating.

I am convinced the only thing keeping this abomination open is the fact that it has a location convenient enough that southside Naperville families are willing to give up a good Chipotle experience for convenience. Do yourself a favor and drive to a different Chipotle."

I can only guess it&#39;s due to the popular location, or perhaps it&#39;s the slow service? Either way, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a profitable spot. The first few times I came here, hubby&#39;s burrito fell apart or ripped and grease went everywhere. It&#39;s getting better, and the people are very friendly, but until there&#39;s a consistent speedy turnaround, I won&#39;t be updating this review.

At this time, in a rude tone, the woman says &#34;well I didn&#39;t charge you for that&#34; as she sticks her hand out for my card. I would have no problem paying for the guac as I intended to, but this is the cashier&#39;s error. She wanted to charge the card before my order was ready because the line was very long. Customer service and work ethic at this location are horrendous. I recommend you drive the extra 10 minutes to get a good chipotle experience."

The broth was aromatic and flavorful, the noodles had the right consistency, and the combination of tendon, tripe, beef balls and flank was pretty amazing. I will say the flank was a bit overdone and could&#39;ve been thinner/rarer, but it was still delicious.

I can&#39;t comment on the service - I came in at 5pm on a Tuesday and I&#39;m the only customer here (I&#39;m literally still here, because I ordered a banh mi sandwich to go). I am DEFINITELY coming back here again though, and as much as I love pho, I might need to try some of the other dishes here as I&#39;m sure they&#39;re just as amazing."

I think my review which was a 1st visit may have come on a night (5pm) the kitchen was having an off-day. I think we should have ordered some kind of Pho. Because the other entrees weren&#39;t very good. Mom had shrimp skewer over sliced pork over vermicelli.  Noodles were dry and hard to cut, shrimp tough,  pork very tough even tho I soaked it in my broth for her. Dad had overcooked eggplant. I had chicken, pineapple and veggie fried rice that was just OK. 

Service seemed disinterested and overly busy. When we arrived we were one of 2 families there. Quiet and pleasant. But the noise level went through the roof as the place filled up. The wooden chairs on a wooden floor didnt help. My parents have hearing aides and werent able to hear well though the din. The decor was interesting though!

Our server was cute and friendly, helped us through the menu and made good recommendations. The restaurant was busy but we got seated right away. We ordered Muc rang muoi (calamari was okay) and cha gio (spring rolls were yummy) for appetizer. Pho tai nam gau, green basil com chien (w/o pork) and tom ram man as the main course.

The first time, we came when it was less busy and with a smaller party, and the service was spectacular. However, the second time I went, the restaurant was more crowded and I had a party of about twelve people, and the service was very spotty. We kept having to request for more of this or that, food came out slow, water was not filled, and even the waitress was a bit rude/standoffish towards us.

Service aside, this place has really yummy Vietnamese curry and coffee (Cafe Su Da). Their pho is okay, I thought the broth could have been a bit hotter (in temperature). 

The decor is very Vietnamese oriented with little trinkets and sculptures relating to Vietnamese cultures. The place is a bit hard to find because it looks like a house and the entrance towards it was a one way street so you have to go further down and enter through the bank parking lot and loop around...

This is a good option if you live in the west burbs and are craving Viet food and too lazy to drive to Argyle."

Came here the day after Halloween for a hangover cure since our go to closed down. We ordered the pho, Vietnamese ice coffee with condensed milk, and calamari.

Calamari 4/5 stars. The calamari was a nice texture and lightly fried. The flavor was nice and not too greasy. For $12 it was a very skimpy portion which would prevent me from ordering this again.

Pho: 3/5 the beef was tender and flavorful but the broth lacked the depth of flavor I&#39;m looking for in a nice bowl of steaming pho. It was sweeter than normal and tasted as if it could stand to simmer another 5 hours. The flavor was lighter and left me wanting for more. The portion was okay but not worth $10.

Iced Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk: 3/5 it lacked the complexity of flavor I look for in Vietnamese coffee but it was strong and sweet. It does the job but I wouldn&#39;t order it again.

Ambiance: 2.5/5 stars. The decor is nice but I watched the hostess seat a family at a table that had an extremely dirty floor. The chairs are hard and uncomfortable and the layout is a little strange. 

Service 2/5 stars. Typical non attentive Vietnamese service but it came from nonvietnamese servers. The dirty dishes stayed on our table the entire duration of the meal. They forgot our ice coffee and didn&#39;t check up on us at all. We had to flag then down for the check a box. For these prices, a little more attentiveness would be nice.

Overall, I don&#39;t think the ambiance justifies the exorbitant price since the service was extremely lacking. I&#39;d only go here this place for when I&#39;m desperate and not willing to drive to Argyle."
green-basil-naperville,Carolyn C.,bhUfla5vicMBER5VBilwBg,"Glen Ellyn, IL",0,1,0,0,71,A2dVVV08EumGFpYiIbjdsQ,1.0,2016-07-19,"I&#39;ve been biting my tongue about this place for the longest time. I created my Yelp to SPECIFICALLY leave a comment about this restaurant (And I leave really good reviews for plenty of places). Every time I try to give this place a second chance, it&#39;s ruined by the service. Here is what I want to say:

IT SEEMS as if (does not mean it is one hundred percent true, just in my experiences) you are young, and do not look rich, the servers will make you less of a priority than those who do. The service is straight up bad. 

I used to be a LOYAL customer to this place. And by loyal, I mean I went here every single week, and I tipped over 20% every single time. The servers recognized me and my friend. Both of us attended North Central College. We are college students, we are young. I used to serve and I know how difficult it can be. It&#39;s hard. I get it. A lot of people don&#39;t tip good. So I would always tip over 20%.

Let me start off by saying the food here is TO DIE FOR. It&#39;s by far the best Vietnamese food I&#39;ve had period. This is why we went here all the time. 

This is where things get bad. I started to notice the service getting worse. For some ungodly reason, this place closes for like, 3 hours in the middle of the day. If you come an hour before they close, they are SUPER rude. I get that it is frustrating, but 1. You shouldn&#39;t close your restaurant in the middle of the day, and 2. You don&#39;t show your customers you are irritated. I worked at a TGI Fridays and people would come in  MINUTES before closing and it is STILL your obligation to serve them. This business does not uphold that standard.

But alas, it gets worse. One day, my boyfriend and I ordered for pickup about an hour before they closed in the middle of the day. We noticed that the charge was 10$ for something that is normally 8$. That was really sketchy and we didn&#39;t realize it until later. Even then, we tipped and went on our way. Be careful when ordering for pickup.

We still continued to go here until we gave them their last chance. They take FOREVER to get you water at this place if you run out. This is a consistent thing, not a one time thing. So my boyfriend and I were asking our server to get us water, and in the middle of asking her, an older, richer looking woman asked for something at a table by us. Our server DROPPED WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT to rush to the other guest. Little things like this happened CONSTANTLY, and it just became too much to continue going there. Also, in the same visit, the girl fought with her coworker on their ear pieces IN FRONT OF US and during our conversation. I mean like, yelling through the earpiece. It was a mess.

It really sucks because the food is good. It costs more than normal Vietnamese places, but the quality is better. Too bad the service is the worst I have ever had anywhere, because I would continue to go here.

I get that young people don&#39;t always tip. However, assuming this is discrimination based on age. I always tip 20% or more when my service is okay.  Sometimes I tip 20% even when the service is kind of bad just to disprove this stereotype. When you are a regular who consistently does this, it is IRRITATING when the employees blatantly lack on your service, while working hard for other customers. I will never eat here again.

A better option is Noodles Pho U, which is also in Naperville. 100% better service and more options on the menu. The food isn&#39;t as quality, but it is still really good."

The owner is obviously apathetic to the majority of the reviews that highlight the absolute poor service of this restaurant. Their lack of action and minus zero star service implicitly and explicitly communicates a manipulative assumption of support from a small core group of people who come back for a type of cuisine they can&#39;t get locally anywhere else--irrespective of how they&#39;re treated.

The waitress was very kind. When I said &#34;thank you&#34;, she said &#34;You&#39;re very welcome&#34; in the most soothing voice ever. 

Ordered Com Suon Nuong which is a rice dish with grilled pork chops, lettuce, cucumbers, and tomatoes on the side with a price tag of $10.50. While it is not the most authentic I&#39;ve tasted in Vietnamese restaurants in the Chicago suburbs, it was still enjoyable to eat. The portion was just enough for me. Unfortunately, there were no doggy bags to take home.

They also try to rush you into ordering. Yeah you have like 20 things on the menu but I still need some time to think and settle in before I decide. There&#39;s one lady there who&#39;s older with glasses and she really pissed me off because she gave me attitude and just rushed me when I didn&#39;t even know what to order. She just stood there while I was trying to decide what to eat. Vermicelli was pretty good but the pork is really dry. Pho is pretty good too best Asian food I had while here in Chicago.

And it was a throw-away, tenuous tissue filler similar to eating cartilage. Not good. I ordered the 402 - Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio. Things were going good...until I turned over a side of the rice noodles in the dish and a dark hair was tangled up within the noodles. I wanted to take the blame, but my hair was pulled back into a ponytail. And it didn&#39;t look like mine. It was too dark. The server apologized &amp; said if we came back, we could order the 302 without the tripe. We both said at the same time, &#34;We did.&#34; The girl who took our order got it wrong. The guy who settled up our bill was very apologetic. I really wanted to like this place, but I&#39;m not hungry for hair anytime soon."

Historically speaking, I loooove rice bowl/boxes and was totally spoiled in NY when I had a hard time deciding which vietnamese / banh mi place I liked best.

So I &#39;spose my expectations are high. I&#39;ve tried the rice bowl here a few times, hoping that maybe it was just an off day in the kitchen. Sadly, the predominant memories of my meals here are of very dry/overcooked pork, too-heavy-on-the-fish sauce vietnamese vinaigrette, and a shocking amount of bean sprouts. It&#39;s also kind of pricey for what you get.

However, their Vietnamese Iced Coffee is VERY delicious, and they have great service. Maybe I&#39;ll try the sandwiches or pho and report back."

The soup here is light yet flavorful and the meat tender. The bowl is quite large, but for the price I still think it&#39;s a little over priced. The portion of meat to noodle is definitely not right. There needs to be more meat for a $10 of noodle. 

The piece here is actually a little overpriced. If you get an appetizer and a bowl of pho; it will run you about $20. 

One of the main reason I come here is the Ban Xia. It&#39;s a batter crepe with bean sprouts, shrimp and pork fried in a pan until they&#39;re super crispy. You eat it in a lettuce wrap and dip it in fish sauce. So fatty yet so good. 

I definitely would come here again to satisfy my craving since there&#39;s no other choices in the burb to her pho&#39;s like the one in California.

Easy parking which is the least important part of this review haha.

But they well put together; they came with a great peanut sauce that had a slight undertone of chili. I ordered the Phó which was light, aromatic and delicious (most of the reason for the 4 stars) my friend is a vegan and ordered a fried rice with tofu; I thought the dish was bland and heavy a tad too greasy for me. She liked it though. Another highlight of the meal was the Vietnamese coffee!!!! Omgness it was so strong and rich, not at all bitter. They steep it on the table for you.

She was kind enough to stop and tell us about Green Basil, and also informed us about the noodle dish she preferred. 
My first visit was with my husband and niece about a week later.  They tried a beef noodle soup.  My husband likes a little heat, and tried mixing some spicy sauce from the table with it, while my little niece was in noodle heaven.  I had fried calamari which was outstanding.
The second time I took my friend and we tried a bunch of appetizers.  I loved the chicken wings, but was disappointed with the spring rolls.  They were just average.

It had so much flavor.  When you eat the pho ga, you need to add sauce for additional flavor/spice.  Service was slow when we were done and we didn&#39;t get a refill on our water.  I think they got busy and didn&#39;t have enough help to cover everyone.  The server was very nice and helped us navigate the menu to decide what to order.  It was plenty of food for two and we had leftovers."

I typically frequent Argyle so I arrived without expectations. Four of us came dined in on a Sunday afternoon and we shared an order of cha gio, bun thit nuong, banh xeo, and bun bo hue. 

In English terms, the cha gio is a plate with four pieces of egg rolls with shrimp, water chestnut, carrot, and glass noodle. There is a side of fish sauce for dipping. Each bite was welcomed with a crisp and the ingredients were very refreshing. The bun thit nuong is rice vermicelli with pork tenderloin, lettuce, bean sprout, mint, roasted peanuts and fish sauce. Whenever I order vermicelli at other places, they are usually too dry. Green Basil does it just right with very juicy and well-grilled tenderloin. It is served cold so I would highly suggest having this on a summer day. The bun bo hue is much more winter-friendly because it is a bowl of traditional spicy beef noodles soup with pork shank and pork pate. It is mildly spicy without killing too many of your tastes buds. I could easily have this whole bowl to myself without sharing. But the star of the afternoon would definitely go to the banh xeo which is Vietnamese crepes with crispy rice, shrimp, pork, bean sprouts, mint leaves, basil, and lime fish sauce. It takes a bit longer to prepare but your time will be well-spent. The portion is huge and the batter is perfect. Just listen to the slight cracking sound as you cut into the crepe. You won&#39;t find that elsewhere! 

This is a rarity that I will make an effort to revisit!"

I come to Naperville on business often and always looking for an ethnic flare instead of the chain restaurants near my hotel. 

This place is cute.  Located downtown, the area is nice with many stores in walking distance.   The service was good and the decor was above average for a Viet place.  

I ordered the spring rolls which at 4.50 were very very tasty.  The wrappers were tight and cheery and full of shrimp and meat. The peanut sauce was a little bland but I enjoyed the fact that it is served warm.  You can add aittle of the the hoisin sauce for more flavor.  

Instead of getting pho, which I heard was bland, I got the bun bo hue. Spicy beef noodle soup.  This is a delicacy in many parts of this country as a good bowl is hard to come by.  The bowl was big but mostly full of broth.  The noodles to broth ratio was odds   Very little noodle and meat to lots of broth.  That won&#39;t be such a bad thing except the broth was bland.  It lacks the essence of bun Bo hue, the lemongrass and shrimp paste flavor.   The meat was tensor but small bits and hey we&#39;re missing the quintessential herb, rau ram, which is required for this dish.  

Overall the the western palate, this place will suffice.  For the Asian and ethnically inclined, I say get the rice dishes because the soups are lacking in my book."

Coming from the busy, bustling, city, hectic, fend-for-yourself lifestyle of Viet-town Chicago, it was strange to see calm, open seating in a small clean Vietnamese restaurant in downtown Naperville. While the change of pace is nice, the main reason I constantly return is because of the fantastic food. 

I usually start off with a Vietnamese Coffee, which is both strong in coffee and strong in condense milk, providing a huge kick start to the meal. It&#39;s delicious, but sometimes a little too sweet for me (but the ice and addition of a bit of water helps). 

I have tried to sample a bit of everything on the menu, here&#39;s my favorites. 

Appetizers - 
While traditionally people usually go to the Goi Cuan (rice paper spring rolls), I usually go with the Cha Gio (fried variety). While the Goi Cuan is not bad, it really doesn&#39;t stand out from the other Vietnamese experiences I&#39;ve had. However, the Cha Gio really seems to outshine the Goi Cuan. The crispy of the skin combined with savory shrimp inside all wrapped in a lettuce/pickled veggies dipped in a fantastically tangy fish sauce  really makes me savor at the thought of it. The fried spring rolls come pipping hot, and  really get the meal started off right. 

Noodles -
I love pho, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of pho here. Once again, not because the pho is bad, it&#39;s more because the pho is slightly average comparably to Viet-town. However, the Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef soup) is really special. The many different varieties of meat soak in the spicy broth as they bring out a plate of special veggies that really provide it a nice crunch. The broth is different and delicious, while the noodles also have a different texture from pho. The noodles in this dish are slightly thicker and a bit chewier. The beef shank usually is really flavorful and slightly fatty (almost melts in your mouth). After having this once, I never went back to the pho. 

Rice Vermicelli - 
I haven&#39;t tried too many of the rice vermicelli dishes, but I did try the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (pork chop vermicelli). The pork chop was tender and flavorful, seasoned nicely to compliment the star of the dish, fish sauce. The fish sauce carries the rest of the dish to glory as it ties in the vermicelli, the pork, the pickled veggies, and peanuts. While I don&#39;t order it often, it&#39;s definitely a treat when I do. 

Star of the show - Bahn Xeo 
So the main reason I come to Green Basil is the fantastic Bahn Xeo (Vietnamese pancake). It is seriously the best I&#39;ve had anywhere. The batter is cooked to a beautiful crisp to perfectly compliment lettuce and pickled veggies. There is a generous in the pork and shrimp pieces inside the pancake, and the house fish sauce really gives it that great tangy balance. This is by far my favorite dish. 

Overall, the experience isn&#39;t flawless, but it has quickly become a regular weekend lunch spot for me. The service can be hit or miss, the classic food selections (pho, Goi Cuan) can turn out average. But if you explore a bit into the menu, you can really stumble upon a memorable experience that you will want to revisit time and time again."

The pho soup has the distinctive scent of freshness and you can feel that it has been on the stove for long hours. I have tried the soup at several other places and I can easily tell if the soup is truly from bones or simply from bone powder. This place is truly from bones and the soup was on the stove for HOURS!

After comparing the beef pho with another Viet Pho place I went to recently, I decided that Green Basil should receive credit for the flavorful beef pho they have. The beef broth here is very good, full of flavor and aroma. And by the time you finish your rice noodle, the broth is still very tasty instead of tasting like water in some other places. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that they forgot the sandwich I ordered and I ended up cancelling it."

We ended up waiting quite a while for someone to take our order. We soon figured out why...the staff were busy eating their dinner! Other tables were finishing up and a lot of tables hadn&#39;t been bussed yet. After everyone else left they decided to noisily bus the tables while we were eating.

He said everything we ordered was right on course.

OK - bear with me as I can&#39;t recall the actual Vietnamese names of what I enjoyed, but I&#39;ll tell you I ordered a 101 and a 403. The 101 is essentially your standard spring roll thing with a pretty decent peanut sauce. The 403 was Vietnamese Fried Rice and was also pretty good - a bountiful order as well. In addition to that I also enjoyed their chicken wings (a &#34;1 - oh - something&#34;) that were really more like drumettes. Believe me, no chicken could have ever flown with what was served to us. Those too, hit the spot.

I did observe some service issues at other tables while I was waiting for my friends to come, but our service was spot on.

While I&#39;m not normally a proponent of tofu, I have nothing but rave reviews about the tau hu xao.  It isn&#39;t soggy (which is my chief complaint about tofu dishes) and the way the flavors meld together is divine.  The bahn mi&#39;s are nothing short of fantastic (especially the pork belly, can&#39;t get enough of it) and have just enough spice and sweet to please the palate. My only slight bit of disappointment was that the sticky wings were on the dry side, but the sauce itself was great.  As far as pho goes, we have tried almost all of them and you really can&#39;t go wrong.

I told him how disgusted I was feeling and to which he responded &#34;mistakes happen&#34;.  The worst part is he was NOT AT ALL apologetic and didn&#39;t even try to understand my sentiment.

I know my Vietnamese food and I can tell you that this place is the best you can find in the area. I don&#39;t know if this can beat the ones in the city, but it&#39;s definitely the best of the burbs. The sticky wings are to die for and one of the best wings I&#39;ve ever had. The fried egg rolls are always hot, fresh, crispy and delicious. The pho broth is rich and the noodles are never over-cooked and the meats are always tender and amazing. In my experience, Vietnamese places aren&#39;t very strong in the decoration sector but Green Basil is an exception. The place looks like a home from the inside out and is so warming, which is a bonus. Overall, if you want a nice place in Downtown Naperville to have some great Vietnamese food, this place should be, without a doubt, your go-to (and mine)."

And....it was good pho!I would even go as far to say that it&#39;s the best that I&#39;ve had in the area, except for Hue Palace in Joliet. Yeah, Joliet.

The broth was pretty decent, and the meat was the best quality of any suburban pho I&#39;ve had so far. Yes, I said &#34;suburban pho&#34;. I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve had &#34;city pho&#34;, so that means nothing. 

But yes, if I had three thumbs, I&#39;d give it three thumbs up. We also got a chicken wings appetizer, which was pretty good! They were deep fried and came with a dipping sauce full of bits and goodies. We also got this awesome pork chop topped with a fried egg. It tasted delicious like a unicorn and I would eat it again and again. 

In terms of ambience, this place was ok. It&#39;s located in the Jefferson Hill Shops, which kind of gives it a haunted house vibe. Spookies! Not that it&#39;s old and crusty, it&#39;s actually very clean and updated. 

Also, the waiters wear like these little bluetooth ear things. Awesome! I felt like I was talking to a stock broker on the go: buy, sell, buy, sell, you&#39;re fired!"

I actually came here several months ago but haven&#39;t gotten a chance to write up my review. I came here on a busy day, granted that, but when you&#39;re most busy and when it&#39;s most chaotic is when service is most important! 

While their food is A-Okay, it is nothing to leave you dreaming for. I&#39;m Vietnamese and personally, the food here is not as authentic as some of the places in Argyle. Although, they have fresh ingredients, I&#39;m not so sure that a 40 minute wait for appetizer and over 1 hour wait for entree &#34;pho soups&#34; are worth it. On top of that, the beef salad I had ordered, (I swear) came out raw! I had to dip my raw beef into my HOT boiling soup entree to try to cook it myself! 

I would have told someone but being that it already took me an hour to get my food, I didn&#39;t want to bother with another complaint to see if they will even address it. Overall my impression of this place? I just remember coming here, sitting for a really long time to wait for my food, and whenever we wanted to check in to see how much longer it will take, our waitress acted like she could careless. In fact, her tone was condescending a bit with a reply with something that was along the lines of &#34;we&#39;re very busy as you can see&#34; (yes I can see) and &#34;I don&#39;t know when your food will come out but it will be out (really, that&#39;s the best thing you can tell me?!).  She didn&#39;t apologize for the wait, and she did not try to tell me if it would be another 5 minute or 45 minutes! If I wasn&#39;t with a group of people that day, I would have walked myself out of there. 

Honestly, a customer&#39;s experience in a food place can be of two things: 1) they remember how great the food was or 2) they remember how bad the service was. Sometimes if you&#39;re lucky, they&#39;ll remember 3) that both food AND service was phenomenal. 

This place falls in category #2: unsympathetic service. On top of that, their food is nothing to rave about. In my opinion, the price here is high, the food is overrated because it&#39;s by downtown Naperville. It needs a lot more of a personal touch and better prices to push this place back up on my list!"

First impression, fresh abundance of vegetables and a good wholesome bowl.  Nice hot broth that isn&#39;t overwhelmed with MSG. Nice! I like this place already.

Second impression, where&#39;s my che ba mau? I&#39;m done with my pho before it is brought out after I had asked about it halfway through my bowl.

Third impression, THIS is a che ba mau?? This cocktail cup with what looks like the right ingredients for che ba mau but has a funny/weird aftertaste? I don&#39;t really treat che ma bau as a dessert, it&#39;s more of a drink to me so if it came in a tall glass beer mug, I&#39;m cool with it. I almost expect for it. The cup is frivolous with a long spoon out of it.  It looks like the $3-4 che ba mau is more for looks and not for the actual che ma bau content.

Fourth impression, why is it taking so long to get the check?

I don&#39;t know. It has the ingredients of a pho restaurant but it&#39;s not an authentic Vietnamese pho restaurant. I feel like it&#39;s a diluted or twilight zone version of a Vietnamese pho restaurant that is trying to reach to the level of an American-style restaurant with pretty decor, fancy drink cocktail glasses, and folded paper napkins. There&#39;s just a lot of things here and there that are just off and doesn&#39;t sell it to me.  

The bowl of pho was pretty ok though, but nothing to rave everything about."

The service is poor, and rude too. And how do you expect someone to understand you repeating your order if you say just the numbers ? I ordered by name, I want to hear it back by its name. And the food tastes different each time.

It was my first time. I&#39;m always on the look out for new restaurants so when this place sneaked onto the Naperville scene, I was surprised. It has gained word of mouth for one reason alone...the food. 

Nothing about the rest of our experience here was worth returning for. Upon entering the lobby area, you&#39;re staring at a disorganized service station that could easily (and should) be disguised or be made less unsightly. The rest of the place is small and plain. A little paint for color would liven it up a lot.

We didn&#39;t have to wait very long for a table, although the small restaurant was full when we arrived. The waitress was maybe 19 or 20 and absolutely clueless. I asked her about two things on the menu to which the response was &#34;um, they&#39;re different&#34;. Yeah, okay, that&#39;s helpful sweetie. 

I had brought two beers with me (BYOB, score! 50 cents to open each, $5 cork fee for wine) and after ordering she brought both to the table and acted confused to why I didn&#39;t want them at the same time. Strike two. There is an obvious lack of experience or training of the wait staff here. 

The whole front of the house staff was under 21 (best guess) and every single one of them, including the eldest male who seemed semi-in-charge moved like molasses and had blank looks on their faces. I&#39;m not kidding, we sat for about thirty minutes with FIVE empty tables around us covered in dirty dishes. Every one of these kids wandered by them numerous times without clearing a plate. We noticed what seemed to be a busser appear toward the end of our meal who began to clear tables. So annoying. If I were the owner I would be irate -- I mean, new diners had to walk in and by all those dirty tables!

Okay, on to the positives...the eggroll appetizer was good. Fresh and crispy with a more interesting sauce than the typical sweet and sour. 

I had the beef pho, very good once doctored with some basil, soy and lime juice. Huge portion! I took half of it home -- oh while I&#39;m on that subject, they bring you a container for it. I&#39;m not exactly sure how one manages to transfer the pho to this provided container, but luckily my friend held it over her empty bowl and didn&#39;t spill much. It would be nice if they offered to do such a task in the kitchen where spillage would be more avoidable.

My friend let me try her chicken curry which was awesome. The meat was incredibly tender. 

One other thing I&#39;ll mention is that the food does take a little longer than one might expect, we decided that it must be because the chef does most of what happens in the kitchen (which is great!)

It would be in their best interest to train their servers to set that expectation to guests: &#34;Our chef personally handles each dish in the kitchen so your food may take slightly longer than you might expect in other establishments...blah blah&#34;

I really hope the owners read these because they need to see a pattern in the reviews....

YOUR FOOD IS GOOD, PEOPLE LIKE IT.

YOUR SERVICE SUCKS, TRAIN YOUR STAFF.

Think of Naperville as the Black Widow of restaurants...if everything isn&#39;t on par, you&#39;ll be eaten alive. Food, Service, Ambiance, Cost. Strike the balance quickly or poor word of mouth or the next food establishment will knock you off the playing field before you&#39;ve served your last pho."

It&#39;s a cute, off the beaten path Thai restaurant that has more charm than pretty much everything else in downtown Naperville. It&#39;s basically in a living room and offers up something different in terms of ambiance and food. How could you go wrong?

I can&#39;t really put my finger on it. The service was ok. The food was ok. The wait was ok. Everything was just...ok. The Goi Cuon was a good start (spring roll with shrimp and pork), followed by Green Basil Com Chien (their fried rice with shrimp, chicken, pork, pineapple, lot of veggies) and Ca Ri Ga (yellow curry chicken). I liked it all. Maybe I just needed to order something new and different. These are standard things that we tend to order when we go out for asian food. So I don&#39;t know. The service was definitely on the slow side, even though everyone was nice. I just don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back. I can order these similar items at a Chinese take out and get the same effect."

Quality of ingredients and skill of execution was more than abundant with all the dishes my group ordered. My bo la lot was made with actual la lot leaves (not grape leaves, like some places substitute -- which is fine, but just to state). BYOB corkage fee is currently $5, which is totally reasonable -- and nice since Tasting deVine is right up the street *nudge, nudge*. 

Service: good, but a little flustered. Example: one person at our table ordered a big bowl of soup, but the server had to be flagged down a little later in order to get a spoon. We also had to ask a couple of times for them to cork our bottle and bring us some wine glasses. We went early on a Saturday night, before the place got really busy. 

Location: If you can get someone else to drive or you&#39;re within walking distance, this is a fantastic place to have some legit Vietnamese food. Prices are completely reasonable for the quality, quantity, and execution of the food that you get. If you tend to get nervous about driving/parking in congested areas, keep that in mind if you go -- this place IS located in downtown Naperville."

The food is right up there with other great Vietnamese restaurants in Chicago&#39;s Uptown and Rogers Park.  Chef / Owner Nick Nguyen, former head chef at Sawtooth in Chicago (Michelin Guide recommended), has finally brought a worthy taste of Vietnam to the Southwest suburbs of Chicago, where authentic Vietnamese can be hard to find.  Of the 13 or so restaurants serving Vietnamese dishes in the Naperville area, only 2 are completely Vietnamese; the rest are fusion.  This is by far the best choice of them all.

I like the fact that it&#39;s tucked away from the noisy and often congested part of Downtown Naperville because it adds to its quaint and cozy vibe.  Even though it&#39;s a little bit pricier than Chicago prices and is BYOB, I still give it a 5 stars because it saves me a trip to Chicago to get great Vietnamese food.  

If you end up appreciating the food here, please try learning the names of your favorite dishes and stop calling them by the numbers .  Even the most feeble attempt to pronounce the Vietnamese name of a dish shows your appreciation for the food and the culture it represents.

The dinner services was super slow and it took a while before a server came over to take my spouse and mine order. 

Not to mention, I feel like the pricing for the dishes that were listed on the menu were over priced.

The flavor of the dishes are pretty basic. Nothing special other than that they try to make the dish look contemporary.

I walked in with my family around 7:50pm on a Sunday, completely unaware that they close at 8pm. Thankfully, the servers--two adorably dopey teenage boys--didn&#39;t kick us out and said we just have to order quickly and try not to loiter too long. But then one of them went and complained about us coming in late to another table. Teenagers...

We got our order in right away and the food came out fairly quickly. The aroma of delicious pho immediately enters your nostrils but you will probably have to flag down the same dopey server to get some spoons before you can devour it and lick the bowl clean. I also tried the pork belly bahn mi sandwich. Fatty cuts of meat on perfectly baked bread? Gluttonous YUM. and BYOB! Prices are very reasonable also-- about $9 for a sizable bowl of pho and $5 for bahn mi.

Especially now that the weather is getting nicer, come for a comforting meal and then you get the option of walking it off in Downtown Naperville or collapsing at home in a food coma. It&#39;s a win/win/win situation."

First the bad. The service there is highly questionable. It was obvious that the girl did not want to be there. Although we arrived before two other tables, they were served before us (drinks and orders). The waitress (possibly a bus girl) was very very rude. She rolled her eyes when we asked for clean silverware.  We tried to get her attention multiple times, but she was insistent on ignoring us. We asked for fish sauce for our pho, and she brought the wrong one (rolled her eyes once again as if it was our fault). Luckily the nice Asian girl upfront took over to save our experience. Such horrible service for such a nice town.

Now the good. Pho tai (beef noodle soup) was rich in flavor. The goi gun (summer rolls) were tasty. The crispy egg rolls are highly recommended. Get take out if you&#39;re going to eat at this place."

The customer service here is great. They are friendly, give recommendations and are not overbearing. 

I always order the pho with every imaginable cut of meat in it, and spring rolls. Both did a great job. I love the aroma of hot pho, it may just be the best hangover food. The noodles are not overly starchy and the broth warms you up almost instantaneously. 

The environment is very relaxed, it feels like you are visiting a friend&#39;s grandma and she wants to feed you everything she can make. It is also very clean and well-lit. 

The only drawback I have of this place is the music. There are times they play heart-wrenching love ballads, and there are times you hear bass-pumping Vietnamese techno, which I am not too entirely big on. Is this place supposed to be a night club as well?!"

It&#39;s an adorable, simple place with wooden floors and white walls.  It seemed like a cozy place to get pho. The waitress/hostess at the front seated me in the back near the window.  It&#39;t not a huge establishment, but I was excited to come by.  

Here&#39;s where trouble began. I was never approached by anyone at my table.  The person who I assumed was my waitress, lifted one finger, while standing by another table, me to signal &#34;one minute&#34; without even looking at me. No smile, just one finger from a distance to signal a minute. Eight more minutes passed and she was serving everyone else around me but no further eye contact.   No one came by to give me water, and I sat there for about 10 minutes without any sort of acknowledgement.  It was clear to me that I was a bother for coming. I got up and left and never got to try the food.  It was really disappointing.  

I will give kudos to the girl who sat me down. She saw me heading towards the door and asked why I was leaving.  I explained  and  she apologized.  But yes, I never got to try their food.  I&#39;m sure it was amazing but I will not be ignored or rudely signaled &#34;one minute.&#34;

I understand restaurants and lunch hours can be busy - my family owned a restaurant in the past so I can relate.  But some friendly customer service feedback, you are never too busy to take 10 seconds, walk over and  say &#34;Hi, it will be another minute or two.  We&#39;re a little busy.&#34; versus just giving someone a &#34;one minute signal across the room.&#34;  Customers will understand.  Ignoring them or just giving less than friendly contact isn&#39;t inviting and can be offensive.  I do not believe I will return."

It&#39;s a nice downtown Naperville location for pho.  It&#39;s also BYOB with a nominal corkage fee for beer or wine.  I didn&#39;t try them but Vietnamese sandwiches can be had for $4.95.  I had the #304 pho bowl for $7.50.  The bowl was quite large, so you get a lot of broth, but the noodles and meat serving size was pretty typical, so it was overall a typical value.  Service was a little slow on a busy weekday lunch hour.  You do get comfortable, cozy dining in a historic building, and a convenient location right across the street from the two story parking garage on east Jefferson."

The service was VERY slow, even though there were almost as many staff as customers!  It took over 25 minutes for a simple appetizer to arrive and our waitress never once came to check on us to see if we needed water or anything else.    One of our dishes was overcooked (shrimp) and stone cold, as if it was done long before the other dish, so they just let it sit there until the second dish was ready.  The table next to us sat piled with dirty dishes for 45 minutes before someone came to clean it up.  This was mid-afternoon on a Saturday, so maybe the REAL staff was not there? 

The restaurant still has the problem of having a messy entryway, as if you&#39;re entering through a sloppy office and pantry area."

I love the fact that they have happy hour from 3-7 and then again from 10-close during the week. 

Decided to sit outside on the patio with 25 minutes of happy hour goodness left. Well it took someone to take our order over 10 minutes. Which, the place wasn&#39;t crazy busy but still. Not even a hi I&#39;ll be right with you.... When she came to take our order she was nice, we were able to squeeze in our happy hour order before the end. The sushi rolls came out pretty quickly, however, the lady who brought out our rolls told us that one was a spicy tuna when it was a spicy yellowtail, so as I am getting my viva las vegas roll and my pineapple cream cheese wontons I kept wondering where my yellowtail roll was. Finally our waitress was like oh that was the first one she put on the table. I said no, she put a spicy tuna first on the table. Our waitress proceeded to have what I took as a mini argument. Either way, we ended up getting the actual spicy tuna, and the yellowtail roll so I could actually eat it (and not my guest across the table.)

The viva las vegas roll was so good I could have ordered another. It is bursting with flavor, sometimes so good you aren&#39;t even aware of what you are eating! A must try. The yellowtail roll was decent, although for the first time I ever had a yellowtail roll without a jalapeno in it was a bit strange, it did have a slice of cucumber which totally detracted from the roll itself. The pineapple cream cheese wonton was quite a delight. I wasn&#39;t sure if the pineapple would be a welcome addition or detract from it, but it was actually a welcome addition to the creamy goodness of the wonton. I also sampled the spicy shrimp roll which was relatively standard. 

Looking forward to trying more of their unique roll creations!"

The last time we ate here we waited 25 minutes for a beer (in a can at that, zero effort was needed) and then 40 minutes for the check to be processed. The time before that I ordered to go and the order didn&#39;t even resemble what I ordered. And when I called they said the kitchen was closed (ten minutes after I left, at 9pm on a Saturday). And just tonight when asked when happy hour was going on, the hostess said &#34;I have no idea&#34;. (Because it&#39;s not like it&#39;s her job to know details of the restaurant she works at). 

Every other Ra location I&#39;ve been to in the last few years has been good experiences, but somehow this one survives despite the staff being the least adequate group of people I&#39;ve ever encountered. 

The sushis good though if you decide to test your fate."

We elected to sit in the bar area on a Friday afternoon at around 4:30.  There were a few folks at the bar and four tables including us.  From what we could tell, two servers were taking care of everyone there.  Our server was less than on top of it so our experience suffered.  It took her a while to come to the table but when she finally did, we ordered our drinks and edamame.  We didn&#39;t get any water for at least 15 minutes and the only reason we finally did was because we repeatedly asked for them.  We were given some excuse about doing things in order but being a former server myself, water is the first thing you deliver when you greet the table, SERVING 101.  

Rather than incessantly going on about how she&#39;d disappear for long periods of time, the food was decent but next time I&#39;m going to make my own sushi at home - the service will be better.

Don&#39;t recommend this place very much.  Maybe sit in the dining room."

Star #1: This location has an outdoor patio for those sunny days and moon tanning nights. The interior has a trendy sushi bar on the right and spacious seated tables within.

Star #2: As an added tip, make reservations using your Open Table app to get dining points and make sure upon approaching the host desk to let them know you made reservation through OT.

Star #3: Their menu has a vast selection of mixed Asian cuisine from sushi to Chinese fare. There are options for raw and cooked alike. 

Star #4: The bar has an eclectic array from sake to mixed drinks. I recommend a cold unfiltered sake to share or the amazing fish bowl for fun.

However, service is almost nonexistent. We came on a Wednesday for lunch, and the place was pretty quiet with only three tables in the lounge area. We opted for the dining area instead of the lounge. We ordered the rockin shrimp, and it came out looking way over fried. My mom refused to eat it. So, I wanted to send it back for a redo. I must have waited for at least 10 minutes with no one passing by. I ended up waving someone down across the restaurant just to ask for my server. My server still took a while to come over. 

She took the shrimp back with no problems. And it&#39;s not that she wasn&#39;t friendly, she just wasn&#39;t around. We ran out of tea, but no one came around to check if we wanted more, and which my mom did. We finished eating, and just sat there for like 15 minutes trying to someone&#39;s attention to get our bill. Again, no one came, so this time I had to call out to the bus boy by the water stand to get my server. When she finally came, the bill was wrong. They charged me twice for the freaking shrimps. Of course our server corrected this, but I hope you can feel my sense of annoyance and frustration with this establishment. My server came back with a coupon for $10 off a $30 purchase on my next visit. I left it there. Unless someone else is paying, it&#39;s very unlikely they will see another penny of mine."

I&#39;ve visited about 3 times since my first review. Their newish Happy Hour menu makes my wallet and my stomach happy. They have about 20 roles on that menu to choose from for a much better price than the original price. They also have some drinks on there as well. They do make a mean cosmopolitan for 5 dollars on the HH menu. They also have their famous Viva Las Vegas role for 7 dollars, and their Rainbow Role for 8. When you&#39;re talking those roles are usually 13, 14 or 15 dollars, I&#39;d say it&#39;s worth the effort to go during Happy Hour. 

My favorite part though...Their RA club! On my half birthday, they sent me a $20 dollar certificate. No real strings attached. No minimum purchase. It was honestly, one of the best birthday related deals I&#39;ve ever gotten. 

So give these guys a try. Yes, they have a young wait staff...So the service isn&#39;t always the best. But I&#39;ve never had too many issues. The drinks are good, the sushi is good, and I always leave satisfied. 

Enjoy!"

Little did we know this would be our last of the evening because nobody ever came by to ask if we wanted another. We ordered 1 special appetizer, another from the menu, and a selection of maki. Expecting a decent pacing from the kitchen, we were shocked at how the items arrived from the kitchen. Our appetizers as well as the 4 rolls we ordered all came out at the exact same time. We were trying to solve a puzzle getting everything to stay on top of the cramped 2-top without something falling over.

If you&#39;re looking for good sushi and you know what it should taste like, I recommend going elsewhere. 
However, if you&#39;re new to sushi and aren&#39;t excited about the idea of consuming raw fish, this isn&#39;t a bad place to start since they have a lot of &#34;easy&#34; rolls filled with cheese and all kinds of things you wouldn&#39;t find in a real sushi restaurant. They also have a lot of other non-sushi entrees. 

If you&#39;re a sushi enthusiast, stay away. Their rolls are poorly constructed and their sashimi can be hit or miss in terms of the cut and freshness. Also, their mixologist or whoever is making drinks needs to step up their game/recipes because their drinks are terrible."

As in bah, this place is just kinda baah. Not terrible, not great just kinda in the middle. Happy hour specials are pretty good, about $6 for a Martini and/or roll. Each night they also have additional weekday specials that range from 2 for 1 rolls or specific rolls that can be even cheaper than the happy hour stuff. 

Sushi - All I can say is that this place is not very original. They seem to have an excess of Krab &#34;salad&#34; stuff that is normally present only in California rolls. It showed up in all of the rolls and was just not that impressive. left me with the impression of just being a filler to avoid any other ingredients. Bland and not exciting at all. 

On the contrary though, the dessert here was amazing. Very tasty and original, the fried exterior was a crispy delight mixed with the chocolate. 

Service was pretty good, the staff were all very attentive and were very helpful. Since we caught all the specials the prices were great.

We drove over to Yorktown mall to dine at Ra.
We got there around 10 and the bar/lounge area was pretty busy. We stood at the door waiting for someone to greet us for way too long. Finally someone seats us and she brings us waters. 
They have happy hour that late at night and some of their rolls are on special. That was very nice, so we ordered a few rolls from that menu and we also ordered their specialty rolls. 
The sushi isn&#39;t bad but it isn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had, this is a chain after all. 
The Ra-llipop stole the show. Cool presentation and it was delicious. It had 3 different kinds of fish if I remember correctly. 
We enjoyed our meal very much. Everything was good but the service was lacking. The girl who sat us was also our server and bar tender. I think they were too busy for the amount of staff they had working.

My bestie didn&#39;t want to drive too close to the city. If it were up to me, I would only eat sushi at sen in oak park. But we came here so let&#39;s move on. 

It&#39;s in the heart of the suburbs at Yorktown mall so you will always find parking. Let me just get to the point:

Is it clean: very
Is parking free: yes
Is it good for groups: yes 
Is there outdoor seating: yes, plenty
Was it nice inside: very much so 
Is there variety in the drink menu: yes
Was the service good: I would say average
Was the sushi good : one of the three I tried were good. I didn&#39;t like the other ones. They tasted like they came out of a box at store or something 

Did you get an appetizer: yes, the lobster roll. The sauce was good but the rolls had too much cream filling. It was not as described. 

The store is very nice and clean and well decorated. This is a chain of restaurants so keep that in mind. It&#39;s a suburb and at the mall so remember that too. It&#39;s not very fresh. The vegetable roll was delicious which was surprising. 

I don&#39;t plan on returning to be honest but it&#39;s nothing against the store. I just don&#39;t like their sushi. Plus I don&#39;t live here anymore. The smaller sushi independently owned and run stores are where it&#39;s at. I think this place fulfills its duty to the area. I&#39;m sure the kiddos love this place. 

I would say 1-2 stars. They deserve at least two because of how clean and well decorated this store is. Maybe even three stars if you pick the right rolls. I just wasn&#39;t lucky with the rolls today."

If you sign up on their website for emails you get a $20 certificate for your half birthday (not to be used with happy hour specials).

This was one of my favorite restaurants. My husband and I planned on getting a to-go order to celebrate our Valentine&#39;s Day instead of dragging our kids with us and ruining other people&#39;s evenings. 

I called to place the order, pressed the correct to-go extension and was transferred to what seemed to be the hostess. The hostess seemed incredibly annoyed when I asked for a to-go order. Maybe it&#39;s because lots of people were waiting to be seated? I can only speculate. While she took my order she kept asking &#34;THE WHAT?&#34; When I listed item names (which I read right off the menu pdf file). Multiple times. Horrible phone and people skills. No manners. She ended up taking my order and said &#34;k. It&#39;ll be ready in 30 mins&#34; and barely gave me enough time to say goodbye. 

Realizing she didn&#39;t repeat my order -- I texted my husband who was already there to double check the order. Unfortunately he didn&#39;t see my message (husbands ;) am  I right?) and when he got home -- we checked the food. Surprise surprise! She forgot an entree. By then it was too late to drive all the way back there and look for parking on Valentine&#39;s Day weekend. We just decided to forget it. Our kids ended up splitting our entree. Date night was cancelled.

This used to be my favorite place. I wish managers would realize if they choose people who completely lack any personal skills as the first impression their clients get, they won&#39;t have returning customers. This experience was enough to make me not even bother going back. I probably won&#39;t be returning."

One of my friends ordered the chicken Katsu, but the order did not come with rice. Most places that I have been to usually include rice in the order, but I guess this place does not.

Their rolls are definitely generous with size of their rolls, and they&#39;re priced accordingly. The biggest issue I have with most sushi places is I leave hungry cause I don&#39;t want to spend a small fortune for a satisfying meal. At RA, my gf and I split 4 rolls and we left satisfied!! 

They have great presentation, and their rolls and sauces were delicious!!

Our server, Alyssa, was amazing!! She was constantly checking up on us, making sure our drinks were full. When she dropped off the check, she said &#34;there is absolutely no rush, take your time and enjoy.&#34; We were there on a very busy Friday night. For her to reassure use that we could just stay an chill, instead of trying to turn the table, was very nice to hear!! We will definitely be back and we&#39;ll definitely be requesting her section next time!!!"

The only reason it was less is because I have had great service here in the past. Most days I would give RA. 5 stars for food and staff even on the busiest of days. I&#39;ve worked in the service industry before so I get it. 

It started with getting us a table. My fiancé and I met with another couple for dinner and drinks one night. We got there early so we could put our name in. We put our name in and waited 45 while other people walked in and for sure did not have reservations. Once everybody was seated and we continued to sit in the waiting area, the hostess asked us our name again and mumbled under her breath, &#34;oh shit&#34; and said right this way. 

Once we were seated we were seated at a table for 2 with 4 people. Even though we&#39;re close friends we don&#39;t like to eat that close to each other. 

We ordered drinks and an app before placing our main order. We got our sushi first and our friends 20 minutes later followed by our app for dessert. 

Drinks ran dry and my patience ran thin. We left our server a 20% tip because I know our experience was not 100% her fault. I also know people have off days and they survive on tips. She was a nice girl and it wasn&#39;t her fault we were stuck at a 2 person table. 

I really hope front of the house management reads this and works on how they seat people a little bit better."

Chirashi bowl: 3.5/5 It&#39;s sushi rice topped with chopped up sashimi, cucumber, and seafood topped with a sweet sauce. It does the job for when I can&#39;t get the real thing.

Happy hour: 3/5 the sushi is very mediocre and has been really skimpy lately. The only dish I think is okay is the seared tuna. The portions seemed to have shrank over the past three years and there seems to be excessive rice.

I&#39;ll probably be back but it&#39;s no where near my favorite."

I stopped by on a Tuesday night with my niece. We were seated outside at a lovely high top and had Amanda as our waitress. 

RA has a fancy pants vibe with cool cocktails and fun sushi. With the exception of the giant ginger salad we ate completely from the special menu. Our order was placed in a staggered manner and the waitress and food runners checked on us and cleared the table quickly. The fried shrimp appetizer was surprisingly good (I don&#39;t usually order fried but I didn&#39;t read). The spring rolls were yummy, they could have skipped the mustard/ketchup dip because it didn&#39;t seem to compliment the rolls. 

Prices were average for sushi so I was impressed, even the regular menu items were reasonably priced. On a side note their regular iced tea was delicious, nothing special that I could pick out but super yummy.

I will return to check out their other special nights."

Sometimes the service is bad, but this week I went in with a group of 5 and our waitress was great. I had my half-birthday coupon to use ($20 off any purchase, Monday-Thursday) so it was a great steal too. I started with the lobster spring rolls, which I probably wouldn&#39;t get again. $11.50 for 4 small spring rolls that were mostly filling and not lobster. However, the Viva Las Vegas Roll was amazing as usual. I crave that roll! So good. If you can come during Happy Hour (3-7pm), a lot of their food is discounted but you can&#39;t use any coupons with that."

I dont know why this is known as a sushi bar but the quality of the sushi is below average. 

Also, the service is horrible at this location. Our server she seemed sooo uninterested in being there.  Looking back this place was really good about 3 years ago...now its as if the employees don&#39;t care and cant wait to clock out. 

I would skip it."

We got there around 530 and HH was from 3 - 7 PM Mon-Fri. The waiters were very polite, understanding, and helpful as we kept having to add on tables since more and more classmates were coming. 

I shared the spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and Las Vegas roll w/ a friend and that was more than enough for us. I also got to try the lobster ceviche that another classmate ordered and that was actually pretty good! The lobster tasted fresh and they added avocado so there was a twist to it. They order a good amount of mixed drinks for the HH menus if you want to drink while you enjoy sushi.

Total for 3 HH rolls was around $25 after tax and tip, very good deal for sushi. As my party was leaving around 7ish, there were a lot of people waiting to be seated so I suggest to beat the crowd and come a bit earlier on Friday nights."

My dad always up for eating, asked us where we wanted to go. The conversation went something like this;

Dad: &#34;What are you in the mood for?&#34;

Me: &#34;You know me, I&#39;ll eat anything&#34;

Sister: &#34;I&#39;m in the mood for sushi.&#34;

Dad: &#34;How about Chinese food? Your father doesn&#39;t like raw fish. Remember that Chinese food place we ordered from once, we got sushi from there, right?&#34;

Sister: &#34;That&#39;s not sushi dad, I&#39;m not in the mood for Chinese. There&#39;s that sushi place by your house, and they&#39;ll have food that you&#39;ll like.&#34; 

At this point I&#39;m keeping my mouth shut, since my husband is back at home right now  beside himself with delight, eating all the Chinese food he wants, since I won&#39;t eat the stuff. Hey, as I&#39;ve said, I&#39;ll eat anything, but I might complain the whole time as I&#39;m eating it. My sister has this uncanny ability to persuade my dad to do just about anything, so I just sit back and let her work her magic. We find our way over to Ra over in Yorktown.

For appetizers we get gyoza, lobster spring rolls and chili ponzu yellowtail. I ask our server about the Binchu Maguro, since I know it as Shiro Maguro, and I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to order some mystery albacore. She ends up getting me a free sample, and it&#39;s the sushi I wanted. The fish was good, but a bit too much of garlic on it. The lobster rolls were great, a good mix of sweet and savory. The yellowtail was also awesome, but my sister sucked down the majority of it since she wasn&#39;t eating the gyoza. I promptly ate the gyoza with my dad, even though it was just ok. The Viva Las Vegas roll was the only thing I didn&#39;t care for, but I took a picture since it looked so pretty. It just has a strong fishy smell to it. Dad had the spicy chicken teriyaki udon, and promptly sucked it down commenting on thick the noodles were. 

For dessert we got the coconut flan and the tempura ice cream, the flan was great and the ice cream looked like a poor attempt to squish slices of tempura cake around ice cream, and to hide the pieces by drizzling some chocolate around it.

Would I come here again? Sure, but I&#39;ll make sure I order select items from the menu."

I&#39;ve been to RA several times over the past couple of years and can&#39;t believe I&#39;m only now writing a review. 

Plenty of seating at the bar, sushi bar, high tops or dining room.  So whatever you are in the mood for-RA has it. 

Food is good and and the menu is very large which is great if you are with someone that might night dive into the sashimi on the first date. 

The portions are also very good and the various platters won&#39;t break your bank.  Service has always been very good which is t something you always get a the larger sushi places. 

Overall a very nice experience so dive in!

Cheers!

I used to love this place. Ive gone here for 8 years. I&#39;ve been to over 20+ sushi restaurants in the Chicagoland area. Today, you couldn&#39;t pay me to go here. Let&#39;s start off with---7 out of the 9 times I&#39;ve come here last were atrocious. I&#39;ve only come here based on RA&#39;s Hookup or if friends invite me here. Let&#39;s go over each experience in a much shorter version.

Food/Drinks = 4 out of 5
Service = -5

Experience 1 (2011): Five people including myself. We sat down and got our waters. There were two other tables being waited at approximately 8pm. After sitting around for 15 minutes and no one has approached us to take our order, we got up to look for assistance. No waiters/waitresses in sight, no one at the front podium, and no one at the bar. As we searched, the busboys proceeded to take our silverware and waters away and cleared the tables as we told them to stop because we haven&#39;t been served yet, they proceeded to ignore us and it was that time to just walk out and go elsewhere.
Experience 2 (2013): Six people with a semi busy Sunday happy hour. Waitress was quick to introduce herself. After she took our drink orders, she brought our drinks back and said &#34;one moment&#34;. 20 minutes later she came back and took our order. It took 45 minutes for us to get our food. At this point, most of us just wanted to eat, pay, and leave ASAP. It took 38 minutes to get our check. Once she collected our cards (3 separate bills with a total of 8 rolls) it took 20 minutes to come back. In short, it took over 2 hours to eat a 15 minute meal. Amen.
Experience 3 (2013): This was actually an OK experience except we never got any refills on water and there were no plates, napkins, or soy sauce ever given to us even when we asked for them. Semi busy.
Experience 4 (2014): 5 people. Only some of our food was brought out. Our check was brought out also a few minutes afterwards....we didn&#39;t ask for it and we haven&#39;t even finished ordering. Come on man!
Experience 5 (2015): Not bad. Finally.
Experience 6 (2015): Not bad. A two trip streak!
Experience 7 (2015): Streak ended. Forgot our order completely. LMAO.
Experience 8 (2015): Found snot/spit in our food. Goodbye.
Experience 9 (Today): The only reason I came back today was due to my RA Hookup $20 Half Birthday with my girlfriend. Our waitress to awhile to get to our table, but she seemed rushed. We asked for waters and some soy sauce because ours was empty. She grabbed it and put it on another table and gave us that one. (Which by the way, another couple sat there moments later asking the same question) she took our sushi order as soon as she brought our waters. Our food came out and she forgot one of my rolls because she gave it to another customer. I eventually got it back. After we finished eating food, we were waiting for refills for our water since no one else came by. We sat there for a total of 31 minutes with empty plates and glasses and our waitress was talking to other tables and periodically disappeared. I was able to stand up and do a 360 view of the dining room and counted 1 RA employee behind the sushi bar. No waitresses. No one at the podium. No one tending the bar. De ja vu? Wednesday night we 3 empty tables. I thought it was just me, but there were two other tables with couples sitting there that haven&#39;t had a chance to order yet (31 minutes).

Needless to say. I am no longer eating here in my lifetime. Eat at this location at your own risk. Maybe during happy hour or if you get coupons. If you don&#39;t mind crappy service, you might not be bothered by this place. I enjoy good times with friends and an attentive waiting staff, not perfect, but attentive enough to get a water refill or at least stop by and ask if we are ok. RA has not cared for the past 5 years. Good luck with this location and happy yelping!"

I&#39;m basically the oldest 30 year old I know. I spend my weekends volunteering and baking things my husband would enjoy. I find myself playing music in the car at reasonable volumes. I am relied upon at work (and not in that &#34;yeah it&#39;s reliable that she&#39;ll be 20 mins late!&#34; kinda way). 

ANYWAY, I digress. THE POINT is that Ra is trendy, and it&#39;s weird to me that I enjoy it so much. And for sure, there&#39;s parts I don&#39;t enjoy. The decor is way too much, for instance. I can understand trendy, but this almost feels like trying-too-hard. The staff is obnoxious, particularly the hostessing staff. They&#39;re cold and unwelcoming. Our server on this particular visit was very helpful, so maybe the tide is turning there, but my experience has been that service is meh. 

But the 3 stars (wish I could do 3.5, but alas) are all for the fun, innovative, and delicious sushi. Hubs friend who was in town this weekend ADORES sushi, and when I noted they don&#39;t have any Ra locations in Michigan (from whence he came) I knew it&#39;d be a good choice (plus I didn&#39;t have to hike all the way out to the city on a Friday night when I was already exhausted - old lady, remember?)

We ordered a boatload of food and somehow managed to eat it all. My husband did the best of all of us when ordering - he got the seared salmon which was to DIE for, and an avocado and salmon sashimi looking bit that was presented beautifully and tasted delicious. As for me, I&#39;m always content with a spicy tuna roll (classic, but done well) and the ever popular Viva Las Vegas roll, a roll so bastardized that it could only be named after Sin City, but so delicious that I cannot resist it, creamy crab mix rolled into a giant roll with a tempura batter and a lotus root &#34;chip&#34; adorning the top of each piece. It is decadent, filling, and wonderful. I don&#39;t care about authenticity when the sushi tastes this good.

We find ourselves returning to Ra to gorge on sushi and feel cooler than we are maybe once or twice a year, and will likely continue to do so. Maybe visiting such a cool, trendy place will help keep me young."

Although the prices have gone up over the years, everything is still a great deal. Their happy hour drinks even run all day.

The atmosphere is very hip and modern. The only thing that ruined it on my most recent trip was the sun blaring through the shades. It took some strategic planning to not be directly in the light.

My recommendations off the happy hour menu is definitely the viva Las Vegas roll. There is nothing like it. I don&#39;t love raw fish so there are certain things I steer clear of but this roll is just perfect. Plus it&#39;s huge! The tootski maki is also good, with similar flavors. 

The service is prompt, it&#39;s a great price and really good sushi. Although the drink specials run all day, they aren&#39;t much to brag about."

Good menu with lots of options although I wish they had more basic sushi rolls like Alaska and Boston.

Dessert here is lame... I never get it.

Amazing happy hour deals!! They usually have 2 happy hours too - one early and one late offering both drinks and food. The happy hour options are great too -they have rolls on there that I absolutely love (like the spicy salmon, pacific and cali.)

The fancy rolls are usually fried and pretty tasty. My family doesn&#39;t like sushi so Ra is a great compromise between cooked and raw. They actually enjoy coming here for their sushi rolls!

The service is consistently good both in the bar area and the dinning area. They also have outdoor seating during the warmer weather which is always nice.

The vibe is trendy (for the burbs.) It doesn&#39;t feel intimidating in the way that most trendy places make you feel. The decor is nice but not fancy, warm but not too romantic... classy but still casual. 

Overall, this is a solid place to grab a decent dinner even if you are not interested in eating raw fish. It strikes a true balance that I think will please most people."

My server was utterly clueless. I wanted warm sake and she didn&#39;t even know what kind of sake would be warm. The sushi was extremely bland, tasteless and it honestly felt like it came out of a carton as oppose to being freshly rolled by a chef.

Very tough to tell the difference between types of fish because they all tasted really stale and non flavorful. Personally, this places gets business cause of the location. Food is awful. Do not come here if you want tasty sushi."

However, he also directly sent me a gift certificate to have a new meal. 

I haven&#39;t gone yet to use it (a little hesitant to return after the last experience - need to make sure I&#39;ve cooled down appropriately to give then a fair shot at getting my business back), but will update again after my experience."

My friend and I were looking around for some good sushi and decided to check it out. We sat in the dining area vs the bar area.. Both are really nice.. The decor is inviting and theres a nice ambience. We ordered the lobster spring rolls as an appetizer. They were really good! We got three sushi rolls.  One , I cant recall the name but it was a shrimp and scallop roll.. Its served in a little skillet with spoons.. You kind of have to spoon the roll out because of the sauce. It had a spicy kick and I loved it. The service was exceptional. When we looked confused at the appearance of the roll that I described, the server offered to take it off of the bill if we didnt like it. The drinks were good too..I will surely be a repeat diner."

Surprisingly, it was super packed for a Monday night! We sat at a cocktail table. It took a pretty long time for the server to take our order, but once she did, the sushi came out fast.

Rackin roll- this is a warm temperature specialty roll. It has lots of avocado and cream cheese and thus was deeelicious!!! Definitely my favorite. It came in a roll of 6.

Crazy monkey- this was def my least favorite. It was a specialty roll but looked like one of the simple rolls. It had lots of yummy avocado but it was completely drenched in mango sauce which completely ruined the whole roll. Even my hubby didn&#39;t want to finish the roll! He told me to leave the last few to let the restaurant know it was so bad, we didn&#39;t even want to finish it, lol. This came In a roll of 8.

Spicy salmon- this was a simple roll. It tasted okay. I felt there was too much cucumber which neutralized the flavor of the salmon. The salmon was a tad spicy. This came in a roll of 8.

Viva Las Vegas- this is a warm temperature specialty roll. It is drenched with toppings and doesn&#39;t even look like sushi anymore. It&#39;s pretty good. This comes in a roll of 5.

Pineapple cheese wontons- these were 4 tiny crab rangoons on top of coleslaw. They were very yummy but too small! Wasn&#39;t a fan of the coleslaw either but the insides of the rangoons were so good!

My hubby got hot saki. He said it was terrible and that it was the worst he&#39;s ever had. This was the first time in my life I&#39;ve ever heard him say he didn&#39;t like an alcoholic beverage!

Overall their sushi is pretty good!"

I came here with my team for Customer Service appreciation week and I left feeling full and super appreciated (at least for a few hours.)

There was 6 of us at the table and we each received a regular menu, but we were only given 1 sushi menu. We had to ask for more so we didn&#39;t have to fight over it and so we were able to make a quick decision. It was a little annoying to me that the server didn&#39;t make herself readily available to answer questions about the different things they offered or make suggestions. She pretty much just came back to collect the sushi menu that we filled in with our order.

I can&#39;t really remember everything that was ordered but we ended up ordering 2 items each and just sharing everything as a table. I was surprised but we ended up eating almost everything, with only about 1 roll left. 

Food highlights-

-Lobster spring rolls. These were fantastic and something I would absolutely order again. There were only 4 of them, which was a disappointment because I wanted all of them to myself. It had a sweet sauce with it, which ended up making it a fantastic combination of sweet and salty.

-Scallop dynamite roll. I can only say this was DY-NO-MITE (said in my best J.J voice) It was my first experience with warm sushi, but I gotta admit that I didn&#39;t hate it. It was a sushi roll topped with warm scallops and some heavenly sauce. When the rest of my table was done with it, I found myself scooping all of the leftover sauce on my plate just so I could have every last drop of it. I will come back and just order this and be one happy woman.

-Dragon roll. Two of the people at my table said dragon rolls were their fave, so we ordered two of them. I&#39;d never had these before but I thought they were really flavorful, especially the sauce that was on top of it.

The rest of the sushi was just okay for me--not splendid, but not bad either.

Our total bill was $155 pre-tip for 11 rolls, 1 appetizer, 3 sodas and a side order of white rice, so about $25 per person. It was a little high to me, but then again, my husband and I usually try to go for our sushi fix during Happy Hour to save some money.

I think it&#39;s pretty sweet that they have Happy Hour on Saturdays too (3-7) The only crying shame is that the scallop dynamite roll isn&#39;t on the HH menu."

I asked for a sweet potato roll instead of the tempura. Roll was $8.50, the waitresses and hostesses were nice when I asked to see if the amount could go down due to it just being sweet potato. Manager was nice but justified it by saying they put in more sweet potato to offset the other veggies being absent and he won&#39;t lower the price. I said sure fine, but thought in my head that a lb is sweet potato is 75 cents. Asparagus and eggplant is what makes the cost higher. I&#39;m just going to keep to KYOTO where I can get the same quality at half the price. My sweet potato roll and avocado roll at RA was over $15. At KYOTO, it&#39;s $8... My mistake."

Food: Awesome. Great for the newbies. 
Drinks: Awesome. Come in with some friends. 
Meeting the people? Priceless. 

But you know what&#39;s the worst about this place? The clientele. I come into RA on my work breaks, and like to do a thing called &#34;people watching&#34; (my nieces/nephews told me about this) which is observing people&#39;s behaviors in whatever setting they are placed in. I will notice people happy with their server (so a happy server), and the server will go to her next table, who appears to be upset/frustrated and will demand/expect something in return (A very upset/anxious server). What&#39;s wrong with you people? Don&#39;t you know &#34;life&#39;s what you make it&#34;? If you come in with a bad attitude/mood, your server can sense it, and will try her best; its hard to give a person a positive experience when they&#39;re a grouch, am I right? Have you ever spoken to the RA servers? They are all great girls! Reason why they were hired! So personable. I wouldn&#39;t want to be around a person/group of people who were rude to me by demanding orders at me. How would you feel if that was done to you? Put yourself in these girls&#39; shoes! These girls are human beings, and have a life just like yourself. The servers I have had a couple times have made mistakes, but apologized, fixed it, and learned from their mistakes. I understand if its truly horrible, then yeah complain, but if its a honest mistake, you need to relax. 

My niece is a server, and I highly respect servers more than ever because of her. The horror stories she tells me about what people say/do and she&#39;s the one that has to take the blame, and the tips she receives that are sometimes nonexistent even if she gave the world to her table (she&#39;s not a server at RA, she works at a diner fyi). And the biggest issue of all, please tip 20% or more! I have always done it, but my niece has made me more aware of this issue. That tip is their income people! You&#39;re SUPPOSE to tip 20% or more to complete their income. If you cant afford to pay for your meal, AND YOUR SERVER IN FULL. DON&#39;T GO OUT TO EAT. End of story. (Unless is truly horrible service)

RA Sushi, I love your place, but the people that come in...thats what kills my mood, but I do my best to deal with it."

I&#39;ve been here multiple times and usually I end up here because one of my other top choices has somehow fallen through. I mean, the food is decent, but to me it&#39;s nothing special. 
 I&#39;ve pretty much tried all the big sushi rolls, and most of the appetizers. The food is okay. Service can be hit or miss. It&#39;s a cool atmosphere, but sometimes the music is completely obnoxious. There is a small patio you can sit on as well. 
Some things that are worth noting is that this place serves food late when most-to-all other restaurants in the area have shut down. Also, the Umami punch (formerly, the tsunami punch) is always worth getting. The large 6 million-ounce one is always fun to drink...until it&#39;s not. Make sure you have enough people to share with you, or you&#39;ll end up looking like that taxidermied fox meme. I don&#39;t love you, but I don&#39;t hate you either.

Well here it is. Ra its not the same as it was when I first started coming to the place. The service is not what it used to  be either. The place is full of distracted servers with bad attitudes. No bueno.
Many of the rolls are smaller of what they were back in the day and the presentation is not as creative as it used to be. I know that sounds like a silly reason but I know how fun the plates used to be and when they are not anymore, it makes u wonder what happened? Did the chef not take my sushi seriously? Maybe i am being a bit pretentious but why expect less then perfect? Especially since once this place  was my favorite sushi spot in town.
Fridays they had a live band that were really good. Played all sorts of music that would liven the place up. What happened to them? 

 I have tried pretty much everything on their menu. From miso hot soup to their sashimi, to the rolls, the salads and the drinks. 

They have some decent rolls such as crazy monkey roll, pacific roll, crunchy calamari roll, scallop dynamite roll and they have some that are pretty much plain old boring. My favorite thing in their menu by far is rheir miso hot soup (not to be mistaken with their regular miso soup). It has chives, bok choy, shrimp tofu and mushrooms. It can be spicy upon request and has the most amazing vinegar like taste to it. I LOVE it. 

Over all is not a bad place to go. Fun patios and cool atmosphere. Just dissapointing at the level of service and the quality of the sushi.

Overall is a fun place to go just not the good old Ra it used to be."

The standard in the hospitality industry is that the tables are greeted within 60 seconds. I never got a drink.  They just continued to clean and stock the bar. Managers were present on the floor no one bothered to say or asked me anything.  After sitting there for so long.  I got up and walked out without anyone saying a word to me or attempting to help.

Today my girlfriend asked for a margarita and it came back too salty so she asked for a sugar rim.The waitress had the nerve to just pour the margarita in a new sugar cup so when it came back it STILL tasted like salt! When we told her it still tastes like salt she said she would have to charge for a new one then and when we asked to speak to a manage the blonde haired manager responded &#34;well she brought back another one, so everything&#39;s fine&#34;...

We had the tuna tataki, pineapple cheese wontons, ultimate shrimp tempura roll, zone roll, and seared tuna. The filling in the the wontons were skimpy and the seared tuna was drowned in so much sauce you could barely tell it was seared. They do have great deals - half birthday discounts and a decent amount on the happy hour menu. If not for that and a few of the tolerable dishes on the menu, there&#39;d be no reason to return"

We ordered several appetizers, rolls and a couple entrees for the non-sushi eaters.  The best of the main courses was Scallop Dynamite.  

I&#39;m withholding one star because the food was a little &#34;chainish&#34; and not as authentically Japanese as other sushi restaurants.  My husband and I have been spoiled by Swordfish in Batavia which cannot be surpassed in freshness,  taste and preparation.

We ate today around 4pm for happy hour. I think they prep the shrimp tempura for some of the rolls for some of the happy hour rolls because I got the crispy calamari roll and the tempura was hard as a rock. It was pretty bad. The shrimp tempura was dry- it would have been good with some spicy mayo or something drizzled on top. And then the calamari was decent when it 1st came out and was fresh- but about 10 minutes after it hit the table the squid was already gummy and gross and un edible. They also had all the windows open and it was literally 90 degrees out today with no wind. The entire restaurant was warm and we were not sitting by the Windows.. We were in the dining area. I think there&#39;s better places in the area for happy hour... But we wanted to give RA a try...

Tonight, after taking a seat in the bar area, my husband and I waited about 10 minutes at least before our waitress came over to take our drink order. We asked if we could just order as well. I got a few items off the Happy Hour sushi menu, and my husband (who doesn&#39;t like sushi) ordered a noodle dish. 

My sushi came out fairly quickly. When our waitress brought it, she asked, &#34;Is there anything else I can get you?&#34; I laughed and said &#39;just his food&#39; thinking she knew that. Well, after about 15 minutes passed without his food arriving, I had the hostess ask our waitress to come over. I asked if she remembered his food, and she said it should be up soon. After another few minutes, someone tried to deliver a chicken dish without noodles to him. We told her it was the incorrect dish. Our waitress came back to say they brought that dish to us by mistake, and the correct noodle dish should be up shortly. At this point, I am almost done eating, and I am literally the slowest eater on the planet. We asked for a manager, and she came over and apologized but nothing more.  Well, she did refill my drink for me.

Finally, my husband&#39;s food arrived, and our waitress said that sometimes that dish takes longer than the sushi. Really? 1/2 hour longer?? We have ordered sushi and that noodle dish before on several occasions, and sometimes the noodles even come out 1st!  He wound up taking 1/2 of it to go.  We think our waitress may have forgotten to enter my husband&#39;s noodle dish from the get go and the rest was them trying to act like that didn&#39;t happen. Maybe just admit you forgot it?? We would have been more understanding that way. And maybe a free dessert for me to eat while my husband starts his dinner? Or, maybe not. Disappointing  to say the least, from a very, very long time customer. I am giving 2 Stars only because the food was good and consistent.  The service could use a little work."

I love the attitude of the waitress but when we arrived, the table wasn&#39;t clean and there were no utensils at our table nor were they given to us when our food came out. Moreover, the quality of the food was subpar at best. For starters, I ordered octopus sashimi and salmon sashimi. The sashimi was warm and had a salty taste which I&#39;ve never encountered before (and I&#39;ve had a lot of sashimi). The second biggest concern that I specifically informed the waitress was the discoloration of the octopus sashimi. One side of the octopus sashimi was brown while the other side was pink. I was expecting some response or acknowledgement from the staff about the situation however there was none. I will have to reconsider coming back here again."

I should first mention that as a vegetarian, of course my experience is limited to those items - so obviously I can&#39;t speak on the nigiri/sashimi/non-veggie rolls, etc.

The two items I had enjoyed were the Agedashi Tofu and the Mochi dessert.  I felt the mochi was a bit overpriced (as it tends to be in sushi places, in my opinion), but still delicious.  The agedashi tofu was really great!  I hadn&#39;t tried it there before, but was really glad I did - it was by far the best thing I&#39;d had.

The maki I ordered were a special vegetarian roll (it&#39;s not listed on their current online menu, but is similar to their vegetable tempura roll) and the vegetable roll (in soy paper).  The vegetable roll was incredibly bland; and while I liked the specialty roll better (mostly due to the crunch topping and eel sauce, which gave it some flavor), it wasn&#39;t a ton better.  I quickly realized why it&#39;d been so long since I&#39;d been there.  

I have no desire to come back, unless in a group setting - they do have a good drink menu and they have the ambiance going for them."

I ordered the Las Vegas roll and it was a piece of artwork so much that it was too hard to eat because it was so large. I definitely would not recommend getting this roll if you are on a first date or business meeting. 

I also ordered the spicy shrimp roll and it wasn&#39;t spicy at all and not very good. However, my friend ordered the fried calamari and it was delicious!!!

The only reason I gave them 3 stars is because they had great happy hour specials AND beautiful atmosphere."

It&#39;s been awhile that we went to sushi ra. The bar area was a nice size not overly crowded with tables and chairs. They had a happy hour special menu until 7pm heck yeah!  The salmon nigiri was fresh not so much sushi rice and the salmon pcs sizes we&#39;re good. The spicy tuna maki roll was really spicy I likey! The shrimp maki was pretty good too. The chicken teriyaki dinner was a pretty good size with fresh vegetables not overly sweet. Keep in mind this is an Asian fusion place so the main dishes are not authentic Japanese.  The server Theresa was amazing!  very attentive always had our drinks filled without us asking for more. And I liked that the staff was cleaning off our table as we finish one dish after another.

The boys had saki bombs, I didn&#39;t try it but it looked good. 

My fiancé didn&#39;t really enjoy sushi so he got the steak. I was a little disappointed that the steak was so tiny. It was pretty fatty as well.

First off, this is not traditional or authentic sushi for those under a rock. They were blasting Latino music when we walked in and the staff are high school/college kids with way-too-fake tans and hair highlights circa 2000.

We always start with gyoza when we have sushi (tradition for us) and they were bland and the sauce tasted like pure vinegar. I&#39;ve had better gyoza from the frozen food section of the grocery store. 

The sushi was overly salty and doused in thick sauces. This is always a warning side to me. What are they trying to cover up? Maybe poor-quality fish? After 4 rolls, we were craving just a regular, traditional roll which we ordered. $60 later, we left unsatisfied and still hungry. 

Ambiance (we ate outside) was nice and service was decent."

I was really happy with the cocktails, the server was awesome, and the sushi was both creative and delicious.

The Happy Hour prices were pretty good compared to the menu prices.  We tried the salmon/asparagus rolls, the Viva Las Vegas, and some nigiri pieces.  The fish was all fresh and well-prepared.  I thought the rolls were creative, and definitely different than other places I&#39;ve been.  They also have a menu with non-sushi items, so this is a definite go-to if people in your group aren&#39;t sushi fans.

Overall I thought this place was really good.  It has a cool atmosphere, the drinks are good, and the service is great.  I&#39;ll be back."

Normally I wouldn&#39;t be wandering around Wheaton on a weeknight, but when you get a chance to dine with three lovely ladies, what&#39;s a guy to do?  (say yes, obviously)

Jacqueline B, Olivia B, Kate S and I met here as part of a standing monthly dinner outing for the Yelp Chicago &#39;burbs team.  We chose Union House because of its centralized location, consistently high marks, and the fact that they were showing the NLCS.

I arrived fashionably late (as always!) and saw that we were the only customers in the restaurant at 7pm.  Hmmmm.  It was a little odd, especially considering that both the Bears AND Cubs were playing but I paid little mind to it.  They had a nice draft beer selection and promising menu.

Wasting little time, we placed orders for the homemade bbq chips, fried pickles and buffalo shrimp.  The chips came out first and couldn&#39;t have been better.  Perfect thickness and dusted with a sweet yet tangy barbecue seasoning.  The pickles followed and came served with an avocado ranch, an ideal dipping sauce for those delicious deep-fried morsels.

Next up were the shrimp, which were coated with buffalo sauce and accompanied by a blue cheese dip over a bed of mixed greens.  Electing not to stop there, we kept things moving along with lobster mac n&#39; cheese and prosciutto-wrapped asparagus.....minus the prosciutto (which they were out of).  The creamy lobster mac was a great big portion size and had wonderfully rich texture, not to mention ample amount of lobster meat and andouille sausage.

For dessert somebody chose the hot fudge brownie sundae, and it was definitely a hot fudge brownie sundae.  The bites I took seemed to be mostly chocolate chips for some reason, but it was decadent and nearly put me over the edge into a food coma.

Bread = 4.5
Circuses = 3

Our server was fine, although she told us about the daily specials as we were finishing our third dish.  Oopsssss.  Too bad so sad, a few of the ones she mentioned sounded tasty.  What&#39;s more, she started off by telling us that Union House has &#34;had 20 or 30 menus in the past 4 years.&#34;  Are you trying to tell us that the kitchen likes to mix it up.......or that new menus means new management because your business experiences high turnover?

Part of this place&#39;s charm is the eclectic assortment of cutlery and wall decorations, no two of which are the same.  Ultimately, those quirks drove the OCD part of my brain absolutely nuts.  There were clocks on the wall set at totally different times, every table had unique styles of plates, and Olivia B randomly got a jank-ass bent spoon.  All in all, there were more continuity problems than an Ed Wood movie.

My lasting impression is that the food was awesome, which is enough to spur me to return should I ever find myself in the area again."

The food here is unique and made from scratch. Their menu changes often based on the season and available local items. They don&#39;t have any microwaves or hot plates, so everything is served up fresh and when it&#39;s ready! The menu is meant for sharing, although certain items will definitely feed more than others so I suggest asking your server for recommendations!

They have a great beer list and wines that I have never heard of. Union House has a full bar as well and a small list of cocktails on the menu. At 6:30 pm on a Thursday night the restaurant was completely empty. I had to laugh since I had made a reservation for our group of four. It was a Cubs playoff game night though and the Bears were playing, so I can understand. They do have two TVs up at the bar though, so we were able to keep an eye on the games while we dined!

Our waitress was sweet and helpful, although she did forget to mention the specials until we had already finished eating which was a bummer. Everything we had ordered though was really good. We started out with the house made BBQ chips (knowing they would come out fast) and these were the perfect pre-dinner snack. We then proceeded to order the fried pickles and BBQ shrimp. Both were really good! The sauces were perfect for each. The fried pickles came with an avocado sauce and the BBQ shrimp a blue cheese which was a nice touch. 

For our second round, we ordered the asparagus and lobster mac n cheese. The asparagus was seasoned really well and had the perfect amount of crunch. The lobster mac n cheese was huge and flavorful. This dish could have been split between like 5 people, but three of us finished it off no problem. For dessert I ordered the chocolate cake sundae for us to share. It was really yummy of course because it&#39;s cake, ice cream, and whipped cream, but nothing overwhelmingly special.

Definitely a charming and quirky little spot. They have a nice outdoor patio, so I would definitely like to come back when it&#39;s warmer out!"

They only problem I noticed is that our food wasn&#39;t as warm as it should be and it took longer to get each dish. Huge beer selection and daily specials. Don&#39;t bother on checking the time here as they have clocks all over the walls that I think don&#39;t all work. Lol.

We had the lobster andouille Mac and cheese delicious little spicy, shrimp and grits yum, and mini pork sliders tasty."

My wife and I went on a recent Friday evening for dinner and we enjoyed most of what he ate.

The o.k. to decent:
-The crab hush puppies were dry and overcooked, but the sauce was tangy and sweet.

The very good and beyond:
-Shrimp and grits were good and get the cheese for the grits ($0.50 extra, but they use a good flavorful cheese that made the dish).
-The bacon-super thick and cooked well done, it topped off the shrimp and grits nicely and absolutely made the bacon blue salad.  Speaking of that salad, a good portion with crisp, cool lettuce and tomatoes and the house made blue cheese dressing was the perfect combination of crumbly, creamy awesome.
-Fried brussels sprouts were cooked well and the sauce was a buerre blanc with sea salt.  My wife loves these and I like them, just a small portion.   
-Crab cakes were tasty-flaky-and the creamy remoulade was good.

Decent drink selection and solid service.   The quality of the meat/seafood is good as is the produce, while the sauces are not overwhelming, but compliment things nicely.  I&#39;ve just solidified the 4 star rating in my mind and will be back in the not too distant future, maybe for lunch..."

Add salt. Just a little bit of salt on each dish would have brought out the flavors of the food and made the dishes more delicious.

We tried the fried Brussels sprouts, lobster Mac n cheese, pulled pork sandwiches, crab cakes, and the shrimp and grits.

Brussel sprouts: 3/5. Flavor was almost there. A little charred for my liking but it was probably the best thing we had that night. 

Lobster Mac: 3/5. The actual Mac n cheese part was boring, not amazing. It comes with lobster and pieces of sausage in them and those are the best part.

Pulled pork: 4/5. Come on pretzel buns and the pulled pork speaks for itself. 

Crab cakes: 4/5. This dish was simple and executed well. Good flavor and good sauce.

Shrimp and grits: 2/5. I have yet to find a restaurant that does a good shrimp and grits in this area. The grits were flavorless and the bacon overpowered the dish. 

They do have outdoor seating and a good wine/beer list. This is not a cheap destination for dinner so be prepared to have your wallet hurting afterwards. 

Overall I&#39;m not sure if I would go back. The owner of the restaurant was personable and around making sure we were enjoying the meal and got everything we needed. The server was nice too, but the food was lacking."

We were nicely greeted initially by the server who began to seat us then asked us to move to the next table because she had a large group coming in, sure whateves. She asked if we&#39;d been there before and when we said no she started to explain the restaurants history. It was ok at first, but ended on sorta a pretentious note. We finally got the specials and put in our drink order for a couple of Not Your Father&#39;s Root Beer - the 10% stuff! 

The set up of the space is kinda off... There is more room for the patrons at the bar (behind the bar stools) taking away space for the tables and moving around the dining area. I&#39;m glad we weren&#39;t there when it was busy! I could see how this would become an issue with a full dining area!

We ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken on top of mashed potatoes covered in country gravy &amp; fried egg to share. The chicken breast was pounded thin, but not overcooked. The country gravy was nicely seasoned! The egg was just a little runny giving it that additional gravy. It was a good dish.

I ordered the Crab Cakes. There were three cakes served with a remoulade sauce. Ok, these cakes were mostly crabby! That made me happy! They were a couple inches in diameter and quite filling. The crab flavor was very prominent since they weren&#39;t overloaded with a ton of other stuff!

The boy got the Lobster Mac which has homemade cheddar mornay sauce, Andouille sausage, &amp; grated parmesan. It had pretty good size pieces of lobster in it! The cheese sauce was well seasoned! This was a really good dish!

There were only 2 other tables while we were there. No big group showed up. It was 5pm on a Friday when we went. The server asked if we had a reservation when we arrived - there was nobody there... Maybe they get really busy and you should consider calling ahead. Our server was the only one in the dining room. She did tell us that the plates come out as they are completed in the kitchen, so don&#39;t expect them all to come out at once.

It&#39;s an interesting concept and it was nice to check it out. The food was really good. We may or may not go again."

Otherwise, I would have never known about this place since I&#39;m not from the area.  In short, it will not get a star for location. It is a block away from CEntral DuPage Hospital, across from a Chase bank, and other small neighborhood stores. 

The place is cozy and small. There is a bar that offer tons of craft beers and wine. Service is great, attentive, and informative. Their concept is farm to table and all of the plates are SMALL. It&#39;s like tapas but American food. My issue: small plates and small portions are charged at a full price. Another star deducted for value. 

The bbq pulled pork was their award winning entree which I thought was just ok, it can have a more zesty flavor, kick, or perhaps more bbq sauce. Sad to say that I had too much expectations for this little piggy, it was totally underwhelming. It came with 2 pretzel bun sliders and chips, $13! For 2 sliders!!! 

I also had chicken fried chicken ( fried chicken on top of mashed potatoes topped with fried egg), this plate is delish! Their chunky mashed potatoes was fresh and light. But again, pricey!

The fried pickles and onion rings were ok. They were both very greasy. And I honestly would use a different sauce for these 2!  

Overall, I enjoyed the passionate workers at this place.  Although they take pride in having high quality ingredients, I just can&#39;t justify such high priced food for this location.  Maybe in downtown Chicago, definitely not across the hospital in Wheaton!"

I tried a Revolution fistmas beer and out server let us try some samples before ordering it. this is the second time I&#39;ve been here and each time I&#39;ve discovered a new beer that I enjoy. 

For food, the pulled pork sliders were quite good, the crunch of the pickle helped add some texture to the pork, slaw, and pretzel roll. The BBQ sauce was darker than most and seemed to have a vinegary taste to it. The grilled shrimp skewers had some good cayenne and pepper on them, very well done. The roasted asparagus spears were just ok, but nothing memorable. 

Then, came out second round of food. We had the bourbon pork skewers. You must try these. Brown sugar, bourbon, and garlic flavors on top of a creamy Sriracha based sauce. Sweet and heat, it was like Louisiana meets Asian cuisine. The crab cakes were a huge disappointment. The remoulade was mediocre and there was zero crispiness on the outside. They were listed as Baltimore-style crabcakes. Well, I&#39;ve been to Baltimore and their crabcakes are crispy on the outside!

Food was well presented albeit proportions were slightly off on the shrimp (just five shrimp - not all that big) and the bowl of brussel sprouts was massive in proportion ( but we ate them all! :)

As we recently moved to the area this was on our list of bookmarked places. There are pros and cons to this place but I feel this place has the makings of being a local gem!! 
Menu is nicely balanced with options of small plates. Beer menu was acceptable, would recommend adding some local IPA like Pipeworks Lizard King. I had the sangria which was excellent, full bodied and not too sweet. 
Noshing included the shrimp skewer, chicken sliders-A+++, Brussels sprouts-delicious, and brownie sundae. The sundae was a disappointment-not warm as described in menu and no WOW factor. Not enough hot fudge and needs maybe a little pop to make it a Union special! I&#39;m thinking warm churro sundae!! 
Overall the place feels family owned with a few kinks being worked out . We weren&#39;t given specials until we heard regulars ask about them and then we asked about them as well.

Made an online (Yelp) reservation which was honored without issue. Great place for small plates to let everyone try something different.

Treat the menu as if you were at a tapas place. They do have a few entrees that are sufficient for a one person meal, but the fun is sharing plates. The food comes out as it is prepared, so pace yourself. We did two and a half rounds, probably four or five plates per round.

We had a little of everything. 

Good to great: The asparagus (plain and with prosciutto) was outstanding. Mac and cheese, very good (even without bacon, per request).  Firecracker shrimp skewer -- very good. Nice heat. The Brussels sprouts were remarkably good. Crab cakes were quite nice, with a good Remoulade. The chicken skewers were quite good and not at all sweet.

Pretty good: The chicken fried chicken needed a thicker chicken breast, but was quite tasty. The BLT was good, but needed way more bacon. The Texas toast is a bit much. 

Meh: We got the slaw with the pulled pork sliders on the side and were glad to do that as the slaw had an off taste and smell. One of party said that it smelled like hand cream. The sliders were quite good, however. The crab hush puppies, as noted elsewhere, need work. They come out too well done and lack flavor.

They had a wonderful cheesecake and a really good carrot cake (and I normally don&#39;t like carrot cake).

The venue is smallish, so there could be a wait if they get busy, but I think it is about the right size for the menu."

Having eaten here several times now, we have been very happy with the food, drink, and service on all visits. The food is definitely not health food, and many items are easily shared. The onion rings are among the best we&#39;ve ever had: very light breading, not too greasy, hot and tender. The mac and cheese is a little bit plain but very good, and we should have ordered it with the lobster. The chicken fried chicken is wonderful and the pork sliders are out of this world. The poem sliders came with house made barbecue potato chips that were really yummy. Did you like Brussel sprouts as a kid? Neither did I but I bet your mom or dad didn&#39;t dry them in butter and wine. They are hot, crispy, and delicious. The chicken skewers are tender and tasty. The craft cocktails are excellent and deceivingly potent. There is also full complement of craft beers and wine selection. All in all, Union kitchen is a wonderful place to come for your comfort food fix. We will definitely be back."

Food is served as small plates and come out as they are done. We ordered fried Brussels sprouts that were served with a mustard beurre blanc and sprinkling of sea salt. I didn&#39;t get much of the mustard but overall it was a great dish. Then we had fried pickles and BBQ pulled pork sliders topped with slaw on a pretzel bun. The pickles with the house made avocado ranch dressing are addictive. I think I ate the entire plate. Hashtag sorry not sorry. The sliders were tasty. The owner smokes the pork herself and between the smoke flavor and sauce, it&#39;s a hit. Not sure how I feel about the house made potato chips. Lastly, we had the shrimp and grits. The shrimp were plump, perfectly cooked and seasoned little morsels. They rest upon grits topped with chunky bacon (the bacon is the bomb!) and a sunny side up egg. This plate would be perfect if the grits were seasoned a bit and not as runny. It was hard to eat with a fork which was the only utensil besides a knife that we had. The grits fell through the tines on its journey to our faces. 
Ample beer and wine selection with local brewers represented. 
Lindsay, our server, was great. 
This is a nice addition to the neighborhood and would be a good place for a GNO."

I will definitely return if I&#39;m in the area. 

Service was great and fast.  

And the cheesecake for dessert was fantastic. Very light and fluffy which is how i like it with an Oreo crust.

Only downside was the price was a little high.  But at least it was worth it.  It was $100 with tip and no alcohol."

Most dishes (shrimp &amp; grits, lobster Mac &amp; cheese, and Brussels) were under-seasoned. The crab cakes were great. A little salt really helps to being out flavors and would have made all the difference. Because we were sitting outside, there wasn&#39;t any on the tables.

What brought me here was a search for shrimp and grits in the suburbs. Per James H.&#39;s review the ones here were great. So tonight me and my husband went, snagged a seat on the patio, and dug in. 

The menu is small but the beer list is nice and long. I got to try the Bell&#39;s Amber Ale(reminded me of Hacker Schoer) and the Not Your Fathers Root Beer(tastes JUST like root beer but has alcohol). Both were great, but the NYFRB was more my speed and it&#39;s a new favorite.  

Most of the menu is small plates. We ordered a lot of different things because everything looked so good. For appetizers we did fried pickles, grilled oysters grilled shrimp. All of these rocked the house. The grilled shrimp was huge, tender, seasoned and sauced just right.  We&#39;d never had grilled clams, and these were fantastic. 

The shrimp. The grits. Wow. This was a larger plate, definitely an entree. The dish also nice sized bacon pieces and a perfect egg over easy.  My husband was was lucky to get a few bites, because I finished the whole thing. I almost ordered some to go. This dish is the perfect combo of all the delicious things I love. 

The pulled pork sliders were tasty. Nice pretzel buns and not over sauced. The onion rings were crispy, battered thick the way they should be.

To top it off, bread pudding. Bread pudding made with...wait for it...DONUTS! And it must&#39;ve had magical powers because I looked away for a second and it disappeared. Or my husband inhaled it. 

Each item, besides the ones we asked to be brought as entrees, was brought separately. I really feel like that gave us a chance to enjoy the flavors properly. Our server was attentive, fun, and informative. Each dish was prepared fresh and presented cleanly.  Despite their extensive beer list, don&#39;t make the mistake of dropping by Union House just for a beer."

It is a small plate restaurant, so bring a friend and your appetite. If you are a beer drinker, you will be very happy with the beer selection there. Mario behind the beer will satisfy you with a delicious selection and some great conversation about beers and life.

My boyfriend surprised me by taking me here for dinner because he knows I love southern food and tapas.  Put them together and you have my new favorite dining experience!  Union House is smaller, but they were very smart in how they arranged everything so that you can still have a personal conversation with ease.  The bar has all of their drink options up on large chalkboards, some drinks are served in mason jars, and none of the plates match.  Great way to put out that country vibe.  They even have my favorite &#34;Not Your Father&#39;s Rootbeer&#34; on tap!

The food.  I have a serious dining problem where I like to taste as many things on the menu has possible.  Urban House clearly understands me with the way their menu is created.  You should know that everything below was shared between two people that love to eat and we left very full.  During our visit we had the following: 

Fried Pickles: YES! They do the batter just right here so that it&#39;s the perfect fried pickle bite.  Their dipping sauce was clearly homemade and tasted great.
Macaroni and Cheese: Nothing extraordinary, but it was very good.
Beef Sliders: Boyfriend and I both found these to be a little bit more cooked than we typically like to eat our beef.  They had great flavor, but for a place that says they have a private butcher I was surprised to receieve a well done burger.
Pulled Pork: The pork itself was very good, but it needs a little something.  Some more acid in the cole slaw would help contrast the flavors.  The onion rings that came with it were awesome! They should let you order a whole side of those! So good!
Mahi Mahi - Incredibly fresh fish!  The fish was so moist, tender, and flaky we couldn&#39;t believe that this came out of a midwest restaurant.

Service: Incredible.  Our server was so polite and check on us after literally every plate came out.  Towards the end of the night she actually comped our mahi mahi because she said that they were taking too long to bring it out and it was not fair to our dining experience.  YES! Some one that understands!  As if the food wasn&#39;t good on it&#39;s own, I will most definitely be back for the excellent service."

My wife and I were looking for a farm to table place to have a date night. I stumbled upon Union House via a friends Instagram. 

We walk in at 7:30 on a Friday and the place is about 1/2 full. Which was a bit alarming. I made a reservation thinking if I didn&#39;t there would be a long wait. This was not the case. 

We got sat right away and promptly waited 10 minutes before any server approached us for an order or explanation of the menu. 

When our server finally arrived she gave us the &#34;farm to table&#34; spiel and also said the food comes out when it comes out. Which I found kind of odd but hey ok. Then she leaves. Like leaves. Doesn&#39;t take a drink order or ask is if we have any questions. Just leaves. Almost mid sentence and it was bizarre. 

Now to the food. The menu is a sort of southern &#34;soul food&#34; tapas. Yea know fried okra and pulled pork. The wife and I ordered their Mac &amp; cheese, pulled pork sliders, and BBQ chicken sliders. 

All I can say about the food is meh. It was VERY underwhelming. The mac &amp; cheese couldn&#39;t have been anything more but some Velveeta and bacon bits, and the chicken sliders had pickle on them which was not listed on the menu. If it was I would have asked them to skip the pickle like I did with the pulled pork. 

The pulled pork was good. No complaints. Apparently it has won them some awards at local cook offs. 

Overall the experience was really a let down. The wife and I won&#39;t be returning to Union House any time soon. I guess that&#39;s what I get for trusting an Instagram filter."

The menu is pretty limited and I don&#39;t know how frequent it changes.  We ate 6 things on it, so it was a good sample.  They were out of 2 things we wanted to eat, so perhaps they should just print out paper menus that can be updated.  We were strategically planning our food after all!

The first thing hubby noticed was how bright the lights were.  The first thing I noticed was that we were the youngest patrons in the place (I&#39;m 50) and lots of them were eating with their coats on.  They need something to block the cold air from the front door.  After we got past that, we settled in and checked out the menu.

First we had fried pickles and the grilled romaine salad.  Both were yummy especially the fried pickles.  Then we had shrimp hush puppies and the scallops.  Two thumbs up on that.  Finally we had the chicken wings and some duck dish.  The chicken wings had bbq sauce on them, but were crisp, like they had been under the broiler.  The original duck dish was not available, the flat iron steak was not available and the wings weren&#39;t available and then were.

All the food was good, but we ate about half the menu.  Our server was friendly and answered all our questions.  The owner was walking around and visiting with customers, but we didn&#39;t get a visit.  I&#39;m not sure why since there were only about 6 tables.

I would give 5 stars for the food, but I have to take one away for the lack of the updated menu as well as the environment.  That stuff can be fixed, so get on it!"

The size of each  plate wasn&#39;t that exciting for the cost but I guess that&#39;s why there called small plates. plus most farm to table establisments have that added premium.
I would definitely visit again."

We had the grilled shrimp skewers- over cooked with a tiny bit of sauce artfully displayed on the plate, nothing like another reviewers picture!  We also had the pork skewers, wonderful flavor but really tough, not sure what cut of meat they used but I suggest they start using pork tenderloin.  Lastly, we had the meatloaf sliders which was burnt slices of meatloaf on pretzel buns with cheddar cheese (not melted) tomato and lettuce, no sauce of any kind, they were very dry.  Could have benefitted with some barbecue sauce, maybe grilled onion too!
Our loss this time, theirs too since we won&#39;t be back....."

Some people say the prices are a bit high for some of the shared plates in proportion to what you get, but I say they aren&#39;t at all if you are comparing them to other small plates/tapas restaurants.  Yes, if you are comparing them to your typical bar appetizer fare.  But typical bar appetizers these are not!  They pride themselves in using as many local foods &amp; booze as possible and change the menu often to make the most of the seasonal fresh produce available.  Our server told us they opening in January of this year and have changed the menu 10 times.  Not to mention their weekly/daily specials they throw in.

We started with a couple of draft beers and shared the Crab Hushpuppies (4 hushpuppies, perfect for just the 2 of us), Pan-Fried Brussel Sprouts (I&#39;m a brussel sprout fiend!), and the Pulled Pork Sliders.  Everything was delicious with one tiny exception.  The 2 onion rings that came with the 2 Pulled Pork Sliders were incredibly greasy - we only took one bite each and passed on those.  But everything else was so very good.  The BBQ sauce on the sliders is a 3-time award winner and I can see why - just the right amount of smoky, sweet, tangy &amp; spicy goodness to really make those sliders POP!  The meat was plentiful &amp; smoky-seasoned and came topped with a hefty dollop of coleslaw.  All this was served on those amazing Gnarly Knot&#39;s pretzel buns.  And they say &#34;sliders&#34; but honestly this was a regular sized sandwich to us, definitely not the White Castle slider bun size you might expect.  It was $11 for these 2 big &#34;sliders&#34; so I would say that was definitely a damn good price.

Before tip is was $49 &amp; some change and we actually took a cup of the brussel sprouts home (hey, like I said, I&#39;m a brussel sprout FIEND &amp; those weren&#39;t going to waste!).  Not bad at all for some really great food in a cool pub atmosphere.  Our server was very nice &amp; helpful in choosing items on the menu.  In fact, everyone there was very friendly and we overheard another server dealing with some difficult customers (they were right behind us &amp; that couple was definitely being quite difficult) and their server stayed perfectly cool, patient &amp; upbeat the entire time."

I&#39;ll try to keep it short. Great location, great staff, lots of options for drinks and beer. And thus 2 stars to cover those areas.

As for the food, the menu holds a lot of promise, but the taste of almost everything was so bland I had to get the menu again to check on what I had ordered. I think the chefs ideas are in the right place, but the lack of flavor made me wonder what went wrong. One the extreme other side was the doughnut bread pudding. Made with a glazed doughnut is was beyond being way too sweet. Teeth hurtingly sweet. I would recommend a regular doughnut instead. Back to the food I would recommend a touch of salt in some areas. I believe the shrimp in the shrimp and grits was was cooked perfectly, but the grits were bland. Just add a pinch of salt to wake them up. Now someone tell me that I missed on the menu that this was a salt free restaurant and the rating jumps to 4 stars.

I would get a drink here any time and it would be a nice place to take a date for drinks. For food I&#39;ll have to pass. For that food it like to sit down with the chef and go through each recipe and see what we could do to make them sing and put a line outside the door.

This place is so close to being great. Flavor people, flavor!"

My girlfriend and I have been here 4 times now since Union House opened. We were excited that there was a tapas restaurant in Winfield near us. Good food, a little overpriced for the quantity IMO, but we still paid happily the first two visits. In our first two visits the food was great, and the servers were friendly, knowledgeable, and provided great service. 

The reason for the poor rating is the next two times we have gone back the service was mediocre and nonexistent,  respectively. We went to UH about a month ago and it took a good 5 minutes before our waitress greeted us (she had walked through the section multiple times, but did not say anything to us), and our service continued to be slow the entire night. I think the waitress may have been new, so I could look past it. However I couldn&#39;t help but notice that several other tables had people sit down after us, receive drinks before us, and receive food before we had even had been asked for our order.

This past time though, last night around 7 o&#39;clock,  was by far the worst.  My girlfriend and I came in and were greeted and seated by the host, the one positive experience in the visit even though he only had one menu for us. In the next 10 minutes that we sat there we watched each waiter/waitress, the same host that sat us, and whichever manager/owner that was working the floor walk past us multiple times, about 2-3 times on average without offering us water, taking a drink order, or saying a word to us. One waitress walked by us (I started counting after the first two times) 4 times, checking on each table adjacent to us while seemingly ignoring us.

The manager/owner apologized to a table right behind us for slow service and then walked away without saying a word to us when seeing we had nothing on our table (we had been sitting there about 8 minutes at that point without a server greeting us or being given water). The restaurant is not very big (about 15 tables), the place wasn&#39;t full, and there were 5 employees working the floor. I&#39;m 6&#39;6&#34; and we were seated at a table right in the middle of the restaurant where each employee walked past frequently, yet it felt like we were invisible to the staff. In the restaurants that I have worked at, regardless of whether you are a host, a server, or the owner if there is a guest sitting for more than 60 seconds without getting their drink order taken there is a problem.

After sitting there for 10 minutes, seeing two other parties sat, given 2 menus for each table, and served drinks while being walked past 10+ times by servers/management without a word to us we left. No one said anything to us on our way out, and I wonder if anyone besides the host even realized we were there. We ended up going to caliendos next door instead. We live close, but I&#39;m not sure if we will be returning to Union House after this latest experience.

You have a nice restaurant, and we enjoyed going our first couple times when your restaurant first opened.

These past two visits have not been good experiences due to the poor service we received, and I felt compelled to write a review.  In that review I complemented you guys for those first couple visits, but also gave my honest feedback on our last two visits.

It is disappointing to see that instead of using your time to utilize feedback to improve your business, you choose make sarcastic comments back to a repeat customer.  And to think, I almost felt bad about leaving this review being a waiter for years.

It is not surprising in the least that your restaurant isn&#39;t full on Friday nights, and I will be sure to share my experience with friends and family after your unprofessional response.  Have a good one and good luck!

Grab a manager before posting. Pretty simple... cant fix things for you ex post facto. In your line of work what if  this happened to your business?"
union-house-american-kitchen-winfield,Michael P.,RiHzaKx9cfVv6Qh-VbNhRg,"Seattle, WA",0,1,0,6,43,xAqGsMwXJ1iDmpxYP_UVBw,1.0,2014-10-12,"Terrible, simply terrible.  This would easily be a negative rating if allowed by Yelp.

My wife and I, ex New Yorkers who have frequented top restaurants in NYC and Europe, have been around the block.  We&#39;ve eaten at establishments where the food preparation was pure perfection, quality was at its peak, impeccable service.  Union House is none of those, but with the prices charged come off as one that wants to be.

We went out on a Saturday night around 6:30 pm, most of the customers were at the bar and not eating (warning sign).  Our server, who was a bit green, came out and blundered through the specials, and wasn&#39;t completely helpful.  No water was offered, none brought out, however he did bring the table next to us water as soon as they were seated.

Beer list wasn&#39;t bad, mostly locals and nothing too challenging. Prices were a bit high for drafts, 1-2 dollars more than what the pour ended up being.

We started with the fried Brussel Sprouts (special) and the Crab Hush Puppies.  Both were overcooked, clearly the fryer oil temp was well beyond 375.  If the restaurant was packed I could understand bumping up the fryer oil temp to balance out the orders, however with maybe 3 tables that wouldn&#39;t constitute a rush.  The burned sprouts were flavorless, oily - literally oozing oil, which is a fete when you consider that would happen when the oil wasn&#39;t hot enough.  The hush puppies were also under seasoned, the sweet sauce completely un-necessary and an odd pairing with the fried dough.  These were burned on the outside, under cooked inside.  Where the &#39;crab&#39; was in the mix I couldn&#39;t tell, so my guess is lower-end crab or more likely canned.

We were both surprised while asking the server about the meal options - the Mac and Cheese, even without adding the bacon, had bacon fat incorporated into it, so that was out.  The Shrimp and Grits, for some bewildering reason, had the grits cooked in chicken stock.  Why ruin the flavor of the grits with stock?  Nobody cooks grits with stock, you do it with water, then add in your flavor profile depending on the overall dish.  IF anything do it with a mild seafood stock.  Only other option was to take the Sea Scallops for her, I went with the burger.  Another strike against the restaurant, this burger only came well done due to there being bacon ground in with the meat.

My wife&#39;s scallops came out first - which shouldn&#39;t have happened.  In a good restaurant (or in any) the burger would have been fired first and while the burger rested you fire the scallops.  I sat there waiting for my burger for another 5-7 minutes.  

The scallops were insulting.  The owners have some gall pricing out THREE scallops for $18.  A pound of 10-12 count scallops would run around $18 for people not in the food industry.  These were probably pre-frozen so you know the mark-up is insane.  No vegetables, no starches, just 1/4 of a shaved apple.  The scallops were clearly under-cooked.  Do the &#39;chefs&#39; even know how to pressure test scallops?  My wife got through 2 before giving up.  My burger finally came out...on burned toast!  The potato chips were also overcooked, under seasoned.

The burger...where to even begin with this.  The bacon was a terrible choice for a protein combo.  Serve the bacon on top or do something like a bacon-infused cheese, hell put it into the bread dough!  There&#39;s a freebie for the chef.  The meat was only &#39;juicy&#39; thanks to the fat in the bacon, otherwise this was beyond what anyone should eat meat at.  The giant smear of pimento cheese was disgusting, tasting of canned cheese.  No vegetables, no condiments on the burger so that went down dry and hard.  Couldn&#39;t even make it through the 15 chips on the plate due to the overwhelming burned flavor.  Burger was also overpriced at $11 for maybe 4-6 oz of meat, more toast than burger.

We were not offered dessert, table behind us were offered.  The check came out and we were shocked to see a total of $80, considering the service and low quality of the food.  Dropping four bills or more at David Burke or Le Cirque wasn&#39;t a problem but this...we were flabbergasted.  Left there with a lowered bank account total AND still hungry!  

We promptly went out and got more food someplace else.  Avoid this place like the plague.  If you want to drop that kind of money go to an actual restaurant not a place that&#39;s striving to be a &#39;new American gastropub&#39; that totally misses the mark."

The service has been spotty...The brownie sundae wasn&#39;t to bad either. . My only complaint if I had to have one was the one time I order the scallops they were not very good and to expensive to try again.  The outdoor seating is nice on a nice day. I think I&#39;ve ordered just about everything on their menu. Overall good food and vibes.  FARM TO TABLE WHEN POSSIBLE.

Concept: fancy bar food. There is one thing on the menu that is flat AWFUL: this &#34;salad&#34; made of tasteless, cold, wet zucchini and goat cheese. Yuck. I had the server take it back. The food is ok. This is not really an ideal place for kids, though they are welcome. I say this because of the menu and the fact that it is a bar. If the owner wasn&#39;t such a nice lady I would have given this place three stars. I am sure she is hard pressed to find people who know how to cook. The menu needs to be re-worked and new kitchen staff need to be hired. Menu is trying too hard. Suggestion: do simple standards well, then branch out. We go to DuPage Hospital across the street about 2-3 times a year. I doubt we will try this place again, though."

Service was excellent (thanks Rachel!) and food was better than expected.  We started with the fried pickles.  I&#39;m not usually a huge fan, but my friend loves pickles, so I figured I would give it a whirl.  They really were excellently executed and the breading was light but had so much flavor (hint of cayenne?).  We also had the hummus, which was quite a large portion with plenty of pita triangles...I thought the introduction of peanuts into the hummus would be weird, but turned out to be a nice, unique touch!  

We next had the chicken fried chicken.  WOW.  Two large cutlets pounded thin, beautiful crispy breading...again, not too heavy.  The light country gravy and fried egg a beautiful touch.  Mashed potatoes good, but could use a bit more seasoning.  A steal at $11!!

We split a piece of the chocolate pecan pie.  Was good, but I think would be better warmed up and maybe with a little ice cream instead of whipped cream.  Just a personal choice.

One other small suggestion is for the martini glasses.  While the glasses on the bias are cute, it was kinda annoying when I spilled some of my $11 worth of Grey Goose over the lip of the lower end.  Again, nothing that I would take a star away for.  The restaurant and the bathrooms were spotlessly clean.  A+!"

I had expected a southern (Charleston region) influenced menu based on what I had heard of this place, but I had not counted on the small-plate concept.  The downside to this is that dining here can be a bit pricey if you arrive with a good appetite; but the plus side is that you get to enjoy a lot of different flavors and experiences.  We enjoyed the fried pickles, crab hush puppies, hummus, mac &amp; cheese, pork sliders, shrimp and grits, firecracker shrimp, and more.  I also really enjoyed their &#34;Grown Up Root Beer Float&#34; as well as a good craft beer.

So we checked yelp tonight and there it was.  4 stars, &#34;southern food&#34;.. ok, how bad could it be right?  We were expecting nothing more than 3 stars.  We were tired, and didn&#39;t want to cook.

So we get there, parking is pathetic because it&#39;s on a corner adjoined to an L shaped parking lot and it&#39;s right next to the tracks in downtown Winfield.    We got a seat no problem.  It&#39;s a tapas place, with xl size plates.  Tonights special was pork belly. I have never had anything so delectable, crispy, savory and sweet at the same time.

The gulf shrimp was grilled on a skewer simply served with lemon.  Delicious.  The desert was a carrot bunt cake with just the right amount of cream cheese frosting, and was as moist as can can get.

What an amazing meal.  Just to sum it up for you guys, $67 for TWO!! 4 tapas, 2 deserts, and 2 drinks.

We were looking for a place to go on father&#39;s day and I wanted good ribs. I read the reviews and thought it would be worth a try. This was our first visit to Union House. I called as soon as they opened and was told they had a limited menu but ribs were one of the entrees. They were not taking reservations that day but would get our group in when we arrived.
When we arrived the place was nearly empty and found a table big enough for our group of 5. The beer and drink menu was awesome...some drinks were a bit pricey but they were out of a lot of ingredients so we couldn&#39;t order some of them anyway. Not a great start.
My wife and I ordered the ribs, I a full slab and she a half slab. The kids stuck with the hamburgers and we ordered a grilled romaine salad and pita chips and hummus as an appetizer.  Both starters we good, the hummus was fresh tasting and perfectly seasoned. The salad was good, but not great. It had a weak smokey/char flavor and could have used more grilling. The kids enjoyed the hamburgers and the homemade chips.
Now the bad. The ribs. They were served pretty quickly, which should have been the first warning flag. The server put my plate on the table in front of me, and it was completely charred black with no signs of sauce or meat. Just charred black. At this point I should have sent it back and ordered something else, but I soldiered on. My wife&#39;s wasn&#39;t as charred but still very black. I started to cut into the first rib bone and the meat was so tough and dried it took a few tries to get through. The meat was like beef jerky and at this point I should have send it back. But I soldiered on still. I figured that it would get better as I got toward the middle. It didn&#39;t. It got worse. When you think of good ribs, you think of meat falling off the bone. This meat stuck to the bone for dear life and i had to chew if off.
So disappointed. The bill was $138.00 and it put me in a bad mood the rest of the day. I felt like we wasted good money and could have gone to Portillo&#39;s (I am not a fan of mentioning another restaurant in a yelp review, but this one deserved it) and spent half that amount and gotten decent ribs. Not sure what happened that day or why they would send out two ribs that were obviously over-cooked and were possibly left over from the night before and reheated.I should have taken pictures of the ribs (I will in the future) so you could see I wasn&#39;t making this up.
The good part. I am willing to forgive (but not forget!) and give them another try so I could see the full menu. (They did have a shrimp and grits I would love to try).  It&#39;s so hard to find a great rib place now a days in our area. I was hoping for this place to be one of them. I will suggest to them that they need better quality control, because there are a lot of great reviews for them, so that must mean they can turn out decent food. Customers are hard to come by, so they need to make sure each one that comes through the door is taken care of. Just as a suggestion, do with it what you will."

Given that this is a small plates concept, we tried nearly everything on the menu, and everything was delicious.  Everything is also farm-to-table and as local as they can get it according to the staff.

Fried Pickles, Crab Hush Puppies, Hummus, Mac and Cheese, Pork Sliders and BBQ Chips, Shrimp and Grits, Steak, Firecracker Shrimp...and a few more dishes that I can&#39;t remember (we ate a lot).  The Pork Sliders, Shrimp and Grits, and Crab Hush Puppies are still on the menu today, all three were delicious and worth going back for. 

The other thing worth mentioning about Union House is while the draft beer menu was small, it had good craft selections.  

The food was great but the service was even better, so we&#39;ll definitely be returning."

I sincerely can&#39;t believe we have this in Winfield.  We are city transplants and regularly drive back in to the city on date night to visit our old favorites and to try new places with friends.  In all sincerity, Union House rivals any high end popular eating establishment in any large city. Between the 4 of us we sampled over half the menu and everything that came to the table was better than the next.

Yes, it is &#34;small plate&#34; but it is substantial.  If you are not familiar with small plate eating just go in with an open mind, the expectation of ordering 2-3 items per person depending upon your appetite, and sharing.  Its fun and you get to taste many delectable flavors. 

The beer list is impeccable as is the service.  The root beer is out of this world (its beer - that tastes just like root beer). The owner is delightful and checks in a few times to make sure you are well taken care of.  We brought our little one along and she made sure she was well fed, despite there not being a &#34;kids&#34; menu - and well fed she was!

The prices are in line with the quality and flavor of the food and was worth EVERY penny.  We had the best dinner we&#39;ve had in a VERY long time and are seriously quite simply amazed.  Out of this world!  Bravo, chef!  Thank you!\"

Folks that frequent places like Ruby Tuesdays and Applebee&#39;s will feel a bit lost in a place like this. 

I live close so I am happy to have Union house as a dining option! I hope that the locals get it,  and that there is a draw for those looking for a dining experience rather than pulling your chair up to a trough.

Despite others assertions,  I actually was surprised to see rather large portions* coming or way.  Each plate had an ample amount for two to share and savor.  Great timming between each plate,  and my fiancee and I were borderline full after only 4 plates ... and some great beer.  *When I say large,  I mean large for small plates/tapas.

The food was great.  Highlights were the beur blanc drizzled over the brussell sprouts, scallops cooked to perfection and the shrimp on my shrimp and grits was the most succulent and silky I&#39;ve ever had. Ever.  Not kidding. I am sure they were butter poached or something naughty like that then perfectly seasoned.

The chef has great energy. And I hope he keeps it up."

I always have the mindset that tapas won&#39;t fill me up-I&#39;m wrong every time. I was full and also had the satisfaction of numerous different plates. Pulled pork =yum. The crab cake hush puppies are amazing! Server was very attentive with drinks. I noticed it started to rain outside and they had no problem getting outside seaters indoors. The table next to us was very loud but once they left we had a very enjoyable time. It&#39;s crowded-but its a small place. Whatcha going to do? Will come back again and again!

I met a few friends for a round of drinks and some apps. We decided to try the whole menu. Okay, maybe I&#39;m exaggerating a bit, but the 3 of us tore through a good chunk of the menu. The stars of the show? Fried brussels spouts and the shrimp and grits. Outstanding. The fried pickles were tasty, if not a little too oily. Overall, I think Union House is a fantastic addition to the western suburbs dining scene. While UH serves &#39;small plates&#39;, it is a fun place to share tastes of different dishes.

First, let me start with the food.  We ordered the fried pickles, the bourbon pork skewers and the pork sliders with a couple beers.  The pork skewers were extremely tender and flavorful.  I have to wonder what Robert S. was referring to in a previous post, because in out case, the flavor of the pork and the homemade sauces on both items were excellent and memorable.  The sauce that created the flavor in the sliders won a 3rd place award out of 600 participants in The Glen Ellyn Smoke Off last year.  It was obvious to me living down south for while that Mario and his mother have created a good thing to build on here.  The sandwiches were so good that my wife and I will definitely be going back for a full dinner next week.  We try to go out to dinner once a week and while we like to try various restaurants, we are very picky about where we repeat our visits to.  This one goes on our repeat list!!  We absolutely loved it!!  Note, I should mention that the pork in the sandwich was smoked right outside the previous day and the pork on the skewers was marinated for 48 hours.  In addition to the sandwiches, they come with homemade chips that are simply outstanding!!  I wish I had a bag of those chips with me tomorrow to watch The Super Bowl!  (I&#39;m not joking). 

The other thing about this place is the atmosphere.  While the setting is small overall, they do a nice job at creating a southern restaurant like environment that allows you to feel relaxed and in the moment to enjoy a special occasion.  In addition, they have a wall in their hallway that is a tribute to local military personnel that have served our beloved USA.  

Great job guys, and thank you for making our date night nice.

As a tapas restaurant the portions were larger than most other tapas places and very reasonably priced.  And the taste is just incredible.  We tried the mac and cheese, the scallops, pork belly, and the pulled pork sliders.  Everything we had was fresh, full of flavor, and filling.

A restaurant that only serves local healthy food prepared by a real chef!

Experience: I went with a group of friends on Saturday, we made reservations and were promptly seated as soon as we got in.  All employees were super nice, and seemed to care/enjoy their job.  That&#39;s always a huge plus in my book.  The restaurant itself can still use some sprucing up, but I can let that slide since it just opened.

Service:  Service was OK.  Drinks and food all came out at different times, a couple orders were forgotten.  Once again, not a big deal to me as I know this is a new place and I&#39;ve worked retail all my life.  A for effort, C for results.

Food: The food tasted great.  I could definitely taste the difference in the food served here compared to a regular restaurant.  I had an appetizer and the flat iron steak.  The presentation of the steak was good, and it tasted fantastic but came later than the rest of the groups food (ordered medium rare).

Value:  This is my largest problem with Union House.  Maybe I came in with the wrong expectations, but I LOVE to eat.  I understand that this is a small plate restaurant, in which you are supposed to share, but how can a friend of mine share his chicken plate when there are only two drum sticks?  It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me that this type of food be served on small plates.  I would personally enjoy spending much more per plate, and getting much more food.  If I could have gotten a larger serving of the flat iron steak, with an appropriate side, I would have been in heaven.  I hope in the future that something like this may be offered here at a higher price point, I&#39;d have no problem paying.

Conclusion: I like the idea behind the real chef and the local farm raised food.  My biggest gripe is the portion size.  Maybe this is just my personal preference, but I like to receive a large plate filled with food, and I expect it at certain price points.  If you enjoy smaller plates with great tasting food, then this place is for you, if you like to leave a restaurant feeling full/sated than I&#39;d recommend a different location.  I don&#39;t see myself revisiting this location in the future unless larger portion sizes are offered in the future (I don&#39;t mind paying more)."

I think that I have slowly worked my way through the menu here.  I have had Chicharrón, Butifarra, and Lomo Saltado.  Those sandwiches are fresh, tasty, and delicious.  I did not think that I would like sweet potato or fries on my sandwich, but Peru loves potatoes.  I guess that I do too now.

The chicken fried rice is amazing.  I always try to stay on my diet and not get the fried rice or maybe eat a little of it.  That just never works.  It is too good.  I put a little extra hot sauce in it and my mouth starts to water.

I have had the fried plantains there too.  In the past, I have never liked fried plantains because they are usually soggy or greasy.  The owner/chef makes them crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  It shows just how great this place is - something as simple as a plantain done so well.

The owner/chef and his mother seem to do everything here.  They are very friendly and attentive.  You pay at the counter and there is seating.  It may be more of a lunch spot, but I go for dinner and it is not crowded.  I pray that he remains healthy and gets some kitchen help so he can keep making these great sandwiches, fried rice, and sauces. Yum. Yum. Yum."

For a very fair price, SanguChe serves up loads of fresh Peruvian eats and stuffed sandwiches that are sure to please the masses. While the place itself is straightforward - expect no frills here, clean tables, clean bathrooms, a soda machine, and a handful of tables - the food is complex and full of flavor. I went with the Aji de Gallina: shredded chicken in a creamy yellow aji pepper, peanut and basil sauce, served on a French Roll with slices of sweet potato and hard-boiled egg. Per SanguChe, it&#39;s mix of Spanish and Peruvian flavor. For me, I saw peanut sauce and sweet potato and said, sure, that sounds great. 

And it was. It wasn&#39;t a flavor combo I was used to, but it was a nice mix of salty sweet and tender chicken. My dining mate, Jacqueline B, ordered a size of fried rice (arroz chaufa) and it.was.enormous. For $3.50 a normal sized human could easily fill up on this generous portion. 

SanguChe has something special here and I hope they keep it going!"

I&#39;ve had SanguChe bookmarked since the day they opened and finally just came here for lunch with Nicole W last week. They&#39;re located in my no-so-favorite Naperville area due to the construction and traffic that is always happening at North Aurora &amp; Route 59. With that being said, I have no problem heading this way for fantastic food from places like SanguChe and their nearby neighbors Fire It Up.

SanguChe is a small, casual little shop with probably like 5 or 6 tables. At 11:30 am on a Friday they were mildly busy. I think there was one other group dining in, but plenty of folks popped in to grab lunch to go.

As I perused their menu which is written up on a chalkboard, the Chicharrón sandwich caught my eye. This beauty on a bun is made up of their traditional Chicharron (which is pork butt that is braised then fired in its own juices) served on ciabatta roll with slices of sweet potato, salsa criolla relish &amp; drizzled with fresh parsley mayo. 

I think those toppings pretty much speak for themselves, but in case you need more direction, it&#39;s basically AMAZING. Such a unique flavor and a way more exciting lunch option then the usual boring old sammie. Their menu describes the Chicharron sandwich as their influence of African culture from the South of Lima.

To accompany my sandwich I ordered a &#34;side&#34; of fried rice (arroz chaufa). It&#39;s appropriate that I put the word side in quotes because IMO this is nowhere near a side - and I&#39;m not complaining! Their order of fried rice is huge! It honestly could be a meal in itself (and for only $3.50!). This rice is just as delicious as it is plentiful, let me tell you.

Definitely plan to eat my way through the rest of their menu. Great lunch spot."

I am so glad that I did! When you walk in, there are 5-6 tables, there is Peruvian music playing, and the environment is cozy. We asked the chef (who turned out to be the owner, more on him later) what he would recommend and he said &#34;try the chicharron.&#34; We ordered that and the adobo de cerda. In addition, we ordered a side of empanadas and fried yucca. An older lady (the chefs mom) brought our food to us. She started with the empanadas. The empanadas was filled with meat, raisins, and a relish. Weird combo, but it worked and tasted amazing. Then they brought out our sandwiches. These were the best sandwiches we have had in long time. The bread was perfectly toasted and the flavor of the sandwiches were nothing I have experienced before. Finally, the fried yucca was the weirdest choice on the menu. Turns out, yucca is a thicker version of a potato (a potato on steroids). It came with a mustard sauce on the side and this out any French fry to shame. Towards the end of our meal, the chef/owner came out and ask us how our meal was. He was extremely friendly and you can tell he enjoys what he does! We plan on eating our way through the menu!"

I had the chincarron which is a pork shoulder sandwich &amp; it was excellent, freshly cooked, it&#39;s not a fast food place so give them a few minutes. 

The people were very nice, they gave me a free appetizer, fries yucca with mozzarella melted inside yum. 
The place is very clean &amp; bright, &amp; they have the Wall Street journal on the tables for your reading pleasure.

Overall it was a very nice experience. 

The only criticism I have is its a little on the pricey side. The sandwich &amp; an order of fries, no drink &amp; not including tip was a little more than $11, more than I like to spend.

He&#39;s got about 100 tattoos. I have zero. He has a ton of TV shows. I have zero. He&#39;s got a red classic car and other ones, too. I have zero.  

But in addition to having better hair than Guy, I have access to SanuChe. He does not. At least not yet. But he may. If I were him, I stop in as part of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and give this place a test drive. 

SanguChe is family run and very welcoming. Peruvian artwork adorns the walls along with photographs of people enjoying Peru. There is also some Peruvian jewelry for sale. It all works very well to take what would be an ordinary, strip mall vibe and add some life and energy to it.

The menu is clear in its explanations of the dishes. I went, however, with something off of the menu after conversing with the owner. He recommended a filling of meat, olives, onions and other seasonings and things wrapped in a potato and then deep fried. It was served with pickled onions and a hot sauce and it was awesome. The olives complemented the meat filling and the pickled onions and hot sauce made the dish a smash. Even without the hot sauce, the dish was terrific. I don&#39;t know the name of it, but if you ask him for it, he will definitely know what you want. 

I also went with some fried Yucca. The Yucca was stuffed with some mozzarella and served with another sauce, also delish. For me, the appetizer was waaaayyyy too much food for lunch but it was mighty tasty. 

My only complaint is that they don&#39;t serve unsweetened iced tea. I don&#39;t really go for pop or lemonade so that was a bit of a bummer. But they do offer water and that works just fine.

This little place is in the same strip mall is Fire It Up, another place I&#39;ve grown to really like. Support this business. These people are cooking with their heart and soul. And if Guy Fieri stopped in, I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;d say the same thing."

This beats subway all the way!! It was my first time here and not my last. It&#39;s a taste of Peruvian cuisine. I had the Milanesa and my friend had the Adobo de Cerdo.  My Milanesa was tasty although it needed more sauce and heat because I love spicy food! All the sides are al carte and drinks too. Close to the Naperville 59 train station.

I&#39;ve never experienced Peruvian food, but I&#39;m willing to try anything at least once. So I looked over their menu and was immediately drawn to the Lomo Saltado. Containing strips of sirloin that have been sauteed in vinegar, garlic, and soy sauce, this sandwich is constructed beautifully with flavorful meat nestled on a soft french roll and garnished with red pepper, onion, and tomatoes. Topping it off are french fries and a delectable spicy aji panca. I was sold.

The decor at SanguChe is simple yet clean and inviting. There is a fountain drink machine but you can also order  Peruvian colas. There are five tables adorned with small, minimalistic centerpieces. It&#39;s a very casual, low-key establishment, but don&#39;t let that deter you from experiencing the fabulous food. The menu is small (seven types of sandwiches, including a quinoa burger option) but in a world where menus are diverse and overwhelming, I appreciate the simplistic approach at SanguChe. Still not convinced? You can build your own sandwich as well.

The gentleman who took my order (I believe it was Cesar) was extremely nice. He offered me a taste of the hot sauce that came with my sandwich and wow! That sauce is a creeper! At first you taste flavors and no heat but then spiciness kicks in. That&#39;s my kind of sauce, bring on the heat!

So the sandwich itself is nothing short of uh-may-zing!  The meat, the soft bread, the spicy sauce, the red peppers, everything was so fresh tasting! I was sad when my food was over. 
I opted for no side with my sandwich,but I certainly would like to try the rice. I also plan to try the Adobo de Cerdo sandwich on a future visit. The food and great service exceeded my expectations. I look forward to returning soon!"

Being a foodie, the concept of a Peruvian Sandwich Shop is something so unique that I had to try it out for myself.  The place is small and comfortable and tucked away in a strip mall.  You wouldn&#39;t even know it was there if you didn&#39;t hear about it from somewhere else.  That being said I&#39;ve tried three of the sandwiches here and each one I had was amazing in it&#39;s own right. 

The other thing is who can argue with the price point? They also have something for everyone here as they have a pretty good vegetarian quinoa burger to offer.

Of the sandwhiches I&#39;ve tried the Steak is my favorite but the Chicken and chicharron aren&#39;t far behind.  I&#39;m not a big fan of the fried rigce but I love the fried yucca.  Also the Inca Cola is a must.  If you&#39;re a fan of going off the beaten path, this place is a must."

I couldn&#39;t take a picture of my sandwich because I devoured it. The sandwiches may not look like much but the flavors are out of this world. I got the Chicharron and I have to mirror what another review said. It was definitely one of the tastiest sandwiches I&#39;ve had in my lifetime. The sweet potatoes and the pork was so delicious. The salsa criolla relish that comes with it was also amazing. I poured it onto my sandwich. So excited to come back and try other things!

We had one of each of the sandwiches, fried yucca, and the fried rice. All were very good!! The photos show the Steak &amp; Chicken on Ciabatta but the normally come on a french roll, both are good.

The fried yucca is like a big potato in terms of what it eats like. They give you a great dipping sauce to go with it. The fries are &#34;FreshCut&#34; or handcut as they say. One thing I&#39;d love to see is a selection of hot sauces to put on the sandwiches when you dine in. At home we did Sriracha &amp; Tapatio which were both great to spice it up a bit!!

We will be back!!"

After eating SanguChe&#39;s Chicharrón, (with their hot sauce!) I fully understand her. I would wrap up a single bite and bring it home too. That sandwich should never be wasted!

So good in fact, I feel like I should go to every sandwich shop I&#39;ve ever reviewed and deduct a star from those reviews because after eating here, no other sandwich I&#39;ve ever eaten could deserve a 5 star. 

My husband clearly felt the same way as I. He had barely finished his Lomo Saltado and was already intensely studying the menu to see what sandwich he was ordering for the next time we come here!

The sandwiches here are delicious!  I wish we lived closer to enjoy them more often.  The owner/chef is incredibly nice and very helpful if you have questions about the menu. You can tell the meats for their sandwiches are slow roasted or braised for a long period of time as they are all very tender &amp; oh-so-flavorful with just the right amount spices/seasoning.  The last time we visited the Hubs &amp; I split a sandwich and an order of the Peru Poutine - more than enough food for the two of us.  

I recommend getting the hot sauce for the sandwiches on the side if you haven&#39;t had it before and they typically will ask you this just to be sure.  It&#39;s a unique hot sauce and I have no idea what is in it but it&#39;s very flavorful &amp; packs quite a punch - a little goes a long way.

In my opinion the only thing holding this place back is their location but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s because they are a new place &amp; need to keep their rent low.  I&#39;m certain if they were on the main stretch of 59 or in downtown Naperville then they would be packed."

I was definitely impressed and will definitely be back.

The meat in both sandwiches was hot and had good texture, not dried out or greasy. The vegetables were all fresh and the bread was good. 
I  have absolutely no idea what the saices were but they were both delicious and mild.... nothing spicy but very flavorful.  
 
The fried yucca was like the best, super crispy steak fries you&#39;ve ever seen,  but they are more dense than potatoes. ... do yourself a favor and enjoy them BEFORE you google nutrition information on yucca. 

The proprietors seemed really nice and the place was clean. I&#39;d definitely recommend it.   The only reason I can&#39;t go with 5 stars on the review is that A- I&#39;ve only been there once, and B- it was a little expensive.  Not too bad considering the quality of the food but it should either be a buck or two less per sandwich or the sandwiches should be a little bigger. Fairly priced though...... I&#39;ll raise the rating after going a few more times if I keep having good experiences."

For a location and set up that is so simple, the tastes and flavor of the food sure isn&#39;t simple.   

I had the Adobo de Cerdo, a pork shoulder sandwich.   Great ciabatta roll, cool and crisp shredded lettuce and tomato slices and the spread was creamy with a great amount of spice and eventual heat.   The fried rice on the side was tasty as well-very simple with just eggs and green onion and not oily or greasy.   They brought me a side of salsa, which was great when mixed with the rice-a smooth medium-hot sauce that kicked it up well.

Perfect for lunch in that the portions are good but not too much and the food is fresh and ample but not heavy at all.  Their upcoming 4 course dinner looked good from the menu-check the website for details.   I&#39;ll likely update my review in the future as I know I&#39;ll be back!"

I say this with caution because this type of venture seemed risky (in this casual reviewer&#39;s opinion).  First off, there are no Peruvian restaurants west of the city.  The location is in an obscure strip mall off of Route 59 and away from the bustling Fox Valley area.  And, if someone is looking for a more traditional Peruvian experience, this is not the place to go because its a sandwich shop.  That being said, I certainly did not leave disappointed.  I&#39;ve tried several Peruvian eateries (from high end restaurants to casual bistros) and have been to Peru, so I&#39;m familiar with the cuisine and culture.  While not &#34;traditional&#34;, the brightness of the food, the Peruvian-themed photos of the walls, and the pop/rock music in Spanish made me reminisce about my short time in Lima.

But enough of the nostalgia, let me talk about the food:  SO GOOD!  I got the quinoa burger and fried yucca.  Friend got the chicharron (braised pork) sandwich and Peru poutine with aji de gallina (shredded chicken in cream sauce).  I didn&#39;t know what to expect with the quinoa burger, and was surprised to find that the patty had more of a seitan-like texture.  The sandwich also had a slightly sweet taste to it which gave it a fresh and bright taste.  The chicharron sandwich was also really good.  The chef (who btw was wearing this festive Pisco Sour apron) offered a sample of the chicharron before ordering.  This chicharron is not fried pork skin (which is what I thought chicharron was) but thick slices of deliciously braised pork.  Both sandwiches were very flavorful and also very filling.  Both my friend and I are healthy eaters, and we were both stuffed and satisfied.  

Their regular fries are good (they are the type that have peel on them like Hot Doug&#39;s), but to really kick the meal up I recommend the fried yucca.  Usually I find fried yucca to be bland, but these were nicely fried and seasoned.  It was served with a creamy sauce that tastes similar to the aji de gallina sauce.  Peruvian food, in general, is not as spicy or tangy las other Latin American foods.  The Peru Poutine is a fun take on &#34;fries topped with stuff&#34;.  We got ours with aji de gallina, and it was topped with sliced hard boiled eggs and green onions.  This was a meal in itself, and we had to take half of it home.  

The price is a bit on the pricey end ($7-9 per sandwich, $11 for poutine) but honestly these prices are on par with the frou frou, hipster-friendly places in the city.  And I think the price warrants the uniqueness and quality of the food.  Also, South American enthusiasts may be a bit disappointed to find that the Inka Kola they carry is the American version, and not the bottled cane sugar version we&#39;ve all come to know and love.  But listen--Peruvians are notorious for bragging that they have the best food in the world.  The chef, as evidenced in the restaurant and on their website, is proud of the food he has created for this shop.  And in this casual blogger&#39;s opinion, they have every right to be.  Its simple but flavorful, modern but authentic, unique but familiar.  Sanguche is a great addition to the culturally-limited options of the western suburbs."

I didn&#39;t know what to get, so I asked for suggestions. The man suggested ceviche. My husband said he wanted it, and I said I didn&#39;t like seafood and asked again. He recommended something... I don&#39;t remember the name, but it was a fried potato ball stuffed with hard boiled egg and ground beef.

We weren&#39;t impressed. My husband didn&#39;t like the ceviche. It was serve with beans and a boiled sweet potato, and my husband said it needed something to mellow it out. And said it wasn&#39;t fresh. He didn&#39;t finish it, which is shocking for him. I got the potato ball, and it was cold in the center, which was really disappointing. It was tiny. I would have needed three to make a meal. I ended up giving it to my toddler, and it was perfect for him! Great size and perfectly cold. 

I went back up and ordered the Peru Poutine with Cicharron. The fries were amazing!!! The sauce basically tasted like cheese sauce. The meat wasn&#39;t very flavorful or tender. It would have been better with a shredded meat, and I wish they would have recommended that. It was a good portion, too. My husband and I enjoyed it, but it wasn&#39;t really special."

Besides that, I don&#39;t have any criticism. This is one of the absolute best restaurants I&#39;ve been to in Aurora/Naperville. I&#39;ve never had Peruvian (or Peruvian-inspired) food before, and after trying the wonderful food at SanguChe, I really regret that decision. While many of the dishes here do contain meat, they are wonderful about dietary restrictions which makes this place a great vegetarian/vegan spot.

I got the Quinoa Burger and the fried rice. Both were absolutely delicious and well portioned. I typically hate veggie burgers that go the &#34;sweet&#34; route rather than the &#34;savory&#34; or &#34;spicy&#34; routes, but I was really loving the sweetness of whatever topped the burger. I think the only thing that could have made the burger better was if the party itself was a bit spicier to give a bit of contrast to the sweeter topping. But really, I can&#39;t complain. The fried rice was totally solid - a delicious accompaniment to an already delicious meal. Typically, they make it with chicken, but they were very happy to accommodate a meatless request.

The service is wonderful, the restaurant is clean and spacious, and the food is divine. Chef César Chang hit the ball out of the park. I can&#39;t think of a better possible addition to the restaurant scene around here. I&#39;ll definitely be back."

It&#39;s a small-ish place in a strip mall.  Decor is very basic with 5 tables, various Peruvian pictures on the walls along with what appears to be somebody&#39;s old wooden fence along the one wall.  The menu is on a big chalkboard above the counter/window where you order.  They have about 8 sandwiches to choose from (or make your own) along with a few sides.  
The place is very clean &amp; service was very nice/friendly, albeit  a little hard to understand at times. 

After perusing the brief menu &amp; wanting to not risk getting anything spicy out of concern for my co-workers &amp; the ozone, I ordered the chicken milanese samich and split the Peruvian Poutine with pork with my friends.  The sandwich, share of the poutine &amp; pop came to about $16.  Li&#39;l  sticker shock at that initial cost in my opinion.   They have Pepsi fountain pops &amp; only 1 size, 12 ounce cup.  We were told to take a seat &amp; they&#39;d bring the food out. 

All the food was brought out separately as it was done, which was a bit unusual but I get they want you to have it as fresh as possible.  The Peruvian pork poutine came out in about 5 minutes &amp; was fantastic.  The pork was thinly sliced, flavored wonderfully with a lighter cheese  sauce &amp; nice, fresh, hot, soft fries.  The ONLY ding I have on the fries was that they needed a little salt to me.  

The milanese samich came out a few minutes after the poutine.  The bun was extremely fresh, soft and big.  The chicken was hammered very thin &amp; fried and came with small, thin fried taters and basil-y mayo and some other seasonings.  I thought the samich was very good but not blow me away good.   I&#39;d have preferred the chicken to be a little thicker and juicier.  I didn&#39;t think the samich alone would be filling but it was!  I did eat all of it but my pants and diet  are wishing I hadn&#39;t.  

All in all, this place is very unique and a bit pricey, but also very good and extremely filling.  There are a few minor things I&#39;d like to change but  I definitely look forward to coming back &amp;  trying their other tantalizing samiches in the future."

I had the quinoa &#34;burger&#34; with fried yucca (note: the sandwiches don&#39;t automatically come with fries/yucca/etc. - it&#39;s a separate charge), along with two different yellow sauces. I believe these may be huancaina, but I&#39;m not 100% sure - one was very mild with no kick, and the other was very spicy with ají (chile). I used both on both the sandwich and to dip my yucca fries in - delicious!

I loved the way the quinoa burger tasted with the purple cabbage. I&#39;m not a big fan of super thick bread (mine was on ciabatta), but with the sauce, I didn&#39;t mind it. The yucca fries were SO GOOD - I went in thinking I was going to get &#34;regular&#34; (potato) fries, but I&#39;m so glad I went for the yucca. I found myself eating those up before I even got to my sandwich, and ended up taking the second half of my sandwich home as a result (even though the fried yucca portion was reasonable/not big).

They also had little alfajores (a little shortbread cookie &#34;sandwich&#34; filled with dulce de leche/caramel and topped with powdered sugar) for sale the day I went in, so I tried one - I didn&#39;t really care for it, but to be fair, I only really like the dulce de leche part (just thought I&#39;d try it again).

They also have a few free-trade items for sale in the corner of the restaurant, as well as various pictures of people in Peru and especially Machu Picchu. The people working that day were super friendly and nice, which definitely encourages me to come back!"

If you&#39;re in the area, you have to go and try this place out. They have a variety of delectable Peruvian sandwich selections. My friend and I split the Chicharron, Lomo Saltado, and an order of the Peru Poutine with Adobo de Cerdo on top.

All the meats are super delicious. Both sandwiches were great. However, we preferred the flavors of the Chicharron sandwich. The meat was tender and the sauce in the Chicharron brightened up the entire sandwich.

The poutine was also really delicious with the meat definitely being the highlight of the dish. My one big complaint would be that the Huancaina sauce drizzled on top was a tad bit salty.

Also, be sure to try out an Inca Cola. Apparently, it&#39;s a Peruvian type creme soda and it&#39;s sweetness goes well with the salty, savory sandwiches. 

The space was a little bit sparse feeling. A few table scattered in a dining area that probably could&#39;ve been packed with a few more tables and chairs actually. The order-at-the-counter format is quick and easy. The menu is simple. And the restaurant definitely has a down home feel with down home food that the owners are passionate and proud of.

I will be back to try the other menu items and would recommend this place to anyone in the area."

This place is delicious and an unexpected treasure. Family owned, clean, and a little taste of Peru. I have had multiple sandwiches there but my favorite has to be the chicharron. And no this is not Mexican food...so what they call chicharron is totally different. The pork is so tender, and the flavors...just amazing. Fried yucca is fried to perfection and the little sauce it comes with is delightful. If you like things spicy, ask for their hot sauce. Not only is it spicy, but full of flavor. On Sunday&#39;s they have tamales...which are different from the traditional Mexican or Puerto Rican kind. Highly suggest you try them. Don&#39;t forget to get the little cookie sandwiches. So light and flaky with sweet in the middle-the mothers recipe :-)"

I eat out a lot and sometimes it&#39;s hard to get excited about the usual dinner fare.  What a wonderful surprise to find that there is a whole new (to me, anyway) cuisine - Peruvian!  

Since Peruvian food is so new to me I really don&#39;t have any idea what we ate - I had a delicious steak sandwich.  My wife had a pork shoulder with pickled red onion and sweet potato sandwich.  The fried yucca was an interesting new flavor; but probably the biggest surprise was the chicken fried rice.  Simple, Subtle and incredibly delicious. 

The chef was friendly, helpful and overall made us feel welcome - even if we were a bit clueless."

I pass by this place almost every day after coming from the train station and I&#39;ve had it on my list of restaurants to visit but after over 100 Yelp reviews at 4.5 stars, I could no longer hold off.  Very nice couple as owners.  Got to talk to them a little while I was there.  Asked them what the most ordered item was and they mentioned the Chicharon.  I come from the Philippines and this is a specialty there as well so I asked what the next most ordered item was.  Got the Lomo Saltado to go.  They have a small seating area but it wasn&#39;t packed when I got there around 6 pm.  I think most people order to go?  Anyways the sandwich tasted like Filipino steak my dad makes but instead of eating with rice...it was on a bun with some French fries stuck in-between.  I love my dad&#39;s cooking so this hit the mark.  Very tasty.  The meat was a little thicker and very tender.  My maybe only complaint is it could have had more meat for a $9 sandwich but you certainly can&#39;t beat the taste..  I will definitely go back and try the rest of the menu.  I also saw an Adobo item which is also a Filipino food so can&#39;t wait to try that.  Benefit is it&#39;s so close and on the way home from work so I&#39;ll hit it a lot sooner next time.  It&#39;s a unique flavor so you gotta go!"

When I pulled up, the open sign was flashing, so I proceeded to walk up to the door noticing that I arrived close to an hour before they opened. The two workers in the back let me inside anyway and even offered that I eat inside after I insisted multiple times I could just take it to go since they weren&#39;t officially open yet. At this point I was already very pleased by the welcoming and homey vibe from SanguChe. 

I decided on the Lomo Saltado sandwich(Sirloin sautéed in garlic vinegar and soy sauce) and was not disappointed. It came on a French roll that was toasted to perfection and topped with tender sirloin topped with fries. The flavor is amazing and not something you can really explain to those who have not tried Peruvian food. 

I definitely got the fee of one of those small fusion restaurants in the city and almost forgot I was in Naperville. It&#39;s nice and cozy and everything about this place is great, along with the service and attitude of the employees. Hoping this place stays around for a while and I will definitely be back!"

We found SangueCHE from a friend&#39;s Facebook post and decided to do takeout for lunch today. So this review is based on that. I will update once we eat in the restaurant. We were especially curious about SangueCHE as we will be visiting Peru next month.

We both selected the Chicharrón (PORK) from their menu on the web. It tasted every bit as good as it looked. The salsa Criollo could have been a bit more present, but otherwise the rest of the sandwich pleased, especially the pork with crispy edges and the parsley mayo. We will be back!"

It&#39;s practically across the street from my apartment and I&#39;d had a full day of doing nothing. It was close and Yelp said it was a good idea. It was so damn yummy that I woke up this morning wondering if fried yucca was a breakfast food.

I have absolutely no experience with Peruvian cuisine, and I won&#39;t pretend that I do. My first SanguChe meal was the Aji De Gallina sandwich ($8) (thanks to the suggestions of other yelpers). A french roll piled with shredded chicken, yellow aji pepper, sweet potato, hard boiled egg and sauced up with a peanut and basil sauce. In a word, fabulous. I&#39;d never imagine such a sandwich combo, but now I can&#39;t imagine a world without it.

I also grabbed a side of fried yucca ($3). It came with a yellow sauce that reminded me of the aji sandwich, but I&#39;m not entirely sure what it was. I mean, it was frickin good so I didn&#39;t really question it.

I&#39;ll be going back for lunch today, but I&#39;m trying the Peru poutine next!"

The food is delicious and though the dishes such as a quinoa burger and milanesa are seen at many restaurants , the Peruvian flavored really shine for a completely unique meal. Both the quinoa burger and the fried yucca were the best I&#39;ve had. My friend ordered the milanesa and loved. However , he did say that it&#39;s a bit heavy with the sauce if that&#39;s something you&#39;re concerned with , but it&#39;s easily adapted as the food is all made in front of you ( not in a Chipotle or Subway fashion, rather it&#39;s just possible to see into the kitchen).

But there wasn&#39;t really anything that seemed distinctly peruvian. The beef was seasoned well and it was good food but it really wasn&#39;t much different than just a good steak sandwich. And the fries with beef was simply the same beef on top of nacho cheese sauce. Calling nacho cheese by a peruvian name is still just nacho cheese. Good flavors. Tasty. But was not the peruvian experience I was hoping for. I have no additional knowledge of peruvian culture or food as I did before I walked in.

It was interesting to learn about the influences and see that portrayed into the menu.  My husband is always skeptical when trying new foods/cuisines, but we ordered 3 sandwiches to share and they were all different, but equally amazing.  We ordered the Milanese, Lomo Saltado, and the Chicharrón.  We also tried the fried Yucca, which was like big potato wedges, but were crisp on the outside and soft in the middle.  They came with a delicious yellow sauce.  

Every order is made fresh to order.  The service is excellent and you can see the passion for the restaurant from the owner, Cesar.  

The feel of the restaurant is family-friendly.  There are some photos of people in Peru, along with some jewelry and decorations from Peru (and maybe other countries) that are for sale in the corner.

The fried yuca with salsa a la huancaína is amazing as well. My husband&#39;s favorite is the chicharrón, but between the two of us we&#39;ve tried all of the sandwiches aside from the quinoa burger.

I did have a little bit of trouble finding it - It&#39;s got a sign on the street, but I couldn&#39;t find the right strip mall building at first, so if you have to drive around a parking lot twice like I did, don&#39;t give up!  It&#39;s worth it!  I got takeout on a weeknight for my husband and I and didn&#39;t call ahead, but it was very fast service.  The restaurant is pretty bare bones and on the empty side, so my guess is they do a lot of takeout business.  If this place was on grubhub, I would probably get delivery constantly.  We had the chicharron and the aji de gallina sandwiches with the fried yucca and the rice.  Everything was pretty good, but I would probably skip the fried yucca next time.  They were prepared really well - crispy outside, nicely salted, with a good, creamy/garlicky dipping sauce, but they just weren&#39;t really my thing.  The chicharron sandwich was the star of the show.  The pork is crispy and salty, with nice bite from the pickled onions (I don&#39;t even like onions) and sweetness from the sweet potato.  We also got the cookies at the register (on another yelper&#39;s recommendation) and it was like shortbread clouds.  So good!

Please, please, please go to this place.  It was very empty when I was there (weeknight takeout) and it would be a crying shame if a place this unique, delicious, and fast went under.  You won&#39;t regret it. Next time you&#39;re thinking that you want something fast, skip Chipotle and try local instead!!"

What a nice change from one of those big chain burritos or a common torta. But this was not Mexican.  After my first experience with Sangu Che Peruvian Flavors, it&#34;ll be hard to go back to those other places.  Why would I?  The lomo saltado was incredible, and the chef took the time to acquaint me with his work; the sauces, the secrets of great French, or should i say Peruvian, fries, the drinks, and how Peruvian food is head and shoulders above Chilean food.  He was so excited to talk about his food you know he puts the same enthusiasm and care in his cooking.  It showed.  I&#39;ll be going back soon, next time with lots of friends."

Let me give you my experience here :

It&#39;s a rainy afternoon and I just got out of yoga... As I walk through the door I&#39;m greeted by smiles, hellos and a board of pictures of people at Machu Picchu! I start to gander the menu and see aji de gallina, lomo saltado and chicharrón - all famous Peruvian dishes I&#39;m well aware of :) (I&#39;m thinking at this point this is too good to be true) and of course it is for me since I&#39;m a newly vegetarian. Wahhhhhhhh... so I figure I can start with the fried yucca and maybe a salad. Oh no, no, no ... Cesar, the nicest chef around, catches wind of the fact I don&#39;t eat meat and offers to whip me up a sandwich of veggies! :) :) :) 

Now I&#39;m thinking this could go wrong. This could go terribly wrong since I&#39;m already well aware of how rich these food combos can be- tomatoes marinated with cilantro, onions and lime, olive sauce, eggs, aji sauce .... But fear not because Cesar really knows what the heck he&#39;s doing in that kitchen- the first bite and taste buds exploded- ( it took me back to Lima, Peru- literally). You wonder why there&#39;s no picture with this review? Because I devoured my sandwich and sweet/spicy/peanut coleslaw (seriously an awesome spin on Asian Peruvian fusion and American slaw)... I also washed that down with fried yucca and huancaina sauce(best dipping sauce ever), part of a tamale and an alfajore(the first think I ate)... Let&#39;s just say my belly and heart were extremely satisfied. 

Now I can&#39;t sit here and give all the credit to the food because anyone can cook - I mean, I cook Peruvian food, and yes it&#39;s hard, but it can be done! But there is some serious talent here. Cesar is not only from Peru but has moved around the U.S. cooking at various places. His concept of sandwiches on these famous dishes is genius and you won&#39;t be left wanting more. All the food and ingredients are fresh and prepped each week, which is not easy, if you&#39;ve ever cooked these dishes. Cesar also does a great job explaining this food to newcomers as I asked how overwhelming it must be for people who have never seen this stuff before. Hearing his story made the experience just that much more awesome and his and his mothers hospitality and friendliness made me feel like I was in their home (how it normally is in Peru too!) Thank you again for that :) 

All and all, this little slice of paradise has something for everyone. I recommend the lomo saltado (steak lovers) or chicharrón, Salchipapa for the kids, Plato del mes for the drunkies and tamales for the brunch goers. Again, you really can&#39;t go wrong and if you&#39;re still lost don&#39;t be afraid to ask Cesar- he won&#39;t steer you the wrong way! Keep up the good work Sanguche - my new favorite place!

No frills, cooked with love and taste profiles that are complex and reflect truly authentic Peruvian food. Chef Cesar, who is Peruvian, and his mother have brought a new, vibrant taste to the suburbs. 
The sandwiches are out of this world. The meats- chicken, pork or beef are all tender, flavorful and well portioned. The Aji de Gallina a shredded chicken dish as a sandwich is awesome. My other favorite is Chicharron, a pork butt sandwich with meat that melts in your mouth. The same is true of the sirloin. 
Another authentic dish is Peru Poutine which is your choice of meat over hand cut fries smothered in Huancaina sauce. It is absolutely incredible. 
This place is low key, with great food!!!!!"

Like lick the paper in the basket for every last bit delicious! The owner and who I assume was his mama were there. They were both incredibly helpful. They recommended Yuka fries and they were incredible. The dipping sauce with it was almost too good to be true. I needed more fries. Honestly I would have dipped a stick in it. So tasty.

The outside isn&#39;t very inviting but in the end, that really doesn&#39;t matter. I looked at their menu and was surprised to see how small it was. They only had three sandwiches and everything was an add-on. I ordered the Aji de Gallina (two of them) and when they were given to me, they were too salty and the meat seemed like it had been out too long. We ordered separate fries and drink and the total was nearing 30 dollars. In my opinion, for that kind of money, I&#39;d rather go to Red Robin (only two miles away) and eat a great sandwich or burger with bottomless fries. Don&#39;t waste your money here."

Hinsdale is not my normal path in life, I found myself with an hour to kill and in downtown Hindsale, so I walked past CiNe and was pulled in by the wall of tequila and other indulgences behind the bar.  
I had a patron margarita. They were both top notch. Made with care and presented with class, these drinks did not have any pre made electric green mix - just fresh good lime and tequila."

After having several bad experiences more than a year ago we have had 4 occasions to return in the last couple of months. Much, much better. Some of the best service we have ever had. Attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. Food was out of this world and even cocktails were way better. Two thumbs way up..,, we will be back.

7/21/16- Cine had become one of our standard &#34; go to&#34; places over the last year but again the service is starting to suffer. The place was empty last night and yet we had to repeatedly search out our waitress &amp; finally went and asked the hostess for our check. Not that our waitress wasn&#39;t pleasant just not trained or up to the task. 

The food is again slipping. Some days quite good and others a &#34; C&#34; at best. Inconsistent . But it&#39;s the service that is going to be the death of Cine if they don&#39;t get solid management &amp; a well trained staff in place."

Their cocktails and margaritas are fabulous. If you&#39;re on the spicy rage, get the jalapeño cucumber margarita. It will burn your throat but ahhh so good!! 

I like how they have all kinds of homemade sauces and they put their own spin on Mexican. I like to call it New Mexican. The enchilada had a brown sauce that was rich but also slightly sweet with a hint of cinnamon. The marinade on my steak taco was also well done with a tangy and flavorful pop.

All this would give them 4 stars but what pushes it to 5 stars is the AMAZING service. They made fresh chips for my friend with a gluten allergy and he didn&#39;t even ask for it! They were attentive, and our waitress was super friendly. She was also very knowledgable and catering about the drinks.

If you&#39;re in the west suburbs looking for spicy or just an awesome New Mexican place, try here!"

It looks like a smaller version of Carnival with its colourful decor and fun atmosphere. I went on a week night when it wasn&#39;t very busy but the service was still slow. Cine hit the spot for my mexican food craving. Got free chips and salsa and a free churro when I checked into yelp. Ordered the mahi mahi, chicken quesadillas and the steak and chicken fajitas. For dessert we got the tres leeches cake, I liked it. The mahi mahi had a great presentation but failed to deliver in taste. It wasn&#39;t horrible but it wasn&#39;t as fresh and light as I prefer it to be. Their virgin mojitos were a little too sour. The chicken quesadillas and fajitas were pretty good.

The first time I had the chicken tinga tacos I was amazed. I couldn&#39;t wait to order again, so I did. Twice. Each time was a joke. The first time I ordered pick up and they messed up my order, I had to wait like 20 extra minutes to get it fixed. The girls at the front were so annoying. Jumping at the bit to seat people and completely ignoring me and my requests for them to check the kitchen. Ridiculous. Then I get the correct order and the food was bad. Not worth a cent. 

Today I had to order again because the kids wanted tacos. Worst mistake. First off I asked for no beans just rice with the tacos. The girl said &#34;ok so you want double rice instead of the beans it comes with&#34; yes, I want that. Great, food comes she sends me two sides of rice for $3 each, $6 worth of rice for the garbage. Such a joke. 

So they tell me the driver will come back and give me a refund. Waited two hours, finally got my refund . The delivery driver was super sweet and awesome though, so props to him. 

It&#39;s nothing but a hassle dealing with these people. Save your self time and money.


I will vow never to come back to this place and anyone who asks me about good Mexican food will be quickly steered in the other direction. BYEEEEEE CINE!!!!!!!!!!"

They truly lack customer service.  Yesterday we went in for dinner and my daughters were given a children&#39;s menu (piece of paper) which said &#34;Kids Eat Free Every Sunday&#34; and below it is a drawing that says &#34;HAPPY FATHERS DAY&#34; for the kids to color.  At first I wondered if the Kids Eat Free would be on Father&#39;s day however given the kids menu was made for Father&#39;s day and Kids Eat Free was included I assumed it was.  I should have asked as when we received the bill and questioned they stated &#34;oh not on Father&#39;s day&#34; with no hesitation and no apology, etc.  If this was the first situation I&#39;d let it go but it always seems to be something.

Location is great being right across from the Metra.  The service is top notch.  Javier took care of me the first time and the chef&#39;s son the second (I didn&#39;t know he was chef&#39;s son but was complementing how great the food was the last time and he confessed that is his dad) and both were outstanding.  The decor is really interesting.  The bar area is fairly standard but a good sized bar.  Then there are two separate dining rooms with difference types of decor.  The one to the right has very bright colors and I really think that is cool.  The other is a bit more neutral.  I&#39;ve never sat in either since I opt for the bar area.  I wanted a spicy margarita and they don&#39;t have one on the menu but they made me one with muddled jalepeno that was really solid.  The chips are very warm when they come out, which I quite like.  The salsa is decent although not the star.

I got the three ceviches and wow.  I really enjoy ceviche and to many spots get it wrong.  I don&#39;t want something swimming in citrus and don&#39;t want cooked seafood thrown into lime juice.  All three were truly outstanding.  The portion sizes were appropriate for ceviche as well.  The camaron was nice and spicy and the mahi mahi, which I thought I would like least, was my favorite.  The scallop one has baby scallops that were really tasty.  My husband got the tacos and that is his go-to at Mexican places so he is a good judge and said these are really great.  I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d like the quesadillas because I prefer some good chunks of veggie in mine like onions and peppers and these were more high quality meat and cheese but they were very good.  The tortillas were light and crispy and just really well executed.  This is definitely my favorite Mexican restaurant in the suburbs and rivals the best in the city.  Flavors are very well balanced and very much pop.  The food speaks for itself but the service is stellar as well."

We arrived at 4pm, and it was pretty empty (just the way we like it.)  it was the perfect place (and time- early evening) to come for a romantic, quiet meal. 

We sat at a booth, were served margaritas right away (not the best I&#39;ve ever had, and a little small for my liking, but very tasty nonetheless.) 

The chips and salsa were fresh and flavorful.

For an appetizer we had the shrimp ceviche, which I was glad we tried, but I&#39;d opt for something else the next time around.  

We also ordered (and split) the gigantic arugula salad which had sweet potatoes, golden raisins, tomatoes, strawberries and Mamey dressing. Sounds like a weird combo but it was AMAZING &amp; I want more now.  I love that they didn&#39;t skimp on the salad dressing. 

Our server timed the food perfectly and we were able to eat everything calmly. She also checked on us just the right amount of times, which we liked.  

For dinner we had a stuffed pork dish (stuffed with apples and sweet potatoes, I believe) 
The dish came with rice, mole sauce and plantains. I was excited when I read on the menu that the dish had plantains but disappointed when I only saw like three small cubes of plantains on the rice.  I got over it quickly, though because the flavors in this dish were fantastic.

I can&#39;t wait to come back and try different dishes!"

Food was terrible. Service was even worse. I&#39;m not even sure I can call it service when almost no one came by the entire 2 hours we were there. We hardly ever saw a single waiter even though I noticed maybe 10-15 of them existed while walking back to the restroom. Not quite sure what they&#39;re up to, but it&#39;s certainly not waiting on tables. Also the food somehow took about 20-30 minutes even though no one else was ordering and it should be fast to cook up tacos and a burrito bowl. My burrito bowl fell short of even chipotle, and at twice the price. How they feel they can charge a premium for the worst Mexican food ever I&#39;ll never know ($12 for a burrito bowl). They serve it up with a weird hostile attitude, to boot.

We went on a Saturday night and didn&#39;t have to wait, but it&#39;s best to make reservations if you want a nice booth. They have valet service as well. Free wifi if you ask server for password. Staff is very friendly and helpful to provide suggestions. 

Large menu- I ordered sangria to start which was very refreshing. We also got the spicy pomegranate margarita on the rocks which was delicious but definitely spicy. Would have been nice with mango or something to balance it. Table comes with homemade crispy chips and mild salsa. They can make guacamole at your table for $12. We ordered large side for $9 and it was fine but I like it mild. 
We got chicken fajitas and cine steak- both amazing. Flank steak had poblano crema and it had a warm pepper flavor but not to spicy. Both come with rice and beans. Fajitas came with lettuce, sour cream, and tomatoes but very small portion. 
For dessert you can get free churros for checking in! We also got the tres leches cake which is the best! Too small portion in my opinion but it was so soft and full of flavor.
Classy and modern ambience. Definite perfect date night if you&#39;re craving Mexican food."

We are at CiNe on 2/6/16, a party of 4. 
3 out of 4 people started violently vomiting several hours after leaving the restaurant. They were sick for about 24 hours. 3 out of 4 people ate the ceviche trio. I called the restaurant &amp; left a voicemail. No one returned my call. I called again on Tuesday. Spoke with the manager, Luis. Luis said he spoke to the chef who told him we couldn&#39;t have got sick from the ceviche because it&#39;s fresh &amp; the seafood cooks in the citrus juice. Well then someone must not be washing their hands at CiNe. It doesn&#39;t take a genius to figure out if 3 out of 4 people get sick who dined at the same place &amp; consumed the same food that might be the culprit. No apology, no accountability.

Unfortunately, the food was not good at all. The group I was with had a carne asada, enchiladas de mole, crepas de tinga and combo #1 which included a tamal, taco, and enchilada.

The presentation of the food was nothing impressive and the flavor of all of these dishes was bland. The rice was tasteless, the flour tortillas used were not authentic to the Mexican dishes. Sadly, we didn&#39;t enjoy the food. So much so, that I didn&#39;t want to take any of my leftovers. 

Being Mexican and loving Mexican food, I guess I expected an authentic Mexican meal. Although this was not to my standards in sure others based on the reviews loved it. Just wanted to share an honest review from a person that enjoys Authentic Mexican food."

The service was pretty slow because they had an all-in-one person (waiter, host and bartender) serving five separate tables at the same time. To make up for the slowness, we did get complimentary chips and guac/salsa. That was a plus.

I ordered three steak tacos off the lunch menu for $10. Now, I understand lunch portions are small, but I didn&#39;t realize that lunch portion sizes applied to tacos too. I&#39;m not kidding, but the tacos were the most expensive I&#39;ve encountered and the smallest sizes I&#39;ve ever seen. The tortilla was the size of a person&#39;s palm.

Cine is simply a forgettable experience. I first tried cine out after they had just opened. I have been a half dozen times since and used to be that they had really creative food and most importantly innovative cocktails.

We started with a trio of empanadas (pork, veggie and beef), which gladly the waiter identified because they looked identical. They were all tasty, if not terribly self-identifying. The pastry was flaky but not greasy. Ultimately I preferred the beef filling.The sprinkle of cheese offset it nicely.

We went on to the tacos; an order is four, and you can split it 2 and 2 if you want flavor-wise. I went for the pastor and carnitas, and he chose the pastor and veggie. 

I definitely preferred the pastor, with its pineapple tang and spicy hit from the jalapeno. The carnitas was a little too one-note, and made me wish that I hadn&#39;t chosen two pork options (not that it was bad). 

I had a bite of his veggie but wasn&#39;t thrilled with the potato croquette that forms the substantial base of the taco.

For dessert he had the special: a guava tamale, which he really liked; I had a bite, but since I do not care for tamales it just was not the dessert for me -- even with the guava it was too bland, and the grit of the cornmeal put me off. 
I enjoyed the tres leches cake I ordered, though it was not the best execution I had ever had. 

I had also chosen a margarita, which was very good -- light but with an enjoyable twang of citrus; oddly, it was only salted on one side? 

Service was swift and smooth -- so swift that we weren&#39;t done with our appetizers when the food arrived and they were trying to take the dish, which also happened at the end of the meal...the place wasn&#39;t full; what&#39;s the hurry?

At any rate, this was an enjoyable example of nouveau Mexican. It&#39;s a ways from me and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d make the trek specially to visit, but if I was in the area I might go again."

Cine took over the space that used to be the Hinsdale movie theater.  It would have been amazing clever had they made seating in what used to be the beautiful interior of the actual 1925 movie house.  Instead they only utilized the front/lobby portion of the building.  Decently decorated.

That said, beware of any restaurant that refuses to list their price online when you click on the menu tab.  Invariably that means $$$$.  Yes, they use elite tequilas, squeeze their own juices and make their own sour mix.  Good - fine.  It still doesn&#39;t justify $13-$18 for a four ounce drink.

Suffice it say that the food is - sincerely - just Mexican fare.  NOT expensive to make nor innovative in any way.  I&#39;ve had much better - much cheaper.

Our bill for four people, two of whom had 2 margaritas each and we had one drink a piece was $225 before tip - and believe me, we really didn&#39;t eat a lot. Nothing extraordinary.

I was born in Hinsdale. We were a working class family surrounded by wealthy neighbors.  I really like my home town but just because there is preponderance of multi-million dollar homes doesn&#39;t mean the residents are stupid enough to pay for this mediocre fare.

CiNe is a welcome change. The food is absolutely delicious, the service warm and attentive, and the menu full of interesting dishes to explore.

We ate guac chips and salsa and the guacamole was great. Perfect amount of flavor. We also ordered the Aguachile ceviche along with the Tinga Tostaditas.  The only complaint I have with those is, &#34;I want more!&#34; :) 

For entrees we just shared the tacos. They were good I just wish they would be a bit warmer when brought out.

Pros: I really enjoyed the pineapple margarita which was sweet yet smokey from the mezcal in it. The chicken enchiladas with salsa verde were also very good. 

Cons: We sat at the bar and service was insanely slow despite the fact that the restaurant was only about 15% full. We had to ask for our chips and guac (count &#39;em) 5 TIMES. When they still didn&#39;t arrive before our entree we had to go back to the hostess stand and ask her to get them for us. We were also not given utensils and had to find the server stand and get them ourselves. Did I mention I got the wrong order? They were able to correct it in about 5 minutes but still worth noting.

Well just take a look around if your Spanish is not up to snuff.  CiNe is for cinema- perfectly apropos given the location of the newest addition to the Hinsdale eating scene is located in the old historic theater.

Enter on 1st street (plenty of street parking or there is a lot across the street or in behind) under the old marquee area.  Inside- you may be surprised, as I was, as to how large the space is.  A bar runs the length of the front room on the right hand side with plenty of high tops on the left.  And as you proceed toward the back the eating areas get more intimate and there is even a &#34;party room&#34; in the back that will seat 50 of your closest friends for dinner or 70 standing for a cocktail party.

But back to the real star- the food!  We ordered a wide range of the menu as is normally the case when I check out a new place.  Our server, Diana, was just a delight!  It was kind of like being waited on by a new friend as she was quick with suggestions of her favorites, showed us proudly around the space and even shared some personal stories that had us laughing at the table!  Nicely done!

We started with the salsa and guacamole.  The quac was delicious with big chunks of avocado and a creamy texture that had us both reaching for more chips.

As for entrees- we tried three of them- the enchiladas, which were lighter than expected as they were done with a crepe base, the steak, plated with avocado creme, onions and some tortilla chips and the chille rellano- which was stuffed with cheese and served in a wonderful sauce.  Both were served with a small side of rice, peas and carrots which had the creamy consistency of a risotto.

And for dessert- the churros were a great sweet choice- with the chocolate dipping sauce the perfect complement.

And before I end- just a minute on the drinks.  They have a cocktail list so I ordered one of their signature margaritas.  This was a great choice as it was light (almost fizzy)- I kept looking at the list to see if they put carbonated something in it but that was not the case.  Just a premium tequila that I really liked!

CiNe is owned by the same people who brought Nabuki and Il Poggiolo to Hinsdale which is great.  Hinsdale has been devoid of decent restaurants for many years but now there are reasons to &#34;eat local&#34;.

Dinner for two with drinks ran about $100 which is probably more than you might expect to pay for Mexican but you can&#39;t go into CiNe thinking cheap tacos and burritos.  Rather- think of it as a nice evening out with upscale Mexican food served by some of the nicest servers around!"

cine-hinsdale,Uncle J.,4C5zuJRnzyfNeoaEffukrA,"Hinsdale, IL",0,1,0,0,117,PldwlLy-rapJpbc2k6ZPwg,1.0,2014-02-10,"On a brutally cold Friday, the three of us decided to stick close to home to grab dinner in town.  Shockingly, the other restaurants - Nabuki and Il Poggiolo - were full to the rafters but this place was only 30% full.

Hostess seated us, and waitress arrived quickly for drinks.  All looking good.

We ordered nothing special - two orders of Habenaro Soup and one order of Trio of Empanadas, which were very nice.  Guacamole as an extra to our chips was about a half cup, but really overpriced at $8.

I ordered the Alambre or Hanger Steak - it was tough, over cooked, and really nothing special at all.  It came with a side of cold onions, peppers, and a few bits of bacon.  This long boat-like stick of burned cheese held a table spoon each of pico de gallo, pureed avacodo, and barely warm black beans.

One of our party ordered the Enchiladas, shredded chicken a pair of interesting sauces and a side of creamy rice.

Unfortunately, our third party has a fish special over spinach what a sauce that fortunately was not my choice -- a taste of her dinner almost ruined mine.

No dessert, and two drinks each, and we ended up spending over $70 per person.  Now I know why the other customers are voting with their feet -- this is WAY over priced -- and no where near good enough to meet the price.

If cost is no object: it&#39;s not crowded, very pretty abiance, very loud, and acceptable wait staff.  However, I will not be returning anytime soon.  Aguamiel in Clarendon Hills will be getting my business."

This is upscale Mexican so don&#39;t come in thinking its Uncle Julio&#39;s. CiNe&#39;s interior is beautiful. And the bar is expansive. Several televisions also make it an ideal spot to watch a game.  We started with the house margaritas. Excellent, except too much ice. Chips and salsa came with the drinks.  The salsa is made daily and was spicy!  Loved it. Can&#39;t say the same for the guacamole.  At $8, the portion was small and tasted like something you could buy at Jewel--a disappointment. I had the chicken enchiladas which came in a cream like sauce. They were good, but again the portion was small for $18.  Dessert was very tasty. Children&#39;s menu available, but it would have been nice if it included tacos. Service (Lauren) was excellent, especially since we were there the first week.  

Overall, better than good. Just wish the portions were a bit bigger for the Hinsdale prices.  I shouldn&#39;t have to fill up on chips to feel satisfied. I will be back."

We went with another couple and had some apps and then some tacos. Guac was great. Tempura fried goat cheese was very tasty - but should come with a couple more pieces of bread for dipping. Ceviche was just so-so, mostly veg, not much fish, and the little jar it came in kept tipping over. Tacos were excellent. Al pastor was our fave but chicken and carnitas were also great. The whole menu looked amazing, can&#39;t wait to go back and try more. Drinks were very tasty too!  Oh and our server was awesome, recommended her favorites and the most popular items.

Margaritas were smooth and actually unique for a house drink. The quesadillas, steak, red snapper, tres leche cake and apple pastry for dessert were all deliciously fresh, unique in ingredients and sauces, and were some of the best Mexican food we&#39;ve ever had. They have a huge menu of food and drinks. The service from Jennifer our server was very attentive and she was very helpful making recommendations.

I ordered a burrito (no meat). They left out the beans too, so it was tomato, green peppers, loads of jalapenos, lettuce and goat cheese... it was really hot and quite honestly rather awful... They brought me a side of black beans to ease the pain... goat cheese in a burrito is not a good idea either... got the distinct impression that they try to be cool/inventive but the result is another suburban culinary disappointment... the margarita was tiny and mostly ice...  the city spoils us...

It is worth to mention the decoration of this place, very nice and not the typical loud colors associated with Mexican Restaurants, this place is very elegant , yet discreet.

The outdoor patio is very quaint.  The empanadas were really skillfully put together with lots of delicate flavors and textures.

The menu was so tempting, I ordered the Chili Relleno and have to say, the filling has to much of a gritting mouth feel to go with the el dante poblano pepper, and no flavor so just texture...which was awful, a disappointment. The sauce exceptional. would not order again this recipe needs to be reworked.  I also was disappointed with the rice served with the dish, not sure which ingredient in the rice was in the refrigerator too long, but it had a strong taste of &#34;refrigerator bite&#34;

I tried the CiNe margarita, which was wonderful, and my husband had the Prickly Pink, which was different, but very good as well.  We started with the guacamole and empanada trio--both good.  I ordered the chile relleno for my entree, and I have no complaints.  However, I will say that the best description that I can come up with for everything is that it was &#34;good&#34;...not much else to say.  My husband and father-in-law both ordered desserts, and both were decidedly unimpressed by them.  No complaints on the service nor atmosphere, but it was incredibly dark where we were sitting.

That is a sure sign that someone is posting bogus reviews. Maybe they don&#39;t like the owner, maybe they own a competing restaurant, but these are not real reviews. I find that very annoying because it is a great addition to downtown Hinsdale and I would like to see them do well.

I thought Cine&#39;s food was excellent and the atmosphere/ decor is really cool. I had the steak tacos which were perfect. The guac was decent and the margaritas were excellent. I do agree that the portions were a little light (especially the drink size which was like 3 sips) but that was the only negative. I&#39;ll definitely come back to Cine."

A couple of things to remember about Ciné:
1. Try one of their margaritas. Pineapple or spicy pomegranate are unique and taste great. 
2. The ceviches... Yum! Probably one of the best apps there. And with the latest menu updates, you have a possibility of trying all the different varieties the restaurant offers. 
3. The enchiladas or filet mignon (even though the restaurant offers Latino cuisine) are just fabulous.. I remember the first impression about the enchiladas (wrapped in crapes instead of tortillas).. You just have to try it. 
4. Keep some room for dessert. 
5. The staff there knows a lot about their menu. Ask them questions. And don&#39;t forget to learn some more about tequila and actually fall in love with the liquor. Ciné has one of the biggest selections of tequilas I&#39;ve ever seen."

While the ambiance was warm and inviting, the service was how this place first won us over.  Our waiter, Steve, introduced himself with warm enthusiasm (but not over-the-top or overbearing)!  After explaining that the chef of Cine is &#34;Mexican but went to school in France&#34;, we received several excellent French-inspired Mexican recommendations, of which we enjoyed:

Nachos: Truffle oil turns some people off (not us!) but this was a *huge hit* with a black bean puree, mild crumbled cheese, and an avocado mousse.  The best and like nothing else we&#39;ve had!  Plus we wouldn&#39;t have tried it without a recommendation, and I highly recommend it myself!

Enchiladas: Instead of traditional tortillas, the enchiladas come wrapped in crepes and topped with bit of sauce over the top (not drowning like the usual sort).  They had a bit of sweetness, but the savory filling and sauce brought them right back into a perfect balance.  Even better, they come with a  &#34;side of creamy Mexican rice&#34;, but it&#39;s more of a rich risotto lightly but warmly spiced.

Margarita Parfait: This we were told was a &#34;special&#34; dessert that was the first of its kind at the restaurant, with layers of a creamy margarita-flavored puree, lime gelatin, mint, and a light ponzu sauce at the bottom.  This is one of the few desserts that is without chocolate that I find acceptable, which is saying something!

Overall, a visit to this unique restaurant is an excellent experience you won&#39;t want to pass up!"

The thing I love about Cine is the all over the board types of food you can get from traditional to modern, but very unique at least in the ones we tried.  Our table of four all tried different things and everyone were big fans. We all shared a bit, but my personal favorites were the veggie tacos, the guacamole, and the churros y chocolate. The chocolate used for the churros is outstanding.

Went early on a Saturday night and it wasn&#39;t crowded.  Service was slow and you had to flag down the waiter for any service after the order was initially taken.  As to the drinks, the margaritas were good but of little volume due to the large amount of ice in the glass.

The guacamole was bland and the portion delivered tiny (about the size of golf ball) for the price.  My enchilada dinner at almost $18 was shockingly small, each of the 3 about the size of a small cigar.  Here too not even a hint of spice (Stouffer&#39;s frozen enchiladas are better).

Surprisingly, it is not an uptight place considering it&#39;s in the heart of the uptight town of Hinsdale.  The atmosphere is fun, colorful, and casual.  Great Mexican music playing.

The food was fresh.  Tacos--can&#39;t really go wrong with those--were flavorful.  I got the fish tacos and a friend got the skirt steak.  The skirt steak was tender, and not leathery as it usually is.  It had a good flavor and was marinaded well.  I actually enjoyed the guacamole and thought it was very fresh and simple.

Service was friendly and excellent.  Would definitely go back and glad to see a non-uptight place in this neighborhood."

Food was great and the service was great even though they were short staffed. Hubby ordered a prime rib by mistake instead of a rib eye and our server Katrina was so kind to swap it out for him. 

The glazed carrots are good with a hint of cinnamon, but they didn&#39;t seem glazed. Still tasty but would have loved to seen more glazing.

The grilled chicken with artichoke, mushroom and tomatoes was a tad salty but still delicious in the herb wine sauce ad the mash potatoes never dissapoint."

This whole experience could of been avoided if they would have told us this before we ordered and received our drinks. I ordered an appetizer to make up for the lack of bread and the chilly cheese fries came out with very little chili or cheese and the fries on one side were burnt black. I then made the mistake of ordering prime rib and whatever I received was definitely not prime rib. It was a well done cut of mystery steak served with the normal prime rib sides. When I pointed this out the waitress immediately grabbed my plate and said she would return with another one in a manner that made me suspect she anticipated my reaction. What was then brought to me was something resembling rib but in looks only. It was a tough and tasteless excuse that even a chain restaurant should be ashamed of. I&#39;ve had much better luck at the location in orland park the several times I&#39;ve been there and was deeply disappointed with the whole experience.

Forgot their slowness and ventured on in when too hungry!!! It took about an hour to get fed.

Tonight it was especially ruff!

We arrived at 8:40pm, after the dinner rush. We were told 10-15 minutes unless we wanted to eat at the bar, I prefer a table so we waited. There were 3 couples ahead of us and in the dining room there was around 10 tables open and I counted at least 8 servers on the floor. No biggie we&#39;ll wait... they start seating 1 couple at a time about every 5 min or so. A couple walks in and said they called ahead and 1 of the hostesses says it&#39;ll be 15- 20 min he gets upset and she says we don&#39;t do reservations but you are on a wait list and then proceeds to tell him he&#39;s late anyway for the time he called in for... uhm.. customer service much? 

We finally get seated in the bar at a table. Server comes and asks for our drink order, water with lemon for him and a unsweetened tea with lemon for me. She brings me idk what flavor tea it was I could see syrup swirling in my glass, look around she&#39;s no where to be found, 2nd hostess sees me looking and gladly takes it to switch it for me meanwhile server is back with bread, no small plates doesn&#39;t notice my drink is gone. 

We place our order... stuffed mushrooms. French onion soup for him wedge salad for me and ask her if prime rib is still available, she says yes so we both go for prime rib with baked potatoes. 

We get our mushrooms and they&#39;re awesome as usual, then our soup and salad comes... French onion soup tasted like it was loaded with sugar and the wedge salad was literally 5 leafs of romaine lettuce with the regular toppings, put it to you this way... there was more toppings than lettuce! 
As we are almost done with these the server shows up with a menu and says the manager just gave out the last piece of prime rib and we need to choose something else (at this point she is standing in front of my ice tea that has 1 sip left)...  did we not ask if it was available and she said yes... she didn&#39;t check just assumed... so now as our food should be coming out we have to choose something else. Fine, 2 rib eyes instead. My husband looks at me in complete disgust and says he&#39;s ready to walk out and go eat Taco Bell! 

So those come out and the plates looked so sad a hunk of meat and a potato. Where&#39;s the fresh veggies? I didn&#39;t bother asking. At this point my ice tea has been empty for 10 minutes and she finally comes and refills it. 

My husband took at few bites and asked for a box just from the disgust of the whole situation he&#39;s lost his appetite.  So I take a few more bites ask for a box and the check. Meanwhile I look and see a bunch of people waiting to be seated and I look thru the restaurant and it&#39;s over half empty tables. 

Get the check and see she put the soup and salad as our 2nd sides, we didn&#39;t ask for that to be done, we like our veggies! 

My husband said no tip and I being a former server and bartender can&#39;t do that, I know people live on their tips. So she got a tip but not a normal tip that we would leave. 

Side note: my husband had gone outside for a cigarette before the meal arrived and a employee just got off work and sat down on the bench next to the door took his shoes, socks and shirt off and was sitting there. 

So disappointed I don&#39;t believe we will be back at all. The 2 stars are for the mushrooms and the 2nd hostess noticing my issue with my tea."

Yeah yeah, rain down the boos.  Steak just isn&#39;t my thing.

The Bolingbrook location is no different - good service, clean restaurant, and really good grilled chicken.  It&#39;s probably never gonna be my first choice, when picking out a restaurant (though, honestly, I&#39;m never the one picking out where a group of us eat, since I&#39;ll eat anything)...

However the cook or someone managed to make the burger selection even worse by forgetting to add my Cheddar I&#39;d requested.    Bun looks like something you could get from Aldi&#39;s.

We love Longhorn, but this one certainly disappoints. Very limited bar with no bar tender in sight. I still don&#39;t know who mixed our drinks, but they were poorly done.

The wait staff really needs training.

My Strip Sirloin was thin, grey, and past medium rare by quite a bit. The bill for three was very confusing in the way the waiter allocated the ordered items. I&#39;m still not sure what we were billed for, but I do believe that it&#39;s correct."

Last night was not a bad experience, just have a couple comments.  I ordered the 7 Pepper Steak salad, without bleu cheese.  Got the salad with bleu cheese, and no dressing.  Even though I did not say I no dressing.  I figured I could scrape off the bleu cheese, which I did.   I mentioned this to the waiter, who didn&#39;t offer much of a comment.   I then ordered a second beer, Blue Moon.  The waiter brought me the beer, which did not taste (to me) like Blue Moon.  So he took it back, and tried again.  The second one also tasted weird, so I said forget it.  No offer of free dessert or something else to make up for these small issues.  Last comment, I ordered the side of grilled corn.  For $4.79, I got ONE piece of grilled corn that was not all that great-kind of soggy."

I eat here often when I want a good basic steak (think Outback or Roadhouse). It&#39;s close to home and I have not been disappointed. 

During my recent visit, the service was pleasant and well timed. The server recommended the Primetime burger to my son. It&#39;s a shaved prime rib, with mushroom and swiss. He absolutely loved it! I had a taste of the garlic parmesan fries served with it and they were also delicious.

My goto is the 20oz Porterhouse with a baked potato. Standard char fired faire. The salad and sides were pretty basic. Not bad, just nothing to write home about. The steak here is always cooked as ordered. I have never had it overlooked and that&#39;s a big plus+.

Overall, I think we had a solid 3.5 star experience. When we walked up to the hostess stand, there was no one there and we waited a while. A girl finally came to seat us and had to grab silverware and napkins for our table. The staff seemed unprepared. 

However, our waitress was friendly. She was prompt with the orders too. I decided to order a Blue Moon, and it came with a lime. I like Blue Moon for its refreshing citrus taste. Hot, crusty bread was also served, and my guests raved about it. 

Since I tried a steak at my previous visit, I ordered the chicken fingers. The breaded chicken pieces were generously seasoned. The chicken itself was tender. On the side, I had honey mustard dipping sauce. I could taste both the honey and mustard. I can&#39;t really gush about the chicken fingers, though. It was a pretty standard dish. My guests thoroughly enjoyed their meals. Everyone said the food was seasoned and flavorful.

Of all the chain steak places I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ve ever been to LongHorn. I was indeed looking forward to getting a phat steak and celebrating!

We both went for the 22 oz Prime Rib with 2 sides and bread for $24.49 (hey, if it&#39;s someone else&#39;s money why not go all out?!).  We knew we wouldn&#39;t be able to eat it all, but we didn&#39;t know it would be due to the challenging experience with the meat!  There was a ton of silver skin that needed to be cut off.  I&#39;m used to Prime Rib having a bit of fat; however, the silver skin just isn&#39;t edible or enjoyable to have to cut through.  Our knives were dull as well, so this didn&#39;t really help our dining experience!

I will say that the boy&#39;s Steakhouse Mac &amp; Cheese (corkscrew pasta, four cheeses &amp; bacon) as well as my baked sweet potato with cinnamon &amp; butter were both amazing!  We sat at the bar since the wait for the dining area was over 45 minutes.  The bartender on Friday night was great, though she was a little forgetful.  

I&#39;m sure there are some other good steaks at LongHorn, I just wasn&#39;t overly impressed with what we received.  It was an ok steak."

I got the tilapia with mango salsa and it was inedible.  Gross.

Another big problem was the service.  Our waitress was the slowest!  She messed up our order more than once.  She forgot my vegetables and then when I was trying to find out what happened, she disappeared for at least 20 minutes.  I asked another waiter who passed by about my vegetables and he said he would take care of it...   Of course he didn&#39;t.  The waiters and waitresses are really bad here.  Many times, a bunch of them stood around chatting and not working.

I would not recommend any other dish here but I guess if you are going to steakhouse you should be enjoying a steak anyway. Also I would like to mention the staff was great this time. Our waiter was informative and was very nice. He was the one to recommend the steak for me, which again was delicious."

All I can say is I am glad I did not pay for the meal out of my own pocket.  As for the finer points, the service was good.  The salad was excellent which got my hopes up for the main entree being as good.  It wasn&#39;t.  Both mine and my wife&#39;s main course was salty.  I don&#39;t think it is because the cook over-salted.  I think it was because of the marinade that was used.  A couple hours after the dinner I felt like I had eaten a salt block for dinner.  The baked potato and sweet potatoes were both very good.  After the meal, our check was brought quickly and the server collected our payment quickly as well.  (I hate having to wait forever for the check and to pay once I have finished my meal.)  As for the restaurant itself, it was clean and very nice.   I just wish the food had been better as I still have about $50 left on the gift card.  I guess I will try Olive Garden as I understand they take the same gift cards."

We ordered the fried green tomatoes and parmesan asparagus appetizer. The asparagus was OK, but the only thing parmesan about it was a couple shavings of cheese. The tomatoes were bad. They had some type of thick batter which was a bit crispy on the outside but cakey and underdone inside. We had just started on the appetizer when the waiter decided we needed our soup and salads. (Although a Saturday night, it wasn&#39;t really busy and there was no crowd waiting). We had just started our salads when they brought the food! We told them there was no way we wanted our main course since we hadn&#39;t even begun to have the salads. The runner took the entrees back. A couple minutes later the waiter came by and apologized saying he&#39;d put a 10 minute hold on the entrees but the kitchen was slow and they just pushed out the food. (Huh??) He assured they would prepare fresh entrees for us. When the food came the manager came out and apologized again. The prime rib was OK (we all ordered it) but I&#39;ve definitely had better for less. There was some stringy tendons in the meat making it very difficult to cut. I had the creamed spinach which was good, although the bread crumb topping could have had some flavor instead of being just bread crumbs. It would be an OK place if I was in the area, but there are much better options very close. Just so so."

I had the longhorn salmon. It came with a starting salad (options are Caesar or house).  The salmon is a little over cooked but the bourbon glaze was delicious. It sat on seasoned rice, and you have your choice of a side. I wanted to see how the Brussels sprouts were. It was too cheesy and too creamy for my liking. 

Dessert was the cinnamon sugar pillow donuts. Really good but it&#39;s a lot to eat on your own. Great sharing dessert.

Overall, food is ok and service is nice."

It also came with this little cup of potato chips with some cheese and bacon on them, truly enjoyed!  Then we had no choice but to split the pumpkin lava cake dessert......OH MY GOD, wish we didn&#39;t split it as it was that delicious.

First time with a group of friends for dinner and drinks. But this last visit for my mother&#39;s 62nd birthday was absolute dynamite.

Our server Joanna S rocked! She took our party of 5 order like a champ. I even mentioned to her my mother&#39;s steak had to be served with no pink on it since my mom is a well done kinda gal. Joanna made sure that fire grilled t-bone was to my mama&#39;s liking and still burst with flavor.

The crispy calamari appetizer with sweet tangy bbq dipping sauce was spot on good! The caesar salads were a great intro to our ultimate steak showdown.

I ordered the Ranchers Sirloin 12 oz with a fried egg on top and bacon. Its wingman on the plate was a loaded baked potato. Geez I swear God cooked my steak cause it tasted like heaven! Perhaps Moses poured my seasonal Sam Adams tall boy cause even that was going down like water.

Service was great and the prices are actually very reasonable. I love the fact that the ambience could entertain anyone from a birthday celebration or a lovely affair (not the cheat on your spouse one)."

Stopped on our way home on our wedding anniversary.  I was expecting the same excellent service and food I get in Des Plaines but this was poor.  My wife ordered a ribeye which was not cooked as requested and the staff response was you ordered it that way.  It didn&#39;t even look like a ribeye steak.  Her mashed potatoes didn&#39;t taste or look very good, she asked the waitress if the potatoes were real or made from flakes - the response was &#34;not sure they come out of a bag&#34;.

But we went here for Father&#39;s Day this year and we were pretty disappointed.

The one good thing was that we were told it would be a 2 hour wait, but it ended up only being about 30 minutes. Not sure if they tell people long times like that to scare them away or if they really thought it would be 2 hours.

They seated us 2 inches away from the next tables though, making it uncomfortable for all of the diners. I kept having to apologize to the diner right behind me for being so close. I could barely move, so I was not comfortable enough to really enjoy my dinner. Unfortunately this has happened to me at other restaurants as well and I am not sure why this happens. I would rather have waited a little longer for a table I would be comfortable at.

Food was great, as always. It kills me to drop my 5 star rating to 4 but it&#39;s just not perfect anymore."

Our server took care of us OK but he was very cold almost to the pint that we were just waiting for him to come back to are table and butcher us with an ax.

If you like your food salted so much that it is all you can taste or so much salt that it immediately sends your blood pressure into the danger zone, then you would have loved our meal. My steak was pretty lousy.

I don&#39;t know what my steak house mac-n-cheese even tasted like as my mouth was filled with salt and that is all I could taste.

Hey Longhorn FYI salt is supposed to accent/enhance flavor and not be a flavor"

The steaks are certainly tasty, but they don&#39;t know how to cook them- I ordered a $25 medium T-Bone and got rare, as did my wife. The worst thing are the watered down drinks- ordered a &#34;Perfect&#34; Margarita, shown on the menu for $8.99.  Not priced right to start with- and after a few sips it became obvious that it was almost entirely lime juice and ice. $9 for a sweet, high-calorie mixture of junk. Told the waiter that we were disappointed with them- he couldn&#39;t find the manager so never did anything to fix them. When we got the bill, he had the nerve to charge us for a Patron Perfect Margarita instead- $11 each- half-apologizing that he&#39;d pushed the wrong button. Then there is Bolingbrook- the highest tax suburb in Chicagoland- adding its 15% liquor tax on top of its 8.5% sales tax, adding a whopping 23.5% tax to anything liquor, even though it appeared to have less than 1/2 oz. of liquor in it. 
No way I go back to this place- a Darden concept (run by the same struggling company as Red Lobster and Olive Garden), or for that matter, we&#39;re done visiting any restaurant, liquor store (or buying wine from the Costco) in Bolingbrook."

I have had the steak and shrimp combo here in the past. YUMMO. My new love here is the BLT steak salad. I went for lunch and had it. Steak was cooked perfectly and it was almost hard to finish. Great size for the price. Great Peppercorn Ranch dressing and plenty of bacon. MMM BACON!! :) I will be ordering that again. 

If I remember right from another trip they have some yummy drinks. They had a few new Sangria&#39;s on the menu which I need to try. 

I will have to remember to go back and just sit at the bar and have some drinks. I like the set up there. If only they were open later for drinks after work.

Can seriously become addicted to this place!

Took my son and husband here last week after experiencing a rocking time with the Yelp crew at an event. Was craving the steak and sauce ever since!!

Everything was once again spot on!
Wild west shrimp - amazing!! 
My son&#39;s bacon wrapped white cheddar filet - So damn good!!

And our split porterhouse for two?
Cooked to perfection!!

Service is wonderful and attentive! Not only is the food spot on, but super fast service too! Pricing is reasonable! and it&#39;s a much much better option then chains like outback! 

My only regret?
Not knowing that the cobb salad was available as an optional side! Note for next time!

You need to eat here!!"

First of all, great food at great prices.  For a steakhouse, I was expecting to have put a dent in my wallet but surprisingly, the price range (which is top 2 on my list, #1 being food quality) was quite decent.  For the most part, most of the food seems to be around $12-$24 range.

For around $12 you can get a chicken entre and or 6 oz. steak and have the option to add more sides for extra cost or choose their existing combos.  I chose a $15 combo of 6 oz. steak with grilled shrimp smoked on a plank (like 5 or so).  Every entre comes with the choice of 2 sides or a side and a salad.  I chose a rice pilaf (which was amazing!!! the best I&#39;ve tasted: full of flavor and juice) and a salad mix.  If you get the salad, it would be brought out first as an appetizer and the portion is quite large (a good plate full).  They also give out unlimited freshly baked bread that was really good.  In the end, I didn&#39;t even have room for desert.  

I went with a friend and we each received a salad, ate the whole basket of bread.  He had the Flo&#39;s Filet (which as super tender and moist-- I definitely recommend) and a good slab of salmon for only $23.  Altogether, our bill of 2 came out to be $38 before tax, a really good value considering this is a steakhouse.  

I would definitely visit again!"

The kid&#39;s burger was a real sized burger with fries and an adorable kids cup full of whatever you want. Our server was very nice and the manager came to check on us as well.

The best part of our whole experience however was the dessert. The chocolate stampede is hands down one of the best cakes I have ever had in my life.

This place was kind of fancy, they tried to be upscale like the more prominent places, Fancy, expensive, fair service, mediocre food, 

The steak was way to fatty, the asparagus was stringy, potato was fine and the ice tea was very good.

Six adult dinner meals including two large appetizers, a few alcoholic drinks, tax and 20% tip cost about $160. (NOTE: After signing up for Longhorn&#39;s online mailing list, we had received a coupon to get 1 appetizer for free, so that shaved $8 from the total.)

As expected, it was crowded. LongHorn didn&#39;t accept reservations, but they had an electronic system that accepted &#34;call aheads&#34; (i.e. meaning you call ahead 30-45 minutes before you arrive to cut down on your wait time) and special requests. We wanted a table for 6 by a window for 4 p.m., along with cutting down our wait. So, while another party who did not call ahead had to wait an hour (or more) to be seated, we waited about 40 minutes even with our special request. Over the phone and in person, the staff were very professional and courteous.

Almost everyone enjoyed the food, even with slight mix-ups on orders (i.e. sides). The star of the day thoroughly enjoyed his OUTLAW RIBEYE and BAKED POTATO, while others enjoyed the FLAT IRON STEAKS (particularly the one with portabella mushrooms). They were glad that A1 Steak Sauce was not needed. One person felt the RENEGADE TOP SIRLOIN was not juicy enough though. Also, they enjoyed the warm, UNLIMITED HONEY-WHEAT BREAD and CAESAR SALADS that came with the steaks. The FRESH GREEN BEANS were loved as well. As for what I thoroughly enjoyed:

WILD WEST SHRIMP ($8.99): Spicy, tasty, and an ample amount for the table.

WESTERN CHEESE FRIES ($7.99): I got caught up and accidentally tasted this starter. I did my best to avoid the bacon and chili. It was pretty good. The cheese was real, not liquid goop.

GRILLED SALMON SALAD ($13.99): The hefty salmon was perfectly-grilled, medium-well, bourbon-marinated goodness on top of huge salad. The portion size was out of control, but I&#39;m not really complaining. A whole head of lettuce had to have been used, along with chopped tomatoes, shredded cheddar, cucumbers, croutons, and red-onion slivers. The chipotle ranch sauce that I ordered on the side was a perfect compliment.

WHITE PEACH MARGARITA (frozen, $?): It was a delicious cocktail and likely the white peach puree helped. The size was appropriate. On a side note, someone ordered a watermelon martini that was shaken &amp; served tableside. The shaker was left, so actually the amount was of two large martinis. She loved the watermelon-flavored candy/sugared rim as well. I didn&#39;t care for the medicinal taste of that drink, but it&#39;s hard to avoid that in melon cocktails that rely only on melon-flavored liquor.

The decor and music were country, and the restaurant was clean. There was a long bar, along with seating in the front which helped distract from the wait time (which again, could have been spent in traffic toward downtown otherwise). The outdoor benches could have used some shaded cover. I was surprised that the women&#39;s bathroom didn&#39;t have more stalls than 2 or 3. Also, after the first rush of people, I did notice that tables were not cleared right away (although, our great waitress Beth started clearing ours). A manager asked about our meal at the end and offered our party a few more coupons for a free appetizer. We wanted desserts at first, but our stomachs weren&#39;t up to the task.

We had a great casual dining experience at LongHorn. It may become our go-to Father&#39;s Day destination!"

It&#39;s a nice clean place with a cowboy feel. Ordered a sangria and sipped on that while I chewed on some warm bread they bring to the table. We all ordered steaks and they were very flavorful. They came with two sides. Good food, great price!"

I loved the menu - they had things that you don&#39;t see at every other steakhouse that you go to.  They had a great variety of steaks as well as other things like chicken and fish.  They offered a great variety of everything really - beverages, desserts, salads, appetizers - a lot of choices in all of the menu categories.  An entree comes with a choice of side and a salad, so you get plenty of food.  I liked that they offered several different sides to choose from including unique things such as a sweet potato with butter and cinnamon and roasted asparagus.  They also have a pretty good kid&#39;s menu that offer several non-expensive entrees that come with a side and drink.  The prices were about average - but more importantly I felt like I got portion sizes that were appropriate for what I was paying for.  My only complaint here was that our service was a little slow and our waitress was a little off.  She never brought us bread until we realized that everyone else in the restaurant had bread and we asked for it, when I ordered a T-bone steak she came back and said they were out, then came back and said they had some afterall - but in the end I got a different cut and when she brought a refill for my drink she brought the wrong drink.  None of these things made the experience bad - but I could have lived without.  

What we specifically got and LOVED:
I had the cherry limeade to drink, they offer this and a few other concoctions that are both made to order and are refillable!  They also had a pretty extensive alcoholic menu as well (including yummy margaritas) but it wasn&#39;t that kind of night.  We started with a seafood cheese dip which was pretty good - but I would probably try something else next time, they had a lot of appetizers.  I tried to order the T-bone, but ended up getting a NY strip steak.  There is a note on the menu that they don&#39;t freeze any of their meat, which is why the occasionally run out of stuff.  For that reason, I am okay with the substitution.  My husband had the Porterhouse - both steaks tasted excellent.  Mine was a little overdone, but not enough that I would complain about it as it was still very flavorful and juicy.  I got the loaded baked potato which was average - my husband got the sweet potato which was really good.  Overall a really good experience - we will be back again and hopefully will save enough room for dessert next time."

And it came out medium-well. He wasn&#39;t pleased. The waitress was incredibly accommodating and she put in an order for a new steak. The second came out a little less done but not much and it was far too seasoned with pepper to be enjoyable. They had two chances and failed both times. We won&#39;t be returning and I advise all of you to be weary of trying this place out for the first time for a steak.

The staff is super friendly and effecient and if they mess up, which has happened to me before, they make it right with instant discounts off the bill.  The steaks are to die for, juicy and made right!  This is one of the best steak places in Chicagoland.  Now before you snip at me and say Chicago has plenty of good steak and is known for it, I must remind you that this is not before 1971, when the Union Stock Yards used to plate Chicagoland with the finest cuts of meat.  Since that meat packer closed down Chicago has not been the same for steaks, so that is why this chain runs away with one of the best in my opinion at an affordable price too.  May I recommend the Mac N Cheese!?  Excellent, but not healthy LOL.  They have excellent appetizers I can&#39;t remember which one I had last time but it was excellent it was some kind of dip.  Lastly, keep in mind this place is slammed on weekends with long waits (not the restaurant&#39;s fault), so if you want to eat at 6 for example, show up at 5!"

Actually when I was waiting for my friend I noticed that the whole place looked like my mother did a number on it. Nice atmosphere and very inviting. Wednsday at noon and the place was empty for the whole time we were there. I mean 6 customers total. I guess that&#39;s how they keep this place spotless. Our server was on top of us like nobody&#39;s business. We both had the salmon salad. Mine was with the caesar. It was very tasty but both of our filets were black on the top and very dry? There are tumble weeds going by this place. Does the cook have anything better to do? Everything was great and I would have given it another star. But I didn&#39;t order blackened anything.

The atmosphere was there, the staff was pretty good, but the food was nothing to write home about. The best part of the meal was the fresh baked Honey-Wheat bread. My wife and I both ordered steaks cooked Medium-Well. Mine came out Medium-Rare, and my wife&#39;s was Well Done. The manager took mine back to cook it a little more. I thought it would be okay, because I had ordered a side of ribs, but the ribs were very disappointing. Way over cooked. I&#39;ve had some good &#34;fall of the bone&#34; ribs, but the meat was mushy and tasteless. The BBQ sauce didn&#39;t help, either. All-in-all the meal was a disappointment."

A few weeks ago my boyfriend and I came on a Sunday around 3:00pm and were surprised at how busy it was. We were seated right away, but it filled up quickly. Anyways, we ordered the Firecracker Chicken Wraps as an appetizer - Good, but not as spicy as I guess we would like, or expected. I ordered the Grilled Chicken &amp; Stuffed Portabella - which would never order again. I just didn&#39;t like the mushroom sauce and the stuffed portabella mushroom that was on top was the size of a dime. My boyfriend ordered the Bacon Wrapped Filet - and it was very good.

Our Friday night experience was much better (in my eyes). We ordered the Wild West Shrimp (enough to feed 4) - AWESOME! I ordered the Sierra Chicken, it was cooked perfectly! My boyfriend ordered the Loaded Sirloin and said he would order that again if we ever go back. 

We don&#39;t live close to a Longhorn - so for us to go back, we will have to make a trip! And with so many other places like Longhorn around us with the same quality (if not better), I don&#39;t think we will be back any time soon. Good food, good prices - and worth a try if you are in the area."

I came to yelp to read reviews and at first was a little skeptical of coming to this place . The comments on their western Decor and county music kind of made me question the integrity of the atmosphere. 
When we got there we were seated almost instantly. We had to wait for them to join tables to meet the size of our group . I noticed the decor instantly and thought that it was nothing like I had imagined it would be . Nothing gaudy at all and the music was at a nice level where you didn&#39;t feel you needed to shout over it to talk to someone at the other end of the table . 
We were given lunch menus (because of the time we went) but requested the dinner menus. The dinner menus offer a way bigger selection then the lunch menus . So I recommend the dinner menus. I do wish they were given automatically cause I would have never known things were missing off the lunch menu if i wasn&#39;t at there website the day before. 
The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable . They aren&#39;t coming to your table every 5 minutes after you have just taken a bite off your fork to ask if everything is okay. They come around at appropriate times and refill your beverage without being asked. Was very accommodating. 
And on to the main reason we go to a steak house ... The food ! 
We had the shrimp and lobster dip in addition to the stuffed mushroom caps.. They were both delicious and the never ending bread was a nice bonus. The steak was melt in your mouth amazing. My father in-law ordered the lobster tail addition to his steak and was very pleased . The steamed vegetables are crisp and compliment your meal. 
Overall ... We were very pleased and every one of us in our party of 6 
left with good memories and happy tummies. I would definitely recommend Longhorn to a friend. 

-Bon Appétit"

My husband, 18 yr. old son and I went at 2pm on a Sunday.  We had a very good experience. The waitress and other wait staff could not have been any nicer. The food took a little long to get out to us but that is ok. The waitress recommended their new appetizer of fresh potato chips and dip for $3.99. It was ok. I think I have had better at other restaurants. Husband and son&#39;s chopped steak was cooked perfectly to their order.  Good mash potatoes, good fries. I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken salad and it was terrific."

Molten Lava Cake - awesome, but larger than the picture.  Make sure you have belly-room before ordering.

A gift card brought us out and we were glad it did. We came in for a late lunch on a Saturday. Lots of cars in the parking lot, but to our surprise, no wait. 
Since it was lunch, we decided to split the steak and salmon entree. We upgraded to a Ribeye and also asparagus. We also got the chicken roller appetizer. They were delicious and came plated among lettuce, tomatoes and sauce, my only regret was getting the salad with our meal because of this. Drinks and bread were kept replenished. 
When our meal came out, we were surprised at the huge portions of both. And we were even given an extra plate for sharing at no charge. The salmon was great and full of flavor but the ribeye stole the show. So juicy I cut mine with my butter knife and needed no sauce. It was perfectly cooked - well done just the way we like. 
This place was kid friendly too. Menu, crayons and even Teddy Grahams to tide our little guy over while we waited for our food, which came up surprisingly fast.
We were too full for dessert and a little sad that our only left overs was salad.
We will definitely come back for shopping in the area as well as a fabulous steak."

I picked up a pepper mill and noticed the bottom of it was filthy, absolutely gross.  Our steaks were okay, all three of us had overcooked steaks.  The service was lacking, better at McDonald&#39;s.  There were only 3 tables there and we were looking for the server.  At one point I went up to the host and had him find the waiter.  Very disappointing.

I have Flo&#39;s Filet 7oz. and my Husband had the 9oz. The filets were cooked as we like them because we asked for medium and they come out medium rare which is what always happens nowadays. I had the mashed potato side and Sweet potato side for my Husband. All in all the food was good. Salad was big and fresh. 4 stars on food as was cooked well and tasty while not being over seasoned. No steak sauce required.
The cocktails were so-so and were always made out of sight which led us to believe they did not want to show being poured. We thought they were week considering price. Corona was $4.49 in bottle, 7&amp;7 was $5.69 and 1800 Margarita was $7.99. The margarita being the best value. On top of the price of drinks is a 14% tax that is special to the Town of Bolingbrook. That in itself brings it down one star. Presentation so-so. So good food, avoid the high priced and weak drinks and have a good time."

I brought my mother for her birthday and had a terrible experience. 

Not only did the server mess up our order and forget to bring silverware, but he couldn&#39;t even tell whose omelette was whose when he was asked. I have a zucchini allergy and I was given the wrong plate. We waited about 50 minutes for our meal to arrive.

After we received the bill, we noticed we were charged for several items without notice. He failed to explain the hidden up-charges in the menu. He charged us for pancakes that were not labeled in the menu as specialty pancakes. He never explained that the substituted turkey sausages were more expensive.  And the food mix up and pricing issue wasn&#39;t the primary problem.

When we calmly and respectfully inquired about the pricing discrepancy, I was told that it was common sense and I should have known. 

Then, when I asked to speak to the manager, he told me that his server had been with him for a year and a half, that he knows the server would have explained it, and that he trusts his guy. Not only did the server and the manager fail to validate my legitimate complaint, but the manager chose to support his employee and minimize his customers concerns.

Our server was really good and no issues -it&#39;s the only reason this place is getting a 1 star, because of the server. 

The food was terrible and instantly made me sick.... I specifically asked for no butter to be cooked in with my skillet (I watched the server write this) but obviously the careless &#34;chefs&#34; in the back decided otherwise. I&#39;m not much of complainer but when I ask for something to not be put into my food I kind of expect it since this restaurant is claiming to not be like a fast food joint.... Clearly dropped the ball on that one considering they were too lazy to whip up some extra hash browns and veggies without it. I also asked for avocado and got guac..... Again, laziness.....  Bathrooms were horrendous- it was like stepping into a port-a-John :/ ugh, so gross.... Made me want to take my chances on squatting in 
a bush outside. 

Also, $40 for two skillets, cup of coffee and small glass of oj? You are out of your mind ... We are not in Chicago ( where I would actually get quality service and way more bang for my buck @ that price).

It&#39;s a bit unfortunate to actually see this place starting to suck since my husbands family is pretty close to the owners.... Oh well, good luck on running the place- I will most def not be back or recommend anyone here."

Even though there were many people waiting for a seat on a Sunday morning, the wait went quickly.  That&#39;s a positive.  Our server Nicole was friendly and checked on us frequently. Another positive.  My complaint and low rating is because it took over 30 minutes to get my egg white omelette and side of bacon, as well as my husband&#39;s breakfast.  It wasn&#39;t our server&#39;s fault. She said the kitchen mixed up the tix. I could have made that same breakfast quicker at home. The low rating was for the long wait for our food and the lack of a manager presence when I wanted to bring this to his attention. He was there when we arrived and disappeared, no checking on tables and customers. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back with other more efficient breakfast places near my home."

Ordered the eggs with a side of gyro ($5 for a not so plentiful portion of gyro) and was not disappointed.  The soup (beef barley) was quite good.  The others in my party chose various omelettes that they seemed to enjoy. The portions were quite generous with the hashbrowns and the pancake side was also nice.  It was not too busy the day I went, so we were there like 40 minutes total which is how I like it."

Food was ok but nothing to go wild about- basic breakfast, not that hard to do, harder to make it a wow factor. Check came and when trying to pay advised the credit card machine was down. Surprised, not knowing if my 90 year old mother or I had money, our server said we should have read the sign in the door. I advised I didn&#39;t see the sign and the hostess who came to work when we entered said it wasn&#39;t there when we arrived. Needless arguing  over their lack of a credit card machine that worked is pointless and just poor service. We found some money but sadly not enough to cover any kind of tip for the waitress who could have card less. Not sure why servers who depend on tips are so rude and non-caring for items out of their customers control. Having been a server, I saw every customer as a potential 20% tip of the total bill and made every effort to earn it. We visited, we ate, we found cash, and there isn&#39;t really a need to go back."

I am not a frequent Yelp reviewer, but my first and last visit to this breakfast spot forced me to write. If you read the reviews, which I did prior to visiting, you see mostly poor reviews or great ones, which seemed odd. My daughter wanted to try this restaurant, though I mentioned reading reviews that were less than favorable. We had a coupon, though when I showed it to the hostess; she said we could not use it on the weekend, though there is no mention of it on the coupon. When asked why, she just said &#34;that&#39;s what the manager tells us to say&#34;. 

We waited more than 10 minutes for coffee. I finally got up and asked group of women at hostess station if someone could get me a cup. They were busy applying lotion, so I figured they had more time than our waitress (who was friendly). 

Once we ordered, it seemed to take longer than most breakfast places for our food to arrive. My top pancake was crispy. Eggs (spinach/feta omelette) fine. Though we didn&#39;t have enough silverware. We had no ketchup, syrup or hot sauce. Food continued to cool until we had these &#34;extras&#34;.  We noticed a few fruit flies, odd because it was freezing cold and snowing outside.

I think what bothered me most is that while we waited for everything, we noticed so many people standing around doing nothing except talking, or watching ,TV. 

 I thought for a moment that maybe the restaurant was closing soon. I had the feeling that people were waiting for the few diners there to leave so they could swing into action. But no, they were going to be open a few more hours. 

I know this is a harsh review, but I&#39;ve been a server. I&#39;ve been a manager. The crew here needs training in efficiency and customer service. Anyone of the many staff members standing around could have walked through the room offering coffee. The manager could have checked in on guests to see if anything was needed. Instead, I saw a lot of people wasting time while we sat and waited...the one thing I did like, the forks. Once we all had one, I notice the heft and design of the silverware, which I did enjoy. 

I mentioned to my daughter that businesses need to care more about first impressions. Ours was poor and we won&#39;t be back."

When I finally made the decision to give this place a shot, I was shocked with the wave of flavors that overcame my taste buds.
There is a special menu at eggs. When you talk to the owner, ask for &#34;The Gregorian&#34;. It is a skillet with a layer of hash browns made with fresh picked yukon golden potatoes and a hint of onion, a layer of the juiciest, most succulent fried chicken in Illinois (dare I say in the United States), followed by the creamiest sausage gravy known to man with 2 eggs of choice.
You don&#39;t understand how this dish changed my life...heck...it saved my life. I am now a regular customer who starts his weekend with the late, the great, the legendary...Gregorian.

However, the next time I had them, the sour flavor wasn&#39;t there. 

Prices mostly seem fair and the parking is decent. Two things bug me though.  Two bucks for marginal coffee is a rip and check out my photo of the glass with the residue. That&#39;s unacceptable.

We yelped breakfast places in Bolingbrook and found this pleasant cafe.  What I loved the most was coming in and seeing piles of fresh oranges in a juicer.  I have only seen one of those once before, in a cafe in Madrid so I already felt like I was on a vacay, olé!

It is a very clean, fast moving restaurant with friendly servers and host.  There are lots of tables and booths so we did not have to wait.  I had a large glass of the delicious orange juice and as previously mentioned, I was on a pretend hispanic holiday.  so the obvious choice was the MARGARITA SEÑORITA frittata which is as much fun to eat as it is to order.  Full disclosure:  I ordered it without the jalapeño and my server stuck around and was very solicitous about checking that they had made it that way, which they did.

Add to it a crispy English muffin, served dry just the way I like them and you have a solid breakfast.  We also had coffee and some hilarious children at the table next to us to round out a nice Sunday morning.

This dish was that unpleasant that I took pics of it at the table and texted them to people.  Anyways, their biscuits and gravy IS worth recommending. 
I would say Eggs Inc serves up a nice egg. But an egg is an egg, and they&#39;re $1 a carton so I&#39;d rather go to a goooood place (think Butterfields, Egg Harbor, Honey Jam) then pay $9 for a .50 cent egg at Eggs Inc."

I usually order scrambled eggs and their sausage links plus some strawberries. I love their sausage links because they are different than most but not overly spicy. 

The coffee has a distinct taste and I always enjoy at least a cup or two. Service is great, seating is comfortable with plenty of booths and also tables. Servers are prompt and attentive. 
I have dietary restrictions so I can not eat the potatoes and bread that come with the meal and they do not charge me extra to sub out the strawberries. 

My husband usually orders a regular breakfast which comes with an ample helping of hash browns and choice of bread. Our bill usually comes to around $23.

I live 6+ hours away and would love to sample the menu beyond what I was able to do.  

Had a great omelette with avocado, jalapeno and other goodness.  Good pancakes and hashbrowns.  Significant portion size for the cost.  Lots of other unique breakfast items on the menu that interested me which is hard to do, I love breakfast but usually stick to the basics.  

Service was great, food was great.  Pleasant atmosphere.  Would definitely go again."

Each time I was ignored or looked at like I was breaking up a social club. 2nd time, I waited for someone to acknowledge and seat me (wasn&#39;t busy and again,  felt like I was a nuisance). I waited 5 or so minutes as workers stood to the side of me talking and just ended up walking out.  Food is good, so 3 stars for food but nothing else spectacular."

While I did not get the Torpedo burger, I had a very tasty skillet. The omelet the girl had was also really good. 

Oddly enough, the silverware left a solid impression with me. It was big and with some weight to it. For some reason I loved that. 

Also, I don&#39;t understand how people are complaining about price. Two people/2 breakfasts/2 cups of coffee ~ $20. That&#39;s pretty standard at any similar sit-down breakfast. 

At the end of the day, it&#39;s worth a trip. I can see my future and that future includes the Torpedo Burger"

The space was cute and the staff was extremely friendly, but the most important thing, the food, was pretty mediocre. The omelets looked like an egg hash that were force pressed into a football shape, and that&#39;s about how they tasted. The build your own omelets were a little outrageously priced, so I tried one of the existing ones (the Hollywood I think?) and tried to just remove some items to make it to my liking. The omelet I got is essentially just an avocado and mushroom omelet, something i get all the time, but for reasons I can&#39;t quite understand the one at Eggs Inc comes with three different cheeses, tons of garlic, and sour cream. In fact, lots of their omelets come with sour cream and most of those are not remotely of the &#34;southwestern&#34; varietal. 

No one else at our table had anything that looked terribly appetizing either. I might return, but would probably play it extra safe with a basic eggs/toast/meat arrangement. Better yet, I&#39;ll cast my vote for a trip to Colonial instead, where the omelets have actual avocado slices in them (not mushed up stuff that might be pre-bought paste) and taste a whole lot better for about $2 less."

The menu is EXTENSIVE and there are daily specials.  It takes a while just to go through the menu.

They will happily make substitutions upon request.

Food came out quickly and hot, just the way food should be served.  Portions are overly generous AND if you are not satisfied they will happily exchange it for something else.

Our waiter was very attentive and his suggestions only made the final decision MORE difficult.

Just a tip, if you are driving southbound on Weber, turn left at Lily Cache and then you can turn in at the next drive, which is the back side of the building."

My friend and I were planning to go to Chipolte next door, but at the last minute decided to try Eggs, Inc. instead.

We should have gone with the burritos.

It wasn&#39;t crowded at all when we were there, but service was so slow. We were seated immediately, and then promptly ignored. We waited forever to place our orders. The food was just so-so.

And then we were ignored again. We needed refills on our coffee, and our server was busy chatting with other staff. She seemed annoyed that I finally asked a busboy for coffee.

I was planning to order dessert, but by the time the server came back, we were out of time.

Of course this entire block is filled with a variety of eating choices, however Eggs, Inc has just taken the trophy with their new presence. 

My buddy and I were immediately greeted by a young staff full of smiles eagerly awaiting to serve us. Although this restaurant is new the friendly &#34;hello&#34; goes along way in my book. Lets talk decor...comfortable earth tone colors and spacious booths that do not have you hugging the table. I immediately noticed the fresh squeezed orange juice machine at the hostess station. That&#39;s a great seller so I will take one of those and a cup of coffee. Cream and sugar is on the table however would love to have had the option for the flavored coffee creamer, I didn&#39;t see it so I didn&#39;t ask for it. 

Let me dive in and order a skillet. I chose the &#34;Yo Adrian&#34; since its not everyday I can say that to a random stranger taking my food order. Plus the fact its loaded with Italian sausage, spinach, tomato and cheese sounded macho and tasted fabulous! My buddy ordered the &#34;El Gordo&#34; skillet with chorizo sausage, jalapenos, avocados, onions and both monterey &amp; cheddar cheese. The presentation was clever with a wood like bottom plate that would house my skillet in place. Silverware was above average and comfortable to hold, although may be a tad heavy for the young kids. 

Great experience, fresh food and thank you for the prompt coffee refills. I did catch the name Gus on the way out. Friendly manager keeping a watchful eye on his staff. Keep up the good work Eggs, Inc Cafe, I would love for you all to stay a long while."

I really enjoyed the food here, service was helpful and really quick. Everytime I went to Chipotle, I would pass it, but it&#39;d always was closed! So when I saw this joint on ABC7, I knew I had to get on down. My mom &amp; I didn&#39;t have much time so we put in the orders quickly and shockingly, it came quickly.
we go there at 11:35, 
ordered at 11:40, 
11:54 we ate. [we also told them we were in a rush]
I got a simple platter of pancakes [new place, played it safe.] and my mom got a chicken panini and lentil soup. She enjoyed the soup very much. Pancakes were soft and sweet. Wish I had more syrup. :\ 
I suggest this place most def. They do close early, so hurry, hurry. The bill came and we were astounded it only cost $18.00! At honey jam, we paid 30.00 for just us 2!"

Easy to find at the corner of Weber Road and Lilly Cache and plenty of parking.  All new insides, converted from the old Zale&#39;s Jewelry Outlet store, with wood floors and river stone trim walls, the place looks very clean--no smudged hand/head prints on the windows, no crumbs on the seats.  The owner made a point to check with every table and even took up my credit card payment for the busy waiter.  Wait staff very friendly and checked back to the table often.  

Breakfast food was outstanding. Food was hot and served quickly--they know what they are doing in the kitchen.  Wife had fresh blueberry crepes that were great and I had the bananas Foster special: banana bread French Toast with caramelized cinnamon  bananas Foster and a vanilla creme drizzle.  Outstanding.  

Only weak spot was the coffee.  Seemed to be a little &#34;off&#34; maybe too long on the burner?

A guy grabbed menus and walked away. We weren&#39;t certain if we were supposed to follow or not. We did, and when we got to the table, he was in the process of tossing our utensils and menu onto the table. Our waiter wasn&#39;t friendly at all; very abrupt, and spoke as though he had had enough for the day. Our food was mediocre; toast was barely warm, pancakes not fluffy but dry and hard on the outside. I prefer the old IHOP that closed...McDonalds probably also better.

The menu is very extensive, and I order an omelet and the other person I was with order a fruit salad flatbread with chips. The omelet came out hot, but it was as if they had cooked the eggs and then added the other parts as a topping, lumping each part together... The flatbread was pretty thick and the fruit salad poorly rolled into it. Upon eating the flatbread my companion noted it to be stale and very difficult to eat. The chips that came with it were soggy. The waiter was very gracious when we told him that it was not great- but kept insisting on bring out more food- which we said no to.

Having tagged along with them several times in the last few months I can see why.  The breakfast skillets are mind-blowing.  My wife is a huge fan of the apple crepes, my daughter owns the Mickey Mouse pancakes, and my father-in-law recommends pretty much anything on the menu that involves a combination of meat and eggs.

I was greeted by my server, Demetri, who I totally recommend.  He knows his menu and paid close attention to my needs.  Kept my coffee topped, and brought out my complimentary soup which was delish! 

The restaurant itself is great.  Nice and cozy, warm colors and great decor.  I was greeted by two of the owners who took the time to chat with me and encouraged me to come back.  

Today I had the California Dream which was out of this world.  Grilled chicken, topped with bacon and avocado, and I had mine served on Panini.  It was paired with kettle style pepper chips which made for a great lunch.  When in town, I will most definitely come back.

Since Ilove breakfast, but not morning, it&#39;s nice that they&#39;re open until 3pm. We were there around 1pm and it was only about half full.

I decided to treat myself this morning and tried the Chunky Monkey pancakes - made from chocolate batter, drizzled with chocolate sauce, peanut butter and chocolate chips and topped with b-a-n-a-n-a-s. A great sweet treat for the morning. The side of turkey sausage links was very standard, but a necessary salty to go with all of that sweet. 

My friend had a skillet with avocados, jalapeños, chorizo, onions, eggs, hash browns and Monterey jack cheese. He also really enjoyed his meal.

The service was excellent; the waiter was attentive without being annoying. Our water and coffee were never allowed to get empty before someone offered to top them off. I gathered that the man who sat us, Gus, was the owner. It&#39;s nice to see restaurant owners participating in the service at their establishment.

Another great perk about Eggs, Inc is for XSport gym members. I had seen an ad at the gym and found out that members receive 10% off Mon-Fri with their membership card. Vinnie came and introduced himself to us and explained the benefit. I really felt welcome at the restaurant and enjoy supporting local business, as we are Bolingbrook residents.

I would like to try more of the menu, as sweet pancakes are not the norm for me, however the meal we had was delicious and I would definitely go back. We already talked about becoming regulars after our first visit!

Went in today around noon and was met by a crowd (to be expected on a Sunday so no big deal to me). We made our way to the register and were ignored by 2 employees. More diners came in after us and were promptly greeted and added to the waiting list for a table. I politely ask for a table for 2 and bite my tongue about being there first and being ignored. Fast forward 15 minutes and we are seated (or shall I say waved to &#34;that booth over there&#34;) by one of the employees. I felt completely unwelcome at that point and should&#39;ve just left but decided that we waited and finally made it to a table so we might as well stay to try out the food. 

As soon as we are seated our waiter came to take our drink orders and returns a few minutes later. Without saying a word, he put the drinks down and walked away. We wait a few more minutes more and he comes back to take our orders. Another server brings us our food (I ordered a cheese omelet with pancakes and hash browns) and forgets to bring syrup for my pancakes. We asked 2 other employees for syrup and by the time it was brought to the table my pancakes were cold.  

I understand that we were there at a busy time on a busy day but I felt ignored, rushed, and insulted. The menu is quite expansive and while perusing the menu I found myself picking meals I would like to try in the future but my omelet was nothing to write home about, my pancakes were cold by the time syrup arrived, and the prices were a little too high for the bad service and mediocre food.

The Hercules had gyros and yummy cheese.  It was super creamy.  I have never had an omelet this tasty before.  The Nutella Crepes had, in addition, fresh strawberries and bananas with cinnamon.  It was really tasty and had just the right amount of sweetness.

Wow! No wait at all. We were so excited. Nice decor, ice cold pancakes? Mom ordered 2 over easy eggs with bacon, how do you really mess that up?  Bacon tasted off. I won&#39;t even begin to describe what happened to the bathroom afterwards. Glad I wasn&#39;t home. 

Fake, curly hair waitress complemented my grandmother on her hidious hat. You&#39;re kidding? Then along came another waitress who said the same thing. Are they schooled to do this? Overkill sucks.

Every dish is is made with fresh, quality ingredients.  The hard work that the owner puts into Eggs Inc shows.  I have only been twice so far - once for breakfast and once for lunch.  

This afternoon, my boyfriend and I went for lunch.  He ordered the stuffed pineapple, a chicken salad dish with fruit, cottage cheese, and egg on the side.  I got the Inc Cobb - chocked full of avocado, bacon, blue cheese, and delicious salad fixings.  

This place has gotten so much press lately and they truely deserve it!  Please don&#39;t pass on the amazing breakfast/lunch experience."

The only thing that disappointed was the service. I had asked for no cheese in my omelet because I am lactose intolerant and behold, my omelet had cheese. Then I had to wait another 20 minutes for another one.

Also, they did not have any kind of non-dairy creamer or soy milk for my coffee, so I had to run over to Caribou (right next door) to get some soy for my coffee. 

I would definitely go again though, because the food is great!!"

What more could you ask for?  Never tried their lunch so I cant speak to that, however, I really like all the options they have for breakfast.

Having delivery choices is a new concept to me. I used to live in Willow Springs in a weird area where delivery options were a choice between two places. Now that I&#39;m in DG I&#39;m overwhelmed by the plethora of dining options. 

John and Eddie&#39;s sent me a coupon as part of a new mover packet, so we gave them a try. And their deep dish pizza was just terrible. The sauce tasted like unseasoned stewed tomatoes. The crust was rubbery and gross, and the outside was just flavorless. Not to mention the fact that my delivery dude must&#39;ve carried it sideways because almost half the sauce slid off onto a corner of the box. 

But then we took a bite of the chicken alfredo pizza and something magical happened. My taste buds danced around my mouth and I regretted ordering that shitty deep dish disaster, because this? This is where it&#39;s at. Forget the red sauce, John and Eddie. You do alfredo. You do you. You do delicious. 

All is forgiven for effing up the dd and sliding sauce all over my clean counters. Bring me another alfredo and we&#39;ll be friends forever. BFFs even."

We always get a barbeque chicken pan pizza and also a size of garlic breadsticks because USUALLY they&#39;re amazing. I haven&#39;t been here in a while so I don&#39;t know if they just got new staff that aren&#39;t all there or if these high school kids are super lazy. So I call at about 830 pm on a weeknight to pickup and order of breadsticks. They tell me 15 minutes. 

I get there a little early because I only live down the street. I sat in my car waiting, which wasn&#39;t a problem at all. But all of the kids working just stared at me as if they didn&#39;t want me there right before closing. (Specifically a tall young girl with brown curly hair)  so as I&#39;m still waiting in my car they just keep staring. 

THEN they just are all standing behind the counter texting on their phones as if a customer isn&#39;t right there. So finally I walk in to go pick up my food. I get all the way home to open up my box and see that  MY BREADSTICKS ARE FULL OF HOT SQUISHY RAW dough.  

I used to like this place but after this I&#39;m definetly not coming back. Clearly John has a bunch of staff that could care less about the place or what their customers eat. Either that or they&#39;re just a bunch of lazy teenagers. Pick up the slack John get some new people who know how to actually work. And to the staff Thanks for ruining a good place for me. I will not be coming back. 

BEWARE. EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK. And before driving half way home make sure you check your food to see if it&#39;s thoroughly cooked. Wouldn&#39;t doubt if someone caught food poisoning. They don&#39;t care."

Delicious mozzarella sticks and Hawaiian pizza.

BOTH pizza - by - the - slice options in pepperoni and cheese were ok. The dough was thick and maybe it&#39;s made thicker to hold better in the warming tray? The made to order pizza dough tasted better to us.

I&#39;ve been out here for over 10 years and still haven&#39;t found a place that&#39;s great and consistent. Even places like Falco&#39;s and Al&#39;s from Cicero are great all the time are so hit or miss out here and the prices turn you away cause your worried it&#39;s gonna suck.. This is one of those situations. Don&#39;t gamble on this one.. You&#39;ll loose.. Their thin crust is thick and soft even the edge of the crust. Sauce it decent and ingredients.

My one friend loved Jets, but honestly if I wanted to eat cardboard, I could do it cheaper than that. And Girodano&#39;s was pretty eh outside of their decent deep dish, which has not broken the internet, as promised.

But J&amp;E&#39;s puts together a really solid pizza. The crust is crisp, and the ingredients are well balanced, overall, it&#39;s well above average and I&#39;d recommend it to anyone.

Granted, I am not a Chicago native (midwest but not chicago) nor am I a hipster, but I have never really been convinced that i have found the mecca of all things pizza dwelling in chi-town and the surrounding burbs. Cracker crust? Why didnt i I just melt some cheese over some saltines? Butter crust combined with unholy gobs of cheese n meat, of course tasty but not balanced by any means, literally an assault to my arteries. Anywho, while eating this pizza tonight I am impressed as it does not try to stake its value prop based off of the tired cliche. The crust is just, what do you call it . . . fresh? Not thin, not thick, just legitimate. The sauce? Gratuitous but complimentary. My mushrooms were cut fresh and the cheese was soft, melty and not ridiculously salty. It&#39;s pizza, my friends. Substantial, original, and just damn tasty. A &#39;za I would be happy to try again or at least con my in-law into liking  :)"

The crust, instead of being thin and crunchy, was more doughy and about a 1/4 inch thick--it just tasted bad...and it&#39;s hard to screw up pizza. The sausage looked like the kind you&#39;d find freeze dried on a frozen pizza. I don&#39;t like giving bad reviews, especially for new businesses, but hopefully this will help the pizza improve!

We were hungry and just had a taste for pizza.  Saw this place from one destination to another and stopped.  We didn&#39;t get anything fancy, just a couple simple pizzas, one reg crust and one thin crust.  Both arrived looking and smelling fantastic.  My son is picky about his pizza and he loved it.  Mine was good, but could have used just a little bit more cheese, the thin crust was just crispy enough without tasting like a cracker.  Definitely will go back and try some of their other offerings."

I think it was a different pizza place before. Anywho the pizza was awesome, and will order again. Pineapple and bacon was wicked good. Menu is good has a lot of options, and the salad was really good too. They have pizzas, sandwiches and also buffalo wings and boneless wings. The owner took my order and seemed like a nice guy.

Service is excellent, wine list is exceptional, ambiance is very comfortable, and food is very good. 

When we arrived we ordered a bottle of wine and some appetizers - the lobster avocado salad and lava roll. The server explained that the sushi chef was not in until 5 (it was an early dinner), and that it would take a little longer. It was not a long wait at all. 

Lobster salad was simple and delicious with very fresh ingredients. Sushi roll was excellent and the rice on the roll was still warm!

I got the pork chop duo and my wife got the surf and turf. The pork was cooked perfectly but the beans and kale were the real star of the dish. Absolutely delicious. 

Surf and turf was super cute. 3 little filet medallions with a shrimp on top of each, and a tarragon butter sauce over it. 

Prices are extremely reasonable for what you get. Definitely check out this place."

It being the La Grange area, we decided to call ahead and make reservations since our grandma and sick uncle would be joining us (they have trouble moving around). We got there and they hadn&#39;t set up the table--I&#39;m assuming because they weren&#39;t very busy, but it would&#39;ve been nice if they had since my grandma can&#39;t stand for very long.
Also, they had water dripping from the ceiling and buckets to gather it? It didn&#39;t look like the roof was leaking, but maybe it was their AC unit. Kind of dangerous despite the &#34;caution-wet &#34; signs since we had elderly relatives and I&#39;m 9-months pregnant.
Our server was very friendly and patient with our group. We consisted of older Spanish speakers who didn&#39;t really understand the menu (first time here) and he took the time to answer any and all (redundant) questions. 
Their lunch menu had many options for my husband and I (we were the younger of the group) but it was difficult for our older relatives to decide since they mainly had salads, sandwiches, and a couple of entrées to offer (not their fault, just making an observation). They had one soup available--it was a creamy chicken &amp; rice soup, delicious. I ordered the tilapia which came on a bed of orzo---very good &amp; fresh. I also ordered the crab cakes, which were just ok in my opinion. They could have had a little more flavor. Just an FYI, they don&#39;t have any fountain drinks such as Coke or Pepsi...everything they have is organic and my group did not enjoy the less carbonated &#34;Mexican&#34; version they had available. The lemonade was very delicious and highly recommended. 
I wish I could say I loved the place. Maybe we can try it out at dinner time and see if it&#39;s better, but I&#39;m not jumping to the chance to go back."

I LOVE the food and I LOVE the concept although I&#39;m a hot dog and fries kind of gal most of the time, I like to shake things up every so often and eat locally grown food sometimes too!

Their appetizers are pretty small so do not expect much, but I recommend the mussels and the lobster avocado. Both are absolutely amazing and light so you can still eat your full entree.

They recently switched up their menu, I think, and I love the new items. All of their fish is always so fresh and delicious. Of course the same goes for any veggie you pick out as a side. I recently tried their sushi for the first time and was incredibly impressed. Of course Nabuki will always be my favorite local sushi spot, but Prasino can satiate my cravings too! 

The only suggestion, it might be a good idea to offer more drinks. I love the green teas and the bloodies during brunch, but sometimes I really want a coke with my healthy fish! I know that sounds weird, but even offering Jones soda would make a world of a difference.

Also, so many time there&#39;s a million open tables and the host will tell you it&#39;s a 30 minutes wait. Of course, those might be reserved tables but it would be nice if the host said that so you aren&#39;t annoyed that you&#39;re waiting for 30 minutes while a ghost takes up space on empty tables."

Couldn&#39;t of asked for a better breakfast and mimosa alternative. You will not be disappointed with starting your day with some bourbon when you order the Kentucky Blue.  It&#39;s refreshing, fun, and delicious. The meal will still overshadow your drinks, deservingly so, but they work well together.

We were meeting my in-laws halfway and I&#39;m happy to report that Prasino in La Grange was it. 

We had reservations at 11:30 on a Saturday morning. The place wasn&#39;t packed, but lively and busy enough. Our table was ready right away and our server very friendly and helpful. 

I strayed from my former regular order of the Paris benedict and instead got the tacos rancheros. I think they have tortilla options depending on your preference. I went with my usual corn ones (and, really, nobody should ever be eating flour tortillas...). They were delicious. The portion was quite large and I wasn&#39;t able to finish it all. Luckily, my husband did get the Paris benedict for himself so I stole a bite or two. Happy to report that it was just as good as I remembered. My in-laws and SIL were all very happy with their orders too. 

I also had an iced chai which was great (and happy to report that they have almond milk as an option). My husband had a strawberry-pineapple-something juice and it was quite good! You could definitely make it a brunch drink with some schnapps or bubbles."

So I was so taken with the reviews of this place that my mom, hubs and I came here for brunch today. I&#39;m so glad I did! I kind of can&#39;t believe I&#39;d discounted this place for so long. First of all, it&#39;s enormous, which I love because huge space = potentially less wait (though there was no wait on a Friday at 10am). The decor is not really my taste but fits right into their ecologically-minded theme. The chairs are comfortable. There&#39;s fun booths seemingly encased in brick, and I wish we could have sat there, but alas.

Their menus are exceptional. The drink menu alone left us wanting two-three drinks. I decided on a mocha that was served at the approximate temperature of the sun, but was rich, delicious, and well-made. My husband got a macchiato which came in the neatest double-walled glass. My mom got a chai latte and loved it. Hubs later also got a &#34;honeymoon&#34; quencher, and loved that too.

I decided to get Angela P.&#39;s exact order, because it sounded SOOO right in her review! The pretzel croissant French toast with a side of chicken apple sausage.  The sausage was AMAZING and rivaled the chicken Apple sausage at the bongo room. The croissant French toast was delicious, but definitely better on paper than in reality. Neither pretzels nor croissants are very sweet, and it didn&#39;t seem like it sat in the batter long enough to become that creamy dreamy French toast texture. The caramel sauce was maybe cooked a minute too long and had moved from amber golden sweetness to a teensy bit burnt tasting. The white chocolate sauce was good, but there wasn&#39;t enough of either sauce, especially because they were served without syrup. I dunno, maybe I&#39;m a sugar fanatic. But &#34;pretzel croissant French toast&#34; promises so much! I wanted more! 

My mom got the chicken chilequiles which was INCREDIBLE. Packed with the most tender, pull-apart chicken on the planet atop a mountain of tortilla chips and nestled in with guacamole, two eggs, and other delightfulness. My husband got the crab cake Benedict which my mother and I adored, but weirdly he got a bite that was ALL black pepper and kind of ruined the whole dish for him. He didn&#39;t finish it, but liked the breakfast potatoes that accompanied it. 

All in all, I enjoyed Prasino but for the prices, I expected just a smidge more to make it a 5-star experience. I definitely will come back if I&#39;m in La Grange or to try their dinner menu."

I LOVE the atmosphere here; you feel like you&#39;re in a spa with the bamboo shoots and calming beige coloring. It&#39;s very relaxing and fairly posh for a place in La Grange. 

I&#39;ve tried plenty of the menu, including delicious pancakes, crab cakes, and eggs benedict. There&#39;s something for everyone here whether you&#39;re vegan, vegetarian, pescetarian, or a plain ole omnivore. I really appreciate that the menu specifies which items are vegetarian/vegan since I don&#39;t eat red meat. The food is SO good and you can eat feeling completely okay with finishing an entire entree because everything is pretty healthy (nothing has been bathed in oil like so many other restaurants). The atmosphere also makes me feel relaxed, and in a good mood as I enjoy my meal.

My only complaints: It&#39;s a little pricier than it should be. Again, this is a suburb, not Chicago, and menu items should be priced accordingly. If I wanted to order an app, drink, and dessert, then I would end up paying probably $80 for two people. We were conscious of this when choosing items to order. Additionally, the service was a little off. All three of the times I&#39;ve been here, I have made a reservation first and the hostess did not seat us right away. Why even bother making the reservation? I&#39;ve also barely received any kind of apology for it. I make reservations because my time is valuable, and I fully expect restaurants to honor those reservations. If super busy, popular places in the city can properly honor reservations, then I really expect a place like Prasino would be able to do so (and, if not, offer a complementary drink). 

In any case, I do enjoy and recommend Prasino. I will definitely return in the future because it&#39;s one of the nicest place to get brunch in the nearby Western suburbs."

I try to eat organic at home, so when I saw Prasino tries to use organic ingredients whenever possible, I was super happy.  I have no problem paying extra for organic, sustainable food.

I went with the Irish skillet, and was pleased to see it was served with actual large chunks of corned beef.  No canned corned beef crap here.  The eggs were cooked over-easy to perfection and the skillet  was chock full of tasty peppers, onions and potatoes as well.  My only complaint was that the skillet seemed to only have a slight dash of cheese on top.  It definitely needed more cheese.

The service was friendly and attentive."

The decor was nice but it was poorly lit which made reading the menu difficult.

After reviewing the menu my friend and I quickly realized that this was a vegetarian restaurant with a limited menu and limited options . The menu also did include vegan and gluten-free options. We both decided to get the Thai Yellow Curry as it seemed the most appealing and filling option as we were both very hungry. In my opinion it was good but could have been better; I was not really amazed by it and I felt it was a bit sweet for a curry. 

Overall, I was not too impressed with this restaurant and i am not enticed to come back again to try another entree from their menu. However, it is a good place if you are a vegan or require a gluten-free diet. There were a lot of pictures of their breakfast and brunch dishes so they may specialize more in that area."

I checked OpenTable and they had a few reservations open so I figured we would not have a wait but we did.  I knew I should have made a reservation but I figured we were only half an hour away so what could change?  So expect a wait if you go after 10 on a weekend.  The wait was about 20-25 minutes, as quoted.  It&#39;s fairly average looking but I found the bar to be strange.  They had TVs behind the bar but no stools.  Like no one could sit there but there were TVs that seemed to invite people to that space.  Our server promptly came over and took our drink order and brought a mimosa and a bloody.  Both were just okay.  She had some food recommendations as well, which we took.  However, one low spot was that our server disappeared for quite some time after we ordered food.  It was evident that my drink was empty for a while and even when she reappeared, she went to a few tables before coming back to us.  She was very nice but it didn&#39;t seem that she had so many tables that she should have taken such a long time.  You would think she&#39;d be anxious to refill me hoping to add to the tip.  When she did return I got a strawberry mimosa, which I preferred to the regular mimosa.  The bloody was okay but it really lacked spice.

I tried the chilaquiles.  I&#39;ve had chilaquiles at many spots and these just really fell short for me.  They had chicken as opposed to pork or duck and the chicken had a decent flavor but it seemed a bit fatty although I will say it was tender.  The chip ratio was off as in there were close to a bag of chips on there but not the other things to go along with it.  More sauce and cheese would be preferred.  Chilaquiles should have a layered sort with a few chips in between for texture and to absorb the fatty goodness but this was more like a plate of nachos without a ton of fixins.  So a few components were okay but nothing was great.  My husband got the pretzel croissant french toast.  It sounded cool but we were really unsure where the pretzel was.  It was basically croissant french toast and cause the croissant is so light, it got soggy.  Also the sauce that accompanied was just clawingly sweet.  The dish was not very balanced, which is what I can say for my dish as well.  Overall some average or below average food and not great service either.  I wanted to like this place more and I&#39;ll give another try but so far underwhelmed."

It&#39;s a one-of-a-kind restaurant, with it&#39;s wholesome and original menu, cheerful decor, and numerous options for special diets.    The drinks here are good, and there&#39;s often (but not always) attention to detail in the food items.   But unfortunately Prasino suffers from a number of systemic weaknesses that nearly ruin what could otherwise be the perfect dining experience.

PROS:   

 - Great drinks.   One of the best bloody marys in the area.   Good quality cocktails all around.   And to my knowledge it&#39;s the only restaurant in the west suburbs to make and serve their own kombucha.

 - Accommodating menu.   If your dining companions are vegetarians, they wont feel left out at Prasino.   And bonus points for tremendous gluten-free menu integration.   My wife loves coming here for brunch because she gets nearly a full menu to choose from, even though she is restricted to a gluten-free diet.    They  will even substitute gluten-free bread for toast for only a small upcharge.

 - Cheerful decor.    Eating here makes one feel like they are on vacation.   

 - Complete acceptance of Open Table, even on the weekends, makes this one of the only restaurants where you can make a reservation for Sunday brunch!    This is really great if you want to take your family out for pancakes but don&#39;t want to wait in line.


CONS:

 - Your reservation doesn&#39;t mean they will seat you if you show up on time.    For reasons I will never understand, Prasino gives some priority to walk-in customers when they are busy.   It&#39;s not unusual to make a reservation for 1pm and not get seated until 1:30, while watching walk-in parties get seated ahead of you.    This happens even when there are empty tables.

 - Service is available and friendly... but only at first.   Your waitress may abandon you after your order is taken, and you wont likely see her again until you are about done with your meal.   Do you need silverware?   (More than once we were seated at a table without place settings.)  More coffee?   Hot sauce?    Too bad.   You will have to get up and find it yourself.

-  The food is sometimes good, but also sometimes really bland.   Very uneven.    I sometimes suspect that the cooks don&#39;t use any seasoning whatsoever.    If the item you order derives most of its flavor from cheese or meat fat, you will need to add salt, or hot sauce.

-  It&#39;s just too expensive to eat here for what it is.    Breakfast for two with only one side between you should not cost $45.    I get the feeling that Prasino can&#39;t decide if it&#39;s a diner or a hip restaurant or both.   So they charge as if only the latter.


I will likely keep coming here because of the limited number of dining options available for my gluten-free pescatarian wife, and by virtue of how often we are in the area.   But I can&#39;t say I will seek this place out.   Not until the service and food quality even out."

Service was nice, pretty professional and prompt. The host could have been friendlier and certainly more helpful when I asked to be directed to the restroom, but I&#39;ll let it slide.

The coffee, I didn&#39;t love, but my husband enjoyed, so I guess it&#39;s a wash there. Seems like they make their own brand of coffee somehow, although I didn&#39;t see a place for a roaster on site. Cream and sugar were served in cute, reusable containers (not that I use either, but still appreciated the nice touch).

I enjoyed my Jump start tacos. Egg whites, avocado, and cheese, with an interesting salsa served on the side. My husband and kids had the Hippie omelette that is made with tomato jam, which I&#39;ve never had before but is so uniquely delicious. The potatoes served with our meals were top notch. And their GF pancakes are nothing to sneeze at, either.

We weren&#39;t given kids menus despite having two little ones, and there was no changing table in the restroom. Pretty family-friendly otherwise, despite coming off a little cool and upscale. I&#39;m interested in coming back for lunch."

My two favorite words put together on a lovely breakfast menu. I&#39;ve been to Prasino&#39;s before I was vegan and I was a fan but it wasn&#39;t someplace I would visit frequently. I don&#39;t know if they had vegan options prior to my transition but it was definitely a pleasant surprise!

They offer a good amount of vegan options for breakfast which is awesome since I&#39;d always feel vegan options to be so limited. Lunch...not so much, but they offer fresh juices! 8 vegan breakfast items, 2 vegan lunch items, and 2 vegan dessert options. 

For breakfast I ordered the vegan pancakes, and the cocoa chia seed pudding with a side of fresh fruit. The pancakes were awesome! They had this glaze on top which gave it more texture and flavor. The cocoa chia seed pudding was OK. I&#39;m not a big fan of it by itself (very chia-y), but when you eat it with the fresh bananas on top...REALLY good, especially pairing it with the vegan pancakes. 

For lunch I ordered the ginger maryann juice (apple, carrot, ginger), a side of mini greens, the black bean burger, vegan mint chocolate mousse, and trio of sorbets (yes, I can eat a lot). The juice was good, packed a punch to my face with how much ginger they threw in there but I love ginger so it woke me up. The mini greens was a side salad with a balsamic dressing with very little tang (YES, thank god) so it didn&#39;t leave a weird impression on your throat (and it was good). The black bean burger I really enjoyed after tweaking a minor issue that dates back to one bad salad experience that forever scars my soul. Arugula just tastes awful to me so of course that was the greens of choice. With how flavorless a black bean patty can be, I feel that the arugula overpowered it to much extent sooo I scraped that sucker off and was left with bun, pico de gayo and guac...PERFECT.  The patty was a little mushy in some areas and in other areas it was crispy. Like I said, black bean patties tend to be very bland so its how you cook it and what you throw on top of it that makes it bad ass.

As for dessert...yes, you should order the vegan mint chocolate mousse and the trio of sorbets. The vegan mint chocolate mousse was so good, even my dad (who is a non-vegan) loved it! The sauce wasn&#39;t great. Not great at all, in fact, just avoid it and eat the chocolaty goodness. The sorbet was good too, except for the apple cider flavor. Just...wasn&#39;t good. But the black cherry and raspberry sorbet were great!

Overall...YES, go here for breakfast and lunch! Awesome vegan options."

Read the reviews on Yelp and decided to check this place out in LaGrange and so glad we did. 3 of us started with bloody Mary&#39;s and 1 had a Mimosa. We had their Basic Bloody which was nicely spiced and garnishing plus rhe glass was rimmed with spices. The mimosa was nice but served in champagne glass, nothing special. For brunch we had their homemade corn beef hash, short rib hash and the frittata with spinach, feta and avocado. Sides were toast or pancakes. The fried potatoes were fantastic, nicely spiced and crisp. Highly recommend Prasino! We sat outside on a beautiful Sunday. They also put us on the wait list for first available when we called in versus waiting until we arrived at the restaurant. So we were seated right when we arrived.

The prices I felt were way too high, but I do get it that it&#39;s all organic, blah blah blah. The food saved this place from a two star review because the service was TERRIBLE. our server only came to our table twice - to take our order and to bring our check. someone else brought us our food. We were seated outside around 10am and by the time we were finally served and finished it was after 12pm and completely scorching outside so we were desperate to get going. I literally had to walk up to the outdoor station and help myself to a to-go container and we had to go inside to ask for our check. Finally when she took our bill, she disappeared with our credit card for about 15 minutes and had a different person return it to us. For the prices you pay, I would expect MUCH better service. Also, neither the mens or womens restrooms had any soap."

There had been a lot of good reviews and one creepy one that kept popping up on my home page that was almost my Prasino kryptonite. I&#39;m so glad it wasn&#39;t!

After a long, cold winter and two months without seeing my mom, the possibility of a decent Sunday was approaching.

 &#34;Mom what are you doing this weekend?&#34; &#34;Ugh, my taxes&#34;
&#34;It is supposed to be nice on Sunday. Want to at least try for brunch?&#34;
&#34;Of course!&#34;

And so I made an 11 am reservation on Open Table for Prasino knowing we could then try breakfast or lunch dependent on our moods.

It was pretty crowded when we got there and we ended up having to wait about 2 minutes for our table but I was relieved for having thought ahead and made that res. The first gorgeous Sunday in forever and a breakfast spot near the zoo? Of course this place is going to be hopping and hopping with kids!

I opted for a non-alcoholic juice choice to start - a strawberry blonde. This juice was fresh squeezed orange, pineapple, and strawberry juice. It both looked and tasted amazing.

I opted for the Prasino Cakes with fresh berries. The menu does not give much description on the prasino cakes. It actually gives none. They were blueberry pancakes. They were fantastic. The berries on top were ridiculously fresh and moist. I absolutely loved them. 

Mom opted for some breakfast tacos. She had never considered tacos as a breakfast option before. She loved them. I didn&#39;t try them;however, I did eat some of the red skinned potatoes that came as a side for her. OH MY GOD!!! I could eat those potatoes all day long. They were fantastic. 

We got out of there for about $33 before tip that is including the $7 fancy juice I drank. It&#39;s a reasonable price for breakfast considering I could go to the pancake house down the street and spend about the same per person before beverages."

Well, once I noticed that Prasino was one of my oldest bookmarks (on a Thursday evening), the next meal occurring would be breakfast on Friday morning.  Lucky me, we were both off of work for the holiday.

I love eating breakfast out.  It makes me feel like I&#39;m on vacation, because that&#39;s the only time we really eat a hearty breakfast.  The decor at Prasino adds to that vacation feeling that gave me a west coast vibe:  light wood used in tables and flooring, white walls, and lots of wide windows that allow in tons of light. Their menu, a &#34;farm to bar&#34; concept, contains no Coke or Pepsi products and focuses on local, sustainable food.

The beverage menu is enticing.  Lots of cocktails with unique ingredients like blueberry jam, smoothies, and house-made sodas.  I eyeballed some cocktails but chose an elderflower soda instead.  I was a little misinformed - the waitress said something about house-made sodas, including a ginger ale, but I was served elderflower soda from a bottle.  Dominic P. had a cocktail which tasted like a healthy, freshly squeezed juice, with vodka added.  I wouldn&#39;t mind coming back here just for the cocktails!

Who knew that somehow, some way, a menu item like PRETZEL CROISSANT FRENCH TOAST could fall into the &#34;local, sustainable&#34; category?  I see items like this and I don&#39;t ask any questions.  It was amazing, with the perfect amount of caramel and white chocolate drizzled on the plate.  I also had a side order of the chicken sausage, which balanced the sweetness of the French toast.  The sweetness didn&#39;t get to me at all, the way a sticky sweet apple pancake at your typical diner would.

Dominic P. had the short rib skillet, served with a side of pancakes.  The skillet looked delicious, and the pancakes were nice and fluffy.

I really enjoyed my breakfast at Prasino, and I would most certainly be interested in trying their dinner menu as well.  Prices are reasonable; however, once you start ordering fancy sodas and cocktails, you may find yourself paying more than $40 for two just for breakfast - yikes!  Prasino&#39;s still worth it for that once in awhile treat."

The melodious babble of innocence flies in the feathers of birds and on the whiskers of squirrels. Happiness is a tangible hug that embraces the experience at Prasino - the verdant, clean restaurant that delivers the taste of effervescence in every bite and sip.

Moments swirled around our table in an endless passage of a story that we wanted to last forever. Kathleen M, Clifford S, M and I were eased into conversation with Prasino&#39;s libations and appetizers. The refreshing Cilantron cocktail was my favorite - topping even the velvety White Mayan. Other drinks that played on our tongues were the Kir Royale, Strawberry Mosa, at least two different red wines, and a concoction created extemporaneously by the mixologist.

Although our hearts were brimming with pleasure, Prasino filled our stomachs with edible delights. We started with mussels and crab cakes. I only had a nibble of crab cake because I wanted to save myself for more. M is a mussel aficionado and said that Prasino&#39;s rendition was good. Later Kathleen M enjoyed a generous portion of lamb, Clifford S and M were both served pork chops where the corn somehow took center stage, and I had the lobster avocado and dragon roll. My lobster avocado tasted like butter.

The owner Peggy stopped by our table a few times and treated us to dessert. Kathleen M devoured hers before I had a chance to see what it was! I&#39;m also unsure what Clifford S ordered because M&#39;s vegan chocolate mousse dominated the conversation. We unanimously decided that animal fat is a blessing in mousse and that the vegans are martyrs to their diet.

The visionaries of Prasino know how to carry a theme. Their food is clean and simple as is the decor and service. Unstained wood tables and chairs and prairie style lines throughout bragged of unadulterated lucidity. At first the service was slow, but then picked up. He did not interrupt us with verbose explanations of specials or menu items. He was the breeze bringing us delights but gave us space for the ebb and flow of our banter.

I feel confident speaking for my group when I say that we all had a delightful four hours at Prasino in LaGrange. Although it&#39;s always the case that the restaurant only provides the backdrop for our visits, Prasino rose to the occasion. They did not dominate our interactions  with grandiose ornamentation that distracted our conversation. Prasino provides a lovely restaurant dimension when it comes to a meeting place for friends."

Both items were absolutely delicious. The ingredients are fresh, flavorful and just yummy. My short rib skillet had onions, peppers, potatoes and cheese topped with 2 eggs. The meat was perfectly cooked and the potatoes were fantastic. It was also very filling. I ordered pancakes instead of toast and those were amazing too.  To wash down my meal I ordered a bloody mary that was very good, had the just right amount of kick to it. Our server was very attentive and very nice. I must go back to try them out for lunch and dinner. Next time hopefully sit outside on their patio."

I ended up boxing half of it.  The short rib is tender and plentiful, and the vegetables were amazing.  I had the Under The Palm fresh squeezed juice, but in my opinion, it wasn&#39;t worth the price.  For dessert, we had the pretzel croissant french toast- it was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever had.  I loved the sweetness of the batter and white chocolate sauce, mixed with the saltiness of the pretzel.  I also ordered a coffee to-go, and it was top notch!"

They offer so many different options (gluten free, vegetarian, vegan, etc.) and you can truly feel guilt-free about ordering anything here as it is all amazingly fresh, healthy and delicious! I just have to make sure I don&#39;t order too much!

I stopped here today while walking around the outdoor arts &amp; craft fair in LaGrange, for a late breakfast and to get out of the heat.   It was 10:30ish and I opted for the breakfast menu, though I think you could have ordered lunch.   My server was amazing, friendly, and offered up her favorite dish - which is what I got.     It was the Santa Monica frittata.  

I was sitting at the window, people watching and my food came out in about 10 minutes.  It was a plate size frittata, which came with a side of house potatoes and a choice of toast or pancakes.  Since I&#39;m kicking it low-carb, I skipped all the sides.   The frittata was topped with the most creamy goat cheese and fresh avacado.   This dish was heaven on a plate!

There are so many good restaurants to eat in in the downtown LaGrange area, that sometimes it is hard to choose - but Prasino is my go-to for good food and atmosphere!"

The menu has changed and has less of a variety. I have been to this hot spot in the past and I would have given my past experience a 4.5. However, this weekend was horrible, the customer service and the food was not up to par.  The server&#39;s focused their attention on a large part they had in the front of the restaurant. They sat us in the sun, when they had plenty of other available tables.  Our food was not cooked,  the only item we ordered that was delicious  was the flat bread.

I didnt even think those 4 words could go together but im glad that we ordered it. It was not overly sweet but very delicious. We also tried the Under the Palm fresh squeezed juice.

I immediately felt good about it when I walked in. The decor is trendy and modern, open and bright on a sunny day. Beautiful art on the walls. You can sit outside too, if you&#39;d like.

Then I ordered some iced coffee. Happiness in a glass, and there are a couple of fancier kinds you can get.

After much deliberation over all the amazing-looking vegetarian/vegan options, I settled on the vegan eggs benedict. I was nervous about this bold choice (who has even heard of vegan eggs benedict?) but was relieved when I started digging in to the delicious dish. Their portions are massive too, so a good value. I could only eat half mine. And they came with yummy home fries.

My step-mom was happy with all the dairy-free/gluten-free options, too. And the service was great! I hope prasino just as good on our next visit, and they didn&#39;t set the bar too high!"

Made reservations through open table and everything went well. We arrived early and were promptly seated. We had a male waiter who although seemed a little distant he did a great job taking care of us.  I am okay with that, we don&#39;t have to be best friends as long as you do the job.  As far as the food goes we couldn&#39;t have been happier.  I had the Carrot Cakes which is a pancake with fresh grated carrot, cinnamon, nutmeg, golden raisins, sweet cream, candied pecans.  I absolutely loved these.  My wife had the Irish Skillet which is corned beef hash, onions, peppers, cheddar.  She was very happy with her lunch also.  This was nice to hear since she has tried a couple of corned beef hash dishes since we moved up here and none have been a stand out.  I thought the prices were also pretty fair considering the quality and quantity.

It&#39;s fresh and organic. To start, we ordered the mussels in the white sauce. The portion was extremely generous and the mussels tasted fantastic! The also ordered the steak skewers (one order comes with about 5 sticks), which was a decent portion. The steak is cooked to your liking. My brother ordered the lamb meatballs, which he mentioned that it was very juicy with lots of flavor. For my entree, I ordered the short rib. The cauliflower souffle was to die for! You couldn&#39;t even tell it was cauliflower! My short rib was ridiculously tender (just like how it should be) and the Swiss chard paired well with the dish. 

I ordered tea and the waitress was very attentive and made sure my cup was refilled with hot water the entire night. Overall, I don&#39;t have any complaints about this place. The food was very, very , good, great atmosphere (perfect for a date night or dinner with friends), and the service was awesome. Oh, they also offer free valet.

Our waitress was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu, and the menu was quite inspired, including the drink menu. One lady in our party asked for a coke, and our waitress said, &#34;we only have organic cola. Is that fine?&#34; Nobody knew exactly what that meant, or what made a cola organic, so coffee it was. The food was delicious, served quick and hot, coffee refills were plentiful. Waitress came by just enough to be attentive.

I&#39;m sure the dinner service is up there, but the lunch was surprisingly affordable. 

We were looking for healthy and this is definitely the place! My friend and I both ordered salads, and you get a good amount for the price. We also ordered crab cakes for an appetizer and I wasnt too thrilled with it, but how fancy and awesome can you get with crab cakes if you think about it. 

I was super stoked to see the different selections of juice that you could get, especially that they made it themselves. I had ordered a tropical juice with coconut flavors, and it was super delcious, but warm. My friend&#39;s was also warm. I&#39;m not sure why it was served that way, or why you would even serve warm juice, knowing that most juices are served cold. I had to knock a star off for that, sorry.

I honestly don&#39;t understand how this restaurant stays in business.  I recently had carrot cake pancakes which was pancake batter poured over shredded carrots with some raisons - must emphasize some (like two) raisons.  There was a slight drizzle of sour cream frosting which seemed petty to me with a few candied pecans.

My friends and I arrived after the rush but still did not get food until at least 30 minutes after our order was taken - did they harvest the carrots?

Also, a child was sick at the table next to ours and no one was in a big hurry to clean the table.

Parking is available for free out front on the street.

The area has lots of wood and metal furniture. Staff are friendly and very helpful.  There are lots of windows too, which gives this place a really nice bright appearance.

The food was so healthy and delicious I ended up eating here 2 days in a row.

Tuna salad - everything was good except for tuna, which was a bit dry.  But this is expected of anything you&#39;d find in canned form anyways.  Not saying the stuff here is off a supermarket shelf. Just saying cooked tuna is normally on the dry side.  A bit heavy on the sauce, but that could be easily wiped off on the plate.

Prasino salad - wow this thing is huge.  Served with a curious triangle-shaped cracker.

Mango tango - nice and tasty smoothie.

Mystery smoothie (can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called) - orange, pineapple, strawberry.  Served in a rainbow fashion (the drink was layered, like a Shirley Temple).  Special mention.  This one is seriously good, if you don&#39;t mind the $6 price tag.

Yes the food here is just a tad pricey, but you really can taste the freshness.  For that, I will gladly recommend this place."

I&#39;ve tried so many more meals, foods and seasonal specialties here since the first time I wrote a review that I feel the need to heap even more love on them.

I&#39;ve eaten outside on their fabulous patio.  I have had Mother&#39;s day here with my family for two years in a row.  I have had breakfast here, lunch here and dinner here. And lately, if my husband picks me up at O&#39;Hare we now come here before heading home.  

Let me tell you, their food never disappoints.  Sure they are sometimes out of some things and yes, they dropped Cinnamon Cream Lattes from their menu but meal after meal have been inventive and delicious.  My current obsession is the beet salad and the lamb sandwich.  Fresh and yummy.

Now if they would just stock that cinnamon cream syrup again, I would try to make them a 5 plus!"

My 10-year old daughter and I LOVED this restaurant...great food, wonderful service, and a very relaxing atmosphere.  She&#39;s my adventurous eater, and she was always happy with how the service staff treated her just as respectifully as any grown-up in answering her questions and providing great service.  This was our go-to restaurant for our rare mommy-and-me-only dinners and well worth the extra $$ compared to nearby family restaurants. However, on our last visit, the waiter was, at best, efficient.  We were given the minimum service with little to no congeniality.  He took our order, brought the order, and checked in on us; but that was it.  What added to insult to injury is that he was absolutely doting on the only two other tables he was servicing (a table with four women and another table with a couple).  Was it because it was just me and a child?  We&#39;ve been there many, many times before; and NEVER had that experience.  The contrast was insulting, but he wasn&#39;t really rude to us and the food was good; so we just let it be and left very disappointed.  I would have easily chalked this up to an off night for the restaurant and/or the waiter...except that I contacted via their website the next day to let them know, and I never so much as received an acknowledgement, much less an apology.  I may reluctantly give them one more try in the future, but I feel like the smallest infraction will be enough to make me say &#34;never again.&#34;  Very sad...we really did enjoy this restaurant and their food; but an $80 bill for one adult and one child should ensure that more than just our food is enjoyable."

This was our first time at Prasino, and I had read mostly great things about it, but didn&#39;t really know what to expect. We had our almost-5-year-old daughter with us, which I was a little nervous about because I knew there would be a lot of couples celebrating and didn&#39;t want to feel out of place if my daughter decided to not be on her best behavior (she was). The server, Chris, was very knowledgeable about the menu, gave us excellent recommendations, and was great with our daughter.

My husband had the braised short ribs and said they were probably the best he&#39;s had. I had the yellow Thai curry with chicken and it was excellent. Not spicy at all, and still very flavorful. My daughter had the cheese quesadilla and loved it (but then I don&#39;t think she ever met a quesadilla she didn&#39;t like). Our server recommended the maple chomeur for dessert, and it was the perfect ending to our meal. The portions were just right; just enough to be filling, but none of us had that over-stuffed feeling. It probably also helped that the ingredients are much healthier than most other restaurants.

If you&#39;re into cocktails, I&#39;d definitely recommend the &#34;Sage Advice.&#34; Very interesting flavors, and it&#39;s really a nice change from all those cocktails out there that are super-sweet.

We&#39;ll definitely be back to Prasino!"

It was amazing as always. We got Mongolian chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and orange chicken. Plus the egg rolls. 

Everything was extremely well packaged and survived the 20 minute ride home. Plus, it was still hot when we got back. 

My only complaint was that I asked for the house mustard and sadly, no house mustard in either bag. The last time I got carry out from them I had to ask if it was in the bags and it was forgotten then too. 

I sent my dude &amp; my dad to pick it up this time and figured they would double check to be sure the order was complete. They didn&#39;t and neither did Chamber Red. So we were sans house mustard. 

It did not ruin the meal, I was not charged for it, but it was missed. Their house mustard is very good and compliments their dishes very well. 

My suggestion... check your bags at carry out. It really comes down to just be sure you know you have all your items in there."

Eh. Was looking forward to trying Liu&#39;s  (not Chamber Red as indicated) based on ratings but ... eh. Food was decent...even pretty good but many things left to be desired.

Ambience: it&#39;s October but today was warm and humid and they did not have air on so muggy inside. No tablecloths as shown in photos so more stark in appearance. Weird mix of primarily country music playing. Plastic dishes and serveware took away from presentation for sure. Oh...and if you&#39;re planning on using the loo at Liu&#39;s bring your own paper towels because both bathrooms had none. 

Food: As I said...decent but portions small for the price. We like Yu&#39;s in Schaumburg and this place got higher ratings but I cannot figure out why, for the life of me.

Service was nice, friendly and prompt although we were the only people in the dining room.

Overall not impressed, although not terrible, by any means....just nothing standout-ish about it. Not likely to return."

I did take out but the decor and ambience is nice. 

The service was good, they were very timely and accurate with my pick up order. 

I had the pork potstickers. Although they were fresh, I thought they were very bland. I&#39;ve definitely had a lot better. 

I also had the lettuce wraps and I just wasn&#39;t impressed. Nothing was bad about it and they give you plenty of meat but I didn&#39;t enjoy it either. They only give you two pieces of lettuce. Although the pieces were large, 4 pieces would have been nice. 

My grandma had the chicken cho mein. The meat quality and portion was good. Again, I wasn&#39;t blown away by this meal, it was just OK. My grandpa had the beef skewers, which was 3 long skewers with thin slices of meat. He enjoyed them and the meat was good quality.

It&#39;s delicious enough to make my husband and I want to drive 20 minutes from Geneva for takeout. However, the service need some serious work.

As other helpers have noted, the food at Liu Brothers is fresh, well prepared, and extremely tasty. Lately, I have been getting the panang curry, which is just the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. I could eat a bucket of it. My husband and I have also split the Szechuan eggplant, which is great too. And the appetizers, including the soups, egg rolls, potstickers, and dumplings, are all amazing. No complaints whatsoever!

That said, they certainly need to work out some kinks with regard to service. Whenever we go, we wait a very long time for our food to come out. When we were last at the restaurant, we waited 40 minutes. During that time, we actually saw three couples walk out without ordering. Liu Brothers is short-staffed in both the kitchen, and on the floor. I am hopeful that they were higher than new employees soon, because it would be a shame if this gem in the western suburbs closed due to poor service. Until then, order takeout, and pick it up 10 to 15 minutes after it is scheduled to be ready. If it happens to be early, you can always heat it up on low in the oven."

When Liu Brothers popped up on my yelp search with almost perfect rating, I was very skeptical: the quite town of St. Charles is an unlikely place to harbor an authentic Chinese restaurant and &#34;Bistro&#34; doesn&#39;t necessarily convey authenticity either, but I wanted to give it a try. 

As we walked into the restaurant, my heart sank: the waiter is not Chinese, there are no Chinese patrons and there are only knives and forks on the table! Shoulda brought my own chopsticks...

I took a deep breath and scanned through the menu. The menu is not as lengthy as many Chinese restaurants, and there is no two-menu system (you know, one for Chinese expats, and one for locals). Most of the items listed are typical Americanized Chinese dishes but we quickly decided on two of the few atypical ones: Szechwan Eggplant and Liu Brothers&#39; Crispy Duck. 

It turned out the waiter is the owner of the place and he is knowledgeable about the food. He had me when he brought us two pairs of chopsticks, as well as authentic Chinese chili paste without us asking.  

10 minutes later, I was a total believer of the five star rating. The Szechwan Eggplant was the best I have had in a very long time: the eggplant is well-cooked and tender, which is hard to come by when it&#39;s cooked to order. The sauce was reminiscent of the classic Szechwan &#34;Yuxiang&#34; sauce, sweet, a bit tangy, slightly spicy all at once. The duck was not Cantonese or Peking style roast duck, but Szechwan style tea smoke duck. I think the name Crispy Duck is a bit of misnomer as the skin was not particularly crispy but who cares when the flavor and the tenderness of meat was awesome? Needless to say, we devoured the food. 

In case you are wondering, the kitchen staff are Chinese (the Liu Brothers?) and I am pretty confident they are trained chefs. Finally, a Chinese restaurant that emphasizes quality over quantity and it&#39;s not too far from home. My taste buds are in luck."

We&#39;ve been here twice since they took over and gotten takeout a couple of times as well. Food is still good, and they&#39;ve added some new dishes to the existing menu, too.  Personal touch pretty non-existent now, but the food is solid. 

Slowly but surely hitting some of the places in our new area. I needed soup, the 6YO just needed edibles, husband was craving Asian. Ended up here and think we&#39;ve found our new Chinese spot. 

Can I rave about the wonton soup for a second? It was EXACTLY what I wanted - and super fresh - and then I wanted more so I ordered some to go. 

Everything on this menu is made fresh to order. Every single thing. I thought that might take awhile (and I&#39;m wary of things taking awhile after six weeks on Miami Time) but it really didn&#39;t... so it was fresh AND fast. Sold. 

The crab rangoon was light and crisp, and a new favorite of the 6YO, who pretty much wanted to eat until she burst. 

For entrees, we ordered honey walnut shrimp, orange chicken, and combination chow mein. And all were obviously fresh - and delicious. 

The staff was friendly and attentive, and the little kids&#39; chopsticks (topped with a bright yellow VW Bug) kept the child occupied while we waited for our order. 

Will definitely return. Soon."

The service was excellent.  However, we we were the only people there.  At least two phone orders came in while we were eating and didn&#39;t seem to stress the staff.  Some people picked up carry out as well, but that was it.  Otherwise, this is a pretty dead restaurant in a strip mall.

More importantly, the food was delicious. We had the hot and sour soup, egg drop soup, sizzling seafood soup, spicy tofu, and fried egg noodles with shrimp.  All were good.  The hot and sour soup was a little too gelatinous and the broth tasted as if it were slightly burnt.  

The wife said the opposite about the egg drop soup.  She really liked it and the broth was not gelatinous.  I had to agree that her soup was better than mine.

You know how Chinese food leftovers get congealed together in some type of gel?  I&#39;m sure it is due to a thickener they usually add.  Not this food!  It is just as fresh and delicious reheated as it was the night it was served.

I hadn&#39;t been in awhile because I had a run of eating there way too much and I had to take a break. So my friend (Who was also a big fan) and I decided to go back tonight. There was a new person who seated us, but that&#39;s no big deal. Walking to our table we saw into the kitchen and saw it was different people too. Uh oh.

So we order and the food comes...not quite the same. Especially the fried rice, which we sent back. I loved their fried rice previously! They didn&#39;t use a lot of soy sauce and it was lighter and tastier. This one had a lot of soy sauce and also had a curry taste to it. So they went from having the best fried rice I&#39;d had to the worst. Very unfortunate.

The most frustrating thing though was the fact that they have kept the name and the menu...so you walk in thinking that you&#39;re going to have the solid meal that you&#39;re accustomed to having at Liu Brothers, when in fact it is not Liu Brothers, but a cheap imitation. I actually felt duped. Funny, somehow they feel ok about charging what Liu Bros charged for a meal that was far inferior to the original. Which actually makes me angry. They cut corners that Liu Bros didn&#39;t cut but still charge the same?! Not ok. 

They may have the name but this IS NOT the Liu Brothers I used to enjoy so much. Too bad."

I had the garlic scallops and holy cow, they were amazing. The garlic sauce is incredible and the scallops were cooked perfectly. 

Our only complaint was with the crab Rangoon. My husband and I are crab Rangoon junkies and we were disappointed because there was hardly any crab in each one. I noticed it when I first took a bite and from then on, my husband and I were pretty much having a search party to find crab lol.

When paying the bill we asked if there had been a change of ownership.  There has been.  New  owners.  And it shows in a decline to the average from the exceptional.

Just before year end, the brothers, Kevin and David, and their partner, Kevin, sold the business. The brothers stayed on until mid- to late-January to teach the recipes to the new owners/cooks. 

We have gone in and carried out a couple of times since the new ownership took over, most recently last week. I ordered dishes I was more than familiar with to gauge the kitchen&#39;s performance. 

The crab rangoons were good. They were cooked differently and had the look of something that had been fried in a tempura batter. The result was a delightfully crispy and flaky, but light, shell which I thoroughly enjoyed. The filling had a dominant flavor of something akin to green onion. Could have been an under-mixed batch of filling. The rangoons never had a strong crab flavor to begin with so that wasn&#39;t missing, but I&#39;d have liked a bit more balanced flavor. The accompanying sweet sauce is the same- a little thicker perhaps- which is fine, but still fresh and bright. So the jury is out on these depending on the filling.

The chicken fried rice was definitely a disappointment. The chicken was not browned and the rice was very pale. Overall the dish was just very bland and had a greasy quality. Definitely a step down here.

Lastly we had the honey walnut shrimp, which I must say was better than ever. The shrimp were just perfectly cooked- and that wasn&#39;t always the case when David and Kevin were in the kitchen- they had a tendency to overcook the shrimp by a minute or two and the shrimp got a little rubbery. These were perfect. Again, the sauce was perhaps a little thicker, but that was just fine by me as it coated the shrimp and walnuts perfectly. Speaking of the walnuts, they had a much better candied crunch than I remember, so perhaps the new cooks are paying more attention to the walnuts too. The dish was the best example of this Liu Bros classic that I have ever had. An improvement here.

So the new ownership is batting .500 for us right now...I&#39;m a long-time regular customer and I will not be too quick to dismiss the new iteration of this restaurant. Based on what I have seen thus far I am willing to give them some time to refine their approach."

Service in the dining room was a little slow, but not too bad since everything is made to order.  Definitely worth the wait.

Relocated to the Fox Valley 2 years ago, and I&#39;d been searching for a real good Chinese restaurant in the area, but had yet to locate one, when some friends at the local dog park recommended this place.
Quality is definitely the main priority. Since July, I&#39;ve been there at least a half dozen times for dinner and twice for lunch. The Szechwan and Mushu are superb. I haven&#39;t had comparable, in years. The soups and noodle dishes, made with homemade chicken broth are some of the best I&#39;ve had. Lunch portions are of decent size. I haven&#39;t been disappointed with any entree.
The only issue I have is with the size of the appetizers. They&#39;re very good, but smaller than some I&#39;m accustomed to. Used to have Sunday brunches of Chinese appetizer plates and soup. Unfortunately, I cant do that here! They don&#39;t even offer an appetizer plate.
Nonetheless, service is great and the owners are very friendly. The place isn&#39;t overcrowded, so there is generally no wait. I&#39;ve found a new favorite restaurant!"

I wasn&#39;t the one who went inside the restaurant to pick the food up so I can&#39;t comment on the staff. But I was told the owner was very friendly and conversational. So I&#39;ll be nice and give one extra star. 

But the food just isn&#39;t good enough. The garlic scallops weren&#39;t very good; I would have liked more of a sear on them. And they didn&#39;t exactly sit well in my stomach either. The orange chicken was so-so, but I&#39;ve had better. The pieces of chicken were small and I didn&#39;t think the orange sauce was too impressive. The fried rice was enjoyable once I added some soy sauce. Also, I like the eggs and big pieces of shrimp in it. And the egg rolls weren&#39;t too memorable. While they tasted fine, they were tiny.

Also, I was pretty surprised at the limited menu. I would have liked some beef and broccoli or General Tso&#39;s chicken or an option to get a order of stir-fry veggies. I might consider trying this place one more time, but I would have to change my order up."

Understanding that it&#39;s a new restaurant and folks are understanding the business of running a restaurant, the waiter didn&#39;t write our menu request and brought the main course directly without the appetizer. It also took a long time to get our food.

The food is phenomenal and above and beyond any other Chinese restaurant in the area. It is BYOB, which I wasn&#39;t aware of, but luckily we went with good friends who knew and came prepared! We ordered several items and tried a bit of everything. We had the crispy chicken wings, which are out of this world, the pot stickers which were also very good and the spring rolls which are above average. For entrees we ordered the Orange Chicken which is amazing. Just order it, trust me. My husband had ordered the Mongolian Beef as it is one of his favorite Chinese meals, and it was very good, but he specifically asked the waiter for the chef to make it hot, and oh boy did they. So if you like hot ask them, just be prepared to sweat! One of us also ordered a special that was on the menu that was a chicken chow mein that was delicious. The food is really great.

The only problem with Liu Brothers is the service as others have said. I&#39;ll be honest, our friends had been there before and warned us about the service and that you will wait and wait, that the waiter is a young kid who spends a lot of time on his phone and ignoring customers so we kind of knew what we were getting into. But we were assured the food was worth it. And really, it is. If you aren&#39;t in a hurry and can just relax, pour your own wine and deal with wet glasses (yeah, they brought us soaking wet glasses straight from the dishwasher) and wait for food, it&#39;s tolerable. And to be honest, after some wine it began to become hilarious to see what would happen next.  And really, the night we were there we had the owner as a waiter and so it wasn&#39;t too bad. But the spotty service is the only reason for the 4 stars."

We were very impressed. I really enjoyed the decor and atmosphere. The place wasn&#39;t busy at all because of it being Ash Wednesday, so we had great service of course! Very friendly and accommodating staff. 

To start we had the pepper and salt calamari. I&#39;ve never had calamari like this before and it was delicious. Great flavor and I would love to have it again. 

Then we both had the wonton soup. We really liked that too, great flavor and lots of wontons in it. Both the calamari and soup were a great price. 

For entrees I had the orange chicken and he had the beef and broccoli. The sauces on both meats were tasty and both portions were of great size. We had to take half home because we were already full. 

Overall great experience and for a great deal as well. We will definitely be back to try more items on the menu."

I am so impressed that I had to convey the impact it has had on me while my mouth was still evaluating the complexity of quality fried cream cheese &amp; crab meat.

Around 4pm I remembered that an asian place opened across town &amp; on a whim, ordered takeout on this chilly Friday night. When I picked it up, it was PACKED and at 6pm, they took their last carry-out order, even though they are open much later. I recommend calling early &amp; making a reservation! 

I ordered the crab rangoons, kung pao chicken &amp; szechwan eggplant for under $20! I never get crab rangoons, but these were PERFECT; crisp, lightly fried with delicious yummy filling. The kung pao chicken portion was giant &amp; had so much chicken compared to any other restaurant we&#39;ve ever been to! Typical kung pao chicken entrees consists primarily of celery &amp; peanuts. Instead, we received smokey and savory, quality pieces of chicken. The eggplant was also so so special. Caramelized, spicy, and worth fighting over for the last piece. My boyfriend will now have to sleep on the couch because he ate the last piece while I left the table to refill my water. 

St. Charles residents might not be the most cultured of people, but thanks to Liu&#39;s, they now know quality Chinese-fusion."

The crispy duck was dry and seemed like it had been sitting out for hours. The plum sauce had an odd under flavor. The bowl of rice had a crust on it like it had been dished up hours earlier and left out. The sizzling beef was a cheap, very chewy cut. Ugh.

Orange chicken was perfectly cooked, juicy and tender and remained crispy to the last bite. Orange sauce tastes like it was made with fresh oranges, because it is! Not overly sweet just very flavorful.

Last time we went it was for lunch, and my husband and I ordered two appetizers and soup. Our appetizers came out, but we sat for a long time waiting for soup. It was lunch and we had to go back to work, so after an hour went by we asked about our soup and explained that we had to leave soon. The waiter, instead of checking with the kitchen, said he didn&#39;t know what the hold up was, and if we couldn&#39;t wait we should &#34;just leave!&#34;

The veggies are why I get this dish and I would like them in my leftover box not what you choose to put in it.

Also my husband can&#39;t stand the waiter. The food flavor is totally worth five stars. I just want everything what we paid for. I&#39;ll just insist on them bring me a box next time instead of wrapping it up for me or we&#34;ll always order take out. This is unacceptable to me."

I checked the yelp reviews for menu suggestions. We ended up ordering the sesame chicken, Mongolian beef, egg rolls and hot &amp; sour soup. 
I called at a busy time on a Friday night and was told 35-40 minutes. I showed up exactly 35 minutes later and my bag had just been put on the counter. The guy at the counter was very friendly. The total was $31 which is pretty reasonable for a family of 3. 
Dinner was amazing! Our favorite was the sesame chicken. The flavor was perfect. My 4 year old was hesitant to try it, but when she did, she literally jumped up and down and kissed me after taking her first bite! She loved it. 
Everything else was wonderful and I would order it all again. Very fresh, and you could tell that higher quality meat was used. Portions were good sized. The sweet and sour sauce was home made and had a very interesting sweet taste to it. 
Compared to a few other places nearby, this was by far our favorite. Next time we will dine in."

Won Ton Soup - really good, though my mother had the egg drop soup and loved it
Salt and Pepper Calamari - my favorite!  Great breading to squid ratio, and the flavor was increadible
Chicken Fried Rice - good flavor and large piece of chicken
Kung Pao Chicken - delicious, not too spicy (ask for it hotter if you really want a kick).  I would probably try another dish next time though.

Also, my dad had the Salt and Pepper Fish - same great flavor as the Calamari and probably the best entree ordered!

As a side note, the owner and cook talked with us for quite some time.  They seem like really great people and the cook explained how everything is fresh to order and if he wouldn&#39;t eat it, he wouldn&#39;t serve it.  A great addition to St. Charles eateries!"

We headed here for dinner on a Saturday night and it was busy!  Dining in is a lot more comfortable here than Jalisco Tacos, there are more tables available and you won&#39;t shiver every time someone opens the door.

There&#39;s music playing, so you&#39;re not just subjected to episodes of Sabado Gigante.

The Cochinita Pibil (shredded pork) are to die for!  The steak were also very good, and my husband really liked the chorizo.

Chips and salsa are complimentary and delicious.  We also ordered guacamole which was too creamy for my liking and didn&#39;t pack much flavor.  The horchata was okay too (sorry, but Jalisco is much better).

That made a world of difference. I got to see first-hand how good (and friendly) the service is. The other part of that good service is that I was kindly guided through the normal toppings for tacos I had never had before. Nicely done, I didn&#39;t feel foolish at all the way they took care of me!

I can honestly say the Conchinta Pibil was a treasure, however I loved the Taco de Alambre. I can&#39;t go back to Asada anymore. It didn&#39;t need anything but what it came with.

I also liked the Chipotle salsa (in the bottle) very good.

I am grateful that the meal was great, inexpensive and served with so much Aloha

The old location of Tacos Maria&#39;s which was one of my favorite locations for Mexican food, breakfast, lunch or dinner. 

When I first arrived the atmosphere had changed completely. The outdoor patio was gone, the walls repainted, I was excited. But when we got inside although things got a big upgrade the staff was very confused about what bacon was. I used to order bacon egg and cheese tacos before. I understood they didn&#39;t have any so we tried steak egg and cheese tacos. Our waitress didnt even know what Orange Juice was and asked us if Orange Crush was a better option.

The food was served and to our surprise there was hair in the food. The chips and salsa they served were partially burnt. 

The salsa was the only great feature to this small, depressing hole in the wall.

Please give this place a little bit more time, the wait staff are very inexperienced, and the cook is very unprofessional. Wearing gloves and hair net out onto floor and touching register."

I ventured to try the chimichanga, the last time I was in, and it was delicious full of rice, beans, cheese and tons of meat with the lettuce, avocado, sour cream and more cheese sprinkled on top. It is not greasy at all and I have had that before with fried tortillas at other Mexican establishments.
The salsa is usually spicy but today it was medium which is one tidbit that varies from visit to visit. The guacamole is a great starter and you can tell the owner takes pride in their ingredients because although I order it every time I come in, some times they will say they didn&#39;t get in quality avocados to use which is appreciated because when you do get the guac it is fresh and simply delicious!

Everything is super-fresh and flavorful at great prices (the taco dinner I&#39;m getting ready to rave about was $7.95!)  You really want to eat at Taqueria Muniz!

Yesterday, I headed south on Lake Street with thoughts of a taco dinner dancing in my head.  I walked in the door, was greeted by a couple of friendly employees, and sat myself down in one of their simple old-school restaurant booths.  They brought out some very tasty chips and salsa for me to munch on while awaiting my taco-based feast.

Their taco dinner consists of three tacos with rice and beans on the side.  I got three different meats: chicken, shredded beef, and shredded pork.  It&#39;s impossible to say witch one was the best: all three meats were delicious (and so was the side of rice and beans!)  This is the kind of food you just keep eating long after you&#39;re totally full.  Resist the urge to lick your plate clean...

The only reason why I&#39;mm not giving 5 stars is because the portions have gotten smaller and keep getting smaller and prices keep going up.  I had a torta, 5 tacos and 2 drinks my total was $22 plus tip.  The owner has become more greedy I remember when his portions were at least normal. I noticed the bread for the torta is smaller. So the things that get me mad is the small portions and the high price. Also the restaurant can use some renovations, the restroom is just nasty there&#39;s  some sort of wall paper peeling off.

Before I forget, the salsa is cold and the chips are hard, you will be way better off going to a different restaurant that serves bigger portions and same quality meat."

The cochinita pibil was really good too but it had a few too many onions on it for me but if you love onions, you&#39;ll love it.  We also had their version of a shrimp cocktail, it&#39;s like a soupy concoction with shrimp, avocado, tomatoes, etc.  It was delicious.  We will definitely be back.

I tried the Conchinita Pibil... oh man was it good, juicy pork with pink marinated onions and just the right level of spiciness. I don&#39;t go to Aurora much, but I&#39;m definitely going to try to track that down in Chicago, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s around. There was another dish, the name escapes me, but sort of like a sope, but soggier and bigger, with marinated beef. Good stuff.

Only negative thing I can think of to say: I&#39;d love to see places like this try something new with rice and beans, they were both good but nothing special.

It&#39;s not fancy or anything, but the service was really great, and the prices were totally fair."

The conchinita pibil, was one of them, which is a type of shredded spiced pork that I got in some tacos and tried some cabeza tacos while there.  

Hate to say this, but I was let down by both.  The conchinita pibil and cabeza meat texture were kinda soggy and lacked flavor.  I did like the red onions what were with the conchinita pibil, which gave it a hot/sweet flavor.  Also ordered a pork burrito, which was better than the tacos.  Good combination of all the ingredients, solid!  Jamaica  (drink made with a hibiscus tea leaves) was pretty good as well.  People there were really nice as well!"

This place is down-home, family owned, authentic, FRESH Mexican food.

You can get a beef head taco here!  If that doesn&#39;t make you want to try it, then you don&#39;t get it

To Mike B. who said the food is a little pricey:  compared to what?  This place is cheap.  Maybe the best restaurant value I&#39;ve ever seen.  I think tacos are $1.50 each.  You can easily eat here for $5, and eat like a king for $10-15.

To JR M. who said he needed a suit and tie:  I can only assume you were writing in jest.  This place is as casual as any restaurant you will find.  The only attire they require is shirt and shoes.

We did appetizers at the bar. The bruschetta was great (it&#39;s a sweet bruschetta). We did the chips with guac and hummus and the artichoke dip (delish!)
We had our guests choose from the quiche du jour, grilled salmon salad, chicken salad lettuce wrap and bistro burger. Lots and lots of compliments on the quiche - I totally recommend that. I had the chicken salad and really didn&#39;t like it. It was over dressed and over spiced.

We enjoyed a bottle of the Scott Chardonnay and it was very good. 

Now for the service: we arrived and were sat immediately, but then had to wait for close to ten minutes before a server came to our table. This would have been fine if they were busy, but there were only three other tables. When they finally came we placed our order and then watched as the server went and stood around for another ten minutes before bringing our drinks.

I especially love the decor, so nice for downtown Wheaton. Right across the street from the old Cock Robin. The wine selection is quite nice, larger than your average bistro, two sides of an 8.5x11 sheet. We ordered a bottle of the Gainey Sauvignon Blanc, very good. For dinner my dinner companion ordered the Special Burger, and she had two comments about it. She said that while the burger was extra flavorful, the roasted potatoes were just a tad heavy on the thyme. And don&#39;t advertise carmelized onions if you&#39;re only going to sweat them.

The Cellar Bistro is the restaurant equivalent of Portillios from its overly sprawling menu to its off-putting service. Amish chicken ($23) looked as if it had spent time in the fryer but stopped short of becoming fried chicken, and the &#34;white wine sauce&#34; tasted like flour, water, and packets of Parmesan.

The filet was very so, so in quality for the price. This is a pretty pricey restaurant in downtown Wheaton but has become a hit or miss recently, last 2 visits were total miss.

The ambiance was very appealing - upscale, clean &amp; inviting. The staff was all very friendly and greeted us with smiles upon walking in. The manager had a very good knowledge of the wine list and recommended certain wines to us based off of what we liked. 

We ordered the Baked Brie appetizer and it was absolutely delicious! It came with an amazing fruit spread, some candied pecans and some pears and raisin toast. It was phenomenal. Highly recommended!

I wish we would have had a chance to try more of the food here - everything we saw being served looked amazing. They told us that all of the soups were even made from scratch - and  the Mushroom Brie soup sounded incredible. (I&#39;ll make sure to try that on my next visit in!)

They also have a very nice outdoor dining section if you&#39;re looking to enjoy the summer weather.

I suspect they have vegan options, as the beet burger comes with Vegenaise and is obviously not bound with eggs.

We were here for lunch and ate outside.  The interior looks nice but was extremely over air conditioned.  Prices are what I&#39;d usually expect for dinner entrees; we were also handed a beer and wine menu (I suspect the wine menu is the same as for dinner; multiple bottles in the up-to-$50 range and one $100 champagne).  7 of the 8 appetizers are vegetarian; 4 of the 8 pizzas are as well; 2 of the salads; 5 of the &#34;favorites&#34; and 3 sandwiches; both named soups appeared veg (didn&#39;t ask).

Appetizers and salads are fairly standard without a lot of culinary adventuring, at least for the veg options (hummus; spinach/artichoke dip; bruschetta; pear/walnut salad; beet and goat cheese).

We had the baked brie appetizer; the brie was fairly bland; we liked the quince paste and sugared pecans.  The walnut bread with it was walnut, raisin, and citron - nice, but the citron fought a bit with the quince paste and meant every bite was fruity.  I suppose the brie needed the help.  I had the warm farro salad with kale and chevre, which came with little slices of bread.  There was a lot of chevre, and the salad worked fairly well as a topping for the bread.  The beet burger took an extremely long time to prepare (a warning in the menu would be nice); lunch took us an hour and a half and we really rushed through our main courses due to a 2pm appointment.  The beet burger pleased my companion, who doesn&#39;t usually like beets.  It wasn&#39;t a patty, more like a chopped beet salad (if it was &#34;rolled in walnuts&#34; we missed it).  I thought it was nice enough.  The roasted rosemary potatoes with it were perfection.

I don&#39;t usually pay this much for lunch, and while the food was well-executed, it didn&#39;t truly shine.  I&#39;d come here again when I felt like a splurge staying local with lots of vegetarian options; otherwise I can either really splurge on fancy dining in the City, or eat new American for significantly less nearby, albeit with fewer choices."

Had a good Mother&#39;s day early dinner. We made a reservation but the dining area was fairly full but had empty tables. We were greeted by a server that said our real server would be with us shortly. After awhile another server, a young lady, came and said that she would take our drink order and app order as our server still wasn&#39;t at the restaurant. We hadn&#39;t chosen apps yet, but she brought us drinks. After a few more minutes the young lady came back and jus took care of us the whole time. It appeared the waitress was late for her shift, but other servers did as they should and took care of us.

The bruschetta was very tasty, but the mozzarella on top was very mild and would have been even better with a stronger cheese.

My husband and I split the bistro salad (very good, dressing was perfect, corn salsa added just the right about of sweetness, but could have used more onions-but I like a ton of onions), and the 4 cheese pizza (very cheese, good flavor, perfect crust). My mom enjoyed her wedge salad with seafood salad on top (can&#39;t remember the meals name-was extremely well plated and we should have taken a picture). My dad got the bistro burgers and said that they were very tasty, but thinks there should have been 3 sliders instead of 2. 

I can not comment on the alcohol selections as we did not drink (Tea totaler parents). I skimmed the wine list and didn&#39;t see my go to Riesling but I am always up for trying something new. My husband looked at the beer menu but did not make any comments on it. I&#39;ll update this review as I am sure we will be returning and then I will try something off the drink menu.

Overall, this was a good pick and hope we can have another enjoyable experience here. Some items on their lunch menu also looked good. Also pretty good pricing (98 after tip), for four meals and an app (with 2 sodas)."

But it just doesn&#39;t win overall. Our waiter was a little rough around the edges and took awhile after delivering our cocktails to get our order for appetizers. We ordered the brie and toast points, a dish that has been around, I think, since the restaurant opened. The brie was underheated and hard to spread and the toast seemed a bit stale. For the entree, I ordered the filet mignon, and was pleased that it was only 4 oz., a nice portion. However, it arrived lukewarm on a cool plate. The bacon-wrapped potato and spinach cake seemed like a creative touch but was relatively tasteless (how can bacon be tasteless?). For dessert, I ordered the lemon sorbet, listed first on the menu,  and the waiter came back empty-handed saying they were out (we were eating early on a Saturday evening). It has been some time since we were last here and I was hoping Cellar Bistro had grown as a restaurant. The farm to fork movement is such an important one for the restaurant business and few Wheaton restaurants embrace it. But it is important to get some basics down, like serving food hot, and making sure your wait staff is well trained."

We went for dinner Friday night and it wasn&#39;t very crowded so we were sat right away. We had a waiter who was very friendly and helpful. Service was fine. We started with the crab cakes as others here said they were so good and they were.
She had the pear salad and I had couple of bites and it was also excellent. For my entree I had the chicken saltombocca (I know I murdered the spelling on that ) and it was so so. I wouldn&#39;t recommend the dish.

This is a solid restaurant with great atmosphere and food.  The service was perfect and ther server pointed out some dishes to try.  I began with the tomato basil soup; I love soup because of soups like this.  Then I had two small burgers with garlic and other seasonings.  It was the best of both worlds - got to go to the kind of foodie place my wife likes and I still got burgers and they were outstanding.  Finished up with dessert and went to visit Cantigny.

Historical outing preceded by burgers and accompanied by my wife.  Life is damn good."

I had bookmarked a couple of restaurants in Wheaton and after we parked the car we set off to explore them.  This was the first one we encountered and I just really liked the look of it.  Most people were eating outside the day we went there so we had glorious privacy indoors.  I ordered a raspberry Italian soda and the mushroom/brie soup and both were fantastic!  I thought, wow, this is enough goodness to merit the trip here.

Then we both had hamburgers, my husband had two of the garlic burgers and I had one of the wimpy ones and it was just perfect.  Great meat, delicious bun and crispy lettuce, tomato and onion on top with a homemade mayo/mustard spread.  I adored it.  I had wanted to explore more and maybe get dessert at another spot but I was on a roll.  Could this be the Holy Grail of lunch where I like every single course?

Monty Python has nothing on me so I plunged on ordering a Cappuccino and splitting a cake with my husband.  Not just any cake, no sireee.  This was Kathleen&#39;s Chocolate Cake, I am not lying, it was named after me!  And moist, chocolately perfection that was masterful with my cappuccino.

I liked every single thing I ordered, that is very rare.  I can&#39;t wait to go back.  I just wonder what food they will name after me next!"

I try to give places the benefit of the doubt as I don&#39;t mind paying big money for good food. That was not the case at The Cellar. $10 for chips and guac? $12 for a pizza that had old pancetta on it and $22 for pork tenderloin  that was bland.....salt and pepper weren&#39;t enough to save it. The bill came to $168 including tip.....Ivy would have been a much better spot for that kinda cash. 2 stars given for the hostess and guitarist Jim Perona who is one of the best on the area.

We were initially thrilled to go, because the area was so nice and the outside was adorable. We could not have been more wrong. 

Upon our arrival, we got seated the farthest table in the very back. There was minimal lighting and nobody around us. Every other guest was up in the front by the windows on nice tables. One waiter &amp; one busboy was running the whole restaurant. They were friendly, but very incompetent. We had a artichoke dip for an appetizer, it was okay. And then came our main meals. I had the salmon which was extremely undercooked, to the point where I was concerned I&#39;d be ill after. My boyfriend had the gnocchis and they tasted like nothing. There was no flavor of any sort to them what so ever. 

We asked for the check and nearly fainted at the 60 dollar total when we only had 2 meals and an appetizer...we had water for our drinks!! We waited for 20 MINUTES for the waiter to pick Up the check and left as fast as we could. Extremely overpriced bad food, slow service and a terrible ambiance. I&#39;m very disappointed."

I went here to catch up with two close girlfriends who I haven&#39;t seen in a while. We decided to try a new place and chose Cellar Bistro due mainly to our love of wine. While the wine was good, as well as our dinner, the service was extremely disappointing. 

Our server was very nice and gave great recommendations when asked for her advice on wine and entrees. However, once our meal was complete and we were given the bill, we had someone come up to our table multiple times within minutes of setting down the bill to see if we had taken care of it. Once we paid, a couple minutes later a gentleman, who I can only assume was the manager, asked if we were finished and would move so some people at the bar could have our table. We were enjoying our conversation and thought he was joking. What restaurant asks if you are finished so they can seat other people? 

At first we just kind of laughed it off but when the manger returned yet again and said &#34;I have three nice seats at the bar for you&#34; we were so annoyed that we got up and left. 

It&#39;s unfortunate as the food and wine were good, but I have NEVER had a manager or anyone else at a restaurant ask if we could leave our table so others could use it. We are paying customers and should be able to sit there as long as we please. That is bad customer service and you can guarantee we will NEVER return here again!"

Enjoyed the smaller, intimate atmosphere, and of course the food.  Generous glasses of wine and warm, friendly service.  I think it can be a bit pricier than reflected on Yelp, so that&#39;s my only reason for 4 vs 5 stars.  The manager came over to make sure everything was alright.  Not just a fly by visit, but seemed sincerely interested.  That&#39;s always a nice touch.  Got there around 5:45 on a Friday night, had made reservation.  Was fairly quiet at that time, but was full up by the time we left.  Mushroom Brie soup recommended by my friend was excellent.  I had a Dover Sole special which was very good, but on the pricier side.  Parking garage close by, but you may find street parking depending on the time."

It was hopping at 9 pm on a Saturday evening which is a good thing.

We scored 2 seats at the bar pretty quickly and sat for a couple cocktails and dessert. The bar was friendly and they had many good choices of wine by the glass at good prices. The bartender was welcoming but not particularly knowledgeable about the wine. Oh well, I can pick my own.

I have a thing for creme brulee so we ordered that and their dessert special marscrapone cake. Okay, my creme brulee thing goes way back, to like childhood. Seriously. Good creme is hard to find but I keep trying and trying. I found some delish creme Saturday night in downtown Wheaton...mmm hmmm. The marscrapone cake was nothing to mention

The place is very cute...fits the name perfectly. :-) Our waitress was friendly and helpful since it was our first time there.
We started with Mushroom Brie soup (sooo good I practically licked the bowl) and cauliflower curry soup (I hate cauliflower...but it actually was good). 

Then we ordered the sliders and pizza...wow was I surprised by the size of my pizza (hoooray for leftovers!) We really liked the food and I loooooved the unique potato salad that came with the sliders!

 We shared the bruchetta appetizer. It wasn&#39;t very good. It had a really strong vinegar flavor and hardly any cheese. I had the beet salad, which was fresh and delicious. I then ordered the tuna wrap. It was good, and the price was right. I think it was $10, which was one of the cheapest thing on the menu. The tuna was cooked perfectly and the wrap was tasty. However, I was not a fan of the potato salad side that came with the wrap.

I&#39;m new to Wheaton and read so many wonderful things about this place we could not wait to try what sounded like a &#34;gem&#34; of Wheaton. 

Our waiter took 20 minutes to come to our table. He stopped by after 10 minutes to say he would be there, but it took him another 10 minutes to then finally come bring us drinks - let alone water. He was clearly overwhelmed, having been given too many tables, so I think it&#39;s the fault of the restaurant owner/manager. 

One enjoyable item was the bacon wrapped dates. However, I&#39;ve had them just as well prepared elsewhere, if not better, and $14 for six of them was too much to pay. 

The pear salad was awful - far too much cinnamon, missing acidity in the dressing, and had the oddest seasoning combo. Just a big miss. 

My friend enjoyed the scallops, and were likely the best of all we ordered. My salmon was poorly prepared: overcooked, tough to cut, little to no seasoning or taste, and the mustard on top was basically squeezed on like you would do to a hot dog. The polenta was more like a polenta cake - chewy, tough to cut, and missing any real flavor. Also, the entire dish was not served hot - so disappointing. 

Was expecting so much more!"

This isn&#39;t because there are so many home run menu items, it&#39;s because their menu always seems so limiting.

The Bistro clearly built its establishment around serving wine: their wine list is pretty sizable, the decor is nice but subdued at the same time, the lighting is easy on alcohol-induced glazed eyes, and they even have paintings on the wall of wine or people sipping on wine.

Wine is great but if your party&#39;s not in the mood to throw back a few bottles, your choices are numbered. As far as beer is concerned, they have Miller Lite and one Two Brothers brew on tap, and they may have Beck&#39;s in bottles. And that&#39;s it.

Their food items are all geared toward a higher-end audience: they&#39;re all pricey and fancy. My girlfriend enjoys it here so, at times, I&#39;ve come here in a red-blooded American type of mood and I haven&#39;t been satisfied.

Cellar Bistro&#39;s a nice place but it&#39;s kind of like listening to Michael Buble. You really need to be in the mood for it and it&#39;s almost necessary that you have a glass of Pinot Noir in hand -- because I&#39;m not drinkin&#39; any f-ing Merlot!"

We had the shrimp appetizer and then I had the tuna wrap with a pear salad.  Both were very good.  Hubby had a special which was pasta with some tuna on it.  

There was a big table next to us with some kids and they were pretty well behaved.  Two were older and one was a baby.  This is NOT a place for a toddler who can&#39;t stay in his/her seat.  There is nowhere for them to roam!

I&#39;ve had some dietary issues lately and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they have a gluten-free menu here.  There are quite a few items on it, not as many as the regular menu, but still lots to choose from.

We used a restaurant.com gift certificate to pay for our meal and hit a speed bump.  Apparently the restaurant is concerned that gift certificate holders are not going to tip their servers enough.  When we got the bill, the total of our meal showed the gift certificate deduction, but then there was another line that said something like SERVICE FEE and then there was a blank line for a tip.  Neither one of us could figure out what it meant.  A service fee for using a gift certificate?  It was so confusing!  Turns out, that the SERVICE FEE is the suggested tipping amount on your original charge before the gift certificate.  

I didn&#39;t like that whole setup.  It made me feel like I was dealing with a used car salesman and kind of ruined my nice mellow meal."

Street parking was readily available and I believe a free parking lot/garage is around the block. I ordered the Bistro Burgers while  another ordered the salad topped with Salmon, and we shared. I ordered the burgers MR with white cheddar cheese, they arrived well but still delicious, moist and not offensive with garlic. They came with tender, nicely seasoned oven roasted potatoes. The salmon was nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked and the salad was a mix of leaves of many colors, red onions, shaved carrots and capers in a lovely vinegar/oil dressing. Among the 8 diners, an assortment of dishes were ordered, and everyone was pleased. The salmon salad and the burgers were $12 or $14, coffee was $4 and very good, and a cup of the wonderful mushroom, brie soup was $4, bowl is $6. If you like mushrooms, you&#39;ll love this soup. Service was pleasant, prompt and unobtrusive (no &#34;Hi, I&#39;m Bambi and I&#39;m here to interrupt your conversations &amp;/or disturb you every 5 minutes to ask if everything is all right). Samantha and staff were quietly observant and provided what was needed at the proper time. I can only surmise that the complaints here are from envious competitors. The flowers on the table were real. Sidewalk seating is available in nice weather. The chocolate cake dessert was not chocolate in color only, it had a rich chocolate flavor. Our separate checks were handled efficiently and there was no service charge added. These 8 traveled  from LaGrange, Downers Grove, Bartlet, and Schaumburg.

The restaurant is small, or &#34;cozy&#34;, depending on how you look at it. The staff is friendly and we didn&#39;t have to wait at all for a table. They placed us at a 2 seat table in the back corner, which I prefer because I hate sitting out in the middle of the dining room.

We ordered the brushetta (spelling???) for an appetizer, which was really, really good.

For my main entree&#39; I had the grilled salmon. It was juicy (but not soggy) with a lot of flavor and great seasoning. For a side dish, I opted for the garlic mashed potatoes. They were really good, but nothing to get excited about.

And for dessert, my wife and I shared a brownie topped with mint ice cream and whipping cream on the side. I&#39;m a sucker for brownies a la mode! Can&#39;t get enough. Brownies and ice cream go together better than peanut butter and jelly.

Overall this restaurant is great and I&#39;d definitely go back and definitely recommend it. The price is about right for what you get.

My only complaint is that the service is slow. We were on a time crunch so we could see a movie afterward and we ended up a little late. But I wouldn&#39;t let the slow service stop anyone from enjoying The Cellar Bistro!"

The burger I got was the juiciest I have ever encountered, and my only side options were chips or a potato salad (which was craycray good). Very fresh and delicious. A smidge pricey but I would definitely go again."

The place wasn&#39;t even full ( no wait and many tables), however they refused to seat me anywhere except the high top tables. Clearly, with a disability and a dog that does brace work this would not be appropriate. ( I want to be CLEAR they never hasseld me about the dog that was not a problem) I also was by myself with my school books- that&#39;s what I think really did me in. If I had been with a significant other- which I do not have, I think I could have sat in one of the many other open spaces. I chose to pass on the less than optimum seating in favor of another place in downtown Wheaton with a not so snooty staff. I do hear the food is very good here, however I will take my business elsewhere."

This is a place I&#39;ve been meaning to try after being impressed by what I&#39;ve seen on their website (gluten-free items, preservative-free, no microwave)... and after reading the mostly positive reviews here.  I loved the bistro atmosphere, which means that it&#39;s a little noisy - but, it&#39;s &#34;friendly&#34; noise and not too boisterous.  

As other reviews have stated, the mushroom brie soup is absolutely wonderful, and the red and golden beet salad is a delight also.  We all got the specials, with two of us having the New York strip steak with garlic mash potatoes and a kale/asparagus side.  The steaks were both tasty and huge (had to take some home) - the sides were very good, except the potatoes were a little on the cool side (we could live with it).  The other special we had, the grilled red grouper, was a flavorable entree - however, the quinoa tabbouleh and yellow squash sides were a little on the bland side - all still good, however.  The lemon sorbet with raspberries and raspberry sauce was a perfect finish.

Our server Blaine was excellent (I believe I have read at least one other positive review about him here) - including recommending a wine that my rather discerning sister enjoyed.

This is a great place and I look forward to coming back!"

The staff was polite, the atmosphere was nice (like...umm... a cellar bistro kind of) and the temperature was nice even though it was freezing outside and the place is pretty small.

My dad ordered the crab cakes as an appetizer, and I ordered the baked brie.  My dad seemed to like his crab cakes, and my baked brie was delicious.  It came with tiny slices of raisin bread, currant jam (I think), pecans, and pear slices. It was so delicious that I ate the whole brie and almost all the bread, and then I was stuffed and could barely work on my entree.

We both ordered the sea bass that was on special.  It came with leek and potato puree, artichokes,  and green onion and prosciutto and something else green on top.  The fish was cooked perfectly, not too dry.

I brought the rest of it home, and I ate it the next day at work for lunch.  I even skipped going out to lunch with my coworkers because I knew the delicious sea bass was awaiting me in my lunch bag.

Very highly recommend!"

I had high hopes for this place based on previous reviews. I booked a reservation for a Tuesday night, no problem. We arrive and were seated promptly. The place had about three other tables when we arrived for our 630 reservation and by 7:00 almost every table was filled. Now I don&#39;t know if they didn&#39;t schedule enough staff for that evening or if they are just short handed? The same server was waiting on the majority of the tables which in return weeded her completely. Our soup came our before our appetizer and there was a 40 minute gap between the appetizer and entrees! Entrees finally came and it was nothing special, in fact they are over priced for what they serve. Disappointed in every way needless to say. Also,We were celebrating a birthday which was never acknowledge. 
They were under staffed for the night which effected every aspect of what you would expect out of a quality dining experience. Note to the owners, it&#39;s best to staff as if your going to busy and if your not....send people home!"

We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer. Although the dip itself was fine, it was served with chips...not homemade chips, or even thick chips that would have been appropriate with the dish, but chips that looked and tasted exactly like grocery-bought doritos. I understand that restaurants occasionally don&#39;t make every part of what they serve, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever felt like it was this obvious that they just grabbed something from the store and threw it on the plate.

For entree, I tried the Ahi Tuna Salad and Jalapeno, Pineapple, and Prosciutto Pizza. I&#39;ve had better for both dishes. The Ahi Tuna was really warm (which is a little unappetizing with half raw fish), and it was overcooked. They should have taken the fish off the heat a minute earlier. The pizza, on the other hand, was nothing special. It was pretty salty and very generic. 

I will say that I thought the ambience was nice. It&#39;s a very cute restaurant, and there was live music the day we went. Our server seemed a little preoccupied talking with some of her friends, and ignored us for a bit. There was another server working in the same area, though, and he took care of most of our needs. I did really want to like the place, but the food just wasn&#39;t acceptable. My entire party actually said that we regretted coming to this restaurant as we were leaving, so I think that speaks for itself."

Then my husband ordered the Bistro burger, which the waiter was awesome about explaining that it is actually two smaller burgers, and I ordered a cup of the black bean soup and the beet salad.

The decor is, well, bistro.  The first thing we noticed was the high prices for the wine by the glass.  They had one for $7, two or three for $8 and the rest were $9+.  The menu is small.  They were out of the quiche of the day.  Our server told us they only make 7 &#34;pieces&#34; a day.  We opted for the chicken skewers and the grilled salmon salad.  The chicken looked over cooked by my wife said it was OK.  It came with a nice vinaigrette and bibb lettuce not cheap iceberg as you might expect.

I really love Bistro food and found it difficult to make a decision what to order. My sister and I decided to split the pan seared vegetable pizza, and, for a starter, I ordered the citrus salad, and she got the pear salad. After ordering over the phone, the restaurant told us it would be ready in 25-30 minutes which was pretty spot on and there was no waiting when we arrived to pick up the food (despite it being a VERY busy Saturday dinner crowd). It may have partially been the fact that I was totally famished/exhausted, but I thought the food was amazing. My sister and I inhaled our salads and devoured all of the pizza (which if you have a relatively normal sized appetite is perfect for sharing). My mom loved the grilled chicken wrap and the bistro house salad, which sounded delicious, but I couldn&#39;t manage to steal a bite of either...oh well, maybe next time. 

So, as far as take out goes, I give The Cellar Bistro high marks. I must note though, this place really makes me want to come back, split a bottle of wine with friends, and feast on that cheese medley appetizer....doesn&#39;t seem at all like a bad way to spend an evening or two :)"

Server had a nice personality and was somewhat knowledgable about menu and wine list.  But, too many fatal flaws.  First, our dinners were served without forks.  When we informed our server she went inside (we were dining in the outside area) to get them.  About 4-5 mins pass and still no silverware, while our food sits there getting cold.  I go inside to inquire and there&#39;s our server waiting at the bar for my wife&#39;s wine order.  After signaling to her that we still needed forks she eventually brought out the forks and the wine.  I guess she didn&#39;t want to make two trips.  Second, the food.  Small portions for one.  Chicken saltimbocca was tiny, and oddly paired with mashed potatoes and peas.  My fault for thinking this might work because it didn&#39;t.  Third, my wife&#39;s first cut into a large shrimp resulted in the shrimp disintegrating.  That&#39;s right, a soft, bad shrimp.  The odor was indescribable in a bad way.  Lastly, upon informing our waiter of the bad shrimp she said sorry and would Inform the manager.  The check arrives, we get ready to pay a full bill of 100 bucks or so, and I ask her out of curiosity what the manager had to say about the bad shrimp.  Her reply was she forgot to tell him.  Really.  Now, she did adjust the bill by 9.00.  Fair enough, a simple apology and please come back would have sufficed.  One and done."

Server accidentally dropped a wine glass on the patio table, it shatters onto my husband, his person, my legs and the ground. We were moved to a new table and it was cleaned up..after another couple took the table. Apology was rapid but distracted. 
No utensils on the table for half the meal. We asked twice. We ended up sharing forks and one napkin for half the meal.
The appetizer was mushrooms stuffed with blue cheese. Little hints of blue cheese and mostly Alfredo sauce inside of mushrooms that came with tortilla chips as garnish. Tortilla chips? With mushrooms? 
Pizza with chevre, olives and bacon but smothered in  gobs of shredded mozzarella? 
Dessert would have been nice. We didn&#39;t have time. We asked for the check to be forgotten, again. My husband went inside to get it. The woman we asked for the check didn&#39;t relay to our server who seemed baffled.

So many things could be done to help this bistro. Wheaton needs one. With all the BMW&#39;s cruising by, the potential is there. In my opinion, it falls flat. Tonight, it was confused food without a chef looking it over or coukd care less a out taste and experience. (Tortilla chips as garnish at a bistro; those corn chips were going out with at least three appetizers I saw.)  

 At each and every point during the meal your service lacked grace or could make an elegant decision that would cost you a 30$ bottle of wine. You shatter a glass on us, you buy the person a drink. It&#39;s the polite thing to do."

We came for an early dinner, with a last minute reservation. Located in charming area of Downtown wheaton. Relatviely empty upon arrival, full when we left.

I had The Wrap with grouper fish - it was unexpectadly, but very good. It came with a garlic potato salad which was the hit of the meal. It contained red potatos, chives, mayo, parsley, and garlic. Unusually, tasting, but the best potato salad I&#39;ve ever had.

My three kids ordered pizzas - A Margarita which could have been good, but was too bland, A Pepperoni &amp; Bacon which had a tasteless crust, and a Kid&#39;s vcheese which was very oilly. Cellar Bistro has a brick oven, so their pizzas COULD taste fantastic, but from what I tried, they were only average. 

That being said, you don&#39;t go to a French-style bistro for the pizza.

My final guest has a severe gluten allergy. She ordered Pork medallions with fruit and nuts,  and a sweet potato mash. She isn&#39;t open to new foods, but she loved this.

So, we went on Valentine&#39;s Day, which may not be the best time to visit somewhere for the first time, but we couldn&#39;t make up our mind on where to go so we just popped in here after driving around downtown Wheaton for a while. 

We didn&#39;t have a reservation, and despite the room being mostly empty were told we would have to wait for them to figure out where to put us. Ok, understandable. We got a seat by the window, which was nice. Pillows on the banquette were a nice touch. However, it was freezing cold and I had to wear my jacket throughout dinner. Mood lighting was nice, and they had a guitar player noodling around to add to the romantic atmosphere.

Wine list is not vast. A couple of choices in each category, many that you can find at Jewel or Dominick&#39;s. No flights available. A little disappointing for a wine bar.  We ordered cosmos to start, which were not very tasty and $11 each. No garnish or anything special about them at all.

The set Valentine&#39;s Day meal was a 5 course for $50 or so, with choice of fish or beef. We didn&#39;t know this going in but decided to roll with it since it was getting later in the evening.  We sat for a long while before someone came to take a drink order. We asked about the menu and were put off. Little menu cards would have been a nice touch. We told our waitress about my allergy and when the other waitress brought out the appetizer it was not edible due to my allergy. Zero communication between waitress #1, #2 and kitchen.  They quickly made an adjustment for me, which was great.

Appetizer was good, creamy leek soup was divine, the salad was gross (shredded lettuce? really? very Taco Bell), entrees were so-so and dessert was just fine. I didn&#39;t feel like we got our $50 worth... quantity of food was there but quality definitely was not. We left full but not satisfied. 

Overall, we&#39;ll probably go back to try this place on a non-holiday, non-special menu day, but honestly we may just go to sit at the bar and enjoy the ambiance, since the food was so not impressive."

We ordered our martinis - his was a cosmo - oddly un-garnished, but tasty.
My classic gin martini was tasty, but a bit watered-down. We were thrilled to hear that they had a lobster bisque. Who doesn&#39;t love a smooth, thick, creamy lobster-y bisque? 
It showed up promptly, watery, with corn, chunks of stringy lobster, and did we mention WATERY?
It did not even smell like a bisque. It was more a thin chowder. We explained this to our waitress, who said &#34;well, they call it bisque, it&#39;s bisque&#34; (with a nervous giggle.) We did not stay on for dinner as we had planned, fearing the shrimp scampi would not be shrimp, or some other atrocity."

I guess that&#39;s why it&#39;s good we don&#39;t all like the same things. Then life would be boring.

Let&#39;s start with what I love about this place. The atmosphere, it&#39;s wonderful cozy romantic spot for dinner and that was the draw for me and my &#34;date&#34;. On a side note, my date is married - to someone else. We used to be co-workers but now she&#39;s my best friend. Unfortunately  she and her husband don&#39;t get out often so we try to have dinner whenever I&#39;m in town. Nothing more than that. But I digress.

Now on to what I&#39;m not a fan of. The bar, great bar, knowledgable bartender, but only two choices of Vodka? Supposedly they were waiting on an order to come in. HMMMM

On to the appetizer. We started with their form of bruschetta. Way too much vinegar. Dinner was also not memorable. Next we shared a plate of pesto stuffed mushrooms. Quite frankly I thought they forgot the pesto. I couldn&#39;t taste it at all. We ended the evening with a cheese medley which wasn&#39;t bad, but not memorable.

Utlimately it was a wonderful evening, because I got to spend it with one of my most favorite people in the world. Next time we&#39;ll go somewhere else on our &#34;date&#34; 

Now I&#39;ll probably regret writing this reveiw because when I reviewed the Mexican place down the street the manager bordered on harassing me over his staff. Sorry, I just didn&#39;t like The Cellar Bistro, some may, I don&#39;t.

But, if you&#39;re just looking for a friendly place to have a drink I would recommend The Cellar Bistro. Just don&#39;t stay for the food."

I understand some of the low rated- reviews here, but my experience was superb! I orded the lasagna and it was probably the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had! My boyfriend and I are going back next week so he can try it!
The atmosphere is very cozy and the people are very nice, despite what other reviews here have said.

If I were you, I&#39;d give it a try!"

The dining room is very small and inviting. However, we were seated at a table that felt like it was in the middle of an aisle, and we had wait staff and other customers trying to squeeze between our table to get to other tables or the kitchen. The food was spotty; I ordered the lamb with cherry compote and was blown away by its taste and presentation. My husband agreed that it was very delicious. However, my husband&#39;s bison ribeye was lacking any flavor and it was overcooked. We&#39;re unsure whether we would return because of the range of quality in their entrees; if every dish was like the lamb, we would be back in a heartbeat!"

The first time we must have walked in just about the same time as everyone else.  Even though they were busy the food was well prepared and our server (Meghan) was attentive.  The next time we came in it was slow.  Meghan remembered us, the drinks we ordered, as well as our food order.  The service and food were great! We had the mini burgers and Margharita pizza. The price is not too bad either.  If you are looking for a quiet place for a nice meal on a Tuesday night, this is a place.

Definitely for adults though.  I think kids wouldn&#39;t like it."

I was impressed by the interior and it had a good ambiance.  Wait staff was polite but not very helpful in suggesting a wine.  I was a bit surprised to see that the menu was very small and limited.  Not many options if you are a picky eater.  I was pleased that the portions were actually appropriate for one person.  Being a Dietitian it&#39;s nice to see correct portion sizes!  My date finished his whole plate and I finished all but a few bites.  Overall, I think this was an OK meal.  I was a bit surprised though that the menu didn&#39;t reflect items that are in season as they advertise they use local produce.  I would recommend going if you like a small, warm environment and if you are not too particular about options.  If you like to visit and drink after dinner they close early so you will need to find another after meal stop."

I made a reservation, but the only tables were bistro tables, so mom and I decided to wait until a lower table was available and sat at the bar.  We ordered a bottle of Woop Woop Shiraz and it was wonderful.  Our bartender, Jerry, was very nice in his recommendations and service.  

When we were seated, we got our appetizer osf3 dips with crostinis and chips.  Delicious! Especially the red pepper and white cheddar dip.  I definitely recommend this!  Yum!

I had the red and yellow beet salad with goat cheese, and my mom had the deconstruted blue cheese salad.  Again, delicious!

Then on to our entrees.  I had the chicken saltimbocca and mom had the surf and turf.  A medium rare prime ribeye, perfectly cooked scallops, and beautifully cooked large prawns.  We both had creamy but chunky garlic mashed potatoes, I had peas, she had mushrooms.  I can&#39;t say enough how delicious both of our meals were.  We got another bottle of wine when our first ran out. This time, Rivere, a Spanish blend.  Another yummy bottle with just the perfect bite and smoothness.

Even though we both had leftovers from dinner, we ordered the chocolate cake a la mode to share.  I was pleasantly surprised as I don&#39;t normally like cake.  It was amazing!

In short, we both highly recommend The Cellar Bistro. It was the best experience we&#39;ve had at a restaurant in many  many years.  Our server, Blaine, was exceptional in his service and recommendations and the assistant manager (I am embarrassed to say I do not remember her name), was also very nice and made sure we got our cake for free for my birthday.

Jose is the chef - he deserves a lot of credit here - he is obviously an amazing cook as well as leader in this kitchen - and I would not change a thing about our meal."

The decor is a little cheesy, a little too &#34;SEE!  WE HAVE WINE BARS IN THE &#39;BURBS!&#34;  but maybe that&#39;s just me being an urban snob.

The food was very good.  I had mushroom brie soup, which was delicious and very generously sized.  I also had the caprese salad, which was very fresh.  I did not care for the balsamic glaze, but I am a caprese purist - I like mine like they make it in Italy: tomatoes, fresh mozz, basil, olive oil, sea salt, pepper.  No balsamic.

A colleague had a delicious-looking crab and avocado salad.  I didn&#39;t hear any complaints from any of my dining companions.

All in all, it was quite good."

The BBQ shrimp with blue cheese grits was the best meal I&#39;ve had since my last birthday. I&#39;ve been dreaming about those damn grits. The husband enjoyed his lasagna and the mushroom brie soup was spectacular. It&#39;s a nice place inside. The pictures on their web site make it look cheesy and like it&#39;s trying too hard. They need to get someone beside a 17 year old with a point and click camera to take some professional photos. The service was great too. We each got soup, a main dish, split a dessert and a bottle of wine for about $80."

We arrived at 6:30, and the place was packed.  This is definitely a place to have reservations at dinnertime.  

There just happened to be a 2 top table available, and we were seated.  The server was great and their menu really does have a Bistro feel.  Some smaller fare, a variety of cheese plates, and a fantastic wine list. 

The atmosphere at dinner time is a bit frantic, though I can see this place having a more intimate feel later in the evening. 

A great lucky find."

The Good IMO:  Staff.  All of them were very nice.  Welcoming and friendly.  Decorated nicely.  Prices decent.
My kids enjoyed their pancakes, bacon, French toast.  :)
The Bad IMO:  I ordered a skillet with over easy eggs.  The eggs were cooked hard.  Literally yolks were like eating a hard boiled egg... no wet yolk.  The meat, and potatoes in my skillet were also over cooked.  

****Before paying for my meal I already decided we won&#39;t be back.  After the kindness of the woman at the cash register asking how my meal was... and apologizing for the over cooked eggs...she took it off my bill.  She promised they will be perfect next time.

Either way, not a great start.

I had the orange juice, and a chicken salad meal, which was great. My brother had a panini, which he enjoyed. my father had the pancakes and eggs, which he said were very good.

Great portion size for their price, it was around $10 a person for drinks and food.

I order the special two eggs, tow pancakes, and two bacons.  I was so delighted to have had my order how I like it.  I read of two eggs there were four.  I don&#39;t like bacon so I had a substitute.  I ordered sausage instead I received tow if those but they were a pretty size and  very delicious.  It came with fresh squeezed orange juice and fruit in the side.  The pancakes were made to perfection.  I was so happy I did not go to McDonald&#39;s by myself. 

My husband ordered stake and eggs.  His order had 3 big platters one with his huge stake and fresh not frozen broccoli.  One order of pancakes.  On the third plate he had four eggs, hash browns and fresh fruit.  Wow this was amazing.  I had only had this kinks of breakfast in Canada back in the day.  They give you so much food and is fresh not burned..

No wonder my husband was upset when we took him for potato pancakes at this other restaurant there the food was horrible he got sick and I just could NOT eat those sweet potato pancakes.

I recommend this restaurant in a second.  I did not know I had such a great restaurant walking distance.  Yum.  The restaurant is clean and big.  It is also cozy.

I know quite a few people who have gone here and have raved about it. Perhaps we came on an off-day, but I wasn&#39;t impressed.

We arrived at about 11:30 which was perfect. We waited for a table for about 20 minutes, which wasn&#39;t too bad. Quite a few groups checked in after us, so I&#39;m sure their wait was considerably longer.

We were seated in a corner booth, much to my delight. I&#39;m really not a fan of eating at a table in the middle of restaurants; I feel like I&#39;m being judged. Tucked away in the corner is my happy place.

After looking at the menus, I immediately decided upon the Mexican skillet, with my eggs over easy. I had a choice of pancakes or toast, and I opted for the later (wheat, not white).The bf chose a corned beef omelette with an english muffin. After much deliberation, we agreed to get a side of bacon to share even though it was almost $4. 

Our food arrived about 15 minutes later and immediately I noticed the absence of salsa, which is supposed to come with the skillet. After waiting for our waitress to come near us again, I finally caught her attention and requested the missing salsa. She asked if I wanted sour cream too, and I told her that I would.

The bf thought his omelette was just okay, stating that there could have been more corned beef. His hashbrowns weren&#39;t very crispy, but rather on the undercooked side.

While we were dining, the power went out twice, which caused some children at a nearby table to yell &#34;what is going on here?!?&#34; I thought it was funny, but I agreed with their concern. The bf immediately thought of refridgeration issues and improperly cooked food items. I don&#39;t know if this happens often or if it was a fluke, but it was irritating nonetheless.

We managed to get through our meal and  waited for the waitress to come by again. This time it took her much longer to make her appearance so we could request the check, which was frustrating because we had finished eating ten minutes prior. The buss boy attempted to remove my plate even though I still had half of my food left. I requested a box, and he brought one quickly, much to my surprise. I should have asked him to flag down our waitress.

I will say that the coffee is good, but honestly I wasn&#39;t overly impressed by Egg Yolk. I thought my meal was good, but I&#39;ve had similar items at other establishments, and I&#39;d prefer going to those places as the service is better."

We were going to Kline Creek Farm and faced with limited options, both agreeing reviews, pictures and the menu at Egg Yolk looked good. 

When we got to Egg Yolk on a Sunday morning, we were told it would be a 15-30 minute wait which seemed reasonable. When we were called to be seated, they actually had called us before another table and the other lady made a seen about us being seated first. We just stood confused as we honestly had no idea who was there first or what was going on...but it put us in an uncomfortable situation and I think their hosting needs to keep better tabs on things. Now when we were sat, we waited. A lot. Like 15 minutes before we were even greeted. And then she had to get us menus. After she dropped those off, it was another 15 minutes before she came back to us. It was a bit frustrating waiting 30 minutes just to place our orders. 

We finally got to order and the food was eventually brought out to us - again this took quite awhile. And she set it down and walked away before we had a chance to remind her we had no silverware. So we sat for another 5 minutes with our food in front of us but no way to eat. When she came back around, she was of course apologetic that she didn&#39;t realize we had silverware. She snagged it off another table and all was well in the world. I understand it was busy and it&#39;s a diner but there were some serious service flaws.

For brunch I had a delicious ham &amp; cheese omelette. The cheese oozed out of it when I cut into the perfectly cooked egg. Everything tasted very fresh to me, perfectly sized pieces of ham, very enjoyable. The hashbrowns that came with it were different than any I&#39;ve previously had. The shreds of potato were more thick but still soft &amp; crispy in all the right spots. 

Overall, our meals were good, service wasn&#39;t but it could have just been an off day. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to go back but would prefer trying somewhere else before returning."

Maybe I went on an off day, or maybe this is how it always is, but the service was really bad. What should have been maybe 40 minutes top for a meal turned into an hour and a half just because the waitress couldn&#39;t get our food to us in a timely fashion and made us wait 30 minutes to get our check. Believe me, if it was busy, I wouldn&#39;t have minded so much. But, it was just a basic crowd. Nothing special about it.  

The food? Meh, pretty good. It wasn&#39;t anything to brag about. Basically all the same options that any other breakfast place has. I did have breakfast though. Their lunch menu looked decent too. Maybe their lunch is better?

Maybe next time will be better? I&#39;ll update if it is."

The pancakes I get chocolate chips but they just add a sprinkle on top, not melted in the actual pancake, for a $1 extra. Not worth it.

The most important part, the food was fantastic! I got the Wisconsin omelette, which has 3 types of cheese in it, and the hash browns, which were amazing.

Also, they were open on both Thanksgiving and Christmas which worked out nicely for us as we&#39;re too pathetic to make ourselves breakfast.  

The food is always really good.  Greg almost always gets the corned beef hash and eggs, Sue has the pancakes that come with it, and I get confused because the menu is too big.  They have a hawaiin omellete (I believe they call it the Hawaii Five-O, which is silly, so I&#39;m refusing to call it that), that is really good.  It&#39;s canadian bacon, pineapple, and cheese.  I&#39;ve also had the biscuits and gravy, they were really good.  They have tuna salad stuffed pineapple and I appreciate the attempt at stuffing something but let&#39;s be serious, just put the tuna salad on a plate with chunks of pineapple.  I won&#39;t mind if it&#39;s not in an uncut half of a pineapple that I now have to awkwardly cut up with a butter knife.

It wasn&#39;t too busy but the placement of our table was kind of awkward.  One side was flush against another table, and the other side was into a walking area.  Fortunately nothing happened, but it was kinda awkward.
The food was pretty good.  I got some crepes and they were good.  Coffee refills were quick.  The orange juice tasted fresh squeezed, and was tasty.
The only thing I dislike about these places is the price of their a la carte eggs.  I mean 5.49 for 2 eggs.. C&#39;mon man.
But that is typical of most breakfast joints.

The food in general wasn&#39;t too salty and came out pretty hot.  There are quite a few options which is always nice.  The eggs benedict were good and their hash browns also had a nice brownness to them.

They have turkey patties as a replacmeent for pork."

They have an excellent new menu. The food quality seems improved too. The prices are reasonable and affordable. They now have freshly squeezed orange juice and the serving size is generous. Their strawberry crepes are AMAZING and come with a bowl of fresh whipped cream- you get three big crepes- wow. I had a breakfast combo with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and french toast and ate every bite.  

The service is very good too, with some familiar faces from the Sandpiper. I appreciated that our server checked on us a lot but just walked by intentionally, without interrupting our conversation- it was a perfect balance and we always had just what we needed. I also liked that they leave a carafe of water with lemon on your table so you can refill your own water as needed instead of it happening throughout the meal and you feeling like you have to stop your conversation each time.  

This is a comfortable restaurant and a great place to have a good conversation over great food and great service. I look forward to trying their lunch items eventually too.

When driving on a Sunday morning to visit a different breakfast place, I missed a turn and the yolk was one me as I wound up stopping here instead. Having spotted it from the nearby intersection I decided I was hungry enough to just give it a try, and boy was I in for a treat.

Egg Yolk Cafe is a very typical breakfast/diner restaurant. The decor inside is pleasant, the place itself is very clean. There&#39;s high ceilings and even a skylight. The inside is surprisingly spacious and well decorated for a family diner. After being seated I looked over the menu and quickly identified a Mexican skillet as the menu item of my desires. Shortly thereafter a waiter came to the table, took my drink and food order, and within about 10 minutes my food had arrived at my table. 

While the place is clean, spacious and aesthetically pleasing, it would all be in vein it if the food weren&#39;t up to snuff. The Mexican skillet I ordered came with lots of cheese, eggs and clearly lots of spicy chorizo sausage ground up on it. There were a few jalapeno peppers in the skillet as well to give it that extra bit of spice. I was also given two bottles of different hot sauces.  The dish was garnished with a strawberry in the corner to give it an extra appetizing look. The first thing that&#39;s notable about this particular skillet is that the potatoes covering the bottom of the skillet were very well seasoned and well cooked and were quite flavorful. Often times when ordering skillets I find places serving bland, flavorless, unseasoned potatoes as filler. The potatoes here had some hot and some caramelized onion mixed in. This along with other seasoning added some extra flavor and were easily the best hash potatoes I&#39;ve found at the bottom of a skillet. I seriously wish other diners would try these skillet potatoes out and take notes on how it was done. The eggs were made well, and there was a generous amount of cheese and meat on the skillet. It was spicy, but not too spicy, and the extra hot sauce bottles allowed me to add a little extra kick if I wanted it.

I also opted for pancakes instead of toast. These were fairly average pancakes with nice thick syrup that had a good amount of flavor. While there wasn&#39;t anything particularly unique about these flapjacks, but they were a nice compliment to the skillet.

Overall I was extremely pleased with everything about my experience at Egg Yolk Cafe. This is an egg-cellent place to grab breakfast and I will definitely be coming back in the future, just writing this review makes me hungry for their food. I HIGHLY recommend the Mexican skillet here, and I&#39;m going to give this place a well deserved and somewhat difficult to obtain from my grading standards five star review."

We were immediately run down by 4 bus boys that seemed to be in a rush.  Not one of them excused themselves or apologized for their rudeness.  After about 5 minutes an &#34;owner&#34; looking man asked that we wait a moment, so we did still wanting to check out the newly renovated space.  A family of 6 came in 5 minutes later and told the owner that they were just going to sit over &#34;there&#34; and took their seats.  I gave the owner a sour look as we had already been waiting and there were only 2 of us.  He grabbed a couple of menus and sat us at the nearest table.

The waitress had informed me that the Corned Beef Hash was &#34;homemade&#34; when I asked, so I was pretty excited to order that with a couple of scrambled eggs, hash browns, and pancakes.  My boyfriend ordered the Potato Pancakes along with some bacon and scrambled eggs as well.  I also asked that they bring out a new pitcher of water as the ones they leave at the table have lemon in them and I cannot have lemon at all.  The guy acknowledged that he understood, yet all he did was dump out the water in the pitcher and refill it.  My boyfriend did a quick taste test of it and confirmed that I couldn&#39;t drink it.  I nicely asked the waitress for just a straight up class of plain water.  She was nice enough to oblige.  

When we received our food I was dismayed to find out that the Corned Beef Hash was not &#34;homemade&#34; as I was told previously, but just the canned stuff browned up a little.  Complete disappointment.  My boyfriend&#39;s Potato Pancakes were a little floury and contained corn as well as carrots.  They were quite bland and could use some seasoning since all I really tasted were the corn and four.  Overall everything was pretty greasy and nothing really had any seasoning!  I was pretty disappointed as I&#39;ve wanted to try this place out ever since it changed over!  I drive past it every day on the way to work and the positive reviews only heightened my interest even more... Needless to say we won&#39;t be coming back!"

I dined here for lunch during their early transition period. The menu is a standard breakfast &amp; lunch only menu focusing primarily on breakfast entrees...  pancakes, crepes, waffles, omelettes, other egg dishes. Their lunch items include soups &amp; salads, paninis &amp; wraps, various sandwiches and burgers.

Although I stopped in during lunchtime, I chose to try a bacon and avocado omelette with hash browns and wheat toast. The omelette was nicely shaped and folded, covering almost half of the plate. It was slightly overcooked for an omelette, but I was okay with that since I don&#39;t like runny eggs. Hash browns covered the other half of the plate. The bacon was fine, but the avocado was not very appealing. 

At first I thought they made a mistake and added mushrooms to my omelette. I don&#39;t like mushrooms, so I began picking them out of the eggs. But upon further inspection, I realized the brown pieces were indeed avocado pieces. Now, I&#39;m no chef and I don&#39;t know if the cooking process affected the color of the avocados, but I know I&#39;ve had green avocados in an omelette at other restaurants... which causes me to think that these ones were old and brown when they were were added to this omelette.

Anyway, the service was good and friendly (their saving grace). And I am pleased to see that this restaurant space did not ultimately shut down, but rather is being redefined. So for now, I am stretching to give it a 3-star rating, and I&#39;m hoping the kinks in their food prep or freshness will be worked out soon.

I work in West Chicago, and I will be back once they are in full swing to reevaluate their quality, for better or worse. So, give them some time to make their transition. But for now, don&#39;t order an omelette with avocados.

Oh, and new for this restaurant: Free WIFI... yeah!"

They were very accommodating to my request of extra veggies in my breakfast skillet and it comes with 4 eggs!!!  The pancakes were amazing!  I only had one complaint, we waited a good 25 minutes for our food, but it was very busy, full at the time we were there. Once our food came, it was all together and all hot, and our waitress was attentive and came around with coffee refills regularly. If I lived in West Chicago, I would definitely come back."

egg-yolk-cafe-west-chicago,Elizabeth W.,lTvtN6Ype23fHMzIc8bb8w,"Des Plaines, IL",0,1,1,279,126,c8DE05jRFs_-hdajk_pW1w,3.0,2012-01-18,"I had a nice lunch here the other day. It was my second time trying to eat here, and the first time I actually did it. Last time, I saw a line of high school kids hanging out in front and decided to take a pass, since it was cold out and I didn&#39;t feel like waiting. This time, the high school kids were all leaving when I got there. This slowed things down a bit, but I did get to wait inside, so no big deal. My advice to you is to keep an eye out between 11:00 and 11:45 during the week when school is in session if you need to get in and out of here quickly.

I ordered the crepes with strawberries, bananas, and walnuts. I was immediately impressed with the quality of the fruit. Sometimes, a menu will read &#34;fresh strawberries,&#34; but they really mean &#34;fresh from the can.&#34; Other times, the berries are fresh but come doused in syrup, like the canned ones. Here, there were just sliced berries on top of my crepes, which were cool and naturally sweet. The bananas were not brown or mushy. The walnuts were added with a good nut to fruit ratio in mind. These would have been the best crepes I&#39;ve had in a long time, except the actual crepes were slightly undercooked and mushy. Still, they were not undercooked to an unsafe or disgusting level, and the large portions meant I could set aside the few mushy pieces and still fill up on the rest.

I also liked that they give you a full carafe of water here. The service isn&#39;t bad, but it isn&#39;t fast enough to fill up the glass of a pregnant woman who goes through water like Shamu at Sea World. My glass was never empty, but I didn&#39;t have to flag somebody down for more water every five minutes, either. Very nice!

I might bump them up to a fourth star on a later visit if I don&#39;t have to stand around waiting for the football team to clear out because there is slightly more staff to accommodate the lunch rush."

I thought the blueberry pancakes were good but lunch looked good to and was from what I heard from the rest of the family and when i go back I will have to try it.

The service is excellent, the prices are very reasonable and the food is wonderful.
My favorite is the steak and eggs. The skirt steak is always tasty and perfectly cooked. The menu says it comes with two eggs, but I always get 4. (by which I mean they routinely serve the 4 eggs, I have not requested extra eggs) The hash browns are crispy and done all the way through and the toast is fresh from the toaster hot and buttery.  My husband loves the Julienne salad...plentiful, fresh and crispy.
We were not the least bit disappointed to hear they had torn out the bar and are replacing it with a &#34;Party Room&#34; for private events. I think it will be a perfect place for baby and wedding showers or perhaps a dining room for a larger family or group from an office or business.. We wish them much luck !!!!
On Sunday mornings they are packed, but after about 1:00, things slow down a bit and you should have no trouble getting a table."

The atmosphere is really warm and comfortable, and we received a friendly welcome. All of these things are somewhat unusual in my experience at Indian restaurants. All of our food was delicious...they were generous with the paneer, which is often not the case at other restaurants. The breads we tried, batura and butter naan were both very satisfying.

The bathroom was clean. What a bonus!

My only semi-complaint is that there was very strong incense burning when we arrived, but they toned it down when I mentioned that it was bothering me.

The shahi paneer came in a yellow gravy and was rich too. I personally would like to try a red paneer curry next time. The dosa was crunchy and tasty. The chutney and sambar were fresh and tasty as well. I really liked the dosa.

The owners are pretty nice and the atmosphere here has always been very well served. By that I mean is the ambiance is not too loud not quiet, everything is laid out pretty well. There is seating in the back for larger parties and overall you don&#39;t feel too claustrophobic considering this establishment isn&#39;t very large. 

Their food comes out decently quick and they are made to order, NOT frozen. In terms of taste, I&#39;ve never left feeling in satisfied or hungry. Chefs and preps all are from Chinatown so rest assured so do their ingredients. Service for myself and others has always been pleasant and accurate. I would rate this place two stars higher than the newer Minghin Cuisine restaurant down the street in Naperville. 

If it&#39;s not broken, don&#39;t fix it. Will be back again as always."

The broth was soy-heavy, with lots of kamaboko fish cake and the tempura perhaps slightly overfried, but the noodles were still good, hefty and slippery. 

My dad, who doesn&#39;t even like Japanese food and was just along for the ride, was pleased with the appetizer plate of beef teriyaki skewers he ordered on a whim. 

Our waitress was friendly and checked on us a lot (the place was also pretty empty later on a Sunday evening). 

The restaurant has a somewhat dated look and could use some more light in the parking lot (it butts up against the Stardust Motel). 

I would probably try other places before returning, but good service here was a plus."

My time was limited, as I had an appointment scheduled across the street, yet needed to squeeze in dinner, so I stopped in here.  I remembered I had eaten here before, but could not recall why I hadn&#39;t frequented this establishment more often, until now...

I ordered (rainbow roll &amp; shrimp tempura roll) and headed towards the bathrooms to wash my hands.  You literally have to walk through a fabric curtain (yuck) to gain access to bathrooms.  

BUGS!!!   Did I say bugs?  

The ceiling panel had so many dead bugs in it, I stopped looking.  I should have taken a picture.   COLD water in bathroom sink, NO SOAP.  I headed out and was actually going to grab some soap in the men&#39;s bathroom when I discovered a 3rd bathroom for handicap.  I headed in there for soap.  Great some soap. But same infestation of bugs in ceiling panel.

Now how could  all these bugs appear overnight or even in 1 week?  Not.  This is laziness. Months???

I would have left right then, but I am diabetic and my sugar was dropping.

I returned to table.  The waitress knew I was on a timelimit, and informed me she was giving me an order for takeout since I was in a hurry.  I was thrilled and grateful and thanked her!  only to receive a dish of the smelliest sushi I have ever encountered

 I lifted a piece to smell, just to make sure...I went to sample a small corner and really?  A little slimy.  I waited for 2nd dish, thinking shrimp tempura would be cooked, should be okay.  I told the waitress that the rainbow roll was not fresh.  She literally was arguing with me.  I was being as polite as possible.  I had to say please take this away.

I ate the shrimp tempura.  It was okay.  I was praying I would not get sick ...

Omg...would never go back!  Want top notch?  Checkout Chef Soon on Route 53.  Maybe you need to  enjoy excellence for comparison :-)  ...said the nicest possible way

If the parking lot is empty, it is NOT because of construction"

So off we went one afternoon. He was skipping school and I his accomplice. 

It&#39;s very easy to miss with Ogden under construction. The parking lot entrance narrow with construction signs planking each side, I held my breath as I entered, afraid my car would get scratched. My car didn&#39;t scream at me, but there&#39;s definitely only room for a single vehicle at a time to enter or exit. 

It&#39;s not fancy but that&#39;s by no means an issue with me. But I was immediately concerned when the menu listed the bento boxes as &#34;benton&#34; boxes. Benton Box? 

My son had no intentions of eating sushi in my bed, so we stuck it out and took our chances. He ordered a ramen and a Phoenix roll and I ordered a chicken &#34;benton&#34;. His sushi roll was not very fresh tasting. Perhaps construction is driving down business? I&#39;d take sushi from my local upscale grocer any day over what he was served. 

Sadly, the chicken in my &#34;benton&#34; was overcooked and tough. *sad face*. No one should have really high hopes for shrimp around here since shrimp isn&#39;t harvested out of Lake Michigan and the ocean far away..but the shrimp tempura was extra unexciting. Definitely pre-frozen. 

They were very nice and the service was pretty quick. My waiter called me &#34;too skinny&#34; which was the best part of my visit. But I wouldn&#39;t likely return. Face it, you aren&#39;t going to find good Japanese in Naperville. It&#39;s just a fact."

I got three things for myself: pan fried turnip cake, shui mai (pork and shrimp dumplings), and xiao long bao (soup dumplings). For all three it was $15.

My thoughts:
Pan fried turnip cake - pretty good flavor, but it was over-fried/oily and mushy. 
Shui may - things was probably the best item out of the three.
Xiao long bao - i&#39;ve had frozen ones better than this...the flavor was off and (similarly to frozen ones) there was little to no &#34;soup&#34; 

Overall the place was a miss for me. I was aware beforehand that it might be a mistake ordering dim sum from a suburb of Chicago when I&#39;m used to dim sum in NY or SoCal."

It turned out they not only have decent dim sum but also delicious Sushi. To top that off, I really enjoyed the services too. We visited this place twice in a week. 

My kids finished edamame, Xiao long Bao, and pan fried pork buns in no time before I could take a decent picture of those. Chicken congee, steamed chicken feet, and Cantonese shrimp crepe were all delicious with the right flavor. Among the dim sum dishes, my personal favorite is the sesame balls which didn&#39;t have the typical filling of red bean paste but with egg yolk. Very rich but super tasty with the crunchy sweet rice shell. 

I tried the spicy tuna, unagi, and salmon sashimi. All are fresh and flavorful. I liked the spicy tuna the best. Kids loved the unagi - grilled eel.  We also tried the grilled fish jaw based on the photo from a fellow yelper. It had a Very clean taste as it did not have any seasoning on the fish just the nice grill flavor.  An unique dish to eat. 

The owner was there waiting the tables along with another nice lady. Both of them were great with my kids and accommodate us as much as they could. Really enjoyed the chat with them."

Upon entering the overwhelming smell of the fish in their aquariums was a total turnoff. We almost left because of it, but peeked into the dining room and decided to give it a try as the tables were far enough away to avoid the smell.  Also disconcerting was one poor large lion fish in a space of approximately 18&#34; wide by 30&#34; high in an aquarium. He could hardly move. So cruel!  The dining room itself was not pretty nondescript, not very clean either. The sushi however was very good. Unfortunately, because of the condition of the restaurant as well as the smell when you first walk in, I will not be back for dinner. There are better places to enjoy a good sushi in the area.

I was pretty impressed by the google reviews (4.7/5)  and had not yet tried them out yet so I was definitely anticipating much MUCH better.

I decided to try an order of California Rolls for lunch.

They were very small, but an order is 8 pieces for around 5 bucks cannot be beat, right?

Well, the cucumber isnt skinned, the avacodo is browning and the crab and rice/seaweed are dried out and tastes like these were rolls from last night left over in the fridge/or just left out and not freshly rolled to order or even made freshly at all today.

It leaves such a disgusting, invaded feeling in your mouth because you know it isn&#39;t fresh and that makes you start thinking how old it could be and then what conditions it&#39;s stored and prepared in and that quickly made me only more sour in the gut.

Im disappointed as Tairyo also has been slacking on its freshness latley too. There goes two sushi restaurants fairly close to home. 

I will be going in later to get my $5 dollars back because they were that dreadful."

The dishes are all prepared when you order which is why it takes a little longer to get served. But well worth the wait. Nothing is made ahead of time and the dim sum is very very fresh.

Also, the owner and his wife were super friendly and told us all about how they make their dim sum right in their kitchen. Them, their chef and their staff drive in from Chicago each day.

I used to go here when I went to college nearby and the sushi was excellent. The lunch specials were affordable for students and the sushi tasted great. Fast forward three years and I went to Raku and the sushi wasn&#39;t as great, nor did the Salmon steak taste fresh. I Cringed. The fire dragon tasted stale. The only thing I enjoyed was the calamari tempura and miso soup. 

Thinking this was perhaps a bad day I went another time with couple friends and every person was kind of disappointed about their orders but wouldn&#39;t say anything. We talked trash after leaving the restaurant. 

I mustered the courage to go a third time couple years later,as I was in the area, and couldn&#39;t get the memorable college times outta mind. I am sad to say that Raku has gone downhill and I unfortunately won&#39;t ever go back.

Coming from the east coast and always having access to fresh fish, I was a little worried about moving to the Midwest and getting decent sushi. Well, I got better than I was hoping for. I found a place that sells phenomenal sushi. You can tell from the moment you walk in that the fish is fresh because there is no fishy smell when you enter.

There are about a billion (rough estimate) other sushi places in the area, and every other one is better than Raku.  The menu selection is average:  we ordered the Spicy Tuna, Mexican, Rainbow, and Shrimp Crunch.  

Everything was okay, but I mean &#34;okay&#34; as in, it was edible, fairly priced, but really not much better than grocery store sushi.  Some of the rolls fell apart easily, and they charge extra for additional wasabi or ginger, which is kind of lame.  I wouldn&#39;t come here again because I can better quality and variety elsewhere.

The ambience is casual, and the restaurant is dimly lit.  Loud talkers should avoid the place, because I could clearly hear just about every conversation around me.  It isn&#39;t cozy or romantic, and the Christmas lights that are on the windows belong either A) decorating a dorm room or B) on a Christmas tree.

The service was pretty slow too.

Nothing made the experience horrible, but nothing made it great either.  Sushi fail."

Looking to escape the monsoon happening outside, I sought refuge (and piping hot green tea) inside an empty Raku.

I was greeted promptly and with big smiles from the staff of Raku and quickly sat at small booth in the front dining area. The decor is fun with paper umbrellas hanging from the ceiling, a salt water fish tank and geisha statue with stacked sake barrels near the entrance. And my server had a contagious smile and everyone working was friendly and welcoming. 

I started with a standard bowl of miso soup. It wasn&#39;t the best miso I&#39;d ever had and I was a bit disappointed that the bowl was really only barely half full, but it was only $2 and helped warm me up none the less, also helped along by the whole pot of hot tea they left for me on the table. I drank so much, it felt like I could&#39;ve floated out of there. 

My next course involved my go-to spicy tuna roll and a light avocado roll. I felt like the spicy tuna was okay. Not better, pretty good, but not a star and not at all spicy. Then again, it looked like some of their more signature rolls were where the big show was, but I avoided as I&#39;m not huge on tempura but for my next visit, I think I&#39;ll definitely break down and give it a try. They look really well done and other reviewers seem to have enjoyed them. The avocado roll was simple but great. Creamy with plenty of avocado and not the kind of veggie roll where you really only taste the rice.  

I left stuffed for only $14 and some change and happy with my decision to break from my rainy day activities and errands to be greeted with smiles that would stay fresh in memory for the rest of the otherwise grey and dreary day."

The idea of not having to drive from the western suburbs and fight traffic on the way home from Chinatown was definitely appealing.  We tried it out and ordered shrimp dumplings, steamed spare ribs, egg rolls with chicken and taro, BBQ pork steamed buns, and sticky dumpling ( hom siu gok).  Everything is made to order and the wait was very short.  When we went there were only 2 tables ordering.  The other 4 already had their food.  The food was nice and hot and the service was very good. Contrary to what some other reviewers mentioned.  Our one complaint - the food was quite bland which was a big disappointment!  We used lots of low sodium soy ( nice of them to provide this alternative), hot oil and plum sauce to try and boost the flavor.
Our search for good dim sum in the western suburbs continues."

Food: Good tasting traditional dim sum but some of the dishes came out cold and not very fresh. Price was a little bit unfair due to the quality but I suspect they are only doing well because they are one of the only dim sum places in the area. 

Atmosphere: Decent for a sushi restaurant but unusual for a dim sum place. The servers were also all very nice but a little slow and unprofessional. We were also wrongly charged for 6 person tea when we only had 4 people so go over your check before you pay!

SIDENOTE: All dishes were very oily. Most of the dishes were sitting in pools of oil."

Driving around Naperville, for dinner and we couldnt fine anything so I went to my Handy Dandy... CELLPHONE! and yelp =D

First of, yelp sent me to some country club... umm negative! so I drove around Ogden finding this place smh, omg it was right by H MART!! ahah!

Anywho, yelp gave this place 4 stars... and I was hoping it would be because I was getting hangry!! (hungry angry).... and it was better than 4 stars! 

I&#39;m giving this place 5 stars because the sushi taste and smelt fresh. It was smooth, and sweet, the sushi rice was okay, but the quality of fish was just right. OH! I can&#39;t forget about the Sweet Shrimp... om nom nom nom... The shrimp head was fried just right, and the sweetness of the ama ebi with a little bit of masago on it was excellent! 

My gf for the tonkatsu, her go to dish, and it was nice is crispy as it should be. once again the rice was okay. 

Serve was great, maybe because we were 1 of the 2 groups of people there and they were about to close at 10.

Pricing there was fair and great for what you get. 

Def, going back there when I&#39;m in town again... which most likely will happen since I always stay at the Hyatt in Lisle"

Then the server did not show up until 8:50ish. And then she was rushing us by saying it would probably be the last call. (By the way the site says it is open until 10 PM, and they had guests coming in after 9:30PM)

The salad was really good. So we had some hope. The Miso soup not worth remembering, the chicken curry and veggie fried rice were both mediocre. We ordered Rainbow Sushi, California Roll and Spicy Tuna. The spicy tuna was the only good sushi. (How can you mess up California Roll?) We also ordered the Calamari Tempura and it was not good either. 

Maybe we caught these guys on a bad day, but the 4.0 average rating was nowhere to be seen. What I find intolerable is the server LYING about the hours and the last call. 

Oh and they charged a dollar for extra ginger.

I&#39;ll start with dim sum,  as I grew up eating it in Chinatown. I came here with my parents because they wanted to check out a dim sum place closer than the city. I eat the same dishes every time I eat dim sum and the food was not good..... At all. Had to send back 4 dishes because it was still raw in the center. Like cold and pink... And my fried sweet ball with meat had all this white residue on the inside. $50 later we didn&#39;t even eat half the dishes. Would rather drive the extra distance to Chinatown. 

I also ordered the lunch box lunches they offered and I had the fried pork cutlet. It was so thin and hard I couldn&#39;t even bite through it. It was drenched in sauce.

The ambience was cute. Small Japanese place. Servers were really nice and apologetic. I won&#39;t be back. You can get way way way better food for cheaper elsewhere."

7:30pm on a Friday evening | Group of 10 trickle in and are seated immediately. 

We casually order various appetizers and drinks. Everything seems like it will be fine. Just like the start to a horror movie... We should have realized that something was amiss when my younger brother&#39;s appetizer was mysteriously forgotten. Later, we looked back on this seemingly trite occurrence and wished so dearly that we would&#39;ve taken it to mind, instead of brushing it off so flippantly.

8:00 | We&#39;ve all been ready to order for a while and we are trying to make it to Saddle Up for some line dancing before they end it at 10. So, I call the waitress over and ask if we can place our orders. She says yes, and that she will be right back.

She mysteriously disappears for a time - just like my little brother&#39;s appetizer order... Is there something in the restaurant that we don&#39;t know about? Perhaps a wormhole into a different world? Maybe there is a giant monster living underneath that needs constant food and attention. I don&#39;t know. But one thing I do know, there is something fishy about this place - and not just because it&#39;s a sushi restaurant ; )

8:20 | Our waitress comes back to take our order. Now, I&#39;m not the best at math, but I do know that from 8:00 to 8:20 = 20 minutes. What!? 20 minutes!? What was she doing!? Where did she disappear to for 20 minutes!? {Let me take a moment to remind you that we were a TABLE OF 10 PEOPLE}

Also, this is a sushi restaurant, right? So. Like most sushi restaurants - all we had to do was.... hand. her. our. sheets. of. paper. with. our. sushi. orders. marked... she didn&#39;t even have to write anything down. She could have picked up our silly little papers 20 minutes ago and we could have maybe had our food by now...

---

I would like to reiterate my warning from the beginning. If you&#39;ve made it this far and you think you&#39;re doing okay - I&#39;m sorry my friend, but it gets much. much worse.

---

Time passes. Some of us start to believe we are in purgatory. Others begin to eat invisible food off their plates. Everyone uses the bathroom at least once and there are multiple smoke breaks. 

We have drank all of the soy sauce and eaten all of the garnishes from our appetizers.

....Let me remind you that we had wanted to leave by 8:30/8:45 so we could make it to saddle up for some line dancing. Also - this is a group of people that for the most part don&#39;t live near the naperville/aurora area - so we don&#39;t get to go every day. We picked this place specifically because it was close to Saddle Up - and they were able to take a last minute large table reservation. Also I trusted the yelp reviews. I still trust yelp. I won&#39;t take this experience out on yelp. I only wish that my review could count for negative stars so as to help people steer clear of an awful experience like mine. I digress...

9:10 | At this point - we all probably look like that skeleton in Snow White that is reaching through the bars for a jar containing a single drop of water. I actually saw the eyes of a cannibal in my best friend&#39;s expression for a moment and I feared for me life. 

The waitress finally appears from whatever mysterious thing is happening in this restaurant that we can&#39;t see. She comes over to me and I am so excited, my heart almost leaps out of my throat {It&#39;s a good thing it didn&#39;t, because I probably would&#39;ve eaten it - and then I would be dead right now}

She tells me that....
Oh, it&#39;s too difficult to relive. I feel like I may be experiencing minor ptsd from the experience - but I must. push. through. it.

She says.... not apologetically, but in a practical, this is the way life is sort of way: &#34;they are starting your food now&#34;

whuuu? uh. bbbuut. whu. uh. uh. uh!? WHART!? um. EXCUSE ME!?!

I get angry. My boyfriend gets angry. He goes over and at least gets a nice amount off each of our tabs - but nothing could make up for our experience so far. And it&#39;s. not. over.

9:35 | Our food all comes at different times. We all eat it like monsters. One couple gets their food after everyone is done and has to eat by themselves. At this point, I go to the waitress to ask for the bills. 

9:55 | Our bills finally come.

10:00 | We all go home. I guess no Saddle Up tonight.

This is my 5001 character mark."

The exterior of the building looks pretty shady. At first my husband and I were like, &#34;Why did she pick this place of all the Sushi places in Naperville?&#34; She later informed us that she was also skeptical after driving by it, but it got really good reviews! Please do not be fooled by the outside. This place is awesome!

As soon as we walked in, it was like a completely different restaurant. I love the decor, very chic. The ceiling especially. You will see what I&#39;m talking about when you visit. There are cute colored lights everywhere. We were greeted and sat almost immediately which was nice considering it was evening time on a weekend (although she might have made a reservation). Either way, it wasn&#39;t packed. Our waitress was really great. She explained the menu and the specials to us and took our drink orders. They have thai tea, which is a favorite of mine. Theirs is really good!

I can&#39;t speak on the sushi because I didn&#39;t try any but my friends ordered a variety of it and they really liked it. It was also a great price for how much you get considering sushi is normally pretty pricey. I ordered the hibachi and I love it! They brought it out in this pretty little box and it came with sooo much food! I&#39;m talking chicken, steak, shrimp, fried vegetables, salad AND soup, and dessert! All for a seriously great price. My husband ordered the steak curry and it was spicy and delicious.

I will definitely be back here. The service was great and so were the prices. Although the building isn&#39;t much on the outside, the inside is clean and beautifully decorated. I would highly recommend this place."

We were really hungry so we ordered steamed shrimp shumai, gone in like two minutes.
We ordered makimono rolls which are 4 pieces of 4 different rolls which worked perfectly because we got to try more rolls without ordering too much. In that order, it included a california, spicy tuna, eel and crunchy shrimp roll.
On top of those we ordered spicy salmon and raku raku

THEY WERE ALL SO GOOD. except for the california roll, just because it&#39;s so plain compared to all the other rolls we tried. 
The raku raku was good but that might be because it&#39;s fried...after a few pieces it got a little heavy for me..
I think my favorite was the crunchy shrimp roll...

As far as the décor..yes they had there paper umbrellas hanging from the ceiling but the place looked tired rather than fun. We had several different rolls and they were fine. The prices are reasonable but given everything else I prefer Yamado across the street, much nicer and quicker service, food is equal and prices are the same."

We decided to try some sushi in our area. We tried out another restaurant on a recommendation and it was just okay. The next day, the husband decided we should have sushi again, and try a different restaurant, so we did. Funny thing is, I am a vegan, and he is not. At the first sushi restaurant, the waitress looked at me funny and said she could get them not to put crab in the California rolls. I was kinda surprised, as I thought sushi was made fresh. Anyway, at Raku, the waitress wasn&#39;t even phased. She recommended several items, one being the sweet potato rolls. OMG they were delicious. I ordered four rolls and my husband two. I took most of mine home with a unique sweet and sour sauce that had a kick. The staff was very accommodating and welcoming. We will be back, many times."

Step inside and you are shown how great of a place it is and how tasty their cuisine is too, especially the sushi.

When going in for dinner one night with my mother, we were surprised at how great their service and food was. We ordered an appetizer which came out right away, and then we ordered a variety of sushi and maki to share, which was nicely presented and as tasty as it looked. They also kept coming back to refill our drinks as needed too, which is always a plus when eating out.

So step outside your comfort zone, try new places, and don&#39;t always judge a place by how it looks from the road. Give Raku Sushi Gourmet a try if you are a sushi fan."

I&#39;ve been coming here for years since they first opened. The staff is always friendly and goes above and beyond (aways asks how my university education is going...they remember their regulars for sure!) and it doesn&#39;t hurt that the food is awesome. Very reasonable price considering that they will only serve sushi made of fresh ingredients, and if that particular ingredient is unavailable super fresh that day, they will inform you that, unfortunately, that roll is not available. I love the honesty, especially with raw seafood! Recently they started offering dim-sum which is so yummy. If you go I recommend the dragon roll (my favorite) from the sushi menu and the dumplings from the dim-sum menu. In short, I absolutely recommend this place to anybody in the Naperville area.

In browsing through some yelp reviews I noticed a couple of customers point out that at busy times they seemed to wait for their food. I just want to throw out there, that, yes, on a Friday night at 8:00pm with a party of 10 people, your food is not going to be ready by 8:15pm. To be honest, I&#39;d rather figure an extra ten minute wait for my dinner and know my money is going toward a hard-working family business, rather than some McDonald&#39;s-esque business who could have my food out in 5 minutes, is worth it to me.

P.S.: They do takeout too!!! Box everything very conveniently and have it ready for you ASAP"

Food takes forever to come out. And don&#39;t bother asking for anything else once you&#39;ve ordered your food. They won&#39;t remember what you asked for or bring it to you when you don&#39;t need it anymore. Now to the food. Tried the chicken udon soup. I loved it. It&#39;s very similar to &#34;kow piek sin&#34; aka Laotian chicken noodle soup. Also tried their fried rice and yakisoba. Both good but wish the portions were bigger. Overall I&#39;d continue to go here because it&#39;s not too far and prices are decent.

The varied menu includes grilled skewer appetizers, miso, tempura, curry over rice, fried rice with a choice of meats, and noodle soups. The shrimp shumai appetizer was very good. There is an extensive list of maki rolls. Everything we ordered was good, but lacked a bit in visual presentation. The Hamachi Guacamole roll had a nice zing of lime to balance the mild fish. The Fire Dragon with scallop, tuna, cucumber and avocado was also very good. The Lion Dance was ok but had too many tempura crumbs dumped on top. Prices are reasonable."

The food was great and it was cheap!&#34; and yet, you have never returned? This is that place for us. We have very positive feelings towards it, but have yet to go back. It&#39;s still in business, so it must be doing well, because businesses that do just ok in Naperville don&#39;t stay open very long!

We got a huge boat of sushi with 5 rolls and several pieces of nigiri. Plus a couple bowls of miso. It was all about $50. The place was empty, and out of every corner of the place there appeared to be employees smiling at us. At one point we looked towards the kitchen and three people (from the back) were looking at us, smiling. It was a bit goofy. Maybe because we were the only people there and they wanted to ensure our satisfaction was through the roof. Either way, I can&#39;t say anything bad about this place. Maybe I&#39;ll head there sometime soon."

Instead, I surprised her with a houseful of family members, great Filipino and Chinese food, and some excellent ice cream cake.  The next morning, she flips over to tell me:  &#34;You still owe me sushi!&#34;.  What an addict.

That&#39;s the start of why we made our way to Raku Sushi.

1st off, pricing on their sushi/sashimi is quite reasonable.  All orders are for TWO pieces of sushi, so perfect for a date, and far better priced than most sushi joints.  On my personal experience of quality scale, it is squarely a medium, to mid-high level quality of fish.  Ordered up our standards:

Tamago - Slightly sweet egg, super tender.  Good start.
Sake - Nice fat lines, breaks with each bite perfectly without stringiness, no fishiness, and light flavor.
Unagi - Meaty with just a little bit of crisp on the side.  Just how we like it.
Ama Ebi - The meat wasn&#39;t as sweet as I hoped, and the deep fried head wasn&#39;t as seasoned as I would like... but it was tasty nonetheless, and a very reasonable price at $8 for two pieces.

We didn&#39;t try any special rolls, so I can&#39;t comment to those.  Looked interesting, so we may be back to try again.  Did the standard spicy tuna roll and shrimp tempura roll, both were good, but pretty standard priced.

Note:  It was very slow, but the sushi chefs placed our order on a beautiful boat to be eaten from!  Don&#39;t know if this is common for them, but excellent presentation!

Figured we wanted a big more food to balance out the menu, so we noticed that a few customers had received a separate Chinese food menu.  I requested that menu and ordered up some string beans with pork and fried anchovies.  (That&#39;s one dish).  String beans were perfectly crisp and cooked, and the dish was an excellent way to round out the meal.

Verdict:  Very friendly service, sushi/sashimi is super affordable, the rolls are standard priced, and a regular priced Chinese menu to round out the meal.  A good standard place to get a bite of sushi.  We&#39;re fans, and we&#39;ll be back."
raku-sushi-gourmet-naperville,Elizabeth T.,7CRexuGM8-Ln4a44Ye3nag,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,43,42,-ngyg7ENFIpjF6PDoGKFNg,5.0,2014-06-25,"Recent reviews about service being so slow and sushi quality being poor surprised me.  My family and I have been going to this restaurant since 2011 and have had no experience about slow service or poor-quality sushi.  We&#39;ve become restaurant regulars and friends with the owners and they already know what we want to order as soon as we walk in.

So, here&#39;s my side of the story:

+ Friendly &amp; efficient service
+ Chinese &amp; Japanese cuisine available
+ Fresh &amp; delicious sushi.  Our family favorites are: shrimp crunch roll, lion dance roll, volcano roll, and fire dragon roll.
+ Lunch Specials and Bento Boxes are available (Prices range from $9.95 to $12.95. Big bang for your buck!) 
+ Their fruit shakes, made up of REAL FRUIT, are delicious!  You may add tapioca for extra charge.  Our family favorites are the avocado and mango shakes.
+ They recently introduced DIM SUM SPECIALS (small/bite size plates; the Chinese version of tapas plates for those not familiar).  Prices range from $3.95 to $6.95.  We are looking forward to trying that. 
+ They also cater.
+ Very clean bathrooms.
+ Very clean dining area
+ Nice ambiance.  Some Yelpers are correct.  This is a more quiet restaurant (which I prefer) so loud talkers may want to use their indoor voice while dining here.  Who wants to listen to other people&#39;s conversations when having lunch/dinner anyway?  Chinese or Japanese instrumental songs play in the background.  No annoying K-pop, J-pop, or American Top 40 Hits here.  It is nice to have a calm, relaxed, and quiet environment while eating.  The world is too full of noise and distractions already.  It&#39;s nice to escape it and have a nice conversation with friends/family at Raku Sushi once in a while.  In addition, I am not bothered by the Christmas lights inside at all.  I think it adds to the ambiance.
+ Ample parking

Nothing negative to say.

So, come try Raku Sushi!  For the negative reviewers: I hope you give it one more try.  Your negative experience may have been a fluke.  If it sucks the second time around, then, fine: everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion.  I will always be a big fan of Raku Sushi."

I was here on Christmas Day, there restaurant had only four tables occupied which has been already served. First of all, it took them over 10 mins to come get our appetizer order. We had to wave several times to get someone&#39;s attention. They finally got the order. The appetizer wasn&#39;t even there 20 mins after that and when we called the waitress she didn&#39;t even listen to us and simply said with an attitude, I know your food isn&#39;t here. And quickly went away saying it&#39;ll be here soon. It still took them another 7mins to bring it out.. Oh well! We ordered steamed gyoza and they brought out fried. When we mentioned that the lady said, well the guy the took the order left. (Umm.. Is that my fuckin problem?) I said, well sorry but we can&#39;t have it. She instead of just saying sorry, which she didn&#39;t, said again with an attitude do you want to order another one. At that point we were beyond hungry so I said, no we will just have our entre order. And shamelessly she says,&#34;oh, that isn&#39;t in yet. It&#39;ll take another 15mins for that&#34;. Duck that shit! At that point, I had it. We said, politely, we get to leave as it&#39;s been way over half an hour for our food to arrive and we get to be somewhere. To which, there is no apology at all from her at any time, and she argued how it had only 15mins since we had come. Wow! I couldn&#39;t believe it! She didn&#39;t apologize for their improper service at all and argued with us for leaving when half of our food wasn&#39;t right and the other half order wasn&#39;t even placed! I had it. I simply had to leave and say,&#34; well, you have other customers here why don&#39;t you take care of them at least they will have their service on time.&#34; It&#39;s hard for me to accept a service this lousy. I have worked in the food industry too but this is something I have never experienced. People in Naperville are doomed. Thankfully I&#39;m from Los Angeles and would not have to go here again."

We were skeptical but they said it was all made fresh and really good. We went there today for lunch. It was a bit odd -- a dual personality restaurant with both the sushi menu and the dim sum menu with even a choice of chinese tea or japanese tea. But it was really really great dim sum. It was so fresh. We have eaten dim sum in every one of the good dim sum restaurants in Chicago&#39;s chinatown and we used to live in San Jose, CA and ate dim sum at some huge famous dim sum resturants there. Trust me, this is BETTER than any of those. If you like dim sum please try it out. You will be so happy you did. 

The service was great too. However, remember that your dim sum order is being freshly made, it isn&#39;t all frozen things being steamed like I suspect a lot of the dim sum in chinatown is done. So be prepared to wait a few minutes after your order. It is worth the wait."

We tend to go to Chinatown and will continue to do so.  The fried Taro tasted more like a bean burrito...blah! The beef crepes.. meh. Needless to say, she was not impressed. We switched gears and tried the sushi. Nothing seemed really fresh. Whole Foods sushi sitting in the case tastes better and seems more fresh. Besides the the food being below average, the service was slow and the place was dirty. To toe things off, when I payed they charged my card for another table and it took quite some time to get it corrected. I don&#39;t see what all the hype is for this place and why it&#39;s rated on par with establishments that are far superior. Could it be that it was somewhat cheap which some people correspond with good? We will stick with Chinatown for dim sum and Chef Soon for sushi while in the western burbs."

The first time it was closed for new ownership taking over the spot I was disappointed that I did not try it prior to that night. Well we returned on Saturday August 20 about 5 pm. We entered through the rear since that is where the parking is located. The hostess asked us twice what we needed due to a loud obnoxious group of guys. We had to work our way through a number of rude individuals to get to a nice table in the front of the restaurant by the windows.

As we were seated the hostess apologized a number of times for the noise and said they should be leaving soon. The server arrived a couple of minutes later and my daughter and I ordered our soft drinks and I could not tell you what she ordered nor could she tell you what I ordered because of the noise. The server returned with a regular soda when I asked for an Ice tea, she apologized as well for her mistake due to the loud crowd. When my daughter was unable to her me respond to her question I decided enough is enough. I paid for the drink I did not order and left, you would of thought the server would have said no worries its on the house due to the noise and it was not what I ordered. We ended up at Wok N Fire much better and peaceful place. 

My first visit was a sign not to return to this site when it was closed, I will never return and I encourage you to call first and see if 25 obnoxious guys are there first.

Since we were staying just across the street, McNally&#39;s looked like the ideal spot to knock back a few beers and enjoy a low-key dinner. We took a seat near the window, which allowed us to people-watch while enjoying the atmosphere and each other. The beer, of course, was absolutely perfect. The very friendly owner came be a couple of times during the course of our visit to ask about the beer and our food. It may sound strange, but the bread with fantastic Irish butter was our favorite thing about the meal. We both also loved the soup of the day, a potato-leek creation with caramelized leeks on top. For entrées, the hubby got fish and chips, and I had the Reuben sandwich. I was kind of full already from the soup and the bread, but I did my best on the sandwich, leaving most of my fries uneaten--a fact that did not escape the notice of the concerned owner. I assured him that the fries were yummy, but that my eyes were bigger than my stomach. The sandwich itself was quite good, although the coleslaw in place of the sauerkraut was a bit unexpected (and honestly, I prefer the kraut).  I didn&#39;t try the fish and chips, but the hubby seemed to like the dish. But really, the take-away for me was the wonderful, friendly atmosphere and the perfect beer. I&#39;d love to come back and fill up on more suds and a few appetizers."

We wanted to sit downstairs or outside but because we had a reservation we were seated upstairs because they had a table saved for us. We are in our mid- late 20s and everyone upstairs was old or it was families so that was interesting. Drinks were good. Server was attentive. Food was good. Really no complaints but really nothing to completely rave about. I will say there was a jazz band downstairs which was great but if you are sitting downstairs you won&#39;t be able to hear anyone because it&#39;s so freaking loud.

I am with my father and a few of his close friends way back from Highschool. Let me tell you this is a eccentric spot to hang out, especially if you are looking for quality night life. Food was impeccable (we love traditional Irish food) I had the full Monty, it&#39;s breakfast-y, with sausage, eggs, and Canadian bacon, and my father has a peculiar dish with Salmon and potato pancakes which was packed with flavor! Service was fast and pleasant. Shortly after dinner, a two man band started to play which was entertaining and thrilling. Their sound was loud and filled the place with laughter and guitar chords which is everything you want on a Friday night out. I asked to play &#34;Here Comes the Sun&#34;, and to my amusement they obliged.

The coleslaw was satisfactory.  I had the fried egg sandwich. The bread was good and nicely toasted but it didn&#39;t have much bacon and cheese on it. I prefer the woody sandwich across the street at The Filling Station. It doesn&#39;t have egg on it but it features more bacon, more cheese, and it is available with whole wheat bread.

The order came late and was wrong and missing an item.  30 minutes later the missing item added. The wrong dish wasn&#39;t replaced but a promise of &#34;we&#39;ll try again&#34; wasn&#39;t worth the wait.

I came on my lunch break today, and ordered a Full Southwest pocket with chicken. It comes with lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, green peppers, a black beans and corn mix, red onions, and cheddar cheese. I added some jalapenos, southwest mix, and cilantro to mine as well. You get chipotle ranch dressing on the side. 

As I waited rather impatiently, I glanced around at the lunch rush crowd and was worried whether I&#39;d make it back to Naperville in time. There were quite a few orders ahead of me. The employees craft every order with precision and care, but the downside is that it leaves a large wait time. I finally received my order about ten minutes later (&#34;Hidi?&#34;) and was on my way. I was going to dock a star for the &#34;slow service&#34; until I realized A) This is not McNasty Food that&#39;s been sitting under a heat lamp, and B) &#34;Good things come to those who wait&#34; is certainly applicable at this establishment.

The &#34;Full&#34; portion is huge, to say the least. There was more food than I expected, but I&#39;m not one to shun leftovers. To say the pocket was filled was an understatement; it was filled and so was half of the box it came in. Squeeeeee! I&#39;m sorry, but it&#39;s hard not to get excited about huge portions in this sad little world of overcharging the customer for child size meal portions. Oh, speaking of which- my large pocket cost a little under $9. For the amount of food, and the quality of the ingredients used, I&#39;d say the price is more than fair. 

The first bite was absolute heaven. Fresh, fresh, fresh. The lettuce was crisp and cold. The chicken was tender, juicy, and cut into bite sized cubes. Every other ingredient met or exceeded my expectations. When I brought it back to the cube farm, many coworkers came up and inquired what on earth smelled so good and &#34;holy crap, where did you get that thing?&#34; Nice. 

The restaurant itself is clean, with plenty of seating. The only gripe would be that there&#39;s only one door, so if people are waiting in line and it&#39;s quite long, it extends out the door and the people leaving have to squeeze past them. Not a big deal to some, but just an observation. The employees were all friendly and helpful. Despite the line growing longer, orders taking longer to prepare, and the phone ringing off the hook, the smiles remained on their faces and their attitudes positive. It was impressive. 

Their menu is diverse; specialty pizzas, calzones, potatoes, salads, kids meals, and soups and chili. You can pick from pre-selected options as I did, or you may create your pocket, salad, or pizza. With the pre-selected options, feel free to substitute the meat to one of your choice. If you decide to go the vegetarian route, a buck and some change is deducted from the cost of the pocket. How cool is that?

Pockets boasts using fresh ingredients that contain natural colors and flavors. Hallelujah! Is anyone else tired of eating food made with stuff they can&#39;t pronounce and  chicken that doesn&#39;t look like chicken? I am. Thank you Pockets for doing something different, and doing it well. I am definitely a fan and will be back very soon!"

I always make my own pocket,  but I see some items I would like to try like the original calzone and they have an awesome looking baked potato. All ingredients are super fresh and service is quick which is the mantra of the business.  The pocket is freshly baked so you get a warm pocket in minutes stuffed with whatever you&#39;d like. Oh yea, and they don&#39;t skip on the ingredients - they pack it in. They gave me a ton of sliced avocado which most businesses like to skimp on!

They make their bread fresh, so it&#39;s warm when you eat it, and I like that they give you your sauce on the side so you can control how much (or little) you want. We saw some people getting salads while we were there, which is essentially just the Pockets sandwich in a bowl instead, and those looked great too.

My criticisms on this place basically come down to price and presentation. The good was good, but $20 for lunch for two with no drinks seems expensive. At that price point, Pockets falls in that weird uncomfortable middle ground between saving money just grabbing Subway or similar fast food-level sandwiches and actually just going out to a restaurant for a couple bucks more.

I guess you could make an argument towards &#34;premium&#34; ingredients or whatever, but watching them put your pita together is a bit of a turn off. Instead of something like Chipotle where they&#39;re heaping your stuff into a tortilla then rolling it up, if you order a sandwich here all the fixin&#39;s go on one of those supremely cheap white paper plates. From there, they jumble it all up with their hands on the plate and ram it into a pita.

I understand the point of doing this is to toss the ingredients around more or less, but it just seems uncomfortably janky for them to be using paper plates and their hands to do it instead of making a dramatic presentation with stainless steel bowls and flipping the stuff around kind of like how they handle salads at Portillo&#39;s. I could see it if this was just some one-off hole in the wall sandwich place in a college town, but this is a franchise, right? Is this Pockets standard operating procedure? If so... It seems really weird.

The source of our second sandwich was a bowl they pulled out of the fridge (presumably someone ordered the same thing as a salad and didn&#39;t show up or wanted something different or something). From there, they flopped the whole contents of the salad on a paper plate and did the same thing. It felt really weird, like &#34;Hey you just ordered a sandwich here&#39;s someone else&#39;s leftovers.&#34; From a practical standpoint I realize it&#39;s all the same food, but, it&#39;d be like going to Subway, ordering your sandwich, and them being like &#34;Oh someone just ordered that let me put it on the bread you want.&#34;

But, hey, whatever, the food was good which is what matters at the end of the day. I&#39;m not usually very squeamish about the things I eat but there&#39;s just something unappetizing about a dude squishing all your food in between his fingers on a paper plate particularly when you just paid $10 for the privilege.  If you&#39;re going to make your food like that, make it in the back so I don&#39;t have to stand there and watch you."

Though it&#39;s a (small) chain, it was nice to get a personal thank you while I was there!

I&#39;ve only tried a few things at Pockets, namely because I love the flavors too much to differ. My favorite salad is the Asian (the dressing is out of this world) and I love to make my own calzone - the ranch dressing is equally as good! I have to believe they make their own dressings, because they&#39;re delicious!

I&#39;m not much of a cheese eater these days since I&#39;m very intolerant so I always opt for the pockets.  I&#39;ll be damned if the calzones don&#39;t look good though.

Be a pocket believer, especially for you veggiesaurs!"

Fuel up on delicious Pockets before a day of shopping at the Premium Outlets (which is a couple driving blocks away).  The site is new and fresh and the service is friendly.

Environment:
This store went through months of remodeling construction before finally opening this summer.  The interior is new, clean, and seats a couple dozen customers.  Bathrooms are also new and clean.

Service:
The service has been prompt and pleasant.  The dishes are prepared on the spot and are pretty quick (10 minutes depending on your order, calzones take longer).  If you are on-the-go, it&#39;s best to pre-order online or by calling in ahead of time.

Food:
My all time favorite salad is the Berry Bleu with House Dressing.  Berry Bleu is salad topped with tons of edamame, cucumber, bleu cheese, and almonds.  (The edamame makes it especially filling and the cucumbers creates a fresh and light crunch.  If you are not a bleu cheese fan, substitute with a milder feta.)  The House dressing is French-based, mild tasting with a slight tang.

Parking:
Parking is right outside the small strip of stores and easily available

Unique:
One unique features I noticed at this location is a soft serve ice cream station with an array of toppings.  Sweet!"

We were so loyal that we would venture from the suburbs to the city just to get their calzones and veggie lo-cal pockets. It was AWESOME!

Unfortunately, they changed their dough recipe a few years ago. Despite this, we thought we would try again. Oops! What a mistake. We ordered the same items and were disappointed with both. The calzone was significantly smaller than before. The dough on both reminded us of sawdust. 

That&#39;s it.Another Chicago institution (like Red Tomato) is gone."

I had the Southwest pocket and my husband had the Italian, we both liked our own and each other&#39;s. Next time I&#39;ll ask for extra dressing.

(He works down the street &amp; has eaten here a few times) So we make the trek out there, arrive at 3:57, they were serving $1 pockets until 4. As we walk in, we notice the sign advertising the special deal is still out so we figure we are okay. Walk in, 2 people in line ahead of us. Guy in front of us says &#34;are you still offering the  dollar pockets?&#34; &#34;yes.&#34; He orders, walks away, the cashier says &#34;it&#39;s after 4, we are no longer offering the dollar pockets.&#34; &#34;seriously? we were in line at 4&#34; &#34;yes, we told him when he walked in he was the last one.&#34;(which was a lie, because I heard him ask) Mind you, there is no one behind us in line. I understand having a cut off time for a deal-especially if you have a bunch of people in line, but we were in line at 4, &amp; they still had the sign up outside. So we decided to leave &amp; not get anything. I was really turned off by the customer service. It would have been nice for her to tell us as soon as we walked in that they weren&#39;t offering the dollar pockets anymore, that could have changed the whole interaction. Originally, we were going to eat there regardless of the deal. So we go to leave, the manager is outside taking down the signs as we are walking out. Get in the car, I say &#34;let&#39;s go talk to the manager because that&#39;s ridiculous how they handled that.&#34; Long story short(ish), we don&#39;t even get a chance to discuss the real issue at hand(customer service), he simply said, &#34;give them the deal&#34; &amp; walked away. We made sure to thank him for giving us the deal, because he certainly didn&#39;t have to. We got two pockets, Southwest &amp; Greek. Southwest has beans, roasted peppers, corn, cheddar, tomatoes, spinach &amp; lettuce with a chipotle ranch dressing. Greek has black olives(canned), tomatoes, spinach &amp; lettuce, &amp; feta with a greek dressing. Both were tasty &amp; nicely seasoned. I liked the Southwest better overall. Would I come here again? Maybe, maybe not, poor customer service is a big turn off for me. I know we got the deal, but that wasn&#39;t the point, the whole thing was handled wrong."

We were told it would be a 10 minute wait to be seated. Not bad for a Friday night, so we waited... and waited... and waited... and waited.... For an hour! Each time we asked about our ten minute wait for our table we were told it should be any minute now... Once we were seated it was 15 minutes before a waitress came to take our drink orders. Several people came by our table to leave things or take things away, but they didn&#39;t say a word to us! I had a question about one of the drinks and the waitress said she would go ask about it... I asked her if she would come back and she looked at me like I was crazy... After 7 minutes we left..."

Although our last experience wasn&#39;t very good, our intention was to enjoy the moment and have a good experience. Unfortunately, it turned out to be quite the opposite. Once we arrived, the two of us were immediately seated in the main dining area because all of the tables close to the sidewalk were occupied. We started off ordering a medium rare Prime Rib and medium Filet Mignon. When the food arrived the steaks were tough and improperly cooked, and the vegetables were dry. However, my baked potato was good... Although we did not get bread included with our salads or meal, we elected to order some. The bread was served about 15 minutes later and arrived burnt. The two of us just looked at each other as if it were some sort of joke. Both the food and the service have a lot to be desired.

Im really not sure what type of place Emmett&#39;s is wanting to be. Those that were sitting along the sidewalk were sipping wine and enjoying conversation. Although the curbside appeal imply an upscale venue, the tables in the main dining section were open and were fitted with Ketchup and mustard bottles. I read other reviews about the burgers so we elected to stay clear of them and the beer... If this place wasn&#39;t in such a fantastic location or have such an appealing look from the sidewalk, it wouldn&#39;t have lasted as long as it has! Wheaton is filled with good restaurants, Emmett&#39;s simply isn&#39;t one of them. I do believe that we might enjoy sipping wine at the tables near the sidewalk on a warm summer night."

The place was popping and we waited about an hour for a table. We had a lot to chat about so the hour went quick, but if I came back, I&#39;d try to come earlier to avoid the rush. 

Everyone we spoke with (hostesses, bartenders, servers) were all accommodating and nice, although conversations were understandably rushed. 

I decided to try the fish tacos because I can rarely pass them up, no matter the location. They were a solid option and I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to order them twice. I also got the truffle fries and cheddar ale soup. The fries were pretty good but the soup was incredible. I honestly wish I ordered a bigger portion or at least ordered an extra. It also comes with a pretzel twist so don&#39;t skip it-- even if you&#39;re avoiding carbs. (It&#39;s worth the cheat. Trust me) We sampled a few of the beers and I really liked all of the ones I tried. 

I think this is a great location for dinner because the menu is vast and they even accommodate gluten free."

We stopped in on a Thursday evening around 6pm. It wasn&#39;t very busy, there were a couple people sitting at the bar and high tops in the bar section open, so we just grabbed one of those. It didn&#39;t look like the main dining room was very full, however I didn&#39;t get a good look at it.

It took some time for our waiter to greet us, which was strange, because it seemed like they were way over staffed for the night. He also seemed new, so we didn&#39;t let it bother us at all. My fiancé ordered a drink, which took about 15min for her to get. Apparently the drink takes a minute to make and the bartender wasn&#39;t looking forward to making this particular drink, even though it&#39;s a &#34;specialty&#34; on their menu, so she focused on socializing. 

Once she got her drink, we put in our food orders. I went with the chicken sandwich and she got the lettuce wraps. The food definitely took longer than that type of order took, but again, we tried to not let it bother us. Once it came, it wasn&#39;t hot and came with a sauce that I specifically said I didn&#39;t want. If it would have came hot, I think it definitely would have made my sandwich better, but a cold chicken sandwich isn&#39;t exactly desirable. She said her lettuce wraps weren&#39;t great, but they weren&#39;t awful either. The only thing that I&#39;d say was really good were the truffle fries. They were thicker than the usual truffle fries, however they were really good.

Overall, I&#39;d say it was a C- experience. Considering the restaurant wasn&#39;t even close to full, the service was really slow and they really didn&#39;t seem interested in providing us a great experience. The food was average, at best, and the truffle fries were good.

Not sure if we&#39;ll be back, but there are certainly better choices in the area."

I was not impressed with this new restaurant at all. We walked in and there was no host at the front door so we decided to sit at the bar. There were only a few people sitting at the bar and the rest of the counter was dirty. We sat there for quite some time before the bartender offered beer a sample. I found one beer that I liked an ordered one. I was surprised by the dirty glasses that sat behind the bar almost the entire time I was there. 

I was caught off guard by how dirty the restaurant seemed. My feet stuck to the floor and the overall appearance was not impressive. I glanced at the food menu but nothing jumped out at me. I did not order food so I can not review that. 

The bartender mentioned the brewery that would be opening in the basement. She said we could go down and take a look. I looked around and tried to get an idea of what would be offered. A manager walked down and tried to explain things but he was not sure about certain processes. 

Overall- The beer was ok, service could be improved, and the cleanliness could use a lot of work. I might stop in again for a beer but I don&#39;t think I would ever eat here."

The best thing about &#34;Emmett&#39;s&#34; (since they took over) is about the same. This is a real disappointment since we&#39;ve been to some of their other locations and had a better (not great) experience.

The hostess was completely uninterested in us, wanting to seat us right in the path of the kitchen door (despite the fact that there were better seats available) We finally told her that we would just sit in the bar. 

They were short on wait staff.. the waits were excruciating.

They were out of diet sodas.

I started with the steak and black bean chili, it wasn&#39;t chilly.. but it wasn&#39;t hot either. It was tasty but I wouldn&#39;t seek it out.

I ordered the Chicken Saltimbocca, it was OK with a potential towards very good. Ok, because it wasn&#39;t very hot (Potatoes were actually cool) and the artichokes were kind of dry. I&#39;ve had a more successful version of this at another one of their locations.

Lisa started with the beer cheese (Cheddar Ale) soup, it was good and came with a good pretzel roll, the portion seemed a bit light for a &#34;bowl&#34; My &#34;cup&#34; of chili seemed to offer as much.

Then she had a small plate fish taco with fries, it was good but pricey for what you got. The fries were lukewarm (I&#39;m being generous)

Overall a disappointing experience and we will be very reluctant to try it again."

Not much of that has changed - except for the obvious home brew beer element that is defining Emmet&#39;s.

Service continues to be very good and the atmosphere is far from pretentious. It&#39;s good for families and for couples. 

Our most recent trip to Emmet&#39;s involved a simple lunch of burgers and wine. The burgers were so overcooked, it was sad. Kobe burger ordered medium and delivered medium well/well done. So dry and disappointing. 

The red ale, which the bartender allowed us to sample (we sat at the bar) was not very good. The bartender agreed that most people didn&#39;t care for it. We then tried the ESP, more of a brown ale, and it was pretty good, but not enough to make me bite. I chose wine instead.

Emmet&#39;s is a pretty good restaurant. The service is consistently very good. So, they have that going for them. I think the kitchen needs some work."

From what I&#39;ve gathered, this Wheaton location is newer. Others have complained about the service, but I have to say we loved our waitress! She chit-chatted with us, shared the specials, and helped us make menu choices. On top of her game for sure.

They have an outdoor patio which I highly suggest taking advantage of! It was lovely enjoying the beautiful weather while sipping on a glass of wine. I had their California Pinot Grigio which was $7.

Now the salad... Perfect and refreshing for a warm day! This green goddess includes a large bed of mixed greens, grilled chicken (or salmon for an up charge), walnuts, blue cheese crumbles, craisons, and pear slices topped with a raspberry vinegarette. Pretty sure this combo will be my go to salad choice of the season. I highly suggest!

I&#39;ll have to come back to check out the beers since well, ya know, they are a brewing company!

Mini plate + paddle was a fun and affordable combo. Sweet potato fries were perfect. 

I&#39;ll second the slow service comments I&#39;m seeing. It was indeed slow. We were there for a leisurely pint and conversation, so not a bother for our party, but could have been if we were in a less lackadaisical mood. Also: I genuinely thought the place might have closed at 8pm. We were practically the only ones there at that hour, and staff appeared to be cleaning up.

The hostesses were pleasant and phoned us when our table was ready. Once seated, our server was engaging and seemed well informed about the food and beverages. 

Unfortunately, the kitchen has some issues. We ordered pretzels for an appetizer. 20 minutes later we were served ice cold on the inside and somewhat warm on the outside pretzels sticks. Our server took care of the problem promptly by taking the plate and offering us our next course. Great... Cuz we are pretty hungry now. Our soups and salads took an additional 20 minutes to arrive. (I assume our server was in the weeds here) Another 30 minutes or so later our entrees arrived. The prime rib was decent but it was served with an uncooked &#34;baked&#34; potato. The fried cod was really tasty but again, the fries were par-cooked. 

Overall, our server tried to accommodate us but he seemed to be playing catch up most of the time from what I saw at other tables. The cooked food was decent. The beer was decent.

The soft pretzel bun was a great fit for this sandwich. My hubby had the fire starter burger and said it had a very balanced flavor and wasn&#39;t too spicy. The sweet potato fries and the chips were very good. 

Hoptweet was exactly as billed. A pale ale, with vibrant fruit notes. Patriot&#39;s Pride had a very noticeable roasted malt character, in the style of a scotch ale. The hubby is looking forward to trying more. 

We definitely feel like we need to try more of this menu since everything was really good."

The atmosphere was great, we took a tour of the place and were shown around the old vault and safety deposit area. There is some great history here. We just had a few appetizers and drinks and all were great. 

In a place like this I like to ask the bartender how he feels about making an Old Fashioned and he was actually excited to show his skills. Not many people do it right but if you like them and Andrey is at the bar, let him make you one his way. You can trust me on this, it&#39;s the right way.

This place is a little far from home but next time I&#39;m in the area, I will definitely make another visit."

And they were larger parties. I felt bad because the lunch cost us $50 and the service lacked. We don&#39;t do this much so having a bad experience really ruined it. The food was fine and lukewarm.

The staff seemed pretty indifferent about their jobs and the service they were providing. 

The food was just as good as it is in Palatine though I&#39;m really disappointed they dont have the Pita and Hummus because it is the best I&#39;ve had. Their beers are just ok. If you like darker beers you&#39;d probably enjoy some of theirs.

The atmosphere is pretty nice, and I&#39;ve had very good service every time I&#39;ve been here. Last time I ended up here it was just for some cocktails with my friends after a mediocre dinner elsewhere. We had tried to stop in to the Irish place next door, but it was too crowded and we were being stared at by the patrons in a weird manner... and then no one would help us...so we left and came here. The bartender was awesome, super helpful. I don&#39;t drink beer, so I can&#39;t really speak to the beer selection at all. My friends seemed happy with what they ordered...so there&#39;s that. My drinks were good, though I order really basic drinks...so ... it really doesn&#39;t show anything great about anyone. But the service was really excellent, and the prices aren&#39;t terrible. That said... this last time we went...it really did smell awful in there.  I hope they get whatever is causing that terrible smell under control. 
The other times I&#39;ve been here was for lunch. The food was always good, and the prices are pretty decent. The service has been good each time I&#39;ve been here. I will be back again, I&#39;ve had good experiences here, so I will likely be back."

We were seated promptly. I read a lot of complaints about the service and had a really terrific service the whole time.

My wife ordered the French onion soup and I had chicken tortilla soup. Both of them came out hot and were very tasty. My wife is a bit of a French onion soup foodie and this passed the test!

My bride had the three sliders and enjoyed all of them. It was a good variety choice and probably a safe bet for a pub food sort of place like this.

I went out on a limb and ordered the whitefish and was impressed. The fillet they offered was generous, (no joke!) over 12 inches long, and perfectly cooked and deboned. The horseradish potatoes were nicely piped out around the plate rim and had horseradish flavor was there without being overbearing. The garlic spinach was well cooked and enjoyable.

Overall, for the genre and price point, a very solid choice. We will be back."

Place was NOISY.  Difficulty hearing others speak.
How could a place be out of Pepsi and Baked Potatoes on a Saturday night?
Plus Saturday is Prime Rib special.  Baked potatoes needed for that!

Disappointed with Turkey burger.  It seemed to me that it had been a frozen patty.  
Perhaps I would have fared better with a regular burger.

If you asked me to go with you I would,

However, the bartender we had really ruined the experience. The place was certainly not slammed, but he made it quite clear he was too busy for us, only barely greeting us after sitting at the bars for 15 minutes. It was hard to get more than a one word answer out him, not to mention every interaction we had with him consisted of him flying by, trailing off as he talked to us, making it even harder to ask him about anything on the menu, or feel that he was actually aware that we were there, ya know, as customers and all."

I didn&#39;t even look at the food menu but I would assume it is similar to the other Emmetts locations.  What this Emmetts location has that others do not is its location.  Taking over the old Bank Restaurant gives it prime real estate in downtown Wheaton.  Small patio facing the street and decent drink specials make it a good place for a drink after work.  I don&#39;t think there is really anything to stand it apart from any other of the restaurant/brewery combos in the area.

We thought the first time might have been a fluke so we tried it again tonight.  Never again!  The service was terrible and actually worse than last time.  
We were lucky enough to get a table outside on a beautiful summer night but that was the only good thing about our experience.  We were greeted soon after we sat down and ordered a beer and two waters. The beer came and then we didn&#39;t see a server for a long time. Finally, he came by and we ordered the artichoke dip and reminded him about our waters. The dip was awful.  It tasted like mayo and it was served with very greasy pita triangles. We were so hungry, we had to eat some of it.  By the way we had no plates or napkins. Finally we ordered our food and it was mediocre.  Once we got our food, it must have been a half hour before anyone checked on us.  We had no drinks.  What can I say......done with that place for good."

first of all, the space is absolutely beautiful. what a lovely place for a cozy meal. we were seated immediately, and the service from start to finish, was perfect. i decided to try something i hadn&#39;t had at the other locations- walleye bites and the mini caprese salad. i had a nice chardonnay for eight dollars. i have to say that everything was excellent, and i&#39;ll be back as soon as i can drag someone out for lunch or dinner. a very nice addition to the local dining scene."

After 15 minutes we were seated on the patio. The waitress told us the kitchen was backed up (yeah we got it). We enjoyed the patio and had another drink and ordered our dinner. Obviously we were not in a hurry and enjoyed the outdoor seating. My husband ordered the kobe burger and I ordered the steak wedge salad. Thirty minutes later we were served. My husband said his burger was fair and my steak wedge salad was warm from sitting under the warming lights. I guess to keep the three dried up steak pieces warm. 

The table of four behind us complained about their meal and they were re-served two of their meals. The man said to the manager it was their third time there and would not be returning. I could not complain because I felt bad for the waitstaff and manager. 

I waited a week before writing this review hoping to reconsider my opinion. I wanted to like Emmett&#39;s because I loved The Bank (the former restaurant). We will not be back for a while. Hopefully they get their act together."

I can get over so-so food and crappy drinks (booze is booze, right?) but the couple of times I&#39;ve dined in the bar area, it takes way too long to get a second drink, if it all. This last time we just gave up and got the check because the waitress/bartender didn&#39;t seem interested in bartending/waitressing.

My friend asked to try a beer that had more malty flavors vs hoppy.  The bartender brought out 3 samples of their &#34;lightest&#34; beers. None of which were malty. Perhaps it was a misunderstanding...of beer. At a pub.

Service:
The wait-staff obviously had some European training. They would tilt their heads away like the Russian soldiers marching in the Mayday parade at The Kremlin if you attempted to get their attention. After about fifteen minutes of being actively ignored we were asked for our order. We had not even been given menus. There were no written descriptions of the twelve or so beers available.

My tacos were served in limp, soggy and cold shells. The lettuce and tomato filling was at room temperature and mushy. The seared Ahi tuna was barely warm and appeared to have an odd color.

Today, I went with my kids for lunch.  My kids ordered kids cheese pizza.  (My boys love cheese pizza). I ordered the Brewer&#39;s chicken sandwich.  
My mom stopped in to say hi to us since she was in the area.  The waiter came to the table to rudely tell my 70 year old mother that she cannot have outside drinks in the restaurant.  (She just came from a doctors appointment with what was left of her McDonalds coffee). He was a total jerk and basically set the mood for never wanting to step foot into this place again.
It&#39;s a good thing they have a nice manager ... She was the only thing that was decent about the place.  Although, my son said that the pizza was &#34;gross&#34; and refused to eat it.  She knew that.... She offered to get him something else to eat and he said no thank you.  But still didn&#39;t eat the gross pizza.  It was $6 for dough. 
My chicken sandwich was quite boring and was missing flavor.  I think they should offer some kind of chipotle mayo or something with a kick.... It was blah.  
We eat out in downtown Wheaton often... This might be one of my worst dining experiences to date.  
FYI- I have never left a tip less than 15% (usually 20%+) before today.  My mother thought 1 cent was appropriate for the service.  
I left slightly more and that was only for the second waitress that took over at the end.

The service was BEYOND terrible. It somewhat seemed like they were understaffed in one part of the restaurant but not the entire place. Our waiter almost never came over to our table. We waited quite some time to even be served drinks or have anyone notice our table at all. I tried the Munich Light beer which was actually pretty good. I ordered a couple things off the small plates menu which included the mini brie burger. The brie was so mini it almost didn&#39;t exist and I ended up asking for more. One of my friends didn&#39;t even get to eat because they messed up her meal. She ordered a medium filet and it came out well done. She sent it back and never received anything in return because it was taking so long. I know that it doesn&#39;t take very long to cook a medium steak and it was taking so long that she canceled it. Everyone else seemed to have decent food but nothing that was mind blowing. We were all finished with our food, barely had any drinks left and no one bothered to see if we wanted more. We probably waited 30 minutes AFTER telling the waiter AND manager to cancel the steak to even get our bill. I felt like most of our time was spent waiting than eating and drinking. I may give this place a second chance but it&#39;s hard to get me back to a place that has such terrible service and doesn&#39;t even apologize for making a mistake.

emmetts-brewing-company-wheaton,Gee J.,lv31nc3fvWM8FlqqQ5DHyw,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1,7,14,TsyshNM5k4Y7W1ZBl-gZpQ,4.0,2015-09-13,"Emmett&#39;s nails these three concepts: on-site rotating craft brewery, small gastro-pub bites, and bar-craftenders; plus the ambiance of yesteryear in this former Wheaton Bank space.  

1) BREW
Emmett&#39;s has 7-12 locally brewed taps with a spectrum from lighter lagers or pilsners, to mid-range to bitter IPAs, a FANTASTIC local red ale, and all the way to chocolate roast stout or sweet stout.  The winners so far have been the red ale which boast the bit and range of a true american red-head; mid-range citra IPA for its floral hoppiness; and the roasted stout with distince bittersweet coffee notes.  Are all the beers 5 stars? No.  But try a flight, make up your own, enjoy the sweat and tears of the local brewmaster.

2) GASTRO-PUB
Emmett&#39;s has a range of pub-far to full ribeye entree.  The pub fare is available as a full meal, or if you want to go tapas style you can get a limited range for $4 such a a brie burger or tavern taco which INCLUDES one side.  It&#39;s an amazing beer and snack, or date night sharing place because of this flexibility.  

The small bites menu includes awesome tavern tacos including vegetarian roasted vegetables which taste great with a swizzle of southwestern sauce on top of a corn taco.  You can upgrade to a premium side for $1.50 more.  So for $6.50 you are eating in style if you want to go full boat on flavor and experience without busting a gut.

Another small bite is caprese salad with just right mix of oil, vinegar, and basil topping drizzled across the fresh cheese and red tomatoes.

The entrees include rib-eye, and there is a special one night a week on the steaks.

For soups: Chili is beyond solid.
The winner though is French Onion.  I&#39;ve had a lot of bad french onion.  You know what I&#39;m talking about.  Salt bomb, cheap bread, hard cheese, small or no onions.  Not here.  It&#39;s full flavor, soft cheese, french bread, with full slivers of onions.

The only item that is missing is the awesome veggie ratatouille available from it&#39;s former tenant THE BANK.


3) Craft-tenders.
Do you want a bartender that can shake up a tropical cocktail?  Show off spinning bottles?
Don&#39;t go here.

Do you want a bartender that knows what is in the beer, how it was brewed, matches the brew to the meal, cares about your beer experience?  Go here.  Well at least go to Andre.  He cares.

Today, on this Sunday afternoon I came into to watch a Bears/Packers game, have a good red ale beer, enjoy some food as I work on my laptop.  WiFi is available.  Power outlets here and there.  TVs on with the game.  As I make my way through the red ale, and make my way into the small bites, I choose the roasted veggie tavern taco.  Andre pairs the taco with the CitraIPA, and suggest the French Onion to complete the a flavor profile.  When it arrives, as I dig into the cheese crust, the broth is hot, flavor is savory, and bread has substance.  The four flavors work together: roast veggies on corn, savory french onion, and the floral IPA.

And to top it off: TOUCH DOWN BEARS!
Give it a try.  Hopefully they will have a good drive / run themselves."

We ordered portabella fries, they were drenched in grease. We got our check and left. The ONLY good things about this place is that Graham&#39;s ice cram shop next door!"

The Brewmasters developed the beer list - in this case, it was an all-IPA evening. The chefs tailored the menu to complement the beer.  As an IPA fan, this was a treat! While I liked some beers more than others, there wasn&#39;t a single disappointment on the list. 

The food... Oh, the food! My husband and I are still talking about it several days after the event. Everything was made in-house and it was clear that a lot of thought and care was put into everything. I can&#39;t decide whether my favorite part was the appetizer - a red snapper ceviche with pickled green tomatoes (which I would never have chosen, but might just have stolen the show) - or the dessert, a rich summer berry strudel with brown sugar frozen custard. In any case, I enjoyed every single part of the experience and can&#39;t wait to go back!"

Our server was sweet, but I don&#39;t think she knows much about beer. I asked for a smooth, not-too-hoppy or bitter beer, and she referred me to the IPA and the Hoptweet. I am no beer genius but I&#39;m pretty sure those do not fall into the category of what I&#39;d requested.
 
The beer menu needs tweaking: the seasonals are listed out of order, making it a challenge to understand how they fall on the spectrum. Also, our server served our tastes out of order. You can&#39;t serve an IPA, then a Dubbel...

We, like others mentioned, waited more than a half hour for...a pretzel. A $4 Small Plate &#34;Pretzel&#34; should be larger than a fat permanent marker. Their proportions are off: one tiny little pretzel came with two ramekins full of sauces. I get the &#34;one pretzel&#34; cuteness, but come on...it&#39;s $4. That&#39;s a gip and a tease - especially considering how long we waited for it. 

We waited an additional 15 minutes for our other food to be served. Walleye bites were fine (deep fried fish is hard to screw up) and the sriacha aioli was a nice compliment. Chicken slider was much better sized for a $4 small plate, but nothing unique. Prepared okay, but nothing special. 

After all our food was served we were told, without prompt, the ordering system was spitting out items one at a time and hence the delay. I could not have cared less at that point, considering how long we&#39;d already waited. They should have remedied the situation earlier and not given guests an excuse so late in the game. 

Sorry, Emmett&#39;s, but you&#39;ve got some work to do."

We waited so long for a waiter that we finally had to ask the hostess to find him for us.  Drinks came out in a somewhat timely manner as did our soup and salad.  The clam chowder, which was the daily special, was watery, thin and flavorless.  We then waited about 25 more minutes for our entrees, a Cuban sandwich for me and three sliders for my husband. The Cuban had very little meat and was dry.  The sliders were as hard as hockey pucks.

I did not try any beers but for dinner I would say it&#39;s about average."

I won&#39;t be going back anytime soon.  Muldoons has nothing to worry about.

______________________________

Updated: I went back late June 2015 and gave the place another try.  The server was fantastic.  Unfortunately, I forgot her name otherwise I would post it.  The food was good and promptly served. This was a much better experience than my first one a couple weeks earlier.  Perhaps they are still working out the kinks.  I also want to note that the management reached out to me after my not so great first visit.  I appreciate that they are trying to make the place better.  It&#39;s a cool spot, nice bar and will soon be brewing beer on site.  What&#39;s not to like if they get it right? 

I am upping the review to three stars from my previous one star.  I am going to try the place once again and will report back. I wish them luck in getting the place right.  More restaurants are opening in downtown Wheaton and Emmett&#39;s is going to need to be at their consistent best."

Liked the food.  They had excellent kids goodie bags and offered fruit instead of fries as the side with the kids meals, which is great.  My husband loved the beer.  We all really liked the beer cheese soup and since it was served with a pretzel stick, it also acted as an appetizer for the kids.  If we decide to move to Wheaton, we&#39;ll definitely be back."

Beers are $5.75. A little on the spendy side for your average brew pub. Wheaton is not that special. Why are all the downtown bars above average cost.

Our bartender, Sheena, was awesome!  She was very knowledgeable about the beers and offered suggestions based on our likes.  She really made us feel welcome and also shared some fun facts about Emmett&#39;s and about the brewing process.  She is truly an asset to Emmett&#39;s Brewing Co.  We look forward to seeing her on our next visit.  

The beers that we sampled were all good.  If you are looking for something light and crisp, the Munich Light is a great choice.  I also had a pint of the 1am Ale, which was a nice twist on an English Ale.  My fiancé leans toward the more hoppy beers and enjoyed both the Hoptweet and Patriot&#39;s Pride.  Ask the bartender or server for the list of beer descriptions, so you have an idea of what to sample.  We look forward to trying some of their other brews.  

While we did not eat, we were told by another patron that the walleye bites are amazing.  We will definitely be back to try them."

We ordered everything, food and drinks (mind you two iced teas and a Pepsi). Another 8 minutes goes by. My husband gets his soup, still no tea, Pepsi or even water. We have to flag down another waiter. It still takes another 5 minutes to get our drinks. So over 20 minutes from the time we sat down just to get some water. Our appetizer comes out and less than five minutes later our food is there. My food almost got cold waiting yet again on the waiter so I could ask for condiments. The waiter never stopped by again to ask how everything was. I had to ask again for more iced tea, which he gave me tea, no ice. By that time I just wanted to leave.

However, we were very very disappointed with how slow the service was. The place was pretty empty when we arrived, but filled up a bit more after we were there around 20 minutes. I had mentioned when making the reservations that we were just on lunch break from work, so I was especially annoyed that it took almost two hours out of our work day. This is the holiday season, and Emmett&#39;s is in downtown Wheaton, so you would think there would&#39;ve been enough staff to handle the lunch crowd. The wait staff was very nice and professional, but extremely lax in attending to our table between courses. It took way too long!

No sauce, the sandwich was kind of cold, (which is odd considering how long it took to come out) and the pretzel bun tasted stale. Absolutely no flavor to this sandwich. The fries were ok - nothing to write home about. Outdoor patio is small and crowded, and flower pots attract bees!

Mostly we have had sandwiches and burgers, all good, large portions, and the side fruit option is quite fresh. Most recently though I ordered the baby spinach salad NO onions. Well my salad showed up looking huge and delicious but topped with onion. I informed the server and he immediately took it away to fix. I figured they would pick the onions off and bring the same salad back, but anyone who doesn&#39;t like onions knows the whole salad will still taste of a giant onion. This was not the case. When my salad was brought back sans onion I could not taste a single bit of onion. Plus it was brought back by whom I&#39;m assuming was a manager. She apologized for the mistake profusely.

I had the chicken and filet. The filet definitely stole the show. It was cooked perfectly (medium rare), tender, juicy, and bursting with flavor. The chicken was pretty mediocre, but in no way bad. The meal came with a soup, which was a bit on the bland side when compared to other Japanese soups Ive had, a salad that was fresh and light, fried rice that was pretty standard fare, and shrimp that took a close second to the filet in the taste category. My wife had the scallops, which sampled as well, and found them to be tender and delicious.

Sushi was passable, we got a California Roll and I didn&#39;t think it was anything special. The chicken hibachi was awesome! It came with shrimp, fried rice and the veggies. Our chef let the birthday girl flip and egg and cook at the grill a bit which Was awesome. They also sang to my friend and she got a free dessert. I thought overall the experience was really nice and worth the money, as it is a bit pricier than similar restaurants.

Came here to celebrate a birthday of sorts with friends. The location is super random, essentially sandwiched between a Menards and Michaels. But yeah, this is a hibachi and sushi place. Decently expensive, decent food. 

For those not familiar with Hibachi-style cooking, you sit at a table that surrounds a grill as the chef cooks for you and puts on a show. Lots of flashy knifework, lots of fire, lots of fun. 

The hibachi meal is about $25 and comes with a mushroom-miso soup, a little salad, and your choice of protein over fried rice. This is the same price as roughly 15 pieces of sushi here.

Our hibachi chef was not really all that spectacular. His performance was unimpressive and it felt pretty forced. It was also unnecessarily loud - I was having trouble hearing my friends speak over all the steel-on-steel clanging, which was cute and fun at first but went on a bit too long. Still, making a volcano out of onions is a neat little trick, and we had a good time. 

The food was really good. The miso mushroom soup was beautifully rich and savory without being too heavy and the salad, while forgetabble on its own, was a nice clean flavor between the soup and the main dish. The fried rice and calamari were lovely, definitely a lot better than I expected it to be after a man had tossed it around like a ball for several minutes. 

Lastly, the servers brought out a &#34;surprise&#34; birthday dessert (the surprise sort of died when the server asked &#39;Oh is it someone&#39;s birthday?&#39; after we ordered the dessert discreetly) which was served with a smile and a rather brusque rendition of what was presumably a Japanese birthday song. No explanation was provided. 

Overall good food, pretty disappointing service, rather expensive. If you want a proper Hibachi experience, I&#39;d hit up a Benihana."

My wife and I love coming to Kiku whenever we get the chance.  From the atmosphere, to the service, and most importantly the food!  This is a great place to come for date nights and also for quick lunchtime sushi cravings!  The teppanyaki is also amazing.  I normally get the steak and my wife gets the chicken.  For sushi rolls I recommend the Kiku Rainbow and the Lobster Dynamite, but you really can&#39;t go wrong with anything you order.  We absolutely love Kiku! Keep up the great work guys!"

To this day, I still have fond memory of this place. The chefs all can perform amazing tricks with their cooking utensils, ingredients, oil, and fire. So you are never bored while waiting for your food. In addition, I highly recommend getting the fried rice over the normal white rice. Like most Japanese steakhouse, it is teppanyaki style. The portions are quite generous, so I would recommend people share multiple combo sets like Surf &amp; Turf, scallop, shrimp, etc. Reservation is recommended during busy hours. In addition, if you are celebrating your birthday, you should definitely share with the waiter as they give you free small ice cream or cake. Enjoy!"

You can find them all at this restaurant. I have been here twice. Once for a birthday party and once for a get together.  The second time was my favorite. Here is why this is a fun time:

1. It paces how fast you stuff your face with food. They want to make sure you don&#39;t inhale your food like most American restaurants. They bring out your soup, then your salad, and one by one your main hibachi course is made. And if you don&#39;t eat them as they come out, you risk each part getting cold till the next part comes. 


2.  It keeps you distracts from stuffing your face with food. You have live entertainment by your chef. You also can join in. Whether it&#39;s the chef allowing you to bounce an egg on a metal spatula or the chef tossing a shrimp in your mouth, you are entertained. 


The food is average in my opinion. The sushi was probably the best part and I didn&#39;t order the rolls so I don&#39;t really know what they were except delicious. The hibachi chef was very good. The service was good too. They give you a hot moist towel at the beginning of your experience. They do take reservations. There is plenty of free parking. 

The bathrooms don&#39;t have a coat hanger inside each stall. That&#39;s annoying for your purse. 

Food:
1. Soup was decent. I liked the green onions
2. Salad was not that good but a very small part of your meal
3. Appetizer shrimp was average
4. Ginger, wasabi and other sauce were good to try but gross on the seafood (I had scallops and shrimp)
5. Avoid the egg butter sauce on your shrimp. It&#39;s neither buttery nor savory. It&#39;s just yellow goop. 
6. The veggie fried rice is just ok. Needs more salt. 
7. Scallops were decent

That is all."

First, as you walk in, the vestibule looked like it happened been swept in a long time...and this is how you enter the establishment. I was surprised to see how big this place was and wondered if it ever gets filled. Besides us, there was only one party around the hibachi table. When we looked at the menu, it seemed scarce. There were dishes that seemed to be main dishes aa appetizers. Also, the sushi menu seemed limited. We ordered our food and then were told the Tonkantsu was out??? So not many options and some aren&#39;t available?? Portions were small and I honestly got sick from the sushi I ate later in the afternoon. Needless to say this place left a bad taste in my mouth and I will not be returning. I agree...I am not sure who is giving this place high ratings???"

Mis en scene: my wife is in the hospital having just given birth to our second son.

For the duration of the pregnancy, she craved Kiku, as we enjoy their restaurant fairly regularly. When she had my first son, I left the hospital to get her an assortment of rolls to enjoy from Kiku. Wanting to make it a tradition, I went as soon as she was moved to her room and cleared to eat.

I made it to Kiku at 9:35 (25 mins before their posted 10PM closing time), only to be met by a man rushing across the restaurant yelling that they are closed. When I stated that I didn&#39;t want to sit, only to get a platter to take to the hospital, he forcefully repeated that they are closed and that I had to leave. No apologies...
Talk about a disappointing experience, and one that put a damper on an exhilarating day.

I got to the car, and checked if there was any other sushi restaurant open nearby, and decided to try my luck at Shinto up the street. I walked in 5 mins before they closed (10PM) explained the situation, and they readily agreed to reopen their kitchen to make our rolls. 

Kiku, you may not care, but you have lost this customer, and any of my friends that go there.  Shame on you!"

Located in a strip mall gives it a local hideaway feel but, you will walk away feeling like you found Naperville&#39;s best kept secret (or not since I always try to convince people to come here)

Forget about it being my favorite hibachi... Its in my list of favorites overall!"
kiku-japanese-steakhouse-and-sushi-naperville,Joe E.,TvOwopkAJDtZQ0fUVgkF_w,"Winfield, IL",1,1,1,85,6,2LP2-nLiwt31-Dto_CClPw,3.0,2016-01-03,"We had a reservation for 5 people for 7:30. We were not seated until 8:15. I felt awful for the staff, because other people with earlier reservations were experiencing similar issues, and they unfortunately had to deal with the anger of the customers. I wasn&#39;t really upset, but it sort of is unacceptable to make a reservation, and to be seated 45 minutes after said reservation. What is the point?

Anyways, after finally being seated, we ordered drinks and sushi. My mom ordered some wine. The rest of us ordered waters. Unfortunately, my mom&#39;s glass was extremely dirty. Another demerit for Kiku. I will say that things got better from here.

I&#39;ll strictly stick to my orders; For Sushi, I ordered two a la carte tamago rolls. I&#39;d never had egg sushi, but I was pleasantly surprised. The egg was cooked (sorry, no pictures), and basically was a wall around some white rice. The egg was slightly sweet, which I enjoyed. 

For my Hibachi meal, I ordered the steak/shrimp combo. I requested the steak be cooked medium, and I was given the choice to have my shrimp cooked teriyaki, hibachi, or with egg yolk. I chose the latter. Each hibachi meal is given the option of a chicken broth soup or miso soup. I went with the miso. You are also given a 4 piece shrimp appetizer (that came with the meal) and the option of veggie or chicken fried rice. The chicken is an upcharge, so I decided on the veggie.

The miso soup was very good. Strong flavors which included green onion, tofu, and seaweed. A bit small, but nothing too much to complain about. 

The fried rice came next. Excellent as well. It&#39;s hard to mess up eggs, vegetables, and rice, but our Chef had a nice presentation, too.

The main course was stellar. My shrimp appetizer was small, but my portions of vegetables, steak, and shrimp were acceptable. The steak was cooked to my request. Same goes for the vegetables, which featured zucchini, onions, and carrots.

The highlight of my meal was my egg yolk prepared shrimp. First off, the shrimp were much larger than the appetizer portion. Secondly, not being a huge seafood guy, I wasn&#39;t sure how good it would be. Well, the results were awesome. Simply put, my favorite part of the meal. The chef placed egg yolk on top of the cooked shrimp, and steamed it on the hibachi grill. The result was an extremely decadent dish! Very rich, but so good!!!

Overall, the food was fantastic. Our hibachi chef was playful and entertaining. I will note that I caught one of the shrimp tosses from our chef; I was the only one at our table!!! Our waitress was a bit airhead-y (I made a joke about the &#39;guacamole&#39; on the sushi plate... she thought I was serious) but she was nice. She mostly kept my water full as well.

I would like to give Kiku another chance, but compared to other similar restaurants in the area, I&#39;m not sure why I would return. Prices are comparable, but there was nothing that screams COME BACK. Especially with the reservation snafu."

It seemed like all the good looking women with husbands obviously outkicking their coverage were out tonight! It also seemed the ideal Naperville family (4.6 people) Dad working a business job, mom staying at home (drinking a lot of wine as she probably would while at Shinto), the oldest child: young &#34;bro&#34; with his flat brim hat and Abercrombie pants, the middle child in middle school who is athletic and &#34;has a chance to be an awesome high school basketball player), wearing her Uggz,  and the little brother who just wants to play on his PS4 and drink Coca Cola all night! PROPERS TO YOU, NAPERVILLE!

Went here on a Saturday night with a 7:30 reservation! My cousin (who is more than 30 years old) called this place AMAZEBALLS. I looked forward to it...kept on looking forward to it...Yes, I understand it was a busy Saturday night but being seated at 8:15 for a 7:30 reservation...Come on Kiku!

We were seated and to the shock of our server, she noticed that my brother and I were related. This tends to happen when you have a twin. We were hungry (HANGRY girls in the group...uh oh). We ordered the sushi and drinks as soon as possible (which was 15 minutes after we sat down). Water and other drinks came about 10 minutes after the order. My mom&#39;s wine glass wasn&#39;t cleaned very well and we ALWAYS discuss being &#34;THOSE PEOPLE&#34; who complain about everything, but all five of us could see lip marks. PROPZ to the waitress for taking it right away. Salads and miso soup came out, then finally our sushi (almost a half hour later SAD FACE HERE). Our orders were in! Since we all know how hibachi works, I ordered the steak (RARE) and scallops. I was excited because it also came with shrimp...but more on that later. I ordered the scallop a la carte and spicy tuna sushi which were pricey, but delicious! 

Our cook was awesome. I am sure he deals with hangry people all the time. He got our food out, did some volcanoes, made some butterfly, and did the beating heart. That&#39;s what this is: EXPERIENCE! He also went around the table and did the obligatory shrimp toss to which only my brother caught! I HAD IT and it rimmed out. The lovely British people at our table also tried (and failed). The youngest looking lad, who no doubt reads (IE worships) Harry Potter, plays football (soccer, but not very well) and loves fish and chips, said &#34;I always catch a shrimp when I go to places like these!&#34;. Well, let me be the first to tell you: HE FAILED...thrice! My aformentioned twin brother was the only one who caught the shrimp on a fly! Another example of America kicking Britain&#39;s&#39; booty. SINCE 1776 THESE COLORS don&#39;t run. 

I want to go back, I really do. The food and cook were AWESOME! The server was good, but it seemed like it was understaffed or overbooked. I want to go back and see if they can take and KEEP a reservation.

Kiku, I want to choose you (again), like Pikachu, but it&#39;d be hard with Shinto right down the road."

I have been a customer here for a very very long time, gosh, probably ten years now!  Over the years we have been to several other hibachi restaurants but we always seem to keep coming back here.  Why?  Because the quality of the food and service are hands down consistently better than other places.  

The hibachi chicken, steak, lobster, and scallops are always cooked just right.  Not too salty.  The sauces that go with them are delicious.  The salad that accompanies the meal is fresh and tasty.  And when it comes to the &#34;show&#34; with knife tricks etc, they seem to have the best overall presentation, relying on good clean wholesome fun---like flipping food into your mouth and making fiery volcanoes.  I also notice that although the prices are a bit higher than some other hibachi grills, I always seem to have enough to take home for a light meal the next day which makes up for it.  

Finally, Kiku&#39;s is a great supporter of our school fundraisers.  I have come here several times to ask for gift certificates and they have been extremely generous.  While many restaurants and businesses no longer participate in fundraisers with donations, Kiku&#39;s has always come through with something big to help us out with raising money.  

I hope that Kiku&#39;s stays around for a very long time.  And I just ask that those of us who benefit from the donations from Kiku&#39;s that we return the favor.  When choosing a restaurant for lunches, dinners, celebrations, etc etc...please do remember Kiku&#39;s!  The food is delicious, service is great, this is a fun &amp; entertaining place to bring both kids and adults, plus the most important thing to remember is that they are generous supporters of our schools and our community!

My first experience was for my bf&#39;s birthday two years ago, and from that moment on, we were hooked. On that visit, we had the hibachi, which of course is fun to experience at least once. Now we just go for the sushi, and last night was probably our third trip to Kiku. Over the years, we have received about $200 in gift cards for here, so that helps bring us out, too. Kiku isn&#39;t always a cheap date.

We were seated promptly in the sushi bar, right next to the main bar, which we found convenient. Our server, Coco, was extremely friendly. We both ordered Sapporo&#39;s,  to which she asked &#34;the large one, right?&#34; Nice upsell, Coco. We both told her that&#39;d be fine (I usually just get the smaller one). We received our drinks immediately; Coco even poured them in our glasses, which most of the time at other places, the server just sets the bottles and glasses down at the table.

We both ordered Miso soup, as we always do. Kiku&#39;s miso soup is excellent.  The tofu is soft and silky, it literally melts in your mouth. Between spoonfuls the bf and I made our first round sushi selections.

For the maki selection, I ordered spicy tuna rolls, and the bf picked spicy salmon rolls. We also ordered sushi consisting of Hamachi (yellowtail) and smoked salmon for the bf. Finally we each chose a specialty roll; the Ecuador for him and Crispy Volcano for me. The Crispy Volcano is chopped tuna, buttered crispy rice with thin slices of jalapeno, cilantro, and a specialty sauce on top.

For a Wednesday,  I was surprised how busy they were. Every table and hibachi station was full. Normally when we come here, we are the only ones in the sushi bar and there&#39;s one group having hibachi. I&#39;m not sure if it was from the full moon or there was a special going on that we were unaware of.

Our food arrived in under ten minutes, which was great. All of our selections were fabulous; fresh and flavorful. We tried to eat slowly to save our food and hopefully make some room for round two, but we were quite piggish and finished rather quickly. Nonetheless, we ordered a second round.

The second time around, we did order a few more of the Hamachi and smoked salmon, and I decided to get the Kappa Maki (cucumber strips) to help quash the burn from the fresh sliced jalapenos from my Crispy Volcano. After that, we were clearly done.

I couldn&#39;t be more pleased with our server Coco. The food was fabulous, and even though it was quite crowded, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The only irritating moment was when a mother, her tween daughter, and three little ones under the age of 6 were seated near us. The young ones were obnoxiously loud. One of them wouldn&#39;t sit down and kept flailing about in between tables, making it difficult for the servers to bring out orders. The second kept trying to climb out of his high chair, thus knocking over dishes, silverware, and other various objects on the table. The third kept calling for her mother&#39;s attention in the loudest voice I&#39;ve ever heard from a little girl. Thank god they arrived near the end of our experience, but the twenty minutes we had to endure their antics was pure torture. We left Coco an extremely generous tip and got the hell outta there.

I definitely recommend Kiku&#39;s for anyone who likes sushi or hibachi. The food is really good and is consistent. The interior is beautiful and intimate with dimmed lights.  It can be quite an enjoyable experience."

Could not breathe. The place smells. I have been to many hibachi restaurants, but this one has really bad ventilation. To make things worse, had a reservation for six, but they made us wait for more than 10 minutes with no updates. We left. Could not stand waiting in the smell.

If you&#39;re looking for hibachi grills at your table however , this would be the second choice to Beni Hana. Cheap decor and touches throughout however , including splintered chopsticks and hand towels that are basically just wet wipes.

It&#39;s a bit pricey for my taste, but the food is definitely worth it. Plus, it&#39;s not just the meal you&#39;re paying for, it&#39;s the experience...

Over the years Kiku has become a staple spot in my family for special occasions (typically birthdays). It truly is a fantastic place for groups! My family usually starts off with sushi, pot stickers and edamame for appetizers then pair off and split hibachi bowls which also comes with miso soup and salad (this is more than enough!). It&#39;s the perfect mix of my favorite foods and live entertainment behind the grill! 

Service has always been great. The tricks on the grill get me every time and kids love it! I appreciate all the interaction that happens while prepping the food - makes for a fun and delicious evening :)

I&#39;ve thoroughly enjoyed everything I&#39;ve tried here, but here&#39;s a few shout-out to my fave dishes...

-Edamame
-Gyoza
-Hibachi Steak/Shrimp
-Sea Scallop
-Godzilla Maki
-911 Dragon Roll
-Spicy Tuna Roll
-Caterpillar Maki
-Crunchy Maki

I really enjoy their miso soup and Kiku roll, their hibachi tables are also usually a pretty good time. My only criticism would be that the service isn&#39;t always on point. I usually get pretty good service at the hibachi table but not at the single tables for sushi. Regardless, I highly recommend this place to any sushi-lover!"

The sushi is really delicious, and the miso soup is to die for! The hibachi is good, too. Even if you don&#39;t sit at the hibachi table, it&#39;s incredibly fun to watch the chefs entertain the guests that do sit around them. 

So why three stars? The service is atrocious. We had the same server the last two times we went and it was just a horrible mess. The first time, she brought us our bill before verifying we were done with dinner, when we hadn&#39;t even requested the check yet. The place wasn&#39;t busy, so it wasn&#39;t like they were trying to hurry us along (which wouldn&#39;t make it right anyway.) We ordered some light sushi, and were going to order another round, plus some drinks and dessert, but we never got the chance. The waitress just dropped off the check and left. We tried waiting around for a bit to tell her to add some more stuff to it, but it took her forever to come back. By that time, we were over it. 

Then another time we went, same server, same horrible communication. My husband ordered a Tanqueray martini. Five minutes later, the waitress comes back asking him to verify what he wanted. Ten minutes after that, she comes and says &#34;I&#39;m sorry, the bartender doesn&#39;t know how to make that.&#34; Exasperated, I said &#34;your bartender doesn&#39;t know how to make a martini?!&#34; Then she said that the bartender doesn&#39;t have what we requested, and I had to politely point out that I saw the Tanqueray sitting right there on the shelf. We had our food before my husband had his drink, but I did have a nice view of the waitress standing around the bar with a very confused look on her face for about twenty minutes, so that was fun. 

I would visit Kiku a lot more often if I knew I could get reliable service. The food really is incredible, but being frustrated definitely is not."

Piece of advice to the owners, if you are trying to cut costs to stay in business, you are in trouble, I come for the service and the food. Tonight you failed on both counts.

The appearance of the restaurant is so different and perfect for a date. We came in for the sushi after finding out about Kiku on Yelp and were not disappointed. The first visit we had: Kiku Soup (I think ; it has mushrooms) the California Roll, Spider Roll, and the Lobster Dynamite. It was delicious and prepared quickly considering how packed it was. Our second visit was yesterday evening and it wasn&#39;t opened on both sides of the restaurant, just one but still had a decent amount of people. This time I had the soup, him a salad. We also are another Spider Roll, filet mignon and shrimp with hibachi rice and vegetables. Once again great food and served in a short amount of time.

It&#39;s certainly NOT a place I will frequent or even consider dining at again.

My problem is the price.  I called an order in for two philly rolls, a spicy tuna roll, a cali roll, a salmon skin roll, three ikura, two tako and a salad and the total came to nearly $70.00.  I believe that is a lot to pay for only three people when none of us were sated.  For the price, I feel the rolls should have been more substantial.

I&#39;ve had better sushi at places that cost less (ie. cali rolls are $4-$5 instead of Kiku&#39;s $7).  I will not return to Kiku unless they&#39;re having a special.  I know that sounds frugal but they really weren&#39;t worth the money.  In this case, you don&#39;t get what you pay for."

About three years ago, my boyfriend&#39;s family and I went for dinner there and I absolutely remember how delicious the food was. Anyway, my boyfriend&#39;s sister wanted the family to go out for his birthday, so when she asked me where we should go, I suggested to come back here. 

My second experience was just as good as the first, if not yummier :) We had a party of 7, where they seated us near the windows, however, it was so cold that we requested to be moved, and within 15 minutes or so, we got prime seating in the main dining room. Starting with service, our waitress was just OK - she kept forgetting things that I would ask of her and never brought out something that I asked for, which wasn&#39;t a big deal or anything, but unpleasant enough to rate this only 4 stars. Our hibachi chef (wish I knew his name) was incredibly social and fun, with a great smile the entire time. We asked him to do something different and he made us an angel of fire out of onions/eggs - really cool! 

Now onto the food.. the miso soup that was given with the dinner entree was absolutely delicious and different from any I have tried. To be honest, I am so sick of miso soup, but this one had mushrooms in it and was not as salty as they usually are. For an appetizer, I ordered myself one sushi roll - Spicy Tuna Carpaccio - Salmon, spicy tuna, tomato, seaweed salad, red tobiko, avocado, cucumber. It was one of those crazy special rolls, where one piece is hard to fully fit in your mouth, but it was one of the best I&#39;ve had. We&#39;ve had other sushi there before and I remember it all being good. 

All but one of us had the hibachi style dinner - I picked the combo entree of Filet mignon/shrimp. Since the meats/fish are all made at different times, I had most of my rice by the time I got my meat, but it was all incredible, especially because they provide a tray with three sauces that you can pick and choose from. Everyone ordered different entrees, but it was all very much enjoyed. 

For my boyfriend&#39;s birthday, they brought out a delicious chocolate lava type of cake with a candle and they sang him a song - very cute! The atmosphere is pleasant, giving off an authentic Japanese vibe. There is the main dining room, private seating, sushi dining room, and even a mini-lounge area - all with a red theme and Asian lamps. 

I definitely recommend Kiku for a special occasion - Delicious, fairly priced, and a fine environment!"

It&#39;s a place for people who think they&#39;re into sushi, and think if they pay a lot for it then it must be good. A typical suburban hotspot...almost good.  I think there are way better sushi places in the area for the price... The lines here are always killer long too which would lead one to believe its super delicious. I&#39;m not saying this place is bad... But if you&#39;re a foodie and you really dig sushi...this place probably won&#39;t tickle your fancy as much as the typical person.

*update*
Man, I went here again recently and this place is just as lackluster as I remember. The sushi is so mediocre it&#39;s painful. Every roll tastes exactly the same. We got spicy rolls with jalapeño and you could&#39;ve fooled me... Tasted about the equivalent of spicy if you had put green pepper on it.

I must admit, we tend to skip the hibachi. I will say the hibachi tables are usually full when we go there. They have expanded their restaurant and with good reason. It&#39;s a popular restaurant and they needed to accommodate for their growing clientele. They are constantly improving and adding to their menu. One of their newer rolls is the bacon bomber. It&#39;s got bacon in it, enough said! They have a points card, it&#39;s free to obtain one. If the food isn&#39;t enough of a draw, the service staff should be. Whether busy or not, their good service doesn&#39;t lag. Also a great place to celebrate special occasions. They have tatami rooms that can accommodate your party, you can reserve one of the hibachi tables, or just group a few tables in their regular dining area.

This was my first visit here  but others in our party had been here before.  As far as Hibachi goes this place rates very high.  Compared to Benihana I would choose Kiku now any day.   Don&#39;t let the location in a strip mall fool you.   This place is top notch.  I had the steak for dinner which was a New York strip.   My wife had the filet which I tried and was excellent also.   We had a party of 13 and others had lobster, chicken, and scallops too which everybody said their meal was outstanding.  The kids menu is limited on the hibachi but we knew our 5 year old would not want that.  We ordered a chicken appetizer which was the closest thing to chicken tenders.  There were great too for those picky eaters.   I&#39;m not a sushi person but others seemed to really enjoy theirs.  The Hibachi chefs did the typical table tricks and even let our 10 year try to flip the eggs while making the fried rice.   

My only complaint was we had a 6:30 reservation and we didn&#39;t get seated until about 7:15.  Yes it was Saturday night and yes we had a party of 13 and it was busy but 45 mins past your reservation time is a little bit much especially when you&#39;re told at 6:30 it would be just a few minutes.  We were told after a few inquiries as to what the wait was we were told they were waiting on a specific set of tables for our large party to be seated the people were just sitting after paying and chit chatting.  But after seeing several parties of 6 or 8 being seated together we thought we could have been seated at those before them.  After finally being seated it did take quite a long time to get drinks ordered and then even longer to finally make our food order.   By this time I was short on patience and thought I&#39;d never ever come back here but once the food came that changed my tune pretty quickly.  I&#39;m looking forward to going back and hoping not for a repeat of the reservation fiasco."

The service isn&#39;t bad, and neither is the food, but they aren&#39;t great either.  I realize that for a lot of people the &#39;atmosphere&#39; is very important, but to me it isn&#39;t--I would prefer clean and simple--and that&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for when you go to Kiku: the atmosphere.  I don&#39;t mind spending a hundred dollars on my dinner, but I would prefer to be paying for my food, not the things that hang on the walls.  The food itself isn&#39;t bad or anything, it&#39;s just that I didn&#39;t find it to be any different or any better than the generic offerings you find these days at hibachi/sushi places.  The food is two stars and service is maybe three stars, but the prices (or more like what I&#39;m paying for) brings it all down to two."

We wanted a full dinner but I think the server misunderstood, brought us our appetizers and another drink and then left us.  Next time we saw her, she brought over our bill.  Uh..hello?  We came for dinner, but didn&#39;t even get a chance to order it for some reason.  I&#39;m sure there was a misunderstanding on both sides as I should have made it very clear that we didn&#39;t just want appetizers, but c&#39;mon... you may want to ask if we want to order a meal when you bring them to us. (sigh)

The place was beautiful and we were able to be seated away from the grills so we could actually talk and hear each other - which was easily accomplished. 

As for the food we did get, it was delicious.  The rolls were well made and tasted very fresh and clean.  Well made and very tasty! Yum.

Only drawback was the pricing is pretty high for what you get.  Yes, the place looks fantastic as does the food, but if you go there be prepared to pay way more than you would think compared to other upscale sushi restaurants. 

I&#39;d definitely go back to try a full meal, but it is dang pricy for the experience.  Great service, friendly staff, and great food."

The food is enough that you definitely get full. The miso soup and ginger salad are tasty. I&#39;ve had just about every combination of hibachi.  The taste is always similar no matter what you order but it&#39;s always tasty. This is no different than any other hibachi having similar tasting food. I&#39;ve also ordered off their regular menu but usually get the hibachi. The price isn&#39;t bad and the decor is nice. Definitely keep coming back.

The contemporary decor adds a very unique touch. The bar has every drink you need. The food is absolutely to DIE for. I have never ordered anything other than the &#34;Egg Yolk Shrimp combination with Chicken or Beef&#34; and I don&#39;t ever plan to order anything different.

I&#39;m not a huge fan of hibachi, but agreed to go as it was her pick.  I don&#39;t care for hiachi as it seems you eat in shifts.  First was the fried rice.  Then came a 4 piece shrimp &#34;appetizer&#34;  Not sure why they called it an appetizer as is was served after the fried rice.  Then the seafood dishes were made and served, and then the beef dishes.  I&#39;m also not a fan of the ginger salad dressing that every hibachi seems to have.  I asked if they had alternative dressings and the waitress said &#34;no&#34;.  So I ordered my salad plain without dressing.

So then the chef comes and proceeds to serve 3 sauces to each diner.  One was a horseradish/ranch type sauce.  I dipped a fork full of my salad in and it was very good so i poured that over my salad.

Service was good.  Ordered 3 different rolls to share off the sushi menu and those were all good.  Drinks were pricey as was the dinners.  For the 6 of us with drinks and tip, the bill was $325.

So why only 3 stars?  I&#39;m not fond of the chef flipping pieces of shrimp at people and expecting them to catch it in their mouths.  Most people miss, so the floor has these pieces of shrimp scattered about...which may or may not explain why the floors were so sticky."

We waited nearly an hour after being seated at our table for the chef to begin preparation of the meal, only because the people who were seated just after us requested him.  The rice is marginal at best, with a hint of sweetness that should not be in rice.  Some of the vegetables were obviously frozen, which does not appeal to me and then lacked sufficient amount of sauce.  The filet was delicious, as it was properly prepared, however, the mushrooms prepared with them were barely cooked, nearly raw.   The most pathetic part of the meal was the scallops, which were rather thin, then nearly burned on the grill top.  My wife was without a beverage for nearly 30 minutes during our wait for the sub-par chef."

It was... good, but I felt the steak wasn&#39;t all that flavorful.  It was on the same level as Domo 77.  I think Shinto is an overall more impressive experience.  No complaints, just expected it to be a cut above the rest.  Never tried Shinto, Kiku or Domo 77?  They all are good, but for my money...

HOWEVER

If I could rate it lower, I certainly would. Made a reservation for friday night, earlier in the  day. I greeted the hostess and she responded rather currently, &#34; stand over there and I&#39;ll seat you in a bit&#34;.  Given that I was trying to be well behaved with the date I was with I let it slide......This time....

Place was packed with a number of walk ins , who were waiting to be seated. (easily greater than 6 different parties of three or more)  Again we are only two &amp; with a reservation.  She then started to seat a number of walk ins first!

I grabbed who I thought was the manager as he was passing by, (turns out it was the owner!) who states well you&#39;re just going to have to wait. A reservation gets you a table after a 10 minute wait. ( it was actually approaching 20 minutes )

I gave him a few choice words and told him.....I hope with poor operations management like this and insensitivity to focus on throughput times....I hope his restaurant flounders and flops like a dead fish on a boat and burns to the  ground in front of his eyes.  I have lived in Chicago proper, New york and Boston. I have worked in a restaurant when I was younger and to not have the courtesy and decorum of how to treat customers is the ultimate sin in my opinion.

This was a business trip, and it was quiet enough for us to talk at a comfortable level.  We had several appetizers, including gyoza, edmame, calamari, which were all good. 

The main course came with the show (of course - sorry, couldn&#39;t resist the pun).  The artistry is scripted (we saw the same show going on at other tables), which is fine.  The chef&#39;s patter was pleasant, and he even invited one of our party to try to flip catch one of the eggs.  (He wasn&#39;t successful - I think more got on the floor than the grill).

Anyway, if you like this type of food, it is a pretty good show and the prices aren&#39;t bad."

Our waitress was a bit overbearing and stood in front of us as my mom was eating her pork chops, waiting for her to finish so she could put the rest in a box.

Late Saturday afternoon I decided to make a reservation, just in case... and I&#39;m glad I did.  Our reservation was at 8pm.  We arrived at about 7:50-ish and requested to be seated outside.

Aren&#39;t reservations taken first come, first serve?  I did mention what I just saw and I was told &#34;they had an advance reservation&#34; A what??? - Yeah, so did we...we got seated promptly after that.

After that scenario everything was great...our server was great, he gave some great wine recommendations, and just like every restaurant, the up-price on the wine is ridiculous!  A $19.99 bottle of wine at Binnys is $65 here!!! Buyer beware... we opted for the $40 bottle, which is probably $12.99 at the store. *eye roll*  it was good, I wanted a nice meal out so this place served it&#39;s purpose.

My dinner companion had gnocchi with bolognese sauce, and the gnocchi were a tad heavy.

I hate the congestion of downtown Naperville but it&#39;s worth threading my truck through the swarm of Prius just to get here.  Either way, the food...... 
The entrées here are hearty, high quality, made with fresh ingredients, and done correctly.  The veal parmigiano was enormous, the cheese was very good - not some slice of prepackaged junk. The tomato sauce was outstanding.  The Alfredo sauce was creamy but not too heavy and the pasta had a perfect texture.
All of the desserts we tried were fantastic. 
I like places like this because they don&#39;t have to play up their ethnicity to appear authentic. It&#39;s honest good food the way it was intended.

The place was packed when we got there but service was pretty good. Our glasses were never empty and the waiter was attentive.  No complaints there at all.

In all, it&#39;s not much more expensive than the Olive Garden (which is the worst thing to ever victimize Italian food) the portions are good, the ingredients are fresh, and the ambiance is very nice - even if dining outside in Naperville is like living in a Gap advertisement from 1999.

We went in for an anniversary dinner and wound up disappointed.  We had a reservation (Open Table) and still waited almost 20 minutes.  We were lucky enough to grab a couple of seats at the bar while we waited, then we waited, and waited for over 10 minutes to be asked if we wanted a drink.  The drinks were a nice pour. 

Once we were squished, I mean seated, in the back room of the restaurant we were served by two alternating wait staff.  They tried but it was too loud and too crowded.  Don&#39;t worry I fixed the wobbly table with an extra napkin.

Food was excellent...however...I ordered asparagus go on top of my steak salad and it came on a second plate.  While I was cutting it the waitress came over and asked how everything was tasting (which is a term I despise) and I said well the asparagus came on a second plate.  her answer &#34;well the kitchen is busy as you know&#34;.  I do know but a good kitchen and wait staff would have coordinated and gotten my order correct.

Overall I rate it a MEH."

Its a four stars this time, last time was a one so it really should be 2.5 stars lol

The waiter this around is much better, came back to check on us several times!

Food were much better, we ordered another salmon, its pretty big but tasted OK :)

*******************************************

Services were OK but food cant say the same!

However they do have a large wine and cocktail list :)  To start out my meal, ordered a super refreshing cocktail call cucumber martini!  

We ordered salmon, it looked pretty fresh, topped w/ spinach.  We did ask them to cook it medium but it was over cooked....!

I had a steak, asked for medium rare......but guess what is was probably 90% 95 cooked :)"

Manager and hostess staff very nicely dressed.  Good food, but I think a few tacky details stuck out during my visit: Black pepper in a shaker, not a peppermill/grinder.  Powdered Parmesan cheese, not freshly shredded. A college football game/ESPN playing on the TV at the pizza oven counter, for the entire restaurant to watch.  These kinds of things just cheapen the atmosphere, making you quietly mumble to yourself, &#34;Hmmph&#34; and slightly raise an eyebrow at the end when you open the folio to reveal the total bill.

It was a beautiful day so we sat outside on the patio to watch the people of Naperville as we enjoyed some delicious food. The waiter we had was very friendly and helpful in recommending drinks and dishes and even provided us with some great inside information. I know know where 8 finger cavatelli got its name... I felt like the service may have been a tad slow, but I didn&#39;t overly mind and everything I asked for I did receive. 

I started out my meal with a super refreshing cocktail called the cucumber martini. I don&#39;t remember what in it gave it this pink color - but it was super refreshing. For lunch, I had the 8 finger cavatelli. It was a great sized portion and left me with a late night snack later that night (as I was too stuffed for a proper dinner). And if all that wasn&#39;t enough, we topped it off with a desert that I can&#39;t remember the name of - but essentially it was fried pieces of dough rolled in cinnamon and sugar and topped with ice cream and chocolate sauce. 

Everything was great. I guess a little pricey, but for a special lunch or dinner this is a great option downtown."

This review is solely for how they handled a REQUEST for a table of two in the middle of the afternoon - past what one would assume is a rush time. 

I so appreciated not one but two people greeting our approach to the host area with disdain and anger. Slamming menus down on the counter was a real bonus, as was the loud and looooong sigh. 

Also enjoyed being told that it would be &#34;at least 30 minutes, maybe more&#34; to be seated, though we could clearly count a dozen open tables.

Those frowns turned upside down when we told them not to worry, we weren&#39;t staying. A nice touch to feign concern and eke out an &#34;I&#39;m sowwwy&#34; look. Meanwhile, the only way it could have been ANY clearer you didn&#39;t want us there would have been if you held up a giant &#34;GT FO&#34; sign and pointed to it. We did GT FO, never to return."

I miss the old location, it was charming, quaint, romantic... dangerous* 

..but I don&#39;t think their business was good enough because they made that strange switch to being a burger place that served Italian...

*and the ever present floods and fire..

So they moved over to the old Martini&#39;s (steak and cocktail place) which itself took over the spot from the Cuban joint. 

Now they are back to being an Italian place, and that&#39;s what we had. I was jonesing for some pasta.. carbs and sauce and protein. It was Labor Day and a lot of places weren&#39;t open. Rosebud was, and they were open for a late lunch. Easy decision for us. 

We sat in a booth, the booths are nice big curved affairs that strangely back to the windows.. making the restaurant the focal point. So we looked around (took the waiter a while to get to us) and were kind of confused.. the nice booths had the paper placemats and the tables were all white tablecloth.. kind of a mix of two styles.

Our neighbor (facing out we just watched him eat) was having some Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken.. that&#39;s what I wanted, the look of the ribbons of pasta bathed in sauce was too much to bear. I wanted it, but Lisa ordered it..(curses! foiled again!) I had to get something else.

Gnocchi Bolognese, it was calling my name (not as loudly as the FA was.. but well.. you know what happened there)

The gave us some bread, with the plate of olive oil and parmesan. We ran out, waited and had  to ask for more. 

I started with a Caesar Salad that was both lovely and tasty, the parmesan crisps were all angular and made the plate interesting.

Lisa&#39;s Fettuccine came and was very appealing looking, my Gnocchi wasn&#39;t quite so pretty, but it&#39;s tough to be pretty when you are a lump of dough in a meat sauce. 

Lisa wasn&#39;t so excited about her pasta, she thought that it was good, but a bit bland.. I tried it and agreed, I think that it could have used more cheese in the sauce.. or on top.. some Pecorino Romano.. or Reggiano shavings.. maybe?

My food was very flavorful, and the Gnocchi was very good. The pasta was light, the sauce meaty.. somehow, I lucked out and got the right thing...

Even better was when we started sharing a bit. The Fettuccine was a really good compliment to the Gnocchi. So that&#39;s what we did.. they should sell 1/2 and 1/2 servings.. because that worked out really well.

It&#39;s best not to plan on using their parking lot.. it&#39;s always crowded and can be difficult to maneuver.. it&#39;s a popular mall. There is a small parking lot in the back of the mall and Naperville&#39;s funky three level garage (each level has a separate entrance) across the street. Sometimes, if you look up you&#39;ll spot one of Naperville&#39;s Finest checking you out .. watching to see if you&#39;ve been over-served and are driving. 

I&#39;m knocking Rosebud a bit on service. The room is nice, the food pretty good. We probably won&#39;t go back unless we have friends that want to go there. It&#39;s not a &#34;goto&#34; place for us, although it&#39;s a fine place to go to. It&#39;s pretty much what they were before (that&#39;s before their weird hamburger phase) but in a more upscale atmosphere. 

Probably deserving of a half star more... if I had a half to give."

We had reservations for around 15 people at 2:30. They had a nicely-located table set up for us ready for our large group. 

We began with some shared appetizers that included bruschetta, a mixed green &amp; fruit salad that was on special, as well as the usual bread and oil. We thought the appetizers were all on point, the salad was delicious, some of our group thought it needed more dressing but I disagree. The bruschetta was above average, without a doubt.

Everyone ordered their own entrees. I personally got the Grandma&#39;s Gravy, which was like braised beef over rigatoni with sauce and cheese. I was pleasantly surprised how flavorful and tasty this dish was; the pasta was exactly al dente and the meat cooked to the right temperature. I am always torn whether to order a pasta or a meat dish at Italian restaurants and this was certainly the best of both worlds. I heard good feedback from the fettuccini alfredo, linguine &amp; clams, as well as the skirt steak, and the chicken vesuvio.

The service was good, we had two servers who kept up with my family&#39;s rigorous and incessant demands quite well. Our only gripe would be that they didn&#39;t want to give us more cheese for some reason, the server just kept going around with the jar and spoon asking people individually. No big deal.

The prices seem a little bit higher than similar Italian restaurants. I personally think many of those other places can easily stack up with this Rosebud location. I haven&#39;t been to the other Rosebud restaurants downtown, though.

Not bad! 4/5"

The service at first was terrible. We got bread and water and then waited and waited. Finally the waitress came over and apologized for the confusion (although I saw this happen with at least 2 other tables so they really need to figure this out). The food was mediocre. Definitely MUCH better Italian options in the area. I had the vodka pasta which had a weird taste to the sauce. My husband ordered a sandwich which came with cold French fries. The kids meals were good, but VERY pricey for the portions. In fact everything was overpriced. They charge $15 for a glass of wine when the bottle can be bought at the grocery store for $15. I would also think an Italian restaurant would have more interesting wine choices to entice customers to have a glass or two. The portions were small for the price and the service was less then expected (even after they figured out who our server was). Good location, but there are so many better options around. We won&#39;t be back."

They weren&#39;t really worth ordering and I probably would pass on them next time, but everything else was excellent (even the bread)!

The prices are a bit higher than comparable restaurants, but nothing was totally unreasonable. The service we had was quite good. The server kept up with me on refills, and I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m not an easy one to keep up with. Overall, it was a pleasant experience that I shared with my family.

If you plan on visiting, might I suggest you make reservations ahead of time.  The weekend especially gets super crowded and the wait can get ridiculously long especially around dinner time.

My favorite dish is the mussels mediteranio.  It&#39;s an appetizer on their menu and the broth to this dish is heavenly.  It&#39;s soooo good.  Their calamari is good too.

My only complaint would be how crowded it gets during dinner.  The tables are too close together and it doesn&#39;t seem as private when you&#39;re with someone because other diners are less than 2 feet seated away from you."

(extra bottles of wine, additional appetizers) Because the party was large they didn&#39;t think we would notice.

All of the familiar faces are gone and along with that is that &#34;personal touch&#34; you received. The last three times we have dined we have had less then stellar service.  Today we had lunch and our server visited our table to take our order, clean up our dishes and ask us if we were done. Not once did he ask if we wanted our drinks to be refilled, ask if we wanted more bread, or ask if we wanted dessert or coffee. In fact, we were in and out in less than a half hour, and the sad part was he was taking care of our table and one other.  It was always the food and service together that keeps us coming back but it is becoming less favorable for us to return because of the lack of personal attention and service we are consistently receiving.

Hot spot for a Friday night! We performed a secret shop for this location and while the secret shop was never submitted for review, I absolutely planned to include the details here for my fellow Yelpers and restaurant guroos and foodies to indulge in. Having lived and breathed the restaurant business for over 7 years of my life, dining at upscale establishments like the ones I used to work at is still exciting because I know all the back-end work that gets the place moving and ready for happy diners.

We have been to this location a number of times and other Rosebud locations around Chicago. Above them all, I do find this location to be a favorite. The menus all vary just a little, but this location can be both on the fancier spectrum with their food offerings, or more casual for some nitty gritty, down and home cooked Italian faves. It&#39;s located in a bustling downtown area, parking is more than ample, free, or valet service is available. 

Service: Overall, it was excellent. There were two managers in sight during our visit and both that &#34;touched&#34; us during our dining experience. Our server, Matt, was spot-on with his recommendation of one of the best Chilean Seabass preparations I&#39;ve had in ages and was not kidding about having plenty of delicious leftovers for the next day. He made us feel welcome and was both conversational and professional, despite it being a packed house and his station being packed the entire time of our dining. There&#39;s definite value in serving large portions, so that should be noted and he did just that! The host staff seemed nice enough, but wasn&#39;t overly friendly or smiley. We were seated near the window with full view of the host stand, so at one point I even called the front desk to grab the name of the hostess for my formal review I&#39;ve now submitted to the restaurant directly.

Ambiance: This restaurant is large and loud, in a robust, fun kind of way. If you like small, quaint joints, this one will provide that near the windows and perimeter or in their back room, group dining area. The dim lighting is both romantic and relaxing. You can&#39;t beat the smells coming from that fairly open kitchen! If you don&#39;t have a reservation and there might be a wait, there&#39;s a covered patio portion that is heated, so have no fear. Definitely don&#39;t let that be a deterrent from dining at this fantastic joint during the sub zero evenings.

Food: You&#39;re not going to be cutting many calories when dining here, but you definitely will be leaving with a full belly and happy taste buds. In addition to the Chilean Seabass Velasco (made with white wine, garlic, jalapeno peppers and olive oil + roasted potatoes), we ordered the Stuffed Pork Chops with Provolone, sundried tomatoes, spinach, broccoli, crispy potatoes and a Marsala wine sauce, the Della Casa salad to share (great recommendation from our server, as it&#39;s large!), a few glasses of delicious wine and a sampling of four of their gelato offerings. How about that salted caramel one... amazing! Let&#39;s just say we enjoyed every course! 

Overall: We were stuffed like turkeys when we left, but enjoyed bite after bite of wonderful food and the entire experience. The bathrooms could&#39;ve used a little attention with toilet paper refilling, but really... that&#39;s not bad for a busy Friday night and a restaurant full of indulging patrons. 

Other fun tips:
They have Open Table reservations as an option.
Free parking in Downtown Naperville.
Gift cards available!
Big room for larger group dining is also an option... which is so nice and intimate.

**Edit: apparently not all of you Yelpers get the &#34;ample parking&#34; bit. Honestly, it matters when you get there and to me, 44 spots in the lower parking lot and no fewer than 3 spots in the main parking in front of the restaurant is &#34;ample&#34; to me. I guess I just get lucky because I always seem to snag a spot. And really... how can we complain when we&#39;re not digging for quarters?"

Our waitress lacked in the &#34;good service&#34; department, and we found ourselves asking other servers for help since she was never around or checked back on us. We waited 25 minutes for our check, and another 15 minutes for her to run our card and return it to us.

From beginning to end, I was impressed with the service at this location. First, they were very accommodating when it came to fitting in a party of 15 on the same night as a local high school dance. We were seated right away, our drinks, salads and entrees were quick, and all the food was delicious. 

Our service was exactly what we needed considering we were there for an event. If it had been more of an intimate evening, we might have expected more attentive service, but considering the place was packed and we were loud and rowdy, it was perfect. 

Speaking of loud... There are so many people packed into this place on Saturday night that I felt like I had to shout to be heard. It was crazy busy, and getting to the bathroom without weaving your way through the tables was a challenge. 

All in all, I think this place does a nice job. The food was so tasty that I might even consider just ordering carry out next time."

Some  of these need to be flagged- people aren&#39;t reviewing the restaurant but what happened internally with an employee issue- yelps not for that people! I wanna know what the foods about! Get it together!
      Anyway I came to Rosebuds for the first time for my friends 30th Bday. The place was packed. I hate the parking. The lot is way too small to accommodate all of the business, and the parking garage across the street was completely full. rosebuds does offer $7 valet, but I don&#39;t usually like valet. When my dinner is over I want to go, and not have to wait for my car to be brought to me.
         My bday group had ten people and we were seated in the back area away from the main dining room. The server was pretty cool. He handled us well. I had no idea what I wanted so I let him surprise me with soup- he picked Pasta fagioli which was pretty damn good I have to say! The soup had beans and pasta in it and other stuff I can&#39;t remember.  Just know it was good people! 
           I noticed  the menu had a  fish salad which has shrimp, calamari, squid, and white fish. I wanted that mix of seafood, but not in a salad which led me to my dinner choice, Zuppa di Pesce. I&#39;m not a salad as an entree kinda dude. The Zuppa di Pesce  is  an enormous dish. It was $32, and  well worth it. My pasta was EVERYTHING. When my fat ass is enjoying food I get all into it. In the zone. I was in my lane. On roadblock status tuning every b*tch out in the room that  said something to me lol! I was focused on my food! My pasta also had clams &amp; mussels unlike the salad. 
          I enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back. It&#39;s unfortunate  that Rosebuds has so many bad reviews  written by people that never even ate here!? #Fail  #GetItTogether  When I&#39;m dining out I want to know how my dining experience will be, not what went on with an employee that I have no knowledge of and don&#39;t know the whole story. #BusyBodies #FindSomethingBetterToDo

I usually don&#39;t like so much pasta with red sauce, but Rigattoni a la vodka, was amazing. I like to ask for fried calamari and grill calamari both are fine and Portions in general are ok.

I&#39;ve had better service and food at the Olive Garden.

While the food was fair and our waitress was average, (even though she didn&#39;t mention the specials, we found the list under the center piece) the brunette hostess had no personality and dropped our menus on our table before mumbling something and walked away. I asked her if we could get a booth ( yes we had reservations) and she looked me blankly, shrugged her shoulders and said they were all &#39;reserved&#39; then promptly turn away.
Additionally, it was way loud and crowded and I don&#39;t loud with energy, I mean loud with small children running around and people standing around in the entrance and tables way too close... 
If it wasn&#39;t for the apathetic hostess, it would have been okay but she really soured our impression before we were even seated; can&#39;t take that back.
Not going back here anytime soon."

When I saw the prices here for pasta I considered leaving and heading over to one of the cheaper Italian restaurants or pizza places in the area but decided that we&#39;d give Rosebuds a try.

I&#39;m glad we did.

Now look, I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m going to go here every week and it&#39;s my new favorite place ever. No. The prices are a bit too rich for my blood for pasta, one of the cheapest things on the planet. But. The food was delicious. The meatballs were large, moist, and seasoned perfectly. The sauce tasted fresh, with small chunks of tomatoes that burst with flavor when I bit into them. The pasta was obviously high quality.

My wife ordered a pizza and while it wasn&#39;t a Chicago-style deep dish delight, it was still seasoned well and obviously used high quality ingredients.

Our server was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. We couldn&#39;t have asked for anything more from him.

If you&#39;re looking for a treat night out, a nice date, or cost simply isn&#39;t an issue for you (you lucky dog), then I highly recommend going here. You won&#39;t regret it."

We had a table of 13, so we were placed in a private back room with another big group. The restaurant itself is very loud, but where we were seated, the volume level was very manageable.

I forgot to mention that the restaurant offers valet parking. I did not choose this because there&#39;s also a parking garage right across the street. The restaurant is located in the heart of downtown Naperville.

Our server, whose name is slipping me, was attentive and helpful. One of my coworkers said that the staff is usually really good, but I wasn&#39;t wowed by our service. Not that it was bad, but nothing great. My water was kept filled by various members of the staff, so I apprecited that.

The table ordered a few appetizers with our entrees. The eggplant rotolo and stuffed mushrooms were ordered on my half on the table, and my fellow diners were very satisfied with their choices. I decided to save room for my  main course by opting not to get an appetizer.

For my entree, I went with the Chicken Caccitore, which was a half broasted chicken in a tomato white wine sauce garnished with peppers, mushrooms, and olives. It was the first time I had ever had the dish, and I can&#39;t imagine any other place doing it better. The chicken was succulent, and the vegetables were sauteed to my liking (not too watery or firm). I&#39;m not a fan of olives, but I ate a few of them anyways. One of my codiners suggesteed that I dip some of the bread brought to the table in my leftover sauce... what a great idea! The sauce was more liquidy compared to your basic marinara. For 20 dollars, the amount of food given was pretty fair!

I also sampled a bite of the chicken parmesan, and that was good. I can&#39;t be that objective about the whole dish, but it was solid. As for the rest of the party, various dishes were ordered, and everyone had leftovers, except for me (sort of a badge of honor). Dishes that were ordered included Eggplant Parmesan, Chicken Vesuvio, Veal Marsala, and the baked Ziti. Everyone was very satisfed with their decisions.

We all skipped out on dessert, even though I wasn&#39;t full but that&#39;s the problem with always being hungry.

Overall, I was very satisfied with my experience. The restaurant was very accommodating and felt very warm. A bit pricey for my liking (I paid 28 dollars for my dish after tax and tip; 18 percent added for parties of 6 or more FYI), but I would definitely return."

Not sure if it&#39;s the kitchen or a bad waitress but our non-specialty order took way too long. I had to ask for another glass of wine and a plate to eat my pizza on, which was served on a metal tray. (So, an extra plate should have been a given.) The table across from us (an aunt and 9-year-old nephew) waited patiently for their pizza twice. When the restaurant messed up their order again for the second time, the patron nicely offered to pay for her drink and go because her nephew was just plain hungry by that point. The waitress actually took her card rather than apologizing and comping her the one measly drink. Really unreal. I guess the kitchen screws up repeatedly and the wait staff has to make do, but this waitress didn&#39;t do that well. Food was decent. Ambiance good sitting outside in downtown Naperville."

He, very dispassionately, told me that this was very typical and he did not understand why I was questioning it.  What if we recieved very poor service?

Twice out of four times one item was missing  and we only ordered a total of 3 dishes each time.

Tonight we ordered a Caesar Salad, mushroom appetizer and mussel appetizer for a total of $40.00 - not really inexpensive. The mushrooms and mussels were totally cold, mind you we only live about 5 minutes away and the Caesar Salad had not been included. We had paid by cash and when I called they gave me two options, come back and get it or get a credit for the next order. Barely an apology - it sounded like a routine happening that occurred all the time.

Well, we will still go to the restaurant to eat there - especially in the summer on their very pretty outdoor patio but NEVER EVER WILL WE ORDER CARRY OUT!!

Very good Americanized Italian food that to me, is on par with or maybe a little better than Maggiano&#39;s.

Calamari and Caesar salad were both good-salad in particular was the right mix of dressing (not too creamy), shredded parmesan, and the few anchovies on top were just right.

My one son ordered spaghetti with a meatball, and this meatball had to be what the kid&#39;s song is about-enormous-probably a pound.   Other dishes ordered were Chicken Parmesan-my older son&#39;s favorite-which was good, and Fettuccine Alfredo.   My meal was their baked ziti, which is the best of its kind around.

And I love them at a ridiculous level.  It is one of those special foods that I am always on the lookout for.  (Meatballs, ginger, potato pancakes, donuts, champagne cocktails, lamb and molasses cookies are on my YES list.)

Obviously there are going to be meatballs in an Italian restaurant but here&#39;s the thing, I am not that nuts about having spaghetti with them.  I just want to focus on the meatballs and they had such a great answer here - meatball salad!  Can you believe it because I could not.  It was salad on one side that was pretty ordinary, nothing at all special and on the other side two spectacular meatballs in red sauce.  I gobbled up those meatballs and left most of the salad.

Paired with a sparkling fresh iced tea it made for a darn good lunch.

The high point of our visit was our server, Laura K.  She was very personable and she was efficient without being intrusive.  The bussing was also very good.

The sauces on our entrees were on the watery side but the dishes still had good flavor, except for the side of pasta.  The marinara sauce was straight out of a can, i.e. not very good at all.  The coffee was borderline terrible.

True test? The gravy! Their red sauce is perfect. Not too salty, just thick enough. Lots of flavor. 

The cavatelli w/ sausage and broccolini is delicious. I stepped it up w/ arrabiatta sauce.

It was very busy and we were told we would have to wait, but when we spotted two open seats at the pizza bar, they were able to seat us there right away.  The pizza looked and smelled delicious so I had high hopes for our dinner.  

Normally this is the part where I get on my high horse about service but I&#39;ll begin instead with my complete disappointment with the food.  I ordered spaghetti and meatballs - if someone asked me &#34;what is your favorite food of all time?&#34; I would answer with Spaghetti and Meatballs each time.  The dish looked impressive but how could half a pound of pasta and nearly a pound of meatballs not look amazing?  The meatballs were tender but flavorless.  I probably could have gotten past that (and did eat the meatball because I was starving, having not eaten much all day in anticipation of a big Italian dinner) but the spaghetti sauce was just not good.  Spaghetti sauce should be deep red, rich, robust with herbs and garlic, thick enough to coat the pasta but not so thick that it weighs everything down.  The Rosebud spaghetti sauce was bland, weak, and loaded with cheese.  Even a generous sprinkling of salt was not able to save this dish.  My boyfriend - who rarely complains about food - had the cheese ravioli and the ravioli itself was good, but he said the same thing about the tomato sauce on his dish.

The service was not what I would expect in a place that charges $17 for spaghetti and meatballs.  As mentioned, it was busy in there but our waitress seemed exceptionally busy.  When she asked if I wanted a box (for a large portion of remaining spaghetti) and I said no, she should have asked if everything was okay, but she didn&#39;t.  

I like the chaotic ambiance of the restaurant, and loved sitting at the pizza bar because I got to watch them make pizzas and desserts, but otherwise the experience isn&#39;t one that bears repeating."

We originally wanted to go to the nearby Mangolian grill, but the wait there was 40 minutes.  We just walked in the downtown and came to Rosebud.  There was no wait for a table and we decided to have dinner there.  It was a wrong decision, should have waited for our first choice.

I asked our server if he recommended any appetizer and he suggested Scampi Limone - it was way too salty.  The dish should come with a disclaimer that anyone with blood pressure should not order it!!

We also ordered Stuffed mushrooms, which were ok.  They were edible and I&#39;ve had much better in other places.

Eggplant parmesan was better than the other two dishes, but not the best.

Considering the price we paid for our food, the place was a let down."

Parking is difficult on a Saturday night (7 pm). It is in a small strip mall with a Five Guys and Jamba juice, I think. Bottom-line, the lot was hilarious - trying to maneuver an extra long Ford Expedition in it. There is a lot across the street but also very busy in downtown Naperville on a Saturday evening.

They sat us at a large (makeshift) table next to the window at the front of the restaurant, which by the way is on the small side, and it worked but it was tight. The noise level in this restaurant was the challenge and not appreciated. It was just super busy with lots of large parties. A few got a headache during the long meal (server and busboys great--it was just really busy, so with appys, meals, and dessert, it was 2.5 hrs). A couple of us had a noise hangover the next morning.

The above issues dropped the rating to a 3. With a good server, and busboys, the food was excellent (5 rating). The calamari (fried not the grilled one-we had that too, just wasn&#39;t as good) and the seafood salad (lots of seafood, well prepared, light dressing on greens) were the absolute rage during the appetizer round.

The mains were awesome too. The kids loved their various pastas and pizzas. The adults enjoyed the homemade gnocchi, eggplant salad, and chicken vesuvio.

The tiramisus were shared and coffee was enjoyed by all even though were stuffed."

But whenever I come back here, I am completely satisfied every time.

Really comfy, cozy place for a wintertime meal. The last time we went, we were celebrating a friend&#39;s promotion over a quiet dinner. Our table for four wasn&#39;t cramped at all, despite it being a Friday night and the place being totally busy. They had candles lit everywhere, perfect for a romantic evening or a nice dinner. I know the place isn&#39;t glam or anything, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend bringing a hoard of kids here, it really seems upscale without shoving it in your face (if that makes sense). Basically, I can show up here in jeans without feeling stupid, but still feel like I&#39;m at a really nice restaurant. 

Cavatappi ala Rosebud all the way. I basically never get anything else. I wish I could talk about other items, to a full extent...I love the green beans in the dish, it mixes the plate up a bit. The cavatappi is soft and and sauce is creamy, so the crunchy green beans are a welcome diversion. The gnocchi our friends shared was really good too, I definitely told myself I would order that next time.

They have your standard lasagna, pizza, chicken parm, veal...but I like that they have things on the menu that are a little bit different too. The menu is generally the same every time too, unlike La Sorella di Francesca around the corner (menu constantly changing). I like to try new, seasonal items, but its nice to know that your favorites will still be there when you go to visit (I&#39;m still grieving the loss of a ravioli dish from La Sorella that never returned, why can&#39;t it just be a regular menu item?). 

Basically, if you like Italian food, this place will meet/exceed your expectations. My only recommendation is that you don&#39;t bring a ton of kids...there isn&#39;t a bunch of space and it just isn&#39;t that kind of atmosphere."

I was under the impression that if you are asked to try a restaurant again, they will do something a little over the top. The manager greeted me on his way out and told me our waiter would take care of our table. The waiter was a nice guy but the food was still just ok. 305 dollars later, of which about 50 dollars was an 18 percent tip that was added for me, I will never again fall for the come back and try us line."

When Rosebud in Naperville was located further down Chicago Avenue on the corner of Main Street, I did not think much of it. Since they&#39;ve been in this new location I bring my family there or get a carry out at least once a week.they&#39;ve always been very accommodating and eager to please. Even when we had our three-year-old son with us,they would always get us a nice table.everything on the menu is delicious, but I highly recommend two items: Grandmas Gravy- tender beef tipsin the tastiest red sauce you&#39;ve ever had.  The only thing on the menu that&#39;s part of the net is the chicken piccata - chicken breasts lightly sautéed in an egg batter with lemon butter sauce and capers... Mouth watering good. The atmosphere is fun and inviting. You won&#39;t be disappointed."

However, we were relatively pleased.

It&#39;s darker inside, presenting a nice romantic ambiance. The noise level is high, but I prefer this over a whispering setting where everyone can hear you talking. Not a fan of the red and white checkered table cloths, but who cares.

Arrived slightly early for our reservations but were promptly seated. We skipped appetizers as we had a full night of food restaurants lined up. The bread they serve you was warm and soft - I wish there was more olive oil and parmesan for dipping though, not a big deal though. I ordered the 8-finger cavatelli pasta and my boyfriend ordered the fusilli carbonara. Mine was FULL of flavor - garlic, parmesan, crumbled italian sausage, brocollini - yummy. The sauce was olive oil based which I misread on the menu - it was little thin for my usual liking but it was still delicious. His pasta lacked flavor to the sauce - typical alfredo sauce that was missing that extra punch of flavor. Maybe some garlic or onion to kick it up a notch? The prosciutto and mushrooms were paired very well, and overall a good dish.

Next time we come back we are trying out the stuffed mushrooms that we were eyeing at the next table over."

We were in a car accident today at the intersection where Rosebuds is located. Two staff members came out to check on us, and the children who were in our car. They offered lemonade, water, crayons, coloring paper, and were more than willing to assist in any way. We were able to use their outdoor seating as we waited for police to arrive on scene.

This act of kindness, alone, warrants 5 stars. And, we will absolutely be heading over to Rosebud&#39;s soon to check out what they have....we already know the people are GREAT!!!"

Our server was Lorenzo.  He was very nice,  and professional. 
We started with soup.  My husband had the minestrone,  and I had the pasta fagioli.   We both enjoyed our soups.

I ordered the veal franceses, and my husband had the chicken marsala.  Wonderful!!

Oh, but we have to have dessert! !
I had the Cannoli cake...
The biggest wedge I&#39;ve ever seen! 

My husband had the Tiramisu. ..
Both were fabulous. 

We loved our celebration dinner. And then I found out about the young delivery driver with cancer, that lost his job, because he had to undergo treatment. .

She started out by spilling water when she filled our glasses on not only the table, but my hat.  And she completely was unaware of it, and never even bothered to wipe the table.  After we ordered she picked up the menus which apparently had some kind of debris on them which promptly fell into the olive oil/parmesan cheese they serve with the bread.  So I was ready to hate this place.  But the food saved us.  It was really quite good.  The price was inexpensive and in the end the waitress was so nice it was hard to hate on her.  She was so bad it was funny. I am not in downtown Naperville very often, but I would go back again if the opportunity presented itself."

Much smaller, tables much closer together, and the noise level has greatly increased.  The good news, the configuration is no longer a maze.

The bread was served hot for the first portion.  The second portion, or refill, was not served hot.  No butter on the table only things for dipping and it&#39;s a community plate.

Our salads came out quickly, but our entrees took an unusually long time.  Several tables that arrived after us got their food before we did.  I had the chicken picatta, which was good, but not the best I ever had.  However, the assortment of gelato and sorbet, which was not what we expected when we ordered vanilla gelato, was very good as were the coffee and espresso.

We were there early on a Sunday evening and it filled up while we were there.

Chris was our server and he did a great job.  I never had to ask for a refill of my ice water and he came back to check on us frequently."

We went with a large group to celebrate the holiday&#39;s, as we have for the past five years.   Not any more.  Apparently they have new management, along with a new event coordinator.  Traditionally we have the back room to ourselves to avoid any congestion.  This year, they had two other tables in the back room with our party of 20.  Needless to say, it was very crowded and busy.  Meanwhile, the food was served family style and the quality and quantity of the portions have gone downhill drastically.  WAY OVERPRICED for the quality and quantity.  To top it off, for no particular reason, the manager decided to call the police on our group over something that never occurred, because a waitress heard something that was completely false.

The ambience was good but the service was terrible. Our waitress did not once smile from the moment we walked in. One of the couples got some entree and requested it to be made without sausage. But they got a piece of sausage in their food. When we let our waitress know about it she said &#34;oh&#34; and picked up the plate and took it to the back. No apology or anything. Not once was our water refilled until we had to ask the manager.

The rest of the food was bland. &#34;Ok&#34; at best. 

The manager, Rich, did a great job of making us feel more welcome after the sausage mishap. He apologized for the way the waitress was treating us and took care of our appetizers as well. 

Giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because of Rich."

Had Stuffed Mushrooms for Appetizers. Tasted great, needed a little more seasoning.
Tried out their Specialty Pasta &#39;Cavatelli Alla Rosebud&#39;. Deeeelicious. 
Not so happy with the deserts. I tried their house special &#39;Rosebud Lime Donuts&#39;. They were huge but the taste didn&#39;t have that lemony Zest I was expecting. 

The Ambiance was very nice. They have a section to the corner/back for couples,It was intimate, quite without any TV playing sports.

The service was Awesome. We were helped by two servers and they were very friendly to go through the menu and suggest options. Tag Team. :)

It&#39;s basically the best $10 you can spend on a Monday, as the amount of food you get is simply ridiculous. If you manage to power through your first massive bowl of spaghetti (and two giant meatballs) they&#39;ll just keep it coming. Also, unlike a lot of all you can eat deals, they&#39;re totally down with you finishing your first bowl, getting a refill, and just taking that all home. It&#39;s GOOD spaghetti too, with sauce that you can tell they make from scratch as each week there&#39;s mild flavor variations and the same can be said for the meatballs.

I am new to Lisle, but I hope I can find better Italian elsewhere. First, it took several minutes after sitting down for someone to bring us water. It came with the bread. The bread was great, but I was thirsty. Second, the food was good but not great. It was pretty bland. For the price, I expect much better and can get it other places. Third, there were pieces of plastic in my food. I didn&#39;t say anything at the time because I seriously thought maybe my fillings were coming out or something, but I haven&#39;t had any problems since, so it seems likely that it was Rosebud.

They still have many of the old &#34;traditional&#34; italian dishes but they also have some new more contemporary menu items as well. We had reservations the place was packed and we could not even get close to the bar for a drink, to add insult to injury our table was not ready for over 30 minutes after our reservation time and we even arrived to check in early so we were just standing there for about 40 minutes. As for the meal, it was excelent Our waitress was great, friendly and on the ball even though she was swamped with tables. 

Summary, great food, good service, comfortable dining room but the reservation delay and not having access to the bar while we waited was a bit of a let down. They need to address this problem or have a cocktail waitress running drinks to waiting guests that can not get up to the tiny bar, they would see an instant spike in weekend revenue if they took this approach, not sure why management has not thought of this???

I will go back because the food is excellent."

You will pay a lot per dish but the portion sizes are far too big! You will go home with leftovers I promise. Their red sauce is amazing. You can taste the basil and garlic in it. Not too crazy about its atmosphere and location. Used to be located on the riverwalk and they had balconey seating over the water. It was quiet and romantic...then it burned down after an oven fire.

They were playing Top 40&#39;s pop music the entire time we were there. Not that I don&#39;t love Lady Gaga, but I found the music constantly distracting considering that we were eating pricey Italian food at a romantic-looking restaurant with valet parking.  Maybe that was just an opening night thing, but still!

The eggplant parmesan ($15) lacked texture--not even a hint of crispiness.  Worse, it tasted overwhelmingly like egg. I mean, if I were blindfolded I would&#39;ve thought I&#39;d just bitten into a plain omelet. The stuffed mushrooms ($12) were tasty though.

The service was good most of the night, although our waitress made a huge display of surprise (and disgust?) when we mentioned maybe ordering dessert after our meal (two appetizers, two entrees and a side, some of which we were were bringing home--nothing outrageous). It struck me as somewhat insulting.

When I got home and opened up my carry-out container of broccolini ($6), I found a genital hair nestled into one of the broccolini heads. WTF.


P.S. If you&#39;re looking for a classy Italian chain, I suggest Maggiano&#39;s, which serves similar food at high quality while charging less. ($9 for stuffed mushrooms, $13 for eggplant parmesan and $4 for a side of broccolini.)"

They really made every extra effort to please us and it worked. I was really impressed with how good the food was. The drinks were refilled and we never had to ask for anything extra because it was all taken care of. 

This is a great place for dinner or just for drinks. You&#39;ll like it!"

Not many other customers at the time. Food was decent, flavors average and kids liked the ravioli.  Would probably not return as I could cook the same foods at home."

They gave me food poisoning and when I called to discuss it, I was yelled at like I was lying about it.  Why would I lie about food poisoning?  To get a free pizza?  I have $4 pizzas down the street from me.  Ermil is a real jerk and is making a point about not calling soon enough.  If throwing up on my birthday, missing work, and having diharrea for two days straight isn&#39;t food poisoning, then I&#39;m not sure what is.  Calling right after, or a few days after has no impact on the claim that his food made me sick.

Needless to say it was very busy. We were greeted by the hostess and waited about 15 min at the bar. The bartender was busy with a teen birthday party in their party room. So he never asked us if we wanted a drink. This was the reason i didn&#39;t give 5 stars.
We ordered drinks from their extensive wine list. 
And an appetizer. 
Dinner here was amazing. The food was delicious. She ordered the chicken vesuvio and i had the veal cutlet in butter sauce. 
The dessert menu offered many delicious choices. I opted for spumoni in a chocolate cup. She had the flour-less chocolate cake. 
At almost two and a half hours for dinner was a tad long. It was well worth it. I will definitely be returning here soon."

Chicken Parmesan, lemon chicken, four types of pasta, and so much bread. So when our friends invited us to a tiny little Italian place in Addison a couple of weeks ago, I wasn&#39;t expecting much.

I couldn&#39;t have been more wrong - this place was fantastic! The menu is huge and varied, the specials were exciting and different, and the service was incredible. Our waiter offered several off-menu combinations as suggestions, which I thought was a fantastic touch. I&#39;m normally wary of servers who don&#39;t ever write a single thing down, but this guy was smart, funny, patient, put us right at ease, and made the whole experience great.

The interior is kind of dark and cheesy, but the seating was fine. We got sat in a corner and we were able to talk quietly and enjoy the company of our friends without the standard hustle and bustle that makes typical Italian restaurants so loud and hectic.

I got the lobster ravioli, which came with a saffron cream sauce. Typically saffron + cream = massive heavy food coma, but this was delicate and subtle. The ravioli had a robust sweet lobster flavor and were packed full. There were six ravioli on my plate and I was stuffed.

We will definitely be back to indulge in too much wine, delicious decadent food, and perfect service. What a hidden gem in Addison!"

None of us had ever been before. They are doing construction to the exterior of this building and those surrounding it so it&#39;s easy to miss. I hope construction finishes soon b/c everyone needs to find and try this amazing Italian spot!

We came on the early side on a Friday and were seated right away. Our server greeted us and took our drink orders. Another server brought bread, oil, and cheese to the table. Their bread is soft and delicious, and I had to make myself resist having more than one piece. All our meals came with soup or salad. I got their cheddar broccoli which was good without being too creamy/cheesy. For my entree, I got their Tortellini Pasticciata which is cheese tortellini with ham, peas, mushrooms, tomatoes and mozz on top (no mushrooms for me though). Dad got chicken vesuvio and bf got a pizza w smoked salmon, mozz, and tomatoes. First of all, my dish was HUGE. The three of us easily could have split it, but I was happy to have the leftovers. It was incredible - rich and cheesy without being over the top. The other two were very happy with their choices as well. I wanted dessert but unfortunately had no room. 

I will definitely be back. My dad passes Nuova Italia on his drive home from work so I told him he needs to start getting carryout on a weekly basis.....fingers crossed!"

The warm tomato focaccia bread was the perfect start to our lengthy lunch. We caused the lengthiness which may be part of why this is not my new favorite restaurant. One of the members of our party needed to step out, but this was right after we ordered. So, we asked them not to put in the order until he returned. They agreed and then brought out the soup and salad. There was some confusion, so we sent it back. 

My water glass was never empty which I appreciated because the restaurant was practically empty, so they were pretty attentive.  When we were ready, the salad that was supposed to be lightly dressed was dripping in dressing. Thankfully, they willingly brought a fresh salad with the dressing on the side. The beef barley soup was different. It looked like a chicken broth base as far as the color was concerned. There was no real beef flavor to be found. There was a couple small pieces of beef, but the soup was too greasy. I didn&#39;t love it. 

My hubby had the calamari spaghetti. This was quite tasty and had a nice spicy tomato sauce!  I went with the chicken vesuvio. The chicken breasts were seasoned nicely and the sauce was pretty good (although maybe a little too salty for the average bear), but the potatoes were not worth the calories. They were not fresh and that annoyed me. There was a beautiful whole fish presentation at the table. Then the fish was cleaned and served. Unfortunately, the bones were heavily prevalent throughout the dish once it was served. 

To wrap up the meal, we had a piece of tiramisu. This WAS worth the calories. I ate more than my fair share and it made the meal!  I will probably go back because my husband was there a couple weeks before and loved the risotto, but I will try all different dishes to see if I can find what they do best."

He told the bus boy and waitress (who was very apologetic). As if that wasn&#39;t bad enough, when his pasta came out there was a hair in his first bite. He didn&#39;t eat the pasta and again let the waitress know. When the bill came, we expected his meal to be taken off. Well it wasnt!! The manager told us he was not taking the meal off and instead would only take his beverage off (a $2 ice tea).

After viewing the room, selecting a menu, and confirming the date and time for the banquet, we thought we would be in good hands. Unfortunately, this was not the case. We arrived at the restaurant after the cemetery to an empty restaurant and locked doors. We tried calling the nnber on the sign, but there was no answer.  We were stuck in the cold, after spending the day saying goodbye to ouour loved one.

For dinner, I had the chicken florentine with spinach, roasted red pepper, and melted mozzerella on top. REALLY good. Hubby had something off the menu but was changed a little. Salmon with a lemon butter sauce and linguine which he liked. We finished with a slice of tiramisu. It wasn&#39;t anything different from any other italian restaurant.

The food options were impressive and hard to choose from, you just wish you could sample everything in one sitting. The Specials of the day just added to the excitement of what to have, knowing that it was going to be good before you even tasted it. Very descriptive and the wait staff was impeccable in making suggestions, helping you to decide what you should try from soup and salad, to appetizer and entree. The beer was extra cold and the bread served was warm and savory. I wish I could eat there daily, but no one wants to work off that many calories on a daily basis, but perhaps would be worth the trade off. 

The restaurant is in an unpretentious location, almost a older strip mall that can be missed, especially during rush hour traffic. I promise you it&#39;s worth the trip and the decor is warm and welcoming on the inside an opposite reflection of what you see on the outside. This is an experience to have and the passion of the waitstaff and chef shines with their extensive knowledge and poetic descriptions of the food.

This is maybe the 4th or 5th restaurant in the same place, which more than doubled in size sometime back there in the 80s or 90s. The dining room is very nice, dark wood, but enough light to make it seem elegant, not dark.  The service was casual.  That is to say we told the server that we were in no hurry, and needed to unwind and chatter, and he took our cue and didn&#39;t rush us at all, yet he was always there when we needed him.  We started with an antipasto platter which was amply sized for two, and was comprised of the usual fresh ingredients, very nice. My dinner companion had a green salad, and I had soup.  Aside from the mandatory Minestrone, the choice was clam chowder, &#34;Red clam chowder,&#34; the server said, &#34;Boston.&#34;  I favor Manhattan chowder over the creamy New England style, and I was sure that was what he meant.  But this was spicier than any I&#39;d had before, not exacltly like Manhattan style, but delicious. Maybe there really is a 
Boston style clam chowder.   My favorite Italian restaurant fare is Chicken Vesuvio and this did not disappoint, was perhaps the best version of this dish I&#39;ve had.  The chicken breasts were very tender, yet flavorful. mzy friend ordered a dish from the sizable specials menu, beef braciole.  He said it was amazing, and I&#39;m certain it was.

It has never on my radar as a place to try. Tonight we were headed to a near by Mexican restaurant that had an hour wait so we decided to forgo that and stop at Nuova instead.  What a pleasant, unexpected surprise.  The service and food were  great.  The grilled calamari (recommended by the waiter) was the best we have ever had.  Would go back again just for that!.  Our group had the Chicken Vesuvio, Braciole, and Seafood Stew.  Each dish was delicious.  My 4 star instead of 5 star rating is based on the fact that our salads were limp and soggy because they were so drenched in balsamic/oil dressing, there were lantern type candles on the tables but none were lit so the dining room was quite dark.  We recommend Nuova and look forward to returning."

The service was great and the food was some of the best Italian around.  The rigatoni boscaiola was fantastic and their special duck cavatelli with procini mushrooms in a marsala cream sauce was outstanding.  While the duck pasta was a special, our server said they have similar specials all the time and can make any pasta with any sauce per request.  The only negative remark for our night was that the woodfired pizza came out almost 10 minutes after all the other entrees.  No big deal in the end.  We all loved this place and can&#39;t wait to come back!"

If there were a more than 5 star option, I would have enthusiastically given it to them. We were there early on a Friday night (5pm), no wait. Atmosphere is upscale and cozy. We had just drove 16 hours and came straight here as I had been here in the past.....so for anyone to say they were &#34;snubbed&#34; for any reason, I would have to completely disagree. We rolled up in there hungry, smiling, tired with yoga pants on, hair in a bun and they still treated us like regulars!!!
Service was fantastic throughout the entire meal. The host that sat us explained in detail (to the point we were almost drooling) about any of the menu items that we were inquisitive about and even offered his suggestions based on what we were thinking of ordering. 
Bread: it&#39;s bread, it&#39;s always good
App: Caprese Bufala which was on the printed &#34;specials&#34; menu. This dish was absolutely fantastic! We ate every last bite!
Salad: iceberg, romaine, spinach topped with a mouth watering balsamic vinaigrette, there was also a soup choice but we both got the salad
Main dish #1: Rigatoni Boscaiola. This was so awesome, this was my friends entree and I couldn&#39;t stop eating hers!!!! Someone at the table HAS to get this!!!
Main dish #2: Meat Ravioli &#34;special&#34; menu, this was still delicious, but not as good as my friends.
Dessert: couldn&#39;t fit it, we both took our leftover pasta home
Price was right. I would go here once a week just to try something new as it is hard to decide what to have.
Thank you!"

Yes, we&#39;re new to your establishment, etc, etc, but come on!  Whatever was going on in that place, I felt totally discriminated against.  BTW, all the below are just choice highlights, cataloging the entire experience makes for a waaay overlong review.

15 minutes to get a menu.  Water came later.  Waiter just came to take our order.  After taking care of, going over all the specials, AND serving an appetizer to the adjacent couple who came in AFTER us.  WTF?

Well, we consoled ourselves, based on the other Yelpers, the food will be great, at least.  WTF?  The wine was vinegary.  The salad was so wilted and looked like it had been sitting around for a week (of course he only brought out one salad and forgot the other), stale bread.  Lame tasteless crap with watery sauce - people, I&#39;m sure this food was great 50 years ago, when no-one knew better, but, hello!, have you heard of sauce reduction, spices, herbs?  Two stars for the decor - remodeled, nice, the pizza was decent, and the pasta was ok, it was al dente.  Everything was so oversalted, we got our sodium intake for the year.

We were very nice and polite, and tipped 20%, because, as usual, we&#39;re not interested in scenes or complaining.  We just don&#39;t roll that way, even when we should.  OTOH I ran a very entertaining commentary on facebook, and our friends&#39; hilarity and instant responses to our pain while we sat there saved the evening.  And now Yelp.  I feel better.

We will NEVER come back."

The food was above average except the oysters which I found to be small without a lot of flavor.  The problem with the place is the atmosphere/ layout/ decor.  They have a whole mirrored wall on one end of the dining area which I found strange.  The room is laid out so you can here everyone talking and there is no music in the bar area.

We ordered our meal off of the specials menu.  First we had the Oysters Rockefeller.  The oysters we okay.  Nothing special, rather bland tasting.  Followed by salads.  The balsamic vinaigrette dressing was wonderful.  Unfortunately I do not remember the names of the meals that we ate.  The waiter described my husband&#39;s meal as an Italian Beef Stroganoff with a very light wine sauce.  We should have listened better to the description.  The meal had a VERY light wine sauce.  It was good, but not as much flavor as we had hoped.  My meal on the other hand was absolutely wonderful. The waiter described my meal as a lasagna noodle with spinach, ricotta cheese and mozzarella cheese with a vodka sauce.  The vodka sauce was so delicious.  The portions were a generous size so we were each able take some home.  I even told my husband not to eat my leftovers because I wanted to enjoy it for lunch the next day.   I was so disappointed when I went to eat my lunch the next day and discovered the vodka sauce was not put into the take-home container. I wish I could have put my own leftovers into the container.  The best part of my meal and it was omitted from the take-home container."

What an awesome find!  This restaurant, tucked in a non-descript strip mall off of Lake Street, is easy to miss and has been the site of several Italian restaurants.  I pass by here frequently as it&#39;s right on the way to the local Caputo&#39;s produce store.  

After hearing the buzz about this place from a couple of friends, one of who hails from Italy, we stopped in last night for a late dinner.  The place was empty (around 9:30), but the bartender/server was absolutely solicitious and helpful.  

Here&#39;s a great tip about this restaurant: go for the specials if possible.  Now I did not order anything on the regular menu, which was fairly interesting and comprehensive for an Italian restaurant; and I&#39;m sure that their regular entrees were good.  But the specials - very unique and have to be tried!

We were going to order a buffala mozzarella caprese, but the server advised us to try another special cheese from the Apuglia region of Italy - apparently difficult to get in this country but the chef imports it in.  The cheese, burrata, is a pouch of bufala mozzarella, filled with panna (cream).  Served over a bed of fresh, delicious arugula, with a very thin slice of parma prosciutto, this is an absolutely orgasmic dish - simple combination of wonderfully fresh ingredients!

As the server recited the specials, it was apparent that they do unique food - rabbit, goat, quail, unique fish - all can be found on their specials menu.  In fact, the server told us that if you are planning on coming in on the weekend, just call them and let them know what you want - they&#39;ll make sure it&#39;s ready for you!  Kind of like eating at your Italian grandma&#39;s house!

We opted for the quail, done spectacularly in a demi-glace sauce; and an orata fish, which is a seabream fish common to the Bari region (where my gramps hails from!).  Baked whole with rosemary and olive oil, it was to die for.

They also make an &#34;almost&#34; authentic version of Italian pizza - delish!

Great selection of Italian wines and they carrry the Danny DeVito limoncello as well.

They&#39;ve also got these storage bins, located in a large cabinet on the wall of one of the dining areas, that you can rent to store your favorite wine selections, all available at a discounted price.  So you can go there with clients, start a bottle of wine, and then they&#39;ll store your unused portion in your bin to be used on another occasion.

I&#39;d give it 5 stars but I want to try it again before I do that.  

Prices - specials are not cheap but not bad for the unique quality of food.  Menu prices are fairly reasonable. Pastas start around $14 and entrees can go upwards to $30.  The high end of the price range is for the more unique specials, though.

Atmosphere:  it was pretty quiet when we were there, although the bar filled up with a couple of people.  Honestly, I loved the place - the owners and bartender were cool, full of information, and very friendly. They definitely take pride in their food and in their establishment.  

Give it a try - it&#39;s a hidden gem that I hope does well."

Excellent grilled calamari and vegetables, a healthy alternative to the usual deep fried calamari with marinara. Our 2 1/2 year old son loved it too.  We ordered 2 pizzas for the three of us, with appetizer, and the pizzas were larger than we expected.  Simply made, thin crust and not excessively salty as pizza usually is.  The ingredients were so flavorful and high quality! This is our new #1 wood oven pizza place. I should add that my husband  and I have been on a cross country quest for the best wood oven pizza as an on-going hobby (he has a big green egg and often experiments himself).

I will say when we drove up, we didn&#39;t know what we would be in for. The restaraunt is in a tired strip mall off Lake Street.  The lobby area smelled vaguely of the old cigarette smoking days no longer allowed... seemed to need a freshening up.

This is a fantastic find, friendly people and unpretentious, authentic good food. We can&#39;t wait to go back and try the meals everyone else is raving about. We can&#39;t pass up the pizza, though! I would not order it to go - best eaten right there."

Let me start out by saying that the service was the best!! Our waiter was very helpful and accommodating. We were told what the special appetizers were for the day and we decided on the stuffed artichoke. I was really expecting something great for close to $10 but this was a huge disappointment. It had no flavor in the bread crumb stuffing and it was served in some kind of milky looking sauce. Hubby had lasagna and really all you could see was an orange looking sauce drenched on the plate and lots of melted cheese. You had to kind of dig thru it to find the actual lasagna and it was according to him just okay. I had the chicken vesuvio. When did Italian restaurants all start using boneless chicken breasts instead of pieces of chicken in their vesuvio? The chicken really did not have a lot going for it but the sauce over the chicken and on the plate and potatoes was really, really good. 

Just so-so. We will not go back."

When you pull into the plaza where this gem sits your first thought is that perhaps a wonderful Italian restaurant would not be located here.  From the outside you are still not sold.  When you walk in however, you are greeted by friendly staff and then served by a waiter who is probably one of the best in the business.  I never got his name but you will know him as he is pretty much the only waiter in this 12-15 table establishment.  This man knows everything about anything at Nuova.  You can eat and drink with confidence as he will guide you through whatever it is your heart and stomach desire.  I&#39;m not a big wine fan but wanted a glass of red.  He asked whether or not I liked dry and I said yes.  He brought me an amazing glass of I don&#39;t know what but it was perfect and inexpensive.  We tried the pizza an we&#39;re not disappointed.  It was so light and fresh that I could have been satisfied at that.  Oh, and the warm bread including focaccia was outstanding.  For our mains we had the fresh, homemade ravioli made in the shape of won tons with vodka sauce.  It literally melted in my mouth.  The other main was a rigatoni with sausage and mushrooms in a cream sauce.  Our of this world fresh and al dente perfection.  Our amazing waiter explained to us that they can make pretty much anything else that is not on the menu.  We were so full that we did not do dessert but I can only imagine how great that would have been.  In closing, I want to go back in that kitchen and hug whoever is back there because he/she has really set the standard for excellence and freshness in Italian dining.  Finally, the waiter is the best.  If any five star, exclusive, fancy restaurant ever got a hold of this man they would immediately be better off.  I hope he never leaves because Nuova Italia is complete with him running the show!"

After passing this place for over 3 years, I finally stopped in and sat out side. When sitting outside, you face west....pretty sunsets are a nice bonus. 

Met Gene the owner, great host. He&#39;s a pro. 

I didn&#39;t order much, but what I did have was quite good. I would have given 5 stars but my tuna and Tako were warm, and should have been cold.

Have had problems finding anything decent near naperville. And today I was happily surprised. Food was good, and the fish temp was correct. Really great looking hamachi (not that pink stringy garbage other sushi bars are slinging) and tasty kani (real king crab). And yea it&#39;s expensive like city prices but having eaten at 95% of those city places, I was happy with my food. I will say the service was a little slow. But the food was good enough to make up for that little glitch and I was in no hurry. So if you&#39;re looking for good sushi and you truly know quality fish rather than silly trendy rolls, I&#39;ve found this and nabuki in hinsdale. And that&#39;s about it. Hope this helps.

 After three times, the first was great, the second barely acceptable, and finally on the third visit, I will never go back. Dried up OLD fish and a server that wanted to debate the DISGUSTING looking fish by attempting to school me on the &#34;different cuts&#34; - a total crock o sh!t. Any self respecting business would have taken the miserable looking OLD fish back without a word. But not this time. Now I&#39;m the bad guy cause you got called out on serving GARBAGE. $125 later, thanks but no thanks wild tuna."

I would have given this place 4 stars the first visit and down to 1 star our very last visit.

The fish quality has declined in the times we came here, which is a shame.  I remember the first few times finding it fresh and tasty (unlike what I had been getting in Green Bay, WI).  I am not sure if my palette was changing or the fish was getting worse, but something changed.

Even the service quality changed.  When we first came, the servers were friendly and accommodating, even the owner came over and asked how were things.  The last time we were there, the server told us we don&#39;t know what good tuna looks like (pale, dull pink tuna is his idea of fresh) and was told that we either eat it or we don&#39;t, but either way we had to pay for it.  That was the last straw for us.  I have been to a lot of places, but I never had someone be so bold to tell us that.  

I want to be fair in my rating, so I have taken account all the visits there.  But honestly, if I had to give my recommendation, I would say to find another place."

It was not difficult to tell from its taste and appearance that the fish I was served had either been kept for too long, or was not stored properly. The rice is nothing to write home about either, and I found it atrocious that I was served a watery side salad that tasted like it came out of a plastic bag. On the bright side, I did enjoy the tako (octopus). But I doubt this place would hold its own in a city where people can afford to be more selective about their raw fish. And despite that, they&#39;re charging big city prices.

I think Wild Tuna seems to rely more on crowd-pleasers like specialty rolls, fried foods, etc. as well as friendly service at the sushi bar itself (avoid the table service). Their menu is varied so you don&#39;t have to be a big fan of sushi to get a decent meal here."

Plus, Gene is so sweet and even introduced us to one of his other regulars when he found out we had something in common.  It&#39;s THAT kind of place.

The hamachi kama is AMAZING and may or may not be on menu.  Ask for it and see what he has back there.  I love getting it with a side of rice.

It was a lazy Saturday and we packed up the family roadster and trucked out to Naperville in search of an elusive superior sushi experience. 

It was 3 p.m. all the adults involved were sporting hangovers and the desire for raw fish.
The lone child was hopped up on placating sugar.

Hopes and desires were high, we had heard stories of the &#34;Wild Tuna experience&#34; and we were hungry.

We sat with little formality or encouragement and ate average, at best, sushi.

We had some rolls, some sashimi and maki, it was all OK.

Not worth a drive  if you live outside Naperville though, which is not a diss; you can throw a rock and hit a good sushi joint out in the suburbs these days.

My family likes coming here when us kids are in town. Overall, the prices are pretty reasonable. Never order rolls, they&#39;re pretty much gimmicky moneymakers for restaurants. If you really like sushi for the fish, I would stay away from any rolls that are $10 or more. Kind of ridiculous since they&#39;re mostly sauce and cooked things.

The fish is relatively fresh. If you want to order something other than tuna or salmon, try the saba (mackerel). It&#39;s slightly cooked and has a stronger taste, but very good in nigiri.

The softshell crab appetizer is great! Wish they would leave the stomach in since it adds a stronger crab flavor, but its nicely dressed with a ginger dressing. Don&#39;t get the softshell crab roll; it costs more and has less crab.

This is hands down the best sushi in the Naperville area, for my money. 

We went on New Year&#39;s Eve, so in contrast to our last visit it was definitely hopping. We started with drinks -- mojito for him, which he really enjoyed; an individual bottle of champagne for me (New Year&#39;s!), which the waiter popped with subtle flair tableside. 

We ordered several rounds of sashimi and sushi. Of the sashimi, the definite favorite were the scallops, which literally melted in  your mouth. I have never had better. We also had yellowtail and salmon, but after those scallops they could not compare. 

We had a number of rolls, the standout again being the Patty&#39;s Crabby, as last time: spicy crab and king crab. You will not be crabby after eating this, I guarantee. 

Other rolls we partook in included the Godzilla Maki, Spicy Tuna Maki, Spider Maki,  Shiitaki Mushroom Tempura Maki, and special Torched Scallop Maki (wherein thin slices of those delicious scallops were laid over a roll and then hit with the propane torch à la creme brulée). I wouldn&#39;t kick any of them off my plate, let me tell you. 

Service was unbotrusive and polite, though it was hard on one occasion to catch the eye of our waiter when we were ready to order another round; he kept blowing past and attending to other tables but not glancing our way. 
The decor is sleek and modern, a special setting for a nice night out.

The waiter was fast and excellent suggestions for us... We ordered four rolls with some sashimi and filled us up to the brim.  

The drinks were excellent as I got a martini and my BF got a glass of whiskey.

I figured that they would just refund me the $5.99 fee or give me a soda or two. 

I got to the restaurant maybe 15 mins after placing the order and the owner blew up on me and said that I am scamming him and that they don&#39;t use grub hub. I tried showing him the receipt I received via email from grub hub confirming my order but he refused to look at it and began to insult me. He was calling me stupid and that I was scamming him and he told me to even leave the restaurant!

After calming him down I finally received my 3 rolls which at that point I didn&#39;t even want anymore! 

The food is alright but the service is hands down horrible. The owner should know what websites his food can be ordered from rather than calling a customer &#34;stupid&#34; and &#34;typical american&#34;."

Everything about this place is great, it&#39;s always where me and my mom end up when we go out together. The outside looks a little funny but the inside is absolutely adorable, you could totally make this place casual lunch or date night. They have a bar separate from the dinner tables and a sushi bar as well. The sushi here is always fresh!! They don&#39;t have many tempura options which is kind of a bummer because that&#39;s my favorite but definitely worth to check this place out. The service is also out of this world! They really care about you here and will give you the greatest service possible."

Gene, Lena, Susan and the entire crew have always given me fantastic service. I have brought and referred dozens of people here and none have been disappointed. I have been coming to Wild Tuna at least two times a month for 4+ years and every experience is great.

The sushi &amp; maki are fantastic but I am a sashimi lover. That must be purchased, handled and prepared with great care and I have seen that entire process take place many times at Wild Tuna, always with great attention to detail. 

Try their soups, any of their hot or cold appetizers. Great food. And if possible just ask Gene to make you something special and see what he cooks up for you! 

My favorites...Toro, Live Scallops, Tuna Tower, Spicy Seafood Udon and anything they prepare off menu!"

At the suggestion of some friends who live way down that way, I got in my car and trekked the hour + down to Naperthrill to enjoy a meal with friends.

Wild Tuna is a cute place, but it was a little hard to get to.  I can&#39;t blame them for that though, Google maps gave me bad directions.  Do be aware though, the side street you turn onto to get into the strip mall is not marked.  The whole time, I was looking for LaCrosse, and couldn&#39;t find it.

Anyway, I digress.  Onto the food.  We each ordered drinks, and began perusing the menu.  They offer three types of Japanese beer, Kirin, Sapporo, and one that I&#39;d never heard of before and don&#39;t recall the name.  They also have a variety of specialty cocktails and a full bar.

While we were deciding on rolls, we ordered miso soup.  They offer a spicy seafood miso, which was delicious.  The perfect blend of spices, chock full of calamari, scallops, and shrimp instead of tofu and seaweed.  Great flavor.

The rolls were for the most part, a hit:
Spider:  Typical spider, big pieces of soft shell crab, really very good.
B52: We ordered this one because it had yellowtail.  It was good, but came with cream cheese when the menu did not say cream cheese.  I don&#39;t dig cream cheese in sushi, so this one was a bummer, because yellowtail is my favorite.
Route 66: Good, but nothing is standing out to remember.
Caterpillar: The taste of the avocado on top overpowered the rest of the roll, but the avocados have been REALLY good this year, so I can&#39;t complain!
Crispy Veggie: Humongous.  Delicious.  My favorite part was instead of tempura crunchies on the outside, they had little sweet potato crispies.
Naperville: Great concept, poor execution.  The flavors were good, but the roll was poorly assembled and mushy.
Chicago Fire: My favorite one of the night.  Perfect spice, and the daikon radish wrap instead of seaweed was an awesome touch.

It was a bit pricey... after tax and tip, I think our total bill for 5 people was $200, but we did order a lot of food.  We like to gorge on sushi, but only do this once in awhile.

I&#39;d definitely go back, but only if I was meeting someone down in that area."

The staff is friendly, family owned if I&#39;m not mistaken. 

The sushi is clean, rolled well, and moderately priced. It&#39;s fairly fresh, so ordering their Nigiri is a good way to go. 

Wild Tuna&#39;s a nice spot to have near by. It&#39;s no revelation, but I think one of our finest hours of raw fish."

We always come for dinner---early because if you come after 7pm it&#39;s a long wait!  The sushi is what you would expect.  You can go from the very typical rolls to some fancy things.  They have a variety of combo plates with teriyaki.  My favorite is the chicken teriyaki--it is very good and plentiful.  Their shrimp tempura is excellent--my son loves it and although it&#39;s an appetizer it&#39;s enough for him as a meal.  And the wait staff is well-trained.  I only wish they would offer kids meals and milk or juice on the menu since lots of kids eat here.

It&#39;s a very small place, and I assumed we&#39;d be in for a long wait in a crowded dining room, but on a Saturday night it was practically dead.  We waited ten minutes for a table, then only saw about three parties enter the restaurant once we were seated.

That all said, the food was ok but not amazing.  For starters we shared calamari, tempura vegetables, a sad &#34;mixed green&#34; salad with only iceburg lettuce (plus a couple pieces of cucumber, tomatoes and shredded carrot).  I&#39;d do the tempura vegetables again but the calamari looked like a plate of onion rings and I didn&#39;t enjoy the texture (my spouse like it though).  The sushi was pretty good though - we shared two rolls with raw ingredients - an unagi and a yellowtail topped with spicy tuna.  Not the freshest, most delicious I&#39;ve ever had, but also not the most expensive.  I enjoyed the house cold sake.  Mochi for dessert.  Total bill was about $60 before gratuity.

Service was attentive - no complaints, except the sushi was brought out very soon after the appetizers, and I like a little break in-between.  I don&#39;t like letting sushi just sit there for long - you know what I&#39;m saying?

For higher-quality sushi in the suburbs, I&#39;d recommend Blu Coral in Woodridge, but it&#39;s pricier.  This place is moderately priced and very casual - I&#39;d stop in for carry-out sushi if I were in the area."

Simply put, Wild Tuna serves the best sushi in the Chicagoland area, bar none.  The location kind of sucks being way the heck out in a remote corner of the property-tax land-grab that is Naperville but it is worth the trip.  

When I say it is the best, what I mean is that it serves the best fish in the city.  I have been to about 50 different sushi restaurants in Chicago alone.  I have even been to one of the finest high end Japanese restaurants in the country, L20.  L20 certainly has amazing ingredients and exceptional talent, but for my money, outside of San Francisco or Japan, Wild Tuna is the best place to go if you simply want to actually taste fish.

Because of the proprietors expertise and his willingness to take the time to find it, Wild Tuna can offer a variety of the subtle tastes that set all the different fish apart and that make sushi the art that it is.  When I want sushi, I don&#39;t want crab stick and cocktail shrimp slathered in cream cheese and rolled into rice.  I want fish.  Rolls have their place, for sure, and you won&#39;t suffer for high quality, creative rolls (even those abominations with cream cheese) at Wild Tuna.  However, you absolutely must go there if you want to taste the fish.

The guy knows his stuff.  The live scallop is absolutely amazing (just make sure to get it without the lemon!)...and get there early because he runs out of them fast (as should happen anywhere that is providing quality fish).  His kampachi is also rare and unique in the Midwest.  Don&#39;t be shy, ask them to make you something special and they will...and it will be amazing.

And if sushi is not exactly your thing, they have some other great dishes too.  One of our favorites is an unagi tempura that they serve as an appetizer.  It is just wonderful, mostly because of the amazing sauce that they drizzle over it.

Finally, unlike most sushi bars, Wild Tuna&#39;s sake selection is actual pretty decent and dynamic.  At Wild Tuna you won&#39;t find the same, recycled Gekkeikan that you can get at the grocery store...not that there won&#39;t be any Gekkeikan products there, it will simply be their better stuff.  You can find nice variety to fit all tastes and all budgets at Wild Tuna.  After all, what is sushi without good quality, chilled sake!

If you want to really taste the wonderful subtleties that are the reasons why sushi bars offer more than one variety of fish or even if you just want some really good rolls, you have to give Wild Tuna a try!"

We tried Wild Tuna on friends&#39; recommendations and it didn&#39;t disappoint.  The strip mall location really doesn&#39;t do the place justice but it is a nod to the Naperville landscape.  Hey, you&#39;re in the suburbs, embrace it.  We waltzed in at 6:45 p.m. and there was no wait but a comfortably full restaurant.  Perfect.  

The place is cozy and much less flashy than Shinto, another Naperville fav.  They have one bathroom for the ladies but since the place is pretty small it wasn&#39;t a problem.  The bathroom itself was lovely and modern.  I&#39;ve been in some sushi places nearby where they use the bathrooms for extra storage so I appreciated the attention to the diner experience.

The menu isn&#39;t huge but we found plenty to keep us happy.  The shumai appetizer came with 8 pieces, which I like.  Some places give you 5 for the same price ($5.50).  We ordered a bunch of nigiri (hamachi, unagi, maguro), negi hamachi, avocado tuna, california, and the godzilla.  It was a good blend of the heavy, cream cheese and fried godzilla and the lighter stock rolls.  The nigiri was fresh and generously portioned.

The prices weren&#39;t crazy high but this is no bargain.  It cost us $62 for dinner without any alcohol...  I&#39;m willing to pay what they charge for the quality, atmosphere and service.   Our service was fast and our server was friendly and spoke English fluently.  She did leave dirty plates and wrappers and towelletes on our table for an unforgivably long time though... dropping off drinks but not picking up the dirty stuff.  Kinda strange of her to ignore the trash on our table.  We finally put it on another table that was about to be bussed, just to get it away from our newly arrived food.  But that&#39;s not a deal breaker. 

Overall, it was a nice 4-star field trip to a new restaurant (for us).  I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll go back."

Dinner was great and we were both sorry we could not finish ours. The service was great. With being as packed as it was we did not wait long for anything, and the people working every time we are there are very nice.

It was quite nice - sweet potato tempura wrapped up in a sushi roll with just a kick of spice. 
I say there might be better sushi, because Taka Sushi has been getting great reviews. However, we walked in, and walked right out of Taka. As good as people are saying the sushi is at Taka, there&#39;s no ambiance. it&#39;s a fish market that sells reportedly good sushi. We go for sushi and we want the whole experience, like we get at Wild Tuna. So, I won&#39;t write a review on Taka because we didn&#39;t eat there, and it&#39;d be unfair to rate it.

I am a purist. Sashimi only, and I&#39;m not happy if the restaurant doesn&#39;t serve uni (sea urchin). Wild Tuna not only has uni regularly, but it is as fresh and sweet as it comes. They often have select features like Amber-Jack or fatty tuna.  

My bf is a meat and potatoes kind of guy, but he loves the chicken yakitory and beef udon bowl. 


The service is always stellar and Gene, owner/chef will make you anything (he crafted a handroll with cucumber instead of seaweed and rice for me!).

Bottom line: ignore that it&#39;s tucked away in a strip mall, the food is very good, the fish is SO FRESH, the rolls are creative, and the service is absolutely wonderful."

It was really tasty and each roll was unique.  I&#39;d recommend the Wild Tuna Maki with the cilantro sauce...DELICIOUS!  Also the Spider Roll and Philadelphia roll.  The portions were perfect for the two of us and the prices were reasonable.  We&#39;ll definitely be back.

Restaurant&#39;s kind of small but I like the layout of the station where the sushi, sashimi, and etc was made.  
We ordered a bunch of rolls.  I liked them all~ not salty when compared to other shops I&#39;ve dined at.  The salmon skin roll was really good!
To sum it up, the service was excellent, food was amazing(!), and the atmosphere = super friendly.  
This place was totally worth the long drive."

We FINALLY did this weekend.  The sushi was decent, nothing spectacular.  Almost your typical run-of-the-mill suburban sushi joint. Though I really did enjoy the sashimi roll, and the sushi rice was very good and extra fresh.  The rolls are stuffed to capacity. Mama T and I were full to the max after four rolls and a seaweed salad.  And don&#39;t let our small size fool you, we can eat.  

There seems to be a great local following here.  I noticed that the waitresses, hostesses, etc. seemed very friendly with a bunch of people which I have determined to be devout, regular customers.  Kinda cute I guess, if you&#39;re in to that mushy nonsense.  I&#39;ll come back here if I&#39;m in the area and there&#39;s a sushi emergency.  This place is still way better than that disastrous establishment across the street known as Tokyo Bay."

This is my all-time favorite place, and serves as the benchmark that I judge other (comtemporary) sushi joints. I have had rolls that equal or exceed that of Wild Tuna, but their entire specialty menu is items I regularly enjoy, especially the Naperville, Mango Tango, Snow Mountain and Lobster.  

Their Sushi fish and Sashimi is also excellent, and Gene&#39;s guys always have artful and careful presentation, no matter what the dish. I&#39;d say my dad and I are regulars and they always treat us well, when we ask for something special, he puts something together, and (occasionally) something gets put on the house. He&#39;s a very good man.

Other things I enjoy
Diamond shrimp appetizer, The house hot green tea, The miso soup, salad, the Ice Cream (try the Green Tea and Red Bean if you&#39;re adventurous). Overall, I think it is the only sushi restaurant in Naperville worth going to more than once."

They take your food order and time of anticipated arrival and are very careful to tell you they will do their best to seat you if there is available seating, or seat you in the waiting area.  

Everything was perfect.  They had a table with the requested high chair.  No sooner was our drink order completed and delivered when here comes our pies.  Attentive, but not overly so wait staff brought patience to their task.  I thank them for that.  To have a table for seven with high chair, drinks and food at 5:30 PM on a Friday night requires preparation and execution. Our deep dish pies were hot and delicious.

The pizza is good, but overrated. Some people go crazy for the buttery crust, but that&#39;s not what I want in a pizza crust.   It seems  inauthentic to this Italian lady.
I have to say, I seem to be in the minority with my lack of adoration, so in most cases, people seem satisfied and it seems to be a safe bet for a large group.   
They offer an acceptable gluten free crust.  You will be hard pressed to find anything else other than salad that is gluten free.

Lou&#39;s is one of those Chicago joints that claims to be the inventors of the Chicago style pie. Not sure if they are, don&#39;t care, they ROCK!! This was the first place I ever had deep dish and have tried others but I like Lou&#39; a lot. The pie is great and I swear there sauce is made it just the right way for the Windy City trademark. There is something about the sausage I really dig to, perfect balance somewhere between sweet and hot. I had garlic bread that was worth mentioning, it was just perfecting toasted and I guess that was enough."

This location in particular is always pretty busy but there&#39;s enough seating that we never have to wait to get seated.  Order pizzas right away because it takes a long time to get them.  Although the wait is worth it.  The staff is always friendly and attentive. If it&#39;s warm enough you can sit outside and people watch...one thing I love to do.  Prices aren&#39;t bad and the pizza slices are filling.  A great place for pizza if your in the area.

This review is not to take on that epic battle but to share some ways to make your experience at Lou&#39;s in Downtown Naperville as memorable as possible. And while this review is for Naperville, I&#39;ve found these apply to all the sit down ones!

The Naperville Experience is one of my favorites. It situated in a great location with nice outdoor seating that let&#39;s you take in the views. The ambiance is an old firehouse mixed with a small town 16 inch softball feel. The staff is amazing and will get to know you by name after just your third visit. My kids call the manager Aunt Chrissy and she is flat out amazing! They do a great job with parties and other events - you are treated like gold. 

First Timer Experience/What to Expect
1. Expect to wait if you go during the evening. Lines can get hectic and it gets quite cramped in there. If you want to avoid lines, go on the weekends for lunch or before 4:30pm any day.
2. Don&#39;t pre-order. Yes. It speeds things up but I always felt the pizza quality is less
3. Block Out the Menu! There is a lot going on with a Lou&#39;s menu and many good things, but first timers need to stick with the classic deep dish and a pizza cookie at the end.
4. This is a ripe tomato sauce is on sweet and tangy side. If you are expecting savory, the sauce won&#39;t be the spot for it but you get a killer combination of sweet and savory with butter crust as well as sausage and pepperoni.

What to Order: Pizza Recommendation
1. The Foundational Experience: Deep Dish Cheese with Butter Crust | the Malnati Classic (sometimes we add light pepperoni)
2. The Adventure Experience: Deep Dish Extra Cheese, Sausage (full patty), Pepperoni, Garlic, and Hot Giardiniera. Packs a wic
3. The Unexpected: The Crustless Pizza
4. The Kids/Picky Ones: The thin pizza is pretty darn good and kids that are less inclined to enjoy the heavy sauce and toppings of a deep dish really take to this pizza. 

What to Order: Other Items to Try
1. French Fries: It sounds odd. I absolutely adore their curly fries. I find with the sweet sauce that is Lou&#39;s, the salty/savory concept of fries is great.
2. Salad: We like the Family House with House Red Wine Vinaigrette or the Sweet Vinaigrette
* again, plenty you can get and we&#39;ve tried most. I just don&#39;t see much of a point if coming to Lou&#39;s for the other aspects.

Tips
1. BIG THING: This is huge. Only order Medium Pizzas. The distribution of a Lou&#39;s medium is perfect. Anything larger and the center is soggy and anything smaller hinders the crust. We get two mediums for our family and it is perfect!
2. Crust: Do make it Butter crust
3. Sausage: the traditional sausage at Lou&#39;s is a sheet (we call it a hockey puck). I love sausage but it is too much for me so I ask for sausage crumbles. 
4. Save Room for Dessert: The Chocolate Chip Pizza is to die for especially post pizza. However, do the big one. The little ones get too soupy. I do wish they brought back on the Peanut Butter Pizza (no one seems to believe me about this one)
5. Well done is something that I personally like but only when I do extra cheese, sausage, and pepperoni. It doesn&#39;t work well with just cheese and I&#39;m 50/50 with those that have tried well done.
6. Great New Year&#39;s Eve party for families!"

My wife ordered the buffalo wings appetizer and they were severely overlooked.  Took a while for the waitress to return but she was quick about getting a new batch for my wife.  The manager never came over to check on us even after food was sent back and no discount was offered as a result of the bad food.  This is pretty common thing to do in this situation.  Wasn&#39;t very crowded not sure what happened.  Bad experience, the downtown Chicago location wouldn&#39;t have done this."

This specific location is fun because it&#39;s an old firehouse. Before that it was a police station with a little jail (source: my eight year old). We like to speculate that it was a haunted jail and that the creepy boy doll/mannequin that they have suspended from the ceiling in the back dining room might just come awake when the restaurant is closed. He&#39;s also probably watching us eat, looking to see if we are his long lost family so that he can follow us home and.............

Too scary!

Also, the pizza is great. We usually stick with the deep dish sausage or the Lou, which is a veggie pizza. The thin crust is really good too, so give it a shot. Salads are good and there&#39;s beer. All boxes checked - Lou gets five stars."

There were 5 of us, so we ordered a large deep dish pepperoni pizza (pictured) and a thin crust medium. This was the perfect amount of food for us as there was only 1 deep dish piece left at the end!

And the fact there is some deep dish pizza in downtown Naperville where all the cool restaurants, shops and bars are located was a plus.

And this is a sit down place too, they have other locations where it&#39;s just pick-up only. Very big with outdoor seating, bar seating and more seating in the back. And you can taste all the flavors oozing out of the deep dish pizza especially Lou&#39;s specialty.

Definitely fills you up after a couple of slices. Just enough of toppings where it doesn&#39;t saturate your palette and you can taste all the goodness.

Desserts are designed for 2 or more, but they have individual size ones too and I had the warm cookie with ice cream. Nice way to finish my meal."

I came to Chicago to visit and one of the top things on my to try list was obviously deep dish pizza. After much research and consulting my fellow yelpers, I decided to go for Lou malnatis. I went in with high expectations but was slightly disappointed.

We called ahead of time to order our pizza and after we arrived still had to wait a long time before it was ready. The first bite did taste heavenly but after that it got just a bit much. The crust seemed like a pie crust so it was a bit weird. There was just also too much cheese and not enough flavor. I am not sure if I&#39;m just not a huge fan of deep dish or this place just didn&#39;t deliver. I&#39;ll definitely try another place if I visit Chicago again.

They got us seated in about 45 minutes, much quicker than the originally estimated, and we pre-ordered our pizza so there was only a short wait for our meal to arrive.

I grew up in Naperville so I may be a bit biased, but Lou&#39;s is my favorite pizza in the world. This location tends to usually get pretty busy and parking can be a nightmare, but if you park across from the library or go up a street you&#39;ll usually find spots!

There are a few TVs, but they&#39;re not loud or overwhelming. There&#39;s a lot to look at, which makes it fun for kids (I spy...) but it&#39;s not too kitschy; rather, the walls are filled with artefacts and Chicago history.

The service is usually pretty great. The pizzas take a while but so an appetiser is in order to share with the table.

The best thing on their menu is the Malnati&#39;s salad-lettuce mix with crunchy bacon, gorgonzola chunks, diced tomatoes, olives and a sweet dressing.

Their thin crust pizza is good-crust on that as well as the deep dish is excellent.   Sauce is decent-a little too chunky tomato-ey for me-but ingredients (meats as well as vegetables) are fresh and they&#39;re not skimpy on the cheese!  The deep dish cookie sundae is...awesome!

Lively atmosphere inside the restaurant-the old Naperville fire house-with a back room for larger parties.   Take out works as well-enter on the side door on the east side of the building and they do quite a business on their own."

Didn&#39;t catch the name of my server, but he was efficient and knew his stuff. I ordered a family sized house salad and he advised that it would be too big for a party of 3. And he was right. Downsell!

The house salad was to die for. Perfectly tossed, it was bursting with flavor and the bacon bits gave it just enough crunch. I ate a LOT of salad.

Got some other apps too which were good, but nothing to write home about.

The pizza, however, different story. We got the Chicago classic, a deep dish butter crust large with a sheet of sausage!  Let me say - fantastic! From the bottom up, it&#39;s layered as - crust, cheese, sausage sheet, sauce. And the sauce really made the pizza - you can really taste the fresh tomato dices in it.

Sadly, I was so stuffed I only ate one slice in the restaurant (I went overboard with the salad). But I packed the rest and can&#39;t wait to be hungry again!!

Definitely would return and recommend anyone try this Chicago staple!"

Trust me when I say that this is going to be very helpful information for you, so listen up. When coming here, you should only get the Lou. Seriously trust me on this. I am a meat lover and this pizza has none. Although the Lou might not have any meat, this is the only exception I make. If you don&#39;t like the Lou you are better off going to Giordano&#39;s. I came here with a group of 10 and we had to wait almost 2 hours without reservation on a Saturday night around 6:00PM (got seating at 8:00PM). Overall, the pizza at Lou Malnati&#39;s is slightly underwhelming in size compared to Giordano&#39;s and the only pizza worth getting is the Lou.

SPECIAL TIP: For folks over 21, if you ever get the Lou for take-out or eat here, make sure you get some wine. Wine+The Lou is a dream duo. Trust me on this one."

My review for their delivered pizza.- We love their pizza but it&#39;s better in the restaurant then delivered. They make ordering easy with their online ordering. I would suggest not getting it cut before delivering. The taste of the pizza was great but we had to warm it in the oven when the delivery driver dropped it off. The deep dish pizza stays hot and we can eat it when it arrives. The delivery drivers always seem polite and happy to be delivery the pizza...but we would order more often of the pizza stayed hot when it&#39;s delivered. I think Lou Malnatis is better in the restaurant."

The wings are great too, eve though they&#39;re kinda small the flavor on the buffalou is delicious. Oh and their homemade ranch is outstanding!

We settled on this place and were seated promptly. After this however our experience went a bit down hill. 

We were hungry and ordered bruschetta, pizza, and meatballs from our waiter. The bruschetta came fairly fast but we never saw our waiter again after that. After waiting for about 45 minutes after the bruschetta another waitress delivered our pizza. We were excited to eat it but we were disappointed that the pizza was cold. The cheese wasn&#39;t warm and the plate it was cooked on was room temp. It even had the look of a pizza that had been sitting out for a while. Needless to say we were disappointed (the meatballs also never came nor were they rung up in the computer). 

Since we were disappointed the waitress brought over the manager. He was awkward and not really sure how to handle the situation but ended up offering the pie for free. That was an Ok response but you could tell he was just trying to stop talking to us.

TLDR; I ended up eating a cold slice of pizza that was OK and the service was subpar from the wait staff to the management."

Nicely located at the end of the of the downtown Naperville complex, we were able to find convenient parking just across the street--a short walk from the restaurant. The restaurant itself is larger than it appears. We chose to dine outside on their covered patio, but I noticed there&#39;s plenty of seating inside the restaurant as well. Luckily, they were not busy so we were able to be seated without a wait.

We shared the Malnati Chicago Classic: Lou&#39;s lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust. To balance out the heavy pizza, we decided to also share an order of the Chicken BBQ Club Salad: chopped romaine lettuce, grilled chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, shredded mozzarella, cheddar and Volpi salami served with Club dressing and tortilla chips. I thoroughly enjoyed both the salad and the pizza! I think ordering an appetizer here is a must while you wait for your pizza, otherwise you will probably find the wait to be excruciating, especially if you come hungry! The pizza is definitely worth the wait though. Our pizza was loaded with a  ton of hot, delicious cheese and tomato. As a Southerner, I have to be honest and say I can only ever finish one slice of Chicago Deep Dish, but I love it every time. The crust is crispy and  I really enjoyed tasting the fresh ingredients in both the salad and the pizza, and this meal was one of my favorites on my visit. We had a bit of salad and pizza leftover and we ended up taking both home because frankly, you don&#39;t waste goodness. 

Service is excellent, looking forward to coming back!"

We got there and they told us it&#39;d be a 45 minute wait but we ended up waiting for over an hour. Once we sat down, it took 15 mins to get drinks. We finally ordered and it took a while to get the pizza out, which is expected. (Tip: You must have lots of patience for Chicago style pizza) But then what really annoyed me is the waiter brought out our pizza and say it down next to us. Then he disappeared for about 5 minutes with us just sitting there, salivating for a taste of the pizza.

Overall, the pizza is great. You can&#39;t go wrong with Chicago style pizza. The atmosphere is casual and fun. However, this location seemed very slow-moving. I would suggest going to another Lou&#39;s or another pizza place, unless you have the time and patience for slow service."

1/10 times the order comes right, but the other 9 times they do not come as I indicated. Adding 5 more minutes to cook it well-done seemed to be really hard thing for them... It comes with very soggy under the pizza and the undercooked butter crust ruins the whole taste. Also, some servers and hosts here are very unprofessional and disrespectful.

While DD is not my favorite version of a pizza, I can appreciate it once in a while and I love Lou&#39;s buttery crust. 

While my guests eat their &#34;tomato casserole&#34; pizza, I order a personal sized &#34;Lou&#34; for myself. --Spinach, mushrooms, sliced roma tomatoes covered with mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese and made with their garlic Buttercrust.

And for the Gluten-Free people, my brother is a very sensitive celiac and Lou&#39;s makes a legit GF pizza! Only pizza he&#39;s been able to eat for years! He loves it and loves that he can momentarily forget that he has to eat differently than everyone else. No issues at all! Made in its own pan. No cross-contamination. --Winner winner pizza dinner!
 
Salads are HUGE and always fresh (all can be made GF by omitting possible croutons).The &#34;Malnati&#34; is my go-to salad. --The sweetened vinaigrette is paired perfectly with the gorgonzola cheese and the salty olives. Even my kids love it.  Note: a regular size will feed a family so forget the family size if you&#39;re also ordering pizza and apps! Especially because leftover salad is a waste; it never keeps overnight.

Although, I&#39;ve never eaten it, my teens go to Lou&#39;s with their friends *just* to eat their &#34;Chocolate Chip Pizza&#34; --a cookie made in a personal sized pizza pan, served with ice cream and whipped cream. It&#39;s supposed to serve 2-3 people but I swear they order one for each of them. Oh, to have the metabolism of a teenager.... ;)"

Although my group of six people waited nearly two full hours for our two deep dish pizzas, management didn&#39;t charge us at all for our entire order. More importantly, both pizzas tasted great!

It took a tremendous amount of courage and integrity for their staff to accept everything which happened in their restaurant that night and make it right for the customers. While losing our money on a busy Saturday night is the last thing they would want, this kind of care for great customer service speaks loudly for how well this location is managed.

I recently called to place a very large delivery order for a family get-together. Not only was I placed on hold for a long period, but the person answering the phone wasn&#39;t all that pleasant to begin with. Not going to fault them for that; we all have bad days. After the long wait, I was told that I wasn&#39;t in their &#34;delivery zone.&#34; That&#39;s pretty odd considering that I had another large order delivered a few months back. I was told that the manager said I was out of the location&#39;s delivery zone and that we couldn&#39;t proceed with the order. Still not sure how I managed to mysteriously fall out of their delivery zone, but there wasn&#39;t much I could do at this point. I then asked if there was a location near me (Lisle) that delivers. Didn&#39;t really get much help and eventually I (not the staff) suggested the Downers Grove location. They said to call that location as that would be my &#34;best bet.&#34; Great.

I ended up calling the Downers Grove location (it&#39;s actually further away from my house than the downtown Naperville location) even though they don&#39;t carry all of the same items. The manager (Matthew, I believe) said that even though I was outside of his delivery area, he would take the order. I really appreciated that and plan on leaving a positive review for his location.

I would suggest the downtown Naperville location keep its &#34;delivery zone&#34; consistent so that people don&#39;t have to scramble at the last minute to find a replacement. Extremely disappointed and definitely not ordering from Lou&#39;s again. Good thing we&#39;re in Chicago - there&#39;s a lot of other options. Do yourself a favor and explore them."

The deep dish is very good and very filling as even on my most hungry days i cant have more than two pieces. This is my go to pizza place for entertaining friends or family. Will say that the pizza isnt for everybody. The sauce is different and may not sit well on everybody&#39;s pallet, but overall i have a very good experience with the wait staff and the food.

I&#39;m not a big deep dish fan, but this place makes a pretty good one, and this may be sacrilege to say but I think there thin crust was even better.

I made a fatal error however, I came here 2 days after a pizza party back home so was looking for non-pizza food - do not attempt.  I ordered the grilled chicken (disgusting) with spinach and mushrooms....my body rejected this dish VIOLENTLY after a few hours rumbling in my stomach."

Couple weeks ago we went with son and coupla buddies in tow. Sat nite and busy...we pre-ordered our pizza like we always do and walked over to Andersons and Apple Store to hang and wait for our buzzers to go off. They did in about 45, all good, we sat down. Nice waiter produced our pre-order info and took care of the kid orders. So we watched and waited while the kids food arrived as well as everyone&#39;s around us, folks who had arrived long after us. So...we, concerned and purty damn hungry, got our very apologetic (and working his ass off, BTW) waiter to fetch a manager, which he did. Our order got lost...by this time kids were done and roaming...so...management brought a large pizza in a box, comped our entire meal, and gave us free pizza voucher.

There was a large party taking up about 1/3 of the seating, so it was good that we called our order in ahead.  This should be standard for any deep dish place unless you plan to order and wait at the bar.... if there isn&#39;t a seat open you&#39;ll be doing it anyway.

Speaking of, the bar isn&#39;t huge, but has an OK selection of local favorites (two brothers, etc)... however I could always use more.  Its nice to be able to grab a drink while you wait though.

I don&#39;t know why its not on the menu (or so hard to find), but they have a deep dish with italian beef and hot giardiniera, so don&#39;t skimp and get the good stuff!  Nobody wants to be left asking &#34;Where&#39;s the beef?&#34;

We had that (and the waiter complimented the order) as well as a spinach pepperoni thin crust and I thought both were very tasty.  Pizza is left tableside and your first slice (or more) is served by the waiter.

Be prepared to eat well, and enjoy every bite.  Lou&#39;s is a Chicago great!"

Men + pizza = happiness (just go with it) :). We decided to sit outside with our two kids on the patio. We were seated right away and had a good view of people walking around the downtown area (mostly swarming around the Apple Store). 
     Our server was friendly, but service itself was a bit slow and spotty. I think our waiter must have been newer or way too overstretched. At the end of the meal I waited a good 10 minutes to finish paying for everything. But onto the food: we split a Caesar salad with chicken. The adults got the Lou and the girls split a thin crust cheese pizza. It is standard to wait for a deep dish pizza, so don&#39;t be surprised at how long it takes to come or. Luckily my kids chose to not act like they do at home and were quite patient and civilized. The salad was huge and held everyone over until the pizza came. It was a great tasting, fresh salad and the amount of dressing was just right. 
    The pizzas of course are great-in terms of Chicago pizza (I&#39;ve lived here forever sonJve had my fair share), I would say this ranks in the top 3 for deep dish definitely! You are totally full after less than 2 slices-plenty of leftovers. The kids enjoyed their crispy thin crust too. Pizza from here has never disappointed us-when we want a pie, this is the first place we think of."

I have had Lou Malnati&#39;s delivered many times.  When being delivered it is recommended that you get the pizza uncut,  It only stays warm if you order the deep dish, not thin crust.  For some reason they do not bring the pizza to the door in a bag warmer.  With that said, the restaurant service is good.  The most recent visit had good hospitality service from our server Felipe.  He was very attentive and made sure our drinks weren&#39;t empty.  He was sure not to come too much, but also made sure not to ignore and forget about us.  My wife and I shared the small Malnati salad as we planned on ordering a deep dish pizza which takes around 30 minutes.  The small salad was a large generous portion which we took over half of it home.  The pizza we ordered was the Chicago Classic which actually came out in less time than advertised.  We ordered a larger pizza to take leftovers home as the leftovers heat up very well.  The price point for Lou Malnati&#39;s is competitive, especially to another local competitor.  Whether you are looking for a thin crust or deep dish pizza, Malnati&#39;s is the place to go."

So we both got bowls of the minestrone soup (pretty average, but I&#39;m no soup pro) as well as a large stuffed pepperoni and sausage pizza. The bottom is crisp and the toppings are plentiful; this is the only pizza I know if that I can have the sausage (most places have the caraway seeds which, to me, give it a bad bite)! It was a tad dry, but that won&#39;t stop me from coming back. Our server, Max, was on his game, keeping our drinks full as well as being friendly. He is fast; I see him chatting with every table he serves, yet zooms by for the next person. A definite asset! Next time we shall try the thin crust :-)"

Perhaps I&#39;m a bit biased, because I prefer Gioradano&#39;s located just a couple blocks away, but the pizza was good.

Pros:
 - Excellent service. Our waiter was always checking on our party of 8. When we ordered appetizers expecting the rest of our party to arrive shortly, and they didn&#39;t, our waiter told us to go ahead and eat the apps - he&#39;d bring us more (on the house) when our party arrived, so the apps didn&#39;t get cold. Very nice.
 - Good pizza. Adequate cheese and toppings and tasty butter crust. Call be crazy, but I prefer the thin crust. Most others in my party preferred the thick.
 - Those little fried cheese ball appetizers are AMAZING.

Cons:
 - Parking is not fun. Sure, it&#39;s free, but it took a while for us to find a spot at 11:30am on a Saturday. We finally found one a couple blocks away in a big parking lot. We nabbed the spot as someone was leaving. 2 seconds after we pulled out of the spot to leave, it was taken.
 - It can be a little cramped trying to navigate around tables. This is because the pizzas are brought and served from a tray that sits next to the table. Dodge the trays.

We were there for a good 2+ hours and we were never made to feel rushed. I&#39;d go back."

Too heavy, too saucy, too doughy, too much! 
Anytime someone from IL suggests going out for pizza I cringe. 

But at least if we go to Lou&#39;s I know I have a good thin-crust option (though frankly it&#39;s a little too thin in my mind; kind of &#34;appetizery,&#34; not enough substance. I guess it&#39;s one extreme or the other here!)

Their pizza is really flavorful, though: the sauce or herbs or whatever really have a pleasant pungency, and you and your entire party had better be eating the pizza or you will annoy one another with your gahhhlic breath on the ride home!!

This location is convenient to downtown Naperville (read: parking sucks; just go for the parking deck rather than circling like a schmuck). You will also encounter a zillion families with kids. Do your shopping and then settle in for your deep dish depth charge! I&#39;ll be over here with my thin-crust, thanks ;)"

I am a server and my husband is a restaurant manager, we have both been in this business for a long time. I only mention that to show that we can be understanding of a rough night on the job....but this was ridiculous!!! I called when we were on our way, to order the Chicago Classic (my favorite), cuz I know it takes awhile. When we arrived, we were told it would be a 35-40 minute wait for 6 of us....we were sat in about 15 minutes. They way over shot the wait time, which was good for us, but others might get discouraged, and go somewhere else. We were also told that my call ahead order is timed to arrive at our table within 15-20 minutes after we are seated...which was fine with me, cuz we were ordering more food. When we were seated, the server came promptly and took our drink order, which we also received quickly, but after that, all was a complete fail! The pizza I ordered ahead came immediately, and we hadnt even ordered our apps or anything else. Our server never returned. I sat right by the host stand, watching the manager laughing and joking with 3 young looking hosts, one of which was playing with her hair and picking at her face (yuk)! I went up to the host stand and asked if we were gonna see our server again, which the inexperiened manager replied that he would go find her. When she finally came over, she apologized and said she didnt think we were ordering anything else, because I called ahead an order. Its pretty obvious that 1 medium pizza is not gonna feed 6 people. Besides the point that she should be checking on her guests anyway. At no point yet, had a manger come over. During all this we watched different people wandering around attempting to drop off food and drinks to wrong tables. We were approached with the wrong food, and had someone try to drop off a beer at our table, that we didnt order. He then went to the couple next to us, who also expressed it wasnt theirs, but they joked they would take it anyways, and he gave it to them! Mind you, they were young looking, so there goes your liquor cost and a possible underage situation....no ID was asked for or shown. We finally received our other pizza and food 1 hour into our visit....unacceptable. During the rest of our time there the server did redeem herself and stay polite and attentive, in the end we felt for her and blamed terrible and lazy management. Oh, at the end, the manager did finally come over and apologize for the server...he offered us a free dessert for the whole table of 6, how insulting. This used to be my husbands favorite spot...NEVER AGAIN!"

Anyway - It&#39;s been YEARS since I&#39;ve stepped foot into a Lou Malnati&#39;s and I knew there was one in Naperville, I just wanted the perfect time to visit.  Every time I&#39;ve passed this place at night around dinner time it&#39;s beyond packed.  This past weekend was the perfect time to grab a late lunch and wait out the storm hitting the area so we got in around 2:15.  

I liked that this place used to be a firehouse? I think? So the decor is firehouse inside...pretty neat.

I was very surprised to see how many staff were working and standing around just watching tv - around TEN!!! This is besides the point because it wasn&#39;t very busy, and our service was just fine.  If we didn&#39;t get good service, I&#39;d complain about the many employees hanging out doing nothing.  The way the shifts are scheduled has nothing to do with me but just a little put off by actually seeing the staff just hanging out.

Deep dish is the way to go here... there is thin crust but that is just out of the picture.  The pizza isn&#39;t your typical thick doughy deep dish either - it&#39;s just right.  There really isn&#39;t another option here!

Service was good, pizza was good... hit up this place during non-peak times and you can get in and out...though I&#39;d say it&#39;s definitely worth the wait as well!"

There are a million different restraunts out there!! You are special and so are your customers. Start treating them that way.

I dealt with one employee on the phone who was incredibly rude and ignorant. So much that I was tempted to call back and cancel my order. When I picked up my food, I told the manager about my experience. Her response was &#34;Oh really? I will have a talk with him.&#34; No compensation, which was fine. But not even an apology. I could not believe the lack of empathy and how it really didn&#39;t seem to faze her. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think I will be back."

But, since I&#39;ve been trying to give good reviews where they are deserved I have to.  I believe in Yelp, and what it has done for business.


Let me say I LOVE, this place!!!!

I wish I lived closer, but am glad I get to go here from time to time.

The great thing about this place is that&#39;s it&#39;s cafeteria style, so you don&#39;t really have to tip... although, there is one person that if he&#39;s there I always do, cause he really takes care of you.

They have spoiled me on bruschetta.  They have the best, and I rate everybody else&#39;s on theirs.  

I also think they have the best Fettuccine Alfredo too, which is something I don&#39;t order in many other places because it never satisfies me the way Bernard&#39;s does.

There daily specials are always amazing and on display when you walk in.

My only negative is the last time I went here they don&#39;t accept credit cards.  So I always use either their ATM or the one in the bank next store and end up with paying the $3 charge for taking out money from someplace that isn&#39;t my bank.

But even with the additional $3, it&#39;s still a great meal."

The quality of the charcuterie was good, and the eggplant gave a nice acidity to the sandwich. The sandwich was served with some robust rippled potato chips. I don&#39;t know if they were cooked on site, but they were certainly of a thicker cut than the mass market varieties I&#39;ve tried. Very tasty. 

I was pleased with the quality of my sandwich at Bernard&#39;s, though I believe that the sandwiches and burgers are a little overpriced (by about a buck) compared to the area competition. If you don&#39;t mind paying a slight premium for a quality product, then Bernard&#39;s is your place.

The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because after leaving, we drove 15 minutes to our hotel and there were no forks in the bag. GRRRRRR.  We had to put our food away, put our coats on and head to a gas station to find forks.  It added an adventure to our anniversary evening but could&#39;ve done without it.  Despite that inconvenience, we enjoyed the food all the same.

I usually come here for the pasta, most of which is good, but I have consistently been disappointed by their Ravioli.  While it isn&#39;t bad, it does tend to be a bit bland (I can tell no difference between the spinach and cheese varieties other than their appearance).  Their lasagna is also good, but be forewarned, the cheese they use is very VERY rich and probably won&#39;t sit well with everyone.  Their marinara sauce is amazing and their meat balls are the best I have ever tasted!

Their special pizzas usually are worth a go. I suggest ordering just a slice before ordering more as they sometimes can be too salty.  Their personal-pan pizzas are alright but my personal favorite is the Boboli, try it if you like a simple cheese, tomato and pesto pizza.

Their salad bar is quite good, just be careful how much you grab, it&#39;s $7 and change per pound.

Their busboy Jose has been here since the beginning, and while some may interpret his mannerisms as being pushy I always found him to have the best intentions.

For some reason this place is vehemently anti-credit card, so be sure to bring your cash or an ATM card as they now have an ATM right next to the till."

I don&#39;t usually eat bread with my pasta, but i could not resist this after watching someone take it out of the oven and cut through its crunchy crust with a giant knife.  The salad bar was good- no iceberg in sight.  They have beer and wine, so that&#39;s another point in my book.  
The only thing I don&#39;t like about this place is that you have to order up at the counter.

I had the special panini, which was ham, provolone, and tomatoes.  Damn, this sandwich was good.  I forgot how much I love ham in a deli sandwich, I try to order leaner meats, but I could not resist this time.

My only complaint was that there was a kind of puddle under my sandwich, like when you have a pickle spear on the side.  Except there was no pickle..where was this moisture coming from?  I can only guess that it was from the tomatoes being pressed in the panini??  I dont know, but I dont like a soggy sandwich.  Even still, it was pretty damn good.

Ate there today and noticed that they had freshly-made pasta in their front fridge - had always known their pasta was tasty!

Most of their menu consists of burgers and steaks.  They have both beef and bison, which is why I like going....we get enough beef so I like to have bison when I go.

When you walk in you really feel like you could be in Montana.  Feels very country, without being country.  That may not make sense.  It&#39;s not like southwest or southern country, its northern country.  

The walls have a nice wood panel to them.  There&#39;s a big buffalo head hanging on the wall.  Ted likes to use sustainable, recycled products:  the straws for your drink are made from recycled paper.  At first you won&#39;t really notice, but after 10 minutes your straw starts to soften up.  Everything on the table is recycled...napkins, etc.  may not seem like much, but it adds to the ambiance.

At most restaurants they bring out bread while you wait.  Ted brings out these natural made pickles that are probably the best I&#39;ve ever had.

So, burgers.  They aren&#39;t the best or the biggest, but they are good quality.  You can tell that Ted puts a lot of effect I to making everything there high quality.

You don&#39;t see this at too many places, but the bathrooms use a powdered hand soap called boraxo, and the men&#39;s stalls are waterless.

I recommend trying it at least once for the overall experience"

Ted&#39;s takes me back to a family road trip out west and brings back memories that was decades ago. Ted&#39;s staple and feature food is of course Bison. Finding Bison as fine dining in Illinois is a challenge. There Bison is tasty, well seasoned and didn&#39;t disappoint. 

I had the glorious bacon cheeseburger topped with a little American flag. I paired my juicy burger with the 50/50 which consists of half fries and half ginormous onion rings. My bison burger paired perfectly with a glass or two of red Cabernet. 

For all the meat lovers and bison extraordinaire  out there Ted&#39;s will not disappoint you. The only thing I would change about the experience is Ted didn&#39;t ask if I wanted dessert and I&#39;m always for something sweet."

Nice selection, and because it&#39;s an actual steakhouse you can expect that they are going to know how to cook it. 

So I thought. The other night I was feeling weak (after having had the flu the week before) and decided to boost my iron with a little red meat, so I went to Ted&#39;s alone for a steak. I ordered the beef Delmonico ribeye, medium. 

When I got it, the outside was fine but the inside was quite literally raw. I cut through it in a couple of places to make sure it wasn&#39;t just one spot, but it had been seared on the outside and was totally underdone throughout. Urgh. I flagged my waitress; she looked at it and agreed and said she&#39;d have them &#34;put it back on,&#34; which didn&#39;t sound promising (because since the outside was perfect, it would be toast by the time the inside caught up). 

Sure enough, when she brought it back and urged me to cut into it, it was so scorched I could barely saw into it, literally. She said they would make another. Meanwhile I kept my garlic mashed potatoes and gravy (excellent side dish!) because I was really hungry!!

Meanwhile the manager came over, and this was honestly the weakest point in the transaction. The restaurant was fairly loud and the woman was mumbling; I had to say, &#34;I can&#39;t hear you&#34; twice. Also, she said, &#34;You had a problem with your Del?&#34; &#34;We&#39;re making you a new Del.&#34; I didn&#39;t know what she was talking about but eventually realized she meant the DELmonico steak. Using jargon with patrons isn&#39;t helpful: just say &#34;steak&#34;! 

Anyway, they did make a new one, which was better, and since I was alone and wasn&#39;t in a hurry it wasn&#39;t a big deal, and they comped the meal (as they should). My waitress tried to say I didn&#39;t need to tip her, but it certainly wasn&#39;t her fault! Service is never a problem here, and the ambiance is nice, which is why we come back so often (try to get one of the enclosed booths if you can; deadens some of the sound). 

So even though this wasn&#39;t the finest experience, I know they are capable of great things, and I will be back,"

Last Wednesday was a protein day for me. I had an hour to spend downtown while my phone was being repaired and walked into Ted&#39;s around 11:30. I sat at the bar. The staff seemed hasty. I asked for a bison burger, no bun, no sides and was told it would be about 15 minutes. No problem. About 5 minutes after I ordered, I had to ask for water. About 10 minutes after I ordered, I was brought the check. I was a little taken aback but paid and waited.

Since I didn&#39;t have my phone and I was alone, my entertainment was looking around. The decor was cozy, a bit like a lodge but much nicer. The retro cash register was a nice touch. Sports were playing on two TVs, not to my interest but I didn&#39;t bother to ask anyone to change the channel either.

My food was brought out in a container. I asked for a fork and knife and was given plastic. As I was about to wonder what the heck was going on, I realised they thought it was a to-go order. They gave me some silverware and I ate at the bar.

Simple mistake. I get it. But what frustrated me was that it was $12 for a burger with water. A burger with nothing on it, no sides, nothing. Just meat. I&#39;m not really sure what to think or say beyond that. I know special requests can be frustrating but it was simple and I was as polite thankful as can be. Still I felt like a nuisance.

Rough morning/afternoon at Ted&#39;s? Maybe.

The explanation
I&#39;ve been to this place three times, and last night was my third, and probably the last .. At least at this location. We came in last night around 8pm. The occasion was a small celebration and I was treating my family to dinner. Overall, I have a few complaints that mar anything else that might be this restaurant&#39;s saving grace. I&#39;ll get to those things in a second, but first, the good stuff. 

The meat is incredible, it really is. Even if they don&#39;t cook it RIGHT, it&#39;s still good -- which says a lot about their cuts. The atmosphere is great and the place is very cozy with lots of wood, lamps, and creaky floors. 
My smallest complaint -- like many others, is that they give you salty pickles instead of bread. It&#39;s probably to get you used to the onslaught of salt they&#39;re about to serve you, which makes you continuously order more 6 dollar beers. 

Both my father and my husband avoid salt like the plague. Excessive amounts really make them sick, so they just avoid it altogether. So when we asked if we could get things without being salted it didn&#39;t seem to be a problem -- until the food arrived. Neither of the guys could touch their mashed potatoes, and even after I regretfully took a few bites, I have to say that my tongue still burns this morning after last nights salt lick. It ruined the meal. Add that to the lack of service we received and it&#39;s difficult to enjoy your food when all you taste is salt AND you have no water, much less ice tea, or beer refills.

The layout of the restaurant isn&#39;t particularly conducive to good service. There&#39;s a very large partition in the middle that divides the restaurant length and although I think it handicaps the servers, they probably aren&#39;t trying very hard anyway. We were literally the ONLY people in the restaurant last night, and service was very poor. Understandable for an overworked service, but unacceptable when she&#39;s just sitting at the bar flirting with the chef and chatting with the other server. I had to stand up and wave through the glass twice at the other server who got her attention for us. 

In conclusion, meat was good, restaurant is cozy and attractive, but the nacho appetizer and bison meatloaf were skimpy for the price, there was no bread, there was no service, there were no refills, and don&#39;t order the mashed potatoes unless you smoke a pack a day, or have a death wish."

The &#34;Big Sky&#34; with Bison is something I salivate just thinking about. I eat my salads dry without dressing (and without cheese or croutons) because of my dietary needs. Vegetables are very fresh and they don&#39;t skimp. So fresh and good that I don&#39;t even miss eating dressing. -thé tomatoes, avocado, bacon and bison patty provide all the flavor I need!

The fresh pickles... I fight everyone at our table for them! Which is silly of me because they&#39;ll bring more. ;) So fresh though. You can still taste the cucumber. 

I give it a 4 star because some of the kids&#39; meals are lacking. One of my kids ordered a kids&#39; steak and it had the weirdest flavor. I couldn&#39;t even get it down. They replaced it for free and were very kind about it, bringing out Mac n Cheese to replace it. --I could barely taste any cheese on it. It was better than the funky steak so I wasn&#39;t about to complain to the staff though. 

A few days ago, my 3 yr old ordered the beef sliders and fries and she nearly ate all of them, which is a definite testament of what she thought of them. :) She even asked the very next day if we could go back again."

Yes, I&#39;m a fan... At this price point they give you something a little different.. a bit healthier. Sure they have beef and other things, but I&#39;m grooving on the bison when I&#39;m at Ted&#39;s. 

Stopped in with my son yesterday and had the Bison Pot Roast, it&#39;s tender and not too fatty.. comes with a tasty gravy, GREAT mashed potatoes and somewhat crisp green beans.. a winner of a dinner... BUT! because this is not my first Ted&#39;s rodeo... I started off with the excellent Bison Chili... I love the Bison Chili! They throw some fresh sliced Jalapenos on top (which is good for those of us that like some spice and crunch) and that is something that I can appreciate. A cup wouldn&#39;t be enough, so I got a whole bowl.

My son, Ian, got the Avalon (Bison) burger and loved it... I was going to ask how he was enjoying it... but when I looked up from my own plate..it was gone! He also had a bowl of the Chicken and Sausage Gumbo (if I didn&#39;t want the Chili so bad... that&#39;s what I would have gotten too.. I love me some Gumbo) and said it was great (better than Heaven on Seven&#39;s?)

There are other reason&#39;s to like this place, they are nicely located in Downtown Naperville (Street and Garage Parking is free everywhere) and close to the Riverwalk (A big bowl of Chili AND a whole meal needs some after dinner activity!). They took over the old space long inhabited by Oswalds Pharmacy, it&#39;s a long narrow restaurant with entrances on both sides; north side at parking lot (always full, but big, free garage across the street) and south side on Jefferson.

Ted&#39;s also makes an effort at being environmentally friendly which somehow makes me feel better about making a pig out of myself when I&#39;m there."

We had four out of towners staying with us for New Years Eve so we decided to take them out to dinner on Tuesday December 30th. They are from down state so things like deep dish pizza, Portillos and Bison is something they do not get everyday. We tried to go to Lou&#39;s but there was a 90 minute wait so we came over to Ted&#39;s. Our wait was about 30 minutes for a party of 6 so we stood by the bar for a quick drink and were sat within about 25 minutes. 

We were promptly greeted by Matt, who was such a delight. He brought over the pickled cucumbers which are amazing. I had only been to Ted&#39;s once before and had 5 newbies so we were a bit lost with the menu. We all wanted to try bison but were unsure of the taste but Matt was so great to explain the similarities and differences of bison to ground beef.

All six of us ordered a different variety of bison burger, two bacon cheese, two cheese, one George&#39;s Cadillac and one green and hot. Everyone raved about what they had ordered. My cheese bison burger was phenomenal and may have been the best burger I have ever had. Our normally loud and chatty group was silent with the exceptions of yums and hmms.

The only downside we had with our night was the quite drafty door we were sitting near. The restaurant has two rotating doors on each end of it. We didn&#39;t want to complain because the restaurant doesn&#39;t have many 6 top tables and they were completely full. We did mention being chilly to Matt who then told the manager. Two minutes later, we heard the heat kick on. He also went to the rotating door we were near and pulled it so there were no gaps. 

Well done, Matt. We will definitely be returning and hope to see in your section again!"

In fact I am looking to just keep trying new restaurants in downtown Naperville because I love that they have so many charging station parking spaces for electric cars! 

I come to this area once a month for my quilt guild and meet a long time teacher pal. We used to always go to the same place and now we&#39;ve decided to try a different restaurant each month. When we get tired of that, we&#39;ll have a new strategy.

This restaurant was pretty empty around 4:15 when we entered. There were a few booths with patrons at the front. They sat us in the very first booth which is probably the least private booth in the whole restaurant where there were easily 30 empty tables available. Whatever.

Our server was very friendly, didn&#39;t hurry us but kept a nice pace. I adored the straws, they are paper. I wish all straws were paper!

I also really liked my bison burger, not dry at all. I had a sweet potato as my side and it was really delicious with yummy things to put in it.

My friend and I wanted to get two cookies and split an order of ice cream. Around 5:25 or so there was only one chocolate chip cookie left. Really? It&#39;s not like you&#39;re making them from scratch and Grandma has already gone to bed. These are frozen dollops you&#39;re baking. 

At any rate we split the cookie which was just an average chocolate chip cookie. I would go here for the burgers and sweet potatoes but skip dessert.

And we never got our coffee. Oh well, I stopped at Starbucks on the way home from Guild. 

Next month we&#39;ll try a new place. This one is 4 because the burger and the straws were outstanding."

We absolutely LOVED our food. And our waiter was the best we&#39;ve had in a really long time. Attentive, funny, and knowledgable. My only complaint is that our drinks seemed a little weak and were more mixer than alcohol. I also didn&#39;t like that I saw other waiters with their jeans sagging and boxers showing. It&#39;s a nice, pricier restaurant and if I&#39;m paying for an expensive dinner I don&#39;t want to have to stare at a 16 year old&#39;s boxers. Other than that, I&#39;d come back. And eat here everyday if I could."

Let&#39;s start with similarities: the food was excellent, we received our drinks quickly and they were well made, the restaurant was packed, the  service was decent, and they gave us weird cucumbers we never ate. 

Their wine selection is okay, but I always balk a bit at spending what I&#39;d pay for a bottle at Binny&#39;s on a just a glass. But I digress. Both times we visited (because I know what I like and I&#39;m super adventurous) I got the green and hot bison burger with the Bogle Petite Syrah. The burger was perfectly cooked, the wine brought out the heat without being murderous or bitter. My boyfriend got the Kansas City strip (bison) the second time we went paired with an old fashioned. His steak was amazing, cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the drink was beautifully presented. My mother got the salmon, which she loved, and his mother ordered the avalon burger, which she also loved. Like I said, the food is great. 

The first time we went we arrived around 7pm on a Friday night with no reservation. We were seated (slightly begrudgingly) within about 10 minutes, and by the front door. Which was freezing. This is my only complaint about our first visit, our service was good and you really can&#39;t expect much at that time with no reservation, we were lucky to be seated at all. 

The second time however, we received a much less warm reception. Since there were more of us, my boyfriend called ahead and made a reservation several hours in advance. One would think this adequate, no? Well we got to the restaurant, he left me and the moms off at the back entrance and went to park. My boyfriend&#39;s mother, I should note, has a very difficult time getting around and was visibly relying on me and a cane to make it in to the restaurant. We walked in and were told (as I already knew) that the hostess stand is up front, and we would have to go all of the way to the front of the restaurant to be seated or checked in with our reservation. Really? That seems a bit blind to tell a person with a visible handicap that they&#39;ll have to walk all of the way to the front. We ended up asking another waiter and he assured us this wasn&#39;t necessary. We told him we had a reservation, gave the name and he returned just as my boyfriend got in from parking to tell us there was no reservation under this name. Boyfriend assures him that yes, indeed, he made a reservation. Two men I assume are managers come back with the book and tell us very rudely that there is no reservation under his name. Boyfriend shows them that he had a several minute long phone call several hours previous to the restaurant&#39;s number. One manager assures the other that that isn&#39;t true (right in front of the customer no less) the other looks closely at the phone, then walks a few feet away to confer with other manager. After almost a minute he walks back and gestures roughly to a booth and says &#34;Just sit there,&#34; and walks off. We waited about another fifteen minutes for a waitress. I understand mix ups happen, but this just isn&#39;t how you deal with them."

I found it odd that it was on a forced wait but, this would be the beginning of a disappointing  experience.  I believe the hosts (a two person team) actually forgot about us. After 20 mins, an employee the manager I believe came and inquired what we are waiting for moments later we were sat.  The waitress took about ten minutes to greet us, we placed our order.  Our food came shortly afterwards, while eating no one came to check on us.  There were errors in our order, which we just had to deal with, I attempted to wave my server down but she continued to walk by with her head down.  We finished our food which was pretty tasty, despite the server issues.    I requested a dessert menu from my server. After receiving it, She disappeared for 30 minutes.  At this point, I just wanted to leave. After about 15 minutes I was able to pay and go. The staff on all levels really failed with exception to the cook.  For a dinner date, save yourself some irritation and try another place out in the area."

The hostess was great. There was a 45 minute wait, no room at the bar, so he took down our number to call us as we walked around downtown.

I loved the atmosphere. Very private booths (although we did not get to sit at one), and dimly lit, so it&#39;s quite romantic for an anniversary date.

After being seated, they brought us out pickled cucumbers. I thought that was kind of odd as a starter. No bread? But nevertheless they were pretty good.

Our waitress had no personality and talked as quiet as a mouse. She approached our table and I could hardly make out what she was saying. All I know is she said &#34;Hello, how are you tonight?&#34; to which we responded &#34;Good, thanks&#34;....and then she just stared at us. Uhhh are you going to ask us what we want to order?? There was a very long, awkward pause of us just staring at her until my husband finally said, &#34;Well I&#39;ll have the bison steak.&#34; and I ordered the mini bison burgers with fries. She didn&#39;t even ask us what we wanted to drink.

Some service for such a nice, expensive restaurant....

After waiting 30 minutes (which I think is a pretty long wait for two mini burgers and a steak), my food came out cold. Completely cold. I grabbed the waitress and asked her to have them make me a new one. She did, but again she mumbled so quietly, I don&#39;t even know if she had apologized for the mistake.

Then I waited...and I waited. My husband started to eat his because it was getting cold. He liked the bison steak a lot. Not chewy like regular steak and absolutely no fat. But for $32 dollars....he expected a little more. This thing was sooo small. It also came with asparagus and a baked potato. Both were nothing special. 

...And here I am still waiting on my food. It&#39;s been at least another 25 minutes. My husband is now done with his food, so I grabbed whatever waitress I could since ours hadn&#39;t been around and told them to cancel my order. I was beyond done waiting on this place and was absolutely starving aside from the three pickled cucumbers that sat in my stomach.

When the waitress came by she asked if I wanted the manager. Really? Why wouldn&#39;t you just send him/her over to begin with? Why are you asking me? You already know what the problem is. &#34;No I don&#39;t need to speak to a manager, just bring me the check.&#34;

When she brought out the check, she also brought me the bison burgers to go and removed it from our check. That was nice, but I&#39;m not gonna write a review on Ted&#39;s Montana Grill day old leftovers. 

Very disappointed, won&#39;t be back."

Our server was Judy; we gave her our drink order, which we received at 6:44. I was a bit aggrivated until she said all the computers suddenly went down. Understandable, it explained why all the servers were running around frantically from table to table. 

She took our appetizer order (St. Phillip&#39;s Island Crab Cake) and our entrees (a Blue Creek bison burger with an added fried egg for the birthday boy, and a Red Rock bison burger for myself).

First of all, the crab cake is probably the best I&#39;ve had in a long time, if ever! The handmade guacamole and coleslaw served along side of it is to die for. I wanted to slow down and savor it, but I found my plate cleared before the bf was halfway done with his.

The burgers arrived, and I was unsure how on earth I was going to eat this thing- it was huge!  I managed to &#34;smush&#34; it down a big, which definitely helped me dig in. Holy cow! (Err, holy bison???)  This was DEFINITELY the best burger I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;ve experienced bison before, but not like this. I was in heaven. 

The fries that come with the burgers were exceptional, and the portion is large. I barely dug through half of them.

By the end of our meal, we were both so full. The bf didn&#39;t save room for his double chocolate cookie with vanilla ice cream, but Judy, being the awesome server that she was, boxed it up for him to take home. 

I can&#39;t wait to go back here. I&#39;m so sad I haven&#39;t tried it sooner. I would definitely recommend Judy as a server, too."

We started with the chips appetizer and it was really good, nothing special but still tasted good! I got the Avalon burger (beef) which was Gruyère, blue cheese, bacon caramelized onions, roasted garlic aioli, and baby arugula. I ordered it well done and it tasted amazing! So good. I also got the broccoli as a side instead of the fries and it was very good but it&#39;s just 2 pieces. We were stuffed by the time we left so no dessert, but I will be back for sure!"

So, I mark them down a star because of this. 

However.... everything else about Ted&#39;s Montana Grill is amazing. I had a bison burger with bacon and blue cheese and it was absolutely out of this world. The meat was so juicy and tender. Our server (once we had been seated) was great and very attentive to our needs. The decor and ambiance inside the restaurant is great. Not too loud, not too bright or too dark.

We both enjoyed our meal. It was super busy, so service was slow.

We went again tonight. We enjoyed the cucumbers, they&#39;re surprisingly good! This time, I got the Avalon Burger and my hubby got the Green and Hot. He liked his burger. I thought the sauce was pretty good but the burger was messy and fell apart easily. I also thought the bison meat was crumbly and dryer than beef. I did not think there was enough sauce on the burger to compensate for the crumbly and dryness. I did like the fries though. They are medium sized- in between skinny and steak fries. Also, the waitress kept rushing us out. IE- we were only a few bites into our burgers and she asked if we were thinking about dessert. We said no, so she came back with the check immediately while we were halfway through our burgers. Also, she never asked if we wanted refills or new drinks. We had all finished our one cup before we finished our burgers. It was dinner time on a Friday so we understand it&#39;s busy, but she made it obvious she wanted to flip the table immediately.

My husband ordered the Big Sky Grilled Salad with Salmon.  He wanted to add some more protein so he asked how much it would be to put a grilled chicken breast on it. The waiter said it would add another $10 to the salad. For one chicken breast?!  Oy vey.

The look on my husband&#39;s face was hilarious. His mouth was open, so I tossed a few pickles in there (hoping it would keep his hunger at bay.)---In case you&#39;re wondering,  It didn&#39;t work.

I ordered the Ted&#39;s Chopped and even with omitting a few items, the salad came out fresh and large.

Two cocktails, two burgers and a kids meal is $70 with tip. That&#39;s a little high for a lunch. But that said, I love the food - I am responsible or eating all of those pickles on the table and generally asking for more. The bison is great - the portions are good and the restaurant is very pretty. The waitstaff is almost Stepford like. They check in frequently and sometimes they are slow to leave. It&#39;s not a complaint, more an observation. Certainly its better to find your waiter than not. Overall, I enjoy it I just wish it was a little more reasonable on the wallet.

On the other hand, Ted&#39;s is a chain, admittedly not a huge one and it&#39;s a higher end chain, but I rarely eat at them and they always disappoint....except Ted&#39;s.

I was instantly impressed by the menu, their bison burger options were incredible. Normally I sit down and there&#39;s a couple burger options and only one stands out as unique or remotely interesting. But Ted&#39;s has easily over a dozen truly unique and interesting burgers. These are high end top notch burgers they&#39;ve designed with everything from avocado to horseradish cheddar or melted gruyere. 

I had the Avalon, though I wanted to try a good four or five others. The Avalon comes with gruyere, blue cheese, crumbled bacon, caramelized onion, and roasted garlic aioli. Wow. Every bite was sheer heaven. Asked for medium, was cooked to perfection. The gruyere was the absolute perfect complement to the bison meat. And I loved the roasted garlic aioli (and that coming from one who&#39;s not a big fan of garlic). There was so much flavor, I don&#39;t even remember the crumbled bacon. My mouth is watering again just thinking of it.

One great tip, the burgers come with fries, but you can substitute the fries for onion rings. The fries are pretty good but nothing truly special. The onion rings on the other hand, superb, some of the best I&#39;ve had in a LONG time. 

The prices are a bit high in my opinion, but the food is so great and so delicious that it&#39;s worth paying a bit extra.

Overall I was disappointed with my experience at Ted&#39;s. First the host was unattentive when I was the only person in line and seemed to have an attitude when I requested a booth seat. I was seated at the very back of the restaurant near the door which had a constant cold draft due to the winter weather. The waitress was nice and attentive. I was presented with a small dish of pickles which I have to say were delicious and my girlfriend and I ate right up. We ordered the soup of the day which was chicken tortilla. The soup was very flavorful and had a nice kick to it. I ordered the $17 Red Rock bison burger (medium) with 50/50 onion rings and fries. The burger took almost 30 minutes to arrive. To sum it up, the burger was dry, overcooked, had no flavor, and was nothing special by any means. The fries were somewhat warm and not very fresh.

I started with a perfectly prepared Tanqueray martini, shaken, not stirred, it was gin perfection! I followed with bison pot roast served with garlic mashed potatoes, gravy, and green beans. The bison pot roast was delicious, a little stronger beef flavor than regular beef.  The potatoes, with a perfect level of garlic and butter. The green beans were prepared perfectly, with a little sauteed onion &amp; garlic. What can I say, it was comfort food perfection. My husband&#39;s salmon was perfect, served with a piquant horseradish sauce.  We split a chocolate brownie, served warm with caramel and Kahlua chocolate sauce for dessert. OMG, I can&#39;t remember when I&#39;ve had a more perfect dessert!  We will definitely be back.  Btw, the bison comes from Ted Turner&#39;s Montana  ranch."

Ok. For realz now.  Here&#39;s my review: 2.5

Came in to grab a small bite with my friend K.O.  I don&#39;t remember why but we just decided to dine at the bar.  We were greeted by the barkeep and got some menus.  We needed a couple minutes to review them so we did just that... but then for an additional 15 minutes! Why? Because there was no waiter or bartender in sight!  I was like whaaaa???  It was like 3:30PM on a Thursday and it barely any patrons. Come on!  Anyway, we eventually  got our order in.

Sooo, once we got our food, we couldn&#39;t help notice that the kitchen and wait staff were just standing around the border of the kitchen and bar.  Some were even eating right there, clearly visible, which I don&#39;t think you&#39;re suppose to do.  Oh, there were also a lot of people, who assumed were management walking in and out of the back room nearby the bar.  Just kinda distracting and kinda odd....

Anyway, we both got appetizers; the bison sliders and the bison nachos.  The bison sliders with the corn biscuit were pretty great but the nachos were so-so.  

Food was aiight and the service was kinda eh.  Maybe they were having an off day, who knows.  I won&#39;t them write them off just yet but my first impression... not so good."

Typically it seems in suburban restaurants &#34;rare&#34; is &#34;medium,&#34; &#34;medium&#34; is &#34;well,&#34; and &#34;well&#34; is... Well, I don&#39;t even know how you classify a burger that burnt. You people who like their meat cooked how they order it know what I&#39;m talking about!

I&#39;m sort of confused by the reviews here that mention small portions, as a trip to Ted&#39;s almost always induces the food sweats for me. A couple tips- Don&#39;t skimp on the salad. The wedge with blue cheese (and crumbles) is heavenly. Also, swap out your fries for garlic mashed potatoes, you&#39;ll thank me later. ...Not that the fries are bad, but, man, those mashed potatoes. If I could fit it in the trunk of my car, I&#39;d just bring a 55 gallon drum for them to fill up.

Docked a star because it seems like there&#39;s almost always a considerable wait whenever we come here. I guess it&#39;s good that a restaurant is that busy, but, the typical (at least in my experience) 20ish minute wait isn&#39;t that fun. If they did reservations via OpenTable or a similar online system, I&#39;d be all over that."

Usually I stick to ordering one of the many buffalo burgers they offer, none of which will disappoint you in the slightest! 

This time I ordered the ribeye as I was craving a steak. I should have ordered the filet as the ribeye was underwhelming to say the least. It really had no flavor at all and very little if any seasoning. This was the first time I have been disappointed in a meal at Teds! 

Stick to the buffalo burgers, I would recommend the kitchen sink burger with the fried egg! They also have the best fresh lemonade!

The waiter brought out a delicious plate of biscuit-like bread.  It was really good, flakey yet thick.

My chili had the perfect amount of heat to it.  There was a generous amount of meat and the flavors of the sauces, peppers, beans, and cheeses really mixed well together. The Caesar salad was nothing really special; in fact, a few pieces of the Romaine were a little wilted. I just picked around it and enjoyed the ones that were crispy (it was only a side salad)."

I had two options for my chicken sandwhich...not very pleased about that!  The service was HORRIBLE!!!

My husbands meal was incorrect, my chicken was kind of gross, which is SO disappointing because we would go to the Schaumburg location on a regular basis and loved it!

It has a great location within walking distance of a number of other destinations in cute downtown Naperville. There is a free parking lot immediately behind the restaurant.

The ambiance is masculine. Impressive brass spinning doors with what seems like bison hair seals greet you, and when you arrive inside the imposing bison bust on the wall above the bathrooms immediately catches your eye and has everyone remark at how massive and majestic of an animal it is. Everything has an old-time American feel, lots of dark wood inside with naturalist paintings of western bison herds on the wall and antique mirrors. Lighting is brighter than dim below medium lit. You can see the kitchen on the walk to your seat, everything is very clean. There are many private high-walled booths for four, creating a cozy and private feeling. They have two coat hooks at the end of each one making it super comfortable on a cool or cold day to hang your hat jacket or winter coat. Coat hooks in Chicago always make me happy I don&#39;t know why everyone doesn&#39;t extend that comfort to their guests anymore.

As soon as we arrived they provided a surprisingly refreshing bowl of sliced, lightly pickled cucumbers. Everyone enjoyed them.

The Menu: as you can see it&#39;s impressive with both innovative and classically satisfying uses for bison. The bison Nachos were clean and tasty. My wife had a salad that they put a bison burger on top of, my mother a &#34;duo&#34; mini bison burger plate with fries, and my dad and I each had the ribeye bison steak. All were great. 

Because Bison is dry, not tasty, and unpleasant when overcooked, and plus since bison roam free without any of the e.coli (from feeding cows corn) or mad cow disease problems of beef, they have slid their cooking scale down a bit in regards to rare, med rare etc. I agree because otherwise too many people wouldn&#39;t like bison if it was always cooked like beef. The waiter has an illustrated card of what their &#39;rare, medium rare, medium&#39; etc mean to them. *** Look at it! *** I usually get rare and ordered my steak medium rare, and I got rare. My father ordered medium and it was what we would call medium rare. 

Both were excellent and full of flavor, and I loved the little American flags stick into the food. We had the asparagus and yellow squash casserole sides. The asparagus were good, not excellent, but with the steak&#39;s lemon butter on them they were absolutely excellent. The squash casserole had someone&#39;s aunt&#39;s name on it, so it should have been much tastier than it was. I was totally underwhelmed by it and that&#39;s a shame because I was so excited to try what sounded so good. The roll was delicious and flaky.

My wife ordered her burger medium though and got medium well, so it was dry and not so good at all. My mother ordered medium and received medium as we understand it, not as their picture showed which was slightly red then pink in the middle. So overall they need to get a little more consistent with their cooking.

The waiter (I forgot his name) was a middle-aged man and truly excellent. He was very clear and courteous, and patient, while being attentively &#34;Johnny on the spot.&#34; When my beer was almost gone he soon asked if I wanted another. He brought everything in perfect time- not too fast where you feel rushed out and not too slow where you have to wonder where it was. He never interrupted our conversations once (a pet peeve of mine) in all his visits, and the one time he had to ask us something when he approached while we were talking, he waited until the end of the sentence, for us to turn to him, said &#34;excuse me&#34; before immediately asking his question. The check wasn&#39;t too rushed either. We were all impressed with his service and left a big tip. 

They gave me a cookie ice cream dessert for my birthday which was tasty.

This may be one of my favorite restaurants now.

I removed one star because:
-I love making bison and make it better myself at home with my secret recipe. I was hoping they would cook it with an herb or something for some pleasant taste and aroma highlights, and I expected it to be more seared on the outside by default.
-The side dishes could have been more succulent: better asparagus exists as do tastier squash casseroles
-My wife&#39;s burger was overcooked by our standards, and way overcooked by theirs.
-I didn&#39;t see any corn bread on the menu, which would have been a nice, preferable option for the roll."

DInner rolls were requested promptly upon being seated.  (Ask, or they won&#39;t bring it to you.  Dinner rolls are much superior to pre-dinner pickles.)   A side of onion rings was ordered as an appetizer.  It comes with horsey sauce - delicious!

For the first time ever, I didn&#39;t order a burger here.  Instead, I opted for the crabcake entree.  It was justly $24 because of the abundance of crab, and they had a nice, smoked flavor.  The side of asparagus was bland though, as was the butternut squash casserole, and my mom&#39;s beer can chicken.  Don&#39;t be afraid of salt and pepper, people!  Or flavor for that matter!

Went on a Friday a little after 6 p.m. and while it was 80%+ full, the service was fast and attentive. Pros include the wedge salad-freshly cooked and crumbled bacon is always good! The meatloaf sandwich was decent, but the green beans (perfect amount of seasoning and well-cooked) were a highlight. 

My son ordered the kids steak and it was undercooked quite a bit. We had cut it into pieces and they took it back and came out with a new steak, which was cooked perfectly as ordered and the manager took it off the bill. An unexpected positive-wasn&#39;t that big of a deal, but it was the sort of attention and gesture that won&#39;t soon be forgotten. 

The service and speed was the factor that brought it up to 4 stars-a good place to eat and a good variety on the menu beyond beef or bison. Their lemonade is a must order-fresh and over crushed ice. 

The main hallway has tables on one side, booths on the other and the middle is a little narrow-part of being in an old town building setting, so if you can it in the very front or bar area, I&#39;d recommend that."

These are some of the best crab cakes full of crab that I have ever had! It came with a cole slaw that was amazing and fresh asparagus. Alos guacamole whihc was different wit crab but delicious!

We asked to be seated in the corner sofa area. Were told by the host that someone would come bring us the menus in a bit. A woman came over...handed us the food menu...at that time we were also notified that the kitchen was closing in 5 minutes so we had to give our order quickly....at which time we notified her that we were here for wine n desserts only. She continued to stare....so then i asked what wines do you have? She went to get the wine menu. I thought maybe i should know what wine we wanted...lol.
After looking it over...i decided to get a cappacino...n my friend got the cheesecake n some wine...i cant remember. While bringing the wine to us...the host seated 5 more people....2 seperate groups...me n my friend just looked at eachother coz we saw our server roll her eyes and literally clang down the wine glass...oh boy. Very unprofessional. At this time it was about 930??
After that...we didnt really see her much except to give us the bill (at that time she mumbled bout being sorry to rush us b4 coz apparantly they dont have a closing time....etc etc...)....a guy came over to us to ask if we wanted refills on our waters, wine or coffee...we said just water please. And then we left... that was the service....now for the food...
OMG!! sooo rich...soo good...soo worth the attitude...lol....already luv their coffee...and desserts from the other side...so no suprise we luved the cheesecake! Only thing i would change was...i was not able order desserts from other side to enjoy there with my friend&#39;s wine and my cappicino. I wouldve luved to enjoy the creme brulee but they didnt have it on the menu...

At all. Had this been a one time thing, I probably wouldn&#39;t be writing this review because I&#39;ve been a long time customer of All Chocolate Kitchen and absolutely love it. That said, we also were interested in ordering a cake from ACK for a birthday celebration last fall and were given the name and number of someone we were supposed to contact regarding this. After several calls and never reaching this person, we ultimately took that business elsewhere. I get it, you&#39;re a popular business and maybe you don&#39;t have the manpower or hours in a day to accommodate everyone, but it&#39;s still extremely rude to not even bother getting back to people to say something along the lines of &#34;we&#39;re completely booked but we have other dates/times available.&#34; 

That all said, I&#39;d love to be able to give your business a try and be able to say something positive. Maybe tell your reservations person that in the professional world, you&#39;re actually expected to return calls by the end of the business day?"

Upon arrival, the hostess was so excited for my boyfriend and me to experience the restaurant for the first time and gave us an explanation of the artwork in the restaurant (all made of candy and/or chocolate!!) We started with a cheese plate that did not disappoint. It was the perfect size for its price and included some amazing jams, mustards, and breads. We were also given a bread basket that was constantly being refilled with warm bread and crackers. The two of us ordered and split the short rib and risotto for our main course. They were perfect sizes to share and we couldn&#39;t decide which one we liked better. Of course, we were so excited to try the desserts and ended up ordering two because we just couldn&#39;t decide. We ordered the flourless chocolate cake and the devil&#39;s food cake...both came with homemade whipped cream and strawberries, which were to die for! 

I am so glad I got the chance to experience dinner at Primo and look forward to eating here again in the near future!"

THIS VENUE IS AMAZING! Attention to detail and service were superior. I host events often and was absolutely blown away. The atmosphere was colorful and featured striking pieces of art (made by Chef of course)!

The food was beautiful in presentation and each course was delicious. They also catered to our guests with food allergies wonderfully with attractive dishes that were equally as tasty. 

The wines were thoughtfully paired with the foods we were enjoying!

The service was out of this world. I am blown away at the level of care this team took. There was never a missing fork or a dirty napkin. They anticipated our needs and made the experience an uninterrupted one, allowing conversation to flow seamlessly among the guests.

I assumed for dessert we&#39;d get something unique and magical, so I was a little disappointed, but it was still delicious.    

Unfortunately, we had to jump through hoops to make a reservation. We called, emailed, and even walked into the restaurant, and couldn&#39;t get anybody to take our reservation. With this type of impossible reservation system, I don&#39;t see how they can stay in business. The night we went to Primo, there were only two other tables with diners."

One cannot fail but to be impressed by the giant Catherine wheel/windmill dripping chocolate, the giant sugar art. Music maybe a tad too loud for this crowd, I overheard other tables saying the same.
Menus magically light up when opened, another great idea.
Hostess explained the art and the concept , which was appreciated.
Charcuterie boards are all the rage currently and here the focus is on creating your own from the large selection of cheeses and meat. We ordered 6 cheeses from the 10 and we found the cheeses slightly wanting in flavour, The Red Dragon (welsh chddear with wine) didn&#39;t live up to the hype, I would have preferred a great Montgomery or Cornish Cruncher cheddar for flavour. Being a french  influenced menu it was nice to see so many french regional cheese, but I would have added an Epoisses de Bourgoune, (strong) for breadth and Tomme Savoie likewise. The cheese was well presented with mustard, oil, balsamic and delicious bread and flat cracker.
We had a bottle of champagne that was both reasonably priced and well chosen before the cheese.My small ding was that our waitress was happily opening the bottle with showing us beforehand, a basic faux pas.
Lamb entree was classic southern Lamb shank over beans , simply delicious. Crfemini Risotto perfectly cooked. Both absolute winners. A bottle of Cahors was perfect choice for us. One of our party enjoyed the Reisling by the glass.
Dessert , as you would expect, matched the entrees. How could it not. 
3 Observations
1.Successfully creating a completely different atmosphere once through the sliding doors, this is spoiled by having to use the ACK bathroom, waiting in line behind 3 kids and 2 adults for 15 minutes detracted from the experience
2. There was a young man in a suit walking around the relatively small restaurant; i assumed sommelier or such. Never found out. Seemed incongrous.
3. With Chef Roby&#39;s talent, make some desserts just for Primo if you want to maintain the atmosphere of both exclusivity and magic

A welcome addition to Geneva for sure and please place a cassoulet on menu in winter."

Everything ordered in our party was delicious. The service was very good. And while some reviewers have suggested that the prices are a bit high, the quality of the food was worth it. For starters we ordered the bruschetta with prosciutto--incredible. We also ordered the sausage, peppers and onions -- again, incredible. For entrees, the group selected braciola with grilled polenta, shrimp Vincitori, butternut squash ravioli, and the breaded steak sandwich. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their entrees and shared the goods. To cap it all off, we split pieces of the homemade cheesecake with strawberry sauce on one and caramel on the other.

There were 3 servers taking care of the whole party (two female one male). The first impression I got from the two female servers was not a good one. They stood by the server station staring at the entire party and when I got up to go to the bathroom I overheard them gossiping about a few of my family members. The male server definitely made up for it he was great and even cracked a few jokes with us! 

When the food came out I was not impressed. Everything looked and tasted as though it were a day old. Presentation was less than mediocre.  

We had a reservation until 4. Once the clock hit 3 we were told we needed to hurry up and leave at least 6 times. Not ok. 

We had a few issues when the bill came too. They charged us for people who didn&#39;t show up, charged full adult price for a 5 year old child, and charged $5 for virgin mock tails that were pretty much just pineapple juice. We asked to speak to the owner who was a complete ass to my confused mother who was just trying to pay for what she got (which was nothing special whatsoever). 

I&#39;ve worked in many restaurants over the years and have never been so appalled by the attitude of a staff. Needless to say I&#39;ll never be going back and I&#39;m spreading the word!"

However, the food was just mediocre and small-portioned (4 strips of baked chicken with a small scoop of mashed potatoes and 2 stalks of asparagus).  The gelato was served 100% rock-solid frozen, so I had to wait for it to thaw.  The worst part was the rest of the serving staff; they rushed the party out of the dining area 30 min before the party was set to end so they could set up for public dining. All but the male server seemed to have an attitude toward the guests. I don&#39;t see any reason to try this restaurant again. Not a good 1st impression!"

We didn&#39;t have reservations, but had no problem getting a booth in the bar area. We chose the bar because there were two crooners entertaining. The restaurant is dimly lit and intimate. It isn&#39;t a very large restaurant. The hostess was friendly and once we were seated, we were brought water and a bread basket right away. The bread was warm crusty bread served with olive oil and Parmesan cheese. Paco was our server and was friendly and attentive. He was a very nice guy and I would request him again.  My husband and I had a glass of Chianti with dinner. Since it was late we did not order appetizers or soup or salad. I think the soup and salad are al la carte since I didn&#39;t see anything on the menu that it was included with the entrees. My husband ordered the Vincitori rigatoni.  The pasta had Italian sausage, ground beef, crispy pancetta, fennel and onions in a creamy light sauce with romano cheese. I snuck a taste and it was full of flavor and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. I had the gnocchi lamb bolognese.  The gnocchi were light pillows served with a wonderful red sauce with ground lamb dolloped with ricotta cheese on top. I thought it would be heavy but it surprisingly was not. The portions were not huge like most places so there were no doggie bags...of course, we enjoyed our meal so much, I think we would&#39;ve still cleaned our plates even with a larger portion. During dinner the crooners sang a few Elvis tunes when I said I liked their Elvis songs. Very nice of them.  The owner came by for a chat and told us we needed to try one of their house-made desserts so we ordered the cannoli to split. It was fabulous with a crispy shell filled with a not-too-sweet creamy ricotta cheese filing and dipped in pistachios and decadent chocolate on one end. So good!  I definitely liked this small restaurant and would go back. I understand there are Groupons, as well as Restaurant.com coupons. You can also find coupons on their website.  Good deal!"

We alerted the hostess who indicated he would be our server as well.  He then came and took our order, noticed the busboy did not leave cheese for the bread and brought some.

The food was mediocre which is not good since it is very expensive,   One of our orders was brought out not prepared correctly and the server stated he remembered.   Not sure why he didn&#39;t notice as he brought it to the table.   The food was not very flavorful and not well prepared.   Also took a long time to come out.

Service was indifferent and somewhat cold.   We drank the carafe a water and they took the empty away.   Later we had to ask to get another carafe.  One in our party was only drinking water.

My boyfriend and I had somewhere to be later that night, so we got there at 4pm - right as they opened. Now I understand that workers are still arriving and what not, but the manager&#39;s attitude kind of rubbed me the wrong way. To explain, the manager continued to talk to different people on the wait staff to tell them to pick things up or ask them about their lives. I get doing that as a manager, but when you&#39;re talking across a dining room, regardless if only one table is taken, it kills the ambience for the guests! Not to mention, he didn&#39;t ask once how we were doing or if we liked the food. Instead, he sat at the bar and watched the BYU game while talking to everyone else!

Okay, now that that&#39;s covered, the food is delicious! We ordered the grilled calamari and an appetizer pizza for our appetizers, we split the frutti de mare (seafood pasta) for our main course, and had the tiramisu for dessert. The food was fantastic - it&#39;s something different but in a good way. On top of the food being great, our waiter, Will, was also awesome. Easy to talk to, had great recommendations, and very attentive. 

I most likely would have given Vincitori a 4-5 star rating if the manager didn&#39;t kill the mood. I felt like I was at a docking station right from the start instead of an intimate Italian restaurant. I feel like professionalism has been a killer for this place."

Made a 5pm reservation using Open Table. 

Got there maybe 4:50pm.... This snotty young Caucasian receptionist was like.... &#34;Your reservation is 5pm but uhm ok... Let me get you a table&#34;

Hmmm.... Can you be a little more boring and un- inviting?!!!? Grrrrr

Then gave us a tiny table .... I was like looking around.... Maybe 3 tables had patrons but pretty much an empty restaurant at that time. 

I asked her to give us a bigger table... she said.... &#34;Let me see what I can do&#34;

I was like.... You&#39;re kidding right? This joint is empty!!!! Gosh.. 

Soooo that was not a good start.... One star gone for sure....

Now our waiter, Antonio... was friendly.... We like him


We ordered the following:

Estancia Cabernet Sauvignon bottle $32 

Stuffed Banana Peppers $9.95 - a tad bit spicy but very tasty

Roasted red pepper clam soup $3.95 (got two) -- good but has more potato than clam 

Grilled chicken w/ mushroom risotto $20 -- good

Duck w/ butternut squash ravioli $30 -- very good

At first... They brought a very well done duck... My BF who never complains was like.... Antonio, you don&#39;t serve Duck well done do you? Can you ask the chef to give me a medium rare duck? 

After 10 mins.... Antonio brought the perfect duck.,, with a little pink in the middle ...

Good thing my BF saw that right away... Otherwise, they would serve a yucky tough duck to us for $30... 

Nooooo way!!!!

Banana beignets -- very good

Cappuccino -- very good

Bill was &amp;127 minus $40 groupon = $87 plus 20% tip

Verdict: ok with Groupon.... Otherwise, will go somewhere else"

The restaurant had become a cliche, with a very loud Frank Sinatra type singer, who quite honestly disrupted our ability to have a conversation. Add to that walls and walls of Rat Pack artwork.

The atmosphere is so nice and the entire staff was very accommodating to our large group!  The food they made us for our lunch was delicious and the service was outstanding!  They put a champagne bar together for us and were very generous with the drinks.  The owner Bob is such a nice guy!   He felt bad about sending his chef home early, so he ran out and bought all the guys (hanging out at the bar during the bridal shower) burgers and fries because he wanted to make sure they had food to eat as well.  I would recommend Vincitori to anyone looking to host an event!"

You could easily bathe the baby in that. No kidding. The best part is that we ordered this to share by two of us and we didn&#39;t order anything else for the third person who came about 20 minutes late. After we saw this dish, we knew this could easily feed three of us. And to make it better it was Delicious.

Please don&#39;t judge me. I might have an addition with seafood and Marinara sauce. And they cooked the pasta just right so the noodles absorbed enough flavor from the sauce but still chewy. I loved it. 

The kid&#39;s pizza was huge as 10 inch and very thin crust. My daughter tried very hard to finish 1/3 of it. 

The lobby was nice and dark themed with huge drawings on the wall. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. He was one to recommend the Fruitti Di Mare and said it is more than enough for you two. Thanks!"

The food is made fresh, so you can expect to be dining for longer then usual but the wait is worth the time.
 I did make a mistake in not ordering the French Onion soup, two other people in my party did and I was jealous! I did have the minestrone soup and it was very tasty. For a main course I enjoyed the lasagna, it was done to perfection, noodles were cooked just right and the cheese and sauce were perfectly proportioned. It was delightful eating every bite! I was not happy with the bread, maybe just a little too dry for me, even with the oil.
 The service was awesome, we did have reservations, so we were seated promptly. Our waiter was awesome and he created a delightful dinning experience!
 We will return to Vincitori!"

As a non-Italian, I thought the food was really good.  We ordered fried calamari and I got the chicken limone over linguini.   There could have been a little more calamari in the dish, but it was good.  Served with a shrimp sauce, and a wanna be tarter sauce....meh.  The chicken limone was great, super moist (and I hate that word) and great flavor.  The sauce over it was great too over the linguini....yum. I wouldn&#39;t mind some more, right now...please?

The Italian bf had the cavatelli and vodka.... Looked good and smelled great.  He said the vodka sauce was too tomato-y.  I tried a bite, and would agree.  But overall &#34;it was just okay&#34;. 

I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to go here again.  Reasonable prices, nice atmosphere, good food.  Over all, a pretty good place.

We started with the sausage and peppers. This is definitely a good meal starter. Spicy and flavorful, a tad greasy though. 

I had the acorn squash ravioli. It was pretty good, nice and tasty. Unfortunately it was warm and not hot.

I also tried the half chicken. I&#39;ll pass on that dish. It wasn&#39;t the most desirable. The flavor was only on the skin. Not a good dish.

As far as service, Frank was ok. I felt he should&#39;ve been a little more attentive given the fact that we were the only table there. The water carafe was often empty for too long."

We arrive on time and are immediately seated.  Our waiter approaches and kinda gives is a run down...but starts by saying that &#34;all items are made from scratch and there is a longer than usual wait time&#34; when ordering.   He takes drink orders and skips both of my children and myself.  When he returns 10 minutes later I let him know he missed us (how he didn&#39;t realize it is beyond me).  He is rushed and very rude.

We order appetizers for the table.  Calamari, Burrata and Baked Clams.  With a table of 10, you would expect for this to be sufficient.  Nope.  The calamari was skimpy and not at all tasty.  The naked clams were &#34;ok&#34; and the Burrata was moderately good. They were gone in minutes and 3 people didn&#39;t eat any.  The bread was hard and the plate of parmesan and oil was a joke.

Our table ordered everything from Chicken Picatta to lasagna to pizza to sausage and peppers to need medallions.  Please reference, &#34;everything is made from scratch&#34;...we waited 1.25 hours for our food to arrive.  I ordered the chicken picatta and it was the worst I had ever had.  The pasta was NOT homemade as I have eaten homemade pasta since I was a child...this was not homemade.  The penne was not either.  The one thing I can give them credit for is their sauce...it was amazing as the only reason they get 2 stars.  

After almost 3 hours of dining...we all left &#34;content&#34; but far from stuffed and happy.  We were all full but no one raved about anything.  Did I mention that our server failed to take food orders for my kids as well?  Ugh...just a hot mess from beginning end.  Won&#39;t ever go back..."

It took us a week to get a reservation at a convenient time.  Use the phone number listed for this business info and NOT the one on the groupon ~ it is the fax number.

Place was jam packed and I mean jam PACKED.  There are really only 1 or 2  &#34;nice&#34;  tables in the whole place.  Others are sooooooooooooooooooo close to each other that you will definitely know your neighbor by the time you are finished, if you did not know them before.  I found the timing for  &#34;reserved&#34; tables to be a little strange.  There were a number of tables that remained unoccupied the entire time we were there.  Someone could have been seated and served and on their way without any imposition on the reservation.

Our server was initially &#34;on the cool side&#34;  but improved as the meal progressed.  I understand from other reviewers that servers are an issue.  If you find one that works for you ~ request them.

It looked like there was a room for private parties at the back, I don&#39;t understand why they don&#39;t open that area when not in use for a private party to accommodate more diners.  Waiting an hour in the bar area, or the front door area, is not pleasant.

The singer in the bar was great.  I could have listened to him all night.

The food was okay, I would go back.  It is not a Capri (as in Burr Ridge NOT Downers Grove ~ which is awful) but waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than Clara&#39;s or Carrabba&#39;s."

As the other yelpers noted the wait was very long, we sat by the bar and had a clear view of the kitchen doors with windows. I saw what looked to be my order come up, i knew it was because of the large bowl they serve it in. The dish was fruti de mare a dish with muscles, clams and other shellfish. The owner walks up to the dish and starts putting his fingers into it rearranging the muscles  giving the ones that did not open to the chef (the dead ones) all the while he is licking his f ing fingers! I couldn&#39;t believe it! When i questioned our waiter about it he said oh hes the head chef and he wouldnt put dirty hands in my food.

I highly recommend reservations. It is a tightly packed restaurant and felt very crowded and loud. It also felt pretty dark. It was so dark that my mom actually walked into the men&#39;s bathroom instead of the ladies&#39; room because she couldn&#39;t read the sign on the door!!! :) 

We appreciated the live music. 

Plan A LOT of time for your dinner- they make your food as you order it and our meal lasted three hours. It felt like we were there for a long time. We appreciated the quality of the food. 

The service was unique. I felt our server was irritated a lot of the time with us but my parents thought he was incredible. He shook my husband&#39;s and father&#39;s hand at the end of the meal which was a nice touch.

They bring out basic white bread and butter or oil with cheese. They didn&#39;t refill the cheese. The portions are large. I had the sausage and peppers with penne and was able to eat a lot there and then have three leftover meals with what I took home! Other dishes were richer so were smaller portions- my husband had the Mussels special and finished it at the restaurant. My mom loves the lasagna- it is very cheesy- and my husband enjoyed her leftovers later in the week. My mom says the black currant iced tea is the best she&#39;s had. My dad had the rigatoni which he said was good but also very cheesy. I don&#39;t care for cheese so had a hard time finding something I would like on the menu.

I had the chocolate lava cake with strawberry sauce for dessert- it was presented beautifully and was delicious. It cost $7. My mom really enjoyed her burnt caramel gelato. 

We thought it was funny that my husband was going through his water so fast that all of the sudden someone plopped a bigger glass of water in front of him- probably so they didn&#39;t have to refill it so often. 

I don&#39;t think I would come back again but I&#39;m happy that my parents enjoy it so much. It is a classy restaurant with quality food (and you pay for the quality) and they do a great business."

To drink, I ordered the split bottle of moscato -- delicious. We ordered the grilled calamari to begin, which was very good. I recommend this appetizer. Then I ordered a garden salad with their balsamic vinaigrette. For a standard garden salad, I really enjoyed it. For my entree, I ordered the garlic-crusted chilean sea bass from the specials of the day. It was good, but the it wasn&#39;t really garlic &#34;crusted.&#34; The garlic was more just placed on top.

My father and I arrived first and we were seated as we waited for my wife to arrive. When I informed our waiter this, he seemed frustrated by it. He never introduced himself, so I&#39;m unable to call him by name in this review. He was a stalkier Hispanic man with his hair slicked straight back and what seemed like the inability to smile.

When my wife arrived, he took our drink orders and again seemed frustrated, this time because we didn&#39;t order from the wine menu. I would later order a Jack and Coke, which was horribly watered down.

He took our order and our food came quickly enough. There weren&#39;t too many people there on a Wednesday night. The food was ok. I had the center cut filet with a side of asparagus. The asparagus was undercooked, but the steak was a nice medium rare that I asked for. My wife ordered the home made cavatelli pasta. She said it was overcooked, with chunks of Parmesan throughout. My dad got the Shrimp Vincitori. He said it was ok and could have used larger shrimp.

I had set my phone at the edge of the table so the waiter could verify it. Without asking for my phone, he just picked it up and started looking around the screen. He quickly stated that the Groupon wasn&#39;t valid because we didn&#39;t have a party of 4. This was the first time hearing a detail like this after using LivingSocial, Groupon, and Restaurant.com. The waiter, clearly having gone through this problem with another guest, pulled up the fine print where it stated this.

I will be following up with Groupon with questions and to voice my concern that deal isn&#39;t very clear, but what followed at the restaurant was RIDICULOUS!

I admitted that sometimes you can miss that small print. I first asked if he&#39;d be able to overlook the number in our party. No. I then asked if they&#39;d simply redeem the amount that I paid Groupon, which was $39. No. At this point I asked to speak with a manager. Minutes passed and the waiter came back without the manager, stating that nothing could be done. I asked to see a copy of the bill. He brought back a bill for just over $100. When I bought the Groupon, I didn&#39;t plan on paying anything more then tax and tip. Now I&#39;m looking at $115 with a basic tip. I asked 3-4 more times to speak with the manager, to no avail.

At this point, if the manager wasn&#39;t going to be decent enough to come out and speak with me, then I decided I was done negotiating about the bill. We got up and left. The waiter was close behind to take a picture of my license plate.

I got about a mile north on Cass before being pulled over by the Westmont police. I have to give it to them, they were fast!

The officers were civil and said that this wasn&#39;t the first call they had received about Vincitori&#39;s and Groupon. They said I&#39;d have to return to pay the bill and file a complaint with Groupon about the fine print OR if I didn&#39;t, they&#39;d arrest me for theft.

I decided not to sit in jail, so we went back.

When I arrived, the waiter gladly took my credit card, with a smile on his face for the first time the whole evening...

Another man was standing behind the bar mashing away on the computer. I asked if he was the manager. He proceeded to confirm that and also cuss me out for my indiscretions, without allowing me a word in edge wise. As he&#39;s dropping profanities, a woman and her elderly mother were attempting to leave and the old woman had a look of disgust as she heard his language. I opened the door for the women and ushered them out, apologizing on his behalf. He quickly came out from behind the bar and continued his profanity laced tirade. The police officers who were monitoring all this had to ask him to calm down and step back into the restaurant.

I wish I could give zero or negative stars to properly warn others about the horrible service and management here. Do yourself a favor and get your money back from Groupon if you&#39;ve gotten one for here!"

Stopped in for dinner after purchasing the recent Groupon. Got in around 5pm, and had no problem getting a table for 5. Atmosphere was intimate, however bordering an almost dismal feel (Light it up a bit!). Advised the server off the bat we were using a Groupon, which wasn&#39;t a hassle (some places look at you like an idiot when you have one) and did not exclude anything from the dinner menu - Sweet. Water and warm bread came quick (great with oil and Parmesan), but everything else seemed to be at a slower pace. Not terrible, just slower. Ordered drinks, including a $35 bottle of Chenin Blanc (later stopped at Binny&#39;s and got the same bottle for $10.99 - FAIL), and the Stuffed Banana Peppers app. Peppers were a little watery, but tasty, had a nice fiery spice, and plenty for two people. Dinner &amp; Caesar salads served were run-of-the-mill, nothing out of the ordinary. Entrees followed after a short while, comprised of the Beef Medallion Trio with Asparagus (Garlic, Bleu Cheese, and Horseradish Medallions), Braciola with Grilled Polenta, Shrimp Vincitori (for the kid, actually an appetizer), and Grilled Salmon. Two of the three medallions were great (Garlic &amp; Bleu Cheese), but the Horseradish needs a quick 86 from the tasty Trio. While not as overpowering as some horseradish dishes I have had, it only took away from what were some great, succulent pieces of meat (Server advised we can substitute after the fact...two Garlics would have been bliss). The included asparagus spears were unfortunately undercooked and under-seasoned. My wife&#39;s Braciola with Polenta was &#34;eh, not bad&#34;, however a dish which will definitely be skipped if we ever make it back to Vincitori (I think it was a bit lacking in the taste department). No complaints today from the Grilled Salmon group (didn&#39;t try it, but looked appealing). The Shrimp Vincitori received rave reviews from my eight year old, which is always great. Devoured in minutes, with the white wine, cream, and cheese sauce the element which put the dish over the top. 

A family of five, a $40 Groupon, and still a bill of over $150. I&#39;ll say the service was very attentive and friendly, and more than met our expectations. Regrettably, I can&#39;t say the same for the food, especially considering most entrees fall in the $18-$35 range. Like I said earlier, Good Italian food, average atmosphere, great service, but very overpriced, both food and drinks. Bring plenty of time and money..."

The stuffed artichoke was delicious!

Pastas were a bit heavy on the sauce (especially the rigatoni, whose portion was huge), but I understand that Americans sort of expect that. (Being Italian I prefer my pasta with less.)

I recently went to Wildfire--and I think that Vincitori may just have them beat in both price and quality.  The chicken vesuvio is comparable in both--but at Vincitori, it comes with these awesome, crispy potato wedges.  At every other Italian place it comes with soggy red potatoes soaked in the gravy (not bad, but not nearly as good).  

My favorite is generally their caramelized eggplant and goat cheese with gemelli pasta.  I get it most of the time when I go (though, admittedly without the goat cheese) and it has a lot of eggplant, spinach, pine nuts and flavor.  For a while they had some kind of blackened duck special that came with butternut squash ravioli (or something similar), and my brother--who can be picky about food-said that it was great.  

The ambiance is nice--kind of dark and classy.  This would be a good date restaurant.  Occasionally (like most Italian restaurants) they will give into temptation and will hire musicians.  It&#39;s sort of a small space, so that can be loud (and I&#39;m never into cheesy singers...but I think sometimes it might be some sort of respectable jazz).  The food is so good that I&#39;m willing to tolerate even that though!"

I started with a side salad. Then I had:

Caramelized Eggplant &amp; Goat Cheese
with Gemelli Pasta $15.95
Fresh mushrooms, spinach, zucchini,
sun-dried tomatoes, onions and garlic
topped with pine nuts.

For dessert: Cannoli which even my hunnie liked and he usually hates Cannoli.


The boys had:

Italian Sausage and Roasted Peppers
with Penne Pasta $13.95                    
Tossed with whole plum tomatoes,
garlic and Romano cheese

Which they devoured. 

My friend had:

Pasta Marinara $9.95
(with meat sauce add $2.00)
(with vodka sauce add $1.50)

...and a meatball, I believe. She really enjoyed her food as well.


:::::::::BIG NOTE::::::::: They have gluten free pasta upon request!!!! (I should have had that but that&#39;ll be next time) :]


The ONLY reason I didn&#39;t rate this place the full five stars is because when I called for a reservation for four the woman that answered the phone was snotty as all get-out. I was ready to tell her to forget it but I was really in the mood to try a new Italian place out.....I&#39;m glad her nasty demeanor didn&#39;t stop me from coming here because this place is a gem.....I&#39;ll be back soon. :]"

My fiance and I went here couple weeks back prompted by a Restaurant.com gift certificate we had. We came during the week and there was still a decent amount of diners there. I had the lasagna and it was truly out of this world. My fiance had the pasta in vodka sauce and it was also phenomenal. He got a side of meatballs and swore they were the best he&#39;d ever had - that&#39;s saying a lot coming from him.

We arrived at 4:00 on a Saturday (the time it opens), only three tables were occupied, and the service was slow!  My dish was loaded with onions (which I do not like) that was not indicated on the menu.  I told the waiter I could not eat it, and instead of saying, can I get you something else, he said, what do you want me to do with it?  I asked for plain pasta and he had to go ask the manager.  He came back and said that I would be charged for the pasta dish as well as my first order.  I told him to forget it.  I have never had this experience at a restaurant.  Possibly because we had a Groupon?  My husband&#39;s dish was fair.  We will not be going back.  There are so many other good Italian restaurants to go to!"

The losers: Overcooked Pork Chops, the shoe-leather Chicken Parm, pond-scented Sea Bass and the Sausage &amp; Peppers overladen with penne. The experience was bad enough to call attention to the owner, who promptly avoided our table like the plague. Bottom line is we spent over $400 to celebrate a birthday and couldn&#39;t even get a candle for the birthday girl&#39;s dessert.

I purchased a Groupon and discovered that it was going to expire on Wednesday, June 15!  So, I rounded up the family, (I have two twenty somethings living at home) and told my husband I was taking the night off from the kitchen and we were going to use the Groupon.  I made a reservation two days ahead of time for 7 pm.

We arrived at 6:50 p.m. and were told by a very young, quite shaken hostess (she must have been just barked at because customers waiting did not look happy,) that there would be a half hour wait.  WHATTTTT???? Why bother to make a reservation?  I looked around and noticed several tables were leaving.  The bar was full but did not look like &#34;diners&#34;. My husband wanted to leave but I said, &#34;Let&#39;s wait a few minutes.&#34;   Sure enough, within five minutes, the hostess said our table was ready and seated us in a booth in the bar area, which was fine because we were starving.  It was a small booth and my husband is 6&#39;4 and my son is 6&#39;2 and it was a squeeze.

My daughter ordered a chicken pasta dish.  The chicken looked overcooked.  She said is was just &#34;ok&#34; and said that I make better chicken and pasta. My son ordered the chicken parmigiana and experienced a somewhat nice dish.  My husband ordered the shrimp and pasta while I ordered the same dish, without the pasta, since I wanted a carb free dish.  The shrimp and sauce were delicious but I am not sure it was worth the price.  

Service was just OK and then we had problems turning in the Groupon
credit.  The waitress said, &#34;I am not used to people using these so it will take a while.&#34;  My daughter showed her how to use the bar code.

All in all, it was a meh experience.  Our bill for four people, one drink,
one cola, was $60 plus there was the $40 Groupon discount already used!!  Absolutely, not worth the money.  Ambience was awful, too. I would recommend going somewhere else like Amber across the street for the money we spent."

My girlfriend talked up this place for awhile, so naturally I was excited to dine here. The restaurant was ridiculously loud. They had live music that was cranked up to 12. Two gentlemen at the table across from us were literally shouting at one another. We even had a difficult time communicating with our waiter, of whom, only added to the woes of this place. Simply, the guy was rude and impersonal. The food was mediocre. She had the steamed clams and pasta, which, as one yelper stated, were very chewy and overcooked. I had the Vincitori rigatoni and the chef was heavy handed with the Anisette in the sauce, which was overpowering to the rest of the flavors. We finished our meal with a cappuccino and lemon Italian ice, which was the highlight to our dinning experience. Yelpers, take heed to the negative reviews of Vincitori."

I ordered the chicken parmesean and was covered with breading that eventually fell off.  The chicken underneath was gray in color and tough to cut through.  The sauce was very bland.  These chefs need to try something Italian food in downtown Chicago and think about making some changes to their menu.

They also serve gluten free pasta and pizza. Bar is friendly and owner/chef is always around and knows you by name.

When we walked in, it was packed. It was saturday night and for some reason we hadn&#39;t thought to make a reservation. The wait was over an hour. So we put our names on the list and came back, assuming that this would be the best Italian dinner ever... When we came back disappointment started to set in. The hostess tried to seat us at a table where the speakers (they had a live singer that night) would be blaring in our ears, it was very loud in there. Anyway, luckily another couple was leaving and we got their table which was a perfect seat in the corner by a window. When I saw the menu, I was a little surprised at how small it was. I usually try fettucinne alfredo at new Italian places to be on the safe side but to my surprise that wasn&#39;t on their menu. So I decided to go with the Cavatelli in vodka sauce. I got it and it wasn&#39;t good. The sauce was alright, but the noodles were like penne pasta stuffed with more pasta in the middle, it was just too much. I sent it back and asked for Chicken Limone. Which wasn&#39;t much better. My linguine was less than al dente, and the whole meal itself seemed like it had lots of lemon but lacked flavor. No matter how much salt and pepper I put on, the meal just would not taste good! To top it off, the waiter had an attitude after I told him I did not like my food, as if it was coming out of his paycheck. Then we he gave us the bill he said cash only. It&#39;d be nice if they&#39;d tell you that ahead of time when you tell them you&#39;ve got a groupon. Nowadays many people do not carry cash and to walk two blocks in the middle of the night to an ATM is no joy.  To make a long story short, no I would not recommend this place. You may as well go to Maggiano&#39;s, it&#39;s about the same price....and no I will not be back."

I called in a take-out order of Bruschetta, side of meatballs, and the gorgonzola tortellini w/ mushrooms. My server suggested the GIANT mozzarella stuffed meatball instead &amp; I quickly agreed. All items were great. How can you go wrong w/ a meatball the size of your head stuffed w/ cheese? Little skimpy on the goat cheese topping of the bruschetta. The pasta was outstanding!

Food was fair.  Braciola was overdone making the meat somewhat tough.  The risotto special claimed to have roasted tomatoes and did not indicate any onions.  The onions were not finely chopped (course chopped at best) and they overwhelmed what few tomatoes existed in the dish.  When we told the server that we didn&#39;t like onions and that there were too many onions in the dish, and nowhere on the menu did it indicate that many onions, he did not apologize and offer another dish like he stated, &#34;What do you want me to do with the dish?&#34;  And when we asked for a simple pasta with marinara sauce as substitute he said he would have to ask the manager.  So, even though he was performing all of the other duties, he apparently wasn&#39;t empowered to make decisions on making a customer feel respected and looking to come back because of the service.  When he did finally come back to the table he said that no substitute would be provided without charge.  At that point the fate of any future visit to Vincitori was sealed."

Split plates cost $1.99 per the menu = robbery + unintelligent thinking.

There is a problem with the way some restaurants do business in Illinois; no restaurant should charge customers extra than the menu price for the item just because that person shares his/her order with another person. It is strictly dishonest business practice for any restaurant to do this.

Italian Sausage burger-great, juicy, covered with cheese, its definitely made of sausage not burger but i still enjoyed it

Mexicali burger- very solid, good size, moist, and lotsa guac on the burger

Build your own mac and cheese- i got it with ground beef and sausage, came with plenty of meat and a huge serving, might be my favorite thing here

Philly Cheese steak- not what i was expecting, the meat was more thicker than ive seen in philly cheese steaks, but it was still good

Shrimp tacos- good eats for sure, but not a huge plate, dont get if youre really hungry

Wild Boar Sloppy Joe- Tasted like regular sloppy joe, idk what boar tastes like, but it was still really good, the egg and onion rings compliment it perfectly

BBQ Pork- my least favorite, fell apart when i tried to eat and the meat was dry

as for sides, they were all really good and they dont skimp-french fries, tater tots, pub chips and sweet potato fries, idk if i could pick a favorite, maybe the chips

Good beer selection, they even had zombie dust on tap once!

Staff was always very nice, we had Jenna the most.

We didn&#39;t arrive until around 8:30pm and ordered a few drinks before we ordered any food.  The drinks were good and our server started off very nice and helpful, but as the evening got a little later she became harder to track down.  The staff was closing down the bar/restaurant while we were still eating our dinner.  By the time we left at 10:45pm all of the chairs were pulled onto the tables and the staff was waiting for us and one other table to leave.  The food was good, but we definitely were pushed out of the restaurant and made to feel unwelcome and like an inconvenience.  Another random thing we noticed is there was no music playing and they didn&#39;t have the sound from the baseball games, just kinda odd."

I ordered a MiniWich Signature trio consisting of The Fuego , The Luau, and The Brooklyn. All three were fabulous! We also ordered an appetizer of the fried pickles, which were probably the best fried pickles I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s a HUGE order, too. The two of us couldn&#39;t finish them all, and we love our fried foods! The dipping sauce served with them was exceptional.

My beverage of choice for this outing was a Strawberry Harvest lager, by Abita (they make some bomb diggity brews; I also enjoy Purple Haze and Turbo Dog. And yes, yes I did just say &#34;bomb diggity&#34;). After two of those and a full belly, I was a happy girl.

We came on a Thursday at about 3 p.m., so needless to say, it was pretty quiet in there, but I&#39;m not complaining! Our waitress was nice, service was fast, and the food was great. I&#39;d go back again if it wasn&#39;t such a lousy drive out there."

We ended up being there for two hours and a half an hour of that was just waiting for our waitress to clear our plates and see if we wanted the check. My boyfriend had to flag down a different waitress to go get our waitress. So there definitely needs to be some training done here, because most people when they are done eating want to leave shortly after.

We had a bunch of sandwiches including a club, a couple burgers, a flatbread appetizer and the bison sliders. 

The flatbread appetizer was just OK. It had grapes, walnuts, cheese, arugula, onions and a balsamic glaze. It sounded really great on the menu and some of the flavors mixed well, but I felt there was far too much bread, especially on the edges. 

The club looked good, but unfortunately my cousin omitted nearly 1/3 of the toppings, which is a huge pet peeve of mine. Regardless, she said it was good along with the surprising-to-find-on-the-menu tater tots.

My other cousin and his girlfriend ordered burgers. Being the unique foodie (and used-to-be chef) he likes to add and change things when he orders. He had one of the burgers, but ordered it cooked black and blue with an added (upcharge) sunny-side-up egg on top (I know, what a freak, right?). This was a huge mess, but it came out just the way he likes it, so hey, why not?

I had the bison sliders and to be very honest I did not think they were that good at all. The bison tasted pretty bland, and although I am not an expert on bison, I felt that it was lacking something, and was kind of regretting not ordering a burger like the rest of my family. They were also pretty pricey, and for nearly the same money, I was reminded of Labriola Cafe&#39;s (Oak Brook) steak sliders which were far superior. 

I really think I just got unlucky at 3 Corners. Everyone at our table enjoyed their food except me, and I feel bad leaving only 3 stars. I really like the menu, location and atmosphere of the place and am a believer in second chances. I will have to come back for a burger and beer sometime and hopefully change my review to make it more consistent with the experiences my parents have had there; I want to like this place!

3 Stars for location, atmosphere, menu, and unfortunately everyone&#39;s food but mine."

I really enjoyed my &#39;Bison&#39; burger with some great Parm and truffle fries. My girlfriend enjoyed her chicken sandwich. And the beer selection was above average.

However, the service was just ridiculously sub-par. It took 15 minutes to get our drink order in. I think our server only came by since we were about to leave. Then it took another 10 minutes to get our drinks. At some point we reminded her that we ordered food, and miraculously it was &#39;just &#39; ready. Although the food was already a bit cool. We didn&#39;t complain since we were already very hungry. Then we sat waiting for about a half hour for her to return with the check. Which consequently gave me time to write this Yelp review. So as I write, I wait for the check, credit card ready to swipe."

Oh &amp; you have got to order the TOTS! Crunchy perfection with some ketchup!

I went on a Saturday night, and it was pretty busy, there was a short wait for a table inside, or they offered to seat us immediately outside on the patio.  You can see the patio on your way in, and its very nice and large, but it was raining, dreary, and insanely humid that day so we opted to wait a few minutes for a table.  The food selection is what you&#39;d expect for a classic American/Pub type place.  I had the &#34;Crunch Burger&#34; a half lb burger, pepperjack cheese, fried pickles, ranch aioli, on top of pub potato ships inside of a pretzel bun! (angioplasty not included).

We were seated right away due to the number of peeps in our party, but smaller groups and couples that didn&#39;t want to sit at the bar had a 45 minute wait...and there were plenty of people waiting in line.  The hostess was a sweetie.  Waitress came and gave us an outstanding selection of beers and cocktails to choose from along with our food menus; She was all smiles. Not that phony, crappy smile either. She was energetic and funny.

We started out with some bacon-wrapped jalapeno poppers on a skewer.  I had a bleu cheeseburger cooked to perfection on a pretzel roll with sweet potato fries Thick, juicy burger with fresh toppings....cold beer and chilled cocktails; It was just what I needed to pull me out of my funk.  Everyone stole my fries!  Before dinner, sipped a lemondrop martini, garnished with a fresh lemon and generous on the vodka. With my burger, I chose Goose Island&#39;s Matilda. Smooth and refreshing...perfect in every way. One of my best friends drank a Coors light...which I believe is punishable by execution. 

Service is good, but you have to speak up. Even when I stood up and leaned over the bar to wave our server down, she was upbeat and acted quickly with whatever it was the table needed.

It&#39;s loud in here with the excitement of sports buzzing in the air, music playing and lots of  conversation.  Because I was with a familiar and incredibly-obnoxious crowd, this wasn&#39;t an issue , but if you go here on a first date or in an effort to converse, I&#39;d suggest moving out to the patio, which is only open in the warmer months.  Additionally, with all the televisions, good luck keeping your date&#39;s attention...or hell, just embrace it and watch a game together. 

I&#39;ll definitely be back to check out the patio this summer.

My husband loves their food. My husband gets their sweet and spicy burger and I get a cheeseburger. Love that they are on a pretzel bun. Pub chips are delicious! I don&#39;t like seasoning on mine but he does. They make them just as requested.

By now between my wife and I, we&#39;ve eaten several different items on the menu. They have a good burger selection and the crunch burger is definitely my favorite burger of the bunch. Oh, they have tater tots! By far my favorite item to get is the Mac n cheese. The cheeses they use have great flavor and it is a large portion that I can never finish. My only complaint is that I love their chili but it always seems like it takes way too long for them to roll it out once it starts getting cold outside. Several times we&#39;ve been there in October and even into November and they still don&#39;t have it. October would be the perfect time to roll it out. Of all the times we&#39;ve been to 3 corners, I can&#39;t remember a time we were ever disappointed."

After our less than ideal carry-out experience about a month ago, I was contacted by Kevin, the owner, who listened to my feedback and assured me adjustments would be made.  He apologized for our experience and invited us to return to 3 Corners and we did last night.  First of all, I had never experienced that kind of quick response to feedback and want to commend Kevin providing the kind of customer service that should be an example for other business owners.  

This time we ordered seafood bisque, a southwest steak salad and mini-wiches and the Allagash White Ale.  Our server was top notch - she was also knowledgeable about the large selection of beer choices.  She recommended a beer that was just to my liking.  They happened to have a $3 draft special that night so we indulged.  

The beer and the food were all very good.  I&#39;d say the seafood soup was the best of the three, light but full of flavor.  3 Corners soups are usually the reason we go there to eat - they are house-made and one of their best menu items, in my opinion. 

The steak salad was also good - I would recommend ordering the steak medium-rare as it was pretty well done (but tasty).  The mini-wiches are always a good choice and a great value - three good size portions (fish, pulled pork, burger, etc.) of your choice on fluffy buns for $6.95...you can&#39;t go wrong. 

All in all our return visit was a great one and we&#39;ll probably give carry-out a try again soon."

I actually hate football, but it brings people to bars to get fecked and shout things at multiple televisions.  I can blend in and pretend I needed an excuse to day drink on a Sunday when I have work in the morning.

So I guess this place is good for that- watching the game...  I wouldn&#39;t know because when football is on, it only looks like I&#39;m watching.   It wasn&#39;t too crowded and we got a seat right at the bar.  The friends I was with seemed to think it was optimal for watching sweaty dudes knock into each other and pause every 5 seconds.  

What it wasn&#39;t optimal for, was my game strategy- try tons of tasty pumpkin beers.  They were out of everything I wanted to order.  I felt bad for our bartender, as it was obviously not her fault,  but I would suggest them adopting a beer list small enough for them to handle keeping up to date, or a chalkboard that out of stock beers can be easily erased.  

The food was slightly above average for bar food.  Interesting menu items and decent prices.  The day we went there were TONS of fruit flies everywhere.  Made it hard to enjoy the food or  my 6th choice default beer."

I&#39;ve been there about 3 times and every time there it has potential but it continues to constantly disappoint me.  They appear to have a great beer selection however, my most recent time my waitress did not know anything about the beer on tap and couldn&#39;t answer any of my questions about they beer they offer.

My most recent time around I had some kind of spicy burger with the fried jalapenos on it.  I thought this was going to be awesome because they serve their burgers on pretzel buns.  You can never go wrong with a pretzel bun.  Unfortunately they managed to go wrong with everything else except the bun.  My burger was over cooked and it was swimming in this spicy sauce.  It was an ingredient in my burger but lord have mercy a small child could have drowned in that sauce.  The waitress came by once with a drink refill after we waved her down like we were in a sinking ship.  

Someday I may venture there again when our friends that are local to Lemont decide they want to go there again.  Hopefully I&#39;ll sing a different tune."

3 Corners has such an amazing beer selection that I only thought it appropriate that I write this review under the influence.  I will try and use spell chack, no promises though.
I am very excited that I finally came here.  This place is awesome.  The beer selection is dizzying.  They have so much good beer that I didn&#39;t want to leave.  They had a section on the menu for the &#34;yard sale&#34; which is the beer they had limited quantities of that they are almost out of and as result may be discounted.  I binged a bit on this portion of the menu.   Soooooooooooo good.  OMG, I got to try some great new, to me atleast, beers.

Try the ruben eggrolls.  Holy balls they are worth overeating for.  And did I mention that the beer selection is awesome?  They had Killians Stout on special, $2.50,   It was amazeballs.  And I didn&#39;t even know Killians made a stout.

I also ate half a hamburger, !!The Crunch!!  I wanted to surround the name with lightning, but I could not find the lightning key on my laptop.  If you happen to find it let me know.  It was a damn good burger, not my favorite, but damn good and one I will get again.  The meat was nothing special but it was so well put together and the pretzel bun was so perfect the burger part didn&#39;t even matter.  If you get it ask for fried jalapenos on it too.  
 
I don&#39;t know if I mentioned it yet, but they have a beer selection that would make you salavate like one of Pavlov&#39;s dogs.

The burgers are so tasty.  I recommend the mini burgers.  You get your choice of 3, all served on a pretzel bun.  Yum!!  Today I got the caprese, luau, and the Tuscan.  All amazing.  You can get pulled pork or fish if you wanted to mix it up.  
I&#39;ve been here a number of times, and the best item on their menu is the Rueben sandwich.  I don&#39;t know what makes it so damn good, but it&#39;s awesome.  Try it!!  Besides Crispin, they have a lot of good craft beers on the menu.  Yea, sometimes they run out of the most popular ones, but that&#39;s to be expected I suppose.  If something is so good, it&#39;s gonna go quick.  
The one thing I do wish for, is that the bar had more natural light.  It has stores on both sides, so there is no way to have windows.  Maybe if the windows behind the bar weren&#39;t a brushed glass it would be better.  But not a big deal at all.  Good place to watch a game, drink good beer, and eat great food.

I don&#39;t think they know what they want to be, Sports Bar, or hangout for young Hipsters, as they blare music while Bar patrons are trying to watch Local Sports Events on  TV, with the TV volume off..   It&#39;s a generic suburban place, not too friendly at all, [the Ditz-Girls at the podium at the front entrance just want to know if you&#39;re coming in to eat, so they can steer you to a table of their choice, not yours.]  Other than that, they can&#39;t even utter a simple goodnight, after you&#39;ve been there spending money for an hour or 2, or so.   They just stand there, talking and giggling at each other. Too much , effort to exhibit some hospitality, I guess.  Same goes for the Wet-Blanket Bartenders, who, after dealing with them 3 or 4 times now,  have about as much personality as a wet sponge, and aren&#39;t really on the ball doing what they&#39;re supposed to be doing.  [probably family members of the owners, thats probably why they&#39;re employed there].
  
The food is decent, but typically overpriced, [$10 for a grilled cheese sandwich], every appetizer is $9.00.  Regular entrees are higher of course.
  
It is a nice clean place, but really lacks character, as it is pretty white bread suburbanite boring.   Good place for the Young and Dumb.  If you like paying  $8.00 for pretzels, another $4 for a beer, and If you are easily satisfied with Mediocrity, this is the place for you.  And wait till you get a look at employee Cartoon-Kid.

How about a place that has a large outdoor patio, good service, and down right tasty bar food? Then 3 Corners Grill and Tap is just the place for you. 

Located at the intersection of 3 roads (thus the name, clever eh?) this bar located in a strip mall was a pleasant surprise. And while the patio overlooks the parking lot- they have landscaped it enough that if you squint, you just might think you are somewhere other than a strip mall. 

We were seated promptly and given menus. The service was almost a little over bearing to start as the server was obviously oblivious to our signals that said we hadn&#39;t even looked at the menus yet as we were busy catching up. Finally- I told her I would flag her down when I needed her and that system seemed to work better for the rest of the night. 

The menu has plenty of variety with soups, salads, starters, sandwiches and entrees to choose from. I had the grilled cheese with bacon and tomato and my friend had one of their signature burgers. Both were quite tasty and mine came with tater tots so you know I was a happy camper! 

If beer is your thing- they have 15 kinds on tap, another 50 in bottles and probably 10 or so in cans- so you&#39;d be hard pressed not to find one that you like. 

Throughout the bar and patio- there are many large screen TV&#39;s where you can watch sports to your heart&#39;s content. And if corn hole is your game- they have it available to set up on the outdoor patio to play the night away. And of course- it&#39;s the burbs so there is plenty of free parking in the lot out front. 

While Lemont is not on my beaten path every day- I know now if I&#39;m heading in that direction- I&#39;m heading for 3 Corners. Maybe you should too!"

I will certainly give it another shot but I won&#39;t go out of my way to get there either. And that&#39;s really too bad because I really liked their menu.

It was a nice variety and there was so much food that we took a doggie bag.  We each had a beer with our lunch, too.

Over the course of the night, we were brought the wrong beer (which we didn&#39;t complain about because it was still beer), food took a long time to come (didn&#39;t care, had beer) our waitress was like a ghost that kept disappearing, there were out of beers that were on the menu, and drinks came very slowly.

Top notch food, some of the best burgers I&#39;ve ever had.  The appetizer platter we got was scrumptious.  Bavarian Pretzels?  Awesome.  Fried Pickles?  Awesome.  Mini burgers?  Awesome.  Sweet and Spicy burger?  To die for.  The Fuego?  Well, the Fuego gets it&#39;s own paragraph.

Now normally when a restaurant says their food is spicy I laugh in their face, eat it and leave.  Some places this is safer than others.  Italian, safe, sushi, safe, Indian, not safe.  Come on, it&#39;s a burger bar, how spicy can it possibly be?  So when the Fuego hit the table I was not expecting it to have any fire in it at all.  But it does.  It&#39;s not overwhelmingly spicy, but if you enjoy spicy food, this is not a burger you can just power though.  But it wasn&#39;t too spicy /spiceflex

Our server was very attentative and the burger selection was very good.  The 4C burger was fantastic!!  Four different Cheeses and the beer selection is out of this world.  I have been here multiple times and ordered three different items with all being outstanding.

Kids, this rivals Tribes for the Southland&#39;s best beer selection.

Continuing my comparison to Tribes, 3 Corners definitely has a leg up on the food.  My stomach is growling now recalling my the 4C burger - 4C standing for four cheeses.  What more could a girl ask for?  That might be the amazing apple bread pudding I had for dessert.  Essentially, 3 Corners offers the kind of quality food that sticks to your ribs without being pretentious.

I&#39;ll echo others in noting that the service wasn&#39;t stellar, which is the only reason my review awards 4 stars here instead of 5.  Bottom line, I couldn&#39;t be more jazzed that Lemont has this gem."

Been here maybe 5 times now....food is always amazing. Today was slightly disappointing. My omelet was great, but my husband got the Mexican omelet that was supposed to have Chorizo. He said it was horrible. The Chorizo was just gross. It didn&#39;t even look like it should. He tried picking all the slices out but the bad flavor was still there. He ate about half and had them toss the rest. Very upsetting. Overall though the rest of there food is great! I always get the Californian omelet with bacon added. Delicious.

TIP: Come hungry and expect to wait for a table!

Environment - Looks can be very deceiving! Normally I would drive past a restaurant that wasn&#39;t so easy on the eyes..but I am so so so glad that I made my way our here! Both times I went to this location was on a Sunday. The crowd you can expect it families (parents PLEASE DON&#39;T KEEP YOUR CHILDREN IN PJS IN PUBLIC..SO GROSS), people coming after the church, high school students, and other locals from the area. Upon arriving you will be giving a number, I was number 14..and the person who walked in 15 mins later was number 59..THIS PLACE AIN&#39;T PLAYIN AROUND! You are pretty much guaranteed a table within 15-20 mins. The staff is real nice..but the bus boys are even nicer..just over all very kind and they are always chatty with the customers! (A huge sign that they might be happy at their job!)

Food- OMG! Holy grail of breakfast food! As I mentioned, you must come hungry. From the coffee to  the omelets everything is wonderful! The portions are huge! I had the Californian oven-baked omelette (I am always thinking about Cali!) this omelette was packed with huge pieces of avocados, mushroom, green onion, sour cream, jack and cheddar cheese...a side of wheat toast..delish hash browns and overload of coffee. For the price, it&#39;s a steal! 

If you are in the area..make time to check out this gem of a spot! Good service, delicious food, and fun environment!"

Time of my visit: Lunch

I have been to this place before on several occasions and finally got around reviewing it.  It is conveniently located to my place of employment and I figured I&#39;d go, since I could not figure out what to have for lunch.

The selection in this joint was not too bad and had breakfast, if I wanted it.  As usual, I asked my waitress for a recommendation and oped out to offer me breakfast, which I turned down.  I ended up ordering roasted beef panini, which came with a selection of a soup and another side order, I picked waffle fires (which I still don&#39;t get why more place don&#39;t offer).  For a dollar more, I got a salad.

The soup, I chose, was tomato basel.  Anyone who is reading this and remembers Dominick&#39;s tomato basel, this one was not it.  It was alright, just missing a bit of a kick I personally prefer.

The salad was your typical greens, tomato and some cucumbers, nothing out of an ordinary, but not too bad, I would say about average side salad and good value for that extra dollar.

The panini with waffle fries came out next.  I must say, both looked freshly cooked and had no visible or tastewise waiting period.  I thought my panini on sourdough bread was good, it did not fall apart on a touch, the roasted beef tasted fresh, tender to the bite and was nicely combined with cheese.  The waffle fires were above average, perfectly (not over not under) cooked.

The service was phenomenal.  The waitress was awesome!  Overall a solid B!  Would recommend this place and I&#39;ll back for sure."

While in town for the holidays, I made plans with a friend to meet here for brunch because it was about halfway between where she lived and where I was staying. I&#39;ve been to another Red Apple Pancake House in the Chicago &#39;burbs and had a horrible experience, so I was just a bit wary of this place. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a chain or they just happen to have the same name, but yeah.

FORTUNATELY, we had a really nice brunch here.... the day after Christmas.

The day after Christmas is apparently the day everyone goes out to eat. 

This place was PACKED. However, we were quoted a fifteen-minute wait, so we stayed. And it really was just only fifteen minutes or so. Whew! We were then seated quickly and promptly brought our menus and water. We all ordered (I ordered a vegetarian skillet), chatted, and had our steaming hot plates of food within twenty minutes or so. Considering the crowd, I thought that was pretty good. My omelette was good -- standard breakfast, but nothing to complain about it. It was pretty big, so I had leftovers to bring back with me.

I actualy excited to bring home leftovers to eat for breakfast the next morning... and here I am, a week later, JUST NOW remembering that I had leftovers in the fridge at my in-law&#39;s house. And I didn&#39;t eat them. DANG! OOPS.

Roughly $20 for two people to eat there. Seems pretty normal to me. In fact, as I already mentioned, it&#39;s a standard breakfast place. Nothing extraordinary. Normally I&#39;d give a place like this three stars..... but it gets four stars because our server/the staff/everyone handled the large brunch crowd well, serving up great food and a pleasant atmosphere. Highly doubt I&#39;ll be back again because I don&#39;t live in the area, and there other places to brunch, but still a good spot."

This was a very good experience. 

SERVICE: 5 stars. Let me start by saying our server was Jacquie (it had a &#34;q&#34; somewhere) and she was excellent. She didn&#39;t write ANYTHING down and she always got what we needed and our orders were 100% correct. Even when I mistakenly thought she had missed something, I realized I didn&#39;t even see it on the table. She was excellent. 

FOOD: Delicious food and huge portions. My skillet had four eggs and my husbands &#34;crows nest&#34; had four eggs as well. (See pictures). $8.99 for my huge skillet. The huge Apple pancake has two options: junior and the huge one we got. The huge one is $13.99 ( if I remember correctly). My skillet was great. Just enough mozzarella with plenty of hashbrowns and veggies. I usually like to add jalapeños but they had hot sauce so I was good. My sister liked her burger. It didn&#39;t have much look appeal but no biggie. The Apple pancake takes 30 minutes so put the order in right away. 

We were seated very quickly and we came in at 2:06pm with less than hour till closing. I didn&#39;t use  the bathrooms so I can&#39;t comment. The restaurant was clean. The staff were friendly. It seems very popular. Plenty of parking. Brunch hours are fine. Large portions at great prices. We enjoy coming here and next time we are in town, we will definitely be back. 

Oh and I saw the owner (I think) and his son or other male relative sitting. He took our plates at one point but he was definitely somewhere higher up on the hierarchy in that restaurant based on the interactions. He put lemon on his skillet and I plan to try that next time!!"

The service was exceptionally efficient and friendly; quite possibly the best I&#39;ve had anywhere. My entire party loved their meals. I got the Jimmy&#39;s waffle, which was topped with nutella, custard, and an assortment of berries. My fiancée got the bacon waffle. Both were excellent, but only a single waffle.

My only gripe is that it is a little expensive for what it is; $25 before tip for the 2 premium waffles and a coffee. Otherwise, an excellent experience."

We ordered an apple pancake and told them when we would arrive at the restaurant.  We arrived earlier than we thought. So there should not have been any time issue. The pancake was awful.  Over cooked and very little apple in parts of it.  Another person at our table ordered sausage.  It was over cooked.  Our meals looked like they were under a heatlamp for way too long.  Also, the restaurant was not busy so there is no excuse for such bad food.  The manager kept making excuses but in no way reimbursed us.  Our bill was around 40.00 Horrible customer service.

Be sure to get here early because this place is ALWAYS packed. Right around 9am is when things start to pick up and you could be waiting in line for a solid hour. But their food is definitely worth it. 

I was always a huge fan of their Popeye skillet (it had bacon, spinach, and general cheesy goodness throughout) and opted for the pumpkin pancakes when they were in season. Really, nothing on the menu here is a dud.

Pro-tip: I advise you to either tough out the wait or just go to McDonald&#39;s for breakfast and NOT go to Carol&#39;s Garden down the way and across the street. You might as well be eating out of the trash."

the best thing about this place is they excel and getting stacks of people in an out. you are never rushed. stay there as long as you like but they clean the tables and set up quickly so the worst of log jams gets cleared up quickly and you get seated without much wait.

There&#39;s just something about it, this place is so homey. You walk in, there are apples everywhere! Pleasant employees that you will see basically every time you come in, and the food is just out of this world. Nonetheless, its really decently priced. 

If you&#39;re a plain Jane, their &#34;From The Chicken Coop&#34; deals are the best. My mom and I can get 2 eggs, a load of hash browns, and an English muffin or pancakes for 3.99. That&#39;s hard to beat. Keep in mind, their eggs are old country style, so you get double the eggs. :)

Just saying, this place should be named The Golden Apple. Love it. Love everything about this place. It&#39;s fabulous. I can almost guarantee you won&#39;t be disappointed... Unless of course you own a farm and are a professional cook. I am neither, so bravo apples!"

I couldn&#39;t finish my food...

Our first time there.. been driving by for years and never really thought much about the place. The Yelp reviews drew me in, particularly Joe E who&#39;s been there like a billion and one times. We went just after lunch time, so it wasn&#39;t crowded at all... Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have snacked on toast that morning...

I asked Lisa.. &#34;What do you think I&#39;m going to get?&#34;.. she mumbled..&#34;something with a lot of meat&#34;... the &#34;The Butcher Block Omelette&#34;  *sigh*... sometimes I am a little predictable. That&#39;s what I ordered.. 

Lisa pulled the same stunt on me.. I smugly said &#34;The California Omelette&#34;... NOPE!  She wanted the Portobello Mushroom Omelette.

I&#39;ll bet she would have gotten the California if I hadn&#39;t said anything.

These are oven baked, four egg omelettes, they are loaded with fillings.. light, fluffy and delicious. Mine was really, really great. Hers was good, perfectly cooked, huge and fluffy... just like mine... but it was too mushroomy for her (I&#39;ve never heard her say THAT before, I hate mushrooms so I would notice something like that) The Portobello&#39;s were just too much.. she should have gotten the California. (hmmmm...)

The potatoes are my favorite type of home fries, they get them good and crispy on the outside... fortunately for me.. Lisa gave me half of hers.. and I had some leftovers for later... delicious!

We chose pancakes instead of toast, I had the regular ones and they were great... Lisa upgraded to Pumpkin pancakes for an extra $1.. soooo worth it.. she said they were the best she&#39;s ever had.. I tasted them too and thought they were a real stand out.

So, I had leftovers, the bill was inexpensive and the quality of the food outstanding..

Atmosphere is typical suburban breakfast place.. spacious booths. Great food and value.. this place is the real deal and my new favorite breakfast place in the area!"

I ordered the Hawaiian omelette and i was not expecting fantastic it was. If you like Hawaiian pizza, imagine all the toppings in an omelette and it was something that I would&#39;ve ever thought of in an omelette and the potatoes that came with it is also so yummy! I also ordered the Nutella crepe and it is to die for. Crepes crispy on the edges and nice and fluffy in the middle. Nutella galore topped with fresh strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. Coffee is far better than the other breakfast places as well. This is my favorite breakfast spot now and will be taking the whole family next!"

I ordered the Red Apple Skillet.  I thought the food tasted very good.  The coffee was disgusting, however.  It tasted like cheap Hill Brothers coffee.

Here&#39;s why it gets 1 star:  the interior is dark and depressing with ancient décor.  I wouldn&#39;t normally care if it was squeaky clean, but it was not.  Being that it was a Tuesday, and not very busy, I expect the place to look cleaner on the inside.  The biggest reason for the 1 star, I got horrible diarrhea about 2 hours after I ate, so I concluded that the kitchen and/or cooks are dirty, or the food is not fresh.   

This place is not for me.  Will not be back."

I got a Californian omelet with pancakes. My wife got a ham and pineapple omelet.

For starters, it turns out they double the number of eggs on the menu. So an item with 2 eggs actually has 4... and I guess that means the omelets have 8? That seems right, surprisingly, because I&#39;m pretty sure the omelet alone weighed a pound.

They also seem to have doubled the amount of fillings too. My omelet wasn&#39;t particularly fluffy, but it definitely had a lot of vegetables, well cooked. They throw it in the oven at the end for a few minutes, so a light brown &#34;crust&#34; forms on the outside of the omelet. I like it.

The pancakes are light, as are the potatoes, which resemble scalloped potatoes without any sauce. The coffee is good and so is the syrup.

Red Apple is close enough to home to be our regular breakfast place from now on. It also helps that we get three meals for the price of one."

Anyone who doesn&#39;t love this place is a miserable, snobby, picky, looking to complain about something kind of person! Sure I&#39;ve always had a long wait to be seated , but so what! The food is so good, the bacon ( mmmmmmm bacon) is perfect, the coffee is served in a big mug. The wait staff is great, even the guys who clean off the table are super nice and funny guys!  

I used to go their all the time because I dated someone close by, now I travel like 35 mins to get there less often but I think about it every time I go out for breakfast! 

I wish I could head out there more often. 5 stars every time! 

*on a side note; I hate hate hate hate hate pancakes HOWEVER- I don&#39;t know what magic ingredients you guys use in your batter but in over 25+ years I have never enjoyed a pancake.

The food is just OK...typical greasy-spoon fare.  My husband has ordered from here twice and the food arrived cold - not sure how that&#39;s even possible in a busy high-turnover restaurant.  It is a very cluttered environment with tables smashed in very close to one another, so I do not prefer the crush-of-humanity atmosphere.  Curiously, for some reason they find it necessary to dress the waitresses in bar wench-type costumes, not unlike the St. Pauli girl beer bottle stickers.  So along with your cold greasy plate of cholesterol, with so much skin being bared, you will also likely be treated to an assortment of hickies and cleavage as we were.  If you are up for the 3am low brow bar crowd serving you sub-mediocre breakfast, then this place is for you.  If you are up for some hot and tasty breakfast food one level above Red Apple, you&#39;d be better off going to McDonald&#39;s."

As my fellow Elite Yelp members have stated myriad times; there is no restaurant with the word &#34;apple&#34; in their name that is bad. Red Apple Pancake House is by far my favorite restaurant (can&#39;t you tell with all my check ins and photos?)

My noble profession of molding the minds of future America through fitness, nutrition, and physical education has taken me multiple counties South of DuPage. I&#39;ve been back in the area a lot lately and with every visit I always make sure to stop by for coffee, a gigantic omelet filled with love, and amazing buckwheat and/or pumpkin pancakes. Let me explain!

It starts out crowded. You&#39;re worried about the overflowing crowd coming out of the door during the middle of winter. It&#39;s a brisk eight degrees outside but you couldn&#39;t care less; breakfast in heaven awaits. You know what you&#39;re getting...you&#39;ve looked through the menu. Sure, it&#39;s 11:00 AM. and you could could the famous cream of chicken with rice soup, a Red Apple Cheeseburger cooked to order, or even their famous waffle fries. Don&#39;t fret young man/lady...you know breakfast fare is where your heart, brain, and stomach want to go on this culinary adventure.

You see the options: samplers (think eggs and sausage), waffles, the &#34;Dutch Baby&#34;, and even some cereals. Eggs equals breakfast. Here at Red Apple the math is simple! 

Two eggs turns into four. I&#39;ve ALWAYS ordered an omelet with multiple vegetables. I love getting it with avocado. It&#39;s sweet creamy goodness at its finest. Sure, you could go with one of the omelets on the menu...but why not get out of the palette comfort zone? Load it up with broccoli, mushroom, and avocado! You want a kick in the ass, tough guy? How about a jalapeno, onion, tomato, and black olive party in your mouth? I am drooling as I type...wait...I am not...because my coffee cup was just re-filled without even taking two gigantic gulps.Maybe change it up get a little avocado in that omelet as I mentioned before? Dare to be different!

Listen, I used this restaurant going from 225 lbs. to 175 lbs. No excuses. Yes, of course, you can&#39;t get the Mickey Mouse Pancakes every day (sugar overload). You also can&#39;t drink a Coca Cola and expect to add muscle and lose fat. Red Apple can and is a nutritious option. More so than other breakfast establishment in the area. 

You&#39;re telling me I can get fruit instead of hash browns? Count me in! Strawberries AND blueberries in the aforementioned fruit cup...in the middle of winter? You&#39;ve got to be kidding me? I thought this place was just a diner in disguise...YOU WERE WRONG! I&#39;ve built my own omelet, got my coffee and fruit cup...good, right? WRONG AGAIN!

You get pancakes or toast? Sure...go with toast...you milquetoast! I will take fluffy buttermilk...NO WAIT! How about buckwheat? It&#39;s not on the menu...just ASK! Sweet and silky goodness! Fall means pumpkin pancakes! Some places only have them during fall...NOT THIS PLACE! Oh, it is April...yes, I will take some pumpkin pancakes, RED APPLE!

Honestly, the servers and hosts don&#39;t BS with anything. They turn tables like Jesus Christ turned water into wine (or was it wine into water...I should go to church and find the answer). Sorry Jesus...I am going to Red Apple on the Sabbath! I pray that you forgive me...but this place is that good! I would recommend Dar or Andi. Both are great to talk to and always make me laugh. Not saying that if you have anyone else the service will suffer, but with them you will get a fluffy omelet, some laughs, and a steaming cup of coffee!!!

If you&#39;re looking for a cheap, quick, and delicious meal at an unreal price...Red Apple is the way to go. Don&#39;t mess around and go to Carol&#39;s Garden (although delicious), Egglectic, or Egg Harbor. Why have butt steak when the filet mignon is there or the taking?

Paraphrasing the great Ricky Bobby, if you don&#39;t eat at Red Apple, than F(&amp;* you!"

Host called out the number in about 5 minutes and we were seated at a clean table. The upside down coffee cups were NOT sitting directly on the table, but on nice little napkins. Nice touch!

Coffee was good, staff was efficient. Ordered a sampler that had everything I wanted, a couple slices of French Toast, bacon, sausage, and scrambled eggs. Simple.

Syrup was real maple syrup. Jelly basket had Smucker&#39;s jelly in it and lots of options, including apple cinnamon jelly... Nice big portions of everything. Food arrived quickly.

All in all, everything was spot on.

In fact, I forgot to bring my bill with me when I went to the register to check out and they brought it up instantly and I paid without running back to the table.

They even know how to use the TECHNOLOGY! Cool!

TIP: Check out the SAMPLERs for 3 quick options..."

Food:  Must have the back, the French toast is always good, however I am not a big fan of their stuffed french toast, and I cannot pin point why.  Skillets are yummy, all of the food is enjoyable.

My main complaint is that I wish they used more fresh fruits and veggies rather than having such a big menu. I noticed that a lot of their fruits and veggies were either from frozen or from cans.

I ordered the Sonoma Country skillet that had potatoes, eggs, monterey jack cheese, broccoli, mushrooms and chicken pieces. I think the only fresh items in that skillet were the eggs, cheese and potatoes. Maybe the mushrooms...  

The broccoli seemed to be thawed from frozen and was mostly stalks. The chicken seemed really dry. 

My significant other ordered the peach crepes and the server kindly informed him that it would come in &#34;a sauce&#34;. Well, the peaches were from canned and the sauce was the juice from the can. 

For a place that seems to be bustling on weekday mornings, you&#39;d think fresh produce would be a no-brainer. After this most recent visit, I&#39;ll probably go somewhere that uses fresh produce next time. Sorry, Red Apple!"

We&#39;d always go the day before school started (for an end-of-summer breakfast) and the last day of school -- you know, they make the kids go for 30 minutes to pick up report cards so they&#39;re free for the day around 9 am.  Let&#39;s go out to breakfast!  We&#39;d usually see tons of other families and teachers there as well.

Then we had an incident that turned us off so badly that we&#39;ve never returned.

We sat down, and a bus boy came by with water.  He managed to knock an entire glass of ice-cold water into my husband&#39;s lap.  He didn&#39;t apologize or even acknowledge it.  We waited to see if anyone else would comment; nothing.  My husband, who used to manage restaurants and knows how customers should be treated, went to talk to the manager.  The guy just basically said, &#34;Oh well, stuff happens.&#34;  No apology, no nuthin&#39;.

We can get better food and much, MUCH better service at our new favorite brunch cafe, so I guess this place did us a favor in the end."

- The owners take pride in their restaurant and are always there.

In all my years on this planet I had never had Eggs Benedict before, so I&#39;m glad they were so good. I will definitely be ordering them again next time we eat here, which, despite how good the food is, will be a long while simply because I&#39;m not big on eating out for breakfast.

The prices are low, and the portions are huge. It&#39;s the kind of place where you need to come hungry, and you probably won&#39;t need to eat the rest of the day after you leave. This is one of the few places where I take leftovers home.

I know the decor isn&#39;t going to blow anyone away, but with the food that they have, I usually look at nothing by my plate anyway.

Just be careful if you go there mid to late morning on a Sunday. The place will be packed, but they do a good job of getting people seated pretty quickly."
red-apple-pancake-house-carol-stream,Aimee M.,RO3vznPVVw5NWcgfP3k17A,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,365,3,fxUSsSdauAEexj5JSv1tSA,2.0,2011-02-28,"Red Apple certainly lives up to the hype regarding big breakfasts. I love going out for Breakfast/Brunch and it&#39;s pretty hard to mess it up. Some of my friends will question this as quite a few of them sing Red Apple&#39;s praises, but I can&#39;t rate it any higher. 

The food is good. No question there. Huge portions and made to order. The menu lists all the breakfast staples--baked omelets, skillets, pancakes, waffles, crepes, build-your-own meals. I opted for the California Egg White Omelet--mushrooms, green onions, avocado, jack cheese. Very well made and very fresh ingredients. It comes with a side of breakfast potatoes which were OK, a little on the bland side which was easily fixed with dashes of pepper. You get a choice of toast or pancakes, and since &#34;pancake&#34; is in their name, figured I should try it. Very good, fluffy pancake, nice mild sweet flavor. This was a huge portion and at least half was taken home in a to-go container. 

The thing I can&#39;t get out of my head and why I can&#39;t rate any higher was that the restaurant seemed so dingy. Dingy-hole-in-the-wall I can handle, but dingy-dirty is not very appealing. The busboys, although clearing tables quickly, were not very careful. Throwing plates/silverware into their busing bins, caused all this food to fly out and onto the floor. The last thing I wanted was a piece of someone else&#39;s scrambled egg hitting me or landing on my table. And the floors were cruddy with old food/used napkins. The restaurant was very busy this Sunday morning, but there were lulls where I saw everyone standing around--so no one else sees the old food under those tables or in the aisle, eh? And the hallway floor to the bathroom? I&#39;m not even going to mention it. Such a shame, All it made me think of was whether or not the kitchen was in the same shape. 

Maybe the place is a bit more appealing on less-busy days, but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m ready to check it out again."

My husband and I went here a few months back and now go at least once a week and usually it is on a Sunday after church.  This place is always busy and always packed but the wait is not even long and it is worth it since the food is that great.  Prices are reasonable too and nice family environment to be in.

The wait time was long, almost thirty minutes. We saw a family who seemed to know the manager sneak through and get seated ahead of many long waiting customers. The parking lot was full and many patrons seemed to not mind the wait, so we figured the food must be pretty good. What a disappointment. It was not horrible, but it was very bland to say the least. We had a order of house pancakes and the French orchard. The French Orchard had no taste, you could not even detect any cinnamon in the cinnamon bread. The sauce had an odd flavor. The pancakes were just bland, Bisquick has more flavor. Was not worth the wait. This place is off our list for future breakfasts."

1) I can order take-away. It&#39;s always ready within 10 minutes.
2) It&#39;s cheap with big portions. I always have leftovers for another meal later.
3) It&#39;s super-close to my job. Breakfast food for lunch!
4) Fluffy pancakes.
5) Friendly staff at the counter.

Reasons I don&#39;t like Red Apple:
Out of the 5 times I&#39;ve ordered, only once did the eggs come the way I asked. Make sure to clearly specify &#34;very runny&#34; if you want it that way. Otherwise, they&#39;re chalky and over-cooked.

Generic corn syrup, the flimsiest plasticware I&#39;ve ever used, and the times I&#39;ve gotten fruit, it&#39;s been tasteless and not too ripe.

TIPS: You can order takeaway by viewing their online menu on their website, but the website doesn&#39;t even list their phone number that I can see, so you can get that here on yelp."

The guacamole, rice and refried beans are nothing to write home about, but the main meat of the meal is; pretty obscure stuff also resides on the menu (never heard of Tacos Arabes before, for example) and worth looking at.

It&#39;s my favorite place to eat. The service is friendly, knowledgeable, and they work hard. This joint is often jumping with people coming in for take out or eat in. 

I love that this restaurant is a family affair. You can often see multiple generations working together. I love the food. To the reviewer who suggested that reviewers were just friends and family writing reviews, I need to correct you. My blonde hair and blue eyes would suggest I&#39;m not related to the people who own this establishment. I don&#39;t associate with them in any capacity other than a business one. 

However, after dining here since 2011, I feel like these are my friends who gladly welcome me with open arms and warm hearts. This is home cooking at its finest. They make their own tortillas!! The refried beans are the best in the area. And have you had the jalapeño green sauce? Also homemade. 

Today I had the sopes. They were delicious. Everyone we bring loves Teca. (Including my 85 year old mom who fought with me over the beans.) You should come. It&#39;s good."

I loved the selection of Mexican beers. We&#39;ll definitely  be back."

I think what&#39;s happened here is that friends and family have posted good review. The food is the worst Mexican I&#39;ve ever had. Dry, flavorless and poor in every way. I was looking forward to a new place. It&#39;s basically a kitchen they threw a couple of tables around and serve.  3 salsas are weird tasting. One is creamy with an overpowering garlic heart. Gosh I can still taste it in the back if my throat. All four of us ordered different things. The feedback was all the same. It was so bad it killed the evening."

The staff was supremely friendly and welcoming, service was attentive but not overbearing, and (most importantly) the food was excellent.  I had the combination with a taco, tostada, and chile relleno and the wife had steak tacos.  It was thumbs up all around.  The pico de gallo was a real treat, too.

I had seen it and thought it was take out only, but they do have seating.

We go out for Mexican about once a week and pretty much have stopped going anywhere else.  This is really authentic and based on the family recipes of the owner.  Some of the waitstaff are granddaughters and as friendly as they come.

We like the chips and salsa, but my wife likes her sauces mild, so they bring out a red sauce that she loves.  I like a little more of a kick and they have a couple of creamy green sauces with a lot of flavor and character, including one made from pureed jalapeno!

Add a small side of guacamole for less than a buck!

The tacos are a great lunch for us. 2 tacos each and a bottle of Coca Cola de Mexico costs less $10.

Dinner selections are plentiful and affordable.  Try the carne asada and you can&#39;t go wrong with the burrito.

It has a lunch counter atmosphere and limited bar.

Authentic, affordable and muy bueno!"

It is a steak burrito packed full of all the standard ingredients but then it is smothered in ranchero sauce and cheese. It is big enough for two meals but so hard to resist eating the whole thing. They offer plenty of more authentic food too. I was pleased to see that like BM, they have Tacos Arabe. They also have a birreria stew.

Short description: Family run deli for my building

Pluses:
I&#39;m very biased, but this is the best food place I&#39;ve ever had near my work place, including down town.  But it is the perfect storm of great service and good food.

First, service.  Julie runs the front of the house, does an amazing job, will generally remember your name after maybe two visits.  Your food will be prepared in a hurry and you can either take it out or they&#39;ll bring it out to you.  And that food is prepared by her family, for you.  If there&#39;s something you like available, Julie will point it out.  I rarely escape without putting avocado on things.

They make a REALLY solid sandwich, like you would get at home (If your family cared for you).  You ask for a turkey sandwich on white, you get a beautiful turkey sandwich.  I know it&#39;s just turkey, but it is exactly what you want in one.  And it is quite affordable too.

At this point, I&#39;ve worked in this building a year, and I&#39;ve tried everything they&#39;ve made except maybe the GFY (Good For You).   You see, they have daily specials that are unique to the day.  Last week, they had a chicken wrap like thing that was amazing, I really wish I had written down what was in it because it was their best thing ever.

Or you can get their soup, their salad bar, and a cookie.  And while I don&#39;t really eat breakfast, their breakfast stuff is excellent.

Negatives: Taco salad day, Nacho day, and Pizza day are insane because it&#39;s SOOOO popular.  So call ahead if you&#39;re in a hurry, even though you&#39;ll still have to wait through the line.

Recommendations: If you work near Diehl and Mill, swing by here for lunch sometime.  Their double-decker turkey club is fantastic but it&#39;s a lot of food.  And their Devli&#39;s Food cake is awesome.

Disclaimer: This is for my in-building deli.  And I&#39;m the duke.  But it really is good."

Apologized And asked to make it right! 

I feel that any company who takes the time to read and reply to a post from a unhappy customer, deserves more then a second chance. They earned it even if they made a mistake on my pizza. 

I will return and spend money there again just because they seem to actually care. Which is good business in my book.

My love for pizza is so real that when I traveled to India for a month back in 2006, the only thing I wanted to eat when I got back was some deep dish from LOUS. 

I wanted it so bad that I called and placed an order while waiting for my luggage at O&#39;Hare. That&#39;s some real #fatkid4lyf dedication. 

Lou&#39;s is the real deal. It is my go to pizza in the suburbs. It is absolutely amazing... I typically order just a pizza - medium with butter crust, half cheese, half spinach - deep dish. 

I&#39;m a vegetarian - so I totally appreciate the I uncut pizza option. Not only is it crunchier, it is meat tidbit free. I typically hate when I dine out and I can see the same knife being used to cut meaty things and then my food. Not here. Lou&#39;s doesn&#39;t disappoint.

I grew up in the downtown Chicago area eating Uno&#39;s, Due&#39;s, Dino&#39;s, Gino&#39;s and Gino&#39;s East Pizza (in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s before they were all ruined) and in the 80&#39;s I was a Pizza snob that thought of Lou Malnati&#39;s as suburban &#34;Chicago Style Pizza Wanna Be&#34;

Guess they showed me.

When friends and family come to town and they want real Chicago Styled Pizza, we get Lou Malnati&#39;s.

The places of my youth are gone, or are a caricature of their former selves. Franchising, tourism and fame has ruined them (some are still 4 * pizza&#39;s, but...)

Lou Malnati&#39;s has expanded without destroying themselves.

Their Buttercrust Sausage Pizza is edible artistry. Thank goodness they are still around and haven&#39;t compromised themselves.

I always found it okay...but not great. That being said, I had not tasted Lou in many years, so I took it as a chance to introduce my wife (who is not from Chicago) to a new place that she had not tried before.

We ordered a medium sausage pizza online and was able to pick it up about 40 minutes later - not bad considering it was a busy evening. There were a lot of people waiting in the small store front and it was definitely cluttered, but did not have to wait long.

So as for the pizza - I will say that I am not a fan of the sausage &#34;patty&#34;. I much prefer the crumbled. The sausage itself was fine, but lacked a ton of flavor. And the cheese...just way too much cheese. I know many people love Lou Malnati&#39;s for this reason, but not I. The crust, too, was just okay. All in all, it&#39;s an okay pizza, but I believe it&#39;s truly overhyped and I will keep going elsewhere.

That crust is absolutely divine and puts me in a food coma alone.

Recently I&#39;ve just been ordering their ready made pizzas which aren&#39;t as custom as an order.   They do the job as well.   Been back multiple times and sure I&#39;ll be back again."

Lou Malnati&#39;s rivals Gino&#39;s East and Giordano&#39;s as one of the top pizza chains in the Chicagoland area. This particular location is carryout or delivery only. Typically, the wait is about 45 minutes before your pizza is ready for pick-up. You&#39;ll need to be very patient if you expect them to deliver to you.

What I like about Lou Malnati&#39;s pizza is their crusts. The crusts on the deep dish are tasty and its edges are crispier than any of their competitors&#39;. The rest of the ingredients are great but their crusts really set them apart.

Although they aren&#39;t as expensive as some deep dish pizzeria&#39;s, it&#39;s definitely not cheap. So be prepared to shell out some dough, so to speak.

Insider tip: When ordering, be sure to tell them you&#39;d like to cut the pizza yourself. This way, you can control the size of your slices because they tend to cut in weird or large pieces.

If you&#39;re craving some deep dish but don&#39;t want to leave the house, be sure to order from Lou&#39;s."

The food is always top notch and the service is almost always superb.  Sure, sometimes they run out of the cinnamon root beer they brew, but I won&#39;t deduct a star for that because everything else is completely off the charts.

The only real negative I could state is trying to go there on a Friday or Saturday evening and expecting to be able to find parking in a reasonable amount of time.  We usually go there in the afternoon if we go on either of those two days because of this.

It might be because we usually go when it is not super busy, but we usually don&#39;t have to wait to be seated long or at all.  The servers we get are usually pretty friendly and one of them even greets us when we see him even if we don&#39;t have him that visit.  Service at a lot of restaurants these days often leaves much to be desired but this is one place that has not forgotten that part of a good visit is good service.

They have great beers, good food, and entertainment often. It&#39;s a huge venue with a restaurant, three bars, a coffee lounge, and multiple party rooms. You&#39;ll often see weddings and private parties taking place here.

Last time I was in we can to see a friend&#39;s band (Joker&#39;s Rival - they&#39;re awesome!). Originally we called ahead to reserve a table in their restaurant area, but they said they were no longer taking reservations for the night. We decided to head there about 6 pm anyway to see if we could get a seat. 

We were told it would be about 30 minutes when we got there, so we grabbed a spot up at the bar, but then my dad decided to check the back bar room for seating and they told us we could grab a seat and order food right away. Pretty confusing situation and their communication was obviously lacking, but it ended up working out well. We were able to get a table for eight right away in the room where the band would be playing. Our server was great and took our orders immediately.

I tried their version of a long island, but it was way too tart for me. I think it was just from the flavor of the beer this cocktail is mixed with. I ended up switching drinks with my mom and drank her beer. I then stuck with drinking Wobble all night, because that&#39;s my fave! They have a ton of awesome items on their menu. Our table started with a couple orders of the Beer Brezen which are three delicious Domaine Dupage organic pretzels, Cane and Ebel stone ground mustard, and Sidekick beer cheese sauce ($8). We got an order of their chips and dip too which were house-cut potatoes with their Sidekick beer cheese sauce and spicy ranch dip ($7). Both were really good appetizer options, but I preferred the pretzels. A must try!

My mom and I decided to split a few small plates for dinner. Our server was helpful in making suggestions and letting us know which small plates were bigger than others so we could decide how much to order for two people. We went with the beer mussels ($12), short rib risotto ($10), and pork belly tacos ($7).

The steamed mussels were amazing (and a whole pound btw!). The Ebel&#39;s Weiss broth was simply delicious and I&#39;m really glad it came with two large pieces of bread for dipping. Short rib risotto was pretty good too, but not worth $10 in my opinion. Pork belly tacos were delicious and perfect for splitting between two people.

Overall this is a great venue and if you like Two Brothers beer you&#39;ll want to come hang out here. Everyone who works here really has an awesome attitude and provides great customer service. The Roundhouse is always hosting different bands, comedians, etc. so it&#39;s sure to be a good time!"

Checked it out on yelp and had to check it out.  This is a very cool venue.  I won&#39;t go into the history and all those details, because that&#39;s one of things to find out while you&#39;re here.  Also find the fact/history book they have, it&#39;s a fun read with some cool interesting facts.

The bar/restaurant area is very nicely done.  Large bar, lots of space in the restaurant area.  A nice outdoor seating area with fireplaces everywhere.  The staff here was very friendly and professional.  

There was just two of us, so we sat at the bar, got the low down on the place talking with the bartenders and started off the night with some of their beers and the smoked cheddar and spinach dip.  This was one of the best dips I&#39;ve had in a long time, and the bread was very good!  For the main, we just went with several small plates and the fish tacos because everything just sounded very good, we wanted to try as much as we could.
Beer mussels:  wonderful dish, and the broth was very tasty, you get a good portion for two people to share
Short rib risotto:  Short rib meat was amazing, very succulent and the risotto wasn&#39;t too bad, just a little too cheesy for my taste, but I can&#39;t complain to much, who doesn&#39;t like cheese?
Fish tacos:  very good, nice and fresh tasting

If I could physically eat all night, I would have ordered one of each of the small plates, they all sound that good.  If I&#39;m ever back in the area, I will definately make it a priorty to come back here again."

I&#39;ve been to Two Brothers in Warrenville. I respect their move to take this location over, but this location has always seemed to have a rough time."

The only vegan one is tacos, which was a plate so small I almost didn&#39;t see it when the waitress put it on the table, and the tacos, while delicious, were a tiny warm up that cost about $11. And because there was nothing else vegan on the menu that looked filling, and because I&#39;m not made out of cash, I left hungry. Hungry, and dreaming about their amazing enchiladas of yore.

Boo. I won&#39;t be back. Even though this place used to be epic and amazing and all of my family members rave about it. They don&#39;t have food that satisfies that also caters to different types of diets and eaters. No thanks. 

I was actually really bummed because I kept raving about the place to my sister, and when we arrived we both looked at the menu like D-:   ...my sister thinking &#34;yeah right, Alyssa&#39;s such an exaggerator&#34; and I was like &#34;OMG this sucks and now Alanna is going to think I&#39;m the worst at picking restaurants and she&#39;s never going to want to visit me again.&#34;"

I&#39;ve never been disappointed with their food. It is a different, more refined menu than what they offer at the taphouse. 

Cobb salad is as good as it can be for a salad. I recently had the walleye with potato pancakes (whaaaat?) and it was delicious! The others in my party also enjoyed their dishes of mussels, Mac and cheese, and the sea bass.

Oh yeah, and it&#39;s Two Brothers so we know the beer is awesome."

Server recommendation -- Mushroom risotto (small dish): taste: 4/5 (being generous), presentation: 2. plain and bland, if anything it is filling. As for how it came out on the plate well you see it. the cheese on top was stiffly cold and I would have hoped the dish was varied with mushrooms and in color it was uniform, dishearteningly looked like slop tossed on a plate by the spoonful, suggesting spooned and reheated."

My boyfriend and I shared 3 small plates. We got the pork belly tacos, steak tacos, and mussels. The pork belly tacos consisted of two tacos and didn&#39;t taste or look like any pork belly I&#39;ve ever had in the past. There was no color or flavor to the pork, and basically looked like it was the fat trimmings from a pork chop. It was so white, we thought they gave us fish at first. The steak was average, overly cooked, and something I could&#39;ve made better. The toppings for both tacos consisted of onions and a little cilantro.  The mussels had decent flavor, but it was just mussels in broth with 3 jalapeño slices. Nothing special. Also, we had about 5-6 mussels that weren&#39;t opened (and if they don&#39;t open, that means they aren&#39;t any good) so that was disappointing. 

The waiter got my drink order wrong.  I had never tried their beer before, so I didn&#39;t notice until I got the bill because it had a different beer name (which was a higher price).

I&#39;m pretty sure we won&#39;t be back."

First parking here is a dangerous proposition, but no worries they are on trend with valet parking, which makes my head spin off...this is Aurora, Il, not Rodeo Drive.  The place is massive, and getting a seat possible on a  beautiful Saturday evening at six makes you wonder? What&#39;s up with that? I figured it out. The food is god awful.... Chesse plate was slices of cheese that obviously came out of packages presliced, small chunks of dried apricot and a wasteful amount of honey. Nothing to serve the honey from the condiment cup. The cheese was a low quality...very waxy. One plus- water crackers. Had  more small plates. An artichoke stuffed with goat cheese...I can not even explain the level of awful. And the visual looked like a cake used in a mens urinal. Served cold on a bed of what I think was cabbage. Beef sliders, these resembled chucks found in dog food, with green peppers and a sauce that resembled chop suey. Let me say the beef was like stale old bubble gum. At this point I did not want to try anything else.

We&#39;ve been here a couple of times for food, most recently for Oktoberfest, and each time is worse than the last. 
I&#39;ve been to Germany 4 times and can say you miss the mark on traditional German food. Schnitzel should be tenderized to a thin slice, then breaded and fried. It shouldn&#39;t be an inch thick and tough to cut. Potato pancakes should be made with real, shredded potatoes and onions. Even the ones that come from a box mix taste better than what was served today. And $6 for one so-called pancake, are you kidding me?!? Because I was so disappointed with the &#34;German&#34; food, I ordered nachos to share with my group. Even the nachos were mediocre at best. Where are the jalapeños? How about some hot sauce? 
I encouraged my friends to come here today and I&#39;m sorry I did. I know I&#39;m not the only customer to complain about the food.

Along with me was 20 of my family members, including 6 children ranging from several different ages from 5 months to 17 years old.  We called ahead because we were not sure of seating.  They were very accommodating, seating all together on their fully encompassed patio.

The patio included areas that were covered and shaded from the sun, areas that were open and allowed the sun in, an area with 3 stone fireplaces, and an area that had lounge patio furniture chairs for relaxation.  

In the middle of the patio was a gazebo for a live band.  The music was good, but a bit loud to talk when playing, but they did not start until 9, which gave us plenty of time to talk beforehand.   

The parking lot was packed, due to another local event.  But they offered free valet parking.  

They brew their own beer.  I am not a fan of beer and rarely drink it.  However, I do enjoy their Dog Days brew, which is seasonal.  

We ordered the nachos and pretzels (Beer Brezen).  Both were pretty good.  You only get two pretzels, but there were good size.  The nachos were a large portion and easily enough to feed 2 for a meal.  

Our server, Jamie, was friendly and full of sass, but in a good way.  I was sarcastic with her and she right back at me.  Made the night more enjoyable.  It should be noted that before speaking with me, she was not sarcastic with the rest of the group.

Overall a very nice experience with good food and great service."

The other thing that&#39;s awesome about Two Brothers is the coffee shop.  They ate seriously talented here, both drinks and food are fantastic.

The meat was incredible and the bun tasted like it was just baked, (which is very possible because it&#39;s a brewery AND a bakery).  The server said Two Brothers not only brew beer, but their own coffee.  So they have the cafe for the early morning people, the restaurant / bar for the lunch and dinner crowd, and they have a back tavern with a huge screen for sports and other entertainment.  After I finished the burger I just had to try something from the bakery, so I went with the carrot cake.  It couldn&#39;t have been fresher or more delicious!

We got there at 6:30 pm and the room was packed already. Luckily, friends came before us and we were able to find a table for the evening. As with the restaurant, this place can get pretty loud and I had to shout to talk to the person next to me. The food is pretty good, but I seem to remember it being better in previous times. I had a grilled chicken sandwich with mashed potatoes. I picked mashed potatoes because the other two at my table had fries that had come out cold. The chicken sandwich was dry and I had to dip it in ketchup so it wasn&#39;t quite so dry.

The beers are really great, but somewhat disappointed the porter is no longer available. The bartender was taking food orders at the bar which slowed things down. Probably would&#39;ve been good to have a waiter/waitress or a few just to keep things going in the food orders department. 

Previous visits have been good, food has been good. Previous visits were 5 stars, this one was 3-4 stars, so I&#39;ll stick with 4 stars for here, for now."

I love the food, the beer, the service, the ambiance. I&#39;m a huge fan. I think I get a different meal every time I go, and I always love it.

This Sunday, I went to Ocktoberfest, and was slightly disappointed. The outside seemed great, and we sat in the area with the big screen/high top tables etc. and it seemed understaffed. The waitress was busting her butt, but it was just her and one bartender, so service was slow. We ordered food, and it was mostly good, but the pork shnitzel was really under cooked. It was really hard to cut through, and you could see the middle was really not cooked. Not as big of a deal as if it were chicken, but still. There was a point where the waitress took our drinks to get more and pretty much forgot about us. Not a big deal, she was nice, but not very apologetic.

As a restaurant, this is one of my favorite places to visit when I happen to find myself in the western burbs or meeting up with friends/family outside the city.  The food is excellent and the beer is delicious and ever changing.  I haven&#39;t experienced any of the entertainment that they bring in on weekend nights, but I really love coming here for lunch.

As an event venue the Roundhouse really knows how to make an event run smoothly.  I fell in love with the space after my best friend&#39;s wedding reception.  So much so that I also eventually decided to have my wedding here.  There are two different venue spaces available for larger or smaller weddings, there are several good food packages available to choose from, and their recommended vendors were all very easy to work with.  And of course, you get to pick your favorite Two Brothers beers to have on tap.  :)  Our coordinator was very professional.  She saw to all of our requests and made sure we were running smoothly and on time.  When we had to make the call to bring our ceremony indoors out of the rain, she had everything moved and signage updated in no time.  When ALL of my out-of-state family decided my wedding was the event of the year and I suddenly found myself anticipating 20 more guests than i&#39;d originally estimated they had no trouble mapping out room for a couple more.  I really can&#39;t recommend this venue enough.  They were simply wonderful to work with."

We started out with a scallop appetizer. It was ok. Bacon wrapped and served on a pile of squash shavings and an apple compote of some sort that reminded me of spiced apple rings. Over all for 3 scallops it was $12 and frankly they didn&#39;t have much flavor other than the addons and garnish for  that. 

On to the entrees. I got a roundhouse burger was supposed to be done medium rare. Well the plastic stick said medium and the burger said medium well. It also had the appearance of a pre made frozen patty. You know the look by the sides of it. And the fact that it just didn&#39;t taste like fresh ground beef. Really had no flavor asides from the bacon and chile that was on it. Even the BBQ sauce had no taste to speak of. 

My husband got the Ruben. Which is supposed to have corned beef brisket on it according to the menu. It was well done roast beef. Easy to tell as it was grey and not pink like a corned beef is supposed to be and it wouldn&#39;t shred like a good brisket should. 

The home cut fries were good. 

All in all for an appetizer two sandwiches that were disappointing and one beer and two sodas it was 60.00. I don&#39;t mind paying premium prices when the food is done well. This was not up to snuff at all.  Disappointed doesn&#39;t begin to describe this."

We got engaged in the Cognac Bar, married in the gazebo and needless to say had our reception here as well (one of the first weddings held here). We even have a personalized brick in the courtyard too. Heck, my wife even teases (I hope) I&#39;ll be waked here. That said we have a special affection for this place. 
Needless to say the beer is excellent with a variety to choose from. The menu is extensive from burgers, seafood, steaks, seafood, and more. Don&#39;t forget to leave room for dessert, I would recommend the Swiss Chocolate Chalet Cake and the Italian Lemon Creme Cake too! 

After dinner don&#39;t forget to enjoy the many choices of entertainment either outside on the patio or inside at one of the bars. Have too much to drink? Don&#39;t be a putz and drink and drive, Comfort Suites is literally next door. Wake up in the morning and need a good cup of coffee? Two Brothers has you covered with their Roundhouse Cafe too.

Things could have been done better but that may have been at the cost restrictions of the couple so I won&#39;t fault the venue for that. 
Food was served buffet style. I had the Caesar salad which was a bit over dressed but at least a tasty dressing. There was chicken which was flavorful and not dry, a vegan enchilada option that you would never know was vegan that even had vegan cheese on it and some veal I didn&#39;t care for at all which wasn&#39;t marked as such. Maybe someone quit that night or something because our waters were always empty and the coffee guy walked around when we still had dinner in front of us. It all just felt a bit disjointed.

Live music with no cover is also a bonus. I&#39;d happily start paying a cover if it kept the audience to music-listeners only. Great local art during First Fridays at The ArtBar in the tavern.

If you haven&#39;t been here, it is literally a giant round building that is something like 150 years old.  I was originally used to rotate locomotives on the track to send them in the other direction.  That being said, it is a doughnut shaped building that has multiple bars and and sitting areas.  Really a unique setup.

We really enjoyed the food served at the wedding.  We were lucky that the wedding reception was held at the Roundhouse as the Blackhawks Game 7 was going on at the same time.  There were more than enough televisions to sneak out and watch whenever you could get away!

I had been here a few times since then - all when it was still Walter Payton&#39;s - and wasn&#39;t impressed every time. 

I&#39;ve only been here once before since Two Brothers bought it - for my brother&#39;s wedding - and I obviously do not remember it because I was very, very drunk. This last time my husband and I went and color me surprised: the food was great! The beer, however, was sub par compered to the beer they serve at their tap house down the road. The mere fact that they had bone marrow here is impressive in and of itself. That shit was delicious greasy paradise. Every day I&#39;m grateful I don&#39;t have a gallbladder anymore.

I love their little coffee shop inside and it bears mentioning that they have different beer on tap at the cafe than they do in the restaurant. I was able to try a mango chili pepper beer that was one of the weirdest drinks I&#39;ve ever had but damn it was tasty."

It was a gorgeous day so we decided to sit outside and mooch off of the free wifi.  At first our waiter did not come over right away but I think that was my fault when I said we were going to be hanging out for a bit and wasnt sure about food.  As always the beer list is decent.  I ordered the pretzel with mustard and beer cheese and it was absolutely delightful.  I have no clue how they make it the consistency that they do.  It is very different than any other I have eaten (in a good way). My colleague ordered the nacho and added pork.  Other than a few chips being soggy the flavors in these nachos were ridiculous.  We both proceeded to over eat a tremendous amount.  Our waiter was both attentive and cognizent of the fact that we were getting work done.  When he came by while on a conference call he was polite and made sure we were on mute before he began talking. I would love to work from here more often :-) but I will settle for a good hang out with friends as well.

The server couldn&#39;t tell us if the Arancini was made with spent grains from the brewing process, despite a huge barley flavor and no mention of it on the menu. Still not as good as the food at the taphpuse though, despite being a full service restaurant.

Beer was good, as Two Brothers typically is, but there were few (two?) selections not generally available in distribution. I expect more from to put the &#34;brew&#34; in &#34;brewpub&#34;.

Service was moderate, and she was clearly trying to make up for what happened earlier....

We were seated near a window and it was freezing cold! When our server came to the table we immediately asked to be moved, in hopes of dealing with the issue prior to starting service, and explained we were willing to wait.  She found someone who told us we&#39;d have to get in the back of the queue, despite waiting a while already.  Only when I asked for the manager did that second person explain she was the manager (no prior introduction) and that we cold deal with it or queue as if we&#39;d just walked in.  Our server finally asked some nearby friends (having drinks only at a dinner table, not the bar or &#34;tavern&#34; to switch tables. It was still cold, and we were uncomfortably physically and mentally.

Probably won&#39;t be back."

Of course it has great beer - seasonal varieties too, with sample sizes available. And it has a complete menu and makes good tasting food. Coffee shop area looked like a great place. Staff are competent and friendly and fun. 

What is standout is the atmosphere - the natural light that comes in the windows and the architecture of this historical building is beautiful. 

And they offer small plates - i had the smoked duck and cheese grits small plate - great flavors! 

Aurora is lucky to have this restaurant, coffee shop and tavern. It would be a great place to have a party at too."

Ordered some entrees here - we had pot roast and meatloaf. Both were pretty good with decent sides as well. Not a bargain by any means, though not a bank breaker either. I opted for a couple of Sidekicks - a fairly light Two Brother&#39;s brew which was good.

Came in part to watch the Hawks play game 4 of the Stanley Cup championship - good viewing TV-wise, though their large screen is a little fuzzy and somewhat archaic. Ordered a Grand Marnier - but they don&#39;t carry that. Instead, the server offered up a ginger liqueur option. I decided to get another beer instead, but the server persisted with a sample and I will say his recommendation was good. I&#39;ll put that on tap for next time. 

As when it was Payton&#39;s the place is still huge and it puzzles me how a place can make enough money here to pay for all the real estate. While we were here on a Monday night, this place was for the most part pretty dead even with a major game going on. It&#39;s a semi-central meeting spot for me and a friend from Yorkville, so I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back."

Nicole and Stephany were great to work with. Nicole was so helpful the day of our wedding. The ceremony and reception spaces are so architecturally beautiful that you don&#39;t need to decorate much if you don&#39;t want to - and if you have your reception in the ballroom, there are two fireplaces - one outside and one inside. There&#39;s a small staircase for entrances, the bartenders were nice. Everything turned out great. If you have a summer wedding and it&#39;s warm out maybe bring in some extra fans, the AC isn&#39;t super powerful. We got married on a 90degree day, and some guests told me that was their only complaint - was the reception hall was warm.

But your guests can drink beer during your ceremony and you can drink beer while you rehearse for you wedding - so that&#39;s pretty amazing.

The front bar and restaurant area is great too. Friendly service, love that coffee bar. The beers are of course excellent. The food is just OK up front. I really wish you could get some of the awesome wedding food up front, I think it&#39;s a little better, but I like their salads in the restaurant quite a bit. I also like being able to watch weddings, it&#39;s a super fun bonus if you&#39;re there during one."

She had a chicken tostada small plate with a side of beans and rice; I had the stuffed poblano pepper with beans and rice. It took over 30 minutes to get our food, which was barely lukewarm when it arrived. We complained; the manager comped the food. Beer: I had the Revelry Imperial Red Ale - fabulous! My wife sampled two beers (can&#39;t remember the first one, the second was the Peppermint Bark seasonal, which was good). We might give it another try, but the food was a bit overpriced.

I&#39;m not sure about the layout and how that constrains things. The bar is not very large and seems to double as a clearing station for dishes. This is utterly ridiculous. It is hardly appetizing to sit in a space where dirty food dishes are being brought, scraped off into a garbage can 3 feet away, then piled into one of several dish bins on the floor under the bar (in plain site from where we sat). They need to create a separate station for this elsewhere or take the dishes to the kitchen! We definitely won&#39;t sit in the bar again.

Service was okay. The excuse for our food being brought out cold was that there was a big ticket filled just ahead of us. That&#39;s not likely, as we saw two couples who arrived after we did receive their food ahead of us.

Maybe next time, we&#39;ll just stick to beer."

Well the cheese plate here consisted of the assorted cheese slices and the assorted cracker assortment from Restaurant Depot.  So these lame rubber cheeses were already pretty sliced and arrayed some deli platter from Jewel and cost $18!!!  So no labor, no fine cheeses and no artisinal cheeses and they charge that much.  I estimate about $16 of margin in that joke of a cheese plate.  Then the &#34;stuffed&#34; artichoke came which was nothing like a stuffed artichoke.  It was some mush from an ice cream scoop on top of a canned cold artichoke heart.  Brutal.  The ceviche was decent but they threw it on top of premade tortilla chips.  Wow.

Finally the bacon sausage was pretty good but that was premade so they just had to heat it up.  I could have done that at home which is where I should have ate and saved $80.  

The beer is good.  Buy some st a liquor store.  The server was good.  He should go work somewhere better."

Place is pretty cool and has a nice ambience. Our server came over quickly and we got a couple of beers. This is the highlight here. The food is just so so. We had a couple of small plates which were better than the entrees. We got the beef stroganoff special, the stuffed chicken (no stuffing at all) and fish tacos. The fish tacos were the best of everything. The stroganoff was soupy with linguini noodles. Odd flavor. Not really anything to write home about. Odd flavor and color and like soup. Yuck. The stuffed chicken wasn&#39;t stuffed and was just bland. We all tried each other&#39;s dishes.

We started by glancing over the menu they have it in sections  Small plates, starters, and entres...We almost didnt  end up comming to this place as i called to ask if they had the fried brusselspouts,, and the girl said  no we dont have that,, when i talked to her i asked how long they were open till  said on the internet till eleven, she said the was the bar, but the restraunt closes at 9, i said does it closes at 9 or do i have to be seated BY 9, she then said well the kitchen closes at 8pm??

Somewhere we just lost an hour , so a bit rushed we are only 5 minutes away , i said to wifey lets hurry up and go.  When we got there we found out the restraunt was still  SITTING people at 9pm this was the time we left..So im not really sure why they told us that...let me continue...The food is overpriced A BIT,  this place is very laid back in dress code as it should be its a brewery but the prices AVE were 10-12 for a salad  the ruben usually  other places i go is about 9-10  this was 14..I had the freid brusselsprouts  THEY DID HAVE THEM....a pint of the edel weiss beer, and the soup of the day..Red bel pepper soup..the soup was very good. 

The brusselsprouts were a HUGE amount for 8 bucks was a great deal...and were by them selve  OK...but with the somewhat spicey dipping sauce  was excellent//// My wife had the 12 salad, and she said that sauce for the brusselsrouts when added made the sald taste alot better,, the sald dressing was very bland she said...

We finished up with the chocolate cake  and carrot cake..  they were both  good and at a price of 7 bucks a piece is par for the course...

we spent 50 bucks not bad but nothing to brag about, i would probably go here again, the food was hot , and the service was  on par for nomality..we wanted something more than fast food, and less esquisite than table cloth dinning... 3out 5 thats all in can muster up in this visit ..."

The &#34;Small Plates&#34; menu is $11-$20 for a 3-oz portion of food.

The enchiladas are oddly seasoned and have a bitter sauce and way too much cilantro.

The Roasted Chicken Entree has what is described as a &#34;Portabello gravy&#34; but the sauce that comes with it has no mushrooms, is tart, bitter, and acidic. 

POSITIVE: The mashed potatoes, on the other hand are amazing!"

They do weddings as well, even if you are not doing a wedding this place is perfect for a big group or work outing. 

As for the drinks,  most are brews they make but they do have a cool selection of other beers that are unique (a bit expensive for those though) the food was pretty good too.

I got pot roast,  it was OK... fair at best.  Was a bit dried out probably because it was cooked to fast. 

Desert flour less chocolate cake or brownie.  Was ok tasted a little bit like a little Debbie brownie except dryer. 

So I hate to write a review but it&#39;s the truth.  Server  was good on a positive note 

They did remove the first meal but a manager did NOT come by to smooth anything over which is management 101 in a situation like this

When it was walter Payton it was off the hook delicious.  
The prices are cheaper now but the food quality reflects that. If I go back it&#39;s because we&#39;ll who am I kidding I can&#39;t and won&#39;t food just wasn&#39;t good.  Keep in mind This is is coming from a guy that thinks olive garden has great food....."

There wasn&#39;t anything too great to bring us back. Before it was Two Brothers, we craved their nachos, dinner rolls, salads, etc. we were excited to go there. Now it is just functional: a fine dinner but not a memorable one.

I had a Reuben that used sliced brisket instead of corned beef. Great to be creative but honestly it didn&#39;t add anything. It tasted like a beef sandwich with Swiss and sauerkraut - nothing more.

The place seemed to have cool history and a brief glimpse of the menu seemed promising, and I vowed to return. We had friends in town this weekend and I didn&#39;t know what the hell to do with them in the burbs on a Friday night, so we ventured over here. I re-checked out the menu in the car and was super excited about their small plate options.

We were seated immediately in an emptyish dining room and waited for our server. And waited and waited. And waited. When our server finally arrived, we decided to order drinks AND food, just in case. He was very flustered by this decision, especially since someone in our group ordered two samples of beer in addition to their drink, and I ordered water with my diet coke.

For food, we had a pretty mixed bag - my husband got the cheese plate (market price - $12), I ordered the marrow toasts, his friends got fish tacos and mussels (with no selection of broth, despite the menu indicating he had an option). Friend&#39;s girlfriend got the fish tacos. Our server scurried off, and we waited.

And waited.

Twenty minutes later, our food arrived, but we still didn&#39;t have drinks. One of the more outspoken members of our party pointed this out to the server who brought our food, who looked genuinely mortified at the service we were receiving and ran to get the guy. He had that &#34;oh sh*t!&#34; look on his face, and ran off toward the bar. About 5 minutes after that, our drinks arrived, except for mine... The diet coke. What?! He apologized and ran off again, but it was seriously annoying to not even have a beverage when trying to eat, especially a particularly heavy item like bone marrow.

When he came back with my drink, he could tell we were annoyed - but instead of apologizing and taking our obvious cues of &#34;go away,&#34; he sat on the table next to ours and launched into this absurdly long, convoluted, not-entirely-true-sounding story about how the bartenders accidentally dropped all of our drinks and then broke a bottle of wine and then broken things were everywhere which prevented him bringing us drinks because things were broken. Being in customer service as a field of employment myself, I HATE this tactic - unfortunately, bashing someone in a different part of the building is really just relaying to the customer that the place where you ALL work doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s crap together - it does not somehow absolve you of some dissatisfaction.

As far as the food goes, opinions were all across the board. The fish tacos were great but doused so heavily in sauce that they had to be eaten with a fork and knife. My marrow toasts were good but the garlic lemon toast was an extraordinarily heavy accompaniment - marrow is about as indulgent as it gets, I promise plain or dry seasoned toast would work. The mussels came with an odd stalk of lemongrass jammed in the bowl of broth. The cheese plate was nothing special or unique. It seemed as though they&#39;d cut the cheese they use on burgers into squares and put it on a plate. All in all, it could have been better. I think I&#39;d go back and try more stuff if I was guaranteed not to have our server, but I wouldn&#39;t repeat any of the items we tried.

The building itself is exceptionally cool and the crowd seemed fun enough, but we left right after eating because we didn&#39;t want to deal with trying to order another round of drinks, sadly. 

I may try the Roundhouse one more time for posterity, but it won&#39;t be for awhile. If you&#39;re looking for a unique place to get beer and food in Aurora, though, this cannot be the worst option to explore."

Maybe the burgers, steak and pot roast are better. This is certainly no place to order seafood. Good luck negotiating the parking lot.

My best guess, is because I knew it would be an ultra long review, as there are so many positive things to say!

To begin with, the food is fantastic. You can tell that the Chef takes a lot of pride in what he does. Even the simplest of dishes contain beautiful ingredients with a great presentation. The Brothers certainly feel the same way about their beer. They have a good base that is offered yearly, as well as multiple seasonal options. The non-Two Brothers craft brews they offer round out the mix. In terms of drinks, even the alcohol has a different spin. The spiced rum is NOT Captain Morgan. What it is, is deliciousness in a glass that reminds you of Christmas - sugar, spice, and everything nice. It&#39;s like a gift to your tastebuds. 

I&#39;ve been here a lot. For as incredible as the food is, I have a hard time weaning my way from the fish tacos. They are fantastic! Only two tacos, but still a good portion and I rarely finish it all. The fish and batter are fresh and crunchy, the slaw is light and creamy, and I love that they quickly pan fry the tortilla so it&#39;s both crispy and warm.

Really though, you can&#39;t go wrong here when it comes to ordering food. Everything I&#39;ve had is delicious. And while the fish tacos stole my heart from the start, every now and then I order something different. I particularly love that I can order several small plates as a meal - tapas-style!

Lastly on the food/drink, is the coffee counter on the right hand side of the entrance. We ordered a few latte&#39;s the last time around, and they were fantastic. Creamy, rich, and FRESH. I didn&#39;t know a latte could taste so good.

Now that I&#39;ve reviewed what most of you want to read, let&#39;s talk about my favorite part: the venue as a wedding location. Nicole Cook is freaking amazing, and made everything about our wedding incredibly smooth and easy. We had a Fall-themed wedding, and this couldn&#39;t have been a better location. The fireplaces were lit and beautiful, the outdoor ceremony was perfectly organized, and the service on the day-of was more than I could have asked for. I&#39;m 100% biased, but I think the food was the best I&#39;ve ever tasted. Since it&#39;s part of a restaurant, you get the added bonus of real chefs working on your plates. Our guests had an incredible time, and there&#39;s not a thing I would change about this venue. 

Wedding tips: 
-Negotiate. Most brides don&#39;t, but you can. We ended up getting the entire floor downstairs, even though we didn&#39;t have the max amount of guests to fill it.
-Get what you want. If you don&#39;t want soup and just want a salad? No problem, just apply the money you would have spent on the soup, on appetizers or late night snacks.
-Use your planner as a resource. They&#39;ve all been doing this for a long time, and they are experts. Trust them!"

I brought my family and requested a table.  They asked if I had a reservation, and I explained that they were unwilling to give me one, but I was told that I could get a table when I walked in.  The hostess told me that they were completely booked, and it would be three hours before they accommodate us.

They have real shows, for some people you wouldn&#39;t believe would be performing in a little bar area.

It can get crowded.  I&#39;d suggest you get there a little bit earlier then any event starts to make sure you get a good seat.

Then there&#39;s the restaurant, which is very good.  I love the nacho&#39;s here.  Also, you can&#39;t go wrong ordering one of their burgers.  Just order the next level up of what you would want.  For instance, if you want Medium Rare, then order Medium.  I found this out the hard way, but since I have changed my preference.

I&#39;ve never been to a banquet here but the area looks cool.

I just wish they&#39;d re-open the absinthe bar.  That place was so amazing.  I spent way to much money in there.  Also they used to have like acoustic folk singer type acts in there.

They might not realize what they actually have in that little section where the absinthe bar is/was... that bar was actually 1 of 3 lighted bars from the 1893 Chicago&#39;s World Fair.   It&#39;s such a cool piece of history to be locked up in a room that is never really utilized."

It has a lodge feel to it and is very cozy in the winter.  The beer selection is amazing and the food is pretty good.  This place has both a dining area and a bar area that can accommodate a lot of people.  There&#39;s also a huge area outside, which I think is used for banquets during the summer.  The menu is creative and offers bar food with a twist.  The fish tacos and pork belly tacos are always a hit with the group.

Reuben Sandwich - The Reuben isn&#39;t very Reubeny as the meat is more beefy and brown rather than reddish and peppery.  However, it was a great tasting sandwich.  The fries are fresh cut and also good.

Pretzels - Comes with 2 large pretzels and mustard dipping sauce.  I wasn&#39;t a fan of the sauce and wish they had something more cheesy.

Small plate ravioli - This dish was fresh and delicious.

They also offered fried okra for $5 that I might try next time.

Although they offer a huge variety of craft beer, I typically go for the light and refreshing Ebel Weiss (20oz/$6).  Some of the other choices includes: Outlaw, Domain Dupage, The Bitter End, Cane and Ebel, Two Hearted, Revelry...

There&#39;s also a store section by the entrance where you can pick up apparels, beer to go and even ground coffee."

I made a reservation on a Saturday afternoon as we originally thought we&#39;d have a group of at least 8, we ended up being a group of 5 because people like to cancel at the last minute or just not show and I have no control over that.  But, given the last minute decision to make a reservation they were able to accommodate us.  When we got there, they wouldn&#39;t seat us until half our group was there but as soon as we were all there we were seated promptly at our table already set with glasses of water and menus.

So yes, as others have said the parking isn&#39;t great - big place...small parking lot but they do have complimentary valet.  I decided to lap the parking lot one more time before deciding on valet but luckily I found a decent spot.

There wasn&#39;t a huge wait as again, this place is pretty big for those waiting without reservations.  While we were waiting for the rest of our group to arrive we grabbed beers in the bar area.

After we ate we headed in the room where the band was playing (no cover, yay!)  The service in there was good, even being a packed room and all.

Don&#39;t be dissuaded by the 1 star and 2 star reviews about service.
Tables are clean and setting is 2 star. 
 This is not exactly a white glove service 4 star ambience restaurant.
The waiters are not trying to be rude or disinterested. They simply are untrained waiters. The way they behave is their normal self. Nothing against us, the customers. 
Don&#39;t expect professional waiter service. Just expect very good food! 

The food is quite authentic south Indian food. We chose the non vegetarian thali. It is a plate with Chicken biryani in the middle dish and about 8 small cups with various curries, soup, rices and a desert. i assume that this is served only at lunch time. The food was very good. They have what is called &#34;podi rice&#34; - rice mixed with spiced powder - it is quite authentic and good. By the way, they will be happy to bring you refills, for your thali. I prefer this to the buffet. Buffets are underpriced and overly fattened food that I always avoid - due to the high calorific content because of use of Crisco (I am told that many indian restaurants actually use something called Dalda - a version of Crisco but Dalda is banned for import but indian groceries import it anyway)..

Anyway, I would never eat in any buffet - especially buffets in Indian restaurant.
Therefore, this thali system was quite nice. 

I ordered a chicken apetizer from the main menu. Portion size is more like an Entree. The dish was very good - made of dark meat. My personal preference is dark meat. White breast meat is used for chicken tikka/butter chicken types of dishes. 

The biryani also came with thigh meat, which was perfectly cooked and is excellent. Typical Indian restaurants mix in sauce, chicken and rice and call it biryani. The authentic way to make biryani is to cook the chicken, spices and rice together. This biryani was made the authentic way and it was excellent. It was as good as any I have tasted in Hyderabad, which I had visited just two months ago. 
Hyderabad, of course, does have superior and amazing biryani places.. I am only comparing this to an average place in Hyderabad. 

If you enjoy south Indian food, this is a very nice restaurant to try. The food is from the southern states of Andhra/Telangana. Food tends to be spicy and medium hot. No reason for you to ask for extra hot. It is sufficiently spiced.

Even for the beverage we have to remind them again to serve it. Moving on to the food... I had Mysore Masala dosa which was not at all upto the mark to my previous experience elsewhere. I couldn&#39;t get the taste of authentic Mysore masala dosa.

Foreseeing a huge crowd we made sure to be seated at the restaurant by 12:15pm. Although tad early for Indian restaurants this particular one was packed 70% by the time we reached.

Having decided before hand to get the pre-set thali, we waited for our server to take our order. And there began the waiting saga! It took her a good 15+ minutes to just take our order. 

The thali prices are not exactly cheap but well worth the money in terms of food variety, taste &amp; quality. Never in the US have I had better thali food. Also it is an all you can eat kind, you just need to call the server going around the room with food containers, asking for a refill. (This type of service is pretty common in India)

After what seemed like an endless wait of a good 20-25 minutes our food did arrive. This I believe is an extremely long time since we had asked for a set meal and not ala carte. The wait for order giving and the food afterwards had us exasperated but one bite of the delicious food (Bliss!) and it seemed like all could be forgiven. But the issues of poor service continued to haunt us throughout the meal. 

Every time we needed a refill an endless wait would ensue. When the server did arrive at our table they would miss (every single time) to serve refills to all parties at our table.

Meanwhile we assumed a thali as good as this should have some awesome biryani. So well before finishing our meal, we ordered for a biryani takeaway. Long story short - by the time we finally finished our meal and got the biryani order it was 2:30pm. 

Spending 2hours &amp; 15minutes for a lunch of preset thali and takeaway is ridiculous. It saddens me so much to give 2 stars for this place because the thali was so bloody GOOD!! I am hoping very strongly that they pull themselves on the pathetic service. Clearly the front of the house and kitchen are in utter chaos.

1. Food is good, few are really good and few are just ok. CALL BEFORE YOU WALK-IN and ask if they&#39;re serving what your looking for.

2. Everytime I came I was said we ran out of food, we only have these, why open if you can&#39;t serve just the food you choose to be on menu. My last visit, people who were walking out and held the door for us to come in said they only have biryani if you were in mood for something else don&#39;t waste time. Don&#39;t forget to drive to a casino if you got what you came for, keep that winning lucky charm.

3. Worst service, I had walked to waiter, asked to come to our table to take our order, wait a long time so anyone of them would respond to your call asking for something else like more water, napkins. Prepare yourself for long wait to get waiters attention, deck of cards might help you to kill time.

4. Worst service, there you go, I wrote it again. The attitude of waiters will get you on your nerves. Play some soothing music when you drive back to your home or keep a punching bag in truck.

5. Ambience is bad, the place is too noisy. Please avoid if you&#39;re looking for a calm place for a dinner date, meet over lunch or something else. Grab your earplugs or talk really loud on your table.

I had my spoonful at this place, giving a miss hereafter. I am sure to put some words in other ears not to endure this."

I hosted a birthday party here and told to serve the food at 12 PM. The Hall was not ready until 10.30 am. They were making the call ready after 10:30 am only. And they kept lot of garbage and waste items in a corner of the hall and they did not remove it. Tables were not clean. They charged me 70$ per hour for the Hall.

Comparing the Other places in Naperville, Food is comparatively good here. But they behave and treat people like they serve great food.

They started to serve the food at 1:15 PM after we told them so many times to serve the food. And they served Veg Items first and brought Not-veg items after a long time 20-30 minutes. By the time Non-veg items were served, people already done with the Veg Items and it was not enough for Veg people. I had to order extra food for Veg people and they charged me the Menu price.

When I told the Caterer that I had to take back home Half tray of Veg Briyani and Half Tray of Chicken Briyani, he told me he could have exchanged Half Tray of Veg. Briyani for the Half tray of Chicken Briyani which was already served in the Buffet.

I was concerned about their quality standards when he said he would take back the food which was served already. Then would they serve the food to us which was taken from other parties?

They forced me to order extra food by serving the food very late and very disorganized way."

This is a good place to dine, and has relatively good food, but it&#39;s most certainly NOT WORTHY of five stars.

First of all, they have good tasting biryani, and quite a few selections, however, if you try a few of them, you&#39;ll come to realize they&#39;re similar tasting with a few spins to set them apart. Their Hyderabadi Chicken Dum Biryani is the most flavorful of them all, and the Vijayvada Special Chicken biryani is only more expensive because it&#39;s boneless chicken, not because it&#39;s any better. We ordered the Goat Pepper Fry, which I must admit was pretty flavorful, the curry dark and earthy, with the right punch of spices, spoiled only by the fact that the meat wasn&#39;t very tender. It was cooked through, but pretty chewy. The garlic naan was the best thing I tasted all night, and is DEFINITELY recommended. I ordered the &#34;double ke meetha&#34;, which to me would have been khubaani ka meetha, or a custard with a sauce of apricots, but it was actually soupy shahi tukdey - but maybe that&#39;s just the miscommunication of what a dessert actually is, versus my expectations. Lastly, the masala chai - let&#39;s just be honest, you CANNOT do masala chai justice by making it with a few cardamom pods in a damn percolator.

Lastly, the service definitely leaves something to be desired. They&#39;re all doing their job, but it is as if they&#39;re all forced to be there. They barely make any conversation, and there are no table touches or communication between taking the order, bringing it, and then bringing the check. Three stars does it. *shrugs*"

They have so much of rush and about 15-20 mins of wait time to get seated.

You can&#39;t see the face of the building from New York Street or from Rt.59. The neighboring businesses aren&#39;t exactly inviting, and the close big deal is Best Buy, which if you are like most folks, you want to get in, make your purchase and then get the hell away from there with all speed.
It was a day in which I knew I was going to have one shot at a meal. I was doing errands on rt 59, and had a hankering for Curry. Usually that means the Tamarind buffet on the flip side of New York, but then I remembered this place I had seen whilst escaping from Best Buy. I called to see if they had a buffet, and they said no, they had an &#34;Unlimited Thali&#34;. Ah! Promising! 
The place looks higher-end from the outside than what it is inside, which is basic-diner in appearance.
The place populated with Desi folk, a good sign. The meek waitress gave me a menu and a small piece of paper that spoke of &#34;Veg&#34; and &#34;Non-Veg&#34; Thali. This was the special the fella on the fone spoke of. 
I&#39;ve been a fan of Desi food for many years, and the more authentic the better. I didn&#39;t recognize a bunch of the dishes on the Thali list. This looked fab! I swung with the &#34;Non-Veg&#34;.
If you&#39;ve never had a Thali-it is a series of steel cups and bowls in a matching silver tray. Lots of little portions of different stuff. you remove the smaller cups and make combinations on the tray, which becomes your &#34;plate&#34;.
What came to the table was a remarkable fragrant and attractive/appetizing assortment. Rice, Meat, Curry, Dal, Raita, Sambar, Naan (those are general terms-the exact names I dont remember) with a nice Pappad on top! 
I dug in with zeal, and wow, were the flavors popping! And man, there was some real-deal spice heat working in some of the dishes. I&#39;ve never tasted some of these flavors before, which was a true treat, and like I say, I&#39;ve had a bunch of Indian food.
The deal is, you could order refills of anything that was on the tray, and as I couldn&#39;t ask for stuff by name, I pointed to a few (including the incendiary dal).
Awfully good, this feed was, and not expensive at all. An instant favorite!!
And it&#39;s part of a small chain--good to know when out of town.
By the time I left, the place was PACKED.
I think this place will be here for while. I sure hope so..."

hyderabad-house-biryani-place-aurora-2,Sanjay R.,UMQi2VV2ozx8Ncgqi6On1A,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,0,2,IK-jdY0we8vkvRvJFt_yCQ,2.0,2016-08-18,"My experience at Hyderabad House was largely unimpressive. We ordered 2 dosa night specials (unlimited dosas), 1 garlic naan, 1 samosa plate, and 1 butter paneer masala. Here&#39;s a breakdown of what each dish was like:

Dosa Night Special: While &#34;unlimited dosas&#34; may sound like a good deal at first, you&#39;re left feeling cheated when your first dosa is brought out to you. It is cold. It is flimsy. It is clearly made without proper love. I&#39;ve never seen a sadder looking dosa in my life. You might think you can liven up the poor dosa with some chutney (which by the way is mediocre at best) but you&#39;ll quickly find that the quantity of chutney provided to you is not nearly sufficient. Of course you may ask for more, but when the servers are nearly all occupied/inattentive it becomes a desperate struggle to resuscitate your close to lifeless dosa. You may decide that your first excuse for a dosa is an aberration, that surely your 2nd one will make up for the abysmal experience that was the 1st. But sure enough you&#39;ll find yourself disappointed yet again. Another cold, lifeless dosa that was probably left out to die in the harsh Chicago winter. 

Samosa Plate: When you first lay eyes on your 2 samosas, you&#39;ll notice that they appear out of place. While they look good themselves, they are presented to you on a sparse bed of shredded carrot and lettuce. Why put a hallmark Indian appetizer on an anorexic looking travesty of an American salad? It will be both an insult to you and an insult to the samosas. 

Garlic Naan: Brittle. Brittle. Brittle. You will question whether you&#39;re eating garlic naan or papadum. 

Butter Paneer Masala:  You&#39;ll find this to be the saving grace preventing a 1 star review of your own. While the other items were close to death, this is quite the opposite as it rode swiftly into battle for a sorely needed counterattack. The color alone is valiant and the flavor is warm and hearty. You&#39;ll experience a lofty aftertaste leaving you nostalgic for the first bite and in eager anticipation for the next. 

Service: Get ready to experience what it&#39;s like to live in a 3rd world country where the majority of the population doesn&#39;t have access to clean drinking water right in the heart of Naperville. Seriously, could this establishment not afford to pay the water bill? Not once will you be approached to have your glass refilled. Also forget about ice. You&#39;re not getting any. It&#39;s almost as if the staff is actively trying to dehydrate you as you force down their awful attempt at delivering you a respectable Indian cuisine. 

Take your money elsewhere, please."

Mirchi Bajji - Really good with balanced combination of spices &amp; Guntur style 
Karappodi Idli - Probably the best available idli in LAN, Karappodi is good but tasted like Mysore style . Thought of having Karivepaku ( curry leaves) &amp; tamarind combination podi. 
Cone Dosa- Crispy and tasty. 
Mysore Masala Dosa - Masala is good and it could have been little more crispy
Dum Biryani - Very well cooked with right amount of spices 
Black Forest Pastries - Tasty with balanced flavour and sweetness

Service is good and best use of tablet based technology. Even though the restaurant is 70% full , they made the delivery in a reasonable time . In fact the lady took the order knows the order in which the dishes would be ready and come out of the kitchen. Good job Keep it up"

Half our group got food the other half watched us eat. It was the worst. The lady barely spoke English or Hindi so communication was beyond terrible. Biryani was okay but chicken was to spicy to even touch. Half decent place to eat if you have time to waste waiting.

We also tried some South Chicken dish as appetizer called Kodipura..somethjng don&#39;t remember the name. It tasted like a mild breaded version of Chicken 65...strictly okay. I ordered hot and sour soup....it had like a hint of desi spices in it? I didnt like it. Service was so bad...there was a man standing behind the counter (where the water was) and he didn&#39;t even refill our glasses.He was lost in some deep thought.. day dreaming?

Though I didn&#39;t care for much of it some dishes were amazing. But the food is not what I&#39;m rating. Service here is horrible!! Nobody knows what they are doing. We came in I had to ask 3 different people for a high chair. The. We sat there for 20 minutes and finally I flagged someone down to take our order.  It took 45 minutes for someone to come out and apologize for the delay on our food that something was broken or stalling or something. It took over an hour to get out food. It did not come out at once. Everyone got their meal one at a time with like a 10 minute period between each one. My brother never even got him. He asked what happened to his food and they said they were sorry they never put it in. Said it will be a while. We just told them to cancel it. And we never got our drinks :( I wish they would have Givin us a discount or complimented a dish instead of offering a desert. On the positive side it they did apologize a lot and the owner or manager did come out and tell us they did just open and they were very busy. I hope they can get their service together make sure kitchen and staff know what they are doing instead of everyone running around confused.

None of that fried fast food garbage, oh no, this is open hearth grilled chicken. It is seasoned well, always juicy, and the sides are just mere compliments to how incredible the main course is. Imagine the best chicken you&#39;ve ever had, then forget all about it because this is better!

Now, I should mention some of the sides could use work, like the rice &amp; broccoli, but otherwise the meal is great. Remember, it&#39;s not a 5 star steak house, this is casual comfort food. You will leave full and satisfied. Give their ribs and pork chops a try too, but only AFTER you&#39;ve tried the chicken. I mean, hell, chicken is in the name. You don&#39;t go to Red Lobster to try their burgers!

If you&#39;re not too full, try one of the cookies from the front counter for desert. Soft and delicious.

So, I&#39;ve been contending with some serious meat cravings.  Shameful? Maybe. Weak? Probably. Remorseful? Not yet.

I stopped in tonight and ordered the 1/2 Chicken Meal with chicken soup and a baked potato for my sides (comes with 1 slice of Texas toast).  Total = less than $11. 

The good:

+ Nice, quick service: I was in and out in 5 minutes.

+ Good portion sizes! I&#39;m getting 2.5 meals out of this.

+ Nice crisp to much of the skin and juicy dark meat!

+ Every little detail was attended to: fork, knife, AND soup spoon. 2 packages of Saltines (the brand, no knockoffs here!). 2 containers of whipped butter. 1 generous packet of sour cream. Everything was foil-covered and fit nicely inside the takeout box. 


The &#34;meh&#34;:

- The chicken was obviously (re-) heated, and the breast meat was dry. I hate to say it, but a $5 roasted grocery store chicken has juicer breast meat.

- I was expecting it to be herbier. I swearrrr they had a distinctive herby rub/flavor before! The flavor was OK, but nothing that stood out. 


I&#39;d like to think that the dryness could be attributed to ordering after peak dining hours (i.e. 7:30 pm), so I&#39;ll have to give them another try. Y&#39;know, for wholly scientific reasons completely unrelated to chicken cravings.

Until next time, Brooster&#39;s."

I haven&#39;t had it in over 10 years.  I was so excited to be driving through Lombard looking for a place to eat and my husband was looking at yelp and mentioned there was a Broosters.  He had no idea what it was, but I got super excited.

We were on a time crunch, so I was a little concerned with how long it would take.  It was about 1 o&#39;clock on a Saturday and we walked in with no line.  We both ordered 2 piece chicken special.  One dark meat and one white meat.  We both got mashed potatoes as our side.  They have RC which also brought back great childhood memories.  Such a great deal for $5.99.  This is way cheaper and I would like to think healthier then fast food would have been.

We both hit the bathroom, which were very clean.  As soon as got out our food arrived.  Insanely fast!  The yellow gravy was everything I remembered it to be, rich and flavorful and totally different from other gravies you have had.  The mashed potatoes soft and smooth.  The chicken is very flavorful with the chargrilled flavor, juicy meat and crunchy skin.  We both inhaled our food, leaving very full and satisfied and without a time crunch at all.  I can&#39;t wait to go back on my next visit in Chicago, so many other things on the menu look great, just don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever be able to pass up the mashed potatoes, chicken and gravy."

Sides were good.  (rice &amp; broccoli, and mashed potatoes), Texas toast was the best side there. 

Reason for the 5 star is because I went back to the register to get 1 more piece of Texas garlic toast. (It was so good). The cashier gave it to me at no charge.

I have to admit, even if I had seen the Lombard location, I don&#39;t think I would have given it a try; its THAT inconspicuous. BUT, I&#39;m seriously happy I did.

Even if you had decided to walk into the joint, I don&#39;t think you&#39;d feel like it was going to produce some b-o-m-b chicken. Its appearance is THAT modest. BUT, the chicken is not.

I think the first thing you should do at Broosters is order the whole or half chicken...whatever you feel like you can put away. The flavor is absolutely amazing. Add that charbroiled essence to the mix to seal the deal. What we have in the end is an incredibly moist piece of chicken that hits the spot where it counts.

The mashed potato and coleslaw side dishes parallel that of KFC. Texas toast is included with  everything! **They have this salsa thats hidden in a white container that you MUST use...it changes everything!!**"

I love  baked beans these beans lacked flavor they tasted like someone just poured them out of a VANCAMP  can and added onions. Broosters please add some brown sugar, mustard ,green peppers onions  a little bit of sugar to your baked beans add  barbecue sauce and bake them for about an hour. The broccoli rice was tasteless but it tasted like broccoli and rice I guess that&#39;s what it should taste like. the ribs were completely flavorless, I smelled no char and no grill when it came to the ribs they tasted like they were boiled or baked in an oven and then thrown on a grill no flavor at all truly disappointed. The chicken had a little bit of flavor like it had been marinated but still no Char flavor and no grill flavor. I really don&#39;t see myself trying this place again, I always like to give a restaurant to try and then that is it but I&#39;m not sure so very disappointed this was a complete waste of $17.00 and I still have to go buy dinner :("

We just ate here about two weeks ago and dinner for 2 was about $14.00!! That&#39;s pretty amazing now a days.

They put some awesome marinade on the chicken and it came with some Texas toast and 2 side, we opted for the green beans and the mashed potatoes. I would just go for the chicken though, make your own sides at  home. 

They have ribs and steaks here too, never have tried either but one day I just might."

They do really tasty bird here and it&#39;s a nice change from the fried chicken chains. Plus it&#39;s better than the rotisserie chains. Whatever marinade they use is really flavorful (I think I taste lime &amp; cumin) and the grill really brings it out. Broosters chicken tastes more like home cookin&#39; than fast food.

The sides are &#39;meh&#39;. No better and no worse than you&#39;d get at the fast food chains, with the exceptions of the baked potato and the Texas toast. It&#39;s nice to be able to order a freshly baked potato. They&#39;ll offer you real butter and sour cream to put on it too. 
*** Update Oct. 2012.  They changed the Texas Toast to ... well ... toast. It&#39;s just &#39;meh&#39; now too. Sad. *** 

We&#39;ve also tried the pork chop and the steak and they are a good value, but nothing to get excited about.

Don&#39;t expect the consistency here that you get at a big fast food chain. Sometimes the chicken pieces you get will be really meaty and sometimes not. Sometimes the chicken will be perfectly charred and sometimes not. But the chicken will always be tasty and a good value. I wouldn&#39;t drive across Chicagoland to get this chicken, but I&#39;m sure glad Broosters is in the neighborhood.

The employees are usually friendly. Feels like you&#39;re visiting a neighborhood place."

But Brooster&#39;s ribs? De-li-cious.
The meat was tender, came right off the bone and was booming with rich flavor. 

We went for Father&#39;s Day and ordered a family combo consisting of a whole chicken, a slab of ribs, mashed potatoes, broccoli rice and Texas toast.  The chicken, ribs and toast = filling and yummy!  However, the mashed potatoes and broccoli rice were bland.

Been eating here since I was young and the food&#39;s still the same sort of tasty. Fantastic place to eat chicken, a little on the dry side but the best sort of chicken is usually just that with a little bit of added whallop and it doesn&#39;t disappoint. 

However their hidden greatness has to be their  better than homecooked steaks. Always grilled to perfection with just the right amount of juice, it&#39;s plump, juicy and just plain old good steak. Their side dishes are what you&#39;d expect, though their chicken soup is better than average. 

Is it the best food I&#39;ve ever tasted? No. But for the prices that they sell their food at, Broosters  is one hell of a bang for your buck."

It is so good. 

My boyfriend works right next door to this place so he was the one to introduce it to me. Thank the Gods he did. (Okay, so that was a bit dramatic, but you get the point)
Broosters is the epitome of food done right. 

Their chicken is marinated in some sort of magical mix of seasonings, and grilled to perfection. You don&#39;t need any kind of sauce, any kind of extra spice, not even salt. It&#39;s cooked the way it was meant to be cooked.

Their steaks are also delicious. The steaks share the same qualities as the chicken in that it is cooked to feature the flavor of the meat, not overly seasoned or done up in any kind of fancy way. It&#39;s a perfectly cooked slab of meat, for meat&#39;s sake.

Another bonus? Their texas toast, and really, all of their side dishes. They are all simple and delicious. 

I love Broosters, and I would love to give them five stars, but the menu needs more variety."

I&#39;ve driven past the place numerous times. Usually always heading east so I never see the neon sign.

This time, thanks to Yelp we stopped in for dinner. It reminded me of a simplified BBQ restaurant without a lot of emphasis on the BBQ. Broosters doesn&#39;t do JUST chicken, but that seems to be what they do best. 

I wasn&#39;t sure of the portion size so I went with the 1/4 dark meat with a sides of mashed potatoes and green beans. 

The chicken was a little smaller than I expected. I have been doing a lot of grilling recently and the legs and thighs I have been buying at the store are a bit larger. However I realized the portions were rotisserie chicken sized and with the two sides and piece of texas toast there was plenty to eat. 

Overall, the chicken was very good. It was juicy and the seasoning added just enough flavor. It came without sauce, but there are two bottles of sauce at your table,. Use them if you want, but you won&#39;t need to. One is a BBQ sauce the other is a buffalo wing sauce. The BBQ sauce was okay, and the buffalo wing sauce had a nice kick that was slow starting but long lasting.

The sides were good. The mashed potatoes came with gravy and the green beans caught me off guard. They looked average, but were cooked in chicken broth with onions. That extra bit of  flavor definitely added bonus points in my book.

Speaking of bonus points, 10 points for having RC Cola.  

For the price of the meal I felt like I was getting a good deal. I know I will be back."

Unfortunately I was disappointed  My brother and I dropped in for lunch.  The food was alright but eminently forgettable.  I can barely remember what we ordered.  We got some combination platters with various sides so we could sample everything.  The pulled pork and chicken were both on the bland side.  The cole slaw and beans tasted like fast food (i.e. come out of a gallon container).  The one bright spot for me was the Texas Toast.  

In the end, it seems like it may be a lunch spot for the corporate-types working in the area.  Maybe I was expecting too much but it was too fast food-y for what I was looking for.  The food is perfectly acceptable, but I would not make a special trip for it.  

I also saw a sign for all-you-can-eat on the weekends.  I can&#39;t speak to that but maybe it&#39;s better?"

Lost a star for the ribs and steak - stick with the chicken.

The chicken is juicy, flavorful, and reasonable!  The garlic bread is a great side item - ask them to toast it on both sides, though.

My favorite item from Broosters is the green beans.  They are so yummy!

Also, they often have specials or coupon in those random coupon mailers that come every few weeks.

We are certainly glad we found this place.  We almost didn&#39;t... My brother was visiting one day and wanted three things: a quick bite, a lottery ticket, and a nap.  So, he ran out and grabbed some Broosters and a ticket from 7-11... a one stop shop.  Thank goodness he stopped, cuz we would never have gone in there.  It had already been years of driving past.

The grilled chicken, not as big of a hit, but my picky son ate it, so it must have been good!  They were especially thrilled about the texas toast that came with the meal. 
We ordered the ribs and chicken combo, my hubs got a salad and mashed, and I got coleslaw and a baked potato.  The baked potato was good, the coleslaw waaaaay too full of mayo, but not bad-tasting.  The chicken was fantastic, I would recommend getting that--it was great!  Awesome flavor!  The ribs........not so much.  They were some of the driest hardest ribs I have gotten in a long time.

After calling around, reviewing the menus and guidelines, for each restaurant, we decided to book the shower at Wheatstack. 

I had never organized a shower other than at my home so I had a lot of questions! Todd Shamberg, GM &amp; Event Planner, took the time to explain how everything would work and was flexible with the arrangements and accommodations. He was easy to contact by phone and email and never seemed bothered by my questions! 

The day of the event the room was set-up and ready when we arrived to decorate. Everyone was very attentive and willing to help us. Our server, Dina, was exceptional! She was quick, thought of things we would need before I had to ask and very accommodating and attentive to all our guests. Becky was the manager that day and she was also awesome! She kept checking in to see if we needed anything and how things were going. I felt that these two ladies really cared about our event! There was a good variety of food and all our guests commented on how good it was! Our daughter and son-in-law said &#34;everything was perfect!&#34; What more could I ask for?!? :)

I think the only thing I would have changed would be to have the room dividers up, separating our party from the rest of the dining room. I knew when I booked, because of the number of guests we would have, that it would be a &#34;semi-private room.&#34; For most of the day we were the only ones in the dining room but later in the afternoon people started coming in for lunch/dinner. 

Overall it was a great venue and I would highly recommend booking your event at Wheatstack! 

Thank you for all your help!"

Perfect for Good Friday, but I understand the fish fry is a regular Friday special...and all you can eat.  Looking around the dining room, it seems this is a popular deal as almost everyone was enjoying the fish. This was my first time eating in the dining room.  It&#39;s lackluster in looks and didn&#39;t look clean to me which turned me off. I will eat in the bar area as I did on my previous visit  as I didn&#39;t get that feeling dining in there. The fish fry comes with cole slaw, a side of fries or homemade potato chips and either a salad or soup. I opted for the cream of broccoli soup which was very good. The fish is battered cod and it was flaky and had a good batter. There were three pieces on my plate.  The first one was not greasy at all, but the next two were very greasy. That did not deter me from finishing all three pieces as it was very good....they just need to make sure the fish is put on paper towels to soak up the grease before serving. The tartar sauce was good with a little vinegar taste. The cole slaw was a minuscule portion and nothing special. The manager came by to check on our table which was nice. Our server was Cheryl and we loved her. She was friendly, sweet and very attentive. I would recommend the fish fry and do want to come back with my husband because I think he would enjoy it. Next time, though, I hope it&#39;s less greasy....and I&#39;ll be dining in the bar area. Less heebie jeevies there."

This is a great place to go to relax, eat some good food and just enjoy yourself. The atmosphere is perfect to wear whatever makes you comfortable - whether that&#39;s a nice dress or jeans and a sweater. There&#39;s a great bar area and restaurant area, and I can&#39;t wait to try out the patio when the weather gets warmer!

The food is really good and at a great price. You can&#39;t go wrong with the prime rib, fish and chips or $5 burger on a Monday.

Our waitress was attentive and offered us refills on drinks and fish before we asked. And asked again after we&#39;d already had more fish. The dressings for the salad were made there and yum.

We have a lot of office &#34;farewell&#34; or &#34;new employee&#34; lunches here, I guess because they have a lot of space and take reservations. The food is nothing exciting and the service is terribly slow. They advertise that they have gluten free items, but when one person in our party was aking about options the server told her &#34;anything white has gluten, right?&#34; and then told her that some items that don&#39;t have gluten (rice) did have it, and items that do have gluten, don&#39;t. I ordered the &#34;fresh garden pasta&#34; and I don&#39;t know what goes on in that garden but it was extremely oily. 

The outside patio is nice, though last time I was out there, they were having a bit of a wasp problem. I know nature happens and is difficult to control, but it was pretty bad. The inside feels kind of scrungy. Their photos show while tablecloths, which I assume is for banquets because it&#39;s certainly not the norm, just old sticky wooden tables.

I saw some good reviews of Wheatstack here on Yelp so I thought we&#39;d give it a try. We were not disappointed!

We were running a bit late but when we arrived they greeted us and assured us it was not a problem at all. The entire experience was great - our server was so friendly and genuinely nice and the food was fantastic! The bruchetta was the best I have ever had and everyone enjoyed their meal. The flatiron steak and ribs were favorites at the table.

As we were being seated, I mentioned my daughter graduated. At the end of the meal, they brought her a cupcake and a card. It was totally unexpected and such a nice touch.

I ordered the potato soup to start, and it was thick and creamy and seasoned beautifully.  I usually find soups to be too salty, but not this one.  I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap with vegetables.  What I really enjoyed about the wrap was that the chicken was grilled, and it was served with lots of lettuce that had a delicious dressing on it...almost like a salad in a wrap.  Very tasty, and seemed healthy.  The vegetables were green beans and carrots.  They were drowning in butter, and way over-cooked.  That was the only part of my meal that I did not care for.

As for service, our waitress was fantastic.  She was also the bartender, and she was the only person working.  She had the bar area and the tables.  Granted, it wasn&#39;t busy, but she was very attentive and helpful."

Though I run hot, I couldn&#39;t imagine what she was feeling. Shortest baby shower EVER! We wanted to make sure the mama-to-be didn&#39;t overheat. We paid more attention to her than the staff did. SERIOUSLY? I even asked Wheatstack on her behalf if they&#39;d give her a price break on the bill. The answer a flat out NO.

They also have a decent selection of beers on tap and a nice selection of martinis to choose from.  I&#39;ve been here all hours of the day/night and I&#39;ve never had to wait long to be seated and be served.  Some of my favorites are the goat cheese salad and buffalo burger. 

It&#39;s nice to sit outside on the patio with a nice view of the golf course during the summer and sip their awesome sangria, and in the winter there is a fire place in both rooms which makes for great ambiance.

We came back tonight for dinner and it is 84 degrees in the dining room --- we asked the manger on duty why the air wasn&#39;t on and got the same response ---- they need the general manager here to turn on the air conditioning.

*The Juicy Details*
After seeing the brightly lit sign many times in passing along my travels, I finally made plans to check out Wheatstack last week. I brought along my Better Half (BH) to serve as both my dinner companion and as my specialist for all things spicy and beer. The restaurant is adjacent to the River Bend golf course. The exterior/interior of the building are visually appealing, with emphasis on pastoral colors (green, gold, brown) which complement the wheat theme and pair well with the golf club atmosphere. The interior layout offers both a pub section with a sports bar setup and a dining section with an open dining room containing a combination of booth and table seating. There is also outdoor seating on the back (West facing) deck. I would describe the atmosphere as a mid-range casual setting; jeans/khakis, t-shirts/polo shirts/blouses all mix well in this crowd. The lighting in the dining area is not very bright, but is compensated by several large windows which just weren&#39;t showing their full potential on this rainy evening. The dining area had Top 40 music playing softly in the background while on the bar side, the sounds of sports from the television rose above the din of bar chatter.

We arrived at approximately 7pm on a Wednesday. The hostess asked us whether we would prefer to be in the bar or dining area, and we opted for the latter. When we selected the one vacant booth which had not yet been reset from the last customers, the hostess promptly cleared and reset the table herself and we were seated that same minute in our desired spot. Within 5 minutes of being seated, our drink orders were placed - I ordered the red blend, while my BH selected a pre-prohibition beer on tap. Both were suitable choices based on our personal preferences. For dinner, we ordered a cup of the homemade chicken noodle soup, 10 chicken wings with the spicy thai sauce (capitalizing on the 49-cent wing special), an order of the (loaded) nachos w/ beef, and the buffalo burger. The soup arrived within 60 seconds of our order being placed and tasted newly made, as the menu purported. It was refreshingly simple yet satisfying with chunks of white meat chicken, carrots, celery and a unique spin on the traditional noodle - a thin (possibly angel hair) pasta. Next up were the wings. These wings were the highlight of the evening in terms of cuisine - meaty and juicy chicken perfectly glazed in a savory, sweet yet tangy sauce. The heat in the sauce was perfectly paired with the neutralizing creaminess of the homemade peppercorn ranch dip that accompanied it. I could continue gushing about the wings for several paragraphs but suffice it to say, I could make a worthwhile trip to Wheatstack for these wings alone.

At the point that we finished these delicious wings, we entered the one and only break in the service continuity of the evening - for about 8 minutes, we were left with nothing but our waters and each other to focus our attention on, which in the scheme of things is minuscule. In any event, that tiny blip in the flow of the evening was easily overcome by the otherwise outstanding attentiveness and pleasant demeanor of the servers, manager and staff. 

When the main course (burger and nachos platter) arrived, they were served hot. The burger was adorned with traditional produce toppings, sans sauce. Being a native New Yorker, I naturally tried ketchup first, but ended up requesting a side of the peppercorn ranch and applied that instead, to my taste buds&#39; delight. The burger was cooked to juicy perfection and the waitress&#39; medium rare recommendation was most certainly the right call. The nachos platter, fielded by my BH, were less noteworthy - though a generous portion of tricolor nachos with all the fixings, they did not possess the same wow factor as the burger, and paled in comparison to the wings that had stolen the show earlier in the evening. The vanilla bean cheesecake, on the other hand, turned out to be very creamy and rich, though not overly so, and definitely provided a nice finale to a satisfying dining experience.

*Bottom Line*
Wheatstack provides a great setting for a casual date night or social gathering. The separate bar and dining areas offers the ability to calibrate your experience either towards a more sports bar vibe or a more sit-down restaurant feel. Overall, Wheatstack delivers solid service and quality food at a reasonable price in a convenient location. My BH and I will definitely be back to explore the menu further, and to experience those wings again."

An hour later I ask the the hostess when will we be seated &amp; she said soon. Another 30 minutes later we are finally seated but not until I complained! You would think that after waiting 11/2 hours that we would get good seats, but they took us to the bar area with wall to wall people standing. They had the nerve to try &amp; seat us in the middle of a crowd! I complained  &amp; demanded to get better seats after waiting so long. After all that, the food was below average!

We attended the dueling pianos event this weekend and had a blast! Food and service were stellar and really enjoyed the entertainment of the dueling pianos. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5, is we were not made aware of the fee or ticket options. I called a few weeks early to make our reservation, but at no point told about the coat of the tickets. Not too big of a deal except we brought guests and hadn&#39;t given the heads up of extra cost."

Perhaps it is because the extent, up until now, of outdoor dining included a few lunches in the loop, accompanied by a bunch of homeless guys asking for food and change, and the wonderful smell of city bus exhaust.  So when my dining companions decided on outdoor seating here, I did an inward cringe.  Mistakenly so, since the patio here was absolutely charming.  I&#39;m no country-club type, but I must say that the view here was magnificent, overlooking lush and well kept greens, and a beautiful lake (or water trap, depending how you look at things.)  It was at the end of August that we went here for a late lunch, and there were umbrellas over the tables for shade, and just enough breeze to keep the bugs at bay.  So, if all outdoor dining could be like this, I&#39;m game! 

Our server on this day was not only wonderfully nice, she did a great job keeping up in drinks.  I always had a full glass of iced tea at the ready!  The food matched the service when it comes to excellence.  The 1/2 Reuben was just the right mix of meat, kraut, cheese, and 1,000 island as not to be too sloppy, nor too skimpy.  I really enjoyed the grilled marble rye it was served on.  I also had a cup of chicken soup which was homemade and delicious.  By far the best part of the meal was my red-skinned potato salad.  Something so simple, but yet delightfully delicious; quite possibly the best potato salad I have ever had.

Since this place is fairly close to home, I need to try it out more often.  I&#39;m looking forward to trying out their seasonal Friday night fish fry, to see what it&#39;s like to eat inside, since I already know they have the patio down pat!"

First of all, I thought this is the place we had Mother&#39;s Day brunch at 2 years ago, but the minute we walked in this morning I realized we were at a different place. 

I now realize that 2 years ago we were at Seven Bridges for their Mother&#39;s Day brunch.   At Seven Bridges 2 years ago, when we walked in, we were greeted by 2 smiling staff members who handed all the mother&#39;s a rose. That would have been a nice touch today at Wheatstack.   At Seven Bridges, the room where people dined was huge and very spread out and there were so many choices of food at different stations spread out through 2-3 rooms so you never had to wait in a line. However, today it felt very tight and cramped today at Wheatstack.

Our waitress never even said Happy Mother&#39;s Day nor did she appear too thrilled to be waiting on us or to be there this morning.   Perhaps if Wheatstack allowed their servers to earn their tip by good service instead of implementing an automatic unwritten/unspoken 18% service charge on the bill, their servers would try to work harder at earning the gratuity.  Instead, it appeared like they were treating the day like a cafeteria and our server clearly wanted to have no interaction. There was a blonde server with straight hair pulled back into a pony tail that seemed to be doing really well with her tables and talking/being friendly.  Unfortunately, we had almost not communication with our server.  She even scolded my mother for leaving her fork on her plate when she was trying to clear it.  God forbid she had to give her a clean, new fork.   

Today, there were 25 large tables at least in the room and you had to squeeze by people to get out of the room to get to the food room.  There was only a u-shaped row of tables put together for the food.  So you had to wait in a line for food every time.  The eggs benedict container was empty at it was only 10 minutes after the 9am seating and didn&#39;t appear it was known it was empty by staff.   

Now here is what irks me the most. Below is the description from Wheatstack&#39;s website about what is included in the price.  OK, they don&#39;t mention OJ is included (I realize that now.....but come on.....we were charged for 4 OJ&#39;s which were in small tumbler glasses for $2.50 each).   It is brunch.  I have NEVER been to a brunch where OJ and Mimosa&#39;s were not included.   We also ordered 3 mimosas which we found out were $5.00 each.  I see that is in the description below, but we didn&#39;t realize it until we got the bill.  On top of it, they added 18% gratuity (they called it a service charge).   

When we were at Seven Bridges 2 years ago, we had a dedicated waitress who was constantly refilling water, coffee, OJ, plates and checked on us.  Today at Wheatstack, our waitress was not very friendly and took our initial drink order and we didn&#39;t see her again for at least 30 minutes at our table.  We had to flag her down to get refills on drinks.  I asked for an OJ and she started to walk away without asking the others at my table if they would like anything.  My sister attempted to ask for a coffee 3 times before I finally practically yelled it as she was walking away.  So you can imagine my frustration for a $25 service charge being applied when I don&#39;t feel it was earned.   At Seven Bridges 2 years ago, we gave the gratuity we felt was deserved and we gladly gave our server $25 (and we only had 4 people then).

Our bill with their service charge plus 3 mimosas, 4 OJs, for 4 adults plus one child came to $162.   Had the food and service been good, I would be happy to have paid this amount.  Today was very disappointing.  The food was just OK and the service was severely lacking.  Around 11am I could tell the wanted people to clear out.  It got really stuffy and hot in there which it was clear they had the A/C off and were trying to smoke the 9am seating out.  

Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere for brunches.   I would never attempt to dine at their restaurant after this experience.   Even the grounds/lawn at Seven Bridges are so much better kept.

The manager Todd was great to work with. He helped me stay within budget with some nice pairings. I was a bit disappointed that their dessert menu was so pricey. I had a great dinner with an appetizer and it ended on a dull note because all my budget could handle after that nice meal was assorted cookies.

My night manager or event director Kim was super!! I found I had to gentleman who needed glutend free meals and she was able to adjust their entrees without making them stand out or feel uncomfortable. The servers were great. Always on top of things and making sure that coffee came out right after dinner plates cleared, which was important.

Just a few things shorted them that last star. The ambient lighting was too dark even with the lights up all the way. We had a few speeches and we needed to move the person around until they were properly &#34;lit&#34; so everybody could see them. My final gripe is that they won&#39;t set up a direct bill. I work for a university and the events I through even though they have RSVP s I still have surprise guests and to through a $1500 dinner on my credit card, which I know I will be reimbursed in two weeks still is a strain on my financial state,  when the university could cut them a check by the end if the week if we were set up to direct bill.

What stinks is that, I love using intimate and neighborhood restaurants, but the more they shy away from direct billing the university won&#39;t let me and other event planned use great places like wheatstack! Then I&#39;m stuck with hotels and chain restaurants which doesn&#39;t boost our local vendors. I wish we could find some kind of halfwat point so we can still use them and they are equitably paid for their services.

Done with my musings....PS my sister ate in the main room and had the crab cakes and she said they were moist and oh so good. She also brought home a piece of their chocolate cake...it was divine. Too sweet for one person but just right for two to share. The frosting wasn&#39;t gooey and the cake had nice thin players that were light and airy. The cake itself wasn&#39;t sweet, which was nice, the creamy frosting brought the sweetness. Yummy!"

Ribs, burgers, fish all very good. Once, I had the lemon chicken with vegetables. Chicken was tender, but veggies...seems to always be green beans and carrots...and taste like they were seasoned with butter flavored oil that you use to make popcorn.  Not overcooked, but would rather have them plain than in this greasy oil. Outdoor patio is very nice, but facing west, so at dinner time the sun is in your eyes. We will continue to return. All staff very personable and attentive."

We even had our office Christmas parties here several times over the years. Maybe i just can&#39;t get it out of my mind that this is not the same place it used to be,  which was called The View.

That was then and this is now.   Now it&#39;s called The Wheatstack.   Last night&#39;s dinner experience scarred me for life. The cod fish was rubbery, cold and undercooked; the coleslaw was awful the service was bad - oops, make that horrendous -  wrong drinks were served, and the margaritas were were bitter.  My wife said the potato salad should be renamed the onion salad.  

One gets the impression that young school children were let loose in the kitchen, creating their Easy-Bake masterpieces for all to enjoy.

On the pro side it was close to home and this is a free country so I don&#39;t have to go back again. Trust me, I won&#39;t."

I have weird cravings sometimes, so what I ordered was admittedly bizarre, but all of it was great.  I got the chicken noodle soup (very chock full of meat and noodles and perfectly cooked veggies with still a bit of crunch).  Bonus points for two packs of oyster crackers on the side.  Then I got an order of fries.  So good!  Perfectly crispy, not oily, none were mushy!  For dessert I went with donut holes!  Why not?  The order is huge - it would easily feed four people.  Freshly done, perfectly puffy and not oily either!  Raspberry and chocolate sauce on the side and the holes have an expert dusting of cinnamon sugar on them.  I&#39;d haul out here again in a heartbeat!  And - the staff graciously put all of our orders on separate checks, which is very unusual (and a pain, I know)."

It is still working out the kinks, but it seemed like there was a better variety offered on the menu. The limited salad dressing selections was a dilemma for me.  
It is cozy and the fireplace is really great on a cold/cool night.

They are offering movie night on Mondays starting June 6, so I think they are trying to become more family friendly.

I&#39;d be willing to go back and try one of the specials and check to see if things are now working well."

I thought I&#39;d give their Friday fish fry a try. I was mislead to think they served perch for $10... it was nice juicy cod instead, I&#39;m not a fan of their fresh potato chips and you barely receive 2 tablespoons of their bland coleslaw in a little plastic cup, this was not what I had envisioned. Their tarter sauce was nothing special and $2.50 for one pop was a bummer. It would have been nice to see a server check on you for a refill, before it&#39;s time to leave.

Parking lot was packed near the building with golfers and the few spots marked for a 2 hour limit were full too. I have a hunch those premium spots are not monitored. The trek from the remote lot for dinner is a bitch. They need to shuttle you with a golf cart or at least valet.

Dining outside is always a plus but  I find service is often compromised. We were on a time line, we had decided on an early dinner with an early show. You&#39;ll be sitting out in the evening sun here, as the awning or umbrellas offer no help from the setting evening sun. Not what I had pictured and I&#39;ll probably avoid their other weekly offers."

Everyone&#39;s glass was always half full, the food was excellent, and we had a beautiful view of the golf course.  We enjoyed the chicken, mashed potatoes, and steamed vegetables.  The chicken was VERY SPECIAL! Great crust, deep garlic and citrus flavor, and very moist.  While we were there we all agreed that it would be a great location for a bridal shower, baby shower, or any luncheon for a large group.  The room that we were in comfortably sat 50+ people, had a fireplace, and the view would be even more impressive in the spring."

Everything about Wheatstack was unremarkable: the food, the service, and the view (which, from the banquet room off to the side was partially of a parking lot and then of the patio).  

We started off with bruschetta and stuffed button mushrooms.  Neither were bad, but both added nothing special.  There was no need to go up to the buffet for seconds.  They were just...ordinary.  The main course was lemon chicken, tilapia, and a plain, mixed salad with choice of 2 dressings.  Again, not one of these was offensive, but not one of thee was particularly good.  

I&#39;m not going to say the food was out of any box, as I&#39;m not in the kitchen, but if that is all their culinary team has to offer, it&#39;s probably more cost efficient to get frozen lemon chicken and stuffed mushrooms at Costco and warm up some chafing dishes at home.  

The staff, while not rude or inattentive, exuded very little effort and wasn&#39;t always around to order drinks from when needed.  

I would not go there for any reason, unless it was, like this, the chosen venue for a friend/family&#39;s special occasion, and then, I would eat before I arrived."

But the food was really a problem.  As was the service.  I was served an undercooked burger that was still cold to the touch.  I informed our waitress and her response was that she would tell the kitchen.  She left the burger on the table.  She didn&#39;t ask if I desired another or something else.  My date had a steak salad and her steak was over cooked.  So one under cooked item and one over cooked.  When we were finished eating our waitress asked if I wanted my under cooked burger wrapped to take home.

Perhaps our food experience was unusual.  But there is never an excuse for poor service.

It&#39;s not worth trying a second time."

There were a few tables full, a few people people at the bar and a few people sitting out on the patio. We took a table right by the patio. It offered a magnificent view of the adjacent golf course.

The service here was top notch. Our server was very friendly and made us feel like we were in her dining room at home. The manager took some time to chat with us also treating us more like friends and family than patrons. Just by them going out of their way went a long way with me!

I ordered something simple as I was only mildly hungry. I ordered a half chicken caesar wrap with a cup of soup. The chicken soup was very good and the wrap was also very good. It came on a wheat tortilla and was presented very attractively and filled with the right amount of stuff where it wasn&#39;t too skimpy or not falling apart.

To make a great meal  there are dozens of &#34;little things&#34; that need to taken care of with each table. Wheatstack carried each one out flawlessly!"

However, I just don&#39;t think Wheatstack will be it!

I went here for lunch once and got the Chicken Tender salad. It was great and huge. It better be for $14 dollars (which is ridiculous), I live in the city and can get the salad cheaper there! Anyways, I came here Friday with my family (party of 6) for the fish fry. We were told it would be a 25 minute wait. 50 minutes later...we were seated...ridiculous.

We were STARVING by the time we got seated. 2 people ordered the fish fry, 3 just ordered the perch dinner, and me (not being a huge fish fan, but it&#39;s Lent so no meat) decided to get the chicken finger salad but asked for just 2 pieces of fish on top. I was told this would be a $6 up-charge. Your kidding, right? You just made me wait 50 minutes for a table and now you want to charge me $20 for a salad? Of course, I asked to speak to a manager.

The manager (a man, can&#39;t remember his name) came over, explained why service was so slow and then said &#34;What can I do to make this right, you name it&#34; so then I asked for my salad with no up-charge. He said they would still have to charge me $2 extra dollars?! Why did you ask me what I wanted if you weren&#39;t going to give it to me? This is honestly the entire reason for the 2 star review. I hope the 2 dollars was worth it! He did end up comping our appetizers, but I was still annoyed.

The fish fry was the slowest fish fry I&#39;ve ever been to, my boyfriend had to ask for his beer 3 times, and the service was lackluster. They gave us a coupon to come back next time, but honestly, I will not return. 

If you want great reviews you need to have the customer service to go along with it."

We tried a couple of dishes. The pasta dish was bland and had this weak watery sauce that just collected at the bottom of the dish. Between the two of us, we probably finished a  quarter of it. I hate watery marinara-type sauces on pasta. The Portobello Mushroom sandwich was equally disappointing. It was also very bland and way too watery, but we split it and salted it up and was able to get it down. 

It&#39;ll be quite a while before I try this place again.

On another note, it was loud as can be inside, so we opted to sit outside viewing the golf course. It was quite lovely and quiet back there and it is a shame the food was bad because it would be nice to eat out there from time to time.

I thought my server was fantastic.

It is also quite expensive. Add $5-10 on top of what you&#39;d expect to pay elsewhere for most dishes."

The atmosphere is largely unchanged and is what you&#39;d expect for a restaurant on a golf course.  There&#39;s a bar area which was lively and had lots of tv&#39;s with sports, and then an attached dining room which had some holiday decorations and a nice roaring fire.  

We sat right down, which is always nice, and the service was friendly and attentive.  My friend and I shared a buffalo burger and a grilled veggie sandwich.  The buffalo burger was very good, served on a nice brioche type roll.  It&#39;s getting harder and harder to find buffalo burgers on menus so I was happy to see it offered.  The grilled veggie sandwich was also very good, it was served on ciabatta which held up nicely to the sloppiness of the veggies and garlic sauce.  

I would like to see them offer fries instead of chips (which were nothing special), and they could have done a better job with refilling the sodas (which were $2.50).  

I&#39;d also like to see them offer live music every weekend.  It looks like they have it once in a while, but in a place like that, it should be a regular part of the experience."

The View couldn&#39;t decide what it wanted to be, and Wheatstack is closer but not quite there.  It seems to be geared to American heartland type food - heavier food and beer (but who isn&#39;t focusing on that now?).   The menu changed more than I expected, but it would be nice to see a couple of staples (grilled chicken salad etc) and some real innovative standouts.   Even better would be to focus on local food.   

Service is better than The View - probably because the same manager who managed The View in its last couple of years is still there.  Decor has been mildly revamped and reflects more arts and crafts style.   We&#39;ll have to try this place in summer and see if the drunk golfers still dominate."

As for the food, I was happy with the steak sandwich I got.  It was tasty and done exactly how I asked for it.  There really is nothing more disappointing than having someone ask you how you want something cooked and then have them bring it to you the way the chef wanted it done.  But I digress.  Everyone was pretty happy with what they got.  Two people had burgers, two others went with the stuffed pork loin special.  All in all, a good visit.

Unfortunately, my 10 year old got one of these and took several bites before I noticed.  The tilapia was gray and flavorless, and the ribs were rated a &#34;5 out of 10&#34; by my father-in-law.  Our server was nice, but the service in general was slow.  Half our table&#39;s drink orders were brought out but it took another 10 minutes for the rest, even though it was just wine and soft drinks.

We could not have been more impressed with the friendly service, delicious food, and warm ambiance.  We all enjoyed dinner together on the evening of 12/28/11 where a waitress and trainee provided us with wonderful and attentive service.  We had the blackened tilapia and vodka penne pasta along with a couple of appetizers and everything was absolutely delicious with generous portions.  Although we enjoyed dinner at a leisurely pace, service was prompt and professional.  We genuinely felt welcomed throughout the evening - never rushed.  It is also a great place for families as we had a young child with us.  I hope this Groupon deal attracts many new customers to this establishment as they have certainly won us over.  We will definitely be back!!"

Tonight we based our decision on a coupon from the Clipper Magazine. We were immediately seated in a booth which was nice. I had a rough day and told the girl I was in need of a cocktail. She brought me one and it was great. My boyfriend and I commented that the menu had quite a bit of options we were interested in. We weren&#39;t sure what to order and decided on a wedge salad, 2 cups of soup (chowder and chili), nachos, and calamari (weird combo we realized, but it was what we wanted). We got the salad it was great. We didn&#39;t get the soup for about another 15 minutes, my boy friend asked for no onions and it was piled high with onions and my clam chowder was cold. We then proceeded to wait about 40 minutes for soggy nachos and extremely salty and cold calamari. During this time I got another martini and we barely saw our waitress. We then had to wave down another waitress to get our bill. I went to the car and luckily I did because when my bf gave the girl our coupon she proceeded to say within ear shot, &#34;They barely spent $50, ordered appetizers and have a coupon!&#34; I worked in many restaurants while in college all of them much nicer places than this and I would have never given such poor service and at the very least wouldn&#39;t have topped the evening off with utter rudeness. The only reason we went there was due to the coupon, this is the point of marketing with coupons, to draw new people into your establishment and then you treat your patrons with such poor service and disrespect. Never again, too many options in the Chicagoland area for this mess."

So it was good that I finally brought my parents with me so I could taste their (different) pies and try something new! Mom got the chicken and mushroom and Dad got the ham and cheese. While both were tasty, my heart still belongs to pepper steak!

We also got the mini dessert pies: mine, the vanilla custard liberally sprinkled with cinnamon, reminded me of horchata, the Mexican rice milk drink, yum! 

This is a unique and affordable dinner option for the whole family. Love it!"

These aren&#39;t dessert pies, these are more of what you would consider &#34;chicken pot pies&#34;.  They are small, and can be eaten individually, or you can buy a bunch of different flavors and share them.

Yes, they do have a chicken pie, but they also have varieties of beef, lamb, pork, and more.

I&#39;m bummed that I found this place just as I&#39;m in the process of relocating but how does that saying go...it&#39;s better to have love and lost then never to have loved at all.   And yes I absolutely LOVE the pot pies that are made here.

I agree with those who say....RUN...don&#39;t walk to Pie Boss immediately.   Get some pie then come back and read my review...LOL.

But seriously the whole process from my initial emails to Ty about the pies to picking up some frozen pot pies and a few tasty dessert pies was on point.   Ty was very nice when responding to my emails and when I called to place an order, the lady who answered the phone was equally pleasant.    Ty even helped me out when my good old GPS was directing me to the wrong destination.

When I went inside the shop, he was very patient explaining the whole pie process to another customer and her daughter.   In my mind I was like, hurry hurry, I&#39;m late for a Yelp event, but I couldn&#39;t be mad because I was witnessing some excellent customer service.    When he did get to me, he gave me that same courtesy and took the time to explain how I go about baking his pies.   I ordered the Pepper Steak, Chicken &amp; Mushroom, Spicy Chicken, and the Spinach &amp; Feta Pies.   I also ordered one each of his apple, vanilla, chocolate, and cherry pies.

I&#39;ve tried the Chicken &amp; Mushroom and Spicy Chicken so far.   The crust is so flaky...so tasty.    It&#39;s fine whether you add the egg and milk on top or leave it out.    The pot pie seems so tiny but it is packed full of goodness.   I can&#39;t say enough good things about the pies and Ty.

I ate all the dessert mini pies within a couple days and loved them all.  I will have to put a special order for a full dessert pie.

I promised to bring D the Pepper Steak pie to try but I hope I can hold out from eating it before I can get it to him.    Yum to the E.

P.S... I think Ty thought I was joking when I suggested he open a 2nd location in Northwest Indiana somewhere.    But he does offer shipping options for his pies if I&#39;m not inclined to drive the 80 minutes or so needed to get to Pie Boss once I move.   So hope is not lost."

This place came up on the who&#39;s who of restaurants in Aurora, IL and the Yelp reviews were amazing so I decided to give it a try. I must preface that I am not the biggest fan of pot pies but since people are raving about it, let&#39;s see what&#39;s it all about. When you walk in, it has a mom and pop shop feel to it. Since this restaurant is owned by a South African family, the colors of the restaurant are of the South African flag. When I called in my order, I told the young lady that this is my first time and I am not familiar with how the system of your restaurant works. She was more than helpful and willing to explain that you can either pick up your pot pies frozen or they can bake them in the house and pick them up a half-hour later. I decided to order the chicken pot pie and the pepper steak pot pie. Let me tell you they both were amazing for two completely different reasons: if you are looking for a homestyle meal, the chicken pot pie is the way to go. If you are looking for a savory meal, the pepper steak pot pie is the way to go. The crust was flaky, buttery, and extremely flavorful. This is the best pot pie I have ever eaten!

My first whiff left me with a &#34;Oh, WOW!&#34;, and I was looking forward to what lied ahead.  After talking with Ty (the owner) about the menu and what he recommended for a first timer, I went with the Beef Pasty and the Vanilla Custard dessert pie.  Simply AMAZING!  The Beef Pasty was a hand-held it that was like a beef stew wrapped in a pie crust.  The crust was buttery, flaky, and absolutely perfect!  The filling was scorching hot, so I do recommend waiting a bit before biting in, unless you like a burned tounge.  It was delicious though, and I highly recommend it.  The vanilla custard pie was perfect in its own right.  Creamy, a little eggy (which I like) and topped with a cinnamon (and nutmeg??) dusting.  The whole meal was A+!  Add to it Ty&#39;s service and this is a place I will DEFINITELY be back to, and soon!

For sure we will order again, to taste new flavors. They have around 20 different flavors, without including the pie desserts. We ordered cherry and chocolate!

I tried the chicken peri peri, chicken and shrooms, pepper steak, including the ham and cheese that my kids always order. Of all these our fave is the pepper steak which is like beef stew on a pie. Right amount of spice and saltiness to bring out the flavor of the flaky dough. I did try the custard and chocolate pies, they&#39;re just too small IMHO for the price. Be ready to spend maybe $20-30 to feed 4 hungry mouths. They close early so better call in your order before 7pm. Definitely our go to place for a quick grub.

After doing some searching on the interwebs I discovered this place. Let me tell you...this place is indeed a hidden gem. It looks very unassuming but it holds some delicious items.

I tried their steak pie and sausage roll. Both had an incredibly flaky crust. The steak was tender and swimming in a delicious gravy. The sausage roll was basically a flaky croissant with a yummy sausage stuffing. Both were so good I managed to chomp down on them within minutes. But I took my time eating the flaky crust. 

The staff were very friendly and they explained everything they made was in-house. It really tasted like it was. Very fresh. Like eating homemade pie. The whole place smelled like a bakery. I decided to even take home one of their custard pies for dessert. A bit small but very yummy. Like eating rice pudding pie. 

 My only complaint is its selection. Though varied and with different specialties made each week I would like to see some more options...like a pizza pie...or a gyro pie for example. Something a bit more extreme or experimental.

Overall this place was yummy and unique. A bit out of the way for me to drive but definitely worth it. If you ever feel like eating a tummy-warming meal then come to Pie Boss."

Loving Jamaican beef patties  (which I can&#39;t find in Naperville) I was drawn to check out Pie Boss since it&#39;s a stuffed pastry combination.  What a delight!  There are meat pies, vegetarian pies, sausage rolls, pasties and dessert pies.  The crust on all is a flaky well cooked puff pastry that is crispy top to bottom and melts in the mouth.  The fillings are very well seasoned, my favorite so far is the Pepper Steak.  On a recent trip the &#34;special&#34; was their homage to a pizza roll with pepperoni, and mozzarella cheese.  With the exception of the dessert pies portions are generous.  Other standouts are feta and spinach, spicy chicken and cheeseburger.

    From the gates, I was a little put off by the menu. I was being unfair. I had pegged the selection as being insufficient. Since its so seldom I make mistakes it&#39;s hard to remember what to do when you make one, but I suppose it&#39;s admit it. So, I admit it. While the selection is small, it isn&#39;t insufficient. They have styles for everyone&#39;s taste, from kids to spice loving adults and everything in between. We ran the while gamut with our order. 
    When I walked in, the smell grabbed me by the nostrils and led me around the counter area like the visible fog type scent hand we used to see on Tom &amp; Jerry. You know the one. I was greeted by a young women who informed me that my pies were still cooking and should be ready in two minutes. Meanwhile I see who I assume to be the owner in the back, busily rolling out a fresh batch of aromatic, flaky deliciousness. 
    I get my pies, a spinach feta for the wife, ham and cheese for the kiddies, cheeseburger just for fun, chicken perri Perri and sausage roll for myself. We carry them out as there are only two tables for eating in. I&#39;m confident they have future expansion on the horizon.
    I tasted all of the pies, each as delicious as the last. But the crowning jewel for me was undoubtedly the peri peri. According to the menu and the owner when I called, this was supposed to be very spicy. I eat ghost peppers on my ghost peppers so I&#39;m no stranger to spice. When I hear &#34; really spicy&#34; I figure it must be tame like a chipotle or some other variety of toddler teething pepper. This, though, really was quite spicy! I&#39;d compare it to the hear level somehow near a fresh jalapeno up toward the seed cluster. It was phenomenal! The taste, the texture...it was all there. The chicken was all white meat, tender and flaky as was the dough, all combined with a nice spicy curry type sauce. The sausage roll was also really good. Unlike any sausage I&#39;ve had before. This is not some Italian or polish rolled in a refrigerator biscuit. It&#39;s dense, savory, and fresh. 
   Please go. Do it for me. If you don&#39;t like it, I&#39;ll personally eat it for you. The people are very friendly, service is made to order, food is exceptional, prices are  almost too low, and you get the privilege of saying &#34; I&#39;ve eaten at pie boss&#34;"

I usually am not into pastries of this sort....I don&#39;t like pies in general. I have some fam from Michigan so they&#39;re all really into pasties but it&#39;s never been my thing. So much crust...ugh. 

Enter: Pie Boss.

Pie Boss does have a lot of crust but...it&#39;s just unlike any other I&#39;ve ever had. I don&#39;t mind all the dough and not only that but I think that may just be the best part of their goods. It&#39;s flaky in all the right places on the edges, soft &amp; gooey in all the rights places in the middle, just absolutely delicious. I tried a few different specimens to get a good scope and now am dying to go back to try more items.

+Sausage Roll $3.49 - This looked like a snack in my carry out box, but after I popped it in the oven, man did the sausage expand with some heat (har har har, too easy). Seriously though, it accounted for an entire lunch for me. It was so good.
+Chicken &amp; Mushroom meat pie $5.29 - Holy goodness. I swear I didn&#39;t think it could get better after trying the sausage roll but I was wrong. The chicken &amp; mushroom mixture was so insanely good, eloquent words are eluding me from describing the delight properly.
+Spinach &amp; Feta vegetarian pie $4.99 - This might have been my favorite of the bunch! It&#39;s really so hard to pick because I felt like each was better than the next. Thi s pie, along with the others, was completely packed full of spinach &amp; feta goodness. I absolutely loved it.

I *have* to get back to buy some pasties to go to see how they stack up for my fam vs. those from the UP. As everyone said, call 30-35 minutes before going in so they can prepare your pies to eat there. I prefer taking mine frozen. Trust me, they taste just as amazing if you heat them up at home. It&#39;s super easy &amp; makes for a filling, delicious meal! I live nowhere near Aurora but I&#39;m already planning my next trip to Pie Boss in my head! Nomnomnomz."

I&#39;ve only been here once, but the flaky crust/pie is very well prepared.  It looks perfect, I&#39;m not sure how the owner Ty (from the bakery&#39;s website) makes it that way.  Anyway, it was 10am and the pies were just getting out of the oven.  I ordered the Chicken and Mushroom Pie and a Sausage Roll.  I was thinking of eating it later in the day, but it was freshly prepared so I ate some of it right away instead.
      The prices are low and the food is good IMO.  I&#39;d recommend this place to people. Although it&#39;s more like a bakery than a restaurant, there are a few tables.  Oh and I had a chance to ask Ty about the food and he was super nice!"

Maybe a little too much for one person, but not enuf to split without a salad or something else to share. Around $7, fair enuf.

Nice mild, maybe curry/white pepper, spice on the spicy lamb that was not on the take away menu I requested; so you may have to ask for spicy lamb as I don&#39;t think they always have it. I shared half of the spicy lamb with my older brother who I was visiting in the Fox Valley and he didn&#39;t find it too spicy, and he doesn&#39;t like spicy. I was a little disappointed in the low spice level. I&#39;m also a crust snob and not looking for carbs in general, and I ate ALL my crust.

I did pick up a frozen chicken and mushroom pie and baked it about two weeks later just coating the top with milk (powdered goat milk was all I had and it worked) since I was out of the other egg wash option (why waste an egg). Came out nice and brown and flakey. I preferred the chicken and mushroom, rich, complex, just delicious. I found the spicy lamb not that special frankly and may have just gotten a less than stellar one, light on lamb imo.
I&#39;ll try the highly recommended pepper beef next, but I&#39;ll pick up another frozen chicken and mushroom guaranteed.

If you don&#39;t know this part of Aurora, you might want to call first and get some landmarks like Copley Memorial Hospital, and across from a 7-11 in a pretty nondescript strip mall. My garmin kept taking me to a wrong address a few long blocks away on Montgomery road, so watch out for that.
Nice people. I hope they do well. Kind of out of the way from my usual Fox Valley Aurora to Elgin run, in extreme SE Aurora (Montgomery :~)

Don&#39;t miss Johnny and Sarah&#39;s excellent reviews."

If you are looking for something unique and delicious, check out Pie Boss.  Even if you don&#39;t live in the area, it is worth taking a trip to!  I have been coming here for a couple years and have never been disappointed.  This is a locally run business, and the owners/employees are wonderful and genuinely nice people.  The restaurant is always clean and well maintained.  You can eat in the small dining area or take your pies to go. 

I have enjoyed every single pie that I have tried here.  They have a unique array of spices and flavors.  My favorites are the beef pepper steak, chicken and mushroom, and spinach and feta.  Sometimes the owners have limited time new flavors or specials.  The dessert pies, pasties, and rolls are fantastic too.  The pies are a bit heavy, so make sure you come in with an empty stomach.  If you have a specific flavor in mind, you may want to call ahead so they can make sure it&#39;s in stock and prepared for you.  Additionally, you can order frozen pies to take home and bake yourself.  Unfortunately, if you are gluten free or vegan, I don&#39;t think you will be able to find anything to eat here.  I think the reason though is because the owners want to keep the pies as authentic and tasty as possible."

I feel bad that I haven&#39;t come more often or that I haven&#39;t yet written a review, but now I can begin to correct those mistakes.  Located near Copley Memorial Hospital, it&#39;s located in strip mall at the corner of Waterford and Montgomery Road, and well worth finding--as you&#39;ll find nothing else like this anywhere near.  I&#39;m not at all familiar with South African food, and don&#39;t come from any pie/pastry-and-meat-eating culture, so I can&#39;t tell you how &#39;authentic&#39; or &#39;traditional&#39; anything here is; all I can tell you is that I find their offerings to be delicious and very filling.  

They have a standard menu (chicken pot pie, chicken and mushroom, something with beef, something with ground beef and cheese, spinach and feta), plus &#39;daily special&#39; type things; they also have a sausage thing and something called a &#39;pasty&#39; (which is pronounced like &#39;nasty&#39; not &#39;tasty&#39;).  I don&#39;t really like beef or sausages, so my experience here is limited to veggie pies and chicken; I did try their beef-and-something pie once and I thought it was weird-tasting and gamey, but it really could have just been me.  First I have to mention--as others have more thoroughly and eloquently mentioned--that the crust is freakin awesome; it&#39;s tasty, flaky, and just the right amount of chewy.

My favorites are the chicken pot pie, the spicy chicken, and the spinach and feta.  The pies with chicken are both incredibly flavorful, and the chicken isn&#39;t all sad and dried out; the chicken pot pie has a tasty gravy with peas and carrots, and, best of all, you can actually taste everything, it doesn&#39;t all just blend together; the spicy chicken isn&#39;t actually all that spicy--to me anyway--which is probably best because you can still taste the warm spices and appreciate the great flavors; the spinach and feta is also really good--it&#39;s not drenched in salt which means you can really appreciate the mild taste of spinach.  My only complaint about the spinach and feta, and actually it isn&#39;t really a complaint so much as a statement of my own personal preference, is that I wish it had a little more feta; it&#39;s also worth noting that whatever feta it is that they use isn&#39;t as salty as feta can sometimes be.  I haven&#39;t yet tried their desert pies, but I can&#39;t imagine that they&#39;re anything but awesome.

I&#39;ve only ever gone/ordered from Pie Boss between 1:00 and 3:00, so I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s like during lunch or late afternoon/early evening, but every time I&#39;ve gone I&#39;ve just walked in and ordered from whatever pies they have at the time and I&#39;ve never felt like I had to settle for anything.  They do suggest ordering about 30 minutes before you&#39;d like to pick up your pies, so if you want something specific or are ordering at a busy time I would suggest doing that, but otherwise I would suggest just walking in and letting whoever is behind the counter walk you through.  I also have to mention the people behind the counter, who have been INCREDIBLY friendly and interactive; the last couple of times I&#39;ve gone they asked if I had ever been there before, which I think is a really nice touch: if you are a first-timer they really do take the time to talk to you and make you feel comfortable about ordering.  Oh, and one last thing I would like to mention about the pies: they don&#39;t look large, so you might think that they&#39;re going to leave you wanting, but trust me when I say that they&#39;re much more substantial and filling than they appear.

I probably would go with five stars just based off of the food and the service, but five stars is a no-brainer here to me especially when you consider that there isn&#39;t anything like this around.  With great food, great service, and a unique concept, I think Pie Boss is a place that people should make a point of trying.  Bookmark it if you haven&#39;t yet!"

It could just be because I&#39;m pregnant, but I could&#39;ve eaten a whole other one all on my own... so I&#39;m not sure if that means they&#39;re a little small to fill up on one or what. :)

We also split the mini dessert pies: the apple and the vanilla custard. I&#39;m not a custard person at all, but that was delicious too! Sprinkled in cinnamon... it was really hard to decide which I liked better.

Pies are about $5 each, so it&#39;s totally affordable for lunch or dinner.  The pies are &#34;personal&#34; size, but after one I was still a little bit hungry.

... are you on your way yet? ...
... ... .... well, what are you waiting for, ya big dummy? ... ... ...

Move over Pleasant House! There&#39;s a new, more affordable (and IMO, better) savory pie shop in town and in one visit they offer double the veggie variety that you&#39;ve offered in the last 2 years. 

I walked into an empty shop during what was damn near an apocalyptic storm and was both warmly and promptly greeted by owner and Chef Tyrell. My immediate question was regarding their veggie options, of which they have two different ones each day, a Spinach and Feta and also Spicy Vegetable mix that they had already sold out of, but I couldn&#39;t resist so I purchased a take and bake frozen spicy veggie and a spinach and feta. I knew I should stop there, but I&#39;m really into new and unique local businesses and I wanted to spread the word a bit more and support the cause. 

So I thought about how my mom is the most boring, eater ever and rarely strays from meat, potatoes and pasta. The most ethnic she gets when it comes to food  are pierogis and maybe egg rolls and fried rice. If I told her I was bringing home South African food she&#39;d probably make a cringe-y face and then I&#39;d get mad at her for being so lame and non-adventurous and exactly what everyone thinks of when they talk sh*t about suburban people. But I decided to get her a pie anyway because I know she&#39;ll love it if she doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s origins and just thinks it&#39;s a pot pie... which it pretty much is. I ordered her up the chicken and mushroom and also the spicy chicken with traditional South African spices for my Dad.

I can&#39;t speak for my parents as they had already eaten dinner by the time I&#39;d gotten home so they&#39;re making it a lunch-time thing for tomorrow, but my spinach and feta pie was superb. and I have to confess that I&#39;ve never been much of a pot pie fan, but this was moist and perfect and unlike the pot pies I&#39;ve had in the past. Me = hooked. After being rained on today while running errands, I needed some comfort food of epic proportions and my pie did just the trick. I gobbled it up, managed to stay awake for about an hour and a half more, and that set the stage for a good cat cuddle/single girl snuggle with a big ole fleece blanket on the couch. It might not be fall yet, but in my head I&#39;m already wearing my drawstring mens sweatpants and gettign ready to carve a out a solid groove on the sectional until spring. 

All my 4 savory pies came to a total of $22... affordable, savory and my new hot spot for autumn through winter eats. 

Insider tip: Call 35 minutes ahead with your order and they&#39;ll make your pie fresh. The ones I got were just from the warming case but they were all buttery and moist as a mutha, so I can&#39;t imagine how good a fresh one would be. Defo going to call in advance next time... or you can do an order of frozen pies... or you can go bulk (totally what I&#39;m doing next time) and order 6 pies for $28.99. That&#39;s a meal for 6, for under $30. 

... NOW, are you on your way? ..."

There is a heated case for already cooked pies, but there are plenty of frozen options to order from.  We came in on an afternoon and they were out of the spicy chicken.  The owners were surprised that so many people ordered them as well.  I got a mix of frozen pies to go including the cheeseburger pie, pepper steak, chicken and mushroom, along with a spicy veggie.  

The owner was really nice as he mentioned that it started from South African street food the he grew up on but they upgraded it with sirloin steak, ground beef for the cheeseburger, and using higher end ingredients for the flaky crust.  The price point is pretty reasonable as well.  Although the distance is pretty far, it&#39;s worth the trip if you go to the outlet mall or anywhere near there."

I typically work until around 6:00 most days, and they&#39;re open until 7:00... So it&#39;s sort of a rush to get over there before they close. The first time we went, we got there at around 6:30, and they didn&#39;t have any pies ready to go. Maybe my expectations are weird, but the places that serve these kind of pot pies in my experience aren&#39;t the kind of place you call ahead and order but instead just swing by and choose from the selection they have on hand that are ready to go. I guess this is the case with Pie Boss if you come around lunch, but it&#39;d seem dinner is a prime time to also have your pies ready to roll out without needing to call ahead.

Anyway, we came back the next day, phoned in 30 minutes ahead of time, and ended up getting a cheeseburger pie, a spinach and feta pie, and some kind of curried mushroom pie along with a sausage roll. First off, the crust on these things were just bananas. Flaky, perfect, pot pie crust that tastes incredible. The fillings though, we weren&#39;t so wild about. The mushroom one was my favorite, I didn&#39;t really dig the spinach and feta, and the cheeseburger one was just weird. I was expecting something closer to like, I don&#39;t know, Hamburger Helper Cheeseburger Macaroni instead instead of a legit burger patty, piece of American cheese, and ketchup. Really weird. The sausage roll was pretty good, but we really wanted to try their dessert pastries which I guess they only serve on weekends?

We&#39;ll totally go back, as I feel like there&#39;s lots of potential here with the incredible crust they&#39;re able to produce on these pies, we just really haven&#39;t found a filling we&#39;re crazy about yet. If nothing else, the people who work there are SUPER nice, and it&#39;s cool seeing such an odd business (apparently) doing well in a random Aurora strip mall. I say check it out, get a wide assortment of pies, and share them."

I finally decided to stop in and boy am I happy I did. I went in with the intention of just picking up a menu to look over but after chatting with the friendly and helpful staff I ended up walking out with 2 meat pies. I got the chicken peri peri and the cheeseburger meat pie. 
The chicken peri peri was very delicious and had a little bit of a kick to it, the cheeseburger pie was exactly how it sounds, a cheeseburger in a pie, both were very good and I&#39;ll definitely be going back."

In fact, I lived here nearly 20 years before even understanding what one was. I knew it was some type of English foldover thing, stuffed with meat but that was about the extent of it. Sure I knew what an empanada was, but to this day I&#39;m still not clear on the difference between the two things...if a difference exists. 

Then I met my mother-in-law and started taking trips to Michigan, where pasties are in plentiful supply. These are not the little sparkly cups that strippers wear over their nipples. These are the real deal. But...being a teenage boy, I was a bit more familiar with the former than the latter. And seeing as how they seem to be all over the place in Michigan. Well, let&#39;s just say Mom was amused at my lack of knowledge on the subject.

A lot.

Enough that she thought she&#39;d be funny and buy a pair of stripper pasties and wrap them up for a gag Christmas gift for me that year.

So funny, right? 

Yeah, not so much. Especially when you get a pair of tassels from your future mother-in-law. 

FAIL. EPIC FAIL.

But what doesn&#39;t fail in any way shape or form is the food at Pie Boss. This was a bit of a hike for us, but turned out being worth every mile put on the old SUV. There&#39;s no easy way to get to Aurora from Willow Springs. Trust me, I&#39;ve tried all of them. You just have to suck it up and deal with the fact that you&#39;re going to be in the car a lot longer than you want to be. 

So to reward ourselves for the long long car ride, we stuffed ourselves with flaky deliciousness upon arriving at Pie Boss. 

Cheeseburger Pie, Chicken &amp; Mushroom, a sausage roll and the aforementioned pasty were all on the menu. And like another reviewer stated, one item is definitely enough to satisfy a person. We were being gluttonous pigs, but the leftovers filled us up for the rest of the day, so that was good. 

Everything was surrounded by the most buttery delicious flaky crust you&#39;ve ever had. Perfectly golden brown, this is that fall food you know you&#39;ve been craving. And with colder days in our future, this will really fill you up. Grab some frozen ones to take home while you&#39;re there.

The fillings were all seasoned very well, and everything tasted very fresh and perfectly cooked. No frozen carrots &amp; peas like you find in a lot of pot pies. The sauces were rich and satisfying as well. 

The gentleman behind the counter mentioned that everything is prepared by hand; even the cheeseburger is grilled before being put into the pie. 

Five stars here, people. Make plans to try this because you will leave happy. I guarantee it."

We tried the chicken &amp; mushroom pie, the sausage roll, and the steak pasty, while we were there.  Each was terrific.  They were all loaded with well seasoned fillings which were moist and flavorful.  The owner told me that the meat in the sausage roll was 90% lean, which is amazing because it stayed so moist and flavorful.  All of the pies/pasties shared the same buttery flaky crust that is made on a daily basis!

The owner Ty was as nice as could be, and he explained all of the available pies that were ready to eat, as well as frozen pies to heat at home.  We bought 4 pies to take home!

This is essentially a take-out place that happens to have two small tables for people who can&#39;t wait until they get home to eat these flaky-crusted savory treats. There are one or two people baking and taking orders and rather than greeting customers they seem a little puzzled about why you are there.

The pies are baked fresh. The top crust puffs up in layers that melt in your mouth. Unless you visit when they have pies ready, be prepared to wait. You can also phone in orders ahead for pick-up. The day we visited they were out of spinach-feta and sausage rolls. We tried the chicken-mushroom -- good. The spicy vegetable was excellent and so was the pasty.

Super friendly service... and their pies are orgasim in your mouth delicious. 

Yesterday was my first time eating  food from here and guess what!!! It was so good that I&#39;m having my girlfriend pick up some more today so I can have more for dinner. So happy my gf lives about a mile from this place ....I live over 50 miles! Yaay for me. 

So yesterday we literally ordered almost everything on the menu. We also had some frozen so we can experience what it&#39;s like to bake at home. We got the spinach and feta as well as the samosa frozen. We baked both for dinner and they were so scrumptious ... The filling along with the buttery crust made for a heavenly marriage. No joke. 

We ordered the cheeseburger, mushroom and chicken pies, and the sausage roll fresh. My tummy is pleading  for more as I type this. You can&#39;t go wrong with either. Trust me. Please trust me. 

It&#39;s such good food and for the price why wouldn&#39;t you go? It&#39;s way more of a better option than any fast food drive thru establishment.  

Go try it. I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ll love it.. And if you don&#39;t, call me and I&#39;ll HAPPILY eat your pie. Mmmmm"

This place is amazing. 

Think more pot pie then desert pie.

I had a cheeseburger pie and was very impressed.  It was more like a meatloaf pot pie with cheese... Probably doesn&#39;t sound good but really is.

And, I had a sausage roll which could have been a meal all in itself.  It was so tasty that I am starting to salivate as I am writing this.

Then for desert I had a little Custard pie, which was to die for.

Awesome place.  Unlike anything else in the area.  Although, I should be watching my carbs but this place calls out to me at night while I am sleeping.

AFAIK, there&#39;s only one place around that recycles #6 styrofoam -- the Dart Container facility in North Aurora. I don&#39;t live nearby, so when we have enough styrofoam to take a trip over there, we usually like to look up somewhere that looks good for lunch. (45 minute - 1 hour drive, yo.)

I...just...where do I begin? The reviews made it seem like this place was completely up my street. I&#39;m happy enough when someone does good homemade pastries, but I&#39;m even happier when I get to try new foods that I haven&#39;t tried before. And who doesn&#39;t love a good savory pie? Also, SAUSAGE ROLLS. :9

I knew from Yelp that you could call and order ahead of time to get exactly what you want...but how could I know what I wanted without having previously been there? Instead, I decided to just stop in after dropping off my recycling, and trust whatever they had freshly baked in their case. 

One of the owners and chefs, Tyrell Naidoo, greeted me warmly and told me about their pies. He also told me that they have two new pies that aren&#39;t on their menu yet: spicy steak and spicy lamb. He explained that they&#39;re both in a South African curry that&#39;s very traditional to Durban, the city in South Africa from whence these two wonderful restauranteurs came. I asked which was his favorite, and he immediately told me the spicy lamb. I took his advice and had one of those and a sausage roll (hey, I was starving). 

The sausage roll is light, flaky, and flavorful. Very good. But that spicy lamb pie? That, my friend, is the stuff that dreams are made of. Delicious curry dreams. So much depth. Such tender chunks of lamb that almost melt in your mouth. The chef informed me that they use only leg of lamb in their pies, because the quality of the meat is so much nicer. He also told me that they make their own pastry, but I already knew that part. 

Once you taste one of their pies, you&#39;ll have no idea how you survived so long without trying one. You&#39;ll also never eat a terrible frozen pot pie from the grocery store again (at least, not without weeping and wondering why you didn&#39;t just go to Pie Boss and have something a million times better instead). They also sell their pies frozen, so you can bake them at home and have one fresh anytime. I brought home a chicken and mushroom pie, a steak pie, a sausage roll, and one of each of the dessert tarts (apple crumble and milk custard) to share with my SO, since we don&#39;t get over to Aurora very often. I&#39;ll update my review once we&#39;ve tried those. 

Oh, and the chef started telling me about how they sometimes offer bunny chow -- a Durban specialty consisting of that same delightful lamb curry that was in my pie, only served inside a homemade loaf of bread, like a bread bowl. They make their bread there, like everything else, because they weren&#39;t satisfied with anyone else&#39;s bread. If you follow them on Facebook, you can find out when they&#39;re offering bunny chow as a special. (I did ask why it&#39;s called &#34;bunny chow,&#34; since there&#39;s no way my two bunnies would ever touch lamb. The chef said he wasn&#39;t sure; it&#39;s just always been called that. I definitely want to try it, though!)

I do also want to try the veggie pies. But there are only so many pies I can fit in a day, Pie Boss. I&#39;ll be back. Oh yes, I&#39;ll be back. As I told the owners, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a good or bad thing that I don&#39;t live closer. I&#39;m going to say it&#39;s a good thing, since I&#39;d probably eat far too many pies if I did live closer. :O They may be individually sized, but there is still such a thing as too much pie, lol."

My only complaint is that the pies weren&#39;t as large as I was hoping. Then again, I basically inhaled mine for lunch so if I slowed down and ate it like a normal person, I would have been okay. I can be somewhat of a snob with pie crusts but Pie Boss&#39; is tasty with good texture, despite just sitting under a heat lamp for a while, which makes me wonder how much more delicious it would have been if I gotten it baked fresh.

I took my pepper steak pie to my car dealership and ate it in the waiting area while my car got some work done. Everyone else present was made jealous. It was so obvious."

Good thing someone suggested we try it recently, or it might have stayed forgotten. Four of us descended on Pie Boss for a Saturday lunch, and we tried...I think most things on the menu. The pies all have an amazing flaky crust, just outstanding, and they&#39;re pretty well filled with all sort of stuff. I think the only things we didn&#39;t have were the cheeseburger (which I say sounds good) and the beef pastie.

Particular highlights are the spicy vegetable and the chicken and mushroom. The spicy chicken is also good - I think if they combined the spicy chicken and spicy vegetable, that would be the only thing I&#39;d ever order. When they say spicy, what they mean is a sort of traditional Indian flavored curry, and it&#39;s delicious. My pepper steak was good as well, with lots of good black pepper flavor. Their dessert - apple crumble and custard pies - are good, but not really remarkable. I would say I could probably eat...about one and a half pies? Maybe one and a third? So one might leave you a bit hungry, depending, but I think two would leave you stuffed.

Of note, unless they have them baked, you can wait 20-30 minutes for a pie to be cooked. I would say it&#39;s worth it, but if not, they look to keep a small stock of things warm for immediate service. But, in another twist I hadn&#39;t thought of, you can also take away frozen pies, which is kind of cool. Might be a good thing to keep in the freezer. I need to keep this on my list as a good change from the normal stuff."

When we found out about this place, we got really excited. My grandma, who is from the UP, thought maybe we won&#39;t have to make pasties anymore.

Wrong.

The steak pasty was unlike any other pasty I had ever met the acquaintance of. Peas, corn, gravy - especially inside the crust? All cardinal sins of pasty making.

We also had a cheeseburger pie, and we were all very confused at the fact that the slice of what appeared to be Kraft American cheese had not melted, despite being warm. It&#39;s an anomaly. 

I&#39;m giving two stars for the crust alone. It&#39;s usually the hardest thing to perfect, and yet it&#39;s the only thing this place got right."

So, anyway, they serve &#34;POT&#34; Pie (I guess you couldn&#39;t add the &#34;pot&#34; to the name, people might confuse us with Colorado). More so, they serve really good Pot pie! I got an off menu pie with lamb and it had great intense flavor! 

They have some other things too, but I&#39;m not sure why you would get something other than Pie. 

They had some ready when I walked in, but I hear its good to phone in your order 30min b4. 

Staff (all 1 of them) were cool and happy to talk you through the menu.

Oh, one more thing.... This place is cheap for the amount of food you get, 5ish for just about everything on the menu!!! Sweet(er...Savory)!!!!!!"

But hen you see these, they&#39;ll bring back Happy Memories. These pies are larger, but back when we were growing up SWANSON looked big. 

That said a good friend of mine told me to try this place. I bought two Chicken &amp; Mushroom, a Spinach with Feta. These were AWESOME. ate for dinner when I got home. t the last minute I bought a Sausage Roll, this I ate on the way home. I was told they make there own sausage, now most of us know, it can be spicy and greasy. The sausage was perfect favor, for me it could have used a little ketchup. But other than that it was very good.

Can&#39;t wait to try the Pepper Steak Pot Pie as I hear it&#39;s there best seller.
I think this place is a perfect place to stop and get dinner as a Surprise for your love ones at home."

I&#39;ve got 10 more frozen pies in my freezer (6 spinach and feta, 3 beef pasty, 1 sausage), waiting to be liberated from their chilly slumber, and tossed down the family gullet. (That didn&#39;t come out quite right, but whatever.)  So yeah, instead of a side of beef in my freezer, I&#39;ve got South African hand pies. Because that&#39;s how we roll in Des Plaines - &#34;City of Destiny.&#34;

So go eat your&#39;s fresh out of the display case. There&#39;s not a lot of ambiance in the dining area, so your car will also do nicely. Unless you really love large maps of the world and enjoy talking to people from other countries (which I do).  

My favorite way to eat the pies is tucked into a napkin by hand. They are not like those weak mostly liquidy pot pies you&#39;re used to. So don&#39;t be afraid of them pouring out all over your lap. These are hearty dense pies built by a couple brothers, and suitable for a man&#39;s appetite (after doing hearty man-work, like logging or telephone pole tossing or polishing your rims). 

You&#39;ll want to eat two, maybe three (if your rims were particularly dirty). Your dainty lady-friend will claim she only wants to try 1/2 of one with a house salad. Try not to smirk and roll your eyes, because everyone knows they don&#39;t sell salads! Because, what&#39;s the point of a salad, when you can bake veggies into a savory pie? Buy her 2-3 varieties, so you get the extras. That&#39;s called tactical dining.  You&#39;re welcome.

If you&#39;re a lady who can relate to said tactical dining, hoorah! And please adjust above genders according to your personal predilections.

If you&#39;re a man and a huge fan of crisp vegetables, not cooked into pie form...just stop OK? Cause I don&#39;t want you reading this review anymore."

Follow their Facebook site for other unique options like the spicy lamb or bunny chow.  They only prepare those meals on special occasions.

There is a really weird looking sign of a chef in the window and I just assumed it was a bakery.  A friend told me that it was a South African place and the next opportunity I had I stopped in.

The place used to be a BBQ place and a Middle Eastern joint, and was pretty smokey and nasty inside.  Now it is all cleaned up and super bright and nice.  They took some of the big counters away and really opened it up.  I didn&#39;t know what to expect so I picked up a few of the ready made pies.  The owner said to call ahead 35 min and they will bake them fresh next time.

I had a cheeseburger pie.  I had to try it and it is literally a cheeseburger baked into a pie.  It was pretty good.  The crust was buttery and crispy. 

The next pie we tried was a spicy chicken.  This was pretty spicy.  The taste is pretty mild and the spice creeps up and lingers.  Really good.  

Then I got a sausage roll. It was a mild beef sausage inside of a pastry.  Like a giant pig in a blanket.

I love different places in the community.  I think this place was pretty cool.  The menu is short but I want to try the peppersteak one next.  I would stop by and check it out, but don&#39;t expect apple pies.  I think they need to put a flag in the window or explain what they do a lot better."

Oh, it was so fantastic. We called 30 minutes beforehand and the pies were ready maybe 3 minutes after we arrived. I tried both their veggie pies, the spinach feta and the spicy curry veg. I loved both, but the curry in particular was absolutely everything I could ever hope for. Amazingly flavorful curry that perfectly matched the obscenely buttery, flaky crust. It was addicting. I don&#39;t know if I could stop myself if a row of these pies was placed before me. My partner enjoyed his beef pasty and especially loved the sausage roll. We both enjoyed the little dessert pastries.

Very friendly service and easy to talk to on the phone. I always appreciate it when small shops like this post a nice clear menu on their website.

I just wish it wasn&#39;t so far away in this barren-looking strip mall next to a corn field. I feel like they would do better in downtown Naperville with traffic from the school and shoppers looking for something non-chain. Either way, I really, really, really hope they succeed.

Will be back soon. Bringing the whole fam with me next time!"

You absolutely have to come here for amazingly delicious homemade pies. I have tried almost all the pies on the menu, they are all so good! So far the pepper steak is my absolute favorite, it&#39;s very... And I mean VERY savory *drool*. The pasty they have is also really delicious! 

The food is very filling, I&#39;m a small person so one pie is more than enough to satisfy me. If you are a bigger person or just have a big appetite, a pie and a sausage roll or pasty should be enough to fill you up! Also, I always make sure to get their custard for desert for a little over $1! It&#39;s so creamy, milky, and lightly sweet. Yums!

I read a few reviews on here that complain about the price being too high. Honestly, the price is just right for a freshly made homemade savory pie that will make you come back again... And again. Seriously, I keep coming back. These pies will rock your socks!"

At least I have 1 reliable place that seems to have pretty decent staples...more importantly, for smoothies that they will DELIVER to you. If you&#39;re curious, the cup of smoothie is delivered in a small brown paper bag. Dunno what they do if you order more than one. If you do pick-up order, they&#39;ll make it when you arrive (unless you request otherwise, I assume). As you watch them make it, you can also be really confused &amp; surprised that the interior is actually really nice.

Food I&#39;ve tried so far:
One of their egg foo youngs: It&#39;s not bad. It&#39;s ordered for family members, so...yeah. It&#39;s not any different from any other places, really.
Orange chicken: It&#39;s actually slight hot/has &#34;heat&#34;, opposed to straight up sweetness. It&#39;s still too sweet for my tastes, though.
Sesame chicken: Would 100% order again always. The sauce stays on the bottom of the container, so definitely spoon some on top when getting your food.
Chicken &amp; Mango Fried Rice: Thumbs down. :( I was thinking it&#39;d be a typical brown soy-saucey fried rice with chicken &amp; mango. Nope. It&#39;s some sort of seasoned fried rice with chicken &amp; mango. The rice &amp; chicken are great, but the fresh ripe mango they use in it really has no place.
Veggie Lo Mein: Your standard lo mein. Their veggie lo mein has a LOT of mushrooms in it, not too much onions.
Crab rangoon: Wonderfully stuffed with the cream mixture and are delicious.

Delivery is also pretty quick. I order via Grubhub usually - always gets here in 20 mins flat. Maybe a full 30 minutes if I ordered during a peak time, like dinner or something."

They tried to first tell us it was traffic but we only live about 12 minutes away,  approx. 6.8 miles.
Apparently they are under new ownership and no one there speaks English. 
Food was cold..noodles were supposed to be crispy but was like spaghetti because they absorbed all the sauce.
We were very patient with them but they showed no sympathy for the fact they messed up.

BBQ pork fried rice : tasted great, my boyfriend needed a little more soy sauce but for me it was just right

Mongolian beef: best Mongolian we&#39;ve had from a Chinese place!!!! The vegetables tasted fresh not frozen the beef tasted fresh! My favorite so far, it also did have a little spice factor to it which we enjoyed!!!

General Taos chicken: also great! The sauce sits at the bottom so make sure to stir well! Had great flavor chicken tasted fresh!

Chicken with black bean sauce: my favorite !!!!!! Such fresh, crunchy vegetables!!!! And the sauce and chicken were amazing!!!

I&#39;m pleased to say, we&#39;ve finally found the next best in the area! I recommend the mango tapioca. 

Oh yea, their food is alright, too.

Just kidding! We had Mongolian chicken, which we ordered extra spicy, and it was perfect. Crab Rangoon was pretty bland, so I&#39;d skip that next time. Same with the barbecue pork. I think I was expecting Filipino style barbecue pork, so was obviously disappointed with the chewy red mess they served, but that&#39;s my fault for having my porks confused.

I said that I would need a refund as they were way outside the delivery time, I was very hungry and everything had to be microwaved. They offered a credit for the next visit and would not give me a refund. I called grub hub, who was very kind and said that they would give me a refund if the restaurant did not. The restaurant refused and grub hub kindly refunded me and gave me wonderful customer service. On to the food: the taro bubble tea tasted as it should. The chicken lo mein was flavorless. I had never had this low of quality at an Asian buffet. There was no seasoning, it was like eating plain spaghetti noodles with my chicken. The shrimp wonton soup base was in a separate container from the wontons. The base was intolerably salty. The wontons were all mushed together with two random thin noodles that didn&#39;t belong. There was almost no shrimp in them even though they cost more than other varieties of wontons. The cold boring food and customer service from the restaurant was a huge disappointment. I would have been even more upset if I had accepted the credit as I never want to eat food from here again. I have had so much Asian food and have never had anything so subpar."

I had 1 serving of my noodles and of course asked for the rest of it to be wrapped up (yay lunch tomorrow), they brought our food into the kitchen to wrap it up. Which I&#39;m not a huge fan of, but ok. When they brought it back out, most of it had disappeared. When I asked the waitress what happened to the rest of it, she said that was all that was left. I told her no, there was a lot left it wouldn&#39;t have fit in the tiny little box they gave me. She continued to argue and then walked away. Only time someone came back was to get our money.

I was in the area &amp; was looking for a good Chinese restaurant that was close so I pulled out my trusted Yelp App &amp; found this place.  This place was definitely a good find.  It is in a little strip mall next to a Subway.  The parking lot is a decent size but the parking right of front next to the door can be full at times.  

I was surprised when I walked inside at how big it was &amp; how many tables they had.  It was very spacious &amp; the tables were spaced about with lots of room.  I came around lunch time.  I ordered a Mongolian beef &amp; it came with fried rice &amp; a soup.  For my soup I had the choice of egg drop or hot &amp; sour.  I went with the hot &amp; sour &amp; it was very good.  Some places taste a little bit too sour but this place was more on the hot side which I liked a lot.  

After about ten minutes the Mongolian beef came out.  It was piping hot which was a big plus &amp; you could tell it was brought to the table promptly after it was finished cooking.  The portion was a good size &amp; the food was delicious.  The fried rice that came with the food was also very good.  

The service here was very good &amp; the people who were running the place were also very nice.  I decided to come here again &amp; the second experience was just as good.

Never heard of it and realized that it was very new, just about a week open when I went there on a Sunday afternoon. I&#39;d give this play 4 stars for the food which I&#39;ll explain later, but bumped it up to 5 because of our waitress.

Doesn&#39;t look like a traditional Chinese restaurant, but it&#39;s such a big open room, not sure what else they could do with it. For the food, we got dumplings, egg drop soup, Mongolian beef, and shrimp fried rice. Dumplings were alright, different style than other traditional places. The small egg drop soup is a great deal for the price. A small was big enough for 2 people. The Mongolian beef was pretty good and same with the shrimp friend rice. Made for a good leftover meal later on that day too.

Our waitress was really nice, and tea is free too. She even wondered if we didn&#39;t like the food since we had so much left over but really, we just don&#39;t eat a lot. So that&#39;s really nice on her part. Got some coupons for next time that she gave us too."

Once it was delivery, the second time was carry out. The day we ordered delivery we were told 30 min but it actually was delivered in 15. Only complaint was that the person taking the order did not speak english very well. My bf had to repeat the order and address many times until she got it right.  Well we ordered a beef and scallop dish and we got the dish we ordered minus the scallops. She placed the wrong order.  It wasnt a big deal since the dish was very good and had a nice spice  to it.  We also ordered beef fried rice that was very good and not greasy like others I&#39;ve tasted.  The best part of the meal was my melon soothie. It was delicious!  Sweet, refreshing and yummy! 
Second time we ordered carry out. I ordered beef lo mein and my bf got the chicken szechwan and he ordered it very spicy, very spicy it was.  He was extremely happy with it, the portion was huge and the price decent. My dish was good, I loved the noodles. We are very happy with this place. We will make this a regular spot for us."

We typically order from Lom Lings in Lombard or Jins and China Ho in Winfield, but China Chef is geographically closer so we figured let&#39;s give it a shot. We were very glad we did. From time of order to food bagged and ready to go was 11 minutes.  We ordered 3 basic, chinese restaurant staples: Mongolian Beef, Shrimp in Lobster Sauce and General Tso&#39;s Chicken.

Mongolian Beef: Flavorful with a bit of heat, nice sized portion and not drowning in gravy like other places treat this dish.

Shrimp in Lobster Sauce: First, I give them props for not skimping on the Shrimp and unlike the Mongolian Beef, they went heavy with this awesome egg, lobster and bean sauce which was very tasty. 

General Tso&#39;s Chicken: Where&#39;s the breading? A lot of places put a heavy batter on their chicken so the ratio of bread to chicken is 2:1.. NOT here.. They again served a good sized portion of lightly battered chicken and veggies for flavor. They didn&#39;t  over douse the chicken in sauce either. It was just the right amount.

My opinion, so far much better than all the surrounding Chinese take-out. This is a place you should try. Next time we&#39;ll try delivery and 4 new dishes..."

I love that I can get kiwi bubble tea delivered to my house and the sweet &amp; sour chicken is by far the best in the area. My roommate loves the fried tofu and pork fried rice though there is milk in some of the sauces (she&#39;s allergic) so if you&#39;re vegan you might want to tread carefully. That&#39;s not their fault though, lol, so not deducting any stars for that. Four stars because it&#39;s not the best Chinese delivery I&#39;ve ever had, but it&#39;s definitely the best in the area and I will continue to order from them."

I didn&#39;t see an online menu so I just ordered typical Chinese dishes.

Food: Sweet and Sour Chicken was lightly crispy on the outside, tender and surprisingly juicy inside. Typical Sweet and Sour sauce. 
The egg roll was more like a spring roll and lightly crispy on the outside, I think they come in vegetable only. Delicious!
Chicken Fried Rice was good not great.
Vegetable Chop Suey was also notable.

I will definitely be ordering from here again."

the reason for not giving them five stars is because of their prices. when compared to other chinese restaurants, the amount of the serving you get from here vs other places is typically the same, but china chefs prices are quite higher."

The house fried rice was full of meat and good flavor, however the shrimp had a slightly off taste. The Szechuan chicken and Mongolian beef were both loaded with veggies, which I like but others may prefer more meat. The meat that was there however was tasty and tender. Both dishes though could have been more spicy, so we will probably ask for extra spice next time. They also came with a decent size side of white rice. The taro smoothie was excellent! Service was quick and efficient, food was ready in less than 15 mins. Prices were good and we ordered the small portions which were more than adequate. If you want leftovers though maybe get the large size. It was very easy to order online, so no mixup in translation. Overall happy to find a good place for takeout Chinese!"

I used to live in Naperville and got their pizza probably once every two weeks ... it was great pizza, the staff was friendly and polite, and they had super fast and free delivery. 

A year ago, I moved an hour away and had not had Sarpino&#39;s since 

Two weeks ago, though, I moved back to Naperville, and last night we decided to get pizza, and the first place I thought of was Sarpino&#39;s!

We used their fancy online ordering -- and, as usual, the delivery was quick and the pizza was unbelievably good. So good, that I gave them a 5-star review THIS MORNING when I got their email survey regarding my service experience. And so unbelievably good, in fact, that my boyfriend said, &#34;let&#39;s get that pizza again, I think it was the best I&#39;ve ever had!&#34; when I asked him what he wanted to have for dinner tonight. 

So I did the same exact thing as last night, tonight at 6:36 PM I ordered the same pizza that we ordered last night. It was super easy to order, so I put my phone down after I got the confirmation email, turned on the Cubs game, and about an hour and 10 minutes later I realize -- it&#39;s been over an hour and I still don&#39;t have my pizza. 

So I open the confirmation email with all the details, and double-check that I&#39;m not an idiot and did actually put the order through, and there it was, 6:36 PM on July 28, 2016 -- my order, my address, everything is good to go. 

I then called Sarpino&#39;s, and a gentleman with an Indian accent (I think) gets on the phone and asks how he can help me. I say, &#34;I put an order in over an hour ago online and it hasn&#39;t arrived&#34;

&#34;Oh, was it for such and such pizza?&#34;
&#34;No, it was for this kind&#34;
&#34;Hold on ...&#34;

He puts the phone down (not on hold), and even though now I&#39;m hangry and am realizing something has gone horribly wrong and I&#39;m probably NOT going to get this pizza tonight, I decide to keep my cool. After almost four minutes, he picks up the phone ...

&#34;We don&#39;t have your order&#34;
&#34;Well, I placed the order online at 6:36 PM&#34;
&#34;No you ordered that yesterday&#34;
&#34;Yes, I know I ordered it yesterday ... But I did tonight as well, at 6:36 PM&#34;
&#34;No, that was last night. You order that last night&#34;
&#34;Yes, yes, I did.  And tonight. I ordered it again tonight&#34;
&#34;Well I don&#39;t have your order&#34;
&#34;Yes, I got that, but that&#39;s not my fault&#34;
And he says ... &#34;Well it&#39;s not my fault either. Do you want to order your pizza again, or not&#34;

Okay ... Here&#39;s where I lose it ... keep in mind, I thought this wonderful pizza was going to be in my stomach by this point, and it&#39;s now been confirmed that it&#39;s not ever coming to my house, and I also realize that after I lose it with this guy because he&#39;s being pretty unprofessional at this point, after I did everything I was supposed to do, the way I was supposed to do it, to order a pizza from his business, and give him my money as a customer, I was actually never going to be able to order from here ever again, without risking something happening to my pizza when it&#39;s made.

&#34;Sure, okay, I&#39;ll order again, but what kind of compensation am I going to get?&#34; (I know, I know)
He chuckles and says, &#34;For what, you didn&#39;t even pay for it yet?&#34;

Yes, yes, I know, I haven&#39;t paid yet, but it&#39;s now been almost an hour-and-a-half and I still don&#39;t have the food that I ordered from YOUR business using the system YOU chose to use to get more business. All I wanted was a few bucks off or a free pop. Or maybe even just an apology. I got none of the above. Oh well. 

Needless to say, sadly, this will be the last time I ever order from Sarpino&#39;s.  I will miss you terribly, and am so disappointed ... By the way, it&#39;s you, not me.  But ... You can make it right, I&#39;d give you a second chance if you just said you&#39;re sorry."

Honestly, you&#39;re going to have your ups and down with pizza places like this. One, it&#39;s a chain, it&#39;s to be expected. Two, their pizza is reasonably priced and they have free delivery, which of course is going to attract people. I&#39;ve ordered from this location about 3 times now, and I think they&#39;re A-Ok. I&#39;ve had much worse and I&#39;ve had better. 

I think what has been a saving grace for these guys is we&#39;ve had the same delivery driver 2 out of the 3 times. He&#39;s awesome and always careful with the pizza. The other delivery driver we had was also super thorough and called while he was on his way to make sure he had the correct address and directions. So, I think that&#39;s part of the reason why we&#39;ve had good experiences; delivery drivers are key. 

In regards to the pizza, yeah this location isn&#39;t as good with the amount of toppings as the North Aurora location. They&#39;re a little stingy, which is unfortunate. Otherwise, the pizza is always solid. It&#39;s exactly what I expect it to be every time. Fluffy crust, even cheese and toppings, and warm when we get it. 

I mean, their online system is super convenient, you can get 10% off when you order online which usually takes care of the tax, and it&#39;s free delivery. Who can argue with that? 

Solid three for these guys. I will be ordering again, because hey, it&#39;s convenient, decently cheap, and pretty solid quality."

The pizza that caught my eye was the Midnight Express, which contains spicy ground beef, salami, pepperoni, spicy Italian sausage, jalapeno and red chili peppers.  I love spicy and I love meat.  So there&#39;s no way this could be bad.

Their prices seem to be a bit higher than other pizza joints, but they don&#39;t charge delivery, so I suppose that&#39;s a fair trade off.  Aside from pizza, you can also select wings, salads, sandwiches, calzones, and desserts (much like any other pizza joint).  I did notice the abundance of sauces to choose from, which definitely sets them apart from the rest.  

Their online ordering system is impressive, as you can easily select your meats, toppings, your preference of how the pizza is cut (pie or square), cooking instructions, sauce application, dipping sauces, etc. It&#39;s almost overwhelming. Sarpino&#39;s covers all the bases when it comes to customers creating their perfect pizza. 

About twenty minutes after ordering, I received a friendly phone call from the driver stating that he was leaving and would be here shortly.  I found that to be a very nice gesture. He was at my door five minutes after that. I had my order from start to finished in 20 minutes flat. I was amazed and thrilled, because I hadn&#39;t eaten a thing ALL DAY.  I couldn&#39;t wait to devour this thing.

The pizza looked and smelled phenomenal. At first bite, I was pleasantly surprised. It was a bit greasy (due to the meats) but delicious.  Every ingredient was detected, including the spicy jalapenos and red chili peppers. It was enough to make my nose run slightly and burn my lips, so this pizza met my approval, without a doubt. The sauce was good- not at all sweet. I ordered thin crust which would work for a standard one-topping pizza, but for their gourmet or specialty pizzas, I would pick thick crust. 

All in all, I gotta say I&#39;m surprised by Sarpino&#39;s. Sure, there are some better pizza places out there, but I&#39;ve most certainly had worse. The delivery driver was super friendly, quick, and polite.  The food was better than I expected. Three stars for now until I try more items."

I&#39;ve called corporate before and guess I&#39;ll have to again but I&#39;m not sure it is even worth my time since I&#39;ll never eat at this hack pizza place again.

Sent my entire order back tonight. With the guy who came out for a second time with the wrong delivery for the second time. Just handed him the pizza, wings, non cheesy breadsticks and gas money and told sarpinos as a whole to kick dust."

We&#39;ve never waited longer than 35 min, even for the largest orders. The pizzas are always well-cooked, tidy, and appetizing. The ingredients always taste fresh. The crusts are always crispy on the outside and baked fluffy on the inside. Really no complaints!

I don&#39;t know who delivered my order tonight, but he&#39;s delivered to me several times and each time he&#39;s extremely dismissive and passive. He literally DANGLES the pen at me. He DANGLES the receipt at me. Tonight he delivered to me, and his typical rude deamenor and I was in the midst of putting my 75 pound dog in his crate when he knocked at my door. I said just a second. Not even TEN seconds after I said this- loud enough for him to hear me (the walls are thin) he knocked again. I opened the door after making sure my dog didn&#39;t tackle him for a hug and expressed that I was putting my dog away. Absolutely no response except for dangling the pen- at the furthest edge at me. And I signed. He then ripped off the receipt and dangled at me. I took it and he facetiously said for me to have a good night. This is my last time patronizing this business. Don&#39;t waste your money here."

Their hot wings are fantastic, and they offer discounts plus points/freebies for ordering online, which is a great feature. 

The bad? Calling in an order. They act like you&#39;re bothering them when you call in to place an order. My family and I have been Sarpino&#39;s customers since 2010, but you&#39;re almost crossing your fingers that they don&#39;t snap at you when you call to place an order. There are more options if you order online (you can choose free &#39;sauces&#39; per items), plus you won&#39;t have to deal with the front-end staff. The owner&#39;s wife &#34;blacklisted&#34; my address for delivery after criticizing them for putting me on hold and expressing frustration at their coldness towards &#34;not being able to accept credit/debit&#34; at the time. 

Recommendation: Order online, their hours and food quality is great. Stay away from management.

**This was my go-to place for late night delivery, and it&#39;s easily the best late night combo-pizza place in the Naperville area, but the kicker for me is how quick they are to blacklist anyone criticizing them over the phone. Once you&#39;re on the &#34;list&#34;, you&#39;re there for life...Be careful how you talk to the management, you might lose their unique, super late night delivery privileges, which truly sucks.

But was not at all impressed with the pizza. I had asked for a well done - which I didnt see my pizza to be. The cheese that I specified was ricotta and felt that the only cheese in the order was mozzarella. The pizza seems to be oily - not sure adding garlic butter to the pizza meant that you get only that on the pizza - plus it didnt even smell like garlic butter - felt like oil. The side sauce on the order looked like &#34;Jalapeno Ranch&#34; and what I got was marinara - which i sincerely hate.
The only two good things that I could say about the experience was that the pizza was hot when delivered and the variety you offered was good. Sadly for that amount I would have ended up getting an extra large from any competitive chain. 
There is merit in getting back to your customer to ask for changes required if you don&#39;t have the necessary ingredients rather than stuffing whatever you have on the pizza.
Thoroughly disappointed and not sure would try it again ever."

Pros: 
free delivery
Delivered reasonably quick
Calzones are amazing. I mean amazing.
Cheese bread is amazing
You acrew points with each purchase that after a while give you money off.

Cons: 
Delivery drivers are bad drivers and whip through my neighborhood recklessly
Pasta is not worth the money

SARPINOS was my go to pizza place whenever   I was too lazy and tired to cook a meal after work. Although the quality of service and food isn&#39;t always the best (or consistent) I still showed my loyalty and settled for the l&#34;decent&#34; food. I order from this place so often that I&#39;ve been able to collect 10 coupons 3 times to earn a free item.

However, after my last experience I have no intentions of spending a dollar on this place or refer anyone else. In fact, I plan on steering other consumers far from this establishment by sharing the multiple unacceptable experiences I&#39;ve had.  Not only are they liars and do not honor anything they say or print on brochures/coupons, they don&#39;t respect or appreciate loyal customers who continue to help keep them in business. 

I&#39;ve had the owner completely dismiss a coupon sent by his pizza shop  (with no expiration date, mind you) and tell me it was a misprint sent out in error and honoring it would leave him without a profit. My last experience they arrived 30 minutes late with a cold chicken parm sandwich, that was more like a bread and cheese sandwich with a smear of sauce and sprinkle of chicken bites, and when I answered the door the driver told me he didn&#39;t have my receipt. How convenient, considering that would have been my 10th one, allowing me to order a free item my next order. 

Few days later, I call to order a pizza and mention I should be at 10 receipts, and explained what happened only 3 days ago. I I was told they wouldn&#39;t  honor a free item without 10 receipts. I asked to speak to the manager to explain and let them know I could provide proof I made the purchase with my card, and the manager on duty (Victoria) wouldn&#39;t  entertain the thought for a second and kept saying no. 

For someone who orders ALL the time, I would have expected a little more from management. Especially considering it&#39;s YOUR staff who keep messing up and conveniently misplaces reciepts. This place creates the perception that they offer deals and reward programs but they will do whatever they can to scam you when they get the chance.......STAY AWAY!!!  Buy pizza from a place who appreciates your business."

Luckily, so far my experiences with Sarpino&#39;s have all been great, and I&#39;ve ordered for delivery from them about a half dozen times. 
So far, they&#39;ve always delivered in the time-frame given, my order has always been correct--and hot--and every person I&#39;ve spoken to or who has delivered my order has been polite and professional.  The prices are reasonable and it helps that there is no delivery charge.

I&#39;m not really much of a pizza guy, so I haven&#39;t even tasted their pizza, but I enjoy their calzones, and they have a really good salad with fresh green peppers, onion, mushrooms, spinach, cheese, grape/cherry tomatoes, and bacon that&#39;s pretty awesome with their creamy garlic dressing.  The calzones are actually really good, and although they may be a little greasy, it&#39;s not gonna be dripping off your chin or down your arms, but the bread is what makes it--it&#39;s flavorful and just the right amount.  

I would like to give this place five stars, but feel that I still need to try a few different things--including the pizza--and I also have a wish.  I wish that they would use a better quality cheese, or have the option of getting fresh mozzarella, and use more ingredients of the same quality that I consistently find in their salads.  The menu says something about a blend of gourmet cheese--and I don&#39;t know, maybe it is--but it still has that waxy-thing going on.  I realize that it may be more expensive and that there may be no demand for it, but I would be willing to pay more and maybe other people would be too.  Anyway, I&#39;m going to continue to order and if I find a good number of great options, I&#39;ll definitely update this review."

What is wrong with this guy? You mess with a bull, you&#39;re going to get the horns. In his little pm to me he totally contradicts himself! AND I HAVE IT ALL DOCUMENTED! What an idiot. FYI.

When I called, I was told by the manager that she&#39;ll give me a partial credit, although I asked to get the pizza I requested, not the one received. She did not want to comply.  I don&#39;t appreciate paying for a pizza I ended up throwing away because not only was it wrong, it was the worst pizza I&#39;ve ever tasted (and that says ALOT).   With the abundant number of pizza venues in the Chicagoland area, you&#39;d think they&#39;d want to hang on to the loyal customers they have.  I guess not.  
Due to this experience, I will NEVER order from them again and I warn those who are thinking about ordering, only do it if you want to waste money on wrong items, get poor customer service and be totally frustrated.  What a disappointment!"

I&#39;ll start off by saying I was a customer when the Naperville location opened, and have had Sarpinos deliver every time. But now, GREG, THE OWNER OF SARPINOS NAPERVILLE, has changed his boundaries, and I can no longer receive delivery. (I wonder if corporate allows their franchise owner to have control over their boundaries?)  Seriously, my home is less than 6 miles from the store!!
I left a message with the store manager to have Greg call me, but GREG NEVER CALLED ME BACK!  Sadly, I guess Greg is rollin in the dough (so to speak), and doesn&#39;t care if he loses customers.  &#39;Go out of your way to serve your customer...They are the reason your business survives!&#39; With all the negative reviews I see here, I don&#39;t believe Greg can afford to sacrifice even ONE customer."

... My most recent order included mozzarella sticks. They had been nuked to the point of ALL the cheese melting out of the crust and solidifying on the bottom of the tray. They arrived cold so it was a solid cheese platter. AND they cheated me on extra sauce I ordered... and not for the first time!!! I was so ticked, I called to demand a refund.

Always had good service and good food! Went to order Thursday afternoon (around 3:30) online and online ordering was not available so I called the store - was very disappointed when the young lady who answered told me they could not take orders because their computers were down. Although she was very apologetic, she could not tell me when I would be able to place an order. Are the ovens and other appliances ran by the computer system as well? What happened to writing an order down on a piece of paper and using a calculator to figure out a total???? That&#39;s how it was done back in the day (omg I&#39;m getting old). Obviously making money or servicing customers was not a priority that day because I bet it could have been done without the computer. They have the menu with prices and I&#39;m sure they have paper and pen - even if no calculator was available - they could have added the old fashioned way. It&#39;s a shame people are so dependent on computers they can&#39;t function without one. Very poor decision on the part of management. Being in management myself, my customers would not suffer due to a computer system not functioning. That is an internal issue - not the customers problem.

It&#39;s absolutely absurd how awful this has been and now we&#39;ll be lucky if the charges will get reversed for this. If you&#39;re looking for pizza, steer clear of this establishment.

It didn&#39;t help that I have been swamped by their menus at my apartment complex either. I had heard if you place an order online it&#39;s 10% off the order. So when the mood hit for some pizza, this was the logical place to go.

By going online, you can browse the specials. I was able to score a large 2 topping pizza, one pound of wings and an order of breadsticks for $18. Plus 10% off which just covered the tax (Damn you Illinois). Not bad considering Pizza Hut is around $30 for the same.  

I decided on delivery and within 20 minutes the order was at my door. I have to say the wings here are phenomenal. Not overcooked but just right. I ordered the mix of hot and BBQ. Both flavors were delicious and not overpowering or drenched in the sauce. This may have been the perfect chicken wing. Or at least the best I&#39;ve ever ordered from a pizza place.

Sarpino&#39;s offers a pretty solid pizza. There are better choices out here, but for the price it was good. The sauce tasted great, the crust was thicker than I prefer it and the mushrooms held up and didn&#39;t turn out burned. The one thing that was weird concerned the Italian sausage. Instead of globs of sausage balls, they have little sliced sausage on the pizza. It kinda left the pizza not having that &#34;meaty&#34; flavor. 

The breadsticks were forgettable. I see why they&#39;re thrown in as a freebie. They bake them like a pizza and cut them into strips. It left the sticks a little too chewy. 

One plus I will add is the dipping sauces included on everything. This is good because lately I decided pizza didn&#39;t have enough calories so I need my ranch dipping sauce to put it over the top. Hey when you splurge, you might as well go all out.

Certainly not the best or the worst, but Sarpino&#39;s offers a good pizza for the price. Plus on the weekends, they&#39;re open until 4 in the morning.  What&#39;s not to love about that?"

However they always do provide a coupon or had instances where I have gotten items for free for a time delay. Ordered many times various toppings always good. A little pricier than some places, but personally never had a problem with a coupon or anything. I would say to pick up instead of carry-out if you are hungry and in a time crunch.

We ordered a few things, because we were really hungry after a long flight. The pizza was actually very good. So were the wings and the bread we ordered.

Several times, the pizza has been delivered later than promised, and once, it was delivered free of charge due to it&#39;s delivery delay.  Yesterday it came 2 hours late, after being promised 45 minutes after my order was placed.  I called an hour in to waiting and complained, and was assured that they were &#34;just busy&#34; and that the driver had already left.  An hour and a half later, I still had no pizza.  When I called the second time, I was put on hold by the girl who took my order, and then again by another girl, only to talk to a manager who told me it was my error and that I said I would come to the facility to pick it up.  Upon pointing out to him that I had already talked to the original order-taker and she&#39;d assured me about the delivery, he claimed to give me 20% off, and that the pizza was on it&#39;s way.  

It finally arrived at the 2 hour mark, cold and soggy.  I apologized to the delivery person for not tipping him and told him to discuss it with his manager.  I paid the full price.

Unfortunately, my family likes their pizza - I fear we&#39;ll order from them again, and be faced with the same situation.  It&#39;s really unfortunate."

The sandwiches and other items are pretty good, but the pizza is never good. Either the cheese is burnt or the crust is soft and super chewy. My last two experiences will probably be my last. 

A couple of weeks ago I had a buddy over and we ordered a simple large pizza that took an hour and twenty minutes to arrive with no contact from the store about any issue with delivery. I had to call them to find out what was going on. The cheese was burnt and the crust was chewy. Last week I placed an order and it took them 45 minutes to call me and say it was going to be delayed, but wouldn&#39;t tell me why. This was on a Tuesday night. An hour later I called them around 130am to ask what was going on because I knew they closed at 2. The guy said they hadn&#39;t started making it yet because they were busy. He offered to cancel the order and refund my card right away. It was clear they couldn&#39;t be bothered with my order. I told him I wanted my food made and delivered and 45 minutes later I finally got my order. The food was okay, but took 2 1/2 hours to get to me.

Neither time did they try and make up for their terrible service. I got an apology from the delivery guy this last time, but the part I noticed is that in two dozen orders over the past several months I have never seen the same driver twice. Out of all those orders only two of them have found my place without having to call even though I put specific instructions on the order. They have since admitted to not reading them.

I have spent many years in retail management and quality customer service can trump a product/service problems any day. It is clear they need new management because they clearly are not concerned with keeping customers. I probably won&#39;t order from them again unless it&#39;s the only option."

I love it that they are always open even on holidays and until the wee hours of the morning while everybody else shuts down at a wimpy 10:00.  The owner has always been nice &amp; seems to care about any problems that arise.  They do have a problem with consistency, however.  Things can vary wildly from one order to the next.  Sandwiches are pretty light on ingredients &amp; ditto on flavor.  And I have never ordered a pizza that contained all the ingredients I asked for.  NEVER.  I complained to the owner once about this and he sent me out a free replacement.  You guessed it!  It arrived missing ingredients!
They&#39;re sort of like a friend...always there for you, but perhaps slightly flawed.
Good in a pinch for late night munchies.

Congratulations, I joined Yelp to write a review on how bad this place is.  After being a loyal customer for two years (mostly out of not having any other options for pizza delivery past 1 am besides this place), the final straw was a delivery driver crashing into my mailbox and fleeing the scene without telling me or my neighbors.

Here&#39;s a tip for the driver next time you commit a hit and run, don&#39;t park your car that left gray paint on my wooden post right in front of the restaurant the next night.  I may not be able to recover any of the cost of the repairs, but at least you get to drive your Acura with a messed up bumper or have to shell out a deductible to get it fixed, enjoy working for another half year to save up that amount.

As for the owner, Greg, who was &#34;angry&#34; that his driver could do this and not say anything, but apparently not angry enough to look into it or call me back, enjoy your lost business and negative review, you sure earned it.  Your willful ignorance and dismissive demeanor regarding this matter has been astounding.  You might have been able to salvage your reputation with me as a customer by showing a modicum of professionalism or  even returning a phone call.  I&#39;m still here a month later waiting for a direct response from you Greg, i&#39;m not holding my breath though.  I guess the next step is to start pestering corporate.

Update:  After posting this review, the owner&#39;s wife and apparent other co-owner took such offense to it that she called me up at 10 am this past sunday.  At first I was excited to see them finally taking responsibility to their driver&#39;s actions but quickly realized that this contact was made to try and shame me for publishing the truth.  Some gems from this contentious conversation include: 1. claiming that car bumpers do not have paint on them in order for it to rub off on my mailbox post, 2.  Taking issue with me referring to a hit and run being a moving violation, and 3. Her making a strong implication that all the negative yelp reviews are a result of people whose opinions aren&#39;t worth her time and coming from the voices of cowards. Never have I rolled my eyes so much in a ten minute period.  Trying to outline a logical argument with her was akin to me trying to teach my dog algebra.

These people are obviously in way over their heads on how to run an efficient customer driven business, and it will not surprise me when this location closes after they are done alienating their customer base. The irony of her claim that yelp reviews are meaningless but my yelp review prompting her to contact me is apparently lost on her.  In all seriousness, I just think both the owner and his wife are just not that bright of people.  It makes me wonder how they even got the money to start up this franchise in the first place outside of a dead relative.

I thought the biggest insult  was using the apparent death of one of their managers almost 2 weeks after i initially contacted them (as referenced by another yelper as well) as being the reason they never contacted me.  The fact that the owner&#39;s wife referenced this as &#34;people having died for this business&#34; to give legitimacy to her argument very disturbing.  I know that if I was a manager at sarpino&#39;s,  I&#39;d like to be remembered for all my contributions to two swarmy owners using my passing to lend credence to their business acumen.

We ordered a pepperoni pizza and onion rings. The onion rings were cold, soggy and absolutely tasteless. The pizza had a taste to it which I could not describe, it was completely disgusting. It also came with a garlic sauce which I dipped my crust in in order to mask the taste of the pizza, and it was similar to straight up mayonnaise. It literally made me gag. Coming from an Italian, this is the second pizza I turned down in my entire life. We ended up tossing it.

In the words of my fiance, &#34;I know this is drunk food, but take pride in your business&#34;. That is all."

So I gave them a last chance tonight. Same problem. Ordered super taco pizza with thin crust and jalapeño slices on the side, when order was delivered it looked like someone dropped the box on its side and surprise surprise no jalapeño slices. Call and speak to manager he can&#39;t even see the order. He&#39;s reading back to me an old order from June 2012 (yeah that&#39;s how long it&#39;s been) and he reorders that order. So my 2nd order is completely wrong...a super taco pizza with thick crust, extra cheese and sour cream and no tomato...and STILL no jalapeño slices, on the flip side it didn&#39;t look like it was dropped....I call and request a refund, I&#39;m just fed up now. The guy is nice about it and after a few minutes he&#39;s like ok you&#39;re all set. I hang up but I&#39;m sitting here wondering....how am I &#34;all set&#34; if I paid cash??? The food here is good when it&#39;s done right, don&#39;t get me wrong and it&#39;s Saturday night I understand you&#39;re swamped with orders but you need to make sure your customers are getting what they paid for. How do you mess up an electronic order??? It&#39;s all listed out right there clear as day! Needless to say they&#39;ve lost my business. Won&#39;t ever give them another try and tomorrow if the card I used to order back in June 2012 hasn&#39;t been refunded I&#39;ll have to call AGAIN and I really won&#39;t be happy...."

I like going here though. Being from Chicago, where there is always a place to go to for good pizza, Sarpino&#39;s is pretty good. We usually only get the thin sausage, but their other pizzas look good too. I like their pizza because, it has a unique (in a good way) flavor. The sauce is VERY good, free delivery, they have quality ingredients, the crust is buttery and crispy...so good! Even though my husband prefers it very hot and eats his most the day we get it, to me, the pizza is still pretty good the next day. 

I would recommend this pizzeria to anyone."

I have to preface that my girl and I have been living in NYC for the last 8 years for me, over 13 for her.  Needless to say we&#39;ve had the best of the best....but also realize that finding the corner pizza joint that does Neapolitan-style pizza anywhere around the Midwest might be a stretch.  So back to the puffier, cheesier pizzas we both grew up with!

That being said, there just wasn&#39;t anything that impressed us about our two pizzas from Sarpinos.  With a thinner crust, this pizza could have easily been something we bought frozen in the supermarket, ala Red Baron or Tombstone.  And that would have been cheaper.

First off, 14&#34; isn&#39;t a &#34;large&#34;.  That is hardly constitutes a medium, but that&#39;s semantics.  We had a few toppings on 2 pizzas (for a whopping $31...and that was with a 50% discount on the second pizza....jeez), one was totally missing and the other was pretty much dumped onto one piece.  Missing was...fresh basil.  Uh...this is a pizza joint, right?  How is it that one of the base ingredients can be easily forgotten?

- sauce was too sweet.  points to being canned or a can base to balance out over acidic tomatoes.
- cheese was thick and not-pleasant &#34;chewy&#34;.  needs to be fresh and less...which would go further
- our garlic, spinach and mushroom pizza was totally bland.  I am by no way a salter (kinda sneer at salters) but this pizza had me reaching for the kosher salt.
- tomatoes were crunch and white-pink
- we picked the pizza up a few minutes after getting our email notice.  the pizza was slightly warm but not &#34;piping hot&#34;.

We could understand some of these problems...if there was a line or the place was hopping, but when we pulled up there wasn&#39;t any activity.

Really don&#39;t understand what others saw but we sure as shootin&#39; didn&#39;t have any form of magical experience.

Sarpinos just isn&#39;t good, not to mention it&#39;s expensive to boot.  When I want pizza I&#39;m either going to have to shlep it to Cassanos or just go to the dominoes on brookdale.

Why? 

1. Amazing pizza concoctions I never thought would be good - but I find myself craving all the time: 

Buffalo Blue - my current addiction: (you can&#39;t taste the bleu cheese at all), spicy buffalo sauce instead of regular pizza sauce, sliced chunks of chicken breast, onions, cheddar, etc. 

Spinach Special: spinach, scrambled eggs, garlic, garlic butter instead of regular pizza sauce, and lots of different cheeses. 

Mexicana: ground beef, onions, chili peppers, jalapenos, peppers, diced tomatoes, and lots of cheese. 

Cheese Bonanza: puts Pizza Hut&#39;s cheese lover&#39;s to shame. Parmesan, Ricotta, Feta, and a secret gourmet cheese mix. Dip it in the Jalapeno Ranch for an extra kick.

*Chipotle Ranch and Jalapeno Ranch are both dipping sauce options. 

2. FREE DELIVERY!!! For reals. And no minimum to deliver, either.

3. 10% Off if you order online. Seriously! 

4. They&#39;ve got great deals under the &#34;store specials&#34; section. My favourite is the &#39;Sarpino&#39;s Sampler&#39;: 2 10&#34; gourmet or specialty pizzas for $16.99.  I get that and a 2 liter of Diet Coke, and I&#39;ve got lunch at work for 2-3 days!  

5. The delivery guys are always nice, friendly, and quick.  (Others have complained, but I order at least once a week, and have never had a problem).

- only draw back is the limited availability of sides. but with pizza this good, i&#39;ve never had enough room for sides anyway!"

But Sarpino&#39;s pizza is so damn good, I make an effort to carryout instead every time.  I wish I could either take advantage of the free delivery or get a discount for picking it up every time.

We&#39;ve only ordered the thin sausage, but one day we&#39;ll try something new.  The menu is large, and Yelpers seem to like other items.

Reasons the pizza is phenomenal:

-Uniqueness.  Never tasted a pizza like it.
-The sauce is borderline perfect, and they even include an extra marinara dip with your pizza.
-Spotty delivery is free.  Although it should be noted the pizza tastes soooooooo much better when hot as hell.
-Quality ingredients, including the sausage.
-The thin crust is so buttery with the right amount of crispness.  if you&#39;re looking for paper-thin crust, look elsewhere.
-Franchised, meaning there are tons of other locations where you are supposed to receive the same, standardized product.  i can&#39;t speak for other locations, but theoretically every other Sarpino&#39;s should be as good as this one!
-Discounts.  Order more than one for Buy One, Get One 50% off.  Or stop in to order from their carry-out menu, which has about 10 money-saving coupons for almost anything on the menu.  This pizza will come out cheaper than most other quality competitors.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (for pickup and a swift drive home)

4.25/5 (minus 0.75 star for spotty, but free, delivery service)"

Then something changed about a year or so ago.  The pizzas became overcooked (like where the top is nearly black), with little sauce.  Even if you ask them to put more sauce on it and not overcook it, they don&#39;t follow those directions.

But it&#39;s really hit and miss...one time the pizza is good...the next week, the pizza is terrible.  I want to call them and ask them who&#39;s making the pizza just because I think it&#39;s really just the difference of the pizza maker...I&#39;m just surprised at how inconsistent it is.

I decided to pick up so I can&#39;t comment on delivery times. The pizza was ready in about 20 minutes.

Perfect thin slices of pepperoni with a little crisp. Not too heavy on the cheese and tasty sauce. I&#39;d say all the ingredients were proportional. The crust was not thin and had a nice chewy consistency. Ingredients went nearly to the edge of the pizza (no skimping). 

Came with some red sauce and a pepper. Will likely order from them again. The medium was a great snack/meal for 2. At around $8.50, way better than any frozen thing at the grocery (even if it&#39;s rising crust)"

When I called at 10:30 Saturday morning the very rude hostess- Jessica was her name I believe snapped and &#34;snootily&#34; said we dont take reservations! I explained to her that I know that and was just doing as instructed the day prior by another host. She abruptly told me to hold on and put Debbie( her mgr) on the line w/o any prior warning may I add. So I re explained to Debbie the reason for my call. She as well was not very welcoming and very un-accomodating! I was very agitated at this point. Decided to call the Downers Grove location-glad I did! Spoke to a girl who was very nice and friendly, explained that ans why they dont take reservations but  and offered to put my group on a wait list. She then suggested that I speak to her mgnr- Suzanne who was SUPER warm and welcoming! I told her what I had dealt with with the Bolingbrook location and she was highly shocked.

Moral of my review..avoid the Bolingbrook location and go get quality service at the Downers Grove location..I guarantee you wont be disappointed.

Waited for almost an hour and a half and still no breakfast. Waitress checks every now and then but the tables close to me keep turning their beards because they are either waiting for their checks or waiting to be served. Don&#39;t open a breakfast place if you can&#39;t serve within 20 minutes.

We ordered our food, but then it took so long. It was because they dropped our ticket of our order in the back. It took them like an hour to serve us our food. So we ate, and the chicken did not taste good. After we ate, my mom asked for a discount or something. The cashier said why and my mom told them the story. But the cashier did not let us have one. So we don&#39;t like it."

I ordered a spinach feta cheese and artichoke omelette and it was watery and gray they didn&#39;t drain the artichokes before adding them to the eggs and it made the whole thing soggy it look horrible when it was served and I just picked thru the stuff to eat it.

Eggs were literally cold.  I asked the server how can this be and she said I don&#39;t know.  Crispy bacon was wobbly and no where near crispy.  Grits were luke warm at best and the English muffin was sopping wet with butter which I did not ask for.

I ordered the the skirt steak with hash browns, over easy eggs, and toast. I wanted the steak medium well, and the hash browns well done. They nailed it, steak was very good. hash browns were perfect. Even though the eggs were on the running side, it didn&#39;t ruin the meal. Had more then enough portions. I was seated immediately, waitress was a little slow. Food came out pretty quickly though.
Overall I had a really good experience, I recommend all the yelpers to give this place a try when you&#39;re in the area."

What works? I&#39;ve always had very nice servers there. The coffee is better than most other breakfast places and they often ask if I want to take a cup to go, which is nice. Bacon is great. All pastry, pancake, waffle and sweet types of breakfasts have tasted very good; they appear to specialize in the sweet side of breakfasts. French toast cream cheese creations, wonderful! All the different kinds of pancakes have been good. But if you want eggs, this is not the place for it. We love trying omelettes at every breakfast place we go, and we have NEVER been able to enjoy the ones here. Runny or greasy is a way I would describe them. Scrambled eggs have tasted watery. We&#39;ve avoided ordering egg dishes because of it. But stupidly, i try to order eggs benedict three times now, and this third time was my last. First - I will say that I always ask for my poached eggs to be poached WELL/Hard. I don&#39;t like runny eggs, which seems to throw off every server when I order eggs benedict but want the eggs cooked well. EVERY TIME I have ordered this, the eggs come out runny and have to be re-done. i don&#39;t totally get what the issue is, but it has happened three times. Second, when they brought out the last re-done dish, the eggs were cooked but the entire dish was drowning in sauce. Drowning to the point I had to fish out the food and move to another plate to eat it. The English muffin was soaking and gross. I ate the eggs and left everything else. And this was not the only time it came out this way. So long story short: Coffee, bacon and sweet breakfasts good. Egg dishes not so good."

We walked in and were impressed with the friendliness and the size of the place. We were seated right away, which is always great when you have small children. After a few minutes our server came by and introduced herself and took our drink order. All seemed to be going well.

After looking over the extensive menu, we had made up our minds about what to order. Actually, I was torn between two items, so I asked our server. She immediately suggested that I NOT order the skirt steak and eggs. She told me it was not good and is one of the most returned meals on the menu. So I went with my second option, chicken and waffles. 

I don&#39;t particularly care for the fake syrup, so I ordered the Vermont Maple Syrup for $1.50 extra. A small price to pay for actually enjoying my food.

When the food arrived, it all looked good. But that&#39;s generally where it stopped. I ordered my eggs over-medium. When I cut into them, the whites were  not cooked. Not a little runny. Not cooked. So I tried my daughter&#39;s scrambled eggs. Bad choice. They seem to use an artificially butter-flavored oil to cook them. I couldn&#39;t swallow what I was chewing because the flavoring was that bad. 

My wife encouraged me to order more eggs, but since we were 0 for 2, I choose to just forgo the eggs and focus on my waffle, which was actually very good. The chicken portion of the &#34;Chicken and Waffles&#34; was just two fried chicken tenders, but they were okay. So I poured my syrup all over my waffle and starting eating. Much to my dismay, this was not the real maple syrup I ordered, but it was too late. My wife&#39;s breakfast wasn&#39;t positively memorable, either, as she said her grits were utterly tasteless.

When we received the check, I noticed we had been charged for the maple syrup. My wife wanted me to just let it be. If the food had been better, I might have.

I mentioned the syrup issue to the cashier and she apologized, which I appreciated. However, she asked if I wanted to take the syrup home with me. I declined and told her I just wanted it with my meal. She had to get approval to remove the charge, but the manager asked her why I wasn&#39;t just taking it now. She explained to him I didn&#39;t want it because I wanted it with my meal. It seems a little silly to expect your customers to just take a small bottle of syrup home with them, because you forgot to give it to them with their meal and you&#39;d rather get the $1.50...or push a few buttons. 

All in all, the staff was friendly, the place was clean and service was quick. The food just wasn&#39;t all that great."

Don&#39;t get me wrong, the place is gorgeous but was completely surprised when I walked through the door. I ordered the &#39;Lemon Blueberry Ricotta Pancake Combo&#39; and was not as good as I expected unfortunately. The eggs were average and the pancakes had no special taste, very bland.

My family and I went to Breakfast at Honey Jam on Boughton Road. This commentary is limited to this specific location. We all ordered our breakfast and waited quite a long time for it to be brought to our table. During our wait, the toast I ordered was brought to the table. This was the same toast brought to the table next to us but no one at that table ordered toast. I did os they brought it to me. I said I prefer my toast to be hot and served with my breakfast. They removed the toast. What seemed like an eternity (probably another 5 minutes or so), our breakfast was served. I had pancakes, eggs and bacon, all were cold. I did not get my toast. I called to the waitress and said my breakfast was cold, to remove it and take it off the bill as I was not going to pay for a cold breakfast. She obliged and returned with another plate of cold toast. Shortly afterward, the manager came to the table. You can tell he had an attitude. He said he did not appreciate that I told the waitress my meal was cold and remove it. When I tried to explain, he got all huffy and asked me to leave. My family left."

Our server was attentive and a manager discounted our bill slightly, but serving up 4 cold dishes for breakfast, before a Sunday rush, was an epic fail. Obviously the kitchen has low standards. The group census was comical, as no one wanted the voucher for $15 off a future visit.

We had a short older woman who seemed really annoyed to have us there. It took her about ten minutes to come over and when we ordered drinks we asked for waters too. Got the drinks never brought us water. After ordering our food we noticed after a half hour everyone around us who came WAY after us got their food and we didn&#39;t have anything. We had empty drinks and no server. She kept running by us staring but wouldn&#39;t tell us what was up or just ask if we wanted more to drink. Finally I got so angry I walked up to the host stand and she ran over and told me that my sisters food got screwed up and that was what was taking so long. I&#39;m so baffled that I just had to walk away. My sister and I are servers too, if something gets messed up we get it but don&#39;t ignore us because we look like your average &#34;teenagers&#34;. My boyfriend went over to the manager to complain and she was very nice to us. Apparently our server didn&#39;t tell her what was going on with our table because she was very genuine in her apology and also looked confused when we told her. She gave us a coupon to come back and comped our entire bill as it should have been. We had to take our food to go unfortunately because we had to attend classes! Which also made the situation worse. Wanting to eat out before class sounded like a great idea, which was unfortunately ruined by bad service. We will give it one more chance but probably try downers grove then here."

Arriving 20 minutes before my companions were due, I took advantage of this by ordering one of these items.  A  full 20 minutes AFTER they arrived  as my breakfast companions were being served (approximately 40 minutes after being ordered) the waitress informs me they were &#34;out&#34; of my selection, &#34;would I like something else&#34;.  This bothered me I asked why it took so long to inform me, she explained she was just told - after 40 minutes?  I ordered eggs and hash browns.  A few minutes later the same waitress brings out a &#34;failed attempt&#34; at my original order asking if I still wanted it.  Now I&#39;m confused - I was informed they were out.

The manager comes over to take the blame.  At this point I don&#39;t care who is to blame, I&#39;m hungry and I was lied too.  The manager insists I was NOT lied too.  Okay, customer is wrong...Not worth the aggravation, I&#39;ll eat my breakfast elsewhere from now on.

I&#39;m pregnant and can&#39;t eat runny eggs.  First time ever I sent something back.  What was weird though was the waitress wanted me to scrape my hash browns off my plate so she could take the dish portion back.  I told her to just take it all back.  She returned pretty quickly.  Clearly the cook removed the runny eggs put new eggs on and put a ridiculous amount of sauce all over the dish....it was seriously inedible.  Oh and I got the same hash browns back and they were cold.  Frustrated I just picked off my husbands plate.  I would have sent it back again but the waitress never returned.  My kid was getting tired of sitting at the table so I took her out to the car.  Another 5 minutes go by and my husband texts me saying still no service at the table.

I appreciate they leave a pot of coffee on the table so I don&#39;t have to constantly flag down a waitress for a warm up.

The hostess is very polite and seats quickly, the waitresses are on their game, with personality, service, and putting up with my group&#39;s foolishness. I had the Greek Omelet  on my last visit..... Now I&#39;ve placed this order at many places and I&#39;m never impressed. The eggs are always flavorless, and the only bite you get is the sparse crumb of feta. Not here! The eggs, spinach, and tomatoes were actually all seasoned, complimenting the liberal adornment of feta. They got this dish right! And their Iced Mocha, not the best I&#39;ve had, but certainly the best I&#39;ve had from a restaurant, by far."

Someone made another Egglectic but just made it 100 times the size. Not too many healthy choices on the kid&#39;s menu. The side of fruit was pitiful. Was that A grape? Ohh pineapple...A piece!

We asked for egg yolks for our infant and they came slathered in butter. DRIPPING with butter. Yeah good idea.

Pay registers are poorly placed in entrance traffic pattern so small children are being trampled and lost all over the place.

Won&#39;t be returning and it&#39;s sad that so many people support giant corporate fat cows like Portillos&#39; and Friday&#39;s and Applebee&#39;s when the ma n&#39; pa shops are trying to offer us healthy food from local providers made fresh with fresh ingredients.

Won&#39;t be returning as it&#39;s just not our style at all and we went to meet a friend who &#34;loves&#34; HJC. We&#39;ll pick the place next time.

If you made it to here in my review and are fuming because you love Portillo&#39;s and Applebee&#39;s and Friday&#39;s, rest assured that HJC will not let you down. You will get good service, large portions, flavorful food (lots of butter and salt and cream and sugar where applicable) at an affordable price."

Who knows.  My husband ordered green tea for his drink one time, and it smelled/tasted like seaweed from the ocean. - bleh.  I would stick to juice or water, but when it comes to the breakfast menu items, it&#39;s hard to go wrong with anything.  

As a side note, my husband ordered a salad the last time we were there, and found a piece of plastic in the bowl.

- no Mediterriean croissant

We called ahead and made a reservation for two. We arrive and were seated right away, which was very nice. The place wasn&#39;t too busy but it seemed like for a larger group there was a wait. 

Once at our table we looked over the menu to see what to order. We waited over ten minutes without anyone coming by to even get our drink order. My bf had to flag down someone to ask for our waitress, and then that took another five minutes.

She was nice, took our order and then came back with our coffee. 

We ordered the countryside skillet.. Our waitress brought our food and asked if we needed anything else. I asked for a water. We started to eat, was so disappointed. My hash browns were greasy and soggy. When we were done eating  a gentleman came and took our dishes. 

That was the only part of eating here which was pleasant. I never did get my water and she took forever for the check.

My bf had been here numerous times, and even said that this was the worst experience he had ever had."

That&#39;s what makes this review so hard. Since the change in ownership in August, the food quality has gone down, and down, and down. I would compare it now to an iHop with a nicer interior.

They have changed everything from their toast, silver dollar pancakes, turkey sausage ... all NOT better! This morning may have been the final straw ... they changed their Pumpkin Waffle!! It was smaller, didn&#39;t taste the same, and was served with much less topping!

We feel like we are breaking up with a long relationship, but we have tried Eggs, Inc now a few times and the food is MUCH better. We went to Honey Jam one last time this morning and had our usual experience to what we have had over the last few months ...

The staff was WONDERFUL and the food was TERRIBLE!

Every time I visit I always get waitressed by the same woman that never smiles and has a nasty attitude. You can&#39;t miss her. I visited two days ago and she walked away from our table while taking an order. She never came back to take the rest of our table&#39;s order until 30 mins later. She was too busy speaking to a couple that was sitting next to us the whole time. I had to tell the kitchen manager our order to complete as well as order things we needed because we were not properly accommodated.

When we got our food it was ok.  2 of us ordered skillets and they were very bland and one of the hashbrowns were cold.  The house made hollandaise sauce tasted a little like gravy.  Was more brownish than yellow. If you like gravy that&#39;s fine but I prefer mine a little more buttery. The eggs benedict tasted off cause of it.

Went there with a friend. Upon waking in I was instantly pleased with the atmosphere. Very cabin-like. Warm and dark furnishing, a fireplace, dark oak wood. Just nice feeling overall. Plenty of seating too.
I was given a table instantly and had a waiter serve us drinks a few minutes after. My waiter was &#39;Adam,&#39; he was helpful in helping us choose our items. I got the Classic scrambled eggs with no meat and pancakes. And my friend got the Denver-style omelet. It came, with a good serving size of eggs, perhaps 2 eggs, hash browns and 2 pancakes. DELICIOUS! The waiter had a good eye when our water was running low refilled. My meal only costed me $5.50  and with tax $6.05 and with a tip $7.30.

Telling us it will take 5 minutes for a table, and being seated 20 minutes later, should have been our first red flag (and encouraged us to leave). 

They were out of my first two choices, so to make it easy on them, I ordered toast and hash browns. They forgot the toast (yes, apparently that was an order too difficult to fulfill) and the hash browns were so raw that I can&#39;t imagine they ever got &#34;browned.&#34; 

No one seemed to care about anything, or have even a tiny sense of urgency about the diners. I can&#39;t imagine this place will last long with this kind of attitude and service."

First off it was dry. I never thought an omelette could be described as dry, but that&#39;s exactly how mine was. The vegetables were not sauteed before being added so they were hard. The hashbrowns were OK, but very bland and my toast was cold. My boyfriend had the huevos rancheros which he said was good, but nothing special. 
   I didn&#39;t even eat half of my meal. We were sitting waiting for the check when the manager walked over to ask if we needed a box. He didn&#39;t ask us how everything was or even introduce himself. 
   We didn&#39;t know you had to pay at the counter so when my boyfriend tried to hand the money to the waiter and the waiter said &#34;Can you do it? I&#39;m busy and have the whole room to wait on.&#34; we were done with giving this place a chance.

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros which was their version and take on it and I was surprised at how good it was. It wasn&#39;t overdone, cooked well, and simple.

I&#39;m very happy they got over their grand-opening shortcomings from the first few times we came here.  I really am a fan of this place now, for both breakfast and lunch options.  

No service glitches at all anymore.  Every server we have waiting on us has been pleasant, informative, and spot on! I would like to give a special shout-out to Justin, though.  We have him often as a server, and let&#39;s just say to watch this guy work a crowded section of the restaurant is amazing.  He&#39;s quick, nice, and overly efficient. This guy deserves an award or something. 

Like I said, we have been coming in quite often, so here&#39;s a little list of my personal do&#39;s and dont&#39;s of the Honey Jam Cafe:

Do skip the steak and eggs.  For $14, I expected a pretty huge meal, and one that tastes pretty good as well.  The steak is Angus, but I&#39;m still not impressed.  They cook it to order, but it is a small, under seasoned, plain piece of meat.  One thing I do like, is they will happily substitute out my potatoes for some cottage cheese.  

Do get the crepes.  I&#39;m not sure about the fruit filled crepes, but the plain crepes are excellent.  Pair them with a side of Applewood smoked bacon for a great breakfast dish.  The bacon is good, although sometimes a bit overcooked.

Do skip the chorizo and eggs.  I like the authentic style Mexican breakfast, but this falls rather short.  First off, their chorizo lacks any of the signature orange colored grease, which makes the sausage&#39;s flavor.  It is rather dry and tasteless.  Served with nearly plain white rice and soupy black beans, this will never be one of my favorite dishes here. 

For lunch, do get the 1/2 sandwich with soup or salad.  I like the California wrap. It is a veggie tortilla with sliced turkey, avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and 1,000 Island dressing.  It comes with fries, and be sure to ask for a side of southwest ranch dressing to dip the fries in.  So much better than plain catsup any day! For the soup, I really enjoy the thick and tasty Chicken Tortilla soup."

The interior is beautiful and the waitstaff is attentive.  We were most excited that they brewed intelligentsia coffee since we rarely have the opportunity for good coffee when we go out for breakfast.  Although the menu said no substitutes we were still able to make one small one to keep our breakfast a little healthier.  Everything was cooked right and warm when it arrived to our table.  

Though I feel you can rarely go wrong with a breakfast joint there are times when you can go extra right... I think Honey Jam leans a little extra towards the good side with their delicious coffee and fair prices."

Great breakfast selections but they draw quite the breakfast crowd. Parking is less than desirable as they share a lot with Portillos and butt up against the beginning of Portillos drive thru lane. Definitely some of the most original and gourmet breakfast choices in the area but again the omelette needs some work. Pancakes and French toast are wonderful.

The wait was only 10 mins which I didn&#39;t mind since my company had not arrived yet. It was a beautiful morning so I just waited outside.  Before I knew it my pager went off and I was greeted by a smiling hostess.  

The dining room was darker than other places.  It was nice but better suited for dinner time. My waitress greeted me quickly with menus and my coffee with french vanilla cream was on the way. 

I usually order simple dishes when visiting a restaurant the first time. I had the 2 eggs breakfast over medium with pancakes, hash browns and Cherrywood smoked bacon. Pretty easy to make and it was absolutely delish!! 

The pancakes were the best I&#39;ve had in a restaurant. The hash browns cooked perfect for me - not too crunchy or soft. The bacon was the best... nice smokey flavor and cooked just right. The eggs were good too.

My dinning partner had waffles, scrambled eggs with cheese and a large OJ.  The bill was cents under $30 for both. I don&#39;t mind paying more for good food and experience.  It&#39;s part of the Portillo&#39;s chain so I expected it.

The one thing I didn&#39;t like was the location.  The cafe is behind or next to Portillo&#39;s. So, the aisle I parked in filled up with the overflow from the Portillo&#39;s drive through.  I had to wait until the line went down before I could leave. Minus one star for location. Lesson learned.  

I will be back!"

The server was the only nice thing here. They were training a hostess, not trying to pick on her, but I am surprised she can find the front door, because even with a cheat sheet,  she could not find the tables. This was not some teenage girl, this is a woman in her 40&#39;s. Since my review,  I have come under attack by private messages from their staff. Very inappropriate to respond that way.

Our server was beyond wonderful and sweet.  Our food was good and it came out in a reasonable amount of time.  This place is a little more expensive than other places but you get your moneys worth with the portion size.  I had to box up half my breakfast because I was so full.

When i try a new breakfast spot like go simple. If you cant get the basics right then thats a problem. Today I ordered simple steak and eggs, and cheese blintzes. The steak and eggs consisted of two eggs scrambled, steak (medium), hashbrowns and two pancakes. The egg were decent, a little too wet, but still soft and custardy. The steak was not so great. It was seasoned well, but it was cooked unusually. It was pink in the middle but dry like it was welldone. The ends were tough, almost like someone pressed it on the grill and sqeezed all the juices out. The hashbrowns were just ok, they kind of reminded me of Denny&#39;s. The pancakes were not good at all. They were crusted and dry on top (over cooked), dense (too much flour in batter) and arrived cold. The cheese blintzes were not bad. The crepes were eggy and light. The cheese filling was soft and creamy, lightly sweet. The only problem was they used way too much cinnamon,  but other than that, they were good. The highlight of the meal was fresh orange juice. Overall I would say this meal was just ok, it had more lows than highs. Frankly I expected better from a Portillo&#39;s branded restaurant. The meal with drinks cost just over $30. For that much, I have been to many places that cost half as much and were twice as good. I gave 3 stars because of taste, but they really deserve 2.5 for the other issues."

This place gives you a lot of food. A LOT of food. I don&#39;t understand why people call this pricey for what it is; when I visited with my brother and cousin, the three of us ordered four entrees and coffee and paid $50 for three people. We even took food home. That&#39;s quite a lot of value for just under $17 each. Oh, and the food was excellent!

On my recent visit, I ordered the Julian&#39;s Benedict and split the Bananas Foster crêpes. Both were fantastic and just perfect. My brother ordered the chorizo &amp; eggs and my cousin ordered waffles with strawberries and bananas. Both my brother and my cousin were pretty satisfied as well. The chorizo &amp; eggs was really good and the waffles were huge!

I couldn&#39;t believe how big the entrees were. It was plenty of food - probably more than they needed to serve. I think it&#39;s a great value.

The server was really funny. Maybe a little weird, but really funny. She did try very hard even though she wasn&#39;t the fastest server; that&#39;s okay, she didn&#39;t make any big mistakes and always refilled our coffee and water promptly.

I like this place and I&#39;m really glad there is one in Bolingbrook. It&#39;s a perfect family place and Bolingbrook is where my family is at, so it&#39;s ideal. I will definitely be back."

We visited at lunch which made parking (on a rainy day) a slight hassle because of its close proximity to its sister restaurant. 

There was a very brief wait, but not anything unreasonable. We were led to a table in a very busy traffic pattern, the hostess could tell we were not happy and moved us to another location, at a corner which was even worse. Finally we were offered a booth in a more private room which was much better. But, as I looked around, there really were no tables in the larger rooms, that did not have people rushing past, people being led past you to get to other tables, or just a lot of commotion.

There were a few minor kinks which will probably work themselves out.  Portions were generous and there certainly is something for everyone on the menu.

The register to pay is located in a strange area, and yet again, accessible by weaving your way through tables.

Just a suggestion, leave a carafe of water on the table."

My mom &amp; I went today around 11 a.m. There were roughly 15 other people waiting, but the waiting area is larger than most &amp; there was plenty of seating. A flat-screen TV displayed a slide show of different menu items, which I found helpful &amp; unique. We only had to wait about 10 minutes before being seated.

Our server was friendly &amp; polite. My mom ordered the Mediterranean Croissant (sautéed baby spinach, roasted red peppers, feta cheese, &amp; crispy bacon), &amp; I got the Bacon Waffle. Her sandwich looked really tasty, MINUS the huge hunk of feta cheese. We both expected feta crumbles, but the cheese was a large slice, about half an inch thick. She didn&#39;t eat the cheese, but said the croissant was very fresh &amp; she enjoyed it overall.

My waffle was tasty as well. The menu said the bacon would be mixed throughout the batter, but the bacon pieces were actually on top of the waffle. Regardless, the combination of savory &amp; sweet is a good thing. 

I see in Sheila M.&#39;s review that she had terrible service, but it looks like Honey Jam Cafe has gotten its act together since then. Our food only took between 10-15 minutes to arrive. I&#39;ll definitely be back."

 It starts with the weird baroque decor, the dim lighting, and the ice cold draft; I would ascribe a more country living style to the name Honey Jam.  I&#39;d brighten things up a bit, and I&#39;d turn off the G-D A/C-It is November 1st, after all! (trust me, we asked for the heat to be turned on and apparently only Dick Portillo can do that).

And while I&#39;m sure that most of the gals out there would describe our waiter as &#34;Hot&#34;, he should perhaps reinvent himself as a stripper or a runway model, cuz he ain&#39;t much of a waiter.  We waited forever for drink straws and coffee creamer, and my wife eventually went to the front counter for the creamer.  Same story for the pancake syrup.  Remember kids, it&#39;s the little things.....

And the food was uninspired, at best.  I went with the Tuscan omelet and found it to be a rather gooey, bland mess.  My wife thought the same of her Egg Beaters Tuscan Omelet.  My daughter did enjoy her scrambled eggs, chocolate chip pancakes, and sausage links.  Butterfield&#39;s is exponentially better."

I have no complaints with the quality of the food, but it took a very long time. We were seated in a party room, which seemed to be all tables with a crying baby and us. My gf insists it was her orange and red mohawk, but I don&#39;t think the little highschooler seating us cared one way or another about her haircut. 

My meal was fine. Her meal was not, even after the 2nd try. They&#39;d delivered the completely wrong meal, and then brought a 2nd one that had one of the ingredients still in it she&#39;d asked to have omitted. (tomatoes, maybe?). At that point we were both so hungry and we didn&#39;t want to wait 10 more minutes to get a 3rd attempt at her dish. 

The high ceilings with painted metal made the whole place an echo chamber, and the service was uber-slow. I won&#39;t be back, I&#39;ve got plenty of other places to try."

About on par with other breakfast places in the area, although with fancier decor and a longer wait. First time there today: many people waiting inside and outside, was told there would be a 20-minute wait, but it ended up being more like 40 minutes.

We were seated next to a fairly large group that was wrapping up to leave, and they sure were taking their sweet time and loitering around, which makes me suspect that THEY were (at least partly) the reason that the wait was longer than expected. I wish people weren&#39;t so self-centered and ignorant, and I know it&#39;s difficult for the restaurant to ask them to leave in cases like this. Once we were seated the service was pretty fast and efficient. Food was not bad at all, but not out-of-this-world. Prices are fair too.

Would I return if there was a wait? Probably not. If there wasn&#39;t a wait? Absolutely."

My sons grilled cheese didn&#39;t even lol like grilled cheese just looked like a regular cheese sandwich and my sisters eggs Benedict was cold. And my other sisters eggs had cheese when she didn&#39;t ask for it and also cold... Wasn&#39;t even a decent visit with the wait and the food and hearing a bunch of excuses short on staff  I heard the table in back of us say they were light headed and really wanted there food and the waitress said that they&#39;re trying their best. And I felt horrible for the other customers having to deal with what we just did. And I also feel awful for our waitress because it obviously wasn&#39;t her fault and I couldn&#39;t imagine dealing with hungry angry customers but she did a good job for what she was dealing with but if the place was more organized and ran like an actual resultant I&#39;m sure she would have been a lot better! I am very disappointed with the service and food! I got food I didn&#39;t ask for would if I had an allergy? I&#39;d be screwed wouldn&#39;t I! I&#39;m not happy with this place at all!

We were seated at 1104 in the back party-room. Marla was our server and she did an absolutely fabulous job. My wife ordered the French Toast and my Mom and Dad ordered omelettes.

The lunch meals -- 

wife: Pumpkin Waffle with cheesecake topping

mother: Italian Wedding Soup and Chicken Harvest 1/2 Wrap
me: BBQ Chicken Tortilla Salad

My mother did not like the soup (I did not know she had tried Italian Wedding Soup before and had not liked it). Other than that little blip, everything else was excellent. We were seated immediately in a space that was convenient for my mom, who walks with a cane. The service was exactly what one would want it to be -- friendly, fast, accurate.

I almost died, so luckily I found this place with good reviews and they certainly  lived up to it. I was glad they were able to accommodate a party of nine within a half hour, but it was Sunday and Super Bowl...

First, I just want to say the customer  service was great. Everyone was warm and welcoming.  Never had to wait long for service or questions. Food was literally back to back from appetizers, salads/soups, to entrees. 

The portions are huge. You mostly fill up on that addictive garlic bread! Then we ordered calamari which wasn&#39;t too greasy like most places and was light in texture which was good. By then I was already full and forgot about my salad! Salad was fresh along with everything else. Finally, my entree was stuffed shells - I couldn&#39;t even finish one shell I was so stuffed, but the sauce tasted good - had a nice flavor with chunky tomatoes. 

The ambiance is nice sit down, very quaint feel in an old-fashioned building. Kid-friendly too with a kid menu. Prices were reasonable. I&#39;m not too familiar  with the area, but good restaurants are hard to come by when I&#39;m visiting the Joliet area, glad to have found this place."

The best calamari I&#39;ve ever had: light, crispy batter, tender, perfectly cooked squid with no rubberband texture. Excellent drink menu, and they&#39;ll swap out liquors to suit your taste. Salad was super fresh and well dressed. Pastas were plentiful and so yummy, sauces were spot on. And the lemon cake is slap yourself stupid good. I&#39;d tell you all to go, but I&#39;m worried I won&#39;t get a table next time."

  It&#39;s your local small own business, serving Italian cuisines. Which I&#39;d have to say were exceptional. 
  Before you begin you meal the waiter or waitress will bring forth dinner rolls which are fresh, with garlic and olive oil. ( you will not be able to resist by only having one. ) 
  Our choice was to start the appetizer off with an spinach sauté. Which was amazingly good. 
  For the main course I chose the penne w/sausage &amp; red peppers, My wife, the Pasta Del Sol. Both dishes were cooked and prepared to perfection. 
  Each bite was very pleasant, Not to much salt. Nor one flavor overpowering thee other. Just delicious. 
  I&#39;d have to say next time I decide to venture out into the Lockport area. I will be returning to try some more dishes. 
  Oh yeah and before I forget. The staff was exceptional. Very friendly &amp; welcoming. as well for the owner. Catering to whatever it is that you would need."

Food was excellent, even the next day when I had the leftovers for lunch.  Service was very good also, even though this was our first time in we were treated like regulars.  Prices were also very reasonable especially considering the portion.  I had the Chicken Onesta and I would highly recommend it.  My wife had the Chicken Parmesan and also enjoyed it very much.  I will say this we made reservations for 4:45 Saturday Night and I am glad we did shortly after that the restaurant was full.  Reservations were made online and worked very well. No issues."

He used to live in the area a few years ago - so knowing what was out here we were not feeling too optimistic. However found this gem on yelp tried it out and now after dinner had to compliment on how amazing it was!!!! Thoroughly impressed and this will be a regular spot for us. 

I ordered chicken Parmesan that was so good! The chicken was very juicy but still maintaining good balance of crisp to the breading and cheese on top. Sauce was very flavorful and fresh. Even the side of spaghetti was cooked perfectly.  My husband got the special which was Asiago stuffed gnocchi. Whenever we get Italian he always orders gnocchi so this was a sign from the start! Very rich and flavorful. Both of us enjoyed sharing one another&#39;s dishes!

Our waitress Ariana was so nice as well as the rest of the staff. I can&#39;t even think of one complaint. Great price point. Great portions. Loved ambience. My husband and I literally high fived each other we were so glad to find a great place out in Lockport"

I had a chicken lemon sauce dish. The lemon sauce was an awful gravy. Lemon sauce should be nothing like gravy. The chicken had the weirdest texture, it definitely was not grilled to order. I sent that back. I had the carbonara, thinking that it couldn&#39;t possibly be messed up. I was wrong. My boyfriend had spaghetti and meatballs. There was water separating from the sauce!

I was even more surprised to find that Mamma Onesta&#39;s is there, and it rivals any Italian restaurant on the south side.  This place is the bomb for authentic Italian served in a homey atmosphere.  

We came in on a Saturday night sans reservations, and there was a 45 minute wait.  We decided to saddle up to the bar and we ordered a couple of martini&#39;s.  Both drinks were well mixed, and both bartenders were friendly and efficient.  After only 15 minutes our table opened up, so we were seated promptly by the hostess.

Server was nice as can be (can&#39;t recall her name).  The food was awesome.  We started with the calamari (cooked perfectly, not too heavy).  We also had spicy corn soup with habaneros... this was excellent.  I had chicken parmigana, my GF had eggplant parmigana.  Both dishes were enormous and delicious.

Total bill with drinks was less than $100, which I thought was quite fair.  The service and food are awesome.  We also met the owner who was telling us a bit about the history of the building and downtown Lockport.  Overall an excellent place- I&#39;m excited to come here again!"

I had a reservation for 7:45pm. We sat down and no one came to our table for a good 15 minutes. Finally, I asked an employee where our server was and he took our table kindly even though I don&#39;t think we were his normal table. We started with their signature garlic rolls, which are good, but were practically hard as a rock. We were using forks and knives to cut through them.

I had the house salad with the creamy Italian dressing, which is one of the best dressings I have had. It came with my entree, which was chicken parmasean with a side of spaghetti. I felt like there was too much sauce and not enough cheese on the chicken, but it was still good.

My favorite thing here is the beer cheese soup but it&#39;s a daily special and they don&#39;t have it on Monday&#39;s apparently."

I arrived at 5:20 by myself and was immediately seated and given a menu; it took 15+ minutes for a server to approach me.  The another 15 minutes to deliver the bottled water I ordered.  Then about 12 additional minutes to take my order.  Another 15 minutes to bring me a bowl of soup ( minestrone / exceedingly mediocre-poor/ primarily composed of canned green beans probably from an industrial sized drum.).  60+ minutes after arriving I got my simple (chicken scallopini w/olives and sun dried tomatoes -- fine/not great.). 

Pretty girls and muscular boys in black tee shirts as servers. Plastic vines and grapes, a framed poster of the &#34;David&#34; and plastic plaques reading vino and salute!  You get the picture.

The server was sweet but too busy and visibly relieved by the simplicity of my order and lack of questions.  Tables seated after me were served before I was.  Food okay; service lousy (not unkind, simply inadequate.)"

The garlic knots that day were soft and the side order of meatballs came in their own bowl with a slightly different sauce which I enjoyed. I also liked that the meatballs were dense like my Nonna used to make. 

Last night, however, the stuffed shells I ordered were WAY over salted. My dining companions (who I had talked the place up to) also reported their food was over salted. My add-on meatballs came on my entree plate this visit and were dry and bland. Our garlic knots this visit were hard.

I think I&#39;ll give the restaurant one more try since it is fairly close to where I live and we do not have many good dining options out here. Maybe last night was just an off night?"

We got there about 6:30 and started with drinks and the bruschetta. Bruschetta was ok. Nothing amazing but delicious. Admittedly, I didn&#39;t try the garlic rolls. They looked good though. 

I ordered the tortellini aurora. It was basically cheese tortellini in a vodka sauce. It was amazing! I allowed my dining companion to try some and he was immediately jealous. While his penne with sausage and roasted red peppers was good, it paled in comparison. Wine rec: If you choose the amazing tortellini, try the Main Street Cab with it. It was a nice combination.

The Strawberry Torte was amazing. I have very few words to describe it as the deliciousness left me speechless.

An appetizer, two meals, one dessert, and six adult beverages came in around $100. It was incredibly reasonable and incredibly delicious!"

I ordered the Veal Parmigiana, and it was quite delicious, though not as large portioned as I hoped. Overall it was very good. It came with spaghetti with tomato sauce, I love the sauce.

Nice touches all around, lemons in the water, excellent service etc, they even made a child portion of Gnocchi for my little one , 

Although my wife disliked her entree, and only had one bite, they promptly removed it from our bill.

I would of gave a 5 however the next table were 2 couples, one of them was drunk, rude and classless, Throwing F bombs like they were candy, and saying out loud,&#34; I need to piss&#34; Not very lady like, she was so offensive and drunk, she annoyed the other lady at her table to the point where you stood up, took her keys and purse and headed out the front door Management witnessed this and didn&#39;t ask the drunk, belligerent woman to leave, that was a bad move.

Where do you people come from? Have you ever experienced authentic Italian cuisine? Clearly no one posting about this place is in tune with the good shit. 

After hearing such great things about this supposedly Italian masterpiece, I drove out on a warm summer night to give it a try. 

Upon arrival I was questioning how great this place could be.. I mean seriously it&#39;s in downtown Lockport.. The middle of nowhere to most people but hey I&#39;m not one to judge a book by its cover. 

People do yourself a favor and don&#39;t make the hike out here. It&#39;s simply not worth it. Everything about this place screams mediocrity. Shitty wine list. Hardly any beer to be found. They seem to be living under a rock.  Italians know how to drink so get it together management. 

I started my evening off with an appetizer. Baked Clams which are my all time favorite! Whoever made these must have been baked out of their skull to serve such a hypocrisy. I never did find the clam underneath all that breading so I can&#39;t really comment on them. The stroke I nearly had from all the salt is something that Ill never forget though. It was like pouring a salt shaker in my mouth... Simply disgusting. 

Extremely disappointed I ordered a salad to hold me over until I decided on my main course. Went with almost a fool proof salad, the Caesar.  I took one look and wanted to puke. The salad was soaked in what looked like year old newmans dressing from my middle school cafeteria. 

Matters got worse when the spaghetti and meatballs came out. Obviously a sauce from a can and the noodles are not homemade.

This place is an embarrassment  to Italians."

I&#39;m not sure why this place has such good reviews.  Maybe I just have higher standards and expectations than everyone else in Lockport.  

Like others have said, the garlic knots were delivered to the table pretty quickly.  The only problem is that they were literally covered with what appeared and tasted like canned garlic.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love garlic, but why not use fresh garlic?  This was clearly the stuff you get by the giant jar at a warehouse club.  

I got the sausage, penne, and portobello mushrooms.  The dish was okay for the price and was hot, but again, had way too much of the canned garlic.  

My girlfriend got the stuffed shells.  The plate came with only 3 shells and covered in red sauce.  She said the food was barely room temperature and had hot spots meaning it was probably microwaved.  The shells looked and tasted like they came from Aldi (which isn&#39;t a terrible thing because Aldi has good stuffed shells, when they have them) but we expected more (quantity and quality) from a restaurant and for the price ($13.00).  

The worst part (and this is one of my biggest gripes) is the check  took about 10-15 minutes.  We got boxes for the food which were brought quickly.  One would think that if you were going to bring boxes, naturally you would bring the check with the boxes or immediately afterward.  Not here.  The waitress brought the boxes and then stood and chatted with another table for at least 10-15 minutes.  Not until I stood up and put my coat on did she bother to get the check."

First, it is a very small space and I would NEVER consider sitting at the table right next to the door, I mean really, why not just seat people right outside the bathroom doors.  HIGHLY UNDESIRABLE.

The food is okay.  I will admit that the homemade creamy Italian dressing was probably the best dressing I have ever had.  The fried ravioli was ample to share.  Our entrees were fine.  Were they on the caliber of Capri of Woodridge or Petey Z&#39;s in Naperville?  (Boy do we ever miss you guys)  Not even close.  And, since I had checked out the menu before making our reservations, I knew to bring my own pine nuts, thanks Petey Z. for that tip.

The peaches and cream gelato was outstanding.  It was creamy with great texture and one serving was too much for 2, but we tried to finish it.

Other notes:  make reservations, come early, and be prepared to NOT be able to hear the server or anyone NOT seated directly next to you.  The noise level is what cost this place more stars.  White table clothes and you might as well be sitting by yourself.  The tables are so close you feel like you are dining with total strangers and we, unfortunately, were seated next to a woman who had the most obnoxious laugh that was amplified by the acoustics.

Terrible house salad, Mediocre soup, impressive wine list, the fried calamari was acceptable. My main disappointment was the Eggplant Parmigiana. It was edible and that&#39;s all it was to it. The frozen kind I get at a store is a hundred times better. Will not be coming at this dud of an Italian restaurant."

I wanted to try it for awhile, but I was worried about being majorly let down. I love Italian food, and I don&#39;t do places like Olive Garden. I want LEGIT Italian food! The couple places I tried in Lockport  got awesome reviews, but didn&#39;t hit home with me when I tried them. I was totally pleased with Mama Onesta. 
                   Let&#39;s get down to 
                        Business!
       I brought my mom, and boyfriend here to check the place out as well. All of us loved the decor. Very cool and cozy inside!  We started out with appetizers- Sausage &amp; Peppers, and Escargot. The sausage &amp; peppers were awesome! My mom loved them so much she ordered her dinner  Sausage &amp; Peppers over pasta noodles. I thought that was kind of  boring to eat the same thing twice, but hey if she liked it then I love it. 
             My Escargot was good. The mushrooms went well with it.  I felt like such a pig because I wanted to dip all of my bread into that escargot gravy. The bread they bring you out is pretty good it&#39;s called garlic knots. They are coated in fresh garlic, and olive oil. I also tried them without the garlic and olive oil, and I think I might prefer them that way. 
             For dinner I  went for a pasta that I cannot remember the name of. #Duh What it was was lasagna noodles wrapped with ricotta cheese, spinach, and it looked like artichoke. There was melted cheese on top. It was ginormous!! It was about the size if two big cinnamon rolls!!  One of the pasta shells had Alfredo sauce on top, and the other had marinara. I don&#39;t know which one I liked better because the were both really awesome! 
           We got a choice of soup or salad, and I went for the soup. I tried a beer cheese soup. My dinner party looked at me like I was retarded for ordering it. OMG was it good. New Fav soup. I could&#39;ve slapped my mama who was sitting across from me it was so good. 
           There was no room for desert. Absolutely Not. The only way I could have managed that would&#39;ve been to make a restroom trip and pull a Mary Kate #Puke #HollywoodDiet My mom and my boyfriend loved their food! I think next time we will skip the appetizers   because the portions are so big! 

Until Next Time!!!!"

I want to say I had the best waitress in the world! Her name is Sara.
She took are orders on a timely manner. All are food came out hot. 
Never had to wait to re order a drink. My 2nd glass of wine didn&#39;t taste like the 1st glass. I told Sara. She went to the bartender , told him. He gave her the bottle of wine and she poured me another glass . She gave us separate checks. Always had a smile on her face. Never got flustered with the big loud group of us. 
I always recommend This restaurant . The food is very good. ( but the chef could cut back on the garlic, )
This is a nice place in a dump of a town!"

I&#39;m glad I finally did. We went late on Friday night and it was pretty empty (Easter weekend though,many people out of town). The place was clean and neat, nicely decorated but also not stuffy- it&#39;s comfortable. I&#39;m not really a wine drinker but I&#39;m happy with a good beer and you can get that here. I liked the garlic knots mostly because of the abundance of garlic on them. Had a couple chicken dishes and they were good, chicken was not dry and able to be cut with the fork alone. Salad may not be &#34;fancy&#34; but dressing is great (really need to grab some for home next time). Nothing was extravagant or incredible but it&#39;s a good solid meal. It&#39;s not the Olive Garden, Francesca&#39;s, or Maggiano&#39;s nonsense either so that&#39;s a huge plus. I&#39;m not too impressed by the hype you get at a lot of places though either and could care less about the &#34;innovative&#34; ability of a chef- if you can&#39;t lay a plate in front of me that has something on it that tastes good then I&#39;ve got no interest in whatever you&#39;re &#34;fusing&#34; together for &#34;dinner&#34;. I got a peek in the kitchen when leaving and I have no qualms about dining here- it was clean.  They do what they do well here, can&#39;t really say anything negative, it might be nothing fancy but it&#39;s good and I&#39;ll be back. It&#39;s great to have this option in Lockport and I hope it continues to thrive."

The Chicken Fiorintino and the veal zingara were both great, tender and tastey.  The olives on the veal dish were not pitted, which was a little surprising.  Great marinara!   Our server, Will, was attentive and brought our old school dirty Martinis with blue cheese olives without spilling a drop.  We did not try any of the appetizers because I saw the desserts and had to try the gelato, which are huge, and big enough to share.  Four stars for sure."

The food was excellent and the portions were ample.  There were too many things that I wanted to eat that made it difficult deciding what I was going to order.  The specials sounded sexy and the regular menu had me drooling.  The beer selection was decent and I&#39;m sure they sold wine too.  There were four of us out to eat that night and everyone greatly enjoyed their meal.  Not one complaint was to be had.

The service was something that needed to be mentioned as a separate note.  They waiter we had was excellent, he was friendly and not too in your face.  Was around often but not to the point of being annoying.  He even gave what felt like actual opinions on the food when asked.  He didn&#39;t just say that everything was good.  Our drinks never got empty other than of our own will and everything came out perfectly.

The prices were better than expected, it was actually cheaper than we had calculated in our heads between the beers and everything else.  While it&#39;s not the cheapest meal you&#39;ll eat, for a nice Italian restaurant it didn&#39;t clean out my wallet.  I came her on a suggestion from a few other people and will now be telling others to go here myself."

Look, I&#39;m not one of those people that get off on leaving a bad review but this time it&#39;s well deserved. The waitress was rude and condescending and I specifically asked for no cheese in or on my sauce and that wasn&#39;t honored either.

The food is great and the decor is exactly what you&#39;d want from a family owned Italian restaurant. My favorite part of the meal was the sausage, it was so fresh. Get something with sausage. If you&#39;re hesitant to visit because of reviews of the staff, ask for Marty. He was a fantastic server. Also, be sure to make a reservation so you won&#39;t have to wait.

From beginning to end, I don&#39;t have a single complaint about the food.  Which probably has you scratching your head as to why I gave it only 4 stars.  Unfortunately, the table service was less than stellar. Had our waitress done a better job I would have given 5 stars.  Also,  entering the restaurant is odd.  During the winter, you have to come in the back door and shuffle past customers waiting for the restrooms.  

When we arrived, they were quite busy but they prepared a table for us immediately and they seated us quickly.

Let&#39;s start with the bad service so we can end this on a good note, shall we?  Our server was Trish.  Although she was very friendly, she was not so timely and she would disappear for long periods of time.  Also, when we asked for more water, she brought wine.  Overall, the service was lacking.

The food itself was as good as it gets.  I ordered the Spicy Tilapia.  It came with shrimp, mushrooms, spinach and pasta. It was cooked in a wine sauce with red pepper flakes.  Very spicy but, good. The fish was cooked perfectly.  The portions are good size and you won&#39;t go home hungry.  My husband ordered the chicken that was featured on Chicago&#39;s Best.  The name escapes me but, holy heck was it delicious!  The chicken was so tender, you only needed a fork.  The creamy Italian dressing with the salad was really good too. I mean &#39;lick the plate&#39; good! The dinner rolls were drenched in oil but, it&#39;s just bread.  So, no worries.  We had the tiramisu for dessert and it was a nice ending to a great meal.

The prices were so reasonable, $67 for two entrees, dessert and two glasses of wine.  

I really can&#39;t wait to go back and try it again."

They were perfectly soft inside and crisp on the outside. If the food is anything like these buns, it&#39;s a sure win. My friend and I ordered and split the meatball sandwich and eggplant parmesan sandwich. The meatballs were lacking a seasoned flavor, but were pretty meaty tasting. It was good quality meat in the meatballs. The eggplant had more flavor, probably due to the breading. The red sauce on both sandwiches is absolutely yummy. I would say that is what made the sandwich. The side of pasta was cooked well, but I thought it had too much oregano in the sauce. It was obviously different than what were on the sandwiches. The meatballs could have had some of that flavor. The buns were good. All the bread was amazing. All in all, not bad for $9 a sandwich. Service was good and friendly. We started out being the only table and left with only 2 other tables in there."

The portions are larger with more sauce.  I ordered the chicken with marinara but the spicier version.  It was so yummy for a cold winters day.     We love this place.

The menu is easy to read and not like the huge size menus at other restaurants. Many items on the menu to choose from. For starters we went with the fried calamari and I had the veal parmesan for my entree, which was really good. Portions are big, so bring your appetite. For dessert we had tiramisu, a cannoli, and an amaretto cake which was really delicious. That was the first time I had amaretto cake and I&#39;m mad at myself for not trying that much sooner.

The restaurant staff was really friendly and was on top of things. Never had to wait until the glass was empty to get another drink.

Make sure you get a reservation on the weekends because it fills up, but if you walk in, just grab a drink at the bar and I&#39;m sure they will squeeze you in without too much of a wait.

We will definitely go back to Mama Onesta&#39;s and make this a regular stop."

(How I got there in a terrifying Midwest T-storm is too long a story to relate here.) 

Your meal at Mamma starts moments after your hit the chair with a bowl of freshly warmed rolls drenched in olive oil and bristling with chunks of fresh, diced garlic.  With a bottle or two of the restaurant&#39;s reasonably priced wine, you could stop right there.  

But I went for the politically incorrect veal parmigiana, which is topped with a thick, smoky, clearly home made tomato sauce - the best I have tasted since the last time my wife made red sauce.

Our party tried a variety of pasta dishes, which were freshly executed and more than abundant.  As my brother in law correctly noted, the sauce on every dish is unique - a sign that Mamma takes pains to get it right.  

Any one portion would have been enough to serve a party of four at a fancy eatery in downtown Chicago, New York or San Francisco.  And the prices are cheaper than an appetizer at most places that promise lots more and deliver lots less.  

Go there before the premiere of the Johnny Depp remake of &#34;Public Enemy,&#34; which was filmed in part at this restaurant.  When the place becomes a tourist destination, Mamma may be hard pressed to sustain its authenticity and its charm."

We had 26 people, and everything went well. We selected the chicken florentine for the meat course, the penne pasta with red peppers and sausage for the 1st pasta course, and 4-cheese ravioli for the second. A sumptious salad was served with warm garlic rolls. All were delicious.The food was served family style which complemented the decor and cozy ambiance. The owner, Frank DeGrassi, was very accommodating, and his staff gave great service. We have been there twice, and we intend to go back.

My fiance and I were in the Joliet area (where our wedding will be in several months) and were looking for a rehearsal dinner spot.  Well, we found nothing in Joliet but wandered up to Lockport.  Mamma Onesti&#39;s caught our attention as a cute little spot in the downtown area, so we decided to go in.  Frank, the owner, was extremely helpful and showed us the options we could have for our dinner party.  We were very satisfied with the quaint, cozy, Italian ambiance in the restaurant and the great menu prices.  We decided to stay to try out some of the food before deciding on booking our dinner there.  We each ordered a dish and Frank brought out a &#39;sample&#39; of about everything else on the banquet menu!  I almost cried!!  I LOVE Italian food, and especially good quality Italian food, which this was.  I am so excited to go back to Mamma Onesti&#39;s.

The walls are painted orange and the ceiling is painted black.  It was a bit halloweenesque, but I decided to look past and concentrate on the food.
They bring out rolls to begin with.  The rolls we got were cold and were soaked in oil and jarred, chopped garlic.  Eh, I&#39;ll pass.
I did get a salad and hubby got the minestrone.  I got the Italian dressing and it was the best creamy Italian dressing I&#39;ve ever tasted.  It made up for the cold, soggy rolls.
I got the spaghetti and meatballs and he got the chicken fiorentina.  They were both decent, but not amazing.  The meat in the meatballs were overly ground up and the seasoning was non-existent.  The chicken fiorentina was definitely a lot more flavorful than the meatballs.
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back anytime soon, but it was worth a shot."

They served a complimentary bowl full of bakery goods (maybe a bit of overkill, but it IS a bakery as well as restaurant). I ate a breadstick and it was crusty and moist as it should be. Great flavor.

I had the steak skillet and my brother the Gypsy (ham) skillet. Meat with hash browns, onions, peppers and American and Swiss cheese with two eggs atop. They also came with choice of toast or pancakes(?!).

The whole damn meal was excellent. The steak was tender and flavorful, the hash browns crisp, the onions between fried and caramelized, the eggs perfectly cooked to order (over medium for me).
There is a reason they advertise their pancakes. They are moist and tasty and rather substantial.

They even have a tiny bar in the corner for their lunch and dinner crowds (open &#39;til 10).

I got nothing bad to say about my experience. Maybe they could get slightly larger coffee mugs. Oh, and their coffee was good."

Seating has booths along the windows and includes a handful of diner-style stools along the counter.  Definitely worth a visit to experience a different style of dining compared to the franchised operations.

The soup was fine, the bread sort of stale, and wonder how many times it was &#34;handled&#34; during the day.
There were several wait staff. Not that friendly, but efficient. 
The problem was the meal itself. The meat dish was dry and bland. Like breaded cardboard. The mash potatoes and vegetables were cold. I immediately wish I had ordered a breakfast, My son&#39;s entre has similar issues, and we joked about being sick on the way home. The dessert was a plus, but at that point, considering that was a $40 meal, was not the icing on the cake. 
Bottom line, if you are a regular and know what works for you, great. We had a bad experience and will not likely return, Was hoping for a great &#34;home-cooked&#34; meal which was not delivered."

My last visit was for mothers day. I ordered the roast sirloin of beef. I&#39;m not a butcher and would not notice the difference between that and London broil. Well when the bill arrived London broil was on the bill. While London broil is not very much more expensive it was a higher price, and not what I had ordered. 

I went to the register to bring it to their attention. The question I was met with was did I eat it? Well, yes, I ordered beef and I ate beef. Which cut I recieved I was now unsure. 

I was told London broil was what was on my bill so therefore London broil was what I ate. He was rude and stated if it makes such a big difference he would charge me for the sirloin...

My point being, it was not about the difference in pay. It was that what was on the bill was not what I had ordered. But to have a customer walk out the door feeling down about their experience is as I see it, unforgivable.

I was excited that they had mushroom soup today.  When I received it, it seemed like it was a bowl of thick cream.  I would not have known it was mushroom soup except for a couple mushroom slices at the bottom.  That is okay.  Maybe just a bad soup day.

Once I walked inside I was fairly shortly thereafter seated. The there are a handful of very small tables and I was seated at one. I quickly looked over the breakfast menu in an attempt to zero in on exactly what I wanted. I decided to go for a Gypsy skillet (a fairly popular item as it appears on many pancake houses menus) and soon enough had placed my order.

What made this visit rather interesting were the senior citizens siting next to me, first expressing their disappointment that they did not receive a bread basket and at the size of the food cup. But then they commented at the entrees they received, &#34;I wish Omega were still open&#34; one of them exclaimed. I&#39;m pretty certain they were referring to the now closed Omega Restaurant in Downers Grove. As I heard their complaining about their meals I waited eagerly for my breakfast to arrive. 

When my food arrived I was somewhat disappointed by the size of my skillet. There was a lot of egg compared to other places, but it seems like it was overall less food than most places, as I snapped a photo and dug in I noticed it was very bland. A lot of other pancake houses add extra seasoning to their eggs, to the potatoes at the bottom to provide a richer flavor. This was nowhere to be found on this skillet. The potato at the bottom was particularly disappointing as it was no on way crispy and was mostly made up of white soft potato fluff. 

The pancakes I got with this weren&#39;t any better than the skillet, and while the syrup was thick it wasn&#39;t super sweet or flavorful. These pancakes were average at best and not enough to salvage the sub-par skillet. 

Overall I was not in any way impressed with Quincy&#39;s, while my food wasn&#39;t horrible I wouldn&#39;t be tempted to visit again. I&#39;d recommend avoiding this place as many better options exist."

Our server was rockin&#39;. Totally sweet, working her ass off serving chumps and the elderly breakfast for mere pennies. 

My bf and I were getting a late start after a slight drinking binge and chose to do a 2:30 breakfast. The food was was pretty damn good... I mean, I cleaned my plate. Was it Egg Harbor quality? No. But was it Egg Harbor prices? No! It was super cheap, and damn good diner food. 

I can understand not liking the place based on pastries per the previous review but I also can&#39;t imagine going here to pick out a wedding cake unless I was a big fan of the trucking industry either.

I could write more reviews on where not to eat then where to eat but this one is not on the list. The only thing I would say that is not good is the bread and rolls in your bread basket. The quality is just not there. Dry and not fresh...change vendors on this. Hey Qunicy&#39;s we need a restaurant like you in Schaumburg/Bloomingdale...in fact Bloomingdales  does not have any good family restaurants. Dino&#39;s in Bloomingdales is consistently busy and it is the worst food I ever tasted...if you opened out there you would do quadruple their business."

Not to say that I make bad pancakes, but it&#39;s nicer to have someone else do it, and then, you know, I get hash browns too. 

And I liked Quincy&#39;s when I went for the first time recently. For one thing, they break from the pack of pancake places by NOT having the &#34;big as your head&#34; pancakes, which tends to make pancakes tough. 

Quincy&#39;s pancakes were smaller, with a light, more delicate texture. No rubbery mouse pads, these. 

I have yet to eat a non-breakfast meal here but they seem to be a &#34;Big Boy&#34; simulacrum in that they have lots of choices, as well as the pie/cake case in the front, and the lifetime waitresses who are efficient and know how to balance the room. 

We&#39;ll be back. Because of the pancakes."

Wife has their hobo skillet (two cheeses over hash browns, poached eggs, and pancakes) and I had their french toast with bananas.  The food was brought out rather quickly, but everything seemed and tasted like it had all been sitting for a bit.  The french toast was dry and chewy could have used more eggs.

The service has always been nice and friendly.  But last night our waitress went above and beyond.  We had our 3-year old granddaughter who was almost in tears about her pet frog escaping.  In the middle of a crowded dinner hour our waitress took the time to listen to the story.  After dinner she was so kind to surprise our little one with a &#34;chocolate frog&#34; from the dessert case and told her maybe that would make her feel a little better!

Our waitress looked like she was about to pop (must have been 9 months pregnant), so we basically served ourselves the whole night which wasn&#39;t a problem.  She hardly came around to check on us, but when she did she seemed so annoyed that we were still there (think her shift had ended already).  The one good thing I can say is that they have a huge selection on the menu.  I was really craving a gyros sandwich.  Not bad.  The fried chicken looked good, but apparently had no seasoning on it, according to my mother-in-law.

I guess they&#39;re known for their cakes.  So I went with my future mother-in-law to try cakes for my bridal shower.  They&#39;ve got a small bakery area set up where people can just order a whole cake or by the slice.  Their selection ranges from strawberry shortcake to the Quincy&#39;s special (just a mix of a chocolate cake &amp; strawberry shortcake).  We tried the Quincy special...not so special-dry &amp; too sweet.  Also had the carrot cake, not too bad, not too sweet, light cream cheese frosting but the cake was a bit too heavy for me.

So overall, service is poor &amp; the food follows suit.  Just go to Denny&#39;s."

I order a tuna melt deluxe (which I assumed came with soup because the waitress asked me what soup I wanted). I had to ask three times for the soup and it never came. I did get the bill and was billed for the deluxe. The waitress then told me that I didn&#39;t get soup. Needless to say I paid $9.50 for a tuna melt sandwich. I haven&#39;t been back since.

Offering a large menu of different comfort foods at great prices this is one of my favorite restaurants to go on a normal basis. If you are looking for fine dinning by all means you are at the wrong restaurant. Quincy&#39;s is the place to go for burgers and the such. If you are into Potato Skins they are great here but be ready to take leftovers home because the portion size on them is huge. The wait staff and host here are always very friendly and I never feel rushed when I dine here. They are great on drink refills also. The bakery is also worth mentioning as they have a great cheesecake and bread basket here as well.

This is the only restaurant at which I will order a turkey dinner because it taste just like homemade.  Besides the turkey dinner (served on Tuesdays and Sundays) I also enjoy their soups, salads, the Athenian chicken breast dinner, and a variety of sandwiches.  Once I find a meal I like, I tend to keep ordering the same thing.  My fiance is more adventurous and his favorite meals at Quincy&#39;s are the Grecian Pork Chops, Quincy Burger, and he said the Gyros are the best he&#39;s had in the area!  And, dessert is complimentary with most meals.  They bake and sell their own bread, rolls, and delicious cakes, pies, and other desserts.  My favorite dessert is their cheesecake.  In the fall, try their pumpkin cheesecake - it tastes even better than the pumpkin cheesecake I had at The Cheesecake Factory!

1. The menu is very extensive, as is the buffet.
       - huge selection of apps / small plates and lite / regular dinner portions, all generous.
2. Anthony, who has been there every time my wife and I have gone ( ~ 6 times) will spend
 time answering questions, making suggestions, and adjusting the heat if desired. He is a great person to help people trying to learn the joy and savor of spices new to us.
3. Decent quality wine selection.
4. The spices and ingredients are unique  for western European descendants like us.
Do not assume the location in Naperville Plaza (always plenty of free parking) takes away anything from the fine food, service and value.

My whole group loved the food &amp; will be returning.  Try the biryani, the flavoured naan or, of course, the mughlai malai kofta. Our server, Anthony, was just the right amount of attentive.

PROS: Pick your own level of spicy/hot, from nothing to WHAP. Great selection of choices. Lots of vegetarian options.  Easy parking. Great service. Biryani is buy one, take one home with huge portions.
CONS: Ambience is just OK. 
OVERALL: There are numerous Indian options in the Naperville / Aurora area, but this is now my favorite. Yes, it is a strip mall location, but the food and service were the best I&#39;ve had in the suburbs and many Chicago places. I&#39;m so pleased they do take-out!

Though the strip mall exterior is not all that inviting, the restaurant is quite nice inside. The napkins, glasses, and place settings made us feel like we were at a wedding.

We were expecting a lunch buffet, but it turns out that&#39;s only offered on weekends. Sometimes it&#39;s nice to order from the menu though, so we didn&#39;t mind changing gears. I especially like that their dishes are served with rice. Something about paying $4 or $5 extra for rice every time we go out for Indian food is bothersome, and I really can&#39;t say that this place built the cost of rice into its dishes, since I&#39;d say prices are on par with similar places.

The tandoori chicken was delicious and well seasoned, and my son and I enjoyed the butter paneer. The naan was just okay...more like pizza crust than the buttery goodness I&#39;ve had elsewhere, but it did its job as a vehicle for extra sauce.

Moreover when I call the restaurant to understand if that is the standard of pieces we should expect,thay say it should vary from 3-5 pieces depending on size and do not believe on my facts.

So please be aware of oder in goat biriyani at the place and if so pls validate."

I hail from the land of Biryanis so for me Biryani has to be perfect. This means, the chicken should be juicy from inside with a fried glaze from the outside. The rice should not be overcooked or undercooked, but flaky. And achieving this perfectness isnt easy!

Moving on, Biryani needs to be spicy but not overpowering with the spices. And I personally like my Biryani to de dry and not oily. Now, Biryani is literally Chicken cooked with rice and you may be wondering why I am getting so specific about the consistency of the rice and chicken, and the spice level- well, these are the only two things that separate a great biryani from a not so great Biryani!

So, 5 stars for the chicken biryani. Its just Perfect! My husband loves goat biryani but I cant speak to that as I haven&#39;t tried it yet.

I also love their yogurt rice(stunner), veg pakoda, fish appetizer (forget the name, but it was on the buffet), and chapattis (yes, yes! they are good. I ordered the no-oil chapatis)

Deccan spice is a fantastic restaurant for Indian food. Their buffet carries a variety of options.
My 2 cents: Drop items like uttapam, idly, hot and sour soup and chat. Not that they are bad, but  for a restaurant that excels in Biryani, make sure that people dont get blurred by the array of offerings and pick something else over Biryani. This may especially be true for first time tryers.

Good Luck and please preserve the awesomeness!"

Been to Deccan Spice twice, once for weekend lunch buffet: big selection of food at $12.99 (?); the other time for dinner. 

You can find biryani in every Indian restaurant but I heard Hyderabadi biryani is most famous and Deccan Spice is supposed to feature Hyderabadi cuisine. The fish biryani I had here are spiced very differently from the Indian restaurant across street from my house, and spicier too. Both my friend and I liked it, and the portion is huge. 

The chicken curry we had was a little too mild on its own (we requested mild I think?), but a welcomed relief from the spicy biryani. 

Service was good, ambience nice.

After waiting an hour and a half for delivery, I called the restaurant, who advised me that they left our food outside our door and didn&#39;t try to ring the bell. I walked outside. No food. I called the restaurant back and said there was no food outside. The person I spoke with, Anthony, then began to get very loud and demanded that I was wrong, the food was outside our apartment building door, and the driver took a photo of it to prove me wrong. Despite me standing outside and no food in sight, he just rambled on and on about our (nonexistent) &#34;happy holidays!&#34; sign and that he&#39;s certain his driver will prove me wrong.

I called grubhub livid about this situation. They called the restaurant, who advised they&#39;d sent the driver back out to show me where the food is. It&#39;s freezing cold outside. I wait. Finally, a lovely woman comes walking up to me with her dog - to advise she found a bag of food at her door, checked the receipt, and brought it to me. I live at 519. She lives at 503.

I called grubhub back to demand some sort of action for this $100 bag of ice cold food left errantly at the wrong house. They call the restaurant and Anthony advises them that they&#39;ve already spoken to my husband (whose number they don&#39;t have and who never called them?) and he said everything was fine so I shouldn&#39;t get a refund. I advised that was a 100% complete fabrication. They called the restaurant again who finally conceded and agreed to refund me the total (almost $100!) of the cold, abandoned food. 

The way I was screamed at by the restaurant, their driver&#39;s willingness to leave food at the wrong address, and not to buzz or call when it arrived, and their subsequent lies to me and grubhub are all reprehensible.

He suggested Deccan Spice in Naperville, which was close to both of us.  I was hungry for Indian food anyway.  I was hoping for a good experience since this is so convenient when we visit in the area.  I was not disappointed and would say it was better than a couple of other comparable Naperville places where I have eaten.

We started with Chili Shrimp.  These had decent flavor and some heat.  I liked them OK, but would look for another appetizer.  The Shrimp get lost in the spices.  We ended up with two chicken dishes to share.  The Chettinad Chicken Curry was very good, cooked with an array of traditional spices and some tomato.  The masala included a little cinnamon.  I would certainly order this again.  Our other choice was the Andhra Chicken Korma.  It was a typical Korma dish, creamy and mild.  We liked them both but agreed that the Chettinad Curry was more interesting.  Neither was particularly spicy hot, but I&#39;m thinking the Chettinad would be good to order on the spicier side.  They have a very nice selection of breads.  Our order of Butter Naan was delivered as Plain Naan, but was fine to scoop up the curry with.

Our service was very helpful and attentive.  The restaurant is pleasant and nicely appointed.  I look forward to a return visit with a larger group so that we can sample a broader range."

Main course was egg curry with naan. Now, I have never been impressed with any egg curry I have had in the Chicagoland area but this egg curry definitely stood out. Not only that, they have many varieties of Egg dishes, which is awesome. Can&#39;t wait to try them on our next visit.

Mastery of both South and North Indian cuisine. The sambaar and dosas were delicioso. We went for the lunch buffet and were blown away by how great it was. These guys aren&#39;t phoning it in - they care and ask if you need anything during your meal. I was definitely surprised by the low key atmosphere, but the place is new and word probably hasn&#39;t gotten out yet. As an Indian, I hate most &#34;Indian&#34; restaurants that cater to the lcd dishes and truly appreciate the few masters of their craft who put out amazing new dishes that are inspired and exciting. I don&#39;t eat out in the burbs very often, but will def be going back to this place."

We decided to try Deccan Spice as they boast they have the best Biryani in town. Tried the Goat Dum Biryani today and it was NOT GOOD for the following reasons:

- not flavorful like Biryani is supposed to be
- barely any meat on the bones. I asked for extra meat when ordering but was assured there is plenty of meat in the regular order. NOT TRUE. Only 5 small pieces of goat and each one was 80-90% bone. Deccan needs to either add more pieces to each order or use better pieces of meat
- The meat is DRY does not fall off the bone like some other better Biryani places.

Can&#39;t speak for any other dishes but based on this experience I will NOT be returning to this place again. Definitely NOT worth the $15 price tag! If you are a true fan of Biryani do not order the goat.  Chicken is better."

Didn&#39;t  really know what we were doing as far as Indian food but hey, it&#39;s something different than the same lame late night delivery choices. Let&#39;s do it! Ordered fairly randomly except for Samosas. We knew what those were. We got Tandoori Chicken, Schezwan Fried Rice w Chicken, Onion Pakora, and Samosas. The Onion Pakora is basically an Indian version of an onion ring, but with more thought put into it. They were good but not outstanding. Everything else was amazing! The rice is highly recommended.

Need to specify &#34;mild&#34; otherwise super spicy!  Nice little hidden spot in Gartner plaza.  Only critique would be that almost all the meat dishes contain nuts.  They use a cashew paste to help thicken the sauces.   Those with nut allergies should be aware of this when they order.  

I had to amend my review of this place from 5 stars to 4 stars to 2 stars.  While the food is very good, I am extremely disappointed with how they handled nut allergies.   My son is allergic to nuts - but not severely... he can generally eat food when the labels say &#34;contain traces&#34; and we are not a nut-free home.   When I ordered food from here I was told that cashew paste was used as a thickener in most dishes.   I asked the manager what foods did not have nuts (as long as nuts were not an ingredient in the dish, he can eat it).   I was told that the vegetable curry and the egg biryani that I ordered were nut-free and he could safely consume.  

Fast forward 2 hours and we are in the emergency room with my son having an anaphylactic reaction to the egg biryani.  I further looked at the dish and there were whole cashews and other nuts mixed in with the rice (although it was very hard to tell bc the rice was all different colors and there were other veggies mixed in).  Needless to say my son got very sick and we ended up at the hospital for several hours while he was treated.  

It was extremely disappointing how this restaurant handled this.  I would have greatly preferred if they told me that he could not safely eat ANYTHING because they weren&#39;t sure about the contents rather than assure me that dishes did not have nuts when in fact they did.  They might be better served to have a more detailed description of the food - including highlighting those that have nuts so that they can be avoided if necessary.  

As much as we enjoyed the food here, we will most likely not return."

In particular what has always impressed me is how Indian cuisine can take vegetables I don&#39;t like and make them taste heavenly and yet still be healthy.  This place is about as good as Indian gets, my wife and I are regulars here.  A very nice variety, both menu and buffet, and especially interesting and unusual vegetarian items on the buffet.  The buffet is a great deal at $12.99, with some things I&#39;ve never seen on a buffet anywhere else, including bhindi pulusu (okra in tamarind gravy, highly recommended) and saag vegetables (mixed vegetables with spinach) as well as the usual tourist favorites tandoori chicken, murgh makhani, paneer makhani, tikka masala, biryani and other similar. (The reviewer who thought the buffet was expensive and not a lot of variety should probably stick to Burger King).  The dishes are spiced appropriately spicy, though they&#39;ll ask how spicy it should be, and the staff is appropriately attentive without being pushy.  The portions are nicely sized.  This isn&#39;t the rich touristy kind of Indian but the healthier kind, lighter on ghee and relying more on the subtlety of spicing, which is as I think it should be.  

Anthony, who seems to be the manager, deserves special mention.  He is very personable and helpful in explaining the menu and buffet items. I&#39;ve learned a lot about Indian cuisine from him already and hope to more in the near future.

They had four types of Italian ice available: lemon, banana, raspberry and orange. We got a traditional lemon and raspberry in a medium. The total was $10 which was surprising since we were recently at Jonnie&#39;s Red Hot in Melrose Park and for two large is was $6. And I thought Jonnie&#39;s could have charged more for their ice cause it was that great. 

Lemon ice was kinda weak. I didn&#39;t like that it had small chucks of lemon instead of large wedges. The raspberry was amazing. It was so refreshing. If it was a hot sunny day instead of a stormy day it would have been 10X more awesome.

Decided to check out Teddy&#39;s Red Hots about an hour before they closed because we did a search for gyros.  To note: they do NOT serve gyros at this location... =(

But while we were there, figured we should get some dinner nonetheless.  Ordered up an Italian beef and a hot dog.  

Italian beef:  Tasty, and one of the better non-chain beefs in the burbs.  Didn&#39;t have any peppers with it, and the beef was a bit salty... not a homerun, but a decent double.

Hot dog, Chicago style:  A good dog, and an enjoyable   The dog is done right with the correct toppings for a Chicago style, but nothing truly stands out about the dog.  Solid Chicago dog.

Strawberry shake:  Strangely the most expensive item on the menu, and since it&#39;s served with a larger straw, we polished this before we even made it home.  It&#39;s a decent shake, no real fresh strawberries or anything, but the flavor isn&#39;t overly sweet (like those who pump way too much syrup) so it was enjoyable.

For these three items (no fries mind you), we paid about $18.  The food was solid, the price point is a bit high for my personal tastes.  

Verdict:  A-OK.  That&#39;s it.  Really."

Outrageous!  It&#39;s getting to the point where I can&#39;t afford to eat there anymore.

The food is still outstanding as usual, so I&#39;ll let Teddy&#39;s keep the 4-star rating.  But I wanted to post an update to give people an idea of how expensive this place is.

If the prices were more reasonable I&#39;d give Teddy&#39;s 5 stars, no doubt.

PS: Why are some reviewers in here saying that Teddy&#39;s &#34;doesn&#39;t put celery salt and sport peppers on their hot dogs&#34;?   They do, it&#39;s just by request and the cashier almost always asks if you want that stuff on your hot dog.

Food was good.  In fact, a great hotdog!  I didn&#39;t even mind that they don&#39;t wrap the dogs up with the fries (the best sign of a hot dog jernt that knows it&#39;s stuff).  

Anyhoo, great dog, fries were crinkle cut, but stil good.  Where my 2-star rating comes from is the price.  Jesus Christ Zombies!!!  2 hot dogs, small fry, small Pepsi....ready?  $10.71!!!

What the Jesus, Mary and Joseph kind of overhead do you have where you got to charge $10 for a couple of hotdogs? 

Oh, and the seemingly &#39;couldnt care less&#39; attitude of the guy behind the register didn&#39;t help with the rating....older guy, grease-backed hair, gold rings...I&#39;m guessing the owner.

Dear Owner, we lovers of a true Chicago style hot dog don&#39;t need the bank of  LG high def screens displaying the menu...we need to get a couple dogs, fry, and a pop for under $10....well under!  You charge $2.79 for a hot dog, wrap a fistfull of fries around it!  Don&#39;t charge me another $2.19 for a fry that took one $0.50 potato to produce.

When I ordered 2 Chicago dogs, the greased back hair guy behind the register asked me if I wanted everything on them...   After me getting confused about what that meant i ask him &#34;What everything mean?  I don&#39;t want everything,  I just want what is supposed to be on a Chicago dog.&#34;  He then points to the 8 LCD TV displays and says its up there.  It took a while to find where it was, and it wasn&#39;t everything available to put on a hot dog, so I tell him the ingredients I want.  Horrible service.

When I got my food, I was also curious as to what kind of dogs they used as I didn&#39;t see any signs around saying Vienna or anything of the sort.  They say they are, but the taste wasn&#39;t really what I am used to.  The buns also don&#39;t have the poppy seeds which was a disappointment as well.

Overall, these are below mediocre dogs.  The fries were decent, just like Portillo&#39;s.  Fresh cut would be much better.  Price of this was ridiculously overpriced.  About $11 for 2 dogs and a cheese fry.  I had water to drink.

I will not be going back here for hot dogs that is for sure.

There are better places for dogs.  The places that come to mind are Portillo&#39;s, Scooby&#39;s and Beef Villa.

It has a small attached parking lot, but a decent amount of seating and is an overall clean restaurant. In going into Teddys I decided to try the hot dog with everything, fries and a drink. 

The hot dogs I received came on a regular non-poppy seed bun. The bun was fairly soft but did not appear to be steamed. The hot dog itself was skinless and slightly longer than a normal Chicago style hot dog, it was well heated and had a good flavor. The pickle used was a thinner pickle spear, it was a bit on the sour side but fortunately not too thick. The tomato chunks used here however were on the thick side and were a bit too much for the hot dog. The sport peppers used weren&#39;t too hot and added a nice flavor. I didn&#39;t detect any celery salt on the dog, the onions were applied well and I liked the fairly sparring usage of mustard and relish.

The fries included were of the crinkle cut variety. They had nice crisp outsides and soft insides, they weren&#39;t too greasy but were a little light on salt. Overall these were decent fries but something extra (cup of cheese) might be needed to enhance the flavor here as without the salt they were a tad bland. 

Overall I liked both my hot dog and fries at Teddy&#39;s Red Hots. I&#39;d recommend stopping by if you&#39;re in the area, it&#39;s  by no means the best hot dog you&#39;ll find in Chicagoland, but it&#39;s better than average."

The cheesy beef is great with sweet peppers, and the red hots and hamburgers are very good as well.  The beef is high quality, bursting with flavor, and they put a generous amount of au jus on the sandwich.  It is sliced very thin, and practically melts in your mouth.

The prices are on the high side, but are worth it as most of the food items are much better than competing places.  But if you enjoy a good beef sandwich, definitely check this place out."

I&#39;ve been to the other Teddy&#39;s in Darien, which is very good as well, but I was way more impressed at this Teddy&#39;s.  The service is friendly and excellent.  The pretzel buns are delicious.  And the homemade soup is so good.  The first time I went there they had beef vegetable soup and I decided to pass because I&#39;m not a huge fan of beef soup.  But they gave me and my girlfriend a sample and it was so good that I had to get some.  The fresh ingredients make a difference.  Had the Chicken and rice soup yesterday and I was very satisfied.

This place is one I&#39;ve passed many times over the years. From time to time, I would stop in and grab a bite. So I decided to return today (Groupon and all) for another visit. The place is small but not cramped (there are about 10 tables and a counter near by). 

Now this review has a mixed bag.
The bad or disappointing- price. Now I understand about inflation and business costs but $6.99 for a char cheese steakburger ($7.99 if you want a double; almost $2.00 more than most of the competeition)? $2.50 for a regular onion ring? The &#34;P&#34; word is also the drink of the house w/ Dr Pepper being the other alternative. A bit more expensive than I last recalled. Add onion rings or fries and a drink and we&#39;re easily over $11.00. 

The good:
- The counter person was VERY polite.The food came was ready pretty fast as well. In fact, the staff were all very considerate.
- The polish sausage was very good (from what I recall). It&#39;s about 1/3 lbs (pretty good sized and plenty of onions if you want them). 
- Onions rings were nice, hot and crisp.
- The char cheese steakburger was very good but a bit more expensive than I would hope. So this review will be the first that has 2 part rating. 
Burger Rating for taste= Monstrous-Beast (4 1/2), Burger Rating for the price= trollish-mortal. 

Food was very good but the price was a bit more expensive than I expected. Specials rotate on a daily basis. Dial the prices back a bit and we&#39;ll talk."

This place has one of the only Italian Beefs that I think even come close to Portillo&#39;s and in the summer the Italian Ice can&#39;t be beat.  However, I do think that it is overpriced.  Other area hot dog stands are much cheaper. Not to mention that everything is ala carte here and you will pay extra for just about everything (peppers, cheese, etc).  But when you really want a good Italian Beef or a good hot dog, Teddy&#39;s is going to beat anyone else in the area in flavor."

I have been going for about 15 years. I you want good food that is always good every time then go check them out. The cheese burgers are so delicious, along with the hot dogs. The cheese fries is just icing to the cake. They have really good milkshakes but don&#39;t get them because they are so good that you will be addicted. My favorite is the strawberry banana! The owner always asks if you were your food is good, which it always is. You just have to go try it, but be careful because it is that good."

The place isn&#39;t much to look at but that brings some character to it and you don&#39;t come here for the atmosphere...  You come here for the food!

Teddys has all the classics from a red hots joint on the menu including hot dogs, char burgers, nuggets, polish, and fries.  For some sweetness after have a home made Italian ice.

All in all, this place has perhaps the best food of its kind in the western burbs and I would argue even in the Chicagoland area.  It is worth more than a try.

Next, the place on first appearance has some old time charm like a 50s diner. However the place is pretty beat up with wobbly tables and lumpy seats.

Abrupt service. . .too be expected? They were not patient with my Hoosier parents.  Italian beef sandwich. . .tasted good. Hot dog is nothing special.  I mean really? If you can&#39;t grind your own dogs why serve em? Fries were a-ok.

I&#39;m a simple gal and my boyfriend knows that. It&#39;s a small little place on the corner of 63rd. I&#39;ve had their hot dogs a couple of times and have never been disappointed. There isn&#39;t much seating, but people mainly come here for take out, not really to sit down. Though they do have nice coat hooks at every booth for those that want to check out the ambiance. One of the things that sets Teddy&#39;s apart from the rest is that they have Italian ice. Only one place will ever make the best (Mario&#39;s on Taylor St. See review), but since that place is only open during the summer, I&#39;ll give Teddy&#39;s the runner-up spot. They have it all year round and have a few different flavors. I&#39;ll always go lemon though. I do like that they have those lemon pieces in there. Gives the ice a little more zest and pop to it. If you&#39;re in the area, this is a good stop for a quick bite, or a hot date."

He&#39;d wistfully say, &#34;On a poppyseed bun with quartered tomatoes, sport peppers, relish, onions, and, mmm, celery salt.  Ohhhh celery salt.&#34;  And then he&#39;d do that thing where he kisses his index and middle fingers together with his thumb.

The hot dog wasn&#39;t the best hot dog I&#39;ve ever had in my life, but the toppings were great.  Be forewarned that Teddy&#39;s Red Hots only has regular buns and doesn&#39;t have celery salt, so D and his dad bring their own.  Ohhh celery salt.

The fries are also pretty decent, but the reason for the four stars is the Italian Ice.  Typically in the Bay Area, I&#39;m hesitant to order one because it&#39;s a glorified SnoCone.  This Italian Ice was anything but.  Wow.  We had the black cherry flavor; the ice was finely crushed and mixed with real cherries and tons of sugar so it was more like sorbet.  The flavor was spot on and I almost ate the entire order by myself, swatting away D&#39;s spoon while battling frequent brain freezes."

1) I&#39;ve passed the place, and the rest of the drive home consists of me realizing that I&#39;m NOT going to be eating one of their great hotdogs when I get home

2) I&#39;ve gone in, GOT one of those great hotdogs (and a small french fry and a melted cheese cup), and I&#39;ll have to work on the treadmill the next day a little bit harder.

Parking is good enough. Not a whole lot, but every spot is within 30 seconds of the front door.

Inside, the place is clean enough, and the guy at the register is always nice and friendly. My order rarely makes me wait more than a couple minutes, and the price is solid for what I&#39;m getting.

The taste of the stuff? Well, I love their hotdogs. Juicy, tasty, although a little small (I don&#39;t know if they really ARE small, or I just want to eat more. It could be either.). Their fries are decent enough, and their portions are very large in that respect.

Bottom line: a great place to grab a great hotdog at a good price."

They make an excellent hot dog or cheesy beef.  The Italian ice is the best in the burbs, (the lemon and black cherry surpassed all the flavors they offer in my book.) It is not the Italian ice that crappy restaurants hand out in paper cups...It is clearly home made with chunks of the fruit inside of it. The restaurant has little retro booths, tiles, décor and a jukebox.  They also used to have a sit down pac-man machine which would give them a 4 star review all by itself in my opinion.  The restaurant is normally a 6 out of 10 as far as clean goes, but that&#39;s what you get when you go to a red hots place for a hot dog.   They do have bathrooms, and those are also probably a 6 out 10.  The same few guys have been working the cash register for about the last 20 years....they are friendly but look like the kind of guys you wouldn&#39;t want to fight in an alley.  

The must order @ Teddy&#39;s you ask? The cheese fries.  They are perfect.  Crinkle cut fries and the perfect cheese dipping sauce.  The large fries are enough to feed a family of 3 or 4.   Don&#39;t forget to get an Italian ice!!!!"

My husband and I tried it because we live two minutes away, and we were so happy when it turned out to be good because Chinese restaurants can really be hit or miss. This is a hit. We get the Mongolian beef (which is actually the best we&#39;ve had from anywhere), the shrimp with vegetables (the shrimp is always perfectly cooked), pork fried rice (they give you a ton) and eggrolls. However, I did order the Pad Thai once and was very disappointed. Stick to the Chinese menu and you should be good."

I ordered a beef fried rice and their Sesame Plate (combo platter of egg rolls, fried shrimp, crab rangoon, bbq pork, teriyaki chicken, and teriyaki beef). The fried rice was good, nothing out of the ordinary, but overall I was satisfied with the fried rice. Not so much with the Sesame Platter. The crab rangoons and fried shrimp were good but then it goes downhill from there. The egg rolls seemed a little heavy on the vegetables, not that its bad, just not to my liking. The bbq pork and teriyaki beef, two of my favorites at a Chinese restaurant, were the worst I&#39;ve had. The bbq pork looked and smelled good but after trying a few pieces it tasted like the smell of dog food. I hate to use such a harsh description but it was so bad I spit it out and couldn&#39;t even force it down. I decided to move on to the teriyaki beef with high hopes, and again was disgusted. First bite I tasted some strange sauce on it. Maybe it somehow made its way on while another dish was being prepared but it definitely was not teriyaki. A few bites in and there was no texture or substance to it. It was mush. Not soft, not tender, but mush like a firm mashed potato. Figuring it was a bad piece I spit it out and tried the second piece and it was just a bad. I didn&#39;t even bother with the teriyaki chicken.

After all is said and done I would have no problem with their fried rice, and its the only thing keeping it from falling from a 2 star to 1 star rating, but I would not go back just for an order of fried rice, and their combo platter was an awful sampling of their appetizers. I will find somewhere else to go the next time I want Chinese food."

Fan of their fries, spinach artichoke crepe and DO SAVE some space for dessert crepes (must try)  with coffee. two thumbs up!!

Lunch, dinner, or just a snack, the menu covers everything.  I wasn&#39;t so sure how crepes + Indian food relate, and honestly, I&#39;m still not sure what the two have to do with one another.  But the crepes were definitely D&#39;licious so I&#39;m curious about their Indian fare too.

I had the ham and cheese (gruyere) croissant which was really good.  The crepes are a generous size.  I was tempted to order their truffle fries, but the crepes are a good enough potion that you don&#39;t really need a side.  I would order another savory crepe without a second thought!

Since we spent a decent amount of time here, we also ordered dessert crepes.  I ordered a Nutella &amp; banana crepe.  I was actually served a strawberry &amp; Nutella crepe.  I didn&#39;t complain or send it back because I do like strawberries too.  But the strawberries made the crepe too watery.  There wasn&#39;t enough Nutella in the mix to sop up the extra moisture either.  My friend had a cinnamon crepe, which was filled with icing, and that looked like the better choice.  But for me, I&#39;d be a little gun shy about ordering another dessert crepe, especially one with strawberries or fruit with a high water content.

The marbled hot chocolate (white and dark chocolate) was both a beverage and dessert, so I definitely got my sweet tooth satisfied.  They also have coffee, lattes, and Coke products.

The Indian side of the menu lists items like samosas, roti, and something called Bombay fries.  We didn&#39;t try any of the Indian food, but it all sounded really good.

There is seating inside and outside at this casual downtown Bartlett cafe.  There&#39;s a downtown Bartlett?  It&#39;s near the Bartlett train station, and the downtown area was pretty sleepy on a Sunday morning mostly surrounded by dry cleaning businesses, medical offices, and other businesses that don&#39;t really grab your attention."

We ordered the Bombay fries( I love thin cut fries so this was the absolute fav), chicken tikka kathi roll and samosa burrito. The portions are filling.(wanted to try the sweet crepes too but no more space left on the device ;) )
Will go back just to try the dessert crepes.
I would suggest the owner to add some sort of a salad or fruit as a side just to give some brightness to the dishes. After eating for a while the palette becomes monotonous.
All in all a nice place to hangout with friends while enjoying good food."

I have been wanting to try DC&amp;R for almost 2 years, and finally got the chance.  It&#39;s a cute little cafe, with indoor and outdoor seating. The menu has traditional sweet and savory crepes, but in a delightfully unique twist, it also features Indian flavored rolls and burritos! What a fantastic fusion!!! 

I ordered takeout over the phone. When my mom and I walked in, we were immediately greeted by a hostess who quickly stepped behind the register to pull up our order. I had ordered the Indian items; Nihari Kathi roll, chicken Tikka Kathi roll, lamb vindaloo burrito, butter chicken burrito, and samosa chole chat. The Kathi rolls have scrambled eggs, the burritos have rice.

Every single roll I had was delicious.  I was impressed with the authentic flavor of the Nihari beef. My favorite was the butter chicken roll because the butter chicken sauce had mixed with the rice. It was delicious!! 

The roti (bread) used for the rolls was perfectly soft and fluffy. 

I cannot wait to go back to try the sweet and savory crepes. The offerings are mouth watering!"

They had all my favorite food in one restaurant. Since I couldn&#39;t decide Indian burrito or crepe, my boyfriend ordered a crepe and I ordered a paneer makhani roti burrito thing. We also ordered Parmesan truffle fries with an aioli sauce. Everything was so delicious, I had to be rolled out of the door! The owner and wait staff are super attentive and friendly.

I was a bit skeptical as it closes at 9, and generally speaking, this is about the time you open yourself up for food poisoning at any restaurant. How ever, we were pleasantly surprised about about the entire encounter with Indian food at a French place. 

I was a bit apprehensive at first because I didn&#39;t understand the concept. We walked in and there were murals of the Eiffel Tower and peacocks. Odd. We sat out selves at a very small bistro style table and looked around the joint. 6 or 7 tiny tables inside...4 or 5 larger ones outside...fairly clean. After looking at the menu, I decided to get the chicken tikka kathi roll and paneer kathi roll. And the Bombay fries. Nothing was French about this meal other than the FRENCH fries. Ok that was a stupid joke. But seriously, the menu was extensive and there was a lot of French sounding items. A lot of crepes and what have you. 

Our food came of out and the rolls were HUGE. Not like the nyc kathi rolls that one may be accustomed to. This was more like a burrito. Before i get to the rolls, I must comment on the fries. Possibly the best fries I&#39;ve ever had in my life. Better than McDonald&#39;s, homie. They were French cut...hehehe, and topped with a masala. I thought it was black salt sanchar, but it was jeerala or something. The rolls were pretty good as well, but there was room for improvement. Mind you it was 45 minutes till closing time and perhaps a better experience might we have had an hour before. Don&#39;t get me wrong, they were pretty damn good. All I kept saying was how clean everything tastes. It was just a clean fresh flavor. The chicken and the paneer could have been 20% more juicy, but everything just tasted very clean. 

Around 20 minutes into our service, the owner came out to talk to us. This is always a great sign. He told us he used to own a place at U of I. He told me he owned a crepes place in Urbana and invented a liquid roti recipe he can feed into the crepe machine. He catered to the Indian crowd there and then decided to open up this place in his home town of Bartlett after his lease ended in Urbana. 

Pros. Super Clean and friendly. 

Cons. Small. Mosquitos. Closes at 9. 

Sorry for the abrupt ending to this review. I gotta go now.

I will absolutely be returning and absolutely recommend to others. 

Get the FRENCH fries! Haha. Ok I&#39;m done."

The savory crepe was delicious and excellent. Fresh herbs baked into the crepe itself. 

My favorite was the signature ham and cheese crepe. The recipe is unique to me, and the herbs on top were supremely fresh. If you like a ham and cheese omelet, order this- it&#39;s like an omelet, only 1,000 times better.

The coffee is imported from France, and we had a lovely cup of French press.

The service here is the best I&#39;ve had, bar none. I believe the gentleman helping us was the owner, he absolutely insisted on giving us top quality service.  He began moving tables together for us unasked, helped us move outside because it was nice out, helped us back inside when the mosquitoes found us, etc etc, all without missing a beat.  He was very attentive without ever being a bother.  (Yes, for the negative nellies out there I know that&#39;s how it should work anyway, but it&#39;s rare to get all that with a smile on the person&#39;s face and a friendly, helpful personality too!)  He made sure my friend and I had the best possible girls&#39; night out. 

THE FOOD THOUGH!!!

I was debating between dishes and he helped me select the cordon bleu crepe.  Juicy chicken, nice chunks of ham.  The spinach, tomato slices, and balsamic glaze drizzle they add was the perfect thing to brighten up what could easily have been a too heavy dish.  I added a side of super yummy truffle fries.

SO GOOD. 

For desserts they have a nice selection of gelato, I got the salted caramel.  Mmmmm.  It was delicious, I would go back just for that!

All of the food was freshly cooked, but I just didn&#39;t understand what they were doing with the flavors - there was a variety of them but they just didn&#39;t soak into the food. It all tasted very bland. 

The fries had no taste, and I didn&#39;t like the sauce it came with. They had spices on them already, and I tried dunking them into the sauce that I didn&#39;t like, but the fries still had no taste.

When I first got the burrito, it looked great. I poked a knife in it and steam was coming out. I then tried a piece of the chicken and it was good - very well cooked and had a good amount of spice  to it (ordered it spicy). But then I started eating the burrito and it was just very plain. All of the ingredients tasted very fresh and were great individually, but they just did&#39;t come together. The issue was the rice and the roti that was used to wrap the burrito. Neither of those had any flavor, so when eating the burrito all together, the flavor from the chicken got lost and the flavor from the sauce just didn&#39;t soak in with the rest of it.

The people working there were great and the food was fresh and well cooked, but it was the flavors they used and how they used them that I didn&#39;t like."

It&#39;s open again and I&#39;d like for it to stay that way so I&#39;m writing this review out of self-interest. 

The food here truly is very good. I rarely like Indian food because every place I&#39;ve been to prior the food tasted like it was mass produced, frozen, and then reheated in a microwave; i.e. it&#39;s always brownish, mushy, and what little flavor it does have is just bad. Here they do the super weird thing of making the food on location and per order, I know crazy right!?! Take note, other Indian places.

The paneer tikka saag is easily my favorite. But in case you&#39;re wondering the chicken tikka and butter chicken are mouth-watering good. Give this place a try and you&#39;ll soon become regulars like my family and me."

The place is clean, interesting decor, also was just getting busy, there were clearly a number of return customers and interesting menu.  I ordered the savoury d&#39;licious breakfast crepe but really didn&#39;t enjoy the flavor combination.  Thought it was supposed to have spinach.  There was 1 spinach leaf on the top.  Inside was mostly ham, mushrooms and pecans.  A dollop of goat cheese on top drizzled with honey.  Was it supposed to have egg as well?  There were none now that I think about it!  Off day??  Since so many have given it rave reviews, And others seemed to be enjoying it I may try again but can&#39;t recommend based on my experience.

Update;
Just double checked the menu.  My crepe definitely didn&#39;t have key ingredients!  No eggs, no spinach except the 1 leaf.  Very disappointing!  The only redeeming aspect was being offered more tea to go when I left."

Because I could, I ordered the Samosa Chole Chat (technically a side) with Masala Fries, which are shoestring fries dusted with garam masala. My wife ordered a chicken crepe.

The service was overwhelmingly nice, and very positive. It&#39;s probably a good thing, too, since it can be challenging for a novice to navigate the Indian side of the menu. Also, consider holding off on your morning coffee so that you can try their chai; I haven&#39;t tried it yet, but it&#39;s definitely what I&#39;m going back for.

My wife&#39;s crepe was good, but the samosa... I can&#39;t really summarize what was in it very well (chickpeas, tamarind... everything else, I have no idea how to pronounce or can&#39;t tell you what it is) but it is vegetarian and it is delicious, and yes you absolutely need to order it.

I&#39;m on slightly firmer ground with the fries, which have a hefty dose of fresh garam masala spice and a side of tomato sauce (not ketchup!).

It&#39;s a full service place, but the food came out fast and with a smile. I have absolutely no doubt that I will be back for some more great Indian food."

I really liked the location of this place; It&#39;s really quaint. As soon as we walked in, we were politely greeted and told that we could sit anywhere. It was quiet and, for a couple of minutes we were the only people there. I think since it wasn&#39;t so busy they decided not to play music because I did see a speaker up above. The little restaurant is beautifully decorated with paintings of the Eiffel tower and Les Miserables on one side and Indian paintings on the other. Our waitress was so kind and explained the menu beautifully. The menu is half Indian and half French but crepe-like pancakes were infused into almost everything. They make the roti with the crepe pan as well leaving the roti thin but very flavorful. 

We were only going to get dessert there but after looking at the menu, I decided to order something to go as well. Our food came out quickly. We had the tutti fruity dessert crepe which was wonderful! We also ordered ice cream with it, which was exactly what I was craving. It came with bananas, strawberries, and Nutella. It was delicious! We then ordered the butter chicken to go. It came with green sauce, which made the meal all the better. Although it wasn&#39;t traditional butter chicken, it was delightful. 

Everything was super affordable and sounded super appealing! Our waitress also was kind in answering an unrelated question about what we should do after the meal. I can&#39;t wait to go back and try more things! I really want to try something off of the French side of the menu and also some of their breakfast crepes (eggs w/ mozzarella and aioli)!

I ordered the bombay fries again,  this time there was a little less seasoned but still good. My mom &amp; I got the vegetarian version of the viva la crêpe. As an option they replace the meat with avocado. We were very satisfied. My dad ordered the strawberry banana crêpe. It was served to him with a smiley face made of the fruit on top.

I had the nihari burrito and it was very well done.  Nihari is basically cooked beef stew that is served with thick gravy with a side of ginger, onions and lime.  In this case, there is no gravy.  Its just the meat which is well done.  The roti wrapping was well done and had good consistency with the rest of the filling.  The basmati rice was light and fluffy and full of flavor. The masala fries weren&#39;t greasy at all and had good flavor which complimented the nihari burrito well.

I had a sip of the mango lassi which was very tasty and they give a decent portion of it. 

The staff was extremely friendly.  The owner is very kind, polite and professional and interacts very well with his customers.  He talked to us like a friend and was VERY hospitable.

Food was great, service was near perfect but albeit they need to tighten up their carry out orders a bit.
They billed me for 2 items yet provided just 1 item during one of the least peak hours.

I walked in at 8:40pm on a Wednesday and I&#39;m literally the only customer who placed at order until they closed. 2 items: Lamb vindaloo kathi roll and samosa chole (really not a complicated order) and yet they managed to tightly pack up the carry out bag with just 1 item and closed for the night before sending me on my way.

They might had good intentions but they need to figure out how to stop making rookie mistakes. I get this can happen when a restaurant is super busy but irks me that I was the only person who placed an order 20mins prior to close and they still got it wrong.

With that being said, carry out customers please double check your bag.

P.S I believe the owner took my order maybe that&#39;s where things went wrong. Oh well....next time I&#39;ll remember to say &#39;No, Thank you&#39; and place my order through the cashier sitting in front of a computer."

It&#39;s a créperie, which means that the main dishes are served in crepes (gluten free available) which are good - and there&#39;s different sections on the menu (each section labeled in French, but don&#39;t let that throw you - my French is good enough to translate 95% of it) for breakfasts, chicken dishes (avec poulet) and a whole two sections for Indian food!  

Susan had the western crepe and it was great - and I had the butter chicken &#39;burrito&#39;, with a little too spicy but tasty of a sauce mixed with good basmati rice and tandoori chicken.  (If that&#39;s butter chicken sauce, I&#39;m your Aunt Edna!)  Also had a Samosa with tamarind sauce on the side, a plate of thin and perfectly cooked fried with a garlic aioli sauce that made you want to clap your flippers and bark like a seal, and a dessert crepe of strawberries, mascarpone, and bananas that rapidly quieted the fire in my mouth.  

Not cheap but very, very good and decent service.  The place was busy but not jammed, and Operatic instrumentals were playing in the background.  Nice little joint in downtown Bartlett; we&#39;ll be back.  Good coffee too!

Minus one star for the spicing level on the butter chicken being way hot."

It was a new crepe/roti concept that really intrigued me.  So, FINALLY, I was able to come over to visit D&#39;licious Crepes and Roti in Bartlett! :)

This nice, quaint restaurant is nestled in the heart of Downtown Bartlett, right in front of  Bartlett Village Hall. :)  It is easy to get to from the Bartlett Metra Station which is mere steps away! :)

I was expecting a order from a menu on the wall, fast-casual place, but I was surprised we were asked to sit down and were given actual menus to order from.  The decor is modern, lots of dark woods and rattan chairs around the  dining area.  The cooler aspect of this place are the two crepe creation stations that patrons can come up to and watch their crepes being created before their eyes.  I love seeing food being made(teppanyaki cuisine comes to mind) in front of you and D&#39;licious Crepes and Roti does that for you!  

I brought my family along to try this place. My husband ordered the Beef Bourguignon special, which he said was awesome.  I ordered a paneer kathi roti and it was JUST as awesome I could barely tell it was cheese and not chicken! :) I will try the chicken one next time!

The flavors and spices really brought me to the Indian cuisine I had so longed for(I wish they had a vindaloo roti...ooh I don&#39;t mind the spicy. :)  But, not long after I had taken a trip to India that I was WHISKED AWAY to France with D&#39;licious Crepe and Roti&#39;s sweet CREPES. Now, crepes are a whole different thing there are both savory and sweet crepes.  My daughter tried one of their breakfast crepes and enjoyed it, but not as much as she enjoyed her Black and White(nutella and banana) crepe, she practically inhaled it! Although I was quite stuffed after my Paneer kathi roti, I shared a La Cacahuete (Peanut Butter, Nutella and Banana) crepe. OMG the Peanut Butter EXPLODED in my mouth coating it in creamy peanut buttery goodness! :)   My husband who helped me with my La Cacahuete was in agreement as we both love peanut butter. :)

The staff and owner of D&#39;licious Crepes and Roti were all very accommodating and helpful!  They had a lot of suggestions and were friendly.  We were very well thanked and well taken cared of on our first trip to their lovely establishment! 

Will I return? OH YOU BETCHA!!  I love crepes both savory and sweet!  Definitely check this place out if you are a crepe fanatic!! Or want something a little different than the dull and boring. :)

GO! NOW! Give D&#39;licious Crepes and Roti! You will NOT regret it!"

You know when a proprietor radiates pride and stops at every table checking in? This is such a place. Indian food or crepes is an interesting approach that worked well for us as a casual Saturday morning stop. Add quality food and unique options with affordable pricing and this is too notch. Add fancy coffee imported from the Netherlands Douwe Egberts and it&#39;s a real treat. Only area for improvement is while they have excellent quality products they may not be fantastic baristas yet. With a little practice I think they will master that too. Give this local place a try and enjoy the outdoor seating!

I&#39;ve heard about this French/Indian/Crepe place in Bartlett for quite some time and it always had good reviews.  I just couldn&#39;t get the concept.  Crepes, Indian, Gelato, Coffee, what kind of crazy mix up is that.

Well, last Friday night I couldn&#39;t figure out what to have for dinner and for some reason this place popped in my head.  The family was out of town, so I figured I&#39;ll just go and give it a try.  I am so glad I did.  I was greeted as soon as I walked in and took a seat at the bar.  My order was taken (I had the Signature Ham and Cheese Crepe), figured I&#39;d start out with what they identified as one of their best.  It took a little bit for the food to come out, but watching them prepare the food I understood it was fresh and being made.  For that I will gladly wait and watch. I took my first bite, mind you most Crepe&#39;s I&#39;ve had were dessert based so i wasn&#39;t sure what to expect.  It was AMAZING, the bechamel sauce was wonderful.  The Crepe was great, the meat and cheese&#39;s had great flavors and all played wonderfully together.  I had to pace myself so I didn&#39;t look like a crazy guy woofing it down.

The next day on Saturday I kept thinking about the crepe and decided I had to try other options, so I used the Yelp Eat24 app to place a to go order.  Wanted to see how that worked anyhow.  This time I ordered the Butter Chicken Burrito, Samosa and 
Mascarpone Delight Crepe.  When I arrived they informed me they were running a bit behind but would have it ready shortly.  No big deal, I took a seat.  While I waited they brought me a glass of water and assured me the food would be ready shortly.  Then the owner came out and apolgized, offered me a free coffee.  I politely declined, but he insisted it would be good.  Why not, so he brought me an espresso with a little piece of chocolate on the side.  HOLY WOW, that espresso was good.  Creamy, Caramelly coffee goodness and the chocolate piece was great as well.  Anyhow, minutes later the food was ready.  I took my time finished the coffe and went home.  The food again was amazing, but I ordered more than I could actually eat.  Wrapped it up and the next day my wife finished off the Burrito.  A day old and slightly cold and she thought it was still amazing.

We&#39;ll be back soon to journey across the rest of the menu and check out the gelato next time.  So glad I decided to get past the idea of what a crazy combo this was and discovered a new wonderful place to eat in Bartlett."

We got the paneer roti with masala eggs and the paneer burrito. The flavors were good, and the prices reasonable. I&#39;ve had way better Kati rolls in NYC, so this was kinda of a let down. The burrito was supposed to have spinach in it but it was pretty scarce.

Also decided to share a dessert crêpe, the strawberry &amp; Nutella. Again I&#39;ve definitely had much better elsewhere. 

Not really sure I would drive back to Bartlett again for this place."

I seen a lot of good reviews here and the pictures looked very appealing. So today in a winter storm, my family and I decided to walk and give it a try. 
    
When we came in the restaurant, there was only a woman and her three daughters. It wasn&#39;t a surprise seeing the place empty because of the bad weather. Anyway, the owner greeted us very friendly and we took our seat, and right after he asked for the drinks we wanted to get, I asked for tea, and he recommended the lime with agave, so I ordered that one, and it was really good! My dad order hot chocolate and my mom ordered decaf coffee. 

As for the food, my dad order a chipotle chicken crepe, my mom the beef burrito, and me, I ordered the chicken tikka burrito. All I have to say that the name of the restaurant says it all. &#34;DELICIOUS!&#34; It was something new for us and I personally loved every bite of it. Now, in a restaurant the food can be really good, but what I think makes a great 5 star restaurant which I have this, it&#39;s the service. I really felt valued as a customer by the owner. He really cares about his customers and the community. 

I would definitely go back to this place specially to try the black and white crepes which I had no more room to eat. 

Excellent experience overall!"

Delicious, inexpensive, ample parking, friendly staff, and free coffee. I was quite happy that I got to visit this place for lunch before leaving town after Christmas. I was surprised to see so many 5 star reviews for a new place so it had to be good. This is located off the strip mall in downtown Bartlett. You can park in front, around the side, or even in back. The store itself is smaller, goes with the cafe feel of the restaurant. The owner was present and was super nice when he saw our large group &#34;5 people is large considering most of the tables are for two&#34; and he had the waitress move two tables together. They were quick to get the orders and provide a cup of the small coffee. The coffee itself is good (Douwe Egberts Coffee (Netherlands) but it does come from a machine that likely mixed coffee powder with water, but hey free is free. I had the rumali roti chicken tikka burrito for 6 dollars. It had ample amount of tandoori chicken, the right amount of kick/spiciness with garbanzo beans and tamarind. The mint yogurt side decreased the heat when needed. It was cooked well and wrapped in roti. If they had a chicken mahani wrap it maybe even better just a FYI if the owner is paying attention, but for that price it is equivalent to chiptole and can give them a run for the money. The banana/nutella crepe for dessert was delicious. I have never been to France so I can&#39;t compare to it, but I have had Magic Pan the LEYE restaurant and it is comparable. Ample banana and nutella in a fresh made crepe. Overall great experience. I hope the friendly owner keeps up with the wonderful service. Based on that we are sold and will come again!

Pros: Free coffee small, only 1 dollar if you want a large. Fresh made crepes. Good prices and portion size. Unique dining experience, get to this place before it gets too busy!

Cons: Limited hours, small seating area, food prep takes a while after your order but that is the price you pay for good food

We visited this place in route from Madison to Wheaton to see a show. We had no idea that we walked in a half hour after they closed. Incredibly embarrassed that we walked in after closing, we tried to apologetically walk out. However, the very kind owner insisted that we not only order some food, but stay in to eat it. We really did not want to impose and tried to respect the closing time, but the staff all urged us to stay. 

We decided to go ahead and order. We were offered free coffee while we waited for our order to be made. They give free coffee out to all who want it...regardless of whether you order food or not. And, the coffee is actually really good! The food is made right in front of you so both my boys were highly entertained watching the owner make their strawberry and nutella crepes right before their eyes. They both devoured their crepes! We also ordered the buffalo chicken crepe and the roti burrito. The kick of the buffalo chicken burrito was a nice touch to the natural slight sweetness of the crepe. It was a great combination. The roti burrito was, by far, my favorite. I&#39;m in love with the concept of putting Indian flavors into a burrito style wrap. 

A few of the staff and the owner all checked in on us to make sure we were enjoying our food. They went above and beyond any restaurant I have ever been to. The service was excellent. The food was fantastic. I would highly recommend this place to anybody rolling through the area and looking for a bite to eat."

Him as this restaurant. 

First off it is a bit easy to look past considering it&#39;s location on the highway and connected to a liquor store- but don&#39;t let the location fool you it is a
Hidden gem!! 

I&#39;ve been here twice now and both times I&#39;m super impressed! 

Have been able to try different things both times I visited but some of my favorites include the creamy
Corn starter, the shrimp taco ( al camelion) and the beer battered tilapia tacos. And the ranchero masa. All super tasty dishes with really great flavors.

The margaritas were also such a hit- the original was well made and the perfect blend, not to mention great presentation on the drink as well as the food!

Highly recommend- always such great service too!"

Roberto is the owner, really nice guy.  He has 2 other restaurants, one of which I have already been to.  It&#39;s in Geneva and it&#39;s called Altiro, and it&#39;s also really good.

His restaurants aren&#39;t the typical Mexican food, it&#39;s more fusion, which means they have some flavors and dishes you may not be used to.

For this particular location, it may be a little hard to find.  It&#39;s actually on the on/off ramp for Rt. 38 and 59.

The inside is decorated very nice.  It may actually have been the nicest / most upscale feeling Mexican restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to.  Don&#39;t let that fool you though, the prices are roughly the same as many other places.  

Definitely worth trying."

I was a fan of the Mexican restaurant previously in this storefront (around that curvy bend of Roosevelt and Route 59, next to a liquor store) and curious to see what opened in its place.

West Chicago is not the first town that comes to mind when thinking of new restaurants to try.  In the west suburbs it&#39;s usually Geneva, Naperville, but not West Chicago - a residential and industrial town that just gets confused with the actual city of Chicago.  So it&#39;s exciting to see something new and different in the area.

The interior of the restaurant is dim and open.  With tables positioned somewhat close together, I was surprised that other conversations did not overpower ours.

The menu is composed of dishes that are easily shareable, but as the waiter jovially pointed out, &#34;you don&#39;t have to share if you don&#39;t want to!&#34;  Tacos come in an order of 4 for $10, but these are on the smaller side, so eating 4 is not exactly a challenge.  I had the pastor tacos and loved the spicy kick.  It would have been nice to have a mix-and-match taco option though, because there were so many others I would have liked to try!

For sides, we shared the guacamole and spicy corn.  The guacamole was good, but for $8 I thought the portion was too tiny, and it&#39;s really just guacamole.  The spicy corn was delicious; one of their most popular dishes.  It&#39;s similar to an elote.

The drink menu is like a gift from god after a long day.  Margaritas, palomas, mojitos, and more!  I had the Hibiscus Cocktail (it had a funky name, but that&#39;s what it was) which was fresh, strong, and well worth whatever the pricetag was on it.

We had no problem getting a table on a Wednesday evening.  I&#39;ve visited a similar taco spot in Geneva (not Altiro) which often has wait times of an hour or longer.  Forget the cache of dining in Geneva and give Al Chulo a try."

We visited on a cold and rainy night. As others have said, the door opens right into the dining room. They wanted to seat us near the door and I told them I had to sit far away from it. I don&#39;t like eating with my coat on and I had to even though I was far away from the door. Although they try to make the interior nice, the chairs reminded me of plastic patio chairs. You can put a nice pillow on those, but they are still hard and don&#39;t really encourage taking your time to eat.

The drink menu is loaded with different kinds of mixed drinks which are about $10 each. Mine was good, but for $10 it should have had more liquor. There are no beers listed, we had to ask and yes they do have some.

The menu is limited and was kind of confusing. We had several questions and then ordered some tacos. They were tasty. We also had their selection of salsas and some chips. Those were flavorful.

I used the women&#39;s restroom and it was clean, but there was no toilet paper holder! It was just indicative of how they seemed to miss on the little things at this place.

There weren&#39;t many diners in the place, yet we felt like we were ignored. There wasn&#39;t any kind of extra effort made to make sure we were enjoying our experience. You can get the food right, but without the great service and surroundings, it just doesn&#39;t work for me."

First, the chips and salsa here are not complimentary, and they&#39;re just as overpriced as everything on the menu. The tacos are extremely expensive without reason. The tacos aren&#39;t bad but I would&#39;ve been happier spending the same amount on more tacos at any given taco place. I have no problem paying a higher price , but at that price I should at least leave with a full belly. The drinks are very tasty but should come in either bigger proportions or more alcohol given that they&#39;re ten dollars a piece. The service was good. If you&#39;re coming here you&#39;re paying for fancy plates and oblong bowls. Not worth it."

The several different tacos plates that we tried were very good, but don&#39;t leave without trying the shrimp, avocado (forgot the name) plate. Also, my friend threatened to lick out the bowl in front of God and everybody after we finished the corn, cheese, and rice appetizer.

A very good place, I look forward to heading back when I&#39;m in the area."

I finally got my chance on Saturday and it was definitely worth the wait.  We started out with the Al Arroz Verde (creamy corn/poblano rice) which was out of this world. It tasted so fresh and creamy, but not heavy. If we had not been in the middle of a restaurant, I would have definitely licked the bowl clean! Next was the guacamole - some of the best I&#39;ve ever had - fresh, chunky and full of flavor without too much heat. Next came the Al Tingo (shredded chicken piled on 3 mini tostadas) - the fresh flavor exploded in your mouth. Then came 4 Al Poblano Tacos which were covered in the creamy poblano sauce used in the Al Arroz - need I say more. We finished off our meal with the Tres Leches for dessert -  that was a wonderful exclamation point on a fabulous dinner. 

Service was fabulous! Can&#39;t wait to go back and try the rest of the menu and the handmade margaritas!

It&#39;s very exciting to have such a high quality restaurant in our small little town."

Unfortunately, the shrimp tacos only have one shrimp with cheese leaving me wanting for more substance within each individual taco. The corn dip was very delicious and so were the pork tacos. The flan was excellent with a hint of coffee flavor, but again they gave you a VERY small portion, 3-4 bites, for the price. If they increase the amount of product witin each taco and other plates as well, I feel that they would have more business. The price was a lot for what he were given. Very beautiful decor, but I believe they need to alter their dishes and make sure the ratio of tortilla to meat to make the customers more happy. I understand that it is an upscale Mexican restaurant, but some of their items needed a little more. My mother ended up adding guacamole to the shrimp tacos since all it consisted of was 1. The corn tortilla 2. One tiny, mini shrimp and 2. Melted cheese. Great flavors, though, just needs improvement on certain dishes overall."

However, we were very excited to learn that Al Chulo was gonna be opening in that same location. After hearing great things about the place, my fiancé and I decided to stop in for a late dinner last night. First off the decor is very classy and totally different from the Luchador masks that were on the walls when it was Changaro. We were seated right away. The place wasn&#39;t overly crowded but it was also 8:30pm. 
  We started with chips and guacamole. We both tried their specialty margaritas. My fiancé loved the passion fruit one. Next we tried a few of their different tacos. Now if you are looking for traditional taco joint style tacos, this place is not for you. There are no basic ground beef, lettuce, and cheese tacos or burritos on this menu. However, if you want to broaden your palate and try some amazing food this is the spot. We had the al pastor tacos, fish tacos, and a steak &amp; chorizo sope. The al pastor tacos were better than the authentic ones we had when we were in Mexico. The sope was pretty amazing as well. Overall we very pleased with our food and drink choices.
   I have read several complaints on yelp about the service there. We had a great dining experience. Our waiter was actually Miguel, the owner of the restaurant. He is a great guy and has a true passion for what he does. He chatted with us throughout our meal and as the place died down he sat with us and had some great conversations. He even brought us out shots of his private reserve tequila. 
    Our quick late night dinner ended up being a 2.5 hr great dining experience. It goes to show you, treat everyone equally with kindness because we thought he was just a waiter and ended up being the owner and treating us very well. 
    I highly recommend this place if you want a  nontraditional mexican fusion delicious meal. We even talked to Miguel about catering our wedding. Please support this place so it sticks around. It is nice not having to drive to Geneva to deal with the long wait times at Bien Trucha. Miguel also owns Altiro in Geneva as well so go show some love and have a kick ass meal."

Started with the Al Esquite roasted corn appetizer and the Al Camaleon shrimp/bacon/avocado tacos, which in end-of-meal review came out as close favorites.  Honestly, we could have each happily had our own bowl of the corn, but wanted to try more things. For seconds we shared Al Ceviche tortas (towers of lime-marinated Tilapia with red onions, tomatoes, avocado) and the Al Chulo tacos (steak, ham, bacon, cheese).  Almost full, we wanted &#34;dessert,&#34; so had Al Hongo portabellos roasted with chile and a sour cream/roasted salsa combo that did actually come across as slightly and deliciously sweet. I can&#39;t forget to mention the candy-in-a-glass mojito, worth breaking my usual tee-totalling tendencies.  I wish we had taken photos, but we really just wanted to eat this food as soon as it landed on the table.  We were there @ 1:15 on a Tuesday and it was almost empty, so we hope it builds the business it deserves (since it will be the new go-to restaurant for us)!"

I had the sangria, which was very tasty. 
We ordered the ceviche, guacamole, a creamy corn and rice casserole (can&#39;t remember the exact name) and the shredded pork tacos. This corn/rice dish was probably our favorite thing, and we enjoyed everything. (We ordered a 2nd helping of the rice/corn dish after we quickly finished the first one.)
I&#39;m sorry that we were too full for dessert; I can&#39;t wait to try their tres leche cake or their flan. (Next visit.)
The service was wonderful - both of the servers were very attentive and pleasant. They really loved that we enjoyed everything.
Guests need to keep in mind that this is tapas style, so they are small plates, meant to be shared. A few of the other commenters didn&#39;t seem to understand that. They are priced reasonably to all the other upscale tapas restaurants in this area; the bill was not more than we expected for the amount of food we ordered and again, we loved everything.

One recommendation for the menu is to create a combo of tacos. I would have loved to try more than the pork tacos.

They changed the location of the front door from the previous restaurant; it now opens up into the dining area. In the warmer months this won&#39;t be a problem at all, but it was cold tonight, and when the door opened, a gust of air blew right into the main area. Knowing this, we&#39;ll ask for a corner table when it&#39;s cold. 

We really can&#39;t wait to come back again. We&#39;ll try all new dishes, but we&#39;re always going to order the corn/rice dish. 

As my husband, Dan Milligan says, &#34;Don&#39;t be a fool-o, eat at Al Chulo.&#34;"

After that, the rest of my review goes downhill.
First walking in to the restaurant, you see the updated atmosphere, pretty wall paper and fancy chairs. Not bad. The tables are super close together though. My husband and I were seated along the wall and I had to squeeze between 2 tables to get to the bench (I&#39;m not a big person either). If there was someone at the table next to us, we&#39;d have no privacy whatsoever. 
We looked at the menu and saw that the salsas were $6 each. Ok...not a fan, but we ordered one anyways. The salsa came out and it was at most 2 tablespoons worth. Not enough for 2 people. We were able to eat about 4-5 chips each with that one salsa. I don&#39;t want to spend $12+ on just salsa. We tried the guacamole as well...it came out looking pretty, but again, small portion. And very salty. Won&#39;t order that again. At this point we said something to our waiter about the size of salsa. The chef ended up coming out and explained that everything there was made fresh so the portions are smaller and more expensive. I get it...but lots of other places make their food fresh and it&#39;s not so expensive. 
I ordered the chicken taco that was fried with potato and cheese (sorry, forgot the name of it...El Donato maybe), but it tasted like fried tortilla. I could not even taste the chicken, potato or cheese. My husband ordered the &#34;Al Chulo&#34; taco...and that was good. 
So,  the food here is just ok. I understand they just opened and maybe have kinks to work out...but this was my first experience there. The portions are &#34;tapas&#34; style which I understand...but I still think they are too small. I do not think my food was worth $90 including tip. Not in West Chicago. Might come back in a couple of months to see if anything changed."

The flavors were delicious and the temperature of the steak was perfect. Even the bun was so good and very fresh.  I can&#39;t wait to come back for dinner!

They have more sophisticated palettes than most adults. The decor is very cool and modern for the location and the town of West Chicago.....I give it an A for effort. Tables are a bit small but they don&#39;t bring out the food all at once so its not such a big deal. Most Americans see a Mexican restaurant and expect burritos as big as your head and the typical gringo fair! You won&#39;t get that here. The food at Al Chulo is upscale modern tapas style Mexican. If your looking for a gluttonous American chain type of experience, then this isn&#39;t your place. Prices may be higher than most but your not getting your average tuesday night fast meal for you and the family. 

I loved it and will definitely be back. Its so important to patronize small business in your community. I know this......as Ive owned one for 23 years and always appreciate the kindness of my patrons!"

My husband and I live close, and the place that was here before (Changarro) shut down- it was awesome and we hoped this would kind of be a replacement. Upper scale Mexican is hard to come by in the burbs. 

The decor is pretty, but not functional. Maybe the window seats with high tables would have been better, but we were sat in the middle of the room next to another couple despite being the only ones in there. The table was so small, and I couldn&#39;t comfortably cross my legs underneath it (I&#39;m 5&#39;1) it was not cozy at all. 

Drinks were great, and were much like the previous establishment- fresh muddled, proper margaritas. 
We ordered the salsa sampler and they were all delicious but extremely small portions with a tiny basket of chips. 

My husband ordered tinga style chicken tacos and he liked them. 
I&#39;m vegan, and I understand this can be a &#34;pain in the ass&#34; to some waiters. I don&#39;t expect to be fully catered to everywhere I go but I&#39;ve never been somewhere that tweaking a few things wasn&#39;t a problem. Aside from salsa and guac there was nothing for me. I asked if they could grill up some peppers, onion and potatoes for tacos. Pretty simple....but what they sent out was completely different. Beans, a slaw and what may have been grilled cactus. They weren&#39;t bad, but I don&#39;t think what I ordered would have been difficult to whip up...and I would have enjoyed more. 
The tacos are really small, and they don&#39;t come with a side of rice or beans etc. 

The service is....brand new restaurant service. Possibly brand new to serving service. They were nice and they tried, but more experience is definitely needed here. 

Also...my tacos came out first, and my husbands order took another 10+ minutes...kind of killed the &#34;dinner together&#34; vibe. 

It&#39;s unfortunate, but I don&#39;t see this place lasting :("

One of the ladies there was super helpful and let us try the different sauces.  The last time we were there, a gentleman helped us, and offered us to try the sauces, but we denied as we&#39;ve been there several times (good to know they offer that though!)

It is a great place for people who are new to Indian food to try out!  Your meal is less than $10, and it fills you up!!"

The food was served on the paper version of the elementary school cafeteria plastic tray. Portions were on the smaller side of what you would expect for the price. The cost for two was exactly 29.00 including beverages not a bad price had we enjoyed the food.

The Good
The garlic wheat naan was the best thing on my plate. The customer service and water was something spectacular. I loved the paper and pencil circle fill sheet to guide you in picking your meal. No complaints about the rice yet not the best I&#39;ve had. The bf had a mango beverage, it tasted like a liquid yogurt and was delicious.

The Bad
I had the chicken protein in the red sauce, he had the lamb in the brown medium sauce though his had a slightly better flavor than mines, I would never want it again. I dipped the naan in the sauce since there appeared to be far more sauce than meat, reminded me of a stew. The lentils were bland and so was the fried chicken pastry. The bf tasted my pastry said it was ughhh and the lamb pastry was better. My beverage was the ginger tea tasted like a spicy seasoned soda water we both agreed it was totally disgusting and I was completely unimpressed.

The Ugly
There&#39;s an untidy area leading to the back once you&#39;re in the dining area that&#39;s a bit disturbing especially for a restaurant. We didn&#39;t nearly finish our food and decided to toss it out. Needless to say we left hungry and decided to go somewhere else for dinner.

I must say of all the Indian cuisine I&#39;ve had this was right at the bottom with the worst. Based on the ratings here I truly expected more. ;("

Today I tried ordering by phone and the guy put me on hold for 10 mins(probably forgot that he put me on hold). So I hung up and tried calling back again in 10 mins. The guy who answered told me they are busy but didn&#39;t apologize for forgetting to put me on hold when I told him I called earlier. I asked him if he can take my order now and be able to make in half an hour and he basically told me to hold on for another few minutes. Instead of again being put on hold and being forgotten, I thought of not ordering at all. I told him that I&#39;ll go somewhere else and he said &#39;okay&#39; and hung up! 

Not sure what to say- I definitely like the place but right now quite annoyed by the treatment. Advice to management- try to hire guys that are a little more polite to customers."

Hardly touched those, and the serving sizes are very small for the price. The naan was a little too hot for my liking -this may be the first time I&#39;ve never finished garlic naan!

The lady at the front counter was very helpful and friendly.  Since we were newbies she let us taste all the sauces which was awesome because they were very different.  All the sauces were &#34;dalicious&#34; and well thought out. We went with the brown sauce since it was vegan, but next time I think I&#39;ll try with the creamy sauce. 

The portion size was perfect.  No food was wasted, but we were both full! We both a mango lassi&#39;s that were super tasty as well.

The menu was easy to understand and order. I ordered paneer as protein and my son ordered lamb. Both platters tasted so good. And I love that the naans were so light and fluffy and didn&#39;t stuff me and make me comotized later. I also love that there are variety of items including a bite size samosa for $7.99 

Service was very good and the ambience and the decoration are good as well. Looked clean and well kept. 

We also ordered chicken briyani as a take out and my son said it was okay and lacked bit of flavor.

4 stars because the rice that came in the platter was dry and tasted like it was cooked with not enough water. Hopefully they take care of it.

I had friends and family in from out of town and they wanted Indian food. Being a creature of comfort, I didn&#39;t want to stray too far from the house so I decided to roll the dice on this place. As other Yelpers say, this is a different way of ordering Indian food. I wasn&#39;t quite sure what to expect as it&#39;s a new concept for me. The staff couldn&#39;t be more friendly as they explained, in detail, every little thing about how to order and the various options available. There were three of us and each ordered something different.  We received our food in a cafeteria-style tray.  Again not what I&#39;m used to from an Indian restaurant.  However, Dalicious is not your typical Indian restaurant.  All you need to know is that you should go here immediately and try it out. The portions may seem small but in this land of gluttony, it&#39;s refreshing. You definitely will not leave hungry and the experience with the wait staff and the owners is the icing on the cake.

This is more of a lunch place than it is for dinner.

My goal was to create a Chicken Makhani dish wish turned out really well.  The naan was crisp, and the lamb samosa were also really good.

My wife&#39;s goal was to create a Malai Kofta dish, and unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t what she was expecting.  It didn&#39;t compare well to a typical Indian restaurant where you order Malai Kofta off the menu, but I guess that&#39; s not the restaurant&#39;s intention either.

Overall, great food, and friendly staff."

I usually go to restaurants that offer a buffet, but on this occasion I decided to try this as a take-out option.  As a first-time customer, they took me through the menu options and explained how everything worked.  While the selections are somewhat limited, I was very happy with the quality of the ingredients and the taste of everything once I got home.   My all-time favorite dish is chicken tikka masala and this was one of the options on the menu (although they just simply call it Chicken with red sauce). The gave a generous portion of naan with the meal.   Everyone was very friendly.   It took about 15 minutes for my meal to be ready, but they said I could always call ahead next time to save time.  I will definitely be back."

Best of all, they are very vegetarian and vegan friendly!

I had paneer makhani with yellow dal, naan and a veggie samosa. The paneer was probably average in flavor- I was disappointed that it was not spicier, since I checked the little box marked &#34;Spicy!&#34; on the order form. Next time, I will ask for it extra spicy! My samosa was really tasty and I liked the naan, too. I liked my yellow dal more than the dal makhani- I also wasn&#39;t thrilled with my husband&#39;s malai kofta and wouldn&#39;t order it again, so I guess overall I made the better ordering decisions, haha.

The value here is impressive- we ordered two meals and four beverages and our total was around $22. It would have been under $20 if my husband had not decided to order a Thums Up, which is an Indian cola, on the way out the door. (We both really liked the Thums Up, by the way!)

The lady who took our order and brought out our food was really friendly and nice, too, and our food came out quickly. This is a good choice for lunch when you want Indian food but don&#39;t want to go the buffet route."

Gracious accommodating order taker, I got the paneer with brown sauce.  That plus the Dal and the onion vegetable mix were outstanding.   The lamb samosa and chutneys first class and the combo plate for $7.50.  Plenty of food for lunch.

However, if you want incredibly high quality Indian food without having to break the bank, this is your place! 

They have an excellent special, you get a protein dish, rick, dahl, samosa, bread, and a few other extras. Throw in a mango lassi, and you get all of this for less than $12!

I&#39;ve eaten at quite a few different Indian restaurants in the Naperville area. None of the others can match this quality of food for the price. I actually think that the meat  used at Dalicious is better than the meat at most other local Indian restaurants."

We really couldn&#39;t have chosen better! It&#39;s a classy setting not overwhelmed by noise due to carpeting and acoustic ceiling panels (I didn&#39;t even realize til I went off to the bathroom in the lounge area that there was a piano player in the next room!) 

We started with the five-cheese course (they give you a list, but I wish they also clarified which is which when the plate arrives), accompanied by raisin crostini and fig compote; quite an excellent array, and plenty for three people. 

All of us were pleased by our entree choices. I had the deconstructed lobster mac and cheese: a lobster tail that was served alongside a plate of spiral pasta bathed in a smoked gouda cheese sauce, with a slice of bacon on the side. All the elements were delicious and I would definitely order this again. 

My dad had the Lake Superior whitefish roasted on a cedar plank, which he pronounced excellent, and my mother had the bouillabaisse, which isn&#39;t seen too often outside of French or Cajun restaurants and was enough to serve two people, loaded with crab, calamari, clams, and other seafood in a rich tomato broth. 

When they made the reservation my mom had said it was their anniversary, so when we ordered dessert (key lime pie and caramel budino), the key lime pie came out on a plate with &#34;Happy Anniversary&#34; written on it in chocolate sauce, which was a sweet touch. While the key lime was tasty, the caramel budino custard, served somewhat awkwardly in a mason jar, was the table favorite. 

Our waiter Luis was a consummate professional, made good suggestions and did an excellent job. 

Definitely a worthy location to celebrate a big occasion. Happy Anniversary, Mom and Dad!"

We ordered three appetizers to share. My favorites were the polenta sticks and the grilled baby octopus. The Oysters Rockefeller were tried, but disappointed.
The husband and I both enjoyed the salad of organic mesclun greens with mustard vinaigrette. The others ordered the beet salad and the chopped salad. Both were enjoyed.
The rib tips with sweet potato purée (up charge for the sweet potato purée), 2 salmons medium rare (and perfectly cooked) with a shrimp succotash and garlic spinach, and sautéed sea scallops sided with the sweet potato purée and the garlic spinach were our entrees. Everything was delicious.
For dessert we had an order of the rice pudding, a scoop of chocolate ice cream with caramel sauce, and 2 flourless chocolate cakes with chocolate mousse and caramel sauce were our desserts. Everyone had a lovely sweet experience followed by very good coffee. 
Ambience was nice. A pianist was playing in the bar area (Saturday night).
Service was outstanding from Sarah! She made our whole dining experience much better. She was friendly, very knowledgeable about the menu options and did her best to accommodate each diner&#39;s preferences. At all times she was organized, professional, and fantastic!

The name on the building is Parkers&#39; Restaurant and Bar.  The domain name for their website is &#34;ParkersAmerican.&#34;  On different sites around the web, you&#39;ll see a reference to &#34;Parker&#39;s Ocean Grill.&#34;

I&#39;m already confused and I haven&#39;t even been seated. The restaurant boasts they are all about &#34;fresh,&#34; and maintain relationships with specially selected suppliers, growers and farmers for filling their larder. I have no reason to doubt that, with one exception. The &#34;catch of the day&#34; when I was there was &#34;Tilapia brought from the Gulf,&#34; which is probably incorrect, an awful lot of wild tilapia is inedible, and the tilapia served in US restaurants and available in groceries is farmed - pond raised. There are a few tilapia farms in the US, but the vast majority of farmed tilapia sold in the US comes from Latin America or Asia. Small matter.

Spoiler alert. Unless you&#39;re planning a special evening, have a large group, or need to eat at a specific hour, hit the bar for their happy hour menu,  at these days and times:

Monday thru Friday - 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.
Saturday - 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.
Sunday - 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.

The bar menu is half-price and there are drink specials, of course. The bar menu includes some small plates, a number of wood-fired pizzas, and a couple sandwiches, including a traditional New England lobster roll. Here&#39;s what&#39;s cool about that. At the happy hour price, the lobster roll is less than you&#39;d pay nearly anywhere from Massachusetts to Maine! Honest!

We went with tempura shrimp (3 to an order) and bruschetta, (Wood Grilled Garlic Crostini, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Laura Chenel Goat Cheese, Roasted Tomato Basil Salad). The bruschetta was heavy on the herbs, and the group universally panned it.

On to the dinner table, and the entree orders were preceded by a wedge salad to share, followed by sea scallops  with gnocchi, cedar plank roasted Lake Superior whitefish with mash, a tilapia sandwich with shoestrings, and me?  Why a burger, of course, &#34;Certified Angus,&#34;  Moody Blue cheese (Wisconsin), Lettuce, Tomato, on a toasted Challah.  The kitchen&#39;s choice is to serve this with a chipotle mayo, which I passed on.  It&#39;s a pretty fine burger, terrific Wisconsin blue cheese (but owned by the Swiss cheese giant Emmi which has been buying up small specialty cheesemakers in the US), the bun was buttered, toasted, and firm enough to hold the meat and any condiments one chose.

I have kind of a problem with &#34;Certified Angus,&#34; which is merely a service mark a group of ranchers dreamed up in the 70s.  They have various claims about their beef being &#34;better,&#34; I can&#39;t say if it is or not, I know I&#39;ve had lots of great burgers from very small producers.  My personal favorite is (no, not Pat Lafrieda, but Creekstone Farms).  In any case, the burgers was A-OK.  $14.00.  Reports from around the table - a rave for the whitefish, a &#34;great&#34; for the tilapia sandwich, and a &#34;meh&#34; for the scallops. She thought the texture was odd.  I can relate to that.

I&#39;m not sure where I would place this type of restaurant - I guess you could call it &#34;casual fine dining?&#34;  It&#39;s a nice room, tablecloths, a buncha flatware, kinda noisy, and people come in all sorts of apparel.  Entrees range from $14 - $50.  Dinner for four, with wine, was close to $300. 

You need three things to have a restaurant that&#39;s great, not simply good, in no particular order:  1)nice ambience, 2) great  food, 3) fantastic service. Parkers hits two out of three.  It&#39;s a nice room, pleasant, you don&#39;t feel jammed in or that the next table is eavesdropping. There are some private rooms as well.  The food was largely &#34;OK,&#34; esthetically pleasing, and rather tasty, but nothing on the menu is going to make you go &#34;wow.&#34;

The service?  Here&#39;s where this joint shined last night.  Jordan (like the river, she said), was knowledgeable, friendly, over the top attentive, checking in, but not too often, and immediately dealing with every request from the table.  Too many people in the service industry today are just passing through, and haven&#39;t bothered to even look up the definition of &#34;hospitality.&#34; Jordan nailed it.

Parkers&#39; is part of the Select Restaurant group based in Cleveland; they operated ten restaurants that stretch across America, and are mostly focused on entrees that swim.  You can make reservations online, and you probably should, because on a Saturday night, the place was jammed, and there were people waiting in the lobby."

Some days (who am I kidding.. I love Yelp EVERYDAY!) I&#39;m so thankful for Yelp &amp; the places it takes us. 

I called for reservations earlier in the day &amp; they got us in without a problem. Pulling up, we were greeted by complimentary valet &amp; walking in we heard the sweet sound of live music in the bar area. 

Although the ambiance felt pretty upscale, most (along with us) were wearing a nice shirt &amp; jeans. I&#39;d definitely skip the jeans with holes in them &amp; leave your chucks at home. Save that for the pub or brewery later ;-) 

We were greeted immediately by our sever for drinks &amp; appetizer order. Wine &amp; whiskey were our choices for the evening &amp; both were good. 
Complimentary bread &amp; crackers came pretty fast &amp; a citrus hummus &amp; softened butter accompanied the bread and crackers on the plate. The hummus was delicious &amp; added a nice touch for those dairy free diners. 

Okay so, we started with east coast oysters.. They were mind blowing! I&#39;m not sure if it was their cocktail sauce or what but we loved them! No grit, already shucked &amp; perfect!

For my entree I chose the cedar plank white fish. Honestly, I was slightly disappointed. Not that the food was bad necessarily but the fish was way under seasoned &amp; the mashed potatoes tasted like there was beef broth added or something like that.. It was slightly off putting. 

So, all in all, pretty sweet spot for a date night dinner. Why only four stars? The entree. Other than that, service &amp; the rest of our dining experience was on point. Definitely going back to check the rest of the menu out.. &amp; reorder those oysters!"

This time we ordered a dozen oysters ($12) since it was buck a shuck, shrimp cocktail ($7.5), surf and turf sliders ($6) and Caesar salad ($4). 

Dozen oysters 3.5/5: they were smallish this time but still tasty. It came with a couple of mignette sauces which was nice.

Shrimp cocktail 4/5: the jumbo shrimp were good as was the cocktail sauce.

Surf and turf sliders (3/5): Two small sliders but they were decent.

Caesar salad (4/5): A salad is a salad is a salad but the fresh shaved parmesan cheese was a nice touch.

Great bar look and feel.  You really get great value when you go for happy hour and 1/2 off the all items on the bar menu.  The food was GOOD.  Although, I feel the need to comment on my fellow diner desiring a drink on the sweeter side, yet they were out of moscato and pina coloda mix.  The service was OK, it just seemed to get a little busy for one waiter to handle.  GREAT looking bar, with wood everywhere and comforatble booths and chairs; gave off a real old-school-in-its-prime type feel.

I will update my review after going back and trying some of their drinks next time.  YES, I will be returning to enjoy all that Parkers has to offer."

Parker is surprisingly a vary large restaurant with a peripheral outdoor seating area. The bar area is unique and has a few TV&#39;s with a piano and live band playing which is a nice way to start off your night. 

We dined for my birthday and were delighted to find that our waiter was patient, courteous, very informative, and an absolute gem. 

The table starts with a variety of fresh baked breads and HUMMUS which was very unique and perfect.

For starters we ordered the halibut wontons which were some of the best fish tacos that I have ever had and I would be willing to make a future trip just for these wonderful snacks. The fish was perfectly cooked and nicely blackened with a pico de gallo topping and a creamy spicy avacado relish underneath. A MUST TRY!

The lobster bisque was served with a small piece of lobster ravioli in the center. I was a bit disappointed as the bisque was not up to par with other places considering Parker&#39;s prides themselves on their seafood. My ravioli may have been hand made but a bit chewy and unappealing. The downside was that there was only lobster in the ravioli and no meaty feel to the rest of the soup. 

I ordered the white fish with a few adjustments which included jalepenos and a blackened/paprika finish. The fish was cooked to perfection on top of a cedar wood block. Extremely appetizing and fresh!. The side came with a buttery spinach which I was pleased with but I am a big fan of fresh vegatables and a side of mashed potatoes which were a bit bland but edible. 

My wife ordered the sea scallops which were not up to par with other places in the chicagoland area. The scallops were definately fresh but slightly over cooked and a bit chewy. 

Server brought us a desert on the house which was a oreo custard in a jar and a solid way to end the night!!! 

Drinks: this place has an exensive and appealing wine menu but the specialty drinks were nothing special and the drinks are fairly overpriced in my honest opinion. 

TIP: check in on yelp for 10% off your bill!!!! 

I will be back to try out happy hour and the wonton&#39;s!"

A beautifully decorated place with the perfect romantic ambiance to share with that perfect someone on any occasion. 

Decor :
This place is perfect for any romantic occasion.  These days its very tough to find a place with a dress code but this place has it.  The do not allow ripped clothes, sweats and hats.  Dress classy and be polite.  There as are several dining rooms to cater for whatever occasion you&#39;re coming for.  They have the bar area with live piano music, the main dining room, side semi private room and a private room in the back. Tables have white clean linen cloths with candles in the mddle with dim lighting.  Silver ware and drinking glasses were fantastic.

Service:
Impeccable as our waitress was very knowledgeable and pleasant.  She was very kind as well. 

Food/Product:
Food was fantastic. I ordered the fish with steamed spinach and mashed potatoes and a lot with chicken encrusted in dough with steamed spinach. I ordered tomatoe soup and lobster bisque for starters. The bread and crackers with butter and hummus were an excellent blend with the soups. After dinner we had coffee and cappuccino with a small biscotti.

Price:
The price was very reasonable for the amount and quality of food we got. 

Overall experience/Conclusion:
This is a FANTASTIC place with excellent ambiance, service, food and price.  I&#39;ll be a repeated customer for sure."

From the selection in the area, Parkers is definitely one of the best options. I certainly appreciate the integrity of the farm raised direct trade theme for both seafood and land food. The food has been consistent and tasteful. We&#39;ve had the calamari, Cesar salad, raw oysters (best place to get them), bouillabaisse, crab cakes, lobster roll, braised beef, and the burger. None have disappointed. One particular highlight was our engagement anniversary. They treated us to both the key lime pie and cotton candy desserts. Both delicious and appreciated. The best deals are on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday afternoon for buck a shuck oysters ($1 each). Next are the happy hour deals, half price bar menu. I should also note that all of our dining experiences have been in the bar. Saturday night piano sessions are an enjoyment as well.

Part 2 of 2: Service (3 of 5)

I wish I could say the service has been as consistent as the food. Our first few visits were great. From the reservations to the servers and bus boys. The service and food kept us coming back. The most recent visits have not been as pleasant from sitting at a table to sitting at the bar. Our most recent visit, we weren&#39;t greeted at all. The greeting was from across the bar and we were asked &#34;What are you drinking tonight?&#34;. Would have liked some hospitality. The bartenders and waiters have been a bit standoffish and somewhat cold. I&#39;m not sure if it has something to do with being younger in a typically more mature crowd but it could have been off nights 3 times in a row. The first few visit really did set expectations high. Another side note, we&#39;ve had great friendly interactions with the regular patrons. Overall I wouldn&#39;t be deterred from trying Parkers or going back."

The first time I sat at the bar and the guy behind the bar is outstanding.  Half price apps during happy hour.  This place is very large.  I would recommend sitting in the bar area and they even let you make a reservation in the lounge (most places won&#39;t let you do that).  The second time I came for the live jazz on Thursday.  The band there was actually extremely good.  Because we were there in December they were playing holiday jazz, which is possibly my favorite genre of music.  And they did it well.

The baked burrata was very good.  The fried calamari was decent as in it was cooked well but there was too much breading on it.  The flat breads are decent but the crust is too soggy.  I would prefer a thin, crispy crust.  Flavors are good though.  The clear standout to me is the shrimp tempura.  Literally the best I&#39;ve ever had in my life.  The chicken spring rolls are decent.  Overall the food is above average, service and ambiance  are above average and I enjoy going there."

Being situated adjacent to a busy intersection and in front of a large business building, the location was strange. Nonetheless, it was great food wise. This is a custom and truly eye popping attraction to the eye, with several decorative lights and plants. Walking up to the door, I smelled a beautiful fragrance of tulips but as I walked into the building to wait for seating, it smelled like urine. 

Being seated by a lovely crew I took my jacket off and observed the surroundings. This place was very fancy and clean. The bar area was large and expansive. While the dining rooms were armed with a large fireplace. It was a quality experience. 

The waiter came and greeted us (a colleague and I) and we were going to order appetizers from their well designed menus. The second we took our eyes of the menu he left for something. It was a little odd because that is against my policy for customer service and satisfactory rights. He finally did come around and he asked for appetizers. So we ordered the octopus appetizer. Waiting for a good 10 minutes, we received our dish. It was a smaller dish so it shouldn&#39;t have been that long of a duration to wait. 

Coming around again, the waiter asked us to order. So I ordered the boneless rib dish. My colleague ordered too. And then we waited, and waited, and waited. Waiting for an hour for our meal, it finally came. The waiter didn&#39;t say anything about how long it took, even though the Restaurant was not very booming that day in population. 

Eating the dish, the presentation was beautiful. As for the ribs, it was very bland. The flavor should pack a punch my mouth, but it didn&#39;t. The mashed potatoes were well seasoned and delicious. I don&#39;t think a customer ordering this quality of dish should wait an hour for it to arrive, which prevented my from giving this restaurant a 4 star rating. 

Word of notice: 
Upon drinking their water, my colleague told me that a small fly was in their water! I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes. It seemed to resemble the body and wings of a tiny insect. This was discovered seconds upon leaving. It may have been a leaf or food residue. But it was still unsatisfying."

The food is still quite good at Parkers, but anyone who was there for the Mother&#39;s Day brunch knows what a mess it was. I&#39;m not sure what happened, because we went to the same brunch three years earlier, and it had a much more logical setup. 

This time, they had one long, single-sided buffet, stretching almost the full length of the dining room. This meant that there was a line of people 20 deep extending around the corner from the start, through the foyer, and into the bar. I felt so bad for the people seated in the bar,  as a line of standing diners surrounded and hovered over them. 

I&#39;d say I would give them another shot, but nowadays, I only go there to take my folks to brunch, and they were too old and annoyed with the experience to return. A shame. I&#39;d stick with them for non-holidays."

Staying for a conference and not from Chicago or this area.  I have to say I was impressed!  Only 4 stars because of expense ( I can do that right?)..... but food-service-ambience was excellent.  Restaurant is an upscale seafood-bar restaurant in a suburban-mall area.     They have a great craft beer list as well as wines.  I ordered the plank halibut and salad and was great.  Service was outstanding.  I would come back for sure if I lived in this area but it is expensive and for a party of 2 we paid $112.00 for the 2 dinners and 2 drafts only!

The decor at Parker&#39;s is comfortable and stylish - not too &#34;clubby&#34; and dressy enough that you feel like you&#39;re someplace special but won&#39;t feel under dressed if you are in jeans.  

The service was great from the moment we checked in for our reservation through to the end of our dinner.  Our server was so friendly and accommodating - we were celebrating our 30th anniversary and she recognized that throughout the dinner and brought us a complimentary Key Lime Pie for dessert - it was delicious!

Our entrees consisted of Bouillabaisse (my husband said it was the best he&#39;s ever had), Whitefish, Lobster Mac &#39;n Cheese and Lamb Chops - everything was amazing.  We also ordered several cocktails and glasses of wine and enjoyed every one.  I thought their wine list was very affordable and had wonderful choices to pair with everything on their menu,

The icing on the cake was the Vermont Maple Syrup Cotton Candy that we also had for dessert - I was skeptical at first, who would ever think of ordering Cotton Candy for dessert in a restaurant like this?? - that&#39;s carnival food!!  It was so amazingly good - not too sweet but you could taste the syrup flavor.  It was so light and fluffy - we devoured the huge portion in a matter of minutes.

Their &#34;ranked&#34; pizza is not spectacular. Everyone in the group got something different to try and nothing to complain about but not 5stars either.
It was a little loud in the dinning room and for our group of 8 seated at a rectangular table it was difficult to have a conversation without raising your voice. 
Definitely worth a try if you haven&#39;t been. 
The only other complaint I have is they had a coupon flashing on Yelp, if you checked in you could get 10%off. So I did, and it says the coupon must be used in 4hrs of checking in but when we tried it he said we couldn&#39;t use it because it was a Saturday.

He also thought the fries tasted like they were fried in the same oil as the fish.  We ordered the cotton candy and enjoyed it.  It was still warm when it came out and was delicious. The service was good and friendly but I thought she waited a little  too long between the time we finished our dinner to ask if we wanted dessert.

$100 for a meal and you expect it to be at least decent. All vegetables soaked in weird sauces. Salmon just okay. Bland shrimp and lobster bisque. Wife loves mashed potatoes and couldn&#39;t finish what they brought &#34;tasted like they came from a box&#34;. 
Overall 1 star. Don&#39;t recommend, so many better restaurants in the neighborhood. If you want seafood go to Devons. If you want Meat Gibsons. And if you want decent food go almost anywhere else."

My server was extremely attentive and the atmosphere of the restaurant had a nice ambiance. My date and I had the margherita pizza for an appetizer and it was the best I&#39;ve ever had. Onto the entrees- he had the duck and I had the swordfish special. My dish&#39;s flavors exploded in my mouth-each component worked perfectly with the others to create a delicious and exciting meal. I would highly recommend trying Parkers&#39; if you are in the area!

Nice bar with happy hour specials but beware...tables in the bar can be reserved and there may not be room for your group unless you plan ahead. Pluses: Open and classy decor. Not a bad noise level for our group of 6. No yelling across the table needed. Sat by the kitchen and didn&#39;t hear much noise from there either. Service was pretty good. Nice guy, friendly, offered suggestions on apps and dinner as well as wine. Also offered to split salads. Food. Lots of cool apps to chose from. Tempura shrimp yummy. Lobster fritters yummy. Not your standard seafood place. Seems like they are trying to do different/unusual things with the fish. Nice. Presentations are cool too. Tempura battered walleye over fried rice with kimchee. Very tasty. Halibut in a classic beur blanc sauce but with a nice sweet potato mash. Server happily brought extra sauce when asked. Lobster mac and cheese. Cool presentation of whole lobster tail on the side but the cheese sauce was a bit thin and slightly disappointing. Ina Garten (Barefoot Contessa) has the best lobster mac and cheese recipe on the planet! Dessert. Maple cotton candy was enough to satisfy but they have lots more! Bread pudding! Ice cream tower! Eat!!
Minus: A little pricey but oh well, we don&#39;t eat here every night. Service was just a hair slow but then again, we weren&#39;t in a rush and maybe dinner here should take time. Biggest problem, server took the signed/paid for check off the table before we left. If I owned the place that would never happen! Then the server kinda gave us the &#34;rush&#34; to leave. (Odd because no one was in need of our table and it was only 8:30pm.)
I&#39;ll give the place another try. The steaks coming from the kitchen looked really good. Next time."

We started out with appetizers including oysters.  Several of us agreed that the oysters were some of the best we have ever had.   Followed with some lobster bisque soup served with a ravioli and it was very well done and not too rich as others are served.  had the walleye prepared on plank and it had to be one of the best meal dishes I&#39;ve ever experienced.   We all had a dessert which we shared and again very good including the maple cotton candy.....YES....cotton candy.  

Cocktails and wine were very good as was the service.  All you would expect given the prices.

Maybe it was because I wasn&#39;t in a steak mood tonight, so I went with the roasted chicken. It was quite good. Half of a chicken, on top of mashed potatoes and roasted mushrooms and what meal would be complete without bacon? Two beers on the side too.

We chose the restaurant for the name and that it was Open Table-able. I don&#39;t know if I would go back."

I haven&#39;t been here in years and all I kept wondering during my recent visit why that was, as what I found was great food, better service and an ambiance that was conducive to whatever the reason that brought you there be it business, a celebration or just a casual meal.

We were seated promptly for our reservation at a table in the dining room.  It was a cold night so a seat near the fireplace was a welcome gesture.  If you are looking for a more casual ambiance, you can also get the same menu in the bar area.

Our server, Davis, was outstanding, friendly, efficient; just the kind of person who you would like to pull up a chair and join you.  Of course that would have made it difficult for him to take care of us . . .but a girl can dream!

They have specials of the day and on this day one of the specials as a delicious tuna poke appetizer which was great.  We also had some fresh oysters they have both east and west coast) as well as my friend enjoyed some of their creamy clam chowder that was packed with clams.

For our entrees, I had the red king crab and my friend had the surf and turf.  Both were quite good and reasonably priced for the quality of the food.

But the highlight of the meal had to be the dessert.  Can you say, &#34;maple spun cotton candy&#34;?  Holy Cripes!  This thing was every inner child&#39;s dream!  And while it may have put me in a sugar coma for the rest of the night, it was worth every calorie!!

If you drive, and you will cuz this is the &#34;burbs&#34; there is a large parking lot.  Dinner for two with plenty of drinks and dessert ran about $180 but well worth every penny.

Even if you don&#39;t live nearby- Parkers has food worthy of a city location and it&#39;s right in Downers Grove!"

I am happy to report that Yelp did not steer me wrong this night. Got here at about 5:30, still a touch early for dinner but really liked the atmosphere when we got there. For the more upscale dining experience you can take a right and head into the &#34;formal&#34; dining area and for a couple of buddies looking for some great food you can head straight into the bar/lounge area. The piano takes center stage here, unfortunately it went unplayed this night. I faintly remember reading or hearing that they have a pianist in there on Thursdays and some other nights but please don&#39;t hold me to it.

It was happy hour so looks like we were in for some deals. Ended up with the calamari, &#34;spring rolls&#34; and a lobster roll. All half price and ready for the ordering. Service was great, the server was attentive and very helpful in directing us through the menu and the happy hour specials. YELP WARNING though, you get 10% on a check in but it does not apply to the HH deals. 

Calamari was a bit bready but had great flavor. The calamari itself was soft and cooked perfectly, so far so good.
&#34;Spring rolls&#34; were ordered, spring rolls were not necessarily received. Well, nothing like a spring roll that I recognize anyway. There were more like an eggroll but with a meaty, maybe chicken kinda spam-y inner. Not terrible with the sauce but I kinda expected something a bit more refreshing and light, they were over all fine. 
The lobster roll, wow. Couple of things here. The bread was like a taco-esque as a thick piece with a slit in the middle. Toasted with a buttery, crispy exterior and a delicious little nest dug out for the lobster mix held within. Delicious and rich in flavor these rolls are something wonderful to try. They are served with sweet potato fries that were about the size and width of McDonalds fries but with that delicious caramelized sweet potato exterior.

Overall, this place was great. I think pretty much everything ranged between $6-$10 each. The LOBSTER roll was $10.50! Normally $21, very nice!"

I had not complained about the food or the service but was quite upset over an incident with an obnoxious customer in the lounge area , which I had been told went on each week . After my concerns were posted and emailed to the restaurant, I am pleased to say the manager , Heather, contacted me soon after.  She assured me that staff would be retrained,
 as incidents such as the one I had described would not be allowed to continue at Parkers Restaurant  and Bar. At the end of our telephone conversation,  I was also offered an considerable discount on my next visit , which I attempted to decline , as I felt that  the purpose of my  complaint was to let management know how offensive this experience was, not to be gifted in any way.  The manager, Heather , insisted that I accept her offer as well as to request to meet her when we dine at Parkers in the future.   I did take advantage of her generosity.  We  returned to Parkers one Saturday  evening  for dinner and were happy to meet Heather , who spent time with us to , once again , assure us that our unfortunate experience would not be repeated.  Kudos to Heather .  We are happy to continue to keep this restaurant as one of our favorites and one we will recommend to others to enjoy as the food , service and atmosphere are worthy of five stars , in our estimation.  Thank you to the staff at Parkers Restaurant and Bar for giving this tale a happy ending.  


8/13/16 - Parkers has been a favorite restaurant of ours for many years .  In July , we took my father - in -law there for his 96th birthday. My husband and I have been there for dinners out  as well as get togethers with friends.  I have even given him an occasional gift card since he enjoys dining here so much  Service and the quality of the menu have always been excellent.   I doubt we will be back , however considering our experience last Thursday evening.  Since the appetizers always look so good , we decided to go on a week day night to eat in the lounge area and stick to a lighter meal.  A jazz quartet was playing which I was happy to see.  The experience was beyond awful , however.  There was a man there (cannot possibly be called a gentleman)  who may have been inebriated sitting at the next table spouting , loudly, using the f bomb in just about every sentence.  I could not believe that no one spoke to him to bring down the volume as well as the language.  There were other couples there  as well as other diners with their children passing by to use the restrooms.  After a few minutes of this , I made eye contact with him, to no avail.  I waited a little longer and when it became apparent no one was going to speak to this guy, I got up to ask for the manager.  Our waiter noticed I was upset and guided me to the manager who explained to me there was nothing he could do about the situation and his hands were tied since this individual was a regular.  So , Parkers restaurant, which is a four star restaurant , according to some web sites and certainly is not just a bar or inexpensive dining experience allows boorish behavior?  And this is the image they wish to show to their clientele?  Really?  Management should be ashamed."

I have been there many time and have suggested the restaurant to colleagues as well. Unfortunately this last time, our server was terrible. And we all know what bad service can do to your restaurant going experience. 

The host was very friendly, and Tim our bartender was also very helpful. In fact, I wish we would have just avoided being seated in the restaurant and stayed with Time. 

Our server was rude, in a hurry, not helpful and did not have a sufficient knowledge of the menu, or the beer/wine list. He paid no attention to the fact that our guests were from out of town, or that we were there to celebrate my birthday. 

We were all there to order drinks, and try to pizzas. He did not know about the types of beer, or wine list when we asked him questions. He also told us that the only pizza available was the Margarita pizza. When we asked him if there was anyway we could add other ingredients, he said no. there were no mushrooms, no prosciutto, and nothing else available. I am surprised that my fiance, father and brother didn&#39;t just get up and walk out. They told me later that the only reason they didn&#39;t was because it was for my birthday. 

My parents had just been drinking in the bar and told me that there were many other pizzas available, so I went to see Tim who ensured me that we could order any of there pizzas they would just not be half prize because of happy hour. At this point our server had already made it clear in a very rude way that what was on the menu was the only thing available and that nothing could be added. When I confronted him about this, he finally reluctantly let one of our out of town guests add sausage. 

When the food came, we found several hairs in our pizza and coffee. 

It is a shame that this one person was able to ruin what was supposed to be a great night when the rest of the staff was friendly and helpful. 

I wont be back to Parkers, and I will no longer suggest the restaurant to anyone. There are PLENTY of other places with in walking distance that are delicious AND friendly.

He went to the bar to get the menus and a few business men sat down and he forgot about our waters and menu and started to make them drinks... That was kind of a turn off for me...

It&#39;s a Tuesday night, so I figured a reservation was a bit of overkill, but why not?  Plus a bonus...Yelp ad gave me 10% off!  Even though it was an expense account meal, it still felt good.

Walking in can be tricky.  The main doors are in the back of the restaurant, not the front.  Once inside, there&#39;s two seating areas.  A more casual bar area and also a more formal dining room.  Were were immediately greeted, offered options for seating and brought to our table.  The hostess waited patiently for us to all sit before she handed us menus and left the table.  I&#39;d say that&#39;s attention to service detail, especially because it took us a while to get seated.

Once we were seated, the wait staff was fast in greeting us and setting us up with drinks.  Overall, the wait staff was very attentive, very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu.  I like that.

For starters, we had the shrimp tempura and the shrimp cocktail.  Clearly I like shrimp.  And the hot/cold thing was interesting to try.  The shrimp cocktail was excellent.  Quality and size of shrimp was very good and the cocktail sauce has a nice balance and not overpowering.  The shrimp tempura had a thicker breading, which I&#39;m not a fan of.  I would like a lighter breading to not offset the balance of shrimp and coating.

For an entree, I had the duck breast and confit of leg.  It was excellent.  Perfect doneness. High quality meat.  Can&#39;t get any better on the duck preparation.  Highly recommended.  And the waiter helped me finalize that choice, so good for him.

Finally, I had the Caramel Budino.  Once I got through the heavy layer of whipped cream on top, it was very good custard, caramel, and chocolate cookies on bottom.  I think a dessert at a diner can overload it with whipped cream, but not a restaurant of this quality.

Overall, this is a great restaurant for service and food.  They have a few areas on the food front that can be improved, but overall it&#39;s a great experience."

We both have commented to eachother how perfect this place is.   The service is top notch professional and classy with out being rude.   The food is simply amazing!!  I have always ordered a special for that day.   They have a piano bar up front to wait for your seat or you can eat or drink up there.   The dining room is large and broken up into many rooms so it doesn&#39;t get to loud.   
If you&#39;ve never been here I must say put it on your list.   It&#39;s not a place I would bring the kidos...  It&#39;s a better date night or excellent classy lunch visit."

Parker&#39;s always has the best service.  Their waiters and waitresses are so attentive and nice, and are very knowledgeable of the menu (a must!).

I&#39;ll be honest.  I am so obsessed with this place because of their happy hour.  Monday through Saturday, the bar menu is HALF OFF.  I can&#39;t remember the exact hours, but I think it&#39;s something like 3-7...might be different on Saturdays.  AND, oysters are $1 on Mondays and Tuesdays!

My Favorites:

Neapolitan Style Pizzas - especially the classic margherita.  The sauce is light with a little sweetness to it, the crust  has a nice chew to it.  Just make sure you eat it as soon as you get it.  Doesn&#39;t taste as good when it cools down.

Calamari - a STEAL during happy hour, and I would still pay full price for it because the pieces of squid are a decent size while not being overly breaded.  YUM.

Lobster Roll - this one is served warm with sweet potato fries.  Huge pieces of lobster, and you don&#39;t have to travel to the east coast for it...comes down to $10.50 during happy hour.  Not bad at all!

Angus Steak Burger - the flavor is just amazing.  You can tell the quality is very high.  Delicious!! 

A few tips - the sliders are teeny tiny, but if you want to try them, they taste great...you will still want to order something else in that case.

As for the dinner menu, my favorites include: the lobster mac and cheese, the scallops with risotto, and the bone-in-beef short rib.  We&#39;ve also tried nearly all of the desserts, and my personal favorite is the ice cream tower.  But honestly, you can&#39;t go wrong with any of them.  We&#39;ve gone here so many times that I can order nearly anything and leave a happy lady with a full belly!  I don&#39;t care where you live, it&#39;s worth it to come here, if not for happy hour!"

Interior - It&#39;s fairly trendy, but nice here. Wood decor, low lighting, lively looking bar area.
Service - Incredible. We had fantastic service both times; the work function was by far the best service I&#39;ve ever had at a work dinner with a larger group.
Appetizers - Go all out here. The Crab Cakes are fresh and delicious, as were the Blackened Tilapia Won Tons, Margherita pizza tasted better than some Italian joints, and the Oysters Rockefeller were super tasty.
Entree - I opted for the scallops. The scallops themselves were great, but there were only three of them and served on top of unflavorful mush. For $28, I would have expected more than three scallops. 
Dessert - Caramel Budino was incredible.

So you&#39;re probably wondering - why the three stars? Well, the location is working against them. I worked in Downers Grove for almost a year before I realized this restaurant wasn&#39;t associated with what looked like a hotel right behind it. It also doesn&#39;t look anything like a steak/seafood place from the exterior. Most importantly though are the prices &amp; competition: I don&#39;t think the prices are necessarily unfair, but taking into regards all of the competition in the area - Ditka&#39;s, Devon, Harry Carry&#39;s, etc - this is a hard sell. None of the entrees wow-ed me for the prices and they&#39;re up against a tough crowd right around the corner.

I recommend coming to Parkers for appetizers and drinks. I&#39;d give dinner another try though!"

Unexpectedly, I went to parkers with my wife for lunch.  We were wormy welcomed although we were not properly attired for this place - work out clothing.  We had the grilled octopus appetizer, hanger steak, and fish taco special.  Finally, hand made tortilla!  Fish was very fresh and I liked that it was not tilapia.  Hanger steak was well proportioned and very tender and good.  I usually don&#39;t like the hanger cut but this one was yummy.  We are definitely coming back for date night."

The flatbread and hummus they give you prior to ordering is delicious and flavorful. I had the tuna melt with coleslaw. Big!  Crispy crust with melted cheese.

I think I can sum it up by saying I was a bit underwhelmed, although The decor seemed nice and the atmosphere made it look fairly upscale.   I had the beef short rib, and split the baby octopus as an appetizer.  Both were just ok.  Could have been what I ordered but there wasn&#39;t a ton of flavor and the flavors didn&#39;t seem too inspired.  Don&#39;t get me wrong I enjoyed the meal, but for the price that you&#39;re paying, I wasn&#39;t very impressed.

However, the restaurant was redeemed by the manager Rob who realized we were waiting a long time for a table and seated us immediately then provided us with appetizers.

This place is a glorified bar. It&#39;s very loud and the food is not that great. What&#39;s most terrifying is the uneducated wait staff - I ordered a pork chop and was asked how I wanted it cooked!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I gave her a look and said - it&#39;s pork... It should be fully cooked. To which she said &#34;our kitchen offers to cook it to different levels of doneness&#34;... What?!?!? Terrifying. Then I got my pork chop and it was so dried out and overcooked I could barely cut into it... So maybe the waitress should have asked if I wanted it cooked or overcooked. Needless to say, I won&#39;t be back and I sincerely hope no one gets sick from undercooked pork due to uninformed waitresses and/or chefs."

Maybe the vendors I&#39;ve visited out here have kept the good stuff to themselves when they take us out for dinner?

Our server was a bit of a character. After I presented the Yelp 10% Check-in offer, he talked about rave reviews he&#39;s gotten (on Open Table, iirc) and stressed his name a couple of times (which, despite the temptation, I won&#39;t provide here). Still he botched my drink order for a Manhattan twice and was the only staff member running around with his shirt un-tucked. Despite his suck-up to the guests intentions, I found his behavior and demeanor off-putting.

Anyway, ignoring our server, the food was pretty solid. 

The clam chowder (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/parkers-restaurant-and-bar-downers-grove-2?select=Z_U_rKZO5A4gBxNO5hwW_g#Z_U_rKZO5A4gBxNO5hwW_g) had a briney, lightly creamy broth and a couple of shell on Manila clams along with some shucked clam meat.

For my main, I had the Bouillabaisse ($26) which comes in a covered cast iron Dutch oven with a serving bowl (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/parkers-restaurant-and-bar-downers-grove-2?select=JocE7Db5b5LtWZOlfbaqqA#JocE7Db5b5LtWZOlfbaqqA) and another bowl for the shells and discards (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/parkers-restaurant-and-bar-downers-grove-2?select=U2AhYZUTPGyiqW4hYUZXag#U2AhYZUTPGyiqW4hYUZXag) and some Rouille on the side. The copious amounts of seafood was all nicely cooked, though the tomato-ey broth needed something more. It was a big serving and could have easily fed two.

My colleagues had a burger and the surf &amp; turf (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/parkers-restaurant-and-bar-downers-grove-2?select=lf4tQsDzTTH4V7WGryjvbg#lf4tQsDzTTH4V7WGryjvbg) and both thought the food was above average.

When we left @ 8:30 Thursday, there was one party of 2 remaining in the restaurant.

Food: 4 stars
Service: 2 stars"

The lobster mac and cheese, bruschetta with goat cheese and filet were delicious. We didn&#39;t have a chance to try any of their desserts, which is a travesty- but alas, we were too full. The bruschetta was interesting; goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes puts a twist on an old, sometimes a tad mundane, app staple. Now if you hate these two ingredients, I presume you wouldn&#39;t be a fan. I adore goat cheese, and usually can take or leave sun-dried tomatoes, but in this case they worked very well.

I thought the service was excellent. I&#39;m not sure how anyone could say otherwise, to be honest- the wait staff is incredibly attentive- to the point where, the second my husband got up to use the restroom, our server was at our table, diligently refolding the napkin he has tossed on his chair. We truly felt &#34;waited on&#34;, and this should always be the case in an upscale, pricey restaurant.

I will say that if you don&#39;t like the very smokey taste of gouda, you probably won&#39;t like the lobster mac and cheese, but I happen to love it (as you can see, I&#39;m big on the slightly uncommon cheeses), and thought the richness was perfectly balanced by the fresh, ridiculously delicious lobster, which was simply prepared, making the dish unusual but heavenly. I was very surprised at the sheer volume of lobster sitting atop the pasta- and the somewhat low price that included said volume of lobster. I figured a few small shreds may be mixed in, but not so. A rather large tail is hand-placed on your mac tableside. 

I would (and plan to) go back to Parker&#39;s for more special events (and not-so-special events) in the future."

If you order a Manhattan for example straight up as opposed to on-the-rocks they add $3 to the drink charge - without warning.  
So in other words, getting a drink without ice in a martini glass costs three bucks extra.  They have apparently done that to me every time I&#39;ve been there (and to others as well).  I noticed this time as I made the mistake of ordering a special they were having that was advertised for $13.  When I got the bill I saw $16 (WTF!!!!!!!).
That&#39;s right, I paid $16 for one drink.  When I brought this up to the waitress she said the computer automatically adds it.  When I brought it up to the manager she lamely replied that they add more alcohol (so, are martinis $16? Of course not).
So I get a call on the way home.  It turns out they had a computer error, I should only have been penalized for $1 (for removing ice from my drink).  They refunded $2.17.
They have some really good food, the service is not always the best, but I cannot tolerate fraud and incompetence."

We ordered the calamari( enough to share for at least 2). The calamari was fresh and not over cooked. The lobster roll was my favorite! It reminded me of the lobster rolls you could get in Boston (similar, but not exact). They loaded it with lobster and it came with sweet potato fries and coleslaw. It is probably the best one that I&#39;ve tried in the Chicagoland area. The pizzas were decently sized and tasty. I enjoyed the crust, but the toppings were just a tad too salty for my taste. For dessert, we ordered the ice cream tower. This is a MUST TRY if you love ice cream.

One question, if you are a SEAFOOD RESTAURANT HOW DO YOU SCREW UP CRAB LEGS ?!?!? And why is the service so poor. The Bouillabaisse was God awful and the Octopus appetizer was so sparse it barely served one person.

The atmosphere: We sat in the lounge during the lunch hour. It was quiet, quaint, and perfect for the four of us to enjoy our meal and discussion. A little chilly, but we were ahead of the crowd, so perhaps it warms up when the place is packed?

The service: Ignacio was our server and he was awesome! Very attentive, friendly, and appreciative.

I can honestly give this place 5 stars.  Here&#39;s the skinny:

Only about 30 places in the United States are Vera Pizza Napoletana (VPN) certified as producing authentic neapolitan pizza, and Parker&#39;s proudly carries one of those certification.  (Only two places in Illinois as well!)  Knowing that, we made our way here first with a group of six to sample pizzas and other dishes, and then my wife and I came three more times to enjoy some spectacular food.  Key notes:

Pizzas:  We&#39;ve tried a few, but honestly the margherita is still the best here.  A great crust, a bit of sauce, some fresh bufala mozzarella, and a couple leaves of basil.  This is an enlightening and spectacular pizza that models as closely as Naples as possible.  

Lobster roll:  Very fresh tasting, and perfectly cooked... a decent deal if you take advantage of the half price bar menu, but otherwise, you&#39;re definitely paying for the convenience of eating this in Chicago instead of a coastal city where lobster is abundant and affordable.

Fish and chips:  While enjoyable, these were VERY small in size.  Not sure if it&#39;s because of the half price bar menu.  About three finger long sizes of carefully fried fish and well made fries.  This is probably appetizer portions.

Jumbo Maine Sea Scallops:  Great sear on the outside, smooth and creamy on the inside... they&#39;re doing these scallops just right.  The marscapone risotto is a little rich for my tastes, but if you love scallops, I wouldn&#39;t shy away from this dish.

Lobster mac and cheese:  I think the table fought over this one as &#34;nicely&#34; as possible...  it was obvious everyone was eyeing this as their last bite.  Seriously good stuff.  The smokiness of the bacon combined with the bright lobster flavor was memorable.

Bouillabaisse:  Have you ever had Cioppino in San Franscisco?  This is nearly perfectly identical.  If you love seafood, and you enjoy a great seafood/tomato based broth, you will fall in love with this dish, guaranteed.  Generous portions, and I could barely tear myself away from this when I my colleague asked if I would kindly return his dish.

Herb crusted Japanese eggplant:  I rarely say this, but this is one of those dishes that I would be willing to go vegetarian for.  The eggplant has such a perfect crisp, and the flavors along with the gnocchi offer a great balance in the dish.  A great pick.

Braised beef short rib:  Fall apart tender, swimming with flavor, they&#39;ve really turned this dish into perfection.  

We&#39;ve tried four of the desserts in our time visiting, and our clear favorites were:
Ice cream tower - beautiful display, each layer of ice cream was distinct in flavor and delicious.

Key lime pie - While this looks tiny, it&#39;s packed with flavor and covered in a spectacularly made meringue that adds a lot of &#34;density&#34; to it.  Very good stuff.

Carmel Budino and the bread pudding were very good in their own right, but ended up being too sweet for our taste buds afterwards... they were ultimately too rich for our tastes, but if you like your desserts rich and sweet, this may  be perfect for you.

Verdict:  I&#39;ve gone 4 times in the last month.  I don&#39;t think I can give it any higher compliments.  The food here is spectacular, a hidden gem in the burbs.  And it&#39;s been added to our rotation of places we love to go.

Protip:  Want to do Parkers on the cheap?  Mon-Fri, they have half priced bar menu items from 3-7 PM.  You&#39;ll get to try pizzas, apps, and some smaller mains for a VERY affordable price."

During one of the visits the service was a bit on the slow side, although the speed of tonight&#39;s visit was perfect.  We were in and out within an hour without feeling rushed.  The food came at just the right times.  Tonight I had the chopped salad, burger and flour-less chocolate cake - yum!  I have to also give MAJOR kudos to the valet attendant - he was my favorite.  He was very sincere - Acknowledged us quickly, asked how our evening was going, and was very respectful.  Very observant too. I went to put my purse in the back seat before getting into the driver&#39;s seat, but the door was locked - he quickly unlocked the door for me.  Also, ran around and opened the door for my mom.  Thank you!"

The bar was open and happy hour was going on but really just water to grab some dinner and a drink. The hostess and bartender were great! Really friendly.
Looked at the menu and saw seared ahi tuna as the special and the bartender said it was good. So I went with that. It came with some noodles that had shrimp in it and then the ahi sliced. I had a couple issues with it. Didn&#39;t look like the tuna got a good sear on it and it appeared and tasted like it was cooked on a warm pan and left too long trying to get a sear all around... then it was a good chunk of tuna but sliced way too thick. It was only 6 pieces where I think easily could have been 8-9. The noodles didn&#39;t seem to go with the tuna and the whole dish was missing something like some kind of veggies to cut through all the sauce on the noodles and the sweet chili sauce under the tuna. Some pickled cucumbers or some seaweed salad would have been wonderful.  Next time I&#39;m in the Midwest I think I will stick to beef!  Nice place definitely will come back and try something else."

It was just before 5:30 on a Friday afternoon and no seats at the bar and the 5 open tables/ booths had &#34;Reserved&#34; signs on them.  Oh well...I&#39;m just SOL.  Hung out in the foyer like some junior high miscreant until my better half arrived.
When she arrived, we were immediately seated and greeted by John.  We started with the VPN Margherita Pizza which is EVERYTHING it is cracked up to be!  If the meal had ended with just the pizza, this would have been a 6 star review.  I&#39;m glad I perused the Yelp reviews ahead of time and suggested we try the pizza as an appetizer.
My wife ordered the cod which was simply prepared and offered with mashed potatos and vegetables.  She didn&#39;t think it was particularly flavorful.  In fairness, going in, she second guessed why she ordered cod since it isn&#39;t a typically flavorful fish.  I ordered the whitefish welleington which is creatively prepared and presented in a puff pastry in the shape of a fish.  It is stuffed with shitake mushrooms, leeks and pine nuts.   Aesthetically, the presentation was delightful, but it just didn&#39;t spark the tastebuds.  The boldest flavor profile came from the pine nuts.
We ended our meal with Lavazza cappacinos which were served lukewarm.  This was a slight disappointment.  I&#39;m not sure how you can brew up barely lukewarm cappacino.  We had one pizza appetizer, two entrees, 1 cocktail, 4 glasses of wine and 2 cappacinos = $122.  Considering all the booze we imbibed, a fair price.  Just wish the food had more pizzaz.  We&#39;ll probably return at some point"

I believe this location used to be the &#34;rib house&#34;.  I went there years ago.  The set up seems a little different from what I remember, but it&#39;s still an awkward building.  It was most likely a house back in the day, which they turned into a restaurant.  Because of that, the layout is very weird.

I would recommend going to eat the food.  The quality is good, and flavored well.  I got a burger and it was good.  We also got the pizza...loved it.  It is thin crust Chicago style....crispy crust and lots of cheese."

The restaurant is an old house with ample seating. It was chilly, but on warm days there is seating on double-decker balconies in the back! We had the Mediterranean spread sampler with Tzaziki, hummus, and whipped feta. Wonderful flavor!
For the main course I got the steak and steamed broccoli as a side. I am usually VERY picky about my beef, but it was so yummy. Perfectly cooked and flavor explosion. (You can&#39;t really mess up broccoli...). The steak was definitely a highlight, and the owner came around so we got to say thank you. :)

We were the only ones there when we arrived for lunch.  Soon one large table filled up - and completely filled the room with noise.  The could do something to dampen the sound - it&#39;s a very &#34;lively&#34; room in terms of acoustics.

So my family and i were trying to find a place we could go for lent Friday&#39;s (no meat). We usually turn towards either sushi or pizza, and then we remembered a friend who had recommended riganato.  We thought alright well get some pizza, pasta and calamari it&#39;ll be great.  So...

Food- We started off with some fried calamari which was really good, but as I always say, doesn&#39;t take a lot to make a good fried calamari.  However it did come with some garlic aioli which was a plus (more suitable for dipping pizza crust in though).  Now, the pizza. It was amazing.  Literally the perfect pie.  Perfect thin crispy crust, tangy but not too tangy sauce.  Sauce wasn&#39;t too chunky but not soup either.  Cheese was thick but not overpowering.  It was REALLY good.  So we ordered the calamari and the cheese pizza as an appetizer, but then the entrees is where the fell extremely short.  I ordered the bow tie farfalle which came with these grilled shrimps that were cooked perfectly but overseasoned.  The pasta though was inedible.  So much pesto and artichoke it was not even box-able for lunch the next day.  Everyone else&#39;s entrees looked just mediocre...   With mediocre table reactions.  They got us on the mini desserts though and we ordered a bunch and they were decent, nothing too special.  

Service- It was really good and the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice.

Now I realize this is a grill and we went with no meat in mind but if you put something on the menu like a pasta dish it better be as good as everything else plus this is Italian so I didn&#39;t take too much of a risk!!  I might come back for the pizza but probably not."

We were in vacay mode just for the fun of it, plus we had a little birthday celebration attitude going as well.

It turns out, if an overheard conversation is true, that the restaurant is celebrating its third anniversary.

The restaurant has indoor and outdoor dining.  We chose indoor.  Wood floors, simple table settings.  Fresh food pictures on the wall.  (For good reason).

The menu is a single sheet with the usual categories.  

I carefully studied the food that was at other tables--the pizza looked very tempting--so I ordered the pizza with spinach, fresh basil and fresh garlic.  

For the pizza, they don&#39;t fool around, making sure that it&#39;s understood that they are the thin crust folks--great! thin crust folks I&#39;d say.  The sauce was rich in flavor with each ingredient seemingly freshly harvested that day, within the hour.

The birthday one ordered gluten free pasta--the sausage and tomato that came with the order, causing a bit of light sauce that looked great.  And positively reviewed.

Reasonable prices, great, fresh food!  

I&#39;d say wander on over, enjoy a meal, relax and enjoy more.  All is possible at this very enjoyable find."

Riganato&#39;s has one of the most extensive gluten-free menus I&#39;ve seen in the western suburbs. There was a nice selection of chicken, seafood, pizza and roasted entrees for the non-wheaties among us and the menu also included some simpler fare (burgers/sandwiches) for those obstinate family members who refuse to eat fancy. That alone guarantees we will be back, being that my family has Celiacs and picky eaters a-plenty. 

Their otherwise glutinous fare was middle of the road Italian-ish food. I feel like they erred on the side of caution with spicing their sauces, because when things were called &#34;spicy&#34; and &#34;garlic&#34; there were very few hints of those adjectives actually tasted in the food. Be brave with flavor Riganato&#39;s, you have the potential for greatness!

The wine selection was decent, though I was a little put off by the server&#39;s inexperienced at pouring wine. I would rather have poured it myself than watch her maneuver around the table dribbling wine on the bread plates, cutlery and bread.

The only place Riganato&#39;s let us down was the dessert menu. No gluten free desserts. They don&#39;t actually have a dessert menu and instead bring around a dessert tray where nothing is labeled and everything kind of looks the same in Riganato&#39;s mood lighting. Due to the lack of gluten-free options and the server&#39;s complete lack of interest in selling us on the available options, we all opted to skip dessert.

We are probably coming back for the pizza at some point."

Food- When the bread came out it was freshly baked and had a little bit of a charred flavor, which was delightful. I ordered two appetizers: 1. The meatballs were amazing and filled with ricotta cheese. They were perfectly cooked, a delight to the senses. 2. The fried zucchini was very light considering it was a fried dish and I enjoyed it. I Also ordered a chicken rice with vegetable soup and it was very flavorful. For dinner I had a pizza. It consisted of Italian sausage, green peppers, olives, and a nice blend of cheeses. It was to die for and I was very impressed with the sauce especially with a perfect combination if spicy, sweet, and salt. I know it sounds like a fairly heavy meal, but it was extremely light.

Its a converted house with a very small dining room and back porch that is enclosed for seating. 
The service is very good, very sweet waitress and host was pleasant. We started with the octopus which came on a bed of arugula and smothered in raw red onion. It was cold and shouldnt have been as it was grilled. I found it mediocre. Needed flavor and some charing.  
We then had the greek lemon and rice chicken soup and as a Greek I can say it was good. I had to add lemon but I usually do. We then had the kabobs. 
I had the chicken and my date had the beef. Served with a large pita that was black from all the oregano. 
Again, cold. And even though it was drowned in oregano and I mean BAD, it was tasteless. 
It needed salt and pepper and far LESS oregano. Lemon would have been a good addition since its called lemon chicken kabob. 
We both had a mini cannoli for desert which are brought in. Kinda stale. 
I may give this another try even though this wasnt a great experience. Im glad we didnt order the $25.00 lamb shank.

I would dine there more often, but I live about 25 miles east of Geneva. The restaurant is in an old remodeled farmhouse. The last time I was there, they had outside dining on a back porch, but they have since enclosed that area, so they can accommodate more diners in inclement weather. There were 3 of us in the party, and we had lunch. We started off by sharing some appetizers. The baseball size stuffed meatballs are a must. I had them on each visit. We also had the grilled octopus, and the beets. The cocktails ordered were house creations, and very good. Two of us had the lamb shank, and one the lamb chops. The lamb shank was very tender, and the tomato based sauce gave it a great flavor. My girlfriend had the lamb chops, and said they were cooked perfect, just as she ordered them. Side dishes were good. We topped off lunch with some homemade rice pudding. I would rate the whole meal as excellent. The food is very fresh. When I saw the truck in the parking lot delivering fresh fish, there was no doubt. I would consider Riganato&#39;s a Greek-Italian fusion restaurant.

Jimmy and Nick were extremely helpful getting a table of 14 set for us on Mothers Day. The service was incredible. The atmosphere was great. For a table that large you always worry about getting the food out in a timely manner. They exceeded expectations. In fact, not even close. We had most apps and I enjoyed them all. My favorite was the octopus but all were very good. I had a small beet salad and it was one of the best I have had. I had the chicken Kabobs and wow were they good.  I sound like a broken record but not one entree wasn&#39;t great. We unfortunately didn&#39;t try and dessert but I am sure they would have been good as well. Highly recommend this restaurant."

Nice, small, cozy and run by very friendly engaging people who know about their food and are willing to share their thoughts is how I would describe this place.

Char Grilled Octopus
Up there with the best I have ever had. Don&#39;t change this dish.

Jalapeno Gnocchi
I am not sure who is responsible for their Gnocchi but they are very talented. I have had Gnocchi all over and even make it at home and this was the best I have ever had. Love the take on the Pesto with Jalapeno. Don&#39;t change this dish!

Fresh Beets 
Great salad course.

Tortellini Alla Panna
Great texture and Flavor.

Butternut Squash Gnocchi
See Gnocchi review above. Great dish!

We also had 2 make your own pizza&#39;s
I am a pizza lover and like lots of different styles of pizza. While the pizza was good, I probably wouldn&#39;t order it here again. Too many other great thing on the menu and these pizza&#39;s didn&#39;t WOW me like the rest of the food did.

Sampled one of the soups and it was delicious. All made in house.

Owner and Son are very hands on and very engaging as well as the servers.

Love this place and can&#39;t wait to go back and try something different."

The menu has a variety of options and there is something for everyone. I started with the red sangria and it was delicious and quite large! My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs which they are known for and he loved them. The meatballs are stuffed with ricotta cheese. They are the best! I had the Caesar salad and then the lemon oregano kabob. It was tasty but the chicken was a little dry. Our two younger sons were with us. One had the pizza was was really good and the other had a burger. My only complaint was that the kids menu is limited to chicken fingers or grilled cheese. So we had to buy adult entrees for them which they couldn&#39;t finish. That made the dinner out quite pricey. I gave them 4 stars because of the limited kids menu. The service was great!!  We will definitely go back.

It was so good that we went back for a second try solidifying our opinion.  I had the avgolemono soup which was tasty and authentic.  I also tried the chicken kebabs and the beef kebab.  Both were good and the chicken was my favorite.  My colleagues had steak and seafood dishes.  We were all impressed.  The rice pudding could not be better.

We have been there a number of times now and never have been disappointed.  Every time I&#39;ve gone, I&#39;ve had the chicken oreganato sandwich -- absolutely delish!  Luckily, the people I eat with try different things so I get to taste test other things.  We&#39;ve had their pastas, burgers, shish-k-bobs, salads, homemade soups, meatball sandwiches, calamari and breaded zucchini as appetizers and rice pudding and amazing desserts too.  Everything is well seasoned, freshly made and piping hot when you get the food.  You just can&#39;t go wrong.  

The servers are always very friendly and attentive and the owners have always been on site as chefs (I think).  They stop by to thank us for coming back and are very friendly too.  I can&#39;t say enough good things about this restaurant.  Try it for yourself!"

Service was great and even though we did not have a reservation, we were able to be seated immediately. I&#39;d definitely recommend a reservation though, it&#39;s not a large dining room. It was cozy and the tables were quite close together, but the atmosphere was great. Our server was the sweetest person ever and she took great care of us. The food was amazing and very fresh, well seasoned, and everything smelled and tasted as good as it looked. Presentation was fantastic. For a special night out for us, it was well priced and both the food and alcohol menus were varied and extensive. It was a bit difficult to decide what to order, but our waitress was super patient and made sure our experience was top notch.
While it could possibly be kid friendly, I would probably not drag the kids along unless they were older (at least 10+)."

Great service from Stacy!    Appetizers of calamari  (The specialty one) was good, if a little under done.  Had hot peppers.  Good portion size.    Two had pesto with farfale pasta with artichoke hearts - huge portion - pesto was good.    Others had tortellini and squash Gnocchi.  Again, massive portions but very heavy handed, dripping in butter presentation.     Had trout special, smallish filet prepared in too much oil.   Excellent side of grilled vegetables.   Another diner had the steak kebab which was a good value of around $10 - came with very good Greek, lemon cream chicken soup.   Food more like 3.5 stars but service made it 4 stars overall."

However, the food was disappointing.  The flavor on the meat was good, yet it seemed like there is a lack of experience on the grill.  My wife ordered the lamb chops, I got the trio where I had three different meats.  My wife had one chop that was not medium rare, yet very raw where the outside was touched with the heat.  One chop was over cooked and dry and one was just right.  I had the same issue with mine. The grill should have even heat and all the food should be cooked evenly, either all rare or raw, all cooked just right or all over cooked.  This along with the potatoes and rice not tasting right, I had to give it 2 stars."

Had Nick&#39;s Calamari to start, then the bleu cheese burger, opting for the Moroccan carrot and potato soup instead of the fries. The calamari was good - it could have used some more varieties of peppers, but I liked the spice, and I liked the calamari cut big - and not too heavily breaded - not too crispy. The soup was amazing - great spice to it, and very flavorful. My wife had the Greek rice soup and said it was the best she ever had. Our burgers were both cooked perfectly, and the serving size was very generous. Service - outstanding - our water glasses never got empty, dirty dishes removed promptly, and everyone was very friendly. The place was pretty full, but we never felt rushed. Seems to be a family run business, and felt like it - very welcoming. Definitely will return to Riganato in the future!"

I have driven past this restaurant on my way home from the Geneva Metra train station for a couple of years, but never really noticed it until a few months ago.  My husband and I dined there on Saturday, just before 5 pm, so it wasn&#39;t too crowded.  Starting at about 6 pm, the restaurant was just about full.  The food was amazing.  The stuffed meatballs were so flavorful, and the marinara sauce was perfect.  I have found a hidden gem of a restaurant, that I will definitely return back to many many times.  The desserts are catered in.  They are small mini desserts.  They offered several varieties.  This isn&#39;t the place to go to just for dessert, this is definitely the place for a great Italian meal.  I would suggest going somewhere else for dessert----Dairy Queen is across the street, if ice cream is your pleasure. The owner was the host, and gave us a full sized Reese&#39;s Peanut Butter chocolate candy bar when we left the restaurant, he said it was for Halloween...did I mention that it was a FuLL sized candy bar....very nice touch!"

Although the food was average the service and restaurant policies were below average. My waiter acted as I was inconveniencing him in some way. And when my son asked to order a &#34;side or house&#34; salad in addition to his meal the waiter said they didn&#39;t have side salads and that if he wanted a salad we would have to order the big &#34;entree&#34; salad along with his meal. So I asked if we could then substitute his side orders for a small salad (since obviously they do have lettuce in hand!). We were told no. Restaurants owners that can&#39;t accommodate their patrons with something as simple as a side salad shouldn&#39;t be in the service industry.

I know there&#39;s a couple of not so great reviews about this spot but trust me don&#39;t believe them. 

If you want great authentic Italian food this is the spot to come get it at, and it gets better -they are not over priced. 

They have great customer service. Jimmy is great!

Ok so lets get down to the food. I&#39;ve been here three times since I discovered this gem and I&#39;ve yet to be disappointed by anything that&#39;s been served.

Spaghetti and meatballs -to die for!!! I&#39;ve ordered this all three times. Today they had a special with one meatball, Italian sausage, and penne pasta. My boyfriend loved it so much he asked our server to please keep this on the menu permanently! Lol 

Lamb chops and chicken- I&#39;ve never been to crazy about lamb chops
 but these were awesomely delicious! Chicken was juicy and flavorful.

Gnocchi is rich and a must try! 

Pizza by far the best pizza I&#39;ve ever had ( no lie) seriously this is the perfect pizza - the crust is so crispy and the sauce is just the perfect flavor! 

Hmmmmm.... What else.... Oh yea their bread they bring out at the beginning of dinner I can&#39;t even describe other than perfect. However be careful , it&#39;s so delicious that you may end up filling up on it! 

Calamari  and saganaki are our favorite appetizers . 

So yea I obviously will definitely be coming back to this place as long as they are in business. If your a fan of great food and awesome friendly service this is a place you definitely want to go to! I know there&#39;s a couple of reviews that weren&#39;t all that great but who knows what really happened . Give this place a try you won&#39;t regret it !!!"

Atmosphere was not good - lighting was too bright - felt I was dining in the light level of your average grocery store or Walmart.   Not relaxing or inviting at all.   The tables were crammed into the dining room and uncomfortably close - difficult to get into your table without nearly asking the adjacent diners to please scoot in.  Another weird thing was that the tables by the windows had white tablecloths, but then most of the other tables did not (including ours).  Did we not deserve a white tablecloth?   The chairs and tables had a dated feel and the decor in the place was very generic and cheap looking, and a white table cloth on all the tables would have classes the place up some.  This contributed to a general sense of amateurism and lack of taste in the decor and the general execution of the restaurant.  

We ordered some white wine and it was ice cold -  don&#39;t restaurants like this realize that whites need to be served 42-50 degrees in most cases?  The food was mediocre.  Daughter had to order a full size cheese pizza because they didn&#39;t have a kids personal pizza on the menu.  I had the signature baked chicken dish that was decent.  My wife had some pasta that was bland and uninspired.  

Service was uneventful and adequate.  Price was actually high considering the lack of atmosphere and mediocre food.  Overall a giant &#34;meh&#34; and we won&#39;t be returning."

I had the CAPRESE BURGER. It was cooked just the way I like it. I had the option to get soup instead of fries and it was the best Greek soup ever!

Always had a wonderful meal at a very reasonable price!  It&#39;s refreshing to eat at a great family restaurant that&#39;s not a chain!  Our favorite dishes include Nick&#39;s Calamari, Meatball sub, Chicken Riganato (with garlic smashed that are to die for), Ribeye Kebobs, I could keep going...

I kept thinking I wanted to write a review, but what finally prompted me to do so was after I held a surprise party for my husband here last week.  I emailed Jimmy - chef and owner - about a month before.  He handled everything so gracefully and easily over email - helping me pick the menu, seating, etc...

We arrived that night to find an extra couple had arrived - Jimmy swooped in like it was no problem and added another table, turning our party of 16 into 18.  I arrived with my husband about twenty minutes after everyone else.  They were all enjoying hummus, fresh bread and drinks when we arrived.  Then the food started flowing - stuffed peppers, calamari, friend zucchini - all amazing!  It was all piping hot and fresh.

We had two salads come out next - Caesar and the House.  Both were phenomenal and I would have been happy to complete my meal at this point.  Next up were four amazing entrees.  I wish i would have taken photos to show the quantity of food - it was incredible!  We had flat iron steak, spaghetti and meatballs, chicken Riganato, and a spicy sausage pasta.  Each one was better than the next.  We also had mixed veggies and potatoes.  Every couple left with at least one container of leftovers - we left with five!

We had an assorted tray of desserts - I honestly can&#39;t tell you how they were - there was no way I could fit one more bite in but they looked delicious.

Bottom line - from start to finish - this was the easiest party I&#39;ve ever planned.  Everyone raved about the food.  The service was exceptional.  I would not hesitate to recommend Riganato&#39;s to anyone - seriously, an A+ experience!"

We were again happy with the service and food.  One of the specials was a Sea Bass dish which they de-boned right at the table, which I thought was a nice touch.  I had the horseradish cheeseburger with fries, and the kids (5 &amp; 4 yrs) split a classic cheeseburger with fries.  Overall, the food was above average and my wife told me that the fish was very good without trying it.

     We did not get dessert and she had the only glass of wine through dinner.  The bill was again around $50 for the four of us without really getting any alcoholic drinks, milk, or juice for the kids.  
 
     We really like this restaurant due to it&#39;s small cozy feel.  The fireplace was going and the head chef was walking around the restaurant talking to several different tables and taking finished plates away.  It&#39;s a nice change from going to the regular chain restaurant spots."

My youngest and I split the chicken kebob(the Spicer one) and a pepperoni pizza - both were delicious!  My husband had the chicken pesto pizza and he loved it. The restaurant is on the small size so reservations might help although it was Saturday night and we had no wait.  Karen our waitress was awesome and the young lady refilling water&#39;s kept our water&#39;s filled to the top.

Others in my party had the pork chops and spaghetti and meatballs and everyone seemed happy with their pick. 

Two words of advice: 1. you NEED a reservation over the weekend at least. The restaurant is too small to really accommodate walk-ins and there is no waiting area except for outside. 2. ask for oil and parmesan with the warm bread. They serve it with butter but when we asked for another loaf of bread, they then asked if we would like a plate of olive oil and parmesan. Yes! It&#39;s really good olive oil. They also do not offer parmesan when the meal is dropped off, which I would expect with pizza and spaghetti. But they will bring it if you ask.

Overall very enjoyable!"

I really wanted to like this place, but never had the chance.  Let me explain.

A friend and I had wanted to try Riganato for a couple of years.  Tonight was the night.  With spring in the air and a grumbling tummy, everything seemed right.

We arrived at 6:20 this evening and an older woman with blond hair told us that it would be a 25-minute wait.  I did not relish sitting around.  After waiting in the almost nonexistent waiting (cramped and two chairs) area for a couple of minutes, she asked us if we wanted a cocktail and to wait on the deck.  We declined the cocktail, but took the deck.  After fifteen minutes waiting out there, with blaring music and an ever stronger breeze, I decided to take a brief walk through the adjoining residential neighborhood.  My friend is the type of person who thinks nothing of agreeing to wait 45 minutes to an hour for any old type of restaurant.  I cap it at 10-15 minutes.  I was trying to be compliant and patient.

As I made my way back to the deck, I can see the blond woman summoning my friend.  She takes us back to the waiting area--not to a table.  At this point it becomes clear that SHE IS SEATING PEOPLE NOT BY WHEN THEY ARRIVED, BUT BY MATCHING UP THE WAITING PARTY TO THE SIZE OF THE JUST OPENED APPROPRIATE, AVAILABLE TABLE.

My friend politely asked how long it would be and also pointed out that the party just seated had arrived at least twenty-five minutes after we had.  She simply admitted that she was matching party size to available table and said &#34;it may be a few minutes more.&#34;  

With that, friend and I decided to get the hell out.  Blondie acted surprised.

The food smelled great and the menu tempting, but that type of hospitality will not entice me to come back.  In addition, seated is limited and with the fireplace roaring on a spring night, it was pretty stuffy with all the bodies in there.

Hospitality that horrible does not deserve a second chance.  We went back to Gemato&#39;s in Naperville.  Always a winner."

We had the small pizza and a ribeye kebob.  This is a thin crust pizza. It was very cheesy and an excellent choice.  The ribeye kebob was one of the best meals I&#39;ve ever had.  The service was excellent and simply topped off a great dining experience."

Owner and his son were VERY accommodating. Wait staff was excellent. Food was outstanding. This restaurant should be on your top 2 or 3 in the Tri City area! Everything they touch here is homemade and you can taste the difference. It&#39;s true Mediterranean, so you get some great authentic dishes that aren&#39;t on anyone else&#39;s menu.

We came because we love grilled octopus, which isn&#39;t easy to find on any menus in and around Geneva and St. Charles. We will certainly go back !   The grilled octopus was really good.  I also ordered a salad of fresh beets and feta cheese.  It was really, really good.  Both orders were generous and very fresh. 
My husband ordered penne pasta, and felt the pasta was a bit over cooked and not as spicy as he would have liked.  I ordered the rib eye steak and I was sorry because it wasn&#39;t great and I was already full.  I won&#39;t order so much next time.
We both enjoyed the restaurant and will go back."

I can honestly say this was the first time I ever had been disappointed in a &#34;yelp-worthy&#34; journey. 

The atmosphere was warm and quaint and set the stage for what we thought would be a great meal. First, the staff took forever to get to us...all night...the 4 of them were apparently swamped by the 15 tables. Slow and inattentive is the best description.  

The menu was varied but no theme, we had read the meatballs and pizza were king. Well the meatballs were good but the pasta tasted like it was chef boy-r-dee. Not rustic, no flavor and overly sweet. The pizza was looked forward to but when it arrived we couldn&#39;t taste anything but the oregano, all of the other toppings were drown out...oregano was the flavor...that&#39;s it. 

Finally we were blown away with a check for over $200 because of mistaken entries. When I questioned it the server asked, in honest shock, if I was surprised it was so cheep and not $100 more. What?!?!

I may go back, but no over priced drinks and we are going to stick to the sandwich part of the menu. The one bright spot was a complimentary cocktail. The disappointment was great, but perhaps worth a shot again once they work out the bugs."

The closing of the Rib House was a shock, but we were happy to hear that something was in the works there.  Watched as the place was gutted and rehabbed top to bottom, and then finally some months ago a sign appeared.  Today it was time to visit.

We took two friends with, and upon entering were very impressed with the new design and decor--they did an excellent job and it was very warm and inviting with lots of light.  The interior, while still not spacious, has a much more open feeling now.  There is, as before, outside seating on the south side of the restaurant.

But it&#39;s all about the food.  I was hungry and asked the server for guidance between the Chicken Riganato or the Citrus-Seared Pork Chops (3).  She recommended the chops, and am I glad she did.

Dinner began with warm, crusty bread which we devoured (and asked for seconds).

When dinner arrived, my chops were grilled just perfectly and very moist, and served in a wonderful sauce of herbs, tomatoes and white wine reduction.  I got the lemon-oregano roasted potatoes as a side and they were perfectly done and quite tasty.  The iced tea was very flavorful (not the bland stuff that comes out of the soda dispenser).  My wife had the Wild Atlantic Salmon; it was as good as any other place but not distinguished in any way and lacked any grilled flavor.  The others in our party had Tortellini Alla Panna (a sample bite was very tasty) and the char-broiled pork chops (also 3).  His chops were perfectly grilled and he was quite pleased with the flavor and doneness.

After dinner we shared two small servings of Tiramasu and Red Velvet cake; both were very tasty.

The tab for four dinners, dessert and refreshments (no alcohol) was about $75 with tax.

A &#34;heads up&#34; that the sandwiches are VERY reasonably priced, so we&#39;ll definitely return to try lunch.  The dinners we had are pricey enough to be reserved for special occasions, but it&#39;s nice to have such good quality so close by and we are eager to return and try other selections.

So to wrap it up, three excellent dinners, one OK dinner, and excellent service.  We&#39;ll be back!"

The menu looked decent, the prices seemed fair, but the reviews were a bit mixed.  In the end, the good reviews plead their case well and we decided to give it a shot.  Suffice to say, I am very glad we did.  

It was nighttime and on our first pass, we drove right by, not even recognizing that this spot was the location where the old Rib House was a number of years back.  

We walked in the front door and I was actually quite surprised that the restaurant is incredibly small.  I was expecting a much larger venue.  Perhaps 11 or 12 tables in all, and every one of them seemed full.  Figuring that a lengthy wait was in our future, I inquired with the hostess to see how long of a wait it would be.  I was quite happy when she said probably no more than 5 minutes.  In less than that time, we were seated at a nice table adjacent to the fireplace.  

Menus were presented, water glasses were filled, and white linen napkins were available.  All good so far.  

The menu contains a very diverse selection, from steaks to seafood, pizzas and burgers.  Prices are very reasonable.  The drink list was on the reverse side of the menu and contained an assortment of cocktails, wine and beer.  I felt the drink prices were a bit on the high side, so I opted for an iced tea.  I don&#39;t mind enjoying a cocktail or a glass of wine with dinner, but I know liquor costs quite well and if the prices are too high, I let it sit on the shelf.  

Our table ordered an assortment of different menu items so that we would have a variety of items to try.  A salad, a pizza, steak kebabs and a pork tenderloin were among the items we chose.  

I did not try the salad, but it looked fresh and crisp and there were no complaints.  I ordered the steak kebabs which came with french fries and tzatziki sauce.  Knowing that the average kitchen usually over-fires kebabs because the veggies take longer than the meat, I ordered mine medium rare and planned on accepting the dish if it arrived medium.  Sure enough, they came out very medium.  I wasn&#39;t overly upset about it and they still tasted just fine, but just be aware that if you are expecting your beef at a certain temperature, you may want to consider ordering one temperature lower.  In any case, the flavor was very good and the tzatziki sauce was obviously homemade (which I later verified).  

I tried the pork tenderloin and found it to be excellent.  It came with a side of garlic mashed potatoes which were equally delicious.  

I also tried a piece of the pizza and found it to be terrific as well.  Thin cracker crust and the toppings all had good flavor.  

The dessert tray came around and I chose a rice pudding.  Another member of our party chose the tiramisu.  I was a little bit disappointed that they did not have any whipped cream for the rice pudding.  Fortunately, the rice pudding was obviously made in house and was still very good, but would have been better with some whipped cream.  

About half way through our dinner, the place cleared out, rather abruptly I might add.  It seems that they have a rather busy dinner hour and then it gets a bit quiet.  If you can dine at off hours, you will likely walk right in and be seated.  If you arrive at a busy time, I could see where a wait could be possible. 

Ordinarily, I would give them five stars, but I am withholding that last star for a couple of minor reasons, all of which are easily remedied if management chooses to do so:

1.My iced tea was cloudy, which is one of my pet peeves.  If they don&#39;t cool the iced tea properly, it will be cloudy, and sure enough, cloudy it was.

2.I felt the portion size of our meals was a bit small.  They could easily raise the price of the meals by $1 across the board and lower the bar menu a little bit to balance things out.  It would have been nice if the kebabs were served with a nice rice pilaf or something.  As it was, I received just one smallish kebab, a few fries and a side of tzatziki.  I couldn&#39;t help but notice a lot of vacant real estate on my plate when it arrived tableside.  Further, if the drinks were priced a bit better, I would have had a cocktail or two.  

3.Rice pudding should always be served with whipped cream, or at least it should be available upon request.  As it was, there was allegedly no whipped cream in the restaurant. 

4.The menu is a piece of legal sized paper, printed on both sides.  I felt the paper menu sort of cheapens an otherwise excellent, quasi-elegant experience.  

On the plus side, the food was excellent.  The service was excellent.  The menu is diverse.  The meals were prepared in a timely fashion.  The staff was most friendly.  And for having such a surprisingly small dining room, the ambiance, complete with fireplace, was very warm and inviting.  

You really owe it to yourself to give this little gem in Geneva a try.  I will certainly be back sooner rather than later."

It&#39;s also nice to have a restaurant of its caliber on the East Side of Geneva. Not much at all to write home about east of the river, restaurant-wise.

Mom, Dad and I went to Riganato for a Thanksgiving eve dinner, and it was excellent. Being a resident of Chicago, the affordable prices were a welcome change of pace for me.

My mom had the huge meatballs, and loved them. Dad ate the pork tenderloin and mushrooms, and I went for the spaghetti with mussels. Delicious all around. Also got a great bottle of red for a reasonable $22.

What we appreciated the most was the personal attention we received. The waitress, the manager and the chef all stopped by at different times to ask how we enjoyed our meal. And then the waitstaff allowed us to take our time, continue conversing, and finish our wine while the rest of the restaurant was closing down. We didn&#39;t feel rushed, and we felt like our business was truly appreciated. We will definitely be back again."

The son was very polite and the woman that was working there offered me a chair to sit on while we were waiting in the lobby.

Based on the recommendations from Yelp, I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The food was absolutely delicious. However, simple touches of asking if you&#39;d like parmesan cheese would be welcomed. My friend ordered the tortellini with grilled chicken breast. Since we were going to split the items, our server kindly offered to do this for us in the kitchen. It arrived in two separate bowls - how wonderful. The food portions are generous. 

My first bite of pasta and meatballs was absolutely divine. The tortellini was just as wonderful and the cream sauce was light and flavorful. The food passing our table looked just as inviting, especially the pizza, hamburgers, salads and lasagna. 

The hostess/owner was warm and gracious, as was the servers. We ended our meal with the small taste of red velvet cake. It was also delicious and just the right amount of sweet. The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get too.

My husband and I tried them for the first time at Geneva&#39;s Festival of the Vine.  They are huge, like the size of a billiard ball, and stuffed with ricotta cheese.  Oh, they are delectable and the marinara they&#39;re in is fantastic.

Riganato&#39;s is an old home renovated into a restaurant. The outside is meant to represent the Mediterranean with pink stucco siding.  Inside, it&#39;s homey and warm with about 10 tables, many of which were filled when we dined on a Thursday night.

The servers all seemed very friendly.  You get bread right away (ours came with a previously opened butter package, however).  We got the meatballs to start and they were to die for all over again.

I got the evening&#39;s special for my meal.  It was a penne pasta with salmon and capers, and it was just okay.  My husband got the tortellini with chicken, and the cream sauce was pretty bland.  For dessert we split a tiny (tiny!) piece of cake.

The price was decent: just over $60 for an appetizer, a bottle of wine, two entrees, and a small dessert.  We decided that next time we go (because we will go again) we will get the meatballs for sure, and then for our meals we will each get the spaghetti with the stuffed meatballs!

My preference would be for them to make up their mind and be either Greek or Italian rather than somewhere in between. Very small which offers an element of quaintness.  The staff was very friendly and responsive even though the place was full. As mention,  they are small,  maybe 12 tables so there may be a wait on Fri/Sat night. i had pork chops and rice pilaf.  Chops were good but smothered in  tomatoes.  The odd thing was that the were cut the size of salad tomatores rather than diced so as they would &#34;melt&#34; when cooked.  The  rice was average at best. I&#39;m not even sure if it was the correct rice for pilaf. My wife had roasted chicken which was over seasoned with salt. It was also more boney than meaty. So as I said, not sure we&#39;d go back. Not so much due to quality but there are other options so nearby that deliver a better experince overall. Torn on giving 2 or 3 stars but since I&#39;ve only been there once,  I&#39;ll give benefit of the doubt and give 3."

The menu was a welcomed surprise with a very diverse menu. My family got a nice sample of the menu. From the pizza to the kabobs to the talapia. Everything was delicious. 

I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect when I walked into the location, but without a doubt, these guys will be successful. The staff was very friendly. The owner went out of his way to introduce himself. And it is just the nice little touches that go a long way in repeat business. 

I will be back and very much look forward to trying some of the many other options on the menu."

From the very beginning the staff has treated me and my family like we are their family. We have tried just about everything on the menu. The dressing on the chopped salad is insanely good. I would buy it if they ever bottled it! The burgers are filling and nothing like the ordinary burgers that you can get anywhere. The chicken Riganato is by far my favorite! Finding out that it is the owners grandma&#39;s  recipe was nice to see that the family heritage is represented on the menu. My husband loves the lamb chops and they are an awesome value. I only eat red meat once a week so I come here for the flat iron steak. I love the pepper butter stuff that they put on the special. 
I have brought my friends and family here on many occasions, some special and some special only because we were all together. My aunt from Villa Park loves coming to Geneva for a tasty meal with me. My son loves having dinner or lunch here whenever he is in town. 
I gave it four stars because there is  always room for improvement.  
Keep up the great job, Jimmy and Staff!"

Overall, we had a very good experience.  The newly remolded restaurant looked great, especially as the &#39;Rib House&#39; which was at this location previously was showing its age.

We were seated right away,  really enjoyed the outside seating option.  

Bread was brought right away and was piping hot!  Unfortunately the butter was in the plastic (peal off top) type and was rock hard.

We ordered soft-drinks which were pricy, but included free refills.  We ordered the Saganaki as an appetizer... The waitress set it ablaze and then tried to immediately put out the flame with the lemon juice.   This left a lot of Alcohol left on the dish and it was a bit &#39;wet&#39; with alcohol.  I prefer mine to burn off a bit more.  The Saganaki was tasty, and was crispy on top... but had no form.  it was if it had melted away underneath the top.

I ordered the special, which was a portobello and cheese stuffed ravioli with marinara sauce and broccoli florets.  The marinara tasted AMAZING!  The broccoli was just fantastic... the protobello and cheese tasted very good, but was cold inside the ravioli.

Ordered dessert and I had the rice pudding.  It was pretty middle of the road, but satisfying.

Overall, the tastes were very good and the portions were large.  The prices were also very good for the amount of food.  

Overall, we had a very good experience, and will be back again."

All was very tender and moist, very flavorful.

Locals watched as slowly the run down facade of the restaurant took shape and excitedly, we waited for the new place. Those of us close to the Rib House were eager to see Riganato. We went the first night, knowing there would be some kinks and issues. 
The service moved like molasses and not because of first night jitters, they looked like there was just no fire under them to hurry. If your familiar with the building, its a very small place, there&#39;s not a lot of tables. But they didn&#39;t seem to be rushed or apologetic in any way for the delays. It took about 15 minutes for a waiter to come to our table. Our drinks took about 15 minutes. Dinner took about 20-25 minutes, and getting the check and paying took a surprising 15 minutes. For burgers, dinner lasted 2 full hours.
I decided to play it safe on the food and ordered a blue cheese burger. it was fine - I couldnt taste the meat, it lacked seasoning, but I love the flavor of bluecheese and there was plenty of that. The fries were soggy. 
My husband ordered the horseradish burger. he said it was flavorless. His fries were also soggy.
Our friends ordered a the Marie G pizza (I believe it was called that?) and the &#34;chicken&#34; on the pizza was actually lunchmeat!! So weird! Flavorless, too. The other friend ordered tortellini - they definately had that store bought bland quality and the sauce was rich and flavorless. 
Ok, So i can forgive the lack of flavor in the food - the kitchen is probably getting used to cooking the menu. one would assume it will improve.

But what will actually keep us from ever returning is the owner&#39;s lack of responsbility and welcome to the patrons who were not her friends and family. For the entire evening I watched the owner chat with tables she clearly new on a personal level and for a good chunk of time they sat with what I believe was immediate family - at a table. I spilled an entire glass of water on the table - the clutz I am, and though its noone&#39;s responsbility to clean it but my own, it went unacknowledged by any staff member until we flagged down the &#34;bread and water&#34; guy who didn&#39;t understand I needed towels to soak the water up and at first brought us linen napkins (which dont absorb anything). Finally, he brought the towels and I was able to clean it up. The owner was just two tables down from us and I felt a little surprised that she didnt acknowledge or offer to help. 
Later in our evening another family she knew came in with a baby a little younger than my own. While my baby&#39;s carseat sat on the floor the whole time while I held her, the owner immeidately offered a high chair flipped over where the carseat for her friend could sit - I was never offered assistance for my child. 
I guess I could try to forgive all of that, but the overall lack of acknowledgement for those patrons that they weren&#39;t familair with was an indication of poor business practice to me. I expected at a grand opening that the owner of the place would greet everyone and check in on the tables (especially since there arent that many!) But we never met her or her husband. I was insulted that it appeared to me that her friends and family were more important. My husband was familair with the old Rib House and looked forward to talking with the new owners. They just never came over to say hello."

So had to ask him for a napkin. Then my husband had to ask for a fork for his salad. The server had never brought us the famed bread.

The food here is bar food, nothing special. Decent pizza, nothing special. The chips were poor quality, similar to a generic tostitos brand.

The service was really good. We had attention from the owner more than once during the visit. We had no trouble getting our glasses refilled promptly and the food was served hot. 

The calamari was nice. I enjoyed that it was freshly battered and the accompanying marinara sauce was tasty.  Mom and I split an Italian beef sandwich and fries and a chicken Parmesan sandwich. They even split it for us, so that was a plus. The food was really good. Fresh cut fries. We wanted to try a few things so this was a good way to go about doing so.

When I decided to add bacon they said they can&#39;t do the special so they charged the regular 8 bucks plus added 2 bucks for bacon. So the grilled cheese was 10 bucks!!!

This past time I got the spinach and artichoke dip and the homemade chips with bleu cheese dressing. The artichoke dip was standard but very delicious, and the toasts that accompanied it were perfect. The homemade chips with bleu cheese were OUT. STA. NDING. Everyone at my table wanted a sampling when they arrived and we all obsessed over how delicious they were. Just typing this now, I want them again. And they were like $6 for an ENORMOUS portion.

My husband and I stopped in Saturday night for the St. Patty&#39;s day special (Corned Beef and Cabbage) and to check out the place for a future gathering of friends and family.

We were not disappointed!  The server was pleasant and for the most part always around and refilling our soft drink and coffee. He kept tabs on our appetizer time and checked in with us. My only two critiques of the server was that he did not ask if we needed anything when the food was delivered and a few times my coffee cup was empty for a period of time before I flagged him down for a refill. He was better at refilling my husbands water and soft drink.

The Corned Beef and Cabbage was a massive platter.  The corned beef was delicious.  You didn&#39;t need a knife to cut it. The potatoes, carrots and cabbage were good.

The side salad before the meal would have been better if it were served on a rimmed place or less lettuce.  My salad was falling off the plate.  Additionally, the salad would be better if the lettuce were romain or mixed/  I had the blue cheese dressing, however it&#39;s taste was lost on the iceburg lettuce.

My husband ordered a pizza and it was delicious.  Another server even whispered in my husbands ear that all pizza&#39;s were 1/2 half off on Sunday evening.  Go to Know.

We were offered dessert, but we were plenty full.

- Pizza is just OKAY.  Sorry, it is not that great. Try Garibaldi&#39;s in Hoffmann Estates for that.

- Various other food items I have had = JUST OKAY.

- Burgers - JUST OKAY.  Fries were decent as I remember.

- Nachos - literally small Tostito chips out of the bag and basic Gehl&#39;s cheese sauce (which is near tasteless). You could make better at home with the cheap ingredients from your grocery store.  Across the street at John&#39;s restaurant, they have about the best nachos I have had.  Complete night and day from what you get here.

Haven&#39;t been here in awhile and I am in no rush to go back.  The place is just OKAY - it is really just another run-of-the-mill sports type restaurant and bar.  Years ago, it used to be kiddie-corner across the street and was known as the Winfield House, which had a much different atmosphere than a trendy sports-bar.  Winfield House closed/moved and became Caliendo&#39;s around 2004-ish.

Came here while waiting for my mom to be discharged from CDH. Ordered an iced tea and mushroom and sausage panzarotti.  Got my tea.  And eventually some bread. And a mushroom and sausage thin crust pizza. 20 minutes more to fix it so I just kept the pizza. It was ok.  Never asked me how it was, never brought a refill.  The waiter&#39;s response was &#34;My bad on that order.&#34; Ya think?? Order came to $10 and change.  Funny, my change back was $10, he brought me 2 5s.  Yeah, good luck with that..."

Went to the carryout side because I saw their sign that said &#34;Pizza Slices&#34;. Once I got inside and took a look at their menu I wanted to try everything! I ended up going with &#34;The Godfather&#34;, a warm pressed sandwich with layers of capicola, salami and mortadella with provolone on focaccia bread. It was soooo good!! It was more than I expected. The meat was piled on, the cheese was gooey and the bread was warm and soft. It came with a hefty side of homemade potato chips. For a quick lunch. It was more than enough and definitely satisfying. I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

Ive never yelped before, but I made an account just to tell about this experience.  My family arrived and the place was dead.  The lady that sat us was completely uninterested and was rude to her tables. But halfway through our meals after overhearing her being berated by a manager somewhere out of sight but well within ear shot I could understand.  
The food was very late, we waited over thirty minutes.  At one point we were the only people there so whats taking so long? My eggplant was awful. Over cooked and had the texture of a sandal. I told the waitress and she removed the plate but never offered a replacement! Fine, Ill save my appetite for johns or union house, heck even 7 11 has better quality food and service. Constantly had to flag someone down for refills. EVERYTHING was dirty and had a used and abused type of film on it. From menus to the table itself.

Will not return."

They start you with a delicious loaf of warm bread and butter, which is always a plus for me. I ordered the spinish salad. It was a basic salad, but hit the spot for me. Plus, their ranch dressing was delicious which is super important to me. :) I ordered my one year old daughter a cheeseburger from the kids menu. I figured it would be a typical gross hamburger that you normally see on kids menus, especially since it was only $3.75. It turned out to be a full sized, yummy cheeseburger and fries. Great deal! My hubby fulfilled his craving of the crab legs. He said they were pretty meaty and good. 

The staff was really pleasant as well. The manager was very interactive and our server was nice and attentive.

I had my choice between the hitman (giant burger) or the wise guy (4lbs calzone). I opted for the calzone because it was listed at 4lbs and I had 30 minutes to complete it. A feat I have done in the past at different restaurants. Long story short it took me 33 minutes to finish a 5lbs precooked weight (4.5 lbs cooked weight) calzone. Was it tasty? Yes. Was it something you find at every restaurant? No. Would I order it again knowing that it weighs more than what is listed on the menu? No. I would have opted for the hamburger challenge instead. 
Go ahead and say what you will for food challenges and the fact I am complaining about a half a pound of food but until you try a challenge you will not realize how much food a half a pound is. 
I say 3 stars
So back to the restaurant my wife ordered the sausage and peppers and loved it. Portion was good, taste is good, and quality of food was good. 
She says 5 stars
Final thoughts: clean restrooms and friendly staff and managment. I would say this place is a solid 3.8 rounded up to a 4. Thanks for reading."

That was not the case on Friday nite. We arrived about 6 PM and the place was only about half full. Our waiter took ten minutes to greet us and brought no water or bread, had to ask for both after we placed our order. My wife had the special Fish fry and I had the Spaghetti with sausage. In the past the dinners came with soup and salad, now we had to pick one or the other. My wife mentioned that the fish looked smaller then in the past and it took forever to get another piece which seemed like it was sitting around under the heat lamps. My spaghetti was fine but the sausage was not very hot. Also had to twist the waiters arm to bring out refills on the drinks. When he brought out the check he kind of threw it on the table. When we arrived this waiter seemed to have a friendly conversation with another group, like he knew them, and we where cramping his style. I won&#39;t mention his name but it began with Mi!

This is a small place with maybe 10 tables on the dining side and a great bar side.  We ate on the restaurant side.  Most of the menu items are around $7.  We ate a lot.  First there were stuffed mushrooms and bruschetta for appetizers.  The bruschetta was great, the stuffed mushrooms ok.  They had some kind of yellow cheese on them and it just didn&#39;t work for me.

Hubby had make your own burger which he said was great, but he got lettuce and no tomato.  You had to ask for a tomato which we found kind of weird, but whatever.  I had the whitefish which had a great sauce on it and it came with a salad.

Whenever I go out, I get dessert.  It&#39;s part of my dining experience.  The dessert choices here are pretty limited which disappointed me.  They had gelato, tiramisu and ice cream with a variety of toppings.  I wanted maximum chocolate, but there wasn&#39;t any!  The tiramisu turned out to be just right, not too dry and not too creamy.

At the end of our meal we asked if they took dinner reservations.  When my whole family goes out, which is kind of rare, there are 6 of us.  That can make getting a table kind of hard, but they take reservations.  Between that and the $7 burgers, the whole crew will be returning here!"

I thought this was a great place. But recently, all of the pizzas were dry. I started to order the pizzas with extra sauce. sometimes they remembered, sometimes they forgot. So fast forward to Xmas eve. I ordered $95 worth of pizzas and ordered them with extra sauce, because we would be serving them later that night around 5pm. So my wife picks them up at 1:45pm and brings them home. My daughter goes to St. John in Winfield and she has her XMas church choir event at 5pm. So, I decide when my wife brings them home to have a couple pieces......now mind you.....this is at 3pm. The pizza was good but it did not have the extra sauce that I requested. A little pissed because this is what I did not want to happen. So fast forward to 12/26 and I call Caliendo&#39;s. I explain the situation, I spent $95 on pizzas and you didnt put extra sauce on, I still have the pizzas in the box, yadda yadd and the manager says he will talk to the boss.He comes back and tells me that they will buy me a pizza. I told him that wasn&#39;t good enough and he proceeds to tell me, and I quote, &#39;our pizzas are made to be eaten right away, not to be re-heated 3-4 hours later&#39; Well how come they were dry 15 minutes after I tried it? Guy tells me they made all these pizzas and he remembers my 5 pizzas and that they put extra sauce on it. After reading other comments about Caliendo&#39;s, I see how ownership is. To not resolve this issue was bad business. I will be sure to frequent another place and take all of our school events, parties, catering, and nights out to the bar to another location."

The food is primarily pub grub, but it&#39;s tasty. Their appetizer sampler platter is MASSIVE; it&#39;s almost enough for 6 or more people. I highly recommend their loaded fries and potato skins. Their burgers are pretty basic, but tasty, and their Italian beefs and sausages are wonderful. We&#39;re not big pizza people, so I haven&#39;t tried it, but my friends adore it. 

The bar side of the restaurant is fun at night. While week nights can be a little slow, weekends are a good time. The bartenders are fantastic, and there&#39;s always great people watching.

4 stars for desserts ...

-1 star for delivery/take out (since they have been here, there is always a problem)
-1 star for food (Eggplant parm, ravioli, the cheese and the sauce are all inedible)
-1 star for owners go f yourself policy (apparently he makes no mistakes on relies on 20 year old recipes to try and carry him)

Italian fare is the easiest thing to get right.  Fresh ingredients and some love will garner A+ results EVERY TIME .....why do some get it so wrong??  Clearly there is no chef on staff, just inept cooks and a flaccid owner.

The long:

We frequented this place when it was the Winfield house.  Shortly after they moved across the tracks, we started noticing problems with service and food quality.   Our past experience includes getting our order wrong twice, and after 3 hours, we just wanted a credit and no more attempts at food. I know one time was pizzas for a poker party, which I then had to order from somewhere else...but last night takes the cake:

My fiancee and I decided to give them another shot.  At 8:30pm we ordered Eggplant parmigiana and Linguini with bacon and scallops, which my fiancee substituted gnocchi and white cream sauce.  So when she went to pick up, hers was ready, and mine was not even ordered yet.  After waiting another 15 minutes to get mine, she came home to find the bacon and scallops had red sauce.  While she was calling to get them to deliver what she ordered, I looked at the scallops.  They looked dry and stringy ...perhaps frozen.  I tasted one, and it was dry and stringy ....not plump, caramelized and juicy.  She then changed the order to ravioli and meatballs.  At 10pm, we called to see where the ravioli and meatballs were ....no apologies ...no nothing.  When they finally arrived, the sauce was overcooked and the sauce at the bottom of the pot had burnt, and was stirred back into the rest of the sauce.  Here is the conclusion:

Ravioli - Burnt, inedible sauce, pasta overcooked and filling/sauce was a salt bomb.

Scallops - lol ....if you cannot get fresh, and cook them properly TAKE EM OFF THE MENU!  If you do not know how to do any of that, then hire someone that does!

Eggplant parm - Inedible salt-bomb cheese, and a lot of it.  The 4&#34;x4&#34;x1&#34; brick of parm was a soggy mess that you could not tell where the eggplant starts and the breading ends.  No flavor, just a mushy mess that I threw 75% of it away.

This place relies on locals that drink and smoke everywhere.  I cannot imagine anyone coming here for the food, unless they do not know what this food is SUPPOSED to taste like.

Oh ...and when I called to ask for my money back, I politely provided all details,then, the owner told me to stuff it, after he said that he&#39;d been serving the same crappy eggplant for 20 years.  Nice customer service!"

The warm bread may be the best I&#39;ve ever had at a restaurant- amazing! It&#39;s a small round loaf and they didn&#39;t flinch when we asked for more. :)

We were really disappointed in how slow the service was. There were only three other tables of people in the restaurant, and yet we had to wait a long time between our drinks and then to order our meal, and then a long for the salad/soup and then for our meal and then for our check. We didn&#39;t get drink refills in a timely manner either. We got there at noon and didn&#39;t get our food until 12:50. We were surprised since it was lunch time and most people only have a certain amount of time for lunch. 

The server was actually very sweet with a kind smile. Just really slow- maybe she had too much to do herself?

I had the bambino pizza which is a small thin crust pizza for only $4.50- I added bacon for 50 cents and it was delicious! Great flavor. I had to blot the grease off with a napkin (which is typical of other places too) but it was so good. I also had the house salad which was bigger than I expected- mostly iceberg lettuce with a slice of tomato, but good Italian dressing.

My coworkers seemed to overall like their meals too. One ordered the chopped salad with chicken and ate every bite, though said that they forgot to include the bacon which was listed as an ingredient. Another person had the antipasto salad which was huge, but was disappointed that it was almost all iceberg lettuce. Someone else ordered the Godmother sandwich which was a hot Italian beef and provolone sandwich on focaccia bread, with onion rings, and she was really happy with it. Everyone loved their soups too.

It&#39;s a pretty small dining room (though I guess the other half of the restaurant is the bar area). They have big TV&#39;s and actually were showing HGTV type shows at lunch which I&#39;ve not seen at a restaurant before. 

I will definitely give Caliendo&#39;s another chance and come back again for some more bread and pizza."

It&#39;s separated into two sections: one half is a fully-stocked sports bar with an outdoor patio area and the other half is a restaurant leaning heavily toward Italian food.

Their sports bar is a good place to hang out.  They have pretty good beer specials and the regular crowd is not consistently old balls -- as John&#39;s (the dive across the street) or Muldoon&#39;s (across town) are -- so that&#39;s always a welcome plus.

The restaurant is odd though.  The food is alright but they&#39;ve tried to create the ambiance of a nice, quaint Italian restaurant.  There are candles on each table and the room was designed with mood lighting in mind.  The problem is that, well, it&#39;s next to a really loud sports bar.  So you&#39;ll be eating your fettucine alfredo in a dimly-lit restaurant with Gwen Stefani&#39;s &#34;Sweet Escape&#34; blaring into your ear.

I wouldn&#39;t go to Caliendo&#39;s on a big date but it&#39;s a pretty good place to have a couple of drinks with your friends.  Having access to an expanded menu at a bar comes up big, especially as the night wears on.

I ordered chicken vesuvio and I asked for boneless chicken instead of bone-in and the waitress said that would be fine. When I got my food, the chicken was sitting in a pool of pure oil. It was so saturated and oily and quite inedible. The potatoes could have been good if they weren&#39;t drenched in oil too. Definitely will never order that again. The table next to us ordered a pizza and it looked really good. I guess if we ever come here again (unlikely) I would try to pizza."

My wife had the Fish Fry special. We were all underwhelmed. :-(  The food was heavy and just OK. Nothing really going on here to make us want to go back. The service was very good, friendly and prompt. No complaints there, but just nothing to encourage us to go back."

The had a wonderful double dough and 4 star atmosphere.  However since they moved the good side tracks of the tracks they&#39;ve lost they&#39;re touch.

The pizza has changed.  It&#39;s almost the same but as if they&#39;ve forgotten a secret ingredient.  The bar has changed.  There were dudes in Winfield House that literally held the establishment up, they would play dice at the bar and it was not well lit.  It could almost be called dicey, but 5-star dicey.  It definitely had the feel that anything could happen and it often did.

The new Caliendo&#39;s has a sports bar feel, HD TVs, beer specials and those kind of places are a dime a dozen.  RIP Winfield House, I miss you."

Much to my suprise, this quaint little town has this pizza &#39;joint&#39; that is a gem in this suburb.  
I have been there many times since and every time have enjoyed myself both with the staff and the delish food. 
GREAT THIN PIZZA.  
Went there a couple weeks ago on a Sunday afternoon, only to find out that after 4pm, pizza is 1/2 price. HOMERUN RIGHT THERE.

I like Caliendo&#39;s and I like their pizza.

Not too sure about having a noisy sports bar on one side and restaurant on the other because I&#39;m sure that the noise carries over to those who are trying to enjoy their meal in peace.

I recommend coming here to grab a drink with some friends &amp; have some pizza. Man up &amp; get their spicy Giardiniera on your pizza. DO IT.

I&#39;ve heard that Caliendo&#39;s is a great place to watch the Bears. I&#39;ve been told that if you show up before 2nd quarter you get a raffle ticket for raffles throughout the game, AND you get to partake in the pizza buffet during halftime. I&#39;m going to have to investigate and confirm whether this is true or not. Stay tuned for updates!

But I am giving them a bad review because of the service. Granted we had a large group, and the waitress was frazzled, but very nice. One manager, a woman, is very nice and helpful, but the other, a man, snapped at several of us multiple times and was borderline rude. We were being very pleasant, just asking for water after waiting for it for 25 minutes, or asking for another pitcher of water; the usual stuff (the waitress could not handle these inquiries, so we went directly to him). Will not come back. Go to John&#39;s across the street instead."

We waited 15 minutes just to get our drink order in, another 5 for our drinks another 15 to order our food and a good 30 minutes for it to come out!
By far the worst service I have had in years and this is coming from someone who has worked in the restaurant business.
Upon confronting the manager he was rude and had an attitude, didn&#39;t offer to comp anything and sat at the bar the whole time.
I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place to anyone... 60 dollar bill later that was an expensive lesson to learn."

I came here on a Wednesday night and sat in the bar area. I wasn&#39;t at the bar, but a table in the bar. It was pretty busy for a wednesday, but not offensive. it was a nice crowd.

Service was decent. My salad came, then 3 mins later the pizza came which is never a positive. The server was attentive with my double talls, so that&#39;s what really counts.

The antipasto salad was excellent.

I got a medium thin crust pizza with 2 toppings. The menu said it serves 3-4 people, but as a 6-3 male just a little north of 200lbs i ate the entire thing by myself (except for 1 piece). The pizza was about $15, so that&#39;s reasonable.

The pizza was good. I don&#39;t agree about &#34;the best pizza in dupage&#34; but it was good.

I ordered bruschetta and stuffed mushrooms.  I know that bruschetta can be made different ways, but my bread was extra soggy with all the juices from the tomatoes - not the way I like my bruschetta!  My stuffed mushrooms were really salty, too.  My husband thought his meal was just OK.

Always have their booze in stock, open late 7 days a week, and have good music, with DJs pretty often at your request and some good specials.

What I thought was a unique touch was that upon arrival, my young nephews and niece were each given a ball of pizza dough to play with...genius!!

Also note that I LOVE Mexican food. I believe I was Hispanic in a different life so one could argue  I&#39;m overly critical because I believe I&#39;ve eaten at some of the best Mexican restaurants around. I ordered 2 steak tacos with cilantro, onions, cheese, and sour cream. Cost was a little over $6. It was good. I like how they serve their onions on their tacos. I think my steak needed a tad bit of salt though. That&#39;s why I&#39;m giving 3 stars. I would give 3.5 if I could. It  tasted like it was missing something.

Burrito was the most uninteresting and tasteless (other than salt) that I have ever had.  Barely any cheese, beans or lettuce.  Only reason it was close to passable was we had asked for tomatoes and onion to be added.  Other than salt, that was about the only flavor to be found.

I cannot believe food this good comes at this price. 

Let me explain something to you. I&#39;m a HUGE fan of many Mexican places around the west burns as well as in the city.

Burrito Parilla just de throned my favorite go to places. It&#39;s a 20-25 min drive and I&#39;m now ready and willing to ignore my favorite taco place that is 2 blocks away. Sorry, I DON&#39;T CARE!!! 

Burrito Parilla steak taco just blew my d!ick off and laughed in my face!!!

The steak taco.
This isn&#39;t some cheap cut of steak. This is steak you would be proud to serve your family to celebrate a special occasion! Served with cilantro and onions, they do it up right with grilled red onions and the freshest cilantro I&#39;ve ever had! 

The ground beef is seasoned to perfection!

The red sauce has a nice hint of garlic that rings through and changes the way you think of red salsa!

The flan is freakin HUUUGE!!!! My wife said it was amazing....solidly in the top 3 flan&#39;s she has ever had!

The horchata!!! This lands firmly in the top 2 horchatas of all time in my experience and I&#39;ve had PLENTY!! NOT EVEN KIDDING!!!!

I kept seeing many people drinking a yellow drink and I asked what it was and they said fresh pineapple juice and coconut.... I immediately got up and went and got a cup of it. I&#39;m seriously contemplating coming back, sitting on the patio and smuggling in my own rum cuz this would the THE PERFECT cocktail if it want also already THE PERFECT drink for any meal at any time of day! It was delicious!

I ordered the ground beef burrito suizo. It is huge. The red sauce on top has a great tomato flavor and a nice little kick to go with it. 

After eating tacos at Cilantro in Elmhurst and then downing 3 more here and eating half the burrito I was stuffed!

I can&#39;t wait to come back, the food is freaking amazing and it&#39;s soooo affordable!!!

I was refilling my drink with the pineapple concoction and I said tot he line cook &#34;You guys are doing a great job! That food was delicious!!&#34;

I&#39;m so excited! 

I cannot wait to come back!!

We got 2 burrito meals, a chorizo quesadilla and chorizo nachos with &#34;extra cheese&#34; they give you chips and salsa upon seating. The salsa is ok, but give 2 hot sauces if you&#39;d like spicier. Overall, our taco place near our house is better and cheaper."

After three visits here and trying a variety of dishes, we are convinced that this is the fast casual Mexican restaurant for us. 

It&#39;s almost always busy, but they keep it clean and well cared for. The setup is in an old BK restaurant and when I first walked in and placed my order, I was not confident. From my first bite, I knew that judging a book by its cover would have been a mistake here. 

The meat is a very good quality and always seasoned nicely. The rice is tasty. Even the chips and salsa are good. We&#39;ve tried enchiladas and tacos, taco salads and even desserts. Nothing seems to greasy which is nice. Sharing churros and a fried ice cream is the perfect end to a meal here. 

The prices are reasonable, they&#39;re easy to find and they have plenty of parking. If you find yourself in the area, I would highly recommend a visit to see for yourself."

I found this place which seems to be sorta a fastish Mexican food like place, but with a sit down like atmosphere inside. There are TVs around to almost, kinda give you the sports bar feel, which it&#39;s totally not!

So, when you enter you go through an ordering line to pick out your meal and pay. They give you a number to put in a stand at your table. You can a cup to fill your own drinks, so I grabbed some Horchata and we sat. We put the number at the end of the table like the people next to us so nobody could miss it. A random OCD busser flew by and moved them to the wall or back of our table with no word! Like, we weren&#39;t following the rules! Uh, okthanksbye! It was quite rude, but we were hungry so we just sat there quietly as did the other table who got the same fly by!

I ordered the Grilled Steak Burrito Suizo - no sauce, just the cheese please! I don&#39;t know why, but I have a thing for burritos... Anything in a culture that throws everything in one dish makes me happy! Especially if they wrap it up in something! I know, it&#39;s typically Americanized. I love all the flavors though! If I am limited to just trying one thing based on time or the size of my belly, I&#39;ll get that one thing then! Ahem, anyway... The grilled steak was great! Nicely seasoned and cooked to a nice medium! That made the whole thing! I had to take home almost half of it for leftovers! I even loved the guac!

The boy ordered a couple Grilled Steak Tacos and a Grilled Steak Quesadilla... So, you already know that the steak was spot on! With that said, you know that these were good too! The quesadilla was nice and cheesy and the little tacos came with some lime wedges which made him very happy!

All in all it was a very good experience for a place that looks to be sorta fast foodish! It was clean and bright! I highly recommend check it out!"

I approached with trepidation, because while I liked the Burrito Parrilla in Naperville I was underwhelmed by the flavors (great presentation though)... we approached hopefully.

Gobsmacked! That&#39;s what I was.. three tacos (Mexican Style) Chorizo, Steak and Carnitas.. every single one of them offering a packed tortilla bursting with flavor (Yeah, I said bursting.. just like a bad commercial) really excellent tacos, great presentation.. really good rice and beans and a great price.

The chips and salsa? Chips goods... salsa almost &#34;ketchupy&#34; BUT, THOSE TACOS!

Hot sauces? Nice little zing.. good flavor.

Lisa enjoyed her tacos just as much.

A wall of TV&#39;s,  we were able to watch Jay Cutler throw a pick and even THAT didn&#39;t dampen my enthusiasm.

We&#39;ll be back and back and back."

I don&#39;t mess around with tacos, so I ordered one al pastor, and one with chorizo. I have say that the chorizo was excellent. Sometimes it can just taste greasy, but here the chorizo was moist and spicy. Likewise, the al pastor was marinated very well, leaving the meat tender and spicy (but different from the chroizo).

Cilantro, lettuce and monterey jack were all welcome additions to the taco, and it was hard to say which of the sauces went well with the variety of meats. I&#39;d probably have to try them all.

I got a free dessert for joining the mailing list, so I went for the fried ice cream. Which was decently sized. But with an oat, flour and sugar coating it also tasted like the topping for a crisp, and it was very good.

Definitely keep this place in mind for great Mexican food!"

So I was excited and... He was totally right. This place isn&#39;t a taco joint. This place is a sit-down restaurant. The place was crowded, yet the food cam out fast. The servers were attentive even when we were sitting outside. Also, this one server was so funny. He kept joking around with us. It was a good experience. The food was amazing in case you were wondering."

I&#39;ve enjoyed Burrito Parilla in Lombard many times, so I (along with many others) was pretty thrilled when I heard there was another one opening in Wheaton. Okay, okay, I know it&#39;s really Carol Stream. But I&#39;m claiming it anyway, especially since it&#39;s close to the border. If you&#39;ve visited the Lombard location, this has the same offerings, only with a less grand facility.

Beginning with the chips and salsa, everything served here is amazing. Today I&#39;m having enchiladas, which I&#39;ve had before, but with white poblano sauce, which is new to me. I know some people think chicken is chicken, but they do it really well here. The rice and beans served as accompaniments are delicious as well. 

I dig the music, the people who helped me are very friendly, and the bathroom was clean and well stocked. It doesn&#39;t get much better.

I&#39;m pleased to see there&#39;s a drive-thru, especially for the cold winter months when I won&#39;t need to drag my kids out of the car. I&#39;ve heard a person or two complain that drive-thru service is slow, but it&#39;s important to understand that this is absolutely not fast food, and I think the drive-thru would be better used just for pickup of call ahead orders."

I&#39;d definitely recommend the Mahi Mahi tacos - the salsa and sauce on them are fantastic.  The fish itself is okay. 
Probably the star of the menu is the al pastor. I&#39;ve had it as tacos and as a burrito and both times it&#39;s been seriously fantastic. 

This place is priced like qdoba and Chipotle, but the portions here are slightly bigger and the meat is slightly better.  The free chips for dine in are an added bonus for sure,  even if their salsas are only okay. 

I&#39;ll definitely be coming here for my weekly burrito fix instead of qdoba or Chipotle. It&#39;s no comparison to a legit Mexican restaurant, but compared to the big bjrrito chains it&#39;s far superior."

We weren&#39;t sure what to expect. You order like you would at a fast food place and then they give you a number to place on your table for your food to be delivered. Free chips and salsa (a plus!). Our food was quickly prepared and....DELICIOUS! we all thought it was amazing and the dangerous part is that they have a drive-thru...to make it even more tempting! most of our group got the 2 taco plate which is a perfect sized lunch! really really good and we will certainly have to come back! don&#39;t forget to tip those who bring you the chips and salsa and clear your plates! they help make the experience great!

The first time I went I asked for sour cream (and paid for it) to be in my burrito. I cut it open and none. I asked the guy who comes around to the tables and he said he would bring me some. He came back a few minutes later and asked if I found the sour cream. I had to ask THREE times for the sour cream. The next time I ordered it on the side so I&#39;d know it was there. My friend did the same and she didn&#39;t get her sour cream on the side. The food is the same as any other place but more expensive. To me it isn&#39;t worth the extra money.

They certainly don&#39;t serve AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD here. We had Steak Burrito Suizos and the Steak was so BLAND !!!  It is definitely not the same kind of steak that is served at Real Authentic Mexican Restaurants. I grew up eating Mexican food and we have been to many Mexican Restaurants so I know how to tell the difference. Authentic is not here people.

I live in Carol Stream, and I&#39;m a Mexican food connoisseur. As far as Mexican food goes, this place is on point. I&#39;ve been to their location in Naperville, and I was pumped when I seen they were opening one by my place. 

My girlfriend and I had lunch here yesterday. She had the chicken burrito, and I got three tacos. Two tacos al pastor, and one grilled steak. The pastor was marinaded perfectly. The flavor was excellent. The steak had great flavor and was very tender. Her burrito was a nice size, and the chicken was perfectly seasoned. I got the black beans instead of refried beans. They were cooked perfect, and had plenty of flavor. The salsa is homemade, and is very, very good. 

I truly recommend you give this place a shot of your looking for Mexican for lunch. You won&#39;t be disappointed."

Just average mexican food at best They screwed up my sons order and gave him A quesadilla instead of a burrito. They gave him no guacamole which I paid $.79 extra for. When I went up to the counter and asked for some they looked at me like I was trying to rob the place. I had a chicken burrito. The chicken was completely bland. I wanted to give this place a good review and I hope they found a new Mexican restaurant but I don&#39;t think I will be coming back

My favorite part was the fresh pineapple juice they serve! Made fresh and it&#39;s free refill for $1.99. It definitely reminded me of the fresh fruit juices my mom would make. 

I had a carnitas Torta and a pineapple juice (best part) then I had some churros which where amazing and fresh made. 

I can say it&#39;s a delicious place and the fresh (free refill) pineapple juice was almost a guaranteed 4 stars but the prices are a bit high and the salsas they offer are good but left me wanting more (none of the two were spicy) 

I would maybe come here again, not sure tho."

It&#39;s a cute place and they have a nice outdoor seating area. We ordered for take out. I tried calling In my order ahead of time but the phone was never answered. I ordered the 3 taco plate which came with rice and beans. I ordered steak, chicken and al pastor. It was not a huge disappointment but I was not impressed either. It isn&#39;t authentic Mexican food but it isn&#39;t Taco Bell either. Out of all 3 meats I liked the steak the best. The rice was not bad but I didn&#39;t like the refried beans. My boyfriend ordered three tacos but when we got home he was only given 2. Sucks for him, lol. I ate my food and it was ok but there are authentic taco joints within a mile radius to this place and I would choose them over this place.

The meat was cooked perfect and all of the condiments, guacamole, pico, etc....were well made and super fresh.  The food definitely gets 5 stars.  The only thing preventing me from giving the full 5 stars is the man standing in the dining room busing tables and bringing out orders.  He kept reaching around our table moving silverware, trying to get us to try different hot sauces by squirting them on the plates, interrupting us by telling us to try this and try that, and things of that nature.  I was dumbfounded...I don&#39;t want anyone touching my food or plate when I&#39;m eating.  At one point, my son finally said, &#34;Excuse me, but please don&#39;t touch anything on our table until we leave.&#34;  He seemed a bit offended, but I thought it was so bizarre that he thought what he was doing was acceptable.

Some friends and I have nicknamed this place &#34;Los Dos&#34; since it&#39;s an upscale offshoot of Los Burritos in Glen Ellyn. My wife swears by the chicken fajitas. Father-in-law swears by the steak tacos on corn tortillas. And my go-to is kind of a DIY version of the SoCal favorite; California Burrito. Order the steak burrito with sour cream and guac. and add a side order of fries (Unfortunately they&#39;ll look at you like you&#39;re crazy if you ask them to add fries inside the burrito). So when they arrive to your table, open the burrito and add the fries to the inside. It&#39;ll change your life. 

Lunch time this place gets packed at noon. Best to beat the rush by getting there 11:45am to get a table."

That&#39;s okay, but prices are more leaning towards the &#34;full waitress&#34; range.  The guacamole was very good and the never-ending chips were served warm - yum!

The steak was very vendor without your typical piece of chewy meat mixed in which you get at most taco joints. The meat must have been prepared over charcoal or something as it had a touch of smokiness to the flavor. I enjoyed both the green and red sauces. I took a pass on the guacamole at $8 for an order. I felt is was a bit steep for guacamole for this type of walk-up/drive through venue. The service was prompt and our order was accurate. I&#39;ll go back.

I&#39;ve frequented this location dozens of times, I have tried a plethora of menu items, and each is more delicious than the last. The food is fresh, the flavor is authentic, and the portion sizes are generous. The service is impeccable, the employees are always very polite and courteous. Since they do cook as food is ordered, the drive through isn&#39;t a very fast option, but it&#39;s a nice alternative to going inside. I definitely recommend checking out this gem!"

The menu is much broader than burritos, with a nice selection of tortas, tacos, enchiladas, etc.  Lots for me to go back and try.

I ordered a milenesa torta.  You order from the line, pay cashier, and they give you a number to place on your table.  After grabbing a drink, yummy horchata, and finding a table, a friendly server brought chips and salsa.  I didn&#39;t order chips/salsa, so I thought that was a nice touch!  She brought a mild salsa in a bowl with a medium (green) and hot in a squeeze bottle.

The torta didn&#39;t take long to bring out.  Service was quick.  The torta was delicious and a good portion.  Price point was right as well.  I should&#39;ve taken a picture.

The server came back at least once to make sure everything was ok.  

Tables were clean.  Nice mexican music for ambiance.  There is a wall of TVs to watch as well.  They were all tuned to futbol."

Husband ordered the chorizo burrito dinner and I ordered the steak suizo burrito dinner which comes with rice and beans (refried or black). 
At first we thought this was fast food with the way you come in and order at the register. But turns out its anything but! They do have a drive through window, but it looked a bit slow. You get more bang for your buck if you come in. 
You are seated by a waiter who brings you chips and salsa which were delicious! There were four to choose from- your typical red tomato salsa in a bowl and three others in squirt bottles to put as much or as little on your chip as you&#39;d like. There was an avocado green salsa, a HOT (and I like spicy!) salsa, and a bbq salsa. All were delicious and they keep bringing you chips. My kinda place!
They also have a variety of standard sodas to choose from plus Horchata and Pineapple water which are the same price as a soda.
The food came out fairly quickly (5min or so). It was authentic (for American Mexican!) and outstanding.  Everything seemed fresh and high quality. The burritos are giant. Like the size of a baby. I couldnt finish mine, but it was delicious. We&#39;ll definitely be back."

It was absolutely hoppin&#39;, so you know they had to be doing something right to have a line out the door within the first 10 days of being open for business!!

I tried their steak taco salad, which was yummy! It&#39;s steak prepared in a Carne Asada style, so you know that&#39;s some good eatin&#39;. For $9.99 or so, it was a little on the small side related to portion vs. price, but the quality overtook every other aspect. Something not to miss.

My husband and son tired the Steak Tacos and Ground Beef burrito, and said they were very good. 

They also provide chips &amp; salsa on the house when you dine in, which were also delicious. The drive thru seemed to move a little quicker than ordering on the inside (the family behind us in line decided to get back in their car &amp; try ordering in the drive-thru, and we noticed them being served just before we got to the cashier in that long line). We might try that next time if in a pinch.

Overall, great new spot in the CS to try for Mexican food. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree it&#39;s pretty good. A tad pricey, but good 


P.S.- Best enchiladas I&#39;ve ever had my whole life... Granted, I&#39;ve only purchased the cheese so far, but with their Ranchero sauce it&#39;s fantastic"

I got the carnitas tacos and they were so good! The complementary chips and salsa was very good and the horchata was very very good...and I am very picky about my horchata! My family ordered churros and they were not like most.  They were soft, yet crunchy, and served with a side of caramel. We liked them but wished they were larger.

A good solid meal, but nothing was truly flavorful or wonderful.  Kids meals are very basic, but GENEROUS!  Service is friendly, over so by the person bussing the tables.

When I got home there was a long curly black hair intertwined in the tortilla.  I called the restaurant back to let them know I was coming back to get a new one.  I also mentioned that they forgot the sour cream and guacamole, and the rice was hard.  when I arrived to return my order I came in to show them the hair.  On my way driving to the restaurant I decided to not get anything from there because who knows what they were doing to my food.  Most places don&#39;t like when you call to complain so I wanted to be safe rather than sorry. I had about 5-7 employees staring at me as if I was doing something wrong, I felt very uncomfortable.  A man looked at the burrito and said we don&#39;t have anyone here with long hair.  I was looking at him like are you kidding me, I&#39;m not going to eat a burrito with hair on it, whether you have someone with long hair or not.  They said they already made my burrito and they said are you sure you don&#39;t want to take the burrito, I said no thank you.  They lady returning my money wouldn&#39;t give me cash back and I paid with a debit card so she said she was voiding the transaction.  I wanted proof it was voided and she had a hard time coming up with a receipt, finally she gave me a receipt that said voided.  Just waiting for the proof to come from the bank that the transaction was voided.  I will not be going back there, maybe the employees should wear hair nets!"

I noticed this place a few weeks back while it was still undergoing construction. I work in the area and have been keeping an eye out for it to open, because I am excited to try something new for a change. 

Well I noticed today that it was open and deiced to stop in. I am glad I did!

I typically like steak burritos, so that is what I ordered, with guacamole. I also noticed the drinks were self serve, so I ordered a small drink. Upon placing my order with a friendly gentleman taking orders and operating the cash register I was given a number to take to the table so they can bring my food to me. At first I was a little surprised at the cost of the meal, a steak burrito with guacamole and a small drink for over $11.

After paying for my meal I went over to the drink station and noticed thy had horchata. I poured a glass of it. 

I then headed towards the dining room to find a seat and was promptly asked by a staff member how many I need a table for and if I would like chips and salsa. I replied that I would. By the time I sat down at my table there was a bowl of chips and a cup of salsa along with red and green hot sauces.

The salsa was very good. My burrito arrived shortly after. After the first bite I could tell it was very fresh and the steak was very good.  Through out the whole burrito I could tell it was fresh and high quality. A nice change of pace from all the greasy burrito places I am used to.

Personally I thought the meal was very good, I intend on gong back and trying more of the menu. While I do try to find places slightly cheaper than this to eat lunch at on a regular basis, I will be back when I feel like treating my self to this delicious food."

Lots of great choices and ways to customize your meal. The tacos and enchiladas are delicious. The meat is seasoned well and the tortillas are tasty. I love the salsa. It&#39;s a little spicy for a house salsa, but that&#39;s how I prefer it anyways. Glad to have a quick place to get decent Mexican where the meat isn&#39;t questionable and the food is overly salted."

The famous chicken salad is amazing.   Might be one of the tastiest salads I have ever had.   Since I was so good, I allowed myself to have the white chocolate blondie, which was equally delicious.   
For carryout they did a great job of packaging everything up and still making it appetizing which is more important than you would think   
The place was hopping on a Wednesday night so I cant imagine what it is like on the weekends.    They seemed to handle the crowd well though and it was vibrant and buzzing rather than feeling stuffy and overwhelming."

I ordered a Caprese Salad and bowl of Mushroom soup. One other diner had the soup. Service brought it separately from the mains, as first courses. The awkwardness of serving nothing to 3/5 the table while we had soup escaped service. The soup itself was awkward: Spooning soup and French fried onions and long strings of melted cheese proved problematic. I really didn&#39;t like the challenge in front of 3 others that were not served.

Caprese Salad was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. Sliced Cherry Tomatoes floating in a bowl of balsamic vinegar with a small amount of mozzarella cheese. Strange, and unimpressive. If this is the Best Effort from the kitchen to through together practically the simplest of dishes, then don&#39;t bother doing it....or anything more complicated!"

The decor is modern, with a beautiful bar and even though the lighting is pretty dark, the energy and noise level make it more of a friends for dinner place then romantic evening.
We started with my standard G&amp;T and a pomegranate martini, G&amp;T was small and forgettable, but the martini was pretty and tasted great.
Then moved to appetizer of egg rolls, nicely crisp with slightly spicy filling and 2 dipping sauces to compliment.
For dinner we had Chicken Crepes and Balsamic Ribeye with spaghetti squash sides. The crepes had a good texture and the chicken was moist, the mushroom sauce had some depth. The spaghetti squash had an interesting preparation with an herbed butter, raisins and pistachios.
The steak dinner came out cold, but the waitress immediately took it back and it was comped from the bill without asking. After it was returned it was cooked properly and had good flavor.
We finished with the White Chocolate Brownie with ice cream, which was rich and warm, a great way to finish  the meal. 
Overall good experience, mistakes happen but it was handled professionally and quickly. The food was good standard fare with some interesting sides and really good desserts."

I made a reservation so we were seated right away but we waited quite a bit for our actual waiter to come around. It was extremely busy so I don&#39;t think he was intentionally avoiding us. There was just 4 of us but we were seated in a very nice and roomy booth probably meant for 6. Our food came out in a timely manner and everything seemed fine but the Salmon New Orleans I ordered was disgusting. I love salmon and I know what it should be like but this was not quality salmon. It tasted okay, but it LITERALLY felt like I was chewing paper. It just ruined the whole experienced of it. Salmon should not be rough and hard to chew. I even had my friend, her husband, and my boyfriend try my salmon and they agreed something was very very off about the salmon. I actually felt like I might get a paper cut eating the salmon. Again, it took a while for the waiter to come to us but when we finally caught his attention, he was very apologetic and nice and offered to get me a new one. When they brought my new salmon out, a woman, who I assume is the manager, brought it out and spoke with me apologizing. It would have been fine to just leave it at the apology but she said that if I had wanted it medium rare, that I would have had to order it that way. I DID NOT WANT IT MEDIUM RARE. I WANTED IT HOW SALMON IS NORMALLY COOKED. She treated the situation as though I had just ordered it wrong and that their salmon was fine. The cooked parts of the salmon was still had a very paper-y consistency but most of it was very under cooked so it was bearable. I just pretended to eat sashimi, which luckily for them, I love. They did take out my dish from the bill but I was still irritated.
Overall, it wasn&#39;t terrible time, I just wish the manager didn&#39;t act like I was at fault and like I had done something wrong."

I did a lot of research on Yelp to find the one restaurant that I wanted to try while here in Illinois. I decided on trying The White Chocolate Grill. 

We made reservations and arrive a little bit early. We were seated right away and a few minutes later our waiter came by to get our drink order and explain the menu.

Here&#39;s what we ordered:

-Barbecued Baby Back Ribs Pork baby back ribs grilled and finished with signature BBQ sauce  - $24.79

-Tomato Gin Soup (House Specialty) Fire roasted tomatoes, cream, mushrooms and smoked bacon. Topped with Tanqueray Gin - $6.79

-Southern Chicken Salad Crispy hand-battered chicken, field greens, smoked bacon, cherry tomatoes, avocado, chopped eggs and house made Hailey&#39;s croutons with Ranch dressing -$14.39

My father said the ribs were decent but a little dry. The sauce was tangy and tasty. My mom had the Tomato Gin Soup and she thought it was too salty. She tried to eat it with bread but it was still salty to her. I tried a little bit and thought the overall taste was very good but I too thought it was too salty. I had the Southern Chicken Salad, the chicken was crispy and juicy. The mixture of vegetables with the fried chicken and ranch was so delicious that I ate the whole thing pretty quickly. My parents may of heard mmm sounds. 

Overall the service was good because he was very attentive and apologetic of my mom&#39;s salty soup. They took my mom&#39;s soup and said we could try something else, but we were all too full to eat anything else or even try the delicious sounding white chocolate desserts. They did not charge us for the soup my mom didn&#39;t eat which was nice."

Before our meal, my husband had about 8 servings of bread, which the server was very friendly about bringing to our table. For brunch, my husband had a sandwich and I had an Eggs Benedict with steak, both of which were delicious.

Décor: This is a pretty nice (upscale) restaurant that oozes class and sophistication. The décor is fancy and the lighting is set to a very relaxed and more intimate mood. It&#39;s a great spot to have a business lunch, a more private meal, or to celebrate an occasion. It was particularly inviting due to the very HOT day we visited - the cooler and darker interior was a very welcomed break.

Staff: Our waiter was very friendly and super knowledgeable about the menu and offerings, even providing suggestions and answering every question we had.

Food: We were just in for lunch so we skipped any apps and went straight to the meal: We had a burger (good but pretty standard) w/ fries and the Club Sandwich (rather large and tasty) with a side of Brussels sprouts (very tasty!). The food came out rather quickly and everything was enjoyable. 

Value: The prices are right about where you&#39;d think they&#39;d be. In fact, I&#39;d say a few choices were even cheaper than I expected (which is great!)

We had a nice meal here and would return again in the future if we&#39;re in the area."

We were in a group of 18 the other night for dinner. I felt the staff was not organized well to serve large parties. The runners had no idea where the drinks or food orders went to. Every time they had to go around our table and ask who ordered the item. Also one of them spilled a drink on me and did not seem too concerned. Seems the wait staff are not well trained. 

As for the food it was ok but not great. We had multiple appetizers. The spinach and artichoke dip was average. The southwestern style egg rolls were pretty good. My ahi tuna appetizer was very good. Had a unique Asian slaw with it which was very good. It was big enough for 2. Probably the best thing I ate that night. I then had the mahi-mahi for my dinner which came with a side of choice. I had the fresh green beans which they seemed to be pushing that night. The fish came topped with crab meat. The fish itself was dry in spots. Obviously overcooked and the green beans were very much undercooked. They were way too far on the raw side. Several other folks had various steaks all of which they stated were average and nothing special. Also the booze is watered down in my opinion. I know my vodka and can tell right away when a rocks drink is not right. I complained and the replacement was the same. I complained again and ordered a mixed drink and you could not taste anything but the mixer. At this point I was frustrated as with everything else I mentioned here there was never a manger that came by to address or at least acknowledge any of the issues. Tells me that this is as good as it gets there and they do not really care. I will not come back by choice. Lots of better places in the same parking lot there to go to."

We found this place on Yelp with an expansive menu and it looked to be a nice place. 

Well.. It&#39;s a very nice place and the service is wonderful. It&#39;s a large restaurant with lots of menu options from crepes to BBQ platters. 

I got the breakfast special which was crab cake eggs benny. It was kind of lame. The eggs are poached to hard and the crab cake was literally about a 1/4&#34; thick. Not sure how they even got it that thin and were a still able to fry it without falling apart. 

He side was some bacon potatoes which were decent. The fruit was mushy and old tasting. 

The BBQ that Michael had was pretty good. Probably smoked the day before and reheated but good none the less. 

Don&#39;t get dessert. It&#39;s way too sweet and rich. Almost gross to eat. Maybe the first bite is ok, but no more. 

This place seems like it has great potential, especially the location and quality of the building but the food needs work. 

The in house ranch dressing was the best part of the meal for me. 

Michael liked his though so that&#39;s good!"

Came in with my wife and another couple. I got the BBQ trio (pulled pork, ribs and rotisserie chichen) with honey glazed carrots. For starters, all of the meat was tender so no complaints there. What I wasn&#39;t fully feeling was the sauce dressed on the ribs. Wasn&#39;t nasty or anything. Just didn&#39;t blend well with my taste buds.

For dessert we got the apple pie. It was pretty good accompanied with the ice cream on top. And it was a big enough size for two people. I can definitely see myself returning here someday but it may not be an immediate rush to do so."

After a late afternoon outlets shopping, we came 15 minutes before the closing time to enjoy our dinner. We made a great choice.

Apparently we were the last table to be seated and served. Our waitress was wonderful. She kindly ensured us no worries on the closing time. Well, we were hungry so very quickly decided on Ahi tuna salad, New York strip, and Mignon salad.

Ahi tuna salad was tasty with a good portion for me. Fresh fish and seared nicely. The salad got the right amount of dressing. New York strip was truly medium rare. Less fat than I anticipated but still juicy and tender. Mignon salad was not what I expected. The beef was chopped to small pieces instead of a big chuck or third slices. Also a little bit hard to chew. I will either skip chopped bacon or blue cheese next time which make some bites very salty.

We were for chocolate soufflé for our dessert. I liked it but not impressed. The cream inside was not warm enough and the cake was a little bit sweet. Would be better if I got my coffee.
We chatted happily during our dinner. Overall it is a very decent place."

To start of, there&#39;s nothing upscale about this restaurant. It&#39;s a grill and that&#39;s exactly what it feels like. Perhaps some of the reviewers confused upscale with modern because the decor is definitely nice and modern. It is also does not have a romantic feel whatsoever. It&#39;s just a modern, well decorated grill, with low lighting. With that said, I shouldn&#39;t have gone there for our anniversary dinner. We should have stuck to Mortons.
However, the food we ordered was good overall. I asked for a bellini and they gave me something with peach and sparking wine--it was good, but not a bellini. We had spinach artichoke  dip for appetizer--it was good but definitely not the best I&#39;ve had, and the chips were extra salty. My husband had the ribs, and he really liked them. The meat was soft--fell off the bone--and it was well seasoned. I had the blue cheese crusted fillet cooked medium--the meat was soft and they cooked it correctly. I enjoyed the steak! For dessert we had the bread pudding simply because I didn&#39;t know what to order and that&#39;s the server&#39;s favorite dessert--it was definitely good, if you have a sweet tooth. Finally, our server, Joey, was quite nice and professional--I appreciated that! 
So, even though the food was good, my expectations for this place were much higher. I was quite disappointed with the dessert menu though. Given the name of the restaurant, I was expecting a better selection of desserts made with white chocolate, not just a bunch of desserts with white chocolate sauce over them."

The way the tables were setup was indicative of a steak house vibe and just screamed out again wildfire. 

One cool thing they had going on was that the bar was in the very center of the restaurant so as the bar patrons backs were to everyone but cool at the same time cuz you get to more or less look at everyone at the same time. 

My steak was ok; it was smothered in a very juicey sauce that probably ruined or masked the flavor of the meat. Not sure if they serve USDA prime or choice... who knows... my side if I remember correctly were fine, the drink was meh could&#39;ve been stronger but thats ok. the service was there as well, but could&#39;ve been stronger.

This is located on a corner with lots of choices (Maggiano&#39;s -been there, Morton&#39;s-been there, and more).  BUT, I hadn&#39;t tried WCG, and who could resist a place with White Chocolate in the name.

FYI, you can make reservations thru Opentable, but our group of 6 plans kept changing so we just stopped by.  The wait?  Around 30 minutes.

Restaurant is huge and contemporary (actually all the restaurants are huge; LA restaurants just don&#39;t have the space).  We were seated in a room, next to a window, with other large groups. (Later, my teens complained it was cold by the window, but they have thin L.A. blood).

Service?  Excellent.  Our server was fast &amp; friendly. 

Drinks?  Bynum Pinot Noir by the glass.

Food?
Grilled artichokes w/Parmesan &#34;dusted&#34; on top &amp; aioli sauce.  Ok.  Stem was tender, but rest was tough.  Needed a discard bowl.

Wedge salad-they don&#39;t skimp on dressing or blue cheese.  Large salad that I was able to split this with my teen daughter.

Blue cheese crusted filet (comes with mashed potatoes and an additional side).  Ordered steak medium rare and it was prepared correctly.  Was craving and really enjoyed it (saw my daughter ate all of hers).  Also, good quality, cut of meat.  I didn&#39;t care for mash potatoes. I ordered couscous as additional side. Its served cold and I thought it was good, but I was too full to enjoy.

This second trip was a huge disappointment.  I had made reservations for 6:45 PM and we arrived a few minutes early.  There were several parties waiting to be seated and i could hear at least one party of two bemoaning the fact that they hadn&#34;t made reservations.  They were of course seated ahead of us.  Finally, we were seated at one of the two heaviest traffic areas in this restaurant.  One is the front door.  The other is a door which is a point of convergence between the kitchen, the bar and the open seating area.  Of course,  someone has to sit at the table there.  Righhhhht...the party of two with reservations.

Then came the ordering of drinks.  Classic Margarita for my better half and a Cab fir me.  The Cab was perfect.  The Rita was a disaster.  I wonder if this is a trend in fine dining because this is the second time in three weeks that Virginia&#39;s favorite drink was butchered.  My expectation is that we would receive a well mixed Rita.  It tasted like a lime powder preparation...just nasty.  Our waitress explained that the Margarita is prepared earlier.  Steam is now coming out of my ears.  I expect a mixologist in a fine dining establishment to squeeze a couple of limes and add an orange liqueur before the Tequila.  A bar manager can only go so far to keep the beverage and labor cost down and not offend well heeled patrons.  

I had steak the previous night so I tried the Chicken Madeira.  It was wood fired and a bit dry as a result.  However, the taste was excellent and with a sauce to balance the dryness this dish was yummy.  

Virginia had the strip steak ordered medium.  It was perfectly cooked.  Virginia was taken back a little by the &#34;sliced&#34; presentation (Wheres my steak?), but outside of presentation the steak was bland.  I added salt to a piece I tried and that helped.  Can&#39;t fault the kitchen there...you want to let diners season to taste.  Still, it was nearly tasteless.  I would like to see an au poivre on the side as an option, but at least a bernaise.

I tipped 16%.  I&#39;m not inclined to return.  C&#39;est la vie."

We decided to try this place again to see if we could get some somewhat healthy options.

While our waiter was excellent and knew exactly what ingredients were in each entree, he admitted that none of the menu items were vegan.  There is honey in the veggie burger and egg in the bun. Even the guacamole had egg. They made a special salad (not on the menu) which was not good at all, doused with way too much dressing. The brussel sprouts without the cheese was great. Unfortunately we found two big chunks of cheese in the salsa that came with the chips (appetizer). 

We walked away disappointed. You can eat vegan easier at Chipotle or Subway. We were wrong to think that a newer, contemporary restaurant would be more in tune with our generation and have at least some healthy options on their menu. Lesson learned."

Came here for lunch n ordered the prime dip with veggies and a glass of vino.  Perfect lunch! The sandwich was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and the dip was not too salty!  The side of bbq sauce and wine added the cherry on top!  My co workers got the salmon which looked very good as well.  We alll enjoyed our meal!  Wish we had time for dessert but had to run to our next meeting.   Next time I&#39;m around I&#39;ll be stopping by for some dinner and dessert!

I&#39;ve been hearing about this place for years so we finally decided to try it and were disappointed. It was just very below average. I thought the desserts were supposed to be amazing but my SO and I both ordered different ones and both were disappointing.

The place I choose when I want good food, but I don&#39;t feel I have to be runway ready. Or when I want a quiet dinner in a nice atmosphere without the fussiness of my favorite Naper steakhouse that&#39;s located next door. ;) WCG is beautiful space. Dark. Quiet. Perfect for a date. 
 
I always start with the grilled artichoke. It&#39;s dusted with parmesan cheese and the saltiness of the parmesan is perfection with the artichoke. My favorite way to begin a meal there.

The rainbow trout with the herb goddess sauce is a staple for me. The fish is prepared perfectly and although I use the sauce sparingly, I love it enough to eat with a spoon. 

If you&#39;re a fan of sushi as I am, the Ahi Tuna Salad is perfect for lighter fare. When I am being strict with calories, I even like the Ahi salad sans dressing. The mangos, avocado, and sushi provide enough flavor to eat it dry. It&#39;s one of the few salads that I really love the dressing though. 

The much loved tortilla soup is made of big chunks of their in-house rotisserie chicken. It hits the spot on cold Chicago evenings... It is different than other tortilla soups that I have had. More like an Enchilada soup since it&#39;s a cream based and has been thickened with masa instead of the typical clear broth, which is how most prepare it. Regardless of the consistency, it&#39;s delicious.

I have eaten at WCG with at least 6 friends and all 6 have said that the Israeli Couscous with roasted pistachios is their very favorite side. It&#39;s mine as well. Unexpected flavor that makes me want to eat every bite, even though I told myself I would not. I wonder if they&#39;d just bring me an entire plate of it instead of an entree? 

Dessert. Ask nearly everyone. Order the White Chocolate Brownie Sundae. A warm blonde brownie served with warm chocolate sauce, vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and huge shavings of white chocolate. I am not a big fan of white chocolate, but this dessert is heavenly. We don&#39;t even look at the menu anymore. If we&#39;re ordering dessert, it&#39;s a must.
  
While I wouldn&#39;t say it isn&#39;t good for kids, I wouldn&#39;t be quick to bring mine for dinner either. I took my 15 yr old and 4 year old here for lunch. The 15 yr old of course was fine... the 4 year old was happy enough there. They do have a kids&#39; menu and the staff was very good with her. --I never once felt she shouldn&#39;t be there. That said, it was lunch, not dinner. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a child there at night. It definitely has a night club feel to it and almost everyone there seems to be on a date. I personally would not bring my kids here on a weekend night. While they are certainly  seasoned restaurant goers and behave very well in public, I don&#39;t think kids would fit in that scene nor would the majority of the people there want to see kids on their date night.  Just my opinion.... 

Make sure you have reservations for weekend nights because a 90 minute wait is very typical if you don&#39;t.

Do not hesitate to sit in one of the seats at the bar if seating in the dining is full. It makes for quite a pretty focal point."

I got nothing chocolate with my meal, despite the name of the place.  The ambience is a little on the romantic side, but you can go with friends all the same.

My jambalaya was the perfect amount of moist, and the seafood in it tasted nice and fresh.  Has a good kick to it, but not overpowering.  The portion is huge, and sadly I ate most of it. I usually limit my carb intake, but I had to make an exception for this. Ceasar side salad was good and added to the meal, and the Brussels sprouts were uncooked, which wasn&#39;t what I was expecting. Still pretty good.

I&#39;d come back here for sure for the jambalaya alone!"

Nothing really stood out as awesome but nothing wasn&#39;t good either.  I have never been out in downtown Naperville so I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect.  The space is rather large.  It does appear properly staffed though.  We grabbed a drink at the bar and they make a good dirty martini with blue cheese olives.  They were very quick to take our orders and give us our drinks.  Good thing we checked in half an hour early though cause by the time our reservation came, the buzzer went off.  I would not have been happy if we had to wait a half hour after.  The place was extremely packed at 6:30 on a Saturday and, on our way out, it was even worse.  So good for them but just be prepared for a very crowded spot.  We had a table that was in the bar area and I liked that.  Our service was decent.  We were never wondering where he was and the food came in an adequate amount of time.

I got the center cut filet.  I ordered medium rare and it came out more on the medium side but not so much I would send it back or anything.  The meat itself was just average to me.  It did not seem like a prime cut and the meat wasn&#39;t particularly tender or flavorful but again, not bad.  The filet is served on a bed of mashed potatoes.  Had I known that, I would not have ordered more mashed as a side.  The portion size was too large for me.  But I guess that is the crowd that goes in there so since I&#39;m not their target demographic, that is fine.  But if you&#39;re used to city spots, you&#39;ll think these potions are rather large.  The cous cous salad that my husband got as his side was the highlight.  That is very tasty and refreshing.  His French dip was okay.  There was too much mayo on it and the bread was just plain bread and not toasted and a baguette  like is typical with a dip of any sort.  Although the large side of jus was appreciated.  The banana dessert was tasty but nothing to rave about.  Overall everything was okay, no complaints."

I feel like this was a long term relationship and we&#39;re breaking up. :( Thank god the bread pudding and pulled pork sandwich is so good or else I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d ever come back.

2 major disappointments, the service and the cleanliness. OMG I can&#39;t even begin to explain how shocked I am. I&#39;m still in denial. Maybe it was just a bad night for them, I don&#39;t know. The service was absolutely horrible. I&#39;ve never experience this ever in the tons of times I&#39;ve been here :( we had like 4 different waitresses. It was really weird, like stuff was out of order. The service was extremely slow. Then out table was dirty so they came to clean it yuck. The worst part is, the platter they brought the artichoke drip out was filthy and crusty on the bottom. Then the plates they brought out for the appetizer had dried food still on it. Dishes were not cleaned. I was about to throw up. I&#39;m completely disgusted. :("

We had reservations, but had to wait half an hour because it was valentines day. It was no problem because we had a few drinks at the bar. But what made the service exceptional was that the manager offered us a free appetizer because of our wait. We didn&#39;t complain about the wait, but it was great knowing that they were thoughtful about the customer.
The food was fantastic. I had the jambalaya which was some of the best I&#39;ve had. I paired it with the brussel sprout salad which was also great, and i don&#39;t even like brussel sprouts. My girlfriend had the salmon and roasted carrots and she said the flavor was great and the salmon was cooked perfectly. Also the entree sizes were well portioned.
Finally the dessert. We ordered the white chocolate bread pudding and we only wanted a small taste cause we were pretty full. Let&#39;s just say we finished the bread pudding. We will be coming back. Fantastic place."

We went there on a Saturday night with a reservation and had to wait ~15 minutes to be sat which is a little long given we had a reservation, but it was a Saturday night, so I suppose it happens.  The service was good, the decor was pretty cool and the layout was comfortable.
Due to all of the reviews, I knew I needed to try the Tomato soup and I thought it was very good.  I did not taste Gin at all, so I&#39;m not sure what it adds to the flavor, but I liked the bacon and mushrooms in it.  It is a pretty filling soup, so for my meal, I just ordered a wedge salad.  The salad was a standard wedge but it was huge for a side salad...I had plenty of food with just that.  My husband got fish (I can&#39;t remember what kind) and the brussels sprouts on the side.  The brussels were tasty in flavor but they were cold, which surprised me.  So, be forewarned that it&#39;s more like a brussels slaw/salad than a warm side.
Obviously, we saved room for dessert and got the banana cream pie.  The crust was delicious and I love bananas with the caramel, but I found the filling to be a little flavorless.  Maybe they just want to focus on the other stuff...I guess I would&#39;ve preferred more banana flavor.  
We thought it was a pretty good spot and intend to go back sometime.  We&#39;ll definitely try the bread pudding next time and I have my eye on the Jambalaya."

I assume we were lucky to be seated since they first thing we were asked is if we had a reservation. Took about 20 minutes to get a seat which wasn&#39;t bad at all, though we did see a few empty tables when we walked in.

The ambiance is more on the romantic side. For the most part, unless you sit near the bar, you will get a booth and have some privacy to you and your party which is nice. There is one center light that shines from above so you can at least read the menus. Overall, I would say it would be a great place to take a date to get some privacy and enjoy the setting.

I ordered the Shrimp Jambalaya with Mashed Potatoes for 16.99 (without tax and tip) which is why I am giving this place only 3 stars. I was pretty excited about the jambalaya even though there were only 4 shrimps on top of it. However, after the first bite, you immediately taste how salty the jambalaya was.  Or perhaps, I was simply unlucky. The mashed potatoes were also not bad, as I would give them a 4/5 for the taste. Portion wise, it was decent and able to fill me up and I consider myself to be a pretty decent sized eater if that means anything to you. However, I couldn&#39;t overcome the saltiness of the jambalaya. I almost didn&#39;t even want to drink water after each bite because I wanted my tongue to be desensitized.

On a brighter note, I would give the service a solid 5/5. Even if they aren&#39;t your waiter, the other serves will come by and take anything away from you that needs to be and refill your water whenever it&#39;s below midline. Also, the roasted carrots were quite amazing, so if I ever go back, I would get that.

Overall, this place is nicer and fancier than a Cheesecake Factory with higher quality items and a more pleasant atmosphere and amazing service. However, it seems like the seasoning of the food is where it is a hit or miss, especially when considering the price point."

Price point wise it is fairly expensive. every main course was at least $23 and then the salads were at least $15. The desserts are all per the name sake including white chocolate I got the chocolate souffle that was overly sweet but it was very good.

Service was 5 Stars! - The server was absolutely attentive, caring , and patient. She really went above and beyond.  I was really impressed with her suggestions and advice. As well as timeliness. It was really quite impressive. The bar must have been a behind however, drinks were slow to arrive.

Food was 3 Stars - The food was delicious but small.  So small it was stingy.  For the prices charged the portions should be at least 1/3 larger if not 1/2.  The $16 salad was itty bitty, ahi tuna was over cooked, 2 cherry tomatoes, and 2 pieces of small mangos.  The Chicken Madiera wasn&#39;t even 1 chicken breast large.  The salmon was filling for me but I&#39;m a small chicka anyone with a larger appetite would be left hungry for more.  The $30 steaks were small as well. The $7 Chicken Tortilla soup was 1/4 cup was missing ingredients listed - no chicken, no avocado, a sprinkle of cheese.  

Dessert was good. 

Ambience was 3 Stars! 

The A/C was up too high. The room we were in had the blinds shuttered to keep out the hot sun, but when the sun went down no one came to open them up.  

The bathrooms could have been fresher.  They smelled and had toliet paper clogs.

I had the crab eggs benedict with the bacon hash and fresh fruit,  The eggs and fruit were delicious.  The hash, however was a greasy pile of bacon bits and mushy broccoli.  One bite was enough.

We booked a reservation through open table, just to be safe, which I would still recommend. We had an &#39;interim&#39; person come over and explain the food specials. For some reason this site offers no official drink specials or happy hour, but if you look at their website, other sites/states do have specials. I don&#39;t quite get that! The waitress did offer that their Angel&#39;s Envy whiskey would be $6 no matter what way you ordered it, so we opted for that with ginger ale, as our waiter was not a drinker and couldn&#39;t recommend a cocktail to us (no biggie). 

I am a huge burger fan wherever I go, so I ordered their BBQ bacon burger ($13 range), with the sauce on the side. The burger was topped in shredded cheese and chopped onions, so you actually got a lot of cheese on it. The bacon was thin but crispy and delicious. The sauce tasted housemade and was smoky and not too sweet. The meat had good flavor and was cooked the way I asked. Overall, a solid burger. Their shoestring fries were perfectly thin, crispy and salty. I couldn&#39;t stop eating those!

My friend ordered their steak sandwich with fries that she also really liked. The waiter said it&#39;s a popular menu item. 

They offer pricier items like steaks and fish, but I&#39;m a simple girl and prefer burgers and sandwiches ($13-$17). The atmosphere was warm even though the place was large.

We started with the spinach and artichoke &amp; tuna poke. Both were tasty. We also had the Stag&#39;s leap Cabernet. Great stuff. 

For the main course: parmesan cheese crusted fillet on top of garlic mashed potatoes and frites. Served with creamy horseradish sauce. Yum.

One bitterly frigid day, a holiday for most people, a friend drove me out there. This was his reward.

And quite the reward it turned out to be. I have low expectations going to a restaurant in an overly-engineered, upscale-looking... Well, let&#39;s call it what it is: a strip mall. And the name, The White Chocolate Grill sounded a bit too close to The Cheesecake Factory.

But if have to go to Naperville and want to do something special for the friend who drove you out there, you can&#39;t go wrong with this place. Great menu for the suburbs, and a nice, chill interior (OK, unmistakably a chain-restaurant architect, but one with some sense of style). 

I had the French Dip (people may claim that you are what eat, but I&#39;m not French and NObody better call me a dip). It was delicious, as were the mashed potatoes. Mon generous ami smacked-up his burger and fries, giving props to them both. 

We usually wouldn&#39;t have had dessert, but here we had to make an exception, and the pastry chef made one that was an exception too: it was exceptional. We chose the white chocolate brownie and practically licked the plate clean. I came close with my fork and spoon, but didn&#39;t want to be a poor example for any kiddies in the restaurant, which there were thankfully few. (Love ya kids, but sometimes you&#39;ll have more fun with the nanny.) 

I would definitely go back, even if they opened a location in the city (though I would have to do it on the down-low, away from my &#34;locally-owned-only&#34; friend)."

Not too crowded when we came over probably because it&#39;s post vday dinner with the fam. The booths are cozy and could fit even our newborn&#39;s carseat which is a big plus. Food has kids selections but a little more on the expensive side for a burger and grilled chicken. I ordered the maytag burger with bleu cheese and bacon. Burger was perfectly cooked to my preference medium but I didn&#39;t taste the bacon at all. So sad... But for $15 bucks I had better ones from red robin or smash burger. The AZ egg roll was good though. It came with the choice of either a cream tartare or a roasted salsa dipping sauce. A very unique take on a traditional asian dish. Only mistake is that we came here for dinner instead of just trying the desserts which IMHO, where they truly shine. That explains the name of the resto, go figure. We got the warm white chocolate brownie served with vanilla icecream, chocolate sauce and white chocolate shavings. Hits the spot! Friendly advice go eat dinner elsewhere and come here to enjoy your dessert in a nice cozy ambiance."

We arrived for a 7.30pm reservation 10 minutes early, but still had to wait 40 minutes to be seated.

We were not happy at all, but were eventually seated.

Then White Chocolate turned it around. As we sat down a manager came over to apologise for the wait and offered us an appetizer on the house.

We had fantastic service and the food was excellent. I had the balsamic ribeye and my wife had the parmesan crusted fillet.

We finished our dinner with the white chocolate brownie which was delicious.

My only critique is when I called to place a reservation I asked if they did anything for birthdays and was told they&#39;ll put a candle in your dessert and we were visiting to celebrate my wifes birthday, but the birthday request was possibly not noted.

Anyway, it&#39;s something small and regardless, we&#39;ll be back!"

We went straight ahead with entrees as we have to save some space for their great desserts. I got shrimp jambalaya and it was great, perfectly moist and flavourful, the shrimp was wonderfully done and sausage and chicken taste great, overall a 5 star entree. +the Israeli couscous salad i loved it. My wife did ordered center cut fillet as welldone and even then it was little juicy, though the amount looks ok to me but it was sufficient for her.

This place is an upscale restaurant that has a swanky atmosphere. I sat down in the bar area as I was instructed by the hostess. It took a good 10 minutes for anyone to pay attention to me. This is why I have to give the restaurant 4 stars. 
I ordered the wedge salad which was an average wedge salad. Nothing over the top or any twists on the known recipe. For my entree, I ordered the Cajun salmon. It was wonderful. The shrimp and crab on top of the salmon was delicious. The salmon was perfectly cooked. The only complaint that I actually did have was that I couldn&#39;t get enough of the Cajun sauce that they put on it. Lastly, I had the bread pudding for dessert. It was very good. A perfect combination and not two sweet. 
Overall I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area."

I ordered the rotisserie chicken over a bacon hash with brussel sporuts and my mother had the chicken crepes. My mother enjoyed her crepes except that they were a bit too sweet. My rotisserie was delicious and i loved the hash. The brussel sprouts were just TOO sweet. Shortly after the meals were brought out our waitress brought us the bill acknowledging that we may want to leave fast. It was very polite and helpful.

While on business in Chicagoland, I stay in Naperville, Illinois. Within a short walk from the hotels are probably 10 restaurant choices,  but I never seem to go anywhere but the White Chocolate Grill. The tagline above might suggest why,  but  it&#39;s the house specialty soup that has ruined me! The soup is called Tomato Gin Soup. Let me tell you,  it&#39;s Freakin Fantastic! Addictively good. Fire roasted tomatoes,  cream, marinated mushrooms,  and smoked bacon make up the soup,  and they top it with Tanqueray Gin. You must try it! 

The restaurant has a comfortable upscale feel, suitable for entertaining business clients,  a date,  or just a traveling salesman having a somewhat expense account compliant meal. 

The menu is diverse,  featuring a daily fresh fish selection, scrumptious entrée salads, ribs,  and steaks. 


In addition to the soup,  I had a wonderful entrée salad; Sesame crusted Ahi Tuna salad, The tuna was seared rare and very flavorful,  with field greens, mango, avocado, cherry tomatoes and cucumbers in a champagne vinaigrette. I had them put some shaved parmesan cheese on the salad, and it was even better. 

On my second night in town, I of course had the Soup, and the blackened mahi as my main course. It was grilled, topped with crab meat and a tomato creole sauce. It was decent, ok flavor, but nothing that I would order again. There was nothing wrong with it, but for me, it just didn&#39;t work. Mahi is a great tasting fish with just a simple preparation, so maybe it was just to much going on for what I usually think of Mahi. ( go ahead and try it) 

On my final night in Naperville, I had a taste for steak, and after kidding myself that I could go a night without the soup, I walked past WCG to Morton&#39;s, next store. After getting sticker shock, I decided to go back to WCG for soup and to try their steak. I had the New York Strip, for a more reasonable $27.99 vs. my car payment, or a surely to be bounced on my expense account amount for an ala carte steak.... Anyhow, the steak at WCG was excellent! It was a great cut of meat, flavorful, seasoned perfect, and cooked a beautiful medium rare! it was finished with a steak butter. It was better than I had expected, but not surprised as this place is great. 

I am looking forward to returning for the soup and I will try the BBQ ribs next time.

My carnivore husband and vegetarian self could happily dine together. Don&#39;t usually order cocktails but we each tried one and they were both delicious (mine was the Vitamin C Martini and I think my husband&#39;s was Frisky Whiskey). The quinoa veggie burger was among the best veggie burgers I&#39;ve ever had. They offer an inventive choice of sides and I highly recommend the Brussel sprouts with marcona almonds. The banana cream pie for dessert was also yummy! One warning though - make a reservation! We arrived at 5:15 on a Saturday and there was already an hour wait (we were lucky to snag a bar table)

Service: Our waiter was a huge help in picking out what to get on the menu. My boyfriend is a big whisky drinker, but they had so many options he wasn&#39;t sure which would be the best pick. He asked our waiter if one of them was good and the waiter said, &#34;Oh no don&#39;t get that.&#34; I really appreciate it when a waiter is honest about the food and drinks at a place. He made a recommendation to my boyfriend and he loved it so it was a win. He was prompt on a busy night which is another thing I appreciate because there have been too many times I have been to a restaurant that was empty and received no service at all. He was also personable and nice which makes the experience great. 

Food: For an appetizer we got the egg rolls and they were pretty good. I would get them again. However, the Idaho tuna was amazing! The fish was cooked perfectly which I always appreciate because fish is hard to perfect and few restaurants put in the effort to achieve it. The fish was also packed with flavor. The mashed potatoes were creamy and full of flavor as well. The true gem of this experience was the bread pudding. The breading pudding was amazing probably the best I have ever had. If you are going to check this place out make sure to get the bread pudding. Also make a reservation. We went on a sat night and thank goodness we made a reservation because there was an hour and a half wait, but we only waited 5-10 mins."

When they take your drink order ask for bread, they don&#39;t seem to advertise it but they have complimentary warm pretzel rolls with salty butter."

We were considering using them for our wedding. After last night, we were sold. They all sounded great together &amp; the sound system at Manny&#39;s really helped.

It was a nice bar. Good space in the corner near the entrance for the band to play. They had also a nice back section as well for those either not wanting to hear the band or not be near the bar/have more privacy. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d come back here if my friend&#39;s band wasn&#39;t playing, as it&#39;s nowhere near me at all. But all in all, it was a nice place to see them perform at."

Food was also pretty good. Had the drunken burger (bacon, blue cheese and saute&#39;d onions) with fries. Fries were some strange shaped fry/chip combo and were very good, lightly battered...like a cross between a chip and a waffle fry. Burger was so-so, the patty seemed like it could use some seasoning...but not bad. Good price to value ratio on food and beer and the bartender was very friendly and attentive.

Overall decent place...I&#39;m hesitant to call it a dive bar because it was pretty clean and well kept, but it kind of had that older neighborhood bar vibe and it&#39;s a sizable place so it was a little odd.

I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way, but definitely could do a LOT worse on that stretch of St Charles rd."

A really nice atmosphere with a hustling barkeep donning a friendly, hard working demeanor. Cleaned up a lot from it&#39;s previous life and food is well above average (best pretzels this side of any mall). Well worth the effort to get there but very police heavy in the area so uber it and be careful!"

That&#39;s why I ordered it.  But, alas, to quote my friend Jim, &#34;while I was eating the burger I was trying to remember what I ordered.&#34;  That was, unfortunately, the experience that all three of us had at Manny&#39;s Ale House (formerly Elmhurst Public House) last Friday.  I wouldn&#39;t even say the burgers were &#34;ok,&#34; I would say, don&#39;t order one.  Despite the toppings, they had little flavor.  Fortunately, the fries were really good, the coleslaw not bad, and the drink prices very reasonable.  I was disappointed in the burger, but they did a really nice job on the remodel!   My son and friend would rate Manny&#39;s at 3 stars, I would give them a solid 3 1/2.

Today, I came in for the Barcelona / Real Madrid game. I was hoping to watch the game with fans, on either side, and unfortunately it was pretty quiet today. Regardless, the fiancé and I enjoyed the game and the service. Manny, the owner, is great. Very friendly, and he always makes you feel comfortable, and is always making sure you have everything you need. 

The food is good, not great, and although they have a good selection of beer, they lack in their stout beers. I had to settle for a Guinness. This place should be drawing in more people. With an owner like Manny, who is invested in his business and his customers, it should attract more people for a Saturday afternoon. 

Add some more stouts, and I&#39;d be back more. In any case, the place is worth checking out."

I thought with the Blackhawk&#39;s game on, it would be busier.  The beer selection was okay and the apps were 50% off which was cool. The bbq wings were good. My turkey club was terrible. The turkey was slimy. Yuck. I choked down 1/4th of my sandwich and just couldn&#39;t.  For a $10 sandwich, I wasn&#39;t impressed. 

We actually went there for karaoke (didn&#39;t realize there was a game on) and the place pretty much emptied after the game...okay...yeah it wasn&#39;t a fun atmosphere since karaoke happened after the game. The dj tried his best but my friend and I kinda took turns singing cas no one else did. It was kind of a disappointment.  

The worse part is we left the bar to find my friend&#39;s car had been towed from a local strip mall parking lot! Not the bar&#39;s fault, just thought I&#39;d mention that you should be careful where you park around there...

Any way, we don&#39;t plan on going back. There are better karaoke places in the burbs."

We were all told we were going to back alley burger and then the person who told us that was like no we&#39;re going here. Boooo. I would have rather had back alley.

Ok, so as soon as you walk in the smell of bleach hits you right away. I guess that&#39;s good? Idk I don&#39;t really like the smell of bleach. 

If you go to the bathroom beware that room smells like straight sewage. Gross. They need an air freshener or something.

One of my lunch mates is extremely picky they didn&#39;t have anything that really appealed to her. She ordered hot wings extra hot and they barely had any sauce on them. One plus side was she really wanted fried pickles so they made some for her. 

Myself and another lunch mate went with the Mediterranean burger. It had a weird taste. There was two types of cheese. I know one was feta the other I have no clue. I tried a bit by itself and it was disgusting. Weird flavor and texture. The fries were honestly the best part of the meal.

One person had the fish tacos and loved them. Not one complaint from her. 

Ps if you order mikes hard lemonade they only have cranberry not regular. The picky one made them take it back and they did. That&#39;s why I&#39;m giving them 3 stars and bc they made her her fried pickles. 

The best part of my whole experience was the other customers. The two guys to our left and the two girls to our right. We had a great time bs&#39;ing together."

Before the food was served I was offered a bowl of fish soup to try and it was good.  The food was served quick and the burger was excellent.  The fries were different and something I have never had before but were absolutely delicious.  I was happy with both the food and the service and will definitely be back when in the area.

The old Elmhurst Public House has been fabulously transformed into Manny&#39;s Ale House! Fresh renovations and a shiny new beer menu are some of the highlights. That big clunky bar in the center of the main room is still there but looking much spiffier. Lots of big screens to watch sports. Dining room off to the side is nice for families. Our baby LOVED the aquarium.

Two thumbs up for the awesome local craft brew selection on tap. Everyone was friendly and service was fast! Might need a hostess at the door though...

Steak sandwich with seasoned fries is a winner. The flat bread was cardboardy rather than crispy. Meh. PLEASE consider putting a good house made veggie burger on the menu for us veggies! This is a burger and beer type of place after all!"

I dislike &#39;sports&#39; bars and pubs for the most part, so, I decided to check out the menu and get something to take home.  It was 3 pm / Saturday - a few patrons watching &#39;sports&#39; on screens.  I took a seat at the bar and asked for a take out menu.  I asked for a recommendation and settled on a burger.  I checked out the beer list and decided to order a brew while I waited. The barkeep, named Clay, was so polite and genuinely &#39;nice&#39; and attentive that I felt totally at ease. There was some nice blues station on and so I was content to sip my porter (from Eugene) and talk to Clay a little about some of my favorite porters.  That experience was nice enough but when I got home and tasted the burger, I was pleasantly surprised.  I didn&#39;t have high expectations.  On first bite, the burger was perhaps a little more cooked than I requested, and maybe a little less seasoned than I hoped. But that was all fine in the end, because the overall quality of the burger, with the steamed bun, toppings, seasoned fries, and slaw was pretty close to perfect as pub food goes. Seriously one of the best burgers I&#39;ve ever eaten.  And actually, although I had to add a little salt, I would rather add than have food that is over salted.  My little mantra on Yelp is &#34;hold the salt&#34;.  Well done Manny&#39;s Ale House!"

Decided to give them a try when we only had the youngest of our kiddos. It was pretty dead for a Wednesday night. We arrived there around 630. We were pleasantly surprised to find out they had half price on selected appetizers. Hubby ordered the hot wings (10). He likes hot wings just not the vinegar kind which those are I guess. He said he&#39;d get them again as BBQ or teriyaki. I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. It comes with pita chips. It was really good and there was plenty left for lunch the next day. Dinner for my hubby was the Rueben with fries and coleslaw. The Rueben had just the right amount of sauerkraut. The fries were big seasoned wedge twisted fries. They were awesome I had 2 and would of stole more if he hadn&#39;t finished them first. I had the southwest salad minus jalapeño. It comes with a Chipotle ranch dressing which had a little more bite then most of the ones I&#39;ve had before but it was good. I added some regular ranch to it to calm it down a little. Their ranch is the kind I like too, regular not buttermilk. We took a look around it&#39;s been open under new owners for 2 years now. Same lay out without the booths, and everything has an updated look. Brought our son to look at the fish tank which he loved. We had a great waitress and a waitress that was training. We met one of the owners who was bartender that night Manny. He was a sweetheart and took an adorable picture of our little guy through the other side of the fish tank. We&#39;ll definitely be back and tell our friends and family to join us. I think our next visit we&#39;ll have to try their breakfast buffet the owner told us they have on Sundays.

The BBQ pork was tender and the fries were nice and crispy. They have a bunch of local beers on tap and was told they change them seasonally. 

The place was bustlin with people inside. They have tables located all around and a designated dining area. They even have a 150 inch projector playing the game.

Great place to watch a game! The restaurant was very clean and has a good vibe. Our waitress greeted us right away and took our drink order. They have an impressive variety of bottles and draught beer and good daily drink specials! I ordered the Mediterranean burger and fries and my husband had the steak sandwich. Holy feta! The burger was pretty good and filling. My husband liked his steak sandwich too and says he would order it again.

I like the place itself. Great place to watch a game and I like the setup of the bar in the middle. It was totally empty when we went, but whatever on that. The guy who served us didn&#39;t seem interested in serving us; he was slow, unattentive. Had to get up and flag him down a couple of times. Didn&#39;t even bring waters until we asked after we got our food. And that was only to two people.

I got the cream of chicken soup and that was good. I ordered a burger, which I followed the advice of other reviewers. Someone wrote they have &#34;out of this world burgers.&#34; That person was wayyy off. The burgers seemed frozen to me (although my friends disagreed with me). My biggest peeve with burgers is not melting the cheese and this had that problem. I liked the guac and onions, but that&#39;s about it (I got the Mexico burger). I ate it, but still. I liked the weird fries/wedges, but they definitely skimped on that, should be more on the plate. 

Great drink menu with lots of beers. The bloody mary was from the bottle. This place I feel could do a lot better but they just don&#39;t want to. That was the vibe I got."

It&#39;s too bad that I can&#39;t say the same for Manny&#39;s.  

Interior is clean and spacious, but doesn&#39;t have any particular motive or theme associated with it.  Food tastes and looks frozen bought.  Completely over-priced for the amount and quality you receive.  Service is like watching a flying trapeze act - especially when it comes to getting your bill.  

There&#39;s nothing unique, quirky, quaint, etc. about this place.  If they were to revise the menu and just focus on some really good home-made items, I would consider coming back, since we only live five minutes away.

Pros:  excellent burgers and pulled pork. But don&#39;t ask for a burger not on the menu, I ordered a mushroom and Swiss burger, and got. Their Mediterranean. Sent back 3 times. Finally they asked &#34;what&#39;s on a mushroom Swiss burger?&#34;!  Sereously?

Great beer selection, apps are ok

Cons:  horrible corned beef, shoe leather style, terrible salad dressings (home made, my butt!) service is still in the weeds, but getting better.

It looked a bit empty for a Friday night around 6:30pm. For starters we ordered the loaded fries. The fries were unique, the looked like steak fries from places like Red Robbin (yumm!!!, sorry couldn&#39;t resist) but they were twisted and seasoned quite well. I ordered the &#34;adult Mac and cheese&#34; and it was really good, it had chicken mushrooms and bacon (at least it said it had bacon, could see or taste any but it&#39;s not a huge deal) the sauce had a good cheese flavor, I think it&#39;s made in house since I tasted multiple cheeses. My wife had the drunken burger which had onions bbq glaze and bacon (maybe the bacon that was supposed to be on my dish?). She ordered it medium rare but it came out medium, it was seasoned well.

My only major complaint was the service, our server was nice and all but she wasn&#39;t around enough. An older gentleman who I&#39;m guessing is the manager kept coming over to help us which what we needed. 

Over all a good experience, my wife isn&#39;t sure about going back but I think I may."

The first time I had the Mexico burger, which you can read about in my prior review. The second I had the meatloaf, which was pretty good. The mashed potatoes are made from real potatoes, not flakes. Bonus points for that, but the plate was lacking color. It could have used a vegetable of some sort. Last night I came again for the pulled pork and a couple of Sapporos, which (again) were on special for $2.50. The sandwich was quite tall, as it was piled high with onion tanglers. The pork was brushed with a sweet BBQ sauce and was pretty good, though I&#39;d have preferred a mustard style sauce myself (I&#39;m from the south). It was pretty busy for once, but I attribute that to the Blackhawks game being on. Service was still pretty good though. Overall it was an inexpensive yet oddly satisfying dinner. I still don&#39;t really care for the cole slaw though, but that&#39;s just me. If you&#39;re looking for a decent pub to go to, Manny&#39;s is the place to be. The food could be better, yes, but it&#39;s worth the price. The staff is attentive, though not flirty, and the beer is cold. I give it a solid 4 stars."

This was over 7 months ago. Since then I probably stop in at least once a week because something is always new. So impressed with how clean it is compared to the Public House! 
They have different events featured  during the week to appeal to different crowds. Some coin games and multiple TVs inside for sporting events. A backroom that can be reserved for parties. A beautiful and clean fish tank that separates the bar from the dining area.
Not only that, but their food is amazing.  I absolutely love their fries and bruschetta burger, mouth watering. Daily soup and entree specials.
The owners are always around and personally greet you and make sure your experience is nothing, but the best. Manny always has great recommendations if you aren&#39;t sure what to drink and they always have amazing drink specials. Especially their $4draft special. It&#39;s a great chance to try those speciality brews. Their wait staff goes out of their way to get to know you and give personal service.
My elderly parents who are very choosy about the restaraunts they go to love this place.  Manny and Demetri are so patient with them and make sure their experience is nothing but the best! I love that they actually care about their customers and actually go out of their way.  
Definitely recommend this place! Something for everyone!!!"

The restaurant is clean and comfortable.  There are TV&#39;s to watch the games. We  just wanted to chat but to be able to catch the game score was nice.

This place came up on my handy dandy Yelp app and voila. We had a place to go.

It was a Sunday night and the place was dead. I mean the bartender, one server, and a manager on duty, that was it. We were one of maybe three tables total while we were there.

But the service we got was decent and the good was delicious. My hubs got the chicken and waffles - let me tell you this will be the only thing I order here from now on. So good! Best chicken and waffles hands down. I got the BBQ potato which is a large baked potato with BBQ pulled pork and onion strings. it was good as well, just not as delicious as the waffles.

I actually didn&#39;t get a beer because they had a beer mimosa on special for $2. $2!! I got one and so did my husband. They were great and would definitely order it again.

Overall I liked this place. Good food, service, &amp; drinks. I know it was a Sunday but I wish this place was a little more busy. I hope it doesn&#39;t go out of business because I would certainly miss it."

This is our go-to pre-comedy show stop for a drink or two. Very happy to hear that our favorite bartender, John, has been promoted to manager.

I can&#39;t speak to the service or atmosphere but the food was packaged well, arrived very hot, and our order was correct.

Tonight&#39;s &#34;Hoprita&#34; was another Rita gone carbonated with the likes of Fox and Hound, White Chocolate Grill and now Hopvine Brewery.  If there was an ounce of Tequila it was unnoticeable. Not as nasty as the other two eateries, but an imposter nonetheless. 

My Rib Eye sandwich tasted great,  but was impossible to handle, my hands taking a bath in the course.  My side salad had little or no dressing.  

We live very close and would love to make this a go to place, but alas...the attitude of some is discouraging.  I asked the bartender if he could make a Golden Cadillac and he flippantly responded, &#34;I know how to make one...but I have no galiano or blender.&#34;  Well. galiano is required, but a blender is not, unless you want to make it with ice cream.

Hopvine was unlike any place I have been. Since we are into craft beers we thought that Hopvine might be a good choice. Wrong. 

Our party of 5 was seated promptly enough but that is when the fun started. Ever have a situation where no one stops by your table to greet you? We did. I actually had to find the hostess to get our server. Interesting that there were seemingly more hostesses than waiters  ( or so it seemed).

We got a variety of beer including a number of the house beers. These  we&#39;re some of the most mediocre beers I have ever had. One of us got the beer flight. The golden ale tasted like a Weisse beer, the &#39; sour&#39; tasted like vinegar.  We asked if that beer was supposed to taste like that and we emphatically told yes! Even though half of the beer in the flight were essentially undrinkable the manager (beer guy?- maybe we insulted him?) didn&#39;t offer up another beer to try.  All in all the beer program, in my opinion, needs to be totally reworked.  Thankfully there are other bottled beers and a full liquor bar. Stick with that.

The redeeming part is that the food was good. I had the chix wrap which actually was in a pita. The burger was good, chix and waffles was a generous portion and falafel average- not crispy as though maybe sitting around.

So 1 star for the beer part 3 for the food.

Prologue - I left my phone and when I returned looking for it the hostess had an odd reaction - not very helpful and seemed not too concerned. Staff acted really weird , definitely a odd vibe from the staff.

There are better places to go."

The place is in a strip mall around the perimeter of the Fox Valley Mall. It&#39;s nice enough inside- open and has the cool windows where you can look in on beer being brewed. 

The food was really delicious- my husb had a burger and LOVED it. I ate the roasted beet salad, and it was tasty with a great mix of flavors, fresh greens and all that.

What completely sucked butt about this place is: 

1. My husb ordered an iced tea, and they came back to tell us they were out of iced tea. If you are a restaurant you just don&#39;t run out of iced tea. That&#39;s just something you absolutely cannot do.

2. I wanted a fancy girly drink, so I ordered a raspberry mojito. What I was served can only be described as grape soda with mint leaves and lime pieces. It was surreal. It was purple. It had not a drop of alcohol in it.

I think you just need to skip any other beverage but beer when you go here, so I&#39;ll return when I&#39;m feeling beer-y."

The steak sandwich was unreal. The Mediterranean sampler appetizer was really good. 

Brew Monkey is probably one of the best local beers I have ever had. 

The only thing I can suggest for the owners is if there is a game on and people come in turn it on all the tv&#39;s to the game and play the sound for the game. The guy playing his guitar was good but it was the NHL playoffs and the Hawks were playing. Kinda odd."

I&#39;ve been here a couple times now. Once just for drinks and a couple apps up at the bar with my husband, and once with a group of 8 for dinner and drinks in their dining area (for my birthday). I&#39;m going to spell this out REAL easy for everyone - with bullet points of course. Here we go...

GOOD:
- Beer flights: You can choose up to 6 at $1.75 each (or maybe $1.25, I can&#39;t remember). I enjoyed them all but one!
- Spoon Salad: Yummy and great for splitting
- Lobster Mac &amp; Cheese (on special): AMAZE. Still thinking about it.
- Live acoustic music occasionally
- Located conveniently right next to the Comedy Shrine which is bomb dot com

BAD:
- Service, service service: Slow. Like REALLY slow. Which is not ideal when you&#39;re trying to be on time for a comedy show next store. Wait staff seems uneducated on the menu and beers as well.
- Fried pickles: MEH.
- Pretzel sticks: Not great when I had them (my sister liked it). Mine were hard to bite into, as opposed to the soft pretzel like app I was expecting.

WILL I BE BACK?
Most likely. I live nearby so it&#39;s a super convenient place to go grab a beer. I&#39;ll stick to sitting at the bar though if the wait staff doesn&#39;t kick it up a notch. The Mac N Cheese was fantastic so I&#39;ll be back for that too. 

TIP:
If you&#39;re going to Hopvine before a show at the Comedy Shrine, be sure to give yourself PLENTY of time because the servers definitely aren&#39;t in a rush."

The chicken and waffles had no jalapeño slaw or maple ginger syrup as promised on the menu...just an overly sweet waffle and a sugary piece of chicken.  The roasted beet salad was empty, containing only a handful of arugula, canned beets, and a small amount of chewy pancetta. While I wouldn&#39;t mind trying other menu options, the prices make further sampling not worth it."

There were 4 other tables of 3 to 4 people each and two or three people at the bar the during entire time we were there.
After ordering (all meals at the same time ) we waited 45 plus minutes to get 5 of our meals, ten more minutes to get 3 more and then another ten to get the last meal which was only a bowl of chili! During the wait we only got drink refills when flagging down the waitress (multiple times).
Two of the orders were wrong, two were burnt.  Before we finished our meals the waitress told us that if we wanted desert we had to order it now, as the night menu did not serve desert. We ordered 2 deserts which took 30 minutes  (we times it). During the wait for desert, no waitress to even flag down for more drinks, and we bussed our dishes and glasses onto an adjacent table.  
We asked for the manager who could really care less, and gave us an excuse that they were extremely busy, I said really with the 4 other tables?
Done with them for good! Now I know why the place was empty on mothers day."

After 85 minutes our main lunch order hadn&#39;t arrived.  Two tables that arrived after us had theirs.  Ours was a party of two.  Does not make sense.  The bartender did his best.  Management needs to understand one cook and one server on a Friday isn&#39;t enough help.  They themselves probably need to look into the mirror and realize they probably don&#39;t need to be managing restaurants any longer.  We won&#39;t be back.  Ever.  Sorry guys.

Hopvine resides in the location of a former beloved joint I used to frequent back in the 90&#39;s called Pockets.  It&#39;s been gone a long time so it took me a minute to make the connection.  Anyways, I kind of left Hopvine alone for awhile because I guess I associated the place with the shopping mall..and why would a good brewery want to be in that type of a location?  Don&#39;t follow my ideology on this, I only postponed a good meal &amp; beer for inaccurate reasoning.

Food - We came here for a very late lunch so for all intensive purposes it was our dinner.  The food menu has a solid number of choices and I went with one of my favorite staples, the Club Sandwich (smoked turkey, lettuce, tomato, bacon, maple dijon, sourdough).  Very tasty and on the greasy side...but that probably made it better!  Had fries on the side, both were a substantial cut above your average bar food.

Beer - It&#39;s winter so I rarely touch anything on the light side.  Russian imperial stouts atypically have a heavy feel but not Hopvine&#39;s selection called Weekday Mild.  One of the best and most original RIS&#39;s I&#39;ve ever had.  It&#39;s super light for an RIS and somehow manages to keep a very prominent flavor.  Instead of customarily sampling a second beer I couldn&#39;t resist another pint of the stuff.  Easily 9 stars out of 10, if not perfect.  

Service - We had great service, very friendly staff and the layout is such that you can drink in the bar area or have a meal in the restaurant area with family.  I made the mistake of associating this place with a shopping mall.  Don&#39;t repeat my error and give this place a shot ASAP.  
Cheers!"

I had the Hopvine Burger. First burger I&#39;ve met that I couldn&#39;t finish. Pulled pork and bacon topped the juicy 1/2lbs patty. Cooked the way I wanted it. 

I also had their coleslaw. When he said it was made fresh, he want lying. Crispy lettuce and cabbage, not too juicy, lots of flavor.

hopvine-brewing-company-aurora,Angela P.,3lUkFxUQKeMUYH7-z_kmjg,"Aurora, IL",1,1,1,400,8,pcS0ZkaRgXIMxKQowZS6Rw,2.0,2014-12-06,"Well, I guess some Yelpers didn&#39;t like what I had to say about the bartender here.  So, here&#39;s my edited version:

I can&#39;t keep up with the number of craft beer gastropubs opening in the suburbs. After going to many suburban craft beer breweries or bars and rating them all five stars, I knew there was either something wrong with me, or I&#39;d eventually find one that I didn&#39;t like. Unfortunately for Hopvine, I&#39;m just fine, but I really don&#39;t like this place.

The service is bad. Dominic P. and I came here for a casual date night on a Saturday night. We arrived around 8:00 p.m. and were told there would be a 10 minute wait. We decided to sit at the bar instead, which is first come first serve. I later saw at least 20 tables open while I walked to the bathroom.

We were never really acknowledged and had to flag down bartenders to order drinks and food. One of the bartenders spoke so softly, I couldn&#39;t hear a word he said OR attempt to read his lips since he also sported a massive beard. The other bartender was busy but also occupied with some friends/regulars sitting at the bar. I was almost mowed down by three waitresses while heading to the bathroom - they were all in a hurry like it was opening night and they were slammed.

The beer is OK. I had the Yes, Dear, a strawberry ale made with local honey. It wasn&#39;t as sweet as I expected, but it was OK. I didn&#39;t want to have a second one though. Then I had the Adult Root Beer, but it was definitely NOT as good as &#34;Not Your Father&#39;s.&#34; I had a sip of the Farmhouse Ale, a solid craft beer, but again, I just wasn&#39;t blown away.

Unfortunately, the food is just as mediocre as the beer. We ordered the Spicy Goat Cheese Dip, which was served with pita. The pita was lightly toasted, but still soft and pillowy. I liked the creaminess of the dip mixed with pancetta and cranberries. But it was not at all spicy. I was completely puzzled by the word &#34;spicy&#34; in the description.

I ordered the Grilled Cheese. How can you mess up a grilled cheese? The flavors were just weird. I ate a grilled cheese in Cleveland with 14 different types of cheese, so when I say there was TOO MUCH blue cheese on this sandwich, there was too much. The house made summer sausage had a good flavor, but it didn&#39;t belong on the sandwich. It also should not have been ice cold. The flavor of the sausage didn&#39;t work with the blue cheese at all. 

When we ordered, I asked the bartender if he liked the grilled cheese or macaroni &amp; cheese better. I barely got more than a &#34;uh, they&#39;re both good&#34; out of him. Same goes for when I asked him about the fries or the house chips. Staff was useless when it comes to making recommendations or making anything SOUND good here. I felt like a nuisance the entire time we were here.

Oh, and when we asked for our check, the bartender had the audacity to ask my husband how many beers we had. Um, isn&#39;t that your job? I wanted to say, &#34;ZERO&#34; and walk out. The bartender still effed up the check, but in our favor - we got a free beer.

Hopevine is OK, but it is nothing special. I&#39;d come back for their guest taps, but that&#39;s about it.

2.5 stars. It isn&#39;t awful, but they need to try harder given all of the competition in the suburbs."

Walked in to the place and there was no host/hostess or server to be found.After waiting 5 minutes, I had to go up to the bar to find out whether we could seat ourselves or if we needed to continue waiting to be seated.

After being seated, the service did not improve. It took 40 minutes to get our food. The employees were more interested in talking to each other than they were the customers. I could forgive slow service if the food was great, but this was typical bar food.

There are plenty of bars near my home, Hopvine is not worth the drive for this kind of experience."

Not a fan of mall food, I whipped out my phone and looked up restaurants near us via Yelp. I rattled off a few places and I found this - a brewing company? My husband was all in. Come to realize it was very close by, in a strip mall. It&#39;s tucked away and when we went, it was veryyy quiet. Whether that&#39;s a good thing or a bad thing is subjective. I didn&#39;t mind. They did have one of the World Cup games on the big screen, which we appreciated.

I had a dish comprised of tilapia, brown rice, and spinach and it was delicious. A little broth-y, but it was healthy and just what I was looking for. With it, I had a beer...I believe it was the Brew Monkey. Although I don&#39;t recall 100% which beer I drank, I do remember enjoying it very much. My husband also gives thumbs up for his food and drink.

Service was great! Our server was attentive and helpful. I love the ambiance and wish this establishment were closer to where I live, because I think my husband and I could become barflies here. Definitely a nice place to relax. Lots of brick and you can even see where they brew the beer, which is always a nice touch!

Sometimes I go there and love it, and other times I don&#39;t.  And, I could order the same thing twice and get different experiences.

I had high hopes when I saw that they were opening.  It took forever to open, so it heightened my expectations.  Then the day finally came that they opened.  I went in with some friends later in the evening.

I got soup and an appetizer.  I had the Beer Cheddar soup and Pretzel sticks.  The soup was not at all what I had expected, but it wasn&#39;t bad.  I&#39;ve had it a few times since and I think it needs something, just can&#39;t tell what.  It needs to be served warmer though, for sure.

The pretzel stick weren&#39;t bad, so I wouldn&#39;t mind ordering them again.

Since then I&#39;ve gone back there maybe a dozen or so times, and when they are good they are very good... but sometimes the food just isn&#39;t at the love it stage.

The service has always been great.  I&#39;ve gone in there late and they don&#39;t seem to mind.  Which I hate at my job, and try my hardest not to do... but sometimes, it happens.

Yet there was just nothing memorable about this spot. Their home brewed beer was so/so and their prices were surprisingly high at 6+ a glass. They also had a large selection of housemade dishes that while sounding interesting fell a bit flat for the prices of 9-15 bucks a plate.

I am always a fan or brew pubs that serve food, and Lynne found Hopvine for us to try.

We arrived for a rather early dinner, about 430pm.  They wanted to seat us in the dinning area because we had two children (11 &amp; 8), but asked if instead we could sit at one of the high tables in the bar area.  No problem at all, and the kids love sitting on the high chairs.  

My wife is a pesci-vegetarian, and she found many options to choose from.  The kids were happy with the choices on the adult menu.  Our Chinese guest Long who we met at Farnsworth House was most enthusiastic about the Smoked Potato and I devoured the LARGE 1/3 pound Hopvine Burger and it rivaled any burger I have ever had at Kuma&#39;s Corner on Belmont.  Great tastes blended perfectly on this burger.  

Our waiter was very enthusiastic to make sure we had a chance to taste more than the two beers I was able to comfortably have and still drive us back to Chicago.  While I was there I enjoyed an &#34;Aurora Amber,&#34; an American Amber Ale, and thought it was a fine brew.  Perfect for a session, and ideal for quenching a beer thirst on a hot summer afternoon.  I also enjoyed an off the regular beer menu IPA, and found it to be a very drinkable, if not a slightly generic IPA, but again a good session beer IPA, not too hoppy, perfect for introducing someone to the style.  Our waiter also gave me tastes of the Urban Tumbleweed, a German-Style Hefewizen (not my favorite style of beer, but always willing to try) and the Brew Monkey, a Belgium Style Tripel, which he was particularly fond of.  I enjoyed both, but felt the Aurora Amber was the best beer of our visit.  

Finally, we finished our meal with a show stopping dessert, their Chocolate Stout Ice Cream Cookie Sandwich.  IT WAS FANTASTIC.  And only $5 for a dessert that we could all share and feel it was still too much.  It stole the show, and left us leaving with a happy glow after our meal, beer and dessert.  

I see that there are some rather disparaging other Yelp! reviews of this place, but I&#39;d tell you to enthusiastically give this place a try.  I found the physical space comfortable and modern without being overly trendy, the staff we interacted with were knowledgeable and very helpful, the food was a tad pricey, but good, and the beer was well made and tasty, though a bit generic for each style.  I&#39;d certainly return, and was glad to have had what I would consider an above average and delightful meal and few beers here."

The musician on Friday night nearly butchered every song that he sang. Ok. Not related to the restaurant, right? Fine.

My fiancé, parents and I went on a Friday night and maybe we had it coming. Well, it was 7 pm and there was live music. But it was very, very loud. We were seated as far away from the music as possible, and still had to shout to talk to one another. They eventually turned it down when we asked them to. Every so often, the musician took a break. Even when he wasn&#39;t singing, it was very loud in there from everyone talking so loud. Not very good acoustics, I guess.

The bar area is cute, but the farther back you get in the restaurant, the crappier it looks. It looks like they spent money on the front, but not on the back (where we sat).

My fiancé and I ordered 2 different beers, but I honestly don&#39;t know if they brought us 2 different beers. They tasted the same. Only a very slight difference, even though one was an amber ale and one was a wheat beer. 

We ordered the pretzel sticks appetizer. It was $8. Had I known that it would only include 3 pretzel sticks, we would&#39;ve ordered something else. They were good, but nothing different form pretzel sticks from any other place that&#39;s serving them right now. They came with a strange cheese and cinnamon butter, which was a nice change.

I had the tilapia sandwich. It had oranges on it, which was interesting. Though, the filet could have used some seasoning. It came with fruit, which was nice. I wouldn&#39;t order it again, though. I prefer seasoning to no seasoning.

My fiancé had a chicken sandwich and he said it didn&#39;t rate very high. My mom had their &#34;spoon salad&#34; and was disappointed as well. It didn&#39;t have any salad dressing and was apparently mostly tortilla strips. My dad seemed to enjoy his burger.

For starters, I discovered this place via Restaurants.com - I&#39;m always up for trying the new place in town, especially a new brew pub!  I told my friends about this place and of course they went right over there and then later informed me they saw the place wasn&#39;t taking Restaurants.com vouchers.  I took their word for it and just returned my voucher for something else, though I still wanted to try the place.  They also informed me that the place was not good. I take opinions with a grain of salt and wanted to find out for myself so I met a friend here for lunch this past Saturday afternoon.  I met her at 1:30 so the place wasn&#39;t jammed packed but there was no wait and we got seated right away.  

We got two menus, a lunch menu, the regular menu, and drink menus.  Our server went over the list of beers with us with a brief overview, and told us what was comparable as &#34;This is comparable to Miller Lite, Blue Moon, etc.&#34;   I like when places do that so you have an idea of what you&#39;re ordering.  We both had the beer similar to Blue Moon and enjoyed it.  For lunch my friend had chicken tacos, I had steak tacos.  If it weren&#39;t for us picking the tomatoes out of the tacos, we wouldn&#39;t have discovered the tooth pick IN each taco.  Lucky for us we discovered this before biting into our food so a suggestion would be to maybe have the toothpick visible on the OUTSIDE so people aren&#39;t biting into toothpicks in their food.  

Regardless of the placement of the toothpick, I&#39;d still go back here - they have a pretty decent list of food and drinks so I&#39;d definitely return."

The strip mall location kind of stinks but they more than make up for it with their upscale interior and huge, awesome patio.  The service was great, our server was super helpful and friendly.  We got flights of a few of their home brews all of which were yummy.  We went for lunch and were raving about our food for the rest of the day! Generous portions and very reasonably priced. Definitely a hidden gem in the Fox Valley area!

I drive to the Fox Valley Mall on the day before Christmas Eve (like an idiot, who waits that long?) and see a sign saying &#34;Now Open&#34; about Hopvine Brewing Company. I called my husband and said &#34;Let&#39;s meet for lunch, i&#39;m already stressed out about shopping.&#34; So we head over to Hopvine, situated next door to The Comedy Shirine (my guess is that they bring each other some biz, since this isn&#39;t the most lively strip mall).

Very nice and new on the inside, plenty of seating space, both at tables and at the bar. Our bartender was knowledgable on the beer (both their own and guest taps). After seeing another gentleman order a beer flight, we opted for the same...it was large! The bartender said each beer was 4 oz, but they definitely looked bigger. I am glad we shared. I can&#39;t remember the names of any of them, but I enjoyed them all. The IPA wasn&#39;t overly hoppy (I could&#39;ve stood it to be a bit hoppier), the Kolsch was good (the guy next to me said he thought it was bitter...he was 100% mistaken, it was the most unbitter beer ever). 

My husband ordered the Hopvine Burger (burger with onions, pulled pork, on a pretzel bun...your standard over-the-top-but-delicious bar burger) and I ordered the beer cheddar soup. His burger was cooked perfectly, although because it was med-rare it was a bit messy, but he had no complaints and said the flavor was awesome. The only downside (for me) from my experience was that I thought the soup was a bit watery for a beer cheddar soup. Cheese soup should never be watery...it tasted like it had been reheated. I am not naive, many restaurant items are reheated, but you never want the customer to taste it or think it. 

But alas, we will return. We&#39;re happy to see breweries pop up near us, and the beer was very good. It was also great to have a bartender who knew her stuff and could offer viable opinions (other than &#34;It&#39;s good&#34; or &#34;Its bad&#34;...seriously I&#39;m so sick of people without a palate serving me beer!). The menu looked really great, so we will be back to try more!"

I really really like it!  It&#39;s a nice locations with a very nice atmosphere.  I went there twice and at night, there was a small band playing really good music.  It&#39;s the sort of place that Aurora/Naperville needs...an upperclass brewery with good food.

Everyone was done eating and I was forced to order something off the menu that I didn&#39;t want.  The food came out and tasted ok but I had to force it down while everyone watched me eat.

Tasteless beers in today&#39;s world? If you cant make a half decent IPA just stop please. Cuban Sandwich was downright terrible. I ate it cause I was hungry and had a side of buffalo sauce to make it taste like something other than cardboard.
Service was actually not bad considering only one person was working the ENTIRE place. Water was cold, if that counts for someone? Space was nice but it all ended there.

They should be ashamed of the product for food and drink they put on ones table."

It was a Thursday night and there were only a few other tables occupied along with a few patrons hanging in the bar area. An underwhelming crowd at peak dinner time, even for a weekday night. The server was pleasant enough and seemed to be invested in her work. There was an extensive menu of beers to choose from although a few were listed as out of stock.  Of course the beer I selected was also out of stock even though it didn&#39;t indicate this on the menu. The fallback option was very good, so it worked out. The food was very good which was a pleasant surprise given the long delay in delivery to our table. The server apologized for the long wait indicating the kitchen was backed up. If so, it was clearly due to the lack of staffing in the kitchen, not the demand from the dining room. The atmosphere was great, the food was good, but the kitchen was extremely slow getting the food out which made the experience average."

Kinda made us nervous from the start. My husband loves new beers and and described his beer as &#34;salami soaked in coffee for three days and then smelling fresh cut grass&#34;. In other words he did not like the weekday mild beer, but he admits he should have done a taster before just ordering a pint. We ordered nachos and frankly it was cysco style chips slathered in same generic cheese sauce. Nothing special. With the lack of people we decided that was as fat as we were going to try and left. Waitress was fine, hostess guy would have been fired if he worked for me and I over heard his conversations. I don&#39;t think we will be back sorry."

He first let us try a flight of their microbrews; I decided on the Tumbleweed hefeweizen and my husband ordered the Amber ale. Both were good, atmosphere was modern and inviting. 

We thought we would come back to try to the food and more beer during the Bears game the following Sunday. We brought a group of 5, and had gotten everyone excited about it. Although they had the game on the TVs, they wouldn&#39;t put the game sound on and instead were playing annoying pop hits through the speakers the entire time. When we asked the staff about it, we were informed that the management didn&#39;t want that kind of &#34;element&#34; in here, so they would not put the sound on. We all felt like this restaurant was too new to already be making those kind of claims. Additionally, if that&#39;s not the crowd you&#39;re trying to attract, then don&#39;t even have the game on at all! 

We would have left at halftime since we didn&#39;t feel welcome, but our entrees hadn&#39;t come out yet. Entrees, which, despite the hype, were just ok. Wings and nachos were good, but the poutine needed more gravy, burgers and salads were average. Prices are also pretty steep. 

We really wanted to like it here, but there are other comparable microbrews where we would rather spend our money :("

The interior of Hopvine is beautiful, they did a fantastic job with the decor.  There is a lot of brick and wood and down to earth feel to the place, it&#39;s well laid out and just a generally nice place to be.  It wasn&#39;t very busy, but it was early on a Tuesday night, which isn&#39;t exactly party time.  I sat up at the bar and the bartender was great, very friendly and knowledgeable about the beer and types I might like based on my preferences.  I was able to try all of the beers that they brew in house plus a couple of guest beers.  They have a really nice selection of local micro brews (Solemn Oath, Two Brothers, Revolution, Lagunitas, etc) plus the beers they brew.  All of the Hopvine beers that I tried were great and are well worth the trip to try.  
I wasn&#39;t going to get anything to eat but they had a daily special of cheese curds that was for that day only.  These might have been one of the best things I&#39;ve ever tasted, they were that good.  They need to make them a permanent menu item, I would go just for those.  I also tried the plain cheeseburger, which was a 1/2 pound burger on a nice soft bun, served with fries.  The burger was cooked to perfection and it had a great beefy flavor.  
All in all a great experience, friendly knowledgeable staff, great atmosphere, excellent beers and awesome food.  Make it a point to check this place out, you won&#39;t be sorry."

We started off with some beers - I had their &#34;Brewdacious Blonde&#34; which was... OK. Nothing special and it wasn&#39;t very cold - almost like a cask-conditioned temperature which I found odd.  My husband started with a guest beer which was fine, and then sampled 3 of the Hopvine beers - Aurora Amber (meh) Alpha Mastadon (overly sweet, which was strange) and Brew Monkey, which was probably the best of those 3 but not impressive. 

We were craving burgers that night, so we both ordered cheeseburgers, mid-rare. They were cooked to temperature, but didn&#39;t have much in the way of seasoning. The generous topping of white cheddar was delicious, though, and the fries were very good. Overall, we weren&#39;t blown away by the food and the beer left a lot to be desired.

My experience was tainted by the lack of knowledge about the beer and service of the staff, and worst of all, the manager. Also, the tables lend to more of a buffalo wild wings vibe. Uncomfortable. Chairs too tall, tables too short.

The food was great. Meaty, plentiful portions. Not necessarily natural or organic, but flavorful. Unfortunately, OVERPRICED. 

Let me tell you my journey.

 We got a flight of the four beers featured by the microbrewery. The server set them down and walked away........OK. Thanks. Bye..... no explanations. No notes.

We then saw a staff member SPRAY THE TABLE and then wipe it down. Anyone who has ever worked at a reputable establishment knows this is wrong wrong wrong.

We asked our server, and two others walking by, &#34;What&#39;s an IBU?&#34; (on the beer list)
We got three wrong answers, from three people. Then a friendly patron at a nearby table let us in on Bitterness units. Thanks man.

I ordered the beet salad. And got a pile of greens, with one beet chopped to a tiny couple cubes. I let the server know and he suggested he bring out a plate of beets.????  The manager came over and said, &#34;I hear there is a problem here.&#34;
Oh. Ok. 

The salad was $8. I assumed that since there was no beets he would take it off the bill. Nope. Or, instead of asking me if I want more beets, bring them!
Bad manager. Poor customer service. 

The hopvine burger is awesome. Pulled pork on TOP of the burger. Sharp cheese, fried onions. Yum. Unremarkable fries, but standard.

 For the price, the experience has to be up to par, and the lack of knowledge KILLED IT. We paid $22 dollars for the sampler appetizer and they don&#39;t tell you where the animals are from. 

The taste is there but you can&#39;t price the dishes that high without a &#34;grass fed&#34; or &#34; organic&#34; label on them. 
They are just covering their opening overhead."

Specialty brews were dope. We all had the &#34;Brew Monkey&#34; which was one of the best local brewery beers I&#39;ve had in a while. It was flavorful, strong, and reasonably priced. 

The food was amazing. NOT typical bar food at all. &#34;Gourmet&#34; bar food (if that makes sense) at everyday prices. From the goat cheese dip, to the shrimp and scallions mac n cheese, to the bacon cheeseburger... The menu had lots to pick from and nothing disappointed. 

Atmosphere is comfortable and friendly. Our server was on point. Not loud, over crowded, and filled with douchebags like most area pubs can be. There was live music (no cover) and they were great too! Two thumbs up."

I ordered the soup of the day (Chicken Tortilla), and it was quite flavorful, and then ordered the Mac &amp; Cheese without any meat, and it was really quite rich and sumptuous! My friend ordered their sampler, which was a very sizable portion, and he enjoyed every bit of it. Another friend ordered the Baby Back Ribs, and she was delighted that the meat was quite succulent. I&#39;m giving it four stars because 1) the menu is too limited! There are no options for fish, and only a few options for shrimp. If you don&#39;t eat beef or pork (and I eat neither), this place is severely limited in its offerings. And 2) despite our waitress being a sweetheart, there were a lot of delays and ups and downs with our checks and orders.

I also told another employee before I left that you guys should have a BRIGHT NEON OPEN SIGN up so people know your open. I told her I&#39;ve been driving past this place for a few months and thought you guys were out of business,  It looks like there always closed from the street. The employee said the owners don&#39;t want an open sign. The employees are super nice, the food was top notch, but the owners are weird from my understanding.

Sat there for about 7 min before a waitress came to the table. I saw her look at us and walk over to the hostesses stand then came to are table. I ask if they figured out who was going to wait on us and she said the hostess usually tells the waitress who gets what table. She didn&#39;t do that this time. Are waitress saw us sitting there for a while with no one going to are table so she went up and asked who was supposed to wait on that table. My wife and I are not beer drinkers. My stepson is. We ordered 2 7&amp;7s and stepson ordered a very dark beer. The drinks came and the 7&amp;7s were flat. The beer was very good. They took the drinks back and we try 2 more and they were flat. The bar manager came to the table with a glass of Sprite and had me taste it to make sure it wasn&#39;t flat. He said we&#39;ll figure this out and get get you a good drink. He was very pleasant and they did get it figured out. We we&#39;re talking to the waitress and she asked if we would like a tour of the place. We said we would. The owner of the pub came over to the table and introduce himself and took us on a tour. His name is Doug and he was very hospitable and very nice person to talk to. He and his wife own the place. There were a couple of other issues like we weren&#39;t told the special of the night and there was a beer on the menu that it said was coming soon and the owner told us that it was out now so my stepson tried it and loved it. Another very dark beer. All in all we had a very pleasant time there and they did comp us a beer. The food was very good also. My stepson took home leftovers and he never does that. So right there tells you the food was very good. I would recommend this place. The staff seems to care that you have a good experience. They just need a little better communication among the staff I think.

Ordered the grilled steak sandwich.   While the steak may have been grilled, it was covered in a rich sauce with mushrooms and served on a toasted roll with swiss cheese melted on same.  It was a good sandwich, not very large, and came with a choice of fries, house made chips or a side salad.  I tried the chips, which weren&#39;t bad-could have used a little something to dip them in-very lightly salted.

$13 for the meal-quite a bit for what you get-a good sandwich, but not all that substantial-which might make it difficult to draw much of a lunch crowd considering its tucked in the corner of the plaza on the northwest perimeter of Fox Valley Mall.

I&#39;ll try it again after work some day to check out the happy hour crowd/atmosphere or maybe before or after going to The Comedy Shrine next door."

We were the first customers in the restaurant just before noon and lunch started off great.  The staff was friendly, my wife and I tried a couple of different brews, the kids got to watch the brew master work at his craft...then it all went downhill quick.

I ordered the pulled pork, unfortunately about a quarter of the meat was actually the fat cap from the pork shoulder.  After the first bite, I just picked through the rest, but I felt a bit ripped off for the price I paid.

My oldest daughter ordered the chicken fingers.  During dinner she made a comment that they tasted funny, but she nibbled away and finally ate about half.  On the way home she commented that her tummy hurt.  In just a few minutes after pulling into the driveway her nausea turned into vomiting.

After she got sick over and over I called the manager just to let him know that my daughter may have food poisoning from lunch.  I just wanted him to investigate and possibly prevent the next person from getting sick, and he promised to check out the kitchen.  Unfortunately his last comment was along the lines of...I hope it is food poisoning &#39;cause she will get better a lot quicker than if it&#39;s the flu.  I&#39;m gald to report after only 12 hours of vomiting my daughter was back to normal and feeling better.  So, I think it was not the flu.  

My daughters only request sounded like a Taylor Swift song, &#34;Dad, promise we never-ever-ever-ever-ever go back there again.&#34;"

The old Enchanted Castle got a new twist and turned into a nice brewery. The live musician sang wonderfully but it was a little bit too loud but at least it wasn&#39;t blaring bad music. 

       I ordered the South of the Border burger and it was very delicious! The chipotle mayo just made the burger spectacular. At the end of our meal, we ordered dessert which was a chocolate chip cookie mousse. It was amazing!

       The interior design was very nice with fun quotes on the walls and elements from the Enchanted Castle. Mainly, this restaurant was very yummy and I would invite my friends and come back."

After the event, we stayed at the bar for a bit. I bought a Growler to take home and had a beet salad with pancetta and baby greens that was out of this world good.

My boyfriend and I are beer enthusiasts so we were excited to see a new brewery open in our area.  As a huge foodie, I am always eager to eat at breweries because they typically have inspired menus.  Sadly, we paid $50 and left hungry.  The atmosphere is very attractive with clean lines and beer quotations on the wall.  I will say that the acoustics need some help because there are not enough elements to absorb the sound in the restaurant.  I would imagine that it would be very overwhelming to dine here when the restaurant is full.

For food I ordered the ribs and my boyfriend ordered a cheeseburger.  I should tell you I&#39;m a ribs enthusiast so I get really excited about eating this for dinner.  I was very disappointed with my entree.  The ribs had a foul smell to them and I did not enjoy their flavor.  My boyfriend was disappointed in the size of the regular cheeseburger.  As previously mentioned, we left hungry.  

Our waiter appeared very awkward and unknowledgeable of the menu.  This was disconcerting to me because the restaurant was so new I assumed he would have had better training.  I was also surprised that he didn&#39;t take an interest in our obvious disappointment in the food.  

That said, we both agreed that we would try the restaurant again in the future in hopes that they redeem themselves from our first experience.  We want to love you Hopvine!  Make it happen!"

I have been to Hopvine 4 times since they opened and had excellent experiences each time.  For those of you who remember the bar and pool hall called &#34;Pockets&#34; from the 1990&#39;s, Hopvine occupies the same space on the outskirts of the Fox Valley Mall.  It&#39;s in the strip mall adjacent to Toys R Us and next to the comedy club.

The restaurant &amp; bar has an upscale, modern, and somewhat urban feel to it.  The service is excellent, and you will find that the servers and bartenders are knowledgeable about the beers they sell.  The staff also has been very conversational and interactive - that is an important element when I am out at a bar or restaurant.

My favorite beer (and one of my all-time favorite beers ever consumed) is called &#34;Urban Tumbleweed&#34;, a wheat brew.  I have also tried a number of their other brews and have been very pleased.  One of the best things about Hopvine is that they offer free samples, so you can try before you buy.

I have only eaten there one time, and I had their burger.  It was outstanding, and the aged cheddar cheese made it very unique and memorable.

So I will be back.  In my earlier days, I would make it to the bar weekly, sometimes twice a week.  These days, I make it out 1-2 times per month to meet up with my friends.  I can&#39;t wait to get back there soon again!!

I do see a number of checkered reviews here on Yelp and disagree with many of them.  If you like microbrews, I would suggest ordering a flight, or best yet, have a tall one and ask for a few samples.  You won&#39;t stop at one beer, believe me."

I&#39;ve moved the family to the naperville area for work and immediately went to finding the local brew pubs for eats and beer. The Hopvine had great beer and the food was very good along with the service (Marcus was his name?).

My meal of the ribs and the collard green soup was good. The soup was actually my favorite part and it hit the spot. My wife&#39;s meal was the signature hopvine burger and that was fantastic; the pork and fried onions in bbq sauce sealed it. She normally doesn&#39;t rave about burgers but frankly she wouldn&#39;t shut up about it. The beer was also solid. The IPA, Amber and kolsch were sampled this trip. My daughter had a standard kids meal that i think was grilled cheese. She ate some which for an 18mo old means a positive review.

Of note, i spilled some of my soup on the table. I told our server that I wanted to purchase another order of the soup because it was delicious - he brought it complimentary.

We plan on smashing into this place again, soon."

I got the regular burger.  As someone who searches for gormet burgers, this place was at the top of my list.  The have 2 burgers on the menu, and one is called the hopvine Burger.  That one I think is loaded....didn&#39;t get it but might when I go back.
Even if u are not drinking alcohol, they make their own root beer as well as some seasonal drink (alcohol free).  I tried both.  The seasonal drink was so good, but I wish it came in a bigger glass.  It comes in a wine glass, so not much there.  The root beer comes in a normal soda glass, and is also pretty tasty.  
My wife got the fried chicken and waffles.  I am not a fan of fried chicken.....this is kind of like unfried fried chicken, if that makes sense.  It is chicken breast, so already reduced fat.  The fried part seems more like a crust which is really good. Never had waffles with chicken, but it was really good.  The maple syrup gave a sweet flavor to the savory chicken.  Good combination.

I recommend this place to anyone in the fox valley area....or western suburbs."

One of the killer items on the menu is the Tacos Duros. This is a ground beef or chicken taco sealed and deep fried in a corn tortilla toped with salsa and queso fresco. Even though the concoction is deep fried I don&#39;t find it to be greasy and heavy. Deep fried tacos are special and hard to find at most Mexican restaurants. The only other establishment that I am aware of that does a good deep fried taco is the Fire It Up locations. If anyone knows of any other deep fried taco options please let me know. Another favorite is the taco sampler. Although the tacos duros is not part of this you get two pork tacos, a beef taco, and a chorizo taco. I also especially like the enchiladas. The standard beef, cheese, and chicken options are available and they come with rice and beans. I like that you can mix it up and have two red sauce and one green or vice versa. Salsa and chips are provided and the chips are home made and delicious.  The lunch menu is greatly appreciated. Many of the most popular options are available including the tacos duros. The portions are nicely sized for lunch and include a side. Please see my review of the other location on third street. Although it is the same owner and many of the menu items are the same there are some differences."

I&#39;ve been to Mexican restaurants throughout the Western burbs and Chicago -- but El Molcajete remains my favorite. The staff is helpful, friendly, and very knowledgeable about the menu, while the food is fresh, full of flavor, and even surprisingly well-plated. The portions are pretty hearty, but this isn&#39;t just about getting a plate overflowing with burritos (obviously, there&#39;s a time and place for that as well). We typically spend about $30-$40 for two and walk away feeling stuffed but on top of the world.

It&#39;s pretty small inside (about ten or so two-tops), but there&#39;s usually an open table on weeknights or during lunch. Even on weekend nights, we&#39;ve never waited longer than 15 or 20 minutes. If you&#39;ve ever been to Geneva on a Saturday night, you&#39;ll know how ridiculous that is. 

After we&#39;ve gorged ourselves on continuous chips and salsa, I usually stick with my standby order of tacos and poblano rice (rice with poblano peppers, sour cream, and chihuahua cheese, where have you been all my life?), but everything that I&#39;ve ever ordered here has been incredible. My friends and family switch things up a little more often, usually with some help from our waitress, and I haven&#39;t heard a single complaint yet (which is rare in itself). If you&#39;re a guacamole lover, do yourself a favor and order the guacamole trio (Traditional, Habanero and Pineapple). You&#39;ll never go back to boring old regular guacamole again. 

The margaritas will also rock your world, but I&#39;m sure I didn&#39;t need to tell you that. My personal favorite is the blackberry (muddled lime, blackberry, orange liquor, organic agave nector, El Mayor reposado, and sugar), and I like it twice as much when it&#39;s half-price on Thursdays. 

All in all, this little downtown gem delivers great food at great prices, and has even better people. Keep it up, El Molcajete!"

I ordered exactly what I had last time. Corn and cheese dish as a side and a steak torta. The corn was old tasting and was watery. The torta was a flat mashed up mess. The meat tasted like it was cooked and put on a warming table for all day. Covered with cheese and slapped on a roll. I sent it back and ordered 3 tacos. Not better at all. Stewed meat that tasted old, some kind of special sauce. Served with two lime wedges. The wife had chicken enchiladas. Dry chicken wrapped in a tortilla with green sauce...straight from a can then sprinkled with cheese. This place really sucked. Won&#39;t be going back anytime soon.

I had two La Tomasita margaritas that are high on my list of top tequila cocktails of all time. They weren&#39;t cloyingly sweet or mouth puckering sour.

It&#39;s very evident that they are using fresh fruit in their drinks and that is what makes them so delicious  (we ordered a guava and strawberry margarita after that and they also didn&#39;t disappoint) We then got some guacamole which was average. We also ordered some nachos and we were very surprised when we got them, they were definitely not the nachos we expected. It was a tostada with melted cheese, beans and meat, although the presentation wasn&#39;t that great, they were pretty tasty. The steak tacos were flavorful but a little on the chewy side.

He had a Corona and I had two of the horchata drinks, which were delicious, by the way. The appetizer was great; the chips were homemade, the guacamole smooth and tasty, I wish it had more heat but whatever. Next, the fish tacos came out, after quite a while, and the fish itself was good but the sauce ruined them for me, completely. The sauce literally tasted like ketchup from a bottle you get at a Wal-Mart; overly sweet, fake and with absolutely no spice. What kind of Mexican food has no spice? This meal was ruined by the main course and I really thought that this place had potential. Maybe, I&#39;ll come back.

When we got our bill, I wasn&#39;t thrilled to see the charge for chips/guacamole when we didn&#39;t really &#34;order&#34; it.  If I am not mistaken, it was $7.  The server offered to bring it to our table right as we sat down and started to look over the menu.  As chips/salsa are most often complimentary, we said &#34;sure&#34;.  Every other table seemed to have it, so it sure seemed like a complimentary thing.  I was the only one of 4 who even likes guacamole so we wouldn&#39;t have ordered it.  It didn&#39;t sit right with me that they would bring a dish without being upfront that they are going to slap you with $7 for it."

There were about 15 of us, and we ended up taking up a long table along the back part of the room, when you turn the corner. Despite having a huge party, our food came pretty quickly and the servers were very attentive and polite. 

Some friends and I shared a guacamole and chips plate and a salsa and chips plate, which were pretty typical. I ordered the taco sampler plate, which comes with 5 different tacos and a mini cup of lime pieces. The moment the waitress set my plate in front of me, my mouth started watering. I personally thought I could down 5 tacos with no problem at all, but around the 3rd taco, I was stuffed! They were so good though, so I ended up finishing them.

I think my bill came out to be around $13, so I handed my waitress a $20, thinking I would get change back. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get anything back. My party was in a rush to go somewhere else, so I didn&#39;t have time to as for my change, but I a 50% tip is just crazy...

I&#39;ll be back here again, but I&#39;ll be sure that I get correct change back."

Bien Trucha is a well-known destination, but El Molcajete deserves as much renown and acclaim.  Unlike BT though, you won&#39;t mistake this for a trendy spot.  It&#39;s just an excellent place to eat some really delicious food with fast and friendly service.

Of course, it all starts with the food.  On our visit, the chips looked like they were just fried, and the salsa was tasty with a little kick.  We were thrilled to try as many of the tacos as possible and ended up going with three: compechanos (carne asada, chorizo, and melted Chihuahua cheese), cabos (beer battered fish), and the pork belly tacos.  All were delicious with the pork belly tacos as my favorite for its taste, though the pieces could have been crispier. The fish in the cabos were huge and balanced well by the red cabbage slaw.  The compechanos were less filled but nonetheless tasty.  Each order of tacos comes with a side, and I recommend the esquites, poblano rice, and the drunken beans.  The drinks are great here also.  The La Tomasita is a standout margarita so make sure you try it. 

We really enjoyed the service as well.  Our server was very friendly and accommodating.  The prices here are very reasonable though you could easily rack up a sizable bill by ordering so much of the delicious food.  I look forward to coming back!"

I love their chips, homemade guacamole, and I&#39;m a big fan of their steak tacos. For a side, go for the esquites - it does not disappoint!

We ate outdoors on the rooftop patio, which was quiet (soft music playing...thank you, El Molcajete for that...nothing worse than blaring music when the patrons can&#39;t even talk to each other) and had a good view of the town. Anyway...first time here and the three of us *loved* the food. I had the pork tacos with grilled pineapple and the corn as a side. My mom and aunt had the chicken tacos on top of guacamole...all as good as it gets. We also had guacamole and chips on the side. The guacamole was amazing and the chips were homemade, but greasy. They also gave us a small bowl of salsa, which was too mild. No kick at all. So that&#39;s my only complaint on the food (greasy chips and meh salsa). 

Our waitress was excellent - friendly, sweet, attentive, very compliant with separate checks, making sure my mom and aunt didn&#39;t have any dairy in their corn due to food allergies. She must&#39;ve picked up on my mom talking to me about my birthday, so at the end of our meal, she came out with a tres de leche cake with three forks for sharing. And the cake was absolutely delicious. My no-sugar eating plan, be damned! That cake was worth it.

I can&#39;t wait to go back and try the enchiladas with mole sauce - and a margarita. Cheers!"

First off, depending on how the tables are arranged there are only about 8 tables in the restaurant. My husband and I were seated in the corner booth nearest the front door and were essentially forgotten about after getting our drinks. My husband had to get a waitress&#39; attention when seating a table near us to ask for a refill (which had been empty for a while) and I figured it&#39;d be a smart time to ask for a refill, too. I also asked for more chips and salsa which we never received. If it weren&#39;t for reaching out to her we wouldn&#39;t have had an interaction with any of the servers until our food was ready to be served. Oh yeah, they also messed up my husband&#39;s side. 
Compared to all of the Mexican restaurants I&#39;ve been to in my life, El Molcajete has the smallest portions I&#39;ve ever seen. My husband and I left still hungry because we just wanted to leave after being completely ignored during our time here. The food wasn&#39;t horrible which is the only reason why I&#39;m giving them 2 stars and not one.

We sat with menus for 15 minutes, watching new seated tables get water and greeted before us.  The food was served randomly to every table. Our main course meals were served in multiple drops with no reasoning. My steak came out well before my wife&#39;s tacos.  We think they gave her tacos to a large party behind us.

It&#39;s the only explanation for some reviews-if people have a low baseline to begin with it impacts perception. This is a small place with ok food. Nothing to write home about based on our order today. My husband did give a solid thumbs up to the house made margaritas! I ordered chicken enchiladas and DH ordered fish tacos. We started with chips n salsa. IMHO Mexican places are first judged on chips n salsa, it&#39;s a gateway to their menu. The chips were homemade, a plus but a minus as the bottom half of basket very oily. The salsa was very good. The rice and beans were average, rice was not impressive. My enchiladas were chicken-flavorless, only hint of flavor came from sauce which was sparingly covering them. I think perhaps they have done better with other menu items, so I would still say give them a try."

i love cheese enchiladas, and these are probably my favorite. i&#39;ve also had the SINCRONIZADAS, which is basically a quesadilla with pork, pineapple and other flavors- seriously, one of the most delicious things i&#39;ve ever eaten

their chips &amp; dip are so good too. We had the nachos as an appetizer  but be warned, they are nothing like nachos you get a chain restaurant like chilis (i.e. gooey cheddar cheese and chips). these are authentic and seem to be baked - i highly recommend, but i could see some people not liking it. 

For dessert, we had the dulche de leche chimi, which is a deep fried crepe. i can just say that you need to save room for dessert because this was amazing.

oh, i also had the horcata - not quite as good as Los Burritos Mexicanos, but up there. however, this one is REALLY sweet - my husband wasn&#39;t a fan, since he doesn&#39;t like really sweet drinks, but i enjoyed it!"

I understand the portions aren&#39;t those of the chain or BOCA shops. That is not why we love it. The food is remarkable. Try a sample of each of their taco&#39;s and ask the wait staff what they recommend. They do have specialties. Tell them when things are wrong in a respectful way and I bet they fix it.

Chips looked like they were freshly fried, like home made, and tasted great.  Salsa was nicely spicy, had a canned tomato flavor to it, but I thought it went well with the chips and tasted good.
Taco sampler was great.  They use slightly smaller tortillas than a regular size corn tortilla, but there was plenty of filling on each taco.  Flavors for everything was better than we expected.  We loved every bite of every taco.  Normally there&#39;s at least 1 or 2 taco fillings we don&#39;t like at a taco place, but this one made us want to order them all again!
Enchiladas were good, the mole was tasty.  Came with black beans and rice.  The rice was good-average, nothing amazing, but a lot of places have lousy rice.  Beans were good-average too.

It is so funny to me how some places get crazy publicity and recognition for some unknown reason and places like El Molcajete fly under the radar. I&#39;m here to say: You want to try this place!  You need to try this place!  Trust me. 

While spending an afternoon in Geneva with my sister, we knew that lunch was on the agenda. We had no specific place in mind, but wanted to try something new.  So I turned to Yelp and saw El Molcajete. Four and a half stars?  Maybe we should check this out. We did. Oooh baby, baby was it good!

So it is truly a tiny restaurant. They seem to seat about twenty people at a time, but I overheard them mention they could do up to thirty for a private party. The tininess just adds to the charm. 

Chips and salsa are not an automatic on the table.  I&#39;m actually okay with that for two reasons. 1.  The prices are right. 2.  This gave us an opportunity to try a fresh mango guacamole instead (served with a side of salsa).  I have only recently entered the guacamole arena. I always stuck my nose up at it. I am older and wiser now. This was the second best guacamole that I have ever tried. Second only to my cousin, Christopher&#39;s homemade guacamole. The salsa was nice. A little different to me. I think some of the veggies were roasted, so the overall flavor was unique. 

We didn&#39;t want to overdo it at lunch, so we decided to split a chicken and steak fajita combo. Then, we realized that we could each try a little something extra. So, she chose a single taco al pastor with grilled pineapple. I chose a chicken enchilada with mole. We skipped the beans and went with double rice. 

Okay, so here&#39;s the lowdown. It was all good. The rice was moist and seasoned well. Her taco was fabulous!  My enchilada was so good that I was using a plain tortillas to wipe the extra mole off my plate (I wasn&#39;t ashamed...it was darn good!). The fajitas were just perfect. Nice large pieces of meat made this lunch an absolute success!    

Add to all of that, a charming staff who kept my water glass full in a clean and cute space and you&#39;ve got a winner. Half hour drive from my home?  No problem. I feel a date night with the hubby here coming on very soon. Ole!"

The food was excellent. 
Service was excellent
Atmosphere; very cozy and not in a good way.

Ordered the guacamole halbenero style and chips. The guacamole was amazingly good. Spice level was more of a Geneva, Il spice. Our server agreed that it was &#34;spicy&#34; for Geneva. Chips were just how I liked em. A little greasy.

J ordered the chicken burrito which was nice size. He said it was very good.

I ordered the shredded beef chimichanga with all rice. Nice size, lots of meat and tasty. Rice was good.

Sprite came in a bottle. That&#39;s old school, but bottles always taste better to me.

Unfortunately, the place is quiet, so we had the misfortune of sitting next to three loud mouth women; whining, complaining and gossiping about everything under the sun. Just when we thought they were going to leave, they sat and yapped away. I wish Bravo or VH1 would have been in the area, they would have cast these catty irritants in a minute. Go out , have a good time, but don&#39;t be that irritating in a small place. 

Other than being stuck by the Housewives of Geneva cast in training, the experience was excellent.

I don&#39;t think we were alone in hoping that they would leave either."

It&#39;s not as small as Bien Trucha used to be, but it&#39;s definitely cozy. Maybe seats 20-30. I came around 11:30 on a Saturday to meet a friend for lunch, and I was the only customer at the time, though it definitely filled up as the lunch hour went on.

It&#39;s not a huge deal, but at least at lunch, they don&#39;t seem to offer complimentary chips and salsa. We did go for some guacamole, though, which was served with a big (delicious) bowl of salsa as well.

The guac was definitely fresh, but I think it could have used just another 30 seconds of mashing and a touch more seasoning -- the bottom was mostly just avocado chunks. That salsa was really good.

I ordered tacos with shredded seasoned pork, and they came with a side of soupy black beans. The little bitty tortillas were stuffed full of pork, with a slice of avocado and some pickled red onion. Really good flavor, I actually think they were a little over-full, and would&#39;ve preferred a little less pork and a little more onion. (Maybe I&#39;m just a nitpicky weirdo.) The beans had great flavor and a little spice to them.

My friend got steak tacos and pretty much devoured them, so I&#39;m guessing she was pleased with her meal. :)

Service was friendly and prompt, with a good amount of checking in and refills. 

While El Molcajete didn&#39;t quite blow me away the way Bien Trucha did (does), the atmosphere is less hip and more cozy, more of a &#34;family&#34; atmospphere, with a somewhat different/expanded menu. It&#39;s definitely very good for what it is, and if you just can&#39;t be bothered to deal with the hype or the lines, El Molcajete is full of fresh and delicious flavors."

My husband and I stopped for dinner around 5 pm on Saturday. We got the last open table at the tiny restaurant.  We ordered the chips and guac which were amazing. I had the mango margarita and it was by far the most amazing margarita I have ever had.  For dinner I had the deep fried chicken tacos.  I&#39;m still thinking about them now. My husband had the burrito which he really loved, but to me it seemed quite small.

(It is.)

Their guacamole is good. It doesn&#39;t look like a lot (like, an ice cream scoop amount) but my fam ate it with the chips and had a little left over so it was just the right amount. They just hid the rest of the guac under some of the pile of chips so it looks misleading. Their chips are legit, and home made.

We had to wait about a half hour which wasn&#39;t that surprising because we went on a Friday at 6. I&#39;m vegan but they have a section of vegetarian entrees on their menu which can easily be made vegan. Although on my side plate, they couldn&#39;t help themselves and just had to sprinkle some cheese on my black beans even though I said no cheese. Whatever.

The food was pretty tasty, I got the fajitas which seemed like more food than some of the other entrees people ordered. They make a hibiscus water (Jamaica) which is really refreshing and not overly sweet. Our waitress was really helpful and our food got made pretty timely once we sat down. It kind of took a while for them to take our check, though, so we flagged down the guy behind the desk so we didn&#39;t take up a table longer than we had to.

Overall, pretty good, but for me, I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way just because of the wait and the overwhelming desperate-white-male-ness of the surroundings. But the food was tasty and well made. Just... Don&#39;t put something someone is allergic to on their food when they mention it twice! Just sayin&#39;."

And from the get go, our dinner focus was set on El Molcajete. 

When we walked in, the room was pretty empty but after all, it was 4:30pm on a Sunday afternoon. We were greeted and seated promptly and within a few minutes had two gorgeous margaritas in front of us (one traditional and one strawberry) to quench our thirst.  These were excellent drinks with obviously freshly made ingredients.  In addition, a bowl of fresh tortilla chips and some of the best salsa this side of the border appeared. The salsa looked like it came from a jar, but FAR FROM IT.  There was a roasted flavor to either the peppers or tomatoes, finely chopped cilantro and a nice heat at the back of the throat which was irresistible and addictive.

For our entrees, we chose the Mini Burrito dinner with chicken, which (again) looked like standard Mexican fare but had a much richer and deeper flavor profile than expected. However, the star was the El Molcajete Sincronisadas, achiote marinated pork quesadillas elevated to heavenly status by the guacamole, crema and roasted pineapple tomatillo sauce accompaniments.  This was seriously good food, well prepared, nicely presented and the price was very reasonable. 

By the time we asked for the check, the room was full of what sounded to be equally pleased diners enjoying the tempting menu selections.

We&#39;ll definitely be back soon."

It&#39;s on the main road that runs through the town. Not so hard to find, but if you don&#39;t know it&#39;s there, you may just walk or drive right past as I have over the past 10 or so years. 

This little Mexican restaurant is as authentic as you&#39;re going to find...especially in this area. They have pineapple guacamole as a regular item on their menu with an occasional guacamole special using something like Mango instead of pineapple. The guac alone is worth the drive to Geneva! It&#39;s creamy. It&#39;s flavorful. It&#39;s delicious. 

Their salsa is excellent; I practically eat it with a spoon. No need for those pesky chips, but there chips are quite tasty as they are made fresh in house.

I have found that the tacos al pastor entree is my go-to choice. The meat is tender and so well prepared!I love the small tortillas they double up and present beautifully. They very clearly take pride in their presentation and it shows! Their rice is basic but very flavorful. I don&#39;t partake in beans, so I can&#39;t tell you about their beans, but I can tell you that I love this place. 

It&#39;s small, seating probably about 20 or 25 guests, but its worth the wait should there be one upon your arrival. They have Mexican Sprite which is by the bottle but they also offer fountain beverages and they do an awesome job of keeping the tables clean and your glass full. 

I think this is the perfect place for lunch on the weekend or a cozy date night with your spouse during the week. The prices are totally reasonable and if they ever open a location closer to home, I&#39;ll be the first one standing in line on their opening day!"

We ordered chicken tacos marinaded in some orange spicy sauce. AMAZING!!! My favorite part is that under the chicken there was a spoonful of guacamole in the taco. Even the presentation of the tacos was pretty. I loved the black bean soup that came along with it.

I&#39;m not a huge guac fan but i always get it here. I think theirs is fantastic, probably has something to do with the freshly fried chips that come with. They are thick, crunchy, greasy and salty and pair perfectly with the gauc. I don&#39;t think they season the guac much and its very chunky but for me, it works.

The food was delicious and everything was homemade and it showed-from our chips an salsa to our entrees.  We ordered the enchiladas with mole and La Tampiquena.  I&#39;m very picky when it comes to enchiladas and mole sauce since my mom made me the best Mexican enchiladas growing up and this mole sauce came pretty darn close to my mom&#39;s recipe.  I was also impressed with the house salsa, it was full of flavor and had the perfect amount of spiciness.  We went to their location on third street and loved it.  It was a calm night and not too crowded so we felt very comfortable there and the service was outstanding.

My husband had carne asada tacos and he asked to not have any sauce, but it came with sauce that he did not like.  The steak was also overdone.   

I had the pork specialty dish - I can&#39;t remember the name of it - but it was roast pork in a spicy sauce.  The sauce was good, the pork was over done and had an &#39;off&#39; taste to it.  I asked for black beans and not refried, I got the refried.  

Came straight home after we ate and good thing - I was physically sick - food poisoning."

And this one is pretty darn good! They even did a nice job of cooking my eggs to an over medium. So many places over or under cook eggs!

The boy ordered the Potato Pancake Combo with 2 eggs scrambled with cheese, 1 sausage link, 2 pieces of bacon, and 2 cakes. These were like no potato pancakes we&#39;ve ever had!

I had limited money and was very hungry. I went to the Verdict Restaurant which is an establishment that is patronized by many County employees and court staff. A friend and I entered the restaurant which had both table and booth seating. The attractive waitress greeted us and provided us with menu. There were many choices and a very hearty healthy menu. I ordered the Tuna Pita which came with a cup of soup, fruit and cottage cheese. The portions were large and tasty. My friend had a Verdict Burger which was cooked to perfection with onion rings. The service was good and the restaurant was clean. The prices where very reasonable. The restaurant however closes at 3:30pm each day. It is a great place for breakfast , lunch or an early dinner. If hungry and want a good meal try this place out. Many Judges and Attorneys eat there when on lunch.

The reason for 3 would be my food came out 10-15 minutes before my husbands. The 4 would be the customer service. We had a really good attentive server other than the food mishap but she made it right with a dessert on her.
I chose the potato soup and was happy with that. It tasted homemade with lots of flavor.  My husband got chicken noodle soup which was a bit bland. It was definitely homemade but we didn&#39;t really like the flavor.  It wasn&#39;t bad we just didn&#39;t care for it.
The bread comes out in a full loaf and was a bit on the dry side but definitely fresh and homemade. 
They serve it with some garlic butter that does nothing for the bread. Just use the table butter that is prepackaged. The garlic ruins it as the bread has more of a sweet flavor imo.
The cheeseburger quesadilla was good. Exactly what you expected. We got the veggies on the side. They are both abbot greasy so beware. The fried were good. 
The steak and peppers was really good and flavorful. Reminded us of Swiss steak which we like.   We noticed some ladies at another table brought their own to go boxes. Smart, as my leftovers leaked on the way home but thankfully into the bag!
We ordered the eclair for dessert. Wow!  Delicious and the filling tastes like homemade pudding!!  Yummmmmm!!!
We will swing by here again someday!!  Check it out if your in the area. We thought the service was really good.  This is a nice, small family oriented establishment and not a chain."

After my mother&#39;s follow up visit to the eye doctor this weekend, she decided to treat her favorite son to breakfast. The follow up doctor&#39;s appointment was in Naperville which neither of us are familiar with. At first I did turn to Yelp for suggestions around that area, but after a few minutes of searching and checking reviews, Ma wasn&#39;t in the mood to try something new. 

Ma turns 79 next week. She said we&#39;d pass a place heading back to her house that she&#39;s been to before. But with the last year of her 70&#39;s approaching, she couldn&#39;t remember the exact name. &#34;The Trial?  The Jury?  Something about court. You&#39;ll know it when you see it&#34;. And I did. 

We were seated by a friendly hostess right away and a waitress who was just as friendly took our orders.  Ma was craving cook beef hash which looked delicious. She wasn&#39;t able to finish the plate which she was ok with because it gave her a snack later. 

I had the country biscuits and gravy with sausage and two sunny side up eggs. (Have a mentioned my high cholesterol?). It was probably the best country breakfast I&#39;ve ever had. I also had a side of rye toast. 

It&#39;s not as close to some of the other places by my mother&#39;s building, but I&#39;d gladly drive the extra distance for their food."

We are new to living in Wheaton and looking for independent, local places to eat. We adore breakfast places and diners. We found Verdict because of yelp reviews. 
Our normal breakfast place is normally so crowded at 10:30 (you know the right time for breakfast) so we decided to try Verdict because it is within walking distance (~ 1 mile) from our house! 
Coffee was good. Just coffee nothing special but not bad (and I&#39;ve had bad coffee at breakfast places). My omelet (chef&#39;s omelet) was the perfect size! Omelets tend to be either too small or too big when it comes to breakfast places. It also had the perfect amount ingredients beyond egg. Not too man of all the extras to make you think you have no eggs but enough where it&#39;s more than an oblong shaped group of scrambled eggs! 
Hash browns were awesome! Perfect crust on them, just like they should be. Potatoes cooked but not mushy just beyond the crust. And there was also ketchup already on the table! I&#39;ve had waitresses look at me weird for asking for ketchup (I thought ketchup on hash browns as always been normal). The pancakes were good. Fluffy but dense at the same time. Didn&#39;t skimped on the size of pancakes due to it being a &#34;side&#34; for the omelet like other breakfast places. Other places in the area make bigger pancakes if you order them by themselves which is okay as long at this is reflected in the price.
My husband had the Mexican skillet and ate it all so I assume no complaints.
Only complaint was that the waitress took forever to take our order. Another waitress passed by with a pot of coffee, twice! Wish she had asked us if we would like some coffee since we had our cups flipped up and waiting. Waitress also only showed up minimal times. Drinks, order, 5 minute &#34;how do you like everything&#34;, refill the coffees because I asked, and to give the check. So not the worst but not the best. I appreciated her not being overly friendly, but still pleasant. It would have been nice though if she had asked if we had ever been there or if we had any questions. These are just picky things and did not effect my rating. 
Also the only reason I knew we paid at the front is because I saw the register at the front and when she just handed us a bill and walked quickly away, I put two and two together (and the fact it is a diner).
Many probably wouldn&#39;t like the atmosphere. It&#39;s normal diner-esque. Nothing trendy or contemporary about it at all (which isn&#39;t a bad thing). I personally love the old diner feel (would be even better if there was a counter top!)
Maybe next time we&#39;ll go for lunch!

So to recap. Good, solid breakfast. Work on the service a bit."

I love breakfast foods, and the Verdict does have very good breakfast, but I had eggs earlier in the day, and since it was dinner time, I decided to go with their dinner fare, specifically a Grecian dish.

After debating between a few things, I decided on the Slouvaki Chicken Platter. It comes with a choice of beef or chicken, and I went double bird. There&#39;s a picture of the dish on their menu, so I was swayed by that. 

The meal also comes with soup or small greek salad, their house rice, potato, veggies, a mini loaf of their homemade bread, and a complimentary dessert (jello, rice/chocolate/tapioca pudding, fruit, or ice cream. Since I was a to go order, the ice cream wasn&#39;t an option. Also, I ordered double veggies instead of the potato. I&#39;m not quite sure if I got double veggies (no pic, sorry), but I did get rice and a serviing of veggies in my tray. As for my soup, I went with the roasted red pepper, which is a common soup in their rotation (check site for daily soups). For dessert, I opted for the chocolate pudding.

I really want to give the Verdict a 5 star rating... Food and the prices are right, but there&#39;s always a small issue with my experience. This time, when going through our to go orders (there were just 2; a coworker and myself), they forgot my pudding! I was really looking forward to it too. 

As for the rest of my meal... YUM! The chicken kebobs were actually my least favorite part of the meal. They were good, but nothing really stood out. They were skewered with red onion and peppers, but the chicken really had no outstanding flavor. Besides the chicken, everything else was excellent. The yellow rice had a slight butter flavor and pieces of carrots in it. The veggies featured green beans, broccoli, and carrots. They weren&#39;t wilted at all which was very surprising! The homemade bread was super good. About as big as an italian beef roll, the light brown roll tasted amazing by itself, with butter, and in the red pepper soup. The soup was my favorite part of the meal. Not sure what exactly is in the soup, but I will definitely be ordering again. No chunky veggies and not too heavy; not sure if it was completely cream or broth based.

In the end, I actually did call back and pick up my pudding. I was also given a complimentary eclair. The custard inside the eclair was amazing! All in all, the Verdict is a great place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and I&#39;m looking forward to my next visit."

They even have oversized coffee mugs.  Plus, it&#39;s called the Verdict since it&#39;s by the Wheaton courthouse and I love cheesy names.

Hands down, they have the best breakfast in the area.  Hashbrowns are crispy on the outside and tender and buttery on the inside.  And, if you don&#39;t want to be a fattie and have the fruit instead of hashbrowns, they give you a very nice portion of super fresh fruit.  Usually places that offer fruit as a sub give you a measly wedge of overripe cantaloupe!  Not here.

They have a ton of different benedicts to choose from including a smoked salmon option and it&#39;s under $10.  Hello screaming deal!  Their version with spinach is also delish.  And, they have the BEST bacon in the world.  I am not kidding.  You get 4 pieces of the thickest and tastiest bacon and it&#39;s cooked just right so it&#39;s crispy and chewy at the same time.

At lunch, you can&#39;t go wrong with one of their melts.  I like the turkey one on rye.  Their rye bread slices are humungous and they use real turkey not the slimey deli kind.  With lunch or dinner, you also get your choice of soup.  I&#39;ve had several and all were very, very good with the chicken, rice, lemon being my favorite.

The staff including bus boys have been here for years.  This tells me the owners are good and treat their employees with respect.  I really appreciate that.

We went back again two weeks ago and my husband had a great burger and I had a good salad.

Cute Greek diner with excellent food!

Worth a visit!"

Located just on the other side of the street from the large shopping center that is home to Target and Ultra Foods it might not be immediately visible to those passing by (I had never noticed it before) but is well worth keeping your eye open for. The inside is clean with a good amount of seating available, there&#39;s nothing particularly noteworthy about the decor.

After walking in I was immediately greeted and seated, after looking over the menu I noticed that most of the items here are court themed (hence the name Verdict restaurant). I decided on a skillet called &#34;The guilty&#34; which contained cheese, ham, onions, sausage, and bacon. For a drink, I also decided on ordering the municipal building code violation also known as Cola (well, not really be it would be funny if they carried the naming convention scheme all the way).  I chose pancakes instead of toast as the side. My waitress was friendly and courteous. Not too long after placing my order my food was ready.

The skillet I received was nice and hot, the sausage and meat pieces were well cooked and flavorful. The big thing that made this skillet great was that the potato&#39;s at the bottom were nice and crisp. The eggs were spot on, and everything had just the right amount of seasoning. This was one of the better skillets I&#39;ve come across. The pancakes here were fairly average but I did appreciate the thick and sweet maple syrup that came with it. Overall I was very happy with my meal.

My general opinion of the verdict was very high, great service, great food at a fair price. I wouldn&#39;t say the food here is the best of breakfast places I&#39;ve visited. But it&#39;s certainly in the top 3. I highly recommend Verdict Restaurant, the verdict is in and they&#39;re guilty of being a great place to stop for breakfast. Five stars, case closed *pounds gavel*."

I overheard the customer state that the kitchen was out of capers and that something was wrong with his onion, the server was visibly upset by how the customer handled the situation. She immediately sent the owner to the table but the owner&#39;s attempts to fix the order were met with vulgar language and rude, loud comments!!! I had to bite my tongue because I couldn&#39;t believe how mean the man was to the employee and the owner!

The waitress was attentive but not overbearing.  Their menu was so big, it took me a while to read through.  They have sandwiches, burgers, steaks, gyros, pasta, seafood, and even stir fry.

GYRO PITA:  For under $9, it came with 1 side and a soup or salad.  There were plenty of meat in the gyro (so much that I had to take it home).  The sweet and sour cabbage soup was really good.

And what better way to end a meal than with a dumdum...love those suckers.

My family has been here a few times in the past year, and each time it&#39;s been absolutely delicious.  I&#39;m not a big eater by any means, but this is one of the VERY few places that I will push myself to the max stomach capacity to finish everything (and then some).  The wait staff is extremely friendly and attentive, but it&#39;s the food that really drives the rating.  Everything is prepared virtually perfect...hash browns are crispy, eggs aren&#39;t overdone, pancakes fluffy and moist, and bacon/sausage, delicious. I always get the standard breakfasts, while my wife usually gets a skillet.  And we definitely need the extra order of bacon AND sausage (the pup at home lucks out with those leftovers).

Why four and not five stars?  The food is great, staff is awesome, prices are just/fair, location is close, and food is great (yeah, I said it twice), it&#39;s missing just that little &#34;something&#34; to get it to five.  Perhaps a menu item that is truly original?  Something that differentiates the menu from your standard ones....  I HIGHLY recommend this place and will continue to take my family there."

Like &#34;The Innocent&#34; basically a veggie skillet, followed by &#34;The Guilty&#34; a meat   filled skillet. How could you not love a diner called &#34;Verdict Restaurant&#34; just down the road from the DuPage County Courthouse.  A clean, tidy and family friendly spot.  It was a nice stop after some shopping in the area. 

Friendly service from beginning to end and a HUGE breakfast menu.  Me and my friend had lingered long enough to see that they offer either the breakfast or lunch menu after 1130. Lingered--yes, we didn&#39;t feel rushed or pressured to leave.  Once we had our breakfast dishes cleared, our server still asked me if I wanted a refill of my coffee.  

I opted for the veggie egg white omelet, it came with a choice of hasbrowns or fruit and then either toast or pancakes.  I just wanted the hashbrowns and fruit and they were fine with my request.  The egg white omelet was great.  The veggies were fresh and not overcooked and the omelet itself was not watery--which sometimes happens with lots of veggies.  The omelet wasn&#39;t greasy either--another big plus. The fruit (melons and grapes) was very fresh, but the hashbrowns were just meh. The coffee is piping hot, but not as strong as I&#39;d like.  

The verdict?  I&#39;m guilty...of liking Verdict Restaurant!"

They have a huge breakfast menu, and everything looks good.

I went with the Ironman Omelette. It&#39;s an egg white omelette with mushrooms, avocado, tomatoes, onions and green pepper, and is served with some fresh fruit on the side. I was a little iffy on how it would be with the avocado inside the omelette instead of just on top, but it was really tasty. I would definitely order it again.

It&#39;s a good thing too: for a second I thought some sort of surveillance camera, with the ability to detect barristers from non, would sound off when I entered the place.

Fear not, this little diner is a charming cross between a Ma and Pa kitchen, a bank, a law library, a conference room, and a judge&#39;s chamber. From the lighting, to the clientele rolling in after court session down the road, to the art work, to the &#34;supreme court-like columns&#34; it has atmosphere.

It also has very good service and very good food! We managed a 2-seater booth for lunch and I really enjoyed my spinach feta pie. Great flavor and it came with a nice portion of fresh, fresh fruit. My friend had one of their lunch/dinner specials: artichoke and chicken linguine. I grabbed a taste; also very good. 

There were also about 4-5 different types of fresh soup, as well as 5-10 types of desserts; carrot cake looked good, as did the homemade apple pie.

From the tons of stacked up &#34;to go&#34; containers, I suspect that is a massive additional draw here at The Verdict. I mean, do lawyers really have time for lunch?

Now that we&#39;ve moved to Bartlett though, it&#39;s pretty close.  As of last night, the Verdict is officially going into our the rotation.  

We met a couple of friends for a casual dinner and left happy and full.  Success!  I had the $9.99 Gyros Platter - a giant plate of gyros, onion rings (instead of fries), yummy chicken noodle soup and homemade bread with garlic butter. Normally, I think this comes with a scoop of ice cream, pudding, rice pudding or jello, but our waitress didn&#39;t say anything about it and I was so full that it didn&#39;t matter.  Quite the deal if you ask me.  My friend had some basted eggs, bagels, etc. - normal breakfast foods that must have been cooked right (otherwise she wouldn&#39;t have eaten them).  Our kids both had chocolate chip pancakes, sausage, bacon and hot chocolate.  

It&#39;s a clean restaurant with a nice staff.  Easy to find.  Open when I&#39;m hungry.  It&#39;s a great go-to for any meal of the day!  Trust me, we will be having more meals here soon."

This small, family owned restaurant will meet and exceed your expectations. The staff and owner&#39;s are friendly and their service is superb and quick as well. 

The menu has anything you could ask of a diner. It has breakfast items served all day, lunch, dinner, sweets, steak, hot dogs, gyros, sandwiches, soups, salads, it has it all!

The prices are very fair, especially since their serving sizes are quite large, which is good if you like leftovers!

Overall this place will continue to get my business, so long as it stays open. Five thumbs up!"

No.  But it does deserve a few reviews, even if all of the others are 3 stars.  The Verdict is a great alternative to fast food.  It&#39;s a traditional Greek-owned diner.  HUGE portions.  Giant menu.  4-5 specials of the day each day.  For a late dinner, I went for the BBQ pork chops, with soup, baked potato, vegetables, and my choice of any dessert in the display case.  

We brought two of my three pork chops home as leftovers, which made dinner for the two of us a few nights later.  My soup was excellent, the pork chops and baked potato were delicious, and the piece of cherry pie I picked out was gigantic.  (Note I said nothing about the taste of the cherry pie.)  

The place is large and clean, the service is great, and the prices are very reasonable.  It&#39;s everything a diner should be.   If you&#39;re on Roosevelt Road west of Wheaton, going to or from Central DuPage Hospital or the DuPage County Judicial Center, this is your best alternative for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a late dinner.  Just skip the cherry pie and go for one of the cakes.  Or the Greek pastries."

Hash browns were soggy and tasteless. Found black avocado pieces in my omlette, which is not acceptable! Please serve fresh produce. Mushrooms weren&#39;t cooked at all, the whole thing again was just tasteless. Also gave me stomach pains for the rest of the day. Not recomending this place at all. If you want good breakfast, go to State Street Diner."

The potato pancakes are huge and full of fresh green onions and so yummy!  My daughter orders the Blue Moon Smoothie every time we go to The Verdict and loves it.  Made with fresh fruit.

Service was chaotic, but I understood. Their menu(s) are huge; I wanted breakfast food and we went at 1, so I had to ask for that. Thank goodness we got there before the power went out, I got at least one cup of coffee (really good). Our service could have been better, but what else can you do besides re fill water? We got our food pretty quick, but our waitress didn&#39;t come back at all, she was probably dealing with kitchen chaos. I got a pancake combo, and I wanted turkey sausage and two bacon strips, opposed to one sausage and two bacon strips. I ended up getting five turkey sausage links, ate two of them, asked for bacon (waitress took my WHOLE plate away to get it), then came back with bacon. The bacon was fried to a crisp; I wasn&#39;t going to complain, because I still got DOUBLE MEAT!!! YA BABY! Plus, she probably had to spit on my food for being a stickler...I would have...haha, just kidding!

I got scrambled eggs, the meat, and whole wheat pancakes instead of regular. Needless to say, I&#39;ve had better service here before, but this was fine. Kudos to them for running on a generator since the power went out...and OPA!"

It is one of the family restaurants that is in my usual rotations for dining out .  The menu so huge, sometimes it is difficult to choose what I want to eat! I would highly recommend any of their soups or salads.  My usual sandwich is the chicken and avocado, served warm with melty swiss cheese. Yummy. They have delicious coffee and homemade bread and whipped garlic butter.  Yummy again! My only gripe is that it is not big enough inside. The place is almost always busy, you would think they could have expanded into a bigger space by now!"

Went to the Verdict on a whim after visiting Cantigny Park with my family.  We tend to seek out local family owned joints and this place fit the bill.  So we dropped in for dinner and it was so tasty! 

We all opted for breakfast for dinner and it was such a good choice.  The skillets were extremely tasty, but the the Pancakes, oh the glorious pancakes, they were the BEST pancakes I&#39;ve ever had.  A perfect mix of malted and buttermilk pancakes.  The pancakes, I&#39;m still not over them. 

Dinner for 3 including some insanely good pancakes, tea, and tip was 30 bucks!! 

The only concern I had was that service was a bit slow at times because they were so busy."
