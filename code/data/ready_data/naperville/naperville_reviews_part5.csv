This is a fast food place, not a restaurant. It is a good place for carry out and delivery. In fact, they deliver free of charge if one orders on a weekly basis. I wish that this place were spacious enough for sitting down. The food on the other hand is freshly prepared and good to taste. We ate pepper chicken, mixed veg kurma and naan. It is Indian cuisine and spicy. They serve both vegetarian and non-vegetarian lunch/dinner. They also serve snacks like dosa etc. We were told that the menu is dynamic and changes every day. The prepared food tastes like a home cooked meal as opposed to rich restaurant fare. This is an average fast food place where one can afford to come on every day basis. If someone is looking for a fancy restaurant, this is not the place. In fact they don&#39;t have a rest room for customers. Cleanliness is average.I will come back and I will recommend this place to friends."

Ruchi serves tasty delicious food that you would find in a South Indian home. Bursting with flavor, low in oil (very rare when you eat out) and quick friendly service.

So far tried Alu kurma, Mango dal, beans and carrot curry, opo pusulu, peserattu, moong dal with spinach, Chana masala, samosa chaat. Every dish was great!

The lunch specials are a great value. I was told that they even deliver.

Order takeout, enjoy, and support a new local business in Naperville!"

We wanted to go to yet a new place for breakfast! The boy saw this as we were driving by and we though crepes might be a nice change! It&#39;s seems quite basic inside with mismatched tables and chairs. It didn&#39;t feel like a warm, upbeat breakfast place though.

Looking at the menu and with some advice from our server, we opted to share a couple of crepes. We started with the Banana Nutella Crepe with chocolate hazelnut spread on a warm crepe with sliced bananas and whipped cream on the side. It was exactly what it said it would be! Basic, yet good. I don&#39;t know that it was necessarily work $8.50 though.

We finished with Suzette&#39;s Benedict which is a toasted Brioche with sliced Ham, three-cheese soufflé, and gruyere cheese baked topped with Lemon Cream Sauce. This takes like 25 min. to make, so we had time to eat the first one before it came out and then waited a bit. It was good and cheesy! Super hot though! We had to wait longer for it to cool so as not to burn our faces off! Now... $13.50... It was good, just... 

The boy had a soda, which came in a can. We really dislike when places do this. It&#39;s way cheaper to go with a soda fountain. The problem is that people don&#39;t want the hassle of keeping it clean. Paying $2.00 for a can of coke is ridiculous!

Our server was super nice. This was a little hoity toity of a place for our tastes. It was nice to try, but we won&#39;t be back. We can get crepes that are just as good at other places that have a warmer atmosphere."

If I&#39;d left a review after our first visit over a year ago, I would have. We went for breakfast then, and were definitely impressed. Yes, it&#39;s overpriced. But, the Eggs Benedict were amazing. The cappuccino was delicious. We sat by the fireplace and comfortable chairs, got great service and loved it. The decor and the music were lovely.  Our service was good. But...

That wasn&#39;t our experience this past Saturday. We got there at 10:50am. By the time someone got us it was 10:58 and we were told it was too late for breakfast. I should have listened to myself and not stayed. We ended up getting lunch since that was our only choice. 11AM on a Saturday.  What happened to brunch?  I found out that brunch was only available on Sunday. Huh? 

We had the crab appetizer. For more than $10 you would think you would get more than one crabcake. Not so, and it was a small one at that. My husband ordered the croque monsieur and, although it was tasty, it lacked much ham and didn&#39;t have bechamel sauce, which disappointed him. I had a mushroom and caramelized onion crepe. The crêpe was cooked to perfection. But on top of that was far too many mushrooms. I like mushrooms, I mean, I REALLY like mushrooms, and still thought they used too many.  The crepe also featured pearl onions, and if they were caramelized then I don&#39;t know the meaning of that word. I was disappointed. 

Near the end of our meal, my husband found a piece of small plastic (about the size of a fingernail) in his sandwich. Actually I should say he found it in his mouth. They comped the sandwich, which was nice I supposed but he certainly lost his appetite after that. I didn&#39;t even leave the restaurant before my stomach was upset. I don&#39;t know if it was having a very rich lunch instead of breakfast or what, but my reaction to the meal definitely cast a pall over our day and we were there celebrating our wedding anniversary! The service was OK. Not great, not bad, just slow. I did find it interesting (and disappointing) that we waited more than 20 minutes for appetizer to appear. No crackers or bread to tide us over while we waited for the appetizer. Oh well, live and learn I suppose.  We are going to give it another try for breakfast at some future point and I&#39;ll update my review then but at this point I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d recommend lunch at all. What a disappointment.  We went quite out of our way to come here for our Anniversary breakfast / brunch and it actually ruined the day for us."

I&#39;ve always been pleased with their service and food. My favorite is breakfast at Suzette&#39;s. You have to try the Suzette&#39;s Benedict, as there is nothing better. It&#39;s brioche bread topped with ham, egg soufflé, gruyere cheese and a light lemon cream sauce. It&#39;s light and fluffy and just so delicious.  My complaint today was the service. Our server and her assistant greeted us promptly, but never introduced themselves. There was a period of time where we had to wait for them to return to put in an order of pastries from the patisserie, ask for water and cream for coffee.   Also, the beignets from the patisserie came deflated once they warmed them, I&#39;m assuming, in a microwave. Very disappointing. The strawberry croissant was delicious.  I didn&#39;t come for the pastries, though. The Suzette&#39;s Benedict was phenomenal, as always."

We decided as a group to order dessert. Went to the case to choose a four dollar dessert. When The bill came we were charged eight dollars. They put the desert on a plate, sprinkled it with powdered sugar and doubled the price. Ridiculous!  You&#39;re better off getting your pastry to go!"

After being seated at a table in the middle of the charming-looking dining room, we were given water and menus. EVERY SINGLE WATER GLASS HAD TRACES OF LIPSTICK. (And it had been bussed and napkins placed, ready for new customers) Switched with other open table, yep, lipstick traces. Revolting. Should have left at that moment. Waited 20 minutes with wait staff walking past---nothing. My guests wanted to give it 5 more minutes. No server came over. A woman with a binder (manager perhaps) walked by at least 2 times and nothing. We got up and left. Waitress gave us a nasty look for getting up and walking away when she was just getting ready to (perchance) take our order. Lady with binder behind register never acknowledged. Sigh....

We will, however, continue to pick up the occasional goody at the French Market on Saturday---those kids are polite and it is quick. Eh, maybe we will continue to get goodies. The experience in &#34;bistro?&#34; soured the whole &#34;creperie thing&#34; for us. 

Word of advice, clean your glassware rims---people DO look."
suzettes-creperie-wheaton,Kelly L.,luoidj4uPysXg2rbQCEcjQ,"Tucson, AZ",1,1,1,62,40,2AQGxu7YnqhOhYqHX6tKqg,2.0,2015-12-02,"A group of 6 of us went here for their Christmas tea the Friday after Thanksgiving.  The cost was $31.50/person, and an additional $10 if you wanted 1 glass of champagne to be included also.  I have to say that I was underwhelmed with the entire experience. The location is really cute, their internal decorations are as well, and the pianist was lovely!  in fact, the pianist was the best part of the tea.  Other than that, I was completely underwhelmed.

The staff seemed to be confused and were running around a lot during the entire event.  we were constantly running out of tea and had a really  hard time flagging anyone down to get more.  It appeared that there was only one seating because the place was empty when we got there but filled in about 15 minutes.  I have a feeling that was why the staff wasn&#39;t able to handle the amount of people there - everyone was at the same point of their tea at the same time.  Would have probably worked much better if they had staggered seatings.

we were sat at a table for 6 in the middle of the room with the piano.  It was so packed that one person (thankfully she&#39;s quite petite) was able to take one of the chairs that was about 4 inches from a table behind her.  once she sat she made the joke that she hoped she didn&#39;t need to use the restroom since she wasn&#39;t sure she&#39;d be able to get out of her chair!

The tea was served in 3 courses.  the first two were individually plated.  And each time, we had 5 people get their plates and the 6th waited at least 3 minutes before they received theirs.  When the first course came, we asked if the server could let us know what the 5 items were that were on our plates.  He seemed annoyed that we asked and could barely answer.  He then found a cute menu card on another table and gave it to us.  I guess we were supposed to have that on our table.

The 3rd course was a dessert buffet. The entire restaurant stood up at the same time and created a line that snaked through tables, around into multiple rooms, etc. it was really awkward, we even had tables who couldn&#39;t get up because people were standing behind their chairs.  By the time my table got up to go to the buffet, there were no more plates left.  and the assortment was decimated.  there was barely anything left.  We sat back down and someone came up to ask us how everything was.  I usually just say &#34;fine&#34; and have them go away, but at this point I explained that there wasn&#39;t a 3rd course left by the time we got up there.  She apologized and created a nice tray which she brought to our table which was very nice.

we then sat for a good 15 minutes to get our bill.  When we got it, we asked to have it split between 2 credit cards.  Another 10 minutes goes by before we got the checks.  They explained they get really backed up because everyone is trying to pay/leave at the same time.  I then mentioned to the other person who was paying that the tip was included so do not add an additional one.  The waiter overheard me and stepped up to our table to state that the tip wasn&#39;t included.  So we had a discussion about that, pulled the original bill, and showed that it did have a tip added (I assume because we were a party of 6).  He then apologized and said he just wanted to make sure because they were just stiffed on a tip of a table who&#39;s bill was over $100.  which was completely unnecessary and totally unprofessional

Just an overall underwhelming experience.  From the other reviews, I&#39;d definitely try this place for a normal meal, but wouldn&#39;t ever go back again for a tea."

Then my daughter ordered a banana-nutella crepe and I ordered a ham and swiss crepe and some bacon. The nutella crepe was flawless. Mine was a little cool and the cheese not melted well, but when we sent it back they hate it up and it was great. It looks like they also have cooking classes which I may look into in the future.

Try the pan au chocolat, flourless chocolate cake, or the chicken salad sandwich). 

Today, however, we came in for breakfast. Missing Paris, we started with fresh-squeezed orange juice (AMAZING) and cafe au lait, which was not the best coffee ice had, but very good, none the less. Our main course was eggs with &#34;fines herbes&#34; which are unlike any scrambled eggs I&#39;ve had outside France. They are fluffy, creamy, and decadent. The applewood-smoked bacon and fresh fruit cup were the perfect accompaniment. 

Despite being new, our server, Megan, was funny, helpful, and spot-on.

Kudos to Suzette&#39;s for making macarons by hand rather than using a machine. From the appearance, I liked how they were larger in size and imperfect in shape. The seasonal pumpkin even had an additional decoration on top. The texture was off though - the macarons were dry and crumbly. Since they are made from egg whites, this can easily happen if they are overcooked or if the temperature is too hot. I was really hoping for the flakey exterior and chewy goodness that I expect from a good macaron. 

Either way, I&#39;ll be back to try more of their items. It could just be that I had a bad batch. I like their creativity and the food looks great from the photos."

I was just there yesterday, and had the most delightful tea sandwiches, followed by red currant scones/clotted cream/lemon curd - and, for dessert, a fresh crepe, filled with fresh bananas and NUTELLA.

It looks very European from the inside with white table cloths and dim lights. Perfect for a romantic dinner! My friends and I went there last Saturday August 2nd for brunch. At first we sat indoors and where wondering if the patio was open. I kindly asked the waiter if we could be moved to the patio which upon entrance seems to take you abroad. The patio is clean, with many outdoor furniture that made you feel as if you were in a terrace in a small bistro in France. My friend ordered the French eggs with tomato concasse. I ordered a chocolate croissant which was absolutely amazing! I also ordered crepe with spinach. The dish was sizable and very tasty. Plenty of spinach served with fresh fruit. 

I am not giving two stars because the food was bad but because my waiter spilled hot, scalding coffee over my inner thigh as he was serving me a cup. Nick positioned the coffee pot in front of me facing my direction. As he was about to serve me the coffee pot hit the sugar container and he spilled the coffee on me. 

The waiter apologized and was embarrassed. He asked me if I was okay. I responded that my thigh hurt. I must admit that it took some effort for me to not go off on the waiter, make a scene and embarrass my friend. I thought it was a rule of thumb to serve on the side of the customer and not facing them. After moving on from the experience, I thought that perhaps I would get some type of discount or offer for ruining my pants and burning my flesh. But that was not the case, this action reflects poorly on the restaurant&#39;s customer service. I guess I needed to make scene for the manager to come out and offer to pay for the meal. I know for a fact that other great restaurant do offer their customers some sort of compensation for the inconvenience."

Jasmine tea was my favorite but so many were available like black and lavender teas. Service was great- water cups were never empty and our tea cups were staying full. We had a 3 course meal featuring 5 mini- sandwiches presented on the plate. Then we received two scones with lemon curd and a cheese. For dessert we were offered to chose 1 from 7 types and they were huge entree sizes. I had the best tasting creme brûlée.

We really wanted to come here for their 2 p.m. Saturday tea service but they were all booked for the next several weeks.  I&#39;d still like to come back &amp; try their tea service.

My friend and I had the Autumn Vegetable Crepe w/Mixed Greens, the Beef Stroganoff Crepe w/Beet &amp; Onion salad, the Creme Brulee of the day (orange) &amp; the Apple w/Salted Caramel &amp; Pecans crepe.  The food was all delicious with once exception: my Apple crepe didn&#39;t have more than a scant drizzle of the Salted Caramel sauce &amp; the apples were barely cooked.

I was disappointed in their very small wine selection.  The menu just lists a few types of reds and whites to choose from, no names of the wineries given.  Now, I am definitely not a wine snob &amp; don&#39;t know much about wine at all - but when the least expensive glass on the menu is $9 a glass I would at least like to know what I&#39;m drinking.  I certainly could have asked, but I thought this a not-so-classy way to cut costs for the restaurant.  Even if their selections change often they could print a small wine listing separately rather than have it on the main menu.

The service was okay - our server was gracious but she could have been more attentive.  With dessert we each ordered a coffee and she did not offer us a refill until it was time for the check.  I said yes, I would like a refill, since we were still chatting, but alas, my refill never materialized.  I don&#39;t know if they put anything complimentary on the table at dinner time, but at lunch there was no bread or anything offered.

The pricing was a bit higher than other nice French creperies I&#39;ve been to, especially since it was lunch time.  For the two of us, with 2 glasses of wine, 2 crepes, 2 desserts &amp; 2 regular cups of coffee it was $81 &amp; some change, before the tip, at lunch time.

Black rose tea just tasted like regular black tea.
The lavender mandarin orange was very unique and citrusy--we all liked it

For dessert my friend ordered the chocolate mousse cake, and three of us shared it. It&#39;s a tiny portion but it&#39;s really dense, so it was perfect with the tea.

This place needs some sprucing up.

Old, worn floral carpet.  A handful of fruit flies buzzing around our tea sandiwches.  One bathroom.  Really?  One bathroom after you&#39;ve been sipping on tea for a few hours?  One bathroom for an establishment that caters mainly to women?  

Service could also use some improvement.  Our teapots came out with lukewarm water.  Not even hot enough to steep the tea.  We had one server for our 13 person party and she seemed a bit frazzled the entire time.  Giving us the wrong menu.  Putting a shrimp tea sandwich on someone&#39;s plate who we had just told her ad an allergy to shrimp.  Also, at the end of our alloted time, we really felt as if we were being rushed/pushed out.

Tea is reasonably priced, but I&#39;ve had better tea from a store bought tea bags.  I tried the Moroccan mint green gunpowder tea and could barely taste the gunpowder flavor because of the overpowering mint.  

We were served an array of tea sandwiches (cucumber with cream cheese, chicken salad with mandarin orange, shrimp, and sundried tomato) that were delicious and surprisingly filling.  Afterwards we were brought rich, buttery cranberry scones with a side of lemon curd and cream.  For dessert I chose the caramel apple crepe. I could only take two bites because it was too sweet for me."

They have an extensive wine list but only 4 bottled beers -  two French, one Belgian, and one Swiss.  I tried their Kronenbourg 1664, which is not very common, and it was an ok lager.  Wife had the spicy coconut shrimp crepe (it wasn&#39;t spicy) and I had their beef bourguignon crepe (like pot roast beef).  Both were ok, but pricy at about $18 each.  The service was also quite slow.  An ok place for a nice but pricy venue in downtown Wheaton, and don&#39;t be in a hurry."

I had already forgiven them too many past missteps but decided we&#39;d do the Christmas Tea, my bad!  We gave this as a present to grandmas.

Only reason I&#39;m writing review is because as soon as we left, owner made sure to cancel our reservation on Open Table so I couldn&#39;t review them there. Think it&#39;s very telling that she&#39;d take time to make sure it was cancelled within 5 mins of us leaving. Perhaps this has happened before???

On website under Christmas Tea there is a link to Open Table &#34;Reservations Required&#34;. I tried to make it for 2:30 but Open Table said it wasn&#39;t available but offered noon, it took my reservation so we were set (or so I thought)
Got to Suzettes to be told they only do Tea at 2:30. When I told them I booked from their reservation link under their Christmas Tea the owner was called. She came out to tell us how wrong we were, not to apologize. 
Owner-&#34;We call all our Christmas tea reservations 24 in advance so since we didn&#39;t call you you obviously aren&#39;t having Christmas Tea&#34; And I&#39;m supposed to know this how????
After I explained what I had done, this was her explanation.
Owner-&#34;We have that link to Open Table but we block off the 2:30 Christmas Tea time so no one can make 2:30 reservations&#34;
Me-&#34;So why do you have a link if you can&#39;t make online reservations? Do you have to call to make Christmas Tea reservations?&#34;
Owner-&#34;No, you make it for a different time, and note that you want Christmas Tea so we change it to 2:30&#34;
Me-&#34;It might be helpful to say on your website to put this in the note&#34;
Owner-As she rolled her eyes &#34;Yes that might be helpful&#34;

My daughter suggested we come back at 2:30. I didn&#39;t really want to but it was her present so I said ok. But OF COURSE that wasn&#39;t possible. They were all booked. Couldn&#39;t fit us in. They make food 24 hours ahead. Really they don&#39;t make a crumb more than required so there&#39;s no way we would be able to squeeze in.

My Mom told her this was a Christmas present, no sympathy. She offered us French Tea which had some of the stuff from the Christmas tea (wait, you make that in advance and there isn&#39;t any extra right???)

Left to go to Ivy, spent less than $30/person. Got apps, entree, dessert and alcohol. Way better food and service. Thanks to Suzettes we may have a new holiday tradition of lunch at Ivy. I&#39;d suggest you all try the same.

Past times we have gone were told we couldn&#39;t sit in nice seats by fire because they had a reservation at 2 (this was noon).  When pressed they let us sit there and rushed us through the whole time.

Another time I asked for a side of green beans. Told they don&#39;t have green beans. Pointed out that the Salmon came with green beans so I knew they had them. &#34;only enough for those entrees&#34;. Ok so they very carefully plan the menu, no substitutions.
This worked for Charlie Trotter, but news to Suzettes-you are not Charlie Trotters.

While food isn&#39;t bad it&#39;s not the best thing I&#39;ve ever had and certainly over priced for what it is. I&#39;ve had cold crepes on more than one occasion. For a place with Creperie in their name, I&#39;d expect them to be the best ever. Maybe these are made 24 in advance too.

There were times when I&#39;ve gone into just to get something from counter and it would take someone so long to acknowledge me that I&#39;ve left.

Again my bad for giving this place so many chances. I want to support local but i give up on them."

I must tell you though that in the 6 or so years that we have been going to Suzette&#39;s it has been hit and miss. It&#39;s like eating a delicious plate of fried Padron peppers, every 5th or 6th one will burn you.

We mostly go to Suzette&#39;s for Petite Dejeuner. We like the French version:  croissant (usually pain au chocolat), café au lait, and freshly squeezed orange juice. It&#39;s our Saturday morning date. 

On one occasion we were told we could not have the freshly squeezed orange juice because there were no oranges. Now downtown Wheaton is not located on a deserted island. I believe oranges could have been obtained if someone had been willing to put forth the effort to run a simple errand. We were given some canned stuff and our bill was the same as for the freshly squeezed juice. More frequently in recent years, they run out of our favorite pastry. These things happen, but it shouldn&#39;t happen often. If this particular pastry is popular then more should be made or ordered.

Occasionally we have been treated as if we were an annoyance rather than paying customers. Sometimes it seems the staff just can&#39;t be bothered.

Then again, we had dinner at Suzette&#39;s this week spur of the moment and had a lovely time. Our crepes were delicious. The hostess, waiter, and sommelier were polite and attentive. We relaxed. It was a very nice experience.

I still recommend Suzette&#39;s Creperie. I simply cannot guarantee your experience. Take a chance."

But when we went there on this Friday night, I immediately got a bad feeling when the waiter asked if we would like a table by the window and we said yes and then he said no because &#34;that table was reserved&#34; (so why did you ask?) and I noticed there was only two other couples in the place. Nonetheless, we were jammed into a corner table with my wife&#39;s back squarely up against a pole lamp (are those still fashionable in France?) The bar area was hopping, though, which explains why it took so long for my wife and I to get our wine. The waiter could not take our alcoholic beverage order, so we had to wait on the busy bartender. Finally, she came to take our order for a $32 half-bottle of wine but then came back several, several minutes later to apologize for not having that wine (even though she had given us a sample of it several, several minutes before) claiming the last bottle had been served at lunch. But she did offer us a more expensive wine for a discount, as an apology, though that bottle was $20 more than the one we ordered. Sniffing the possibility of being hustled, I said, give us that  $52 bottle for the same price as the bottle you had run out of, $32, and she said no. She offered a glass of the wine, $10,50 each, and I said, sure at a discount, and again she said no.At this point we walked out, fed up with being treated like fools at a place that pretends to be a white linen restaurant when the service is more honest and quicker at White Castle."

After much searching for a restaurant.com &#34;deal&#34; that made the most sense, I decided on this place.  I figured it would be a nice place to go for brunch when my mom comes out to the burbs to visit me.

So today we went...around 11:00 (it&#39;s a saturday).  Downtown Wheaton wasn&#39;t too crowded, and this place wasn&#39;t crowded at all.  I think there were people at two other tables.  The hostess was very friendly, our waiter was as well.  I ordered the banana/ nutella crepes (oink!) and my mom ordered the caramel apple crepes.  Both were DELICIOUS! We had to spend at least $37.50 per this voucher we had so we split the fruit and cheese plate and had a side of bacon with our meals.  With 18% tip it came to about $43...not bad considering the amount of food and the quality of food, that being great.

I am so glad I chose Suzette&#39;s Creperie for my wedding reception brunch. Donna, the owner took very good care of me. I admit I was that difficult bride to deal with since I&#39;m a perfectionist and a bit frugal. The entire affair was way over my budget, but I was happy with the fact that everything was executed in a very professional and personable manner. We had our own private room for about two hours at no extra charge.

The only thing I didn&#39;t like is that I was charged more for the wedding cake while paying the bill, than what was told to me earlier. 

The food, as usual, was awesome. The vegetarian quiche was a hit. They also gave us the leftovers to take home. 

The best part about my wedding brunch was the cake. Chef Sarah did a great job of creating the cake of my dreams, EXACTLY as I wanted. Five stars is even less to give to this place."

I can&#39;t believe this place doesn&#39;t have 5 star reviews! Perhaps it&#39;s not the best place for a large group (although I believe they do have a party rokm). But the atmosphere is fantastic, especially if you go off peak hours with a date and can get one of the armchair tables. Incredibly cozy with food to match. Exposed bricks and carpets, dim lighting and soft decor. There&#39;s also a bakery up front where you can have a quick pastry and coffee, though the main show is I&#39;

The food is a comfort oriented blend of French and American. A tad pricy, costing $25 or so per person for a full meal, and the portions are not large. But as a rotund and large appetite possessing male, I never leave hungry. Not at all. Skip salad and and start with a soup. If it&#39;s the fall, the pumpkin cider soup is absolutely fantastic. 

I like the spicy shrimp crepes. My fiancee loves the quiche. But I&#39;ve never tried anything bad. Dessert is good as well. Overall, this is one of the best, if not the best, date places in Wheaton."

The entire bill. Nothing had been comp&#39;d. We had a $65 bottle of wine that the last two glasses were ruined with coffee sprayed inside. My pants, shirt, and blazer need to be dry cleaned and they thought it was appropriate to have us pay the whole bill. Never once did the manager come over and ask me if I was ok. I had to push them on the issue and they finally comp&#39;d our appetizer and desserts. $30 off a $170 meal. In my opinion this was handled unbelievably poorly. If they had simply acknowledged the incident, asked me if I was ok, and comp&#39;d our ruined bottle of wine I probably would have thought they did the right thing and returned for another meal someday.

We came here on a weekday morning for a late breakfast.  We were the only people in the restaurant the entire time we were there, so...not such a bustling weekday business.

The service was great!  But really, how could it NOT be?  We were the only table.  Everything we got was delicious.  It took a while for the food to come, but we were prewarned that this would be the case by someone who&#39;d been there before.  

The atmosphere was definitely feminine but elegant.  At first I felt underdressed...like I should have been wearing a summer dress with a jaunty hat and white gloves...but as we ended up being the only people there the whole time I didn&#39;t feel too bad about it.  

The french-style scrambled eggs were delicious!  Creamy and fluffy, they were unlike any scrambled eggs I&#39;d ever had in a restaurant before.

My crepe was very good.  It&#39;s hard to ruin a crepe, but it happens.  This place definitely did it right.

It&#39;s right on Front Street a block down the street from the main Wheaton Metra station. 

It was a hot day in mid-October, so when we got there the doors were wide open and we got to see most of the interior. The front of the shop has large, comfy chairs and tables for tea. The middle part has larger tables and chairs if you&#39;re going to have food. And there&#39;s a rear patio with an exuberance of umbrellas.

I loved every bit of the interior. The black beadboard. The shade of blue used in the dining area. The large wine bottle and various Picasso-like paintings hung on the walls. The patterns on the couches and the tablecloths. Heck, even the soft music played over the speakers. Someone went through a lot of trouble trying to recreate Paris (or, at least, France), and considering how often I kept thinking I saw a grey mutt at the entryway to the patio, (there was not one) they did a great job.

The food: the appetizer was a three-cheese soufflé, possibly served over a cream sauce. This was perfect; crispy exterior, spongy but moist interior. It stood tall for a soufflé, which is good. I almost liked it better than the dessert soufflé I&#39;ve had.

I ordered the salmon crepe with tarragon cream sauce. The crepes come with a side of lettuce and topped by a few raw onion slices. The crepes themselves were made nicely; the texture was right on. But the filling was fantastic. The salmon was cubed and not overcooked, and the cream sauce (with reduced white wine) was complex and the perfect complement to the salmon.

My wife ordered the spicy coconut shrimp crepe. The filling for this was spectacular. I could have ordered a spicy coconut shrimp curry from our favorite Thai place and it would have been hard to beat this filling. The flavors were very well balanced, there was a good shot of curry-based heat in the filling, and the shrimp was perfectly cooked.

For dessert we had the lemon curd with blueberry coulis (it&#39;s supposed to be raspberry coulis, but raspberries are starting to go out of season.) Again, great ingredients, a strong lemon curd with real lemon flavor and no artificial off-notes or bitterness; this was also a great dish.

Suzette&#39;s was quite the find, and it&#39;s a place I&#39;m going to set aside for future special events. Wheaton&#39;s lucky to have a place like it!"

For starters, the ambiance and decor are wonderful. We sat on the back patio and it was just like a Parisian cafe! Wrought iron chairs and tables with cute, rustic tablecloths. A nice canopy covered the sun and kept it cool. There were potted plants in the corner and lights strung up for the evening. The interior seemed like a formal living room. 

We all had the french onion soup for the first course. It is a bit salty, but not in a bad way. Lots of soft, big pieces of onion. Flavorful broth. Great Gruyere cheese and croutons, which are much easier to eat than a big hunk of bread.

My sister and I had the beef bourguignon crepes which were fantastic. The beef was tender, and the vegetables really soaked up the sauce. There was a nice balance of meat and veggie. The side salad was great too, just the right amount (not skimpy as some reviews would day) with a nice amount of dressing too. My husband got the spicy coconut shrimp crepe, which he thoroughly enjoyed. 

The dessert crepe was amazing. We got the lemon curd with raspberry coulis. OMG. So incredible, fresh and soft, tart and sweet. We also shared the banana pudding, which was spectacular. Nice big chunks of banana with the creamy pudding and salty caramel and crumbly wafer. 

The service was not bad, just slightly slower, very European. Surprise surprise considering its a Parisian cafe! We had a 3 course, fresh cooked meal in an hour. Very reasonable. 

My only criticism is the prices. A bit steep. 17.50 each for the beef crepes and shrimp crepe too. For the shrimp, okay. The beef could have been cheaper. The desserts were 8.50, again a little pricey. Soups were 5 for a cup and 6.50 for a bowl. Not so high that I would never return, but I will plan my visits accordingly and would probably not be a regular customer."

My husband and I popped into Suzette&#39;s early in January and didn&#39;t realize that a Christmas Tea was scheduled for that afternoon. The hostess sat us at the bar, which was fine. Husband had the ham and cheese crepe with sunny side up eggs (I had plate envy) and I had the quiche sampler plate. Both delicious! We left with a good feeling about the place. The service was a little slow since no one else was being served, but we chalked it up to staff being focused on the impending tea service. 

We visited again a couple of weeks later on a Sunday again, around 12 pm. The place was nearly empty but we were asked if we had a reservation (we didn&#39;t). The hostess told us that several large groups were coming in but that she could seat us at a small table. Ok, thanks, I guess. The whole time we were there only two other tables of 4 came in. Those are large groups? Whatever. I was told there was a wine list but one never came so I ordered a coffee. In a French restaurant I expect French press. No dice, I got something tasting more like a day old Starbucks. I ordered the much envied ham and cheese crepe, imagining the oozing egg yolk mixing with the ham and gruyere, playing joyfully together. But it was not meant to be. The crepe arrived naked, no eggs in sight. By my count, there are only 13 items on the brunch menu so I would assume the staff, the cooks, the kitchen expediter, the guy that busses tables, etc., would be familiar with the menu. When I could flag down my waitress, I asked, didn&#39;t the crepe come with eggs?

According to the menu:
Ham &amp; Cheese Crepe with Eggs
Eggs prepared as you like with a Ham and Cheese Crepe and Mixed Greens Salad

Oh, she said. And then added that, yes she thought so. She disappeared into the kitchen for  5 minutes and returned empty handed, saying my eggs were on the way. I rationed, believing that my yolky yolks were preparing to meet my anxious crepe. It occurred to me that she didn&#39;t ask how I wanted the eggs, but I assured myself that they would give them no way but sunny side up. Again, no such luck. I was given a small bowl of scrambled eggs which sat untouched and became the anchor of my disbelief in how bad the service was at this place. When the bill was presented to me, I got a &#34;sorry the eggs were late&#34; but I was not asked why they were untouched. The hostess was not even at the exit to hear my tale of woe, so I left sad and disappointed. Overpriced/incorrect food + slow service + rude hostess = scratched off my list forever. So long, Suzette&#39;s!"

The restaurant was only moderately crowded.  We received brunch menus and ordered. To say the service was leisurely is an understatement -- it took nearly an hour to prepare our food, during which time we were allowed to select one tiny croissant or brioche.  When the food came, the dishes didn&#39;t include a green salad, which was clearly stated on the menu as coming with the dish. When we asked our server, she said the salad wasn&#39;t included with brunch, only lunch.  We pointed out that the brunch menu disagreed, and she only shrugged. Although we hadn&#39;t enough time left to order dessert (who knows how long that would have taken!) we decided to order something from their small bakery.  We stood at the bakery counter for about ten minutes while servers passed by without so much as a nod.  We gave up and left.

This experience was as close to a rip-off as you&#39;re likely to get in Wheaton. The food was good, but not great. The prices, considering the amount and quality are outrageous. When three people cough up $70 for brunch, you expect excellence, not mediocrity and very bad service. If it weren&#39;t for the reasonably good food, it would be one star or less."

Even the bathroom was darling. Some men looked like they were dragged in by their women. Happily, of course!

Unfortunately the food was too overpriced to be forgiving of its hits and misses. 

French onion soup: 
Different from traditional but too salty. It probably tasted fine when it was first made but the salt probably got concentrated as it sat on the stove, waiting to be served. 

Once we added ~1/4 cup of hot water into the soup, it was very good. 

Salmon crepes: 
Rich and flavorful, best thing we ate there. But at $15.50? *gulp!* Good thing we split it. And that mom&#39;s birthday only comes once a year! 

Bananas Foster Crepe: 
Not at all what we expected. It looked pretty (see picture) and tasted nice. If you could get a bite. OMG you needed a hacksaw to cut through that thing. What a mangled mess. There was no way that was made fresh because the crepe was rock hard. Seriously, at $8.50 you expect more.

Service: 
This place is definitely for women of leisure because the service is s-l-o-w.  Some old ladies were sipping martinis -- wonder how many years they&#39;ve been sitting there, waiting for their bill?

I was surprised they were out of alot of things by 2pm on a Friday. We were fine but the table next to us had to try and order 3 different items before they found something they weren&#39;t out of. Shouldn&#39;t they be most stocked right before a weekend?

Overall nice place but there are certainly better places out there."

I came here a couple months ago for afternoon tea.  I was skeptical about having afternoon tea at a French restaurant but it turned out great!  I walked into the restaurant and the first thing i see is a Patisserie with glass cases of wonderfully but sinfully delicious baked goods and desserts!  I told the lady behind the counter i had reservations for tea, i was politely told to wait a minute while she took care of a customer buying baked goods, while she was doing that someone did seat me right away.  I was seated at a cute round table with a comfortable arm chair.  The waitress brought me water and the tea menu.  I chose the Jasmine Orangie!  All i can say is Amazing!  Then after  she brought me a cup of mushroom bisque, it was tasty, and 5 different tea sandwiches, egg salad, cucumber, shrimp and chicken salad. They were good but when i was finished she asked if i wanted more so she brought a second helping of those sandwiches.  Yum!  I was feeling a little full but i had to make room for the scones which came with Devonshire cream, lemon curd and jam.  Yum!  By this time i was full and could barely eat dessert.  She brought the dessert menu, I chose the orange creme brulee!  Yum again!  The hot water for tea was refilled, food was good, service was good.  Definitely will be back!  Oh and of course before i left i bought a few baked goods to take home!   I couldn&#39;t help it!  They had crepes, chocolate croissants, macarons and more!  :-)"

First, their pate is awesome (I give it a 4/5). I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve ever had, but after having wine down the street at Tasting deVine, pate is a great addition to the palate. They were too busy for their tea service (which they should expand or broaden in some way), but anyway, we got to eat.

Second... as some reviews have said, the service here is pretty horrible. I might as well have gone to a Chinese restaurant where I expect to get seated, gotten my order taken, and received the food. 

As an ex-bartender who always treats the wait staff well, I left less than a stellar tip for a waitress who did less than an average job."

Cute decor. Restaurant was just about empty.  I was very disappointed in the service. Maybe they think the food makes up for indifferent service? Or do they think because they are a &#34;French like restaurant &#34; it is cool to be distant, unsmiling?  Wine was served by a different wait staff( possibly due to age of waitstaff ) or she thought she was a sommelier. She was annoyed that she could not rush the table. Appeared too busy to be polite. There was one table with people that we could see. I don&#39;t think our waiter smiled one time.  The food was Interesting. We asked to split a salad between two people. They ploped the salad down and extra plate and we had to devide the salad ourself.   Coconut shrimp was good.  
I am disappointed that the service was not better because the decor is so nice.  They had an opportunity to make a fan of a Wheaton resident.  Too bad."

We ordered and waited for an hour for our food during which the server never came and checked in on us.  We had to waive her down to get her attention.  When the food came it was delicious and we were happy, but we had ordered drinks and still the server never came to refill or ask for others.  Then, when the bill came, the drinks were ridiculously priced.  It was $11.50 for a very small mimosa and $5.50 for orange juice that was not even freshly squeezed.  We were fine with that though.  It wasn&#39;t until we looked at the bill and it was over $100.  We recalculated her totals and it only came out to $80.  I tried to call her down, but she refused to answer, so we spoke to another server and he fixed it for us.  We then waited for 15mins for her to take the cards, but she never came.  We found her at the bar counting her tips and another women had to take it from me because she refused to even look at me.  I was so upset, then my fiance informed me that another table had had an issue with the check as well.

I honestly think the woman was trying to rip us off.  Make sure you calculate your checks here!!!"

According to my friend we were lucky to get a 7pm reservation.  She called and they told her they only had 5:30 or 8:15.  She wouldn&#39;t give up and said she really wanted 7pm and after being put on hold, they magically had a table at 7pm.  There were 2 tables sitting empty by us for some time which had us wondering.

We hadn&#39;t seen our friends for awhile and so there was lots of wine consumed.  There was only one server working and you don&#39;t get your liquor from the server, you have to wait for the wine guy (I&#39;m not typing that sommm..... word I don&#39;t know how to spell).  That was kind of bad since he seemed very chatty with people at the bar and there was more waiting that we would have liked.

The food was great!  We had the fondue for 2 and they were not stingy with the bread, we got an extra plate pretty quickly.  They 3 of us ordered the special which was a crepe stuffed with seafood.  It was chocked full of seafood.  Someone had the duck with the risotto and she said it was good as well.  The side salad on the crepes is not a side salad in the sense that it&#39;s just some greens on your plate.  I wouldn&#39;t even call it a salad, it&#39;s about 1 scoop of greens, so if you want a salad you need to order one.

Nobody got a crepe for dessert.  The other couple got a cheese plate which had 2 kinds of brie, 1 REALLY thick and creamy blue cheese wedge and a mystery cheese.  No bread or crackers was served with it which we found unusual.

Yes, this is an expensive place and that&#39;s hard to take given it&#39;s location.  Most of the places in Wheaton are pretty reasonably priced, but they aren&#39;t like this.  This place is quaint, the cuisine is very unique and they have a full time wine guy!"

My boyfriend and I decided to give this creperie a chance over la France cafe in Lombard what a mistake that was!! We decided to eat outside but no one ever came over to serve us, (even though there was hardly anyone in there and, the server had seen us). I had to go in myself to get my own menu and order coffee. Upon receiving coffee and some pastries (must say the pastries were not that fresh/ i ordered chocolate croissants).That would of been overlooked if the service was any good. We even had to ask for sugar for the coffee. After receiving the sugar, we got no spoon. I think the location and decor is excellent but sadly the service was the worse I&#39;ve ever had.

The combination of tables with upholstered arm chairs is really charming.  But the value of the food leaves much to be desired. I ordered a cup of French onion soup and a croque monsieur and it cost me $18. Croque Monsieur is essentially a ham and cheese sandwich folks and it really had nothing special about the preparation.  The soup was ok but again nothing special.  Salads cost between $10-13. Essentially, budget $20 for an average lunch. Desserts are $8.50 per selection. And soda? $2.50 per can. No refills.  So if you can live on atmosphere alone, at Suzette&#39;s you&#39;ll be satisfied. If you want either value or imagination, you may want to try another restaurant."

The server never came back to our table to see if we wanted anything else and we actually had to call for her because it almost looked like she was trying not to make eye contact with us. My daughter had to leave the table to asked for the check and when I looked it they had over charged us by $35.

Afternoon tea is not common in the Chicago area (aside from downtown hotels) so this was not an easy feat.  I was also a bit concerned about booking an English tea as it is a French establishment .  A French tea offering quiche and crepes is also available but its not the foods I associate with afternoon tea so I decided to risk it.   Understandably, you need to book the English tea ahead of time as it is not part of their regular menu and tea sandwiches need to be made fresh. 

Our tea was booked for 1 pm on  Sunday and their brunch crowd had wound down so it was not too busy.  They had a lovely round table set for the five of us by a fountain.  But it was a gorgeous day and we had spied the lovely patio so we asked if it would be possible to have our tea outside.  They graciously accommodated our request and quickly reset the beautiful tea setting outside.   During the brief wait we decided the to explore the shop the front of the store.  The cases are chock full of goodies - ranging from savory items such as quiches and a large variety of sandwiches to an incredible display of delectable pastries, bars, pies and other sweets.  

We were soon settled comfortably at our table and handed tea menus - there were at least 10 types to choose from - herbal teas, green teas, black teas.  Most of us ordered our own pots so we could sample a variety - we all loved the selections we chose.  Perhaps it all tasted even better because of the lovely china settings.    The first course was an array of 5 types of sandwiches - we had cucumber and radish, sliced egg, chicken salad, shrimp, and pesto with sundried tomato on pretzel baguette.  The server arrived with all of the sandwiches on a tray and served us each individually in case anyone didn&#39;t want a particular type -  we had them all!  And then we were offered ANOTHER round of the sandwiches which of course we didn&#39;t turn down!   We were asked if we had a favourite  - but they were all excellent and I enjoyed the variety of flavours.  

The second course consisted of two small cranberry scones topped with granulated sugar and served warm with Devonshire (clotted) cream and lemon curd - again, top notch!  

For the third course you could select  ANY  dessert  - from a HUGE list.  Offerings included their crepes,  prepared desserts such as crème brulee (which I had and loved -  texture was perfect) or anything from the huge pastry case.  The portion sizes were large and we struggled to finish this course but they were happy to pack up what we couldn&#39;t finish.  

Service was very friendly and attentive throughout.  The owner, Donna, also popped in often to assist and ensure all was well.  We were having such a good time that the restaurant had already closed down.  Again, the owner very graciously allowed us to linger as long as we wanted as we could exit from the back to the street.   Can&#39;t wait to have this experience again - highly recommend!"

The owner saw him and gave a big sigh, like &#34;oh how cute.&#34; She then looked at him with grandmother eyes and said &#34;would you like a cookie?&#34;  Of course my young son nodded &#34;yes&#34; and she asked him which cookie he would like. He pointed to a white frosted cookie which she skillfully pulled out of the case and gave to my son. We were about to leave when she went to the register and said that will be $2.42. We could not believe this, I thought she was joking....she was not."

The interior is gorgeous and felt so European, in the first front part there is a bakery and the second front part there is the large dining room which was gorgeous. It looked as though they also had a private room for other dining events. We requested to sit outside on their quaint back patio which reminded me of the apartments in France and even Spain. They even had a little garden in the back. On their breakfast menu, alcohol is not listed, but I believe you need to request it if you want a nice mimosa. I ordered the French scrambled eggs with tomato concasse which came with two pieces of French bread and fruit. Their side of fruit was the typical cantaloupe and honeydew hard melon you usually get from restaurants, but had an abundance of berries and even kiwi on top of their melon! My eggs were absolutely perfect! I am always hesitant of scrambled eggs because they usually turn out too dry but these were wet and moist and cooked to perfection. My boyfriend ordered the ham and cheddar crepe and my friend ordered the spinach crepe and they were both in love with their crepes. Our server was attentive, friendly, and engaging. I even loved the little china teacups that they serve the coffee in. I cannot wait to return for other menu options!"

We arrived around 10am to a nearly empty restaurant and were immediately asked if we had a reservation.  I explained we had just called about 30 minutes prior.  

After waiting in the entryway for 3 or 4 minutes the hostess/waitress led us to a table.  She told us our table was booked for 12:30...more than 2 hours later!  I wasn&#39;t planning on spending more than 2 hours at breakfast but her message was clear- eat and get out.  Perhaps she should have sat us at ANY of the other EMPTY tables in the restaurant.  

Oddly, after encouraging us to leave quickly, the service was remarkably slow.  At this point we were one of two occupied tables in the restaurant.  The people working at Suzette&#39;s (at least 5) outnumbered the total people dining (4).    

We ordered two crepes and a side of bacon.  The food was passable but not worth the price.  We were served our crepes and told the side of bacon was coming.  More than 15 minutes later and after we had nearly finished our crepes the bacon came out...four skinny pieces for which we were charged $6.50.  

After finishing our meal we waited another 15 minutes for the check.  Then another 10 min for her to pick up the credit card...she never came back for the credit card so we opted to pay in cash and leave.

I&#39;ve been to Suzette&#39;s at least once a year since it opened more than a decade ago and have bought countless pastries, pies and salad dressings from them at the Farmer&#39;s Market.  Though the food is decent the service has always been below average.  For the price we are asked to pay, we deserve better treatment."

I&#39;m ONLY giving this place 3 stars because when I eat i place most of the emphasis on food taste and quality. The service here was terrible. Absolutely horrible. Yes there is a possibility that we got a fresh waitress but the level of service is unacceptable for the price we paid ($40) per person. It literally took her 10 minutes to get us a dessert menu. I get faster service at the olive garden and at half the price. 

Now on the other end of the spectrum, this food here is spectacular, I got the duck confit with mushroom risotto which came out wonderfully tender and delicious. My mothers pork tenderloin with apples also tasted great. Even the iced tea was fragrant and had notes of orange zest. 

Come here for the food, not the service. Expect a 2 hour dinner if you plan on eating here. I hope you get a more experienced and expedient waitress should you choose to eat here. If they improved the service, this place would rock."

There are two glass counters up front; one is French-style pastries (with a large basket of French breads-  usually classic; Viennois; and a multi-grain baguette) atop it; and one with more savories, usually topped with a couple of cold croissants.  I don&#39;t seem to get here early enough for warm croissants, which is a shame; the croissants here aren&#39;t very good cold (they&#39;re a little greasy).  The blueberry cream cheese croissant is interesting, but not really my cup of tea.  As I recall, the farmer&#39;s market croissants are fresh.  The space is kind of awkward, as there are tables jammed into the same area people are waiting in, but you&#39;re here for French pastries, so deal with it.

The bread is excellent and so are the pastries; I say this as someone who&#39;s lived in France.  The pastry chef isn&#39;t usually there on the weekends, so if you need to know if there&#39;s gelatin in something, come on a weekday.  The pastry chef is quite knowledgable about what&#39;s in everything and helpful.  As I recall, the chocolate mousse cake and the peanut butter mousse cake are gelatin-free.  Any other mousse desserts are probably not unless the chef tells you otherwise.  In addition to the mousse cakes there is usually a variety of cookies (recently including macarons) and tarts.  The tarts are made with the classic sugar cookie crust and are lovely; I usually eat half and give the other half to my spouse.  If I hit this bakery, I usually come home with a couple of goodies that get inhaled fairly quickly.  We got a buche de Noel last year and likely will again; it was lovely and oh so rich.  Take to a party so you don&#39;t eat it all.

In the savory counter, I&#39;ve been quite taken with a potato-based Limousin tart; they usually have 2-3 varieties of savory tart, with at least one veg option, and 2-3 types of sandwich, again with at least one veg option.  Haven&#39;t seen the Limousin tart elsewhere and it makes a good lunch."

We went in for the desire to have crepes after our dinner at Montri Thai in Wheaton.  Yelp said they&#39;d be open till 10pm, and we were only 5 miles away.  We arrived around 9:15pm and wanted dessert but heard the kitchen might already be closed.  The time says they close at 9:30pm so someone should modify the time for those traveling for desserts they absolutely have to have.  Service is everything and he was very hospitable and accommodating.  From beginning to end, smiling, genuine smiles, making sure we were comfortable to choose where ever we wanted to sit.  And he made sure we did not need anything else.  Perfect.  This why this place is getting a 4 star rating.  The one off is for the time difference based on Yelp and on the store.  Now had our waiter not been there, or had the kitchen said they already closed for the night, it would have been a two star.  The decor was nice, but without Ben there would have been a lack of character because the other lady should smile.  This is not an art gallery where we have to be so introverted.  Smile just a little bit and you will get more stars~  Thanks Ben we had an enjoyable experience.  Service is everything and you delivered.  As for our desserts we had Banana&#39;s Foster Crepe and a Cappuccino Creme Brulee.  I liked the other one more, even though I am a coffee flavor type of person.  Afterwards we drove home 45 miles away satisfied.  I cannot emphasize enough, do not close the kitchen before the time the restaurant shuts down, people travel so far to eat sometimes and it would be nice to have non misleading advertisement with the time.  Thanks!"

We arrived about 1:30 for lunch and the staff appeared put off that we didn&#39;t have reservations, even though we could see several open tables. 

The service was incredibly slow and our server spoke so quietly that it was barely audible. I assume that the food is made fresh and takes a bit longer to prepare, but a Coke from a Coke can shouldn&#39;t take long to serve.  

But, the biggest disappointment of the meal was that I ordered a bowl of soup and asked for a baguette or roll to go with it. When the server returned with the soup, I was told that there is no bread on Mondays...that the bread is delivered on Monday nights. So, I asked if they would provide a little bag of oyster crackers. No oyster crackers. So I ate my soup sans bread and couldn&#39;t help but wonder how a French restaurant has no bread anywhere in the restaurant to go with a bowl of soup. 

I really expected more...I attended a shower here a couple of years ago and it was lovely!"

THe decor in Suzette&#39;s sorta makes me feel like I&#39;m in my grandma&#39;s house. It&#39;s dimly lit and has small tables-  also, not much room for large parties.

suzettes-creperie-wheaton,Shannon M.,H32QTRV87Q6CGTVUm1Z4QA,"Naperville, IL",1,1,0,119,1210,rJoaodjmhzZizX_moS4sJw,4.0,2008-11-26,"I&#39;ve been on a crepe kick for the last 6 months or so, and Suzette&#39;s was the closest place to home I could find that served them, so my mother and I decided to do a &#34;ladies who lunch&#34; thing today and check it out. 

It looks like a little grandmotherly tearoom (lacy curtains, flowered carpet), though with a sleek bar and a sideboard adorned with a liquer tray to shake up that vibe a bit; the clientele ranged from a solo dude doing a crossword puzzle to giggling high school girls having a birthday out to middle-aged ladies to...well, us. Clearly all people of discerning palates, because the food was excellent. 

I got the Spicy Coconut Shrimp Crepe, not only because it sounded delicious but also because it was something that not every crepe place has. The crepe itself was delicate but didn&#39;t get waterlogged by the creamy sauce, which was a beautiful pale loquat orange color, full of finely diced peppers (red, yellow and poblano), plus garlic and mid-sized shrimp. It was topped with shredded coconut and a wedge of lime. I demolished it; if it had been a crime scene, there would have been no evidence. 

My mom got a quiche Lorraine, one of the other non-crepe options on the menu (there were also soups and appetizers among the lunch offerings). Both the crepe and quiche came with a small mixed green salad dressed with a pleasant vinaigrette. 

The dessert menu was somewhat depleted; they were out of two of the crepes and were down to mostly ones with bananas, and to me, bananas=blecchhh, so we asked if they could make the Banana Nutella Crepe with just Nutella, which they did, and it was teriffic (hard for anything with Nutella to be bad!). 
(Ironically, no crepes Suzette on the menu!)
I also had a Gale Gand&#39;s Root Beer; I&#39;d recommend it: a nice amalgam of creamy and spicy, with the prominent play of ginger, cinnamon and vanilla evident. 

Our waitress was a cheerful young woman, engaging and accomodating, who made good suggestions.

The space is not very large, so how boisterous your fellow diners are might make or break your meal. (We had the giggling schoolgirls at the next table, which grated a bit as our lunch wore on, though it was funny to laugh at how they knew nothing of which they spoke, like politics. Ah youth!) 

The size of the restaurant also lends itself to allowing the bewitching fragrances from the kitchen to permeate the whole place; both my mom and I commented on how *good* the place smelled! I had a cold and could still smell that dense kitchen-y aroma of well-prepared food.

The non-dining-room side of Suzette&#39;s is the patisserie, which has a couple of small tables and a counter for dining in, and a display case full of pastries for take-away. We didn&#39;t indulge this time, but there will certainly be a future trip, so I&#39;ll have to report back then. 

Overall, delicious food in a charming setting with nice service. I&#39;ll certainly be back."

We had to ask for the table by the fireplace. It had wingback chairs and we were alone in the room so I wondered why it wasn&#39;t offered to us? The bar was 4 feet away and the guy behind it was not very pleasent. My friend had been here quite a few times and she said that he never acknowledges anyone when he&#39;s back there, even though he has to take your drink order? It was nice that they gave me a small carafe of iced tea. I ordered the onion soup which was very tasty and a light cream color the way it is suppose to be. The quiche was another story. It was not cooked enough so the texture was on the soggy side. The leaf spinich salad that came with it had a good vinegrette going. If I was in the area I might consider giving this place another shot."

If you&#39;re willing to linger, then enjoy the savoury crepes.. They are to die for.

I am basing my review on my turkey burger. It was big, yes, it had lettuce, tomatoes, Swiss cheese and I upgraded to the pretzel bun, grilled onions and mushrooms. 
My burger fell apart because it was so messy. The bottom of my bun turned in to mush. The grilled onions baffled me, it was tiny pieces of minced onions, I was expecting regular cut onions. The turkey party was flavorful but I can&#39;t pin point the flavor. I just did not like it at all. I ate the tomatoes, mushrooms and onions and picked at the patty. 
I was so disappointed! 
My son got the regular burger and he seemed pleased with his choice. He also had a milkshake that looked good. The fries were good and so were the fried pickles. I really enjoyed the fried pickles served with a side of ranch. 
My total was about $35. The burgers don&#39;t come with a side or drink so you have to add everything separately. They also charge extra for buns and for different toppings. 
I won&#39;t be back. I enjoy Culver&#39;s burgers better.

While I can appreciate all types of cuisine, I absolutely drool at the thought of a great burger and fries. And trust me, I have had my fair share and I have the hips to prove it. This is part of the reason I have elected to fast from having any bread during the week day until Easter. And while I occasionally eat bunless burgers, I wanted the full Monty! Back Alley did not disappoint. 

BAB offers lots of bread options, including gluten free buns, meat ounce options, meat preparation options, a variety of toppings and side items. We ordered the Ulti-Melt, a 1/2 lb medium rare burger topped with pastrami on a GF bun, slaw and regular fries. Everything was delicious. 

Definitely a great option and worth a 15-20 minute ride because it does not involve long lines. 

Other Aspects Worth noting: 
- All 1/3 lb are prepared medium well

- fry portions are perfect for sharing 

-both types are shoestring fries which I love! 

- Pepsi Products (I am a CocaCola products lady for LIFE! Lol)

- free refills on soda 

- wine by the glass and beer available. 

- it is located near the corner of IL83 and St. Charles. 

- many quality add on toppings are only $1. 

- regular mustard and ketchup are the condiment options outside of the menu items (no spicy mustard, Grey Poupon, etc).

- chicken, turkey and crab burgers offered too.  And hot dogs! (I did not enjoy the crab burger)"

This was one of my stops! My friend and I came here for a late lunch. I have to say, I was impressed with their menu! So many burgers to choose from, including the fact that you can make your own! They also have turkey and veggie burgers if beef isn&#39;t your thing. I ended up going with the Bottomless Pit. They also have a variety of sides to choose from (including cheese fries!), drinks (even beer and wine), and shakes. I behaved and didn&#39;t get a shake...but I&#39;m regretting that now. They looked amazing! They also have a few salads/sandwiches if you don&#39;t want a burger...but that&#39;s just crazy.

The bottomless bit burger was pretty much amazing. It was basically a pulled pork sandwich on a cheeseburger. This must be a popular choice because I saw a lot of people getting it. You can&#39;t really taste the burger since there is so much going on. But it still tasted very good. 

You order at the counter, and then they bring your food out to you. When they brought our food out, the server refilled my drink as well. Beyond that there really isn&#39;t table service. You can also carry-out your food, or they have a pick-up window. One of the servers seemed a little out of sorts and couldn&#39;t figure out what table was supposed to get what food. Also, the menu is a little overwhelming your first time. Beyond that it was pretty much perfect!"

I recommend looking online ahead of time. I needed to study for a while before I could even narrow it down to two choices! 

They offer some beer and wine choices (relatively decent craft options and reasonable prices)

The interior is all street themed to the max which was so cool! I loved the design. 

Fries/sides are not included. Be prepared to pay extra!

I ordered the Coke n Fries burger, reading that it was 1/3 lb of beef topped with cheese, fries and a coke sauce sounded so different and tempting! Apparently this must get ordered by people as an actual meal because the cashier asked &#34;you do know this burger is topped w fries and a coke sauce?&#34;  Yes. I read! I was ready. 

The burger was a site for sore eyes once it arrived. It was tall and beautiful. The coke sauce does taste like coke! Sweet, but thinner than a bbq sauce or ketchup- it seeped thru my bottom bun, causing it to disintegrate and become a bit of a mess- but hey, I just flipped my burger over and kept right on going! The fries were tasty and get a little soft at the end but all the Flavor combos were solid. I enjoyed it a lot, minus the mess. It did lead to a case of heartburn soon after but I&#39;m going to say it was worth the pain!

Since I cannot eat the bun got a bunless burger.   The order came to the table, I was please with the size and the cook of the burger. I did find out that they don&#39;t put the toppings on the burger if you get a bunless burger which was a bit disappointing since I would have like it the way they make it but I was able to put as much of the sauces as I liked. At first I didn&#39;t think it was very spicy but my last bite was quite hot. I enjoyed it very much.  The Thai Chili cream was very yummy as well as the Habenaro jam.  I did figure out that the insanely hot burger has to be eaten with a bun or you will probably die.    I do plan on trying it sometime though. But need to go prepared.

We ordered over $100 of food and then sat down. Then we realized they had a loyalty program and asked if we could join it and apply our previous purchase points and they said no... Which was unfortunate ... We thought they could have counter offered with like a coupon or something since we spent so much but nope.

Anyway, I started with a Nutella milkshake. Nope did not like it at all. Didn&#39;t really taste rich in Nutella at all. Tried my colleague&#39;s Oreo shake and liked it even less than mine. Tried a strawberry one and it was okay. 

I don&#39;t know the names of the fries but one of them had waaaay too much spicy seasoning on it- it was overkill. Another one I really have no idea what it was but we called it fries with gravy. They were okay. The cheese fries and sweet potato fries were just okay.

Finally, for my main meal- I got the crab cake burger. I took a bite and instantly hated the bun. There was waaaay too much bread in the bun. I took the top half of the bun off as I ate the rest of the burger. It was okay... Towards my last few bites, I was getting really sick of the bread so I took the bottom half off too. Then the crab cake tasted better but still not delicious or anything. But it made me realize crab cake should be eaten by itself, not in a burger.

My team overall did not like the food. Everyone was pretty much in consensus that we would not return here. Also, the place was very old school and the outside looked kind of run down and had a sign that said &#34;YES WE ARE OPEN&#34; as if they look so grungy outside that they look closed all the time or something."

I guess if my tastebuds hadnt been sullied by the likes of Kumas, Lockdown, and some fantastic burger place in Wauconda, and recent pulled pork sandwich in Oak Park, my review might be better. First the roll for my pulled pork sandwich. My bill was 35 for 2 sandwiches, soft drinks, 1 fry order and a shake. The roll was an ordinary whole wheat bun. I&#39;m used to brioche or challah  being used. I use better rolls at home! The pork was moist and tangy the coleslaw was warm which was odd. The place seemed dirty and dated to me. The burger selections were BORING, again looking at the competition I want to be wowed! I thought the price for quality of food and atmosphere was out of line.

I&#39;d recommend ordering them.  The burger, fries, and a drink ran $12.  Kind of expensive, but since they don&#39;t have waitress service you save on the tip. 

We ended up sitting outside.  The patio needs a little work.  The chairs were comfortable, but there was only one umbrella.  There&#39;s a dead tree hanging over the patio that&#39;s going to have to be taken down before branches start falling off.  Overall, this is a good place to get a burger.

It wasn&#39;t terrible by any means just not particularly good either. The meat in my burger had very little flavor which is odd considering this place uses grass fed beef. I don&#39;t think it was seasoned at all, it was so bland! Also the fries had a pretty strong vinegar taste to them? I&#39;m not sure if they soak the fresh cut fries in water with vinegar as part of their process but that&#39;s definitely what they tasted like. The fries would have been awesome if not for the heavy vinegar taste, very fresh and cooked perfectly!"

The food is amazing! I really enjoy how accommodating they are for you. Their employees give great customer service and always check up on you and offer refills if you&#39;re running low on your beverage. The Nutella Shakes are absolutely divine and cheer you up on the gloomiest of days. What&#39;s not to love? The fries are fresh cut and extra delicious piping hot! Why go to a regular burger joint wen you can go to Back Alley where you have a HUGE variety to choose from? I&#39;ve also tried their Mac &amp; Cheese bites and those are pretty swell as well ;)"

We got in fast and immediately found a table, but the place filled up quickly. As far as the food goes, our friends got customized burgers. I got the right-stuffed burger and my bf got the Brooklyn. We both agreed the right-stuffed was the better of the two, but the Brooklyn was just alright. Our main complaint about it was that it was a little heavy on the sauerkraut and the pumpernickle tasted off. We also ordered cheese fries and split a chili cheese dog. It&#39;s hard to go wrong with cheese fries so we had no complaints there. The chili cheese dog was good too. After the meal, we both had upset stomachs. We could have ate too much but perhaps it was the food. Despite our complaints, our guests loved their meals! I shall continue my burger search!"

A friend invited me for burgers at Fat Cat&#39;s but I said &#34;I&#39;m so hungry I could eat my arm off. You don&#39;t want me to one armed, do you?&#34; I was near Back Alley so I decided they would save my arm. 

I started to build my own burger as I really wanted a pretzel bun. My sandwich was almost a classic so the cashier switched it so I could save a buck. (I checked in as well so between both of our efforts two bucks were saved!!) I finished my order, delighted with all the savings, and headed to a table. 

After about five minutes, my burger, fries, and milkshake were delivered to me. The highlights:
1. Milkshake has a super sized straw! I love strawberry shakes and too often the strawberries block my sucking. This straw prevents any sucking issues. 
2. The fresh cut fries were delicious! No excess seasoning. Just real, natural potato taste. 
3. The burger was nice and juicy! Sometimes a well cooked patty of meat can be tough or dry. Maybe it was the grass fed beef or maybe they just know how to cook. Either way, it was delicious!

I will definitely be going back. It is far better than that smash place across the intersection. :) Added bonus? They offer a meatball sandwich! Score!!"

I had their Back Alley Burger both times (1st time as served, 2nd time on a pretzel bun) but the 1st left me wanting more--it was that delicious! Fire fries with cheese are good but a tad bit on the salty side. Macaroni Bites are a rip off because they are tiny and the price comes out to $1.00 a piece (5pcs) which I find ridiculous for an item that goes from freezer to fryer. Fried pickles taste decent and are a deal at $3.99, and their ranch sauce seems homemade (1st time it was amazing, 2nd time too salty). Definitely recommend getting a milkshake! We&#39;ve tried vanilla, strawberry, Oreo, and banana--all are delicious. Their customer service is excellent. Everyone has been very polite and friendly.   Each meal consisted of 2 different types of burgers, 1 type of fry with cheese, 2 milkshakes, and 1 appetizer cost us $35 and $32. I&#39;d go back but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way."

The burgers were disgusting!!  There was a thick, slime-like coating on the burger patties.  The toppings were not very good.  I am gagging just thinking about how the burger patties looked.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.  I pulled my burger out and gave it a good wipe down with napkins before I even attempted eating.  The only reason I ate any of it was b/c I was STARVING from a long bike ride.  I managed to choke down about three bites before the greasiness became too much to handle.  1 star for the burgers.  And that&#39;s generous.  I was nauseous the rest of the evening.  Major regret.

The  second star is for the milkshake and fries.  Those were good.  Fried pickles should have negative stars - worst fried pickles of my life.

The first time was very meh.  It was like my burger was attacked by a hoard of shredded lettuce.  I took about 90% of it off.  I remember the fries were pretty good.  I don&#39;t think my co-worker liked her dish that much, but it was edible and not disgusting.  The second time we went (same co-worker), they charged her a flat $50.00 on her card.  She only got a burger, fries and a drink so no idea where the $50 charge came from.  She asked the person at the register why it was $50 and not the amount of her meal (probably about $12) and she was told that&#39;s just how much the bank HOLDS on your account and that it was normal.  Which was completely bogus because I also paid with a debit card, and my charge was for my actual food.  So then she asked to speak to a manager who actually refunded her the $50 and charged her for the food she actually bought... but gave no explanation.

Well. My friend Julia had never had a malt and I converted her over to the dark side of dessert-drinks. The burger: well, let&#39;s just say when I had eaten my fill, my friend Andrew looked at me and asked, &#34;Margaux, why are you so sad?&#34; and I said &#34;Because I want to eat more but I just can&#39;t!&#34; It was not a joke.

Overall, this is a decent family owned burger joint.  Food comes out fast, ingredients are fresh.  A little pricey for the low cost buns and lettuce used with the burgers.

Next visit...I have to try a milkshake!  Noticed they also offer a special seasonal shake each month."

There needs to be SOME kind of entertainment value to compensate for the food, which was totally lacking in vitality.

That&#39;s right, I said it. I was misled by all the positive reviews. Aside from that time my parents told me they were just wrestling when I walked into their room after a bad dream, I don&#39;t like being lied to. I realize the &#34;gourmet burger&#34; trend can either leave you completely satisfied, or wishing you would have saved a few bucks and hit up the Wendy&#39;s drive-thru instead. I&#39;m teetering towards the latter.

You can actually customize your burger at this place to make it good. But be prepared to watch the price go up faster than Adele volunteering for a pie eating contest. All the good ingredients cost extra. For example, a pretzel roll bun, Everybody knows that at a good burger place, that would come standard. So you can either come to Back Alley, pay extra to make your burger decent, extra for really bland fries (or extra extra for something stupid like sweet potato fries), or go somewhere much better in Elmhurst, like Pints, where the good stuff comes standard and tastes better. 

Back Alley is like a talented sports team with a terrible coach. I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s being run by the Lovie Smith of burger joints. There&#39;s potential, but get somebody in here that will go hard when it comes to the theme (I&#39;m serious about that true back alley decor) and knows what a good burger should be."

Finally one night after a haircut, I decided it was high time to check it out.

I should admit right away that I had a chicken sandwich. I know, I know, but I had burger plans for the same weekend, and didn&#39;t want to OD on red meat. So I ordered a chicken sandwich with Merkt&#39;s,grilled onions, pickles and spicy mustard and a side of fries. The chicken was tender, juicy and delicious although it slid around some on the bun and was a little hard to eat (the downside of chicken breast can be that you end up yanking half of it off the bun instead of biting through). 

The fries were freakin&#39; fantastic. Fresh hand-cut, piping hot and just skinny enough. I devoured them. 

Overall, the menu of Back Alley reminds me very much of the upscale burger trend found at Smashburger, Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s, Five Guys, DMK, Fuddrucker&#39;s, etc. Of course, I&#39;d rather go to a local place than a chain most days, and the menu  has a lot of intriguing options. So if I&#39;m driving past the proper direction and a burger jones hits me... I&#39;d definitely stop in again."

For $3.25 for about 8 rings I expect fresh.  We didn&#39;t even finish them.  The burger was a little too well done for my taste, and the &#34;height&#34; was ridiculous.  I&#39;m not sure how I was supposed to eat it.  I know that&#39;s a super cool trend these days, but I think it&#39;s stupid.  We both had to ask for silverware.

It was about $30 for both of us to eat. It is not worth that price, there are many other places that have better food for about $15 a person.

I ordered the shroom burger and my boyfriend made his own bacon cheeseburger. Our buns were cold, as if they were in a refrigerator.  We prefer to have them at least warm or placed on the grill shortly. EXTREMELY greasy. Bottom bun was soaked, and a puddle of greese was left on the plate. I love spicy, but there was way too much horseradish on the burger. It had me tearing up. My boyfriend kept asking me what was wrong haha. Also I wish my burger came with lettuce, tomato and pickle (there was already onion). Eating greesy meat on bread was unsatisfying, it needed some fresh veggies and that fresh crunch.

We also ordered the onion rings and gravy fries. Onion rings were really good! The gravy fries were really salty and peppery and the gravy was oddly chunky. Not a fan.

Service was good. Staff was very nice. And place was cleaner than expected.

Also while we were there, we were noticing the people coming in there, it was about 9 people throughout our time there. Every person was very large. I know it might sound rude but not 1 normal weight person came in. Kind of shows you what kind of food you&#39;re getting and it is right."

I ordered the burger of the day the Teriyaki Burger is was delish so interesting with satisfying flavors atop a juicy made to order burger!!

Resolved to look it up, and it looked like a place we had to try. 

After some event or other at MCC, we stopped here on the bikes. I don&#39;t like to drink when I ride (I love craft beers, but I&#39;m a total lightweight, so no thanks), so I didn&#39;t try any beer that day. But the burgers! Grass-fed beef patties, loads of interesting menu options including a build-your-own? Yes, please! And the shakes! OMG THE SHAKES. Know what I miss about a good strawberry milkshake? STRAWBERRIES. None of that silly &#34;strawberry flavored&#34; syrup here. Actual berries. Actual good, thick, delicious ice cream. I call that winning in terms of shakes. My SO had the Oreo shake. How was it? I can&#39;t tell you, because it was so good he wouldn&#39;t let me try it. 

I don&#39;t remember what it was called, but my SO&#39;s brother had the burger with the barbecue pulled pork on it. OH DEAR GOD. That pork was cooked perfectly, and the barbecue sauce was exquisite. My burger had grilled oniony goodness, a fried egg cooked perfectly (I like my yolks runny, so it coats and seeps into whatever it&#39;s sitting on, kthx), and generally made me squee with delight. Fries were also quality; so much so that we all tried to stuff them all in because it would have been a shame to throw them away. 

I really want to try the Maui Wowie burger next time I&#39;m there. It&#39;s a good thing this place isn&#39;t closer, or we&#39;d eat a lot more of it. That would be a bad thing. I mean, a delicious thing, but a bad thing, lol."

It was fantastic! My boyfriend had the Brooklyn Burger and I ordered the The Right Stuff burger. We also ordered a side of hand cut fries and a side of sweet potato fries. My burger was AMAZING. My first bite of the burger was a surprise with the gooey goodness of the center. Usually stuffed burgers fail at having a gooey melty cheesy center, but not this one! I would highly recommend this burger if stuck on what to choose. My boyfriends burger, the Brooklyn Burger, unfortunately seemed to be a let down for him. He devoured it but I could see the jealousy in his eyes as I enjoyed my burger. He said he probably wouldn&#39;t order that one again but really enjoyed mine so he would want to go back. Our fries were delicious as well, but the amount we had could have fed a large party! 

I was stuffed at the end but how could I pass up the chance for a hand spun milkshake. I just ordered a chocolate one and it was delicious. I loved the extra wide straw that was stuck in the top when it was brought to me. It&#39;s the simple things in life :)

I only wish you could order the 1/3lb burgers cooked the way you want - If you need your burger medium-rare, you&#39;re stuck ordering the 1/2lb... not that being forced to eat more of a great burger is a bad thing.

They have a lot of great burgers to pick from, and this is one of the few places where I routinely mix it up with my order, because every time I try something new it&#39;s just as good as or better than the last thing.  

You can&#39;t go wrong building your own either - lots of great toppings to pick from.  And I&#39;ll say this - why more places don&#39;t offer fried jalapenos as a topping is beyond me.  Freaking delicious.  I know, I know - the regular jalapenos are a free topping.  Trust me, pay the extra buck and get your burger with the fried jalapenos.  You won&#39;t be disappointed.  

Sides are also great here -- cheese fries, onion rings, fried pickles... good stuff.  There are many more and I&#39;m ashamed I haven&#39;t mixed up my side option more often.  Quick service (not fast food quick, but that&#39;s a good thing) and friendly staff.

The only thing keeping me from a 5-star review is that I prefer my burgers medium, and even though they ask you how you want them cooked, they always show up well done.  They&#39;re still delicious and juicy, so unlike some places where this happens you&#39;re not going to get a dry disc of flavorless beef - you&#39;ll still devour it.

You can choose one of their 22 burgers on the menu or just build your own.  If you don&#39;t like the beef, you can choose a turkey burger or a veggie burger.  I opted to build my own burger just because the menu choices made me kind of dizzy.  (Hunger makes me dizzy too).  I started with the beef patty, pretzel bun (heck yeah!), American Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Pickles (extra pickles!), Bacon (why not?), ketchup and mustard.  I also ordered the sweet potato fries. Everything is a la carte and made to order, so it&#39;s definitely pricier than the Golden Arches, but like I said, everything is MADE to ORDER.  and it&#39;s worth the (short) wait!

Juicy and flavorful patty, fresh toppings, thick crinkle cut dill pickles and a super good pretzel bun.  Let me wipe the drool off my keyboard before I continue.  The sweet potato fries were also really well made and not done up in spices (like some other places). Just served piping hot with a bit of sea salt--Yum, Yum!   

Drink options here are stellar too.  From soda (they also have Boylens!) to Beer (basics like Bud to some craft options like 3 Floyds and O&#39;Fallon) to Wine to Hand Dipped Milkshakes!

There are parking spots around, but unless you&#39;re going at super quiet hours, you may end up parking somewhere else in town and walking to the restaurant. There is outdoor seating, and ample indoor seating as well. Staff is friendly and attentive. You can do take-out. 

Sushi House also offers cooked menu options for those out there who prefer to avoid consuming sushi/raw fish. 

As a local, I&#39;ve been here a few times - but most recently, went with a friend of mine who has actually spent several years in Japan in the past and, for obvious reasons, has a much more educated palate than I. 

We had assorted sushi (8 pieces, + miso + spicy tuna roll). The nigiri options were pretty generic - nothing too creative, but the fish was quality and enjoyable. The spicy tuna maki was very classic, and very good. The negihamachi roll was in a similar vein - simple, classic, and well done. Just to have some fun we also had the 2012 roll. Unlike what you can often find, the fish was the star (and the quality was good) and flavors were balanced. It wasn&#39;t rice/wrapping, a ton of vegetables, and a thin strip of fish. 

All in all, I enjoyed it. Staff is friendly, the classic sushi options are refined and done with quality ingredients and the signature rolls are creative and well balanced."

An acrostic poem by yours truly.

Sexy Mexican roll is a must - cilantro, tempura fried shrimp, kanikama &amp; quacamole sauce or bust.
Unassumingly charming is there private curtain-closure booth table. Be sure to sit here if you&#39;re able!
Shrimp shumai is a tasty appetizer treat, which comes with six steamed shrimp dumplings for you to eat.
Have you tried their green iced tea? It&#39;s yummy, refreshingly, and delicious if you ask me!
In my opinion, a Japanese meal would not be complete without miso soup. Good thing it&#39;s complimentary - no need for a coup!

High five to the chef for this delectable meal, plus they have awesome lunch specials, this place is a steal.
Our waitress was sweet and helpful with the menu, our lunch dining experience was a win because of this venue.
Unless sushi just isn&#39;t for you, you should bookmark them on Yelp and snag a table for two.
Salt and pepper soft shell crab was definitely a fave - crispy, fried, and tossed with Szechwan chili pepper, japapeno, onion, and cilantro your taste buds are sure to crave. 
Everyone should give Sushi House a try, their food is quite tasty - I cannot lie!"

When I walked in, I was greeted by a wonderful hostess/waitress, who immediately showed me to a table by the window and greeted me with a big smile.  After taking my drink order and letting me look over the menu, she came back and asked if I had any questions or if I was ready to order. (Most of the restaurants in Chicago that are Japanese have a usually more rushed feel, however here the waitress didn&#39;t seem to be rushing and or pushy towards me, which was a nice change.)  I ordered the lettuce chicken wraps, as I thought it would be a nice, light, and healthy lunch.  

Lunch was quickly prepared and delivered in a timely manner.  The food was wonderful and fresh.  Great flavors and great quality and quantity.

Ordered an Alaskan Roll and it came with boiled salmon, which had an extremely unpleasant texture - I was under the impression that the Alaskan roll was raw, but that was my mistake, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. Spicy tuna roll was fresh but not spicy or flavorful. Great strong iced green tea, mediocre lukewarm miso soup. The waiter other reviewers have mentioned as being rude was nowhere in sight - I had an extremely polite and efficient waiter when I visited at lunch time.

I was impressed by the menu and some of the combination specials. 

I ordered one of the sushi combos and a few minutes after completing my purchase got a call from the restaurant. I was told I &#34;paid too little&#34; for the order and the combination is only valid during the week for lunch. I saw lunch specials but my order wasn&#39;t indicated as such. They then asked if I wanted to cancel my order or pay individually for the items but I had already paid online, so they told me I could pick up the order right away and hung up. 

When I arrived at the restaurant and gave my name for the order (which was sitting right on the counter) they acted like they didn&#39;t know what I was talking about. After a few minutes they read the receipt and let me take the order, which I discovered when I got home was missing soup. 

The sushi itself was mediocre, which is a shame because even a rude experience like this one might have been redeemed if it didn&#39;t taste like whole foods rolls."

I have tried so many sushi places, from Nori in Lincoln Park, to Butterfly in Wicker Park, Ra Sushi in Lombard, Yokohama in Westmont... So many places! 

Sushi House in Downers Grove is the best yet. They make their sushi with big, fat, fresh pieces of fish. The waiter said that the fish that you are eating was happy and alive less than 24 hours ago. The fish is flown in on ice, picked up at the airport, and distributed to all the local Sushi Houses. The veggies are fresh that they roll them up with too, and the rice is sticky and not dry. This is one of the very few places that you will find that don&#39;t pad their rolls with rice. 

I got Tomago as well, and it was excellent. The Tomago followed the theme of big and thick sushi. It takes a master sushi chef to make really good, smooth, and slightly sweet Tomago. 

For the quality of the sushi, it was very reasonably priced. Tomago was $2.25, a Philly roll was $7.95, and special rolls between &amp;13-$16. They have all the fish up front, so you can see what you&#39;re about to feast on.

If you are worried about spending too much here, I suggest getting carry out. They will take good care of you."

My mom was on her lunch break so we had a time crunch and the server (possibly manager?owner?) was very accommodating and got us our food in a timely manner.

My mom and I started with a seaweed salad which did not disappoint. I think I just love all of that sodium;) We ordered an assortment of rolls some specialty and some typical. Some of them were on the lunch menu options for a &#34;combo&#34; The California, veggie, spicy tuna, and rainbow rolls were all fresh and delicious. For the specialty roll we had the Baja which was also very good. It had large pieces of crab and the cilantro adds a great taste to the roll.

Not the best sushi I&#39;ve ever bad but it&#39;s pretty standard.  Their noodle dishes are yummy and my husband, not sushi eater loves their teriyaki.

prices are a bit high for what it is.

The reason I will avoid going back is this 1 waiter that happens to be the only one working everytime I dine there.  I&#39;ve been there 3 times and all three times he has been abysmal.  He loud, crass, and worst of all has forgotten 1 or more dishes every time I&#39;ve dined there.   I always have to ask if the dish is coming and rather than say, I&#39;m sorry I forgot would you still like it... It&#39;s on me.   He puts the order in and charges you for it before you can say, well we&#39;ve finished all our food, I don&#39;t want the item you forgot now. I can see this happening every now and then but every time I&#39;ve dined there... And the lack of customer service from him when I explain that he forgot something is terrible.  The funny thing is, he read the order out loud to us, he had it right but then managed to flub it up somewhere.  

I&#39;ve mentioned this to the mgmt, they&#39;re very nice and gave me a gift card for the inconvenience.  I went back in, to try the restaurant for the 3rd time, got the same waiter and he screwed up the meal again.  

I won&#39;t be going back."

I have never been disappointed and everything I have tried has been fantastic.

The quality of the fish an other ingredients is apparent in taste, texture, and presentation.  It is obvious that the sushi chefs here take pride in their work.

Today I ordered the baja roll - crispy soft shell crab, cilantro, avocado, mayo and sriracha wrapped in soy bean paper.  This is probably the best roll I&#39;ve had here - and I&#39;m disappointed I didn&#39;t find it sooner.  

The nigiri and sashimi are generously portioned and they don&#39;t skimp on the wasabi or ginger.

The ambience is warm and inviting. I want to give a special shout out to Jeff, our server. 

He was friendly, and volunteered to take a picture, as I wanted one of my friend and I. Additionally, he was very attentive to making sure we made it to the event on time, and we had our selected rolls, and drinks ready, efficiently.

We&#39;ve been going here since I was little. My family moved a few years ago and we were excited to return back to sushi house during a trip back home. Our meal started off badly when my dad found a chunk of plastic in his miso soup (which we didn&#39;t complain about). My sushi was good, but my dad ordered the chicken teriyaki and he was totally unsatisfied and felt it didn&#39;t taste anything like chicken. It actually didn&#39;t look anything like chicken either. My dad has a hearty appetite and could eat almost anything, but could not stomach this meal. He had a few bites and told the waitress he was so sorry but he could not eat it. I&#39;ve never seen my dad return food in my 24 years of living. The waitress awkwardly stared at us and just said &#34;ok.&#34; She then called the manager and said her manager said not to comp or discount anything on our bill. So disappointing.

Normally, it is pretty pricey, but if you can catch the lunch special on your day off, then it becomes a phenomenal deal (~$11 for 2 rolls)!

Definitely choose the crunch roll - not only is it tasty, but it is also the most portion-generous. You get 8 pieces (instead of the usual 6), and the roll is 50% bigger than other rolls.

The interior was very nice. If you get luck (or request it) you can sit in one of these very private and beautifully decorate rooms."

While they are new to DG, they are not a new restaurant per se, as they have other locations within the burbs.  With very little outside signage, we all would&#39;ve missed the restaurant entirely had we not been looking for it.

Friendly hostess welcomed us in, and surprisingly American-Italian waiters took our orders.  They were extremely chatty, and enjoyed bringing up all sorts of conversation during our time there, fine if you&#39;re feeling friendly, not as much if you&#39;re looking for a private evening out.  (Is that contradictory?)

All in all, the sushi/rolls were decent, with a few odd ball rolls that threw us for a loop.  Namely:

1.  Shrimp tempura roll had some type of jelly/jam coating the outside along with tempura flakes.  Very odd, and not mentioned on the menu or we wouldn&#39;t have ordered it.

2.  Dan Dan noodles, while meant to be spicy with Sichuan peppers, really was quite mild.

3.  Ama Ebi (sweet shrimp) was good, except the head of the shrimp was overly coated, which caused it to become excessively oily when being eaten.  The body itself was tasty, the head was just too much oil.  

Other rolls we tried were tasty but not exceptional (yes, we&#39;re being snobby, but having tried some phenomenal sushi worldwide, ti&#39;s hard to change your viewpoints), and the sushi itself was pretty good.  

Our one hiccup was that the waiter brought out two smoked salmon sushi, along with four regular salmon sushi, stating that it was how we marked it on the list.  While I&#39;m fairly confidant I had crossed off the two smoked salmon (sister in law changed her mind while we were selecting), the waiter was insistent and wanted to bring us the menu to demonstrate.  Personally, I think resolving the situation without bringing &#34;proof&#34; of a supposed guest&#39;s mistake would have been more appropriate... alas, I just let it go and we ate/paid for the smoked salmon pieces as well.

A few other notes:  

Sushi wise, the chef does it traditional style here with a touch of wasabi under each piece of fish to help it stick tot he rice.  Rice was cooked perfectly, and enjoyable.  Super white tuna had an interesting topping that I don&#39;t typically see anywhere else with sushi restaurant as well.

Verdict:  A nice addition to the DG area, and an okay evening out.  Being somewhat snobbish about sushi though, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be going back."

My friend and I came for a late dinner on a gloomy Sunday so we were the only table there minus a couple who were finishing up their meal.   Service was impeccable but that may have been because we were the only table but nonetheless it was appreciated.  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive; she constantly kept our glasses of water full and checked on us throughout our dinner.  I normally order 2 rolls when I go out for sushi and so I had the Black Dragon roll and the White Dragon roll.  Both of these were very good but I preferred the Black Dragon slightly more than the White Dragon since the black had the sweet unagi sauce and soft shell crab whereas the white had a strong flavor from the wasabi mayonnaise.  Overall both were tasty and much larger rolls than expected.  I overestimated how much I would be able to eat and ended up bringing basically half of my rolls home, whoops!  The sushi was still good the following day, the rice wasn&#39;t hard like it usually becomes when it&#39;s day old sushi.  Sushi House has a warm, inviting ambiance with modern décor.  I recommend stopping by for some sushi and then heading over for some ice cream at Everday&#39;s a Sundae (love the name by the way, quite clever)."

Having remembering wonderful sushi from the Naperville restaurant I had high hopes. I am very grateful that they took our order 20 min before closing and I was able to pick it up 5 min prior to closing. 

We ordered the 2012 Roll, the Chicago Summer Roll, a California Roll and some nigiri.

The 2012 roll: why would anyone put cilantro in a sushi roll? It was so overpowering and unpleasant that even after removing it from the roll it still left the roll very unpleasant tasting. I think if it was made without cilantro in the first place it would have been decent.

The Chicago Summer Roll: it was ok...nothing to write home to mom about though. The tuna seemed to be not very fresh.

California Roll: made with a stick of imitation crab meat. The roll was equal to the quality of the kind you would find in your local grocery store.

The nigiri was ok as well...

All in all I wouldn&#39;t run back to visit this restaurant. If I was to visit Sushi House again I would go to the Naperville location."

sushi-house-downers-grove,Rob B.,s80iIPuzq8fBCHsJS7Gl8A,"Downers Grove, IL",0,1,0,0,26,fNe3EEmN0mV8d_qUT3lrxg,2.0,2014-01-07,"I have been to SH in DG three times now and this new addition to the downtown Downers Grove Restaurant scene has potential, but needs to fix specific things to shine.  I offer this perspective on the basis of having had the opportunity to dine extensively in the Americas and Europe as I travel for my job.  And for Sushi House, I have been to each and every one of their locations in the Chicago area.

Preamble: For me, a Sushi restaurant should be first and foremost a Japanese-styled establishment.  Whilst the wait-staff may not be in every case Japanese, they should a) be exceptionally polite and attentive, b) be ultra-concerned with freshness and cleanliness and c) produce exceptional meals that are not only delish, but artistic and poetic, like an elegant Haiku.  In ancient Japan, where these three factors were not met, the owners could only save face by committing ritual Seppuku, for they could not live with the shame.

Downers Grove Sushi House experience.

1.  Quality of Food.  Outstanding!   5 stars.  This reflects the skill of the sushi chefs, who to me are the heart and soul of the establishment.  The signature rolls are to die for!  Try them all and figure out which you love the most.  Love the Fatty Salmon sashimi.  The SH chefs are the best!

2.  Location and ambiance.  Awesome!  4 stars.  I live in DG and heretofore had to journey to the Naperville, LaGrange and  Danada location for my Sushi House fix so the location is excellent.  The ambiance is very nice.  They have those great tea rooms too which is nice for a semi-private experience.

3.  Service and Wait Staff.  Horrid!  -5 stars or better put - a black hole!   It is not clear to me how Sushi House vets there potential wait staff.  One was very cheerful and in line with who I would expect to find working in a SH.  Another woman, was ok - not really up to the standards of a SH.  She would be better off working at Another Round and then stepping up to a classier place when she is ready to channel the SH vibe.  However, one of the male waiters who I have had the misfortune of dealing with twice was shockingly bad.  Story as follows:

I  chose Sushi House for my wife and my wedding anniversary dinner with the family.  I knew about the tea room so we secured that in a reservation.

Oh no!  The male waiter was assigned to us in the tea room!  I knew from before how rude he could be.  But I thought we would at least be able to tolerate him; I was wrong.

He begrudgingly took our initial order like we were doing him a favor.  His rogue behavior and rudeness shocked us at first, but he came back to chide us for ordering off the sushi menu in a way he didn&#39;t approve of.   I actually thought I was on that MTV show PUNK&#39;D so I was waiting for the gag.  Instead, after another round off the sushi menu, he walked away asking if wethought we could handle the ordering process down yet!  EARTH TO WAIT STAFF - HELLO??!!!  I have been ordering sushi from before you were even convicted to the Federal Penitentiary; I know what I am doing; Iv&#39;e never had a problem anywhere else.  Just because you just made parole from Stateville doesn&#39;t entitle you to be rude to customers.

How did I tip?  I gave the 15% because I felt the Sushi Chefs would hopefully get it.  That would have been a mistake Buster the convict got one cent!

Sushi House - you need to fire the ex-Con who is running your customers out of your establishment.  If he is a mob plant because you owe the mob money, then you are screwed and you have to live with it.

So the final outcome on my anniversary?  
Awesome meal!  Horrible and threatening experience!  

So for me now, it is back to the Naperville and LaGrange Sushi House.  I don&#39;t owe the mob money nor am I incarcerated in the Stateville Correctional Facility.  So I don&#39;t have to put up with thugs and the Aryan Nation as waiters.

I&#39;ll check back in from time to time by myself to see if these wait-staff issues have been fixed.  But there is NO WAY I am bring the family back there until the service substantially improves."

Our order consisted of a spicy tuna, a volcano roll, and we requested a chefs choice roll. He made us a Hymachi Dynamite!  It was delicious. Fresh fish and excellent specialty rolls.

First he rudely walked up to our table of 9 after we waited 30 minutes past our reservation and said &#34;are we drinking tonight&#34; we all replied yes and he said &#34;well then I need 9 IDs NOW&#34; news flash dude you&#39;re not a cop and we are all 25-28 years old. Then he made us all write our orders out for him because it would be &#34;too hard&#34; for him to split our bills. He brought out sushi over the next 2 hours and one member of our party ate after we had all finished. The sushi was great and they have a great takeout deal where you get 20% off if you bring an old receipt an order before 5:30. But I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever go back if that waiter isn&#39;t fired...

Their owner went in  back briefly and the cook came and brought my burger and fries to the table.  A nice touch. I was expecting them to call me to the counter for pickup. 
Scanning their menu,its very extensive &amp; you can order fries several different ways. I liked the food in here. Its slightly above fast food and tasted excellent. The vibe is pretty good here. It doesnt feel like a fast food place. Do try them."

The restaurant itself is ok as far as eye candy.  Nothing special and very basic decorations.  It&#39;s open with a bar that&#39;s not really a bar but has become more of a serving station.  

I arrived before my friend and waited for about 10 minutes for a glass of water and for someone to acknowledge me.  I finally was able to place an order for an appetizer (Thai eggrolls) as I was hungry.  My friend came about 10 minutes later and as soon as she sat down they asked if we were ready for our order.. uh no.. I know you saw her just sit down.  But at that time I was able to place my order for a can of soda.  

We placed our food order... We ordered the appetizer variety plate, I ordered noodles medium hot and my friend order the tom yum soup.  After about another 10 minutes or so my app came to the table with her soup... uh that was her meal.  Shortly after our appetizer plate came... 3 pieces of fried tofu, 1 eggroll halved, 2 crab rangoons (mini), 2 chicken satays, something else, and serves with 3 sauces... soy, peanut, and chili.  It was OK.. I would not get it again.  

My noodles were shortly behind that order. I really liked my dish and I would get it again.  It was a perfect hot spice for me with thick rice noodles, green peppers, onions, and bean sprouts.  My friend enjoyed her soup as well... chunky with vegetables.  We go there occasionally because the food is good and overall it&#39;s the closest Thai place to us.  The prices are reasonable too... yes we will return but I have never been a fan of the service!"

It was okay, nothing spectacular. But one of my last bites I felt something in my mouth and pulled out a LONG HAIR!!!

I am so disgusted by this. I can&#39;t imagine anything more disgusting than pulling a strangers hair out of your mouth. 

I told my waitress and she just asked if I wanted another. I said no, because I was full and told her I just wanted to bring it to her attention. I&#39;m not one to outright ASK for my meal to be comped, but most establishments would offer upon finding out there is a hair in the food. 

So she sends her manager out. The manager examines the hair. Quite closely. And proceeds to tell me that it is most certainly not a hair from anyone in the kitchen staff as the hair is too thin and they wear hats. She then told me that it was probably mine. And blamed it on me. 

Excuse me? Since when do we blame the customer? I didn&#39;t ask for anything but simply wanted to bring it to their attention. This stuff happens. But own up to it. Apologize. Comp a $10 meal. I didn&#39;t say it came from their heads. It could&#39;ve been in the product already. Blown up off the floor. Anything. But if a customer finds a HAIR in the meal, you do not blame it on said customer. 

Worst customer service ever. Save yourself. Go somewhere else."

It was almost like a dry rice paper? I&#39;m not sure but there was certainly no rice noodles or mint leaves inside like we were hoping for instead just lettuce and a Very thin slice of tofu. My friend got the pad Thai which was admittedly very yummy but still a little greasy. I ordered the green curry; the sauce was very light and fragrant but there was hardly any chicken in there.

We loved the crispy duck but they are no longer serving it. We should have left but decided to stay. We only ordered two dishes (sauteed duck &amp; noodles) and 2 Thai iced tea. the duck dish had few duck pieces in them and the beef noodles were the same. The duck was a little chewy but the rest of the ingredients tasted fresh.  The noodles had little pieces of beef but still turn out ok.
I wish I could give two reviews, taste and price. The portion were very small and not a dish to share.  If it is a one time place to eat and you have a taste for Thai, this is the place but not to be a regular customer. It was too pricey for its portion and it&#39;s ambience."

We had ordered 3 chicken pad thai and 1 beef pad sew wee. The portions of the noodles were packed to the brim. Note that there are 3 levels of seasoning. There is mild, AS, which is American Spicy, and TS which is Thai Spicy. Thai Spicy is super spicy in my personal opinion. Also ordered a Chicken Satay appetizer, Thai spring roll, Thai Egg roll, and Su Mai. They were a good portion for a small appetizer. The Thai ice tea here is definitely a solid choice for beverage. Overall, the experience here was pleasant and will definitely revisit again. The only issue I had with the carry out was that they don&#39;t have an updated menu online."

I would have eaten this as an entree, and I liked it more than my pad thai.  The rice was a little greasy but not revolting.  I loved the chunks of pineapple and roasted cashews that were mixed in.  Two of us devoured the container. 

Chicken pad thai was good, but the chicken was overcooked as it was very dry and chewy.  I would definitely get their pad thai again, but maybe without any meat.  I ordered all of our dishes as &#34;American spicy.&#34;  

Your spice-level options at Thaiway are:  Mild, Medium, American-Spicy, and Thai-Spicy.  I do like spicy food, but I am not a thrillseeker.  I do not find pleasure in my mouth or lips burning.  That being said, the American-spicy was perfect.  It was a tad too spicy for me, but I&#39;d recommend this - not Thai-spicy unless it sounds like a fun idea to snort Flamin&#39; Hot Cheetos.

We also had crab rangoons.  The filling was okay and they were perfectly crispy on the outside.  If you have a &#34;take it or leave it&#34; attitude about rangoons, then don&#39;t get them.  

The portion sizes are large.  I ate my leftovers for lunch and even then I still had some leftover.  My husband finished his but laughed when I told him some people complained about portion sizing.  If you&#39;ve got a huge appetite, I&#39;d suggest ordering an appetizer or rice to share with someone.

The one drawback I can think of is that there isn&#39;t a menu online.  If you aren&#39;t familiar with Thai you will need to look at the menu.  So when I arrived I grabbed a paper menu and browsed.  The lady behind the counter was really friendly and gave me more than enough time to read the menu.  After ordering in-person, it only took 10-15 minutes to get our food.

I look forward to going back and being a little more daring with my Thai choices, maybe with some of their curries and the spicy basil rice."

First off, there was no spice to this rice.  I probably could have gone Thai-Hot and been ok.  Granted, I like really spicy food, but this was really mild to be the second from the top in spice level.

Secondly, the food had no flavor to it.  The basil was chopped super small (it looked like it was dehydrated basil), the egg was barely there, the chicken was overcooked, and the bell peppers lacked taste.  If I hadn&#39;t known what I ordered, I would have never guessed what it was supposed to be.

Unlike some posters stated in the past, I thought the portion sizes were more than adequate.  Had I wanted to eat more of it, I would have had more than enough for another meal.  Unfortunately, over half of this ended up in the trash."

My experiences of Thai prior to this was a little hole in the wall in Toledo behind a Thai grocery store (always the best ethnic food places).  
The menu at Thaiway was comprehensive and included many Thai favorites including satay, tod mun pla, green papaya salad, tom kha, lad nar, pad see oew, pad woon sen. 
We ordered the tod mun pla (fish cakes) and green papaya salad for the appetizer.  I ordered the green papaya salad as Thai spicy and was glad that I did so.  The Thai spicy was just hot enough, although I have had hotter it at other places. The tod mun pla were sweet and flavorful with lemongrass. 
For entree my husband had the pad see ewe American medium and I ordered the Masaman curry at American spicy.  The pad see ewe was flavorful but more of a mild than a medium, the curry was tasty but again a little under spiced.  I think that in order to appeal to the widest audience they have toned down the spicing considerably (this would be my only complaint)  If you are going to eat here and are used to spicy food then order it Thai spicy if you would like some heat to your food.  
We also ordered Thai iced tea, which was as sweet and flavorful as a good Thai iced tea should be.  
Overall we were very happy with the experience and will be back again."

I had a Thai iced tea and they overdid it on the spices and sugar in the drink. It could just be a recipe thing, but it was more or less like trying to drink spicy syrup -- not appetizing.

I had to prevent myself from warbling &#34;I did it Thaiiiiii-waaaaay...&#34; as I walked in to meet my friend for dinner. 

It was pretty quiet since it was a snowy night; only a couple of tables full, and people were keeping their conversations muted, perhaps taking the cue from the soundless flatscreen tv showing the news on one wall. 

Decor is a little schizo: sherbert-colored walls (lime, lemon and orange) clash with the navy-blue-and-tulips carpet, with some southeast Asian handicraft wall hangings and 3-D flying birds on another wall for flair. 

The menu has a good array of choices (though they could stand to take more professional pictures for the menu: some didn&#39;t make the food look its best), and our friendly waitress was very helpful in discerning what might work for us. For example, my friend was going to order sweet and sour chicken. The waitress let her know that Thai-style sweet and sour is different from the Chinese style that most people are used to and thus may be expecting: it&#39;s not breaded, it has a tomato-based sauce and spices. Based on this information, my friend chose a different dish (it would have been helpful if this info was on the menu too). 

I ordered the pineapple fried rice with shrimp, which comes with onion, cashews, bell peppers, and asked for no tomatoes; the waitress let me know that normally it&#39;s stir-fried with a tomato-based sauce (something I&#39;ve never heard of for fried rice...), so I ordered it without (again, her alertness was appreciated). The fried rice was very tasty, if a bit greasy: a huge mound arrived on the plate, with the added treat of orange and yellow bell peppers, not only the pedestrian green ones. Yum. 

It&#39;s nice that there&#39;s another Asian option aside from Chinese (and the pricey Aodake for Japanese) in Romeoville. If I&#39;m down here and hungry, my way is Thaiway."

The food has changed a bit, but not too much. Honestly we only ordered Pad Thai and the little egg rolls so I don&#39;t really know anything about their menu overhaul. The food was noticeably different, not bad, but not what we were used to, so it was a little disappointing. It also seems like their portions became a little smaller.

Let me start out by saying that I think you&#39;re pretty cool.  Your waitresses were so friendly!  I found your crab rangoon and Thai egg rolls to be delightful, and my family really enjoyed their pad thai, Panang curry, and pad kee mao.  A+, kid.  Seriously.  My pho was a bit heavy on the cloves for my taste (and was that cinnamon?  Huh), but I guess I can forgive that because, well, you&#39;re a Thai restaurant.  I know I shouldn&#39;t expect too much of you.  You&#39;re doing your best.

The thing is - oh, dear, this is awkward - when my fam and I came in for dinner last week, you kind of...smelled.  Bad.  Like, really bad.  Like sulphur, or rotten eggs, or backed-up sewage.  Don&#39;t take it personally, dude!  I just thought someone should let you know.  My brother assured me that you don&#39;t usually smell this way, but it was bad enough that something needed to be said.

Well, I guess that&#39;s all.  Whew!  Glad I got that off my chest.  Take care, guy.

Pals,

Located off Weber road the location is a bit hidden (turn at the Culver&#39;s sign) in a strip mall.  From the outside Thai Way doesn&#39;t seem too appealing but go inside it&#39;s really cute, clean, and everything matches or pertains to a Thai theme.  

Who cares about all that.  It&#39;s the food that matters, right?  First the appetizers are great, my fiancee always gets the spring rolls which are fresh and accompanied by a peanut sauce.  The Curries are wonderful and I highly recommend the Panang Curry with thick noodles (an interesting touch).  As with most Asian cuisine your order can be tailored to what you want.  The Pad See Ew is delicious and has a mesquite flavor too it.

Overall the service is great, the restaurant is clean, and the prices are reasonable.  It&#39;s not the greatest of all time which is why I&#39;m keeping the 5th star to myself, but this is a repeatable establishment with great Thai for the burbs."

I&#39;ve tried KT Thai (the preceding) restaurant and that was mediocre and I thought that possibly a new place would be better... I was horribly mistaken. This is as far away from authentic as possible, and I would know - I was raised on southeast Asian regional cuisine.

I ordered their Tod Mun Pla (fish cakes) for the price they weren&#39;t worth it. They were quarter sized which also means that they weren&#39;t  freshly prepped. Instead it was a frozen product that was used. The dipping sauce wasn&#39;t even good and it&#39;s kind of sad when you can even get sauce right.

I also ordered their Pad Krapow with pork. Thinking about this particular dish brings so much disdain. First off the portion that was given is ludicrous.  For the price I was charged I expected it to feed at least 2 people. Their butchering skills are that of a little kid who went to town on a slab of meat. Due to the varying sizes of the meat some pieces were cooked more than others. I wish I could tell you how it tasted but I can&#39;t because SALT was the dominant flavor profile here. Not to mention the &#39;juice&#39; from the stirfry was black in color (?!?). Also it was extremely watery. They also stirfried it with random vegetables that aren&#39;t suited for this dish.  Because of the way the dish turned out, I&#39;m led to believe that they didn&#39;t use proper stirfrying techique because everything appeared to be boiled which would explain the bounty of watery juice since nothing got a proper flash fry sear.

I rarely try Pad Thai at other restaurants just because it isn&#39;t something I find necessary since it&#39;s easily accessible at home .. But this restaurant boasts their Pad Thai as the &#34;best in town&#34;. They boast a lot of things like Deep Fried Twinkies .. Maybe that should have been my warning sign. 

Between the uninspiring decor and poor quality of the food, Thaiway will not receive patronage from me. Oh and don&#39;t bother trying to call the manager if something goes awry, they don&#39;t follow up on their customers!"

It has been a frustrating experience living in the suburbs and not having a place to grab a decent sandwich other than Smitty&#39;s on the Corner which sucks because they are closed on Sundays. I know they are located in a downtown area where most businesses are closed, but I wonder if they realize or care about how much money they are missing out on? At any rate, Deane&#39;s is thankfully open 7 days a week and I will happily continue to patronize them.
Besides being a deli, they also carry specialty items to include a great selection of artisan mustards, chips, house made herb butters, chicken pot pies, black bean patties, and quinoa granola just to name a few. Another thing that is awesome about this deli is that they offer a generous amount of samples of their food. Today they had samples of their fresh baked scones, chocolate chip cookies, the above mentioned herb butter with slices of french bread and their caprese bread. They were all delicious and provided you with a taste of the quality of food that is offered at Deane&#39;s. For lunch, we had the smoky chicken salad sandwich and the turkey sandwich. They were both very good, but lacked enough seasoning. They offer multi grain bread which is another plus. I will be back again this week specifically for their black bean hummus wraps..yum!"

First, was surprised they used packaged bread/rolls from turano.  The key to success will be high quality food that&#39;s fresh and tasty.  I know your new but differentiating yourself from other places is key and off the shelf bread won&#39;t cut it.  Which leads me to the meats.  Turkey seemed fresh roasted but there was more dark meat than white with some grizzle.  Very odd.  Is it processed or freshly roasted?  If the former, not good, if the latter then buy better turkey breasts cause white meat is king.  Nice ambience, great location.  Nice owners too.  Best of luck!"

There is one Subway with:

- Old vegetables that never seem to change.

- Slow and surly service.

- Cleanliness issues.

... and a habit of putting very little of most ingredients on subs.

Then, there is another Subway restaurant. They do an excellent job. See my other review for background regarding that establishment.

If I am rating a Subway, it is because there are serious flaws within the place. We ordered quite a few subs for some guys doing a difficult remodeling job quickly. 

These were some mediocre sandwiches. Come on, change the vegetables! Fresh won&#39;t hurt you...

Since there are so many Subway restaurants around, I would avoid this one."

It&#39;s always full, yet never seems hectic or elbowy at the salad bar. That&#39;s why I come here - sometimes I just want a salad bar and I&#39;m willing to drive across town to get this kind of variety and quality. It&#39;s way better than another soup/salad place I might mention. First, the ingredients are unfailingly fresh and promptly replenished. Second, the pre-made salads are unusual and tasty AND well labeled. I don&#39;t eat pork, and I don&#39;t like pork surprises. Not an issue here. There are lots of fun accompaniments for the salads, like mini cornbread and gingerbread muffins, pickles, crackers. And of course, there&#39;s the very decent soft serve to top it all off. The price is great, too! I should mention that there are lots of options as far as sandwiches and soups but I never get those myself. My hubby does, and he likes them but when I crave a salad bar, Jason&#39;s Deli is where I head.

I have to mention one irritation here. If they fixed it I would be one happy camper: the chairs. They&#39;re heavy, so you can&#39;t pick them up easily to slide them in or out. OMG the sound of those chairs shrieking on the floors makes me literally plug my ears. And if tables need to be hauled around to be reconfigured... I escape to the patio when I can.

At Jason&#39;s Deli, the clean eater can load up at the large salad bar to her heart&#39;s content. -Full of fresh ingredients. None of that wilted lettuce or those weird unidentifiable concoctions here. The semi-clean-eater-lover boy can load up on salad with a sandwich on the side. And the &#34;dirty&#34; ones can satisfy their &#34;clean&#34; mama by loading up on salad with their soups while feeling dirty enough from eating the self-serve ice cream.

They have a substantial menu of hot or cold sandwiches and a daily array of soups as well as the salad bar. It brings in quite a crowd for lunch but dinner is not as bad. Despite the crowd, they are quick to clear tables and I never find myself endlessly circling for a place to park my tray. But speaking of parking.... that particular lot is home to several restaurants and is nearly always full --endlessly circling for a space there is common practice.

The staff members are cordial and quick with a smile, and the food is legit.

I love the Pastrami on rye with yellow mustard. And  although the rye is a little less robust, in terms of flavor and texture, than I prefer, the pastrami is top shelf in my book (I&#39;ve been a connoisseur since the third grade).

The French onion soup is also very good, with a well timed whirl under the broiler, adequate onions, and a rich flavorful broth.  The requisite cheese and crouton are present  and tasty as well.
And of course the free soft serve ice cream and pickles are hard to best.  As for the ambiance, it&#39;s on par with a Panera or Potbelly."

I always get the Manager&#39;s special side salad with 1/2 sandwich for shy of $9. The soup and sandwich combo is a dollar less (but you can get a soup and sandwich anywhere). If you want to get the soup though, try the french onion- I think it is better and less saltier than the one from Panera. The tomato soup is too chunky for my liking though. 

What sets Jason&#39;s Deli apart is the salad bar. The salad bar is AMAZING and filled with various types of lettuce, lots of veggie toppings, potato/egg/tuna/pasta salad mixes, nuts and berries, etc. The side salad is big enough to eat as a meal on its own and I always take my 1/2 sandwich to go for lunch the next day! I wish more places had a reasonably priced salad bar... OH! They also have these adorable mini corn bread and pumpernickel (??) breads. 

I&#39;ve been here once for lunch (and my last time ever) for a salad to go, and it was terribly busy, and nothing was getting stocked. I felt REALLY bad for the workers since you can tell customers were getting ticked.

Nope. The Rueben sandwich I received was an imposter. The taste test failed &amp; lacked moisture on every level...it was dry. The pickle is pre-packaged...YIKES!  This was absolutely the opposite of &#34;Good&#34;! You fill in the appropriate 3 letter word.

I&#39;ve never had anything else. I know they have a diverse menu but until I can get back to N&#39;awlins, Jason&#39;s will satisfy my muffaletta craving.

I don&#39;t come here often, as lunchtime rushes are abysmal. The parking lot is always full, and it&#39;s a fight-to-the-death faceoff between two cars trying to snag a parking spot. I used to place my order ahead of time and pick it up fairly easily. However, my new gig does not allow  us to use the internet for personal use, or our cell phones while at our desks. So if I want to place an order I have to hike a mile out past our parking lot in order to get service (thanks, Sprint). I didn&#39;t have time for that on Thursday.

My latest trip here wasn&#39;t bad. Of course, it was the day after Christmas, so obviously people were bum-rushing the stores to return their gifts and not be bothered with a lunch beyond the drive-thru. So, it worked out perfectly.

My muffaletta was perfect, as always. I always get the &#34;half muff&#34; so I can eat the other part later. I think I&#39;ve ordered a full one once, and I don&#39;t recall finishing it. I do remember it&#39;s just as big as the original found on Decatur Street in New Orleans.

Or, if its nice outside , get your order to go (it is a separate line/entrance) and eat outside.  We have done this plenty of times and we only took half hour for lunch.

Food is always good and you HAVE to love free ice cream!  Also, when you do not purchase the salad bar, you are at least able to access part of the salad bar.

I like it because the proximity to work makes it entirely possible to eat in and get back in an hour, and the menu offers something for damn near everyone. 

Dependent on if dieting is a thing this week or not is what I order. For instance, if I&#39;m feeling gluttonous, the clear choice are their baked potatoes. I know, baked potatoes don&#39;t sound particularly indulgent, but Jason&#39;s potatoes are different. First of all, they&#39;re the size of your head. I honestly don&#39;t even get where they find potatoes this size. They actually offer a smaller version in case you don&#39;t appreciate an entire dinner plate full of potato (in which case WHAT is wrong with you and get out of my life). But THEN they take this roided out tater and slather it with butter. Like a stick of butter. THEN, dependent on what type of potato you get is what else gets piled on. I&#39;m a plain Jane type of girl - they smother this badboy with a mountain of cheese, bacon, green onions (I hate onion but I&#39;ll let it slide on this), and sour cream. It is SO GOOD. They also offer ones with chicken, salsa, broccoli, etc. AMAZING.

The hubs is one of those skinny-no-matter-what-he-eats dudes, so he&#39;ll often go for a potato + a creamy soup or half a sandwich. He also loves their muffulettas, which are on some kind of fancy bread and piled with fresh meats/cheeses. 

Most of the time, especially when I&#39;m there on a lunch hour, a heavy dish is not in the cards, which is why I love that they have THEEEEE best salad bar EVER. Now hold up, I know what you&#39;re thinking - a Golden Corral-y mess of snot, sneezes, evil children and half chewed spinach?! You&#39;re nast, Ames! BUT ITS NOT. THIS salad bar is immaculate! Clean! Fresh! Well stocked! Has an intense glass sneeze/child/life guard! And I&#39;ve never once seen a child near it (all due respect to children, I just...no). They have the best selection of stuff you don&#39;t typically see, like beets, artichoke hearts, a Greek feta cheese blend, different types of croutons, etc. You can go back as many times as you want and it&#39;s delicious every single time. 

Also, they have free ice cream. FREE. Delicious. Soft serve. Also set up such that kids can&#39;t goober all over it. Win-win!

All in all, an awesome place to stop for lunch or a light dinner with a huge menu, an awesome salad bar, and impeccably clean, bright, inviting atmosphere. And Mega Potatoes. What&#39;s not to love?"

It&#39;s got a great selection.  And, although I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s a a real Deli... they can make a sandwich.

I really like there corned beef.  It&#39;s got a great flavor to it.  Usually I only like Corned Beef warm, but here I could go either way.

They are probably a little bit more expensive then your average lunch spot... but it&#39;s just not an everyday kinda place.

The Soups are pretty good too.

It&#39;s Cafeteria style so no need to tip.  Love that aspect.  But the staff are very knowledge when ringing up your order, so don&#39;t be afraid to ask what their opinions are."

That&#39;s all you really NEED to know about Jason&#39;s Deli.  I will add that this place gets super busy during lunch time (11:30-12:30).  If you&#39;re in a rush to get back to work, I&#39;d recommend placing an order online so you can go right to the take-out counter.  Or just get here earlier/later.  

My mom and I arrived around 11:30 and the line to the register was already almost backed up to the door.  This wasn&#39;t a problem for us since we wanted to look at the menu anyway, and the line did move fairly quick.  My mom&#39;s eyes widened when I told her about the free ice cream, and I could tell she was trying to re-evaluate what to order now that I&#39;d informed her.

I had the Cuban sandwich and a cup of the tortilla soup.  The Cuban sandwich wasn&#39;t very good.  I ate it, but I wouldn&#39;t order it again.  It tasted like it was missing the pork or ham, and the cheese wasn&#39;t melted as it should be in a pressed/Panini sandwich.  I really liked the tortilla soup though even though it had a spicy kick that really kicked me in the throat.

My mom had the new cranberry turkey sandwich (like a twist on Thanksgiving).  It looked better than my Cuban, and she said she really liked it.  The menu here is huge, so I will definitely be back for a (different) sandwich or the salad bar.  And who doesn&#39;t like free ice cream?"

First and foremost, I wasn&#39;t such a big fan of the set up from the entrance to where you order your food. My husband and I weren&#39;t sure where we were supposed to order initially, and even though some employees clearly saw us standing there, they didn&#39;t bother helping us for several minutes until we asked.
(They were actually standing behind the to-go register joking around and didn&#39;t offer any assistance.)

When we got to the general area food ordering area; another customer had to hand us a menu and show us where to order.
(Thank you, random gentleman customer! :)

I ordered a wrap and my husband got a sandwich of some sort. They were good, but nothing crazy special or extra delicious. 

The cafeteria-esque set up is ok if you like that sort of atmosphere, but it isn&#39;t my cup of tea in general. 

I wouldn&#39;t mind going back one of these days, but the free soft serve ice cream and freebies next to the salad bar aren&#39;t necessarily going to have me rush through the doors again anytime soon."

I also love it because it&#39;s family friendly. The kids menu has good variety. And there is a complimentary self serve ice cream machine.

Their salad bar offers some good fresh choices and their sandwiches are large and have high quality ingredients. 

I would usually consider them to be about a 3 star location. Not incredible but a pretty healthy reasonably priced meal. 

HOWEVER - after my wife found a dead insect in her salad today, the lack of concern by the staff was extremely disappointing. I don&#39;t mean to say that they should have been worried for her health - only that they should have been interested in making sure that the food was free of infestation.  When she brought it to the attention of the staff, their only comment was &#34;OK&#34; as they took her bowl. There was no attempt to remedy the situation at all, and she was not offered a new meal or a refund. More upsetting, they did not check the items on the salad bar to make sure that they were fresh and free from insects. Basically they left us feeling like this was a common experience and that they were uninterested in keeping a clean restaurant. 

I would like to give this restaurant another chance but I&#39;m more worried about the casual response that we received than anything else."

I ordered a corned beef on rye with swiss.  The order came out quickly, and the sandwich was awesome.  It was served warm with the cheese slightly melted, and tons of meat.  A winner.

The meats are fantastic. Shaved turkey and corned beef, to name my favorites. The breads, be it a croissant or rye, are delish, crispy, soft. 

Their fruit cups, to go, laugh at any other quickly purchased cups anywhere else.

Be aware that if you arrive between 11.45-12.30ish the line will be long. Out the door, possibly. It goes fairly quickly, and is worth the wait. Hot food is delivered to your table, always tasty and plates are cleared away quickly. 

I usually get their Veggaletta and French Onion Soup, but today I branched out and tried a pizza special they had. The pizza was messy, but very good, with tomatoes, spinach and artichokes.

Seriously, they have someone constantly replenishing every item.  And for an added bonus, it&#39;s reasonably priced.

Besides the salad bar, the fountain drinks are ace too. They got their own brand of drinks along with commonly found brands.  Free refills and they have soft serve cream along the counter.  Score!

Also, the place is kept really clean and they a have a lot of tables for outdoor seating when it&#39;s nice out. This is the first Jason&#39;s Deli I&#39;ve been to in Illinois, and even though its a chain, I liked one in particular.  The layout and location are great!"

My motivation for writing this review tonight is another screwed up FREE taco salad (chicken chili cup was half full and I asked for extra poco de gallo on the side in addition to what they put on the salad, but they just gave me a small cup on the side and none on the salad).

This sandwich comes on a toasted croissant with turkey breast, bacon, swiss cheese, tomato (which I refrained from), sprouts, mayo, and guacamole.  I had the sandwich with baked chips on the side.

The line went about 6 deep outside the store, meaning maybe 30 people to the order-taking cashier.  I saw numerous people walk up and turn to go to several other lunch alternatives nearby, so I think that line length is about the critical length.

I had a turkey/guacolmole bagel sandwich and blue corn chips for $4.99.  It was fresh, healthy, and a good deal.  They also have a pretty large outdoor dining area next to the store.  If you&#39;re a first time visitor, grab a menu while you&#39;re in the line going to cashier, because there&#39;s no menu board to look at, and you have a lot of options.

I was a bit sandwiched out, so I decided on the Plain Jane. I felt a little lame. Until it came. Holy spuds mackenzie. The Plain Jane is the biggest potato this side of Idaho (insert lame &#34;no, YOU da ho&#34; joke here). Seriously, people. If there had been a sudden downpour, we could have all climbed in and floated along for days, and would have had plenty of food to stuff our faces.

On the plus side, Jason&#39;s now has Coke products in the fountain.  They got rid of the strange tasting drinks they had before."

3 stars isn&#39;t quite enough but 4 stars is a bit too much. We tried it for the 1st time today and it was decent. We tried a BLT and Chicken Panini. Both were average and perhaps next time we will try something else and update the review to 4 stars. However, it is pricey for sandwiches and chips.

We didn&#39;t try it but the salad bar looked good.

We did indulge in the free soft serve ice cream at the end and, well, it was terrible. Left a bad taste."

I didn&#39;t know where to order, what to order, and felt semi-pressured to make a decision.  When I finally ordered, the lady at the register kind of gave me a hard time about my spicy sandy.. I LOVE SPICY, so back off lady. 

It&#39;s a little pricey.. I don&#39;t get why places charge so much for a sandwich, but, I do have to say, they don&#39;t disappoint on the amount of product.  I actually had to pull of some of the turkey on my sandwich because there was so much.

I really do need to try this place out a few more times.. hopefully with each visit I will be less confused and able to find the yummiest stuff.

I still gave 4 stars b/c the sandwiches were pretty damn good.. and I love me some potato salad. Yum! Hope to update this review soon!"

The food is very fresh.  They have organic options, gluten free, also I like how they advertise that things are sweetened with cane sugar.  Usually that is a good sign of a place being fresh and health conscious.  Nobody wants high fructose corn syrup.

Love it. Love it. Love it."

Not typically a lunch eater and normally fall back on a hot cup of coffee, a co-worker mentioned Jason&#39;s having salads so naturally I wound up stopping by one day when coffee would not suffice. 

Word association of the day: Delicious. 

My go to for this place tends to be the Chicken Club Salad that has roasted chicken and avocados. It&#39;s rich and filling and won&#39;t break your wallet all too bad. For a good healthy salad that hasn&#39;t been placed in a glass case (sorry starbucks I&#39;m looking at you) all day long, their salads are freshly tossed and made to order. It&#39;s refreshing to see an organic deli and I will gladly wait in line that stretches out the door and struggle for a seat if I have to. All in the name of good food and good service.

There is also a catering menu, which is perfect for the business folk who are looking for someplace of substance that delivers. I mean, we all love the pizza deliveries, but having salads or sammies delivered is pretty fabulous. Mind you, there is a $25 minimum delivery fee so get a few people together and order up.

Definitely a go to in Naperville if you want a quick salad or sandwich to go or to eat in that is healthy and good. The max you&#39;re looking to cough up is still under $13.00 and that&#39;s with a drink. The next time you find yourself around the corner, it&#39;s either Subway, JJ or Jason&#39;s...give &#39;em a try."

I like the good varied choice of deli sandwiches, wraps, salads and soups.  They have several vegetarian choices and they are kind enough to list calorie counts for a few items which I find really helpful.  Not that I always pay attention, but helpful nevertheless.  If I&#39;m not in the mood for a sandwich, the all-you-can-eat salad bar is respectable and has yummy little baked muffins.  This is a good place for a meet-up with friends - something for everyone, casual, and not expensive."

This place rocked my socks off this morning.  The menu had way too many choices to pick from; I ended up picking the Papa Joe with a side of fruit and tomato basil soup.  The Papa Joe was full of lots of different flavors that all blended into each bite of awesomeness. &#34;Named for our founders dad. toasted herb focaccia with turkey breast, asiago, roasted tomatoes, basil pesto sauce with nuts, mayo.&#34;  The fruit came with some sweet yogurtish dip that was fairly tasty.  The tomato basil soup was perfect temp and was actually kinda chunky rather than the typical smooth tomato soup I am used to.  Several items on the menu were vegetarian, organic, or &#34;crap free&#34; as I like to call it.   Line moved fast and efficiently.  Servers were friendly as well.  The drink station and salad bar had lots of options and were kept very clean.  I was just super impressed with everything and have to find a reason to return really soon to try some of the other yummy menu items."

I then went to pick up my tray and plate for the salad bar and both me and the person I went with got trays with food still on them and dirty plates. Most tables, even though there was a ton of staff, had empty dirty trays and plates on them the entire time we were there. There were spills the staff would just pass up around the ice cream section and the salad bar that the staff would just ignore and would &#34;clean&#34; around. It makes me wonder how clean the food is during the off hours.

That&#39;s what every gluten avoiding person wants to hear!! Unfortunately, I am currently on a stricter diet of no bread (ugh!), so I chose from their dedicated menu of gluten free salads. The Chicken Club Salad won out, and it was divine! The asiago and cheddar cheese combo really set the flavor, and combined with the tomato, avocado, and bacon, your tastebuds just couldn&#39;t lose! LOVED IT! I recommend it with the ranch dressing. For the record, the salad bar also looked equally as delicious, as did the GF soup selections. I only gave this experience four stars because it&#39;s based on one dish, and I wasn&#39;t able to review the gluten free sandwich bread. :(

Dear Jason&#39;s Deli (I know you&#39;re reading this!) - I realize there is the risk of cross-contamination at the salad bar, but could you pretty please label the salad bar items as GF or not?

That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t see the value of eating organic, just that there aren&#39;t that many places to accommodate your needs if that&#39;s your thing. A few years ago I was introduced to Jason&#39;s by a co-worker when we had an office in a nearby park. In general, I don&#39;t hand out too many five star reviews for restaurants, but with Jason&#39;s, it is time to make an exception.

To start, they have a DEEP menu. Yes, there are enough choices here to be a bit overwhelming if you&#39;ve never visited them before. Personally, I like having the larger menu. If you stop in enough, you&#39;ll find your favorites before long, and you might discover a new one along the way! The food they use is top-notch and tastes fresher than many other lunch places. 

Thanks to the non-stop soft-serve ice cream, the lunch buffet and tons of great sandwiches to choose from, I always left this place stuffed. Thankfully it is healthy food, otherwise even this skinny boy would have gained a few pounds! Another nice touch is that they have a large magazine rack to pick through titles while you are enjoying your meal. If that&#39;s not your thing, they usually have one of the tv&#39;s tuned to a news channel if you wish to catch up on the days events that way.

The great food combined with a very clean dinning area and bathrooms makes for an enjoyable experience. Also worthy of note is that all of the staff there is extremely friendly, something I&#39;ll chalk up to the excellent management staff which is available if you need them and they interact with the customers instead of hiding in an office or kitchen. 

Two final tips: Make sure to get there before or after the noon-1pm lunch rush or you will wait in a long line. This place gets all the local office cubicle drones! We are addicted! Last but not least, sign up for their email newsletter and you&#39;ll get a free lunch on your birthday each year."

The bad thing about Jason&#39;s Deli is that it has a rather large menu. Yes, the fact that they have lots of options is both a good and bad thing.

For me, it means that I want to try a different item each time I go. My first two visits, my choices were home runs. The first time I made my own sandwich, the second time I chose to do the ranchero wrap - again, very good. The third time, I tried the turkey reuben and it was completely disgusting which left me wondering if maybe I should stick to one of the first two things I tried there. 

As people have mentioned- they have some soft serve ice cream in the back that you can help yourself to- which reminds me of a cruise we were on where they offered the same thing and my husband would see how big of a cone he could manage to make. :)"

I saw it getting built and went shortly after. They have a great menu and everything is delicious. I used to go here all the time when my friend lived here, it was our spot. I miss it and don&#39;t go here as much because I feel it&#39;s weird to go without her. However, she was in town yesterday and while scarfing down my usual, I thought,  &#34;Why haven&#39;t I Yelped this place yet?!&#34;

I usually stick to what I like, which is the Ciabatta Garden with a side of steamed vegetables. It&#39;s extremely basic, but it&#39;s delicious. A reason why I chose that sandwich as my usual is because the first time I went there I was a vegetarian, I ordered this and fell in love. I always feel really good after I eat here. Probably because my meal is composed of whole grains and veggies, but I&#39;ve tried some of their sides and have seen what my friends get here--everything looks delicious or is described deliciously in the menu.

Let me tell you the hilarious part about my order; it&#39;s literally vegetables on bread and steamed veggies on the side. However, my food ALWAYS gets there at least 3 minutes after my friend&#39;s meal who orders something much more complex. It&#39;s not something I&#39;m complaining about, I just think it&#39;s funny because that&#39;s the case each time.

The cherry on top is the free soft serve that you help yourself to after the meal. You can ask for my opinion on Jason&#39;s, but don&#39;t dare ask me to make your ice cream cone. You can usually find my ice cream hanging all dilapidated over the side of the cone.

They are starting to pop up all over the place, so definitely check it out if you&#39;re hungry and passing by one. They&#39;re able to please everyone.

I have to tell you, at this location, they are extremely busy between 12-1:30. Generally, if I&#39;m here with a friend, we wait. If I&#39;m alone, I go some place else. Any other time and you&#39;re golden. That particular strip mall tends to bank on the lunch crowd, while the restaurants clean up during dinner."

I just L O V E the ranchero wrap from this place!  I&#39;m not a wrap kind of person to begin with, but this wrap has got it GOIN ON.  It&#39;s a chicken [chicken is marinated] wrap with pico de gallo, a couple sauces and jalapenos!  The jalapenos add a little bit of a kick to it, it&#39;s not too hot, but just right! It comes with a side of chips and salsa.  I use all the salsa for my chips and dip for my wrap.  

My other favorites are the pastas! They are all delicious!  With the perfect amount of sauce, just perfect everything.  The pasta is not soggy nor is it under cooked, it&#39;s just right.  Even the mac n cheese, if you consider that pasta, is perfect!

The desert is also delicious... my personal favorite is the turtle cheesecake...mmmm.  There&#39;s different desert everytime I go.  But I try not to forget to get my ice cream :P

I am a big person on customer service and they have EXCELLENT customer service.  Everyone says hello, they are very accomodating and make you feel welcome.  The salad bar has a lot and they keep it very clean and neat.  I feel comfortable grabbing food for my salad and not having to worry about if the person ahead of me contaminated some of the food.

Some days the chicken seems to be too marinated.  It&#39;s not soggy, nothing with the texture, but the taste of it seems that the chicken is marinated for a while.  I mean it&#39;s still good, it takes a couple of bites to realize is.  I believe it&#39;s the same chicken they use in some of their pasta dishes. I tend to realize it when I&#39;m eating pieces of chicken, by itself, more so with the pasta dishes.  So I avoid it by not getting the chicken or the chicken on the side."

I normally choose from the &#34;Lighter&#34; opitions they have on the menu. The menu has a lot to offer and a first timer can be overwhelmed, especially during the lunch rush. They line you up and funnel you up to the the register where you place your oder then grab a seat. 

On my last visit I had the Turkey Ruben and man it was stuffed with goodness depite coming in around 500 calories. I think you get a very good value for your buck at Jason&#39;s Deli."

Jeff has already been here, that is why we were going because he said he really liked it, and after eating there, I can see why!

Jason&#39;s is located in the new little strip in Naperville, just South of I-88.  There are a bunch of other restaurants in here like Maggiano&#39;s, White Chocolate Grill, Morton&#39;s and a few others.  So it is really the new little strip for the Naperville/Warrenville work lunch crowd.

So the concept here is that you walk in, pick up a menu at the door and wait in line to place your order at the register which will then be brought out by a server.  I got the special which was the Pot Roast Po&#39;Boy, Jeff got the Beefeater which was roast beef with melted provolone on French bread and Missy got the Ranchero Chicken Wrap.  Everything was very good, especially the pot roast on my sandwich, it seriously tasted like it had been cooked for like 10 hours because it was SO tender and juicy!  Missy&#39;s wrap was really tasty, but it was definitely lacking in size...and Jeff and Missy both tried Jeff&#39;s Beefeater and said it was very good.  Oh yeah, I also tried the Broccoli Cheese soup which was SO cheesy and good! =]  The only bad thing was the Italian Pasta Salad which Jeff substituted for chips...it was basically flavorless from every angle!  It was sad...

But needless to say...we will definitely be going back here for their awesome sandwiches! =]"

For those of you who have visited/lived in Los Angeles, Dallas and/or Chicago, a company called Ding Hao owns all these international malls.  They sold Yu Ton Dumpling House this space about twenty plus years ago and have been here ever since.

The first night, I had the spicy beef noodle soup and fried dumplings (potstickers as many Americans call it).  I opted in for the handmade noodles which were definitely fresh.  However, next time I would probably save a dollar and opt for the regular noodles.  The broth is flavorful with a hint of spicy.  Even the beef was amazing.  I loved it all!  The fried dumplings were amazing too!  The auntie who runs the counter is friendly and awesome!  She told me to come back on Saturday so I could try their breakfast.

On the Saturday morning of my flight, I dropped by.  This time I ordered soy bean milk, pork congee, and sticky rice balls.  Everything reminded me of Taiwan and how its been so long since I&#39;ve been back.  Everything had depth of flavor and brought back memories to make a grown man cry.  Ok, I didn&#39;t cry but I definitely got nostalgic.  Come early on Saturdays.  The entire eating area gets packed quickly! Also, this is cash only just like many Asian restaurants/cafes.  I would recommend this place without hesitation.  Extremely affordable for authentic Taiwanese cuisine!"

The spicy beef noodle soup is not too spicy, but the broth is excellent. The noodles are hand made and have the perfect slightly chewy consistency, not slimy, and not mushy. It could use a bit more beef, but it&#39;s a pretty decently sized portion. 

They have the friend dough and soy milk that absolutely makes me nostalgic for lazy mornings in Beijing. 

The red oil dumplings are amazing. They&#39;ve got a nice thick skin/wrap and have a spicy chili oil drizzled over it. 

The crispy pork noodles are good but probably not my favorite dish. It&#39;s a little on the plain side for me."

I had the xiao long bao and the boiled dumplings. I loved the boiled dumplings but the xiao long bao had no juice at all, which basically defeats the purpose of a soup dumpling. The wrapper was way too thick and it ended up tasting the same as the boiled dumpling, just a different shape. However, the real winner at this dumpling house is the youtiao, or the giant sticks of fried dough you see on everyone&#39;s tables. They are gigantic and absolutely delicious. Each one is actually two fused together and they go perfectly dipped in the sweet soy milk. Definitely one of the best reasons to stop by this place at the International Mall!"

I always considered it to be a hidden gem because I didn&#39;t know too many other people who knew about it and, back in the the 90s the majority of the customers seemed to be people from the local Asian community. Today there seems to be a way more diverse customer base. Every time I come here though, it&#39;s super packed and there&#39;s a huge line for Yu Ton. The prices have also been pretty consistenly low over the years and only now have begun to rise a little bit. 

From the outside, it looks like a business building with a bank being the only sign in the window. When you walk in, it pretty much looks like an old run down mall with a food court consisting of 4 or 5 places. I don&#39;t know how all the food vendors are connected, but it seems Yu Ton runs the two spaces farthest on the right. I haven&#39;t tried any other place besides Yu Ton outside of bubble tea and the occasional dessert. 

Food:
They seem to have a lot of authentic Chinese dishes that are really popular with the regulars who come there, but I&#39;ve never tried them. We&#39;ve pretty much been getting the exact same order for the last 20 years: triple seafood soup and fried potstickers. The bowls of soup are huge and the potstickers come 8 to an order. When I look around I typically see people order their own bowl of soup and just share an order of potstickers. I guess my family isn&#39;t like the typical group who dines here. We&#39;re actually the opposite. We share a bowl of soup for the table and each get an order of potstickers haha. Be warned though, the potstickers take a really long time to make, especially when they&#39;re busy, so we&#39;re always prepared for a long wait. 

The triple seafood soup is packed with a bunch of different types of seafood and it comes in a nice, lighter colored broth. The noodles are similar to al dente spaghetti noodles. The potstickers are my favorite. They&#39;re seared crisp on one edge and filled with with pork and chives. The wrapper has a firmer thickness that makes it easy to dip, and the meat inside is just so hot and juicy. I&#39;ve tried a lot of the popular dumpling places in Chinatown in NYC and Chicago, and I still say these are the best I&#39;ve ever had. Bold statement, but it&#39;s true.

Also, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me but for some reason I think there&#39;s something special about their soy sauce. If it was truly just regular Kikkoman wouldn&#39;t they just have a big container of it? Instead it comes in a generic tin container that you can ladle into small cups. I swear there&#39;s crack in it, it&#39;s so damn good with the potstickers haha.

Oh yea, also it&#39;s cash only.

Pro tip: You can actually buy a pack of frozen potstickers, which are the exact same ones they serve. It comes in a pack of 50 for like $20. Not a bad deal at all to be able to fry up some potstickers at home. Been doin this for years and it tastes pretty close, minus the magical soy sauce of course."

This is no hidden gem of exquisite cuisine but it gets the job done at a low price. If you&#39;re choosing between chop suey and a food court, you&#39;re probably better off going to the food court here -- otherwise go to Naperville if you&#39;re looking for classier cuisine. Here are my thoughts on some items:

Sweet bean milk - served nice and hot with a soy flavor that is clear and bold. Good body and just the right thickness.

Baked wheat cake - Multlayer, slightly sweet -- outside could be more crispy but an alright item to complement the soy bean milk.

Twisted cruller - Large, fluffy -- outside could be a bit more crispy but has the right amount of oliness, chewniess, and flavor.

Boiled shrimp and pork dumplings - thicker skin kind of like potstickers, good amount of filling inside although the pork flavor clearly dominates the shrimp flavor. Would go well with noodles but still nothing special -- although with the general lack of good Chinese dumplings in the area (Katy&#39;s is the only other one that comes to mind), this automatically becomes one of the best.

Gets the job done -- filling, quick and cheap but don&#39;t believe reviews that claim that this is a hidden gem."

Most recent visit was in late afternoon and the cruller was only lukewarm, so obviously not fresh out of the fryer. Nonetheless it still tasted good.

The wonton taste weird - it wasn&#39;t the pork and shrimp blend that we are used to eating..the meat was a bit grainy and shrimp was not blended with the pork..they were small shrimps floating on the soup.

Saw some rave reviews about the beef noodle soup and appetizing pictures of their fried dumplings...pretty much pre-determined my mid-afternoon selections. An odd location, set back in the midst of a food court of sorts. Plastic trays, bowls, and Styrofoam plates completed the mini-mall experience. The fried dumplings (aka pot stickers) came eight deep, were served solo, piping hot, made to order, and larger than the run-of-the-mill offerings. While the positives were apparent, they did fall short flavor-wise. Not much seasoning, although I&#39;m not sure how much more could be expected of a typically plain and moreless pedestrian dish.  The over-hyped spicy beef noodle soup was much the same. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it had everything it promised...perfectly cooked noodles, tender chunks of fatty beef, and a spicy broth, but that&#39;s where it seemed to end. Like the dumplings, there was little flavor and the soup hardly knocked any socks off. The overall stop was a love-hate kind of experience. Everything was done right, and that&#39;s great...it just didn&#39;t rise to the exalted four-star rep. A little more kick? bang?... would&#39;ve went a long way."

Yummy, authentic Taiwanese food at a great value. Came here Sat morning with the BF to get a light breakfast but we ended up ordering enough for a family of 4. Yea, we&#39;re fatties like that. 

Per the suggestion of the wonderful aunties that worked there, we ordered two of their popular dishes: beef noodle soup and pork chop noodle soup, both with hand pulled noodles. Of course, we had to try their fried dumplings, sweet bean milk, and fried dough stick as well. The dumpling meat was a little too pink / soup-less for me to fully enjoy but the beef noodle soup was one of the best I&#39;ve had in Chicago and the pork chop was perfectly seasoned and crispy. Sweet bean milk was hot and delicious, just like how grandma used to make it (brownie points for that)!

The philosophy for ordering is to order many dishes in small portions, or just stop by and order a small snack at any odd hour of the day. Taiwanese &#39;snack&#39; dishes, contrary to &#39;orthodox&#39; asian dishes in more official dining settings, can be enjoyed WITHOUT a main rice or starch dish. So they are particularly suitable for hogging out on food when you don&#39;t feel like eating a full meal.

For breakfast, I ordered a rice ball, which is a softball-sized ball of rice that is stuffed with dried pork shavings, quarter of an egg, pickled veggies, and some crispy chip-like things. Think of it as an asian rice-based version of a sandwich. I ordered the salty soy-milk for a drink, which is more like a soy milk based soup, with tofu pieces and crispy salty doughnuts inside. The braised meat combos (placed in plastic containers on the counter) are really nice to either eat in or to take out a whole box on the go. They consist of meat slices, tendons, tofu slices, seaweed, and bamboo sprouts, all braised with special sauces. They especially go well with dumplings, if you want more variety to your dumpling meal.

To be a Villager is to crave and be so satisfied with a $1.95 salted soy bean milk concoction that is essentially what peasants eat when there is nothing better to eat. 

To be a Villager is to drive 30 miles to get this salted bean milk with a side of bland fried dough stick. Total cost is $3.70.

To be a Villager is paying no mind to your villagie food being served in styrofoam ware, plastic spoon and given 2 napkins to feed 4 villagie mouths.

To be a Villager is to not be bothered by the Taiwanese cashier or cook harshly yelling out your order number for pick up in Taiwanese.

To be a Villager is to take 10 minutes to decide what is the better buy for $6.50 - a package of sliced pig ear, soy beef tendons, spicy bamboo shoots, or cold pigs feet?

To be a Villager is to keep coming back to a business that barks at you, accepts only cash, and shuts off the hot water in the washroom sinks.   

To be a Villager is to look around and everyone dining there is either as ugly or uglier than you.

It reopened about a month ago and I have been there 3 times already. I didn&#39;t know how much I liked this foot court until I could not get my traditional Chinese breakfast in a few weeks. 

Most times we are there just for the weekend brunch to get soy milk, You Tiao - Chinese Fried Breadstick, beef noodle soup, and sticky rice wraps which you won&#39;t get anywhere in Chicago suburbs but here. Usually there is a long line to get the order in and then wait for your number to be called. I like they have kept up their quality since the first time I had my first You Tiao here 8 years ago. 

The weekday lunch is a good deal too. With $5.95, you got the meal and a pop. They are super quick to get your meal out.

Please keep in mind that this is not P. F. Chang. It probably should do better with the decoration, serving with better plates (cheap plastic plates now), or making the place cleaner. But with the money you spend on the excellent authentic food, I am willing to overlook those."

Also check out their lunch/dinner items. The yen su ji is heart attack inducing fried heaven. Beef noodle soup has nice handmade noodles, but the broth is just good, not great.

Its inside the international mall that looks like a professional building.  Inside was not that exciting, so I&#39;m thinking it will be either really amazing or really bad.

I went in the mid-afternoon on a weekday, so the dumplings took a little while to appear.  The vegetarian dumplings are steamed, and I prefer fried, but I go with it.  The plate comes with no sauce, and I am a little worried.  I dump some soy sauce in a cup, and go at it.

They don&#39;t need sauce.  You can see the black pepper inside.  So tasty.  I didn&#39;t even use the sauce.  And I went back for some frozen ones for later.

Definitely worth the trip."

After a hard week at work, I really needed some greasy and comforty goodness that is Taiwanese breakfast.

Many of my dining companions (and according to my mother, myself included) came here as kids and feasted to our hearts content. Flash forward to 2013, the feast is not satisfying. 

Soup dumplings (xiao long bao) and veggie dumplings (boiled) were like Kristen Stewart&#39;s acting abilities, bland bland bland. Usually I am incredibly sensitive to salt and avoid dipping things in soy sauce, however this time around I was practically drinking soy sauce with my soup(less) dumplings. Tried my friend&#39;s potstickers, they were marginally better than boiled...but barely. 

Fried stinky tofu was not stinky and like the dumplings that preceded it, was incredibly bland. I did enjoy the pickled veggies that came as a topping, but more on that later. Midwest stinky tofu does not compare to the Stinky Tofu King in Arcadia, CA. That is a creme de la creme of fermented tofu awesomeness. Sigh. 

Beef flapjack was dry and bland like the rest of my lunch. However, I refused to give up on this little guy. I brought it home, reheated it in my toaster oven and stuffed the pickled veggies from the stinky tofu into the sandwich. Now, THAT was tasty! You&#39;re welcome, Yelp world.

Not all of it was so bland though. Their youtiao (fried dough fritter) was on point! Crispy, warm, and somehow not that greasy even though the name translates to &#34;oil stick&#34;. Just like mom makes. And yes, you should dip your youtiao in warmed sweet soy milk. That combo is the business. Their bubble milk tea is also decent.

Service is slow and it&#39;s cash only. And once again my hunt for Taiwanese breakfast continues."

Seriously, the traditional weekend breakfast items are awesome and unique to the area.  You just can&#39;t find all the items in one place.  

If you&#39;re there, get the fresh made soy milk, dunk in your order of yao-tou (fried dough fritters), stuff your face with their dumplings, and enjoy some beef noodle soup.  They now offer handmade or packaged noodles, which I thought was odd, but hey, it&#39;s is what it is.

If you&#39;re expecting service, english, or a clean enviornment, maybe you should opt out of this one.  But if you just want good taiwanese food, go and it&#39;ll be worth it."

You know you have finally found a good place when the place is filled with middle and old chinese people and the line stays packed throughout the hour.

I got the doughstick (fried crueller), sweet soymilk, the salty rice ball and beef noodle soup. The soymilk and doughstick are what im used to. Nothing special, but a comfort food for me. The salty rice ball was exactly how I like it, because they used a fresh doughstick rather than a refried doughstick. They gave half an egg in there which is nice.

But I came for the beef noodle soup and this HAD the flavor I was looking for. It had THE beef and spice flavor that a beef noodle soup is suppose to have. This is the best beef noodle soup I have had in Chicago so far. This is far superior to Katy&#39;s beef noodle soup (I&#39;ve reviewed that it&#39;s just spicy soup with no flavor) But compared to California it is only good.

Bottom line: Come here on the weekends for chinese breakfast fares but definitely try their beef noodle soup and their other dishes."

You basically order at the desk and then wait for your number to be called. You have to pay with cash...

The bowls can be sticky if you order soup noodles. The spicy beef noodle soup is my favorite. The seafood udon is not bad either. I usually come here on weekends to get the best deals. Make sure you get there before 11 if you want the best stinky tofu. And I mean come on a Saturday. The first few batches of stinky tofu is so good that it might make you stand in line for a long time just for another platter. 

My brothers got the taste for their salty rice balls. You can brownie points for speaking their dialect! 

The price is pretty average. They also have a lunch menu and it is not bad. The rice dishes are average as compared to their noodle soup. Definitely give their potstickers a try too. They are delicious. The fried cruellers are crispy and not tough like the ones sold in chicago Chinatown. 

They have a special weekend and holiday menu. Make sure you get a hold of it so you can try the authentic food! Theree are also cold appetizers that are worth a try. They include the spicy pig ears and tea leaves eggs!!"

First, I walk into a dimly lit food court which was somewhat busy.  I looked around immediately for this 4.5 star rated dumpling place all the Yelpers are talking about and find it in the stall to the far right of the building.  

I walk up to is and see no one around.  But the lights in the stall are on. What&#39;s going on?  I look closer at the menu and see a hand written sign that says &#34;order next door&#34;.

What?  Alright - so I order next door.  I ordered the pork dumplings in spicy sauce which took about 15 mins to get.  When I finally got them, I took a bit and realized that the meat was tough.  It&#39;s supposed to be a smooth and juice minced meat.  Instead it was like an italian meatball inside a dumpling skin.

My coworker ordered potstickers from another stall and those were WAY better. I think the stall was called &#34;Good Children&#34; or something like that (maybe they make dumplings out of Bad Children?? lol...)

But what really piqued my interest was the special weekend breakfast that&#39;s printed on the back page of their take out menu.

The weekend breakfast, long elusive, held such treats as sweet soy drink, salty rice ball, chive bun, twisted cruller, and two kinds of congee among other things.  I finally got a chance to check this place out this Sunday and it did not disappoint.  

My dining companion and I had made the trek to the suburbs to have dinner at my grandma&#39;s (review coming soon! :), but this lazy Sunday also afforded the opportunity to have breakfast at the international mall.

The last couple of times I have come to the dumpling house have been weekend evenings, and I have had the pleasure of being the only person in the food court waiting for my steamed buns.  However, the international mall&#39;s the place to be on a Sunday morning, as it was packed.  

We got to the food court and nabbed a paper menu from the counter so we would be ready to order when it was our turn.  There were about 10 people ahead of us, so we had a bit of time.  The menus at the dumpling house, and its sister restaurant, the Chinese Cafe, are pretty big with tons of choices, but we were here with a purpose:  breakfast.  We ordered the pork congee, a twisted cruller, sweet soy drink, a chive bun, and a bowl of the pork and cabbage noodle soup (not on the breakfast menu, but still looked amazing.)  This turned out to be an enormous amount of food for $16.50.

After spying a booth in the back, I waited patiently at the table while my dining companion stood at the front waiting for the food.  After about 10 minutes, he returned with a tray packed with deliciousness.  

The congee, a thick rice porridge was loaded with pork, cruller pieces, and preserved egg, hearty and, with a touch of chili oil, perfect.  The cruller was a sort of long, light and crispy doughnut, but not very sweet.  I had noticed people dipping their cruller in the soy milk, so I did that and it was really tasty.  My dining companion had also noticed that the crullers were fried to order, which probably accounted for the crispness.  The chive bun was large dumpling which was approximately the size and shape of a hot pocket.  It was filled with scallions and vermicelli rice noodles.  

Breakfast here is unlike anything I have ever had. This would be a good place to go with 3 or 4 people so you can try lots of things and have a fun, different meal."

The pork were filled with lots of juice/soup, the chicken were delicately flavored and the veggie were packed with vegetables and the skin was just thick enough to be toothsome but not so thick as to be heavy.

After reading Dee&#39;s review, I found myself on Ogden Ave and pulled into the parking lot in front of the International Mall. Walking in at 11 am the place was empty. I approached the counter with one goal in mind: buy dumplings. 

I scanned the menu for a moment looking for the dumplings. Pork. Pork and Shrimp. Vegetarian. Ah. For 15.99 I bought 50 frozen vegetarian dumplings - that nets out to about .32/dumpling. 

 Dee&#39;s review had me very curious. Would these really be the very best dumplings I&#39;ve had in the US? I&#39;ve worked in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan and have had some pretty good dumplings in my day. I&#39;ve also had some good frozen dumplings from a Taiwanese specialty store near a former residence. How would Yuton stack up?

Arriving home, I threw down my bags and unpacked my dumplings. Quickly heating up my dumpling, I wrung my hands in anticipation. Two minutes later I sat down with the dumplings - unadorned for the first go round, of course. 

The verdict? Delicious. Amazing. Addictive. I heated up a few for Agnes B, who happened to be visiting. She loved them too. They&#39;re flavorful, slightly chewy, with interesting, identifiable filling - a little tree fungus, some cabbage, a few mung bean threads, all intensely flavored.

Since my family moved to the area 20 years ago, my parents almost consistently brought us here for brunch every Saturday (until recently as we kids got older and moved to the city, and the parentals have had busier weekends). The yo-tiao (fried dough cruller) is actually better here than in its native origin of Taiwan (where both my parents are from). We consistently bring our friends who visit from Taiwan here, all who declare after eating it that they&#39;re way better than the ones in Taiwan (always overfried there). How is that possible? Don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s so good. Their beef noodle soup is always good too, as is their pai gu fan (pork steak over rice), and my favorite, their guo tyeh: potstickers. Their potstickers are longer than most in shape, and the pork filling is so good. Their xiao long bao (the steamed pork buns) are pretty good too, but if I eat here, i&#39;m here for the potstickers. The cold tofu/seaweed/egg/beef appetizers they have sitting in plastic containers on the counter are really good too, we get those almost every time to eat with our hot food.

There&#39;s a little strip mall that contains a Chinese restaurant on one side, an oriental store on the other, and right in the middle is a structure that looks like an office building.  When you walk inside, you will find something an oriental food court.  This place has been here for years, and now that most of you know how old I am, let me put it into perspective for you.  I&#39;ve been going to this place since I was 23.  Some of the stalls have changed over the years, but there&#39;s one stall that remains steadfast and true to the food.  That place Yuton Dumpling House.

While the menu is extremely overwhelming, know this...what you order will be made in true Chinese style.  No bastardization of the foods here.  What Yuton Dumplings is known for is their dumplings.  Whether they are boiled or fried, the consistency of their dumplings is what I believe brings everyone back and therefore allows this stall to stay unaffected by economic issues.  I LOVE their fried dumplings.  The prices have been raised (I used to get 8 dumplings for $3), but not by much.  I think they&#39;re $5 now.  But they are still delicious.  Another favorite of mine is the spicy beef soup...lots of beef and lots of noodles.

Now, the place itself looks like a dirty cafeteria.  It really hasn&#39;t changed all these years.  But try to overlook this because you would be missing out on some of the best dumplings I&#39;ve ever had.  They come frozen too, a bag of 50 pieces is $12 the last time I purchase them.  They&#39;re pretty easy to make, but they really don&#39;t taste the same as when you buy them at the stall.  Check it out!!"

My friend and I both had the corned beef on rye. It comes warm but not hot. The meat is very lean and great with just mustard for me. We also each tried the knish. They have 3 types filled with meat, cheese or potato. These were a bit different than what I have had in that the outside was a thin pastry type crust. We tried the meat filled which were very good.

My friend ordered a full-stuffed sandwich but when it came it looked like the same size as mine: half-stuffed. Upon taking it back to the front, they apologized that they read the order wrong. We expected them to just put a little more meat on the side, but instead they went above and beyond and made my friend a whole other sandwich and gave it to him free of charge! He now had a meal there and lunch for tomorrow. This is that good stuff.

Did I mention that they were passing out free candies?!"

On my days off, I&#39;ve started to come up with excuses to run my errands in the vicinity of Schmaltz. Pretty much anything pastrami/corned beef is good, but the one on the hero roll with homemade giardiniera is probably my fave. I also like that you can choose some sandwiches half stuffed if you want to go lighter.  Bonus, if you choose your order for dine-in, you get a giant pickle and these delicious Parmesan bagel chips that you&#39;ll be dreaming about for weeks.

This place gets packed during the lunch rush, but they are very efficient and good at what they do. You&#39;ll always get through the line pretty quickly--and yes, there&#39;s probably going to be a line.

My goal is to come here so much that they know my face and are happy to see me every single time."

I have to say I was really dissappointed.  While the portions were HUGE it just wasn&#39;t very good.  Very messy to eat.  The schmacon was awful, soggy, salty, greasy.

Their bagels are made in house and done the right way, with toppings aplenty on the top and bottom of the bagel. Throw some homemade chive cream cheese in the bagel and some Lavaza coffee (excellent choice by them I must say), and you&#39;re good to go for $3. 

The only negative I&#39;ve seen is that they serve Log Cabin syrup with their challah French toast. Log Cabin is a crime against humanity. But then again, it&#39;s a throw away item for Schmaltz. If you want French toast - which my SO did in fact have - then bring your own syrup. Or tough it up and deal with Log Cabin like my woman did. 

Their sandwiches are crazy big and their soup is great too. Sandwiches come in half size and stuffed. The half size is 2x bigger than normal size at other places. 

Lately my fave has been the corned beef hash and eggs. They griddle the hash crispy and serve it with some scrambled eggs and a potato latke. 

They can be crazy crowded around lunch so call ahead and show up hungry. Cuz you&#39;re gonna be stuffed....like their sandwiches are."

That&#39;s Good&#34; Butterscotch Rootbeer, if they&#39;re open to suggestions), and they could also consider having more 2-packs of Matzo Balls thawed, because last time I was in, they only had 1 2-pack and like 12 8-packs thawed out, but when you buy a half-gallon, you get 4 Matzo Balls.

It was ready to go quickly and the bread was insanely soft, the meat so tasty. The gal said she normally can&#39;t eat an entire sandwich and has to take the other half home, my hotel didn&#39;t have a fridge so I could either allow a tragedy to occur or take one for the team.

I had the #24 which is warm pastrami with lettuce, tomato and blue cheese dressing on an onion roll.  The half stuffed was a good size sandwich for lunch and the meat was the highlight, while the onion roll was very dry.  The bagel chip and huge pickle on the side rounded it out and were both tasty.  I had a side of potato salad and it was fine-probably wouldn&#39;t get it again.

It&#39;s kinda hectic in there and that&#39;s ok.   Part of the reason for my 3 star rating is that I&#39;m not the world&#39;s biggest deli guy and it&#39;d take something pretty unique to wow me with a sandwich place and this is a solid establishment, but not particularly memorable."

Mr. Wife also ordered the Cole Slaw and she had the Reuben.  We did not like the Cole Slaw as I was used to the Cole Slaw in Memphis Tennessee and this one has a strong vinegar taste.

 beef.  I think the meat is steamed, without much in the way of spices, so it did not have the character of smoked BBQ brisket hat we all know.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it wasn&#39;t bad, it was just there, without much character or taste.

I had the New Yorker Corned Beef with Cole Slaw, Israeli Salad, Bagel Chips and a giant pickle. The food was great and portions quite filling. I especially loved the salad. It reminds me of a vinaigrette salsa with cucumber and tomato thar I would make myself.

My husband got the BROOKLYN BEEF, one of the best brisket sandwiches I have ever eaten. The horseradish sauce is a great compliment to this, and doesn&#39;t overpower. He and I traded halves, which was a good thing since half the Big Al and half of the Brooklyn Beef make such a good combo.

The bread on the sandwiches has a very light crust over slightly chewy soft bread...just perfect.

And the baked bread crisps they serve with the sandwiches are fantastic...a real step up from the more traditional chips.  If you like pickles at all, say yes when they ask if you want one....it&#39;s a half of a tasty pickle that is a little lighter on the salt than most.

The MATZO BALL SOUP is worth it too, the best I&#39;ve had anywhere. The broth isn&#39;t too salty, and the matzo ball is melt in your mouth good.

Seriously, this place is amazing, and now is on our short list of places to go when we&#39;re near Naperville. Ordering is a bit regimented, so if you don&#39;t know exactly what you need just hang back well out of the way until you&#39;ve figured it out."

I ordered the Roast Beef on pumpernickel with a horseradish sauce. It was killer. The roast beef was a nice medium rare.

I also got turkey on a pretzel bagel and ate it after it sat in the fridge for a couple of hours. It was really good. The pretzel bagel had a good pretzel taste with the texture of a bagel. They sprinkled some pretzel salt on top. It was a half size, but it was still filling.

The highlight of my meal may have been the potato knish that I wasn&#39;t able to try on my first time there. It&#39;s dissimilar to the deep fried knishes I&#39;ve had in NYC, but it was spectacular. The outside of the knish reminds me of a thin bagel dough, and the inside is an awesomely flavored and textured mashed potatoes -- chunky and seasoned just right.

So I will definitely be updating this after I manage another visit or two.

Schmaltz is a pretty cool deli.  They have a variety of menu items, but on my first visit I chose the Buffalo Dog, as I was on a &#34;must have buffalo flavored anything and everything NOW&#34; kick. I came on a Saturday, a little before 1 p.m. and the line was out the door. So natch, I expected a heavy wait time from order to pick up.  All in all, I only waited a little less than ten minutes, so I was happy.

The food was pretty good. I mean, yeah... I know, I know. I ordered a hot dog when this place is known for its sandwiches. But what tuned me off wasn&#39;t the dog itself, but the amount of bleu cheese applied on top.  While I do enjoy bleu cheese, it MUST be in moderation. Must, must, must (partial lactose intolerance is a bitch; finding out what you can and can&#39;t eat isn&#39;t a fun game to play).  I would have asked for &#34;easy bleu cheese&#34;, but I wasn&#39;t expecting such a liberal application of the stuff.

Luckily, the overzealous employee with the heavy cheese hand didn&#39;t deter me as I was able to pick it off and set it aside. The dog itself was a great tasting all-beef hot dog. The buffalo sauce was a bit light in application but the ranch dressing was perfect. I also ordered a potato pancake, or latke, if you will. That was delicious and I could have made a meal out of a couple of them alone.  

The quality and the quantity of the food justify the pricetag, and I look forward to future visits."

I was awestruck by the $10.59 price tag of the sandwich. I knew it must be worth because on Yelp, many people posted pictures of the iconic &#34;Sloppy Paul&#34;. When I first bit into the sandwich, an explosion went off in my mouth. I&#39;m a firm believer that the sauce they smother in the sandwich was the cause. 

Also tried a can of cream soda. It was overpriced. For a 12 ounce can, the total was $2.23 with tax. But it was worth the taste because all my life, the only creamed soda I tasted was from Dum Dum lollipop&#39;s

On St. Patrick&#39;s day I&#39;d been running around a ton and hadn&#39;t figured out dinner.  It was way too late to pull out some corned beef on my own, sadly. But Schmaltz Deli to the rescue.  Their Smoked Corned Beef and Cabbage Dinner was on point.  It was ready to be taken to go within 5-10 minutes. That surprised me because it was bananas in there.  It includes smoked corned beef, cabbage(obviously), potatoes, carrots and s slice of rye bread, all perfectly prepared as if I&#39;d been slaving over a hot stove all day myself.  Yes.  I&#39;m definitely cheating again next year."

I had the #14 The Sloppy Paul. Warm Rueben with Swiss cheese and sauerkraut!!!  Yes, it was very sloppy!!!  Yum!!!  Got it overstuffed and now I&#39;m overstuffed!!!  Half this sandwich would have been just fine.

It came with bagel chips and a pickle spear, but I added potato salad. It was OK, the only reason I didn&#39;t score this place a 5.

The food is fresh. They have a variety of meats, salads, bakery and specialty items. The portions are large. It is a good thing they have take home containers. They have a pleasant dining area inside and outdoor picnic tables for the warmer weather.
Make sure to take the time to have a good look around before you order. They have a huge amount of options.
Prices are reasonable, especially when you consider you will probably get more than one meal from a sandwich choice.
I have a friend who always gets his corned beef there for St Patty&#39;s Day Reuben&#39;s. He is quite pleased with the quality.
Enjoy!"

First, I have never seen a deli outside of NYC that served Junior&#39;s cheesecake. There is no other cheesecake in the world that even approaches Junior&#39;s. Right there, that&#39;s 4 stars! 

I split two sandwiches, one was the Adams. I&#39;m convinced this was named after me, since my go-to is a pastrami/corned beef with spicy mustard. The meat was plentiful and had a little bit of a smoke flavor. Very moist, great quality. The mustard was fine, a little grainy, but it beat yellow or Dijon mustard by a long shot. The marble rye bread was soft and it was thick so it did not get soggy. My only issue is I would have liked the crust to have a little bit of a crunch on it. Next time, I&#39;ll try the Jewish seeded rye; maybe that will fix the problem. The half sour pickle was large and full of flavor too.

I also tried the Boston Common, roast beef on pumpernickel with horseradish, lettuce, and tomato. the beef was excellent, a perfect medium rare. The horseradish was pretty spicy, it cleared my nose right out! Eat this one slowly!

The service was pretty good. I asked about the price of a mini-cheesecake and it took four people and five minutes to figure it out, but they did. And thumbs up for their store. Junior&#39;s cakes, black and white cookies, breads, their own hot dogs (I bought a pack), Dr. Brown&#39;s soda, BBQ chicken soup, gumbo, just a great variety of stuff to purchase. 

I would definitely return. Next time it&#39;ll be bagels and that hot dog/pastrami combo on the Jewish rye hero roll!"

I have been going here since they opened and have never been disappointed (always 4-5 stars)  til today. My typical order is the over-stuffed wallstreet (corned beef). I really didn&#39;t want a heavy sandwich at 1:30 in the afternoon so I got regular it has always been more then enough when my wife ordered it and looked the same amount of meat as mine.
 I was VERY un-happy, sure not a lot of meat on here... A bit stringy too.  Bread and meat were kinda dry.

All of the sandwiches we ordered were great! The turkey on pretzel bagel, roast beef sandwich, lox and cream cheese bagel, and their version of the reuben were all extremely yummy and a good value for the price! 

One of the sandwiches that we ordered got lost in the hub-bub of the 2 PM Saturday lunch crowd, but the woman behind the counter realized and quickly got us our sandwich in no time flat :-) Definitely worth checking out if you&#39;re in the area.

$12.79 for an (overstuffed sloppy paul) corned beef sandwich is bad enough, but then I get no bagel chips because I got it to go.  Huh?

I&#39;m told by what looked like the owner that the chips are &#34;kinda an incentive to stay&#34;. Even when it&#39;s the same price?  Are you nuts or just greedy?

Seeing the incredulous look on my face, he tells the kid to give me A chip... one chip.  Gee thanks.  If I&#39;d had the time I would have changed the order to stay and packaged it up myself in front of them.

No more.  The food really is not special enough to put up with nonsense like this."

It is a counterservice restaurant, where you place your order, pick up, then go sit on the other side of the restaurant to eat. It also offers a small speciality foods section that includes things like frozen latkes, pita chips, take away Matzo ball soup, pickles, and Junior&#39;s cheesecake! I have never seen Junior&#39;s cheesecake available from anywhere else in the Chicagoland area (but I also never really looked). 

Prices are super reasonable (especially when you redeem the Yelp 10% off check-in offer). We ordered an overstuffed Grammercy Park sandwich (substituted mustard for Russian dressing and had turkey pastrami). It was delicious. Came with pita chips and a pickle. Made it a combo with a side of potato salad and a drink. Husband had a bowl of Matzo Ball soup and a greek salad. The Greek salad was definitely the failure. It was pretty bad. I am chalking it up that you on&#39;t go to a Jewish deli for a Greek salad! Daughter got the turkey sandwich with cookies. We also took a slice of their huge cheese/devil&#39;s food cake. All came in at $32. Which is pretty inexpensive for the amount of food. 

Another Yelper complained about the ladies working behind the counter assembling the sandwiches. That Yelper should have her Yelp Elite badge revoked. It is called a standard operating system. The same system is utilized at Starbucks and other such assembly line places. 

Restaurant is clean. Parking can be difficult during weekday lunch but a spot always opens. Staff is friendly. No complaints."

We both ordered the Wall Street, I got the half (1/2 lb) while my hubby got the whole (1 lb). 

We did dine in so we got the pickles and the bagel chips. I totally understand why only the dine-ins get the chips. It&#39;s a bonus for staying. Our sandwiches were just as we ordered them and tasted wonderful. This is the best corned beef we&#39;ve had since...I don&#39;t know when.

It&#39;s been on my list of possible lunch destinations forever, but it was too far from my office.  Then my office relocated across the street!  My second day in the new office, I headed to Schmaltz!

It&#39;s a lot bigger inside than I expected.  I anticipated this would be a small storefront with a &#34;take it to go&#34; attitude, but that&#39;s not the case.  There are many booths and tables, as well as TVs.  If you eat your meal here, the bagel chips and pickle are included with your meal.  

The Chicken Parmesan sandwich was super stuffed with chicken, marinara, and gooey mozzarella cheese.  I got a few weird, chewy bits of chicken in my sandwich, so I&#39;m not sure I would order this sandwich again.  Aside from that, I really liked it.  

Some of their sandwiches can be ordered &#34;half-stuffed.&#34;  If you check out the photos, Schmaltz&#39;s means business when they make sandwiches.

The bagel chips are so good.  And the pickle spear I got was huge!  With a fountain drink, my meal came to $12, which is a bit steep for lunch.  But the portions are huge, even shareable.  

The sandwich menu is extensive.  There are also chips, soups, and lots and lots of cookies for sale.  I could probably go here every day for a month and try something different.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to get bored with Schmaltz, but it might bankrupt me.  I look forward to coming back and trying the other sandwiches.

Oh, and I don&#39;t know what the hell &#34;schmacon&#34; is, but they advertise it all over their restaurant.  There was a picture of a cow with the word &#34;schmacon&#34; printed across it, so I can only guess it&#39;s some kind of beef-bacon hybrid."

First of all, it was no where near as packed as it was when I came the first time, which was nice. Weekdays are definitely when you want to go. I ordered the &#34;You Dipi&#34; sandwich, which is like a french dip with roast beef. I also added a drink and a side of potato salad for $2.99 more. My mother ordered the hummus and veggie pita with a drink and spinach knish for $3.99 more. The employees at the counter were very helpful and friendly while taking our order.

The ladies that worked the line were still loud and yelling orders back and forth, which is what annoyed me the last time, but I don&#39;t see that changing anytime soon. In fact, they were arguing with one another in front of everyone about not giving names of the customers to match their orders. 

When we got our food, I was not happy with my french dip. It was completely cold. I mean the onions, roast beef, even the bread. Plus, the cheese was not melted (you can see that in the picture I posted). A french dip is supposed to be a hot sandwich, but this was not. I ate some of the first half, and then I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to eat anymore. 

I had to take it up to the counter and ask them to warm it up for me. They told me they would have to make me a new one because they can&#39;t take sandwiches back, and I said forget it, because I really didn&#39;t have the time to wait. One of the girls said, &#34;Well, I guess I could put it in the microwave.&#34; So she did. But when it came out the bread had shrunk, the meat had dried, and the cheese hardened. She put it in for 2 minutes! &#34;Oy vey!&#34;

The potato salad on the other hand was good. Still, not a fan of the bagel chips, I find them to be greasy and stale. My mother absolutely loved her pita sandwich. It looked nice and fresh. She said she would definitely go back just for that. We didn&#39;t get to eat the spinach knish, but I was extremely happy with the size. This thing was huge !We did not expect it to be that big, especially for the price. The knish was a meal in itself.

On the way out, we snagged two black and white cookies. The cashier rang them up for $2.50 each, even though on the menu it says they are $2.29 each. Regardless, they were good. Black and white cookies are my favorite.

I&#39;d like to reach out to Kristin M. (manager) and thank her for giving me the opportunity to try Schmaltz a second time, and update my review. I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t say more positive things, but it was somewhat an improvement from my last visit."

I don&#39;t know much, but I know that you serve some BIG ASS sandwiches! Disclaimer - I&#39;m not personally a big fan of BIG sandwiches. If size mattered, you&#39;d be tops. Unfortunately, environment, attitude and style matter to me as well, so I have to give you four stars.

Yes, your bagel chips are delicious. Yes, you seem to have fun with holidays and the idea of what a Jewish deli should be. Yes, you offered me a free little cookie, which was tasty. And yes, I would re-order the club sandwich if I returned.

Buuuut... your order taking process and delivery isn&#39;t very smooth (I had about two seconds to look at the menu before feeling pressured to just order already, and then had to stand and wait in a main traffic alley for my food). Your staff wasn&#39;t really super friendly to the customers. And your selection of sides and drinks was scattered and unorganized at best. After my visit, I felt that I had little idea about what the deli actually offers and only chose the club because a club is always safe.

So, all of that on top of the fact that none of the finishes in the place felt super high-quality or special, brings us to this four-star rating. Good, with lots of potential, but certainly not perfect yet."

Their cinnamon raisin rugelach is hands down the best I have ever tasted. It is so good I usually buy all they have and bring it home. Getting fat from this pastry from Schmaltz seems to be an okay way to go.

The egg salad sandwich on challah, pastrami, NY dogs are awesome too. Matzo ball soup is nice but I think mine is better. Lol. Seriously. I like my matzo ball a little fluffier.

The tables at times dirty. They didn&#39;t wipe it fast enough. Another strike is the lady in the counter who takes the order. She has this screeching voice and she yells so loud &#34;order in&#34; every time she gets an order to notify the kitchen. But that screeching scream will give me nightmare!

Take out is more desirable for me. At least I won&#39;t have to deal with a dozen nightmare inducing &#34;order in&#34; screams throughout the meal.

One more thing that I don&#39;t approve is serving the piping hot Matzo ball soup in a plastic cup with a lid. That lid was hard to open without shaking the soup and not got hot soup on your hand. You may not get burned, but it is stressful nonetheless. Plus, serving hot stuff in a plastic.. Eeks. 

However, it is still a fantastic classic Jewish deli. Plus, the name is wicked awesome. There&#39;s a certain cool ring to it and having two meanings of a) exaggeration and b) chicken fat, is plain cool. Exaggerated chicken fat is even cooler. Schmaltz!!"

I hoped the corn fritters would be good but I was more weirded out by them than anything. They were little donuts with a random piece of corn. I was expecting more cornbread flavor so my tastebuds were bummed out when they were flour based with a dusting of sugar. Super odd side dish to me.

The fries here are pretty good but the real hit of the meal was the fritters that come with your meal. They are delicious little bites of doughnut heaven.. I might consider coming back for the fritters alone..

In addition to my complaints about the food, the service here is pretty bad. We walked in and said hello to the girl at the register and were greeted with silence.

I went to this location to get chicken for my mother&#39;s birthday. Before leaving, we went online to check the menu and prices so we would know what to purchase. Apon arrival, I noticed their online pricing for this location was cheaper by like 15%!  I up to the counter to place my order and informed the staff of this discrepancy and expected them to match their advertised pricing no problem.

This is not what happened. The manager stated that his boss, the manager of the Romeoville location told him no he could not match price. Despite this it was what she requested specifically, so I ordered anyway.

 I got so stuck on the pricing difference, I didn&#39;t notice that they rung me up for 5 EIGHT piece dinners instead of the 5 FOUR piece dinners I requested. By the time I noticed, I was on the way out the door with 40 PCs of chicken instead of 20 @ a cost of $94.00!!! When turned around, and told them that I requested the 4 piece dinners not the 8 piece, he shrugged his shoulders and was like &#34;Not much I can do about it now&#34;

My family has a tradition that we have carried on for years where we eat both Mother&#39;s Day &amp; Easter @ the main restaurant on Joliet Rd, but after this disaster order with NO attempt to aid the situation, I think unless I am reached out to, they may have lost TWO separate dinner parties of 25+ people on two separate holidays. Not to mention the social media outlets I am going to copy and past this exact review on.

It is ridiculous to tell me as your customer, Google won&#39;t update YOUR website..... And then tell me you can&#39;t even match your PUBLICLY ADVERTISED PRICING on top of it when I asked for four piece dinners sell me 8 piece ones by saying farm hand pak instead of 8 piece and screw me out of even more money. 

For the record, the food was DELICIOUS. It always is. But anyone who reads this should bring the pricing from their website in, and DEMAND they match price."

YEAH SUCKAAAAAS! It&#39;s dat good. I&#39;ll rewrite Moby Dick, except I&#39;ll be in search of the biggest chicken for WFF to fry. 

It&#39;s simple people. Get a bucket, I prefer all dark meat. White meat is all too often dry (from anywhere) and chewy. Have your favorite hot sauce nearby (Louisiana or franks), a big ol&#39; bag of corn fritters, a side of slaw (yes, you may need to chill it), and another big ol&#39; bag fries. 

Their chicken is not overly breaded, yet nicely crispy, and very juicy. The frys are excellent, which I was originally unexpected. The corn fritters are awesome, something I&#39;m always looking forward to getting. Their coleslaw has a little extra vinegar and maybe some sugar to balance it all out. Works out perfectly when you&#39;ve got a mouth full of food. 

WWF is the best fried chicken we can get out here. Stop delaying, try it, then try it again, then figure out how you can sell your house to live closer. Then start working there. Then open up your own. Then, and only then, is your life complete."

Before I went, I checked Yelp and the comments were full of high praise--so I was stoked! I knew that I was going to get some delish fried chicken at a place that isn&#39;t too far from home... I ended up being pretty disappointed, though. The worst part is that the chicken has unrealized potential. Take the crust on the chicken, for example. It&#39;s super crispy--almost tempura like--and would be really good if it had about 2 teaspoons of seasoning. Any seasoning will do. The chicken just had no flavor. Zero. None. They took the chicken, dipped it in the batter, and fried it. It&#39;s nothing like traditional southern fried chicken, and maybe it was my fault for having the expectation that it would be. The fries were decent, but you better eat while they&#39;re pipin&#39; hot. The mashed potatoes are straight out of the box and I&#39;m sure the gravy came in a packet with directions to &#34;add water and stir until thickened&#34;. And the corn fritters--I was so hopeful, especially after reading all the comments on Yelp. But they were mediocre and tasted like they&#39;d been warmed in the microwave. You know that reheated chewiness that cornmeal/cornbread can get sometimes... So it&#39;s a no-go for WFF unless I&#39;m desperate and it&#39;s the only place open. The food is edible and the chicken is cooked fresh, so that&#39;s a point for them."

You know those fried chicken commercials where the chicken pieces look more perfect than perfect, but when you bring it home yourself, the pieces look worse for wear?

There were a few other tables scattered, but they placed our group in the back so we&#39;d have some privacy. I wasn&#39;t drinking so I can&#39;t vouch for their drinks or beer, but their cheese pizza was pleasantly surprising! I ended up eating more than I care to admit. Bonus: On Sundays, their food special is $10 cheese pizzas! I also ended up getting the nachos later on, which were FULLY loaded and only $10. Definitely a great value. My boyfriend and I barely made a dent in them. Also on special were $15 beer towers. Service was great and TVs were plentiful. I&#39;d recommend this place!"

I really wanted to like it but everyone in my group hated the experience. I was under the impression it was a sports bar. Sports memorabilia everywhere, huge flat screen TVs, pool tables and everything else yet on football Sundays they don&#39;t play the sound on the football games. Instead, I had to listen to Justin Bieber playing on the Jukebox. Makes sense. 

On to the food...
I had a group of 5 and we ordered appetizers and a pizza. Our appetizers came out fairly quickly and were tasty. Our pizza literally took an hour and a half to come out. After 40 minutes we flagged down the waitress and asked her about the pizza. She said oh yeah, your sausage pizza I&#39;ll check on that. We said no, the pepperoni we ordered. She said oh yeah, that&#39;s what I meant. Never a sorry or anything. 40 minutes after that it came out and looked like a frozen tombstone pizza. We all sat there and looked at it like seriously, this is what we waited an hour and a half for? 

On to the beer...
When we got to the bar we all sat down at a table and ordered a table tapper. After 15 minutes of not seeing the waitress again we finally saw her and asked her where our beer was. She said oh yeah, they&#39;re changing the keg. 15 minutes later we finally got it. Apparently takes that long for them to change a keg. 

This place just sucks. Service is horrible, food is bad. We were a table of 5. 4 of whom are in the restaurant industry and are usually forgiving with some things but this was just bad.

To top it off, waitress did not apologize one time about the 30 minute wait for beer or hour and a half wait for frozen pizza. 

Take your business elsewhere."

I made the mistake of thinking because they had a $10 large pizza offer from 10pm to 12am the kitchen would be open.  The 160 TV&#39;s is crazy but not really a big deal.  As it&#39;s a really large area. (bar, video poker room, 2 patios, OTB area with another bar and the large pool and dining area.) Some of those TV&#39;s are dedicated to the OTB (off track betting) part of this place. 

I take it on game nights and weekends this place is packed but wasn&#39;t so when I got in. So slow my waiter was playing darts with a few co workers in the inside patio behind the main bar.

Lots of option for drafts/bottles and wine. Pizza was okay. I was asked did I want thin crust pizza but didn&#39;t taste thin at all. Pizza wasn&#39;t the &#34;worst&#34; but I wouldn&#39;t order it again. The bar food is what I was looking to try out. Speaking to my waiter she mentioned the panini sandwich&#39;s is usually what she eats the most here but do enjoy the wings as well. 

From a guy prospective it really is a nice chil and hang out spot to come to and will visit again just hope the bar food items are much better than the pizza I had."

There were two birthday parties going on as well, that took up most of the area, and no one appeared to be watching any of that,  The  one &#34;manager&#34; did turn on one large screen and two much smaller screens that were a minimum of 15 feet away. There were no TV&#39;s tuned to the game in the bar, even though, like the dining room, there was a great number of  people wearing Hawks gear. Just as the game started, they switched off the audio portion and went back to the UFC/   Highly disappointed  as  we have gone to Crazy Pour several times in the past to eat and catch the game.

Our usual bar that we go to didn&#39;t have any free table for the Blackhawks game, so we came here instead. We were seated right away (it&#39;s a big place with plenty of seats), and immediately noticed how many beers they had and a wide food selection. They had a $3 special for any of the beer drafts, which is in same cases a steal for a bar. The service was pretty decent all night, it was very busy so not perfect, but understandable. They have a lot of TVs and big screens throughout the whole bar, so you can see a game from pretty much any angle. 

As far as food goes, we ordered the pretzel bites, which were good. I eventually ordered the pulled pork sandwich. It was good, I wish there was a little more sauce, but still a good sandwich. The only other complaint I have is the cushions in the booths are not very comfortable - you sink into the seat way too much. Both my friend and I agreed, so we switched to a table which was better.

The manager talked to us about 3 times and made sure everything went well and that we were happy. I saw him making rounds throughout the night. That was impressive to me, you don&#39;t see that everywhere."

When we saw our server we asked if we could or drinks. She was very rude and instead of taking our order she asked..&#34;HOW DID YOU GUYS GET HERE&#34; next was the hostess Olivia slamming  menus on the table and waving a list. 
We finally got our drinks and the server give us the check at the same time. SO RUDE.. you would think we would order more drinks?? So we ask for the manager.. we get a guy stating he is the owner.. Ops so we explain that this is our first visit and the rude service we got. All he said is ill take care of the drinks. Really?? What about the poor service?  We left our drinks and walked out.

We arrived around 5:30 on a Thursday night and the place was pretty busy by the bar. We were greated by Michelle and she was great, she ended up being our waitress. She went over all the specials and told us that we had about 20 minutes to order something for Happy Hour. She even let us try some samples of beer before ordering them. Her service was very good, very friendly, attentive and just over all made the experience what is was. Very good!
I ordered the Thursday Burger special for $6, burgers came on a pretzel bun, and I didn&#39;t want the fries, so I was able to substitute a side salad, and that was filling in itself.
At the end of our meal, we took a quick survey and were given a $5 off our next visit. 
I live in Villa Park and it took me almost the entire 2 years they have been open to come here. I will definitely be back! This place was good for a group, drink night, or any Chicago Bears or Hawks Game!

We then placed our dinner order which came out fairly quick. My partner ordered the Blackened Tilapia and I had the Chicken Panini w/ Fries (the special of the day). Food was fairly good, however a bit under-seasoned for both entrees. I had to add the hot sauce to my panini to take away the bland flavor. Our waitress Michelle was amazing!

We ordered the nachos app to start, which was loaded with meat, cheese, beans, and had sour cream/guac on the side. The chips were super fried and had a little bit of a donut aftertaste due to the frying, so I didn&#39;t like those as much. The flavor of the toppings was awesome though, with quality ingredients.

I also like the fact that they had a dj there playing  some of my favorite old school songs.

They have a game room with slot machine access at any time and people actually rotate so you really are not standing around waiting for a machine to open up. 

I really like the the crowd they have there it&#39;s a fun atmosphere with a large banquet  area I seen when I got lost going go the bathroom,which I have to say they keep really clean being a guys kind of place.  

The food selection is perfect  for that venue. Parking is all over this us definitely a place to chill out with friends or family.  I&#39;m for sure going to be returning top this venue."

You guys have a great selection of beer and the food is very good. You have an entire room dedicated to slots and an entire room for horse gambling and an entire room for private parties. The main area is all voluted ceilings with brand new arcade games, pool table and darts! This is what I call an any age bar. Unfortunately your dominant customers are the bikers and the gamblers but I&#39;m sure in time the crowd will diversify, I hope lol. One thing I don&#39;t like though is you only have female bartenders. The new hire is also female but at least she&#39;s not caucasian. Firm believer in diversity, especially when I&#39;m at the bar. Ps upon going my second time aka last week, the bartender remembered my name. Props!

Food-wise I would recommend the Crazy Pour Burger. We&#39;re talking crispy slices of bacon stacked on an over-medium fried egg a-top of a thick juicy patty prepped to your liking. By the time you finish this monster (along-side with the fries that accompany it) you feel like you&#39;ve been feasting for days. My girl says the hot-wings are phenomenal, and if you&#39;re in the sharing mood...order the giant pretzel..its obnoxiously big.

Drinks are great. The Hard Rootbeer is my personal fav. But if you&#39;re a snob for craft beers, then you&#39;ve probably died and gone to heaven coming here. Drinks and food are reasonably priced. 

Atmosphere is clean, staff is friendly and the crowd seems pretty mixed in terms of age &amp; race, so you get a pretty good social variety here. They have a Live DJ on the weekends and a gaming room with slot machines for those individuals who like to dance with lady luck. Overall, a great place that won&#39;t disappoint. When this place packs up...it comes alive quickly."
crazy-pour-villa-park,Roseanne S.,lg1UvP-7KLtjSdxbFbt3Aw,"Villa Park, IL",1,1,0,92,116,Glfxg1_6SNpfvW3BnYFokw,3.0,2014-01-24,"Let&#39;s call this a 3.5 star place. I was reading the Daily Herald and saw that one of their writers did a write-up on Crazy Pour, which is what first alerted me to this place even existing. Apparently it opened in September, but seeing as there isn&#39;t much on North Ave, I never saw it. Actually, you might miss it as you drive down North Ave. It&#39;s right next door to AutoZone, FYI.

My bf and I were looking for a place to watch the NFL conference finals and decided to check this place out. If you&#39;re looking for a Blackhawks bar, this would definitely be the place to be. We walked in just as the Hawks scored a goal, and off goes the foghorn, which scared the crap out of me. It&#39;s super loud, but I guess that means they do a good job of making you feel like you&#39;re at the game without having to sell your soul for tickets. There are tons of TVs and projection screens. Everywhere you turn, you&#39;ll catch the game. THey also have a sports ticker behind the bar, which is cool. No more squinting to see the bottom line on ESPN!

This isn&#39;t just a hole in the wall sports bar, though. It&#39;s pretty nice on the inside, though I could do without the pick-up lines WordArt in the bathroom (&#34;Was it love at first sight or should I walk by again.&#34; Really?). They don&#39;t have a ton in terms of food. They have pizzas which looked pretty good judging by the people we saw who ordered it, and the burgers sounded good too. We both went for a panini and ordered some beer. They need to update that beer list, though, because every time we asked for a beer, they didn&#39;t have it. We had to keep looking back at the tap handles to figure out what to get.

Our food took a while to get to us, which was surprising considering there weren&#39;t many people there. I didn&#39;t mind too much since we were watching the game and having a beer, but I was hungry, so it was a bit noticeable. I wasn&#39;t too impressed with the food. They really shouldn&#39;t call it a panini. It was more of a hot sandwich. I&#39;m not a sandwich snob by any means, but I do frequent Panera and I watch a lot of Chopped, so I know what the frick a panini is and this was not it. It was grilled cheese with bacon. And in fact, I could probably make a better one at home. The fries were meh. I would prefer fresh cut. 

Food aside, the atmosphere here is cool and great for a game. They also have off track betting and a video gambling room off to the side. I&#39;ll probably be back when I&#39;m in the mood to watch a game, but I&#39;ll definitely be trying something other than the &#34;panini&#34; and I hope they update their beer list by then."

I can&#39;t comment on the venue during game time, but every time I&#39;ve been here, I&#39;ve never been disappointed.  The nachos are great, but my fav has to be the stuffed clams...so much flavor, and ask for extra bread to sop up the deeeelicious sauce!  Hard to believe they exist in Villa Park, and it&#39;s not the easiest to get to...but well worth it!"

It was a second wedding for both of us, and we wanted a place that had all types of things for our guests to do while they attended.  They have 2 pool tables in the main bar area, as well as darts.  And, it was so hot on the day of our party, that they even brought a bags game in the room for our guests to play.

This place was way more than I would have ever expected, as it is advertised as a bar, with an OTB attached.  They have a nice banquet type room in the back, which has its own bar in it.  We had 50 guests, and had more than enough room, and an open bar.  We had never even ate at this place before our party, but the food was awesome as well. 

They were very accommodating with the menu, the open bar, and the prices.  They worked with me on the menu, as I am picky, and wanted to have enough of a variety to make everyone happy.  Sean the manager was great, and very involved.  He was very helpful and understanding, every time we stopped in with our million and one questions.  He was there during our entire event, and was bussing the tables himself.  Even the owner stopped in a few times, to make sure that everything ran smooth.  The bartender was great too.  She was super friendly, and was patient enough to deal with my family that liked to flirt.

I would recommend this to anyone for any event!"

There is a cute outdoor area which a fireplace which they turned on (It&#39;s gas) just for my chilled self. The waitress was nice, but kind of clueless when it came to drinks. She did not know what some drinks were (&#34;straight up&#34; confused her) and liquors stumped her as well (Campari, ftw) Basically, this is not a place to experiment with new drinks. Stick to your old favorites and you&#39;ll be fine.

One the menu for us that night was: 
-Southwest Eggrolls - I&#39;m addicted to these. Anywhere I can order them, I do, and they always make me want another dozen orders of them #hungrygirlproblems
-Baked Clams- Our waitress forgot we ordered these, I think. They took more than a half hour to arrive! I wasn&#39;t impressed, as the &#34;baked&#34; portion covered the clams themselves, but the topping was soggy as a car wash sponge. Pass!
-WINGS. yum. serious. Get these. The hot sauce was perfect, not too painful but still acceptable for the fire-breathing dragon I was with. 

Good place for appetizers, people watching, and wings. I&#39;d head back if I was in need of a buffalo fix."

As an official Blackhawks bar, the siren thing is LOUD so be ye warned and cover your ears if you are sensitive to loud noises in enclosed areas when the Hawks score. Crazy Pour is therefore ideal for watching hockey but also a good place as a social gathering for friends. Hopefully they do this also for Da Bears during football season, too.

Immediately upon being seated indoors (we did not go out on the patio because it was raining and we wanted to watch the Hawks game), we were greeted by a friendly and vivacious server who suggested that we try the Arancini. Despite our server and us both agreeing that they were a wee bit skimpy on the VERY tasty vodka sauce, it was excellent nevertheless. After gobbling that down rather quickly, we then chose to order the jumbo nachos, which were fully loaded with quality ingredients but quite spicy even by my own standards (I love spicy food). They also have the &#39;Not Your Dad&#39;s Root Beer&#39; beer, which I love. It tastes just like root beer and yet is a whopping 20% abv! Better yet, a pint only costs $6 there! The beer is moderately-priced and the atmosphere of this place is sporty. The location is a good but not great one. I do not think it is a good place for kids, either.

Additionally, it should be noted that Crazy Pour also has off-track betting, slot machines, a great selection of libations, cheap wings, an outdoor patio, myriad screens for watching all sorts of sports and other things on TV, and billiards tables. 

Ultimately, I give this place 5 stars because of the management/ownership of Crazy Pour. On Yelp we bought a $10 for $20 worth of food voucher. After dining, we were $4 short of meeting the $20 minimum purchase requirement with our food so, even though we were full, we were going to order an additional food item. Before we could do so, the owner Tiz came over to our table personally and generously honored the promotion anyway. I wish more establishments had that kind of accommodating customer service and they should strongly consider doing so, too, because it will invariably lead to more positive buzz on social media and more 5 star reviews on Yelp which means a win-win situation is created for everybody involved."

They have a very good selection of craft beer, including (the evening I was there) Bourbon County Stout and Smalltown Rootbeer (17.5 version).  This was a pizza place before, but they have completely redone the inside and it is quite nice.  They do OTB and some gambling machines - not my thing - but it is a big draw for some people.

The hostess with no personality sat us at a high top where we waited ten minutes for our waitress who finally came and said &#34;oh I didn&#39;t know you were here&#34; said.  Ughhh not a good sign. We ordered the baked clams and a jack and a mixed drink. Baked clams came out and they were so gross and mushy. Ordered our steak tacos and a wrap. They were both terrible. Steak was fatty and the wrap was simply terrible. Our waitress had no personality what so ever.  Big disappointment and will never recommend it to friends.

Let me begin by saying that I love to go out and watch hockey and cheer on the Blackhawks with the rest of the fans. I love the roar of the crowd and the lights and horn every time they score. However the horn at this place is terrifying! It makes your hair move and your skin vibrate. I watched one guy duck down the first time it went off because he thought he was in an attack.  

Next was the service. The girl was awkward, brought us more drinks when we didn&#39;t want any more and couldn&#39;t be found when we wanted to leave.

Finally was the music volume. I&#39;m not an 80 year old grandma, and can hear just fine. Before the Hawks game began, my friends and I were there to enjoy some apps and drinks (at 7pm) and the music was so loud we couldn&#39;t hold a conversation across the table. To make it even better, the cranked it up louder!

To round out my review, this place received the 2 stars that it did because the food quality and options were decent, along with the decor."

They have a very affordable and delicious menu. If you stop in order the arancini, it&#39;s fantastic. To add to the great food, they have a pretty nice beer selection. Their bartenders are always kind and sincere, and that is something that you tend to have a hard time coming across. To add to it all they have large flat screens everywhere so you can catch the current game or watch the races. I personally enjoy reading all the hilarious names of the horses, but hey, we are all there for our own reasons... I would highly recommend this place, seriously. GO THERE!"

Big and clean, lots of options for beer drinkers, spirit selection looked good too.  Food is standard fried pup grub, nothing special but not bad either.  Prices were fair and service was good (although they struggled to honor my Yelp/Groupon deal).  Lots of TVs and an outdoor smoking area, looked like they had a couple pool tables as well...

They are a class act with a fabulous understanding of the hospitality industry!. And...the bar is awesome. Almost fifty taps, great food, and magnificent service. This place may be attached/a part of the OTB but I would easily belly up here for just a cocktail and ball game, I wouldn&#39;t even have to want to bet the ponies to hammer a pint or two. Not only will I be back, but I will be setting up a neighborhood event here where we get a couple of those table top beer taps, each pitch in a few bucks, and randomly pick great name horses for nice afternoon.

I was impressed walking in by the decor and layout. Then it went all downhill from there. 1. It was empty, and I mean empty we were the only two people. It was 7pm on a Sunday. The staff just hanging out around the bar. 2. We ordered our drinks and they came out just tasting like soda water, but after the third attempt in getting a simple tonic and ice ordered they asked us to order something else. Really, tonic was too difficult!!! This just made us more nervous on the food. 3. We ordered Jumbo Chicken Nachos as an appetizer and we both ordered separate sandwiches as our entrees. We waited and waited for our appetizer to arrive, and we patiently waited over a few games of darts. Then all of a sudden all of our food came at once Nachos and sandwiches. How are we going to eat nachos and our main entrees at once before each of them get cold. I ordered a grilled chicken panini and out came a grilled chicken wrap. My friend ordered a regular burger cooked medium and out came a well done cooked burger. I am not sure who is to blame here, mangers, chefs, or the waitress. But Damn we were the only two people there and they couldn&#39;t get our orders correct. We told the waitress about the faults in all of  our orders but only to get comped on the nachos and a round of drinks, which is nice of her, but I feel like the manger should have taken initiative and done better. Regardless we left early and hungry and unsatisfied paying for food we didn&#39;t even eat.

Be skeptical of this place. I won&#39;t be coming back here again."

Atleast for college sports. They played UFC on every single tv when a bunch of college football games were on including northwestern vs notre dame which I thought was a big deal around here. We asked them to switch to one of the games on ONE tv and they did, but then later got switched back. So every tv had the same thing on at once. It was annoying that we had to keep asking so eventually decided to leave and go somewhere else with football on.

The prices are pretty reasonable and portions are good as well. What I liked best was the environment. This place is HUGE on the inside (despite looking small on the outside)and there are TVs everywhere, along with huge private rooms if you want. PPV events and NFL Sunday ticket are here so it&#39;s great if you wanna watch sports. Games and pool tables also, with tons of space. We got a booth and it was cloth cushioned and really comfy. Service was very good, our waitress was very friendly and a perfect balance of being attentive without being a bother. Clean bathrooms too.

For starters we got cheese curds and breaded mushrooms. They were good, the cheese curds being the more impressive. Also, we got a spinach salad which was ridiculously huge. Cutting it was a part-time job.

For my meal I got the Crazy Pour burger(bacon, egg, and cheese)and fries, bun was different, but it was slightly above average. Fries are nothing to get excited about but are good. My wife got an egg bacon and cheese panini and  she rated it a 7/10.

Also, rumor has it this place has amazing thin crust pizza.

Fun place, looks new, used a $40 yelp voucher (cost $25, which is why we got so much food).

We had high hopes for the sportsbar/restaurant.   Yesterday we went to watch the bears game at noon.   My husband noticed it first but the bar was sticky and just looking at it, it looked un-clean.    We were then given 2 menus in which the menus were filthy and sticky also.    They are known for their beer pitchers that sit on table top and have a spout like a keg.   Cute idea but we looked at every one of them and fingerprints were everywhere, just looked un clean.    Even looking at the windows going into the kitchen, you have to think who cleans this place.   Kinda put us off.     Bartender not only tended the bar but worked the first row of tables, where we moved to because of the condition of the bar.     Needless to say, service lacked because the bartender should be working the bar and getting the waitresses drinks for their tables, she shouldn&#39;t be a waitress also.    Lastly, we were sitting there watching the Bears do an awful job and I have to say started rooting for Miami (lol) and this big burley man from the bar turned around and confronted us in a mean and bullying manner.    The last we checked this was a sportsbar and a free country.    He kept taunting us for the first half of the game and actually threatened us.   Well, we felt very uncomfortable and asked for our check.   We did let the bartender/waitress know about this patron.   She did go discuss with owners.   I didn&#39;t expect the owners to kick him out but knowing the types of patrons that hang at this establishment, I won&#39;t be back and I would not recommend to anyone else.    The unclean feeling of the establishment and the unclean feeling of the patrons seem to equal a place I don&#39;t want to go."

Hummus, Tabouleh, Falafel, and almost every other kind of Arabic food, drink, and ingredient native to Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Iraq, and the rest of the Arab world suddenly becomes &#34;Israeli&#34; without any acknowledgement of its true origins.

How exactly is falafel, which existed long before &#34;Israel&#34; a &#34;signifier of Israeli pride&#34; unless one is proud of cultural theft?

In a refreshing moment of honesty, Gil Hovav admits:  &#34;Of course Hummus is Arabic.  Falafel, our national dish, our national Israeli dish, is completely Arabic and this salad that we call an Israeli Salad, actually it&#39;s an Arab salad, Palestinian salad. So, we sort of robbed them of everything.&#34;

I opt for no spread in the pita.  I tried the hummus and the baba ghanosh.  Totally not a fan of the baba ghanosh.  It&#39;s an eggplant spread but it&#39;s not flavorful.  To me it masked the yummy flavor of the chicken. Just keep it plain: meat and bread.

Good basmati rice and the naf naf fries are okay. They were kind of burnt.  Still, I like this place. It&#39;s new and clean. Will be back again."

This branch is a new concept that differs compared to the original, in that it&#39;s like Chipotle, where you get to pick and choose assembly style. This actually works better if you are a picky eater and also exposes more of the ingredients that go into your meal. It&#39;s able to show actually how much variety that Naf Naf offers. At the other location, you just place your order and wait. and wait. and wait.

I have to say in this regard this concept is significantly better as you only wait until your meal is complete.

Some notes:
- They don&#39;t offer the beef tenderloin here from the other location
- Instead they were advertising lamb+beef kifta
- They serve rice, hummus, or couscous bowls, ala Chipotle style

In light of this, I tried a kifta rice bowl. Toppings included salad, cabbage, onions and the various hot/fire/tahini/garlic sauces.

I thought this combination was rather tasty and flavorful. The mix absorbed the flavors well and the rice vehicle was a good transport for the meat and vegetables. I have had kifta at a few other middle eastern restaurants, and only one has been outstanding. This was almost as good, but it was definitely tender and broke apart easily. As always a freshly made pita bread was provided and was of high quality.

Overall, I would come back again. Would like to see the beef tenderloin make an re-appearance, because I know my wife loves that and missed it here. I think the concept works and makes Naf Naf more approachable."

When I walked in, there was a cooler full of different dips, like hummus, as well as pre made salads for a quick pick up instead of waiting in line. I had the chicken shawarma bowl. The chicken was delicious. The rice, just meh, some crunchy grains and some soft ones. I added all of the available options and had a nice bowl of food. I also got extra hummus on the side so I could eat it with my pita, and put some in my bowl.
I decided to sit outside at one of the tables because it was such a lovely day. I ate the majority of my bowl minus the rice. The hummus was delicious. The pita was warm and fluffy, although not the best. Just adding in my two cents for the battle of the better pita.
The service was pretty fast. The place was very clean. The price was a little on the higher side but ok, that I can deal with. But the rice, they gotta do something about the rice. Total turn off...."

Food provided in OakBrook served up skimpy portions and I suppose due to the fact that the meat is precut sitting in steel tubs kinda like you&#39;d see at Subway the sandwich we dined in with was barely warm.    Also could be that they hold your sandwich open while you determine the toppings you want to ad.    at the other locations the toppings are pre determined, it&#39;s pretty hot and portion of meat to toppings is a generous 65/35 when  OakBrook serves up if you are lucky 45 / 55 .

Naf Naf brings the subway model to Middle Eastern cuisine, but in a much better way. Ingredients taste fresh, the pita is made mere minutes before you eat it, and the variety of dishes is perfect. I started going to this location the week it opened (it&#39;s near my work), and have come at least 10 times since. Unlike the original Naf Naf, there are no platter dishes and no extra pickles to help yourself to. The prices are also a little on the higher side for a lunch (with fries and drink, you&#39;re looking around $12 for lunch). It&#39;s clear the employees were trained to be very sparing in ingredients, as asking for things like extra pickles or onions will get you an additional slice or two from the already-too-small starting place. In the end though, Naf Naf is still a great, quick, and healtier-than-most-fast-lunch-spots meal made by typically friendly employees. I will come back many more times. With the help yourself pickles and platter meals, I&#39;d move my review to a solid 5. Recommend."

For slightly more than $6 for the sandwich, it was a good value. And if you&#39;re under the weather with a cold, flu or sinus infection, you should ask for your sandwich to be liberally dressed with their spicy hot red sauce. It&#39;s a very pleasant way to drain the sinuses!

It isn&#39;t exactly easy to find a great deli in the Chicago suburbs. So when I heard this place was opening in my hometown, I knew I had to try it. 

And the old school crooners music definitely helps set a nice mood when you walk in. The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating as we engaged in conversation about the East Coast and our Italian roots. They have a little mini mart where you can buy meals to go, including soups, chicken parmesan, and desserts. I&#39;m also very happy that they have pizzelle waffle cookies. 

I ordered the rice ball with ground beef, beef, and peas. First of all, I must say the marinara sauce was amazing. It was very light and very flavorful. And the coating on the outside was crispy, but it definitely wasn&#39;t overdone. Even though I&#39;m not a big fan of peas, I liked this.

Then I tried the Romano sandwich, which is their version of an Italian sub. Salami, capicola, portabella, provolone, lettuce, tomatoes, and a very strong vinaigrette. I also added some giardiniera, which was free. The relish was mostly olives, it didn&#39;t really add anything. The sandwich was ok, but it came on regular soft French bread. And it was just boring bread, it added nothing at all. I would not order this sandwich again.

I live in Little Italy on Miller for a few years and mapped out every sandwich joint in the area and to me Fontanos on Polk crushes the competition.

I also want to preface my review on the fact that I lived in Europe for a quite a few years and still go to Italy yearly to enjoy some of the best panino delivered next to the motorways.

I decided to order one cold sandwich and one hot sandwich to try and get a variety of what&#39;s possible. I went with the Romano sandwich and a chicken parmesan.

To me all sandwiches should be centered in flavor around the fillings (meat and cheese). My cold sandwich centered around the strong vinaigrette dressing. Also, the bread is boring american knockoff of a french style baguette that has no character. The meat choices with ok and the cheese was fine....neither were outstanding and gave me the feeling that they were really good and made me look forward to taking another bite. 

My hot sandwich was meh at best. The chicken was bland and I was very unimpressed with the gravy. While the tomatoes tasted ok the sauce itself was quite bland and had no flavor. 

Both sandwiches were $5.95 which I think is a decent price, but I would have no problem paying a little more and getting higher quality ingredients and something with robust flavor. Also, the chips are now $.50 a bag which is also a fine price.

If you would like water they only allow for purchase of bottled water, juices and soda. I noticed that they have a coffee bar and I always interested in a wonderful espresso macchiato as a way to finish my meal, but I looked at the beans and they were brown and quite dry.

All in all....would I go back.....I think maybe for one more try to try an entree just to validate if my initial impressions were correct. While the quantity of food received is high and the pricing is low I would have no problem for equal or increased prices and higher quality."

They have a few &#34;take and bake&#34; items (which I&#39;ll probably go grab tomorrow!) and then their deli items. The focaccia bread looked so good, I should have gotten one. And their Nutella is cheaper than Meijer-score! 

Both employees were friendly and accommodating. Can&#39;t  want to go back! 

UPDATE-totally not ashamed that I went back the next day. I got the take and bake cheese lasagna, which was absolutely perfect. The focaccia was the best. I planned on saving some for my husband but I ate it all. So.good. I also got one of their house salads. It was super fresh, tons of cheese, walnuts and cranberries. I really enjoyed it all!!"

This is one of those places that where anything you try you absolutely love. I take home their sauces and mix them....their Alfredo mixed with their pesto or their meatsauce is heavenly. Can&#39;t wait til they expand to serving full service dinner in the spring. Promise you will be hooked on this place once you try it. 

However my favorite story is this: We moved from Southern California recently and I miss the pizza from a chain called BJ Brew House . I found to my delight that Romanos has tomato focaccia bread that tastes just like their crust. So I started  buying the little focaccia  and a pound of their crazy good shredded mozzarella to go home to make my own pizza. After a couple rounds of this the owner offered to make me full sized focaccias so now that is what I order. They are just super nice people....and culinary gods."

Not only are the owners (the Romano family; Tony, his wife and his parents) super friendly, but they are very generous as well. I had enjoyed everthing I ate and drank so much (beautiful espresso!) that I decided to invite my friend who is from Italy to join me for a lunch date @ Romanos. I was hoping to get an authentic italian perspective. I did!!! We ordered both kinds of the Arancini as well as a sausage Panzerotti. My friend was not only very impressed at the quality, taste and authenticity of these dishes, but he was amazed at how inexpensive they were. He said that just the making of the risotto was time consuming and to do this homemade and get it right was impressive. We also ordered espresso and Tony&#39; wife was happy to oblige. The beans were fresh and aromatic, NOT at all dry as &#34;short k&#34; mentioned in his review, although they were brown as he mentioned but they&#39;re espresso beans, they are supposed to be brown!!! If he knew the process of roasting beans, he&#39;d know that during what is called &#34;the first crack&#34; &amp; &#34;the second crack&#34; of roasting, the beans go from green, to yellowish, to light brown and then the medium to dark brown color. Isabella brushed the chamber clean before adding the fresh grounds, and in minutes we were sipping delicious espresso with a lovely biscotti and canoli... ¡Perfecto!
¡Bravissimo Tony!"

First, no one seemed responsive.  It&#39;s as if they have newbies running the place.  Strike 2, server was handling receipts, money and whatever else and dips his hand into a bucket of cucumbers to serve me some cucumber salad.  Really?  No serving utensils or gloves available?  Needless to say I did not eat it.  Third strike, no Ramen.  No Ramen?  Go 2 doors down to the Target and get a pack for a quarter and run back.  Strike 4, sushi guy had no idea what he was doing (by his own admission poorly trained).  Good intentions, but poor execution.  Opted for Yakisoba, which was tasty but portion size was small.  

I had high hopes for the place but when I come into a restaurant at lunch time I expect them to have the basic and possibly a signature item available.   Maybe if the owner or manager was present things may have been different, but he wasn&#39;t!  Noodles and Company would have been a better choice. Then they charged me $16.75 for an item that was listed on the menu for $11 and struggled to resolve the issue and didn&#39;t.   I had $12 in cash and change gave it to them and left.  What a poor experience!  This is a place I will not be coming back to ever again.  

Overall, not impressed!  Service D+, Food C+, Value for what I got C-/D+, Management F, basic sanitation practices F.  How this place is reviewed so highly is a mystery to me."

From a sushi standpoint, I give it 1 or 2 stars.  I would not go back for the sushi.  Try Mamoya in Aurora, you won&#39;t be disappointed.

For Ramen, we tried the Regular pork ramen, as well as the Spicy Beef ramen.  The regular ramen tasted like miso soup, and I was fighting to see any pork at all.  1 star.

The spicy beef ramen was the only thing that tasted good at all.  It had good flavors and I could see the beef.  I would give that 3 stars.

If you go at all, just get the spicy beef ramen.  I would recommend going elsewhere"

I have finally found a place that has good ramen, and it is not too far from my place of residence. I am so happy!

The restaurant itself is pretty small. There are some seats at the sushi bar, and a few tables to sit at. We came in and sat down right away. I had come here specifically for ramen, and that is definitely what I ordered. I ordered the pork ramen and my husband ordered the spicy beef ramen. There are only two choices, so why not try both?!? We also split a volcano roll. The pork ramen had a great creamy broth and I loved the onions they put in there-it really imparted a great flavor. The spicy beef ramen had the right amount of spice to it. Although, be warned, your insides will probably not like you drinking the bottom of the broth of concentrated &#34;hot-ness&#34;. The ramen noodles were tasty too. I liked the shredded pork used in the ramen. The beef was kind of fatty, but still pretty good. 

The volcano roll was very good-I love baked sushi rolls. I could have eaten five of those. There were also half-priced bottle of wines available on the evening we visited, but we didn&#39;t try any. I will definitely be back here. I have officially deemed this place my &#34;I-don&#39;t-want-to-drive-over-an-hour-to-get-to-the-city-for-ramen-but-I-need-ramen-right-now-!&#34; restaurant.

The shrimp tempura and dragon roll are my favorites right now, but my favorites change very often. There is an incredible selection.
The head chef, Jason, is simply the best. His food is always fresh and incredible, and he and his staff, Chef Nick, Taija, Sara, Tim, Courtney are all friendly, knowledgable, kind and wonderful. They have a very dedicated and loyal customer base who I see returning all the time. This is the clear sign of truly high quality food and service.
The service could not be better. Everyone who works here is great. No matter how busy, the service is quick and kind. The staff has been together for many months, and some years and there is a strong bond and respect among them. They take great pride in their work and it more than shows off.
As you can tell from all my superlatives, I am a huge fan of this restaurant. I cannot possibly recommend it enough. These are all my honest opinions with no exaggerations.
If you are looking for the best sushi in the Chicagoland area (and many people have said the best they&#39;ve ever tasted in any state or country), this is where you want to go. 
Right now, it&#39;s a hidden gem, but it won&#39;t stay that way for long."

We had the dragon role and it was excellent. Then we tried the spicy beef ramen and the park ramen. Both were so good! The broth is very complex and I think the spicy version takes away from the excellent flavor, but they were both excellent. Looking forward to coming back soon."

I&#39;ve seen some great reviews for this place and have been wanting to come here for months.  We finally have a chance to come here on a Thursday (not busy).   I can already predict we&#39;re probably not going to have a good experience as soon as we sat down.  The young girl (server) sat us down and gave us a cucumber salad but never brought us a menu. She came back a few minutes later to take our drink order....still, no menu. I finally asked her for a menu after about 10 minutes (from the time we sat down).  

I&#39;m not sure if the server is new, but she seems to not know anything about the menu. If she&#39;s new, it&#39;s understandable. What made me felt really uncomfortable was she did not smile even once the whole time we were there. She did not even say &#34;sorry&#34; when she forgets something or made a mistake. Just walked away. 

Finally...on our way out the restaurant...we walked past our server...did not even say a &#34;thank-you&#34;, &#34;bye&#34; or even make eye contact with us.   The lady from the kitchen was the one to say &#34;thank you&#34; and good bye to us. 

The food here is fresh but &#34;so-so&#34;....not bad. 
If I were to eat here again...definitely will do take-out instead of dining in.

Food: 3 stars

I&#39;m pretty disappointed with my experience here this time. Maybe I came here on the wrong day?"

With 4.5 star, I was excited that this place was on the way home.  The place is pretty small.  On the plus side, there was a TV that was playing the NIU football game.  

We ordered the sashimi dinner and went with the special roll called Tim Roll.  There were a couple of reviews that talked about it so I was curious.  I get the feeling that the waitress doesn&#39;t normally work there and was just helping out since she couldn&#39;t answer any questions we had (what&#39;s in a certain roll, which fish was in the sashimi dinner, etc.).  It could be that they were short staffed around the holidays.

The order took over 20 minutes to come out.  The sashimi looked good, but not that tasty.  The Tim roll was good, but overpriced at $11 when it only had imitation crab and no fish."

When he answered the phone his tone of voice was as if I was calling a friend. The phone call went back and forth of trying to repeat my order to him not sure if he understood. Which was fine not mad because I am sure it was busy things to do happen very understandable. I order 6 rolls of Spicy Tuna for pick up. When I walked in no greeter, also is fine understandable because it&#39;s busy. THEN, when I went to pay for my food I asked the young boy if he wouldn&#39;t mind adding spicy mayo. Thinking since I ordered 6 rolls I would have maybe gotten about 4 spicy mayo? Did not. Paying the extra fee was not a big deal. But, I saw he only put one (?) I then asked if he could give me four more. It seemed like it bothered him for me to ask for more, if i had to pay for it i would have. He then placed the containers on the side for the cook to fill them with the spicy mayo and walked away. Then the cook filled up 2 containers? It&#39;s all about treating your customers the right way to keep them coming back. It&#39;s little gestures that have me coming back to certain places. Because I feel me asking him was a hassle on top of me asking multiple times for something I felt like I was bothering him. For something so simple you guys have lost a customer from coming back. This is not the first time this happened, so i figured I would give them a second chance, but again DISAPPOINTED."

The fish was fresh and the combinations of ingredients that went into each roll was delicious.  A lot of different choices for rolls, I feel like I ate a lot of rolls that I don&#39;t usually see other places.  It&#39;s obvious the chef (Jason) is very passionate about what he does and cares deeply about serving amazing food - it certainly shows.  

The entire staff was very friendly and the service was prompt.  The restaurant was clean and comfortable, a casual atmosphere that was plenty welcoming.  It&#39;s always nice when chefs and wait staff make you feel like family.

So all in all, one of the best sushi dinners I&#39;ve had in a long time... will definitely go back!"

Jason,

Thank you for responding to my initial review. Honestly I am like you, I don&#39;t normally write or respond to reviews, I decided to write the review because I was VERY DISAPPOINTED with my food. I could have reviewed every single place, but I didn&#39;t feel the need to. And frankly whether I review other establishments or not, it is not your concern.  I don&#39;t think how many reviews I post on yelp should have anything to do with the quality of food.

You guys did NOT &#34;rubbed&#34; me in the wrong way, I simply just thought the food was SUBSTANDARD. Being an Asian, I have Japanese food quite often, average once a week. Just FYI, I am even more picky when it comes to ramen. I have had plenty of Japanese food in my life since I&#39;ve been living in NYC for the past 10+ years and even travel to Japan multiple times.  Maybe my standard for sushi is higher but to me, the quality of my lunch was just ONE star. The cucumber and the oranges were nice touch but the sushi.. I&#39;m sorry, not good!!!

I was trying to be nice and did not mention in my review, but your waiter, who was preparing /chopping some kind of food behind the bar when I asked for my check, simply wiped his bare hands, and when to the touch screen register and printed my check!!! BARE HANDS, WITHOUT GLOVES! I didn&#39;t see him wash his hands either before returning back behind the counter and continue!! Deep down, I just HOPE I didn&#39;t order any ingredients that were prepare by him!

I&#39;m glad your other customers (totally 3, during lunch hours) enjoyed your food. I merely just want to share my experience with the yelp community.

Hope this helps to clarify why I only gave ONE STAR. I really don&#39;t want you to be puzzled or suspicious. 

Original Review: 
Cute place but the food is not good quality! I&#39;ve had a lot better sushi elsewhere. Probably won&#39;t return again. :("

We were the only ones in the restaurant and it took more than 45 minutes to serve the food. It pisses me off that it didn&#39;t take 5 mins to eat the rolls and we wanted to order more but it would take another 45 mins.

Went for a drive on my lunch break and noticed a small restaurant call Sushi n Noodle. I had to try since I avoid fast food places at all cost. Walked in and I was greeted and asked to sit where ever I wanted. I love noodles and Sushi so I tried my usual Spicy Tuna Roll and a Beef Ramen. I have to say both were awesome. Sushi was freshly made and they were larger than normal. The Beef Ramen was perfect, beef was soft and tender. They even served me a small salad while I waited to be served. A freshly cut orange as I waited for the bill. For Plainfield/Naperville it is priced a little higher than most sushi places but you pay for what you get and I didnt mind it at all. Over all my visit couldn&#39;t have been better. Clean, great environment,  nice people, good food. Will make it one of my weekly stops when I need to get away from work during lunch.

The place was completely empty when we came in, and our food was brought out pretty quickly. I loved the veggie tempura they made us upon request. 

The sushi was very decent but not the best I&#39;ve had, maybe a B as sushi goes. The prices were higher than they should be based on the quality of the food. I really liked the sliced cucumber that was brought when we first sat down. My husband said his noodles and salmon were good but not spectacular. I will say that we ate every bite, but it was over $50 for two sushi rolls, a noodle special, and some veggie tempura. 

I might eat here again, but probably not with my whole family. If I&#39;m going to spend a lot on sushi, I&#39;d rather go to a place with A+ sushi and a better ambiance."

So I found this restaurant on yelp, because it has such an awesome reviews from different people. I came in this restaurant after my work, and when I came in, all the three tables are taken, and the rest two are not cleaned. And it&#39;s ok, because I understand the waitress is too busy to do that. I waited by the door for 10 minutes, until the sushi chef came and helped make the table. I sat down, and waited for another 10 minutes, waitress never came by my table. So I had to call her to come by. She took my order, but never gave me water. I order the miso soup and other stuff. I sat there for another 15 minutes, no miso soup(which is already made and is in the big pot), no water. And the waitress never came by my table. Then I kept waiting and waiting, finally got my miso soup and water. But my food still hasn&#39;t came. I have been waiting in this restaurant for over 30 minutes, and I only order sushi! So I asked the waitress if the food can come a little bit faster. She looked at me, then started yelling&#34; are you serious?? Don&#39;t you see me have that many customers?!&#34; That moment I was shocked, and didn&#39;t know what to respond. I have never ever had bad service like that before. This is the first time! I understand the restaurant could be busy, but yelling at customer?! This is definitely unacceptable!!! I would never ever recommend anyone to come to this restaurant!!!!

It&#39;s located in a strip mall and the actual interior is fairly small, but enjoyable because of the friendly and family-oriented atmosphere. 

We usually go every other weekend, and it is quite busy during the dinner rush on Fridays but the wait is never too long. We have sat at both bar and a booth, we much prefer the bar because the chef is very friendly and interacts with customers quite frequently. Servers are nice, it is usually the same 2 girls, who are very sweet and attentive. 

A variety of craftsmen beer from Japan, wines, as well as hot and cold sake are all available. We usually stick with sharing a large Sapporo. Our favorite rolls have been the Puerto Vallarta roll, Godzilla, and the Jorgensen roll. The Puerto Vallarta and Jorgensen are specialty rolls and are a little pricier but definitely worth it since the fish is so fresh. The short ribs and sweet potato tempura are our favorite appetizers. Their ramen as well as the fried yakiudon noodles are delicious and very filling. 

Overall, great food presentation, friendly atmosphere, and good service. The restaurant is minimally decorated and clean. Glad to say we&#39;ve eaten there without incident. The only thing is the tables and bar are very close together and its difficult to navigate through if it is busy. I would definitely recommend."

Love sushi. The whole idea of sushi in a strip mall had me avoid eating here for around a decade. Have driven from over by 135th past this place to get take out from by Showplace (that place was close enough for me and seemed like a better set up from the look). Well they say you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing till you try it and now I know and can kick myself in the butt. Especially when I think of all the little sushi places I&#39;ve eaten away in the city that look just like Sushi &amp; Noodle.

Finally gave in, thinking I could get some noodles and went in tonight while the kids were getting Cherry Berry, mentioned how hungry I was and was delighted to be given a free, yes FREE! Piece of sushi along with the cucumber salad for while I waited for my 2 rolls. 

Now, I love yellowtail, I order it every single time I eat sushi, the fish here was just as fresh as any of the freshest I&#39;ve ever had. My 2nd roll, a caterpillar, was yummy too.

 Not pretentious, friendly staff, and good city-type atmosphere inside. Too bad it&#39;s stuck in the burbs in a strip mall next to Target where idiots like me avoid it. Took a to go menu. I will eat here again... Soon. Don&#39;t be an idiot like me! Eat here!"

SERVICE: The staff was very friendly and attentive. There were numerous choices on the menu. We explained to our server that we had never eaten sushi before and asked for suggestions. She patiently answered all our questions and made some excellent suggestions.  
RESTAURANT: Clean and neat. We sat in a booth but there was plenty of counter seating if you want to watch your food being prepared. 
FOOD: Upon being seated, our server gave us a plate of thinly sliced cucumber, which was fresh and crunchy. We shared a plate of noodles and a bowl of soup.  Both were hot and tasty. We ordered the Godzilla Roll and another entree, which I can&#39;t remember. It was very good and I enjoyed trying a variety of different sushi. Everything was fresh. We decided that neither one of us are huge sushi lovers. I would order it again for an appetizer, but not a meal.  I gave this place 5 stars because it sounds like from other reviews that if you like sushi, this is an excellent restaurant. Just because I&#39;m not a huge fan of sushi in general, I didn&#39;t want to give it less stars than it deserved. If you&#39;re not sure about sushi, this would be a good place to go."

The décor is minimal, located in small narrow storefront in a strip mall. The service can be hit or miss, depending on who&#39;s working; but the maki are fabulous. Their Godzilla Roll (shrimp tempura, avocado, cream cheese, cucumber and wasabi mayo) is my favorite roll ever. Hands down. Second favorite is the Dragon Roll, and I also dig the Rainbow Roll a lot. I&#39;ve only had noodles there once before, but they were tasty. I had the Nabeyaki Udon that had an egg in it that was also slightly sweet. Will definitely have it again once the weather turns cold. All in all, one of my favorite places. Unfortunately, the price of sushi limits my visits; but that&#39;s also because I usually pig out when I&#39;m here. If you just want some basic sushi (no fancy maki), the prices are fairly reasonable."

We had lunch at sushi noodle and I was pleasantly surprised. I don&#39;t claim to be any sort of expert on sushi but I do eat sushi quite a bit. Sushi noodle this is some of the best I&#39;ve had. The icing on the whole thing was the service. The staff was friendly and attentive. I&#39;m usually not one to write a review but I use yelp so much I figured it start adding my two cents when i find a restaurant I really like.

No frills, fairly small place - and despite the plethora of open tables, we were welcomed and encouraged to sit at the sushi bar. So glad we did!

Wanting both a noodle dish and sushi after reading other reviews, I tried both. The Philly Roll was perfection - and it&#39;s one of those rolls that I use as a baseline among sushi places before getting into more exotic stuff. Super-fresh, rolled perfectly - I was impressed. 

More impressive was how the owner (I am so mad at myself for forgetting his name, he was so great) was so wonderful with our 5YO. She&#39;s a pretty adventurous eater, and loves sushi bars, but thanks to him this is now her favorite. He engaged her in conversation, then prepared a plate of delicately sliced strawberries and mango for her for &#34;dessert&#34; - which she LOVED. Above and beyond with such a little thing, but it made a huge impact. She hasn&#39;t stopped talking about it. 

I had pan-fried noodles with beef alongside the sushi, and they were delish - not too soft, not too crunchy... just right. The beef was flavorful and cooked very well, and really I should have stopped eating long before I did.

We also tried the gyoza for an app. Only four to an order so they went quick - next time we&#39;ll order two. But again - SO. GOOD. 

Nevermind that it&#39;s in a strip mall next to a Target. Just go. Go now. Run if you have to."

Pieces of fresh sashimi, a rice lager, udon soup, and matcha green tea ice cream are so comforting to me. I will alway have a special place in my heart for Sushi &amp; Noodle. It is a lovely touch to have my own case of chopsticks waiting for me when I come in. Try the spicy scallop, maguro, squid, beef short rib with wasabi mashed potato ball (when in season) and Tataki roll. Amazing. Soul food from the Far East."

I think if they dimmed the lights the atmosphere and ambiance would benefit. Let&#39;s get to the food. I saw many great reviews on yelp so thought I would give it a try. I was really wanting some sushi rolls and a good soup. I saw they had both on the menu and got really excited. We ordered the dynamite roll. It seemed to not be rolled professionally, there was so much more rice than actual fish, which for me, is not a good thing. I ordered this particular roll because the description states a variety of fish throughout the roll. I was disappointed, the wasabi sauce that the roll was served with did not have any flavor. And the fish was under room temperature which was not appealing. So not the greatest roll I&#39;ve ever had, move along to the soup. I ordered the spicy ramen and my boyfriend ordered the regular pork ramen. Neither had any flavor. The soup has a nice viscosity, but lacked any special flavor. His soup had like a pork bone in it, with scarce meat on it. And for $12, i think that&#39;s ridiculous. I&#39;ve had pho at other amazing restaurants for $7 that&#39;s packed with flavor and meat.  My ramen just tasted spicy, which I love spice, but I wanted more flavor, and it just didn&#39;t have any. The meat was very fatty and tough. Inedible. We were both very disappointed with our meals. I sent mine back, but we hate complaining, we should have sent my boyfriends back as well. Its not disgusting, it&#39;s just not appetizing or appealing. I don&#39;t get the reviews. Maybe I did something wrong, whatever the case, I think one thing we ordered Should have been good, and nothing was. I give you 2 stars. Overpriced, less than mediocre food."

The Godzilla roll and the spicy tuna roll were our favorites.  I forgot exactly what was in the Godzilla, but I do remember that I started to feel posessive of the last few pieces and didn&#39;t want to share.  The spicy tuna was the best I&#39;ve had, the spicy had a bit more &#34;oomph&#34; to it without making me feel like I was going to breathe fire.  We tried 2 other rolls, both very good.  

I feel like there is always 1 in 4 or 1 in 5 rolls that I don&#39;t like or wouldn&#39;t order again.  This was not at all the case here - I wanted to eat every piece of every roll.  But my stomach capacity, and dining partner, probably would not have liked that.

Take a seat at the sushi bar.  Both chefs were pleasant, friendly and one chatted and joked around with us a little bit.  If you&#39;re a &#34;to-go&#34; sushi person, this is a great place to stop.

Prices were fair.  I think we paid about $50 for 4-5 rolls and 2 sodas."

The restaurant, recently renovated, is very nice inside. Great ambiance and even better food. Admittedly, I more often opt for takeout rather than dine in but I&#39;ve never been disappointed with either. There is a lot of variety for sushi, which is very tasty, but their non-sushi menu is great, too. I get a craving for their pork ramen soup almost every time it gets cold outside, and their edamame is perfectly done. My husband loves the spicy seafood ramen, so much so that I never get to try it :) I believe they have also updated their menu and added a few new options that I&#39;m looking forward to tasting.

Arrived at about 11:40, opens at 11:30. Floor was filthy, had not been swept for days. Especially under the tables. The soy sauce bottles were as sticky as the tables. There was a rag sitting out that the waitress used over and over to wipe the tables. She never rinsed it. Service very poor. Only gave us one menu, had to ask for another. The same waitress said she was going to get our cucumber salad and she would right back, never got it. Served warm water, no ice. Took over 55 minutes to get a shrimp noodle dish, a volcano roll and 6 pieces of nigiri sushi for the two of us. We ordered a shrimp and vegetable tempura appetizer after being told they had no sweet potatoes, (hmmm, just opened and had a daily special with sweet potatoes). The waitress cooked the tempura appetizer, it was dark, over cooked and tasted like it was cooked in old oil. A table came in after us and got their sushi lunch way before us. The food. Bad tempera appetizer, older smoke salmon nigiri, not fresh. Tuna was ok, salmon roe was okay. My sisters, shrimp noodle dish had no flavor and a few shrimps for $11.00!

The man was wonderful! Absolutely made sure everything was great. We had sushi, rolls, miso soup (whoa good stuff on a snowy day), and asparagus plate. He brought us a complimentary pork plate which I really enjoyed. Not too much seasoning but just enough to give it an oriental flair. 

Three of us with three rolls, eight orders of nigiri sushi, asparagus and teas was $90 with a generous tip. Not cheap but not bad for sushi with my ladies!"

I sought this place out for its Udon and Ramen (which are fantastic), but have become truly hooked by the sushi.
I&#39;m kind of a sushi snob and have eaten at most of the good sushi places in the Naperville area, and was a weekly regular at Kiku for a couple of years. I have also eaten at most of the top-rated sushi spots in Chicago, L.A., Hawaii, Dallas, and Seattle. Chef Jason at Sushi &amp; Noodle can stand with any of them (and above most). He is that rare commodity on the dining scene today: He is a culinary craftsman that will not compromise on quality in pursuit of profit. The result is that the fish at S&amp;N is as fresh as any I&#39;ve had in Seattle or L.A.  For a small, unassuming spot in Plainfield, this would be something pretty special, but add to that the unique creations that Jason crafts that will melt on your palette, and you have THE BEST SUSHI RESTAURANT in the Southwestern Suburbs, and I&#39;m confident one of the best in all of Chicagoland.
I can&#39;t believe how lucky I am to have this place so close to where I live.

Also, the waitress was late, so we had to seat ourselves and then wait for her to show up for work. She wasn&#39;t very good in general.  Didn&#39;t explain anything on the menu for us, or come back for our empty plates.   Really unorganized.

We frequent the sushi restaurants in downtown Chicago. The sushi, sashimi and special rolls are on par, if not better, than the sushi that you can get in downtown Chicago.

They have excellent fresh sushi and sashimi. We always get a specialty roll made by Chef Cho! Trust Chef Cho to make you a delicious one of kind roll. He has an excellent palate and artistic flair.

Tonight we went in early and had his Omakase tasting menu. Seven perfect courses. Each plate was served with perfect pacing. Highlights from our meal: we started with a spicy soup with crispy, delicately fried sweet shrimp in a broth of chili, tofu, mushrooms and combu. Watercress salad with fresh diver scallops and calamari crudo dressed with mango-miso purée. There was the scallop with cream of pork - it was the perfect marriage of buttery Beurre Blanc-esque pork cream ladled over sweet scallops. Inventive sushi courses followed: Uni, mackerel, tuna, and most memorably, a quickly seared salmon belly, thanks to a deft use of the blow torch. The Tekka don included salmon and tuna components over the best sushi rice. We finished with slowly braised, meltingly soft pork ribs - he cut the richness with some Kimchi essence - perfect combination of spice and acidity - to match the richness of the pork!

You have to try this place! We keep coming back to see what Chef Cho has in store for us. You won&#39;t be disappointed."

Once I am done breast feeding I am excited to try some of the other fish that are higher in Mercury until then I will stick with salmon crab and shrimp I will def be back here it is convienient for me and curves my craving!

First of all, this is a key tip: if you walk in here, sit at the sushi bar. If you don&#39;t, you will be motioned to come over. Ichiro, who I assume is the owner, is really personable and goes out of his way to make his guests feel welcomed. My group got one Plainfield roll (nom) and two noodle orders. It was all magnificent. 

I&#39;ve spent a great deal of time over the last year nuking Costco-purchased yakisoba noodles, but that&#39;s all over now. Sushi &amp; Noodle has ruined me for anything less than what they&#39;re providing. This needs to be on your short list any time you&#39;re dining out in Plainfield."

Usually great place to sit, eat and catch up with family and friends. I have had way better experiences here, just unfortunately reporting on the one bad one.

Also, my family and I usually are very pleased and impressed with the professionalism of the crew at Coopers Hawk. However, Last night we were very surprised at the way our waitress held and presented herself. It was nothing like we had been accompanied with before at this location. Her presentation was not held to the standards that I view this restaurant at. She was almost too casual when it came to ordering and did not seem to try to be professional once so ever.

I could barely ask about the food because you have to listen to the obligatory spiel about the wine club.  I used to think entering through the &#34;gift/wine&#34; shop was interesting but now it has shades of Cracker Barrel written all over it!  Stay for wine and appetizers and skip the entrees.  The salads are pretty good, but I ordered short ribs that were more akin to pot roast for $25!  The &#34;short ribs&#34; were accompanied by mashed potatoes, and pretty raw parsnips and carrots that were a total turn off.  One star for that dish!  Dinner companions had the prime rib sandwich that was closer to Italian beef or philly cheese steak, and not that good!  It seems to me the wine pairings appear less than I viewed on previous menus but the wait person assured me it wasn&#39;t true!  We were celebrating a birthday and they brought a chocolate covered strawberry and a white chocolate truffle, to our delight it was not accompanied with song!  However, had I known they charged $4.99 for the &#34;birthday treat,&#34; I&#39;d have ordered what we would have preferred from the dessert menu.  We were never told there was a charge for that.  Out bill was almost $130 for three, charging for that &#34;treat&#34; was really tacky.  Even the wines weren&#39;t as crisp as they used to be.  Last visit here, sorry!"

We ordered some appetizers. their drunken Mexican shrimp and Ahi-Tuna Sashimi. The shrimp was wrapped in bacon, set on a bed of guacamole and drizzled with a tequila butter lime sauce. It tasted divine!  I loved the Ahi-tuna sashimi it was a light poke flavor to it. I would recommend people to try this appetizers they were very good.

I ordered their surf and turf 2 filet medallions and crab cake with Mary&#39;s Potatoes. The vegetables were a little too crunchy from me but that wasn&#39;t a big deal. The filets were cooked to perfection a juicy medium red and I loved the Mary&#39;s potatoes and the crab was good, not anything outstanding.

Most of my table ordered the fish and chips and were satisfied.

My love and I were greeted after a few moments. We requested seating on the patio and the hostess quickly found us a spot on this beautiful sunny day.  Seated under the market umbrellas made for a fantastic lunch.

We ordered appetizers and a glass of Merlot for me and Red Sangria for my man.   My wine was enjoyable... Sangria was refreshing.

For our food journey we tried a variety of bites.  Starting with the Lobster Bisque.. which the Server brought to our table in two cups ...as we had mentioned  sharing .. So nice touch.  Pork Belly Sliders.. They were presented on a small tortilla... Nice plating.  The Pork Belly BBQ was sweet with hints of a familiar sauce and topped with just the right amount of Slaw.   We loved them !

The Drunken Mexican Shrimp .. Nice size Jumbo Shrimp wrapped in bacon .. Another beautiful plating.  These little beauties rested in a swirl of fresh guacamole and married with a Tequila and butter Sauce.  I&#39;m thinking shrimp and bacon were flash fried.  Making bacon nicely cooked and the marriage of the Tequila Butter Sauce and Guacamole ..  Yum.. That bite of bacon and shrimp..nice.  Great Job. 

Crab Beignets were Shredded crab .. I&#39;m guessing in a lite beer batter before hitting the fryer...served with a Parmesan Sauce and burnt lemon and Asian Slaw.. Very tasty. 

South of the Boarder Egg Roll .. I think this a cleaver shift .. Backing up the familiar Egg Roll with a different set of back up singers than these Rolls usually swing with.  In this case served with Asian Slaw, Cashew Sauce and a Cilantro Sauce.  Nice Mix up .. Nice  Sides and Sauces.  

We had a great day, enjoyed the Wine, Food, Service and Company!  Enjoy!"

Apparently they make their own wine too. Very busy for a cold Monday night. Decent portion size for most of the dishes. Very friendly, good service. 

My shaved Brussel Sprouts salad was big and tasty. The turkey burger from the healthy menu was not comparable to some of the better ones I&#39;ve eaten at other similar types of places. I think they can consider going on a competitive field trip to reevaluate the preparation of this item versus the completion. My friend s ahi tuna was a good size and he liked it.

One of the more solid healthy gastro wine comfort food concepts in the West burbs. You have to walk through a gift shop with a bunch of wine paraphernalia to get to the restaurant, which I find a little cheesy, but it seems to work well for the target clientele. 

Solid place. I will certainly come again."

They handled the large group very well. Seated us fast (we had reservations, so of course they would) and kept the ole water full the whole time. I had the lobster bisque and it was FAN-TASTIC. Get it any time that you go there. I ordered the salmon. It came and was perfectly cooked but it was definitely on the smallish size. Normally not an issue but not with a lot of sides. It had a very good mashed potato thing with it that I liked. The only thing that was irritating was the waiter. With a large corporate group, you could see his revenue meter spin. Almost everything was an up-sell or attempt at pushing more orders. When I&#39;m paying, I get very mad at a waiter&#39;s attempt to manipulate a time when you are trying to be gracious. When I&#39;m receiving, I feel just as disappointed. On top of that, there were only about 10 of us. I don&#39;t think he remembered once who ordered what appetizer, drink, entree, etc. A restaurant that is this nice/upscale/trying to set itself apart should get a waiter who could at least be better at writing things down/ordering in a pattern if he can&#39;t remember."

We had a party of 12, but even so, service seems dreadfully slow. I&#39;m hearing some lame excuse about one meal needing to be remade, and that&#39;s causing some slowdown.

Anyway, on to the food. I ordered the blackened hangar steak salad, and it was tasty, if drowned in dressing. My pre-spouse ordered the chicken parm and it was not as good as she&#39;s had elsewhere. Actually, there were few at our table that thought the food was much more than workmanlike.

Coopers Hawk talks a great deal about their wines, and how all their wines are made locally. I kinda question that since their winery is in Countryside (by their own admission) and I&#39;ve never thought that Illinois wines are of any stature in the wine world. Is there any acid soil in Illinois, land of corn and soy beans? I think not.

The decor is nice enough, but you can&#39;t eat bricks. I think they spent a lot of money on the decor that  might have been better spent in the kitchen. Just saying."

You get a tasting for two and two bottles of wine every month. He is the one that turned me on to Cooper&#39;s hawk. Our first date was here and we had a really great time. We started with a tasting. I&#39;ll preface with this...I&#39;m not a wine snob and I like cheap and some expensive wine but each wine I tasted was really good. 

I&#39;m a sweet wine fan! My first favorite is the white sangria. It&#39;s very...juicy? It&#39;s not dry by any means. Very fruity, like it had been soaked with fruit in it. Their menu says there are hints of apricot and ripe yellow apples.  My next favorite was the red sangria. It&#39;s not as sweet as the white but was pretty good. There&#39;s flavored of grape jam, maraschino cherry orange zest and red apple. 

And then of course I had to try the dessert wines. The ice wine is very good! It starts out sweet and ends a little tart. It halos has a higher alcohol percentage. I also tried night jar and it is TOO sweet. It&#39;s very syrupy. I was told there is honey in it so that makes sense. But it was just overwhelming sweet. 

Then we moved on to dinner. I had the Gnocchi Carbonara. Wow. Let me tell you. I&#39;ve have Gnocchi before but this was a perfect dish. The seasoning was perfect. The sauce was creamy and was just the right amount too. The portion was perfect too. I was very hungry so I ate all of it! Will definitely order it again."

My only complaint about the food is in regard to the Thai lettuce wraps from the appetizer menu.  Way too much sauce &amp; broccoli slaw for way too little meat!
We also love sangria, and think the peach &amp; passion fruit are the best.  The mango was just so-so.  
The staff was attentive, but a little too formal in my opinion.  The setting is nice, but can get loud if the tables are full.  Parking can be tough too.

When the wait gets extreme, I eat at the bar. Same food. Same wine. Faster service and you&#39;re in and you&#39;re out. Damn, did I just give away a secret? Oh well. I inhaled my filet trio and my wife downed her surf &#39;n turf in record time, leaving our bar seat open shortly after our actual table was announced. Some lucky folks benefitted from us giving it up after we found the seat at the bar. Oh, and make sure you get the pork belly tostada. It&#39;s a must."

The tasting room is fun but always a wait for that, too. That said, I was a member for almost a year and I go back whenever I have something to celebrate because this menu cannot be beaten. Gluten free bread is served at the table along with pretzel bread, and a full Gluten free menu is available. The desserts are to die for, especially Banoffee pie. My favorite appetizers are the Drunken Shrimp and the Thai Lettuce Wraps-- the latter are easily enough for a meal in themselves. Other favorites are the Flatbread (for the money-conscious) and the Short Rib Risotto (for special occasions). Come see what all the fuss is about! You won&#39;t be disappointed!"

(Plus God and tastes) It was another win for CHW though not sensational.  Our meal started with an extra base hit,  the Winery&#39;s 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon Syrah.  The notes were accurate, but when any winery outside a first or second growth advertises a long finish, I&#39;m immediately skeptical.  To CHW&#39;s credit they were as good as advertised, and for $ 7.75 a glass.  A comparable wine anywhere else would be 9.- 13 $ a glass.  

My entree salmon was a tad dry, but it&#39;s better cooked well than slip and hit raw.  The asian slaw was light and delicious.  We had a ooey gooey cake which is like a pound cake.  It too was a little dry, definitely overbaked.  Still the creme glace and mixed berries helped make the dessert pleasurable. 

Service was excellent and the blowing snow outside as seen from our warm confines promoted ambience. I&#39;m ready for a return trip soon"

We decided to start out dinner /w a appetizer and decided on the calamari. I&#39;m sorry, but calamari coated in fish and chips style batter is just NOT good. It covered up any and all flavor of the calamari itself. We ate maybe 1/8th of it and decided to just chalk it up to maybe it just isn&#39;t our style... but I&#39;ve had dozens of types of calamari and this is the first one I didn&#39;t enjoy at all.

For our entree&#39;s I decided on a surf and turf combo /w Parmesan and herb crusted tenderloin /w crab cakes for the surf portion. My wife ordered a chicken chorizo burger. 

Once our food arrived I tried the tenderloin medallion and WOW did I get a strong parmesan taste that just overwhelmed the dish. It looks like they just plopped a heaping tablespoon of this &#34;mixture&#34; that took over the dish. I decided to scoop off the parm and try just the tenderloin and what I found was a unseasoned cut of meat that underwhelmed me.  Along side this was a plain crab cake, just sitting there looking all sad. It had nothing /w it and tasted rather bland also. There was no sauce or anything provided with it. Very disappointing.

My wife&#39;s burger again tasted very bland, it had no real spice to it at all. She ate maybe 2 bites and said no way. I also tasted it and was very underwhelmed myself.

The server came and asked if we were all done and we said yes, he asked her if the food was good and she said no it really was not. He apologized and that was it, he brought the full check and basically that was it. We paid for everything even though it was awful and will never be back. I have never had a server ask me if the food was good and when you say no they don&#39;t do anything about it.

A horrible anniversary date that will never be repeated /w this establishment.  Expensive too considering we ate very little."

We ordered bruschetta , salad for the table. Which was pretty good especially bruschetta was quite good. I ordered surf&amp; turf (medallion with grouper), the medallion was just ok but the fish was not so right. It was frozen food, not the fresh fish( I really want to say something but I didnt want to ruin family dinner time especially with my mother in law). The waitress took all my cutleries and didnt set me up. So I had to waited for another 15 minutes, I had to ask several times for sliced of lemons. She definitely was not deserve 20% of tips we paid. 
My dish was about $30 but it was not so worth it. 
My sister ordered fish&amp;chips , also not so crispy or fresh. All dishes was below then average. I dont think I want to come back again."

When you first walk in, you are greeted by Wine accessories. I mean glitzed out wine bottles and crystal wine bottle openers with red cubic zirconia&#39;s in them. Completely over the top but cute and fun to look at. They have chocolates, cheese and crackers at the &#34;bar&#34; where you can enjoy a taster or a glass of wine before being seated for dinner. 

The actual restaurant has a very cozy, classy warm feel. once seated we were greeted quickly by a friendly server who explained a few special items and we ordered the Ahi tuna tacos, Pork belly tostadas, Short rib risotto, Ahi tuna plate and the churrasco steak. The steak was cooked to perfection (Med-rare) the short rib was SO tender and juicy. The ahi tuna and tacos were amazing and great portions. I enjoyed the pork belly tostadas as well but those were not on the level of the other dishes. We had wine and sangria etc with our meal and it was still less than $150 for 3 drinking hungry women lol. Great restaurant, great décor, great prices."

We were going to the Morton Arboretum so I found this place which was close by. First, a big turn off was a stale sticky smell in the dining area. The outer part was nice with the tile floor and a little gift shop, but once they brought us back to the dining area, it was all carpeted and it just had that smell of an old dirty restaurant that hadn&#39;t been cleaned in a while. That&#39;s a huge turn off for me. 

I ended up ordering the Jambalaya which was just okay. They put too many celery pieces in it and the celery pieces were huge which was gross to me. Other than that, the taste was just eh. I wouldn&#39;t say bland, but just nothing special. My mom&#39;s steak looked good though! One of our guests ordered a burger - medium cooked. They brought out well done so she sent it back only to have them bring out another well done burger! She ended up eating it, but told the waitress at the end it was still over-cooked. The manager ended up coming over and gave her a free meal because of this. 

When we made reservations, my mom mentioned it was her birthday and I guess they forgot, so we reminded them and they brought out a little treat for her which was really good. 

I was happy with the bread (delicious), a lobster bisque soup I ordered and the dessert! I got a chocolate cake which was very moist and rich! Came with ice cream too! 

Our server was really nice and apologetic about the issues which helped. As well as the manger. 

I have a free meal, but I&#39;m not rushing to go back to tell you the truth!"

I still stand behind the previous review because it was all true. &#34;Only the names were changed to protect the innocent.&#34; Wait, I think that line was from Dragnet. 

Cooper&#39;s Hawk did contact us about the previous review shortly after I posted the review. They were concerned about how we were treated and wanted to know every detail beyond what I reviewed. They couldn&#39;t be more apologetic and even after I declined a complementary dinner for two and a wine tasting, they sent them anyway. 
The comps sat in the envelope for a couple of months until we felt comfortable  returning to Cooper&#39;s  Hawk. 

We made reservations for a late Sunday dinner, when we arrived once again they took our cellphone number to text us when our table would be ready. This time the table was ready on time! Not wanting to take advantage of the establishment, we decided to order our previous meal (the one we had trouble with). Everything arrived as it should, there we no mistakes and the food was excellent as it usually is (except for our previous experience). The server was attentive, friendly and funny! All was right with the world! 

Then it happened, the manager stopped by to check how our dining experience was; I cracked like a little kid who was caught by his parents who previously did something wrong and got away with it. I told her about our previous experience, even showed her my previous less than positive Yelp review. The unexpected happened, she was appreciative   of that review and told us how helpful it was, that it was the topic of a training meeting and how they could improve the dining experience. 

I felt bad about writing the previous negative review, but felt better that it actually did some good. We will gladly return to Cooper&#39;s Hawk and feel better about the establishment that they really care and listen to customer comments and feedback."

The initial experience was so great, I joined the club.  However, today...THE WORST!

I started with the tasting experience where I was totally ignored by the server and has to move to another area just to get the slightest bit of attention.

After I finished the tasting, I moved to dining.  After being seated, I waited an extraordinary amount of time to be served, to get my water refilled, to get carry out containers &amp; finally, to get a bill.  I actually had to ask another server if my own server was still working.  He never reappeared after taking our order.

I am in no hurry to revisit because I  in no hurry to pay for subpar service. I am so disgusted sitting here waiting for my server to show up, as I listen to another dining guest vent about their service...

What&#39;s happening to this place????  I&#39;m only giving 2 stars because of the delicious food.  Now the manager is lying about why our server wasn&#39;t attentive, when other guest are complaining as well!

Thanks for the complimentary bottle of wine for the lousy service!"

A few years ago, I started going to Cooper&#39;s Hawk in Burr Ridge, as this location didn&#39;t open yet.  I joined the wine club on my first visit.  I was a wine club member for a few years till I just decided to not continue.  You get some great perks with it, so I&#39;m not knocking it at all.  
If you&#39;re going to read anything in my review, please note that you NEED to make a reservation here...they get crowded all the time unless you go on a very off hour to eat.  There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, as well as a bar area.  I&#39;ve always had good service here.  If you end up with an amazing server, they will even split your bill, they can even split the cost of a glass of wine!  That part of the experience isn&#39;t always consistent.  Over the years the menu has changed, but there is plenty to choose from and the quality is excellent...this goes for the food AND the wine, and the pretzel bread you get at the table.
There is a wine tasting area/gift shop when you walk in.  Wine tastings change monthly.  I highly suggest this place if you haven&#39;t been here if you&#39;re a wine drinker or not.  A few years back my family had Thanksgiving Dinner here as well.  That too, was a great experience!"

Had the opportunity to stop in for lunch today with my wife and toddler. Coopers Hawk is A winery restaurant that sell its own branded wine through its wine club and also serves its wine in their restaurant. There are multiple locations throughout Chicagoland.  The only complaint I have about this place is the consistency of food and service amongst its various locations with South Barrington being the best in my opinion and this location in Naperville a close second. Had the opportunity to try a new menu item, the crispy buttermilk chicken salad. It comes with a side of spicy honey sauce which is amazing. The sandwich itself was one of the best I&#39;ve had. Nice crunch on the outside and moist and juicy inside. The Asian slaw pairs well with it. My wife had a burger which was also good.

We started with an appetizer  Asian Pork Belly Tostadas excellent texture and flavor!

Pretzel bread was very warm and the whipped butter melted into the bread...yummy!

Entrees: 

Life balance tender medallions with golden potatoes, grilled kale and sweet cherry tomatoes was scrumptious!

Risotto and Beef short rib was flavorful yet delicate.

Spaghetti and meat balls with sauce was very rich and flavorful.

Atmosphere was quite around 4:00pm but soon it was loud as it became crowed around 5:15pm. I have gone to another location and the atmosphere is always loud as it has a vaulted ceiling.

Overall, excellent place to eat! 5stars!"

As a total wine-o foodie-holic Cooper&#39;s Hawk is basically my heaven. Everything about the restaurant is on point - the decor, the wine, the staff, the ambience, the food, the retail - just everything.

I&#39;ve been to a few different Cooper&#39;s Hawk locations but this one is my favorite. The location is super convenient and I&#39;ve had some really fabulous service at this location. I love trying new wine - red, white, pink, sparkling, you name it I&#39;ll sip it! The wait staff is very knowledgeable with their wines, so they&#39;re a great source for suggestions. My absolute favorite is their house Malbec. I almost always have a bottle in my house.

The food is of course amazing as well. Here are some of my favorite dishes that I highly suggest!

- Crab &amp; Lobster Bisque
- BBQ Chicken Salad
- Mexican Drunken Shrimp
- Calamari
- Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flatbread
- Blackened Ahi Tuna
- Jambalaya
- Asian Slaw (side)
- Country Rigatoni
- Turkey Burger
- Blackened Blue Steak Salad

(As you can see I&#39;ve been here a lot!)

Pro tips:
- They have a Life Balance menu with healthier options / smaller portions!
- The soup and salad lunch combo is a great choice! They&#39;ll even let you sub the half salad from the list with one of their life balance chopped salads. 
- Cooper&#39;s has a wine club that you can join! My in-laws are a part of it and every month they are getting new bottles of wine. They even get points and discounts on their bill when they dine in.
- Check out their retail shop! So many cute wine accessories for sale. There are also bartenders who are ready and willing to pour you a taste test of any of their wines! I promise you won&#39;t leave empty handed."

What was I thinking? Lunch was on them.

&#34;Pick a place near your office&#34; they said... &#34;um..&#34; I replied &#34;my office is around the corner from your office.. and I never go to my office anyway... just pick one of the places off of Freedom drive and I&#39;m good&#34;

Cooper&#39;s Hawk it was.. and I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t just do the coffee thing.

The restaurant focuses a lot on the wine part of the meal.. from the private label wine store when you enter, to the flights of wines available for tasting. I had a Diet Coke... the waitress was attentive and kept my glass full, so I was good.

The special for lunch was the thin sliced Prime Rib Sandwich. Who am I to argue with that? So I got it. The sandwich was delicious, the bun soft, the meat tender... it came with three sauces... a tasty au jus (which I didn&#39;t need too much of) and a horseradish sauce that was delicious. 

The fries were pretty good too, that was the third sauce.. ketchup (or do you say.. catsup?) in it&#39;s own little ceramic ramekin.. that alone tells you this place is upscale.. no farting ketchup bottles on these tables. 

Everett had the drunken shrimp which he get&#39;s regularly and loves! Dave had  Dana&#39;s Parmesan Chicken... he said it was great and the mashed potatoes were especially awesome.

Everybody that I talk to likes this place. 

I certainly enjoyed myself, we talked business but it wasn&#39;t excruciating like so many of those things can be. I appreciated the lunch and their time.

Next time, I won&#39;t be so quick to say &#34;let&#39;s just grab a cup of Joe&#34;!"

I always have a hard time choosing between any of their chicken dishes or the surf and turf with the grouper/medallions combo. This time I went with the lobster bisque and chicken giardiniera which were both good!

We could do without the sales pitch for the wine club as that is something we&#39;ll never be interested in but they keep trying to sell it to us - there needs to be a way to kindly tell the server we&#39;re not interested. 

My only complaint is the wine tasting area. Too small. If you&#39;re not &#34;bellied up to the bar&#34;, you&#39;re just not going to be served. I&#39;ve felt this way each time we&#39;ve been here. I would ask the management to decide what is more important - wine tasting or shop? I&#39;m wondering if the sales area could be eliminated or reduced to make room for more tasting counters.

Great food, great wine (I&#39;m mostly a beer and whisky person, so to get me to drink wine means you&#39;ve impressed my taste buds!), and great service. Eliminate the wine club sales pitch at dinner, please, and try something different for the crowds gathered around the tasting area."

The food is fabulous, the servers are pleasant, and the atmosphere is wonderful. As far as the wine goes, I can only say I liked the moscato. I&#39;m in the same boat as Amy R.; now that I&#39;m in my thirties, I&#39;ve tried to like wine. I really have. And I mean, on my first visit here, I felt so awkward sipping from a bottle of beer. I almost felt ashamed. But it is what it is. I love beer and beer loves me. Wine just isn&#39;t gonna happen.

Moving on. You receive a warm roll of pretzel bread once you&#39;re seated. That bread alone is reason enough to come to CH. It&#39;s all to easy to fill up on that, though.
We always order the crab cakes for an appetizer. The mustard sauce and Asian slaw they serve with the crab cakes is nothing short of phenomenal. 

One of my favorite dishes is the Angel Hair  Neapolitano. It comes with Fresh Garlic, Chili Flakes, Chicken, Broccoli, San Marzano Tomato Sauce, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil. It&#39;s just amazing; the chicken is cooked perfectly and the chili flakes give it just enough of a kick to bring your taste buds alive. The Chicken Piccata isn&#39;t bad either.

Our server was Gary (I believe) and he was truly wonderful. He was attentive and checked up on us often. On our other visits, we&#39;ve had equally great servers, luckily. 

Make a reservation, unless you&#39;re a fan of 45+ minute wait times. Parking can be a pain unless you go the valet route."

I really enjoy being a part of the Wine Club; however, I am considering cancelling my membership because I find it hard to use the free wine tastings. Even though some of the locations have built bigger bars to accommodate the crowds, I have had to wait 45 minutes before in order to grab a spot at the counter. Last time I was there I saw two women almost get into a fight over a spot! While it might seem tacky I feel like a ticketing system might be beneficial. Unfortunately I watch rude people constantly come in and push their way in front of people even when it&#39;s obvious others have been waiting patiently. It does not make me want to come in and use the tastings which is unfortunate because I use the tastings as a way to try new wines that I would have previously passed up!"

Once to Barrington, twice here. The last time at this place, the experience was just ok. I figured, we&#39;ll go again, knowing my wife likes the wine.

The food, however, leaves little to be desired.
The shrimp appetizer - not good. I understand we are not on the ocean, but the shrimp were very tough, as if they were cooked frozen. 

When it came time to order, all three of the dishes I wanted were &#34;removed off of the menu.&#34; But the menu wasn&#39;t going to be updated until tomorrow. Ok. I&#39;ll get the same chicken dish I had before. When my food comes, it turns out the waitress brought a similiar dish, but not what I ordered. Because guess what? My dish was also off the menu. So why would you bring something I didn&#39;t order? Then, I was told it would be 25 mins before I could get my food- and the manager wasn&#39;t apologetic.

Everything I tried was overly salty and lacked real flavor. For the price, and the area, I would expect better. If quality ingredients are used, you dont need to cover everything in salt. This is just an over priced wine bar with mediocre food. I will never come back here.

Advice to owners: use less salt in your food. Also, turn down the music. How can a fine dining restaurant have such loud music? Third, act like you actually care when there Is a problem, especially when your staff causes it."

The interior is classy and spacious, with a focus on wine and wine related retail. I&#39;ve tried so hard, now that I&#39;m 30, to get into wine like my other, more sophisticated friends, but I just can&#39;t love it (or any alcoholic bevs, truth be told. It&#39;s hell to get old). Though my peeps in the know say the wine here is fabulous. They have giant barrels of their house wine all about the entrance, and offer decanters of certain selections for table side pouring, which looks fun.

As could be said is the case for most things in my life, I&#39;m in it for the food, and the food here does not disappoint. Though they took my all-time favorite item off the menu (RIP, fried green tomato club sandwich), I&#39;ve always managed to find something delicious on the menu to enjoy. This past visit I got the blue cheese wedge salad, which was like the PERFECT combo of a chopped salad and a wedge, covered in blue cheese, a vinaigrette, and tomato. I also got the prime rib sandwich with fries for lunch. The fries are whatever but the prime sandwich was SO good - thinly sliced prime rib piled high on a roll with seasoned mayo, and au jus + horseradish cream for dipping. I normally don&#39;t dig ju but I tried both and they were fantastic! The horseradish cream wasn&#39;t too spicy but very flavorful. 

As if that weren&#39;t a big enough pile of food, we also ordered the banana bread ice cream sandwich for dessert which was two slices of thick warm banana bread around roasted bananas, a VERY boozy flavored caramel sauce, and vanilla ice cream. It was wonderful, but very heavy. 

I don&#39;t crave Cooper&#39;s Hawk every day and it won&#39;t be the best meal I&#39;ve ever eaten, but for a chain restaurant, they really do surpass the expected standard for cuisine and have a nice fresh take on a varied menu. Definitely worth returning to."

The white sangria we had was very tasty. With that being said our meal could have been better. The calamari was good but I felt our entrees could have had better presentation and less salt. I ordered the grilled churasco skirt steak. It was cooked the way I like it at medium well but man was it salty. Also the roasted veggies it came with seemed to have been just slopped on the plate and were average at best since it was mostly carrots. Next, the Parmasean fries were below average. I definitely have had better. 

My wife ordered from the life balance section. She had the two medallions with veggies. Her meat looked burnt though she noted veggies were good and meat looked worst than it tasted which was okay.  

We regret not saying anything to management but at the moment I just didn&#39;t feel like complaining. Overall the dining experience was average nothing special.

I have been to this location, as well as the one in Burr Ridge. Both times I have loved my experience and the food. For this review, though, I will obviously focus on my Naperville experience.

I came here with a group of girls to celebrate a friend&#39;s birthday. We met at 7 on a Friday night to do the wine tasting. We also wanted to stay for dinner and didn&#39;t make reservations, but it actually worked out! We put our name in when we got there, did the wine tasting for about an hour and a half and then our table was ready!

Like other reviewers have said, you definitely do not need to be a wine lover to come here. They have so many other delicious cocktails to choose from. But the wine tasting is worth it for sure. For $6 they give you 8 different wines and good portions, too.

The food. Oh my gosh, the food is divine! From the pretzel bread while you wait, to the dessert right before you leave. So delicious! I ordered the salmon, I do not remember what it was called on the menu, and I also tried my sister&#39;s Pork Medallions. Everything tastes so good and comes out hot.

The service is also great! For a table with as many as we had, the waiter had no problem at all giving us each a separate check. Usually they seem inconvenienced when you ask. Our food came out in a timely manner and everyone got exactly what they ordered.

Cooper&#39;s Hawk is my favorite chain restaurant, hands down!"

We started with the appetizer beet salad and pesto Caesar salad both were amazing. Of course the pretzel bread is always amazing too! My mom got the short rib risotto which she loved(a little salty but good flavor) I had the Parmesan crusted chicken good a little to fried for me but great plate presentation, and the tomatoes on it tastes like they came fresh from a garden. Finished off with s&#39;mores dessert and the toffee banana tart that was beyond amazing! I have to say out sever a older gentleman was beyond awesome. Sorry I forgot to get his name. I heard him at all his tables he was so informative on the menu and didn&#39;t rush anyone. He went through all the wines and specials but he just seemed to really like his job! I am a general manager and it&#39;s really refreshing to enjoy great service like he provided."

The menu has a good selection of appetizers, lighter calorie selections, gluten free options and meals from pastas and sandwiches to pork chops and steak.  There is a wine store as you walk in, a small bakery counter and a tasting area. There is also a large bar area, outdoor patio and large main dining room.  They have a good selection of wine. However, I did not enjoy their sauvignon blanc - I didn&#39;t drink it as it was not enjoyable as a New Zealand or Australian sauvignon blanc. They serve a warm pretzel bread upon being seated which is a nice treat.  My husband ordered the Parmesan crusted grouper served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The fish was moist and flaky, so good.  I had the ahi tuna served with Asian slaw and rice. The tuna was seared to perfection and was sushi grade. I always enjoy their Asian slaw. One of my favorite sides there.  I love their tuna tacos, drunken shrimp and cheese tray as well. Our server Dan was friendly and provided good service. It was an enjoyable meal dining al fresco. I do recommend reservations especially on the weekend nights."

I do have to say that my friend and I thought the Drunken Mexican Shrimp was amazing.  I like shrimp on occasion, and my friend doesn&#39;t even like shrimp, but he thought it was phenomenal!  I also ordered the parmesan-crusted chicken.  I had to take some home with me because I wasn&#39;t able to finish it all!

This is just another one of those places that I happened to stumble upon when we were on our way to go to cascade outdoor movie theater. 
  You are not going to see billboards, flashy lights, etc. in order for you to find this place. Just a yelp review : )
  When my wife and I were in the area, she happened to suggest checking out yelp to see if there was any places located around us to eat.
 That is how I had located Zenwich. So thank you fellow yelpers. 
 When we entered their location. Again nothing flashy just a order menu with some pretty interesting sandwiches. 
 I ordered the Korean cheese steak. When I took a bite into that sandwich, I noticed my mouth like one of those cheesy commercials you see on tv, going crazy with excitement. 
 This sandwich is #$*@ Good!. It was so good I had to order another. And then also one to go. Don&#39;t judge me ; ) 
 What can I say.  When you find something you like, you seem to buy more : ) 
 So if you are in the area, I can only advise to stop here and try one of their sandwiches. I am quite positive that you will not be disappointed. I know that we were not. 

Thanks Yelpers!"

I LOVE bahn mi sandwiches but have had a hard time finding a good / fresh bahn mi in the suburbs (and the city too sometimes). This place is perfect when I get a craving for bahn mi, even though it&#39;s a bit more asian fusion. But don&#39;t let that discourage you! The outside is very unassuming (it&#39;s in a strip mall) but these sandwiches are some of the best bahn mi style sandwiches I have ever had. I tried the shrimp one and my mom tried the chicken satay one. We were both blown away. The sandwiches were warm, bread was so fluffy and soft, and tons of fresh veggies. The shrimp looked fresh too. 

I almost forgot: they have these homemade &#34;chips&#34; with an amazing seasoning on them! YUM!

The flavors will knock your socks off! Prices are not bad either - about $8 bucks for a sandwich. Think outside the box and try this version of bahn mi. You won&#39;t be disappointed!"

I&#39;m so sad to report but, Zenwich is NOT all that... :(

Yes, they have a wide variety of Vegetarian and Vegan options which is a total plus and made me want to eat there but...The meal was mediocre at best. 

Kinda felt like the excitement was gone from the space and whoever was cooking, was just &#34;going through the motions.&#34; :(

Sandwich, was barely warm and the fries we&#39;re not freshly cut, seemed like diner fries and we&#39;re 100% soggy. :(

Hoping it was just an &#34;off&#34; day for the place and the cooks."

When I heard about the spicy garlic sandwich it sounded like an Asian style po boy and I knew I had to try it.  Everything about it was great.  Lightly battered, plump shrimp smothered with their sauce in some incredibly soft ciabatta bread.  I also had half of the mu ping sandwich and while it was also amazing, the shrimp did have the slight edge.  I ALMOST went back for dinner and got another shrimp sammy but decided against it.  The chips and ginger cole slaw were pretty decent but weren&#39;t anything that really stole my taste buds away from the sandwich.  The chips were plain for me and the slaw was a little too sweet and saucy.  It would be cool if they could do sweet potato fries.  Regardless, the sandwiches are definitely worth everyone trying and are my new food obsession!"

From the outside, Zenwich is very unassuming. I would say the inside as well. It is quite small--would probably fit 20 people max. When I looked at the menu, I knew this place had to be great! Zenwich offers Asian fusion in the form of sandwiches. They range from Thai, to Chinese, to Japanese, or even Korean! 

We came on a Saturday afternoon and it was moderately busy. I chose the Spicy Garlic Shrimp while my boyfriend had the Spicy Basil Chicken that was a special that day. I subbed the chips for cucumber salad, while he subbed his chips for wasabi coleslaw. To sub, it is 50¢ extra! The total for two sandwiches was around $20. Our sandwiches came out within 5 minutes and everyone is so friendly there!

Overall, we really enjoyed our visit and would definitely come back. I like that every sandwich comes with a side and a pickle (: My boyfriend and I both agreed that our sandwiches lacked some sort of crunch or sourness--I guess that&#39;s what our sides are for! My Spicy Garlic Shrimp was delicious, especially with its arugula; however, I would have really enjoyed if they seasoned the batter for their shrimp. The sandwich was chock full of yummy shrimp with spicy aioli, but the shrimp itself was in desperate need of seasoning."

Well not exactly Italian bread, but it&#39;s probably how I would describe it to anyone that hasn&#39;t been here yet. I tend to like places more when no one knows anything about it vs. places that have 200+ reviews simple because I&#39;m usually disappointed as it seems more overrated. 

As of this moment only tried the Crab Cake Sandwich, Pork Katsu Sandwich, and Spicy Garlic Shrimp Sandwich. Would order all three again. $8.50ish sandwich that now comes with chips. (use to be $7.50ish with no chips) I came on Saturday afternoon possible around 2 and although not standing out the door. Had to walk out as there was no place to stand without being in front/behind someone that was already eating.

I got a delicious tofu-katsu sandwich. No problem there. The issue was my wife ordered first and had to repeat her order three times to the woman at the register. My daughter then ordered her sandwich with unseasoned fries. I then ordered my sandwich, also with unseasoned fries. The woman stared blankly at me after I gave her my order and said &#34;sorry I just totally spaced out. What did you want?&#34; So I repeated it.  Five minutes later our orders are brought to the table. Both my daughter and I get our sandwiches with seasoned chips, not unseasoned fries. Shouldn&#39;t be a big deal, right?

We let the server know and she took away our sandwiches with the chips and the woman behind the counter asked what was wrong and we both said we ordered unseasoned fries. She was confused. We reminded her we had to repeat our orders multiple times and she just must have made a mistake to which she replied &#34;fries will be $2 extra.&#34; Okay. So I get out my wallet and she says it&#39;ll be $5.50 or some amount close to that. I was now confused and asked &#34;but you said the fries are $2 extra. She replied that it&#39;s $2 extra per order IF we get the fries with the sandwich but if we order them after, they&#39;re $2.50 each. Huh? We did order them with our sandwiches we said. &#34;Well that order is closed now, so I have to put it in as a new order.&#34; She saw nothing wrong with this crazy logic.

I gave up and said, please just give us some chips, at this point our sandwiches are getting cold. 

I noticed as we left that there was a Help Wanted sign in the window. I hope the management gets some better help or at least can do some very basic training for the help they already have. The sandwich was good but the service was laughable. And we were the only customers there, so it&#39;s not like they were busy."

I went with my friend Courtney C., who&#39;s been here a few times and said everything was delicious.  I ordered the Pork Katsu, a fried pork cutlet with coleslaw, watercress, a tangy sauce and mustard, served on a toasty bun.  This sandwich was so flavorful for...a sandwich!  I don&#39;t know if the bread is homemade, but the bread is yummy and the ideal size for containing all of the sandwich ingredients.  I like the Asian-inspired spin on the food here.

Sandwiches are served with chips &amp; pickle, but watch out - those chips are spicy!  I like spicy food, but these were a bit much for me.  

You can eat here, but there is a limited amount of tables.  It was super busy when we were here, on a Monday, at 2-3pm!  I&#39;m not sure what this looks like during the lunch rush, probably a lot of to-go orders.  Food comes out fast, but not super fast, since they cook your food as you order it.

Lunch here was very affordable, my sandwich and a drink came out to about $11 and it&#39;s far superior to all of the chain sandwich shops nearby."

First off they didn&#39;t answer for an entire 10 minutes I tried calling while driving there during my lunch. What&#39;s the point of having a phone. Sadly the phones were being answered when I was there.  I didn&#39;t even try the online system bc last time I used it, I still waited for my food.

Second, I got there &amp; I ordered 2 sandwiches for take out, I sat down and checked in with yelp and waited... 20 mins later w still no food the manager tells me your food  will be right up while he&#39;s walking out..( Lol.. I sure hope so!) but then a guy walks in &amp; orders a garlic shrimp sandwich and 5 mins later his order was done. I thought I was getting punked or somthing. I walk up to the counter and tell them I&#39;ve been waiting for 25 mins(for 2 sandwiches!) and I notice the cashier get my food that was sitting at the back counter the entire time. Worse part the guy with cauliflower ears tell me that it just came out. I would have believed him had my sandwich been hot. But it was lukewarm if that since I had to eat in my car driving back to work to make it on time. 

How does a guy order the same sandwich I did but waits 5 minutes but I had to wait 25 minutes?  I WILL NOT ever step into this location again. Zero stars for doing me bogus today."

The Chicken Satay Zenwich was delicious and fuses all that is good about satay and puts it into a tasty sandwich...it&#39;s topped w daikon, carrot, cucumber, red onion, jalapeno and drizzled with a light peanut sauce.

I ordered the third most popular item on the menu (didn&#39;t know that at the time)

I read a review about the Satay Sandwich and and have been jonesing for it ever since... I was sure that it couldn&#39;t live up to my expectations. I&#39;ve been talking about going there and that sandwich for so long that my wife Lisa was just as stoked.

Approached with trepidation...

Exceeded expectations... That was one of my (and Lisa&#39;s) favorite sandwiches of all time. Awesome , The owner came over and talked to us for a while, his newplace in downtown Chicago is doing well.. a really nice guy.

So my sandwich came with some spiced potato chips (sure I&#39;d love fries, but the chips were really good) and a regular pickle.

Even though it&#39;s only the third most popular.. I can&#39;t see myself getting anything else I loved it so much.

For those that would like to know the even more popular sandwiches.. The Garlic Shrimp and the Crab Cake Sandwiches are the ultimate big sellers..  but I&#39;m feeling pretty good about my third place explosion of flavor.

It&#39;s a small, casual place.. not super comfortable... iridescent green walls.. but, in my opinion .. just about perfect!"

1.  Gps locate this place - it is in a small strip mall and can be missed
2.  Be prepared to chill.  This place isn&#39;t about fancy interior - it is about a well prepared sandwich you will remember ... Pretense needs to be left at home or in your tesla
3.  Staff-  I have no idea who owns this place but they recruit well.  I was greeted, time was taken to talk to me about what was great about what I was ordering.  So personable and inviting.
4.  Food -  this isn&#39;t your average sandwich shop but it also isn&#39;t extreme.  Anyone can order food here - it isn&#39;t complicated but it also isn&#39;t subway.  Talk to the staff, read through the well described menu- I have to return because there are several sandwiches I&#39;m interested in. 
Basically- go to this place.  If you are local to Elmhurst you have no excuse ... If you are not  -it is right off the expressway.  Easy peasy"

After seeing this place pop up on yelp searches over and over again, we decided it was time to take the plunge. We went on a Sunday and there was ample parking and minimal waiting. We stepped up to the counter and had a few ideas about what we wanted. We ordered a Chicken Satay sandwich and a Garlic Shrimp sandwich. Both came with homemade chips. Prices were $8-$10 per sandwich. 

Garlic Shrimp: This little pocket of heaven was delicious, very garlicky, very generous amount of perfectly seasoned shrimp 9/10 

Chicken Satay: This sandwich fell WAY short of the garlic shrimp offering, the flavors were bland, there was no pop to this bad boy at all. It needed more curry and some sort of cilantro aioli. 4/10 

Homemade chips: the chips were nice and crunchy but the seasoning salt was very unevenly distributed, some of the chips were salt licks and others had very little flavor. 

At the end of the day I probably won&#39;t be back to Zenwich, but if I do find myself back there I would try different offerings for sure."

Everything looks sooo good but the spicy garlic shrimp sandwich in the rice paper (like a spring roll wrapper) is so delicious I can never seem to order anything else. The menu is great for gluten-free folks and vegetarians, too. Chips have a great spice blend on them that you won&#39;t find anywhere else. This is not going to be drive-through speed and it&#39;s not supposed to be, so keep that in mind if you&#39;re heading there during a busy lunch hour. I love this place!"

Of course it is located in a tiny hole of a restaurant in a strip mall. Enter, order at counter, get number, be seated. I got the pork sandwich, which was basically a take on a bahn mi. It was excellent. Husband got the curry beef sandwich. It had great flavor but was very messy. The shrimp seems to be a really popular option, will probably try that next time. Seating is self-serve and very limited. During peak times the tables are all filled, but they seem to turn over quickly. Will definitely be back!"

Usually I&#39;m not a big sandwich fan because they typically don&#39;t fill me up and I&#39;d rather get something meatier for the price. However, Zenwich did have an interesting menu with an Asian fusion approach to their sandwiches. 

Just like other suburban gems, Zenwich is in the middle of a random strip mall. The space isn&#39;t that big, with maybe 3 or 4 tables and then a small counter space against the wall with around 4 more stools. It seemed like most of the people were taking their orders to go. You order at the counter and they warn you that every sandwich is made to order, so it could take 5-10 minutes to prepare. The guy who rang me up seemed to the be the owner and he was pretty cool. He was giving suggestions about the menu and was just generally making some small talk. He hand delivered all the sandwiches to the tables and I noticed him checking up on everyone to make sure they enjoyed the food. 

I ended up getting the spicy garlic shrimp zenwich. Seeing the words spicy and garlic next to each other on a menu is usually a sure-fire sign of a solid choice. Although I didn&#39;t think it was really that spicy or even had a strong garlic flavor, I still thought it was pretty tasty. The first thing that jumps out at you is the sauce that came in the sandwich. It was kinda like a mild Asian styled ranch sauce, and it was super creamy with just the slightest kick of spice. The shrimp was lightly breaded and fried, and surprisingly there was a decent amount of it in the sandwich. Even though there was a ton of aioli in there, the shrimp flavor still came through. The ciabatta bread was soft in the middle with a crisp crust, while the arugula and cilantro added a nice freshness to the sandwich. Together it kind of had that salad sandwich vibe going on. It also came with homemade chips, which were a nice surprise. Whenever I have a choice between fries and chips, I always go with the fries. These chips though were crispy and had a unique spice seasoning on it (with just the slightest hint of sweetness), which I really liked. 

Overall, it was a pretty solid sandwich. I was slightly disappointed that it was a little weak in the garlic department, but maybe I&#39;m the oddball that wants garlic so strong your breath stank. The total came out to be around $10, so it&#39;s up there in terms of price for a medium sized sandwich, but they do have quality ingredients and original flavors to make it worth it."

Or maybe it&#39;s because, living in Chicagoland, we are spoiled with having so many great sandwich shops on top of all the other amazing dining options...that I guess I just wasn&#39;t amazed. 

What was good? The cheesesteak sandwich was very good. They make a coconut milk based salsa for the sandwich that they mix right there when you ask for it. So the sandwich did have a very fresh taste to it, and it was moderately filling. Good stuff. My wife had the chicken teriyaki sandwich which was good. It was mostly cucumber and other vegetables, but it was a good, light, sandwich. 

What wasn&#39;t so good? The fried calamari appetizer. It isn&#39;t fresh calamari. Take it or leave it. Also...the price. I&#39;m not a cheapskate when it comes to dining out. I have no problem dropping serious coin on a seriously good meal. Two sandwiches, an appetizer, a bottled water (yes...you have to purchase water here) and a root beer was $30. Again...don&#39;t get me wrong...$15/pp isn&#39;t a bad price for dinner. That&#39;s not the problem. But again...in Chicagoland where we are spoiled with amazing delis that will get you a great sandwich &amp; soft drink for $5...it&#39;s just hard to pay triple that and not come away feeling like, &#34;meh&#34;. 

If I&#39;m in the area and hungry I would go back. There is a beef curry sandwich that sounds good. Nice people run this business...and that&#39;s a plus. I like giving my business to nice business owners."

I had heard of Zenwich before, but really did not understand the hype until I walked in there for lunch - the line was out the door! Now, it&#39;s not a very big place to begin with (a lot of people seemed to be placing orders to go), but luckily my group snagged a seat in the midst of the hustle and bustle.

Their menu includes a load of delicious options so choosing one was definitely hard. But hey, more reason to go back and dive into the rest of the menu, am I right?

I ended up going with the ROI (Chicken Teriyaki) sandwich (or shall I say ZENwich) and it was AMAZE-balls. The delicious-ness between those two pieces of bread included grilled chicken, lettuce, grilled onion and mushroom with wasabi infused teriyaki sauce and honey mustard. Need I say more?

They have a few different sides to choose from to accompany your sandwich. I went with the cucumber salad which was excellent - fresh and delicious to say the least. I of course also welcomed a pickle spear on the side (for good measure of course). 

If you&#39;re looking for a whole new foodie adventure, these asian inspired sandwiches are the way to go!"

First of all, if you haven&#39;t figured it out from other reviews, this place is teeny tiny. Yet don&#39;t be dissuaded if you can&#39;t grab a seat at one of the five tables. Just snag your sandwich and get the hell out. Second, I don&#39;t think you can go wrong with whatever you order. I personally went with the Chicken Satay Zenwich with my side of choice being the cucumber salad. To say it was delicious is putting it mildly. Twas just the right mix of flavorful chicken, shredded carrots, tons o&#39; veggies and thin (housemade) peanut sauce. 

You can grab a bottled beverage while you wait for your surely awesome Zenwich. Nom-namaste for everyone (h/t to Danny W)."

Driving past, you really wouldn&#39;t think to maybe stop here.  The sign is faded, it&#39;s located in a little strip mall and seating in limited.  But don&#39;t let that stop you from tasting this hidden gem. Asian inspired ingredients paired perfectly with fresh bread will always have your taste buds going for a ride.  Highly recommend the Famous Remus, Bryanism and the Crab Cake Sandwich.  My friend who is vegetarian, tried the Tofu Ping and said the tofu was prepared perfectly. Their Wasbai coleslaw or seasoned chips gives you the perfect crunch and heat that your sandwich needs for a sidekick.  I&#39;m actually okay with the fact that they don&#39;t offer a lot of options on their menu - it&#39;s just enough to showcase their undeniable craft and passion.  

Highly recommended."

Their sandwiches are the most satisfying lunch you could ask for. HIGHLY recommend the Spicy Garlic Shrimp, Pork Katsu, and the Mu Ping. And the Korean BBQ beef!! I absolutely adore their home made chips, as well as the wasabi cole slaw. I could go on for days. I usually have to save half of my sandwich for later in the afternoon - which always gives me something to look forward to around 3pm.

It&#39;s so sad because this place used to be so amazing; dare I even say life changing. I&#39;m going to send an email to let them know, but things have definitely changed in the quality of the food. They upped their prices - which I could care less about since their sandwiches are pretty gourmet and extremely filling. However, their quality went down as they upped their prices. That don&#39;t make no sense to me.

I have no problem paying $9 for one of their sandwiches - I&#39;m just so saddened by the deteriorating quality they&#39;re currently putting out.

I always get either the crab cake sandwich or the spicy shrimp. Before the shrimp used to be so fresh and CRISPY. Now it&#39;s just soggy breading around cold shrimp. I&#39;ve ordered twice since I felt like the quality went down and each time it&#39;s been poor. 

I can&#39;t leave a one star review because I truly do love this place. I&#39;m just really sad to see - from what is seems - that the owners have abandoned their Elmhurst location. Please don&#39;t let that happen Zenwich!

EDIT:
They gave me a free meal. It was still kinda cold, but I love zenwich so much that I can&#39;t just leave them a mediocre review. They really are a one of a kind asian infusion sandwich shop - AND I&#39;M ASIAN."

The location is in a strip mall and has a smallish interior.  It seems most folks took take out orders, but a few - like us - stayed and enjoyed our dinner.  The owner was very nice - he not only explained the menu to us, but showed us sizes that helped us decide what to order/what we could share.  He also chatted with my +1 at the end of the night and, even though we accidentally stayed a little past closing - was chatty and welcoming.

We ordered the calamari strips to share.  I really enjoyed the crust and how large they were (I&#39;d only had calamari slices before).  The sauce was delicious!

After much deliberation (and some apprehension about just HOW spicy the tofu might be..), I ordered the Crabby Yola (crab cake) sandwich. It had a nice blend of flavors, especially with the baby greens and basil sauce.  Knowing it wouldn&#39;t keep well without getting soggy the next day, I forced my +1 to finish the rest of it with me! :)  

My +1 got the ROI (Chicken Teriyaki). The flavors were good, but I think the chicken was a tad on the dry side.  The ginger slaw was OK (a bit runnier than I like), but I really enjoyed the home made chips - they had a great spice!

The owner gave me a stamp card for my next visits.  I&#39;ll have to come back and try the Wasabi Coleslaw and also see when they have a special on Spicy Tofu, since I&#39;m feeling brave! :)"

I&#39;m not a fan of anything too hot and this was the perfect balance of sweet and heat. The other sandwich I tried is nothing to sneeze at. I got the pork katsu and that was seriously delicious. My one complaint was that the place was way to small for the amount of customers they receive, so be careful if you are planning on eating there; avoid the mad lunch rush.

I was looking for a place near O&#39;hare to eat and couldn&#39;t resist checking this place after reading all the great reviews.  The restaurant is located in a small strip mall next to a convenient store.  The inside is small with enough seating for about 20 people.  When the weather is cold, it&#39;s a bit chilly inside.  I guess you can say, it&#39;s a &#34;cool&#34; place to eat.

The boards on the wall showed weekly specials and soup of the day.  There are also pictures of the sandwiches on the other side of the wall.  There&#39;s a sign that says the shop is a gourmet sandwich shop and the food is made to order.  I&#39;ve been here a few times and tried the following:

CRABBY YOLA - $8 - &#34;Japanese style panko crusted homemade crab cake and baby greens topped with homemade creamy garlic basil aioli.&#34; This was pretty delicious.  The crab cakes had great texture (slightly crunchy on the outside) and flavors.  The sandwiches some with a pickle and a choice of a side.

ROI - $8 - &#34;Grilled chicken, lettuce, grilled onion and mushroom with wasabi infused teriyaki sauce and honey mustard.&#34;  I tried a bite of this and it was good.  Rarely am I in the mood for a chicken sandwich, so this is not something I would order.

Famous Remu - $8 - &#34;Grilled caramelized pork, shredded carrot and daiko, cucumber, red.&#34;  This one reminded me a lot of the Vietnamese sandwich (banh mi).  It was fresh and delicious.

SEASONED CHIPS - Kinda BBQish and some other flavors.  Pretty addicting.
PORK SESAME MISO SOUP - $2.50 - Pretty good, has characteristics similar to beef stew with a miso twist.

VEGETABLE TEMPURA -  I&#39;m not sure what kind of vegetables were deep fried, but it was good.  The sauce was on the sweet side, which I normally don&#39;t like, but it went very well with the vegetables.

CALAMARI STRIPS - $4 - This was good with the dipping sauce that came with it.  Crispy on the outside and not so chewy on the inside.

The service was fast and friendly!"

I could not believe that the husband wanted to eat here because he is generally very picky about what goes on his sandwich and hates sauce.

So order ahead.  Ordering online is sublime - great easy system.  Here&#39;s the good:  sandwiches  are very tasty. In fact, the first time I tried the Chicken Satay it was like to die for. I went back a week later and tried another sandwich, and while it too was so good, I thought the sauce tasted pretty much the same which disappointed me. Here&#39;s the not so good: their signature seasoned chips are not all that great because they seem a bit damp or something.  I have had them several times and would pass them up in a heartbeat. Next, $2 for a 12 ounce bottled water? WHAT? That is just wrong!  Kids meals - pass them up.  YUCK - they cut off the crust on WHITE BREAD and plop on chicken and some sauce which gets soaked up in the bread.  I wasted $9 on two kids sandwiches that came with soggy cold french fries. Never order the kids meals.  I thought they would be smaller versions of the full sized sandwiches but not true.  Finally, while the sandwiches are really overall really nice and tasty @ roughly $9 that is just too much to pay.  I would prefer to go up the street across from Mariano&#39;s and get real Thai take out for the same price."

I had the GF spicy shrimp in a rice paper wrap (of course you can get it on bread instead of a paper wrap) and it was so awesome! I called back the restaurant to check if the shrimp was gluten free because the &#34;breading&#34; on it sure did not seem like it. They said it is GF and is coated with corn flour.  The shrimp was perfectly crisp with a nice creamy garlic spice mayo type sauce with a lot of greens packed in it. It also came with a pickle and homemade potato chips.  I will def be back to try other items on this really interesting cross-cultural menu:)

We were in area and dropped in for an afternoon snack.  The Mu Ping sandwich and the chips went for $7.75.  The place is no frills, small (maybe 20 seats) and slightly pricey, but you are getting great quality and freshness here.  The homemade chips were really addictive and had a very tasty homemade seasoning (sugar and cinnamon were amongst the flavorings I tasted).  The aioli sauce on the sandwich was surprisingly a little runny but didn&#39;t really detract from anything.  I found about all the homemade stuff from chatting a little with Nate, the friendly Thai owner who started this business 5.5 years ago with his wife.   They just recently opened their second store in the city on Van Buren.  If you&#39;re looking for good Asian fusion sandwiches, I would highly recommend.

You can really tell that he takes pride in his food, and is very hands on in all aspects of the restaurant. Very friendly.

We got the spicy shrimp sandwich and the korean beef sandwich. Both were $9. The korean beef was a little lackluster. Not bad at all, don&#39;t get me wrong, but imagine some beef stir fry between some bread, and you&#39;ve got your korean beef sandwich. 

The spicy shrimp sandwich was spectacular however. Have you ever had the bang bang shrimp at Bonefish? It kind of reminds me of that but better. You get some nice big shrimp and this zingy aioli that just sets it over the top. An absolute must have. 

All sandwiches come with a pickle spear and house made chips, which are fantastic. They put some sugar and spice on them, a very good touch.

Don&#39;t sleep on this place! Its great!"

I ordered the chicken satay and my husband had the tofu satay. We both enjoyed our sandwich very much - it was fresh and flavorful. I tried a bite of his sandwich and felt that mine had a better flavor overall, however. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because of the difference in how the spices and sauce get absorbed by the chicken vs the tofu or what. He agreed mine tasted better as well.

The pickle spear was fresh and the homemade seasoned chips were definitely different than just regular chips. I tasted a hint of cinnamon and sweet potato in them.

Since this place is so small and busy we took our meal to nearby Wilder Park and had a little picnic lunch. I highly recommend doing this on a nice day.

But on Friday night, my wife was hanging out with some friends in the western suburbs.  So on Saturday around lunchtime I was planning to meet up with them for lunch.  I suggested somewhere in Elmhurst as it was close enough between our houses.  The first place we looked into was closed so I suggested Zenwich.

When we got there I was surprised it was a little store front in a strip mall.  But I wasn&#39;t going to judge that.  So we enter the restaurant and look at the menu.  It was really hard to come to a decision/conclusion on what we would order.  After spending a few minutes it seemed like my wife and I were going to split two sandwiches.  We did the Korean cheese steak and some braised pork sandwich.

The Korean cheese steak was amazing.  There really is no easy way to describe it (it tastes like bulgogi and a cheese steak at the same time).  Just get it"

I am in the industry, overseeing multiple fine dining restaurants, and this experience was an absolute joke.  Would be zero stars if it was permitted.

 Ordered carry out, and specifically ordered bone in chicken vesuvio.  The last 2 times it has been.boneless chicken breasts.  The baked clams taste like they have been steamed open, then frozen, them cooked again.  Rubberbands are an understatement.

 When I called to inform the so called manager, he stayed there is nothing he can do as he has a dining room full of guests. Apparently the guests you just messed up with has little importance to this establishment.

 Will never be back, you just lost a regular customer.  Food mistakes happen, service mistakes happen.  Over cooked items happen, but when you have an opportunity to fix what was wrong, and you choose to ignore and HANG UP on a customer, well there is reason for that.

There was only 1 table before us.   We waited about 25 minutes for our entree. 

We loved, loved, loved the Rotolo with vodka sauce.  The spinach and ricotta filling was creamy. The Aliano&#39;s Chopped Salad was good.  The salad was ample size.  

Everything on their menu sounds so good.  We&#39;ll return but it is far from our house so we won&#39;t be able to go very often."

Theyre a great family and do a lot for the town but seriously waiting 20 mins and no one can even take a drink order or claim to be our server is ridiculous. 
We left and went to Francescas. The food is mediocre at best, the service is tragic and really with that much competition around the area they need to do a better job."

Not completely sure why (she did look at their menu online and deduced that because they had red meat, chicken, etc, I&#39;d be ok), but with me being VERY finicky and basically a &#34;plain&#34; type person (I don&#39;t like a lot of &#34;crap&#34; like sauces, seasonings, garnishment, or other &#34;contamination&#34; such as vegetables), going to fancier places just isn&#39;t something we do.  So again, why she picked this place, I dunno.

Anyway, enjoyed messing around with Mother Catherine (I think that was her name), when we first arrived.  We got seated right away.  Our waitress was great, albeit service was a little slow (not her fault in any way/shape/form).

Again, I reiterate, I am not into fancy things and am VERY picky when it comes to eating, much less liking specific ethnic foods, so Italian surely isn&#39;t one of them that is tops on my list.  So after reading the menu, my choice was steak or pizza.  It ended up being pizza for all (My mother who was with us is much like me too).  I didn&#39;t go with steak because I wish restaurants would understand... A MAN wants a steak!  Not a paltry 12 ounce bite of red meat.  A 12oz steak to me is a snack.  Not even an appetizer!  So I certainly wasn&#39;t going to pay $30+ for a snack.  If it were a big, two pound, three pound, or more slab or red meat beauty, I&#39;ll pay for it, not 12 ounces!  Gimme a steak that it&#39;s thickness is measured in inches and hangs over the plate it&#39;s on, and a baked potato the size of a football and I&#39;m happy as a clam!  But back on point...

Anyway, the pizza WAS excellent, but I feel like a melon-farmer ordering a pizza in a more &#34;upscale&#34; joint.  Obviously other patrons there were on dates, a family get together, or more intimate affairs, and eating more high end &#34;crap&#34; (as I will call it), so me ordering a &#34;pie&#34; looks a little odd."

(This dish is a rare find in a typical Italian restaurant.) my daughters and I love the gnocchi with arrabiatta sauce. Yum!
The service is slow, but that&#39;s how Italians do restaurants. The meal is an event to gather and converse with family; eat multiple courses and have a glass of wine or two. The bonus is there is usually a yelp, groupon or Amazon deal offered, too. Cute atmosphere, great food, friendly service. Batavians don&#39;t appreciate a true Italian experience. I&#39;m sure Olive Garden would get better reviews from them.

We when you go to a restaurant you are looking for two things, good food and good service.  We had heard good things about  Aliano&#39;s so we expected both.  Unfortunately we were disappointed because of the service.
Our server, although nice enough, preferred to talk more than serving her customers.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, exchanging brief conversations is a friendly way to interact and create a pleasant experience.  But I really do not need to know what she did the previous day and who she did it with.  Not to the level of detail she provided us, especially when it adversely affects  the people she is responsible for serving.
For example, we ordered an appetizer and enjoyed some bread while waiting.  Our server stopped by the table to let us know the appetizer would be out in just a couple minutes and then proceeded to carry on a lengthy conversation with the table next to ours.  I would say it lasted a good ten minutes (she all but pulled up a chair) before the diners at the table asked if they could order.  All the while we are sitting, waiting for our appetizer which I am sure was sitting in the kitchen service window the whole time.  It tasted like it could have been great had it not been so cold.
The rest of the dinner was served better, although after waiting again, we had to ask for our salads and I would have liked to have had some time to finish them before ours dinners arrived.
Also, I ordered a Manhattan to enjoy before my meal.  It was poorly made as all I could taste was cherry juice.  I thought about sending it back, but decided I would make the best of it.   Turns out that when the bill came, I had spent $11.00 for it.  I don&#39;t pay that much for a drink like that  in downtown Chicago, let alone in a small, suburban restaurant.  I wish I had sent it back now.
So the bottom line is the food was and/or would have been very good. The service was exceptionally poor given the time of day(remember this was early, about 5 o&#39;clock before any rush).  And the drinks were expensive and not of the best quality.
I always like to give a restaurant a second chance especially if there were some good qualities seen.  So we will be going back at least one more time, but we won&#39;t be going out of our way to do so anytime soon."

There was only one person working, with about 10 tables to take care of.  He also had to answer phones and seat people.  It&#39;s completely possible he was the one cooking the food in the back too, based on the lack of service.  

We sat down and waited 10 minutes for our drinks (water and soda, nothing that required time). He then explained to us that they were out of about 6 things on the menu.  We understood; Mother&#39;s Day was the day prior and I&#39;m sure they were busy. We ordered appetizers and asked if it would be best if we took our entrees to go, since we only had an hour for lunch.  He assured us our pasta would be ready in &#34;15 minutes tops&#34;. Well, 25 minutes later we got our appetizers and he said our pastas would be right up.  20 minutes later, we asked him to box our entrees up because we had already been there over an hour.  He didn&#39;t even offer an apology for the delay.

When we got back to the office, we had our food.  It tasted ok, but the lunch portions were hilariously small for the price.  The ravioli lunch entree includes THREE raviolis - not the large sized ravioli, but the small size.  Literally 3 bites of food for $10.

For appetizers, we had the goat cheese bruschetta and fried ravioli.  Both were very good and portion size was exactly what you&#39;d expect - 4-5 pieces of bruschetta and 10-12 ravioli.

Even though the quality of food is ok, there are too many other good places in the area to put up with poor service.  I should have listened to the other reviewers who had similar problems."

Nothing else has even come close up to this point. Aliano&#39;s was great! We ordered over the phone and picked it up. My husband had the chicken parmesan, and I had the veal limone. The veal was lean, and cut with a fork. The penne was perfectly aldente. The chicken was the same. Even the salad was great. But unfortunately, there were two things I was unhappy about. The garlic bread was hard, cold and stale. It was terrible. And lastly were the prices. $23 for what should&#39;ve been a lunch portion is ridiculous. I don&#39;t know if I can justify paying these prices for such small portions, even if the food is undeniably great. We shall see. If you don&#39;t mind the prices, I definitely recommend Aliano&#39;s for lunch or dinner."

We were blown away by the quality of  the good and the attentive service.  They made suggestions that we spot on. We had a great evening and have suggested the restaurant to all of our friends. 
We just held our son high school graduation party at Aliano&#39;s last sunday and had a group of 18 with 14 of them being their first time. The food we choose with the help of Mario the owner and &#34;Momma Catherine&#34; was awesome. Everyone was in awe of the food and wanted to come back soon. My parents told me they wished they had a Aliano&#39;s by their house. Scott our server was awesome. 
The appetizer was a fresh made bruchetta,  the main course was stuffed shells and chicken parmesan,  which both were top notch (there was a bit of a discussion on who was going to take the extra pices home) and for dessert... homemade canollis and tiramisu.  Needless to say no one was hungry when we left.
The drinks were great and they have a great selection of beers including Bell&#39;s amber and oberon. Everyone was friendly and welcoming to our group and even momma came by to say hello to me and give our son an embarrassing kiss and congratulations on graduating. Classic!
Mario- your awesome keep up the great work!"

I had the limone chicken and my husband had the chicken piccata, both were to die for, so much food, I ended up bringing portion of it home.  The owners (maybe managers) were roaming the whole time, and always quick with a smile, a joke and just made you feel at home.

I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with our experience altogether. Service was quick, friendly and smooth. Our server did forget to bring one thing, but she was busy and I asked another server. Otherwise, service was great. 

The food was not too shabby either. We had fresh hot bread and oil to dip in, baked mostacioli and gnocchi. The red sauce was excellent and the gnocchi was light and fluffy. 

The surroundings were very typical of an Italian restaurant without being over the top, and the atmosphere matched very well.

The second time we came for the lunch buffet. Unfortunately, all the entrees were cold because the heating/serving dishes were not properly lit. Our waiter offered to heat up our plates for us. In the meantime, they re-lit the serving dishes. By the time we finished our re-heated plates, the buffet still had not yet warmed up. 
At the end of our meal, our waiter brought our check. We were charged full price for everything. I mustered my courage and asked if we could have a discount. Our waiter went to check out the possibility of this, and the owner or manager came out...profusely apologizing...and gave us our lunch for free. Kudos to him...mistakes happen and he owned up to it. I believe our waiter was new, young and a bit inexperienced. If he were a bit more seasoned, he might have spoken to the manager right away to see what he could do for us.

Strike one: while refreshing one of the foods they put the cover on the floor and then put it back over the fresh food. Unsanitary much?

Strike two: I found what I thought was a big black hair in the lasagna...I immediately went to the front and said I needed the manager. I pointed out my problem and he looked at it...to which he replied &#34;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not a hair...its a wire from our metal brush used to clean the pans.&#34; ...is that supposed to make me feel better?  I told him that could cause a lot of damage if swallowed and I expected my meal comped...something ordered not from the buffet. 

Strike three. Not only did the members of my party who did not do the buffet wait so long for the food that they ended up having everything wrapped to go...we waited probably 30 min to get the checks and have them taken care of. In the end most of our party had left and before I walked off I noticed one had never even gotten their card back! 

Do not plan to ever return nor do I recommend this establishment."

I was in the area and really wanted Moranos new York style pizza but they were closed. So I yelped new York style pizza and came up with Alianos. 

I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re confused about what new York style is but what they serve is NOT that. New York style is thin and cut in big triangles. Normally,  you can fold it and eat it like a sandwich.  Alianos NY style was almost like double dough with a crust on Crack!   It was so thick and heavy. When they handed us the box I knew something was wrong just by the weight alone! 

Ok style aside, the taste wasn&#39;t good either. The cheese was thick and chewy,  pepperoni was soooo salty,  and it was COATED in Italian spices. 
In conclusion,  I would avoid their pizza and to be honest if they can&#39;t get a pizza right,  I&#39;m not sure I want to try their food."

We&#39;ve gone to Aliano&#39;s a few times and the food was usually pretty good, but it is not consistent.  The tomato and oil appetizer they bring out is pretty good.

But the servers don&#39;t seem to be well trained.  Slow service on drinks and and even a botched order disappointed.

We waited forever to get our check and I went to find the manager to ask for it in a joking way.  He said, &#34;I got 2 servers who didn&#39;t show up for work today.&#34; I said the service is usually slow and he said &#34;Meh,&#34; shrugged and walked away.

So we say, &#34;Meh,&#34; shrug and find other places with food that is as good or better with better service and where our patronage is appreciated."

My husband and I both had the vodka sauce with our dishess (gnochi and baked mostacioli).  We loved it!  One of the best vodka sauces we have ever had!  I have to ask when we sitt down the next time we go if they will sell us a quart!  They were very nice.  Our dinners included a salad as well.  We chose 2 of the cheapest entrees on the menu at $13 -15 each.  So not a cheaper establishment.  The kids meals were all priced at $8 and it did NOT include their drink!  When I asked about the buttered noodles costing $8 they said it was a big portion.  Honestly, it wasn&#39;t.  It was just enough for an older kid.  It was really the pricing and partially the portion size as to why I gave them 4 stars inst4ead of 5.  Truly the adult entrees were delicious.  They seemed to take longer than we expected to get our meals as well.  We will definitely go back but I&#39;m not sure if it will be for a casual dinner with the kids.  EXCELLENT FOOD!"

Well I think we may have just found it in Alianos.  Owner Mario made us feel right at home as we were seated for dinner.  The menu is extensive.  Had our toasted ravioli appetizer quickly, in only 6 minutes!  Salad was to follow with a very tasty &#34;mama&#39;s&#34; dressing.  The veal parmigiana was excellent.  Melt in your mouth.  The fettuccine marinara side was perfectly al dente.  My wife had chicken piccante, which was light, lemony and delicioso.  Service by Hugo was friendly, attentive and efficient.

It&#39;s Valentine&#39;s day so we made it later in the evening to assure we wouldn&#39;t have to wait too much after our reservation time to sit. We arrived at 5 after 8 and were advised that they overbooked and it Would be a TWO HOUR wait.  That put us getting seated at close to 1030. This is not the first time this has happened to us there. But I can assure you it will be the last.  Never again.


*UPDATE: I have added two stars.  It really bothers me to leave such a negative review on a local business so we went back to see if the seating issues still stood -ha ha. The original review takes into account that we had visited 3 or 4 times and always had the same problem.  Valentine&#39;s day was just the worst because we were paying a sitter for a special evening and couldn&#39;t sit around that long.  I thought it was only fair to try one more time on an evening when we had more time. We purposefully didn&#39;t make a reservation because we were willing to wait. We went on a Friday at 7pm. There was no wait. We were seated right away and had attentive service. Our server was newer and it seemed like quite a bit of the staff  was,  But they took care of us very well. The food was delicious.  I&#39;m not sure if the bad reviews have affected the business and that was why it was 1/2 empty or if it was an off night but for once we really did get to enjoy our meal in a timely manner."

The food is good but always seems like they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing to run a good restaurant. From the minute you walk in, the experience feels odd and off - only salvaged by pretty good food once it finally comes to your table (&#34;finally&#34; means different things. The first time we came we waited over an hour for our food).

-Sat under the A/C vent. Note to Aliano&#39;s, don&#39;t put a table under the A/C vent.
-Had reservations for two. Waiting over 15 minutes past our time and watched 3 tops walk in without a reservation and get seated before us.
-Would have been nice if the hostess smiled once in a while.
-Water refill? Forget it.
-Saw a guy from one table get up and hand his bill to a guy at another table. Apparently they can&#39;t even get that right.

Even though the food is good when I dine out I want the whole experience. The experience here from the moment you walk in is awkward and uncomfortable. I will not be back."

It was a good starter and just enough to whet our appetites for a still generous lunch portion of spaghetti. Having had spaghetti dinner here a couple times, I can say the pasta is consistently done to perfection, al dente, The sauce is substantial and meatball is out of this world tender! They normally don&#39;t serve bread during the day but we found ourselves with spaghetti sauce left over, enough to eat with their delicious garlic bread.

So what was the final outcome?....Meh. It&#39;s not the worst Italian restaurant I&#39;ve ever been but certainly not the best either. I&#39;d probably rate Rosebuds or Zsa Zsa&#39;s ahead of this establishment. 

Since it my first time, the decision was made to order the basics. Here&#39;s my thoughts:

Calamari Fritti - lightly fried with a marina sauce. Kind of chewy which is fine although I&#39;ve been to place where it melts it in your mouth. I guess it&#39;s what you prefer. Rating-okay... A little too chewy

Papa Gnochi - potato stuffed pasta. Not as flavorful as I had hoped. It does come with a marina sauce but very salty. Normally I don&#39;t have an issue but this time it really stuck out. Rating-chewy and okay but tone down the salt in the sauce.

Broccoli cream soup - flavorful and very creamy but again, very salty. (What&#39;s up with that?) Rating - good but less salt.

Thin crust pizza -  this was disappointing. Not only did I get the wrong pizza but there was huge order in front of so they couldn&#39;t correct their mistake. I did try what was presented and found it to be dry and really not that great. Rating - not great with a cardboard like texture

Overall this was an average place. I may come back another day and try again but for now I think I&#39;ll try a few other places instead. One positive note was that the  cost of the pizza was deducted from the final bill so you have to give them credit for that."

This past weekend we headed out for an Italian dinner and, as always, Aliano&#39;s came through!  No matter what we have tried we are always more than pleased with the meal. This time my wife went for the Rigatoni Mama Mia which is rigatoni served in a delicious Italian sausage gravy and I had the Veal and shrimp special which was spectacular.  They have a nice wine list and also have some nice craft beers on tap.  The prices are more than reasonable and the atmosphere is really nice, especially for a strip mall restaurant!  I would give them 5 stars but it is too often that there are mishaps with the service which cause us to shake our heads.  Anyhow, I look forward to my next Italian meal at Aliano&#39;s."

The second time we came here was only because my husband bought a groupon and convinced me it would be better. Never again. I am no gourmet chef but I can cook better than the food here. It&#39;s either too heavily salted or bland. The ambience sucks. It is loud and packed tight and I felt like I was sitting with our neighboring table. The tables are shabby and wobble.

I saw the reviews, but a friend suggested we go and I said &#34;sure, let&#39;s give it a shot and just see what happens.&#34; It was awful. Sure, the food is fine, but not extraordinary. The real issue is that the service is awful, and you&#39;re paying elevated prices to boot. Half an hour after we were seated, we had been brought bread and water by a busser, but no one had come by to take drink orders, bring menus, or even to just say &#34;I&#39;m your waiter and we&#39;re really slammed right now, but I&#39;ll be back in just a few minutes.&#34; Once drinks and apps were ordered, drinks took another 20 minutes to arrive. Food took even longer, and we were missing some of the things we ordered (we also ordered additional drinks that never arrived). We heard two other nearby tables complaining about the wait, and a third that waited for a long time for their food and then it was wrong when it arrived. Whenever our table or a nearby one flagged someone down to order something else or alert them of a problem, the response was, &#34;I&#39;ll fix that right away,&#34; then another 20-30 minutes would pass. I would not go back, nor can I recommend such a poorly run establishment to anyone else."

We went for dinner later on a Saturday night, there was a private party in the bar which in my opinion is a terrible idea - have parties in a private room, not taking over the entire bar.  However, the hostess seated us right away in a dining room, and the ambience was great - except the two owners kept adjusting the lights, one would make it a little brighter, and the other would turn them down so dimly I had to whip out me cell phone for some light. Has anyone else noticed the menu is printed in about size 7 font?? I can barely read that thing, and I&#39;m young!  

The service was fair, the waiter was very friendly but just seemed inexperienced. He would disappear for long periods of time, his timing just seemed off. We got drinks and soup with minor delays, but then he cleared the soup and bolted - hello? Can we please place our dinner order? He refilled my water but ignored the other glass because he seemed nervous to reach for it, never asked if he wanted another glass of wine, and we had to find him to ask for the check because he was so immersed in cleaning for the end of the shift. It seems like Aliano&#39;s has an abundance of servers because you can see groups of them standing around, but they all seemed trained in avoiding eye contact. 

If it wasn&#39;t for the food, I probably would not return to Aliano&#39;s. We had two types of their New York Style pizza, we could taste the fresh ingredients, and it was honestly the best pizza I&#39;ve had in a while. Looking around, the entrees looked equally appetizing, especially the seafood, I can&#39;t wait to try more of the menu!

Overall, Aliano&#39;s has potential. The bar, when not packed by a party is a great place to enjoy a drink, the food is fresh and delicious, and the space is fun and cozy. If the owners can hire more experienced staff or train their existing staff, this place would be &#39;5&#39; stars hands down!"

Sadly, I cannot help move the average. Our experience was ok. Some entres excellent. Some so so. Overall, my opinion is that this restaurant is a little overpriced based on what we received. Service was not an issue.

We started out with an anti Pasto appetizer. I had high expectations given we were at an Italian restaurant. The dish was ok, with some nice meats. Not quite what I expected, however. The bread was good, as was the olive oil. Salads were average. I expected freshly grated cheese for the salads, and the entrees, but this was not offered.

We had a couple of pasta specials and a couple of pizzas. The pasta dishes were solid. One of the pizzas was very good, Luigis I believe. The other pizza was a white pizza that suffered from a severe lack of flavor. Had a little garlic, but nothing else.

Prices are about $13 to $15 for an 18&#34; pizza. Pasta dishes were in the range of $12 to $18, with a side salad running $5 more.

Overall, the experience was ok."

When our group went up the first time (close to the time that the buffet was set out), everything tasted really good and the buffet table was fully stocked.  We wanted to try some other options and we all went up again.  To our surprise there was virtually nothing in the pans and it didn&#39;t look as though anything was going to be replenished.  We had to tell our waitress that they needed to refill the pans (of everything, including entrees, salad and dessert) and to add clean plates, all that was left on the buffet table were dirty plates.  After waiting about 10-20 minutes for more food, we were disappointed with this food.  It was strange to us that the everything was so good the first time, but remarkably different at our second helping.  Granted, it didn&#39;t make or break our meal, but I thought that the buffet could have been set up differently.  Right next to the dinner plates was a small dish of salad and dessert (fried dough with chocolate).  I thought it was odd that the dessert wasn&#39;t at the end of buffet.  

When it came to pay, I thought that the entire meal (excluding tax) would be covered by what we purchased by Amazon since it said it we were paying for one dinner buffet, including soft drink.  However, that wasn&#39;t the case.  We each had to pay .95 -- again, not that it was a big deal and that we couldn&#39;t afford the .95, but that&#39;s not how it was represented to us when we purchased the voucher.  When we asked our waitress about that, she said the price of the buffet was a higher price than the voucher and then she said it was the tax amount, but there was another entry on our bill for tax that we paid...very confusing.  I think she just didn&#39;t know what to say.

We purchased one more buffet on Amazon, but that will be the last time we go to this restaurant.  This was not the first time I was there and sometimes there food is really good, other times extremely disappointing.  They need more consistency."

As for the people who pay, the food was mediocre at best.  I always wished this place would be better since there are not many restaurant options if you eat out as much as we do.  After andi got my order wrong I waited for the correct one which was a big mistake.  By the time it came everyone else was done eating and my meal tasted like I was chewing on a Morton salt bottle.  Stay away - always offering groupons is usually a good barometer on the food quality."

I&#39;m a Batavian and wish the best for all businesses in the area to survive and stay busy. However as I have read some of the HIDDEN REVIEWS on here and feel the same way as others. In talking with friends some have had great experiences here with great food.  I was hoping to get the same but had slow service and a pretty bad waitress that told me it takes a really long time to stuff blue cheese olives:) The food was average and not exactly the homemade Italian food I&#39;m used to. Rooting for success for them but the Owner didn&#39;t want to hear any of my comments about the food and service.   A meal here should never take more than 2 hrs and 30 minutes with a family.  My kids barely survived. And I needed to get home to a drink I could get myself.
alianos-ristorante-batavia,Dorothy P.,-oqR75p6ZkMqAgbuxOg2rw,"Algonquin, IL",1,1,0,102,55,riir8DMjjpHhOWm-Tt_8kg,4.0,2013-01-23,"Fan-tastic.  I will have to start out by saying that I bought a Groupon deal for Aliano&#39;s a few months ago because the restaurant is in the same strip mall as the dance studio (The Attic) that I have Zumba classes.  The expiration date was fast approaching, so my husband and I decided it was time to bite the bullet and give them a go.  

We dined on a Wednesday night and were pleasantly surprised to see that they were quite busy.  I would note that we sort of had a rough start.  We walked into the restaurant, and there was no one there to seat us.  A few of the servers walked by and offered a quick &#34;hi,&#34; but that was about it.  After waiting about 5 minutes for someone to seat us, I joked that we might not be able to review them on Yelp, since no one wanted to seat us (but they sure are good at saying hello).  Luckily for everyone, one of the servers was nice enough to escort us to an open table after she dropped off drinks at a table she was waiting on.

We were promptly greeted by our friendly waitress, who took our drink order and suggested the spicy calamari special to start with (before we really had much chance to check out the menu).  She could see that we were a little dazed still, so she went to grab our drinks instead.  By the time she came back, we had decided that calamari sounded delightful and ordered the appetizer special (before we realized that the entrees come with a soup or salad...hello leftovers).  I ordered the tortellini alla prosciutto, while my dining companion (also known as the husband) opted for a baked mostaccioli with a meatball.  We both ordered the Italian soup since it was pretty darn cold outside that night.

When the appetizer arrived, I knew we were in trouble in the best possible way.  The server put down between us a heaping plate of lightly fried calamari &amp; we looked at each other.  Wow, the calamari was perfectly cooked, not rubbery at all.  The breading was nice and light with minimal greasiness, and the hot peppers that it was all tossed in gave just the right amount of kick.  The soup was good too, although not super memorable (had I written this review quickly, I could probably be more descriptive.  You&#39;ll just have to try it for yourself). By my last spoonful of soup, I was stuffed.  I guess that&#39;s what you call a rookie mistake.  In the spirit of perseverance, however, I decided not to throw in the towel.  Oh no, I&#39;m not a quitter.

Our entrees came out perfectly timed, piping hot, and heaping in our respective bowls.  My husband&#39;s meatball was about the size of a baseball (oh my goodness), which was pretty darn impressive.  The alfredo sauce on my tortellini was delicious, nice and light, sort of brothy but creamy at the same time.  I took a few savory bites before I decided that I probably shouldn&#39;t stuff myself.

Then things took a turn...my husband looked at me and said &#34;how about dessert&#34; even though our dinner plates had hardly been touched.  Like the fool that I am, I happily agreed that dessert was a good idea, thinking we&#39;d probably share something, I&#39;d take a few bites &amp; leave him to finish it up.  Bzzz, wrong.  We can never agree on a dessert, so we each ordered our own.  Judging from the picture on the dessert menu, I picked the pistachio gelato with chocolate sauce.  It looked dainty, like it was served in a cute little shot glass, just enough ice cream to satiate any nook of empty stomach I might have left.  Wrong, this thing, like the rest of the food portions that we had enjoyed thus far, was HUGE.  My hungrier half opted for the cheesecake brownie, essentially cheesecake filling stuffed between two brownies &amp; covered in chocolate.  This thing looked like a cake in and of itself.  I think we each took about 2 bites of his dessert, a few spoonfuls of mine and then gave up just before our stomachs exploded.

And then for a little bit of magic.  Aliano&#39;s menu items aren&#39;t super cheap.  They aren&#39;t super expensive either, but I figured that a 4 course dinner (without alcohol) would land us at least $65 or $70.  When the bill came, I joked that it was going to be around $50 after the groupon discount, but I was wrong.  Our bill was $56 before the discount, meaning we got more than a belly full of food for around $45 after tip...my reaction was to pay the bill and leave...fast...before anyone noticed that we got away with highway robbery (oh and not to forget the leftover entrees and desserts).  That&#39;s precisely what we did.  And we shall most certainly return to Aliano&#39;s another day for more delectable Italian food and hospitality."

We ordered salmon risotto, chicken vesuvio, (I went old school) and the cheese ravioli.  I think the ravioli was the most impressive, it was a perfect ratio of thin pasta and filling.

I would give them a hard 4 for the food. The atmosphere is olive garden-ish.

My major complaint was the service.  It wasn&#39;t busy at all. 6 tables on a week night, yet we had to find our waiter after 10 minutes so we could pay. (He was not the only server.)  The waiter also had a very odd aloofness about him that made us uncomfortable.

Expected a lot more for the price.  Service was beyond awful.... slow and unattentive.   Missed several requests for drink refills, and basically ignored us the entire time.  Not sure where our waitress disappeared to, but I had to talk my husband into even tipping her 10%.  In retrospect, she didn&#39;t even deserve that.

I went early when they opened in 2011 and got probably the worst and slowest service ever by a completely incompetent server. Chalked it up to newness and tried it again a few months later and had even a worse experience with them. I even reached out to ownership with a personal letter offering some honest feedback that went unresponded to. We were given a Gift Certificate to restaurant from a friend for the holiday so decided to give it another go.

It was New Years Eve and I made 615 dinner reservations. We were banking on the 9PM show just a couple of miles away. We were seated promptly and offered water and bread. There was a special New Years menu for 2 and regular menu. My wife ordered a glass of wine and we ordered Calamari, Cesar Salad, and 2 Entrees Bacon Wrapped Scallops and Veal Parmesan. There is a  Eight top to my right that is just finishing up as we are ordering. There is also some Karaoke guy singing and working the tables. A little cheezy but at least they are trying to entertain the guests. About 45 minutes later our salads show up. They are not really drained very well and full of water. C minus .We remind waitress of calamari we are assured it is on its way. 8 top to my left is broken into 2 4tops, cleaned, bussed, and seated in this time. Calamari shows at 90 minute mark. Its good but we are ready to eat. The 4 top to my right gets their dinner even though they were seated 30 minutes after me and I am ready to leave. I have had the singer approach my table more in the time I have been there more than my waitress. When I flag her down I point out to her that we have been there two hours. She apologizes and &#34;SUDDENLY&#34; our food appears. My dish is closer to cold then hot and my wife&#39;s $35 scallop entree has two, yes two scallops on it. I&#39;m fuming at this point. I send my entree back forever, nibble on my wife&#39;s and we end up leaving at the 2 hr 15 min mark. Management does not visit our table but my entree is removed.

I have tried 3 times and have had similar experiences. Yelpers mention poor service over and over in their reviews. I have reached out to ownership and have been ignored. I will never return."

Veggie sandwich options also tasty and plentiful. Black bean patty w hummus and tons of added veggies was flavorful and fresh. Would repeat that order.

First visit: Slow, disorganized service, not very friendly. But clean premises &amp; not at all busy (weeknight after 7pm).

Second visit: also weeknight after 7pm, slow sandwich making but clean, not crowded and friendly. 

Not happy with kids&#39; menu on this first &amp; second visit at all. Kids meal success was a flop with all three kids. 
Kids&#39; crustless grilled cheese a joke of a sandwich -- hardly a serving of food, --a pair of 3&#34;x1&#34; tiny weightless bread slims with a sprinkle of cheese. I literally thought the bag was empty by mistake when we got it &amp; was shocked to see the grilled cheese size/weight in comparison to the other kids&#39; meat sandwiches (both of those served smushed &amp; thrown together on regular bread, dripping and oozing way too much mayo and mustard, so unappealing &amp; so messy, they gave up, so did I). Suggestion: revise/double the grilled cheese portion if that is what is considered comparable to the other sandwiches. Would love to see the kids&#39; sandwiches served on the same bread as adults, even if cut into shorter kid size portion. It would be more substantial &amp; neater for eating as well, plus kids dig a sammy different than what they would have on the plate at home. Additionally the kids&#39; meal treats were unhealthy, chemical filled choices...would prefer a healthier choice such as a half banana or a handful apple slices, both of which cost cents &amp; take two seconds to prepare. Or offer chips/cookie instead of the artificial candy/junk only offered. Kids&#39; milk only filled 3/4 cup.   Felt like staff skimping/lazy on every aspect of kids&#39; meals, and I don&#39;t spend $ on kids meals that end up in the garbage instead of their tummies. These are my companion diners 99% of the time &amp; I frequent places where they get decent food for a decent price &amp; will eat it up. Fail in that department on all 3/3 counts."

I like to think of this as a step up in sandwiches. My personal viewpoint is: Regarding fast food sandwich chains
starting  at the bottom &amp; ascending in terms of food quality, selections, service &amp; enjoyment are : Subway, Jimmy Johns, Quiznos, Cousins, Jersey Mikes -going higher are Firehouse &amp; Which which. (My opinion only) 
I like this place cause of they way its set up. You walk in and on the wall they have listed  by number, your different proteins, chkn, pork, beef, specialty ,etc. also veggie.
They have a number assigned to each main food. Below are a row on bags ( numbered). You remove the bag of your main food of choice which has various types of entrees prepared in the category of your choice. A bucket in the counter will have markers. You mark on the bag how you want your sandwich: hot or cold,  type, ( ie : how do you want that chicken? Buffalo, grilled, etc) size of sandwich, add ingredients, cheese, etc, &amp; continue down the list checking boxes till you have the sandwich you want. 
You hand the bag to the cashier &amp; pay and it then becomes an order form for the sandwich maker. Very easy for them to see.  Your sandwich is made, wrapped &amp; placed in the bag and handed back to you. If  the item you want isnt on your sandwich, perhaps you didnt check the box. Good concept,huh?  
Service is good, ingredients are fresh and prices arent too out of line. You ger what you pay for! Good place!"

Their unique sub sandwich thing is to build your own sandwich on a paper bag to order. Think of it as trying to make your own soda flavor. There is so much room for error in not being able to build a good tasting which. If you are trying to build something new it can take a lot of time but I guess they have already put together sandwiches that you can order too?

Sandwich I had was good overall but their own handmade chips don&#39;t live up to the hype. It is your basic sub with a $6-12 price tag depending on the size and meats you choose. 

I am going to stick with the Jersey Mikes concept (fresh meat and cheese cut in front of you when you order) over having 1000 choices to build what you want. If you are a picky eater you will certainly be able to customize your heart out here. For me I just want to quickly order."

From a selection perceptive, they seem to have an endless list which is nice.

Now on to the food.  They charge you a premium price, but give you almost no meat.  I ordered a sandwich and I counted 6 pieces of meat on my 10.5&#34; sandwich.  Oh Yeah.. That&#39;ll be $9 sir.

Rip-Off.  Much better value in the area, and to think I was excited about visiting here."

Very efficient and no waiting in lines. Kinda tricky for the indecisive because the choices are endless! My sandwich was amazing: black bean patty, avocado, lettuce, tomato, onion, jalapeño, Siracha and honey mustard on wheat. It was a party in my mouth! They need to build one closer to Lemont. My husband said his ham/bacon was just okay. We both liked the bread and would choose this place over subway any day."

Love the options and the made to order concept. Lots of choices. Our family of 4 all had different options and each we enjoyed. Very flavorful. Would recommend two things - a size small is the perfect size. Medium was huge, which my husband couldn&#39;t even finish. Can&#39;t imagine what the large looks like. Also watch how much stuff you place into your sandwich - more is not always the best. Only negative felt like the price of the ice cream sandwich was too high and I have tasted better cookies before. And the house chips although tasty were just a small amount. Would come back and wish we had one of these on our area."

When we walked in we had to fill out a brown bag to let them know what bread, meat, cheese, topping and how we would like our sandwich ( hot or cold).
Ok fine, it&#39;s crafty but truly a waste of paper and time. We also wanted 2 pineapple shakes and a peanut butter cookie. As we approached the register we were informed that we also needed to fill out a separate card for our cookie and milk shakes. Come on, I just want to order my food!! When we finally got our food ( 20 mins after walking inside) I noticed my &#34; turkey and bacon&#34; club sandwich has very little turkey and bacon bites instead of slices of bacon! Really? I just paid almost $7.00 for my sandwich and there isn&#39;t anything to it!! My husband had the chicken salad on wheat and there was not enough chicken to fill the inside of the bread. ( another $7.00). The guy that made our milk shakes also wasn&#39;t wearing gloves and he puts the straws in your shake for you!! No thanks!! We won&#39;t be back! Which wich is over priced for the quality of food you receive. Plan on spending some time there waiting on your below average sandwiches and don&#39;t expect an apology for the wait!"

I got the double patty cheese burger on a pretzel bun and it was fantastic. It was everything I look for when I want to splurge on a gourmet burger. They are greasy, cheesy, and large! You might want to bring a bib for the mess but well worth it. I actually thought the price was not bad for the quality. My wife, who it extremely picky on burger joints was very impressed.

The good? Big fry portions and all-you-can-drink Oberweis white or chocolate milk. 

They are connected to Oberweis, so you can also get shakes to go with your meal (we didn&#39;t get them that day, but from experience Oberweis shakes rock!). It&#39;s a little weird how one restaurant merges into the other, but there is a clear line of separation with a big beam and drastic differences in theme, color, etc.

The bad? I got the Spicy Chicken which was on their LE menu. The spicy slaw was really wet, and made the whole bottom bun a slimy mess by the time we got it to the table (he chicken portion was generous and very juicy though). 

The fries weren&#39;t very exciting either.

Also, the area with the drinks had little bugs flying everywhere---kinda gross....

Pretty sure we won&#39;t be coming here again, but it&#39;s not the worst."

A buddy of mine who lives in the area suggested it and it was really just average for it&#39;s type (burger and fries joint), and is actually pretty pricey to boot. 

You order from the counter, take a number, and then have a seat while you wait for your food to be brought out to you on a tray. The place is incredibly clean, I will say that much, which is critical for a place that has an open grill that can make everything you touch slimey if they do not keep up on sanitation. There is also an attached dessert station to your right that I did not partake in, but I must admit the concoctions that were being delivered to tables near me certainly looked delicious and had a great presentation. 

If you order a burger or chicken sandwich &#34;with everything&#34; be prepared for it to be extremely messy. Granted that I am a &#34;typical guy&#34; and do not really give a shit about such concerns, but I think I went though about 10 napkins before I polished off the sandwich. Some dainty girl might be in for a bit of a challenge. The chicken sandwich was good, but nothing really special that you could not get from Chick-Fil-A at a far reduced price. 

Fresh cut fries here are decent sized, extra crispy and were really quite tasty. Timing is everything when you show up to a place and get fries, so maybe I just got lucky and they made a fresh batch. They are served in an a large beverage cup that is overflowing onto your tray and they do not skimp in the slightest. No need to opt for the size large here unless you are just extremely hungry. 

Overall, this place is just OK. For the same price I could get a much better burger from Fudruckers and have a cheese pump for my fries. I try to eat pretty healthy most of the time, so when I splurge on stuff like this I try to make it worth my while. It&#39;s not quite up to that level of sacrifice in my book."

Less greasy than Five Guys.  I got a &#34;That Burger&#34; with cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, pickles and mayo on a regular bun.  I realized too late that the burger I ordered had 2 beef patties.  So 2 bites in and 3 fries and I&#39;m now being admitted to the hospital for being in a food coma.  The fries have a fresh cut look with almost a Burger King fry style crust.  Very good with the &#34;smokey&#34; seasoning(my dad says it&#39;s just seasoning salt).  

My kids shared a Jr. with cheese, which was pretty much untouched because they loved the fries so much.  Also, I admit that I made a questionable decision and let them drink chocolate milk at 5pm.  BUT it was Oberweis chocolate milk and there were free refills.  Meh, don&#39;t judge me, it&#39;s summer vacation.

I like that they have so many toppings to choose from, most of them are free. I also ordered fries. My burger was good, nothing out of the ordinary and nothing out of this world but it was edible. The meat was good, the toppings fresh and the bun was tasty. After our dinner we walked to the other side which is an Oberwise and my son got a milkshake.

One weird thing is they ask whether it is eat in or to go. Why they ask I don&#39;t know. Everything comes in a bag like 5 guys, whether you eat in or not.

The fries are fresh cut shoestring style, not the big meaty kind like 5 guys. I actually like the burger here better than 5 guys though. Price for a double patty burger, small fries and a drink was about 10 bucks, not too bad.

The horseradish spin on the Big Mac sauce was pretty good, but I&#39;m glad I got it on the side. One cool thing is that milk is the same price as soda with unlimited refills from the chilled self-serve dispenser."

I doubt he even knows what dog meat tastes like. I&#39;m happy to report that That Burger Joint, aside from have a clumsy name, is a good place to eat. Let&#39;s break it down.

Atmosphere:
-the restaurant was clean and cool. An industrial look with warm wooden benches and tables. It&#39;s very modern and brightly lit. You aren&#39;t going to want to sit there all day, but you&#39;ll enjoy sitting there for a meal. The sounds in the restaurant are a range of orders being barked, a sizzling grill, and soft music in the background. Don&#39;t expect to have a great conversation over the noise, but nothing stands out as annoying either.

What&#39;s unique is that it&#39;s attached to an Oberwise, so you can conveniently grab some ice cream after dinner.

Food Quality:
Everything tasted hot and fresh. They serve a smashed style burger and natural cut fries as the go-to item. I think the burger was missing the signature crispy edges that are the achievement of smashed-style, but it was tasty nonetheless. The fries were good as well but I thought could&#39;ve been cooked a minute or so longer.

I ordered a double cheese burger with grilled mushrooms, american cheese, and mayo which is what I always get when I&#39;m trying a new burger place. Ordering is as simple as choosing the item (a burger in this case), the number of patties (one or two), and then your toppings. $.50 upcharge for cheese, $1.00 upcharge for bacon. You also have the option of regular bun or pretzel bun. I don&#39;t get pretzel buns but my &#34;dog meat&#34; friend said the pretzel bun was good.

They don&#39;t don anything fancy with the fries - just a bit of salt. At the service station where you grab ketchup, napkins, sodas, etc., they have a few additional seasonings that you can apply to your food: cajun, smokey, and celery salt. I was a little zealous with the cajun on my fries - but it was a nice addition that I had control over.

Value/Price:
You will pay what you expect from these kinds of places. My order was about $11. The portions were good - not overwhelming. They don&#39;t skimp but you probably aren&#39;t taking anything home. You get plenty of fries if you order a regular. i can&#39;t imagine a scenario where one person would want a large.

There&#39;s little variety. I find this to be good. I like it when restaurants just pick a few things to be good at and stick to it. you can get a burger, a chicken sandwich, or a hotdog. Bam. But it&#39;s also pretty limiting if you are with others who don&#39;t feel like having a burger.

Service:
You&#39;ll probably have little interaction with the staff because it&#39;s one of these no nonsense restaurants where you order up front and collect your food when it&#39;s ready. No wait staff and no tipping (thank goodness). Having said that, everyone that interacted with was friendly. I even got an unsolicited &#34;have a great day&#34; when I left.

Notes:
I&#39;d recommend this place if you&#39;d like to grab a quick burger with a higher than fast food quality and not deal with the frills of sit-down restaurants.

I can&#39;t help but directly compare this place to the superior 5 Guys mostly because it&#39;s located in the same parking lot at this location. I wouldn&#39;t turn down an invitation to TBJ, but if it&#39;s just me and my money, i&#39;m walking across the lot.

They don&#39;t have rootbeer. :("

Fairly simple concept, you order 1 or 2 patties then tell them what type of bun and toppings. Lots of good fresh toppings to choose from. I opted for a double with cheese on a pretzel roll and fries. They cook the burgers fresh, right before your eyes, they don&#39;t cook anything before it is ordered so you know your burger will be fresh and hot every time. The order of fries was HUGE. It is attached to Oberweis so if you can order an Oberweis milk shake to go with your burger if you so choose.  I will definately return."

I got a junior burger with cheese and your typical burger toppings (ketchup, mustard, mayo, lettuce, onion-raw, and pickles). The burger was only so-so. I felt like they didn&#39;t season their meat. So I put some of the cajan seasoning on it and it made the burger 10 times better.

The fries were MAGICAL! Add the cajan seasoning and they are the bomb! I also dipped them in the petal sauce which made me feel like I was dying - in a good way.

The petal sauce itself was liquid gold! If you don&#39;t try this, you would have partially wasted your trip there.

All in all, pretty good place :)"

The fries are frozen and not fresh like 5 Guys a mile away, the meat was cooked to order but gray in color and rather salty. The bun was very similar to a McDonald&#39;s fish filet.

Burgers, chicken, or hot dog are all that is available. The nice thing is it is completely customizable as far as what you want on it and what kind of bun you would like. You can also order Oberweis shakes/ dessert if you want since they are linked. I ordered a junior size burger, and it was very filling! It was also very good. The only downside was the length of time I had to wait for my order. That was pretty slow even though there was only one other customer. If you have some time available, I would definitely recommend checking it out!"

I loved the That Burger with cheese on a pretzel bun I got. They had a couple dipping sauces - one called petal and one ranch. The petal seems like ketchup meets horseradish. Both were really good, but I&#39;d probably lean towards the petal sauce as it is more unique.

I am not entirely sure whether That Burger Joint is part of Oberweis or if they just work together somehow, but the food is definitely on par with what Oberweis sells. What was really slick is that I could order my Oberweis shake when I ordered my burger.

My wife had the chicken sandwich and she had equally good things to say. The kids had hot dogs, and they are, well, hot dogs. I&#39;m not really a hot dog lover. I guess I am happy because they are as &#34;good-for-you&#34; as hot dogs can be I suppose.

As any restaurant, they offer unlimited soda refills, but their twist is that you can also get unlimited Oberweis milk and chocolate milk refills. I asked if our kids could just put their heads under the nozzle, and I got a strange look (not really). But I am serious - the milk is free refills ... even on Oberweis chocolate milk.

Definitely our new favorite for a good-but-pretty-quick dinner. Particular if we want dessert."

You can&#39;t get much else here, they have the simplest menu board I&#39;ve ever seen.  They have burgers, chicken sandwich, hot dog and fries, that&#39;s about it.  The restaurant is connected to Oberweis, so the shakes they offer are Oberweis shakes, which is always a good thing.  This place is almost identical to 5 Guys burgers in every way.   I got the regular cheeseburger, which is actually a double and an order of fries, which come in a paper drinking cup (just like 5 guys).  The burger was great and they offer a pretzel bun, you always get bonus points from me for a pretzel bun.  The fries were much better than 5 guys fries, which I hate.   These fries are handcut like 5 guys, but were actually crispy, unlike 5 guys soggy, limp fries.  They still seem a little disorganized, but the food did come out pretty quick and was made exactly how I ordered it.  If you are a fan of 5 Guys, Meatheads or even In and Out, give this place a try, it&#39;s pretty tasty."

Incidentally which is next door. I kept my eye opened every time I passed by route 59 to see the progress. Last Friday 2/14/14 I decided to pass by and take a look. They were open! There was no &#34;Grand Opening&#34; that I saw. Just a &#34;now open&#34;. When I walked in it had a modern sorta industrial/rustic decor. Concrete floors with rustic looking table. 4-5 booths and maybe 5-7 tables. They had 3 LCD monitor turned portrait mode, displaying pictures of the food in a rotation slide show.

The workers were attentive and immediately asked if I needed help choosing hamburgers. The cooking area is to the right of the two registers a larger grill where up 5 works cook orders.  It shares the space with the Oberweis. Basically they removed a wall and joined both storefronts. It was weird how the two decors didn&#39;t seem to mesh. Industrial vs Old timey. They have a neat Juke box called Touch tunes. You get to select music from a list or search and make a playlist so everyone can hear in the restaurant. Strangely you could only hear it in the burger joint section and not in the Oberweis section.  Also you can take photos sort of like a photo booth which you could post to facebook or email to yourself. 

They are trying to separate themselves from other burger places by saying their meat is never frozen and is hormone free. Their hot dogs are all natural beef and free from nitrate as well as the chicken being free of anything artificial. The menu is relatively modest. The have 2 types of burgers &#34;That Burger&#34; which I ordered is two patties of Angus beef. which you can choose either plain bun or pretzel bun and &#34;that junior Burger&#34;which is the same but single, geared towards kids.  You get your usual condiments and topping that you&#39;d expect on a burger. But they have what they call petal sauce, which taste to me like mayo/ketchup/horseradish. It tasted good but not too spicy. They also have hot dogs price for 3 dollars.. Chicken breast same options as the burger. They all run approx 6 dollars. The only add on are slices of bacon for a dollar. It did look good though. They use presses to keep the bacon from getting well wrinkly.

The burger which I ordered was a &#34;That Burger&#34; was huge which was wrapped in foil lined paper numbered to correspond one on the receipt. I joked it could feed a family of four. The size of a CD or so. But much tender than one. It was thoroughly cooked through, but not over cook thankfully. But was moist. So much so that the bun started to fall apart. Perhaps that&#39;s why they offer pretzel bun as a option. The skin on fries were good. Almost julienne. Not too salty and not too oily. It was served up in a large cup.  Their drinks were standard fair. But they also had the Oberweis milk and chocolate milk. The good part was the milk as well as the drinks were free refills. Good for parents whos kids love the milk.  The staff was good, constantly walking around asking how the food was and if we needed anything else. Tables were rarely left dirty as it was cleaned asap.  Room for tables won&#39;t be a issue yet. I see this place giving local burger eateries competition when people want a burger and desert.  

At the end it is a good place. The burgers were very good. Though I do favor broiled burgers as opposed to grilled. I still enjoyed the burger. The price is on par with going to a Portillo&#39;s but not as much as Red Robin. 
This will def be my new go to place for burgers because of it&#39;s quality of food and location."

While service was pretty good and the drinks were tasty, the food was sadly not very good at all. I received cold tater tots (which the server happily replaced for me with some fresh ones). And my boyfriends blackened salmon sliders were 1. Not blackened, and 2. one of the sliders was raw in the middle.  When we brought it to our servers attention, she said they are sometimes served that way, however, speaking as a chef, salmon is not meant to be served raw. Also, if they are supposed to be served that way, why was one of them raw and the others not?

I guess it must be a popular North Central College bar?  The food is nasty and the service staff seem to be the poster children for methadone clinics.

The draft beer I ordered tasted like a long-haul truckers urine after a hefty serving of asparagus. My date had a chardonnay which I guess tasted fine, she didn&#39;t complain about it.  The atmosphere is always cool here- I&#39;ll give them two stars for that.  The bartender was MIA when we first got in, then three of them appeared after about 20 minutes.  Not sure what was up with that?

I&#39;m not even knocking this location in particular- every Bar Louie I go to seems to fall flat on its face with everything (especially the hideous food), yet they are always open and a quick walk from wherever you come from.

My boyfriend took a walk around the bar and he found a table right by the bar, score! 
The server came over right away and took our order. I usually do the Diva martinis when I go to a BL but I decided to be daring and ordered another kind of martini. Not sure what it was called but it was a grape flavored drink. It was very good. 
My boyfriend had a cucumber martini which he enjoyed so much that he ordered another. While we were there the DJ started playing and a few people made their way to the tiny dance floor. 
Was not a fan of the DJ at all.

It&#39;s like, how did you get where you are by being such a goofball?

I&#39;ve been to this Bar Louie a few times, mostly during holiday bar crawls, but most recently for post dinner drinks.  I had the Effen Cucumber martini, which was light &amp; refreshing, I loved it.  I went home that night and looked on Pinterest for my own cucumber martini recipes.  My friend had 2 s&#39;mores martinis.  The fact that she had 2 should say enough for itself.

That second martini arrived at our table in a short cocktail glass because they &#34;ran out of martini glasses.&#34;

This is Bar Louie.  You have a martini list.  You&#39;re practically a martini bar.  It&#39;s a bar.  Even though it was Saturday night, it wasn&#39;t filled nearly to capacity so...what the hell?  I know the drink tastes the same coming out of any vessel, but clearly someone isn&#39;t doing their job.  And when you&#39;re paying $10 for a cocktail, it should at least be in the proper glassware, right?

The stem of my own glass was sticky, so I suppose the bartenders might be a bit sloppy too.

When it comes to downtown Naperville, Bar Louie is one of the best choices for a cocktail.  But they couldn&#39;t hold a candle to cocktail bars in other locales.  I grudgingly give it 4 stars since there isn&#39;t much else to compare them to out this way.

Now, can someone with a shit ton of money PLEASE open a decent cocktail bar in the west suburbs?  THANK. YOU."

Here are my highlights:

They typically have great specials! $1 burgers on Tuesdays usually get my parents in there, so I&#39;ve joined them a handful of times for dinner. I mean, it&#39;s a great deal! Of course you pay extra for the toppings, but it&#39;s still a cheap price for a good pub burger.

I&#39;ve also been there on a Wednesday where all apps were half price from 6-8 pm. Now that&#39;s a deal if I&#39;ve ever heard one! I for one am a huge fan of appetizers. Light bites that allow you to basically taste test the menu?? SOLD. It was so nice because instead of doing dinner our whole table just ordered a ton of apps. The flatbreads are delish, chicken wings were good, calamari was also noteworthy. Bottom line, if you get the chance, take the full tour of their appetizer menu.

On top of the Wednesday app special, they also had $5 martinis that night! I enjoyed a cucumber martini and it was soooo refreshing and delicious. It was actually that very martini that created my love for cucumber vodka and it&#39;s been a sweet romance ever since.

Word to the wise, don&#39;t stay past 9 or 10 pm or else you&#39;re in for a club-ish dance floor scene full of college kids and divorcees on the prowl  (not my jam). And I&#39;m not kidding, no matter what day of the week it is this transformation happens like clock work at the strike of 10 pm. DJ starts his music and the dancers creep to the floor.

I&#39;m giving 3 stars to the Naperville Bar Louie, because well, I&#39;ve had better. Better at other locations. To me, the service, drinks and atmosphere aren&#39;t worth the full price cost. You&#39;ll only find me here if there&#39;s a good special going on!"

Why don&#39;t they put some authentic Tuscan bread on the side? Some things on the menu annoyed me: Why must the word Appetizers be shortened to &#34;apps?&#34; They have a selection of tacos they refer to as &#34;street tacos. &#34; Is Bar Louie trying to conjure up the aesthetic of urban Mexico?  What street are they referring to? Jefferson Avenue in Naperville?

Perhaps I was there on a dull night, but I was looking for a cool sports bar with good drinks, hot and satisfying food and a cool bartender to chat with since I am out of town alone on business. 
The drink menu was okay, being a beer and wine girl myself. The service was pretty good. The bartenders checked up a lot, but talked a bit more to each other than any of the guests. I am in the industry, so I understand that is a constant struggle. Still they were friendly enough.
I ordered the veggie flat bread, which was something to the effect of a massive saltine with some sautéed veggies on top. All in all a unsatisfying experience. I probably wouldn&#39;t rush back."

Since I went to college around the corner, I started visiting just for dinner, and now I drink and dine. There are so many things to review, so I&#39;ve broken it down!

FOOD: Their food is some of the best bar food I&#39;ve ever had. The burgers are incredible, the appetizers are all huge and tasty, and the salads are fresh and light. If you are a ranch dressing fan, don&#39;t leave here without using it...on everything! They make some of the best.

DRINKS: For a Naperville bar that doesn&#39;t specialize in beer, they actually have a great variety. This is also one of the only bars that has specials geared towards the holiday (ie green beer and seasonal cocktails). Watch what you order though, some of the martinis are pretty expensive!

SPECIALS: The food specials are awesome (re: appetizers) and if there&#39;s a drink special you like, order it, otherwise it can be pricey. 

BAR: The later it gets, the younger the crowd. No surprise here, but it can get pretty sloppy at the end of the night on the makeshift &#34;dance floor&#34;. The DJ is usually pretty great!"

I can&#39;t stand when servers sit down at your table to take your order like they freaking know you. I don&#39;t know who told them to do that, but it really pisses me off. That happened here multiple times.

The drinks are decent, but overpriced. And good luck getting a drink from the bar. It takes on average 15 to 20 minutes when busy. 

The food is average, just regular bar food, but also overpriced. Sometimes they have specials going on like $1 burgers on Tuesday nights. Just found this about thanks to another Yelper. So they have that going for them, but if you&#39;re going here just for the burgers, I recommend getting your burger to go, or sitting out on the patio so the douchey-ness doesn&#39;t rub off on you. The patio is pretty nice.

At night this place can get pretty crazy. It&#39;s like a dance club. And the &#39;bouncers&#39; at the front door are...well...douche-y.

People are friendly, the bar staff are efficient and usually friendly when ordering your drinks and the atmosphere is ok with a DJ starting at around 10 pm and a bunch of TVs around the bar.  The DJ usually mixes it up pretty good so no matter what, your always finding at least something to dance to. I like to dance so I&#39;m one of the few guys out there dancing not needing anyone else.  The drinks weren&#39;t too strong which is good for me since I&#39;m a lightweight but I guess not so good for people who like stronger drinks and they&#39;re fairly priced for a club.  Parking is right across the street in the parking garage if you can&#39;t find it within the strip mall.

I was told throughout the night I was a shoe-in to win; I had gone all-out with my costume. People were stopping me and asking for my picture throughout the night. I&#39;m guessing the contest was rigged and they waited for me to leave to have it.

False advertising. I wasted most of my night waiting for a stupid rigged contest at a pretty shitty bar... bunch of older drunk guys and a tiny, crowded space and dance floor and very slow service.

If you come here in the evening, the bartenders are scantily-clad. There is a dance floor (packed on the weekends). You seriously can&#39;t move in this place, it&#39;s standing-room-only. And there&#39;s tons of bros standing around outside. I feel like I always run into people from college here, yikes. 

Their food is ok. Standard bar food, I can&#39;t complain. Their beer selection is pretty much just like whatever you&#39;ll find at Buffalo Wild Wing&#39;s...meaning, they have their head up their butt thinking that they are giving you all these options, but those lavish options include Woodchuck, Shock Top, and Dos Equis. I mean hey, I like all those things, but if you are going to act like you have this amazing beer selection, then get some actual craft brews, ya know?

My friends and I  left and bar hopped, and realized that we actually should have stayed at Bar Louie. The drinks are way too expensive which prompted me to just stick with whiskey shots pretty much the entire night. Skip all of that juice and give me a buzz!! The drinks were like 12 bucks and up.

There wasn&#39;t much parking in the parking lot which is always frustrating, so we had to pay for garage parking down the street (spending money before we even get in the place = not good). 

The place itself is alright? I guess? Very average size, it&#39;s virtually a big open square. The bar is long but it still seems to take an average time of 20 minutes to get one drink (I didn&#39;t time it, but I bet I&#39;m close). 

Loud, mainstream music, as most people have noted already. Drinks are slightly overpriced. It really upset me that I drove nearly 40 minutes with some friends to come here, and really didn&#39;t have a great time. 

They do offer decent specials during the week, but not any on the weekend that I was aware of.

It&#39;s fairly close to a couple of other bars, which is nice in case you tend to bar-hop as much as we do.

I am actually a big fan of the food here, I think it is better than a lot of the other bar food in the area. I usually get the shrimp poboy sandwich and there is a good salmon sandwich there as well. A girlie and I used to go here every Thursday my last year of college and have our catch up time, split a dish of fish &amp; chips and have a beer.
It also opens at 11 so I would go there to watch my UEFA when in season since I lack cable.

On weekend nights, it is extremely difficult to find seating. I mean I think a lot of people do dance there so not having a seat isn&#39;t the worst thing in the world, just wear comfy shoes!

My main complaint are the mixed drinks, they are just extremely watered down and on the higher end. They also recently got rid of my I.P.A. (Harpoon) so that was pretty disappointing.

Also, does anyone else seem to notice that this can be a bit of a &#34;cougar-ville&#34;? I expected since it was so close to North Central College that I&#39;d see a lot more college faces there, but I never really have. I got a lot of dance offers from married men and a lot of the women, though beautiful and took care of themselves, were obviously mothers that looked like they raided their pre-teen&#39;s daughter closet for a going out ensemble.
So I felt like me and my friends were the awkward youngsters that stuck out like sour thumbs on most nights haha.

I am also apparently the only one that thinks it is strange they have bean bag toss during the week nights. Seriously, in a bar? That just seems like an accident waiting to happen haha."

If you are in the mood so potentially see some of the more guido-esque people from surrounding suburbs who migrate into Naperville for a night out this is a good place to go. I am not sure where these guidos and cougars come from but they seem to enjoy this watering hole. I think some students come here too. I mean I go there too- and I am not a cougar, guido or student, so it&#39;s a mix I guess. 
I used to go here on Wednesday nights when they have $5 buckets of bud diesel/bud light, which is an excellent deal. You have to be careful and go early though, because it becomes difficult to get a table and as the night goes on the beers get warmer and warmer (because they don&#39;t refrigerate most of  them ahead of time). 
Parking tip: if you go slightly past the bar toward NC college there is a little alleyway and you can go down that and there are usually (not always) parking spots in the back. Much better than the parking garage across the street which is always full!"

The round booths around the outside of the restaurant give casual diners like us a more date-like atmosphere, while hardcore sports fans can pull up a bar stool or high table closer to the TVs.

The staff is friendly and, if you&#39;re regulars like us, remembers your drink order indefinitely--we even had one of the waitresses ask &#34;did you guys get engaged&#34; after we&#39;d been away for MONTHS! The bar where everyone knows your name? Maybe not, but it was a nice touch.

As I mentioned, we go there primarily for $2 burger night, which is a great deal. I do have to express my regrets to the recent transition away from the fries, though--what once was included in the meal now has to be ordered as a $4 basket. Regrettable, even if it is enough for two people. Also, might I suggest getting the fries unsalted? They come with plenty of their own sodium. 

I&#39;ve never sampled anything else on the menu, but I consider it to be a bit too expensive for bar fare. Keep an eye on the specials to determine your best night to come.

If you&#39;re looking for a relaxing night on the town with low-key fun, this is your place. Enjoy!"

Their menu has changed slightly of late but still has most of my favorites. They have good deals: Monday night is half off everything on the menu, Tuesday night is $2 burgers (toppings cost a bit more, but you still can&#39;t beat it with a stick, and it&#39;s not a wee widget of a burger for that price, it&#39;s a full-sized meal of a burger). Fridays are !Fiesta! themed, with cheap nachos, tacos, Dos Equis and margaritas. 

A friend and I went last night for dinner and took advantage of the burger deal; my burger with blue cheese dressing and grilled onions was juicy, flavorful and less than $5. 

Because we were there between 5 &amp; 7, appetizers were half priced as well (a pleasant surprise); we got the Bavarian pretzle sticks, fresh soft pretzles artfully served in a cone with three condiments: honey mustard, queso, and cinnamon butter. The cinnamon butter is a recent addition (or rather, a curtain call, according to our waitress; I knew it wasn&#39;t previously one of the options, but she said it was brought back lately), and it&#39;s delicious, and I like the queso too. My friend liked the mustard, though I&#39;m not a mustard fan so I couldn&#39;t say. 

Cocktails aren&#39;t cheap (I got a black cherry mojito, and my fiend got Louie&#39;s Cosmo, which were $10 each), but they were decently sized (especially mine, which came in a glass the same size as my water glass! My friend&#39;s was smaller). Both drinks were good; nice balance of juice to liquor, not too weak or too overwhelming. My black cherry mojito had the fresh fruit (strawberries and blackberries) muddled in it with the mint; mojitos can be tricky -- too much mint and it tastes toothpaste-y, too much fruit and it tastes like candy, too much booze and you&#39;ve thrown off the balance, but all three harmonized nicely. 

We sat outside, and the clientele was a mix: young business guys talking loudly about finances and trying to force their smoking on the people around them (&#34;You ladies don&#39;t mind if we smoke, do you?&#34;), North Central students and yuppie types. Our waitress on this occasion was sometimes remote but got the job done in the end; this is usually the story here. 

Inside is usually darker and can get loud. I wish the atmosphere was a bit less bar-ish, or that the bar had a separate area, because of this; if you come to dine, it can seem boorish. It&#39;s not a sports bar or a dive place, so you&#39;d think they&#39;d want to brush up their atmosphere somewhat. At least during our brief summer season there is some outdoor seating. 

All in all, I like the food, service is fair, and atmosphere needs improvement."

I wish we would have stayed at the places we visited before here, and just had a good time.  Absolutely felt no discrimination at the 3 other places we visited before hand.

I may be too used to pubs, rural bars and college bars in Normal, IL.  But this place truly pissed me of.  Each and every time I went.

So, I&#39;m a bit poor.  I&#39;m living off student loans and such, so I can&#39;t afford to drink at expensive bars.  Cheapest beer?  Bud Lime for $2.  Really?  That&#39;s what I have to drink here.

The people there?  Loud and the type of people that picked on me my entire life.  The music?  Loud as motherloving hell.  I hate a place with music that loud.  I have to shout to the people across the table from me.  That&#39;s not right.

It&#39;s also so crowded that there&#39;s usually a line outside.  And the bar?  It takes about 20 minutes to get to the bar and order a drink.  So I&#39;d always order mine two at a time.  One to drink and one to drink while waiting.

I&#39;d stop going, but I have friends who love this place.  And I end up going with them.  And later on: suffering from Bud Light induced beer shits.

So, here&#39;s the deal.  This bar may be just what you want.  Trendy, pretentious, loud and chuck full of girls that never stopped living their sorority life-style and guys who never stopped living their fraternity lifestyle.  For me?  No.  I&#39;ll go to Frankie&#39;s Blue Room.

Did I mention that I met Drew Peterson here?  Yeah, him."

My book club has met here for many years, and quite honestly, we are never disappointed with the service or the quality of the food.  I think the prices are commensurate with the fare and the local market.
Now, we always visit on tuesday evening, which happens to be dollar burger night, and many of us partake of this awesome special. We don&#39;t all order the burger however.  They have an excellent salmon salad, and a tasty mufallata sandwich.  The fries are good, and I think the beer is reasonably priced.  Additionally, there is always a beer special or two.  Don&#39;t even attempt to park in the directly adjacent lot,unless you have a horseshoe strategically placed in one or more bodily orifices, or is it orifi?  I digress.

They took my favorite salad off the menu.  That was the final straw.

The food isn&#39;t so bad, but the last meal I had there (Salmon Eggs Benedict) was lukewarm and generally blah.  Drinks can be on the pricey side, and you are almost guaranteed to be served by an apathetic hottie who has better things to do than check up on your table.  The worst thing about this location, though, is the late night clientele: college-aged bros and hoes with a sprinkling of 38-year-old NaperMoms having a kuh-raaaazy ladies&#39; nite out!!!  I&#39;ll pass, thanks.

P.S. - The last time I went (1ish on a Sunday afternoon) there was a large table nearby of yuppie parents and young (age 5ish?) children.  It was a child&#39;s birthday party.  I&#39;M SORRY, THERE IS NO WAY THAT KID ASKED TO GO TO BAR LOUIE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY PARTY.  SWEET JESUS.  THERE IS NOTHING FUN FOR HIM TO DO THERE.  HE&#39;S FUCKING FIVE.

The service was OK...kind of slow to get the meal, but the server was fine.  I guess the biggest complaint was the condition of the booth we sat in.  I was sitting across from my daughters and noticed how stained it was.  My daughter leaned her head back at one point, then turned around to find food stuck on the booth!

We asked an employee for numbers for cab companies, and he had to give us 3 before getting through to one.

I understand that it is a bar but all that I am saying is that I personally feel more comfortable in a more restrurante style place yet really like their burger.  If you don&#39;t know what I mean by that, think of the atmosphere of a place like Maggiano&#39;s or Capitale Grill or Buca De Beppo or Brio."

I have been there when the DJ is there on weekends... and no one is dancing... even when it has been crowded... this place has ZERO appeal to me, the only reason why I have gone back is just cuz my friends have used as a meeting place - exactly because it is a BIG square bar, and easy to find people... but we always move on...."

Usually, after we park our cars in the deck across the street, this is usually the first place we hit up.  If you are coming here on a Friday or Saturday night, forget about it.  It takes forever to get a drink and my friends and I have walked out because we are tired of waiting.  I think they have a burger special on Tuesday for a buck or something like that and that&#39;s not too bad.  The drinks tend to be weak so I stick with beer.  If you are coming here with coworkers or friends in the early evening, this place is alright, but anytime else, I get annoyed quick!"

First of all, this is a younger staff in a suburban taproom. They are not exquisitely trained cicerone. They work hard and in my opinion it shows. 

The kitchen is good. Everything from the stupidly large and greasy pretzel to the simple bbq wings. 

The prices on the beer are what I saw to be related to the most gripes, and it&#39;s standard. 5-8 a pint! 

Your complaints are most likely rooted in the fact that a place like this finally exists in western springs and you need to pay them money.

The beers are served in their appropriate glass, at the appropriate temperature. I tied one on and ate to my heart&#39;s content and even received a complimentary shot (from what I assume was a shift lead or manager? It was the nice guy with glasses) and was only 50-ish out the door before tip. Which I left heartily. 

The shot tasted like Barbie threw up in it, but I was a few deep and it was free. Thanks y&#39;all!

Anyway...

I was the only twenty something there last night and if I had to assume I would place me at the very bottom of the age bracket in attendance, just above the eager and plentiful staff. 

If you have a bad experience here, chalk it up to expectations, it&#39;s your own fault. The golden rule flies like a bird...

With that being said, this place has some local Easter eggs and is most likely a great idea in a great location. Well executed, just remember to bring your wallet. There ARE two dollar signs."

This little town has so many, many good things to offer residents and visitors alike.  Not to mention, the area is so picture perfect.  

So, it&#39;s no surprise that an establishment like Hillgove Tap, make this location its home.  My friend and I ended up having lunch here when the place next door happened to be closed, which I am not even remotely upset about because my experience here was so good!

For starters the ambiance here is warm and cozy.  The dark wood, exposed brick and service make it a great place to go all year round.  For lunch, I ordered  the Steak Salad: mixed greens, flat iron steak, tomatoes, avocado, crispy onions &amp; balsamic vinaigrette.  This steak was cooked exactly like I requested, the flavors of marinade were outstanding and for a salad, they certainly knew how to elevate it to something more than just a salad. I finished my meal feeling sated, satisfied and oh so happy! 

I loved my first experience here so much that I am putting this place on my regular rotation when school starts back up in August!"

Didn&#39;t have much but a beer a few apps but I can give my initial opinion on what I experienced thus far here. Off jump, they have a very nice selection of beers and even more importantly they have quite a few on tap so you have a nice range of beers to taste before getting one which is important for any bar to thrive! I had a strong Belgium pale ale which was very smooth and good in my opinion.

On to the apps I tried. The table I was at split 3 apps, nachos, poutine &amp; the pretzel. The nachos were phenomenal! The pulled pork on top of them had a nice flavor BBQ sauce which complemented them perfectly. The poutine plate was good but I didn&#39;t too much care about the sauce that was on it. The pretzel was nice and soft but I wasn&#39;t really a fan of the beer cheese mustard sauce that came with it.

The service was good, waiter was friendly. They have nice clear large TVs for watching the games. All in all, I&#39;m definitely willing to return here when in the area and try an actual entree. Maybe I&#39;ll have an entrée that&#39;ll Impress me enough to boost them to a 5 star."

We came here on a frigid Saturday night, and it was pretty packed, but we were seated in about 5 minutes. There was an obvious table for 2 right near the door, but since it would be cold with the door opening and closing, they waited until something else opened up. I thought that was a nice thought, since a person would probably end up being miserable and wanting to move shortly after sitting there. 

Once seated we were given a beer/cocktail and food menu. The food is jazzier bar food. They have a decent tap beer list, and even more in bottles and cans to order. There are definitely other bars close by that have way more on tap, but there was enough variety here to be interesting.

My sis and I both got a beer flight- 3 samples for $8 of any of the on-tap beers. They came out shortly after on a beer-sample paddle, which had the space for 4 beers. They even had an empty 4th glass in the paddle. Why can&#39;t you just sell 4 samples then?? That was strange to me.

For food, we tried their pulled pork nachos, and we each had a burger. The nachos were really good, with a nice balance of all ingredients. The actual app is kind of small for the price ($10), but it was enough for both of us to share (and finish) until our burgers came. The burgers come in single and double patty size. We both got singles, and the patty is still a pretty decent thickness overall- not paper-thin like you might get at steak n shake or something. The burger had good flavor, the fries were hot and fresh, but maybe a little bland? I was able to take half the meal home by the end though and was grateful for leftovers the next day. 

Overall, I had a good time and would like to go back."

The atmosphere is warm and inviting, with a bit of hipster funk and charm. We came on a Tuesday night and the place was BUMPIN! Our table ordered several appetizers (nacho bites, poutine, and pretzels) to go with our beers, Moscow mules, and old fashioned&#39;s. The nacho bites were by far the table favorite and easy to share. I think the restaurant was short staffed that night, so while the staff was AWESOME and so accommodating, the wait times were a little long and the food had cooled down significantly by the time it reached us. Understandable, of course, and I think it merits another try for the food. Drinks were great, the company was lovely, and we very much enjoyed our time here."

Well I went back and couldn&#39;t feel any more opposite than my initial review. First, it took 30 minutes before anyone even realized we hadn&#39;t even been served water yet. Then when we finally got water we quickly wanted to place our food order because after a half hour with the menu we had plenty of time to figure out what we wanted. Well....they were out of burgers and a few other items...pretty much half their menu! Why no one felt the need to tell us this before we were even seated is beyond me. The food they did have was overcooked from frozen and the fries were cold waffle fries - not the delicious skinny fries I had on my first visit and the ones listed in their menu. I don&#39;t know what happened to this place other than terrible management. Don&#39;t waste your time. Skip this spot. I know I&#39;ll never be back."

When the server brought us our beers she set them down right in front of the baby who then promptly grabbed them and spilled them all over the place, including me and the entire table. We received no help cleaning it up and had to ask for towels to clean. We then had to ask for all new silverware, as she didn&#39;t offer any of this to us. We ordered the fried deviled eggs as an appetizer. It tasted good but for the price I was expecting more than 2 pieces of food.

Located across from the train tracks at the corner of Hillgrove and Wolf, parking can be a bit of a challenge.  Just drive around the block a few times and you&#39;ll score a spot.

So I brought my Dad here for a beer and brat and an unseasonable warm late December day.

Trying to navigate this place with stairs was a bit of a challenge with my 91 year old Dad but the staff was kind.  We didn&#39;t want to sit in the bar area with high stools so we walked up a few stairs to the main dining room.  TIP:  if you have some with you that is elderly or a child in a stroller, there is ramp on the other side of the main dining room.

My Dad loved his brat on a pretzel roll and fresh cut fries.  I had fish and chips.  They were good but I can&#39;t really rave about them.  The service was excellent.  We were here at noon on a weekday and I could see this place getting really crowded on weekend nights.  They have seating outside when the weather permits.

So, LaGrange has Palmer&#39;s Place and a bunch of other resties with outdoor seating and huge beer lists.  Now Western Springs can brag that they have something similar.

The servers (and this cracked me up) are all wannabe hipsters in lily white Western Springs.  Lots of beards and I think I saw one manbun but they were kind to my Dad and the woman owner was on-site so all good.

We will be back.  I liked the Sports Theme.  And the lightening is very cool.  Hard to believe this place is in Western Springs....well done!"

A shout out to Jacqueline B for organizing this event. The restaurant is in a great location on the corner of Hillgrove and Wolf Road.  There are two rooms, the bar room with an L-shape bar with stools and some tables and then a back dining area with tables.  There are TVs to watch your favorite sports team, too.  On a Wednesday night, this place was completely full, a popular place for sure.  Hillgrove has an extensive beer menu offering canned, bottled and craft beers on tap.  My husband had a Stone Arrogant Bastard Ale and I had a traditional Moscow Mule. Our table shared appetizers...Catio&#39;s Fish Tacos which were three corn tortilla tacos with beer battered cod and a spicy Siracha mayo; Fried Deviled Eggs which were two deep fried balls with soft cooked eggs inside; and Hillgrove Poutine which had large waffle fries topped with pork, gravy, cheese and scallions. All three were tasty. My favorite, though, were the tacos. The Poutine was also tasty but would be better served with the gravy, pork and cheese distributed throughout the fries because the middle and bottom fries were just...plain fries. The toppings were lacking (see my photo).  My husband I had both ordered the patty melt which was a perfectly grilled sandwich with a single juicy patty topped with melted Swiss cheese and carmelized onions served with thin crispy seasoned fries. It was definitely yummy and I loved the fries!  Josh, our server, was friendly, attentive and provided good service. The prices are reasonable and the food good. It&#39;s a great place to watch the game with a beer and noshing on good food. Note...I had a great time meeting, eating and drinking with fellow Yelpers."

My friend and I were just looking to have a few beers at the bar, when the hostess informed us that we needed to put our name down just sit there. I wasn&#39;t willing to wait the 45+ minutes to sit at a bar.

A few days later we went back, there&#39;s plenty of seating at the bar and within the restaurant.  We opted for the bar. The tap beer selection was nothing to rave about. The bartender suggested an IPA, after I told her I was looking for a stout or porter. 

We ordered poutine, wings and a burger. The only thing we didn&#39;t return was the poutine, the burger and wings were undercooked.

With a slim tap beer menu, and our food experience I&#39;m not sure I will be returning."

The beer was good. It was in a bottle- so hooray for that. 

Everything was downhill from there. If you have Carlos for your server- you may as well leave. Possibly the most clueless, lost, server I&#39;ve ever had. 

Our appetizers took 30 minutes- for chili and poutine. We saw other tables walk in after us, order drinks and food- and be served before we got our apps! 

When they finally arrived- and at no time during the 30 minute absence- did Carlos take our order for mains. The apps came and he tried to run off- we had to beg to place our order. 

The beer burger was tasty- albeit the greasiest burger I&#39;ve ever had. Half was well done, half was nearly rare. 

Fries are the coated type- which stays in a warmer longer, and ours were oily and tepid. 

Had to ask two servers for ketchup and mustard.  

Ambience is typical bar- but at 120dB noise level. 

I&#39;d try it once more- but stipulation that Carlos doesn&#39;t serve us. 

Best of luck!"

I loved their soft pretzel appetizer and chicken sandwich. Two very good choices!!! The chicken sandwich is a chicken thigh and the Siracha mayo slaw compliments it nicely!

The fish itself was a 2 by 2 by 4 inch piece w/ a great looking batter.

The family all liked what they got and portions were good. 

Our service, though,  was soooooooo slow. It wasn&#39;t overly full, and as far as I could tell, there were 2 servers, two runners, and the bartender. We were completely finished with our first beers (that took 15 min to get) by the time we were able to flag down our waitress just to take our order.

I have been here several times and have never had a good experience. They are not open until their posted hours, so if you go be sure to call ahead. Several times we have called ahead on Monday nights around 9 (they supposedly are open past eleven) with a large party of ten who want drinks and appetizers, and they tell us that they&#39;re closing. Tonight, we were told not to come, but we drove past and saw a patio full of people. Once, we were told not to come even though one of the group was already there. When we show up without calling, two hours before their posted closing hour, they are very obviously displeased to have customers. There is nothing quite like going to spend money at a restaurant, and be met with staff that clearly doesn&#39;t want to be there. I know hat Monday nights aren&#39;t usually big nights for restaurant/bars, but I&#39;d expect them to stay open until their own closing time.

Service was slow, especially getting food and drinks to our table. When our waitress suggested a beer similar to what I had ordered, I tried it and immediately returned it and had something else. When the bill was presented, instead of removing that beer from the tab, we were billed for it. It took several layers of management to have it removed....not a good practice when my other 2 beers, which were fine, were $11. each. Not a fan, and won&#39;t be back."

With such little space to work the Tap is doing it&#39;s best with the bar area and table seating.  One downfall is the seating directly in front of the restrooms a bit awkward but gives it a college atmosphere.  Very good beer selection and burgers rule the day at the Tap.

This place was an excellent choice. The weather was nice so all of the other customers were sitting outside under string lights. We decided to sit inside at the bar. The bartender (didn&#39;t catch her name) was super nice. She took our orders and checked in on us throughout. The food was good and so was the beer selection. The place is located on a quiet street corner with a large parking lot in back. The interior has a modern, industrial vibe to it. It&#39;s well lit and has plenty of seating with windows all around and several TVs. I recommend this place if you&#39;re ever looking for a clean, friendly sports bar to drink, eat, and watch a game."

Great beer selection, but I&#39;m hooked on their Moscow Mules.  My husband had the Hot Toddy, which was a treat.  They do a magnificent job in creating the perfect craft cocktail.  As far as the desserts go - - they are amazing.  We&#39;ve had 3 of the 4 and it gets hard to decide because they are all so, so good!  The staff is very friendly, accommodating, and professional.

I&#39;ve heard about Marquette, and driven by a few times, but hadn&#39;t had the opportunity to stop in till then.  I immediately liked the feel, it&#39;s cozy, the staff at the bar told me the hostess would be right up to seat us, but if we saw a place we liked, we could sit anywhere.  We chose a booth in the back, behind the bar area in the front of the restaurant.

We were starving, so I mentioned to the waitress we were interested in an appetizer, and asked for recommendations, we went with the bruschetta, and it did not disappoint, I liked the balsamic glaze, and the chunky shaving of parmesan cheese. There was such a generous portion, that we did not finish the appetizer.  I scanned the menu for vegetarian items for myself, there were a few, but I asked the waitress if the kitchen could turn the fish taco&#39;s into a vegetarian taco using the portabella mushrooms from another menu item, she quickly sked the kitchen, and said it was no problem. My oldest ordered the Egg and Bacon burger without the onion jam, and my youngest ordered the Kids Mac &amp; Cheese with a side salad.  

The food was prepared quickly, and I LOVED the tacos.  They had great flavor, and fresh ingredients.  The sauce that came on the side was also quite good, and added an extra depth of flavor.  My daughter liked her burger, it was huge, and as expected, she ate about half before she was completely full.  My other daughter ate her kids meal with no comments, so I can assume she liked it.  We didn&#39;t order dessert since we were all completely full.  I loved that they had my favorite cider on tap, and that is enough to keep me coming back, the food quality and quantity definitely put it in the 5 star category.  The service on my visit was great.  We will be back!"

I stop here on occasion because the fish tacos are delicious, the restaurant itself has a great atmosphere to it and the beer selection is good too. 

However, I&#39;ve tried the filet sliders twice now, and both times, my &#34;medium&#34; cooked sliders turned out medium-rare or rare with a red center. 

I paid a visit this past Saturday. My boyfriend and I arrived and placed our to go order at 5:45pm and didn&#39;t leave with our food until just after 6:30. There were about 8 people seated at the bar but the restaurant wasn&#39;t too busy otherwise. I saw three orders come out of the kitchen ahead of ours, maybe 4 entrees for here and 3-4 packed up to go. 

I asked the waitress if the kitchen was understaffed and she told us &#34;well, I think all the orders went in at once&#34;. I said, &#34;yeah, but that was a solid 45 minutes&#34;. The response I got was, &#34;well maybe they&#39;re just waking up, I dunno&#34; and a shrug. At my restaurant, if people are waiting for more than 25-30 minutes for entrees or over 8-10 minutes for appetizers, the server is asking the kitchen how long the food will take and establishing communication with the guest. The manager might even swing by and say hello to the table, offer an apology if necessary. Bottom line, 45 minutes on a to-go order with ten people in the restaurant is unacceptable. Marquette, you really need to work on your ticket times.

With this being the second time trying them, the sliders were once again undercooked. And I was a bit disappointed with the quality of customer service as someone who works in the industry. 

Overall, I&#39;m not really in a rush to come back."

So I was surprised, but not completely turned off, when I walked in and found Marquette to be quite generic in appearance and resembling more of a neighborhood tavern or basement bar more than anything else.

The restaurant is clean, and the service is friendly.  Our waitress was up to date with what beers were unavailable which was helpful.  Business was sleepy on a Monday night, it was just our group of 3, a group of 3 younger guys, and maybe another two people seated at the bar.

I had the Schlafly Pumpkin beer, 1 of 2 pumpkin brews available, and really enjoyed it.  There are a good variety of &#34;normal&#34; beers and craft beers available.  There is a wine list, but $11 for a glass of Kim Crawford?  Beer prices are much more reasonable.

The caprese salad was disappointing.  The fried mozzarella put a nice twist on this dish, but it was overcooked and slightly burnt.  My friends enjoyed their tacos and filet sliders though.  Food prices are also reasonable.

We ordered hummus to share at the table, but they were out of hummus.  Instead, our waitress still delivered enough hummus and pita to our table to make up a 1/2 order, and they did not charge us for this.  They even brought us some complimentary bruschetta which was quite thoughtful.

I like Marquette as a quiet neighborhood bar and was pleasantly surprised that it was not what I initially thought it was.  The food was just OK for me personally, but that would not prevent me from coming back for drinks again."

They have a decent beer selection.  We sat at the bar and the service was decent.  I got the sliders, which were just okay for me.  I felt like they were a bit more rare than medium rare but the quality of meat did not seem to lend itself to being that rare.  However, not bad preparation.

She didn&#39;t even want to tell us her name so I will give her physical description in hopes the owners will take corrective action.  She is heavy set with dark hair, probably 23 years old with a face that reminds me of the Paulie character from the original Rocky film.

It is a quaint place not much seating but they were not crowded. Not sure about the 4/5 rating. The wait for food was a little long, then 3 of our burgers were burnt on one side which created a bitter and charred taste. One of my boys had the filet sliders he said they were good while the other had a grilled cheese panini. Hard to mess up the grilled cheese.  Our waitress disappeared after serving the food.

Downtown Lombard is on the upswing and desperately needs more restaurants, in my opinion. So we came for dinner on a Friday night before a beer tasting in Lilacia Park. 

The space is clean, industrial-ish, nicely updated. We seated ourselves in a back booth, and were helped right away.

The food menu is still pretty limited - two appetizers, a couple salads, a handful of burgers and sandwiches, a few other entrees, a couple desserts. But you know, I&#39;m OK with this, better to do a few things well than none terribly. They did have a few specials on the chalkboard, the server did not highlight them but that&#39;s OK. They also have a full bar (of course) and a very solid beer selection.

We started with bruschetta, a very solid entry with tasty garlicky tomatoes. My husband had the filet sliders, and I had the chicken pesto panini, which was very good, although not super pesto-y (the harvati and delicious bacon balanced it out). Side choices are chips, slaw or potato salad. I&#39;m very picky about my coleslaw or potato salad, so we both went with chips.

The food was very tasty, and the service was solid. I do hope that they add a few more menu items -- I&#39;d love to see a couple more appetizers, maybe some tots or fries as a side option. (Free idea, guys -- use that bacon chili to make chili cheese fries?) But if they&#39;re still figuring things out, it&#39;s all good -- I think Marquette is going in the right direction and is an excellent addition to downtown Lombard."

I loved that they used chalkboard wall menus, but they were hard to read if you were not facing them. All of the food is made from scratch, and comes from local vendors and farms. 

We ordered the Hummus with warm pita bread. The hummus was outstanding! Fresh made, whole pieces of garlic garnish, not too smooth, not too chunky. We still had some dip left over but the pita was gone, we got a whole &#39;nother order for free so we could scoop every last mushy bit from the dish.

I ordered a Passion Fruit wheat beer, and my BF ordered a good standard Weiss beer as well. Mmmmmmm it was one of the best beers I have had. The food and drinks were reasonably priced, but still a little expensive for just an app, 2 beers and a pop for my daughter. We will definitely be back."

There&#39;s fun black and white photos adorning the walls and a wall of windows at the front to peek out at the passers by.

Unfortunately, that&#39;s about all I have positive to say... YET. We got there at 8:45 but because the kitchen closes at 9, we weren&#39;t able to order food. The waitress handed us a huge, extensive, impressive beer menu, but the first three beers our group tried to order, they didn&#39;t have. The fourth was there in the case, but just as the waitress was about to tell us they didn&#39;t have that, either, we pointed it out to her and she brought it over. They didn&#39;t have Pinot Grigio. Two of our 5 member party decided not to drink at all because they were out of so many things. The waitress wavered between embarrassed (which I get - totally not her fault they don&#39;t have anything they offer on the menu) and a little bit rude (which I don&#39;t get - you don&#39;t have to be cold and snotty when people ask for things the bar says they have). After a round of soda, water, and a couple of cocktails, we left.

Now, this experience was indeed bad, HOWEVER, I&#39;ve heard from a few people that the food menu at this place is rockin, so if I&#39;m in the area, I may come back and subsequently re-review. For now, well... The ceiling is nice. And that&#39;s about it."

It&#39;s right in the heart of downtown Lombard on St. Charles. Easily found it with its lit-up sign. Wasn&#39;t too busy on this Thursday night, so we grabbed a table by the bar. They had a pretty long beer list: about 8 beers on tap, including Revolution, Bells, Penrose, etc. and a lot of bottles and cans. No shortage of craft beer here! The menu, though not very big, had some decent options. I ordered the filet sliders and my husband ordered fish tacos.

We also ordered a side salad, which was very basic: a diced tomato, lettuce, shredded cheese and maybe some carrot bits. It was a side salad, so I guess I can&#39;t be too picky about it, but I would have liked some variety in the greens. However, the food that we got was incredibly delicious. I was pleasantly surprised. It&#39;s not your typical bar fare. The meat on my filet burger was super tender, juicy, and well-seasoned. And it also had havarti cheese (ooo fancy) and came on a pretzel bun. I was full with those 3 sliders and very well-fed. My husband enjoyed his fish tacos too, saying the fish was cooked really well.

Last night my boyfriend and I decided to give them a try. I really liked the look of this place, the bar area is very nice, you can sit at the bar and they have a few high tops as well. They have tvs  throughout so it&#39;s great to go watch a game. We sat in the back area where the dining room is at since we had my 2 year old with. In the back they have 3 booths and a few tables. Not very big but it&#39;s a nice space. 
We were greeted right away and were brought our menus. I was kind of disappointed that the menu is not very big, not many choices. If you are looking for a full meal I would not go here. They have burgers, sliders, tacos and salads. There are 2 choices for kids, Mac and cheese and grilled cheese served with grapes and apple slices. I ordered a house salad with grilled chicken and my boyfriend had the jerk fish tacos. My little one got the grilled cheese. We were all satisfied with our choices. My boyfriend loved his tacos, he kept talking about the sauce. My salad was just a salad, I must say the grilled chicken was marinated nicely and was very flavorful. My daughters grilled cheese was like the one I could have made at home, nothing special.

I immediately noticed how clean and updated it was inside and decided to take a seat at the bar. 

There were two bartenders attending to guests right by me and neither of them greeted me. It&#39;s not difficult to say &#34;Hello, be right with you!&#34; after pouring a drink or taking someone elses order. I continued to wait a total of 6 minutes before being waited on. This wouldn&#39;t be that big of a deal if one of the bartenders wasn&#39;t constantly socializing with other employees before continuing what they get paid to do.

I ordered a classic burger that came with chips and would&#39;ve been much better if they served it with fries. However, the burger was very tasty and cooked exactly how I asked. I was quite impressed.

Since I enjoyed my meal so much, I gave them one more chance to redeem my first impression and asked for 3 different types drinks. The drinks I requested aren&#39;t uncommon and are available at every bar I&#39;ve ever been to. Apparently Marquette doesn&#39;t carry them.

I&#39;ve lived here for six years and never saw anything in the old Amazing Graze storefront. Would anything go in there, ever? I certainly didn&#39;t think that we&#39;d have a solid bar with a multitude of beer selections on tap and a growing menu with tasty fare in that spot. 

Fans of their Facebook page were tipped off to last night&#39;s soft opening, and while I&#39;m a bit jealous of missing it, my family saw lit neon signs as we drove downtown on our way to lunch. We didn&#39;t realize that the back door is in the same place at the back door to 20 West, but we tried the front door with happy results.

Many people love Daisycutter Pale Ale, which was one of the dozen or so taps at the bar. Instead, I opted for a White IPA from Penrose Brewing, a Geneva company ran by former high school classmates. (I didn&#39;t really know them; I wasn&#39;t cool enough, you know, way back when.) Their bottle and can selection is fairly extensive as well. You can get one of many microbrews, something familiar, or even a can of Hamm&#39;s. If you wanted to for some reason. (Guess I&#39;m still not hip like that.) 

My wife and I split a cheeseburger with havarti and three jerk fish tacos. We had to wait a while; our pleasant server Heidi informed us that the brand-new grill needed a little more seasoning. But we were happy with the fare when it arrived. The burger offered fresh vegetables, a fine bun, and beef that had a great savory quality to it upon initial contact with the tongue. I don&#39;t know how to describe it, but it made me salivate right away and a half was gone in an instant. The tacos were decent, though I would&#39;ve liked a heavier hand with the jerk seasoning. But hey, they&#39;re fish tacos! Good stuff.

Their menu should be greater in scope within a week, but there&#39;s enough right now for most people. I didn&#39;t check to see if Malort was available. Perhaps I&#39;ll ask for it next time and see if they keep a straight face.

There are enough TVs to please sports fans, but not so many that they take away from the decor, which includes a little local flavor on the walls.

Noting the limitations of the space, it&#39;s sad that there isn&#39;t room for more tables. Too bad they can&#39;t magically switch places with Balkan Bakery, which has a great deck but has yet to open. Parties of 8 will likely end up disappointed if they&#39;re looking to share a big table here, but I like to think that I can go there alone and make seven new friends. First indications are that Marquette Kitchen &amp; Tap could be that kind of place.

Come on, Lombardians. Don&#39;t sit on this one. The owners invested in us; it&#39;s time to return the favor."

The tilapia was seasoned very well and juicy on the fish tacos. The sauce complimented the flavor of the jerk. Very good fish tacos.

Everything was very tasty, and I have no real substantive complaints, besides 2 minor details that prevented me rating 5 stars (although I would have given 4.5 if I had the option).

My date and I split the Bruschetta appetizer, Pesto Chicken Sandwich, and the Filet Sliders on Pretzel Rolls.

The appetizer was very tasty, a traditional bruschetta - well executed. However, the tomatoes were diced and I prefer a slice; just personal preference though.

The Pesto Chicken Sandwich was amazing. If I recall correctly, the menu had a small symbol next to a few of the &#34;Signature Dishes&#34; and this sandwich should have been a signature item. Absolutely delicious. Perfectly cooked chicken, delicious pesto, 5/5.

The Filet Sliders were also delicious, but also a source of not receiving the perfect 5 star review. Even though they ended up being very tasty, I ordered them Rare and they came out Medium. Hardly a problem at all though, as they were still incredibly tender, delicious, and flavorful.

On top of that, the owner came over to our table and talked to us for a few minutes to make sure everything was alright, which was nice.

Other notes: The beer menu was extensive and varied which was a big bonus. Additionally, the bathroom and the rest of the establishment was very clean. Overall I&#39;d rate my experience as 4.5/5, but since I don&#39;t have that option I&#39;m going with 4 rather than 5. Definitely would recommend stopping in."

Their food menu has room for improvement but I would rather them get their few items right than not right at all. I informed the bartender of my veg. preferences and they said they could fix together a veggie sandwich. The sandwich contained spinach, mushrooms, and cheese and was pretty tasty with some hot sauce. Thank you, MK&amp;T for fulfilling my custom request! I think a vegetarian sandwich/burger would be a solid addition to your menu!

Service: Staff is friendly! Food was quick given my &#34;custom&#34; request.
Food: Like above, the menu is short (I had a peculiar &#34;This is it?&#34; voice in my head) but pretty good.
Value: Decent.

I&#39;ll be back here for drinks and I am excited to see how they grow! :)"

However, they are now fully staffed and it seems they have worked out all of the kinks.  I have to say, the food has always good and they are becoming more creative with their entree specials. Steak sliders are excellent!  Always a great beer selection too!  So happy to see this establishment thriving in downtown Lombard! 


Stopped in on the second day after they had opened and had a good experience.  However, those around me did not, as they waited upwards of an hour for a hamburger when the place was not very crowded.  At the time I chalked it up as &#34;they just opened&#34; and they are working out the kinks.  
After dinner and drinks tonight ( a week later), myself and our entire group were disappointed.  Not sure where to begin, long wait for our drinks, food cooked improperly...We waited 30 minutes just have out tab closed after our cash and cards were handed over.  The point where insult added to injury, was after they said we could split the tab on 2 different cards they decided to just run it on one.  With the lack of enthusiasm and quality of service from those managing this place I&#39;m going to have a hard time giving them my business. Hoping they step up their game and meet industry standards for the operation they are trying to pull off....the &#34;we just opened&#34; excuse can only last so long"

Large screen TV&#39;s with the &#34;events du jour&#34; provide continuous entertainment.  Good selection of alcohol and beer and a surprisingly good kitchen.  

We went around noon on a Sunday, had a couple of drinks each and had the Buffalo chicken sandwich and the filet sliders.  Chicken was cooked well, had good flavor without being overwhelmed by Buffalo sauce like these sandwiches sometimes are.  My wife had the filet sliders.  We could have shared the portion - three sliders on pretzel rolls with a tasty horseradish sauce.  They were excellent. Both of us had the homemade potato salad as a side which was very good.

This place is the perfect antidote to the antiseptic chain restaurants.  It provided a nice and relaxed atmosphere giving us the perfect kickstart to our Sunday.   Good food and drink, welcoming atmosphere and friendly people.  For us this place has exactly what we look for in this type of establishment.  We had a nice time and plan to be back frequently."

First impression was the comfortable &#34;old school- local pub&#34; feel.  Beautiful bar, tin ceiling and retro lighting made me want to find a babysitter and cozy up the the bar! Instead, we headed to the back room and found a table right away. We were told that booths are on order and should be installed soon, which should create more seating. 

  They are offering a smaller menu right now, with the full menu coming soon.  We started with the homemade hummus and warm pitabread- very tasty and not over mashed- just the way I like it. We also had the HUGE wedge salad- the thick cut bacon pieces set the tone for the rest of the meal! No cutting corners with bacon bits here!  Between the 4 of us we had the beef tacos on corn tortillas with a lovely Verde sauce and fresh cilantro, the steak sliders were delicious and the bacon cheeseburger with a fried egg was perfect! Again- that thick cut bacon is key!  We also tried the home made mac&amp; cheese. So good and cheesy! 

The beer list was so extensive that we just had to go back, without the kiddos, to see how many we could try!  There was a good crowd- it seems Lombard is happy to have this addition to the town! The beer did not disappoint, and the bartenders  were attentive, helpful and looked like they were have a great time too!

After all, I&#39;m from NYC and halal meat is big there. After eating non-halal meat, I can tell you there is a tenderness and depth of flavor in halal meat. Even though I toy with the idea of being vegetarian, I can appreciate a good cut of meat. This store carries it in the back, to the left of the food counter. It is halal, which essentially is an Arabic word for &#39;permissible&#39; which means the meat is permissible to eat in respect to the Islamic religion, which do not allow the consumption of animal hind quarters or pork. Zabihah refers to the respectful slaughter and care of the animals, who are prayed over and given a diet free of animal by-products. The animal is also bled upside down so the blood does not stay in the meat, as that is not halal quality. 

Anyway, this store reminds me of the bodegas in New York that I&#39;m used to seeing, and going to get food from for myself, the parental units or my friends. All I would have needed was a bendy straw and a chocolate yoohoo drink, and I&#39;d have been right back in Queens. But I digress. They have an aisle full of spices,
Curries and marinades and for vegetarians, there is a section where you can buy various types of beans by the pound. They also sell tea by the pound as well, and were carrying earl grey and jasmine the day I was there.  Previous reviews mentioned a long assortment of hookah materials and I can say those are 1000% correct. Along with the hot pots, Turkish coffee, halva and tons of other Mediterranean items.

I&#39;d heard about the food here in the carry out section of the store from other Yelp reviews, so that drove me to get two chicken shawarma sandwiches, a dozen falafel and a small tray of baklava. However, they had SO many great options for food that I would love to have tried, but my wallet wasn&#39;t that big (but for everything I got, I only spent $25) and my stomach wasn&#39;t either. 

Two big points for me as to why they get five stars:
One: the gentleman at the food counter offered to make my dozen falafel fresh for me, which would take 15 minutes. I was totally fine with that as it gave me time to browse the grocery and discover all the great things they are selling. Waiting the 15 minutes was worth it because the falafel were bomb. They need to rename them Warm Nuggets from  Heaven. The shawarma were just as great also, but I&#39;d expected it to be from the glorious smell they were emoting in my car. 
Two: The carry out items have to be purchased from the front and it forces you to look at all the yummy-ness they present for sale. When it was my turn to pay, I asked about all of these treats, from cream cheese filled baklava (I got the plain kind) to spinach and feta rolls and meat pies and naan bread. The gentleman there was more than willing to point it all out to me and recommend options. Service was great. 

I&#39;d go back. 

Only thing, parking lot can be full or tight on space. Don&#39;t park on the 7-eleven side. I heard they tow."

I did end up buying a tool which I think I could use it for pineapples. The owner told me that they use it for getting core out of zucchini and eggplants so that they can put in stuffings. Good to know!

I ordered beef shawarma (still cannot pronounce it correctly) for lunch. It was so good. Pita bread were warm but still crunchy. Rice and beef were seasoned perfectly. Cucumber salad and garlic sauce balanced shawarma nicely. Complementary tea has the color of Chinese Wulong tea but surprisingly tastes sweet. Proportion is big. I tried my best but still had some left. Quite few People came in for lunch during the short period of time while I was there. And you can tell they come in regularly.

I honestly would not have known about Mediterranean Oasis if I had not found it on Yelp. Not only am I from Naperville, but my sister basically used to live across the street from this strip mall so I&#39;ve passed it plenty of times without noticing. This little grocery and carryout is tucked in the corner, but it&#39;s not to be missed!

I was on my way home from a dentist appointment down the street, so I figured I&#39;d try a new spot for lunch. Low and behold, Yelp directed me to Oasis for some carryout mediterranean food. I browsed the store first to see what they had to offer. Conclusion: literally everything you could want Mediterranean related. I can honestly say it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve been in a grocery that carried just that. I&#39;m talking shawarma, beans, rice, falafel, desserts, breads, meats, and things I was unfamiliar with but I&#39;m sure taste pretty great.

I was just searching for a quick lunch to go though, so I head to the counter in back to place my order.  The menu was a little confusing, and although I originally planned to get one of their $6.99 lunch specials that was mentioned on the sign outside, I decided to go with the falafel sandwich instead because well, I love falafel. So much so that I&#39;ll often attempt to make it at home.

It took about 5 minutes to prepare my sandwich and then I was ready to pay up front. The man behind the counter let me know that the minimum charge for a card is $10. My sandwich was only like $5 and change, and of course I only had $4 in my wallet because that&#39;s typical me; only ever having enough cash for just about um... nothing.

While I wasn&#39;t jazzed to spend more money than I anticipated, I was basically being forced to buy something delicious so I really can&#39;t complain. I headed back to the meat counter to browse the offerings. They had so many marinated meats including chicken, steak, kabobs, you name it. I grabbed a package of beautifully cut steak pieces and now can&#39;t wait to cook those up for dinner tomorrow!

Once I finally got home and dove into my falafel sandwich, I couldn&#39;t have been more pleased. What looked like a small sammy wrapped in foil was actually two very large pita pockets full of falafel, veggies, sauce, and pickles. The consistency of the falafel was spot on. Not super mushy, but not crunchy either. Perfect for a sandwich. The rest of the fillings were delish and had a unique flavor I wasn&#39;t used to. I can&#39;t quite pin point what it was, but I&#39;m a fan. I did have to take the pickle spears off the top of the pitas though and eat them separate. Not a big fan of that flavor with my falafel.

Like I&#39;ve already stated, a total hidden gem! If you&#39;re in the area and looking for a reasonably priced and tasty lunch, head to Oasis. Heck, while you&#39;re there do some grocery shopping too. You won&#39;t regret it!"

In fact I lived blocks from the place for many years and never tried it. I walked in when it was relatively new, and the shelves were kinda barren and it looked like a front for a drug spot. But then I have heard friends say they love the food, so last week we tried again.

This time the shelves were not bare. They were fully stocked with lots of interesting items I was intrigued to check-out and buy. Plus the management was actively cleaning and re-stocking. It is a cool little grocery store. And the manager sought me out and offered me a beverage while I waited for my food. The manager was extremely welcoming and helpful in explaining things I had never seen before.

The guy behind the counter who took my food order was not overly friendly, but not rude. Probably tired and hot because it was a warm day and he is cooking back there. But more importantly, the food was very good. It came out quickly. (I think everything is cooked in big batches for the day.) I am not sure all the dishes are of the same ethnicity, but mediterranean in general. I think the stuffed grape leaves are Greek. I assume the shwarma is middle-eastern. I have no idea where baba ganouj is from... and biriyiani almost seems Pakistani. So I didn&#39;t learn a lot about what I was eating, but I can certainly say we enjoyed all of it. My wife and daughter enjoyed the chicken shwarma (playing it safe), and I enjoyed the baba ganouj and lamb biriyiani (bursting with flavor).

They have tables where you could sit and eat, but the ambiance is not appealing. Order-up and take it to go. And the portions are big. The shwarma was 2 meals for the women, and the biriyani (a lot of it is basmati rice but not short on meat) was 3 meals for me."

Am I glad I decided to try this place out for lunch. This place is a nice little market that also happens to have a food station. If you want to stock up on any Mediterranean food items for your kitchen, this is definitely the place to go. Prices are decent too, including the meat at the butcher counter. 
   Onto the cooked food! You just make a right as soon as you enter the store and you will see the food counter. We tried an order of hummus and some chicken and beef/lamb shawarma lunch specials. The specials themselves come with rice and a small side of hummus (which I didn&#39;t know). I believe it also came with some cucumber veggie dish as well. It was a ton of food! Everything tasted great. 
   The chicken, oh man, the chicken-definitely the best thing of this whole experience. I couldn&#39;t tell if it was white meat or dark meat-all I can say is that it was awesome-meat! It was honestly some of the best chicken I&#39;ve ever had. The rice was absolutely delicious as well, and so flavorful. 
    The only thing that didn&#39;t settle with me (or my stomach) was that the hummus had a mega load of olive oil in it. The garlic is strong too, which I loved, but my stomach did not about a day later. Overall, you get a huge portion of very delicious Mediterranean food for a very decent price. I definitely want to come back here soon."

the bad:

he place is a little grubby and dated looking; overstuffed to the gills and with all sorts of things.....like they are tryinng to be 2-3 stores at once.

The conclusion:

A good value for the money. Try the falaffel, the homemade hummus to go, and some garlic sauce. Try the tabouli.   This is not a destination place to eat at. If you want to eat in a store, theres a table and chairs, but for 2 people to enjoy a meal, this is a take-out place."

Guilty as charged. Thank you, Yelp, for turning me on to this wonderful establishment. Great food at a great price with great service. The trifecta of awesome.

I met up with a friend to try out something different. Without Yelp, I never would have known this was here. It&#39;s a food counter inside of a Middle Eastern grocery store within a strip mall.  As in, a hole in the wall you might not normally think of for amazeball food.  But seek and you shall find.

I ordered the chicken kabob lunch platter. For less than $9, I got pita, chicken, rice, hummus, salad (which was more like a relish), babaganoush and tabbouleh.  It was so filling, but I couldn&#39;t stop eating. The babaganoush was garlicly, creamy and amazing.  My chicken was seasoned well and the pita was served warmed.

My partner in crime ordered the lamb schwarma, which was seasoned with something unexpected. Maybe nutmeg? Any way you slice it, it was savory and memorable.

While we were eating, the manager brought out two cups of delicious tea on the house. He also gave us the recipe since we commented that it was so tasty. As we lingered and chatted, he brought out more tea and told us &#34;talk up a storm, I&#39;ll put another pot on.&#34; So we did: we snagged some baklava from the front counter and the manager again brought us plates and silverware so we could enjoy it there as we talked.  We were never rushed out and had a glorious time eating, chatting and enjoying.

My only regret is that we went while it was cold out side. There&#39;s a little outdoor seating area that we would have loved to try if it wasn&#39;t January.

Until we meet again ... because there will be a next time."

As other reviews note the store is found in a tiny strip mall and we passed it even with the GPS navigating our way.  

The menu has it all when it comes to Mediterranean cuisine.  They also offer daily specials such as a WHOLE ORGANIC CHICKEN stuffed with rice for like under $10. Seriously?  Will definitely have to try that out. 

We ordered our food: falafel sandwiches, dolmathes (stuffed grape leaves) and hummus and pita.  We looked around the store as we waited for our freshly prepared food.  I believe the owner offered us an amazing hot tea which was delicious! I cannot wait to try and replicate the recipe the next time we go there.  There is a large selection of mediterranean food/drink and also an aisle dedicated to hookah. The grocery section is impressive you will find things from other countries that are not quite mediterranean. I found some european chocolates and also was able to pick up some ceci flour to make panelle.  

The food did not disappoint. I loved the falafel it was crunch and flavorful. The amount of hummus and pita you are given for the cost cannot be beat and I must say it is amazing hummus.  The owner was sweet enough to add a pastry free of charge. 

Definitely a gem in the western suburbs and luckily only 5 minutes from our house!"

I liked the chicken better but both were good. Had them as combo which came with a generous helping of rice and a small serving of salad and sauce. I thought it was a good amount of food for $6.99. You will definitely be full if you eat the whole thing.
Personally, I wouldn&#39;t eat in. The tables are essentially an aisle in the grocery store. They do have some tables outside that I would eat at if I had to, but the view is the parking lot.
I really wanted to have a five star experience based on the reviews because I drive past this place everyday on my way home from work.
I will go back and try some other items, but I like Naf Naf chicken shawerma much better."

*sigh* I just can&#39;t take me anywhere. 

But I guess I mostly regret coming in here *today* because I live super close by and somehow, despite all the rave reviews for this almost totally hidden Zabiha Halal grocer/deli/restaurant, I never stopped in. REGRETS! It&#39;s never too late, I guess, but I certainly have a lot of baklava scarfing to do to make up for lost time. Ready? Aaand GO! Om nom nom nom...

I don&#39;t exactly know why I avoided this quintessential hidden gem for so long, but because of my presupposed &#39;beef&#39; with a certain pizza place (no, i&#39;m still not over it) also within this kinda super shady looking strip mall, I feel comfortable laying the blame on someone, coughcoughlittleitaliancoughcough, other than myself. Also, let me re-mention how shady this strip mall looks. I think it&#39;s all the kids that hang out by the 7-11 and liquor store. I&#39;m always afraid they&#39;re going to ask me to buy them some Sparks or Mad Dog 20/20 (aka Bum Wine) and then I&#39;m gonna have to waste a large part of my day lecturing them on the why craft beer is king... er, I mean, the reason why minors shouldn&#39;t drink alcohol (because every drop should be saved for the adults who really need it... like me!). 

Anyway, first stop in and I got serviced right up with a felafel plate, spinach pie, and elephantiasis-sized portion of spiced basmati rice. I don&#39;t eat meat, so I couldn&#39;t really speak for the taste of their many lamb dishes or the whole (and super flattened) chicken, but it all looked and smelled like heaven... or Mecca, or whichever happily ever after applies to you. 

My meal was ballz out amazing. I couldn&#39;t even finish all the food I got for myself, but I still wanted to go back and order more before they closed so I could try more things. Now, if that isn&#39;t a testament to good ish, I dunno what is. 

While my fooders got cooked and boxed up I shopped around the deli area and fell positively in lurve with the olive bar that totally had a huge tray of one of my all time favorite foods- BEETS! ... even though the deli guy told me they weren&#39;t beets and that they were radishes (they were so NOT radishes... but I was an Oasis newb, wearing choco nugget covered short-shorts, and in no place to do any arguing... though normally, I will fight for beets). I picked a few items while perusing the aisles, and then my food was ready, but then I picked up a few more items while I walked to the register, and then I picked up a few more while I waited for the guy ahead of me to check out, and then I picked up even more as the super nice young guy was ringing me up and joking with me about how I inadvertently tried to steal chili paste (this is true), and before I knew it, I had 3 bags full of provisions to take back home. 

And I gotta tell ya, 3 bags and I still think I&#39;ll probably head back tomorrow for more goodies... but next time I promise to do a choco-spot check on my b-hole first."

The added benefit is that there is an extensive range of selection on the grocery side including olive oil, frozen goods and cookies.  Really have to see it to understand.

Read through the reviews and decided to go there for lunch yesterday.  It was so worth the little trip there.  The food is absolutely delicious.  We ordered the lamb shank - just like someone else described: super tender and delicious.  We also ordered the beef shawarma and chicken shawarma plates.  Each plate was rested on a bed of saffron rice, and we also received sides of garlic sauce (super delicious), babaganoush, and hummus.  Our boys loved the food as well and the little one said &#34;my stomach is going to burst.&#34;  I took a quick sweep of the grocery aisles.  They are nicely kept and stocked well.  They also offer food - cooked and uncooked - at their deli counter, including organic chickens.  

The store owners were so nice, offering us tea samplers, and they talked with us - checking every so often to see how we are doing.  They genuinely thanked us for coming out.  Great 1st experience for us here.  It was a treat.  I have a feeling we will become regulars at this great tucked-away corner gem of a place."

Love these guys.  When you&#39;re walking around the grocery don&#39;t be surprised if someone hands you a hot cup of tea.  It&#39;s a fantastic blend of Black tea, Indian tea and Sage.  

My sons and I go for the prepared food.  The order-up kitchen in the back or the meat pies in the front.  Try all of it and don&#39;t be afraid to ask the people there what they like to eat (owners, employees or customers).

To cap off every delicious dish you can go to the front and find a good selection of British Kit Kats and the like...  Not sure how they&#39;re different the American version but they are and it&#39;s better.  :)

For me though...  The food could be of lesser quality and I would still go for the owners.  The &#34;Son&#34; who seems to run things is just as kind and friendly as a person can be."

So glad I have a better alternative than the ever popular Naf Naf Grill chain in the area for fast Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food.

Authentic. Fresh. Huge portions.

*In the same store, there were aisles of products I rarely see all together, side by side - hookahs, baklava, fava beans, rose water, whole chickens and goats, etc. 
*Witnessed my entire carry-out order for me and my friends being made to order. I went there hungry so I ended up getting ALL of the following: falafel, hummus, baba ghanouj, lamb shank, lamb kabobs, chicken schwarma, tabbouleh, extra bread, extra garlic sauce, and the entrees all came with sides of rice, salad and hummus. The cook even asked me how I wanted the lamb cooked, a rare occurrence for this type of food. 
*I couldn&#39;t believe how much food I got for a four-person dinner at my apartment. l actually needed assistance with carrying all my bags to the car. And we ended up with a ton of leftovers.

Highlights of our meal:
+Falafel - so fluffy on the inside with a slight crisp on the outside. I have been disappointed by other establishments who make these too dense.
*Baba ghanouj - usually not a fan of eggplant but this slightly tangy, chunky, creamy sauce/dip complemented the other dishes
*Lamb shank - super fork tender and juicy

This is now one of my go-to spots for a quick meal that&#39;s healthy yet hearty."

I first ate here last year after hearing from friends and Yelp reviews that it was definitely worth trying.  I think I have been back about 6 times since.  I&#39;m disappointed that I did not listen to them sooner.  I have only had the shawarma dinners, but they were great.  I have eaten at Naf Naf Grill twice and can say that this place is better, although I wish they had Naf Naf&#39;s hot sauce in addition to the one they have now since I like both.  I think Naf Naf&#39;s hot sauce has an edge on taste but not by a lot.

My only real gripe is that the little salad included with the dinner has bits of green leaves that are hard to eat.  The salad itself is very good but I rarely find myself eating much of it due to these pieces that get stuck in my mouth and fight going down my throat.

They also seem to not be consistent with which sauce is included with the dinners.  Sometimes it is the hummus sauce and other times it is the garlic sauce.  Also, if you ask for sauces over the phone they almost never remember when you pick your order up.  I actually wish I could give them 4.5 since I don&#39;t think the negatives are enough to take away a full star considering how good the food is and how nice the staff are."

Their stuffed chicken really desrves a five star and so the combination of around the World groceries under the same roof.

For obvious reasons, I can&#39;t speak to authenticity, but in comparison to NafNaf or the Halal cart in NYC, the beef/lamb shwarma dinner plate can only muster a 3/5. The meats were slightly overcooked and dry. The bread was cold and again, dry. The basmati rice was easily the highlight of the entree, which is rather disappointing. The hot sauce seems like typical chili sauce, but is a must in my opinion. The dish probably could&#39;ve also benefited by having more vegetables as well. They don&#39;t seem to provide the hot sauce or the white sauce standard, so make sure you ask for those when you order."

This location use to be a family run video store. BOY am I happy this turned into a Mediterranean grocery and carryout restaurant. 

The family is down to earth, humble, and very friendly. You always feel welcome walking in here. Speaking of walking in, soon as you go in, take an immediate right to the small window with a couple guys cooking behind the counter. 

Their menu offers some staple dishes you&#39;d expect, but has a couple items that will surprise you. Like the XXX spicy chicken. This dish is erotic, like a porno is being filmed in your mouth. Cause it&#39;s so damn HOT! Beware if you are sensitive to heat. Their schwarma, falafel, garlic sauce, rice, and half chickens are all really good too. 

If your having troubles finding things like rose water, cardamom, or other hard to find items. Check the ingredients origin. If it&#39;s Turkish, Indian, etc. they&#39;ll likely have it. They also have a butcher where you can get some low-priced meat or mixes that you could use to prepare similar food to whats sold by the Carryout area. Some high impulse up front are worth grabbing too. They stay good for a couple days and are usually all really good.

Don&#39;t forget to grab a drink from their cooler section. You can often find something different that will go well with your meal. Especially if your looking for something to cool down your palate.

I always like for the little, out of the way, independent eatery to be better than the alternative. I can&#39;t say that&#39;s the case here. A lunch special will set you back $6.99 ($7.49 w/ tax) and you&#39;ll get enough chicken and rice to fill the single pita they give you; not enough garlic sauce to match; and about 3-4 tablespoons of med salad. This isn&#39;t a bargain compared to Pita Inn or Naf Naf Grill. I could live with that if I could report that the flavor or quality was commensurate with the discrepancy between what you get for what you pay, but I felt the flavor was less complex (chicken was on the bland side with no char) and the quality not what it is elsewhere (meat was on the dry side with some gristle).

Never, ever did I know that there was a market like this, so close to me! The had some Greek items, which I knew, some of the other items were clueless to me! I bought some authentic hummus and pitas. Also a little plate of assorted Greek pastries, YUMMMMMMM!! To die for stuff! I got a combination plate to try as I&#39;ve only had the Baklava in the past. They have a deli with homemade items and next time I will know what to buy as I didn&#39;t have much time or time to buy refrigerated items. The guys in the store were very nice and helpful.

There&#39;s still a few more items on the menu that I need to try out, such as the stuffed chicken and some of their daily specials.

I chose this place because of your reviews. Bonus that it was close by. So let&#39;s start with the good. Plenty of parking. Easy to get to. Staff friendly as any thing. (FYI.. We were told that off the menu is 911 chicken that&#39;s beyond spicy.) When you pull into lot you see a tiny corner ma&amp; pa type one with a DYI patio sectioned off. There where men chatting away on the patio. When you walk in, it&#39;s a bit grungy but again typical. There are 3 or 4 tables on the side as you walk past to the food window. A patron told us they have a few of the menu items... We ordered chicken. It was so Delish. Way better then Naf Naf. But the pitas are not as fresh. The good window is inside a store. Easy to navigate a wheel chair. Even the tiny tiny patio could fit my chair. The store had many delights. The food prices are reasonable. We left $55.00 poorer, but had to have hummus, salad, pitas and you have to get the sesame bread ring. Yummmm. We are for breakfast. The down side??? We sat outside where 3 men had been eating and chatting. They decided to smoke. I choke and then the store clerk told them they couldn&#39;t smoke. Awesome right? Nope. They said they where with ******* . the clerk attempted to defend the no smoking to no avail. I packed up my food and are in the car. Not happy but will for sure return. The deli has some prepacked hummus etc. We tasted 3 items. When we got home one salad tasted different. No prices or dates on salads."

We live in the area and knew the location, but had never even seen the place in the 5 years it&#39;s been around.  It&#39;s tucked into the corner of a very small strip mall on a non-busy street.  Even if you drive by, you probably would not notice it.

Went for lunch on a Tuesday and walked in around 11:45 - there were literally zero people in the place.  It is a grocery store with a couple of tables along one wall facing the aisle with the chickpeas and olive oil.  The man behind the counter was very helpful, he asked if we were there for lunch and directed us to the kitchen window at the back of the store.  The cook in the kitchen gave us a run-down on the process - we ordered the schwarma and another of the marinated slow cooked chicken dishes with eggplant and some lentil soup.  Everything was fantastic.  Lives up to it&#39;s billing.  The hummus was the best that I&#39;ve ever had.  I like the pita at Naf Naf better as they bake it fresh, but overall, this place is great.  

As we ate, the place filled up with people coming in for lunch - looked to be many who knew the drill and had been here before.  Tip:  They sell the hummus to take home by the carton in the deli case at the back of the store.  We left with some and 4 lbs of  lamb as well. 

I could see how the less adventurous might walk in and walk right back out of this place as it&#39;s not a traditional restaurant.  The place is run by a family - we met the brothers and a cousin who worked the meat counter - they are all very friendly and answered all of our questions.  Will definitely be back... maybe tomorrow."

There, I said it....Anyone dare disagree?  (Let&#39;s Rumble)

 I went to pick up some grub and some groceries based upon the recommendation and ROTD by Pascal M.  I&#39;m so glad I took his advice because the food was great.  
Grabbed some Chicken Shawarma, Chicken Kabob, Falafel, and the BEST HUMMUS IN CHICAGOLAND.  All of the food was seasoned extremely well and I found an awesome mix of nuts in the grocery aisles along with some of my favorite Mediterranean spices. 

The butcher had some gorgeous cuts of meat in the case, but I will have to come back to get some at a later date. 


The hummus was creamy, garlicky, and just plain frickin delicious.  My husband and I had a stare down, when the last spoonful was left, needless to say, I won!!!  He knows, a happy wife = a happy life.

They have a semi-small but wonderful butcher shop in the back with poultry, beef, pork, and most importantly LAMB!

This place was terrific - the food was awesome (and I feel sacrilegious saying I actually liked it better than Naf Naf - of which I&#39;m fairly loyal).

I met with a blogger friend (http://www.kellytheculinarian.com/) to check it out - NEVER would have found it, or actually considered eating there - had it not been for the recommendations and ratings on Yelp.

I had the beef/lamb schwarma lunch plate.  Awesomeness.  And they helped me pick out the right container of fresh baklava to take home (I almost took the sugar-free version! Yikes!).  And the house tea blend was ah-maz-ing.

They have a little outdoor area which is actually fairly charming - I plan to try it in the summer months.

Truly - the only reason why this didn&#39;t get a 5 star was because I was cold in there - since it&#39;s January in Chicago and this is actually sort of a grocery market.  But the tables, silverware, etc were sufficient, the service excellent, and the food was the best Mediterranean I&#39;ve had here stateside."

After working in the same space for almost 10 years, I&#39;m looking forward to finding new lunch spots around here.  It&#39;s a growing pain, however, to now have to determine how much time I have to get from Point A to Point B, and then back to Point A again.

Enter:  Halsted Street Deli.  Within hours of moving into our new space, buzz of the deli next door grew.  Within our first week in the new office, I tried out Halsted Street Deli twice - once with a co-worker, and once my boss took us here for lunch.

The prices are fair.  Sandwiches are $5-6, and coffee and cookies are only $1.  

HSD makes their sandwiches using Boar&#39;s Head deli meat, so I expected better.  The Roast Beef sandwich was OK, but it was piled high with shredded iceberg lettuce which seems customary for most of their sandwiches.  I&#39;ve also had the Buffalo Chicken Wrap, which was good, but missing something - like cheese.  The menu is hit or miss.

I also had a cookie that was as big as my face.  Now THAT was really good.

The employees are nice, and the cashier is especially cheerful.

Overall this isn&#39;t a bad spot if you&#39;ve forgotten your lunch, are low on time, or just need a break away from things.  For a more satisfying lunch, I&#39;m more willing to spend a few dollars more at Schmaltz Deli on Naper."

My boyfriend and I came here for our Valentine&#39;s day dinner, and our server was very nice and attentive. The drink selection is very good, including a long list of wines!

Due to this situation, we decided to never give the restaurant any more of our cash. The problem was that we lived only a few blocks away and their food was actually pretty good. So after a few months we found ourselves stopping in again as a convenience.

La Dolce Vita&#39;s kitchen was always very accommodating. Their chefs could actually make any dish with little or no garlic on request. Yes, as amazing as it might seem to those of you who love garlic, a dish can actually be made without the use of toxic plants and still be well presented, appealing and flavorful. 

We recently stopped in on a busy Friday night at about 9PM.  The hostess, who was obviously overwhelmed, scribbled our name down on a pad of paper. I say scribbled because her pad had no ordered list of customers. She was literally scribbling names on the pad, apparently thinking she would remember the order.

My wife took the only seat available at the bar and I stood. We got a couple of drinks after waiting 15 minutes for a bartender and then an additional half hour before checking with the hostess. &#34;You&#39;re three down on the list&#34; she said. After about 25 minutes more I checked back. Now responding with a more vacant, &#34;I don&#39;t want to be here&#34; look, she said &#34;ah, you&#39;re fifth in line&#34;. Right. &#34;How is it that possible when 25 minutes ago I was third in line?&#34;  She said &#34;I had to seat other people&#34; and walked away.

I&#39;d now been standing at the bar for an hour and 10 minutes and we&#39;d had only one drink. La Dolce Vita is a relatively small restaurant with seating for about 45 people and room at the bar for maybe 15 more. There were two bartenders and yet no one had the time to ask if we needed another drink. The hostess never checked on us or updated her progress.

When I went to check on the reservation, my wife opted to go to the washroom. Prior to that we noticed a couple who&#39;d come in about ten minutes before standing behind us. As I walked back to the bar, the couple that had been sitting next to my wife got up and the other couple grabbed the two chairs. It was obvious to anyone in the immediate area that I&#39;d been waiting for a chair and that we hadn&#39;t left. Any reasonably mannered person would have asked my permission first. Needless to say, they rudely pushed their way in.  Not wanting to be a prick, I let it go. THAT was a mistake.

When my wife got back, she saw the new couple at the bar. I think her reaction was &#34;what the hell is this?!&#34;  Then she asked about the table.

After working a full week at a tough job, you don&#39;t keep my wife waiting, without food and one martini on her stomach for more than an hour. She tends to get verbal. A cute, demure, normally soft spoken blonde that turns into a WWF fighter when denied food by vacuous, slow-motion moron posing as a food service professional.

My wife made it abundantly clear that she was not at all happy with the situation. The people around us took notice. The bartender finally came over to see what the problem was. She explained that we were now over an hour and twenty minutes wait time. That the halfwit hostess had completely forgotten about us. That there were now several empty tables on the other side of the bar wall. That we were offered no drinks. That entitled, suburbanite AH&#39;s had taken the seats we&#39;d been waiting on.

The bartender said that the hostess had a history of bad service. That she was in fact an idiot and that she &#34;does this all the time&#34;. He apologized and said that he&#39;d get us a table right away. He offered to buy us a free drink.

In full support of my wife and realizing that I&#39;d neglected to take up the mantle of the infuriated consumer, I said &#34;no, I appreciate the offer but we&#39;re out of here&#34;.  I said that we&#39;d been regulars for most of the past two years and that we&#39;d never be back. I said that they&#39;d completely ignored us and that they should honestly get rid of the idiot at the door - &#34;she&#39;s ruining your business.&#34; He apologized again and comped our first round. Not wanting any favors, I left $10 on the bar anyway.

On our way out the idiot said, &#34;I have your table for you.&#34; We both said, &#34;forget it - too little too late - you majorly screwed up&#34; and walked out. Believe it or not she actually walked out after us yelling that she hadn&#39;t done anything and that we were the ones in the wrong. We simultaneously told her what we thought of her as she yelled back at us &#34;F-U... DON&#39;T COME BACK&#34;.

In one sense she was right, she did NOTHING. La Dolce Vita has hard working, talented chefs, unbelievably lousy management and an idiot at the door. My suggestion is to buy a monkey and give him a note pad. He&#39;d keep the customers amused and would certainly be an improvement over your current hostess."

The restaurant is cozy. It is too dark inside the restaurant, which makes it difficult to read the menu sometimes. Also, it can get very loud at times. 
Everytime we go we get the bruschetta, it is really good, but would be amazing with a balsamic reduction drizzle! When we were there on Saturday, 2 pieces of bread in the brushetta were black! I think just an oversight because they were very busy. 
Also, I think the waitresses should carry straws in wrappers with them in their apron. I waited for 10 minutes for her to get me a straw (I have sensitive teeth and cannot drink ice water without a straw) and when she finally brought it, she was just holding it in her bare hards... kinda gross. 
This is a nice find in a small downtown. A must go to if you&#39;re in Lemont."

Out to dinner with the family!

The restaurant itself is pretty small and tight, the kitchen is also really tiny! It is well decorated and the ambiance was nice. 

We ordered the polenta and lobster arancini appetizers. The polenta was huge and in my opinion just okay, but my parents love it. I particularly enjoyed the lobster arancini balls, pretty small portion and high price but they exceeded expectations. My mother got a soup, I don&#39;t remember which one, minestrone maybe, and said it was just fair.

They give the entire table a large bowl of house salad because most of the entrees come with one. I really liked this approach to serving salad, and the salad itself was also pretty tasty. 

For our entrees my brother had the cavatelli vodka which were very tasty, cooked to pillow-y perfection with a nice creamy vodka sauce. My parents split a chicken dish that was on special which was in like a basil wine sauce which they said was pretty good. My dinner was the veal piccata (or picante, maybe?) which I thought was also pretty good. The sauce was a really tangy wine sauce that had some bite to it, but was really soupy, still not half bad!

The service was very slow. My family does like to take our time ordering and eating, but this was even slow by our standards. We sat down around 6:30 and did not leave until about 8:30. I was getting very impatient and concluded that the place is pretty understaffed in terms of servers and maybe even cooks. Our waitress was nice and pretty accommodating but was really busy and almost overwhelmed with other tables. She did bring everything we needed, although we had to ask for more bread about 3 times before receiving it.

In summary, the food was pretty good for a suburban Italian restaurant. The location was also really good and the price/quality was definitely there or really close. Nobody left hungry and nobody thought anything was bad. I just think the service could be faster and potentially more attentive. 

We had a fun time and the food was good, overall experience was a 3/5."

Danni is our server and she was great &amp; very helpful. We ordered an Italian Chardonnay to start as the rest of our party arrived. We ordered stuffed mushrooms &amp; calamari apps which were tasty.

We ordered the Tortellini stuffed w veal &amp; proscuittto, Linguini w clams in red sauce, Veal Parm, stuffed Eggplant, Chicken Vesuvio, Chick Portobello, and Chick Griglia and everyone was happy and we took our leftovers home. The salad was good &amp; chilled and the bread was nice w a little salt was on the crust. They ran out of the cream of asparagus soup which I was eyeballing so I can&#39;t say anything on that. We had 2 more bottles of Chianti w dinner and it just topped off a great meal. Joe the owner came around and I expressed how happy we were and he is a nice man. The tortellini came in a nice cream sauce, the grilled veg that came w the chick Griglia were sweet. Oh, and the Pink Passion Martini was delish I am told."

It was very quaint and small. Small in that the Maximum occupancy sign says 65 people. The tables feel incredibly close and it can get very loud in here. If you are looking for a quiet, romantic dinner, this is definitely not the place.

The food, however, is something that would bring me back. Every meal comes with the house salad and meats come with a pasta side. I, personally, was not a fan of the house salad because of the dressing. I thought it was too vinegarry but my boyfriend loved it. The meals were absolutely phenomenal! I went with the chicken Parmesan. It was two huge breasts of lightly breaded chicken in a light bed of tomato sauce. They were perfectly moist and delicious. 

On the side, I got mostacolli with their vodka sauce.The vodka sauce was absolutely phenomenal.

The service was a little bit slow; however, they were fairly busy on a Saturday night.

At times, my wife and I thought things were being seasoned for the senior crowd.  I ordered the special of spinach and scallops.  The spinach, unfortunately, was the star of the dish.  The sauce was tasteless and pasta not quite al dente.    The scallops were small and overcooked.  Frankly, this was just not worth the $25 price tag.  

My wife ordered the risotto bolognese.  Simply, it just wasn&#39;t very good.  The rice was undercooked and the dish was clumpy.  The sauce was overly sweet and salty -- I assume to mask the &#34;blah-ness&#34; of the mushrooms.  It was very disappointing; however that being said, I have no doubt that the server would have tried to correct it if we had voiced our displeasure.  

The wine was outstanding for the price (2012 Primitivo Tormaresca) and if we ever go back, we will definitely order the mussels in red sauce again. They tasted very fresh; however, there were two that weren&#39;t opened all the way.

We may go back. The menu has some interesting dishes listed, but we won&#39;t hurry back to drop $100 on a dinner that was simply &#34;meh, not worth it.&#34;"

Great bread and I must say I like when a restaurant says they&#39;ve run out of a special- in this case one of the soups- you do get house salad served family style with entrees. My Vesuvio was yummy but missing peas. My friends filet was De-lish and cut like butter. Portions good but not disgustingly large.

We both enjoyed our food. The salad had a really good flavor to it and we both enjoyed our entrees. I had ravioli and she had cavatelli al forno. I felt the portions that were given to us were a good size, but it was still a little bit more in price than I would expect to pay, which is why I deducted one star. The martinis are excellent but are $11. It would be nice if they had days with drink specials (perhaps feature one of their martinis at a lower price). I also deducted another star because not all of the pastas are made in house, which is just a personal preference of mine. The pasta that was featured in the special was made in house, so my recommendation would be to try the specials of the day. The service is slower, which I did not mind because my friend and I enjoyed good conversation. However, it was quite noisy in there so we had to speak really loud to hear each other. I have also heard the sausage is good. I will probably return to try other things and update my review accordingly."

Located in downtown Lemont, across the street from the legendary Tom&#39;s Place Bar, this cross between fine and casual dining offers a wide assortment of traditional Italian Cuisine. Since I hadn&#39;t had it in a while, I jumped at the chance to enjoy one of my favorites, Chicken Vesuvio while my friend had Orange Roughy. Both dishes were done to perfection although the Vesuvio lacked the serving of green peas...oh well. Now the bad parts: the server did not know the menu well, I alway order a beer on tap and the first beer (Peroni) was flat. So second was a Sam Adams and it was just ok., my guest said the wine selection was just pedestrian (&#34;I can buy this wine $9 a bottle at Osco&#34;) and finally...no substitutions! What? You mean I can&#39;t substitute Broccoli for that lousy pasta, even if I pay extra for the veg? So, we ordered the broccoli as a side and was served the pasta (to go) even though the server knew we were throwing it away. What a waste! So, because the service was lousy: 3 stars. The food and ambience were excellent but these folks need to review their customer friendliness. By the way, the Vesuvio gravy possessed a richness I hunger for.

We have never been here before but I have driven by and the place looked inviting. I called to make reservations but they don&#39;t take them for a party of two. Thats fine with me since I don&#39;t mind waiting at the bar and having a beer or two before dinner. So we did just that, left our name with the hostess, grabbed a seat at the bar and had a beer and martini. This is the only reason I gave four instead of five stars, no craft beer?! A Craft beer brewery shares a parking lot with this place! Although Debbie the bartender did inform me that they will be carrying their beers very soon so I will have to go back. Debbie was wonderful!! She told us all about the restaurant and the specials and just made us feel so welcome.

For me atmosphere and people are more important than the food. This place had all three though. When you walk in the place is beautiful and romantic and rustic. Perfect place for a date night. The bar is very inviting, they have highboy tables and regular tables although not a lot of them. The place was pretty crowded, lively fun crowded not standing room only crowded. We had about a half hour wait which was fine because Debbie was entertaining us quite well at the bar. I actually wanted to eat at the bar but my date wanted a table. 

Got to our table and it was just perfect. Love the stone walls and the beautiful wood work. We already knew what we wanted to order, we shared the beef medallions that were on special that night. Delicious!! Plenty of food for us to share too. 

The place is a bit loud inside, lots of people having a good time talking. If you are looking for a great night and a great meal you have to head to La Dolce Vita. Everyone was super nice.

I walked in and I literally felt like I was in an old mob movie about to ask a favor of the Godfather.  I mean this in the best way possible.

I had a fever, and the only cure was eggplant.  I&#39;d been eating myself heavy and meat silly that week so it was only thing that made sense to me without all the carbs.  You get a side salad and a little thing of pasta with your meal.  I had the eggplant parmigiana and it was LITERALLY the best eggplant parm I&#39;ve ever had.  I can&#39;t really put  my finger on whether or not it was the eggplant that made it so good or the amazing marinara sauce.  My husband had this wonder seafood pasta.  The name escapes me but it had calamari, clams, muscles, shrimp, and scallops in it.  So very very good.

We were about to close out our bill and a waitress walked past us with their HOMEMADE tira misu (which by the way you can smell the coffee in it from across the room).

The food though is beyond comparison. The Capatelli (sp?) with Vodka Sauce is the only thing I order as it is the best Vodka sauce dish I have ever had. My fiance has tried many of their other offerings and has been equally impressed.

The wait staff is great, but we would highly recommend sitting at the bar every now and then. The head bartender (I think) is extremely nice and her jokes are hilarious."

Our wives drank water while we drank coctails at the bar. Apparently drinking water at the bar with us was not good enough. Our liquor tab was just around 65 dollars. After two hours, the very rude owner, I believe his name is Joe, asked us to leave because our wives (pregnant) were drinking water. We have never been treated so rudely. Apparently when business is good, the ownership does not care how they treat people. Anyone who is family minded needs to avoid this place. Bahumbug on the day after Christmas. Non mi piace!"

Joe runs the place and was a pleasure to talk to. He is very passionate about the restaurant and very, very proud of his chef. He told me the eggplant would be the best I ever had and he was right (not boastful). 

This place has the look and feel of a neighborhood restaurant (which it is) from any decade. The number of regulars is a testament to how good this place is.

I was party of a dinner party and while  everyone enjoyed the food, we had some real issues that night. The waitress was very good. The prices were reasonable.
 I can&#39;t recommend this place if you want to make reservations of 12-20. I think this place likes to do service a certain way and it&#39;s been effective for them but there was some real professionalism lacking from management the night we dined.

The food was good, service OK. It was crowded and noisy - the table was tiny. A VERY small place. We got an appetizer, drinks and dessert - my bill was $86 and I left a $16 tip, so my total for two people was $102. We lingered awhile - probably was 2 hours since we arrived - when a man came up to us and asked if we would be considerate to people waiting. It was obvious he was asking us to leave! I thought it was very rude. I&#39;ve never been to a restaurant where they asked you to leave - no one I know has been, either. So, I won&#39;t be back.

The food, staff and ambiance are excellent.  We would have gone there even more often if they had accepted reservations.  In order to avoid a long wait, we would arrive before 5PM which made for pretty early dinners.   

So the good news is that they now take reservations.  The bad news is that there was no way to know that fairly critical piece of information!  They managed to put a big sign out front that says &#34;Now Open Sundays&#34;.  Maybe they could have also mentioned  &#34;Now Accept Reservations for Parties of 4 or More&#34;!  Another suggestion would be to man the door with an experienced staff member to deal with any fallout from those loyal customers who were not aware of the new policy.

Instead, when we arrived Saturday night at 4:45PM we were asked, as usual, if our whole party was there.  We said no, but we would let her know when the other two people arrived.  When they arrived a few minutes later, we promptly told her we were ready to be seated at any of the then available empty tables.  She said she would come get us in the bar shortly.  After seeing many other people seated ahead of us, we went back and asked when we would be seated?  She asked, &#34;Do you have a reservation&#34;?  We said &#34;No, we only have 4 in our party and you only take reservations for 6 or more people&#34;.  She THEN chose to let us know that they now take reservations for 4 but she would see what she could do.  After having been there for over 90 minutes, we went back to her again.  This time a man, who we were told by the staff is the new owner, told us if we didn&#39;t have a reservation we would would have to wait.  By this point, the bar was full of people ahead of us who had been given pagers when they arrived after us.

As we prepared to pay our sizable bar bill and walk out, the bar staff apologized profusely and said this same thing had happened several time in prior weeks.  They tried to comp our drinks, but we didn&#39;t feel it was their responsibility to make things right.  They insisted we leave our name and number which we did, but no one has contacted us.

We are so disappointed and feel a little betrayed.  This was a really fun, local place for years.  To be treated so poorly by the owner really stinks.  I had to give only 1 star in this rating even though the staff is awesome and I have no reason to believe the food isn&#39;t as good as ever. 

We will miss &#39;pork chop Wednesdays&#39; and the other excellent food, but poor customer service trumps everything else."

My boyfriend took me here during the first few months of dating and we&#39;ve continued to go back. We most recently shared our anniversary here. His father&#39;s employer frequents the place and his son actually ran into us there and bought us glasses of wine during one of our first times there. I love the people who work here as well as its intimacy and decor. If you plan on getting there past 6pm on Thursday-Saturday, expect a long, long wait. We&#39;ve waited up to 2 hours to dine here (but that is also because we drove 40 minutes to get there). I get mostly the same things, the Capellini del Angelina is my go-to and of course I tried to get the owner to change it to Cappellini del Tessa. No luck. So many things on the menu stand out to me. My counterpart is always satisfied and normally tends to jump around the menu with his choices.

A free salad comes to the table which is a great starter. One of the biggest disappointments about this establishment is that they took one of their BEST items off the menu and that would be their stuffed mushrooms. I had dreams that I was nestled tightly inside of one, and then they go and take them away?! How could someone let this happen!?

Definitely check this place out. Like I said, we take a little drive for this place and it is always worth it."

Being in downtown Lemont its also a little bit of an older crowd in here. That being said the food was really good and reasonably priced. The fried calamari appetizer was right on, and had Cavatelli with Marina and a side of meatballs and they were both very good. The marinara tasted home made, and not like canned tomato sauce. I would recommend trying this place out, but make a reservation, or plan on waiting a while if you go on a Saturday."

Food was great, probably some of the best fried calamari I&#39;ve had anywhere and their caprese salad was terrific made with heirloom tomatoes.  We haven&#39;t had their pork chop special yet, but their other chop and pasta offerings are exceptional.

Starting the evening at the bar while waiting for a table is always a good experience as well.  Having a great wine/martini selection, this place will keep you entertained in the event your wait for a table is going to take a while.  If you&#39;re in the presence of good company, believe me, you won&#39;t mind a bit.

I&#39;d definitely recommend making a special trip out to Lemont just to try La Dolce Vita.  When you&#39;re finished with your meal, take a stroll around the area, too.  Character just oozes from the pores of the limestone buildings and neighborhood establishments that surround it."

The baked goat cheese appetizer is a great bet.  If there is a fish special noted on the chalkboard, ask for it because the chef can do no wrong when the pesce is fresh.  I would especially recommend the skate and monkfish specials.  The osso buco and marsala chicken dishes are also great.

The reason I didn&#39;t mark La Dolce Vita higher is two-fold.  First, the incredible din in the restaurant makes it almost impossible to hear anyone at your table when this place is busy.  Because of its small size (no more than 15 tables), a bar bustling with tipsy customers competing with the sounds emanating from several TVs, an open kitchen and tin ceiling, the sounds are literally thrown back at you from every corner of the restaurant.   Second, the wait for an open table tends to be quite long and customers are not provided adequate space.  Almost every time we have come here  we have had to wait between 15-60 minutes while scooting out of the way of other customers trying to squeeze in and out of the restaurant."

We decided to head over early as we knew that they get slammed and the wait could take a long time.  As Robert mentioned, it&#39;s a small spot so going early would be advised, unless you&#39;re willing to sit at the bar for awhile.

Big positives now that the non-smoking laws are in effect.  Although they provided non-smoking sections before, it&#39;s such a small space that it never really worked and you ended up sniffing smoke no matter where you sat.

My dad called ahead and ordered a full Chicken Vesuvio for appetizer.  Even the waitresses were amazed at the idea of having it for an appetizer, but for 4 people it was fantastic.  If you ordered it once you sat down, it could take 40 minutes for them to make it, so maybe while you&#39;re waiting for your table, if you think if it, order some up in advance, you won&#39;t be sorry.

MK and I both had the Ravioli.  They are large and very well-filled and we both had the meat sauce which was good.  MK also ordered a side of Italian sausage.  It was very tasty as well.

My mom ordered the Eggplant Parmesan which she said was &#34;great&#34; and my dad actually ordered the Cheese Ravioli&#39;s as well.

Mon-Fri: 1/2 priced select appetizers from 4-7
Tuesday: $1 burgers (there&#39;s two bartenders always working this day and they are sooo nice and welcoming! Sit at the bar if you can!)
Wednesday: $1.25 Miller Lights and Bud Lights $2 312s. Also 1/2 priced martinis. 
Thursday: 1/2 priced martinis all day! (They&#39;re usually 10 bucks) Also reverse happy hour appetizer specials from 10-close. 

I really like this place because they put more thought into their drinks. It&#39;s not just a jack and coke bar. Sooo many to choose from!"

For the Upstairs Lounge area, for Saturday 18th June 2016--- we got a call from a manager Hector telling us that our reservation wasn&#39;t going to work because the previous party before us was going to keep the upstairs and that we were going to have to move -- Even though we made the reservation 2 weeks prior &amp; on there schedule there were no other reservations for that day, according to Bryan Davis - Acting General Manager -- now last minute we had over 20 people coming and we have to cancel or move to a dif part of the bar -- 

Definitely a Party Foul. 

Update:

Bar Louie was able to accommodate us after all, last minute they made some changes and were able to do good on our reservation, for are bad luck my wife&#39;s purse was stolen from the upstairs patio at the end of the night, I wish the bar would have cameras at least 1 - but no luck."

Cucumber martinis and S&#39;mores martinis are on point.  Get them both.  Have no shame.  Your wallet won&#39;t mind.

Bar Louie was our 3rd stop during a Promenade bar crawl.  The crowd is definitely younger at night; I&#39;d guess the average age was 21-24.  There was a DJ who was spinning (is it still &#39;spinning&#39; if it&#39;s on a laptop?) did a good job mixing up older stuff with newer and less mainstream stuff.  

Service was great - this bar was definitely the most crowded the night before Christmas Eve - but our waiter (Jason) didn&#39;t forget about us.  He delivered my martinis with speed.  The bartenders I&#39;m not so sure about - although that cucumber martini tastes like heaven, the 2nd one was definitely a short pour.  But for $5 I can&#39;t complain.

As the night went on, the bar got crowded.  There was a fight, which had a sea of people flow outside, and then the Bolingbrook PD showed up.  Ehh...it really killed the good buzz I had going.  The night would have been more enjoyable if these asshat bros were immediately escorted out, but it took awhile, and that seemed to only cause additional fights.  Maybe I&#39;m just getting old, but it made me nervous, and we couldn&#39;t get the check fast enough at that point.  I&#39;m too old for this shit.

So, to sum it up:  good music (if you don&#39;t mind EDM or hip hop), young crowd, solid $5 martinis.  If you&#39;re over the age of 30, leave by 9, maybe 10.  Giving it 4 stars for the $5 martinis and quick service."

Honestly, I feel like their menu is just so lackluster. We started with the hummus appetizer and the tzaztiki sauce was the best part. I got the BBQ burger and my friend got the Louie. We both commented the meat was sort of gross. Not sure what type of beef they use. Loaded tots as the side were delicious but they were the only part of the meal I enjoyed."

Sometimes misfortune turns into something good though, as was our experience here. We really enjoyed our dinner at BL. My wife and I had the California Chicken Club with tots on the side, a la Napoleon Dynamite style. Tasty sandwich...save the tots.  Prices are very steep for what you get but that&#39;s the moral of the story in Bolingbrook Promenade.

1) Beer menu lists many &#34;Seasonal&#34; and &#34;Rotating&#34; taps.  No list is provided showing which ones are available.  No worries, I&#39;ll ask the server, he&#39;ll know.  Well, maybe.  He batted about .500 on what ones he knew and didn&#39;t.  If you&#39;re not going to provide an actual list of the beers you have available, make sure your servers know what is and isn&#39;t available.

2) Knowledge of the food.  One of the specials, featured prominently in the menu, was &#34;Grilled Macaroni and Cheese Sandwich&#34;, which was served either with Verde Chicken or Pulled Pork.  I asked the server was &#34;Verde Chicken&#34; meant, and his answer was &#34;It&#39;s just how it&#39;s prepared.  It&#39;s chicken.&#34;  Great insight, thanks.

3) Quality of beer.  I ordered a Sam Adams Octoberfest (one of the seasonals he knew they had) and alas, the line clearly had an infection.  The beer wasn&#39;t *horribly* infected, but if I were a brewer of that beer it would break my heart if that&#39;s how people thought it was supposed to taste.

4) Quality of food.  Lukewarm tater tots.  Lukewarm sandwich.  Apparently, &#34;Verde Chicken&#34; means &#34;a tiny dollop of salsa verde on one section of the sandwich.&#34;  Very meh.

5) Accuracy of order.  My dining companion&#39;s &#34;Buffalo Ranch Chicken Flatbread&#34; had BBQ sauce on it.  Huh.

6) Overall experience.  Our server was terribly unengaged, unknowledgeable, and inattentive.

Overall, meh.  This was my first visit to a Bar Louie to eat, and I won&#39;t make that mistake again."

Now it was 95 out and my Peach Lightning was one big ice cube for 10 bucks. So it sat dry for 15 minutes until he finished watching the tube on the other side of the restaurant. We watched him as ours was his only table. When he brought our food his eyebrows raised seeing our empty glasses. WTF did you expect? And how old are you that BL hired a server that didn&#39;t read the job description. My almost 15 dollar mac and cheese was ridiculous. The over cooked croutons&#34; I mean fried chicken chunks were like I bit into sawdust. Dried out and flavorless. It came with a wedge of garlic bread. It was just painted yellow because that had no taste as well. I could have been drunk by the time my food came and this would have been an entirely different review. Everything would have tasted like vodka and there wouldn&#39;t have been a problem. But this has always been an issue with the Lou. I would have Meetup&#39;s at the Orland location and we would have to the bar and get our own drinks. Really, this is not a bad place.

The place was maybe 1/3 full.  After 45 minutes no food. 

It looked like the waitress forgot us and the order. 

We called a manager over who blamed some electrical outage but no one came over to explain. And people who were seated after us received their food. 

The waitress was the best at avoiding eye contact. 

The manager offered us something the next time we came in but nothing specific was detailed nor did we receive anything in writing, like a coupon.

Their security staff are some of the most disrespectful, unprofessional people that I have ever encountered. They&#39;re bad people and acted completely improper when removing a group of people from the bar. Pushing, yelling, and antagonizing a fight from the group is now how a bar employee should represent their establishment. Also, their bar staff is beyond slow. I waited for at least 30 minutes for a beer and had the bar tender walk by and ignore me 3 times. Their food is mediocre at best. One of their managers was a decent guy but that&#39;s the only nice thing I have to say about Bar Louie. I&#39;m never going again and I would recommend others stay away if possible.

Met a couple girl friends there for appetizers. Oh it&#39;s Wednesday and Martinis are $5!!! So more anticipation! Ordered a cucumber, a dirty and the pineapple (Diva?). All I can say is, the bar tender must be new at this, my cucumber was way syrupy sweet. The dirty was all olive juice. Pineapple too sweet! Btw, no liquor in them at all, no wonder $5. We ordered flat bread, that was pretty good, calamari was horrible- all chew. And chips with three dip- just meh. I don&#39;t know what to say.

I&#39;m not much for the wannabe club scene at night but when I&#39;m looking for a delicious bar-style lunch or dinner this is definitely the place I&#39;m dreaming of.  The food is all amazing, I appreciate that everything on the menu doesn&#39;t taste exactly like the next thing like some restaurants.  

They have a good beer selection as well as a huge liquor selection.  The waitstaff isn&#39;t always super attentive but the food and drinks tend to make up for that...as long as they keep them full.

Some foodstuffs I recommend:
Chicken Nachos, boneless wings, or Pretzels for starters,  BBQ Chicken Salad, Mac and Cheese, Luigi sandwhich + cheddar (*drool*), California Chicken Club, Any of the burgers (Come on Tuesday night burger night!)  

I also like to have a cider with a shot of caramel vodka on top.  Some people like to add fireball...for a cinnamon apple

Oh--on weekend evenings they have a dress code--so watch out for that gentlemen.  This is bolingbrook, after all."

The BF and I came just before football season ended and I could not tear his attention from the TV. In that aspect he enjoyed Bar Louie, Bolingbrook. I enjoyed our server, who I think also could have cared less about sports and was really helpful and friendly. She also did a really nice job with keeping our glasses full and our table clean. 

The food was a major let down though. I knew it would be bar food but I was expecting it to be a little better. I had ordered the buffalo shrimp and it was just so oily that the BF and I felt like we needed a shower after eating it. We had been planning on going to the zoo that afternoon but since our stomachs felt so heavy and we felt so weighed down, we ended up just heading right back home for a nap. I&#39;d also been here one time during the Summer and ate on their patio (which overlooks the mainly empty portion of the parking lot- very scenic) and gotten their Greek salad, I wanna say it&#39;s called the Santorini, which has about 2 pounds of olives, so you get your money&#39;s worth there (though you sodium levels will rise two notches) but you also get your salad drowned in dressing. If you go with a salad, be sure to get your dressing on the side."

I saw a lot of double dates and girls nights out here. Now, I go to the Bar Louie in Naperville which got kids that just got their 21 year old licenses ready to party type of scene on the weekends, so this place was a bit of fresh air for me. It&#39;s bigger.

Around 10:30 they tried making it into a club scene by dimming the lights and having disco lights go off. No one was dancing or even seemed to notice. 

We got delicious buffalo boneless wings and a buffalo chicken flatbread (that was ok, nothing special). We sat ourselves in the dining room next to a patio and it was freezing! Not a good place to sit because that&#39;s where the smokers were walking in and out. 

Service was okay. Our waitress was busy. It seemed like she was unfairly responsibly for many tables so she didn&#39;t make her rounds as much as I would have liked. 

This area is in a good spot. I could see myself shopping around here before stepping into Bar Louie for appetizers and dinner. I&#39;ll come back on a day like that, when the weather is toasty."

Went here with a large group of people last weekend and we just hung out at the bar the entire night, ordered some apps up at the bar and just hung out. I almost wish I would have just eaten at home because their food is nothing better than &#34;bar&#34; food and over priced for what it was.

Our bartender seemed to know pretty much what she was doing, but can you say &#34;overpour&#34;? This is how bars loose money. And while it was Friday and I didn&#39;t have to work in the morning nor drive that night, a few cocktails are fine, but she just put so much vodka in one my drinks that it truly was undrinkable. Luckily, one of the guys finished it up for me, as to not waste alcohol. I would have preferred a replacement beverage, but he was happy to do me the favor.

If my fiance&#39;s friends from work want to go here again for drinks, we may have to take a pass, but hopefully, they all have the good sense to know it was a BIG waste of their&#39;s and my hard-earned money."

I guess we will have to start sitting somewhere else. The drinks are a bit over priced but the food is ridiculous. It&#39;s way too much for a bit of food that you wait twenty minutes for. I also think that there should be a more thorough training on drink making because half the time I pay ten dollars for a Margarita that is badly made. I hate having to send it back but cmon. Also the bathrooms are grossly kept. The only reason I keep coming is because I&#39;m close and it&#39;s open late. Please make proper improvements.

Although they do not have virgin drinks on the menu, she made me a virgin margarita :) it was very good and I was grateful for the thought. I had the Louie burger which was amazing, cooked to perfection. I hate it when my burgers are under or over cooked. My fries were originally not that fresh and she noticed I wasn&#39;t eating them and asked if they  were ok, I was honest and said they were not as fresh as I would like, she didn&#39;t hesitate to run to the kitchen and request fresh fries for me :) My fiance is a cocktail enthusiast and Is always afraid to order a cocktail that is not on the menu but he put her to the test and she delivered.

I&#39;ve been to the one in Naperville which seems snobbier. I&#39;ve also been to the one in Wrigleyville and it was much more run down dirtier - but that&#39;s to be expected so close to a ballpark full of partiers I guess.

Sadly the Orland location has closed BUT I am kind of glad I have to say. I gave them more than a few chances and I always had BAD service there. :( Too bad.

Luckily we now have the nice new one in Bolingbrook at the outdoor mall. :)
This is a really nice one and a pretty good size. The food is always good and perfect portion sizes. Thursdays they have great drinks specials and 1/2 price appetizers. Oh Tuesday from 5 to close is $2.00 burger night! Also $4.00 Margarita&#39;s. Yummo. I also love that they have big booths with high backs on them so they are a little more private. :)

Come Thursday through Saturday nights they jam good tunes and have a disco ball rolling so they def are pulling in the business. I don&#39;t see this location going anywhere for a long time. The staff has been pretty nice which is also a good thing. 

They do serve breakfast/brunch but I am not 100% sure if it is daily or just on the weekend.

My girlfriend and I went out to Bolingbrook to get a few things from ikea.  Afterwards we were looking for something to eat.  We thought, you can never go wrong with Bar Louie.  Well think again!  

The waitress we had on Saturday the 23rd was absolutely horrible.  Completely rude, inattentive, and down right bitchy. 

My girlfriend and I stayed for all of about 15 minutes (mind you in this time we were waiting for the waitress to take our drink orders) and after the second interaction with her, we decided to go somewhere else. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.

We did however go around the corner to Ted&#39;s Montana Grill and I had the best burger in my life!

I guess I&#39;ll need to make my way down there to check out all the shopping. It&#39;s like a mini-town inside of a town.  So the location was great.

I got there around 8:30 pm. It was already bumpin music and full of people.  So we were idiots and decided to sit down even though it says &#39;please wait to be seated&#39;. So it took them awhile to notice we were there.  But even once they noticed, they were not very good at stopping by our table to check in on us.  I was there till midnight and they probably stopped by the table 5-6 times throughout the night.  Since we were drinking most of the time, I was not happy about that.

We notified the server that we were going out for a quick smoke.  When we got back to our table there were other people&#39;s dirty drink cups plus our drink cups sitting there.  The server would come to get our order but then leave our old cups there. Ahem...

So basically we would sit at a dirty table most of the night. Besides the service, the food was pretty good. I got a chicken avocado sandwich.  The music was pretty loud all night and got more loud around 11:00.  But people were dancing so it seemed that was a good idea.  I guess this is a better bar than restaurant.

There was a little confusion about what to do when we walked in. This doesn&#39;t seem to be a seat yourself kind of place but there was no host at the door. Eventually someone showed up and we were seated.

The server was nice, but we sure did wait. After waiting about 10 minutes he showed up to take our drink orders, which took entirely too long to make. We were deciding what drinks to order and asked him about the menu, and the poor kid looked at us like he was staring at a brick wall. 

We ended up getting a few appetizers, which were pretty pricey. The chicken nachos were awesome, but the serving was huge. The appetizers came up pretty quick but everything else took forever. Normally I would blame this on a Saturday evening, but it wasn&#39;t very busy. It&#39;s like this place can&#39;t decide if it is a bar or a restaurant and only doing a half ass job at both. Had an ok time, but not worth the price."

I have sampled almost everything on the menu with the exception of the pizza (though the Italian Stallion sounds awesome). I&#39;ve never had a bad meal and the service is excellent. I love the taco platter though they seem a little skimpy. I mean for $11.99 I was expecting a little more than four little tiny tortillas. If you&#39;re really hungry (like I am most of the time) probably go with the burrito instead. My only regret is I usually go during business hours and I can&#39;t partake in liquid libations. Sigh. 

I do have one complaint. For such a nice patio area, why are there not any umbrellas? I&#39;m Irish (i.e. pale) and the thought of sitting and baking in the sun is not a fun idea. I want to enjoy the fresh air but I&#39;m not ready to turn into a giant freckle."

Not a huge BBQ fan but this salad was amazing! I was just along for the ride when my friend chose the salad we would share.  After the first bite I wanted to reach across and devour the whole salad!

It&#39;s all the way in the back of the Promenade - at first I thought I was going the wrong way - but it&#39;s back there and there is plenty of parking.

Three of us sat at a high top table at the bar. The service was prompt to begin with but tapered off some later in the evening. We were there a while celebrating an accomplishment and as the night wore on we saw the server less and less, but we were never completely out of drinks so it really wasn&#39;t too big a problem. She was very accommodating about providing separate checks when I asked when first seated.

We all split the 1/2 priced happy hour chips and dips. The chips were fine, though the guac was already turning brown and the cheese dip was a little skimpy compared to the quantity on the other dips. The server did bring us more chips when we ran out at no charge, which was nice. I had the special $2 burger, and added cheddar, grilled onions and mayo for an extra $1.25. Really, an extra $0.25 for mayo? I thought that was a little ridiculous, but I really wanted mayo. The burger was cooked well and was tasty, the bun was fresh and a good texture, so really can&#39;t complain. The server gave me the choice between fries and tots - and the tots were fantastic. Perfectly cooked and salted, really the best part of my experience.

My biggest criticism would be the bartender - I was served a mixed drink that was poorly mixed, but my server came to the rescue by pouring it into a larger glass and adding more mixer, and it was perfect. We ordered a shot that required sugar and the bartender skipped that step. So those were a couple of issues we had but overall we had a fun night, the food was decent, and our server addressed our issues and made it right."

That in itself deserves five stars, it like finding a diamond in a pile of dog turds. 

We came here on a Thursday night.  The place wasn&#39;t packed, but it was reasonably comfortable.  Very low lighting, with a large square bar in the center of the room.  There were tables and these really cozy round booths along the back walls.  We chose one of these, and it made for a nice place to sit and have a private conversation.  As said before our server was fantastic, and no sooner did we sit down, were we asked about drinks.  I had a really good green tea and blackberry martini.  

The food was surprisingly good as well.  I had the fish tacos with mango salsa.  Couldn&#39;t complain at all.  My husband had the enchiladas, which were good but very spicy.  (It wouldn&#39;t have bothered me, but the menu description did not include that tidbit of info).  We also split the nachos and dip.  It was mediocre.  The salsa was very thin, and the cheese sauce rather unremarkable.  But I could have eaten a plate of the guacamole by itself!

I will be back the next time the craving for fish tacos hits."

Grabbed a seat at the bar and after several minutes of watching FIVE girls who work there in a huddle 10 feet from me - someone came over and asked what I would like.  Trying to ask for a different side choice in the middle of ordering... the bartender spent her time talking to who I assume was the manager.  After being ignored for a few minutes again I finally caught the bartender and asked if I could sub something on my plate.  Her reply was that it was too late and that the cooks in back would be unhappy about the request.  Really?  I picked my phone said to forget it and left.  It gets better...

The bartender followed me outside to ask me twice if I would like to pay for the fountain pop which I hadn&#39;t had even a sip out of.  I set 4 dollars on a table and told her to keep it.  She picked up the money and dropped it into the window of my car as I was leaving.  

Blame the manager for not allowing her bartender to do her job or say it&#39;s crazy for anyone in a restaurant to ask someone to pay for a .25 fountain drink when they leave because of crappy service.  Either way I wouldn&#39;t go back if the food was free.  True story."

   I cannot express the gratitude I have for the service we received last night.  I called friday afternoon to ask staff if they sold bottle of wine and champaign and explained i wanted to buy a few for the occasion that night. The staff at Bolingbrook went above and beyond to please us.  Last night I arrived around 9pm to celebrate my dear friends (trevor and holly) fresh engagement.  Trever whom i consider one of my best friend had asked for hollys hand just a few hours before arriving at bar louie. I ask our waitress Bianca for 3 bottles of champaign so we could toast for when the couple arrived. Bianca informed me that they had just sold out of Champain.  After expressing alittle disappointment she went and talked to her manager Brian Davis.  Brian and Bianca sprung into action and came back to me and said that David was running out to buy us a few bottles at a local liquor store.  On a Friday night when they were packed to almost capacity this showed me how much the staff cares about the clients.  The bottles arrived quickly before the couple walked into the bar and the toast went off without a hitch.  For the remainder of the night our beautiful and sweet waitress Bianca provided attentive service for our party of 20+ till the end of the evening when the bar was closing. David and Bianca helped with making a memorable night for all of us. I truely believe these two employees showed us some of the best customer service I&#39;ve ever received. I know myself and friends will definitely be celebrating future events at this location."

I thought it was really nice of her to do that!  Anyhow, we were there because we were celebrating something, and we stayed for a bit after we were done eating - no one made us feel like we had to leave since we were done eating.

WHAT??  No reservations on a Friday night and we got THE table??  This usually means nothing good about a restaurant but I&#39;m guessing it was just dumb luck because this place was wonderful.  

My husband had some sort of pasta seafood thing that he enjoyed and I had the Charcuterie appetizer for my meal.  DELICIOUS and a good value.

Service was friendly but a tad slow.  Really though...the patio is exceptionally pleasant.  It was good to slow down.  I look forward to returning and maybe adding a star."

The food was awesome! Our server was super sweet and helpful as well. We had a 6:45 reservation and the place was just starting to get busy when we got there. The service was really consistently good throughout the meal. We were always checked on, and food came out in a reasonable time from ordering. But, it wasn&#39;t overbearing, where I felt rushed or anything. 
So, we started with the Calamari and carpaccio (there were more Italian names for them on the menu, but I forget). They were great. Move on to our meals. My husband ordered one of the daily specials with lobster and other seafood... I tried some because... it looked yummy. It was. I sort of regretted ordering the gnocchi ...though mine was quite delicious as well. They were both really good, I guess is the moral of the story. You can&#39;t really go wrong it seems like, whatever you order will be good. My husband had the limoncello martini, said it was good. I wouldn&#39;t know, I don&#39;t drink vodka or other clear liquors as they make me ill (i&#39;m strange). 
The other two at the table actually ordered the same things that me and my husband did, so I can&#39;t say if maybe something else might not be the greatest in the world, but it seemed like everything we did try was great. 
I am looking forward to coming back here. It was a good time. 
Also, I believe they had tiramisu when we came, as my brother in law got a little mini one for his birthday (it was cute)... but we didn&#39;t order deserts otherwise as we were just too full and wanted to go out afterwards... 
I don&#39;t know, it seemed pretty Italian to me, though I can&#39;t really judge that, as I have never been to Italy... Whatever it was, it was tasty and I am REALLY looking forward to going back."

In short:
-haughty service
-overpriced wine
-thick, soft, overcooked spagetti
-pomodoro sauce itself was delicious!
-sausage rigatoni sauce was too sweet, but otherwise the dish itself isn&#39;t bad
-there werent ANY ITALIAN DESSERTS when we went! No tiramisu, no cannoli - so we went for the &#34;berry bowl&#34; which was just a few berries, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, in a pretentious chocolate bowl which is just difficult to eat and a physical and culinary mess.

No- tempura fried calamari with asparagus, sun dried tomato, shrimp stuff, and who knows what else. It is incredibly good and you&#39;ve never had anything like it.
If you come here for dinner (or appetizers....or, just wine) order this. Even if you don&#39;t eat calamari, just order this and give it to someone who does eat calamari.

We had one of the the MOST amazing meals I&#39;ve ever had. The textures and dishes made me nostalgic for my time living in Sorrento, Italy, yet the flavors were so inventive and some dishes were different than anything I&#39;ve tasted...in the best way possible.

The fresh pasta was impeccable. The cheese antipasti, I can&#39;t even begin to explain the deliciousness, the freshness...

We tried: Carpaccio di Kobe Piccante, Crabcake dei Cesari, Panna Cotta di Bufala, Datteri e Polpettina al Cocco, and Camembert al Forno. They were all delicious, but our favorites were the carpaccio, the panna cotta, and the datteri. We also had some incredible pasta dishes as part of our tasting menu. For dessert: Millefoglie alla crema Catalana con Pesche and Tiramisu.

A 6:30 reservation got us seated in the main dining area as soon as we walked in the door out of the rain.  Our server was pleasant but rather business-like as we ordered our drinks, and my request for a Negroni on the rocks was a slight curve ball as they usually serve them up, martini style.  The drink showed up without the desired lemon peel, but was delicious nonetheless as the sweet vermouth was house made, we were told.

Our apps arrived, Straccetti for my wife and mussels in pecorino broth with bomba bread for me.  Oh, those mussels were sweet, and the broth so heavenly that I would have brought home what was left to have on my Cheerios in the morning.  The Straccetti (flat bread) was good as well, but the garbanzo bean dip that was brought out with the table bread was better.

The room had really filled up by that time, and it was rather hard to hear our server describe the specials, particularly with the server at the next table trying to be heard at the same time.  We decided on the mushroom risotto and the fish special, a misto of scallop, shrimp and tilapia with roasted broccoli.  Both dishes were excellent, my only complaint with the misto being the six shrimp, which tasted okay but looked like 16/20 size.  I would have rather had 4 larger shrimp which might have been more flavorful.

As a digestif, I had to order a taste of the house-made limoncello and my-oh-my was it molto buono.

It was cool to see the creations going on in the open kitchen, and the wood burning oven in the back was mesmerizing to watch.  Guys, be sure to check out the poster of Sophia Loren in the men&#39;s room...her quote on the wall says it all.

All in all, a pleasant experience and we are so glad that Gaetano&#39;s has brought  their level of cooking to Batavia.  I&#39;d even go out on a limb here and say that Gaetano&#39;s is doing regional Italian as well as Turf Room is doing American Eclectic, and that&#39;s saying a mouthful."

We did not advertise it but it was a special occasion for us. Our reservation was for 6 pm on a Saturday. When we got there, they promptly tried to seat is on the basement. 6 pm?! Are you kidding?? Sure the basement was decorated nicely but it is still a basement. And our reservation was EARLY. We asked to be moved upstairs. After a little wait we got lucky enough to get a table above ground. 

So we are ready to order some appetizers. Our waiter tells us we must order our appetizers and entrees at the same time.  We were prepared to order our appetizers (calamari  -excellent and a plate of prosciutto and capers  very good) but not ready to order our entrees. Feeling a little rushed we ordered

My husband ordered the fish(Mahi Mahi ) entree that had bruschetta tomatoes. He hate tomatoes. So while I might love that, he was not enthused   My pasta with lobster and shrimp was good but not sure it was worth the price. Had we not been rushed we might have perused the menu and selected other choices. Our fault for letting the waiter rush us but bad waiter for making is feeling guilty about wanting to order appetizers first. 

So overall it was just okay. Did learn that you can bring you own bottle of wine. Corkage fee of $18 is pricey but good to know. Might enjoy appetizers only next time.  Wanted to really love it but it did not deliver for the price charged"

She was very nice, personable, and knowledgeable about the menu... But we waited too long between ordering courses, asking for the check, paying, etc. 

The food here is simply fantastic. Calamari, mussels, pasta... Everything was so fresh, balanced, delicious. We will definitely be back."

It is pricey, but I felt it was worth it, which is key. These days that seems few and far between. The pasta was fresh and cooked perfectly, the beef short rib had more flavor than I think I&#39;ve ever had. Bread was homemade and delicious. The best food I&#39;ve had so far in downtown Batavia, we had the flourless cake for desert it was excellent. It&#39;s one of those places you find yourself rudely staring at every dish that&#39;s coming to your fellow diners tables, We will be going back, without question. Try it, I think you will agree the food reflects a management and staff that take pride in the product."

Hubby and I went there on a weeknight for our anniversary and we were able to get a 6:30 reservation easily, but I guess weekends are tough. We were seated immediately and had to wait longer than we should have to be greeted by our server, considering the place was not at all full (yet!) That is really my only criticism regarding service. 

The homemade bread on the table with a dip was very nice. We opened with a baked Camembert appetizer. Delish and enough to share. I had the fettuccini with chicken and shrimp with a tomato-cream sauce and hubby had the veal scallopini with potatoes and spinach. Both were very good, portion were large, I took some home. The KILLER was the peaches and creme dessert. OMG it was sooo good! Hubby had one glass of wine, we split aa appetizer and a dessert and the bill was $83 before tip. So, a bit on the pricey side, but it was a good value, which is all I really care about. Charge me anything, but make sure it&#39;s a good value compared to other fine dining options. I will go back, just to make sure I work my way through that homemade dessert menu!!!"

Service at Gaetanos is very good. We&#39;ve been twice, several months apart, and our server not only remembered us, but remembered details of our first meal there.

Fish here is outstanding. We&#39;ve had cioppino, skate wing, and salmon. All excellent, flavorful, and interestingly prepared. They use sauces that are very good, prepare vegetables well, and understand portion size. We had a tartare of steak and tuna for an appetizer on our last visit. Both were remarkable.

This is an intimate restaurant, great for a date. They have an extensive wine list that is reasonably priced. If you&#39;re into cocktails, the bartenders know what they&#39;re doing, and we find that to be rare.

Overall, Gaetanos is a sure thing, not to be missed."

It was so bad we were this close to leaving  while waiting for someone to take our drink order. But it was Saturday night and we knew we&#39;d have a hard time getting in anywhere else and figured we&#39;d stick it out. We were seated in the basement, I didn&#39;t even know they had a basement and was thoroughly disappointed since the upstairs is so cute. The basement was dated and squished...

We had the beet salad with goat cheese, which was incredible, my husband had the fresh noodles with the bison and wild boar which was really rustic and lovely. I had the cream pasta with rigatoni and the black truffles. A. Mazing!!!!! Definitely a repeat !!!

This is definitely a pricer place than most dinners we would go to. But for a special night, I think this is the ticket.

We recently moved to Geneva from near restaurant row in Chicago and we&#39;re excited to see something supposedly on par with restaurants downtown. 

First, all the tables around us were given bread promptly. We waited around 20 minutes.  Our server was not inattentive but she was not attentive either. The server for the tables behind us seemed to be more concerned with his tables. 

We ordered the bacon wrapped dates and seasonal octopus appetizers to start. The dates were lukewarm, at best.  They would have been much better if they didn&#39;t taste like they&#39;d been sitting out for fifteen minutes. The octopus was ok.  Not spectacular. But it was the appropriate temperature. We had a salad and that was decent. 

For our main courses, we had the mixed seafood of the day and the pappardelle.  My husband&#39;s pappardelle was extremely salty and the sauce didn&#39;t fit well.  And as he pointed out, he can have homemade pasta in the city that is as good for 5-10 dollars cheaper. My seafood went from cold to burning hot when everything should have been warm.  My broccoli was charred on one side and cold and undercooked on the other. 

When it was time to order dessert, neither of us wanted to even attempt to continue to be disappointed.  We were more excited to come home and eat gelato from the store. 
 
We sat outside and it was fun to people watch. However, it was extremely crowded where you couldn&#39;t get in and out of your seat without pardoning yourself and apologizing to the person behind you.  

The bussing staff was great.  They made sure our waters were full and our utensils replaced.  And the bathroom sinks are really cool.  

Dress was all over the place-people in cut off shorts and people dressed up. Strange combination. 

Overall, I see the potential for this to be great but we were disappointed. We might try again on the chance this was an off night and maybe we ordered poorly."

Before going, I learned that there are several Gaetano&#39;s and they all got a pretty decent review. Love the pasta and chicken dishes. My wife liked the veal. We both liked the warm rolls. The highlight was the limoncello after-dinner drinks - so good! I researched limoncello and decided to make my own, which was time-consuming and fun.

You usually have to make reservations well in advance and it&#39;s a little pricey, but well worth it. The service was attentive. Much better than the other Italian place in town with marginal food and awful service.

I clicked on $$$ ($31-$60) below, but with a cocktail or a couple glasses of wine, it can cost more than that. The total for 4 of us recently was about $250 plus tip.

Can be casual or dressy. I prefer the latter."

We came on a Thursday night and sat on the beautifully decorated patio. There is live music on Thursdays and there was an acoustic guitarist who was FANTASTIC. We got a chance to talk to him and his name is Ron Steta. I asked if he played there every Thursday as he was so great and all the guests loved him, but no - this was only his first time!! 

He played classic songs with a beautifully elegant Italian vibe that was honestly such a perfect match to the restaurant ambiance. It was truly a treat to listen to that all throughout our dining experience. It made us little suburbanites feel as if we were almost actually in Italy....yes, that good. We would love to see him there as often as possible - he made such a great addition to our whole experience. 

Now, onto the food. Abbie took care of us. She was friendly, knowledgable, extremely helpful and we ended up ordering the &#34;Gaetapas.&#34; This three-course-meal entailed the chef&#39;s choices of 8 appetizers, an entree, and dessert for $50 per person (on special on Thursdays). We thought we&#39;d have some fun and try something new. Such a great decision! Now I don&#39;t know if the chef&#39;s choices differ every time you order the Gaetapas but we loved everything we were served. 

From starting with the deliciously fresh homemade bread and gorgonzola bean dip...to the woodburned scallops with chocolate sauce (so good)... to the decadent gnocchi pasta with mushrooms...to the final dessert platter (and everything in between). 
We loved it.

The chef&#39;s wife (assumedly) came out and introduced the first round of appetizer tasters, detailing all aspects and ingredients. We were very impressed with the presentation all around. 

If you&#39;re wondering which $13 martini is more worth it, its the limoncello, hands down. 

I hope every guest gets to have as great of a first experience here as we did, and we can&#39;t wait to come back."

Unfortunately, I will never have it again. I went to Gaetano&#39;s a few months ago with my family and I was shocked. We had reservations and were seated in a timely manner, but the table was far from spacious. They crammed as many seats and tables as they can into the dining space, When we eventually got greeted by our server, several minutes after sitting and watching other patrons squeeze through the narrow spaces between tables (we clearly weren&#39;t the only ones that didn&#39;t appreciate being squished), we ordered drinks. They were fine. After a while longer, bread appeared, which also was good. Thankfully, because it was the only food we&#39;d see for well over an hour. It took so long that we considered paying for our drinks and going to McDonalds. When our food appeared, we were so turned off by the lack of service we ate as quickly as possible to just get out. The worst offence was the management, after bringing attention to the situation we were infantilized and made to believe it was our errors or somehow fault that the service was just terrible. This is an unacceptable and unprofessional way to treat paying customers. My suggestion, don&#39;t go, there are so many better options. Geneva has amazing new restaurants that I would rather frequent. Also, manners. I suggest more manners for management and maybe lose a table or two to give everyone some space."

Had scallops--cooked perfectly--and limoncello so wonderful it made all past limoncellos I&#39;ve had taste like powdered Wyler&#39;s and bad vodka. I will say reviews on dishes are always helpful to diners and for the chef, but by far, the variety offered and the staff are very helpful to steer your selections. 
For me, good food always trumps any negative atmosphere, within reason, or at least minimizes it, and when you consider the suburban location and the outstanding ability of the chef, it is stunning he has chosen Batavia. I seriously wish Gaetano&#39;s  success, as I appreciate having this caliber of restaurant so close. 

Garbanzo purée appetizer, unique and flavorful...risotto, absolutely perfect...tiramisu rivals any in the nation!! Panna cotta, sublime. 

And the bufalo mozzarella, which is somehow whipped???--divine!!
Absolutely try this place and save the hour drive to/from Chicago."

You won&#39;t find red pepper flakes or dehydrated &#34;cheese&#34; to sprinkle on your food.  There is no &#34;red sauce&#34; on boxed pasta.

I went on opening night and I was so excited about the flavors.  Scallops with a chocolate sauce, beef chorizo stuffed dates, shrimp and gargonzola, stuffed tempura zucchini blossoms..

If that doesn&#39;t entice you, I don&#39;t know what will.

Our server was new, and a bit inexperienced but they had excellent support from the River Forest staff helping out to train. First their opening night, I would say it was nearly flawless.

I would love to check out the River Forest location some time but this one is just too convenient for me.  Welcome to Batavia, you are DELICIOUS!"

When it first opened you couldn&#39;t get a table - reservations were booked up solid, and at first it lived up to the hype.    

I decided to give it another go last night.  Our other usual go to was closed and after seeing some solid recent reviews we said let&#39;s go for it.   We had reservations last night - Thursday, at 7 pm - the restaurant was pretty empty, there were some people, but considering how packed it used to be, it was a bit sad.  I ordered a slightly dirty martini - was perfection.  We started with the cocoa dusted scallops - still one of my favorites - a must try!   I ordered the lobster and shrimp pasta - it was top notch...would order it again in a heartbeat.   My husband had veal scallopini which was a little lemony for him, but that he is sensitive to it.   I thought it was great.  I asked for a wine recommendation and the waiter came out with a glass of wine not on the menu, (sadly) didn&#39;t take note of the name - but it was really really good.   We ordered desert - I wanted the tiramisu, my husband wanted something else - the waiter brought my husband what he wanted and gave me a tasting portion of the tiramisu - which was OUT OF THIS WORLD - even my husband liked it - and he usually doesn&#39;t care for tiramisu, 

My recommendation is, if you stopped going because Gaetano&#39;s went down hill....go back, give it another try....you should not be disappointed."

Upon seating we were treated with a sliced onion focaccia bread complemented with a garbanzo bean and olive oil dip. Our order started with tempura battered, cheese filled, squash blossoms served with Drago red pepper sauce. While the blossoms were excellently prepared we were disappointed the order was only three flowers. A serving of four would be appropriate and allow diners to equally share. The main dishes were delicious. My wife had the gnocchi with pheasant, pork, and wild boar ragu. My course was pasta with house-made sausage and mushrooms in a cream sauce. Dessert was custard and peaches layered between caramelized phyllo dough; a perfect summer treat.

I am a mussel fanatic and I&#39;ve had them all over the world, including France and Belgium. These are the best, bar none. Big portion in a great creamy peppery garlic broth. These babies are huge, tender and sweet. The salmon carpaccio style with mushrooms and arugula was also memorable. 

Wife had crab cakes and seafood medley. She&#39;s not much of a shellfish fan, but pronounced it excellent. Ingredients, preparation, presentation, portions and service all top shelf.

We had the Kobe beef carpaccio and the baked Camembert for starters.  The carpaccio was great, the cheese, just good.  Main courses were specials.  I had a wild boar pappardelle, which was fantastic.  My wife had a lobster tail pasta dish that she said was excellent.  We shared a mousse-based dessert which, while rather sweet, was well done.  Our wines, which were available by the glass, were quite enjoyable.  The house-made Limoncello was tasty, but also very sweet for my tastes, but I&#39;m no Limoncello expert, by any means. 

Where I felt let down was with regard to the atmosphere.  The cheap pine tables are much too small to accommodate a shared dish, like the carpaccio, wine glasses, water glasses, It was akin to eating Thanksgiving meal on a tray table.  I would estimate the size of these tables for 2 to be 30&#34;x30&#34;.  Also, the tables are crowded very close together.  I could very easily hear the conversations on either side of our table, to the point where they were hard to tune out.  Things got a little better when the restaurant completely filled and there was more noise. It didn&#39;t turn out to be the romantic anniversary dinner spot that I&#39;d hoped for.

Finally, given the suburban location and cramped and loud tables,  The prices were too high. Unfortunately, despite a great meal, we won&#39;t be back unless we could sit on the patio that another reviewer mentioned."

Do you know Italian food?
Have you ever been to Gaetano&#39;s in Batavia?

Gaetano&#39;s has changed my life and given me a new founded appreciation for Italian Cuisine. 

Before coming to Gaetano&#39;s, Italian food was always last on my list, now it&#39;s my first choice for restaurant dining. Everything from the special filtered water to one of a kind bathroom has been thought through. Your first impression leaves a lasting impression.

What I like most about Gaetano&#39;s is that the food speaks for itself.Everything is made in house from the salad dressings to the soup.&#34;If we don&#39;t make it, we don&#39;t serve it&#34; is the motto here.

Illinois being a land locked state can be challenging to have a great seafood experience. Gaetano&#39;s does not disappoint. There is a perfect array of seasoning and spices that bring these Italian dishes together and tell a story. Everything is made in house from the salad dressings to the soup.

Very rarely will I have an appetizer and dessert in the same sitting, Gaetano&#39;s is the exception.

I look forward to embrace the shrimp and lemon dishes that send me into a state of euphoria and open the room up to good conversation, complement with great wine.

You can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu and last night we had the Calamari ripieni al Porto Rosa. This dish set the stage for me to indulge myself on a further Scaloppine al limone journey, and then finished things up with a lemon curd dessert.

I guarantee you will love your experience at Gaetano&#39;s and will leave wanting more with a open mind and appreciation for food.

Geatano&#39;s is the Platinum Standard in Italian Cuisine and I challenge you to take the plunge and try something new at Gaetano&#39;s in Batavia."

We made a reservation at 8, didn&#39;t get seated till about 8:20. It took me and my girlfriend at least 15 minutes to get bread and water, service was very slow and un attentive. My wine glass sat empty for our whole dinner and never offered another.
Food was very good but very very over priced. I wouldn&#39;t have minded paying so much if the service was better and more attentive. 
What I thought was going to be a very much needed nice evening out for my girlfriend turned out to be a long wait crammed in between other guest, getting bumped around every time someone needed to get up and no wine to calm my frustrated nerves. 
Over all it was good food at ok portions, that&#39;s about it. will not be back."

We live in Batavia IL and were very happy to see Gaetano open a Chicago-quality restaurant in the restaurant wasteland that is Batavia.  We went to their grand opening weekend earlier this year and the food was excellent, with great ambiance.

However, after tonight&#39;s experience we will not return.  I&#39;ve eaten great food in great restaurants from coast to coast, however, if I am dropping $100+ for meals, I want to feel welcome.  No one has to kiss my feet, but we must have sat in the shlub section tonight.  

The server seemed inexperienced and her visits to the table were infrequent.  The restaurant was nearly empty since it was about 5 pm so few tables were occupied.

[REVIEW EDITED TO REMOVE REFERENCE TO OWNER&#39;S WIFE WHO WAS NOT THE HOSTESS, BUT A SERVER AT THE TIME (NOT OUR SERVER.)  HOWEVER, I STAND BY MY COMMENT ABOUT SERVICE THAT LEFT A LOT TO BE DESIRED.  FOR THE PRICEPOINT OF THIS RESTAURANT, THE SERVICE WAS 3 ON A SCALE OF 1-10.]  

Again, the food was excellent.  I had tilapia with an avocado cream sauce that was to die for.  Hubby&#39;s spinach gnocchi was great.  But the lackluster service and the lack of warmth soured the entire experience.  This restaurant was our #1 choice for special occasions but never again.  And to think I once considered this restaurant one of the 5 best I&#39;ve been to in the United States."

Ordered from the menu for the first time, didn&#39;t do the chef tasting with wine pairing.  I ordered the wrong entree!  I got the fish of the day which the waitress said is delicious. It was far from. It was served with burned, not brown or grilled, but burned black broccoli.  And the fish was in a pool of butter and oil.  The shrimp was shriveled and overlooked and I couldn&#39;t get past the butter and oil soaked taste on all the fish. Ew. 

Other than that, the dates and zucchini blossom appetizers were good.  Also love the pistachio cream drink for dessert. 

Since this has been my only terrible food there I will be back, but I will never order that again. Butter oil soaked fish is not my idea of good food and then to let it out of the kitchen with visibly burned broccoli just isn&#39;t the quality that I&#39;m used to from this place."

I don&#39;t often get too excited about restaurants, and typically rate places by whether or not I could make that myself at home. 

This place was simply amazing. I honestly couldn&#39;t believe a gem this good was right here in my town, and not some posh spot in Chicago. The food was out of this world. We ordered the Gaetapa&#39;s chef tasting, trying 9 courses followed by an out of this world dessert offering. 

The dishes were some of the most amazing tasting things I&#39;ve ever eaten, and the combination of fresh ingredients and things you would think would never go together like chocolate and seared scallops were just amazing surprises.

Our waiter, was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive and we carried on a conversation throughout the night. Simply a great night, and amazing place. Pricey but so worth every penny.

We left happy, comfortably full and talking about how good it was."

We were seated promptly at our reservation time. This was an improvement from our first visit where we&#39;d given the benefit of the doubt being the first week open. 

We decided to do the Gaetapas tasting as we did on the first visit.  I was pleased to have of the same dishes and some different ones. 

Standouts were the (my description here, not menu&#39;s) chocolate crusted scallops (unusual combination of flavors but tasty), the calamari stuffed with asparagus in the most incredible sauce, and the crab cakes with Caesar salad topping.  

Again the dessert tray was amazing. I was happy to see the tiramisu again as it was incredible.  It gets a run for its money from the semifreddo.  

I go back in about five weeks with my girls supper club for a tasting menu again - can&#39;t wait!"

The rustic atmosphere, heavily accented wait staff, and charming decor make this a must try in St. Charles. We tried the Monday night special, which is a pasta sampler, and it was one of the feat assortment of culinary expertise and experimentation I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure of sampling. This was a 6 course meal, stating not with the garlic humus, cracked black pepper and olive oil, paired with a fresh unleavened onion bread. Next came the buffalo mozzarella, fresh tomatoes, and prosciutto, pizza for one. The authentic Italian oven gives the crust just the chat it needs and add smokey notes to the pizza. 3 pastas came in a relaxed paced succession, starting with the cut rigatoni, chicken and shrimp over cream sauce. Next was a delightful braised short rib, mushroom, and butternut squash gnocchi. Then came the thick spaghetti over the red sauce(gravy) made from the owners mother recipe, and he even provides her number in Italy to complain! It&#39;s important to note all the pasta is made fresh on premises. Finally this amazing dinner is finished with 4 deserts at once. There was a lemon merengue spoon, comprised of cooked heavy whipping cream, sugar, and raw lemon bits. Then was a tiramisu served in a quaint tiny terra cots pot. The phyllo dough, orange cream, served with whipped cream and peach was super tasty and layered with texture. Last but not least was a bread pudding with chocolate sauce.

We had a bottle of white wine recommended by our waiter to compliment our dinner and it was perfect. What a wonderful evening, but don&#39;t forget to take a stroll on the river just outside of the restaurant!"

He doesn&#39;t cook a meal. He commits to it. Creates it and takes incredible pride in it. His focus to try and make food an experience for you. I&#39;ve gone to the Forest Park restaurant for years, and I&#39;ve fallen for the Batavia location. Summer should be amazing.

Anyway, we went there for a 50th birthday for six. Michael was our waiter, and he was impeccable. Try the butternut squash gnocchi, the zucchini blossoms or calamari...or the stuffed figs. Everything is incredible. While we chose Chef&#39;s Choice, Gaetano took care of my father when he saw his face following the presentation of a dish. Gaetano asked if he could get him something else, and my Dad said no. Ten minutes later, Gaetano served him an incredible spicy chorizo sausage dish - with the sausage made from scratch. THAT is why chorizo can be in an Italian restaurant.

Gaetano and his team what to make your dining an experience. Let them try. Just sit back and relax. (Bring your big pants to handle all that you&#39;ll eat.)"

I cannot. It is tied for the best with the original Gaetanos location in Forest Park. This is the best Italian food you will ever have. (Check out the name, I eat a lot of Italian). The interior of this location is kitschy comfortable.  Tables are bit tight, but that&#39;s what comes with the small footprint of the room.  Ate here twice in the last month. Once, on the main floor which was a bit louder, but had the windows, whereas the basement was very quiet, but no view. I urge first timers to order the tasting menu. You will never look at Italian food the same way. These last two visits, our table of four ordered a sampling of appetizers, among them,  &#34;Carpaccio di barbabietole&#34; (Yellow and red beets roasted in the wood-burning oven, sliced carpaccio style and drizzled with champagne vinaigrette, paired with mache greens, topped with fried goat cheese) and  &#34;Datteri e polpettina al cocco&#34; (Dates stuffed with beef and chorizo wrapped in pancetta and baked, served with coconut-tomato sauce accented with cumin, coriander and jalapeno). Among our entrees, we shared: Costine di manzo alla Milanese, ( Beef short ribs braised Milanese style, served over saffron risotto and dusted with gremolata) and Gnocchi di ricotta al Gorgonzola (Home made ricotta gnocchi tossed with toasted pine nuts, imported Gorgonzola and a splash of cream) (We also had a gnocchi with guinea hen that was extremely memorable). 
If this place was on Randolph street in the city, there would be a two week wait for a reservation. Request Dave, (both locations have a Dave) and both are waiters extraordinaire."

On to the food... our table ordered dates for an apitizer and they were excellent.  The main courses were ok but a bit over complicated &#34;fusion style&#34;.  To my taste northern Italian is not generally complicated but &#34;simple hearty&#34; dishes.  The presentation was excellent but the taste was just average.  I have had much bettrr Itailian at chain reaturants the bill for the table was about 200 including a modest bottle of wine.

Made a reservation 2 weeks in advance for Friday at 7 pm. arrived at 6:55 and table was not ready, hostess very apologetic stating that prior group was not leaving. At 7:15 we went inside and noticed that there were several empty tables and asked if we could have one of those, hostess explained that they were reserved for 7:30 parties and that they  have a computer system that assigns each party a particular table and there is no deviating from that despite the fact that there were 4 empty tables for approx. 30 minutes between 7-7:30 pm.

Finally we get seated at 7:20 and owner comes to table immediately and apologizes for delay - we&#39;re looking forward to an enjoyable dining experience and assume the owner (who is waiting tables) will be our server. 15 minutes go by and not one person comes to our table and owner is no where to be seen. Fed up, we leave and our way past the back of bldg. my husband sees the owner &amp; chef outside smoking and points that out to me. Conversation ensues as to why we&#39;re leaving and owner explanation is that &#34;your table wasn&#39;t my table&#34;.  Wow -  as the owner I&#39;d  think she&#39;d be concerned about the service at ALL the tables and not just her tables. 

In conclusion, disappointed that we looked forward to dining here and did  not got to try it and won&#39;t be returning."

The short story: Chef Gaetano sincerely respects the philosophy of traditional Italian cooking. He uses quality ingredients (mostly organic) and doesn&#39;t overdo a good thing. Flavor combinations are simple but layered in character and boast an amazing amount of depth. Don&#39;t miss their signature tiramisu (served in a flower pot with a bloom on top), Kobe beef carpaccio (di Kobe piccante), beet salad (carpaccio di barbabietole), or tempura calamari (calamari al porto rosa)!

(+) Ambiance is traditional Italian complete with wall murals that are reminiscent of an Italian night. Outdoor seating is beautiful. The restaurant is small, longer than it is wide, evocative of more urban digs. There&#39;s also a downstairs area that they have not yet begun using for seating. The kitchen is open and clean, taking up almost half of the upper restaurant. This restaurant lacks a lot of the pretension found in similar price ranges and caliber of menus in nearby restaurants... a major plus. 

(++) Food. Ugh. We went in for the soft open and decided it would be an injustice not to do the chef&#39;s tasting menu ($75/head) with wine pairings ($34/head) . I have not a single complaint about the food. I only wish I had a bigger stomach. Gaetano&#39;s wife (Wendy) served us and was extremely welcoming, asking for wine preferences (&#34;White or red?&#34; To which we cheered, &#34;Both!&#34;) and food allergies (My unfortunate companion is dairy-free). Gaetano even brought over a special dairy-full risotto for me. Grin. Each dish was one glorious, gluttonous bite after another and I have no idea how the family doesn&#39;t weigh a collective ton. It was like a comatose dream: 

carpaccio beets roasted in the wood-burning stove served with a warm tempura goat cheese, spicy cold Kobe beef carpaccio speckled with sunflower seeds, warm sweet tender calamari and arugula salad, chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in prosciutto swimming in sun-dried tomato and coconut sauce, traditional mussels in a warm tomato broth, asparagus stuffed calamari lightly tempura fried and served with two decadent sauces, Homemade (fantastic!) pasta in a light sauce with a rustic medley of mushrooms, a perfectly cooked parmesan and mushroom risotto, a lively seafood risotto, tender salty braised beef short ribs with a fresh herbaceous tomato perched on top all on a truffle broth, homemade Limencello with what is quite possibly the best tiramisu I have ever consumed, sugared heirloom tomatoes, mango sorbet, and coffee. My taste buds were screaming, &#34;More, more!&#34; While my stomach extended in protest. 

(++) The staff was incredibly friendly, welcoming, and engaging. Gaetano gave us a tour downstairs after dinner and took time talking with us about their labor of love. Wendy checked in with us throughout our meal on the timing (We assured her we were in no hurry and did manage to spend a luxurious 4 hours there... no joke) as it appears they may still be ironing out some pacing on dishes. Honestly, the only thing I can remember that wasn&#39;t perfect was that one of the staff members dropped a dish we had wrapped up at our table instead of bringing it to the host stand with the rest of our left-overs. Beyond forgivable and probably not even worth mentioning. 

We can&#39;t wait to head back in and try some of the other amazing dishes. The table next to us was making their own pizzas before they were sent to the wood-burning oven and the tuna carpaccio sounded divine. When I return I will be trying to figure out which amazing Soave and Pinot Noir were our favorites from the pairings so we can order a bottle."

Bread arrived with some type of bean dip and was tasty. Waitress suggested Homade Rigitoni that I ordered and wife had some type of seafood pasta. The food was nicley prepared but was to rich for our tastes. we were only here once and maybe we just ordered the wrong stuff might try it again but $100 for 2 pasta dishes, some beets and a salad was a bit steep for us.

We&#39;re fast becoming regulars. We started with the muscles and calamari steak as appetizers and I had the ribeye steak for dinner. Quite possibly the best steak I&#39;ve ever had and my daughter described the calamari as the best thing she may have ever eaten. Service was excellent and they chose a wine for us that was fantastic. Favorite restaurant in our outside of Chicago.

Gaetano was able to duplicate the Forest Park atmosphere and the quality of the food and service.  Sampled the beet and beef carpaccios and both were incredible.  Our main entrees (short rib with scallops and the pasta special) were awesome.  Dessert (Tiramisu served in a flower pot with a bloom) was a creative and scrumptious end to a fabulous meal.  Our server was friendly, knowledgable and attentive.   We highly recommend Gaetano&#39;s - either location.   You will not be disappointed."

All of the issues we had at our first visit must have been related to that opening week. This time, we had a very experienced waiter (from Italy by his accent.) Also, when we arrived, our table literally was waiting for us in the middle of the busy and nearly full restaurant. We made our reservation by calling Gaetano&#39;s this time and not using Open Table, which also may have caused the table location issues during our last visit. I had the butternut squash gnocchi with short ribs-Yum!- and my hubby had the shrimp and lobster fettucini special. All of the food and drink were amazing!! After dinner, Gaetano himself visited our table and offered us some homemade pistachio-cello just like we have tasted in Rome. It was a great night and wonderful experience, so happy to have a piece of Italy literally in our backyard. Thank you!! We can&#39;t wait to return!!"

However, It could be so much better.
We were seated in the newly opened lower level.  Lots of stairs and no view but a cute space and less crowded than upstairs.
The house baked bread is delicious, really outstanding. The pasta was good. The salad was quite nice and the appetizer was pretty good.I had an issue with the seafood soup.  Broth was well balanced but the seafood was overcooked and rubbery.  It&#39;s sad because there was plenty of it in the bowl!  When the table was cleared none of the staff noticed the almost full bowl of soup going to the garbage or asked if there was a problem with it.
Another issue was the service.  The bus staff was great but the server held what I can only describe as thinly-veiled disdain.  Not an once of friendliness or hospitality.
It&#39;s a shame.
I may come again but it&#39;s hard to justify spending so much money for less-than-excellent service and food that is not all up to par."

We have had an excellent experience both times and this is easily the best restaurant in Batavia.  Now, I&#39;ve read some of the negative reviews, so as a warning to those looking to try this place:  1.You may have to wait, because they do get busy.  2. The restaurant is set up &#34;city&#34; style, meaning you will sit arm to arm with other guests.  It&#39;s a neat experience but if you hate people, don&#39;t go.  3. It can be pricey, but worth the visit if you want to spend the money.  4. It is small.  So, before you go, anticipate taking your time at dinner, spending some money, meeting some great people and eating some delicious food.  The restaurant has a great vibe to it.  The food itself is wonderful.  We did the Gaetapas tasting each time we went which was a fantastic culinary experience.  Lots of different flavors and textures.  The chorizo dates and beet salad are two of my favorites.  I&#39;m glad to have Gaetano&#39;s in Batavia to bring some new flare to the downtown area, and I hope this helps attract additional restaurants/bars.  As for some of the other reviews that said they did not enjoy the food, I hope you do give it a second chance because I&#39;ve been impressed both times."

Incredible for Batavia.  I don&#39;t have a high opinion of food in this town but this is exceptional.  Everything is so fresh and flavorful. I won&#39;t get into specifics because the menu has a great deal of variety.  Then, the service.  The chef and part-owner came out to the tables.  He happened to notice my wife wasn&#39;t eating her dinner which was more meat-intensive than she had presumed ( personally, I loved it).  Without her saying a word, he came over and insisted on making her something else.  Without even asking what she might like, he brought over a dish that she loved!  Either he is a great guesser, my wife had mushroom-infused pasta written on her forehead, or he has a ton of experience.  My guess is the latter.  The atmosphere is to die for. Intimate, well-lit, warm and cozy.  It&#39;s pricey but worth it.  It was clear when we walked in that this space has had some TLC and some investment.  Very happy to great Italian food in our hometown."

When the average entrée is $25, what I had ordered was closer to $32, and the least expensive bottle of wine is $40, and your last name is not Trump, Kardashian,  or anyone else who can just throw around money you expect perfection and don&#39;t think that is too much to ask. My entrée was not prepared to our liking and our exceptional server, and I do mean that sincerely she was very nice, took it back with apologies. It took almost a half an hour before we got the replacement, really? My poor husband was trying to take his time with his dinner so we could eat our meals together. Out, finally, comes the replacement and it was worse then before. Wendy, the owner, comes over and it seems that Linda K., fellow reviewer, had the same encounter we did, no hospitality and was quite rude about the manner. She firmly explained that they want their diners to have an exceptional experience; however really didn&#39;t give an opportunity to explain nor seemed interested in what was wrong and almost seemed offended that we were not having a good experience. Hello customer service?, hello &#34;hey sorry things didn&#39;t work out but we hope you&#39;ll come back and try us again&#34;, their philosophy and her attitude seem to contradict each other. Just like Linda K. we don&#39;t need you to kiss our feet; however, some sincerity  and open ness to the issue would have been nice. What a wonderful way to demonstrate the exceptional dining experience you want your diners to have, not. Normally, we&#39;d give any other restaurant a second shot but after that encounter we won&#39;t be walking through those doors again."

What&#39;s really cool about it is that you can have a different experience every time you go.  For example, you can sit inside and have a fancy night out.  You can sit outside during the summer with girlfriends and drink sangria.  You can come on Sunday morning and have brunch with your kids.  

The food is amazing:  some of our favorites are the goat cheese, the bacon wrapped figs, the tilapia, the spicy potatoes.....actually, everything we&#39;ve ever gotten is really, really good.  This restaurant is one of Naperville&#39;s special gems."

The service was fine and the manager stopped by the table to check on us, which was nice, but we were sat upstairs and I found it to be a bit secluded and less entertaining, plus we had a couple of dishes that were ehh. 
The bread and butter that was brought at the beginning of the meal was just silly.  Cold bread and even colder butter that no one can expect to spread on their bread.  I don&#39;t usually care that much about free bread/butter, but I found it so pointless that I needed to comment.  
We started with the patatas bravas and the lobster over potato and parsnip puree.  The patatas were delicious and full of seasoning.  The lobster dish had nice flavor, but the lobster portion is very small and it was majorly overcooked - super disappointing.  After that we had the crepe rellena and one of the specials, which was monkfish.  The crepe was really good, it was different than expected.  The crepe itself was more like a wonton wrapper - crispy, and the goat cheese and sweetness of the apples were very good.  The monkfish was a large piece, which was appreciated after that tiny lobster dish, but it was also overcooked.  :(  Apparently, they really want to make sure fish is dead before serving.
I still really like the restaurant and will go back, but I&#39;m realizing we have to be choosy with where we sit and what we order."

They were at 7:45pm, we didn&#39;t get seated until about 8ish, at a table that had been ready right when we arrived. It was a messy start already. I wasn&#39;t impressed since I expected a lot since they are pricey, reservations were hard to get, etc. 

Service started off pretty great. The food came out fast, besides the paella. However, whoever&#39;s in kitchen executing dishes, doesn&#39;t understand what pacing is. All the dishes shot out of the kitchen, and basically almost hit a lot of the people seated at the table. 

I would say the best dish was the bacon wrapped dates, I mean there isn&#39;t a way to mess those up. Everything else seemed pretty normal to what you&#39;d find at any tapas restaurant. Seemed the same as Tapas Barcelona in Evanston or Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba in the city. Nothing too impressive. The paella was not authentic. The seafood should be embedded in the rice, but our seafood was just thrown on dry. I could tell they threw it on as an afterthought. The squid was bland and had no taste, since it wasn&#39;t embedded into the rice! 

The waitress was pretty non-existent toward the middle and end of the meal, guess what, she was busy watching the Cubs game. The bus boys were the main event. Then later the manager randomly comes over twice to say happy birthday, when we were really celebrating a bachelorette party.. it was just uncomfortable and awkward. He stood there just trying to make small talk, but it wasn&#39;t natural and necessary. 

When it came to the bill, we had split the tab, but included the gratuity already. When we left the restaurant, the waitress came running and very upset. She asked if we meant to not leave a tip. I then decided to calculate what we paid her and told her we paid well over our bill and we left. She obviously was not paying attention to the fact that we clearly paid wayyy over the total bill. We were not pleased...

Not sure what was going on tonight, but honestly, Meson Sabika needs to step it up if they want to keep up their appearances. Another thing they should think of is NOT cramming as many people into a small table. Their efficiency of space isn&#39;t helpful because it&#39;ll make having dinner uncomfortable since you&#39;re so close to the table of strangers right next to you. They should also consider using more round tables for big groups. The long rectangular tables aren&#39;t helpful when you&#39;re with a group. People miss out on food and conversations when sitting like that. Also if you&#39;re hoping for a nice quiet romantic sit down dinner with a date, this isn&#39;t the place, you&#39;ll be shouting at each other just to be able to hear each other. The crowd is loud! 

Definitely not worth the hype. Maybe the bulk of people that give this place 5 stars haven&#39;t had authentic tasty tapas before.. I am definitely not going back."

And Meson Sabika was one of our favorite restaurant. What a great surprise: it still is in business and has even increased the building size.

I would suggest going with a group of 4 - 8 people. The only downside to a group is that sometimes the tiny dish is gone before you had a chance to taste it.  Some topas dishes are served cold and some are hot.  A couple of my favorite cold dishes are the sautéed wild mushrooms, Manchego cheese which is a Spanish sheep milk cheese and pine nuts. The Patatas con Alioli which is a garlic potato salad is delicious.  

Of the hot tapas I enjoy the oven baked goat cheese with garlic bread, the grilled squid in a garlic sauce and the goat cheese crepe.  If I have room for dessert the chocolate cake with caramel ice cream is the perfect end for a great evening of tapas. 

The décor fits with the old mansion and the gardens are beautiful.  It&#39;s easy to understand why people have special events and wedding receptions at Meson Sabika.  We tend to go to Meson for special occasions mainly because the bill is usually over $100.00 for the two of us but it&#39;s worth it for those special occasions.  The service is fantastic."

The service was impeccable. Have not had better in a long time. Great server, great support staff, food was promptly delivered, we were well taken care of.

And the food... we started with the bacon wrapped dates and moved onto everything from the eggplant to several meat dishes. And the wonderful sweet treats at the end just capped a top notch meal.

If you have never been, Meson actually means mansion, which is what it was.  When it was built is was a mansion or a huge house, still big by today&#39;s standards.

If you eat inside, it still feels like a house, with different rooms.  Every time you go you may get seated somewhere else, so you could be upstairs or downstairs.

On the weekends they have entertainers that either sing or play instruments.... Sort of like a mariachi band.

The outside is one of the best courtyards for outdoor dinning, and actually has a lot of awards for outdoor dining.

Beyond that, great food and drinks.

Must try!"

Decor was very simple but elegant and flowed with old charm. I ordered a good variety of tapas, black bean soup, dates wrapped in bacon, lobster, steak skewers, side salad, mashed potatoes with lobster on top, and the valenciana paella. Some things stood out such as the steak skewers, lobster and even the dates were pretty tasty. The paella was okay, kinda dry, the shell fish lacked a good flavor. They were just boiled and thrown on top. I would return for tapas only. Strawberry sangria was not good it was made with strawberry syrup not real strawberries. I polished my evening off with one of their signature desserts, chocolate cake with raspberry jam, it was okay."

Meson has the best wedding food ever! They even remembered that I asked not to put green peppers in a tapa and all my guests were RAVING about the food.
Also the staff were AMAZING during the reception. It was very hot on the dance floor and they handled it in a snap! It cooled down like magic.

My boyfriend and I had reservations at 8:30pm for a Saturday night - we had to wait an additional 10-15 minutes for seating (kind of strange since we had reservations, but it&#39;s a popular place).

We ordered the Bogavante al Horno (baked lobster tail), Pipirrana de Buey (skirt steak), Patatas Bravas (spicy potatoes), Croquetas de Jamon y Pollo (croquettes of Serrano ham and chicken breast), and Plátano con Helado (sauteed banana with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream). We also ordered a mojito and red wine sangria. Everything was delicious, but not the most flavorful (in comparison to other Spanish tapas places I&#39;ve been to).

The only complaint I have is that there&#39;s limited lighting on the outdoor patio at night, so I had trouble reading the menu. But all in all a great experience."

Julie of the events department worked with the couple and us from the conception of planning.  The wedding pavilion was beautiful with the draped ceiling and chandeliers and little Italian lights. Our additions of table runners, cylinder floating candles and flowers really accentuated the beauty of the space.  The private bride&#39;s room was a nice space and had a large single bathroom.  We chose the tapas/traditional package for the reception. We added a seafood bar which was a huge hit!  The raw oysters, grilled octopus and chilled shrimp were gobbled up in minutes. Everyone raved about the flavor of the octopus. The butler passed appetizers we served were the bacon wrapped dates, caprese skewers and tiger shrimp in lemon. As expected, the bacon wrapped dates were the favorite.  That&#39;s why out of the four appetizers in our package we only served three and doubled the dates. Good call.  The bartenders did a great job, especially Victor and the other man with him. Victor was so personable and accommodating.  We chose four tapas served at the table, the stuffed mushrooms, salmon, jamon &amp; manchego and baked goat cheese.  Again, our guests were loving all that was served. For the entrees, we served a marinated skirt steak with potatoes and also a tilapia with couscous.  The chef was accommodating when we wanted the sides changed to our entrees. We were underwhelmed with the presentation at the tasting, but they really worked with us on that. The food at the tasting was very good and in mass production for a large crowd came out just as good.  Although, I overheard that the skirt steak was tough and chewy, but those around me said it was tender, which is exactly what I was worried about (chewy or overdone) but I think it was very few.  I was really not happy that the staff did not check the wine and sangria on the table once it ran out. One bottle of wine and a small pitcher of sangria gives a table of ten about one glass each.  In two hours throughout dinner, that should have been checked and replenished. Guests were wanting more. That was a big fail in my eyes.  We brought in our own sweet table, but did have a late night snack of sliders and fries from Meson. The sliders were dry and overcooked, but the fries were excellent.  All in all even with the lack of beverage service during dinner and the overcooked sliders, I would recommend Meson for a wedding. Julie was a pleasure to work with and responded to calls and emails promptly.  She is accommodating and wants the best for her clients.  We also want to recognize the chef and owner who also worked with us. I also recommend Meson Sabika for dinner...my husband and I always frequent Meson Sabika for great tapas and sangria.r"

The place itself is gorgeous and very unique and totally reminded me of the colonial restaurants in Charleston so it was a nice touch to find it within an hour from home. The downstairs is beautiful with gorgeous hanging chandeliers and we had dinner upstairs at one of their more private rooms which was nice but I felt it was a little claustrophobic. The only thing is that it was quieter and you can actually hear each other where downstairs was very loud. And luckily they had bathrooms on both floors. 

Our server was nice and polite. We tried both sangrias and I definitely preferred the white over the red. They get a star for good drinks. The appetizers were a hit or miss. I loved the bacon wrapped dates, I also loved the croquettes. The grilled octopus was on the chewy side and I didn&#39;t love the potatoes bravas as they were more soggy than I would have preferred. For our main meal we ordered the paella valenciana and it was horrible. I should have sent it back because it did look pretty on pics, but taste wise it was horrible. I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be like the one I had in Valencia but I was hoping that it would compare to some Spanish restaurants in Chicago and it failed. The paella was bland and almost watered down. The shrimp were just placed on top for decorations but they weren&#39;t cooked within the rice and the sauce. That paella needed a major adjustment on the taste levels. The chicken inside of it was the only okay thing because it was actually cooked in the rice. They say it takes 45 min to cook but yet it was brought out to us in 10 minutes so that makes no sense to me as I hope they didn&#39;t just microwave it. 

So overall things were okay. Server was nice. Some appetizers were tasty, drinks were good. Paella was bad. But what we didn&#39;t like was that we brought a cake to blow out for the birthday girl and the server comes out and says &#34;sorry cake fell apart in the kitchen, it&#39;s not even worth bringing out well just cut it in the back.&#34; That was low, if I was the bday girl I would have been pissed. When we got it it was warm and the frosting was Melting so there is no way they had kept it in the fridge like we asked them to. That was a mistake on their part and they also had the nerve to charge us a cutting fee when they basically ruined the cake. Meson sabika, you&#39;re petty but looks aren&#39;t everything. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be back."

I mean, have you had the opportunity to dine in their courtyard here in the spring?? Magical is not an overstatement. I honestly feel like I&#39;m in an impressionist painting here. The flowers are blooming, the trees and their branches surround you, the lights and shadows dance and twinkle around you, and if you&#39;re lucky, there are flamenco dancers and musicians entertaining you as well.

The menu is extensive, truly something for everyone. It&#39;s also delicious, though it could taste like cardboard and I&#39;d still return for said ambience. Luckily, it does not. The tapas are seemingly authentic, inventive, and oh so tasty! Drool worthy. It&#39;s also a lovely presentation with stellar service. They are all about service here! If you don&#39;t leave happy, it&#39;s not because they didn&#39;t try. It&#39;s because you are quite possibly a jackhole. ;) But honestly, they are welcoming and very good at keeping a proper pace of play. It can be expensive depending on what you order, and how many tapas you order of course, so it&#39;s really hard to predict how much an average dinner might be as it&#39;s all relative to you. And it&#39;s really tempting to not order a bazillion items, but that&#39;s the beauty, share, share, share! Brunch is also served on Sundays. Don&#39;t forget to try the sangria-- excellent!

Oh, I haven&#39;t even mentioned the mansion. The restaurant is actually a mansion, reminds me personally of an old southern plantation style in structure and interior decor- quite over the top- and if I looked more closely it would likely be much more Spanish inspired than I realize, but I&#39;m honestly so enamored by the courtyard, I just can&#39;t see anything else. I suppose if I want to pay better attention, I&#39;ll have to come here in the winter when the courtyard is closed up. By the way, there&#39;s a story (and you can ask for a printed copy) of how the top floor is supposedly haunted. They have service upstairs as well, but haven&#39;t when I&#39;ve been there. They will let you explore upstairs which is kind of fun and you start to see and feel things that may or may not be there. Oooooh!  

So, if you are ok with other-worldly beings co-mingling with your guests, I would most definitely consider Meson Sabika for a wedding, shower, family dinner, date night, visitors from out of town, or any special occasion. It&#39;s so lovely!"

We are a little bias as we had our wedding reception here - but the reason why we even picked Meson Sabika for our wedding was because we loved the food so much! 

Our go-to favorites are the pincho de pollo (chicken skewer with chorizo sausage and amazing dipping sauce), the queso de cabra (baked goat cheese in a bed of tomato bisque with garlic bread for dipping), and the garlic potato salad (some SERIOUS garlic on this one - it&#39;s absolutely delicious!)  

The restaurant is in an old mansion so you can be seated in one of it&#39;s many beautiful rooms, but if it is a nice day/night out - we&#39;d highly recommend sitting on their patio!"

I can see why. Located in a pretty white house with various dining rooms and a spacious outdoor dining terrace, Mesón Sabika vibe is part country club, part home comfort. We came for lunch on a Tuesday and the place was quiet, only a handful of other groups were dining. It was really nice sitting outside sharing a trio of tapas and a paella. Depending on how hungry your group is, that&#39;s a good amount of food for three people. One or two additional cold tapas would&#39;ve rounded out the meal even more if we&#39;d been ravenous. 

The Valenciana paella was delicious with chicken, clams, mussels, and shrimp, though it was missing the signature crusty bottom of crunchy rice that I&#39;m used to in paella. The hot tapas were what I really enjoyed. I could bathe in the Queso de Cabra, oven baked goat cheese with garlic bread. It&#39;s rich, creamy, and savory. I would order that again and again. The Pipirrana de Buey is skirt steak with onions, cheese, and potato. A filling addition to the table. The Patatas Bravas were tasty but a little disappointing."

Had the pleasure to come here on my trip to Chicago. First thing you notice is just how beautiful the setting is, it feels like you are on the private country estate of a nobleman.
We had reservations and got seated right away in the Granada room. The entire place was filled with groups of people talking and laughing so it was a little loud but the atmosphere was just so joyous and pleasant.
The servers were attentive, helpful, kind and they truly elevated the entire experience. To top it all off the food was outstanding we were in a large group so we tried a lot of things and truly everything was delicious.

Unfortunately, I was the designated driver and did not get to try any of the many different sangria, but I&#39;m sure they were as delicious as the food.

The restaurant is very large and I definitely recommend reservations or you will be waiting a very long time - especially on a Saturday night.  It&#39;s an old historic home and they have seating in different places.  We sat upstairs - away from the main dining room - and that was best for us b/c we wanted to hear each other and be able to talk.  When we walked out, the dining room was very loud - so keep that in mind.  It&#39;s definitely a place people go to with large groups.

Our server was good and he not only suggested items that &#34;everyone&#34; orders, but he also told us his favorites.  The menu is quite extensive, but we had:  Patatas con Alioli (garlic potato salad - where you have to looove garlic b/c it&#39;s deliciously infused in it); Stuffed Dates (our second favorite dish), Beef tenderloin brochette, Grilled beef tenderloin, and the skirt steak.

For dessert, all three of us ordered a different one...and then b/c we were all celebrating a milestone birthday, our server brought us a fourth dessert.  Don&#39;t judge us - but we ate them all!  We had the Sauteed banana with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream, Soft-centered, warm chocolate cake served with caramel ice cream, Warm bittersweet chocolate and caramel custard baked in a hazelnut tart crust with vanilla ice cream, and the Profiteroles.  All four were really good!  We were stuffed by the end.

I would go back to Meson Sabika in a heartbeat - if I lived near it.  I highly recommend the restaurant."

Don&#39;t know how I managed to avoid Meson for so long......my good friend is  friends with the owners and I&#39;ve lived in Naperville for years??? Anyway, I&#39;m glad I finally made it in because the tapas and sangrias are delish. I went with a group of 12 ladies, so we tasted at least half of the menu. Nothing was disappointing. We also tried 3 different sangria flavors and all were really good. A few of my fave tapas were the tiger shrimp, Atlantic salmon, and the chicken kabobs. Many people raved about the garlic potato salad, but it was too garlicky for me. The only dessert I tried was the chocolate cake with caramel ice cream......DELICIOUS!

The service was excellent. We were in a private room and our server did an excellent job of explaining the different dishes to us and making suggestions."

The restaurant looks like an old fashioned house/mansion with tons of chandeliers and a cozy atmosphere. It was super crowded when we arrived and I would highly recommend making a reservation in advance, as it was packed. 

This would be a great atmosphere for a wedding, bridal shower, or rehearsal dinner but a pricey option for sure. 

There are tons of menu options! Everything is served tapas style. Like most tapas places, I do think they are over priced. 

I had the: 
Solomillos a la Plancha
Grilled beef tenderloins served with a mashed potato puree, drizzled with red wine sauce  
The meat was delicious but the potatoes were cold. I didn&#39;t share this tapas, but it was a perfect dinner size, not too much and not too little. 

I wanted to try every desert on the menu. They all looked delicious!!!
I ended up getting: 
Frutas con Mousse Blanco
Fresh berries drizzled with raspberry coulis, served with white chocolate mousse 
which was basically just berries and a mousse to dip them in. It was basic but yummy!

What I also liked was that I did not gain 2 lbs instantly after eating here! So if you are watching your calories and stick to water, you might not do too bad!"

We made the reservation two months before the date. About one month before the date, we were not able to add 3 more people as they all booked. Quite a popular place.

We don&#39;t see much garden estate type of restaurant around here. I won&#39;t be not surprised that this is the popular place for weddings and celebrations. We were seated out at the huge open pavilion. I&#39;m usually not a fan for the buffet but this time I got some great suggestions on this place so I&#39;m able to focus on the selected items along the huge buffet choices. 

Personal favorites are jumbo shrimp, bacon wrapped dates, and fresh fruits. Yes, I got the fruit listed as they were juicy and tasted excellent. Really, everything was really good. We, mothers got treated with mimosa and rose. 

Services were pretty good but not outstanding. Large crowd at the queuing line at the buffet table. I&#39;d like to try the regular table service next time."

It&#39;s hands-down the most unique dining experience in Naperville.  The food is always amazing, the service outstanding, and the ambience unforgettable.

I&#39;ve probably been here about 10 times and each time I find something new and amazing to try.  The menu is expansive and literally has a taste for everyone&#39;s palate.  Everything is tapas, so you can order a bunch of plates to share at a table and give everyone a taste of something new.

The service is always outstanding.  I wish other restaurants could get the vetting process down for hiring people like Meson Sabika does.  Literally every single time I&#39;ve eaten here, the service has been outstanding.  The service staff know the menu well, and they always have outstanding wine pairings.

Lastly, the place itself.  If you haven&#39;t been, it&#39;s an old mansion located on Aurora Ave, about 3/4 mile west of downtown Naperville.  There&#39;s a ton of parking for free.  It&#39;s definitely fun to come here in the summertime and eat outside, the patio is a delight on warm summer evenings.  However, the interior is also really beautiful and a fun place to have dinner on a winter evening.  The bar is really cool and the bartenders are great.

This is a beautiful restaurant with excellent food, but today we experienced a lack of ADULT SUPERVISION at lunch

We had a reservation today for a noon luncheon for a party of 5 - the first return in all those years - relatives from near and far - some from thousands of miles away.

As I pulled into the parking lot and was walking toward my brother in laws car, a mini van pulled in at high speed and parked immediately in front of me although there were well over 100 empty parking spaces in the near empty lot

As our party of 5 made our leisurely way toward the door remembering days past, we saw that we were slowing down the mini-van driver, and suggested she go ahead

A bit later as we entered the restaurant, our van driving acquaintance was at the reception desk as the hostess was on the phone. 

On completion of the call, the hostess greeted the patron who explained that she did not have a reservation but was with a party of 4, the others soon to arrive. 

Dining inside or out was offered, and she was shown to the outside options. My brother in law and I tagged along to also see what the patio was like and to gauge the temperature. 

The escorted woman was offered one of two 4-tops along the side of the building. She however noticed a 6-top away from the wall, asked for that, and was seated. 

I elected to decline outside dining at either of the 2 tables near the wall since that would be somewhat claustrophobic. In fairness - on this unusually warm October day, table options were limited,  only about 5% of the patio was understandably in service.

We dined inside and it was fine, albeit with slow service. Still an outside table was preferred.

As we left the restaurant, our hostess was again on the phone.

I can&#39;t fault the party seated before us or the enthusiastic young staff, but definitely fault the owners and management for not being there and/or not giving their staff the training one would expect for such an establishment

If there is slack to be cut, it&#39;s that the service we experienced today is more typical at any restaurant than not

There&#39;s a huge selection of tapas and larger dishes and I&#39;ve never felt let down. Both the red and white sangrias are tasty and boozy enough. My hubby had a caipirinha  in honor of the Olympics and it was delicious - nice and limey. And the patio! If the weather&#39;s nice at all, sit out there and be transported to a relaxing Spanish get away. Inside the mansion is more formal and pleasant, even though it feels a little close. The reception hall is mostly glass so you can enjoy the beautiful grounds. One drawback: the awful, uninviting, dark little bar at the back.

A friend and I had planned to go to Chicago for a fancy night out, but some events of the day prevented a trek into town. We still wanted a nice meal, though, so she suggested Meson Sabika; right in our backyard, yet still an excuse to get dressed up. :)

We arrived for our reservation right as they were seating for dinner, and were spirited away upstairs to a small and VERY dim room (seriously, guys, lights?) with a few tables. It was attached to what was apparently the upstairs kitchen, from which issued forth a good deal of crashing. The dining area was quiet for a while until a large group of people celebrating a 50th birthday showed up and were seated against the wall; their loud voices echoing off the wall filled the small room with noise and quickly got obnoxious. 

Well anyway, the food. We did several rounds of tapas, and the servers did a good job of clearing our small table. In order of favorite dishes:

- Crepe Rellena: the surprise favorite! A delicately crisp crepe filled with apples, goat cheese, spinach and pine nuts on a plate of sweet red pepper sauce. It&#39;s hard to imagine all these flavors marrying until you try it, but definitely give it a taste.

- Patatas con Aioli: super garlicky cold potato salad. The only potato salad I like. If you&#39;re dining with a date, you&#39;d both better eat this, or plan on swilling some mouthwash before the good night kiss!

- Datiles con Tocino: Luscious sweet dates wrapped in smoky bacon, again served on the sweet pepper sauce. My friend didn&#39;t care for these so they were all for me...but I must admit that a little goes a long way and this indulgence is best shared. 

- Pipirrana de Buey: A little cauldron of skirt steak, onions, potato and blue cheese sauce. Nice blend of salty cheese and savory meat with the sweetness of sauteed onion as well. 

- Queso de Cabra: Baked goat cheese in tomato-basil sauce with garlic bread. Too much sauce and too little cheese IMO. Tasty though.

For dessert we got the rich and maddeningly delicious Tarta de Chocolate y Caramelo: chocolate-caramel-hazelnut tart with vanilla ice cream and a berry sauce. 

Service was generally prompt when we were ready for another round, but as we were waiting to order dessert a manager swung by and asked how we were doing; we mentioned dessert and he took the order himself, which was nice and kept the flow moving. 

Overall, the food was great, service was fine but our location in this instance was less than ideal. Still, Meson Sabika is always memorable and will clearly remain among the pantheon of Naperville fine dining."

They only had a reservation for 8pm, and that was fine.  After the monsoon, the parking lot was rather flooded so there was a guy directing us where to park - why don&#39;t more places have this??? 

We made our way inside to a pretty packed place - including the wedding reception going on.  We were seated upstairs, it was a little loud with conversations going on at the other tables, but we adapted quickly.  My friend and I split a pitcher of red sangria - soooooo good!!! We ordered one warm tapas and two cold - after splitting three plates, we were surprisingly full, but had just enough room for dessert...two of them! :)  I wasn&#39;t stuffed to the max, but pleasantly full, I&#39;d say... it didn&#39;t even seem like that much food but I think the bread with our dishes filled us up enough.

I seriously wanted one of every dessert on the menu...we settled on the white chocolate mousse and almond/pear pound cake to split - both were delicious!  The service was great, the food was sooooo great... we cannot wait to come back here!!! On our way out we grabbed &#34;to go&#34; menus, this way we can plan ahead and not spend so much time going through the menu.  I cannot wait to come back and dine outside, the grounds here are beautiful."

This is especially true on St. Valentine&#39;s Day. They will allow families with children to be seat at all locations in the resturant. This is not a problem when children are older or well behaved or when parents realize an occasion is taking place. Otherwise this situation can ruin a well planned, expensive, romantic outing.

On a Valentine&#39;s Day dinner, which has to be reserved way in advance, a couple brought in a child, a 1y/o that was both loud and distracting. Was was the parents solution? Open an iPad that was on its brightest setting. In the room where many couples were at candle lit tables attempting to enjoy a romantic dinner to the wails of a child and the bright lights AND sounds of an iPad game. Speaking to management brought no solution.

No more can be said. I love children, but this was intolerable."

I can&#39;t believe that I have never reviewed this place, I&#39;ve eaten here so many times! Where do I even begin. First of all, it&#39;s so *fun* to eat here. It&#39;s an old mansion on beautiful grounds, with a large outdoor space for dining as well as a large even space (they host a lot of wedding receptions). It&#39;s great for a romantic evening, but it&#39;s not stuffy so it&#39;s perfect for a large group as well. Secondly, the food is just superb. I am a little biased to Spanish food because I spent a semester in Spain in college, but that also means I have an idea of what is authentic. This place is for real. They have a very large tapas menu segmented out into hot and cold options, and there are always different specials that change frequently. They offer a few different types of paella - be aware, that takes a while to prepare but they do warn you- and a good selection of tasty desserts as well. 

Some of my very favorites tapas, in case you are looking for recommendations: Jamon Serrano (place of traditional spanish cured ham and machego cheese), tostada con centolla (toast points with crab and avocado), Pimientos del Piquillo (stuffed peppers in a black bean sauce) and Champiñones (stuffed mushrooms). Their bacon wrapped dates are always on point, too. You really can&#39;t go wrong! In fact, my vegetarian sister came to visit last summer so we ate an entire non-meat meal and everyone was more than happy with all of our selections - there are lots of options.

They also serve a Sunday brunch now. I&#39;ve been once with my husband and while it is a little pricey, you get what you pay for. It&#39;s a huge spread of many of their most popular tapas, cared meat, and all of the usual/traditional American brunch items as well. They also include a glass of Cava or a mimosa, AND offer you a made-to-order plated egg dish. My husband regretted skipping this; I never say no when someone offers me Eggs Benedict.  The beauty of this is that it&#39;s made to order and not sitting out on in a chafing dish; that just kills a benedict but mine was fresh, soft and yummy. 

If you live anywhere near Naperville and have not eaten here, go. Go now. Oh, and the sangria is great, too!"

It was the Sunday after Christmas and we managed to snag a 10:30 a.m. reservation a few days prior so we arrived before things got crazy crowded.

We arrived and were brought to a room upstairs, which seemed to be for people with small children (my one year old nephew was with us) as the downstairs rooms were full of adults and older children. We were seated at a table that had dead flowers (nice) and the room was ice cold. A basket of bread was brought out, but no butter. Eh..... 

Our waiter was very nice, but I cannot remember his name. He explained how everything worked, and then took our drink order (mimosa for me, Bloody Mary for the hubs) and omelet order (cheese and chorizo) and then we made our way downstairs to the buffet. 

Everyone raves about the bacon wrapped dates, but I was a bit skeptical at first. I&#39;ve never tried dates, as I assumed they were like big raisins and I hate raisins. But I was brave and tried one.  It was.... okay, I suppose. It was way too sweet; I could hardly detect the bacon on the thing. I felt like I was eating a sweet potato drenched in maple syrup. Oh well, I tried. 

The calamari was excellent, as was the ceviche (I had three large servings of it).
I also probably consumed a pint of raspberries on my own. The bacon was cooked perfectly and I am not ashamed to admit that I consumed at least 15 pieces. 

Garlic potato salad= uh MAY zing! Soooo garlicky, and addictive!  I tried the paella which was okay. Chorizo links, cheeses, a couscous dish, fresh fruit.... all great! I know there was plenty more that I tried but I can&#39;t remember it now. They also have a carving station but I didn&#39;t partake in that. There was just so much food to sample.

The brunch is about $30 a person which is a fair price, given the variety of food and the quality of same.  It was a nice time spent with family and I enjoyed the experience."

This place is 5 stars based on the quality of food, service and atmosphere but it is not a 5 star restaurant in the classic sense. It is located in an old mansion. The surrounding grounds and the building itself speak of a time gone by. The charm and class of this place truly gives a sense of comfort and relaxation as soon as you step out of your car. There is also a banquet hall for the Sunday brunch and weddings or special occasion. A beautiful room. There was a wedding taking place here yesterday.There was a horse drawn carriage giving rides around the grounds that just added even more class and charm to the happenings all around.

Besides the charm of the place I can say that most of the rooms in the house where you dine are a bit small and can feel somewhat tight but as soon as you taste the food you forget about that. The service here is excellent. We like to dine outdoors here when the weather permits. The outdoor part of this establishment is huge and much more open so you are not at all cramped. Nearly all of it is shaded by huge old trees and umbrellas. Every time we come we are in a group of 4 to 10. It is always a party as it was again last night outside.You are never rushed here and the 3 hours we spend each time we come here just flies by.

As for the food it is Spanish tapas style. So small portions to share.There is a large variety of fish, seafood, meat, and vegi. dishes to choose from. With all of the different things we have tried, and we have tried nearly everything, no one in any of our visits have ever complained or not like anything. The menu does change from time to time based on some seasonal things and items do come back. There are some of the signature items like figs wrapped in bacon and robust garlic potato salad which are always there. You have to try these. Figs wrapped in bacon? Yea they are awesome!

There is a full bar, house made sangria&#39;s and a large list of after dinner drinks and coffees to accompany your top notch desert menu. I have left here many a time wishing I could get wheel barrow service back to my car. Yes just wheel me out and flip me into the seat until I come back again next time to do it all again!"

First off, I had no idea that this restaurant is located in a renovated Mansion. Because we came here around Christmas, it was decorated and lit up beautifully. We were seated upstairs, in a cozy room accept, it was a tad bit cold as we were seated by the window. However, I did not let that deter me. Our server was Danny D. and he was just fabulous! Excellent service and very knowledgeable about the various dishes that we ordered. I have been to many Tapas restaurants and we ordered quite a few dishes anticipating small plates. They were definitely bigger than most tapas dishes, but hey, I am not complaining. Every single dish we ordered was absolutely delicious! We ordered the goat cheese, tomato basil with garlic bread; I am not not to dip my bread in soup, but I couldn&#39;t help it. It was that damn good! We also ordered the story crepe, the pimientos del piquell, empanada de buey, tostadas con centoll, vieiras, and the patatas bravas. A couple of other favorites were the Vieira-the scallops and cous cous was perfection and the tostadas con centoll-oh, the lumps of king crab meat!!
For dessert, we opted for the chocolate and caramel tart and the almond butter cake. Both were delish! I highly recommend and we will be going back! 
Oh, I almost forgot the scrumptious almond cookies that they give you with the bill. Such a bummer that they do not sell them."

Our oldest had been there with her class and raved about it, and kept bugging us about going.
    We got three kinds of tapas: grilled pork, pasta, and scallops.  EVERYTHING was fantastic. Service was tops. For dessert we got the Creme de Chocolata, which is creme brulee with warm chocolate on the bottom. 
   Our waiter explained the place and the options wonderfully. 
   The decor is simple and beautiful. Very quaint. The grounds look nice, but we didn&#39;t get around it too much, since it&#39;s 10 degrees out today.

Not too spicy but enough to really appreciate the fresh peppers that went in there along with fresh squeezed lime juice. The garlic potato salad is the best potato salads I&#39;ve ever had. Period. If you enjoy garlic then you must order this. I can&#39;t explain what their process is but garlic is infused throughout the dish. From the potatoes themselves to the sauce they are tossed in. The scallops and the skirt steak were phenomenal too. The nature of tapas is to order plenty of dishes and come with a group to have a sample of everything.

Obviously a sharing menu. Some items are larger than others. The Prices are appropriate for each item, in my opinion. Expect to order maybe 3 or 4 things per person.  Starting at about $7, if I recall. 

You always have to get the garlic potato salad and the bacon wrapped dates for sure.

-The drinks are tasty but very diluted so you can&#39;t taste much alcohol; I recommend the prickly pear or pomegranate sangrias, if you like subtlety in fruit. 
-Personal favorite dishes: Patatas con Alioli (only if you LOVE garlic), Datilos con Tocino (roasted bacon-wrapped dates with red pepper sauce), Chorizo y Morcillo.

I have been going here for years, mostly for special occasions, and the food, the service and the atmosphere are all, always, outstanding. That said, there are a few things you should know before going to the Mesón Sabika: This is an expensive dinner out, not a casual tapas-bar experience. The surroundings are elegant - a real-live mansion, originally built as a home, with lots of interior spaces, as well as outdoor seating surrounded by gardens and landscaping. It is a very popular restaurant, and gets very crowded, with a long wait for closely-spaced tables; reservations are definitely recommended. In recent years they have been increasing their &#39;event&#39; business - weddings, receptions, parties - making it even more crowded. Be patient, the dinner is worth it. I&#39;ve never had a bad dish at Mesón Sabika, and it&#39;s tapas, so I&#39;ve had a *lot* of dishes there. If you can&#39;t decide what to order, just ask the staff - they are very helpful and knowledgeable."

The first time I went, we went during an off-peak hour in the middle of the day. Food was presented fresh &amp; hot, and the service was impeccable! All the other times I&#39;ve visited have been much busier. The food didn&#39;t taste as fresh/hot by the time it reached the table, and the service was good but not great. 

I recommend most of the hot tapas! The paella was good, but be prepared for a long wait."

This is one of my favorite places to eat in Naperville!  My number one favorite tapas is the garlic potato salad.  It&#39;s only for true garlic lovers, but it&#39;s phenomenal!  I order a few pounds of it to go when I&#39;m entertaining sometimes.  I also love the bacon wrapped dates and the bocadillo de solomillo (grilled beef tenderloin sandwiches with carmelized onions and horseradish and sour cream).  Their sangria is wonderful, too!  Since the tapas are small plates you and your friends can order several of them and try new foods.  Go there as soon as you can; you won&#39;t be sorry!"

They featured champagne (or sparkling wine as the server likes to call it) or mimosa (which is champagne mixed with orange juice) - the first one is standard part of the brunch and subsequent ones are a little cheaper. Tea, coffee and juice are included with the buffet. The place was crowded and it was wise to make reservations prior. You get to choose one of 3 styles of omelet, one of 2 soups and 1 of 4 (or sometimes 5)  desserts from the kitchen via your server.

You get unlimited breads with butter on the table and of course they have a longish table with hot tapas choices {stuffed mushrooms, pork, beef, chicken, sausages, all with grilled vegetables} . There is another table with cold tapas {salmon, caprese topped with sardines, tuna filled cannellonis, etc) . They also have something more &#34;American&#34; traditional for the little ones like hamburgers and fries. Also added to the Sunday buffet are 3 seafood hot preparations and 3 meat preparations (beef, chicken and pork). There is even a carving station! Then there are several fruits, including papaya, watermelon, honeydew melon, strawberry, cantaloupes, etc. 

I almost forgot they always have the dates wrapped in bacon, drizzled with something, works like a dessert in itself! I think they call it Dátiles con Tocino. 

The placed is housed in a mansion and has a separate large hall (for banquets). They have very nice service and the little touches, which in my humble opinion - make this place classy. Such as a large mirror just outside the restrooms (signs marked Senores and Dames, make it easy to figure them out), so you can check yourself prior to returning to your table. Even the cups are curved in the right way, something I have not seen elsewhere, so when they touch your lips, it is easier to sip. The service is excellent over all. I shall be back for sure."

My wedding reception was here, my sister&#39;s wedding and reception were here, and it is a family favorite. The food is served in small plates, and each one is unique and bursting with flavor. We always order pitchers of sangria with our meal. I always save room for dessert because my favorite dessert ever is here- almond-pear poundcake with ice cream and caramel sauce. If you come during warm weather, sit out on the patio. It is beautiful! The only issue you might run into is that there is a lot of seafood on the menu. This is not a problem for me as I love seafood, and there are plenty of non-seafood items, but if you are ordering plates to share as a group and one or two people do not like seafood, it could be an issue. Any time I go to any other restaurant, I always regret not just going to Meson Sabika. I&#39;ve been there probably at least 50 times, and I&#39;ve never been disappointed."

Great for friend/family gathering, even for a business dinner. I like that they have enough parking space. It is sometimes a hustle to find a place to park in Naperville. That is not an issue here.  The only minus is that it is a bit pricy compared to the equivalent quality Spanish tapas places in the city. Well, they do not really have much competition in Naperville, so that we would just have to take it whatever the price they&#39;ve got, or would have to travel to the city...."

We had a reservation but had to wait for a table. That&#39;s fine, though we passed a large room full of empty tables on the way to the bar...

After 10 minutes, we realized most people at the bar were being seated in that room, our table included. Then a red flag went off: every table in that room was filled in about 15 minutes.

My instinct was right...my table of 4 ordered 3 tapas dishes at a time and we unfortunately received one about every 20 minutes. That means we each had a bite of food, 2 bites tops, and then sat for 20 minutes.

That being said, I was hungry! I&#39;ve never eaten more bread in a meal than I did here. At least they kept the bread coming...

And with the slow food service, the whole meal took a long time. The reservation was at 8 and we left at 10:30...

Also, the menu is so large it was overwhelming. My table agreed it would be easier if these paper menus were similar to a sushi place, where you mark off what you want!"

I went on Yelp and found Meson Sabika and it sounded really great. We had a hard time finding the place but I&#39;m so glad we eventually found it. The entrance was very pretty. There was a nice flower garden and mini fountain setup. It was raining the night we went. I wish I got some nice pictures of the outside. We were about 20 minutes late to our reservation, but they were so friendly - we were seated right away! The service was very good. I really liked their dishes too. There were some very unique dishes with great flavors. I loved the Datiles con Tocino (bacon wrapped dates)! I really liked the Vieras Albarino (sea scallops with couscous). The Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp) was tasty. The Calamares a la Plancha (squid) was good. Obviously I love seafood since that&#39;s the majority of what we ordered haha. For seafood, it is important that the sauces are flavorful because that helps to bring out the seafood. For meats, if it is seasoned too heavily it will be too salty and you cannot taste the natural meat flavor itself. I did order one other meat dish (besides the bacon wrapped dates) - the Chorizo y Morcilla. The chorizo on the plate was very, very salty...too salty, but I did like the blood sausage. We also ordered a salad - the Ensalada Gabriela (arugula and watercress salad with apples, pecans, raisins, with Muscatel sun dried tomato olive oil vinaigrette). Honestly, this salad was probably my favorite plate. The sea scallops were my second favorite. It was really delicious. I really could eat that all day. Pair your dishes with a glass of their sangria. For dessert, we ordered the Tarta de Chocolate y Caramelo. Overall, this was a very nice dinner. If I am ever back in Naperville, I would go back!"

When I called I had asked if I could order off the regular menu instead of the special pre set $45 valentine&#39;s day menu they were offering. I am pregnant so I am a little bit finicky about what I eat as well as having normal pregnancy food restrictions and my husband and I  while adventurous, knew that we would not enjoy the valentine&#39;s day menu after looking over it.  The woman on the phone was unsure so she got a manager. The male manager I spoke to assured me that the pre set $45 per person valentine&#39;s day menu was just a choice for Sunday and I could still order whatever I would like off the regular menu. Upon arriving on Sunday we were told by the server that the only choice was the pre set menu. I explained that I had confirmed I could order off the regular menu when making my reservation and the server just kept telling me that the regular menu was available on Friday or Saturday but not that night, Sunday, and even though I&#39;m pregnant and can&#39;t eat all of it, it was a very good menu. We asked to be given a few minutes to re look over the pre set menu and decide if we were going to stay or not. During that time the manager came over who was very unsympathetic and reiterated the fact that the regular menu was not available but all the food was delicious. The manager blatantly ignored the fact that I was very disappointed because I had gone out of my way to ensure the regular menu was available and couldn&#39;t eat everything on the pre set menu due to being pregnant. My husband and I ultimately decided to stay because getting into a nice restaurant at seven in the evening on valentine&#39;s day without a reservation would be a nightmare. I asked for a plate of olives, not on the pre set menu, to tide me over because I could not eat any of the first cold plate and could not eat the mushroom salad on the second cold plate. I was brought olives without argument, thankfully. The food was okay. I think our favorites were the potato salad and bacon wrapped dates. The pork and beef were incredibly dry even though they weren&#39;t over cooked so I suspect that the protein had been pre cooked and then sitting in a buffet tray under a heat lamp waiting to be plated. Each plate brought to us was no more than half eaten when we asked for the next plate to be brought and the current one to be cleared. Both my husband and I left disappointed and while I would really like to go back and try the regular menu I just can&#39;t bring myself to give my business to a place that so clearly did not care or apologize for their screw up and acted as if the problem were me. Had I been told that only the pre set valentine&#39;s day menu was available on valentine&#39;s day I would have been more than understanding and chose a different place to celebrate with my husband. I shouldn&#39;t have to ask my spouse if he wants to stop on the way home and grab food after leaving a nice restaurant."

If you&#39;re an adventurous eater, I would recommend the scallops or the bacon wrapped dates!

We made a reservation, which was good because they were packed. The restaurant itself is beautiful and there grounds look gorgeous even though it was snowy out. However, I just wasn&#39;t impressed with the food and I was surprised because people can&#39;t stop raving about this place. 

I started with the smoked salmon, since that is my favorite appetizer anywhere I go. It was ok..a bit too cold. And way too much cream cheese. Café BaBaReeba does this one better. I actually think everything here that can be pre-made is. The food comes out very fast and we asked for something to be made without nuts and were told it was already made so..yeah. The bacon wrapped dates were pretty good, except it came in a weird sauce. I tried my friend&#39;s goat cheese appetizer and that was tasty. We also got the pear, goat cheese and spinach empanada (the thing that came with the nuts). This literally had NO TASTE at all. We each took 1 bite and we were done. The garlic potato salad was good as well, but VERY garlicky.

We would go back in the summer to try the brunch, and hopefully that changes my mind."

It always was on a Sunday for the brunch.  The first two times, several years ago, were much better food-wise than our two more recent visits.  But the special room we reserved upstairs made the privacy of the second settings much better (even though you have to manage stairs with full plates of buffet food.)  I remember the quality of the food at the buffet being better when we dined earlier than later during the brunch.  The last time we were there, we reserved the last seating of the day and ended up with luke-warm food, and choosing our food from the buffet with the staff finishing their shift.  Many of the fruits were never refilled by the time we were seated, and none of the deserts listed on the table cards were left.  For the price paid, we were disappointed but would go back earlier in the day next time and hope for better again."

Their chicken is delicious. Crispy outside, tender and juicy inside. They pressure cook the chicken first and then flash fry. The bean salad, pickled beets and corn fritters are my favorite sides. Always fresh, always well-made. This is just perfect Sunday night or Sunday picnic food. All I need is a red checkered tablecloth!

The chicken.  Really?  It&#39;s the best chicken you&#39;ve ever eaten?  Really.  Because it&#39;s just chicken, dunked in flour and deep fried.  No flavor but oil.  No herbs or spices.  Just dripping oil.

The good: 
-Polite and patient teenagers working the counter.
-The prep time was also very good - I waited only about 4 minutes, which I spent reading the Chicago Tribune front page announcing the death of Pres Roosevelt posted inside.
-All crispiness held up well despite a good 20-min lag between fryer-exit and mouth-entry.
-The fries were both crispy and tasty.
-Thigh pieces were nicely cooked.

The bad:
-SALT - my two dining companions and I felt the salt was a bit much - maybe they over-brined their chicken before frying? But then again, even the corn fritters were salty beneath their sugar coating... 
-The wings were way overcooked. 
-Paper sack with no handles - I was fortunate not to have grease leak through onto my clothes as I cuddled the bag, but that was definitely a possiblity.

The eh:
-About average greasiness compared to other fried chicken.
-Corn fritters were only ok; they definitely got hyped up by the other reviewers. Thought they could&#39;ve used more corn/corn flavor too.
-Mashed potatoes and kidney bean salad - the former was a bit thin, the latter a bit too mayo-y, but both were still edible and served as a temporary reprieve from salty meat. 
-Cole slaw - I didn&#39;t have any, but my friend didn&#39;t complain or rave, so I assume it was only ok too.

Not sure I&#39;d go back on account of the salt alone - I spent the rest of the day chugging water and trying to get my BP back down."

Nostalgia dies hard.  White Fence Farm chicken was one of my favorite places for fried chicken.  I&#39;ve been eating it since the &#39;60s, heck, my first job in high school was working at the carry-out on the west side of Joliet.

So imagine my disappointment when my order this evening was scrawny and dry.   I opened the box upon getting in the car, and noticed that the chicken pieces were rather small, not how I remembered..  The bone of the drumstick was exposed, which was another indication that the size of the portion would not be ample.

I drove home and then sampled the chicken.  It was dry.  Not just the white meat, but the dark meat, too.  The skin and coating were crispy, like a potato chip, as well as a little on the dark side.  That indicated that the chicken was overcooked, and perhaps the grease needed to be cleaned.  

I did not order any sides, even though I was tempted to get an order of fritters, so I can&#39;t offer an opinion on those items.  (When I worked at WFF, I used to bring home the leftovers from the last batch.  I think I put on ten pounds in about three months.)

The woman working the counter was, shall I say, &#34;efficient.&#34;  It looked as if she had a frustrating day.  Perhaps she had some complaints about the quality of the chicken.

Anyway, I hope this was just an anomoly, and not the norm.  If I want mediocre chicken, there&#39;s lots of places closer to my home that serve it up."

We were having people over for the Fourth of July and I decided it would be nice to have chicken from here.  It had been a long time since we&#39;ve had it because it&#39;s not exactly close by but since it was the holiday, it seemed like a good idea.  They had a special going on where you would get 20 pieces of chicken (five legs, five thighs, five wings and five breasts) and two dozen fritters so I got that.  When I got home, I ended up with only two breasts and three extra wings.  All the wings and legs were really small and looked like they came from some pretty scrawny chickens.  What a let down not to mention an embarrassment since I had been going on about this to my family.  While the fritters were outstanding as usual, you can only do so much with them.  I feel like I&#39;ve been gypped since I didn&#39;t get what was advertised, wasn&#39;t told about the substitution and the pieces had hardly any meat on them.

We ordered the special (2 hotdogs, small fry, and a small drink) and the gyros combo.  Gyros were indulgent and satisfying.  Probably this place has the best crinkle cut french fries.  It&#39;s your typical fast food place.

Tucked in the corner right across from Total Hockey, it&#39;s rather small but good enough seating for you to just eat quickly and leave.  Adequate seating outside for sure.

I love the Vienna hotdogs done the Chicago way and the fries are fantastic.  If you looking for something other than a hotdog I recommend the Italian sausage. If you still can&#39;t decide there&#39;s always a daily special. I love the hotdogs so much I&#39;ve used had them catered for parties. The service is excellent!

They have really good prices and used to give you very generous portions. This time around was like going to a completely different place. My gyro meat was burnt and the pitas were so hard that they were inedible. The beefs I ordered were so small that I thought they gave us hotdogs by mistake. Then, to top it off, I ordered 3 orders of fries and only received 2. I know that sometimes we all have a bad experience somewhere, but this experience was so bad that I will surely never spend my money here again.

Service: 3 young boys were running the place, they were so polite and respectful and did a great job getting food made up in a good time and just so nice.

Gyros: Pretty good Gyro, as good as a typical good gyro is.  

Fries: Meh, they are your typical, nothing special fries.  They were crispy enough.

Onion Rings: Sadly slightly over cooked, but not burnt, just harder than they should have been.  the onions tasted good though.

Not a bad place to go for a heart attack :) Def better for take out than to eat in unless there&#39;s only a few of you and don&#39;t mind stools.

What do I mean by Chicago-style comfort food?  I mean those all-beef hotdogs loaded with relish, sport peppers, tomatoes, mustard (NEVER ketchup, are ya crazy?), onions, and a generous shake of celery salt. I mean layers upon layers of seasoned, thinly-sliced beef, shaved so thin you can almost see through them, piled upon the softest Italian bread and topped with green peppers. I mean piles of succulent gyro meat, served with warm pita and tangy tzatziki sauce.

Mmmph. 

Service is quick, everything is made to order and usually ready in five or ten minutes. There&#39;s a wraparound counter along two of the windows with chairs, old school style, if you&#39;re eating in. Prices are cheap (even cheaper if you take advantage of the check-in offer for their hotdogs) and their soda machine is one of the only places around that still carries Green River."

The inside of the restaurant is small with a few tables set up inside and a couple outside.

In visiting Cozzi Corner I decided to try the hot dog which came with fries. It came on a nice soft poppy seed bun. There was no pickle the dog but it did come with some fairly thick tomato slices. It came with some of the largest sport peppers I&#39;ve ever seen on a hot dog of width comparable to the sausage itself. The application of the mustard, onion and pickle was solid and the dog itself was skinless. It was a little haphazardly put together as the peppers and tomato slices were all on one side of the dog and had to be evenly distributed before eating. The overall flavor was decent.

The dog also came wrapped with fries, these were fairly typical thick cut fries. They were a little greasy and not particularly crispy but weren&#39;t bad.

Overall my hot dog fared about average here at Cozzi Corner. One bonus note is that they have Green River soda in their soda fountain. Overall this is a solid but not outstanding representation of a Chicago style hot dog."
cozzi-corner-hot-dogs-beef-and-catering-downers-grove,Patrick S.,sFftDUTf2FiLo6O6feXZ3w,"Downers Grove, IL",0,1,1,15,419,YqnON3zs_K9ypGzvsNx4LQ,4.0,2014-07-10,"decided to check this place out for lunch.  mostly due to Yelp offering a pretty generous coupon and i had yet to try the food here.  i&#39;m a fan of greasy hotdog/Italian beef/sausage/whatever else places, so why not?!

Cozzi&#39;s is located in a pretty rundown strip mall type area off of 75th, but they&#39;ve managed to keep their building looking nice on both the outside and the inside.

i brought in my coupon and told the guy working the counter about it before i ordered, since i felt it&#39;s rude to just present a coupon right when i&#39;m going to pay.  he seemed really confused, because i guess no one has brought in a coupon for their establishment before?  after a couple of minutes of deciding how to ring me up, he finally figured it out.  it was nice that he wasn&#39;t rude or anything.  i appreciated him figuring out a way to accommodate me even though he wasn&#39;t familiar with the coupon.

their prices are really reasonable, so it was actually a little difficult to order $10 worth of food just for myself, but i managed to do it.  haha
i ordered their beef and sausage combo sandwich with sweet peppers and cheese, a small cheese fry, and a large drink.  while waiting for my order, i grabbed my drink in their self serve fountain.  Green River on tap!!  no way?!  i now love this place!!  of course i went straight for the Green River and filled up my cup.  my order was ready pretty much as soon as i was finished getting my drink, which was very nice.

first i attacked the fries.  they were standard medium cut fries typically found at hotdog stands.   nothing out of the ordinary, but not bad either.  the cheese was also the standard cheese topping you&#39;d expect.

my beef and sausage sandwich was a nice size.  definitely didn&#39;t skimp on the amount of beef or sausage on the roll.  the beef wasn&#39;t too flavorful.  i&#39;ve had better seasoned beef and i&#39;ve had worse bland beef too.  this was somewhere in the middle.  the sausage, on the other hand, had a real nice bite to it!  i really enjoyed that portion of my sandwich.  nice spiciness without being overwhelmingly spicy.  real full Italian sausage flavor.  next time i&#39;m probably going to skip the beef and just order the sausage.  my sandwich was lacking in the cheese department as i almost wondered if they forgot to put the cheese on there at all...oh wait, i found it.  the peppers were neither sweet nor cooked properly.  i&#39;d prefer them to be cooked a little more thoroughly and be a little more on the sweeter side.  oh well, they were still edible.

all in all, this place is worth checking out.  i&#39;d pick this place over Teddy&#39;s Red Hots any day!"

I love when you find a hot dog place outside of Chicago that uses Rosens buns and Vienna hotdogs...the real deal Chicago styel hot dog.  So, I of course, had a hot dog and fries.  It was great.  My only complaint is that I could tell that the oil they used for the fries needed to be changed.  

The b/f and Pops got gyros plates.  They are HUGE, definitely worth the $7 you pay.  It comes with a insane amount of gyros meat, 2 full pitas and tzatziki sauce galore.  I most definitely had to try some and it was very good.  

This place is reasonably priced and has great hot dog stand kind of food and good portions.  Just note that the fries that come with your hot dog are wrapped up with it, so it&#39;s not as big of a portion as comes with the gyros and other items.  

Also, it should be noted that they have daily $4.99 specials.  I always love a good deal."

Wendy has always been friendly, and her staff are courteous, very fast taking, and delivering orders. The food is consistent and tasty, although the Italian Beef is lacking something, not sure what it is. I AM the Italian beef connoisseur, junkie, and call it my favorite fast food. I will usually order something else, and have to be careful because I am deathly allergic to onions. I was a little disappointed last summer (in 2012) when they were giving away Kronos gyros, because they were slathered with onions. 

Wendy hosts and supports one of the best Tuesday evening classic car shows during the summer months, and a mid-winter banquet which is second to none. I look forward to attending, and believe this is something that demonstrates that Cozzi Corner cares about their customers, and the community.

We ended up driving through the parking lot where Cozzi Corner was located. 

Hmmm I have not had an Italian beef with mozz in a long time and some fries. 

As I/we walked in I noticed we were the only two customers at that time. It was after 7pm I believe and a week night so no big deal. One thing that gets me (especially since I work in the hospitality field) is not getting ANY kind of greeting. How hard is it to say hello or how are you this evening when people enter the building?? Manners people. 

The beef was not terrible but I have had better and my fries were a little cold. Maybe it was an off night and maybe I will give them another try but not anytime soon. Besides I don&#39;t eat Italian beefs THAT often. 

I think my sandwich with cheese and a fry was around 7 bucks and change. I guess  that is not too bad. You can sit in there and eat if you want too. They do have tables/stools."

I&#39;m partial to their hotdogs and with every hot dog order you get fries. That&#39;s something that you don&#39;t see anymore. Usually places jack you for anything where everything is ala carte. I favor this place over portillos which is saying alot since Portillos has the never ceasing cars wrapped around the drive thru. The only thing I have to point out is the fact that every time I get a hot dog from Cozzi the person who prepares them feels it necessary that they leave their kung fu grip on the bun. Every time!!!! Come on guys I know I&#39;m eating a hot dog that has been handled you don&#39;t have to leave your hand print on the dang thing. If I was a psychic I could almost read the guys palm just by looking at the bun. Not cool.

The waitress (who I think was the owner or at least manager) was friendly and accommodating. She seated us even though only 6 of us were there, and got the drink order stared.

The sushi was fresh and delicious. There was a good variety to choose from, and both combo and ala cart options. My sushi was great, and I liked that even the &#34;crunchy&#34; rolls were subtle on the crunch. (Healthier and more delicate with the flavor of the fish, showing their confidence in quality.) My wife doesn&#39;t eat fish, so she usually hates going for sushi with me, because the options without fish are few and usually lousy. She (and two others) had the stir fry. My wife had chicken or pork, and the others had shrimp. My wife said the stir fry was excellent. I think that means I have a better chance of getting sushi more often, so win-win!

20oz Sopporos went down pretty good too. A good kick off for a new year."

It&#39;s not the most beautiful restaurant, but the people are very nice, and the sushi chef knows what he&#39;s doing. He always recommends good pieces when I ask what&#39;s freshest. I always try sushi places myself before I let my kids eat it, and this place easily makes the grade. We usually share sashimi and a couple rolls. Fish and veg are fresh."

Started off with teriyaki mushrooms, which were divine. I&#39;m very picky about my teriyaki sauce, so that&#39;s saying something. 

My mother ordered the chicken teriyaki. She said it was good; I tried some of her veggies and they were at that perfect point where they weren&#39;t overcooked but still a little raw. 

My father and I shared four rolls (Dragon, Moshi Moshi, Traffic, and one other). They were all great and the fish tasted fresh. I wish this place had some more contemporary, &#34;fusion&#34; rolls like those trendy bars downtown Chicago have. I&#39;m sure they would have been fantastic. 

Unlike other reviewers, I didn&#39;t find the spicy rolls (we ordered one) to be too hot, and I am a weakling when it comes to spice. 

Moshi Moshi is definitely worth a try. It gets four stars because while everything was delicious, it wasn&#39;t out of this world. I&#39;m a tough reviewer I guess."

It&#39;s quaint (small) but the staff is always friendly. Last time I was there, I left my wallet and the waitress chased me down the street to return it to me. --I appreciated that!

The first sushi spot I walked past was huge and I prefer small bars, so when I saw Moshi Moshi I popped in, despite the fact it was empty. I ordered nigiri: hamachi, tai, saba, amaebi and sake. The salmon was excellent, the yellowtail and mackerel good and the snapper and shrimp were rather flavorless - but not bad, just not much going on. The chef served me single pieces, which is nice. The fish selection is limited, but they don&#39;t get pre-cut fish, which I have seen in &#34;land locked&#34; areas. I had tempura to finish and while the portion was nice, the dipping sauce was in an awkwardly small bowl and taste was so-so. The service was pleasant and price was reasonable.

The service wasn&#39;t that great... the ladies were trying to be nice but came off as rough. Also, my fiance and I are an interracial couple and we went with another interracial couple of the same race. The server first gave us the other couple&#39;s appetizers. Then she was about to give us their meal but the other couple said &#34;that goes over here&#34; and then she made eye contact with him, acknowledged him, and then put the food in front of my fiance and me. ??? We had to tell her again that it was their food, not ours, and then she finally put it over on their side of the table.

Now for the food... saparro was good.

Moshi Moshi Special Roll- It was okay... it was a hot temperature roll. I&#39;m not a fan of those. If it was cold, I thought it&#39;d be good.

I forget what this roll was called and it&#39;s not on their menu online... but it had cream cheese and pink soy paper around it. It was like $13. Anyway, it was pretty good!

Philadelphia Roll- Good, hard to go wrong with this classic.

Spicy Tuna Roll- I&#39;ve never had a spicy tuna roll that was actually spicy. This one was way too spicy for me! But I can&#39;t handle any type of spicy. The people who could actually handle spicy said it wasn&#39;t spicy but it was more spicy than at other places.

Overall, even with the not up to par service, the food was of pretty good quality which is why it gets 4 stars.

Second time I came was just ok.

I got a philadelphia roll (good), traffic (would be good without the crispy), and futo (ok). My girlfriend really liked the American Dream which I agree was pretty good. This place wasn&#39;t very busy when we came around 7:00pm on a Friday night. It was empty by the time we left. The server was super nice. $26 after tip."

All you Kiku lovers need to get out of your tiny boxes and get into Moshi. Their menu is very traditional when it comes to the modern Americanized sushi restaurant, which isn&#39;t a bad thing when you get seafood this fresh in suburbia. 

I have been here countless times in the past 10 years, but I felt inclined to compose this review because of the service received. My girlfriend and I were literally the only people in the restaurant... Probably because they were closing in 20 minutes....
But, we were greeted with a smile and prompt service. We felt kind of bad since we got there around closing time so we tipped heavily and walked our satisfied stomachs out of there with a grin from ear to ear. 

Moshi Moshi is the best Japanese restaurant in the Chicago suburbs. Excellent seafood and service."

Since it was a Saturday, I called and got a reservation for the four of us. Upon arrival, I was a bit concerned because there was only one other table with people.  It is a small restaurant, about 20 tops total, so was worried why no one else would be there on a Saturday night.

We ordered saki and it was par for the course of average saki but I was there for the sushi.  Being the fat, gluttonness American I am :) I order my 3 favorite individual rolls (Unagi, Ikura, and Masago) along with 3 other larger portion rolls.  The others in the group ordered a mix of sushi and entrees (one was an all in one meal on a tray; a few pieces of sushi, noodle dish, wontons, and a few other pieces and according to the purchaser, it was really good).

The meals came out at different times which isn&#39;t good service but the sushi was great.  All my individual rolls were great and the wasabi was the freshest I have had in a long time (I think my nose is still burning).  

While I was worried about the lack of patrons, the place had great sushi and I would recommend it if you&#39;re in the area."

We ordered two rolls, ten pieces of sushi, and two small Sappiros and the bill was $60 to give you an idea of pricing. 

The spicy scallop was outrageous and appropriately full of kick. The hamachi, white tuna, and the maguro were all great on their own. We could have just ordered more of that but we wanted to try some rolls as well. The rolls were good, one was one of their crab rolls and the other was an eel combo.

She calls you by name and is quick to tell you what&#39;s fresh and more importantly what&#39;s not.

I have watched the food quality go right down the toliet and fast. The last two times I&#39;ve eaten here, I was served subpar fish, yelled at, and charged for it. Just returning from my final visit tonight, I was served stringy sticky hamachi that I refused to eat in fear of getting ill. When I told the server (wife of the owner) she brought it to the attention of her husband the sushi chef who proceeded to explode in a barrage of loud Korean ramblings in front of customers. I was then told that the fish was in fact the rare belly (fatty) cut from the hamachi and that I must be ignorant to the fact that I was getting something special rather than poor quality fish. Being a classically trained chef, I started to retort, but then just gave up and said okay. Needless to say I was charged for the food I didn&#39;t eat and was not only embarrassed but embarrassed for them most of all. Any place that serves stringy nasty fish then yells at the patron when they&#39;re called out on it, needs to sit back and reflect on their business practices and customer relations. This place is not cheap and their food is no longer good. I know it&#39;s been a long cold winter but by cutting corners and abusing regular customers, you&#39;re headed for a disaster.

The food is terrific, and the spicy tuna roll is the spiciest I&#39;ve had (make sure your waiter/waitress knows to bring lots of water!), but the service runs the range. I&#39;ve had people who get the food out quickly and then make sure to check on their tables every few minutes, but I&#39;ve also dealt with understaffed weeknights where the food took forever and I didn&#39;t see the waitress again for a solid hour. Keep in mind that the servers also help the kitchen staff and make the sushi, so things slow down significantly during the dinner rush.

In other words, Moshi Moshi is a great restaurant to hit on a Friday or Saturday night when you don&#39;t have a reservation and are okay with hanging out and gabbing with friends and family for a little bit. But if you&#39;re in a hurry, you might want to go elsewhere."

Everything was enjoyable, but none of the rolls seemed super-special like you can find at other, fancier places. 

The lowdown: 
We got an appetizer of gyoza, which were pan-fried and larger and flatter than most I&#39;ve had. I thought they were delicious; my boyfriend wished for more filling. 

Sashimi: 
The best: Escolar (white tuna) and maguro (tuna). Sake (salmon) and kani (advertised as crab, but looked like krab) weren&#39;t as special. 
*Of note: Most sushi places I&#39;ve gone to give you two pieces per order, so Moshi Moshi&#39;s menu looks cheap, but remember that you are only getting one piece!

Makimono: 
Spider (soft shell crab and cucumber)
Salmon skin (grilled salmon skin and cucumber)
Spicy Scallop (scallop w/ spicy sauce)
Moshi Moshi (crab, shrimp and spicy mayo)
All were enjoyable, but compared to what we&#39;d had at Wild Tuna a while back, just not as exciting. 

If you like your sushi raw, stick to the sashimi, because a lot of the rolls are marked as having a cooked element. 

Service was friendly and totally on top of refilling my boyfriend&#39;s tea (though I had to ask for water a few times). Ladies&#39; room could have been tidier. 

Overall, an enjoyable if slightly bare-bones sushi experience.  Say &#34;Hello!&#34; to Moshi Moshi the next time you&#39;re in Naperville."

Man did this place deliver. Sure it&#39;s a tiny store front and the décor looks like it&#39;s from the mid 90&#39;s, but the fish is flavorful and fresh. I highly recommend the American dream, moshi moshi and the crazy roll as well as the mussel appetizer. Like a few others have mentioned, the spicy tuna is insanely spicy. Seriously. I love heat, but I had to down two-three glasses of water to get through the roll.

The only negatives are:
1. They tend to go a bit heavy on the ginger dressing on the salads, but it&#39;s easily remedied by asking for it on the side.

2. On a few occasions, they have had Disney songs playing in the background, which adds for an odd but hilarious atmosphere.

Rice was undercooked and dry. Was absolutely deserted today when I went for lunch. A minor but odd inconvenience was a tiny v-shapped-bottom soy sauce dish, which made it hard to dip my unevenly-cut sushi rolls.

I spent the same that I would have at sushi house but over there the quality and freshness is superior."

Some person walks in, waitress immediately gives him soup. Here my friend and I are waiting to be be helped. Finally she comes after we raise our hands like school kids. 

To the point.

Sushi was good. I got the Moshi Moshi. My friend the spider roll. I also tried the chicken teriayki with rice which was stir fry and rice. something I could of easily made or got at Panda Express, if it&#39;s American style Chinese food you want. 

Not to mention my water was contaminated with these brown particles at the bottom of my cup. No more ordering water, it&#39;s probably from the sink.

I won&#39;t ever go back."

Doesn&#39;t look like much from the streets of &#34;fancy&#34; Naperville, but this place holds its own.  We ended up at Moshi Moshi for dinner on Saturday night after sitting at a table at another, fancier, sushi place down the street for waaay too long without so much as a nod from the staff.  Disgusted, we walked off, and into Moshi Moshi.  

We were greeted and seated immediately.  Our waitress didn&#39;t speak English well but was very friendly and hospitable anyway.  We began with sake, Kirin, and shrimp shumai.  We received our drinks quickly but never received the shumai.  We&#39;re not sure she understood we were asking for it but when we asked again she smiled brightly and brought the appetizer 5 minutes later.  No harm no foul.  And the shrimp was a nice variation on the typical pork shumai offering at my usual sushi haunt.

The prices weren&#39;t too bad ($5 for standard california, $12 for rainbow) and the sushi was good.  My maguro nigiri was generous, flavorful and fresh.  I like when sushi places coat the rolls in sesame seeds or masago as opposed to just dabbing a few here and there.  Moshi Moshi doesn&#39;t skimp.

We sat and talked long after our food was gone, slowly draining the sake.  We weren&#39;t rushed out, which I appreciate.  The bathroom was utilitarian at best... the ladies&#39; room houses cleaning supplies and a vacuum.  I guess you could say the bathrooms aren&#39;t any fancier than the rest of the restaurant but they do the trick.

Overall, we had a positive experience.  I&#39;d go back before long before I&#39;d so much as glance at the presumptuous joint down the road that has lower prices, is always packed, but treats you terribly."

Moshi Moshi is nestled into the heart of Naperville in a small shoebox of a space, perfectly sized for a handful of tables and a sushi bar.  We were quickly seated and received excellent service there forward.  We ordered several rolls and found our order came out without a long wait.  While nothing particularly revolutionary about the sushi, it was pretty darn tasty.  I left feeling full of yummy goodness.

I&#39;ve been searching the suburbs for a good sushi place. I&#39;d go to a new place and it would be good once or twice, but indubitably the food would fall off or it would start to be hit or miss if I went on a regular basis. It&#39;s looking like Moshi Moshi is going to be my go-to sushi place from now on. The sushi I had, spicy tuna and moshi moshi rolls, was fresh and perfectly seasoned. There was real flavor in the fish! The spicy sauce is H-O-T! And the rice was cooked just right. I had the veggie tempura too, and it was great. I wish I&#39;d had more broccoli, but I&#39;m a broccoli lover so I won&#39;t hold that against them. Even the tea, which is like a lemon green tea, was delish.

As we wanted to find some decently healthy food that we could take back to her place and catch up over, and as it was cold out and miso soup sounded lovely, we sought out this sushi place. Imagine my surprise to find great veggie sushi in the middle of Illinois! 

We walked in to order, and the lady who took our take out order was very nice! Lots of smiles and asking how our weekend was. She guided us through the menu and waited patiently while we ordered (way too much). 20 minutes later we walked in to find our order stacked up and ready to take out. Great! 

Now to the food. The sushi itself was perfect! Rice was not dry at all - nice consistency, and not overcooked - and the various veggie rolls I got were delicious. My friend enjoyed one of her non-veggie ones (the other was spicy and she didn&#39;t know it -- but that was her fault not the restaurants!). Finally the miso soup was great - more tofu than normal (which I love) and lots of that great miso taste. 

It was a tad pricey ($20 each) but I do believe we over-ordered, so with that in consideration, it&#39;s quite reasonable. Would definitely recommend and hope I get the chance to go back!"

I have been here a few times and have had their tuna, fresh and smoked salmon, and eel - and a couple of rolls.  The food was OK.  I didn&#39;t get sick, but I don&#39;t think the fish was fresh.  It did not have the same texture of freshly-cut fresh fish.  I would not be surprised if it was cut, frozen, and then defrosted for serving.  

Service was average - about as good as you get at you local dry-cleaners.

 If you order take out, don&#39;t expect it to be ready on time.  My fiancee and I order sushi at 7pm on a Friday evening. When they said it would be an hour I wasn&#39;t suprised given that they are usually pretty busy. When I showed up at 8pm they hadn&#39;t even started my order! I think it was lost but when I inquired about still placing the order they said they would put it in at the end of the line so it would be about another 45 minutes. The lady actually had the audacity to tell me that all the people in the restaurant had put their orders in first! I was floored! Needless to say, I told her that was the worst customer service philosophy I had ever heard and that if they treated people that way they would surely go out of business soon.

superb service!"
aris-kitchen-north-aurora,Ryan B.,4z_fa3OYaBLAgQgTx_wk8w,"Naperville, IL",1,1,1,66,1,ceKTET-WuF-0n1ZoMcMS8w,5.0,2016-06-21,"Ari&#39;s Kitchen is that rare experience where every aspect  makes it profoundly different from dime a dozen breakfast spots on every corner. Do yourself a favor and take a road trip to this hidden treasure and be prepared for a foodie experience well worth writing about!!!

This little sits in an unassuming location, a basic strip mall in North Aurora. For however modest it appears on the outside, it plays amongst the champion food experiences on the inside.

Greeted by Ari himself, you&#39;ll quickly find yourself immersed into his world as you sit down and begin pouring over the menu. While options of all sorts greet you, the menu is actually simplistic at the foundation level and then you make it uniquely your own with the sides and add-ons.

What is apparent is how much of the menu is homemade, made from scratch right there. Fresh ingredients galore spread across the rest of it with huge portion sizes ready to grace you with their presence. 

There is also that unique feel that the environment creates. You feel at home. I always get a feeling of just wanting to sit and relax for well over an hour. I rarely get that anywhere in my life because I&#39;m high strung. Here I&#39;m made to feel welcome, wanted, and encouraged to stay. It is eating in your uncle&#39;s kitchen!

What to Eat
1. The Foundational Experience: Mr. Steak Omelette with hashbrowns, Home Made Pumpkin Pancakes, and sausage 
2. The Adventure Experience: Egg Mountain (minus ham) with HomeMade Pumpkin Pancakes
3. The Unexpected: Breakfast Burrito | HomeMade Cinnamon Apple Oatmeal with HomeMade Biscuit
4. The Kids/Picky Ones: Home Made Pumpkin Pancakes

First Timers
1. Seat yourself
2. You have all you need at your table
3. Fancy views, menus, and servers are not the experience. Exceptional recipes, personalized orders, and fresh ingredients served with efficiency and care.
4. Ari wants to get to know you. He will meet you and talk with you. If (and you will) return, he will remember you!
5. Specials are just that... great ideas for you. These are not &#34;we need to use up ingredients so let&#39;s call it our special&#34;

Tips
1. Portion sizes are huge
2. Go with the HomeMade pieces on menu (H.M.)
3. FirstTimer: Ask Ari for a recommendation. He takes his time and will really work you through a custom experience
4. Get a table starter! For example, get an order of H.M. pumpkin pancakes for the table to share as an appetizer
5. HomeMade biscuits come with homemade jams - tremendous tasting experience!
6. Breakfast is so good that it is easy to forget they do lunch
7. The &#34;Combo&#34; is a great way to experience Ari&#39;s for the first time as is &#34;Comfort Food&#34;
8. Best way to navigate the menu is to realize almost all options are the same so it is the foundational piece you need to start with. In other words, nearly everything has eggs, griddle, and meat but you can start your build from an omelette or skillet or you could start with pancakes or French toast :-)

Thanks Ari for being the best breakfast spot in the Chicago burbs!"

I recommend it to anyone looking for delicious food and a fun atmosphere. Plus it&#39;s not every day a restaurant gives you a to-go cup for your coffee.

Ari&#39;s  = God of Breakfast

200 reviews for a family-owned, &#39;morning meal&#39;-type spot is generally a sign of positive word-of-mouth.  I came here one day of my own accord, but had someone told me about Ari&#39;s, I&#39;d now be thanking them.

Located on Randall Rd in North Aurora, Ari&#39;s Kitchen shares a small strip mall with a doggy spa, veterinarian, nail salon, and gyro place.  It&#39;s very unassuming from the outside, but inside it&#39;s a beehive of activity.  So busy in fact, that I decided on dining &#39;al fresco&#39; during a very mild bit of weather on a Sunday morning in late February.

The chairs outside were pretty damn uncomfortable, but each table had hot sauce on it, so that&#39;s something.  Menus appeared to have been designed on a Commodore Amiga 500 and printed on an Epson dot matrix (formatting was wonky and typefont looked dated).  A few minor errors, smudged ink from waterglass condensation, why Ari&#39;s doesn&#39;t laminate their stuff, I have no idea.

Our server was quick to greet us and had lots of charisma.  All of the servers looked like hipsters (which normally I would hate), but they managed to pull it off.  Every waiter/waitress wore a spiffy hat and took orders on their phones, an interesting twist.  Shortly after getting our orders in, we were given a bowl of fresh fruit &#34;on the house&#34;.  Apparently, instead of providing the industry standard bread &amp; butter to customers, Ari&#39;s prefers to dole out Dole!  (hehe fruit pun)  I neglected to take a photo, stupid me.

Unsurprisingly, Caty D ate all the good stuff like banana wheels and juicy melon balls, leaving me with a funky, fuzzy 1/4 kiwi and some weird ass blackberries.  I really liked the idea of  fresh fruit as &#39;a petit dejeuner&#39;; it&#39;s something I&#39;ve never seen done before in a restaurant.

Once the food arrived there was even less to complain about.  My combo featured eggs sunny-side, homemade hashbrowns, a single large pancake......and 5 slices of extra crispy bacon.  FIVE.  For those of you counting at home, that&#39;s more than double what most breakfast joints offer--some may serve as many as 3, but that&#39;s usually pushing it.

If I&#39;m being honest, the homemade hashbrowns weren&#39;t my cup of tea.  This was mostly due to the prevalence of raw onions and large, chunky potatoes.  The green peppers were nice, but I much prefer thinly shredded &#34;hash&#34; browns over breakfast potatoes, as these were definitely of the latter variety.

Don&#39;t ask me why, but Caty D ordered some monstrosity called &#39;Egg Mountain&#39;.  It was pretty much everything I got, but smothered in biscuit gravy.  Came with a defibrillator on the side.

Bread = 4.5
Circuses = 4.5

Tasty food, friendly service, lots of choices.  In the realm of getting value for your money, Ari&#39;s simply destroys the competition.  Highly recommend."

I like that they have hot coffee already at each table and all the condiments at reach. We had California skillet small portion with side of pumpkin bread and country biscuits and gravy with over easy eggs.  The California skillet was good but the pumpkin bread way to sweet. My biscuits and gravy dish was so so, because the biscuits were over baked and brunt on the bottom. The portions are pretty big needless say leftovers happened."

We were here for a late brunch on a Sunday and they were packed.  Despite the short wait, we got seated pretty quickly because the staff were working their butts off.  Everyone was wearing cowboy hats for some reason and there were beach umbrellas inside?  Let&#39;s just say the decor is quirky.

The breakfast stuff looked amazing, but we were feeling lunch.  My husband and I went halfsies on the meatloaf sandwich and the chicken club.  Both completely hit the spot, but I definitely want to go back for some of the egg dishes.

This is definitely not a fancy expensive brunch spot in the city.  It&#39;s definitely more homey food, which I totally appreciated.  The meatloaf sandwich in particular reminded me of something my grandmother would have made.  

In a sea of chain restaurants and standardized choices, this place really stands out."

Most places don&#39;t do scrambles unless you ask them to  because it&#39;s off the menu. Well, it is  on Ari&#39;s menu, and you can choose 2 or 4 eggs, so you don&#39;t have to take home 1/2 your breakfast if you can&#39;t eat those big 3-egg omelets at other places.   There are so many choices that I haven&#39;t been able to scratch the surface of all that I can pick from for breakfast at this place.  And the food is always tasty!   For example, the  fruit is  fresh, varied (not all melon) and plentiful.  Finish it off with home made jellies and a pot of coffee on the table, and you have my kind of place that I could go to every day."

Was seated quickly and greeted by Ari himself! I don&#39;t often find myself greeted by the establishments namesake. He offered us the menus, gave us recommendations and came back with our drinks.

The food was amazing!!!

I had the Irish skillet and the corned beef was amazing!!! The homemade biscuits and marmalades were also delicious!

Ari chatted us up and was very attentive to anything we needed. I really felt like I was a guest in his home rather than a restaurant.

I had a great experience and the food was soooo good!

Can&#39;t wait to come back!"

If you get a sandwich combo it comes with a side AND soup or salad.  If you get soup with your sandwich it is a BIG bowl of soup!  The salad was a good size as well, I was just surprised for the soup it wasn&#39;t just a little cup like you get at most places.  I like that Ari&#39;s has many half-sandwich options as well that come with soup or salad, too.  Both our sandwiches were very good &amp; they do not skimp on the fillings, either."

I&#39;m certainly in love with the lunch items especially the chicken sandwich and onion rings. The soups are amazing I&#39;ve had both the cream of broccoli and the chicken noodle although my personal favorite is the chicken noodle. The homemade onion rings were awesome, and the double deep fried chicken sandwich out of this world. Ari&#39;s customer service is superior. I&#39;m not excited about the pancakes or chicken as a breakfast meat and the onions in the breakfast potatoes were overwhelming"

I will say I was a bit skeptical that the raving reviews from Yelp were accurate when I walked in and saw a tiny place with quirky decor and waitresses in sailor hats... (And I&#39;m still puzzled as to how that all fits in with the restaurant theme!!). 

But the food and service were AMAZING. I ordered something which I believe was called the Most Popular or something like that, a combo of eggs, a bread and a side. My eggs were so fluffy and flavorful, the homemade biscuit was so buttery and flaky my mouth is watering now just at the thought of it, and my Greek yogurt was so fresh and natural tasting, it was all remarkably satisfying. I also tried the pumpkin bread which was decent but not my favorite. My mom also tried the hash browns which she loved and Ari later came by to offer her some more &#34;on the house&#34;, which was certainly welcome!!! Our waitress also went out of her way to ask my mom if she&#39;d like a to-go cup full of coffee, which was very much appreciated!! We were stuffed and still taking some leftovers home, all for the nice price of $20.

We felt like valued customers at Ari&#39;s Kitchen, and will certainly go out of our way to return."

Ari&#39;s is awesome. Nothing fancy - and it doesn&#39;t need to be. The food is tasty, hot and fresh, Ari is awesome, and all the servers are friendly.

The water came with a cucumber slice. You know, like a spa, except breakfast. After the night I had, I needed hydration. Slammed it. I don&#39;t even like cucumbers, but I love cucumber water for some reason. And this was exactly what I didn&#39;t even know I wanted. 

I tried the Swedish pancakes previously (with lingonberries and a canister of whipped cream, which comes with the pancake accoutrement and is left at the table) and today I had the breakfast panini. Omg. I wasn&#39;t actually THAT hungry and I had to stop myself from devouring the entire thing. It was that good. A panini with pesto mayo, bacon, sausage, cheese and an egg. It&#39;s kind of a miracle my arteries cooperated long enough to let me draft a review. But that being said, I&#39;m totally ordering it again next time. 

Side note: They were super packed today and breakfast was taking a bit longer than usual - so Ari came over (unprompted!) with a bowl of fruit salad (watermelon, honeydew, blueberries, banana, strawberries, etc) and kept the child happy. This was just a cool move, and even though we&#39;ve been here a couple of times now, that turned us into regulars. What a way to take care of your customers. 

Ok, back to the food. Husband and child love the biscuits and gravy here. And they are picky about biscuits and gravy. The biscuits actually have flavor, and the gravy is solid (as in awesome, folks.)  

They encourage substitutions so you can enjoy exactly what you want. Most of them are for no extra charge. They don&#39;t rush you out. There&#39;s a pepper grinder on every table. (A real one... not one of those cheap grocery store two-pack dealios.) And did I mention they bring an entire can of whipped cream to the table for pancakes? Yes? Telling you again. Because awesome. Happiest kid ever with that one.

We found this place thanks to Yelp so I&#39;m paying it forward - because even if it gets more crowded due to all the Yelp love, it&#39;s still worth the wait."

The outer aesthetics are very unassuming and I couldn&#39;t find a website or menu, so I was skeptical to spend my hard earned/precious lunch break at Ari&#39;s. However, I relied upon my fellow Yelper&#39;s reviews and was pleasantly. Oh, and I found the menu in their Facebook page.

The wonderful Ari, greeted us and was our server. He is really awesome! The inside is rather quaint, but space is optimized pretty well. However, it gets pretty crowded during peak weekend brunch hours, so be prepared.

As for the food, my husband ordered breakfast and I ordered from the lunch menu. We had the best of both worlds and it everything was really good. Each item deserves an individual description:

Pancakes: They&#39;re HUGE (almost as big as the plate) and fluffy/tender. Might be at the top of the
list for good pancakes around here.

Hash browns: Delicious! I usually like the shredded hash browns, these are not shredded and I love them! They are homemade, kinda chunky and cooked perfectly. You can add toppings like onions and peppers as well.

Corned beef hash:Best hash around here....again, made in house from scratch.

Chicken fingers &amp; fries: Yummy! So, the chicken fingers are very different from typical pre-frozen fingers your get from a restaurant. These are straight up homemade fingers, so there is no thick breading. They&#39;re lightly floured and seasoned....what I prefer. The fries are fresh cut and yummy as well.

Soups: we had potato soup and Ari gave us a free bowl of chicken tortilla soup to try. Both tasted great. I usually don&#39;t get tortilla soup, but I would definitely buy it when I go to Ari&#39;s. It&#39;s really good!

So, there you go.....just visit Ari&#39;s if you&#39;re in the area and looking for a not typical, real food option."

Aris kitchen has this magic homemade feel to it, since well everything is homemade! The jams are so good, corned beef hash is amazing. Hashbrowns with peppers and onions are really huge potato chunks. I have tried most of the breakfast menu and half the lunch menu and have not had one thing I did not like. Ever. 

Ari&#39;s is known for breakfast but the lunch is also amazing. The onion rings are fresh and homemade, none of the crap from a freezer that everyone has. It gives them a light and slightly crispy taste, you will love them! The fries are perfect and hot every time. My favorite thing on the menu is the pup-perozzi sandwich, a fancy two cheese grilled cheese with tomatoes, bacon and avocado. The burgers are huge and yummy too.

Please note... it is small and people dinning in take first priority to to-go orders, as it should be. If your order can not be made fast or perfect ari will turn down a to-go order to make sure the people dinning in get great service. I love that! 

Last week when we met friends at another breakfast place closer to them my husband whispered that I was cheating on ari since I love him so much! Trust me ari,... nothing is as good as your food."

Very comfortable feel and quaint decor. Few issues that are easily improved upon would be to keep it cleaner. Got here on Sunday about 1PM and definitely needed some table, chair amd floor cleaning. Also, the owner Ari was not very friendly...perhaps he was overwhelmed as it seemed he was the one serving and bussing? Easy fixes and I might try again nit you do het better service and cleaner environment at Double Yold off of Butterfield."

Looks can definitely be deceiving, but the quality meals that are served from the friendliest people (including Ari himself) here, are priceless. I read all of the great reviews on Yelp and as a Aurora resident I was psyched to check this place out.

My husband and I came in for breakfast on a Thursday morning. Ari&#39;s Kitchen is a pretty small restaurant, although the do have seating outside in the warmer months. There were about 3 or 4 other tables occupied in the restaurant when we were in. 

I immediately loved the homey feel of Ari&#39;s. The coffee mugs were all different, which reminded me of the collection I have at my house. The menus made me do a double take, because they are actually old hard covered cook books with the Ari&#39;s menu pasted inside. Quirky and clever - I like it.

As for the food, everything looked and sounded amazing so it was hard to choose. I finally decided on the California Dreamin&#39; benedict. Anything with avocado typically wins me over, and boy it did. This benny was awesome! 

I chose fruit and my side and let me tell you, &#34;side&#34; is a loose term, but I&#39;m not complaining! The amount of fresh fruit that came with my Benedict was insane! I&#39;m talking a whole banana was included alongside apples, grapes, dried fruit, pears - the works.

Other bonuses of this magnificent breakfast adventure? Cucumber water. Pitchers of fresh cucumber water are served at the table. Love it. Also, Ari will more often than not be your server! I think that is so cool and of course he has all of the knowledge of his own restaurant and what they offer. Ari is super friendly and is literally the definition of amazing customer service.

The hype is real folks, the hype is real. I can&#39;t wait to go back to explore the rest of their menu!"

Kid free, we decided to treat ourselves to a nice brunch and I couldn&#39;t wait to give this place a try. It was a Tuesday around 11:00am and it the place wasn&#39;t that busy. Most of the tables were taken but it is a relatively small place. We went through the menu looking at what to feast upon. A quick minute later we were greeted by Ari himself. Ari is the heart of this place, and you can tell how much he stands behind his baby. He welcomed us and went over a few things on the menu that we might be interested in. Everything sounded so good and after a few more minutes we finally placed our order.

My wife went with a breakfast panini that was loaded with bacon, sausage patty, over easy egg, cheddar cheese, and sourdough bread. She got a side of fruit which is beyond generous. She loved the sandwich. It was enough to feed both of us, and honestly, I have never seen a side of fruit with such variety and portion! I went with the biscuits and gravy. It came with a side of hash browns. Ari asked if I wanted green peppers and onions added to the hash browns, uh yeah! Everything was decedent. It was so fresh and you could taste that it was all made from scratch (which Ari confirmed). My plate was loaded with 5 fresh from scratch biscuits drowning in a thick country gravy that was perfectly seasoned. 

This has set my expectations to a whole new level when it comes to brunch food. Honestly, unless I physically am unable to make it to this place, I won&#39;t be going anywhere else!"

The ambiance is super busy and fun with loud, upbeat music and umbrella tables inside.  Ari is very funny and personable.  The food is amazing!  When another reviewer said bring your appetite they weren&#39;t kidding!  

I ordered the combo with scrambled eggs, crispy bacon and pumpkin pancakes.  Everything was home made and delicious.  You wouldn&#39;t think that scrambled eggs would be different from place to place but these tasted super fresh.  The pumpkin pancakes were delicious!  They give you three large, fluffy, rustic-looking pancakes with cinnamon butter and warm syrup.  They even bring you a can of whipped cream!  

My husband ordered scrambled eggs and corned beef hash which was home made and fantastic.  He also had toast that came with home made orange marmalade and home made strawberry jam.  My husband isn&#39;t a huge breakfast fan but he loved this and can&#39;t wait to come back.

While you are waiting for your food Ari brings you a bowl of fresh fruit mixed with dried dates and figs.  Very nice touch!

I came here with my family today 02/27/16 and this was our 2nd visit. On our 1st visit we didn&#39;t have any issues but the prices were alot lower than they are now. 

My wife and two kids were extremely hungry and I ordered a banquet skillet the small portion for $8.39. I knew it said small portion but the regular portion was $10.29 and didn&#39;t feel like paying that for a breakfast meal. When my food was brought to the table, I thought they made a mistake, my breakfast was literally packed in what looked like a cup of soup bowl.

I&#39;m not joking when I say this but I finished my entire meal in 3 bites, that is how much food was given to me for $8.39. My wife decided on the half order of bucuits and gravy combo, which came with one biscuit, one egg and a very small portion of hash browns. Her meal was $6.39 and the biscuit wasn&#39;t even covered in gravy and she wasn&#39;t even filled. 

The kids wanted the pancakes combo which was a very large portion of pancakes but the bacon came out over cooked and the hash browns were such a small portion and there meal was $10.29. I think the food here has great flavor and they cook with care but the owner needs to learn how to portion the food accordingly to price. I spent almost $40 dollars on breakfast and my family walked out still hungry because of the portion sizes. I could of went to a steakhouse and stuffed myself for the price I spent here. 

The owner needs to stop letting the review get to his head and focus on his customers and portions. He must be making a ton of money off idiots that continue to spend $11 for a plate of nothing. America wake up and stop letting restaurants like this rip us off. If you want a good breakfast go to Oswego family restaurant, they have great prices and the portions are just right."

Ari&#39;s isn&#39;t that easy to get to, but when you walk in, you&#39;ll most likely find Ari talking to customers. The place is very small, only about 14 tables, but it definitely has that quaint family-run feel to it.  You&#39;ll most likely find Ari taking the orders himself, serving up food, as it appears he has only two other staff--a chef and someone who appears to be a daughter or granddaughter. 

Because of its size and small staff, the place isn&#39;t very tidy--there was a tower of condiments either on or next to each table, which made it feel somewhat claustrophobic, and the floor was in need of some serious sweeping--crumbs everywhere. The tables were filthy, as were the cluttered menus. It suffers from a lack of spacial organization, due to its small size, and clearly needs to be reorganized.

Since it was my first visit, I was given fresh fruit on the house. Although my bowl wasn&#39;t that fresh at all (the pineapple looked like it had been sitting out for 3 days. I was there around noon on a Wednesday. 

I ordered the combo, which consists of your choice of a bread (waffle, French toast, Swedish, regular or pumpkin pancakes); a side (eggs or hashbrowns); and a meat. I got the regular pancakes, homemade sausage patties, and the homemade hashbrowns. The pancakes were huge-almost as big as my upper torso-but fluffy. I can honestly say that these are among the best pancakes I&#39;ve ever eaten, and I&#39;ve tried a lot. The sausage was clearly homemade and a huge portion. It was a little on the salty side and there was something amiss about the flavor--almost artificial. I asked about the spices, and although they are &#34;a secret,&#34; Ari told me that there is a combo of seven different spices that they use. The hashbrowns were not has towns at all. They were made from a baked potato smashed (skin and all) and fried up with a little bit of pepper. Clearly authentic, but very bland. 

I didn&#39;t get to try their lunch options, but I did get a glimpse of their giant onion rings, soups, and sandwiches from other patrons. For the food, I give it 3.5-4 stars. But due to the clutter, dirty tables and menus, and lack of a clean floor, I knock off one star."

We stopped in for brunch, which started with a good cup of coffee.  I had the California Skillet with avocado, bacon, tomato, and mozzarella.  I also had the Rye toast with their homemade raspberry jam.  The orange marmalade was good too.

Ari&#39;s is a small place with a big menu; omelets, benedicts, pancakes, skillets, burgers, wraps - I&#39;m sure you can&#39;t go wrong.

Ari himself is jovial and friendly, constantly stopping to check on his customers.  He offered extras to everyone - extra coffee, extra potatoes, extra jam...whatever you needed.  I like the funky, mismatched coffee mugs here too, but those aren&#39;t for sale."

A refreshing high-quality eggs and potato breakfast. Ari himself served me, has a witty and easy going sense of humor, and immediately recognized me as a non-regular. 

All food is home-spun with a flair for the tasty. I had low expectations for finding a restaurant in Chicago&#39;s suburbs. Ari&#39;s totally over-performed and was absolutely wonderful. 

Ari recognized that his menu is huge and extensive. He also recommended a smaller portion size for a fella wearing form-fitting clothes who is somewhat overweight (me). I love that Ari did this; the smaller portion was exactly what I needed to prevent a food coma before my Monday work day. 

This location is a hole in the wall place; but the food is high quality. Once inside the restaurant, it is tastefully decorated and simple and clean. It has a homely feel with a tilt to the eccentric personality that Ari brings. 

Five stars for such a pleasant surprise in Aurora, IL!"

The owner comes around to see if you have been there before and, if you have not, then pretty much explains the menu, how things are made and makes recommendations.

The food is exceptional and very plentiful. Made to order. Very crowded weekend mornings. We were there on a Sunday and hit the sweet spot so didn&#39;t have to wait.

Highly recommended."

Ari&#39;s Kitchen proved this point once again!  SCORE!!  We were headed to the Aurora Outlet Mall and wanted to try something different for breakfast.  I read through a few reviews, ran a map and we were on our way to Ari&#39;s.  The map did cause some confusion with an unnecessary u-turn, but we saw Ari&#39;s up ahead and ended up ignoring the GPS at that point.

We walked up and saw a few tables set for dining on sidewalk.  It was nice to know that this was an option.  When we opened the door, we were immediately greeted by a server and allowed to sit wherever we wanted.  At the table, we found cookbooks (that confused the heck out of my husband and son!), but since I had read ahead a little, I knew that I would find the menu inside.  Ah, the menu...it is vast!  And loaded with information.  We wanted to try everything.  It took us quite a while to make our decisions and when we finally did, here&#39;s what we tried:

Homemade breakfast sausage patty - This was a fan favorite and we would come back based on this alone!

Mashed potatoes - I loved these!  They were obviously made with loving care as they had a few little lumps, but were so fresh and delicious.  An excellent choice if I do say so myself.

Farmer&#39;s Skillet (I think) - Served over a healthy serving of hand cut hash brown potatoes, every bite of this disappeared.  This was easily a successful dish.

Pancake (just one as a side, but look at the size of that thing!) - Huge!  Obviously not a box-mix or some pre-made boring batter.  This reminded me of my mom&#39;s kitchen, but it was from Ari&#39;s Kitchen and it was delightful.

Sausage gravy &amp; biscuits - Share this, or get a half order.  This was waaaay too much food, but the fresh biscuits were fantastic and the gravy was a winner.

Poached eggs &amp; a side of hash browns - Eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash browns arrived with a cup of gravy (like you would imagine with mashed potatoes).  These large chunk of fresh potatoes were so good that I had to snag a bite or two until my husband mixed the eggs in of course.

Turkey sandwich on white bread - While the turkey was obviously roasted and cut right off the bone recently, the sandwich was completely cold.  I had not thought this through at all.  I expected toast even though the menu didn&#39;t stay toast, so that&#39;s my fault for not asking for toast.  The turkey had definitely been chilled in the fridge, but I think I would have enjoyed it more if it were hot instead.  The quality was there, but I was the goofball imagining things the menu did not say.

Side salad - I chose the salad instead of the soup (surprisingly) because I wasn&#39;t thrilled at the soup options.  The salad was quite large and served nice and cold.  The dressing was good and the cucumbers/tomatoes were fresh.  The lettuce wasn&#39;t very thrilling - it&#39;s lettuce and it worked, but this was probably the only thing that hit the table that wasn&#39;t great.  

The glasses were kept full, the restaurant was clean and had an open kitchen concept.  We met Ari right away and he&#39;s a really nice guy who&#39;s hustling and bustling to make sure everything is up to par.  For a Monday morning, the crowd was very diverse and there were plenty of customers to keep them on their toes.  I cannot imagine a weekend morning here, but seeing as we don&#39;t often have the opportunity for a weekday breakfast and we loved it so much, I think we will find out what a weekend morning looks like soon!

The parking lot is shared with a few other businesses including a drive-thru.  Don&#39;t accidentally try to go the wrong way down the one way drive thru lane.  Basically, you can only go out the same way you came in.  So keep that in mind. 

Bottom line... Ari&#39;s Kitchen was awesome!  Virtually everything tasted fresh, the service was impeccable and the food seemed like it was straight from my mama&#39;s house.  Check out this local gem!"

We ate there for the first time yesterday.  Ari greeted us and is a very nice guy, but honestly, the food is not that good.  Our meal came with a house salad.  The lettuce on top was green, but after two bites, I found the remainder of the bowl contained brown, watery, wilted lettuce.  My tuna melt was average. Both and iced tea and water tasted funny.  Within a few hours of leaving the restaurant, I became ill.  When I eat out, I hope to eat food that is better than I can make at home and that doesn&#39;t make me ill.  This was not the case yesterday.  Maybe his breakfast foods are better, but I&#39;ll never go back to find out."

Ari will kill you with kindness basically because he never gives up. He works overtime for your hospitality vote.

ARI will dazzle you with conversation until your head spins.This place is out of control with the comfort and comfy presentation that soon wears thin..

The egg scramblers and omelets are basically the same. Scrambled eggs should be lite, fluffy &amp; buttery. My Scrambler was a spitting image of a dried out overcooked Omelet. However, serve a fresh fruit cup with a crisp blueberry...let the dazzle begin!

Ari is simply a magician in cooks clothing, and I believe that combination is mesmerizing and deceptive, because that&#39;s what magicians do!

The best thing about this kitchen is the Pepper Grinder sitting silently on your table."

    When we first walked in we noticed that it was a lot smaller than we expected, but it had a small country diner feel to it. The hostess was really sweet and we felt welcomed to be there. They do have waiters but Ari, who is the owner, is the only one who takes orders and he is the only one who takes the bill which was a bit unusual.
   When Ari came to take our order he was friendly but my girlfriend felt that he was rushing her a bit. I can see why she felt that way. He was very straight forward and fast in taking orders. I liked it, but when you go to a homestyle type of restaurant then you expect your waiter to not be so quick paced. 
    I ordered the biscuits and gravy with homemade hashbrowns and my girlfriend ordered the veggie skillet with scrambled eggs with toast and a side of grits. My biscuits and gravy were very good. You can tell they treat the biscuits and gravy as a main dish and not just a side dish. The hashbrowns were unbelievably good and I would definitely recommend them to anyone going there. They are perfectly seasoned and are cooked in onions and green peppers. 
   As for my girlfriend&#39;s food it seemed to be just the opposite. Her skillet was full of vegetables  but they were not seasoned and tasted bland. Also the presentation was not the strongest. Over the veggies they threw on a slice of cheese, it wasn&#39;t shredded. It was just a lice thrown on top of the veggies. I tried the grits and it was awful. The grits were watery, flavorless and just really bad. 
    Overall it was a tale of two cities. My food was good and my girlfriend&#39;s was pretty bad so it was an average experience. I read that Ari comes around and talks with everyone and is really friendly, but to us he made us feel a bit rushed. Maybe it&#39;s become so popular that he doesn&#39;t have that extra time he had when he first started. I personally would recommend the hash browns if you are there for breakfast."

Pumpkin pancakes (side item) are so good I don&#39;t even need syrup on them, the Cuban sandwich is delicious, and don&#39;t get me started on the fresh soups....

Next time I need to be in Aurora I think I&#39;ll get there early so I can stop at Ari&#39;s to try their corned beef hash (really the only way to rate a diner like this).

Well we pull off and look for a place. It took some time but once yelp showed us this place we decided to give it a go. And I for one am very happy we did.

Ari is an extremely nice guy who made us feel like regulars right away. After he took our order he asked us if we ever tried his soups. When we said that this was our first time in, he decided to give us cups of two different of his soups. I was very impressed with the soups. The minestrone was full of vegetables and was just plain good. My wife tried the chicken noodle and she was also very happy with her selection.

We decided to split a Greek salad and a grilled cheese with bacon, avocado, and tomato. The salad was huge with a nice whole chicken breast on top. I really wouldn&#39;t change anything on the salad at all. The grilled cheese could have used a little more bacon (but knowing me I would say that about anything). But other than that it was great (gooey cheese, butter fried bread, soft avocados, and salty crispy bacon....).

This is really a quality place out in Aurora"

I remembered someone telling me how great this little joint was. So off we went to Ari&#39;s. 
We arrived at around 10 and there were 2 groups ahead of us. The place is so tiny there really isn&#39;t anywhere to stand and wait. It was chilly out so waiting outside was not an option for me. We waited around 15 min to be seated. We were offered menus to look over while we uncomfortably stood next to the other people waiting. 
We were seated at a booth which I was glad for because I noticed that the tables are all very close  together and in some cases you could end up sharing your table with strangers. The place itself is cute, nothing fancy at all, very cozy and no frills. The waitstaff was all teens and the person taking the orders is the owner himself, Ari. 
We were brought over glasses of ice water with cucumber, very nice touch, I love cucumber water.  I also ordered coffee which was very much needed and it was nice and strong. 
We waited about 10 minutes for the owner to finally make his way to us and take our order. I went with the chilaquiles with chorizo. My son got the brunch burger which came with a fried egg and bacon and home made fries. My two little ones got the Mickey Mouse pancake. My daughters and I got our meals at the same time but my son had to wait about 5 minutes later to get his meal. My chilaquiles were served with a side of sour cream and they deposited a huge jug of fresh salsa. For my daughters they served the pancake with a can of whip cream. 
Eating out meal was a bit tricky because our table was so small that our plates and glasses hardly fit. I had to pile plates on top of the condiment tray so that we had enough room. 
My meal was good, very flavorful, the chorizo was good and the salsa have it a yummy touch. My girls were happy with their choice. The big winner was my son, his brunch burger looked AMAZING!!! He is a burger fanatic and he was quite impressed with this burger. 
The food was ok, portions were big, I didn&#39;t like that there is no waiting area, the restaurant is a bit congested and having to wait around for the owner to go around every table, taking orders and payments made our time spent there a bit on the long side. After I packed up my left overs we waited about 10 minutes for Ari to come back to our table to take our payment. 
Overall, I really wasn&#39;t impressed, not with the service or the food. I think that I will give them a try one more time but I will go for lunch. There were a few things on the menu that sounded very appealing to me."

If he could, I&#39;m sure he would give it 10 stars. They make the corned beef hash, jams, sausages, and more by scratch. He and my daughter are particularly fond of the corned beef hash. Ari is always friendly and takes the food orders personally. It is nice to have the owner put such a personal touch into their establishment. The wait staff is on the ball and is always there when you need something. The decor is eclectic and homey. Since it is on the small side, there does tend to be a line for this little breakfast place, but my family seems to think the wait is worth it and I have to say that the turnover is quick. 

Today the kids had the Mickey Mouse pancakes, which did not look like Mickey, but were &#34;awesome&#34; and &#34;tasty&#34; according to them. I had the pumpkin pancakes and sausage. Both were good and there was more than enough. My husband had the hobo skillet, which he loved as usual. The prices were good for what we got. We paid less than $40 for a family of 4 with drinks and sides and we had leftovers for later.

Me and the small group went last weekend. We had to wait about 15 minutes which was fine because it seemed as though the staff was turning the tables pretty quickly. They were very welcoming and friendly when we arrived and we took a look at a menu while we waited.

There are a lot of options to choose from. Everything looked as though it was prepared there. I can&#39;t go so far as to say anything was stand out. I ordered an omelette and my friends ordered skillets or regular breakfast items. I will say that I thought the hollandaise on my friends eggs Benedict was pretty good. I&#39;m pretty picky about my sauces.

Again, everything was fine. Good. Just not great and not very memorable. The prices were average and I would view it as an OK value for my money. I probably wouldn&#39;t choose to go back here over other places that leave me remembering something that stood out.

The bathrooms were clean. You can see into the kitchen area and everything was pretty spotless even though they were fairly busy."

Another bonus- Ari, the owner, is a funny, intelligent, warm, and generous host. His love for feeding customers good food is evident and we felt welcomed. The restaurant is a humble and homey place in a strip mall. And Ari&#39;s heart for his business is the hearth of this place!"

I&#39;m not sure, maybe it was his Ma&#39;s recipie. Anywho, it was fantastically yummy. Good for lunchtime, although I saw many guests had ordered the breakfast items which looked just as good! If I&#39;m ever back around the area I&#39;ll definitely dine here again!"

A tiny store front off of Randall hides the best breakfast around. Seriously, how is this place not PACKED? First of all, the place is a bit cluttered, looks like a ol&#39; home town breakfast diner. Though, they greet you as if you&#39;re a regular. 

The B&amp;G is outta control. The biscuits have flavor, as opposed to other breakfast joints who give you nothing to savor. The gravy........aww yiss. I got the FARMERS BENEDICT. The sausage patty, wow, really really tasty.
The skillets were slightly small, in comparison to  other places. But to make up for this, Ari himself gave us an extra pancake on the house. A truly nice, welcoming owner. 
The coffee was great. They leave it on your table to drink to your hearts content. 

A lovely breakfast. I will return!"

The food was delicious--many homemade options, service was fast and courteous. We were even offered coffee to go! Ari took our order, brought our our food and collected payment.

Waitstaff was attentive and pleasant and quick. The food was perfectly seasoned with a big variety of items and options. Fresh fruit bowl was complimentary and delicious. Coffee was perfect, not burned or bitter. Ari completed out order and asked how we wanted our bacon. Love the personal touch.  I had a one egg skillet which I was excited to see on the menu as most skillets are way too big. It came with a side and a choice of bread. Homemade pumpkin bread! Need I say more? We will definitely come back!!"

$ 7.00 burger.  Cooked medium, juicy, no char spots.  As perfect a burger as I had at American Wildburger and as good as Boston Blackie, Charley Beinlich&#39;s and the Lantern in Lake Forest.  

Get the $ 7.00 burger.  He serves it eight ways, and you may request a ninth."

I saw a review that said their portions were small, but that person&#39;s nuts. The portions are great. I&#39;ve gotten half orders and walked away stuffed! 

My only complaint would be that Ari should stop taking all the orders himself. It&#39;s admirable that he wants to take all the orders and deliver your bill, but when he&#39;s busy it can take a while for him to get to you. Just let one waiter take orders, that&#39;s it! It would make all the difference in the world! The food is so good though, I&#39;ll keep coming back. Seriously though, if Ari reads this, just one waiter. Let someone help! Please! It would make the dining experience a lot more enjoyable."

We found it! Ari&#39;s Kitchen is amazing. Ari is such a great person and very friendly. His staff is attentive and the food is so fresh and tasty. If is such a change of pace to find a place that makes food with high quality ingredients and then allows you to taste the amazing flavors by not over salting it. 
There are so many great touches to this place- all condiments are on the table including hot sauce, if you order coffee you get a freshly brewed carafe so you can refill any time with flavored cream at the ready and a wait staff that caters to your every need. He even has fun with the specials menu as evidence of this past weekend&#39;s &#34;SAMCRO&#34; specials as a tribute to the Sons of Anarchy TV Show.
The soups are to die for, and if you are lucky you will be there on the stuffed pepper soup day, the food is so fresh- I have been partial to the skillets  and the fabulous cubano sandwich but have not found a klinker in on the menu yet. I&#39;m not a big pancake guy, but the pumpkin pancakes have made a believer out of me- you don&#39;t even need the freshly made cinnamon butter that comes with it.
Everything is freshly made including the bbq sauce which is fabulous on the shredded pork, he makes his own jellies and uses Oberweis dairy products and fresh Gonnella bread. Even the fries are freshly cut and made to your order and he refuses to over salt things.
The only thing negative I could say is that the menu does take a bit to get used to. But after a couple times, you know just where to find what you are looking for.
We have been there many times in the past few weeks and is a great place to grab a quick lunch as well as a great Sunday breakfast. The prices are reasonable for the amount and high quality food you get. 
We expect a line or to wait. I haven&#39;t figured out why waiting for great food upsets people so much. That is a sign of a great place to eat if people are willing to stand in line for it. You shouldn&#39;t penalize a restaurant for serving high quality food. All the 5 star reviews don&#39;t lie-
Did I mention this place was amazing???? 
Ari, Keep up the great work and don&#39;t ever compromise! You&#39;ve got a great thing going!"

The place is very dirty everywhere &amp; why is the owner Ari the only one who takes the order &amp; the only one who can work the cash register when it is quite busy. The food was not exceptional as everyone rates. It was just ok. Maybe it&#39;s me &amp; because it was my first visit.

It&#39;s a very small dining room in a non-descript strip center. It&#39;s seating for about 40 people.You seat yourself. 
Service was exceptional. Everyone works as a team. They switch off cleaning tables, seating guests and serving food. The owner
Ari, took our order on his i phone.
The food is abundant and fresh. I loved the fruit side plate. It had no exaggeration- 12 different fruits. The hash browns were great also. The menu is typical breakfast fare but done very well! You can see the details and the pride exudes in so many unexpected ways. Read the entire menu and you&#39;ll understand what I mean.
One small tidbit- Ari guarantees that if you&#39;re still hungry after your entree, he will bring out more food- free. 
You feel like you&#39;re an invited guest in his home kitchen.
I&#39;ll leave the secrets for your visit.
Worth the drive.

Not only because the food is delicious but also because the customer service is wonderful. Ari always greets you with a warm welcome and is eager to feed you some phenomenal food. I have a gluten allergy and I was thrilled to know that they have Gluten Free options upon request. They custom made a Gluten Free Monte Cristo which I must say is the best Monte Cristo I have ever had. My boyfriend ordered the Farmer&#39;s Benedict and he said it was so good and the portion was HUGE! We also split the California Omlette and it was equally delicious and didn&#39;t have all the grease that sometimes you find on omelettes. Did I mention that all the jellies for the toast are made from scratch? This is a must go place for anyone who enjoys a delicious meal with a great ambience. And to all my Gluten Free buddies, this is definitely a place for you as you will get tasty food without the gluten. :)"

My three breakfast feasts to date have been perfect. I look forward to a lunch and some soup soon.

I stumbled across this location on a whim and had bookmarked it as an alternate to Harner&#39;s... not that I don&#39;t still love them too. I just love supporting #shopsmall. 

I see continued success for Ari &amp; crew and look forward to alfresco dinning once again. You&#39;ll never leave here still hungry!"

The food was great -- large portions, fresh, large menu. During our short wait they came around with small homemade Greek yogurt parfaits which were really tasty. My husband was contemplating soup and sandwich because it was a chilly day and soup sound good. He decided on breakfast but was still thinking about the soup. Amazingly a few minutes later while waiting for our food, out came two samples of their homemade soups were delivered. Both were very yummy. 

I had an omelette with a pumpkin pancake as my &#34;bread&#34; and the fruit bowl as my side. As the person at our home who is always cutting the fruit, I appreciate the large serving and wide variety of fruit. We will definitely be back."

They do lunch and breakfast items and I got tye Ranchero burger which had a massive hamburger patty that was cooked to med/rare perfection, juicy, well seasoned and flavorful. It also came with thin slices of jalapeno, avacado, tomato, salsa, mozz amd lettuce on a fresh bun. The whole thing needed a tent peg to hold it together and it was about 5 inches tall! Huge!  I also got a side of grilled asparagus, which was a really nice touch. You coyld also get broccoli or hash browns or of course fries.  
My wife got the Farmer&#39;s Benedict which was super rich with large housemade bisquits, sausage patty, poached egg and coutry gravy sauce, served with home fries.

Ari waited on us and he has a terrific personality and very friendly demeanor.  The bathrooms were well kept and clean. Food came out at a timely fashion and most things on the menu look home made, from the roast turkey, to bisquits, and sauces and jams. All was fairly priced, too!  Wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see this place on a certain chef guy&#39;s diner and dives show, as they do it right with personality"

We yelped a place to eat and we were not disappointed.  The owner is a character - funny, personable, involved.  He&#39;s part of the charm of this quaint little place.  We arrived on a Saturday at lunchtime.  The place was packed.  We waited about 5 minutes for a table.  Their menu is a bit difficult to navigate for a newbie - so many options and  Everything looked good.  Hubby had their pumpkin pancakes as a side, and thats about all i remember because it was amazing!  I had the chicken and fries - Both excellent!  I also had the wedge and didn&#39;t love it.  It was fair...but for a couple of bucks, it was fine. Kiddo had their pancakes and had his own bottle of whipped cream for $2! We had tons of food and for 3 people, the bill after tax was $25.  Who does that nowadays???  I&#39;m still in shock.  Well worth the visit and thanks to Yelp, found another hidden gem!"

I don&#39;t mind the crowd so much as they do my favorite meal of soup and sandwich better then any other place in this neighborhood.

The key to good soup and sandwich starts with the soup.  They make their soups fresh every day.  They are so good, and I think I remember the menu saying they stay away from corn starch.  Which is excellent in my book.

Speaking of books, their menus are all inside cook books.  The first couple of pages they tape or glue a menu in them.  Very creative.

Their menu is a little hard for somebody like me with ADD to get through.  As I&#39;m sure sure how it&#39;s really laid out.

And I guess my only big gripe about this place is they don&#39;t have a website with an online menu.  I can&#39;t go their for lunch during the week for this reason.

I only get a half an hour and by the time I&#39;d go their look over that menu, place an order, wait for the food to be done it&#39;s already over my time.

I noticed they sometimes put the soups on their FaceBook page, but to me that&#39;s not a great option as I don&#39;t wanna be busted checking out FaceBook at work.

The service here is great.  They might get a little frazzled when busy but who doesn&#39;t."

It seems to be new, since I&#39;m pretty sure it was something different less than a year ago. 
Ari was our waiter, and apparently the owner as well.
The setup inside is small, and has a country type feel. However, if you can &#34;not judge a book by it&#39;s cover&#34; then you can genuinely appreciate this restaurant. It&#39;s not set up like a 5 star restaurant, but the low cost, customer service, and delicious food make up for it.
I honestly don&#39;t know if we&#39;ve had better service. Anywhere. We&#39;ve had $100 meals where the service wasn&#39;t as good as the service we received here.
First of all, my breakfast was $4.95. 2 eggs, delicious homemade hash browns, and raisin toast. My fiancé had 2 eggs, bacon, and french toast for $7.95. Very cheap!
And, it was delicious. The eggs were buttery and fantastic. They also make their own butter and various jams.
There are stencils on the wall that say things like &#34;We don&#39;t own a microwave&#34; or &#34;we don&#39;t use added salt&#34; which is a little odd. That being said, you can tell they take pride in their food. It is a great home cooked meal. 

Also, when we had finished our meal, he asked if we were full and had enough. He asked us if we wanted refills...on our food! It was crazy for us to be so welcomed and we felt that was a grand gesture that he really wanted to make the customers happy. 

I definitely recommend anyone to visit here!"

The best Biscuits and Gravy I have ever had. This is a cozy small restaurant with 25 tables. A nice plate of fresh fruit including pineapple, plumbs, apples, bananas and dates.

Where the magic really happens is when Ari come&#39;s in person to take your order. He is as pleasant and warming as the food he serves.

The most organized, precise, consistent and systematic restaurant I have ever seen.
Ari&#39;s does not have a microwave, only uses real whipped butter, and will change your mind with how you look at breakfast.

Ari is a observer who see&#39;s all and a great judge of character. He knows just what to do to make your experience the best experience as he read&#39;s people well.

This is important and why his food is so great, Ari understands people and knows what people like.

We&#39;ve never been to Ari&#39;s kitchen before, but the reviews peaked my interest. It was seat yourself, which was a little confusing at first, but was fine. It&#39;s a smaller place, but still plenty of room at the table. The menus were a little confusing, but we&#39;re understandable. 
   Now to why I gave them five stars. Ari himself took our order and when he found out it was our first time there, he comped our biscuits and gravy and my wife&#39;s cup of soup.
   I had an omelette and hash browns with a pancake. The wife had an omelette with a generous fresh bowl of fruit and an English muffin. The food was very good and a good sized portion. It also came out very fast and was more than reasonably priced.
   I would definitely recommend trying it. It was a wonderful dining experience."

I&#39;m always bias as it relates to barbecue and the south-side of Chicago but I must admit I drive past this place for the last 6 months going and coming from work one of my co-workers suggested I try the place out.

Drum roll please, and rib tips that were simply mouth watering and succulently cooked to the very tender taste I left full and please at my new Crest Hill hangout.

I believe when I came the place was called Firewater BBQ and Brew and I remember thinking what brew?  They had nothing on tap and only like 4 bottles in fridge.  Anyway that seems to have changed but my review hasn&#39;t.  

I&#39;ve eaten BBQ all across the south so maybe my criteria is a little to Russian judge like for the Midwest but I gotta keeps it realz!!!!  I had a 2 meat combo plate which I always get at BBQ places so I can taste a variety.  I got he brisket and pulled pork.  The brisket was fatty, flavorless and greasy.  I honestly got more fat than meat. It appeared to be boiled not smoked but there is wood all over the place so I doubt that&#39;s the case.  The pulled pork was also flavorless but with a little bit of their sauce it was ok.  The sauce is on the sweeter side but not bad.  The beans as a side were pretty damn good.  They had pieces of meat and apple in them which is a great idea.  I wished I would have just gotten a big ass bowl of the beans instead.

I may have gotten here on a bad day or the young server gave me the shitty end of the brisket but it wasn&#39;t very good to me.  Judging by the other reviews that seems to be the case."

The night we were there it was LOUD. There was a single guy playing country covers with the volume cranked to 11.

Between my wife and I, we ordered two sandwiches. I had brisket and my wife had pulled pork. We got Mac and Cheese, beans, and cornbread as sides.

The brisket was dry. I mean DRY. The pulled pork was pretty good, but nothing to write home about.  The sides were unremarkable - not bad, but just not great. The sauce choices also fell in the same boat - not terrible, but just kind of there. The beer selection was pretty good for a restaurant like this - note that all beer is served in bottles or cans, no drafts.

It&#39;s sad that the BBQ scene around Joliet is so lackluster. I really was hoping to like this place, but it&#39;s just not there. I&#39;ve had BBQ a lot of places and this place just gets lost in the crowd of mediocre BBQ joints. I likely won&#39;t be back for a long time - for the price that BBQ commands, I&#39;ll drive another 15 minutes and get great BBQ."

I tried the pulled pork and beef brisket, both were tender, juicy and delicious. My other half had the chicken and it too was very good. (I&#39;m glad he likes to share!) we tried a few sides, Mac and cheese, beans, and garlic fries. All were very good. 
They have 5 different types of BBQ sauce, the one I liked best was the Alabama White. You can purchase the sauces as well. 
The service was fast and the staff friendly. 
The inside is clean and decorated on point for a BBQ restaurant, with picnic style benches, concrete floors and firewood racks. 
They also have catering available.

The service is horrible.
The ribs are dry and full of fat.
The sauce bottles on the table are more water than sauce.
The cobbler is only brown sugars chunks, no fruit.
The manager is extremely rude.

This was a first and last experience for my boyfriend and I. He ordered a full slab combo and 8 wings. I ordered 4 wings and 4 rib tips. The baby back ribs were burned. The rib tips were full of fat. When I told the manager of our bad food, he looked at me like I was bothering him. Every food item that was disgusting that I told him of, he argued that he made it himself. When we were ordering he was moving boxes in the back. He did not give his name, but he was Caucasian with glasses.

Food on the floor, dirty tables, and staff was just hanging out in the back. I ordered the two meat with brisket and chicken. My husband ordered the three meat with wings, brisket, and chicken. My brisket was half fat. It was so gross. The chicken was decent but I have had better. I didn&#39;t taste any of the smoke flavor other people have said they did in their reviews. I had Cajun fries as a side and they were decent. My husband did like the wings but same sentiment on the chicken and brisket. Overall it&#39;s &#34;meh&#34;. 

We have been all through the south for BBQ and this place does not stack up to any of them. The piles of wood were a nice touch but when there really is no smoke flavor you have to wonder what it&#39;s for. The past reviews tell me maybe we hit it on an off day.

Well, my favorite meat enthusiast and I sated that desire this week-end by going to the Red White &amp; BBQ Festival in Westmont. Lots of choices of all kinds of meats, yet we both picked Firewater, for their selection and the wicked smells that lured us from their booth...

He got rib tips, and I ordered a couple of ribs and a pulled pork sandwich to take home. Damn, dat smoky goodness. Ribs had that almost leathery exterior that gives way to tender flesh. I combined their spicy and &#34;Sweet Home Chicago&#34; sauces for a smooth note with a kick. The pulled pork revived perfectly the next day, the flavor rich and complex: pork, smoke, spice and sauce. (Watch out for some bone bits as you inhale it, though.)

The dude got the rib tips, which he said were tasty, but it looked like there was more meat than there was because of the fat and bone (rib tips are mostly cartilage). Quote: &#34;I&#39;m just not used to that weirdness of gristle. I&#39;m not an experienced rib tipper.&#34; Still, he said he&#39;d eat there again. 

With a location in Crest Hill and one in Lombard, you&#39;ve got your pick on either side of town. So then next time you&#39;re fired up for BBQ, head over to Firewater and quench the flame."

The restaurant is clean and the staff members were all very friendly, greeting us immediately as we entered. The menu is posted at the front of the restaurant above the cash registers on large chalkboards. I ordered the pulled chicken and beef brisket with a side order of fries. The pulled chicken and French fries were delicious! The brisket wasn&#39;t that great. It seemed to lack flavor and it was very dry. I ordered the salt and pepper fries and they were crispy and cooked to perfection plus, the order was large enough to share with another person. I&#39;d imagine that the garlic and Cajun seasoned fries are delicious as well. 

The person I went with had a huge order of ribs, rib tips, smoked chicken wings and a smoked hot link sausage. He was really impressed by everything he tried and said that Fire Water is one of the best barbecue restaurants he&#39;s been to.

Our wait was a little bit longer than everyone else&#39;s in the restaurant, probably because of the half slab of ribs in our order. Even then, we waited about 15-20 minutes for our food to be ready which isn&#39;t that long. 

There were 5 different sauces on each table. The Sweet Home Chicago sauce mixed with the Texas heat sauce was a great combo. A little sweet mixed with a little spicy. The outsides of the sauce bottles were dirty and sticky, however. I&#39;m not a germaphobe by any means but that always grosses me out when I go to a BBQ restaurant.

I decided to attempt the ribs and some smoked wings.  I had to get a repeat performance on the garlic fries because they are ridiculously good.  I did try the brisket beans side and a homemade lemonade.

Once again I was transported to a campfire in the woods with meat hanging from limbs over a hickory fire to smoke.  Monday was gone and it was replaced with a weekend at hunt camp.  Each bite better than the last.

I have been here 4 times and I must say it has not improved each time I&#39;ve been there. I will keep this down to one time only. If you order a sandwich with pulled pork and brisket and you have an actual human making it why would you serve it with a boatload of fat? I pretty much had to remove all the beef brisket because it was inedible and absolutely disgusting. The sandwich and the sides were both cold way overpriced with Baby Back Blues down the street that does it hot and fresh every time without serving you a pile of fat.

I had the southsider (pulled pork and brisket) and a side of onion rings and mac and cheese.

The brisket was my FAVORITE. Just like butta!

I love how they had different sauces from different BBQ regions. I really appreciated that. I also appreciated that they give free pickles and jalapenos! 

I think I saw that they serve antibiotic free chicken or something like that so if you&#39;re all about that, you should hit them up. 

I didn&#39;t write much because everyone pretty much summed it up for me. Definitely a place to try out though!"

Sauce selection was diverse 
Sides we out of this world 
Cozy little place 
Good brew line up
Fab deserts 
I had the ribs and smoked wings as good as can be meaty tender ribs slathered in sauce.
Wings smokey goodness
Beans, potato salad , mac and cheese excellent.
I travel for BBQ this place is worth the trip!
Very casual in a strip mall with picnic tables inside 
Friendly and clean
I would highly recommend"

I got the South Sider, it had pulled pork and brisket both equally as good. For sides I got Mac&amp;Cheese which was not to shabby and the blue and bacon salad. 
My date picked a half a slab of ribs, Mac&amp;Cheese too plus garlic fries which I actually liked more then the other sides combined. 
One of the best parts of the meal were the sauces on your table that you can choose to pair with your food. Great place and the service was awesome, food didn&#39;t take long and the staff was energetic and really friendly."

I&#39;ve tried just about everything from the ribs to most the sandwiches. Portions are big &amp; there&#39;s always some to take home for later. My only complaint would be while the kitchen area always seems to be clean, which is good, the tables are often not wiped down and as clean as they could be. They get pretty busy and really need someone dedicated to just cleaning dining area. Otherwise i would give it 5 stars for sure."

First time here with my family and everyone enjoyed it.  My wife liked that the chicken was free range and antibiotic free so she ordered pulled chicken.   My daughter followed her lead and did the kids meal of pulled chicken.   My son hit up the brisket and I ordered the southsider which was brisket and pulled pork on a pretzel bun.   What a great place!!  
Smoked bacon is a must add for $1.50.   I will be back for sure and also will consider it for catering my office as well.

A friend asked me to head to the area with her for a few errands. I usually tag along if I&#39;m free because it&#39;s a chance to explore some new dining establishments. I had about 7% battery life of my phone left, so it was imperative to find a cheap, close lunch spot before my phone died. I clicked &#34;nearby&#34; and Firewater BBQ was the first place that came up. Since my phone died within seconds, it was settled that this was the spot.

My friend and I were both excited to try not only a new-to-us restaurant, but a brand new restaurant that had only opened a few days prior. Although we prepared ourselves for a few new-business kinks, there weren&#39;t any. They ran like a well oiled machine that had been doing this for decades.

We were instantly greeted by one of the friendliest women you&#39;ve ever met( I believe she&#39;s the manager or co-owner since she told us that this was a family run establishment.) She explained the menu and made a few recommendations. I went with the brisket on a regular bun with two sides (mac &amp; cheese and potato salad) and a drink. I believe my total was around $9, which was completely fair for the amount of food that I got.

Of the two sides, I preferred the potato salad. It had pulled pork and bacon in it, and was seasoned really well. The mac &amp; cheese was okay, but not my favorite rendition of it. The brisket was so tender and had the perfect amount of smokey taste. I usually prefer pulled pork to brisket (so I really don&#39;t know why I ordered it) but this was perfection and made me change my opinion on brisket. The sauces are on the table so you can choose which one to slather on your food, and I went with a mixture of the Carolina mustard and their signature sauce. Both delicious. 

They will also be offering a brewery in the future, but right now they are only offering non-alcoholic beverages until they get everything set up. But even without the booze, don&#39;t pass up a chance to eat here. It&#39;s fantastic!"

I had the pulled chicken sandwich, my boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich, his mom got the rib dinner and his brother got the south sidder. 

All sandwiches came with no sauce on them. Literally not a drop. It was good bc I got to taste the meat as it is which was delicious. All sandwiches did come with sauce on the side though. I&#39;m not sure if this was a mix up or if that&#39;s just how they deliver sandwiches. Maybe to prevent soggy buns? Idk but I&#39;m not complaining just noting it bc it was a shock to see a sauces-less pulled pork sandwich. Maybe when we said &#34;extra sauce on the side&#34; the girl thought we said &#34;all sauce on the side&#34;? 

I definitely want to dine in though. The atmosphere at this location is just ok but here&#39;s the thing: extra sauce costs $0.50 but at the restaurant it&#39;s sitting on the table for free. Again, not a complaint just an observation.

Over all, I would definitely order from here again and I hope to stop by the restaurant and dine in soon. I tried the ribs: they are super good. The pulled chicken was also very yummy: you can definitely taste the wood smoke flavor."

Cute place, loved the menu board.  Was greeted by all the kitchen staff (a little weird).

Couldn&#39;t take my coat off, it was freezing inside!  

Ordered the grillmaster burger (burger with pulled pork smoked Gouda and applewood smoked bacon) with 2 sides and a drink, and the husband had the southsider (something like that) (brisket and pulled pork) with 2 sides.

I have to say, I wanted to like it so much, but we both left super disappointed.

What was good?  The meat, smoked with great flavor... and the sauces were great!
unfortunately, the pulled pork on both our sandwiches was ice cold and the bacon was like shoe leather.

What was bad? everything else.  The onion rings tasted like they came from a freezer and were so soaked in grease, it dripped off.  The 3 cheese mac n&#39; cheese, awful... precooked noodles with nacho cheese poured over them.  Potato salad, lackluster.

I can tell they put a lot of money into this place, and they love the business.  But, I suggest Firewater gets some outside help with systems and sides."

Indeed, Firewater BBQ definitely blows some BBQ spots out of the water.  I had the &#34;Southsider,&#34; a massive sandwich of brisket and pulled pork.  The sandwich came on a pretzel bun (or you can get tortillas, plain white bread, or another bread roll), but due to it being piled high with tender, flavorful meat, I had to eat my sandwich with a fork &amp; knife.  But I&#39;m not complaining.  I drowned my sandwich in Firewater&#39;s Apple Bourbon BBQ sauce, my favorite of their four sauces.

I added 2 sides and a drink for $3 more (just one side is $2), so I went with the garlic fries (or you can get salt &amp; pepper or Cajun - oh my the choices to be made here!) and of course, a cup of cheese sauce.  The garlic fries and cheese sauce were very good.  I also had the onion rings, which were good but nothing to write home about.  

My husband had a half slab of ribs and a sausage link with a side of garlic fries and coleslaw.  Two of us ate here for $30, and we both received generous portions of delicious food.  I took half of my sandwich home!

For a BBQ place, Firewater is actually...adorable, when it comes to the ambience.  It&#39;s brightly lit with wall-to-wall windows (could use some shades during the sunset though - ouch!), and there are typical tables and chairs as well as a few picnic style benches.  I love the little piggy face mascot, he looks fierce!  Also there&#39;s a little &#34;Keep Calm&#34; sign in the ladies room with that little piggy face once again.  On one wall of the restaurant is a giant &#34;about us&#34; telling a tale of Ms. O&#39;Leary&#39;s Barn and two men who supposedly invented Firewater Ale and BBQ, which is a cookbook that surfaced in a bomb shelter in Burr Ridge.  Are you still with me?  The story confused me too, but whether fact or fiction, it was entertaining.  They even line their food trays with mock old-timey looking newspapers.

There is nothing to not love about Firewater (unless you&#39;re vegetarian, but I&#39;m talking in general terms).  My only dislike is the picnic tables were a little uncomfortable.  If you&#39;re more than 5&#39;0&#34;, the bench is going to be too high for the table.  That is hardly something that will keep me from coming back though.  Although my husband liked the ribs at another place (far, far away) better, it&#39;s definitely better than another in the area.

There&#39;s even a huge dessert menu, and apparently craft beers are &#34;coming soon.&#34;"

I mean, it was ok, but there are other places out there that I think have BBQ that are just as good or better for the price.

The sticky floors and sticky  BBQ sauce bottles on the table were kind of a turn off."

I&#39;ve carried out about 5 times, and each time the food has been fantastic.  Ribs are excellent, wings as well.  The sausage dish feels like it could use something more, but I don&#39;t have any idea what it could be.

It can be a bit of a long wait if they run out of something, but I&#39;ve only experienced that once.  And it was still worth it.  Best ribs I&#39;ve had, including the national competitors at Ribfest."

There were friendly greetings upon entering, and the guy at the register was friendly and helpful.  We ordered a beef brisket sandwich and a pulled pork sandwich and split them between us.

We both found the brisket to be EXTREMELY fatty...not just marbled, but huge chunks of fat throughout the sandwich.  There also wasn&#39;t very much meat on there, so ultimately, I think we had a sandwich which was about one third fat. It was dripping grease, too.  I watched the guy who prepared it, and he was obviously new, and someone else was giving him suggestions and making gestures showing how to cut and place the meat from the other side of the counter.  Perhaps a little closer supervision would have improved this sandwich.  It wasn&#39;t made very nicely.  

The pulled pork was a little better, although I found it to be a little dry and not very flavorful.  It wasn&#39;t very warm either.  At least there was a lot of meat on the sandwich.

We both liked the sauces.

My husband visited the men&#39;s room to wash the grease off his hands and found that the soap dispenser wasn&#39;t working.  He said you could barely get soap out of it.  Broken paper towel dispenser as well.  We both had a bit of a concern about sanitation if the staff is using a restroom where the soap dispenser isn&#39;t working.  Perhaps they wash hands elsewhere, so I don&#39;t want to pass judgement on that one.

I was going to give this place 3 stars until I saw the description for 2 stars is, &#34;Meh. I&#39;ve experienced better.&#34;  That is a perfect description.

We decided on the way home that we shouldn&#39;t be eating BBQ anyway, and made a pact to opt for healthier fare in the future.  If we should fall off the BBQ wagon, we won&#39;t come back here, though."

The brisket by itself was amazing, like melt in your mouth good, smokey but not overwhelming and tender! The onion rings were also delicious and the beans equally good. They have a bunch of different sauces out on the table for you to try the only one I didn&#39;t like was the white creamy one. Otherwise try the spicy BBQ sauce.

When people spend their money at an eating establishment,  the last thing people desire is to have some pseudo-legal disclaimer on the food preparation. Either make an effort to impress, don&#39;t distress by making not responsible statements as if we are in a walmart parking lot around shopping carts.

Food: chicken was thick chicken breast and the sauce was tasty...some peanut oil in it?
Mushroom burger was a solid B. It was cooked well-done but not blackened or crispy. 

More steakhouse comparisons are needed. Get rid of silly menu statements about responsibility for well-done steaks. Sophmoric at best."

The calamari was, I&#39;m pretty sure, frozen and lacked any real seasoning.

My cheeseburger was a great size and had quality meat but again lacked any seasoning.

The alfredo was way too rich, and tasted like pasta with cheese sauce.

Always excellent...now why the 4 stars.  You get a lot of food here, bread to start, soup, salad, and with you entree a vegetable and a potato.  Sometimes that almost too much food, we walk out of there stuffed....almost uncomfortable stuffed.

The soups are always very good, one of the best clam chowder I ever had and yesterday the cream of mushroom soup which was very good.  The Caesar salad was very bland, the baked potato was only half cooked and enough with the damn broccoli.   Every freaking meal I ever had here came with broccoli. I like broccoli but at home, not dining out, especially with fillet mignon.  

Now my critique; drop soup and salad, one or the other and put those savings into a better choice of vegetable. Also try a different Cesar dressing, last nights was rather bland. A nice side with steak would be garlic spinach or asparagus.  I know it&#39;s more expensive but if you cut out one of the other soup or salad, that could help make up the difference.  I know, my opinion. 

We still love this place, great steaks, and will always come back."

A couple of people in our party had been there before, but I had not. Correction - I had been there numerous times back when it was Bennigan&#39;s, but not since it had become Jameson&#39;s.

I will say that the broccoli soup was decent and that I was impressed that my entrée included both soup AND a salad.  Our server was very prompt and attentive, as well.

I ordered a 6 oz. filet done medium rare with a side of mashed potatoes. The meat itself was actually a decent piece of meat and seasoned just fine, but it was much closer to &#34;medium well&#34; or &#34;well done.&#34;  The mashed potatoes had zero flavor. It was almost as if they took potatoes and mashed them and added nothing else. Mashed potatoes are a pretty easy thing to do relatively well - cream, butter and salt - especially if one calls themselves a &#34;Charhouse.&#34;

It was the day before Thanksgiving and what can be better wetting mouth with juicy meat before eating more juicy meat? 

We started out with stuffed oysters because some pretentious decorated menu separate from the main menu told me to. Oddly enough, I have come to notice that cooked oysters are more expensive than a raw oysters. I will never come to understand how the public views the monetary value of food... I enjoyed the first 3 pieces but and then Mother forced me to finish the remaining 4 pieces on the plate because they somehow see themselves as dainty.  

For my main dish I ordered a medium rare 10oz Rib Eye Steak. I stuck a chunk of warm buttery bread in my mouth because I thought I was finished ordering but the waiter would not stop asking me questions. What side do you want with that? What other side do you want with that? What kind of soup do you want? What salad do you want with that? What dressing do you want with the salad? Apparently, most of the dishes come with 2 sides, soup, and salad. 

It&#39;s great to have short term memory because your waiter will always bring you a pleasant surprise. I was presented with a juicy hand sized cut of Rib Eye, a head of broccoli, red potatoes, salad with balsamic, and French Onion Soup. Mother, who is always trying to fatten me up, insisted that I get the 16oz. Thank the old gods and the new (GoT reference) that I didn&#39;t because I hardly finished my lady sized 10oz piece with all the sides, soup, and salad (OH MY!). 

No desert for me. All in all, it was a delicious deal making for a great pre-game to expand my stomach for Thanksgiving. 

Concluding Haiku:

It&#39;s not just a steak
Sides, soups, salads, and more sides
Deal for a big meal"

Our server, Julian, was friendly and attentive.  Our table started with the fried calamari appetizer. Although I passed on this because of it being fried, it did look crisp, not greasy and was plentiful in size.  Two of my girlfriends ordered burgers and said Jameson&#39;s makes a good burger.  I opted for the liver with bacon and caramelized onions, broccoli, rice pilaf and a dinner salad with the house dressing. I liked that the dressing was automatically served on the side. The waiter recommended the liver be cooked medium and it was so good!  The only negative was that the bacon was too crisp and just crumbled apart and was hard to get it on the fork with the liver. I love crisp bacon but in this dish it should have been less crisp to be able to cut instead of crumbling apart. That aside, I loved my entree. I would come back to try other offerings on the menu."

It&#39;s not of those new steakhouses that open up everywhere. It seems like it&#39;s been around for a while. The steaks are big, but are under seasoned. They lack flavor, a little salt and pepper go a long way. The service is really on top of everything. Plus Ann of their steaks come with soup, salad, and 2 sides. It&#39;s a lot of food for the price. All in all, it&#39;s a good steakhouse with huge portions and good service."

Decor is warm, service is snappy and pleasant, entrees come with soup, salad and warm bread and bar is well stocked and reasonably priced and menu has a nice selection of items. Soup was salty but flavorful. Also price point on entrees is pretty good. Crowd is 50% older but there were also families and some large groups of friends/coworkers. But unfortunately for me 2 out of 3 entrees were forgettable: chicken with artichokes had a thick, overly acidic sauce and the chicken breasts were thick and underseasoned. Butt steak with stuffed shrimp was completely unseasoned (no salt, no nothing!), shrimp were overcooked and filled with &#34;crab&#34;
Stuffing that was bland and crabless. Entrees were served with a sad hunk of undercooked broccoli on an oversized plate that made portion look small even though they weren&#39;t. On these visits my family liked their entrees: fried onion topped burger, chicken parm, blue cheese topped strip steak and prime rib sandwich. Will we try it again? Maybe...."

On my most recent trip here for Sunday dinner I had a nice meal with my family, but when the check came we couldn&#39;t help but be in agreement that our server, Ricardo, either had too many tables or needed to go back to waitstaff school.  He didn&#39;t seem that bad at first, but when my dad voiced his discontent with the rest of us, we began to realize that he did indeed botch several things that made us frown:

*forgot my dad&#39;s (man who signs the check) glass of wine, needed reminding.  Twice.
*gave our bread to the table next to us instead, so we had to ask for more, again.
*generally wasn&#39;t very attentive and seldom checked back on us for water refills, &#34;how&#39;s everything tasting?&#34;, etc

but the real kicker, and main reason why my father, kind and generous man that he is, left only $13 on a $130 tab:
**Ricardo neglected to inform us that the french onion soups were NOT included with dinners and were charged separately ($5 extra, each).  We got the check and we&#39;re like &#39;wtf is this shit?&#39;  This upset our mostly-Bohemian table, especially considering his other shortcomings.

FOOD: enjoyable--4/5
My chicken valentino (stuffed breasts with a lemon butter sauce) was wonderful, and the accompanying rice pilaf was spot-on.  Mom, dad, and grandma enjoyed theirs as well.

SERVICE: lousy--2/5
Refer to my rationale above.  Our waiter was lucky to get 10% from a table of generous tippers.  Seriously.  Get your shit together, Ricardo!"

- Shrimp De Jonghe (6/10)
- Caesar Salad (3/10)
- 28 oz Bone In Ribeye (3/10)

I&#39;ve been to Jameson&#39;s once before, probably 5 years ago or so. It was a random, &#34;Let&#39;s have steak! What&#39;s nearby?&#34; moment. And I can tell you, the experience was about the same. 

Some friends and I were randomly talking over some New Glarus beers that we were trying out for the first time, and got onto the subject of steak. I was talking about how it&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve had a really good steak. That and some of them were supposed to go to a nice steak place, but missed their opportunity that day. So, we decided...&#34;Let&#39;s have steak! What&#39;s nearby?&#34;

Congratulations for Jameson&#39;s for always getting that kind of business! :/

SHRIMP DE JONGHE
Fun fact! Shrimp De Jonghe is apparently a classic Chicago thing - named after DeJonghe&#39;s Hotel &amp; Restaurant (1899-1923)! The more you know! It&#39;s basically like Escargot - but with shrimp. Cooked shrimp, doused in garlic butter and bread crumbs. Maybe some cheese too. The sauce was great, the shrimp - not so much. If the shrimp was good too, I&#39;d consider giving this about an 8 or 9, but the shrimp didn&#39;t taste very fresh, and was a bit rubbery. After enduring through the shrimp, the sauce makes a great spread on the bread, though. And that was what made it enjoyable!

CAESAR SALAD
Why do i bring this up? Because it sucked that much! I don&#39;t know if their house salad would have been any better. The romaine lettuce was fine, it was the Caesar dressing that was just lacking. The Parmesan cheese shreds carried more flavor and seasoning than the dressing. Croutons were like airplane salad croutons.

STEAK
Ok, main course. While we were waiting for the food to come out, we had a discussion about A1 Sauce. My feelings on A1 is that it makes every steak a 7/10. It can take a 1/10 steak and turn it into a 7, but it can also take a 10/10 steak and bring it down to 7. And just before the steak came out, I said FU** it! I&#39;m not going to pity chefs&#39; feelings anymore. If I think a steak is below a 7, I&#39;m ordering that mutha fu**ing A1 Sauce!

So the steak comes out. Looks gorgeous! Clearly not a Morton&#39;s or David Burke&#39;s char, but it&#39;s ok. It&#39;s got the crosshatch grill marks, which look cool. I take a nice cut down the middle and inspect its medium-rareness, and it looks pretty good! Not quite Ruth&#39;s Chris textbook medium rare, but pretty good considering this is twice the mass at 1/2 the price! 

Then the bite. I didn&#39;t SEE a char, and now I confirmed there was no char. No surprise. The flavors unleash first - subtle smoky flavor and a decent amount of that juicy steak flavor...until..wait..mayday mayday mayday! The shock &amp; awe was missing the awe! The gates of seasoning were apparently malfunctioning, and they didn&#39;t come out to join the party to seal the deal. Then the original smoky and juicy flavors realized they were in for the long haul. They dug trenches and tried to fight the night, but alas, their valiant efforts were overwhelmed. The reinforcements never came, and they fell. All that was left was the ashy and muddy flavors of a soulless piece of beef. 

It was tragic, and I was saddened. But, I kept my resolve, and looked back on my promise to, when the goin got tough, &#34;order the mutha fu**in&#39; A1 Sauce!&#34; So I brought in the heavy artillery. Sure they were manufactured, and certainly very sloppy and clumsy, compared to our original flavor platoon, The Beef Division (TBD), but they carried with them bold and saliva-inducing flavors, seasoning, and tang. The &#34;Full Monty.&#34; Sadly, the TBD suffered heavy friendly fire casualties from the A1st &#34;Slop &amp; Pray&#34; technique, but we had to win the war. Though I am grateful for our Beef Division&#39;s efforts, sometimes, you just gotta do what you gotta do. 

In short - the steak was not good. It was stringy too, probably not the best cut of beef. There were several bites I chewed for minutes, before either painfully swallowing or secretly spitting out into the napkin.

FOOL ME ONCE..FOOL ME TWICE
Shame on me. :( Oh well, I won&#39;t make the same mistake thrice...although I WAS intrigued by their prime rib. Their wine list is pretty crappy too, not that I was really expecting a good list, but still. Well, anyway, I&#39;m not so sure how they&#39;re popular enough to have so many locations, but I definitely don&#39;t see a need to come back."

Diarrhea and vomit almost instantaneously. We both work at restaurants, and we had a good idea on what it was. Food poisoning at its finest happened here.luckily we kept the food and gave it to the hospital and they checked it and confirmed it, the food was contaminated.

We will never be coming back here again. As my grandmother used to do with places she didn&#39;t like, she&#39;d swish an imaginary X over the door.

When we entered, the guy who greeted us was super rude. I immediately thought, &#34;Geez, hope he&#39;s not our waiter.&#34; But he was. Walked us over to a table and threw the menus down and asked us if we wanted anything but water, just like that. We said no, that water would be fine. Nice way to upsell, dude. 

We each ordered a burger. 
&#34;How d&#39;ya wanit cookt.&#34; barked the waiter. 
&#34;Well done.&#34; we both said. 

He did an about face and walked away. 

The burger came with fries, but also a soup and we also got bread and butter served at the table. Thought that was nice. Most places don&#39;t give bread and a soup. It was an onion soup. It tasted decent. 

The burgers came. Both were cooked well. I thought mine was tasty. My husband didn&#39;t like his at all. 

We paid the bill. It came out to about $30. We left disappointed because the food wasn&#39;t great and we just blew $30 on food and service that was subpar. I hate that!"

We waited for almost 30 minutes when there were entire sections empty and servers were standing around.

My wife and I were by ourselves, date night, and we were sat at a table towards the kitchen squished between two other tables full of loud (drunk) parties. Rookie host mistake, we didn&#39;t ask to move because we shouldn&#39;t have to. You sit us at a crap table, you deal with the bad experiences.

We genuinely could not hear each other so we started to get frustrated.

We ordered and when our food came, my wife&#39;s order was wrong. She asked for &#34;no onions&#34;, simple right, not the end of the world, just correct the mistake. Instead, the waitress argued with her. &#34;No you didn&#39;t, I read it back to you and I always write down orders&#34;. She pulled out her pad and pointed to my wife&#39;s order without reading it. It said &#34;n/o&#34; next to my wife&#39;s order. She stopped, asked if she wanted to send it back and waited for my wife&#39;s response.

My wife sent it back. It came back with no onions with a fresh piece of unmelted cheese inside the bun. I didn&#39;t understand this. Why add cheese? It&#39;s plaguing my mind.

Also, fries tasted frozen and were mushy.

The server came by to check on us. Asked if I wanted another drink, I said &#34;yes, please&#34; and she gave me a dirty look like I am inconveniencing her. My wife actually started laughing out loud at the blatant rudeness. We paid our check and left. 

Bad food and worse service."

Yes, they have not had AC for a number of days, the air is stagnant and warm and we got lucky to find the ONLY table that had a fan blowing on it.  If not for that, we would not have stayed.

And what was our reward for enduring these conditions?  NADA,  a big fat NOTHING.  No discount on our bill, no certificate for a free appetizer or dessert should we return.  It was a Friday evening and, usually packed, the bar had a handful of people.  A number of people came in, found out there was no AC, and left.  Really, reward those who stick with you in difficult times.

They were super busy.  We had reservations at 6pm and didn&#39;t get seated until around 6:20.  They only had 3-4 chairs to sit while you wait.  I sat in an uncomfortable position on the fireplace ledge with my daughter.  There was additional seating in the breezeway, but it was freezing.  I was freezing every time someone opened the door and I was sitting next to the fireplace.

The staff was really friendly...from the hostesses to the busboys, to the wait staff.  

This was our first time here and we only live minutes away.  I&#39;m glad we discovered it (albeit only because it was one of the few places open on Christmas), because we plan to come back.   

I had a Salmon salad with goat cheese and walnuts.  My dinner companions had a Ribeye steak and a Fillet, both cooked perfectly to order and tasted great.  I liked that the waiter waited while they cut into the meat to ensure it was cooked as requested.   The presentation with 3 massively thick asparagus was a bit off putting, especially when alone on the plate with meat.   I hate thick pieces of asparagus (personal preference).   My husband said the asparagus was stringy and tough (which is typical of thick pieces of asparagus).  They should opt for a different veggie or thinner pieces.   Broccoli or mixed veggies perhaps?  

With regard for the children&#39;s menu, I was disappointed on the complete lack of ANY veggie options for kids.  The choices for the kids menu was as follows:  Hamburger w/fries, Cheeseburger w/fries, Chicken strips w/fries, Penne Pasta w/marinara, Grilled Cheese w/fries, Cheese Pizza (no side), Fried Shrimp w/fries.   We need to teach kids to eat healthy options and this certainly was not it.  I made my daughter broccoli when we got home.   Please for the sake of teaching kids to eat healthy, add some veggie choices to their meals (cooked carrots or broccoli are great options!). 

The portion size of the fried calamari appetizer for $10 was great!  And it tasted fantastic too!

Took one star away for lack of healthy options for kids and lack of warm seating in the entry way by the fireplace.  Food was fantastic tasting and service really attentive.

We plan on coming back again."

We never have less than an awesome meal here and the prices are affordable especially for what you get.  You will not walk out of this please wanting for anything.  From the manager&#39;s (Jeff is absolutely the BEST), to the hostesses, all their wait staff, they are so nice, accommodating customer&#39;s all the time and god forbid, they over or undercook your meal, you always get compensated somehow by management.  Sometimes so much so, that I hate to even send something back for undercooking cause they will always offer a free dessert.  So don&#39;t believe any reviews that have said management is not apologetic or try to make things right because that is just BS!  The wait staff are always prompt and knowledgeable and if they aren&#39;t sure of something, they will go and ask.  Their steaks are great, no not Gibson&#39;s quality but not Gibson&#39;s prices either, lamb chops and prime rib are equally as good, all their cream soups are to die for and so is their baked French onion and yes it is extra, REALLY???? Someone actually reamed out the restaurant for the waiter not telling them it was an extra charge?  What planet are you on? What restaurant will ever give you free baked French soup with your meal? And I am not a salad eater but their homemade creamy garlic dressing MAKES ME DESIRE THEIR SALAD!!!!  It is Orgasmic.  It&#39;s the BOMB! 

If you haven&#39;t tried it yet, definitely go.  You will not be disappointed.  Even if you don&#39;t for some strange reason like what you get, and I can&#39;t imagine that happening, at least between the bread, soup, salad and entrée there will be something you will like for the money you will spend."

Mediocre food. You&#39;re better off checking out one of the million and one Greek family restaurants scattered throughout the Chicagoland area. When you go to a steakhouse you expect a certain quality of food and this definitely wasn&#39;t it. 

The service was a serious let-down. Whatever was going on in the kitchen must have been way more exciting than in the main restaurant because our waiter barely spent any time with his guests, and took forever whenever we asked him for anything, and he forgot what he was supposed to bring us on more than one occasion. He also forgot to ask how I wanted my steak prepared. It&#39;s a good thing I like them rare since that&#39;s what I ended up with. 

Don&#39;t bother with this one, folks. It&#39;s a bust. We couldn&#39;t get out of there fast enough."

I went with the pork chops.. Amazing! 2 generous sized chops full of flavor &amp; juices! My boyfriend commented it was the 1st time he&#39;s seen me eat chops without A-1.. I didn&#39;t need to.. Yum!

My boyfriends sirloin was something to behold.. Large, cooked to his request &amp; very tender..wow!

The most surprising part of this experience was probably the price. On par to less then others yet more food!  

Normally you only get soup or salad but here we got both. Plus fresh hot bread so be prepared to leave completely stuffed!"

Time for some steak!  The restaurant has a very casual feel, with vaulted wood ceilings and wooden walls.

The heat index that day was 109°F and was happy to see the huge pipes up tip with the large A/C vents.  But they didn&#39;t seem to help much.  The place was very muggy and umcomfortable.  We were starving and it was torture waiting so long for our bread &amp; butter.  Our refills also took a while to get, but got much better throughout the service.  But overall the service was slow, even though the place wasn&#39;t packed.

I got the cream of mushroom soup, which was a bit salty, but good.  The side salad was very fresh and had a good mix of greens.  But once the fat ass NY strip came out, I got really happy.  It was a thick thick cut of moist, well salted, and nicely charred beef, which gave it great flavor.  The steak went perfect with some baked potato.

I had a solid steak and left happy.  Meat mission accomplished."

Finally we tried it and we have to say it was worth the stop. The environment is nice, was a bit loud but not over whelming for a Saturday dinner. There was a wait so the hostess asked if we would want to eat at the tables around the bar, which we did. The server (who was also a bartender) was very nice and helpful. He was a little slow with some things, taking our orders, filling drinks, but not horrible, most likely due to him being busy at the bar so we understood and had no issue. Food was great, i had a steak my girlfriend had a chicken kabob, both were delicious. She also had a soup which was amazing. Meal was great, server was great and prices were not horrible. Would recommend to anyone in the area."

We went in with our in-laws and our son just before 5 on a Saturday. Immediately were greeted by Jeff the manager. Our waitress was super nice and attentive. All of us got a variety of different things, steak, shrimp, fish and chicken. I had the filet which was solid and cooked perfectly. Everyone enjoyed their meal including my five year old. Dinners include soup and salad which both were very good to lead up to the main course -garlic salad dressing and cream of broccoli soup. Jeff the manager even gave my son a scoop of vanilla. By the time we left the place was packed. Have I had better steaks before? Yes but they were 40 bucks plus ala cart. This is above average unless you want to spend a ton more at gibsons, Mortons, Sullivan&#39;s, capital grille etc. The guys each had 2 beers (much appreciated they had revolution anti-hero on tap) and the ladies had 2 glasses of wine. This kinda quality under $150 for 5 people which was our tab is hard to find. We will be going back without question."

It was a night out to celebrate our anniversary and we found out one of our FAVORITE places (Churrasco Brazilian Steakhouse) went out of business. FAIL! :( 

I searched them on Google and Yelp (of course) but not too many pictures. We wanted to make sure they had nice decor/vibe etc. This location is in the old Bennigan&#39;s building (75th and Main I believe) so we were not sure how much the decor had been changed. Let me say walking in I was pleasantly surprised. Pretty nice decor and layout. We were seated at this nice corner private booth in the bar area. Pretty lighting fixtures, wood floors, loft like ceilings etc. A nice empty quiet night considering the time and holiday I suppose. The only &#34;bad&#34; thing about our booth was the kitchen was behind us and had no door so we could hear the workers talking, singing etc. It was kind of funny I guess because that happens to us from time to time. 

It was about 7:30 and the only thing we worried about was being rushed through dinner because sadly another restaurant in Woodridge that closes at 9pm. Wish they had later hours. 

I started out with a Vitamin C martini. It was delicious! My boyfriend had some kind of caffeine martini (lol) and said it was good and strong. Warm bread and butter was brought to the table which I always enjoy. 

As for dinner I ordered the 7oz Filet Mignon which came with soup, crisp salad, choice of potato (or rice) and veggies. That was a lot of food for around 20 bucks! WELL worth it. My steak was SO juicy and cooked just how I like it. Medium well.:) My bf had ordered the Porterhouse steak and he liked it too but said it had just a LITTLE too much gristle. 

So all in all good last minute experience and I will defiantly go back at some point. Maybe for their lunch specials! Enjoy my pics! 

Good luck in this location guys! :)"

The staff is RUDE.  Our server, Rocco, was both RUDE and condescending and had an &#34;I could care less&#34; attitude.  Must be passed on from the rudeness of the manager, I believe his name was Jeff, on duty at the time.

Will not ever visit this establishment again.  Server was so rude, all he cared about was his tip, and when he received a very small tip, which was based upon the HORRIBLE service he provided, he was confrontational.

The food was good, however, when you go out to dinner, you are going out for the service AND good food."

It was virtually dead inside due to our meal timing and I&#39;m sure they are suffering since 75th Street and Main Street are both under construction and driving in this area is an incredible nightmare!

Even though our server (Amanda) should have been bored out of her mind she was amazingly friendly, upbeat and was the highlight of our dining experience.  You just don&#39;t find servers like her anymore.  Most of the time they act like they are doing you a big favor and many rarely go out of their way for you.  I wish I could have her as my server everywhere I go!  She was very attentive without being the slightest bit overbearing.  She was the reason I gave this five stars.  If she had been an average waitress it would have been four stars! 

The food was great.  I wasn&#39;t very hungry so I just got the house salad and baked french onion soup.  I enjoyed both.  

My mom got a pasta dish with shrimp and it came with soup or salad.  She got the chicken noodle soup.  She really liked her meal as well and there was so much pasta she brought some home.  

This was my first time here in years and we will be back for sure.  Hopefully the construction will end so it can be sooner rather than later!"

It was packed and my family was the youngest in the bunch. Decent atmosphere. I had a steak- it was not cooked correctly (and I&#39;m very flexible, eating steak at medium or MW depending on my mood). My steak had far too much grizzle and fat. My mom had Shrimp de Jonge- it was ALL breading. They do offer soup and salad with meals with is like an open invite to the senior citizen crowd! I felt like I was in Florida at a restaurant with an early bird special. Our server was very nice, but she had trouble keeping up ( couldn&#39;t check in and we had a few things we needed). For what it&#39;s worth, my wife enjoyed and my kids weren&#39;t complaining!"

We ended up here because we passed it traveling down 75th street. 5PM on a Tuesday night.  We were just in jeans, and I even had on sandals. I peeked in and saw it looked pretty upscale so we were about to turn around and leave because I felt we were under dressed but an employee (manager maybe) insisted we were fine and to come on in. He was the friendliest person here. All the other staff seemed to be miserable. To our hearts delight they had an extensive steak menu. I ordered an 11oz filet and my other half chose the 24oz porterhouse. The complimentary bread at the table tasted like my first attempt at french bread (which I threw away.) It was extremely dense and tasted like raw flour. My ice tea was fresh, but the glasses are so tiny and filled with ice I only got 2 drinks out of it before it had to be refilled. It was empty before the soup arrived and my waiter asked if I wanted it refilled. Do you really need to ask? The soup was gross. It was chicken. It had some weird noodle or rice with carrots and celery. It was something that you would get at a senior citizen home. Complete mush, tasted like it came from a can. The salad was decent, good french dressing. Our steaks arrived. Both ordered medium rare. My filet was disgusting. Completely over cooked around the perimeter, and rare on the inside. The over cooked portion was so well done and it tasted like hamburger, but hamburger that&#39;s not even seasoned. It was disgusting. I was going to send it back, but my boyfriend hates when I do that so he offered up his porterhouse to me and took the filet. Poor guy. The porterhouse was good, not great but not awful. I described it as &#34;underwhelming.&#34; I just can&#39;t get over the catastrophe that was the filet. I hate when a steak house can&#39;t cook such a delicious piece of meat. FYI you can&#39;t cook a steak that thick in the skillet alone, you have to cook it in the oven after you sear the outside. I can&#39;t believe I even have to say this. You&#39;ve ruined the best steak a person can order, and I can&#39;t forgive that. My opinion is that alone should  make the review 1 star, maybe I&#39;m just feeling generous today. The side with the steak was garlic mashed potatoes, which were actually garlic glue. They were not good, not good at all. I wish we had just gone to Coopers Hawk, but I was feeling adventurous. I regret this so much in hindsight.
Our total ticket was $75.27 before tip. That would have been a reasonable price if the food wasn&#39;t sub par, however it was a total train wreck and we will never go back.  The best part of the meal was the pie we picked up from Bakers Square on our way home."

Thankfully we got in just before Jameson&#39;s started crowding up too.  Having grown up in this area, I know that these four corners (Lemont Rd/75th St.) are nuts on Friday and Saturday&#39;s but we were running a little behind.

We were seated instantly and skipped the appetizers.  We were hungry but knew that the dinner portions were pretty good sized here from a previous visit with my parents.

What is amazing is that Jameson&#39;s must be the last restaurant on Earth that gives you soup AND salad with your dinner entree.  Ahh, proper dining.  I don&#39;t care if they bury that in the entree prices, just hearing that brings back emotions of good family dinners from the past.

I had the Chicken Tortellini soup and my wife and mother-in-law had the minestrone.  My only complaint was that there was only ONE tortellini in my soup but it was a good stock broth with carrots, celery and onions so it was okay.

I got the 11oz Filet, medium and that&#39;s how it arrived.  I also got a baked potato was was made perfectly.  My wife got the Chicken &amp; Ribs combo as did my Mother-in-Law.  It was more food than either of them could eat.  They actually joked that they could have just done one order and split it.

Our son got the penne pasta marinara.  We asked for the sauce on the side as he likes to add to his own liking and not only did the sauce come on the side, but they gave him his own little plastic ramekin of Parmesan cheese to add.  He loved it.  Being able to create his own level of sauce/cheese had him fully vested in the dish versus many other places where they just plop it down.  WINNER.

We were too full for dessert.  But gosh they looked really really good.  This is one of my parents&#39; favorite places and I was reminded why with this visit.

By the time we left, the wait was pretty lengthy and we had to fight our way through the crowd to get out."

The cocktails really are fantastic here. And the Woodridge Club is a gigantic sandwich packed with loads of turkey, avocado, and bacon. It is impossible to eat the whole sandwich in one sitting, unless your stomach is a bottomless pit. On top of that, you get a bread basket and I think most entrees come with soup or salad. It is way too much food. They could do without all that. Be prepared for lots of leftovers! I definitely think Jameson&#39;s is a good place to visit. If you plan on dining here Friday or Saturday night, be sure to make a reservation."

We were a large party on Valentines weekend so I understand that the place was crowded. but they said they would seat us by 830 and we were not seated until 9. when we ordered, they were out of mashed potatoes, but had boiled. just mashed the boiled and accommodate your hungry guests! We were seated in a private party area that was pretty outdated compared to the nice ambiance of the rest of the place. I did like the bar area with the fireplace, and the price of the food. you get what you pay for, however, because my ribeye was just ok.

Our friends had burgers which they liked, and my companion liked her beef kabob.  

Other Yelpers commented that their steaks weren&#39;t cooked the way requested, and that&#39;s the experience I had.  If you order a steak, talk with the waiter in detail about what you want.  It might help.

She said hers was nothing special.  She had been looking foward to a melt in your mouth steak and this wasn&#39;t to be one.

The red potatoes I had as a side were boiled and had no decoration or appeal to them.  Wife describes them as bland.

No real apologies were made by the waitress nor did a manager do a follow up.

I&#39;m a picky eater and the other day I ordered the full slab of ribs and I wanted them without sauce and I didn&#39;t want the potatoes.  Our server was Bonnie, and she answered all of my questions, (there were several), and said yes to all of my special requests.  She even doubled up on the broccoli for me because I didn&#39;t want the potatoes.

Needless to say, everything came out in a timely manner, and EXACTLY as ordered.

My wife had the prime rib, and it is on my list for next time because it was one of the best I ever tasted - perfectly marbled, and perfectly cooked.

My only neg. of this trip to Jameson&#39;s was that there was a very noisy group at the bar - That could happen anywhere, so not a biggie.

The broccoli sides were so over BOILED they were almost mush and bland in flavor and color. The steak portions were TINY and over cooked. Mine was medium and my wife&#39;s was well done.

The appetizers were flavorful but small portions for the cost. We couldn&#39;t decide between 2 so got both and figured we&#39;d have left overs. But the portions were small enough we decided it was lucky we had gotten 2.

The food: I haven&#39;t had a bad thing. I love the sandwiches here. I love the burgers. The fries could use more salt, but I won&#39;t knock a star for that. Order the Philly steak sandwich (which is really nothing like a cheesesteak). I&#39;ve never had a steak sandwich with more tender meat. They serve it on delicious ciabatta bread and the portion is huge! I love bringing it home for leftovers the next day. My absolute favorite is the French onion soup. If you want it with your meal, but don&#39;t want to pay extra you can get it without the cheese on top.

The bottom-line: You can&#39;t go wrong here. Plus the atmosphere is inviting and great to meet up with family. Once our busboy accidentally spilled water on us and the manager rushed over to make sure everything was taken care of."

You get a good meal for a fair price and that can be hard to come by when eating steaks.  We ordered the Shrimp DeJonge for an appetizer, it was very garlicky (a plus for me) and very tasty.  They give you bread &amp; butter and no matter how much you eat, they keep bringing more.  We ordered the Sirloin and the Filet for dinner and both were cooked as we requested.  For the price of your steak, you receive soup AND salad, potato and vegetable.  The steaks aren&#39;t overpriced either and the quality is good.  The only downside for me is that their desert menu wasn&#39;t more diverse.  Pretty much all that was on it were cakes, key lime pie, and maybe cheesecake.  After a meal I, like most women, like something sweet... but a big slice of cake is just too heavy.  Maybe some kind of ice cream related desert, oh and they don&#39;t have ice cream to make your desert a-la-mode either.  This didn&#39;t ruin my meal or anything as I was actually plenty full and didn&#39;t really have room for desert anyways.  
For such a busy night we had really great, attentive service from the girl with the long, light red hair (hint to management!). 

For all this, plus one mixed drink and one non-alcoholic beverage... the bill was $80 pre-tax.  That&#39;s a good deal in my book."

Had been to Jameson&#39;s Mt. Prospect for lunch a few times previously and had always had good experiences.  Last night was great experience - we arrived around 6:30 and by 6:42, our wine and soups were already on the table.  

Samantha waited on us and was very friendly and extremely efficient.  I had the KC Strip and hubby had the prime rib, both came out cooked exactly as we ordered - medium rare.  The salads were fresh, crisp lettuce with very good dressings - only negative we both found was that our baked potatoes were a little dry.  

As far as value, we&#39;d rate that very high - the meals come with homemade soup, salad, potato or rice along with fresh steamed veggies and the meat. For two full meals and a bottle of wine, the total tab was a little over $80 - not bad.

Overall, it was an outstanding experience - we&#39;ll definitely be back."

This one popped up in Woodridge and last night was about my third time there since it&#39;s opening. It attracts an older crowd, good place to take the in-laws and out-of-towners. 

Nice interior, very welcoming, very similar to their Elk Grove location. The biggest plus of this joynt is that they replaced a dumpy Bennigans. I have a strong &#34;constitution&#34; and have only got food poisoning twice and once was at the ratty Bennegians that was at this location. You never would guess this was a Bennigans, they really did a great job on the remodel. Anyways, I digress. 

First of all, make sure you are ready to eat big before you go here, the portions are huge. You get the whole deal here, salad, soup, potato, giant entree. 

The pluses: 

I had the Parmesan crusted NY strip, it was really good. Baked potato, salad, and veggie were all pretty functional and good. The steak was well seasoned and cooked nicely. 

The beer was tall and cold. 

The so-so areas: 

Service was just OK, the woman seemed friendly enough but seemed rather confused in generally. I gave her a $50 AT&amp;T promotion card and a $20 bill to cover the bill for the two of us. I explained the card to her and she went and processed it and said it only takes 40 for the bill but leaves $10 off for the tip. She was way confused and we got it straightened out after a moment. She was kinda quiet but OK I guess, seemed new to waitressing. But it was OK. 

The greeters/hostesses seemed kinda lost and were not that friendly, appeared overwhelmed by nothing... again, it was OK. 

Not so good: 

Disappointed by the clam chowder soup. I am a big fan of the chowder. This was rather watery, lackluster, and functional. Very disappointed 

Jameson&#39;s is always a good value if you are seeking a steak or their salmon is generally very good too. Although people/the restaurant claim to have &#34;world famous ribs&#34;, I think they are only just OK here. To me this is a very good lunch place and only a good dinner place. Maybe my expectations are too high. 

Great value, lots to eat, and good food... I hope they build on it and stay a long time. I wish they were one of my favorites in the area but I would be lying to myself."

We went there on one of the coldest nights of the season (it was -6 with a wind chill of -24 below zero). We entered, and were seated right away. We were lucky to have Paige as our server. She was extremely knowledgeable of all menu items, and was up front and honest regarding some questions we had. I discovered that Paige has been at Jameson&#39;s since it opened five years ago. We gave her our orders, and I had a few special requests. I&#39;m onion intolerant, and she knew which items contained onions and I chose alternate selections. I also asked for iceberg lettuce only in my salad, which she brought in a beautiful presentation. My wife had Chicken Marsala, and I had grilled pork chops. Both of our entre&#39;s were delicious, and because of the warm crusty bread Paige brought, we got full very fast, and brought our leftovers home. Paige as a server is an asset to Jameson&#39;s. Anyone she serves will be pleased and delighted with their dining choices at this establishment. Five stars hands down."

They quoted a 20 minute wait and we were pleasantly surprised to be seated in less than 10. 

The decor is in your standard char house decor- nothing spectacular but not shabby.  There was a good variety of clientele so anybody and everybody should feel comfortable eating here (even if you are in capris, flip-flops, and a t-shirt).  

The food was good. Nothing great but good enough to bring us back next time we are in the area. The charbroiled chicken was very good quality meat, the veggies were steamed and quite yummy, and my hubby said his prime rib was tender and flavorful.  Our salads were fresh, the soup was good and hot, as was the bread. All in all good experience.

Since I seem to be expecting the waitstaff to be waitstaff and that is apparently no longer in their job descriptions, I will not rate this establishment on the waitstaff. I will however say that it was not the greatest service but by far not the worst. One note though- timing and delivery of the &#34;next course&#34; was impeccable. So kudos for that.  

Overall- enjoyable meal. Will return."

From beginning to end, our visit was okay at best and we probably wouldn&#39;t go back.  Our server was nice and attentive, bringing refills on our drinks without being asked.  However, the size of the glass that the drinks were brought in were fit for a child, so the drinks had to be refilled quite a bit.

We started out with a spinach artichoke dip appetizer.  Normally a fan of this kind of appetizer, I didn&#39;t like it at all.  The dip tasted like just spinach to me - I didn&#39;t get any other flavors out of it.  Then we ordered a Porterhouse Steak (him) and a 7 oz fillet (me).  The main courses come with a soup, a salad and a potato.  Figuring that I would be pretty full after all of this food, I went with the smaller fillet.  However, the salad came out and was just okay.  The Italian dressing was fat-free dressing and it didn&#39;t say that on the menu, so don&#39;t order Italian if you don&#39;t like fat-free dressing.  There was a choice of two soups of the day, and we went with Chicken Tortellini.  They did have additional soups to choose from, but you would have to pay extra to have those soups.  The soup I receive tasted of nothing else but carrots and I only ate a little bit.  Finally our steaks came and we were again disappointed.  My steak which was to be 7 oz looked more like a 3 oz portion.  So small in fact that they &#34;garnish&#34; it with a large piece of broccoli which was the same size as the steak.  We both ordered medium-rare and my steak was rare and my husband&#39;s was well done.  I was okay with my steak a little on the rare side, so I ate mine but my husband asked for a new steak.  They quickly brought out a replacement steak, but this time the steak was very rare.  The steak got sent back a second time and was finally brought back out medium-rare.  The manager came over and apologized and did offer us dessert on the house which was nice.  We got the Key Lime Pie, which was actually more of a Key Lime Tart.  It was a small (about the size of a large cookie), round tart with Key Lime filling and whipped cream on top of it.  It was kind of dry and not very good.  But the gesture was nice

The atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice and rustic.  However, a steak place needs to know how to cook a steak and adding a lot of sides with your meal really doesn&#39;t mean much if they don&#39;t taste good."

We were seated promptly and the restaurant was surprisingly busy for a Monday. I am a server so I understand that the staff might have been caught off guard. 

After sitting for a few minutes we heard someone yelling excuse me from accross the room it was our waitress telling us she would be right with us. Five minutes later she came by to tell us again she would be right with us. I said I understand because I also work in the industry. Maybe that was my mistake because it took Ten more minutes to put in our drink and appetizer order. We wanted to put in our meal order but she said she would have to be right back. Our appetizer came out promptly but was half gone by the time we got out drinks. The vitamin c martini was worth the wait though.

The waitress did not come back to take our dinner order until another ten minutes after the appetizer was gone. Then it took another fifteen to get our food which would have been great if she had just taken our order when we got our appetizer. My boyfriends food had mushrooms althought he requested no mushrooms and my food was peppery and my steak was rare and I asked for medium. 

I assumed the server was new but I heard her talking to customers she knew. I have eaten here before and it was great but I may never go back because the server was so bad. Aside from the fact I felt like she was just waiting for us to walk out she was rude on top of it. If I go back again someday and she is working I will walk right back out."

We happened to find this place by luck, because originally we planned on dining at a nearby restaurant but it had gone out of business. Since we were already in the area and didn&#39;t feel like driving farther we came here which was the best choice. 

They have an array of different types of Asian foods, from Chinese, Korean, to Thai, and much more. I must admit that it was definitely a challenge as to what to order with so many dishes to choose from. So we went with what we normally like from any Asian restaurants, which was pho, fried noodles with chicken and vegetables, thai-tea, and a refreshing watermelon drink. Let me tell you, everything was absolutely amazing! We loved it so much that we returned two more times while visiting Illinois. 

Not only were the foods delicious, the customer service here was as wonderful as the foods they served us. I wish I could eat here again, but now it is just too far. For those who live close by I highly recommend this place if you enjoy Asian foods."

The order came with one white rice, 2 fortune cookies and packets of soy sauce, hot mustard and sweet and sour- delivered- all for $27.22! We tipped extra cause of speedy friendly delivery person. 

The Szechuan chicken had just the right amount of spice! Hot n spicy while eating but not a lingering pain. The sesame chicken was not spicy rather it was just the right amount of tangy sweet.  The fried rice is the best we have had in a long time! 

The only cons- the fortunes in the fortune cookies were kinda lame. Also, the last time I ate here I thought the tofu dishes were gross. The tofu was like soggy slimy and I personally like mine a little more firm.

My wife and I did go to Chinese Harvest however for Asian cuisine and it was wonderful. The restaurant features authentic Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai dishes. 

We came early for dinner and sat near two Vietnam War Veteran&#39;s who could not say enough good things about Chinese Harvest&#39;s menu and the service. 

During our visit, we ordered small orders of several items from the various cuisines and each dish was nicely arranged, the portions were abundant and the food was fantastic. 

My wife and I live in Naperville and we have tried over a dozen local &#34;Chinese&#34; restaurants and we have finally found one that we will stick with. 

Tapioca? Smoothies? Bubble Tea? LOL"

Actually it&#39;s awful. The meat was scary (the beef seriously tasted like stinky fish) the potstickers were all dough with barely any filling and in general, the food was totally bland. If anyone finds a great Chinese spot in the western suburbs, please let me know. I&#39;m desperate."

The fried stuff didn&#39;t have as much flavor as I&#39;m used to (saltiness), but fried tofu is ok out of the other 2. 
I had the strawberry smoothie and it&#39;s more like a watermelon slush/icee but without sugar. 
The service is ok and basically consists of the 1 woman there with some help of possibly her younger children who are teens. 
This help is the closest chinese restaurant to me that is decent, but hopefully it&#39;ll get a bit better or another place will open up soon. I miss Noodles Delight that is in Roselle."

However, based on a handful of positive reviews my wife and I decided to give Chinese Harvest a try. She ordered Chicken eggplant and potstickers, and I had the sesame chicken and pepper steak. 

We eat Chinese quite often, sometimes in the city and sometimes in a random suburb. I can honestly say this was the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten. Ever. 

When I&#39;m hungry and come across an average tasting meal I generally finish it. Sure, those average and below average meals won&#39;t satisfy the taste buds, but I spent good money on the stuff.  Therefore, I&#39;m eating that garbage in order to get my money&#39;s worth. 

This was the exception. It was barely edible. The beef in the pepper steak tasted like fish. It had a horrendous texture and must have been either the fattiest cut of beef available, or, an extremely low quality cut. When I stated to my wife my food was inedible and literally tasted like fish she gave it a try. Her feedback verbatim? &#34;That is the nastiest beef I&#39;ve ever tasted. How does one make beef taste like foul fish?&#34;

On to the sesame chicken. Mushy chicken chunks with a very light (again slimy) batter that tasted like...well...nothing. Again, having had sesame chicken at probably 200 places over the course of my life, this would rank towards the bottom. Strike 2...another dish down the garbage disposal. 

My wife didn&#39;t mind her eggplant chicken. And she said the potstickers weren&#39;t too bad. I stuck to the white rice, as that was the only part of the dinner that was edible in my opinion. 

Will not be back."

The broth was bland, lacking the star anise twang we all love in pho broth. It didn&#39;t come with the typical jalapeño, lime, basil condiments. I asked for lime and sriratcha, and she came out with chili oil and dry as a desert limes. I added lots of what I did have to doctor the broth as best I could. The size of the noodle bowl was huge though. I&#39;d also ordered some Viet spring roll, which were ok, with ground beef and glass noodle on the inside. Maybe my mistake was ordering Viet food?

As the vegan options in this area are limited, I&#39;ve been a regular at Chinese Harvest for the past few months as they have a lot of variety. Today, however, was very disappointing. The server was sick. She was wearing a winter coat and scarf and looked terrible. I know that most restaurants don&#39;t give sick leave, but having a sick server on duty isn&#39;t good for business. I seriously debated leaving and coming back when she was healthy, but I was on the clock and needed to eat, so I wiped clean everything that she touched and hoped she didn&#39;t cough all over my food. The owner or manager (not sure exactly his position) was having issues with the credit card machine. He was at the table right next to mine and put his phone on speaker so I could hear all the hold music with the company he was calling - c&#39;mon! As I said in my previous post, the atmosphere is lacking, but I really can&#39;t stand people subjecting everyone else to their phone calls. As the owner/manager, this is really rude and unprofessional. Take the call elsewhere and send your employee home WITH PAY."

The wait staff , especially the younger lady who was my server was very friendly, helpful, and very knowledgeable about the area. The best part was her uniforms, that is plural. 

I was also informed that this is a great place to bring family, especially families with young children. They have highchairs, and even a secret breakfast menu, one that needs to be specifically asked for. Otherwise, you&#39;ll never find it on any pc the main menu card. Supposedly this is an insider secret only the locally are aware of. 

There&#39;s also lots of big screen tv&#39;s, slots, for watching football, or trying your hand with lady luck. In short, there&#39;s something for everyone. What i liked the most was its pub like atmosphere, reminiscing of my time living in Germany where Irish pubs are very popular, and because of a large population of Irish living in Germany. 

So, if you live in the area, and looking for an Irish pub, be sure to drop in. All colours, nationalities are welcome. Btw, this is my opinion, and my insights. The pub management, or its staff did not didn&#39;t directly affect my opinion or views. 

Thanks."

My friend was celebrating her birthday here based on the live music playing that night.

Personally, I&#39;d stick with the appetizers and not the meals.  You do get a free appetizer with your Yelp app check in, so be sure to make note of that!  

They had &#34;March&#34; specials everywhere which was confusing because it was mid-April... and they didn&#39;t have one of their March special beers either when we ordered it.  The nachos were good, we got that for our free appetizer... I got a California burger which was a turkey burger w/ guacamole on top.  It was alright...nothing to brag about.

Started with a Scotch Egg, my first experience and it was tasty. I went with the blackened cod and cayenne ranch tacos. I was impressed and I&#39;m looking forward to trying the Mckayla&#39;s Southwest chicken salad, which I brought home.

I have had their burger at the Bolingbrook location and enjoyed it.

Obvi. + Pretty sure I go to jail on the terms of something statutory if I don&#39;t post JK a billion times after saying that. 

I came here because my boo was meeting up with friends at a local Bavarian beer pub that I love and invited me to come along, only that pub had a 2-hour wait, so this was actually the group&#39;s 3rd choice as watering hole for the night and it happened to be the only one without an over-an-hour wait on a night where there was basically a blizzard in progress. 

So we ended up at Tilted Kilt which was basically empty with no wait and also served calorie-free Gold Peak Iced Tea (which is all I wanted), so it was convenient for all.

It def took a while to get serviced at first, but to be fair, we had a pretty big table and it seemed like there were only 2 servers taking care of the whole place on this particular Saturday night. 

Even though I went with just an iced tea, I was impressed with their beer selection. Please note that their beer menu -- including their seasonals, are not all listed on the menu. Def give yourself a hot two minutes to check out the selection of taps at the bar, which does include some rather impressive (for being a chain or otherwise local watering hole) local draft brews.

I watched the rest of my group order grub and again was pretty impressed with their mighty delicious looking flatbread and that they were able to accommodate a vegan in our group. I never in a million years would have thought they could do vegan here but he seemed to enjoy both his chips, salsa, and guac as well as his cheese-less flatbread. 

I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d ever seek it out without there being pre-existing plans and an impending blizzard, but for what it was, it wasn&#39;t bad."

On a self dare &amp; low tire pressure I made myself go to get what I thought would be low to average American fare after I had to fill up my low tire. While I had only assumed that the eye candy might help lift my spirits I was surprised by how good the wing appetizer was and the iced tea.
The service was friendly, which one might expect, though I still feel bad about the number of times I kept trying to view my server&#39;s cleavage as she wrote down my order.

 Hmmm,  can you go here and not be a pig?

Yes, if you really like the food and at least attempt to give your server eye contact while she asks you what you want. However, if you have Tourette&#39;s Syndrome Do Not Even Try to eat here. You won&#39;t make it past the door before you offend. Yep. Love those wings &amp; things. :)"

The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is comfortable. People just enjoying themselves, especially if there&#39;s a good sports game going on. It&#39;s family friendly, especially during the day. The other day we went to see a soccer game here. I had called in advance to make sure they were airing it and they answered yes right away. There was a nice crowd which included several families and their little kids. The staff had a huge screen for the game and even offered us another screen if we wanted to sit somewhere else. We finished our meal before the game was over but we never felt rushed to pay or leave.

The waitstaff is always friendly (even to another woman). Have never gotten attitude from any of the girls who work here.

Looking forward to seeing some of the World Cup soccer games here."

The scantily-clad young ladies (TK&#39;s main &#34;selling point&#34;) who were serving that day were pleasant enough, but a short exchange with the &#34;general manager&#34; left me wondering exactly whose brother-in-law he was. 

This gentleman (and I use the term loosely) was cold and unfriendly, almost to the point of being rude. I would understand his dismissive attitude if the place was busy and he had his hands full, but that was definitely NOT the case around 3-ish on a weekday afternoon. 

After trying to engage him with a couple of intelligent, business-related questions about the facility he &#34;manages&#34;, I discovered that he was relatively ignorant of the &#34;nuts &amp; bolts&#34; of his establishment. While attempting to get some clarity by rewording my inquiry in a more simplistic manner, he simply gave me a disgusted look,  turned on his heel and walked off in the direction of his private office, closing the door behind him. 

Clearly customer service is NOT a priority with this franchise&#39;s management. If this &#34;manager&#34; treats his employees the way he treated myself and my associates (ALL in the hospitality business), I can only expect there is a rapid employee turnover rate, which usually results in low morale and inferior service. This can only be good news for the several other similar &#34;sports bar&#34;-type places in that area, of which there are MANY.

With that said. I trust the &#34;free market&#34; will finish this place off in due time."

My staple at the &#39;Kilt is the black and blue burger, as rare as they&#39;ll do it, with garlic fries that are then doused in the bottle of malt vinegar sitting on every table. You really can&#39;t go wrong, and you&#39;d be hard pressed to find a better burger for $10 (plus whatever the garlic fries up-charge is) in the area.

Unfortunately, the typical clientele of Tilted Kilt basically ruins it for me. If you haven&#39;t figured it out by now, Tilted Kilt is one of those places in the same vein as Hooters in that it&#39;s not -quite- a strip club, but the way the waitresses dress and the patrons behave, it might as well be. When you&#39;re seated, your scantily clad waitress will come bouncing over, and give you her requisite fake name which is handily written on a coaster so you can refer back to it if you forget. From there, it seems to be typical to do one of the following things- (And yes, I&#39;ve seen/heard all of this through various trips.)

1. Sit in the corner and creepily read a George R. R. Martin novel, sweating profusely and breathing deeply, while taking a break from reading to lock your gaze on whatever waitress is walking near you. Bonus points for extra-expressive facial movements, lip licking, and nods of approval as you scan the room.

2. Hang out with your 3-4 other middle aged married man friends in your finest worry-free polo and elastic gusseted khakis discussing Android devices and Google&#39;s open app ecosystem while taking breaks in the conversation to either proposition your waitress and/or tell your equally sex-starved companions what you&#39;d do to said waitress, loudly.

3. Bring your entire little league team in to mob the Golden Tee machine while you and your dozen over-involved father figures who are vicariously living through their respective sons get krunked on Miller Lite. Then once you&#39;ve completely overstayed your welcome, take photos with your children and the Tilted Kilt waitresses.

4. Bring your wife to sit around and visibly reach levels of discomfort never seen before as you make constant eye contact with your waitresses&#39; chest like you&#39;re staring directly into the hypnotizing gaze of Sir Hiss from Disney&#39;s 1973 release of Robin Hood.

5. Aggressively play Golden Tee, complete with the back-four-feet-away windup before slamming the trackball into the next century, unaware of the fact that doing this doesn&#39;t make  your virtual golfer drive the ball any farther. Then be really angry when your weirdly elaborate wind-up results in landing directly in a sand trap. ...And then realize you just pumped more money into a golf video game than it would&#39;ve cost you to just play 18 holes of golf in the real world.

6. Get really REALLY into whatever sports game is currently on, shouting, yelling, and cursing refs, umps, and the opposing team regardless of how valid the sporting events which just transpired happen be.

...And so, so much more. Tilted Kilt is a veritable feast of people watching. Bring your kids, bring your wife, bring your children&#39;s baseball team. Because that&#39;s totally the thing to do, I guess. Me? I&#39;ll be enjoying my burger and beer, watching the spectacle."

Dinner before a movie at the Imax.  Our initial intent was to go to Cabana Charley&#39;s, to our shock it&#39;s now closed.  Thus started the great debate of reasonably priced food we can be served in under an hours&#39; time.  Or options appeared to be Tilted Kilt or BW3.  The deciding factor, at least we knew Tilted Kilt had reliable food options.  This was my second visit to this location... the first time was for my Brother&#39;s birthday shortly after it opened.  Considering my partner and I are both female, this was also going to be a curious experiment as well.  How was our server going to treat us?  Refer to my review of the Brick House... experience has shown that establishments geared towards appeasing men don&#39;t take kindly to tables without men... even the Sapphic kind are turn offs to waitresses at these establishments.  My partner was betting we&#39;d be the only females not in plaid skirts... turns out there were two other (incredibly bored looking) women joining their male counterparts seated around the restaurant.  Otherwise, testosterone filled all glued to college football hooting and hollering at plays.  

Our waitress sure flipped my idea about the service we would receive.  While we were seated in the darkest section in the restaurant with no one around us (moderately offensive BTW), our server greeted us with a warm smile and prompt service.  The food was fairly good - Garlic fries are awesome - I ordered my burger medium and it came out well done.  I didn&#39;t complain as I believe any burger with a fried egg is delicious.  My partner ordered the blackened chicken flatbread - it was so loaded she had to eat it with a fork and knife.

Our server was a little less than knowledgeable about the beer menu... she was bailed out of my questions by another waitress who overheard the conversation.  I did inquire if she knew when Cabana Charley&#39;s closed... she seemed a bit disappointed when we revealed that was our original target, not the TK.

Overall, I respect this place for what it is.  It&#39;s not my usual &#39;cup of tea&#39; as I hate being alienated by any establishment... however, I came in here believing it would be a less than par experience... but left being a bit surprised."

   I had the kilt burner wings and found them to be tasty and most of them were cooked to a nice crisp. I did, however, have a few that were pretty much WAY over cooked. The taste of the wings was enough to compensate for a couple of over cooked ones though. The sauce was hot, but not very hot considering these were their hottest wings. Nothing challenge worthy, but still had a little heat. I also had a couple of $4 20oz green miller lights. They were cold and full. What else is to be said?

The only thing I think this place holds onto is girls in skimpy outfits.  The food was very salt and greasy.  There was not a whole lot of flavor to anything.  Putting girls in skimpy outfits doesn&#39;t make the place worth going to me.  I normally love potatoes but the ones from here had way to much butter and very little flavor.

I&#39;ve been to a few Tilted Kilts and you typically know what to expect which is decent food a good craft beer selection and some pretty ladies showing some leg, belly and if you&#39;re lucky a couple other sights worth seeing. Unlike Hooters theres no brown pantyhose or awful orange shorts and unlike Hooters half the girls aren&#39;t pregnant. (dont know why this is but I suspect it has to do with the benefits package but that&#39;s neither here nor there). This TK is top notch. Good food and friendly waitstaff. Anjelica with a &#34;J&#34; was especially professional, talkative and a pleasure to be served by. All I expect from my waitress is a smile, attentive service and a pleasant demeanor and being easy on the eyes doesn&#39;t hurt either and she was all of the above. I gotta get my wife one of these TK Waitress outfits to rock around the house as I think it would make coming home after work more fun and I might start tipping her better. 

BTW: I recommend the Fish Taco and the DuPont Saison"

As everyone else said, this place is kinda like Hooters.  The waitresses are very young and very pretty and very scantily-clad, and if I were a guy, I would probably be very happy sitting here as they chatted me up.

The food is so meh I can&#39;t even remember it.

This place was one of the first places I realized I was getting older... In my younger years, I would have cringed going into a place like this, even with a large group of friends.  Now, however, it was December, and the place was an icebox and super drafty, and those servers looked disturbingly hypothermic in their teeny outfits.  My first words in this place were to the little server, &#34;Aren&#39;t you cold...?&#34;  Yeah, I almost added the word, &#34;...sweetie,&#34; at the end.  That would really have made me old, so I&#39;m glad I refrained.

Really, I spent all dinner wishing I could give her a sweater and a hamburger,  poor dear.  That being said, she probably wouldn&#39;t have made nearly as much in tips with my LL Bean hoodie on her...

Kids these days.

Anyway, fun if you&#39;re a guy, or if you&#39;re one of those chicks who wants to be the &#34;cool girlfriend,&#34; and impress your guy and his buddies by taking him out here to show him how confident you are in yourself or whatever."

This place is known for it&#39;s eye candy and in that aspect, it did not disappoint in the least. The food here was decent too. I ordered a burger and onion rings. The burger was very tasty and cooked perfectly. The onion rings were a bit on the soggy side but not inedible by any means. 

The place had the music on a little louder than I typically like but they were playing good tunes so I really didn&#39;t mind at all. Our server did a goo job taking care of us until we were ready to leave. She seemed to disappear when it came to find her for the check.

Overall, it is worth a return visit!"

I&#39;d only been to the downtown Chicago location before. I was greeted promptly with a smile and shown quickly to a table, and a server came by shortly and told me today&#39;s specials. All of this was in a quick, courteous manner with a smile.

I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with garlic fries, they came out quicker than I expected and were great. The chicken was juicy, the bread fresh, the veggie toppings delicious, and the fries crisp and tasty. My only nitpick was that the bottom of the fry basket had a little puddle of garlic/grease, like maybe the cook had spilled a glop of it which soaked the last few fries. Not a big deal at all by any means. I definitely appreciated the large-sized iced tea with free refills, too. No lame 12oz glasses.

I wasn&#39;t keeping track, but my visit there was between 30 and 40 minutes. In that time I had a friendly greeter show me to a table, a terrific waitress take care of me quickly and personably (Anjelica, who looked angelic despite her Halloween devil horns), and excellent-tasting food at the right price.

Their waitresses are really friendly to the male customers, but seem to snub the female customers.  It&#39;s like, really?  Just because I&#39;m a girl doesn&#39;t mean you should be rude to me.  The guys I bring in are going to have to listen to me complain about you being rude, therefore, that tip you were working so hard to score from them, just got downsized because of how you acted towards me.

They serve Blacksmiths which always makes the hubby very happy! 

I had the Scottish Cheesesteak which was good. I&#39;ve had better, but it wasn&#39;t bad. My dad and the hubby both had the Irish Stew and both liked it a lot.

1. Too Effing Loud - I went here for dinner after watching a movie at the Cinemark with my boyfriend, but couldn&#39;t discuss the movie over dinner because this place was Too Effing Loud.

2. Expensive Beer - The waitress/wench/server will tell you their beer specials without the price. The menus don&#39;t list beer prices either - haha. In fact, the beer specials were only written down next to the hostess station when we walked in, and a Miller Lite for $3 is not a deal, hun, so try to scam someone else.

3. Gross Food - Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I ordered a shepherd&#39;s pie, and I could tell the potatoes were from a powder mix. POWDER MIX. The meat was also scarce. It was basically a 1-inch layer of powder mix potatoes, the thinnest layer imaginable of ground beef and peas, then another 2-inch layer of powder mix potatoes. I foraged around in my food and ate the meat layer and was done eating in 2 minutes. 

I didn&#39;t want to call the manager to complain about this failure of meal because my boyfriend was treating me to dinner, and I didn&#39;t want to make a scene.

My boyfriend only finished his food after pouring a CUP of Parmesan cheese over it, which leads me to believe that his dish 1. also sucked and 2. he also didn&#39;t want to cause a scene. Gosh, we&#39;re so compatible. 

4. Too Effing Loud - I need to mention this one again because I still have a headache. WHY the hell was it so loud in there?

5. Extremely exposed hostess/waitress - This place tries to invoke Britney Spears&#39;s &#34;Baby One More Time&#34; music video with plaid miniskirts, white knee socks, small, white shirt that exposes a bra and barely legal girls. Jesus Christ. 

It&#39;s clear to me that the founder of this restaurant was watching &#34;Baby One More Time,&#34; and thought, &#34;Golly, wouldn&#39;t it be great to have a restaurant with a bunch of half-dressed waitresses who dress like that?&#34;

6. Young clientele - Someone please tell me why a bunch of parents brought their kids here for dinner? This is no Chili&#39;s or even a Miller&#39;s Ale House. This place is overflowing with boobs and beer. It should not be admitting children.

Overall, I was thoroughly disgusted with the amount of cleavage hanging over my food and drink, the loud atmosphere and quality of the food. Hooters is light years better than this place. Hell, Miller&#39;s Ale House is light years better than this place, and I think that place is bleh."

This location in Woodridge is in the Seven Bridges Complex, near the Movie Theater.  There is also a Sushi Restaurant, Italian Restaurant, Buffalo Wild Wings, Cabana Grill and some other places.  The restaurant is in a new building, and it&#39;s a very nice set-up.  There is plenty of seating, great space around the large bar and flat screen TV&#39;s everywhere you look.  Overall impression of the layout and decor is 5 Stars.

The first thing you notice when you walk in the place are &#39;Boobs&#39;.  There are boobs everywhere, staring you in the face.  The hostess counter had 3-4 girls wearing their push up bras and showing most of the cleavage....the uniforms are nice, but SMALL.  So, if you are a guy and like looking at young women&#39;s breasts, this is the place for you.  The second thing that stands out about the staff is that most of the women have tattoos.  Tramp stamps, tattoos on their backs, hips, some on their shoulders.  I didn&#39;t realize how popular tattoos were with women.  Let&#39;s face it, with the skimpy uniforms, it&#39;s hard to hide anything.  Most of the women are attractive enough to wear this attire, but a few really didn&#39;t have any business showing off their midriff, or entire stomache for that matter.  

Service was good, pretty attentive.  I think I got lucky and got one of the more intelligent servers.  She was able to describe items on the menu, recommend some appetizers, and knew the beer selection.  

The food was good.  Only thing keeping me from rating 5 Stars is that the burger sure wasn&#39;t &#39;Medium&#39;.  My burger came out of the kitchen in about 5 minutes, I think they burger patties continuously cooking on set aside, because 2x not the burger has been closer to well done.  The size is great, 10oz, and a good bun.  Bacon on top was very good.  

Onion Rings - best I&#39;ve ever had.  Yes, they are awesome. 

The venue, the decor, the location, the menu and the bar/beer selection, along with dozens of flat screen TV&#39;s and a few projectors are reason enough to visit this place.  Throw in 20 young women showing off their BOOBS all over the place, and well........you get the picture."

Clientele ratio was about 3:1 men to women. - pretty much as expected.  

Decor was fun, lots of TVs, too.

The food was served very quickly for such a busy time - I was pleasantly surprised.  I wasn&#39;t expecting to really REALLY like the food.

- This place is like a Hooter&#39;s and then some, combined with your average sports bar like Fox and the Hound, Friday&#39;s, and those type of places.  &#39;Stereo-typically very attractive&#39; girls (I use the term &#39;sterotypically attractive&#39;, because there are always those guys that will try to convince you that women who are 350 pounds with ratty hair, glasses, and bad smiles or  teeth are &#39;also beautiful&#39;.  Not a knock on those people, just reality in today&#39;s world where even the channel 9 news and the Disney channel places emphasis on how one must look pleasing to the eyes...so hence the &#39;stereotypically attractive&#39; term) between maybe 20-30 years old with either gym perfect or plastic surgery perfect bodies, enhanced breasts (either by surgery, or push-up bra), and dressed semi-provocatively who are waitresses or door girls.

- A &#39;Family Restuarant&#39;, but by my standards, I am unsure how this could be.  Now, I am FARRR from one of those prude or &#34;feminist&#34; or &#39;guy who looks at nobody but his wife or gf&#39; type people, but I wouldn&#39;t even see this place fit for high school kids.  By chance, the night we were there, there must have been high school &#39;Homecoming&#39; dances nearby, and there were many groups of dressed-up hs guys and girls - probably not the best place for this type of event.  The place does place huge emphasis on T&amp;A (literally), as if that was all the waitresses (or women in general) represent and/or are worthy of....

- Burgers are actually very good.  Fries, not so good.  So-so prices, better food than Hooter&#39;s, in my opinion.  Then again, in my opinion, Hooter&#39;s is cool, but also wayyyy overrated...

- Beer - over-priced.  My party was complaining that the beers were expensive. Didn&#39;t affect me though, as I quit drinking.

- Very loud -- between the music, televisions, and loud people.  Hard to talk without &#39;shouting&#39;, even to my people at my own table.

- A good percentage of the guys I saw there (trying not to be overly judgemental, as I have only been there once, and by my own admission I am no Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt) - you can kinda tell why they are there -- just to get an eyeful.  It doesn&#39;t take a genius to tell that just by looking at them, many of the guys probably haven&#39;t had, or are seldom around, stereotypically attractive girls.  It was funny to sit back and watch them BLATANTLY stare, try to hit on their own waitresses, crack jokes, whistle, and basically just make a scene and make themselves look dumber than they already are.  (Note to guys:  Most girls do not like that crap nor find it a turn-on...)  This was also going on as regular families and 8 -year-old children sat nearby (see my comment above about how I felt this wasn&#39;t appropriate for children..)

- Service overall was pretty good.  Perhaps we just had a very good waitress, though.

- I would recommend, but this may not be the place for the more conservative-type of person or family.  I do not recommend families with children come here."

The food is fairly good for the type of establishment.  Lots of options from Burgers to Pizza to Irish classics.  Be sure to try the nachos.  They are HUGE and great.  We always order these.  Sometimes we order them twice in one sitting.  The food is reasonably priced.

The &#34;talent&#34; is also quite good at this location.  They servers are friendly and attentive.  I&#39;ve been to two other locations (Chicago and Chicago Ridge) and the Woodridge talent far surpasses those.

It was juicy and cooked just how I asked. Some of the girls were cute, but others were a bit anorexic looking. I tried to hook up my guy friend with our waitress by writing a little note on our bill. She wasn&#39;t offended at all. In fact, she was really nice but declined cuz she&#39;s engaged. Can&#39;t hurt to try right? Anyway, great place for good food!

I had the chicken tender wrap which was very good, although I admit it&#39;s hard to mess that up.  My friend ordered the smothered chicken and said it was one of the best meals he&#39;s had in a while.  We ordered their signature beer ($4) which was very good also.

My only complaint is that our waitress could have been a bit more friendly and outgoing.  She was too &#34;business&#34; and in a rush for my liking.

Beer selections are decent,
Drink specials are spot on for a suburb,
Food is typical of average bars,

So, this isn&#39;t a place to go with your girlfriends for girls night out, or a place to go with anyone that you would feel uncomfortable looking at mostly naked women, (parents, girlfriend/boyfriend, co-workers) but I suppose that every once in awhile it isn&#39;t that bad.  It seems that they have good drink specials - though not a beer drinker, I didn&#39;t have anything.  The food was okay - pretty standard pub food, I had a BBQ pork sandwich that wasn&#39;t 1/2 bad.  I also had a skillet cookie dessert that was pretty good - but I&#39;ve had better at other places.

Food - 3 stars 

Service - 2 stars 

When teens ask for burgers and fries after a long day of shopping, Red Robin was on the brain so we made a beeline to the closest one. Needless to say, they knew their order before we sat down or before we pulled into the parking lot. So, we ordered quickly. 

One of them was relatively thirsty which means the lemonade was drank in no time. Our server said she bring another and never did. And we never received any water. The burgers arrived and I then noticed we were without a knife and napkins. Additionally, the person who dropped off the food noticed my sweet potato fries looked as if someone had eaten most before they were dropped off. 

It took a bit longer for the lemonade refill, a while for a normal serving of fries. I ultimately walked over to the bar to get napkins and silverware on my own. After all, the food was getting cold. 

You can use the screen at your table to pay for your meal which explains why service is sort of DIY. .... Perhaps a self fountain drink machine and utensil station are things to come."

I got a kick out of the black and white photo of a Greenwich Village street sign hanging on the wall. It was Bleeker Street,  two blocks from where my mother still lives. Ironically,  this restaurant is located in a little stretch of Warrenville wilderness that Mom would find positively soul-crushing.

This Red Robin is absolute perfection. We were immediately seated in a booth, which automatically gets a restaurant one star in my book. I asked our waitress, Maggie, about the Orange Cream Soda because I thought that was a strange thing. Her description was the most incredible way of saying &#34;It tastes like a dreamcycle&#34; that I have ever heard. I did not get it because I have no balls, and I just wanted my Sprite.

Our appetizer comes, chips and chili-queso. Honestly, at this point, I&#39;m not paying much attention to taste as much as I am paying attention to the sheer volume of food I can cram in my eating hole. That experience alone was enjoyable, 10/10. When chips ran out, my table panicked. The chips are gone, but there is still queso. Are there refills on chips? We decide to ask Maggie, Maggie gives two thumbs up, we celebrate as she goes back to the kitchen. This is where s#% gets nuts.

A man stops at our table and gives us chips. This man is not Maggie, and he&#39;s just wearing flannel like a casual mf&#39;er. Using our brains, we decide this is either the manager or the owner of this particular Red Robin location. We also decide that this guy is cool af. He goes to tables, taking orders and kicking ass. Real hands on guy that was super kind to us and brought me some honey mustard for my chicken strips, which he also brought.

You might be thinking to yourself, the manager has to pick up Maggie&#39;s slack? Nah. Maggie and manager bro tag teamed our table like a two dollar hoe. Food is great, fresh, and hot. The other four stars of course come from the bottomless fries. Eat as many as you want. Puke and eat more then repeat. Stuff your pockets when you go home, it&#39;s bottomless fries mothuhfrickah."

I usually get the whiskey river chicken sandwich and she is always getting something different. The service is fast, and I love the bottomless steak fries. They have a variety of sauces from black pepper ketchup, garlic mayo, campfire sauce, to name a few. 
The drinks options are fun and always good. Use caution, they are very sugary and could easily open up the gates to diabetes.

guess we r too old to go in a place like that little black Box on the table THAT SHE DIDNT EXPLAIN I started playing w the games on it to bide my time.   When ppl were seated next to us they were told it was. $2 charge to play the games. I had to complain to the mgr to get that money taken off our bill
Waitress diss appeared after we were seated didn&#39;t know we were supposed to press the button on the box to get a waitstaff     To get refill drinks u needed to press another button.  The whole time we watched them all gabbing in the back 
Then u had to check out and pay with AGAIN  that black box.   And IT had the nerve to automatically give that disappearing waitress 20% 
Last time we were at RR it was in PHX  when we sat down they IMMEDIATELY brought a good size bowl of fries.  Now they said u had to order a burger  
fries didn&#39;t come w my $11 salad !!!
And when my husband did get his fries there were 8 of them  when he asked for more they brought 7 more!!!   CHEAPSKATES"

I went during lunch and just stuck to the lunch menu, trying to keep my costs down, but still ended up paying 19 bucks. So be weary that there are cheaper options out there.

On this occasion I got the chicken caesar wrap with clam chowder soup. Clam chowder was the one recommended by my server. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m complaining about this, but I thought it had too much clam. My other friend works at a different Red Robin and she said the chicken tortilla is their best one so I must try that next time. The wrap was good, had a burger the night before which is why I didn&#39;t get one this time and that was probably a dumb choice but oh well.

Got the freckled lemonade which is why my total was bumped up to 19 but I think I got my moneys worth. Probably had about 3 of those which is good, but also bad with the amount of sugar that&#39;s probably in that bad boy.

My burger was still pink inside, after asking for well done and was missing half of the ingredients that I had requested. I had also told our waiter that I had a to-go order to put in but would wait until the food came out. She didn&#39;t bring the food out and it took us waiving her down 10 minutes after we received our food to put the order in. 

After complaining about the burger, she offered to make me a new one to take with me since I had to get back to work, which was definitely appreciated. I half expected to have the manager come speak with me, but I was given a dirty look and never talked to. Stay away from this joint!"

My experience was so bad that I felt compelled to come here and post it as a review over a year after the actual experience. Here&#39;s what happened: 2 friends and I (~26 years old) show up for lunch on a Sunday to get some burgers, drinks and watch a Blackhawks game. When we arrive, we are seated in the closest booth to the door despite a mostly vacant atmosphere (two or three 40-50 year old groups). Like I mentioned, it is January so we have quite the draft coming through and are very uncomfortable. The server comes over and we all place our drinks order (3 beers and 3 waters) and an order for an onion appetizer, as well as ask for them to put the Blackhawks game on. Our server says they will comply to the hockey request and process the order. 

15 minutes pass and we have received no drinks or food. We contact the server again and repeat the order, as well as the TV request. About 5 minutes following this re-order and subsequent apology, we are served our appetizer. We start to eat, but quickly all get thirsty and realize we have no drinks. Also, the Blackhawks game has started while SportsCenter remains the viewing program on all TVs. The server comes back around for round 3 and this time we start asking questions: &#39;where are our drinks?&#39; (we are so thirsty) &#39;what happened to the Blackhawks game?&#39; (score of game scrolls by on bottom line). As we are asking questions, another server comes up to our current server and asks if current server needs help. He insists everything is all and well and that he needs no help. He leaves the table without saying anything to us. 

Somehow the bartender gets the message to make the beers, pours all 3, and leaves them on the counter to be served. The next 10 minutes are brutal, mainly due to our extreme thirst. We still have not received waters or beers, and we can actually see the beers sitting on the counter across the restaurant. Our server is just bouncing between the other 2-3 tables and has completely forgot about us, for the third time. While this is going on, the bartender realizes these beers have been poured for 8 minutes but not served. The head of the beer has dissipated and the beer glasses look 2-3 oz empty as a result. I will never forget what happens next; the bartender puts straws in the beers and stirs them so that foam will be reproduced, and to make the beers look full once again! Quite hilariously terrible actually. I tell this part of the story all the time because this is such a heinous act - destroying a poor beer to make it look full again. 

We flag down our server for the 4th and final meeting. He arrives and asks, &#34;Can I take your order?&#34; We almost burst out laughing. &#34;No thanks. We will just take a check for the onion.&#34; He now realizes that we have been there for 30 minutes and have received no drinks (waters are nowhere to be seen... at least we saw the beers). He looks back at the stirred beers and asks if we want them. We kindly suggest that we do not want the beers any longer. He goes through apology round #2, we tell him its OK, he gets the check, and we leave to go to Chipotle on the way home. I&#39;ve never bought a drink from Chipotle for a to-go order before but I did on this occasion due to the whole thirst situation from the Red Robin. The Chipotle was great per usual, but just could not make up for the extreme thirst, lack of entertainment, and overall poor experience that I received going here. I give this one star instead of 0 because it made for funny restaurant horror stories over the past year. Never again going to a Red Robin."

This was my first time coming to a Red Robin...I know...sad. Now I know why they are so famous for their burgers and bottomless fries. My friend and I came here after doing some holiday shopping. We both got burgers which were good and I had the bottomless sweet fries and he had regular fries. Two things were off-putting about this place. First, the portion of fries that comes with the meal is small which leads people to ask for more. The second portion is almost three times bigger. The problem is when they &#34;run out of fries and need to make more.&#34; My friend waited about 30 minutes until we decided to leave. He is still waiting for those fries. The second problem was the waitress, Kimberlee. She was horrible. She was absent and when I asked about the elusive fries she snapped at me.

I have been there many times and I really like their burgers and fries. The staff there is super friendly and helpful and they have great customer service. I went there with a couple of friends once and my friend orderd a burger, but got a different one served. He only noticed it half way through (actually more than that :-)) and then mentioned it. They were so kind to give him his actual order for free to go, even though he basically ate the whole other dish. That was very nice.

The only thing that would make it a 5 star rating for me is, if they had a different supplier for their guten-free buns. They are not so tasty and usually I get my burgers lettuce wrapped instead."

It&#39;s a burger loaded with onion straws, lettuce, tomatoes, and BBQ sauce. The one thing I love about Red Robin is their steak fries because they are bottomless, meaning, free refills on the fries. The fries are seasoned and the seasoning is also on the table.

I do like that they have healthy alternatives. I got the salmon sandwich wrapped in a lettuce wrap and substituted fries with a salad. No charge. Bad thing about their lettuce wrap was it was too thick - too much lettuce. I tore off some peices but then ended up eating my sandwich in a mess, coudln&#39;t even hold it up.

First off, the staff is usually pretty friendly. That&#39;s the best thing I can say about Red Robin. The restaurants themselves are pretty...ehhhhhhh...well they&#39;re clean. But the decor, the atmosphere, everything is just a pit. 

So now on to the food. I have tried the beef burgers and the chicken sandwiches here and they all share one common them - mediocrity. They try to be inventive with their burgers...that&#39;s great, but only if you don&#39;t replace taste with inventiveness. They do. They&#39;re like that hot girl in high school - they try to get by on their looks because they have no personality or brains, and you don&#39;t find that out until it&#39;s too late.

- Freckled lemonade for the husband with free refills, check. {*total ripoff, but sometimes he&#39;s a sucker for that sort of thing.}

What&#39;s not to love? I am seriously convinced that this place has the best burger setup of anywhere I&#39;ve been lately! I&#39;m not even kidding. My husband also had an Oktoberfest burger with dijon-covered sauteed onions, ham, romaine, burger patty, swiss cheese on a brioche (pretzel) bun. So incredible. 

The prices are a bit high, but you get unlimited fries and they always seem to have freebies if you&#39;re into that! We attempted to hit up the Wheaton location and BAM, the sign on the door said, closed! They closed the day before FOR GOOD! Off to Diehl we went. With my freebie burger for my birthday, our bill came to just over $12. Seriously. We obvi tipped on the full amount (as you should with any discount), but how can you beat that with waiter service?

I enjoyed it; I didn&#39;t LOVE it. I did love that even with the upgrades and a giant, strong Mai Tai that I only paid $20.

So while I still prefer Smashburger for a burger, I can only get beer there. Red Robin has a full bar and the Tiki Drinks are affordable ($7 or less).

I ordered food at 9:40 I showed up at 9:50 and the doors were locked so I started knocking as employees walked past and stared at me. The door said open until 10pm. I reached in my pocket to call and realized my phone was in the car. So now I walked back to my car got my phone and my first call was at 9:55 there phones were turned off. Hmmm so now I have two choices leave with out the food or stand and knock on the door that should be opened. Finally some one opened the door with an attitude like a what do you want attitude? I got my food and and asked for a manager. I asked why you would lock the doors before close when you knew someone was picking up their food. His reply was I just locked the door and our phone was not off. I called him on speaker and the phones were certainly off. He also said I knew you where coming because I made the food myself. Which was a direct indication he was unhappy with my late order. I did not know what time they closed and if it was such a nuisance they shouldn&#39;t take the order and close earlier. I wasn&#39;t planning on complaining about my experience until I got home and realized the order was not right probably because they cleaned up the kitchen early and did not want to get things dirty.

The first time I tried it was 8 years ago in Southern California. It was the only place near our hotel that wasn&#39;t a chain they have here. Well we loved it so when we got home we looked it up and low and behold: they do have them here. Of the few in the Chicago area that I have been to, this location is my favorite. No particular reason, we just always seem to have a better time here. 

I love the Royal burger. It is anything but good for you. That&#39;s probably why it&#39;s so good. Before I tried the Royal I was making my way through the menu trying different things. Everything I tried was good. One day I went with my aunt and we wanted to try something new so we asked our waitress her favorite and she told us the Royal. Both of us have stayed loyal ever since. 

Also, their fries are so damn good and they&#39;re bottomless so go hungry!"

Let me briefly explain my day prior to entering this restaurant. I had been at the hospital the entire day with my Dad and Grandma because my Mom had surgery. My best friend came to take me out of the hospital to dinner. I was starving and had barely eaten all day and it was almost 9pm on a Tuesday night.

After walking out of the previous restaurant, walking into Red Robin felt like a breath of fresh air. They acknowledged us as SOON as we walked in and were friendly and attentive the ENTIRE time we were there. Our food was made and brought to us within minutes. We were only 2 of maybe 10 other people in the entire restaurant. I left them a BIG tip. I enjoy their fare and I&#39;ve always had good service at Red Robin every time I&#39;ve gone there.

Second, it&#39;s great for quick food.  I love the clam chowder and the chicken fingers and fries.  These are now my favorite chicken fingers out there.  The perfect amount of breading that has a delightful taste!

Third, it&#39;s not pricey, very couple friendly.  The husband and I do sodas or teas, a meal each and sometime an appetizer and don&#39;t even break $30 after tax.  That&#39;s way more affordable than some other places we like to frequent."

In High School, which isn&#39;t too far behind, I visited this location NUMEROUS times before and after movies. It is one of my favourite chain restaurants and I have always been satisfied. For some odd reason, I went without Red Robin for a good 4 years. I have recently changed that. This location is always clean, fast paced, and friendly. I went here two times within two weeks about a month ago. GUILTY. The two times were on weekend night (Fri/Sat). The first Friday visit had a very short wait and we were given fast and friendly service.

I tend to get the Crispy chicken tender salad, which should always be accompanied by the sweet poppyseed honey mustard dressing. This salad is effing huge. It&#39;s like, excessive. I remember back in the day when they were little sweetie pies and had half sizes available for this salad. This was righteous; I consumed just as much, more was gone from my plate, and I was paying less. Oh well, now I&#39;m forced with a true battle each time it arrives. Me versus &#39;THE SALAD!. You could split anyone of their salads. I am head over heels for the little bread squares they give you along side of the salad. Of course, the biggest downside to this is that you don&#39;t get those delicious bottomless steak fries that come with numerous menu items, you will have to order these separately. PLEASE, ORDER THEM, then pick up that cute little bottle called &#34;house seasonings&#34; and sprinkle a bit on top. You will dig it.

Their burgers are good, but I&#39;ve only had bites of the burgers that belonged to the past people I have gone with. Blue Ribbon Burger and Whiskey River BBQ stand out most to me and would be the ones I&#39;d order for myself. I love their clucks and fries and they are often my next choice if I don&#39;t get my salad. If I get the clucks and fries, I get a cup of their tortilla soup which is delicious. Oh, that huge onion ring stack? Are there three people at your table? Good talk, ORDER THEM.  Their freckled lemonade is also a divine option, along with most other drinks on their menu that includes some sort of pureed deliciousness at the bottom of the beverage. The problem? That it is like $5...I don&#39;t know, that&#39;s just too much for me to pay for something like that. Knock that down to $2.50 and you&#39;ve got yourself a deal.

Overall, I end up throwing Red Robin into the mix here and there when trying to conjure up restaurant ideas. If you&#39;re in the area before a movie and want some American Fanfare, snag a bite. You better not forget your balloon on the way out. Common, there is no age limit on balloons, don&#39;t feel sheepish, grab your favourite colour and get outta there! OH and writing this review, totally is making me crave some Red Robin."

If you don&#39;t have kids, don&#39;t bother.  But wait, the burgers are good, the chicken is ok (over-seasoned, but what the heck) and my husband got a decent fish fry.  On Tuesday evenings the Red Robin is there in person to scare the toddlers, but older kids like it.  We&#39;ve been there twice, and our servers (Jill and Jen) were perfectly attentive.  If the kids want to go, that&#39;s good by me.  A family of four will spend about $35-40 including tip.  Most burger or chicken meals are $8-9.  You can be sure you still lived a full life if you never make it here though.

I had the fish and chips, my wife had a burger and my 5 yr old ordered Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was warm around the edges and ice cold and very watery in the center. She only took one bite. My wife&#39;s burger was fine but half of my fish was raw. I spoke to the manager and asked if they put a piece of ice in the Mac and cheese to cool it off as I explained our problem. He said they would never do that on purpose then got very defensive and kept repeating that it would never happen &#34;on purpose.&#34;  No replacement or remedy was offered. RR used to be great about correcting any issues, especially with kids meals. Very disappointed with this location and it&#39;s management. Our server, Fonzie, yes Fonzie, was nice but couldn&#39;t find the manager after the food came out and we noticed the floating macaroni in ice water.

My entree included a chicken breast. What I received was a SLIVER of chicken. This was the tiniest chicken breast I&#39;ve ever seen. It may as well have been a chicken nugget. The rest of the entree wasn&#39;t too great, either.

However, this particular location SUCKS.  We&#39;ve been here a lot of times, and while most of the time the service is at the very most adequate, the last few times I have been awful. The food always comes out quickly, but fat chance getting your server to come back to refill your drink, or get you some more ranch or ketchup. It&#39;s always freezing, and a lot of the booths come loose while you sit in them.  
The last time we were there, I chose a new thing to order, which was the sirloin sliders, and after two bites, realized this was a mistake. It came with these fries that had cheese and were DRENCHED in oil. After waiting for at least 10 minutes for my server to come back to my table, I asked if I could have something else, and my server sent over the manager. He was nice enough and offered to replace my meal with something else. My server seemed worried that the manager was at my table, and proceeded to give us attitude the rest of the time we were there. We were seated next to the bar, and heard at least 4 different servers comment on how I didn&#39;t like what I ordered, and how if I didn&#39;t like it, I shouldn&#39;t have ordered it. It was extremely rude and unprofessional, and while I don&#39;t expect much, I do expect for me to eat my damn food without hearing about how dumb I for attempting to eat something new.

I wouldn&#39;t recommend this location, but the one in Wheaton is pretty sweet."

Update: Went there tonight with two friends and we&#39;re happy to see that it was being remodeled. The wow beef was great like always.

What makes matters worse is the bread itself. It&#39;s heavy, dry, lacks a definitive crust and completely overpowers the taste of the sandwich.

It&#39;s actually very basic...the bread and beef must compliment each other. Not here!

Bono&#39;s serves some decent fries, but not good enough to remove the bitter taste of disappointment. A complete lackluster experience for a self proclaimed Beef Joint!"

If you are in the Pub, you walk through the breezeway to Bono&#39;s Beef to get food. If you are in Bono&#39;s Beef, you walk through the breezeway to get into the Pub with your food and tack on a beer. Either way you look at it, these two share the same address and should have the same reviews. 

That said, the food was really nice at Bono&#39;s Beef/Pub. We ordered a grilled chicken sandwich (nice marinade and sandwich), cheese fries (slathered in cheese), a Maxwell Street Polish (add-ons make for a nice sandwich), chicken strips (moist chicken and crunchy breading), and mozzarella sticks (nice thick sticks) ... and all the food was good. Had the BBQ (smoky) and Ranch (peppery) sauces and they were also nice - tangy and just a bit of zing so you&#39;ll remember you had a topping. Don&#39;t usually give out five stars but this place rocks the food side.

When you enter the Beef side it looks just like any other kind of roast beef place - a number of booths, a counter up front where you order, a TV on the wall - you get the picture. If you go through the door on your right, you&#39;ll enter the Pub area - full service bar on the back wall, lots of tables and TVs and a couple of video games. The center room often has live music - with the bar and pub working on either side. 

Never been here for the live stuff, but the food and pub sides go together very nicely. I checked into the Pub but spent my time in the Beef - split personality. You can eat on either side, but I assume the pub is off limits to the little people...nice way to separate them. 

Nice staff...we ordered and forgot two things. They gave them to us anyway with no charge or rolling of the eyes. They have a nice laid back staff that gets the food out. The food isn&#39;t prepared a day ahead of time and waiting on the railing...they make stuff pretty fresh and that was a nice touch. Small wait and very nice food. 

Clean yet old place. Come here for the food and not the décor. Pottys were also nice - had wild cherry soap in the Unisex bathroom...old fixtures but everything works just how it should. This place is a winner. We&#39;ll be back."

Free refills on the soda.

Unfortunate name, as it can be confused with Buena Beef~ which is nowhere near as downhome tribal. Bonos is my idea of great food that is obviously bad for you... in a good way.

The ambiance rates a zero, even in perspective of Chicago joints, they have none of that wall decor or much else, the tv is tuned to soccer games for the staff- but it really doesn&#39;t matter to me- I still come through often enough to screw-up my LDL Cholesterol off the scale.

The reason that they&#39;re not easy to review is that this place is almost like three places. There&#39;s a walk up fast food counter and booths in the eastern most section, a common room for bands and such in the center, and a regular bar with a pool table and some tvs on the west side of the building. They also have a smoking patio outside. I was there for a multi band show and didn&#39;t try the food. 

As a live band venue, I found this place to be lacking. There is no stage, so shorter folks need to be in front of the crowd if they want to see their act perform. I don&#39;t know if the venue provided the sound or one of the bands, but it consisted of two big speakers sitting on the floor on either side of the band area. No speaker stands or wall mounts, no monitor setup, and just the vocals mic&#39;ed up leaving the guitar amps on their own. It sounded like some of the groups were talented but it&#39;s hard to tell when the sound is rubbish. I got home with ringing ears and no idea what any of the song lyrics were. A place that puts on shows and advertises live music on their signage ought to invest in the right equipment and a professional engineer or at least a consultant to teach somebody how to mix it. 

When I wasn&#39;t in the music area trying to enjoy the bands despite the sound, I spent my time at the bar sipping whiskey because the beer selection didn&#39;t appeal to me. If you&#39;re fine with your regular mass produced domestics, there&#39;s something there for you. I&#39;m a snobby craft beer/import guy, and I think the most fancy thing they had on the menu was Fat Tire. They didn&#39;t skimp a bit on the ice in my whiskey glass, and made very sure not to fill it with too much liquor. I didn&#39;t ask for an itemized receipt, but for what the bill came out to I don&#39;t think a full glass would have been too much to ask. I even saw a bartender use that little short measuring cup to ensure that I didn&#39;t get an extra tenth of on ounce of liquor more than what I paid for. 

So, next time one of my favorite local band comes through Bono&#39;s, I think I&#39;ll stay home and wait for them to play some place with professional sound and good beer."

I had never previously been in a Zoup! before, but the cashier was really nice and gave me a rundown of what they had, the different types of combos/meals that were available, as well as offered to let me sample any of the made-in-house soups. Awesome, friendly service here!!

I opted for the Asian salad with a chunk of multigrain bread. Both were delicious! Everything tasted fresh, and the salad blended together very well with the dressing and overall quite good. My only minor criticisms would be that for over $8.50 I would&#39;ve liked to see a little bit more chicken, as there wasn&#39;t that much in mine. 

Some more constructive criticism would be to let customers opt for a slightly larger portion of salad in lieu of the included bread. I say this because as someone who eats and diets cleanly, many customers (including myself) who are looking for a salad are doing so for the low-carb benefit of said salad. By including a piece of bread, it effectively adds carbs to an otherwise low-carb meal. Of course you could just simply choose not to eat the bread, or to give it away or save it for a cheat meal or something, but I personally will never let anything go to waste. Just an idea!

Overall my meal was very good and I will certainly be back to try more salads and eventually the soups!"

I used to work in the loop, and my co-worker told me about Zoup, but I never got there for lunch.  I did notice there are two of these out in the west burbs and FINALLY got to one yesterday.

- Where did one go to see what soups were offered?
- Was there a special spot to ask for a taste?
- How about the line, where did it start? Which side of the register? It was really hard to tell.
 Yes- I can be a pain, but... talk about a confused mass of people.

Despite it all, the employees were pretty outstanding. They were all friendly and helpful.
The soup itself was good for the price! For less than 10$ I had a full meal, needed a nap and had my taste buds tweaked! I had the lobster bisque in a bread bowl as I wanted all of my carbohydrates for the week in one sitting.

Most of the soups I&#39;ve tried (and I&#39;ve had a lot of them), I&#39;d rate a 3 star. The cream of broccoli was a 2 star. --bland and mushy. The chicken pot pie was a 4 star. Pretty good flavor, especially with the pie crust crumbles. I also liked the lobster bisque and the tomato bisque. 

I&#39;ve seen reviews stating stale bread. I&#39;ve never once had that problem. Also, I&#39;ve been there half a dozen times and it&#39;s always been very clean and the staff very friendly. 

While it&#39;s not a restaurant that I would think to go first, I&#39;d still pick it over greasy fast food any day."

I&#39;d say this is a place to go if you&#39;re really craving soup and want a wide variety. It&#39;s not bad but it definitely isn&#39;t the best soup. The variety is is impressive and the fact that they let you sample every soup is very good on their part. The sandwiches here are amazing, though! I had a chicken Toscana sandwich which was very well made. I prefer the sandwiches here over the soup because the quality is so much better. Overall, I&#39;d say Zoup! is a decent place."

I think the ordering system is poor but it isn&#39;t the biggest deal unless you&#39;re in there during a very busy lunch time. The things that I like the most about Zoup is the options and all the different types of soup. All the soups that I have tried are pretty delicious. I tried a turkey club sandwich and it was pretty good but it didn&#39;t wow me.. it definitely was not bad. The one thing about this location in Warrenville / Winfield / Naperville is the service is kind of poor. The manager or boss, whoever he is, seems like a nice guy, but kind of rubbed me the wrong way and just gives me a weird vibe. Again, this probably goes back to the ordering system anyway. You staying online and look at the soups almost like you&#39;re at Subway or Chipotle and instead of picking out your soup then you wait till you get to the counter where the register and order then they make your soup and sandwiches and salads. I believe this causes congestion and confusing with the young workers there. I very clearly said I wanted the lemon caper tuna salad more than once and as I am walking out I realized they put a sandwich in there. They charge me for the lemon caper tuna sandwich but they also gave me a chicken cobb salad, so I don&#39;t know where the misunderstanding happened. it is a very similar name so I understand but I clearly said salad two times. . It was just very annoying. When reviewing the order before I paid he didn&#39;t say tuna sandwich but oh well. Again, overall, my experience is good because the food is good. I will definitely return. I hope other locations are running a little bit better than this one and more efficiently forgive me for my for language arts due to the fact I am using the voice to text to do this review."

This is a spot where your order at the counter and then wait.  The staff was great, but the line could have been moving a bit faster.  I was there around 12:45 and it was packed with a long line.

The salads and sandwiches are always awesome! Really fresh ingredients. My favorite is the turkey club its always on fresh baked yummy bread.

Honestly, we&#39;ve had apps and wine across the way at White Chocolate Grill and huge salads at Maggiano&#39;s and paid little more for a lot more atmosphere.

Typical panera/atlanta bread place. Unique soups though. Didn&#39;t know how to order or where to line up. They have the area where it looks like you line up, but people lined up at the cash register, so I was confused and just stood there for a while until the person behind the soups started talking to me. They give free samples so I tried the crab bisque and chicken pot pie. The soups rotate so you can look online to which soups they have on any day. 

Ended up getting the pot pie soup which was pretty good. Did the pick 2 thing and got a chicken toscana sandwich too. that was just alright. Had the potential but didn&#39;t really deliver much other than the first bite. Over this place is alright, just as pricey as the other similar places though, but should be a solid place since it&#39;s in a business district."

The dining area isn&#39;t very big; there are a few booths for 2, tables, and a counter with chairs.  So if you&#39;re in the mood to sit and eat you should get there just before or after the 12:00 p.m. lunch rush.

The service here is enthusiastic and very friendly.  The menu was explained to us, and we were offered unlimited samples of soups.  I sampled the macaroni and cheese.  It&#39;s macaroni, it&#39;s cheese, and it&#39;s a little zesty, and I can&#39;t believe they made it into soup!  It&#39;s very good, but I had a bowl of the lobster bisque.  

The soup selection is huge, and I really liked those that I sampled.  I would definitely return to Zoup for soup, but I&#39;d probably still go to Panera or Corner Bakery for a sandwich.  

The sizes are weird for soups.  They don&#39;t go by SML, or Italian latte-like names, but instead soups are sized as follows:  side, cup, bowl, and XL.  The side is ideal if you order with a half sandwich, the cup is good for a half sandwich and a big appetite, the bowl is ideal if you just want soup for lunch.  The XL looks like a pint of ice cream, and I&#39;d probably only order the XL if I took it to go and intended to share with a few people.

For a &#34;bowl&#34; of soup and a small soda (they sell fountain drinks in sizes, but the fountain area is open), I paid about $9.30.  My friend had a half wrap, a &#34;side&#34; soup and a soda.  She paid about $9.70.  So be prepared to pony up about $10.  I should add that you get a roll of bread with your soup as well.

Also, nutritional information is available on the website.  But I&#39;m not sure what size soup the nutritional info applies to, so if you are watching your calories it might be a challenge to figure out how your soup cup/bowl/caldron/suitcase, whatever you choose, will measure up against the rest of our meals."

I walked in and was offered free samples of any soup I wanted to try. I saw the prices and saw the serving size, looked at the stale-looking soup and walked right out. The soups really looked disgusting, like they had been sitting out for hours and needed to be tossed. I don&#39;t think you get a lot for your money here either. 

Overall I feel this place is expensive and uncleanly. I don&#39;t like to see a soup station with old soup everywhere on the counter. I walked out to get something else because this just did not look appetizing at all."

Their star menu player is, no shock, soup, but they also have a variety of sandwiches and salads as well, and you can get them in combos. 
Check the website daily for the rotation as to what&#39;s on hand that day. 

They let (and encourage) you to sample before ordering, which is what led me to order the crab and rice soup rather than the lobster bisque (which was good though ultimately seemed too heavy to me). The crab was brothier, had more textural interest and was also lighter. 

I got a cup of soup and half sandwich combo, with the Veggie-terranean wrap (hummus, roasted bell peppers, cheese and cucumber in a multigrain tortilla). While tasty, it was very...cold? The hummus was clearly refrigerated and could have been more...room-temperature (I&#39;m thinking the way it&#39;s served at Middle-eastern restaurants). Also, the cucumber in it was cut into HUGE chunks: slices, but about half an inch thick, so as I worked my way down into the wrap and the contents started compressing after a couple of bites, the cucumber busted out the side of the wrap, causing part to implode. It would be much more effective if these were shaved or cut into matchsticks. (Yes, I know that would require more work.)

Service was really friendly and helpful, and the manager was on hand, asking how everything was, giving some guidance to the other staff, so things were running extra smoothly, but it seemed like it would be even without that boost. 

So as you might have guessed, I will be back. Zoup is super!"

Service was very friendly and we were encouraged to sample as many soups as we wanted. The variety was good- maybe a little heavy on the seafood, which is fine for me because I love it, and the lobster bisque I had for lunch was delicious. There were also a few vegetarian options.

The cobb salad is so fresh and delicious that I don&#39;t even use the dressing. I love the French and multi grain rolls. The restaurant is always clean and the staff is super friendly. I&#39;ve seen some consumers there being flat out rude to them, and they don&#39;t let it break their smiles. They genuinely seem to like being there. And I like being there, too.

They explained how they have over 100 differnet soups and they rotate them in and out of the current lineup, even let me sample several differnet soups. I really liked the flavors on all that I tried, the most unique was a curry/apple soup. I don&#39;t remember the exact name but it was an experience. 

After my samplings I went on to order the pick 2. Which I do agree that their pricing seemed a little high to me as well for not including a drink.

They normally have a dozen soups per day and it seems they change them up quite regularly so this may be the place if you are a huge soup aficionado. 

I recommend the &#34;try two&#34; deal, where you get 2 of the following 3 options; half a sandwich, a cup of side and a salad. I ordered their chicken pot pie soup (personal weakness of mine), and their turkey sandwich. Both definitely had their way with my taste buds, and I left feeling satisfied.

ZOUP!!!!

My husband works right down the street, and the BWW right by here is his favorite.  So when I asked where he wanted to go, he suggested Zoup.  We were looking for something quick and not calorie-laden, and that&#39;s exactly what we found!

We were among the only people there when we first walked in, and they suggested we tried some of the soups.  Well don&#39;t mind if I do!!

I got the chicken and garlic something or other, and that was REALLY good.  I loved the spice of it.  Amazing.  I also tried the macaroni and cheese and the crab and lobster soup.  Both of those were solid as well, but my favorite was definitely the chicken.  It doesn&#39;t have noodles in it, just chicken and veggies.  So if you&#39;re looking for a carb-loading experience, don&#39;t try this one!

I paired it with the farmhouse salad, and I was on my way.  I added a drink, and between that and my husband&#39;s combo (with drink) it came out to over $20.  Seems a bit steep, but I can overlook it.

One of the coolest things is that they have Sprite ZERO.  I don&#39;t know many places that have that on tap, so I was way impressed!

My husband&#39;s grilled cheese was good, as was his veggie soup.  he finished it all.  The bread we got with our meal was good as well.  Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  It tasted really good dipped in the soup!

Overall, I thought it was a bit pricey, but it was worth it overall.  I will be back if I am in the area!"

The last time (and only time before) I had it, it had been picked up for a lunch meeting and therefore likely sat in a car and the conference room for some time before eating. This time, a friend and I ate at the restaurant and it was so much better. I still wouldn&#39;t give it 4 stars, and am even quite hesitant to give it a full 3, but I&#39;m feeling generous. I tried two soups before selecting one--the lobster bisque and the three-pepper chicken soup (fancy name for chicken tortilla, I believe!). Both were great and I chose the lobster bisque. I had the &#34;side&#34; portion of the soup and I do have to say that I wasn&#39;t able to eat all of it. It was good--but it was losing its appeal after the first five spoonfuls. 

With my side of soup, I had half a sandwich--the chicken toscana--also good. The chicken was actually cooked really well--tender and seasoned. It also had roasted red peppers, red onion and provolone on it, toasted. I asked for the basil mayo on the side. All in all, I&#39;m glad I gave it another shot. I&#39;d probably come back next time, but would try a new soup. I&#39;d definitely get the chicken toscana sandwich again.

I subscribe to their daily email list, which comes in handy in the winter when I&#39;m constantly in the mood for soup. Day to day, the soup doesn&#39;t change much. But week to week, it tends to. 

I&#39;ve only tried the soup, but I haven&#39;t had anything bad yet! Good recipes. The gumbo is meh...it&#39;s not real, from-the-south gumbo with a rich body and flavor. It&#39;s just spicy broth with rice. I&#39;d stay clear of it. But the shrimp and crawfish etoufee is great! So is the lobster bisque and the chicken with roasted garlic (very flavorful, brothy soup...great for colds!). I got &#34;macaroni and cheese&#34; soup there one time...it was basically macaroni and cheese in a really creamy, plentiful sauce. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it was DELICIOUS. But it not soup.

You can try all the soups there, and the staff isn&#39;t weird or finicky about it. They are totally nice and let you take your time deciding...that is, if the line isn&#39;t out the door, which it has been known to be during a weekday lunch hour. I steer clear of that. But the staff is always very friendly and will tell you their favorites.

I think the bummer about this place is how much a stupid breadbowl costs. I ordered it one time and it cost $9. I&#39;m not sure how. But this place has to be rolling in the dough (not to be confused with rolling in the deep, much like Adele does).

Anyway, if you have a hankerin&#39; for soup and you don&#39;t feel like slaving over the stove, letting the flavors simmer for hours, then come here. It&#39;s all hot and flavorful, and its fun to try all the soups there before narrowing it down to your ultimate pick."

There are a lot if options, including pick 2 combos and get two soups with a sandwich or salad for a set price.  I like that there are various sizes for the soup.  I will say, though, that if you are using the Zoup website&#39;s nutritional information to track calories, the entries on the website refer to the smallest size.  Something to consider.  As for the good, I can&#39;t say it stood out that much.  The Greek salad was not bad.  My only real complaint is that I had ordered a Greek chicken sandwich and got the salad instead.  It worked out ok but after talking to other people, getting part of an order wrong is a common thing.  I&#39;ll probably go a couple more times to see if there are any improvements but for now, very middle if the road."

Anyway, on to Zoup!
After lusting after this place forever, I finally got to go. It&#39;s an interesting set up, complete with samples. It&#39;s like a Chipotle, or better yet, a Soup Kitchen! Ey ohh!!!
You walk down the line, asking for a certain soup, what size, and whatever else you want to order. I cheated and got the Chicken Gumbo. I couldn&#39;t help it! I rarely see a non-shrimp gumbo, which I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s technically a soup, but when it tastes that good, you can&#39;t really think about anything. Oh wait, I should have said &#34;Spoiler Alert&#34; because bottom line: it&#39;s delectable, AND SPICY. I felt like the Spicy Grinch, whose tastebuds grew two sizes that day. Oh the flavors, the gobledy gooks, the whoos, etc. The only reason I haven&#39;t gone back already is that their soups change daily, so I don&#39;t know when my beloved gumbo will be back.
Do I dare cheat on my gumbo and fall in love with another soup?"

The girl at the cashier was friendly and efficient then the delivered food was fresh, good and we were able to make healthy choices. My only complaint was the &#34;manager/owner&#34; and how rude and overbearing he was to the staff who seemed to be doing a great job. He was overly obsessed with everyone &#34;standing in their assigned spots&#34; more so than just taking care if customers. If this place succeeds, it will be due to the good food and friendly staff.

Soup quality is good.. I would say consistent 8ish out of 10 for the ones I tried.. My only complaint is, for instance, the pepper steak soup only had one tiny piece of steak in it.. but great flavor, lots of pepper.. also the lobster bisque is great but would love some more chunks of lobster!

So, a cup of soup and a sandwich (this is the full-sized sandwich, not the half you can get with the half sandwich and soup combo) was $13.00. Too pricey.

But the soups! Really tasty, fun varieties. I&#39;ve had the chicken pot pie soup with pie crust topping, a pumpkin pie bisque, tomato with feta, corn and crab chowder, etc etc. Nothing has disappointed. The rolls on the side are also very good (I always opt for the sourdough).

The menu is updated daily online so you can know what&#39;s being served before you go. You can also taste any of the soups, which can help the decision making process (or make it harder!)

I went back again this week and got a soup and sandwich combo (southwest turkey sandwich and chicken pot pie soup) and I was even MORE pleased with my food. The soups are hearty and filling, and the meat is high quality (I am very picky about that). 

The price and atmosphere remind me of Panera, but this is MUCH better. Basically, they have over 100 soups that they rotate each day. Each day, there are 12 soups to choose from. They also have gluten free, vegetarian, and low fat options. You are free to taste test any soup before you buy it as well.

The owner and head chef Jae is a great guy who cares about the food he serves as well as his neighbors.

My typical order is usually pretty varied. I like the Korean dishes and the rest of my household likes the Chinese dishes. The bi bim bap is excellent and so is the sweet &amp; sour chicken/orange chicken. The mapo tofu is another one I really like. They also do a different take on hot &amp; sour soup. It&#39;s not like the hot &amp; sour you&#39;ll typically find at an Asian restaurant. Their egg rolls are also obviously made in-house as they always are cooked great and are fresh.

They run daily specials so it pays to follow them on Facebook as well (bulgogi tacos!). Lunch specials are legit as well. They give you enough food to feed you for two meals."

We stopped in for a late lunch and had the place nearly to ourselves.  If you are looking for a trendy Asian fusion restaurant with edgy decor and cute, colorful drinks, this isn&#39;t the place for you.  But if you are looking for an inviting, quaint family-owned gem then you are in luck.  The owner seated us immediately and chatted with my wife and I for quite a few minutes while handing out our menus.  Welcoming would be a severe understatement.  

FOOD: We split the Yook Gae Chang because we love spicy soups, especially of the Asian variety.  After a few bowls my wife bowed out and I polished that off, which left me with way less room than I planned for my entree.  She is addicted to Bi Bim Bop and I got the Koko Ginger Chicken which was a special for that day.  The large plate of sides was unexpected and didn&#39;t last very long.  We left with food enough for another meal each which we had for breakfast for the very next morning.

SERVICE: Pleasant, gracious, welcoming.  The owner was our server given that we were there at an odd hour.  The chef/ cook and apparent former owner stopped by to check on us which is always a nice touch.

PRICE: We got sticker shock only the inverted kind.  $30.35 for what we ordered was unreal but who are we to argue with their valuation?  

We will certainly be back.  Often."

We got:
2 bi bim bops. DELICIOUS. AWESOME. Perfectly packaged for take out and delicious as all hell. Not really &#34;spicy&#34; per say, but packs a little heat.
Potstickers- Very good. The meat-to-dough ratio was generous, and the texture was spot on. The flavor, overall, was a little lacking.
Szechuan chicken- Probably the best I&#39;ve ever had. Breaded chicken was delicious and spicy and just overall great. Totally devoured it.
An order of kimchi- YESSSS. So perfect. Reminded me of eating at my Korean friend&#39;s house in high school.

I&#39;m gonna go back to this place as soon as possible due to the food and the friendly, homey service and atmosphere. Hopefully I can branch out and try new things, but the bi bim bop and Szechuan chicken were so good I might not be able to resist."

The interior is full of little, quirky knick knacks and it definitely feels like a family owned restaurant! You feel welcome the moment you walk in, when you are warmly greeted and ushered to your table.  The service was extremely fast and attentive. 

My boyfriend and I ordered two appetizers, the crab rangoons and potstickers, to start off with. The portion sizes were both huge and they were executed well. The potstickers had a perfect texture and the crab rangoons had delectable creamy interior. 

Quickly thereafter, our main entrees were delivered, I ordered the Bibimbap and the bf ordered the Bulgolgi. The portion sizes were huge! The bibimbap was great with beef, pickled veggies, bean sprouts, an over-easy egg and rice, which you can mix all together to make each bite full of great Korean flavors. The Bulgolgi (grilled marinated meat, for those of you unfamiliar) had great flavors and was also a large portion size. It was tasty but I&#39;ve definitely had more tender, impressive Bulgolgi in the Midwest before. 

We were stuffed and had basically 2 meals worth of leftovers to take home and our final bill was only $35. Pretty affordable! All in all, this is a great family-owned, authentic Korean restaurant in the unlikely location of Lemont. I definitely enjoyed it enough to go back!"

I can only speak about the Korean food. My husband is Korean; I am not; but we both really enjoy Korean food. The majority of Korean restaurants are in Chicago and northwest suburbs, so we were quite happy to find one in the suburbs, close to us. 

We ordered kalbi (beef ribs) and gochu-japchae (hot peppers and meat stir-fry), which comes with banchan (complimentary side dishes). The banchan consisted of kimchi, odeng, seasoned sprouts, seasoned Korean radish, seasoned greens (possibly minari). The one word that comes to mind about this meal is &#34;Home Cooking.&#34; It really made us feel like we were eating at their personal home kitchen and not just a restaurant -- a warm feeling. 

The ambiance is basic, no-frills, mom and pop neighborhood restaurant. The family and staff were very friendly and welcoming to us and other patrons, and very attentive.

Side note: I like the fact that when the family isn&#39;t busy serving or cooking, they sit in their private family area watching Korean tv, waiting for the next customers to come in. This is very typical of a Korean family-owned business. I used to work at a Korean-owned sushi restaurant, and that family did the same thing. It makes for a very casual feeling, where you can interact with the owners/family while you eat."

First of all, my family is Korean, and my parents eat almost nothing but Korean food day in and day out. They live only a couple of miles away from here, so needless to say, they go here pretty often for authentic Korean food. My parents go often enough that they even have &#34;their table&#34; at the restaurant that the restaurant staff seats us at (if it&#39;s open) every time.

My mom has dietary restrictions because of her health, and one of them is watching her sodium. This is a pretty big predicament to someone that lives off of food made with soy sauce and gochujang, but the friendly folks at Lemont House accommodate her request every single time because they cook everything from scratch. My husband, who is Caucasian, also loves that we can all come here and he can choose to have a burger or Chinese food if he&#39;s not up to Korean food that day.

The restaurant is pretty old, and it definitely looks/feels/smells that way. But the staff is very friendly and the food speaks for itself, so I definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area."

Their Kimchi isn&#39;t listed on the menu, but it is AMAZING. You get a platter of different sides - all of which is super tasty. The establishment itself could use a little updating, but it&#39;s well maintained for what it is, and is a cozy place to sit and talk to someone. I haven&#39;t really tried much of their other stuff, simply because I&#39;m obsessed with the Korean menu. I think I had a veggie lo mein before, and it was delicious too.

Our bill was about $33 with tax. Will definitely be back and soon also next time get a large soup!!!!  The food was very fresh also :) and a side note...they played 101.9 on the radio if your a music buff :)"

We got there at 8pm on a Friday night and the place was empty. Since the place closes at 9pm the  waitress was just trying to get us to order the food quickly and get us out by closing time. We ordered only Korean dishes since the place is run by Koreans. The bi bim bap was ok, bul gogi so so, and the octopus dish overcooked. But the whole experience was uncomfortable.

We were biking the I&amp;M Canal trail and stopped in for a late lunch. BTW, we checked out the bar/ restaurant next door, but the waitress was so brusque (probably because I interrupted her smoke break) that we opted for the more unpretentious, family-friendly Lemont House instead. Thank goodness we made the perfect choice, because we were really hungry. Huge portions!

Egg Drop Soup - No cornstarch makes this traditionally thick soup unusually light and flavorful, w/ celery &amp; carrots. Not overly salty. Probably the best egg drop soup I have ever had! 
Shrimp in Garlic Sauce - The menu claims, &#34;Generous portion of shrimp in a garlic and black bean sauce.&#34; That&#39;s an understatement. Enough to take home a/o share.
Mapo Tofu - Big chunks of tofu and plentiful veggies.
Bi Bim Bop - As good as any in the most popular Korean restaurants in Chicago.
We also shared a bottle of Soju (Korean distilled alcohol made from rice &amp; barley), at a reasonable $13.00.

The servers were very attentive even though there was a big party in another room. Our waitress was engaging, funny and very sweet. Booths are cozy. Bathroom is clean, but not accessible (2 steps up).

One of my favorite things to eat at a thai place is pad thai and I will definitely be trying that next time I am there.

As I always do, I consulted with yelp while deciding where to eat a late lunch the other day. The reviews on this joint were mixed, but I had a hankering for awesome Thai and no enough time to get to my fav spot in elmhurst. So, I asked my business partner who has an office very near and she gave the place good marks for the pad Thai and the customer service.

Unfortunately, I was in the mood for pad see ewe. And the service I was met with left much to be desired, as did my meal.

I walked into the completely empty restaurant and the young guy sat me with a dinner menu. I asked if I could have a lunch menu and he said &#39;no&#39;. I missed &#34;lunch&#34; by mere minutes. Okay, whatever.

It took another six minutes before the young lady took my order. She was busy setting tables or something and I assume just didn&#39;t think my time was valuable considering I was dressed in sweats. I sat there enjoying the music...they were playing Mariah Carey&#39;s greatest hits! Fine choice.

I ordered, meal came, I ate. 

Veggies were amazingly prepared. Nice crisp, not soggy. Noodles were doubled and didn&#39;t get sauce on them so they were kinda dry and flavorless. Spice was very mild. It was edible, but not worth the $11 (maybe $6) nor good enough for me to return...."

Parking around this area is pretty easy, anywhere you see &#34;customer parking&#34;, you can definitely park. The lot of this restaurant is small so street parking is much easier.

We got the lunch special but they don&#39;t offer salad anymore, just hot &amp; sour soup. This was my friend&#39;s first time eating Thai food so I ordered panang chicken curry and pad thai w/ shrimp for us to share (both are medium level spicy). 

The hot &amp; sour complimentary soup came out in a small bowl but it was perfect portion. It was a bit too sour for my taste but still always good to start off with a hot bowl of soup when it is so cold outside!

For the panang chicken curry, the chicken was really hard to chew and didn&#39;t taste that fresh. The curry was mediocre and it just didn&#39;t taste as good as panang curries I&#39;ve had elsewhere.

The pad thai w/ shrimp was way too sweet for some reason. I had to mention to my friend that the pad thai really isn&#39;t suppose to be this sweet. And I usually like to have a lot of bean sprout with my pad thai and mix it but the vegetable portion was very small and not an even balance when I mix it.

Total came out to about $12-13/person for 2 lunch specials and an extra bowl of rice. I am Asian and the whole time while I was eating, there were only non-Asian people eating at this restaurant, so that kinda says something. Overall, it is good service, good pricing, okay food. But since I have been exposed to really good Thai food, I wouldn&#39;t recommend this to people with a more exposed tastebud to delicious Thai food."

Their pad thai (I get mine Mild+, which is a step up from mild but not the sweat-inducing medium) cannot be beaten. Portion size is plenty and I can often turn it in to two meals.
I&#39;ve had the spring rolls (the best thing about them is the sauce) and the crab rangoon (the worst thing is the sauce) which are a little heavy on the cream cheese for my taste.
I love the cashew chicken, too, but with a smaller portion size (it includes rice), $11.50 for the entree seems just a little but much. I&#39;d happily pay $9 for it. 

It&#39;s reliable, yummy, and never bugs my somewhat sensitive stomach. Take it to go or don&#39;t sit by the bathroom!

On their website, they don&#39;t list sizes, but apparently they come in small and large. Also, they offer their Tom Yum with tofu, chicken, beef, shrimp, or seafood (extra charge for the latter two).

The price weas 6.95 on their website, and I assumed that was for the large, which was what I ordered. Unfortunately, the large soup ended up being 8.69!! Holy cow!!

Don&#39;t get me wrong, the Tom Yum tofu, which featured lemongrass, thai ginger, mushrooms, baby corn, tomatoes, and onion, the hot and sour soup was very tasty. But was it worth that much? Absolutely not! I thought 6 dollars was pushing it...

My coworkers got the chicken pad thai and see ew. The to go dishes were served in your typical black carryout dish; they both looked okay. I can&#39;t assess them because I didn&#39;t have them. They also ordered Crab Rangoon to split; the sweet and sour was homemade and looked tasted, but since I&#39;m not a CR fan, I did not try.

My daughter &amp; I were immediately greeted and sat down.

I&#39;ve eaten food from here about 5x and I usually don&#39;t try new items, so my review is based on the ones I&#39;ve tried.   

Pad Thai lunch portion was enough for 2 to split &amp; we still had leftovers.  The noodles were cooked perfectly and the vegetables were fresh.  The only critique I have is that I wish the veggies were cut smaller (they were cut thin, but very long).  I added tofu and it was a nice touch...my 5yo daughter even liked it!

Basil fried rice wasn&#39;t on the lunch menu, but they made it upon my request.  I asked for medium spice and the heat was on!  Be very careful with how you ask for spiciness here...I&#39;ve read the other Yelp reviews and they are correct; start low because you can always add spice, not the other way around.
Anyway, the fried rice was delicious; right amount of basil, red peppers, onions, carrots, cabbage and beef.  Large portion too...enough for me to take home leftovers.

Our food came with a small cup of cabbage soup and a very tiny salad.
The soup was a warm broth, a little spicy and a nice way to start the meal.  The salad I could do without...the dressing was too sweet..too much rice wine vinegar?
Total for 2 at lunch on Saturday: $28 w/tip

Pros:  freshly made delicious food that seems pretty healthy, great service
Big portions

Cons:  very small inside so tables are on top of each other...they might have seating for 25 people total
No alcohol 
Parking can be hard to find...their lot holds 4 cars and 2 of them are for the busy dry cleaner next door.  Find street parking or there&#39;s a bigger lot behind the restaurant.

Ordered a catfish curry. 
Catfish strips looked like chicken strips that had been in the freezer for 10 years and had just been thrown in the deep fryer.
Rice was warm, but stale. White rice only.  ($2 for rice of this quality...Jackie Chan would not approve)

Waiters were pretty cold.
I was told by one of them that &#34;spicy&#34; wasn&#39;t bad at all but in reality, &#34;spicy&#34; = so spicy I can&#39;t taste my food and I don&#39;t want to eat this shit anymore.  But hey, it was not a problem because the curry was pretty bland anyways.  

Disappointed that Wheaton&#39;s only Thai place is simply another whitewashed, overpriced, and tasteless joint.

To save your butthole and your wallet some pain, I recommend going to the Vietnamese place down the street, which also happens to be overpriced and whitewashed, but nonetheless, is friendlier and slightly better tasting.

I was taking to go and didn&#39;t think it was an issue since people were seated and still ordering. The girl at the register was sweet and helpful until a thin slightly sour looking gentlemen comes up and says terse ly that the kitchen is closed. I will mention his back is to me he does not turn around or apologize just says it to her and moves on without making eye contact with me. The rudeness, right? So I smile and leave and tell myself never to come here again. Who needs that kind of  humiliation for thai iced coffee.
Word of advice to the owner hire people who will treat your customers with respect. And if this so called gentleman is the owner learn how to conduct yourself respectfully in front of your customers if you want your business to succeed."

We&#39;ve been there several times over the last few years but the last 2 times we been the service has really been bad. 

One of the young ladies behind the counter - she appears to be the manager - has a really bad temper. Last fall when she was in she got into a shouting match with the young guy behind the counter. Obviously conflicts are going to happen but this place is really small and the kitchen is literally right next to the tables, so when this happens in front of the customers it makes them feel uncomfortable and on edge. 

Despite the uncomfortable visit we decided to try again because the food is decent. This time however the same young lady with the temper was growling about us - and we were less than 5 feet away from her. Our son (4 yrs old) doesn&#39;t care for sauces on anything really, so we usually just ask Asian restaurants for steamed noodles with a side of chicken and vegetables. When our order got put in, we could hear her snapping about how we were going to be charged for a full dinner - insinuating that we were just being cheap, which isn&#39;t the case. We also asked for a little sauce on the side so that we could have our son try the sauce. We were told that was fine but as our order was coming out we could hear the same woman snapping about how &#34;we don&#39;t give sides of sauce.&#34; We did receive a bowl of dumpling dipping sauce but it was obvious this woman didn&#39;t want to help.

I&#39;ve also noted that there are more and more signs going up about management restrictions. Don&#39;t take Amex, maximum of 2 checks per table, no refunds on plates ordered hot. There is a max 2 checks per table, yet if 4 people came in and ordered 4 take out orders they would obviously have no problem with that. Just doesn&#39;t make sense. The basic idea here is that the focus is on what the management wants, not what the customer wants. 

Obviously we won&#39;t be coming back anymore and we&#39;re disappointed about that. I&#39;m guessing management could care less though. Sad."

Sometimes it&#39;s great and other times it&#39;s horrible. Their sign says clearly that they close at 8pm. When I tried to get a table at 7:30 we were turned away being told that they close their kitchen at 7:15. I&#39;m sorry, but having worked in the food industry I know that if a sign says they close at 8 that means the kitchen closes at 8 not 7:15 45 minutes before you close. I won&#39;t be going back."

You order your food at the counter and can still dine in but have to pick it up at the counter yourself. You can also get your own water at a table in the back. This is not a good idea for a restaurant so small. There is no room for people to maneuver around other tables. When just the waiters were moving  around that was better, but during busy times you have people bumping into each other. Also, all our food came up at exactly the same time. Appetizer, soup, and main dishes. Everything was hot, but by the time it had cooled to comfortable eating temp the rest was cold. Also, the plates, bowls, cutlery are EXTREMELY flimsy and cheap. The food still tasted pretty good, but we won&#39;t go back for that kind of dining experience."

Service is friendly, clean place, food comes out fast, warm and delicious. We usually get spring rolls with plum sauce or crispy rolls for appetizer. We love the red and yellow curries, so spicy and delicious. They are so kind to substitute some of the vegetables in the curries that I don&#39;t like. The price is fair for fresh food with no MSG. 

I can&#39;t believe anyone would give them less than 5 stars. I&#39;ve brought friends and family over the years and end up being regular clients themselves.

My main complaint is that they seem to choose your spiciness level for you; it doesn&#39;t matter if you order something mild, it will always come out significantly different each time you order it, and at times it will be spicy enough to cause intestinal distress. The spiciness level may change depending on the cook (if they have more than one), but this is something to look out for if you don&#39;t tolerate spicy very well. The rice also isn&#39;t very good, and they charge too much for extra rice (it seems like they make the curry too spicy so that you HAVE to order extra rice). The pad thai and pad see ew can be a little too sweet  at times, but it&#39;s still not that bad. This is what I typically order anyways. The stir fries aren&#39;t very good.

From what I&#39;ve experienced, the service isn&#39;t too bad. No one has been entirely unfriendly to me, though there is one younger woman who doesn&#39;t know the dishes well (she&#39;s not Thai) and asks if we want non-spicy dishes to be mild, medium, or spicy. The first time she did this, I verified with her that I ordered Pad Thai, and she snapped at me and said &#34;I KNOW, mild, medium, or spicy?!&#34;. Other than that little thing, the wait staff has been fine. 

The environment isn&#39;t all that great. This place is old, tiny, and doesn&#39;t appear to be well-maintained. If the bathroom door is left slightly open the whole restaurant smells like the bathroom and the general appearance makes the restaurant seem like it&#39;s not meeting any sanitation requirements. It&#39;s absolutely cramped, and though it has sort of a small-town charm to it, for some reason I get worried that I&#39;ll get food poisoning from this place at some point (I&#39;ve never been sick from the food, though).

This place is probably best for take-out. Being in the restaurant itself has to be the worst thing about it."

The service I received was top notch! Extremely attentive waitstaff, not too forward but good at anticipating my needs. The satay was typical, 4 skewers with slightly spicy peanut sauce, very good. The Tom Yum Chicken soup was fantastic! A large bowl chocked full with chicken and fresh veggies with coconut milk and yummy spices. I ordered my soup medium and appreciated the sign warning that they have a HOT heat scale, typical for Thai food.

Spring rolls either fried or fresh, and they have vegetarian potstickers.  I am hoping next time I can get them pan-fried; deep-fried potstickers are just wrong.

The pad see ew was perhaps a little oily, but tasty.  I had it to go because after eating half my soup, redolent of coconut milk and lemongrass, and half an order of the deep-fried potstickers, I was full.

Big props for Mai Thai being willing to make *any* of the soups with vegetable stock.  Most places I can&#39;t eat the soup because it&#39;s chicken stock or nothing."

I have been recently venturing into the rest of the menu.  I was shamed into it when the family that runs the place sees me and asks &#34;the usual today?&#34; even before I sit down without even a menu.  

So, the curries (every single one) are amazing.  I am a huge fan of the massaman and the panang in particular.

I adore the pad kei mao and the pad sei eu.

The place is definitely one of the hole-in-the-wall restaurants that because of its location, is easy to miss. 

There is not a lot of room inside, though the 4 of us (with a baby!) were very comfortable. The menu is quite extensive for such a small establishment.

I ordered the small corn stir fry. Afraid of eating something too spicy I requested it mild. I wish I had gotten the &#34;medium spice&#34; because there was no kick at all with the mild spice.

The food is great. Very tasty. It came with a large side of white rice. Also, I was pleased that the portions were large. I only ate about half of my dinner, so I guess I&#39;ll have lunch for tomorrow. My wife ate about half of hers as well.

The price is very reasonable, especially considering the food quality and generous portions. Dinner was a little over $10 each. Not to shabby!

It was very busy and it&#39;s a small place and you&#39;re sitting VERY close to everyone else (and it was pretty loud and bustling) so at first I wasn&#39;t sure how I was going to feel sitting smack in the middle of the restaurant. But, I quickly got used to it and we enjoyed ourselves.

The crispy spring rolls are absolutely amazing! They are huge and they kindly cut them in half for you so you have four portions with some tasty sauce. They are the best I&#39;ve had anywhere. They told us they are homemade. Yum.

I had the cashew stir fry with chicken. It was very good. My one complaint is that the menu online describes the menu items in more detail than the menu in the restaurant. The menu online said that the cashew stir fry had mushrooms and baby corn but the menu in the restaurant menu left those items off in the description. Fortunately I asked if it had mushrooms in it, because I don&#39;t care for them, and the menu didn&#39;t say it did but it did. It also had tons of baby corn but it wasn&#39;t included in the menu. That kind of bothers me. However, it was very tasty and a nice size portion. The rice came in a pretty tiny bowl, though, and wasn&#39;t quite enough for the leftovers the next day.

The service is very good- attentive and friendly. They were patient with us as we ate slow and stayed a longer time and were nice to keep refilling our water glasses. This seems like a very popular place. I was pleasantly surprised and will make sure to come back soon."

This is the truth.  It&#39;s that incredibly good, and the staff is that incredibly nice.  

Ros is the best waitress in existence.  She&#39;s remembered my girlfriend and I&#39;s names from the beginning.  The rest of the staff is beyond friendly and helpful as well.  They usually have to refill my water 6 or 7 times, and they do it with a smile.

No, Mai Thai doesn&#39;t have an upscale interior.  But its comfortable, close (almost European), and charming as a local eatery.  I wouldn&#39;t want the interior to go too upscale.  Mai Thai has perfected the Thursday night, out-to-eat feel.  Why change that?  I&#39;m in love...

Though I usually stick with the Panang curry (yellow, coconutty, and sweet but spicy), the friend rice is excellent.  My friends also are in love with the Pad Thai, if noodles are your thing.

Some people have complained about the bathroom.  They whine too much.  They&#39;ve improved the bathroom recently too, and it&#39;s now as nice as the one at my house.

Main reason it gets 2 stars is because they charge an extra TWO DOLLARS for more rice.  I ordered a rice/curry dish and i barely got any rice to begin with.  This is a good indication of this restaurant&#39;s motivation, more interested in cashing in on the good location and neighborhood than trying to provide excellent food and service."

I got SPICY pad thai. It was my mistake to ask for it to be spicy because it was extremely spicy!! I took maybe 5-6 bites and I had to pack it home.

I enjoyed the mushroom shaped ice...

I had thai iced tea, it was just right.

This small, simple, family owned and operated restaurant dishes up authentic, and deliciously divine, Thai cuisine. 

Coconut milk, curry, chicken, veggies, and rice? YES PLEASE! 

I&#39;LL TAKE TWO!!! 

My favorite item on the menu is their Panang Curry with chicken, it is to die for. My friends get the spicy version, but not me. My mouth has such a low tolerance for spicy foods, so I have to get the mild version, which still has some heat to it, but doesn&#39;t destroy my mouth. Don&#39;t worry about asking to make adjustments to spiciness, or even requesting additions or substitutions to your dish. Mai Thai Cafe makes there food fresh and are more than willing to accommodate your special requests. 

They also offer some vegetarian-friendly items for those of you who aren&#39;t meatatarians like me. I recommend the Yellow Curry with potato. I&#39;ve tried it and it definitely gets the official Mr Beautiful stamp of approval. I recommended it to one of my vegetarian friends when I introduced him to this gem in downtown Wheaton and let&#39;s just say that he now practically lives at Mai Thai Cafe. 

Mai Thai is only a few blocks from the Wheaton Metra station, for those of you who find yourselves with an uncontrollable craving for authentic Thai while on the train. If you&#39;re like me, and drive everywhere, there&#39;s plenty of street parking available. It&#39;s a small place, so you might miss it if your hunger begins to mess with ability to see straight. 

Mai Thai Cafe would get more stars but, unfortunately, I&#39;m only allowed to give it 5 stars. Their food is authentic &amp; made with fresh ingredients and the service is fast &amp; friendly. Oh yeah, and on top of it all, IT&#39;S INEXPENSIVE! 

Yes, that... is... right! 

Delicious, authentic, and inexpensive.

Mai Thai Cafe has the official Mr Beautiful stamp of approval all over it.

I hate when people advertise that they have lunch specials and then stop serving them at 12:30.  I never have time to eat on time, so when I showed up for lunch at 2:30 and was still able to get the lunch special that made me happy.  This is a really small place with only a handful of tables  But you can tell that it is family run, which in many cases means great food.  Based on several other Yelp reviews, I opted for the Panang Curry and when the menu said that they tended to under-spice the food I mistakenly ordered this at a medium temperature.  I love spicy food and the medium spiced curry made my lips want to fall off.  However I will say that it was delicious at the same time and honestly I would probably order it medium again - but you have been warned.  My lunch special came with a small side salad and soup which were both great too and for less than $10, it is a great amount of food. Service was great and there are lots of other things I&#39;d love to come back and try."

Atmosphere was crunchy - we were all stuffed into our little tables -- but it was fine. Parking was a little interesting.
I chose the yellow coconut curry with chicken with soup and an appetizer.... The soup was very good, cabbage, but I had to laugh when the appetizer came. They really meant &#34;an&#34; appetizer -- as in, one potsticker. 
I was amused. :-)
But the curry itself was divine, so flavorful; i felt quite lucky I chose the mild version, seeing as it was making my eyes water and I could see the flecks of fresh red pepper throughout the sauce. Generous portion of the curry and sticky rice - just delicious.
I would definitely go back."

I probably expected a little more since friends had told me this is probably the best thai place in the area, but i was a little disappointed.

Had the pad thai, veggie roll appetizer, and my friend got the penang dish. All were decent, but nothing amazing. The roll was a little disappointing, loaded with mainly of sprouts and carrots.

The staff here were very friendly and attentive so it&#39;s not a bad place to eat lunch if you want thai."

I only go there to get air miles, as they&#39;re part of the Mileage Plus Dining program.

Portion sizes are huge, but their curries are watery and have all sort of weird ingredients, like corn and jalapenos, neither of which are Thai, and completely change the flavor of the dish into something unrecognizable.

There isn&#39;t much else vegan-friendly in downtown Wheaton, though, so this is your best bet."

It is only a few blocks down from my office in downtown Wheaton, which makes for a great short and convenient walk (which helps, since parking is very limited). If you go for lunch, not only do you receive such generous portions of the actual meal, but you are also served fresh soup and salad before, for around an average of ten dollars. The pad thai is phenomenal, I would reccomend it to anyone. Usually I have to load tons of chili garlic sauce on my food to add that extra spice, but at Mai Thai, there is absolutely no need. I ordered the spicy version and my mouth was on fire (and I loved it). I hardly even glanced at the spicy sauces sitting on the table.

Go ahead scratch your head, Wheaton?  Thai food?  OH YEAH!

Family owned and operated, Mai Thai is authentic Thai cuisine in a warm atmosphere.  The father is the chef, the mother works the counter and the daughter is the waitress (she may have moved on in the world since the last time I&#39;ve been there).

Their Tom Kha Kai (sp?) soup is the best I&#39;ve ever had, spicy chiles with sweet coconut milk, you can&#39;t get any better than this.  Then there is the Panang Curry.  Another reviewer claimed this is the best in existence, he&#39;s right.  It is by this dish that I judge all other Thai places.  

The service is great and the food is made fresh.  You can make all sorts of substitutions and add things and take them away from any dish and they always say &#34;no problem&#34;.  They will make any dish as spicy or not spicy as you want."

Authentic and FRESH Thai Cuisine. Everything I have ever had from this place has been delicious!  I like my food ridiculously spicy and not too many restaurants can satisfy my need for spice. This place definitely knows their way around spicy food!!! IT IS PHENOMENAL! The take-out portions are huge and taste great heated up the next few days! The Pad Thai is astounding. The Pad Khea Mao excellent! Gang Pa Jungle Curry is the best curry I have ever had, along with the Pad Thai. I had never had the Pad Khea Mao before but it was also 5 stars. The Thai Basil was incredible. Crab Rangoon is great (and you can actually taste the crab unlike other restaurants), and fresh spring rolls were also amazing as were the vegetable pot stickers. When I say everything is fresh, I mean it. The spring rolls tasted VERY refreshing as you bit into them. It was like biting into a raw rice paper filled with the cleanest, most refreshing water you have ever tasted. It was like being slapped in the face with pure mountain spring water ballon.Very satisfying and refreshing. The homemade sauces they make are also very good.

The service has been wonderful and every staff member I have come in contact with seems to genuinely love what they do, and it shows in the food. I had never had Thai before coming here a few months ago. I am now a regular. I am so happy I found this place and I LOVE supporting family run establishments. If you have never been here, I&#39;m telling you, you&#39;ll love it if you enjoy any sort of asian cuisine. I recommend this to ANYONE looking for fresh ingredients, delicious 5 star taste in a family environment, and great service.

Thank you to the owners for running such a great restaurant. Your food makes me and my family happy!"

And you would be correct. What I like about this Thai food is that it has lots of flavor even when I order it mild. Which I do. But Boyfriend-of-the-Fairly-Recent-Past likes hot food, and he was happy with dishes here, too, so it isn&#39;t just my patheticly weak taste buds that like it here. 

Roommates all ordered different dishes tonight, and we were all happy. My favorite was Roommate A&#39;s yellow curry with chicken. Coconut milk and curry and general deliciousness. Yum.  Roommates B and C both ordered red curry dishes, which were also good. Not sure how authentic it is, but it is tasty, it is cheap, and we each probably have enough left over for at least 1 more meal. 

I think they need to give the guy filling water glasses something else to do, because he is a little over-attentive, but the staff is friendly and helpful, and I can&#39;t  really complain. The room is small and a little crowded and the kitchen is semi-open to the dining area, so if you want somewhere quiet and somewhat private for a date, this is not the place, but I actually kind of like the atmosphere in general.

My husband and I were wandering around downtown when we spotted this place. They were going to be closing so we just placed our order to go. 

I ordered the Pad Woon Sen with vegetables. Tons of vegetables, awesome sauce. 

 
My husband ordered Pad Kee Mao.  The worker asked if he wanted that hot, medium, or mild. My husband, a huge spice fan, obviously responded HOT. The guy asked if he had ever tried their version of hot. Nope, twas our first trip. He let us know there was a no refund or exchange policy on the HOT. What? Can you return other dishes?

His noodles were pretty hot, but hardly worth the forewarning by the waiter. Nonetheless, a charming little place. We even sat and waited in our car which was parked in their tiny lot because he said it would be about 15 minutes. When our food was ready the waiter delivered our order right to our car.

Overall the place is super whatever, it&#39;s just that they are located not too far from my parents&#39; house and I do like their tofu soup. If it wasn&#39;t for those little factors, I wouldn&#39;t bother with the place. Oh, and their panang curry is the worst I&#39;ve ever had.

The staff are kind and thoughtful, the restaurant is small but neat and with nice touches of decor here and there, and the food is good!  Sometimes it is a bit greasy, but I don&#39;t mind because it&#39;s so tasty.

The lunch special includes a mixed green salad with vinaigrette (no plain romaine salad here), soup of the day, and entree.  I miss when they used to include a pot sticker because those are yummy, but I think they&#39;re on the appetizer menu now.

I stick to the pad thai when I want something simple, pad see eiw when I&#39;m looking for something more savory, pad khee mao for more vegetables and spice, and red curry for spice and rice.  Also, they will make alterations to accommodate you. My best friend and I love getting pad see eiw with crispy fried noodles (normally it&#39;s served with soft noodles) and it&#39;s sooo good. 

And they make things at the appropriate heat level (although I&#39;m Asian and may have a different palate, so take that into account).  I can order &#34;regular&#34; or &#34;mild&#34; and I can already taste the heat.  At other places I hate how something is marked with a red chili pepper icon and it&#39;s not even spicy.

Hubby and I got carryout here, there are very few tables inside.  We had crab rangoon, spring rolls, pad thai with shrimp and something really spicy (hubby can&#39;t remember the name of it).  The crab rangoon wasn&#39;t too crunchy and I don&#39;t know what was in it, but it was not bland.  The spring rolls were ok.  My pad thai had lots of shrimp in it and his spicy stuff was great.

We just went in there and ordered some stuff, didn&#39;t call ahead.  It took about 15 minutes.  My only complaint is that it seemed kind of expensive for thai food in the &#39;burbs.  The crab rangoon was about $7 and the spring rolls were $3.50 each."

Bette had the Red Curry with chicken, medium spice. It was too hot for her, she should have gotten the mild. It had a good flavor, though, and had lots of veggies, including eggplant and tofu cubes. I had the Hot and Spicy Curry, which was hot and spicy with similar veggie loading and beef. I was tearing and my nose was nice and clear. Both the curries were tasty but surprisingly watery. I just had the leftovers today, and it was still good.

We ordered basil chicken, pad thai, and pad see ew. The pad thai and pad see ew were watery and tasteless. The ground chicken in the basil chicken dish was raw so we couldn&#39;t eat it. But the little bit we did taste was super salty. It meal was very disappointing and I will probably never go there again."

But I had it recently a few days ago for my mom&#39;s birthday, and I was thus confirmed that the food was just &#39;okay&#39;. My dad ordered the food to go and brought it home. The first thing I thought when I saw everything was that the portions are so small! We ordered Pad See Ew, Pad Thai, and Basil Chicken with rice. Also, everything looked really bland and dry. Regardless of that, I still helped myself to some of the Pad See Ew which I would say was alright. They used regular broccoli instead of Chinese broccoli and added carrots and purple cabbage, so I would say it was a pretty Americanized version of Pad See Ew. I didn&#39;t really like how fat the noodles were either, and they also sprinkled a lot of black pepper which I thought was unnecessary to the dish. I tried the Basil Chicken with rice and  thought it was pretty good though. My mom said that the Pad Thai was bland and that she&#39;s had better.

Overall, this place is just meh for me, and I&#39;d rather satisfy my Thai food craving somewhere else."

Great concept; think Flattop grill but add your own meat, you can literally make a bowl of 3lbs of just chicken of you want. Vegetable selection broad, all good quality. Pass on the pork options, it was just so-so, wasn&#39;t great cuts of meat; chicken was better than steak was. Cooks bust their butts and are friendly and look mostly like they are having a good time, a major plus when the customer stands 2ft away watching them cook. Food is good, depending on your personal choices in sauce, veggies, and meats. Stack your bowl high! The only limit is how much you can fit without spilling. 
Negatives; I definitely made a reservation for last time I was there, we show up, no reservation; host asks if I called the Naperville location, I show the correct phone number on my list of outgoing callls, oh well, they made room for us. Server was inattentive. Never brought out round of waters for the table, never came back for a second drink order until after most of us had finished our meals. I had a giant bowl of stuff I really could have used more liquid to ingest...I hope they split the tips with the cooks; in the car after t H e meal I reflected on my (22%, typical for me) tip; the server only handed us the empty bowls, brought one/two rounds of drinks, then bussed the table when done--much easier waiting job when you don&#39;t have to actually take any orders.
Lunch bowl is like, $12 or something? Of course I&#39;ll go back."

I love a good Mongolian grill. However, this place isn&#39;t it.  It was very busy and they were SO SLOW. The cooks weren&#39;t really paying attention and burned my dish so bad that all I could smell walking to the table was burned charcoal. The manager came over and replaced my dish with a Pad Thai.

I have been here several times for my birthday, including two days ago. Since I signed up for the mongo club, I was excited that I got a free bowl and thought it would be a fun birthday dinner with my family. Even though I went here a couple months ago and had a not so good experience, I figured it would be great this time.

I was so disappointed. We didn&#39;t get a server for about 15 minutes, and the server we did had did not seem very excited to be taking care of us and didn&#39;t smile once. And I get it, that happens.

But then, I ordered moscato, my boyfriend ordered a blue moon, my mom ordered a dirty martini, my dad a Miller lite. 
The server says she isn&#39;t sure they can make a martini (odd.. It&#39;s a simple drink) and says they have no blue moon. Which is disappointing considering their drink menu is already very limited. 

We get salads, I go up with my boyfriend to get one a few minutes later and there&#39;s no plates. We ask someone walking by, (which I hate doing but who am I supposed to ask?)
We get salads and eat them and still we have nothing to drink. Not even water. The place was not crazy busy, it was a Monday night. 

She comes back and says there&#39;s no moscato as well. 
(Really wanted that moscato by now)

Then my family goes up to fill their bowls and I am just a couple minutes behind. The line was missing every other thing. Mushrooms were out. Chicken was out. No eggs. Tons of people just waiting around. 

Finally I get done and back to the table and everyone is basically done eating. I usually LOVE what I get in my bowl but it wasn&#39;t the same. 

I show the waitress my coupon and she&#39;s like &#34;oh happy birthday&#34;

My little brother ordered a sundae which I thought may be taken off for my birthday or just due to them being out of everything... But no. 

I never write reviews and I&#39;ve done my share of serving tables, but it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve had a bad experience. After a long work day on my birthday I guess I just expected a little more. I left feeling annoyed and frustrated. 

Like I said, I really used to love coming here and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll try again but probably not any time soon."

Mongolian Grill has created a fairly full menu. Mostly their intention is to raise the average check by pushing appetizers and desserts. And when you pay for an appetizer and eat it before you hit the grill, then you eat less at the grill saving the restaurant money while you just spent more. Genius for BD&#39;s. I can&#39;t fault them for a wise business move so no deduction of stars. 

Beer and drink selections have expanded to include more local and seasonal offerings. This seems par for mid level restaurants. 

The soup and salad bar is often problematic. Out of soup bowls, soups or chili with thick dried skin on top, watered down soups with more spices tossed in to try and compensate, salad ingredient crossover that makes it unappetizing, or a messy station with spilled soups or salad ingredients and dressings all over. 

The selection of grill ingredients has increased over the last couple years to include pastas, seasonal meats (like lamb for Easter), marinated meats, and fake &#34;meats&#34; for vegetarians. While veggies were once limited to seven or eight they now offer at least fourteen on most days. Sauces and spices haven&#39;t changed much and the offering is adequate. What bothers me is that the sauce ladles are always sticky. I&#39;d rather not need the wet naps before I even start eating. 

The grilling has changed a bit. They now squeeze 12 customers in to the grill at once. This pretty much guarantees some grill crossover. I almost always end up with scallops in my beef bowl. While I can pick out baby corn or tofu it&#39;s hard to locate the scallops. I often use the &#34;Allergy Station&#34; to avoid the grill crossover and have by bowl made in an individual fry pan. 

I do have to admit that the desserts are pretty damn good. The deep fried Oreo&#39;s are to die for but they&#39;re very rich and an order should really be split with your friends. The dessert shooters (shot glass sized tastings) are a good idea for just $1.00 to cap off your meal.

For the poor soup and salad bar showing, sticky ladles in the sauce section, and grill crossover, I need to deduct one star at this time. Some more attention to quality will get them back to five stars."

2  fill it with whatever you want to.
3 fill a different bowl with sauce.
4 bring it to the grill.
5 enjoy the show.
6 eat that delicious food.

Grea soup and salad bar too. 

My suggestion is to interact, that&#39;s how the fun happens. Interact with the server, interact with the cooks, interact with the person next to you at the grill, hell even interact with the table next to you. Just have fun. If you&#39;re not having fun, I&#39;m thinking you mighy just be the problem.

It&#39;s not cheap either-they do have deals on line if you join their frequent diner club, so those can help.

The meat/seafood is frozen, so can be chewy from time-to-time, and the produce is o.k.   Spices and sauces are fine.  Salad bar is alright, they have one good soup-tomato parmesan-which I seem to miss on most visits.

The stir fry itself is o.k., but cooking everything on top of each other results in losing some of the flavor you expect from what your bowl contained and adding others from the neighboring customer-eggs and random meats/seafood that I didn&#39;t put in my bowl."

I had no idea what it entailed but my friends had recommended it and said it was a pretty decent place to get some noodle dishes (that you could customize yourself!).  

The basic layout is buffet-style selection of the items that you want to have grilled.  You pick a bowlful of whatever you would like with noodles or just veggies or meat and bring it to the cooks, they grill it, throw on a sauce if you have one, and that is it.  I got the unlimited bowls and was only able to eat two, but for $17 it was a more food than I needed. 

The quality of all of the ingredients they have available is very good.  There is a wide variety of vegetables to choose from, most of which you&#39;d expect in a stir fry or thai noodle dish.  There are also a good amount of different meats available (steak, different marinated chicken, fish, shrimp, etc.).  The meat was good as well, so no complaints there.  

Overall, would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good noodle dish that they can completely customize.  It&#39;s fun to figure out the right combinations of veggies and meat to get the best tasting dish.

Booths are very limited so you either sit in a walk way or a table 2 inches from another table with screaming children. Also on my last visit I felt the people on the grill were getting carried away with flipping the skewers around. One cook burned himself flipping the long skewer and on another pieces of food were flying off into the area where people are waiting with their bowls.

This restaurant seems like a nice family friendly restaurant. Nice environment but a little crowded. The wait was a little longer than necessary. They had plenty of seating for five in here but we still had to wait around 20 minutes. 

The food isn&#39;t that great here. There is tons of options to choose from a nice selection of sauces. They have great meat choices and I loved the many selections of noodles. We all made our own bowl of food. The first time around was really good, cooked perfectly and had pretty good flavor. The second time the food was burnt. It had pieces of charr the whole plate was a dark brown with black flakes. The third time around was about the same. Not very impressive. 

The service: A lot of the servers are nice but there were some that were very rude. Our waitress only came to our table around 4-5 times. The grill chefs are very rude and act very childish. They are back there messing around the whole time and not doing their job properly. They are very unsanitary with the way they cook and are really slow. 

In conclusion, the service is okay. The food is pretty bad and burnt. I will have to say I will not be coming here again. I don&#39;t recommend this place at all. If you want good mongolian grilled food look elsewhere."

When I moved to Woodridge a couple years ago, I was so excited to see a Mongolian BBQ place similar to HuHots, and so close to my home!  I&#39;ve been there three times, but sadly, I am incredibly disappointed.

The ingredients themselves, atmosphere, price, everything else is just fine.  Servers friendly.  But once you get your stir fry...  Dear God.  Every time we&#39;ve been there, both of our meals were burnt and had little bits of black.. tar like.. stuff on them.  I thought maybe it was a fluke, so we came back a couple more times.  Nope.  Even when we requested re-made dishes. Every time.  It makes the dish taste burnt and gross.  No other Mongolian BBQ place I&#39;ve been to has had this problem.  It completely ruins the dish.

I do like that they have a larger meat selection than other places. The sausage was pretty good. Overall, the meat was good, even though the containers/utensils did seem a bit sticky.

My real complaint is the sauce situation. I&#39;m used to places where the server helps you on the sauce. Here you are left on your own. I always forget exactly which combination I like. I guess it&#39;s my fault but I don&#39;t think it would kill them to suggest a few things.

They had received coupons for a free meal from BD for completing the summer reading program with the local library. My husband had showed no interest in going, so when he was working late, I decided to take the kids. 

The waitress was very nice, and accommodating, bringing us crayons and extra napkins, though at times it took a while. The food wasn&#39;t half bad either, though my picky kids left a lot on their plates. They have a special &#34;allergy&#34; section, which I was VERY thankful for.

However, unless you&#39;re an octopus, going here with kids is really infuriating when you go fill up your bowls. There are no trays, so I had to run back and forth with the bowls trying to get everyone&#39;s bowl to the right stations. A tray would have made my life SO MUCH easier. The food that came out as a result was fine.

They got place mats where they had to do certain things to get a &#34;reward&#34; at the end. I figured sure, why not, they&#39;ll get a little cheap plastic thingy or something and it encourages them to eat their food. My son worked very hard to complete all the tasks, including telling our waitress a joke. So, at the end, she brought their &#34;reward&#34;. Now, take in to account that I had just informed the kids that because they hardly touched their food, they would NOT be getting a dessert that evening. However, the waitress brings out two Blue Bunny Cookie Ice cream sandwiches. Not wanting a total meltdown from my kids, I grit my teeth and let them have it. Then our bill arrives. And guess what? She CHARGED me for those ice cream sandwiches that she didn&#39;t check with me that I wanted in the first place. I realize the kids meals were free, but there&#39;s no reason to try to tack on as much on to the bill as possible. I was debating arguing the charge, but with two kids just wanting to get out of there, I decided to just leave it. We just won&#39;t be coming back."

We started and the soup/salad bar.  Almost every item needed to be replenished.  Another server told us they were working on it.  We decided to go up to fill our bowls.  There was dropped food everywhere on the floor.  I&#39;m surprised no one fell to the floor.  The wait to have food cooked took about 30 minutes.  The cooks were yelling and acting silly in the kitchen.  There was no need to toss plastic bowls around or smack egg shells around the kitchen.  All the antics caused the cooks not to pay attention to what they were supposed to be doing...cooking food.  Instead, they burned it.  Also, one of the cooks had to leave the kitchen as he was splashed in the eye.  My friend mentioned what happened to the server.  She brought the manager to our table who offered an apology told us go up and create another bowl.  It was not worth wanting another 30 minutes in line.

I have been in similar style restaurants and the kitchen was operated on a professional level and the floors were clean.  We were in the restaurant almost 2 hours with a great view of the kitchen and food stations.  Never once did we see anyone attempt to clean up the dropped food from the floor.

I find that people with seafood, meat, chicken etc mixing together and no cleaning in between customers it unsettling to me .And the danger of food allergies cross-contamination seems to be a big rise I wasnt willing to take.So I got the tacos.

My veggies and scallops all have burned sides.  The kids cooking are sloppy (throwing bowls and sauce dishes to where they bounce in the floor). Food gets knocked off the edge to the floor.  They put the sauce next to the food where it burned off before it mixed in with my food.  I had to go get an extra sauce to put on after.

Cons: There can be a long wait standing around waiting for your food to be cooked. You can&#39;t have your rice added into your stir fry; you have to do it yourself at the table. And while the sauce selection is extensive, they all seem kind of similar... thin, salty, heavy on the soy sauce.

Not bad but I&#39;d pick Flat Top over BD&#39;s in the future."

The food is always fresh.  My kids love the fact that they can pick out whatever and how much of what they like.  It is their &#34;own&#34; creation and they have pretty  much perfected their bowls.

I love the fact that I can make my dish however I want it, if I&#39;m in the mood for more meat or just chicken or seafood I can make it that way.  The veggie selection is awesome there is something for everyone. Even meatless selections for those who like that.

Plenty of spices to spice it it and give it flavor - don&#39;t forget to add it in as it makes a great difference on how your dish tastes.

They have a plethora of sauces.  Little spoons for you to taste test.

The staff is always there to refill the food and sauces and are very attentive to keeping it clean.  The cooks behind the grill keep the food moving and at times are entertaining.  Good work guys - and kudo&#39;s for standing over the hot grill to get our food ready!

For the price you get at dinner time salad and soup are included as well.  Which is a nice touch.  We don&#39;t always go for it because we want to save our appetites for the main course!  

Sometimes the wait can be a bit frustrating.  And some advice I would give to the girls that stand around the reception desk it to hustle a bit more and get those tables cleaned off.  They need a little bit of management to keep things moving.

Once we had and issue and the matter was resolved by management immediately and they went above and beyond to ensure we were happy.  

One last note:  Please bring back the old bowls the curved ones make your food fall out when you are eating."

Having been to Stir-Crazy several times, I guess I&#39;ve just been spoiled.  But, the boyfriend had a coupon, so I figured I&#39;d give it a try.

You choose your own meat from a buffet-like table. Gross! Sure, there&#39;s a sneeze-shield, but as someone who hates buffets to begin with, this kind of grossed me out. The shrimp and scallops were on ice, meaning some of what you put in your bowl is warm (if it was on top), or frozen (if it was underneath). Yuck. 

The veggies were really a mess... Semi-frozen and mushy looking snap pea pods, mixed up bamboo shoots in almost everything, and dirty tongs with mashed food stuck to them. 

Then the 3rd buffet table has sauces and spices... Slopped all over the place. They were all so mixed up, I am convinced it wouldn&#39;t have mattered which sauce I chose from, it would all have tasted the same. 

Instead of using individual clean woks to cook your meal in (like Stir-Crazy), this place has a large, round, hibachi-style table where each one of the guys rotates around, each taking a turn touching your food with their yucky looking, long utensils that they had just used on the food for the person next to you. Gross.  And I&#39;m not entirely sure all the shrimp on my plate were cooked through enough. Those that didn&#39;t look quite pink enough were left on my plate.

Our waiter could have been a bit better- I had to ask for water 3 times before I got it. He wasn&#39;t very attentive and we had to flag him down twice for refills. And his bright orange t-shirt with the phrase &#34;I&#39;m feeling hot hot hot&#34; on the back kinda creeped me out. 

Next time, coupon or not, I&#39;ll insist on Stir-Crazy instead."

You get a bowl from your server and you go up to the &#34;buffet-style&#34; stations with meat, seafood, veggies, and sauce/seasonings. Then you go up to the large, donut-shaped grill.

I am eating gluten free, so I knew this would be the place to get a meal without the grains.  I love that the salad bar is included with the dinner bar.   Really is a good price for all the food you get.  For $2.00 more, you can get a second helping at the main food bar.    

The staff is really friendly - our server was Chelsea - she was a sweetheart. 

They were quite busy as we came at the Saturday night rush, but everyone (staff and customers) were in good spirits.   

My gluten free steak bowl and salad was quite tasty.  My daughter fell asleep after taking a few bites of her meal so Chelsea brought us a To Go container.

My only suggestion for this place is the floor looked really dirty (grossly dirty) under the counter at station 1 where you wait for your food to be grilled.  Also the floor in the hallway going into the staff kitchen area near station 1 (very gross).   There looked to be dried gum in the floor and it looked like it had been there a long long time.  Please do a better job on the floor in that area!  On a positive note, there was staff constantly checking the salad and meat/veggie bar to ensure stuff was stocked and in order."

Stopped in with my mom for lunch earlier today not totally knowing what to expect other than they offered a similar platform to Flat Top Grill. Our waiter, Patrick, was ah-may-zing at taking care of us and making sure we knew what was going on. Seriously, if you get this guy waiting on your table, be prepared to leave him an incredible tip because you&#39;re going to be impressed. 

One thing that&#39;s tricky about this place is you are responsible for your own food! If it sucks- well, you&#39;re kind of at fault. On the bright side, Patrick made it sound like they would&#39;ve hooked us up if we didn&#39;t like what we created. I threw together some broccoli, water chestnuts, green peppers, potatoes, onions, edamame, and baby corn together in a bowl with their asian black bean sauce. SO GOOD. (Oh, and fellow allergy/limited diet/vegetarian people, never fear: they have a separate area where they cook your concoction so it doesn&#39;t touch any contaminate.) Back at the table they had white and brown rice for us to mix in with our creations which was really neat. Definitely different from flat top in a good way- I didn&#39;t have to worry about filling up my bowl with noodles or rice, I was just focused on the vegetable goodness :)

After our meal was totally scarfed down, Patrick came back to our table and offered us a dessert on the how because that&#39;s just how awesome he is. We declined because we were totally stuffed but appreciated the gesture from our great server. I think B.D.&#39;s made two new fans today!"

Time after time, BD&#39;s has been nothing but a major disappointment. I have countless friends who enjoy dining here and I&#39;ve yet to figure out why. Is it fun to make your own dish? Yes. Is it fun to watch somewhat cook it? Yes. It is fun when it tastes horrendous and you just paid 13 bucks for one bowl of crap? Not so much. 

BD&#39;s reminds me of a confused Flattop Grill or Stir Crazy. When I think of stir-fry, I think of Asian flavors and ingredients. So you&#39;ll have to excuse my confusion when I see Italian style meatballs and sausage chillin&#39; in the meat selection. Oh, let us not for get the spaghetti or rotini noodes. No worries, you still have your standard brown or white rice, rice noodles, veggies, a wide variety of meats and seafood.You have your traditional Kung Pao, Teriyaki, and Pad Thai sauce. And then you get confused again when you see Marinara and Spicy Buffalo sauce. Ok, so is this stir-fry buffalo? Stir-fry Italian? I don&#39;t know and I give up.

So after packing your bowl with meats and veggies, you bring it to the cook. Every single time my meat is overcooked and the dish has a film of that burnt, char-like substance that cooking on a dirty grill leaves on your food. Maybe I&#39;ve just had bad luck or maybe I just have higher expectations. 

So you sit back down, and the waitress offers you rice or tortillas. Yes, tortillas. This one threw me for the biggest loop. You look at your dish and wish you had made something else...but you can&#39;t redo it now. Nearly every time I choke down my meal and wish I had just gone for the unlimited soup and salad bar. At least I know what the end result will be.

Do I recommend BD&#39;s? Hells to the no. If you want a make your own stir-fry experience, hit up Flattop Grill or Stir Crazy. In my book, that&#39;s where you find true stir-fry."

The hubby, who is the ultimate picky eater, loves this place. But this place is kind of perfect for picky eaters. You choose what you eat and if it doesn&#39;t turn out good then go back up and try again. 

You can order prepared food from the menu, but I have never done that so I don&#39;t have anything to tell you there. The real appeal is the stir-fry. 

After you&#39;re seated your waiter/waitress will take your drink order and ask if you would rice or tortillas to go with your meal. We always opt out of both because there is so much food in the stir-fry. Then you go up and choose your food. You grab a bowl and start with a few kinds of noodles. Then on to meat or fish which you can mix and match (they suggest not mixing fish with anything like beef or chicken, only mix with other fish). Then you choose from a large variety of veggies. Lastly sauces and spices. You choose your sauce (if you know what you&#39;re doing you can mix here too) and put it in a little cup. Then there are some seasonings you can add as well. Then you take your concoction up to the grill where they have a few kind of hot sauces you can either before or after your food is cooked. 

Somewhere along the way you can also pick up raw eggs which they will mix up with food. It will help your food stick together and make eating with chopsticks a bit easier if that&#39;s your thing. I&#39;m clumsy with chopsticks and I find that egg takes some of the spice away that I always try so hard to achieve. 

At the round grill you give your food to some very entertaining grillers that somehow keep track of who belongs to what even though you and the food are usually constantly moving. If you tip, they will hit the gong. 

They do have a small, less entertaining side grill for those of you with allergies. Anyone with allergies should use this because with the regular grill it is very possible to pick up a stray piece from your neighbor&#39;s meal. 

Once you&#39;re done cooking, return to your seat and enjoy one hell of a good meal. If you&#39;re up for it, you can do it all again once you&#39;re finished. 

Another note for someone on a diet and specifically Weight Watchers, this is a great place to come. A very filling meal for next to no points. And I did get the point value from the WW dining out book so it was specific to this restaurant."

We took my mother in law here for dinner because it was attached to the bowling alley we wanted to go to (which was a much better experience, such nice people!). Anyway, the place was dead which usually means better service and food. Right? Nope. The food was delicious but the service was awful. We had a female waitress shadowing what seemed to be the manager. He was a stout older balding gentlemen who&#39;s kindness seemed forced, maybe He was having a bad day. I would have preferred the woman alone. He only came to the table to greet, ask for our drink order, bring the food, and bring my check. The new waitress took the drink order during the greet, told it to the manager in front of us, and he came back 10 minutes later asking our drink order again! When we needed something, not a single employee was to be seen, for our entire meal. Not even a bus boy. And I have 3 kids, so that meal feels like a century. The only good part about our visit was the food. The pasta I ordered was better than a similar one I had at a fine dine restaurant for twice the price, and the portions were large. I will only come again for the food. The food is why I gave 3 stars. I may go with carry out if my next experience is just as bad. But I would like a real server, not a manager that sucks as bad as being a server as the clueless newbie following him around. Its like that joke about how many you need to screw in a lightbulb."

They have a large menu and I have never been displeased with my food. However they have hired some new staff, and a man (mid 30s early 40s) who was taking to a new waitress deliberately tried to embarrass her even though she had the order correctly written with the right sides. And if he had a question he could of pulled her aside to ask. When the waitress walked away he made the comment &#34;have to keep her on her toes&#34; which seemed very unprofessional in my
Opinion.

My most recent time, they charged me 10 cents for a Togo container. Really? Another thing I noticed is they are getting incredibly cheep. Don&#39;t even get bread in the bread basket and when you do it is prepackaged so they can reuse it if it is unopened..... 

One more thing before I end this long rant, I usually have the same waitresses every time I go there and lately the service has been incredibly slow!! Not the food part just getting to our table."

Quite cordial when I called with questions over the phone but once my husband and I arrived and the color of our skin became apparent there appeared to be a much more different level of courtesy. Late on a Saturday afternoon when it wasn&#39;t very crowded at all we stood waiting to be seated and after never being acknowledged or even greeted we sat down in the front and continued to wait to be seated even after been seen by both hostesses and stepped over multiple times by a male server and observed by another female server. While we were not only starred at strangly (as if we should not dine there) by a couple of patrons we were clearly shown by the entire staff that we were not welcomed to dine there and even after preparing to walk out we were intentionally ignored and still never addressed or stopped before finally deciding to take our business elsewhere. 
We are are very civil, kind and average looking people (although exceptionally attractive might I add...) so there was nothing about us that would draw unusual attention to ourselves other than what I&#39;d hate to admit in this case...Which is the color of our skin. 
I&#39;m not one to usually admit this but we seemed to clearly be victims of racist treatment...so sad to still encounter such behavior in 2015! UNBELIEVABLE!  We&#39;ll definitely never revisit or recommend this establishment to anyone! 
We&#39;ll be sure to share the truth of our experience in hopes of preventing others from encountering the same treatment. Never Again!"

All the food was good and service was good as far as I can recall. Good experience with the carry out as well.

Saturday Morning weekly breakfast is almost a tradition for me to get and I love the breakfast food.  Its fast and good, and always consistent.  

I love the fact they bring they leave a small coffee pot on your top so you can do your own topoffs also.

Staff has always been friendly and nice, never had a problem all the times I have gone.

I have finally found my go to for dinner/lunch I had tried a few different things and found that the food was not as consistent on those menu items, in particular the few time I tried the Ham Panini it was just bad.  I know usually get the Gyro plate, and some of the pies and am not disappointed."

George&#39;s is a great all night restaurant and the food&#39;s pretty good too.  The servers are like the one&#39;s your grandparents encountered in the 50&#39;s, they know your name and story and can pretend to care with the best of them.  They are on on the ball and your coffee cup will rarely go empty.  The coffee is good too, anytime of day, which is nice.  The really great thing about the coffee is that they bring you a carafe of coffee and refill that when you get low.  I love that. To me it&#39;s one of the best things a place can do.  

The food is damn tasty I have to say.  The real star is the skillets, the hobo skillet to be precise.  I don&#39;t know where they find the magical hobo&#39;s that they use to make the skillet, but hot damn they are the best thing this side of the mason-dixon.  Ask anyone about George&#39;s breakfast and they&#39;ll just say &#34;Hobo Skillet&#34; and smile knowingly like its some kind of inside secret, like ordering your burger animal style and In and Out Burger.  But it&#39;s totally on the menu for anyone to have, so if it was supposed to be a secret it&#39;s not a very well kept one.  But that&#39;s ok, because the world needs to know."

We found George&#39;s online and it had good reviews so we decided to try it. I was hesitant because it said it was open 24 hours and usually that means you get less than edible food. However, I was pleasantly surprised by George&#39;s! The interior was very clean and quiet and the staff was friendly. Even better, the food was amazing! And...even better than that we got two full course meals (entree, soup/salad, and dessert) for $10.00 each! 

There was so much food I couldn&#39;t eat all of mine. I had a linguine pasta with chicken, feta cheese, tomatoes, garlic, olive oil and some other seasonings. I expected it to be bland but it was perfectly seasoned and was wonderful. My salad was just lettuce and a few veggies which was fine because I&#39;m not a veggie-on-salads kind of person. The lettuce was crisp and the dressing was very good (raspberry vinaigrette). They even gave me a good, large amount of salad dressing on the side instead of the piddly amounts of dressing most places give you. We both had dessert, my boyfriend had a chocolate cake and I had a coconut cream pie which was just as creamy as any coconut cream pie I&#39;ve ever had. Oh, and my boyfriend had the saganaki which was wonderful!

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and especially because it&#39;s open late which it seems most places in Lockport are not (besides gross fast food joints). We will definitely being going back to George&#39;s again!"

Tonight we were sitting in the bigger room, not the dining area. We have sat in this room before and didn&#39;t have a problem being taken into it. When we got seated there were 15 teenagers at a long table in the middle of the room. They were very noisy. We could not hear each other talk, and our waitress even said she was having a hard time hearing us. Why they would seat people in here with all the kids is beyond me as there were seats available in the dining room. A sports bar wouldn&#39;t have been as noisy and if I had wanted noise with my meal that is where I would have went. It will be awhile before we return here."

Months before I was craving Liver and found that this restaurant is open 24 hours.  So this time we decided to eat in, and it was pretty good.  Everyone that we interacted with were pretty cool, and i was very pleased with my dinner.  I tried Saganaki for the first time.  It was good, but I don&#39;t think it was worth $7 dollars for a piece of cheese.  For dinner I had a gyro skillet (Eggs, gyro meat, Swiss and American cheese)  and pancakes.  That Skillet was huge, and so good!  I totally recommend that you try that one.  Overall a good experience and I will go back again!

Now as with all family type restaurants I don&#39;t EVER think you should try the cake in the nice displays they have.  They always look so nice, but taste old or just stale from being open in a cooler.  I don&#39;t think those displays do a restaurant any justice!"

Meals: One Queso Lunch Wrap w/ Fries &amp; One Southern Fried Steak Dinner Special w/ mashed potatoes, corn &amp; desert.

J &amp; I are from the area but were driving through and were hungry. Exterior led us to believe it&#39;d be a decent joint but we were leary that it&#39;s attached to a bowling alley. The interior decor was descent although it did make me wonder which era we would generalize it as in, oh say, 20 years. Weird yellow and jelly bean purple with brushed nickle metal scrolls. I think this a good point to let you know that the bathrooms, although pleasantly decorated, were so tiny I bumped all over the place.

Our lunch started with split pea soup which J said he liked. It was creamy and chunks of bacon in it. Also, our server brought the croutons on the side which was nice. My salad was pitiful. It was a bed of wet lettuce with one cucumber slice and one tomato wedge. The dressing was good at least so I drowned the salad with that. 

The country fried steak was awesome. The white/pepper gravy was perfect consistency and seasoned to perfection. Not only did the gravy drown my mashed potatoes it made the fact that they were instant potatoes bearable. The plate also had a dried out looking orange for garnish.

The queso wrap was forgettable and also had wet lettuce. It was served with some yummy fries, though, that came out piping hot, 

We finished our meal with a slice German chocolate cake  &amp; a slice of banana cream pie. I was sadly disappointed as the pies looked so yummy in that refrigerated case but they tasted stale. My pie crumbled all over the plate and the banana pie had browned bananas in it.  

All around the service was fine but I felt rushed at every turn of the meal to get up and get out. When paying at the register the old man did give us a white envelope with my change. It said not to open it until our next visit for a chance to win a free sandwich  (with the purchase of another of course), free food for a year or $10 off our next purchase.  Considering that we won&#39;t be going back we opened the envelope. We won a free sandwich w/ the purchase of another sandwich. Yea......"

Yeah... considering there&#39;s really NOTHING in Lockport open after the bars close, I understand why people are so quick to high star it.
I was formerly a regular here before I moved to the west coast.  Growing up off of State Street, this was super convenient to get to.

Cosmic Bowling till 2am and coffee and nicotine after you say?  Yes please.  Or at least that&#39;s how it used to be before they started kicking all of the regulars I knew out for no reason.

Yes, the staff has been there for YEARS.  Ari, the male hostess is the only person out of the front that was cool.  Slowly but surely, the true colors of the family staff, became a little less to be desired.
On the couple of times I&#39;ve visited since high school, I see that it has undergone a massive renovation.  It really needed it.

Positives: the saganaki, and the coffee.  Beats the hell out of the Ihop and the Denny&#39;s &amp; they service the Strike &amp; Spare.  

Negatives: the staff.  Frankly they killed the whole experience.

Go to the Orland Park Denny&#39;s instead.  Seriously.  It&#39;s a far better alternative if you absolutely have to eat that late and don&#39;t want to deal with drama."

So we are seated in a table chair setting which im not too fond off, asking the server if i could get a booth,, at first he was telling me they were reserved for someone who wanted one, as i started to question him , he immediately said  it willl be only a moment.. Wala we are in a nice COZY beautifull both, even with a miror!!!  lets talk food//

I had the bison Delmonico steak  ,, it was perfect...i love a good steak and this was just that  juicy  and flavorfull.. Wifey had the chicken was was great as well...

However the service last night was less than stellar.  The food was still very good.

We had a party of 7. The wait staff never came back to check on drink refills, the wait for the food was long and then it was delivered incomplete.  The mashed potatoes were delivered 1/2 way through the meal.  We could not even find our wait staff to ask for refills.

Although the manager voluntarily comped two meals I wonder if their staffing plan is adequate.

We will give them another try but was disappointed."

Oh by the way this restraunt is right on top of both of those shops.  We enjoyed the little downtown feel to the shopping mall.  We stopped into the Ted&#39;s Montana Grill expecting a nice dinner experience.  

We started off almost falling on our butts when walking into the place.  The floor was quite slippery.  It seems like it was a different wax or something......now let me stop micro scrutinizing the place.  We were seated at a table and we immediately noticed the lighting was real low and we almost needed flashlights to see the menus.  It was real low but it didn&#39;t bother us too much.  As we ate our meal we noticed the place fill up.  Seems like it is pretty popular.  

The options to get bison on every meal option was really great!  It was expected but we loved how each burger could be ground bison.  We ordered the salmon plank and two bison burgers.  Everything was good tasting and what we expected.  Like other reviewers have noted:  this place is for quality and not quantity.  Do not expect to get a bucket of fries nor a massive amount of food.  But the hand cut fries and daily cured pickles were great.  

That being said above; the service was a bit slow, the food was quite expensive, but we probably will try it in the future.  We do not spend a lot of time in this area but there were some items that caught my interest."

Our first 2 trips were pretty good, aside from the soup never being available at 6 on a Sunday. My daughter like it so much she decided a month ago that she wanted her birthday dinner here. 

Fast forward to tonight, our party of 9 sat down for dinner at 6:50, with 4 children under 7.

My daughter is absolutely devastated. She wanted to come here so bad for her 7th birthday dinner. Too bad our table had no dinner for over an hour. All the other tables are getting served, and they got here after us, unacceptable! The first explanation we got was a little after 7:40 about 30 minutes after we ordered was &#34;I&#39;m sorry its busy and they got behind, followed by shoulder shrugs&#34; our waitress also said she didn&#39;t know how long it would be but they were working on it. (7:50) 10 minutes later I complained to her that a table that sat down some time after us was served their food. She said &#34;well they got salads and things that don&#39;t take long&#34;, I wish I remembered her name. (7:55) Finally, after 45 minutes the manager made her way over. She said the same thing &#34;Sorry, we got behind, but your food is being made&#34;. (8pm) About 5 minutes later our waitress comes over and tells my 72 year old mother they are out of baked potatoes, would you like asparagus instead. Now, its obvious our food hasn&#39;t even been started yet. (8:20) 20 minutes later, still no food, and the table behind us of about 10 people were all served their food, as we all looked in shock! You guessed it, they were seated a good time after us as well, and no it wasn&#39;t salad! This is when my 7 year old daughter lost it she felt hurt and let down, she sunk her head and started to cry. Which broke the hearts of all sitting at the table! I knew at this point I was taking a picture, leaving a reviewing and walking out. (8:25) While I wrote a quick, and short review (added more detail at home) the waitress, silent, brought several ketchup and honey mustard cups to the table. I thought, maybe our food was coming. 5 minutes later I couldn&#39;t bare making her wait sadly, starving another minute. The kitchen was too busy but, apparently only for our table. a few minutes after 8:30 we got up and left, our waitress practically got in my face! &#34;Your leaving? Your food is coming!&#34; To which I loudly responded &#34; NO! We ordered our food well over an hour ago, you have been telling us our food is coming for 45 minutes. It&#39;s my daughter birthday, she&#39;s hungry, her night is ruined and you don&#39;t treat customers this way, you should be ashamed! (Now we had every ones attention) Look around, everyone in here is eating but our table!&#34; She said &#34;its not my fault&#34;, to which my mother and father started ranting! It&#39;s someones fault, and doesn&#39;t seem to be the chef in the kitchen, because food was clearly coming out. I don&#39;t even know where she got the nerve to approach us about leaving with a snotty attitude. She should&#39;ve known better, 8:30 with 4 kids, come on! You also don&#39;t argue with a customer. She should&#39;ve saved herself the embarrassment.

We waited 5 minutes for 4 happy meals and went home. Not exactly he dinner she had planned, but she ate."

Q: What did the daddy buffalo say to his male heir before being killed?
A: Bison.

If that doesn&#39;t tickle your funnybone then see a doctor because that ish is hi-larious!  Seriously people.
But if you think that animal pun is lame then it&#39;s probably because you&#39;re lame, just saying.

I came here for dinner on NYE with Jackie S in tow, for an 8pm seating.  The dining room was rather busy and lightly decorated for the holiday season.  After a brief delay, our server Nyssa (who admitted it was only her 2nd day on the job) came by to take drink orders.  Although she guessed wrong when asked if it was possible to adapt the house margarita for a strawberry flavor (she thought it was, and it wasn&#39;t), the rest of our service was free of problems.  Nyssa did an a-OK job overall.

The food.....was a little weird.

First off, the complimentary bread and butter is replaced by complimentary bread-and-butter pickles (you know, the sweet &amp; sour ones).  Odd, but whatever.  I moved on to a cup of the &#34;Flying-D&#34; bison chili, which came with cheese and fresh sliced jalapenos.  Great flavor, nice and hearty, definitely a step in the right direction.

......aaaand then two steps in the wrong direction, starting with the wedge salad [$6].  Halfway thru, I noticed the lettuce getting progressively more wilted and discolored, to the point where I just pushed it aside, which I hardly ever do.  The portion of blue cheese that came with it was anemic, but thankfully Nyssa offered to bring me more (which I gladly accepted).  Sadly, even xxxtra blu chz couldn&#39;t salvage an otherwise grody quarter head of lettuce.

Then came the burgers.  All the house specialty bison burgers were $17, while their beef brethren weren&#39;t much cheaper (at $15).  Jackie&#39;s &#39;New Mexico&#39;--featuring spicy tomato jam, pepper jack, and guac--was done well, and although she requested it be cooked well-done (not judging you, babe!), she dubbed it &#34;good&#34;.

My &#39;Red Rock&#39; came with diced jalapeno, cilantro, onion straws, and &#39;Z-sauce&#39;, which looked and tasted a whole lot like raspberry preserves.  In fact, I&#39;m fairly certain it was raspberry preserves.  A quick Google search confirms that yep, it&#39;s most definitely raspberry preserves.  I also took exception to the logistics of my Red Rock burger: serving a very thick and decidedly round hunk of meat on a square, almost brittle ciabatta bun was a recipe for disaster, as it proceeded to fall apart in my hands.  At least the kitchen nailed my request for &#39;medium&#39; preparation.

Honestly I wasn&#39;t expecting the best burger of my life, but for that price I was hoping for something memorable.  Instead the bison was rather forgettable, and quite frankly indiscernible from regular beef apart from being perhaps a *tad* leaner.  Those entrées fashioned from ungulates (word of the day, hell yeah!) weren&#39;t cheap, either.  The bill with drinks and tax included came to $65.

Bread = 2.5
Circuses = 3.5

Between my poorly-designed burger and a slightly sketchy wedge salad, I was less than impressed with Ted&#39;s.  There&#39;s obviously an overemphasis on bison dishes, but the vast majority of us can&#39;t tell the difference between it and beef, and the rest of us won&#39;t care (apart from the $2 upcharge on the tab).  I would&#39;ve liked to see a greater selection of appetizers, too.

I wasn&#39;t particularly thrilled with this visit, so I&#39;d like to give Ted&#39;s one more chance.  Stay tuned for more buffalo-related shenanigans (and jokes, hey hey!)"

I like the burger offerings on the menu with ingredients such as horseradish cheddar, blue cheese, avocado, bacon, black berry jam and fried egg.  My burger was good, but too rich for my blood at around $17 a bison burger.  

The kale salad was delicious!  It came with roasted corn, Anaheim pepper, vine-ripened tomato, fresh herbs, and vinaigrette (albeit a little too much on the dressing)."

But let&#39;s cut to the chase - the food.  Instead of bread, they bring PICKLES to the table - cracking good ones too!  And they&#39;ll bring as many as you want.  What I didn&#39;t expect about this is that they are a GREAT palette cleanser!  Have a spicy appetizer?  Have a pickle slice or two and it&#39;s gone.  Fantastic idea and makes it SO easy to play with the flavors of what your order!

The red beans and rice are excellent!!  Not so spicy that they lose flavor (like so many places), and super flavorful!!  Since it was lunch, I did the salmon Caesar salad and it was great!  There was a hint of citrus to the salmon which kept it from being fishy, but not enough to overpower the Caesar dressing (which wasn&#39;t some gloppy pseudo-ranch like a lot of places).  Next time I&#39;ll be back for a burger or steak since I could hear the grill calling during my visit.

One word about the staff - very friendly and very cool.  Kayla was my waitress and she was friendly, fast, and apologized when a drink refill took more than a minute.  A big reason to come back! 

Ok, gotta ammend this really quick - I forgot a $5 coupon when I left and the waitress RAN across the parking lot to give it to me.  And when I say &#34;ran&#34;, I mean RAN, down the sidewalk, around the corner, AND across the parking lot.....for a $5 coupon.  Take what I said about the staff and multiply by 1000.

We&#39;ve tried coming here once every couple of years since they opened.  Seemed they were much better when they were new.  The staff just always seems &#39;off&#39;.  This last visit, our waitress was in trouble from the table behind us and they had a look of bewilderment and then the manager came out.  She disappeared for a long time when we sat down (she wanted to take our order the minute we sat down and we have 2 small kids....didn&#39;t even look at the menu yet).  I guess we were supposed to order right away.  I told the host when we walked in we needed a highchair and he smiled and nodded, then brought us to a booth and looked like a deer in headlights when I asked if the highchair would fit on the end of the booth.   I speak perfect English, not sure where the disconnect was.  But these types of scenarios are common when we come to Ted&#39;s.  Just &#39;off&#39; is the best way to put it.  I also feel like the staff is annoyed by children.   The waitress was spending more time chit chatting in visible sight of customers by the register and we kept trying to ask for the check.  My husband finally had to get up and walk over after we waited 10 minutes.  When you have small kids, 10 minutes feels like an eternity.  

As for the food, very disappointing.  Burgers were dry.  Very few fries.  No one really enjoyed their meals.  Customer service is sub-par.  Won&#39;t be back."

I love the atmosphere and the food is solid. We came in and ordered house-made potato chips with fresh seasoned ranch dip to start (amazing). I had a garden salad (try the BLT ranch dressing!) that was fresh, crisp, and entirely satisfying.

Dinner was a Delmonico Bison ribeye that was grilled to perfection. If you&#39;re hesitant about bison, don&#39;t be, especially at Ted&#39;s. It tastes like top-quality beef, but slightly sweeter (and it is much better for you!) my side was a loaded baked potato that was amazing. And their fresh-squeezed lemonade is refreshing and heaven-in-a-glass. 

I wish we could say we saved room for dessert, but it was not to be. Next time! Oh, and thank you to our AMAZING server, Jen! We&#39;ll be back!"

We picked this four our wedding anniversary, wanted a casual sit down place.  First our waitress Lisa was amazing and super nice.  Well we got there at 6:20 and ordered an appetizer.  We had Bison Chili Nachos, amazing!  We ordered our dinner at 6:50 which consisted of a basic burger and their highly raved about Bison Meatloaf.  Our dinner did not arrive at our table until 8:02!  Yes over an HOUR wait for our dinner.  The burger was excellent.  The bison meat loaf however was not.  The top, bottom and sides were burnt to a crisp.  They ran out of the squash it should&#39;ve came with and automatically substituted for carrots.  They were not going to say anything until I brought it up.  The manager was too busy to come to our table. The table of four next to us ordered four burgers and only had 3 come out and the 4th guy had to wait another 20 min. while his friends had already eaten.

Obviously Teds is known for the bison, so I tried the Bison filet for $33.00, and my date tried the beef filet for $26.00. This price includes 2 sides, and the vegetables and great since never frozen, real fresh.  The Bison filet is great, but honestly does not taste that much different than beef. I suppose the main different could be in the nutritional value, as bison has fewer calories, more protein, and about half the fat.  So it&#39;s worth trying the bison if you haven&#39;t, but beef isn&#39;t a bad option 

I would come againl"

We settled on here after deciding on dining a step above fast casual and running around in the cold at the mall- it seemed to be the only restaurant that didn&#39;t have a wait on Thursday evening dinner.

The ambience and decor is quite nice in here. A giant buffalo head is mounted on the wall which was just the right statement piece for what they were going for. Light fixtures and mirrors adorned every table, and the booths seemed luxurious, spacious and private.

The server was friendly but seemed a little young and inexperienced. She did a perfectly fine job but did not stand out.

I ordered a mule to drink and an Avalon burger on cracked wheat with fries. They both came relatively quickly. The drink was standard, cold with finely crushed ice pieces, no kick of alcohol present. The burger was very good. Enough of blue cheese to add bold flavor, a balance of caramelized onions, and a thick medium rare bison patty, their specialty. The best part was the soft, crumbled texture combined with its juiciness. Also, it was decorated with a tiny American flag toothpick, which was a fun patriotic touch. The fries were fresh and above average, natural cut with skins left on.

Simply put, we left satisfied but not blown away or particularly impressed, specifically in regards to the value. I would expect a restaurant that offers a $17 burger and fries to be top notch in nearly all aspects, but it simply wasn&#39;t overwhelming. My favorite things about the place were the powdered hand soap (more of a gimmick than anything) and their awesome fancy pen (which I stole). That should tell you all you need to know. I would&#39;ve given it a 4, my girlfriend considered it a 3, so ultimately it stands at about a 3 1/2 for being average for its price range but satisfying. While I&#39;m not dying for a return visit, feel free to give it a try- you might love it."

I raved about the one I visited in Georgia to my wife, and she wanted to try one of their bison dishes.

We ordered Bison rib eye steak, as our server, Jennifer, told us that it is better than beef rib eye, and so we did.

The steak was exactly how we ordered, medium rare, and the meat was tender and tasty as Jennifer told us.

This restaurant is not as nice as the one in Naperville, but it&#39;s seems larger in size.  It has a less clean feel to it also.  I made reservations for a Saturday evening, and they seated my parents right away upon their arrival. When the rest of us arrived, we sat there for a good 10 minutes before being acknowledged. So my dad went to the hostess stand asking for our waitress and for some water.  Our waitress Aire was sweet, but not too attentive. I wanted a burger with only blue cheese and she said to order the Blue Creek burger and she would request no bacon on it since it&#39;s a blue cheese/bacon burger. The food was brought, orders were given BUT I was given a burger with some sort of melted cheese, bacon and caramelized onions. I pointed this out to Aire that the cheese did not look like blue cheese nor taste like it, and she insisted that it was blue cheese. Then I pointed out that bacon was on the burger when I requested no bacon and also that there were caramelized onions.  I said the Blue Creek burger on the menu does not have caramelized onions so I was definitely given the wrong burger to which she asked if I liked it. The burger did taste good after I removed the onions and bacon, but the fact is it was NOT blue cheese like I wanted. Very poor customer service and no making amends for the wrong entree being served to me!  The management needs to train their servers better at this location. As a former server myself, I expect better than I got. I doubt if I will go back to this place. I will go to the Naperville location when I want a bison burger as they have better service and a cleaner restaurant. Bolingbrook Ted Montana&#39;s, you failed me. You are just Meh."

I went here with a friend, and I had every intention of ordering a steak, but I was so impressed by their burger menu, that I had to opt for one of their fantastically thought out burger creations.  

I opted for their &#34;Canyon Creek&#34; burger, which  comes with cheddar cheese, smoky bacon, fresh jalapeños, blackberry jam and a fried egg over-easy.  Yes, you read correctly, blackberry jam.  Actually, the reason I went with this one was because my buddy saw that it had blackberry jam and made some kind of comment like &#34;eww, jam, on burger... really?&#34;  And we kinda went back and forth about it because I knew it would work, you just gotta get over the weirdness of it, since lets face it, it isn&#39;t a common combination.  But think about it, the spice of the jalapeño, the saltiness of the burger and bacon, then the sweetness of the jam... that&#39;s called flavor people, and combining sweet, salty, and spicy is a good combination in my book...

I&#39;m happy to report that the burger was delicious, and even my friend admitted that it worked well.  

He had the Bison Filet btw, which was also damn good, though we both agreed that regular beef would have been better and also quite a bit cheaper."

It has a broad menu consisting of meals you don&#39;t find served much. Like bison. Any burger can come in your choice of beef, bison, or chicken. And they have a lot of burgers. I had the bison pot roast--wow. My wife had a monster sized bison burger. We shared some--both were tender and meaty. For those who might find eating bison a bit odd, you&#39;d never know the difference. It&#39;s wonderful. Ted&#39;s certainly knows how to use it. 

Everything we had was fresh and quality. The service was great as well. 

We went around lunchtime on a Monday so it wasn&#39;t crowded at all. I&#39;m sure that helped...but regardless we loved the menu and the food we had. 

Excellent experience. We&#39;ll add this to our list of go-to&#39;s when in town."

Went to Ted&#39;s Montana Grill for Father&#39;s Day. Called a couple weeks in advance to make a reservation for 3pm. It was quick and easy and the guy taking the reservation was very friendly. 
We arrived about 10 minutes early. It wasn&#39;t busy yet and they seated us right away. The waitress took our drink order quickly. Lots of crushed ice which on one hand- delicious. On the other, as my brother put it, &#34;do you want some coke with your ice?&#34; The waitress even asked if I wanted milk or anything for my son (I did not) but it was great she asked/acknowledged him.
My parents ordered appetizers. They each ordered the crab cake. Initially they asked for one order and were told it is only one crab cake. Huh. Ok so they each ordered one at $14 a pop. These came in a timely manner and my parents enjoyed them. They were a decent size.
I ordered the crab cake dinner. Came with 2 crab cakes, asparagus, and kale salad. That was $27. My parents would&#39;ve been better off ordering an entree as an appetizer and they would&#39;ve gotten more and saved a buck, literally. 
The asparagus was cooked perfectly. Not at all stringy or chewy and had great flavor. The crab cakes were perfect and well flavored. The kale salad, for basically being fancy garnish (let&#39;s be honest people, that&#39;s all kale is!) was pretty good and refreshing. 
My brother got the No. 11 burger. He enjoyed it but said it was very greasy and couldn&#39;t finish it. He actually removed most of the bun. This kid loves burgers so that was pretty telling.
Ordered a side of fresh cut fries, mostly so my son had something special to snack on while we ate (he ate his dinner before we left home. I don&#39;t let my kid eat willy nilly) and my brother ate most. They were good as far as fries go.
My dad got a root beer float for dessert. Tough to screw that up. I ordered a chocolate chip cookie and it was a little larger than the palm of my hand. It was good and satisfied my sweet tooth. My mom ordered the strawberry shortcake and split that with my brother. It was huge. They really liked it. The shortbread had a more biscuit consistency but they ate it up. My son tasted some of the strawberry purée and shortcake and he about tackled me when I stopped giving it to him. 
Overall it was a good meal and while it wouldn&#39;t be my first choice while in the area I wouldn&#39;t complain if someone else wanted go. Staff was friendly and attentive. The order was perfect when it came out."

It&#39;s really not that bad, but when you&#39;re paying an average of $14-$16 a plate, you&#39;d expect to leave impressed and satisfied. Came here on an early Sunday afternoon, and had the pleasure of having a great, attentive waitress take care of us. We ordered the Red Rock chicken sandwich (It&#39;s okay, but has jam on it which took away from the jalapeno, cilantro, &amp; fried onion crisps flavor.), The Teds bacon burger, George&#39;s cadillac, And roasted turkey w/ dressing dinner. The burger&#39;s really aren&#39;t worth $14- due to taste and flavor. The only thing worse is I talked my parent&#39;s out of going to eat at that Bass Pro Shop restaurant because I wanted something &#34;better&#34;, and we all left with a big bill and an unsatisfying start to our day."

Finding a restaurant was nearly impossible and Bolingbrook was the best choice between our houses. Every other appetizing restaurant in the mall was already booked, except Ted&#39;s Montana Grill. For that, I was thankful. It&#39;s hard enough to get 8 people together at once.

Ted&#39;s Montana Grill is not a place I have previously been. It definitely has it&#39;s own &#34;charm&#34;. It is meant to feel western, and I seriously felt like I was in a trainer in the wild, wild west.

I originally ordered a mojito. The first one I received was nearly 100% mint &amp; simple syrup (if that&#39;s what they used, I have a feeling they used something else). I sent it back and the second was more of a mix, but still overloaded on the club soda. Maybe I should&#39;ve stuck with one of their signature drinks. 

Our food was decent, but nothing to write home about. 

Our waiter was friendly and outgoing. He was accommodating for a large group and didn&#39;t seem exasperated when I complained of the caliber of my mojito. Not my favorite place, but not horrible either."

It was the first time that we had bison!!! For those who never had it before, I can tell you that it has quite a strong flavor so it is something that you may like or not. It is not obvious! 

My boyfriend had a bison pot roast and I had a bison burger. The pot roast was strictly better than the burger because in the burger the bison was too strong. 

The portions were really big, I had to eat my burger without bun and only a third of my fries and I was already full. 

The prices are average/low. with 25$/person you get a quite nice meal. The service was impeccable! Our waiter was very nice and alway keen on refilling our glasses. 

If it happens to be there again, I will definitely try other recipes with bison in the menu!"

Finally made it yesterday.  It lived up. Burger selection quite good though not all are my taste there was a wide variety.  Looked for an appetizer but selection slightly limited so we passed on that. We didn&#39;t drink so I cannot comment either way on the bar. 

Gumbo was pretty good but a little sweet for my taste, could&#39;ve been a little spicier. 

Bison burger was very good, first few bites are a little off but it was quite good and didn&#39;t feel as greasy as a regular burger. 

Fries are hand cut and very good.  Enough said. 

Can&#39;t forget about the pickles.  Taste like a mix between a cucumber and an underdone pickle. Definitely worked though and my wife and I ate a few to many. I will have to ask what the background flavor was next time. 

Overall good experience and we will be returning and hopefully try something different next time."

The place was not busy at all as it was less than a 1/4 full. We were seated right away, with pickles on the table and menu&#39;s in hand. We were off! We ordered our drinks and I asked for more pickles. When our server finally decided to made an appearance, she went on and on about how another table wouldn&#39;t let her go. Sorry, but that doesn&#39;t even make sense? Your trying to tell us that you were being help captive! Not one of us said a word and she got the message. I ordered the special on her suggestion. It&#39;s a Sunday only deal. Roasted turkey with mashed and cranberry sauce. A little while later, someone comes out of the back and asked me if it was alright if the turkey was all dark meat. Umm. NO! I was told that the waitress should have told me. She went on and on to say that they only make 3 turkeys and sometimes they run out and sometimes they have lots of left overs. Oh! And they were out of the chicken as well! Great, I&#39;ll order a menu and some pickles that I asked for and never got. I had fish two nights ago and had a burger for lunch. With not a foul left, she came by two more times and I just said give me a bison mushroom and swiss. How original, I know. But I was feeling the pressure as everyone wanted to eat. I also ordered the chips and dip. They were delicious, until we got 1/2 way down the basket. It was full of dark shards of tots that you needed a spoon to eat them. We received our meals and they were delicious. Now comes the fun! As it was a birthday celebration, I asked for the dessert menu. The bday lady refused twice until the server said that it was on the house. She recommended the short cake and that is what we went with. I got up and found our waitress to order the cheesecake as well as pay the tab to surprise my friend. Our desserts arrived and none of us had any plates or silverware! We sat there until someone got up and took them from another table. A spoon would have been nice as well to scoop out the ice cream. But there was no one to be found! After we were finished the waitress makes an encore appearance. Looks right at the birthday girl and says, &#34;You didn&#39;t even want dessert and You polished it all off&#34;! ARE YOU F*#$@&amp;G KIDDING ME!!!!! Seriously that just came out of your mouth! We were all stunned and looked at our friend to see what she was going to do to this Kid! Being the lady that she is, she clutched her Louis Vuitton bag and said, It&#39;s time to go! I opened the bill fold that held the check and the only thing in there was the bottom line total. Nothing was broken out and I had no idea if they comp&#39;d the dessert or not? I tip on the previous total, not the end result. But since I didn&#39;t know what that was? I left $20 bucks! Just because I needed this train wreck to end and try to salvage what was left of this exciting birthday party/comedy act."

I haven&#39;t tried anything else, so this review is solely based on their bison burgers.  They&#39;re cooked to order just the way you like, with whatever toppings you want.  I typically like mine simple, with lettuce, tomato, and bacon.  Ground bison isn&#39;t as firm as ground beef, so the burger falls apart a bit more easily, but I don&#39;t mind that.  The burger comes w/ steak fries and housemade pickles.  Their housemade pickles, by the way, are AMAZING!

If you go the bison burger is a MUST. It was so good. If you feel adventurous you can get the avolon. It had guyrere cheese which created a very zesty, smokey flavor. The meat was decadent and melts in your mouth. I&#39;m not sure if it was the bison, but the meat was so tender. Best I&#39;ve had. And as good as the food was the service outweighed it. They take service standards to the next level. When the service is better than the excellent food you know this place is a keeper! Definitely try this place if you are in town."

This restaurant is located in a very busy and competitive part of town. No matter, because Ted&#39;s has no problem standing out as one of the best restaurants in the are. They have a very considerate and professional waitstaff that can accommodate a party of any size. The atmosphere is great. It is a very classy restaurant on the inside, but if you are interested in having a casual lunch here you&#39;ll still fit right in. During the summers I would recommend you take advantage of that beautiful full patio.

The variety of food here is nothing too creative but the twist lays within the option of upgrading almost event dish&#39;s meat from beef to buffalo. The buffalo is a real treat! I have tried the buffalo burger and the buffalo ribs (only available on Saturdays). Both dishes were great! I really enjoyed the buffalo ribs. They were the perfect portion. I would highly recommend ordering a different  side than the buttered carrots that typically come with the dish. The mashed potatoes are good but the carrots are bland and lack any real flavor. No kick!

Ted&#39;s also offers a great variety of speciality drinks, desserts, and milkshakes. I love these options but I would be wary as most dishes here are within the ballpark of 1000 calories before dessert!

Classy place with great service and food options."

The burgers were good. I don&#39;t know what bison burgers are, they taste like cow burgers.

The part that sucked the most was our server at the bar just threw menus at us. Im totally fine with that except for the next people to sit at the bar she gave great service to.

With that, we walked on over to Ted&#39;s!

Typically, I do not frequent places with &#34;Grill&#34; or &#34;Steak&#34; or &#34;BBQ&#34; in the name. This made Ted&#39;s a huge gamble. But a damn good one. 

We started with the Bison Chili Nachos. If you love Cilantro like I, ask for it to be added as it is not a normal topping. The jalapeños on this were out of this world! They were fresh with a nice crisp but not too much spice. Yumm yumm!

I had a type of chicken sando. It came with grilled chicken which they nicely replaced with crispy. Oh and more of those fantastic jalapeños. The only problem I had with the sandwich was the sauce on it. It was almost like a raspberry barbecue sauce. I did not like it. Dining companion had a bison burger of the same variety. I had a bite. It was quite tender. 

If you&#39;re up for it, try the Montana Margerita. I had two. They were fabulous!"

The first is obviously the food.  TMG has a diverse menu and are renown for their burgers and steak.  Odd as it may seam, I&#39;ve had neither.  My favorite two dishes here are the Cedar Plank Salmon and the Cranberry Glazed Roasted Chicken.  I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ve ever had better salmon or roasted chicken anywhere else.  Both dishes come with the best veggies and mashed potatoes too.  Both plates are also what I&#39;d categorize as larger than normal portions.  
Prior to your meal the server will bring out a dish of sliced cukes with a little bit of oil on them.  Even if you&#39;re not a veggie lover I highly recommend these. 
The service in Ted&#39;s is always top notch as well.  Table service is always polite and knowledgeable, and your meals/drinks are always served in a reasonable amount of time.
Okay..now here&#39;s the kicker.  This tip is gonna come off as being a tad weird..but don&#39;t laugh before giving it a try!  Prior to eating you have to visit the bathroom. Ted&#39;s have these boraxo powdered soap machines. Yeah..they&#39;re these old school soap dispensers.  For one reason or another, I get a kick out of washing my hands with the stuff.  Feels good on the hands and you kinda feel like you&#39;re in another place and time.  
Before paying you tab be sure to order a cookie to eat there at the table, or to go.  They have 4-5 kinds (usual suspects: choc chip, oatmeal, etc).  These will rival the best cookies you&#39;ve ever had."

We opted to sit on the Patio.   This was our first time here and we hadnt read the Yelp reviews (just stumbled upon it while walking around the Promenade) so we were surprised when the waiter brought us out some house made pickles.   Sooo yummy.   Just a hint of pickle flavor, wasnt too vinegar tasting.   

We ordered an appetizer of the chips and house made ranch onion dip which of course was perfect (and only $5 I might add).    I wasnt extremely hungry so I ordered a side ceasar salad which had a perfect balance of dressing and cheese on it.   The croutons were nice and soft.   My husband ordered the Bison knife and fork chili cheese with fries and loved it.   Was cooked perfectly and came with a plethera of toppings.

I&#39;m glad we went to Teds. Jen, our server was friendly but also polite and respectful as to when to approach us.
I had the pot roast and it&#39;s the best I had. 
Wine should be discounted if u buy a bottle vs buying per glass.
I mean if they are selling a glass for $8, they should sell a bottle for $28... If there&#39;s about 4 servings. They still make money I&#39;m sure... They sell it for $32...

I mean, we got a bottle coz we love wine... 

Anyways, that won&#39;t stop me from giving this restaurant 5 stars.

There is a server there... Tall slim girl.... She is not our waitress, she brought our appetizer.... She didn&#39;t smile, nor said anything to us while putting the appetizer to our table, which is awkward and mean.

Most of those servers would say something like.... Hi, did you order (blank)? Enjoy!!!

This girl had a poker face... Kinda eerie...

Anyways... We had a great time.

Jen didn&#39;t make us feel that she wanted to get rid of us after dessert... Lol

We went on a Friday night and it was fairly busy so we had drinks and the crab cake appetizer while we waited for a booth. We really enjoy sitting at the bar - a comfortable spot with dark wood decor and ordering a cocktail. The beer selection here is insipid so cocktails are a better option. I enjoyed the lemon drop martini made with Titos vodka and hubby had the big sky lemonade -&#39;bourbon, Cointreau and lemonade. 

Once seated at a booth in the bar area, we ordered bison burgers. I love the variety of inventive combinations available (both beef and bison). My bison burger had guacamole, Anaheim peppers, tomato jam, with a sledges side if roast asparagus. It was very flavorful and juicy! Husband had the #10 bison burger with Horseradish cheddar, slow-braised bison, grilled mushrooms and horseradish sauce - also very tasty, served with nice crispy fries. 
Even though we certainly didn&#39;t need it, we ended our meal with the warm apple crisp laced with caramel and pecans and tipped with vanilla icecream.  It was served in a huge bowl, enough for 4 people!!

I wish I could say the same for today. We were celebrating my wife&#39;s birthday and my mother was with us. They had salad I had chili, the chili was on point with spice but skimpy on bison, more soup than chili. My wife had the rib eye (beef), and was extremely unhappy with it, very fatty piece of meat but cooked well. We&#39;ve had this issue at lesser restaurants but didn&#39;t expect it here. Let me emphasize, unhappy wife.I had pot roast, good initially but too much gravy near the end and the fries were not quite fresh. And the broccoli was barely done (both my wife and I had broccoli), very crunchy and cheesy. Again unhappy wife. Had the brownie for dessert and it was the best thing all afternoon.

I was a bit apprehensive to order it myself, so I just took a spoon full of my boyfriends, and to my surprise, as our incredibly enthusiastic waitress insisted.. it really did taste like beef! The burgers are HUGE and the fries are super fresh. I got the Avalon burger, and was not at all disappointed. Maybe next time I will have the courage to try an actual bison item myself.. but speaking on behalf of the entire table I will say nobody left hungry. The atmosphere is very cozy and there was no wait to sit down on a Sunday evening. The place was conveniently located close to parking and shopping. I have no complaints! 5 stars for sure!"

And I should have known better than to dine at a largely abandoned restaurant at what should have been the busiest time of the day-7:00 p.m.

Although the waitress was very pleasant, she was as scarce as a reticent Italian politician.  I.E. we hardly ever saw her.  And the food really wasn&#39;t very good.  I went with the shaved prime rib sandwich on ciabatta bread, and although it tasted OK, I suspect it contained enough sodium chloride to lay waste to an acre of hardy Illinois prairie.  It was poorly assembled, messy, and sliced in half with a dirty knife (there was some kind of reddish brown residue at the cut line).

My wife chose some kind of salmon salad and indicated that the salmon was so salty that she could go salt free for 6 months and still meet the daily requirement in the interim.

The kid&#39;s mac and cheese with fries was OK, as my daughter devoured the majority of the contents of her plate.  Then again, she&#39;s experiencing a growth spurt, and I think she would eat sea kelp if you put it in front of her."

Pickles delivered to your table, friendly servers, and very good beef burgers. But this last visit was not so great. Probably because this was the first time I was at this restaurant when it was so busy. 
Anyway service was a little slow, no pickles, water or anything delivered to the table. I just assumed they ran out of pickles because they try to make that their thing. Then I decided to finally try the bison instead of the beef burger. Bison turned out to be less fatty and therefore less juicy, either that or it was over cooked. Hint: stick with the beef.
My wife also wanted to try something different so she ordered the prime rib which came out cooler than room temperature. She sent it back and the manager just dumped some salty au jour sauce over it and brought it back. 
If you want a better than average beef burger with a higher than average price then I recommend Ted&#39;s. But stay basic and don&#39;t get too adventurous here. To be fair the manager eventually took my wife&#39;s meal off the bill after the server noticed her not eating her food and said something to the manager.

As we were leaving, we asked for the Manager.  She obviously did not like my complaining where the dining area could see as she tried to get us off into a less visible area.  Gave us a song and dance about &#34;well there was a large group that had reservations&#34;  Honey, reservations mean they get a table before a walk-in, it does not mean the walk-in gets ignored.

It took them forever to remake them and then they didn&#39;t bring the grilled onions that were supposed to come on them. One burger was medium and the other was still well. Even with comping one of the burgers it still was not worth it. The soup was so so and a lot of items were too salty. The only thing that was good were their fries.

I&#39;ve enjoyed both the bison filet and burgers before a lot. Hubby is a big meat and potatoes guy and never runs out of things he wants to eat here,  trying new things a lot. If he orders a starter, his favorites are the bison chili or the homemade chips n dip. I also like their salads, though like a lot of restaurants, most have a lot have a lot of stuff in them that might require some nitpicky ordering if you are trying to watch what you eat. 

My biggest complaint - sometimes (though not always) their vegetable sides are pretty terrible. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s just one person back in the kitchen that doesn&#39;t know how to cook vegetables or what. Sometimes they are fine and I&#39;ve never noticed that problem at the Naperville or Schaumburg (now closed) restaurants.

The last time I went there I got a bison burger with a side of steamed broccoli. I knew the minute I saw that dark green, dingy looking soggy stuff that it was not going to be good. It was sitting in a little bowl in about an inch of green water that had a thick yellow oily texture on the surface. It tasted so gross and watery, I ended up not eating it. Which left me with a $14 bison cheeseburger (that wasn&#39;t quite how I ordered it) and an inedible side. It felt like a bit of a ripoff. Unfortunately it&#39;s not the first time that&#39;s happened there, and it&#39;s happened with other vegs.

The service can be a little spotty. Sometimes it&#39;s terrific, sometimes it&#39;s not great. Everyone seems super friendly, it just seems like lately it&#39;s been a little slower and our orders have been messed up more, usually not noticed until we point it out. I can live with that if they just whip the veggie-ruiner(s?) into shape."

I recently went with my fiancé and future mother in law and we had an amazing and unexpectedly great lunch. Had no idea what to expect besides that I had been told they had buffalo on the menu. The ambiance of the restaurant feels like a high end steak house with lots of wood work and large wooden booths. Even with all the dark wood the large windows make for a beautiful space. The first surprise were the house made pickles which were really good and nice a garlicky. It was really hard choosing what to eat bit I eventually settled on the &#34;Kitchen Sink&#34; buffalo burger. It was one of the best burgers I have ever had! It was a huge buffalo patty topped with ham, bacon, sautéed mushrooms and onions and the normal burger fixings lettuce tomato and onion. It was huge, filing and delicious. The ladies had a bacon cheeseburger and fish sandwich and both loved them. I actually had the Parmesan roasted broccoli as my side which were great to balance out the pork and buffalo fest I was having but I tried some of the fried and they will be my go to on my next visit. I would recommend this place to anyone and will be going back many more times!!"

So I visited their website, and the front page had the October 75th Anniversary Special listed, so I ordered it online for pickup.  

Upon arrival, there was a decent line of people, and it was obvious that they were understaffed (they are hiring).  The gentleman at the counter was very nice and very professional, but I don&#39;t think they ever had an online order before the way he reacted.  Again, he was very nice and professional, and immediately got the manager.  They told me the order would be ready soon, as I arrived five minutes prior to the scheduled pickup time.  

Fifteen minutes later I finally received my food. This normally would not be an issue, except I was on my lunch break and was limited with my time. Also during my long wait, I had time to really examine the restaurant. I would not say that it is unsanitary; however, I would not call it clean. I think this may be due to them being so understaffed. 

All of this would have been no problem if the food had been superb, but it was not close.  I know BBQ is a personal thing, and you can&#39;t please everyone.  The sauce was mediocre, and the pulled pork was quite dry.  The coleslaw that came with it was, to me, inedible. I took one bite and discarded it.  

I really wanted to like this place. It is a two minute drive from my work, and I love BBQ.  I will probably give their brisket a try in the near future. I hope it is better than the pulled pork sandwich. 

In short:

Service: Professional, friendly, but slow.  Understaffed.

Restaurant:  Borderline unsanitary. Needed a good scrub, but I am a germ-o-phobe.  Again, understaffed.

Food:  Pulled Pork a 3 out of 10; coleslaw 1 out of 10; BBQ sauce 4 out of 10."

They say the meat is prepared on site, but it feels weird watching them grab the pulled pork out of a plastic bag and knead it in front of you before it is served. The food wasn&#39;t hot or cold - room temperature. It tasted OK, but would be better if it was warm. The tea had a bit of a mold taste to it, meaning it had been sitting a lot longer than it should be. 

The employees are very apathetic. There is obviously a morale problem here and it seemed I was an inconvenience to them when I ordered my food. The dining room was somewhat clean; they tried to wipe down tables between customers."

First off, I originally came into contact with Dickey&#39;s while working down in Dallas for several months. It became a regular haunt of our team and I noticed that one had opened in Danada. I&#39;m always on the hunt for good BBQ and the stuff in Dallas was better than what I had at a few other chains.

Circle to Friday&#39;s visit here and the only thing I can say is pitiful. Staff had a lack of motivation...dining room was not kept up and the food was tepid. Had the 2 meet special with brisket and pulled pork. Tepid... went for the sauce containers and 2 of 3 were near empty.

Not worth the time..."

While that&#39;s a great deal, we all eventually ventured elsewhere on the menu and found our favorites. 

There are a number of things that are different week to week. Sometimes it&#39;s SUPER crowded and can be a long wait in line, but sometimes it&#39;s super quick. Sometimes the usual (friendly, cool, and super good at their jobs) staff is there, but sometimes there are new faces learning the ropes. Sometimes things get a little hectic with long lines and large take-out orders. 

The one thing that remains completely and impressively consistent is the one thing that matters -- the food. Holy moley, it&#39;s good. I can personally vouch for the pulled pork and chicken plate. 

Though there is a fairly structured menu, it really boils down to a la carte. How many different meats do you want? Which ones? How many sides? You pretty much just tell them what stuff to slap onto your tray and go from there.

It&#39;s all great. But there&#39;s something extra magical about their chicken.

I do have one (hopefully constructive) complaint. The ice cream. Now, don&#39;t get me wrong -- it&#39;s hard to complain about free. And the ice cream is free. Soft-serve vanilla in a cone or cup. It&#39;s a great idea and a nice extra. Unfortunately, it&#39;s usually mixed pretty poorly at this location. Actually, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s how it&#39;s mixed or how cold it is or what. But it&#39;s usually pretty liquidy and runny. Not that this stops me from eating it every week.  Today, however, it was PERFECT.  So whatever you guys did today, keep doing it.

We look forward to our Wednesday escape from the office. Great food, a cool staff that seem to like their jobs, and a clean, comfortable atmosphere."

Now, I don&#39;t care for BBQ food. I just.... no. I only go for the fried okra. Seriously, I know that&#39;s lame but deep down, I&#39;m a southern girl. Just not one that cares for ribs or anything BBQ. 

I stopped here today to get some okra before shopping. I walked in and stood at the &#34;order sides here&#34; portion of the counter for almost two minutes before the employee chopping meat acknowledged me. Strike one.

He asked what I wanted. I placed my order and even ordered the &#34;jalapeno beans&#34; as well. Now, Dickey&#39;s (like most places) have different sizes for their sides. The employee didn&#39;t even inquire as to what I wanted. Now, granted I was alone, so maybe he automatically assumed I wanted the &#34;individual&#34; portions (which is what I ended up with).  But I would think part of their job would be to upsell the customer. Perhaps ask if I wanted the individual or if I was feeling brave, a larger size? Nope. Strike two.

I pay for my order and proceed to fill up two cups of sauce; their spicy and their own sauce. The couple that placed their order before me was clearly taking advantage of the free sauce, as they had ten cups filled to the brim and were still filling more. And THAT is why restaurants are charging for condiments, people! Cut that ish out!

I get my order and leave. I dig into the okra immediately. They were clearly store bought and not housemade. I knew this, but you could really taste it today. Nonetheless, they were edible and I needed a little something in my stomach. 
Onto the jalapeno beans. Oh, well look at that - no utensils. Thanks, high-school employee with a brain to match. Guess they&#39;ll have to wait until I get home. Strike three. 

I guess the next time I&#39;m craving fried okra, I&#39;ll just go to the store and grab a bag from the freezer section for about the same price as the &#34;individual&#34; portion from Dickey&#39;s."

I don&#39;t eat pork so I was craving pulled chicken. They don&#39;t have that, they serve chicken breast in chunks. I sighed, fine, I&#39;d try it. I also really wanted cornbread. But alas none. The chicken sandwich which had the word &#34;big&#34; and it was anything but. The sandwich came with gobs of barbecue sauce on it. Which was way too hot of a sauce to be served on every sandwich as a constant. You&#39;d think with the barbecue sauce bar they had they would just let patrons pick their own. My mouth was on fire and my stomach felt it later. The mac &amp; cheese was so plasticky and overly cheesy; compensating for something I guess. I will give the bbq a thumbs up.

The value: My husband and I can usually split a bbq and both be full. This looked (and felt) about the size of a big kids meal at Burger King. We were both hungry afterwards. Maybe that&#39;s why they give such   Humongous cups.... Anyhow, it was over $11... For one meal. If I was on my own, I wouldn&#39;t have spent that. 

Overall:
I would&#39;ve given it 2.5 stars but no halves are allowed. Service was quick and friendly. The restaurant itself was mostly clean. The ambiance was trying way too hard. The food...nothing special. The value...just not enough to get me to go back."

I used to go to the Dickey&#39;s in North Carolina and I thought their meat was great...smoky, flavorful and their sauces were pretty unique. Additionally, they have many sides you can choose from that were all southern style comfort foods...mac and cheese, fried okra, mashed potatoes, etc. Gotta love that.

The store was clean and the staff were nice. They have deals going on every day of the week, and it just so happened that the pulled pork sandwich meal was $8.99 that day, so I was all about it. It comes with two sides and a drink. Not bad for 8.99. Normally it&#39;s $9 just for the sandwich and the two sides and drink are extra. My dad ordered the two meat platter which comes with two sides, no drink. All together we were looking at about $22 for the two of us. Kind of expensive for lunch, but it&#39;s barbecue so that can be expected.

My sandwich was ok. There were a lot of hard, gritty parts in the pulled pork. The mac and cheese was good, but the loaded mashed potatoes tasted like box potatoes. I&#39;ve had them before at the Dickey&#39;s in North Carolina and they did not taste the same at all. My dad was not happy with his meal. His cheddar jalapeno sausage was cold and they forgot his side of bread.

The food was just ok overall. There&#39;s definitely other barbecue places I would choose over Dickey&#39;s, at least in Illinois. What I did like is that they had a free soft serve machine! Root beer floats all day :-)"

Well, last night at Dickey&#39;s was my second outing with the broken halves of a once happy couple, and even tho I wouldn&#39;t have picked the place myself, I ended up really liking it. 

I was kind of anti-Dickey&#39;s for awhile because after perusing their menu online it looked like there were no healthy options. Even their salads come with wonderful things like fried onions and I hate being the &#34;Hold this, hold that&#34; guy. 

Look, I know I&#39;m not perfect, and I fall off this healthy eating wagon, but I&#39;ve got to at least try, right?

Yesterday was just a disaster because my boss ended up taking me out for lunch to  a place I couldn&#39;t eat healthy at either. So by the time I arrived at Dickey&#39;s I was kind of all &#34;whatever, just get in my belleh!&#34;

I made the mistake of parking on the north side of the restaurant. My friends all parked on the south side, and me being an idiot sat in my car for almost 20 minutes while they ordered their food and started eating. After my faux pas, I was educated that most of the Danada restaurants have two doors. Oops. My bad.

So I ordered a two meat combo with turkey and sliced brisket. I got waffle fries and jalapeno beans because at that point I figured what the hell. Calories for everyone!

Surprisingly, the meat came naked. It was tender, well smoked and fall-aparty. All my favorite things a good BBQ restaurant provides. There were vats of three (warmed) BBQ sauces to choose from. I hate cold sauce. So that was a definite plus. 

The fries were okay. Nothing to write home about. And the beans were not jalapeno-y at all. Nary a single green fleck was found in my container. And they were kind of gross and more refried than baked. I&#39;m not really a bean fan so I&#39;m not sure what prompted me to order them.

My friends&#39; sides looked more appealing. It looked like one ordered potato salad, and one had mac &#39;n cheese. I didn&#39;t ask to sample. 

The food came up quick and there was ample quantity to fill me up. It also came with a dinner roll, which was not stale. 

Will I return? 
Yep. 

Do they get 5 stars? 
No, because they don&#39;t really offer any TRUE healthy option. And their side dishes could use a little work."

In Dallas  you could see all the food and everything looked delicious! In Wheaton, you can&#39;t see anything so picking out your sides is a crap shoot. Green beans were kind of greasy, waffle fries were meh and the pulled pork was surprisingly dry.

I should have went with the bun, maybe I would have liked it more, but I didn&#39;t. so I watch as the guy behind the counter unenthusiasticly picked up a hand full of pork and put it on the scale. Then take some off, a little more, and a little more. It was still a reasonable chunk of meat, but just smaller than what I was used to than other similar bbq places.

Came with 2 sides so I got the beans and the mac and cheese. Those were in pretty big cups. Lady behind the counter was all friendly with the family that was ahead of me, but then when I came up, totally changed personalities. Like Dr. Jekyl Mr. Hyde style. Not that she was mean, just totally uninterested in me. It was quite weird.

They have 3 buckets of sauce. I went with the original. It was alright. My pork was a little dry so I had to pour all my bbq sauce on top of it to the point where it was drenched. Again, maybe if i ordered a bun, I would have had a different experience. My fault. Mac and cheese was pretty good. Beans were alright. Free soft serve ice cream here which is pretty sweet. Yea overall this place was eh compared to others. How some people gave them 5 stars though is hard to believe."

The pulled pork was good but why do they sop your bun with so much butter?  I thought the sauce for the baked beans was too vinegary and ended up giving the beans a sour taste.  Helpful and attentive staff.  The menu did not strike me as being very easy to read.  It was my first time there, it was lunchtime, people were behind me, and I was struggling to read the menu (think of Starbucks -- the &#34;menu&#34; is posted on the wall behind the cashier).  I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to return there.  Prefer Gemattos on Ogden Avenue in Naperville."

I strolled in at just the right time upon my first visit b/c a few minutes later there was a line practically out the door! This joint had just opened and the smell of bbq meats had my mouth watering. I ordered the two meat platter - brisket and pork ribs. I split this with my sister so I ordered an extra side and a roll - in addition to the two sides that accompany the plate. OINK!

The ribs were pretty good...plenty of meat, tender and flavorful. The chopped brisket was also very good. They slice and it and chop it to order right in front of you and you can really taste that smoke on the beef. The sides - I got the jalapeno beans, mac &amp; cheese and potato salad. They were OK, nothing special. I personally did not think the beans were very spicy but my sister did...but she is also super sensitive to &#34;heat&#34;. I think the best side out of these three was the mac &amp; cheese. I think Dickey&#39;s could improve on the sides. 

On my next visit I got the pulled pork sammy with coleslaw. The sandwich was a big hit with me and I put a bit of the coleslaw on the sandwich (which also came with a few pickles and raw onion). I&#39;m a fan. You can get one or all three sauces to go. They are all good and it&#39;s nice that they let you help yourself to the sauces so that you can grab what you want. I&#39;m partial to the sweet but the spicy has a nice kick to it. 

All in all I am pretty happy with this place. The portions are generous and the BBQ is great. I think they still have a few kinks to work out as do most restaurants in their opening weeks. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be giving this place another visit as BBQ joints in my hood are scarce."

Except for the manager, the workers seemed to be off their game somehow.  I&#39;m not going to base my review on the service, or lack thereof, but focus on the food instead.  As any new business, I can understand that they are working out the kinks. 

I ordered the 2-meat plate and here&#39;s my assessment:
Sliced beef brisket - nice smoke flavor and smoke ring but tough and lukewarm - 3 stars.
Pulled pork - dry and not very flavorful and close to being served cold - 2 stars
Fried okra - This was the highlight of my meal and was very good - 4 stars
Cole Slaw - tasted prefab - 1 star
BBQ Sauce - the original is pretty bad - sweet and vinegary.  The hot is not all that hot and probably your best option.  Fortunately, they do respect the &#39;Q&#39; and don&#39;t slather sauce on their meats.  They allow their customers to do that - 1 star
  
I was trying to figure out why the brisket was so tough since it was obvious that it HAD been cooked in a smoker.  I went back to the counter when there were no customers ordering and asked the carver how long they cooked their brisket.  It was obvious that he didn&#39;t hear me.  OK, no problem.  So I walked 5 feet to my left and asked the woman at the register, &#34;Excuse me, can you tell me how long you smoke your brisket?&#34;  I am literally standing across from her at the register and she looks at me as if she is looking through me and says, &#34;Can I help you?&#34;  Huh?? Am I invisible?!  Again, I ask and she glances at the guy at the counter and says &#34;Jeff...&#34;   I finally got my answer from Jeff who said they smoke it for 14 hours.

I might go back to try the ribs but my first experience was nothing special."

Their rib platter with 5-6 pieces of ribs, two sides , and a roll is a great deal at $12.95. My husband ordered their brisket sandwich with waffle fries and baked beans. The ribs, sadly, were tough. Instead of &#34;falling off the bones&#34; tender, I had to pull pieces off as hard as possible - Fail! The brisket sandwich was good and the sides were all very delicious.

I ordered BBQ brisket with a side of green beans with bacon and fried onion tangles (similar to onion rings). 
 The green beans looked like they&#39;re from a can- a weird muted Army green color- and tasted... odd. And the bacon? Not sure where it was but it wasn&#39;t in my green beans. The fried onion tangles were crispy and had a decent flavor. That was about the only item that was- the brisket was HORRIBLE. DRY. HARD. A miserable excuse for brisket.

Either way, it&#39;s unacceptable.&#34;  Famous Dave&#39;s is 5-star compared to this place.  And Dickey&#39;s started in Texas?  I need to contact their headquarters.

We live less than a mile away, and bought a $20 for $40 Groupon, and hadn&#39;t tried Dickey&#39;s yet.  And I&#39;m REALLY glad we didn&#39;t pay full price.

I noticed right off that they take their meats out of the smoker and immediately wrap them in PLASTIC WRAP, and put them in a warming oven.  Not a good sign.  And it was still dry.  A pink smoke ring doesn&#39;t matter if the meat is dry.

The ribs were overdone and leathery. Sure they had a pink smoke ring, but who cares at that point?  They were out of chicken, so we ordered turkey, which tasted like lunch meat turkey, and we took it back and waited for the chicken, which was slightly better (and neither of them are smoked, by the way, they are marinated  What??).

The chopped brisket was dry and cold., the waffle fries were terrible, and the &#34;onion tanglers&#34; were a useless waste of time.

And their &#34;famous&#34; tea tastes like McDonalds tea. It&#39;s Lipton. The only difference here is that you get it in a &#34;Big Yellow Cup&#34; (LOL) for $2.25 (!).

Even the free ice cream was grainy and tasteless.  

SO disappointing, especially for Wheaton!  Do yourself a favor, save your money and reduce your stress and either go to &#34;The Patio&#34; 5 minutes east of here, or to &#34;Q&#34; BBQ in Naperville or Lagrange (my favorite, next to Texas of course)."

It&#39;s a fairly simple process - sandwich, meat plate or baked potato.  Move along.  I wish we could place an order online and then show up and have our food, but it would be cold(er) than usual, so that would suck.  This last time we both got two meat plates mine with turkey and ham and his with brisket and pulled pork.  He opted for the coleslaw (yum) and mac (bleh) and I got the green beans with bacon (tasteless - how is that possible?) and fried okra.  I really love okra - so I am biased, but I LOVE it.  I also love their turkey which is shockingly not dried-out.  But, for some reason, I got 6 slices of the dessicated ham and only 3 of the turkey.  What&#39;s up with that?  I&#39;m not a big fan of the sauces other than the sweet, so I need the meats not to be so dried-out so I can eat them plain if necessary.  Husband enjoyed his meats.

Well...The last two time I was there we did not get the garnish, the order was questionable as not sure how we were charged, (I think they gave us a kids meal for the small sandwich with a child size side dish) the food was cold, the pickle jar is gone the meat is all stored in individual plastic wrap then mashed up on your plate once ordered. You have to give your side order once the meat is put on the plate and waiting the 5 minutes for a side dish makes your meat cold.

The cole slaw tastes like they got it at the KFC drive-thru and the mac &amp; cheese was nothing special either (definitely didn&#39;t taste homemade).

On to the meat - the smoked chicken is easily my favorite of their offerings.  Chicken is usually my last choice when choosing my bbq, but not at Dickey&#39;s.  The chopped brisket is also great.  Ribs are good, and pulled pork is average.  Their hot bbq sauce is some of the best that I have had, the sweet and regular offerings are good but not great.  Full disclosure - I live quite close to this place, so convenience adds to my score - but I would drive to get their yummy chicken and hot bbq sauce often if I were farther away.

All the food is all made to order. My son ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was shredded right in front of him and served. My Texas style chopped brisket sandwich was served in the same manner and was very tasty. It included a few pickle and onion slices. I have never had those on a brisket sammy before and found that it added a nice flavor.

They serve the sandwiches without sauce which I like. I like to add it myself. The sauce is thinner and vinegar based. Not at all sweet and thick like some sauces.

The sides were very good. I am a coleslaw freak. I found there&#39;s to be both creamy and crunchy. Perfect combo for slaw.

Found out about this place through Groupon. My wife and I came here on a Friday night around 6:30pm.  Perhaps if the counter staff were efficient the layout of the ordering process would make sense.  There were about 5 people in line in front of us and it moves really slow.  They first ask you what you want meat wise and then you move to the next station for your sides and then collect your food and pay the cashier.  If this was a cafeteria this would make sense but they need to cut your meat, or fry or heat up your sides and it makes the line move slower than it should.  

My wife and I both ordered 2 meat plates with the Texas cut brisket and the pulled pork.  For sides I ordered the baked potato casserole and green beans with bacon.  My wife got the potato casserole and the fried okra.  The meat order taker asks if you&#39;re dining in or want it to go and is supposed to set the plate/container with the meat and pass it off the person handling the sides.  By the time we get to the cashier and our food is assembled it&#39;s all wrong.  They&#39;ve put everything in to go containers and have all the wrong sides.  We tell the cashier and they dump our food out of the containers onto metal plates for dining in.  They still need to make new sides for us and we end up holding the entire line for a few minutes more. I understand that the people may be new but it took a few times for them to give us the correct sides and the people serving our food were not pleasant about fixing our order.

Anyway we get our correct food a few minutes later and sit down to eat.  Unfortunately by the time we do sit down to eat our meat had been sitting out long enough that it was no longer warm.  This wouldn&#39;t have been a problem if the meat were flavorful.  The texas cut brisket which was advertised as juicy was mostly dry and tasteless.  The pulled pork was just ok but a bit on the dry side.  The only way to get any flavor to the meat was to add the bbq sauce.  I got the original and hot spicy, they mostly tasted the same, the spicy just had a tiny bit of spice. I&#39;ve always felt that the meat should already have flavor and the bbq sauce was to enhance it. but the meat and the sauce are both poor.

As for the sides the baked potato casserole is just mashed potato with cheese on top.  The fried okra while made to order sounds like a good idea, but the oil seemed old and the okra slimy.  The green beans with bacon had hardly any bacon and it tasted like the beans came out of a can.

Lastly by the drink station they have an ice cream machine and it says free ice cream.  So we thought well at the very least we&#39;ll get some free ice cream.  We both got small cups of the soft  serve ice cream and hoped that we&#39;d end our meal on a good note.  Wrong, the ice cream had very little flavor and was worse than ice milk.  

Our groupon was 10 for $20.  If I had paid full price I would have asked to speak to someone, at only $10 for the two of us I&#39;ll write it off as a life lesson.   Save yourself the tasteless calories  and find a better bbq place."

It appears from these reviews they have been open for about 2 years. If they haven&#39;t figured it out by now they never will.

This trip there was no one in line so  I thought we would zip thru. Nah.  

I ordered the brisket sandwich, fries and cole slaw, my wife the brisket salad. Pretty straight forward, yes? 

The first person cuts the meat and puts mine on a bun hers on a plate and passes it down. The side girl then assembles the salad while the meat sits. After that she drops the fries into the oil and digs out the slaw. All this time the meat is sitting on the counter. 

By the time I got it to the table and took a bite it was absolutely cold.  

I think the woman, a girl and a boy who work there are the owners. They certainly have not been trained by the franchisor"

Onion ring things were also good.

I was disappointing on the amount of food for the price

I had the 2 meat combo 4oz ribs and 4oz brisket (found that out after getting a receipt). They actually weighed the ribs!! I couldn&#39;t believe it!! that is just absurd!!  I laughed at the guy and said really?? the brisket was alright little dry and not much flavor maybe a small smoke ring but not something to praise about. The ribs had a good flavor and tender. The sides were good, had okra and mashed potatoes, the roll they give you is really good its kind of like a ciabatta roll. I don&#39;t really eat too much and normally have leftovers but was able to finish it all. So if your a big eater prepare to pay for a decent size meal. 

My girlfriend had the pulled pork, mac and cheese and fries. The pork was ok not much smoke little bland had to soak in there sauces which are in my opinion not that great tastes really sweet

Overall it is an alrite bbq joint nothing too special go ahead and try it out."

I tried the two meat platter. Pork and turkey. Got green beans, okra, and cole slaw. I should have known this was going to be a disaster when I saw the guy behind the counter pull out the turkey. It looked like one of those pathetic Jenny-O things. He sliced off a piece and then kind of broke it into chunks. So I definitely do not recommend the turkey. It is processed or injected or something and tastes awful. The pork was barely fair. The sauce is very peppery and hot. Wish I had known there was a choice. The coleslaw was average. The green beans were extremely peppery and salty, like painfully salty. The fried okra was dull and crunchy... Isn&#39;t it supposed to be a little soft have some kind of interesting flavor in the batter? I feel bad giving this place a negative review. The guys behind the counter were really nice. But it is really just nothing special. I won&#39;t be going back."

So I went the very next day. (Yesterday) Its hard for me to understand the negative reviews here. This place is totally awesome and has fantastic food! The prices are LOW. Half a slab of huge ribs and two sides for $12. I have not seen prices this low anywhere. The size of the sides were large as well. They have three bbq sauces. Sweet, Original (Med) and Spicy. All are kept hot. I had all three and all three were good. The ribs were huge and as advertised, fall off the bone tender. We had the fried ocra, onion tanglers, pototato baked thing and mac and cheese. All were great. To top it off with free ice cream after your done just cant be beat. The only suggestion I have for improvement is that the ribs need to be served hotter and the soda needs to come in sizes. That huge drink for $2.35 is too much for me. Overall one of the best BBQ places there is. I will be back as often as my waistline can handle it. And the owner was very friendly and hard working. Cant wait for my next visit."
dickeys-barbecue-pit-wheaton,Brittany S.,9prihDy10wXkyNnZy_XLRw,"Lisle, IL",0,1,0,1,3,dXFKq4fC5GdOZLkKXDpQXQ,3.0,2011-12-02,"I would give it 3 and a half stars. 
Firstly, the food: I ordered the two meat plate (which comes with two meats and two sides) with chopped brisket and pulled pork. The pork was pretty good; nice and tender. The brisket was kind of luke warm, but very tender and had good flavor. For some reason I thought they were going to be both sandwiches? But it was just the meat with a roll on the side. For my sides I got the waffle fries, which were really good and the BBQ baked beans, which were incredibly smoky. I enjoy smoky flavor a lot, but this tasted like the beans were literally dumped on top of a campfire. Too smoky for beans. Free ice cream was good -- free with every dine-in purchase. I had original sauce, which was very good. 

Second, the staff. Ok, to give them credit, they are still starting out (only been open a month) and I think they could have used one more person on the line serving food. Took the guy a while to chop and separate the meats (and they literally weigh each one to make sure you&#39;re getting no more than 4oz), and the poor kid getting sides had to do everyone&#39;s sides while switching the fries and monitoring everything that was frying so it seemed like it was just too much work for one person. I think the service would have felt better if they took your whole order first, made it, and then ran it to the table instead of having you watch them make the whole meal because it felt like a long time. 

The restaurant itself is kind of set up weird, so it&#39;s a little confusing to get drinks and sauce, but any person with common sense can figure it out. I think I would have liked it more overall if they made the appearance less nice, actually. I expected more out of it because it looked like a nicer place. 

Overall, I think they just need to get in the swing of things. The food was good enough to come back (but I&#39;m not getting beans again), but I&#39;ll give them a few months to sort it out."

To start off, the menu was very unorganized and difficult to read, and it took a good couple of minutes for any of the workers there to even acknowledge us. Talk about bad service. As for the food, I ordered the ribs with a side of fries. The fries were okay but the ribs were absolutely terrible. Horribly greasy, large chunks of fat, and a fake smokey flavor. I felt sick the whole rest of the day after eating there. My mom got the pulled pork and by the looks of it it was completely dry and she said it lacked any flavor. 

This would be a 1 star review if not for the free ice cream when you dine in and the side of bread, which was pretty good. Overall I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be going here again."

The adventure began at the moment of our arrival. The greasy manager fellow was standing around looking useless, just like last time. He seemed to be greeting other people but expressed no interest in my two friends and me. These are my two compatriots from the last time I went.

&#34;Let&#39;s go to Dickie&#39;s they said. It&#39;ll be fun, they said.&#34; Yeah. So, with high hopes and our spirits levied by the promise of time, we made our way to order.

I ordered the half slab of ribs. Now, this was an adventure because the menu boards are entirely impossible to understand. It looks like a vomit salad tossed in colors and pictures with assorted barbecue related words nestled among the ghastly array. My two friends ordered a pulled pork sandwich and the two meat combo.

The peon taking our order seemed indifferent if not entirely uninterested in being at work. This feeling was echoed and indeed amplified by the girl who assembled our order. I was asked &#34;what sides do you want?&#34; My assumption, for lack of a clearly identifiable  menu, was that an $11.50 half slab of ribs would come with sides included. Boy was I wrong! 

The cashier looked at me with glazed eyes, vacant expression, and displaying utter contempt for the notion of enthusiasm declared, &#34;that&#39;ll be $17.50&#34;. I was in no way prepared for that 6 dollar disparity. As it turns out, that side was 2.25 and the drink was 2 dollars. Once again, I am surprised that this place is still open. I am surprised that more people haven&#39;t read my prior review and avoided it like the plague. I am surprised that anyone goes to Dickie&#39;s at all, even as a joke. Yet, there were still people there...eating this gruel!

The food:
My ribs were as expected; gritty, mealy, half warm and salty with fake smoke flavor abound. The sauces were basically the same with varying levels of sugar and sadness. I wonder whether the sauce is just vinegar and some tomato paste mixed with pee and resentment. The fries were fresh...FROM THE FREEZER. Under salted, sodden, greasy and flavorless are some of the few adjectives i can recall from the otherwise unremarkable potato experience.

The sandwiches:
Cold. Flavorless. Meat? Questionable origins and questionable ingredients made these sandwiches about as palatable as horse crap floating in a river of shame. 

The mac n Cheese: rubber? polyurethane? For display purposes only? cold. Gelatinous and made of imagination and unicorn tears.

My friend was double charged at the register. I was sassed by unpleasant and bristly employees. The training and experience was clearly not there. No one cared and no one will.

In summary, if you learn nothing else from this review please know this: Dickie&#39;s is a place of unpleasantness and poor quality slop. Save yourself the sadness and anxiety that walking into this place will cause.

Original, 11/19/2011

Went there expecting mediocre fare. Boy was I disappointed! The staff was disorganized and couldn&#39;t seem to work the cash register. They didn&#39;t know what things cost or what sides were available. The layout of the place is identical to the Quiznos that had occupied the spot prior. It&#39;s really not very clear where to go or how to order. Especially since the staff is clueless. Nice, but completely clueless.I ordered the slab of st Louis ribs, my two friends had the pulled pork. The ribs came out to about $23...more than famous Dave&#39;s which is way better. The ribs were disgusting. Lukewarm at best, flavored mostly with fake smoke and desperation. They had come out of plastic wrap inside a large warming container... And tasted pretty bad. The texture was mealy and tough. The sauce was so unrelentingly boring that I had to mix them all together to get something close to pleasant. The fries were sodden and greasy, under salted as well.The sandwiches were cold and mostly flavorless. I can&#39;t imagine that the free soft serve made up for this in any wayIn summary, if you are looking for BBQ go to a real BBQ place. You&#39;ll end up spending the same amount and you might actually enjoy it.If I could give this zero stars I would. Worst dining experience I&#39;ve had in a long time."

I had the pulled pork sandwich and my husband tried the chopped brisket sandwich. Both were very good, and the meat was tender. The sauces were terrific either alone or combined. The Spicy sauce isn&#39;t too hot, but perfect for a little extra punch.

You know, capitalize on the BBQ craze, low overhead, manageable build out, high margins....I don&#39;t know why, I just have that feeling.  I must say, though, that this place is tight.  I visited at a late hour (about 8:00 p.m. on a Wednesday) and it was clean and bright, and staffed by a couple of nice, earnest young dudes.  
I tried the pulled pork with waffle fries and I was thoroughly impressed.  The sandwich was piled high with flavorful, moist pork, and the BBQ sauce was used sparingly, which I always take to mean that the pork stands on it&#39;s own, and doesn&#39;t require a bath in BBQ sauce to render it palatable.... and it did, it was delicious. I would invite the manager to make extra sauce more readily available, however, as there was none to be found.  And although the kid tending the deep fryer required a few pointers to get his fry cycle perfected, the waffle fries were grease free and delectable.  Being a pickle snob, I must say that the free jumbo dills leave a little to be desired-rather infirm and somewhat mealy- but they weren&#39;t bad.  I didn&#39;t try the free soft-serve icecream, but I made a mental note to give it a whirl the next time.  And there will be a next time."

I looked at the online menu, which was fine but not very descriptive in terms of having only three sandwiches, picnic platters etc.  Once I went to the online order menu I realized you could get a marinated chicken breast sandwich(that is what my wife wanted).  I wanted ribs but I could not tell if the rib platter was a full slab, half slab etc.  Our son also loves ribs so I figured what the heck, order the family picnic that claims to feed 3-4 people.  Upon picking up the order the smell was great, however once getting home I could not believe the portion of the ribs.  I laid it out on a plate and not even a full slab.  Also when they weighed out the 1lb portion the menu describes they must include bones with out any meat on them as I had about 5 of them in the to go container.  I was beyond disappointed and so glad I did not assume this would feed 3-4 people as myself and a 7 year old are fighting over a 2/3 slab of ribs.  Sides were delicious and thank goodness we got the baked potato casserole as we had to fill up on carbs.  Although the food was delicious for $25.00 for a picnic dinner I would have at least expected a full slab of ribs if not a slab and a half.  Food was good which is why I am giving it 2 stars, prices for quantity of food..almost $40.00 for a chicken sandwich, two orders of fries(one big), two orders of baked potato casserole(one big), and barely 2/3 a slab of ribs seems outrageous.  Probably will stick with other bbq joints in our area that actually fill you up if not leave you leftovers for less money.  Good luck Dickey&#39;s, I will be spending our take out BBQ money on Gemato&#39;s Wood Fire in Naperville

Sides of  potato casserole (good) and jalapeño baked beans (just okay)   Mixed their hot and sweet sauces and it had a good flavor.  My roommate had the beef brisket (chopped) and said it was warm, but not hot.  Coleslaw was good.   I like the crushed ice for the soda.  More places should use it.  Liked the fake silverware too (not sure why).  Wet naps were big and most, a must for BBQ.  They only had one size drink option which I thought was strange.  I would go back for the ribs and would like to try other menu items.  I think it&#39;s a good filler for the void Famous Dave&#39;s left when they closed the store on Ogden.

I found out about Dickey&#39;s from a coupon for &#34;buy one get one pulled pork sandwich for free!&#34; I thought it was pretty good and so did my father. The sauce was really great.

Tried Dickey&#39;s again, and this time got the Family pack. I ordered online and went to pick it up like a half an hour after the time it was said it would be ready. When I got there the line was starting to pick up. When  I went to pick it up at the counter the order wasn&#39;t prepared. So I had to wait, which is weird because I had placed the order over an hour before. I also felt weird because online it said that all orders made in advance would be ready to just easily pick up at the pick-up counter. Anyhow, everyone liked the food.

Recently ordered the family pack again. this time it wasn&#39;t as good. It seemed like they skimped on the portions because last time we had three people and lots of leftovers that lasted for days, while this time it was only two people and the leftovers only lasted one more day or so. Plus it looked like they put the sauce container in the microwave because the bottom of the container was melted.

Here&#39;s my rating on the foods I&#39;ve tried at Dickey&#39;s

Southern Pulled Pork: really good pulled pork, fall off the bone kind.  the only thing I don&#39;t like is the yucky chunks of fat that usually make there way into their servings (usually at the bottom of the container).

Sliced Beef Briskets: pretty good.

BBQ Sauce: good

Barbecue Beans: good
 
Green Beans w/ Bacon: really good.

Dill Potato Salad: so-so

Baked Potato Casserole: really good

Rack of Ribs: awful. worst I&#39;ve ever had. tasted like deli ham.

Bread Buns Provided in Family Pack: not that great. small and tasted like they were just unfrozen. I would prefer nice fluffy hamburger buns.

Customer Service: friendly


Here&#39;s my advice to the owners: the layout of the restaurant and the menu board. 

I don&#39;t understand why it is that with their restaurant being so large that it literally takes the room of two store units (hence the back and front door) that they decided to leave such a small workspace for their employees. I don&#39;t know how they function at all with that tiny of a counter space in front. they have like a whole team of people with the food in this little tiny space! why is this necessary? i mean, half of the tables in the restaurant aren&#39;t even being utilized because most people order to-go. I think this slows down the speed and makes things more chaotic for the employees when the line is really long. I mean, when it is slow it&#39;s not that big of a deal, but on a Thursday or Friday night it can get crowded and as I said, the tables in the back aren&#39;t ever/hardly being used. Not once did I see the tables in back being used. 
My advice? take out a bunch of the patron table space and convert it into a larger workspace.

the menu board. you can&#39;t read it. whoever did the work for you should give you a refund.
my advice?  don&#39;t bother with the printed boards. get an old-school white board menu board with the plastic black and red letters that you can slide in. also is economical because if you update the menu you can easily change things."

The kid behind the counter said I shouldn&#39;t order the ribs with the two meat plate because the meats are put on the plate by weight and I would probably get only ONE rib with the two meat plate.  Just when I thought I heard it all.  How cheap can one restaurant get?  Replaced the rib with brisket.  Food was ok but on the bland side hence the two star rating.

There are some nice tables inside if you want to eat in.  You get in line to order and you order directly fromt he person making your sandwich which was a bit confusing.  She had to call to a young man in the back to put down my waffle fries. The pulled pork sandwich was meaty and delicious.  A bit expensive for what you get.  I ordered waffle fries as a side dish but didn&#39;t know how much they would cost as there are no prices for side dishes on the menu board. (I think they prefer you order a &#34;meat&#34; plate with two sides for about $10.)   I did not receive a receipt calling out the prices either.  I figure the small, stingy, portion of waffle fries cost about $2.50 since the sandwich was $5.50 and the total came to $8.12 with no drink. I might give it another chance."

The crust is flaky and flavorful, the sauce isn&#39;t overpowering or too garlicky, the cheese is so rich. I&#39;ve been to this location twice and haven&#39;t had any issues. I recommend their regular and thin crust pizza because they&#39;re both satisfying! Our past servers were warm and had genuine personalities so that&#39;s a huge plus too. Can&#39;t remember much about the prices, but I would imagine they&#39;re somewhere in the ballpark of what their pizzas cost in the frozen section of Walmart. Great Chicago pizza company and definitely worth a try at least once. Only giving it 4 stars though because the restaurant feels very cramped, like there isn&#39;t enough elbow room between the tables.

They weren&#39;t busy on a Saturday night, which we thought would be good for us. I had a ginormous crack in my glass of pop our waitress brought me. How she didn&#39;t realize that, I don&#39;t know.

The pizza came out hot and tasty. However, just went to eat a leftover piece and there was a piece of HAIR in the crust(obviously not my own, as it was stuck in the pizza.) I was so grossed out. Then my husband tells me he had a piece of hair on one of his slices yesterday while we ate there.

So nasty. Will never come back to this location. Will drive the extra distance to the Darien location. Never had a broken glass or found hair in our food. Barf."

It is certainly better when you eat it there as it is crispier and warmer. The reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is it is pretty expensive in comparison to other similar pizza places. It tastes very similar to the frozen pizza which is MUCH cheaper. However we used a $10 off coupon so it wasn&#39;t too expensive.

I was told this was the place to go.  So a co-worker and I came here to get our fix.  We ordered the pretzels to start.  The order comes with 3 pretzel sticks and 2 dipping sauces.  The cheese and mustard were both decent as were the pretzels.  I think I am getting burnt out on this as a starter as I&#39;ve been getting it a lot lately.  

We ordered a large (16 inch) Chicago&#39;s Best which is sausage, pepperoni and smoked bacon.  They really put a good amount of meat on their pizzas, I&#39;ll give them that.  The pizza comes cut into squares and has a butter crust.  I thought the pizza was decent but I think it was hyped up to much before hand.  Not to mention it costs 30.50 before taxes.....say what!?!?!  Glad it was paid for by work.  

They have much more on their menu and seemed like a nice enough place but it&#39;s not worth the price for my money."

We ordered the large Caesar salad and were pleasantly surprised to find it way more than your usual Caesar. Bits of meat and cheese slices. Very tasty.

The real treat was the Carolina BBQ pizza. An amazing combination of bacon, caramelized onions, chicken, and a golden mustard BBQ sauce. Oh my. Best pizza I have ever tasted. There were audible gasps at the table as we took bites.

I love home run inns pizza especially this one. I order it well done cause it gives the pizza more flavor and the crust is perfect. The service here when I&#39;ve dined in is ok.

We waited about 10 minutes the other night when there were at least a half dozen tables available. Then it took about 15 minutes for the server to even come over the first time. 

Another time our waitress was in such a hurry she just walked by our table talking. If what we needed wasn&#39;t visible on the table, we didn&#39;t get it because she couldn&#39;t stop to talk to us. I think our dine in tradition may turn into a takeout."

I ordered the chicken Alfredo tonight because I was craving pasta, I DO NOT recommend the pasta, but that&#39;s ok...who comes to HomeRun inn for pasta anyways?

We opted for the lunch buffet, and so did many others. It was packed! We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.

On to the buffet. They had an excellent harvest salad with fruit, cheese crumbles, and a vinaigrette. The pizza was just as good as the frozen version, but of course many more varieties were available. Only two meatless varieties were available, cheese (of course) and spinach/roma tomatoes on a garlic crust (amazing). They also had soups and pastas available, but I didn&#39;t sample any.  They topped all of this with a dessert table containing a pull apart blueberry lemon treat. Sooooo good! 

Of course we&#39;ll probably return on a future visit. It&#39;s not your typical &#34;Chicago style pizza&#34; as it&#39;s a thin, buttery, almost cracker-like crust. Their sauce is a bit sweet and they use a lot of yummy cheese. Soooo good! I&#39;m looking forward to my next frozen one that&#39;s waiting for me in the freezer."

+No coke zero here unfortunately

Our pizza came out piping hot,gooey cheese and a thin cripy crust.  Delish!  We washed it down with a crisp angry orchard.  Can&#39;t go wrong with pizza and beer..i mean hard cider,right?

But the real reason i gave it 4 stars is because we had desert.  We ordered the banana foster breading pudding with vanilla ice cream.  OMG!  I could have slapped anybodys momma at that point but none was around.  Lol
It was so good and moist and if we hadnt scarved it down quickly i would have taken a pic.  And i really dont like bananas but the &#34;chiquita&#34;in me must have came cause i ate those. Lol"

Ordered the 3 choice sampler which was a joke at an overpriced $15 (check out the picture I posted).  Salad wasn&#39;t great and overpriced.  OK so give Home Run the benefit of the doubt since they are a pizza place.  
Most importantly, their pizzas are not worth $25+.  They don&#39;t taste any better justifying that overly inflated price.  Conclusion, pizza is overrated and overpriced.  High prices are not justified.  I am not saying their pizzas taste horribly bad.  Just saying they are on par or marginally better than Pizza Hut and similar.

It was ok.  I would just note that the sausage was slightly salty, and the cheese and toppings tended to disengage or slide off the crust (probably due to the layering of sauce in between).  Overall, not bad, but just not in the same class as a Connie&#39;s or Lou Malnatii&#39;s.  A 16&#34; two-toppings large went for $24.50 pre-tax.

My family is all out there, and so when I come back I try, usually unsuccessfully, to appeal to the family that eating pizza and Italian Roast Beef for every meal is perfectly acceptable.

But alas, when they do give in and we get a pie, we always come here. I love the flavor and I&#39;m a huge fan of the pies that are cut square rather than in big slices, like this place does!

So for me, it&#39;s what I look forward to when coming out to Chicago!"

First of all, the staff here sucks. The girls behind the counter were rude and dismissive and had no interest in dealing with takeout orders, only in flitting around trying to be cute to the waiting customers. We saw them put our pizza out on the massive rack behind the counter, and when we told the girls it was there they claimed it wasn&#39;t ready yet. 10 minutes later, they deigned to give us our pizza. How kind. Needless to say, by the time we got it home, the pizza was cool. Goody. 
Speaking of the pizza, after we got it home and microwaved it, it was pretty unremarkable and tasteless. There was nothing good about it, no seasoning, no extra cheese (like we ordered). It was like eating bland. Yawn. Definitely not worth the price or the aggravation of the wait. 

As a non-local, I can&#39;t believe the awful pizzas here merit their own frozen versions in the grocery store. I thought that was reserved for good pizzas, but I guess I was majorly wrong. God, Chicago has gotta have better pizza than this garbage. Skip this one!"

My complaint isn&#39;t with the quality but lack of variety. I&#39;ve been to the Downers Grove/Woodridge location for their buffet several times and they have a huge spread. So when we went to the Bolingbrook one, I was expecting the same thing. I was wrong.

It was of course about six varieties of pizza. But what was lacking was the selection of salads and side dishes like other locations. Usually there&#39;s chicken strips, pastas, sausages, salads, etc. It wasn&#39;t here except the chicken strips but nothing to dip the strips in. Not marinara, no ranch, hell not even ketchup. I was kinda disappointed because I know other franchises have better spreads for the same price. 

The service was really good. Our drinks were always kept filled and the napkins were a-plenty. But like other reviewers said, &#34;What&#39;s with all the chubbies?&#34; (I say that with love as a fat girl and frequent buffet diner). It&#39;s ironic that Jenny Craig is only next door. Did they escape? I felt like I had to fight to get a slice of pizza. 

Pizza is great, service is good but selection is limited. Dine at your own risk especially when fighting with Bertha for a pepperoni."

The bar was offering a special on a mint melt away martini and it was friggin amazing! And only $6! Needless to say I had two! The service could have been better but I&#39;ll chalk it up to the hostess stand being staffed by teens who just got their work permits and our waitress was nice but just seemed overwhelmed. She would disappear for a pretty long time because she was working two sections. Surprisingly of all the food we ordered (rigatoni, hardest salad, wings, and pizza , the pasta was by far the best selection. Hri&#39;s pizza is quite frankly about the same as the frozen one and was therefor underwhelming. 

I&#39;d say save this place for a night when you&#39;re so tired that you neither want to drive far or cook. Prices were just low enough to make up for all the hings this place lacks."

We went on a recent Friday night and it was one of the better experiences we&#39;ve had there (never a bad one).

The waitress (Cyndi-sp.?) was something else.  Full of energy and stopped by at just the right intervals and times.  Combine that with her awesome accent (very Chicago) and it reminds you of the character(s) we have in this part of the world.  

Food-wise all positives as well.  The cheese garlic bread is remarkable-two large loaves of bread with a more-than-generous amount of fresh garlic, butter, and perfectly melted cheese.  We took some home and it was still great two days later!  The pizza was well done as always with the unmistakable crust and just-right browned cheese.  I tried the meatball grinder and really enjoyed it.  The meatballs were a perfect size-not too small or large and just a little bit of sauce was on the sandwich, but a cup of sauce was on the side.  It was meat sauce, which hit the spot.

While it&#39;s not the cheapest place around, you do get a good value in terms of the quantity and quality of the food and their draft beer is just the right temperature!"

The location itself is quite nice and offers a lot of seating. We were seated right away and ordered our drinks and an appetizer. We then ordered our pizza and added the buttered crust. As  many have said, the service is a bit slow. When we got our pizza, I was a little  disappointed. The pizza wasn&#39;t bad....but I personally like the frozen pizza better. The butter crust that we paid extra for didn&#39;t taste buttery or any different than normal crust. My husband, however, thought the pizza was pretty good.  We will likely be back in the future, but I personally would rather have the frozen pizza. It&#39;s cheaper, has thicker crust, and more flavorful."

Although I have had, on only a couple of occasions, the frozen Homerun Inn pizza, I had never had the restaurant version before last night.  I had a cheese pizza, a sausage, onion black olive pizza, and an order of cheese sticks.
   I found the waitstaff to be competent, but not much better than that. Requests were always fulfilled, but sometimes a bit slow. Nothing unbareable. 
   The mozzerella sticks were pretty good. Nothing out of the ordinary. I have to say, I feel the same about the pizza. It was a decent pizza with apparently fresh ingredients, but lacked character. There wasn&#39;t anything special. It&#39;s a step above a pizza hut, of course. 
  Especially since it isn&#39;t close to home for me, I doubt I&#39;ll be going back. If it were around the corner, it may be a place I&#39;d visit once in awhile."

Their meat lovers is DA BOMB like DONKEY KONG!!! Pepperoni, sausage, and bacon!!! AWHHHHH YEAHHH!!!!! 

The service is whatever, I simply love their pizza. The cheese is cooked until nicely browned, the sausage has plenty of fennel, the pepperoni is nicely cured, and the bacon...well...it&#39;s bacon. Their crust gets perfectly crisp and is just the right 

I believe, they make the best frozen pizza around. It tastes almost identical to a pizza from their restaurant.

Some how another topping made it to the pizza...diced tomato. Woah! Watch out...I didn&#39;t order that and their menu clearly states Sausage, Mushrooms, Green Peppers and Onion only!

This is another place I&#39;ve really enjoyed eating at over the years (this is a newer location but just as good as it&#39;s Darien counterpart). They do a very good job on a consistent basis. I&#39;ve never experienced a bad pizza from Home Run Inn. The staff are always very polite. 

As for the pizza, while the pan is very good, I prefer their thin crust. The sauce and cheese works better for my tastes with the thin crust. I love the spices in the sauce that gives it a very nice flavor. I like the Nick&#39;s Super 
(sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, &amp; onions) when I want to step out. Generally, I&#39;ll stick to sausage &amp; mushrooms (I may add some garlic when I get it home). Appetizers are very good but unless you&#39;re in a big group (or have a big appetite, or know you want to bring something home), you may want to pass on them. If you do, any of them will be very good- Mozzarella sticks, BBQ Wings, potato skins, or toasted ravioli. 

Now if time permits you, try the buffet (Bolingbrook is only on Friday, Darien is Monday- Friday). They rotate the pasta dishes so this will give you a nice opportunity to try some of their pastas. My experiences is that the buffet has been fresh and kept fresh during the lunch (especially during peak times). I&#39;m partial to the lasagna. The Italian meatball grinder is another solid pick. Another spot where I haven&#39;t experienced a bad meal. Take a friend or make a visit. You cant also get their pizza frozen at your local store. Good but not as good as fresh made."

Very inviting setup, with some half indoor/ half outdoor seating. The bar is one huge wraparound bar with lots of seating and side tables.
Bartender was very friendly. We ordered fried pickles that were very good and the burgers bs pulled prom sliders. I did not care for the meat of the sliders but everything else was good."

PROS: Lots of screens without the too loud noise, which would normally go with that. Our server was friendly and good. Drink selection was decent. Food was better than I expected.

CONS: Very slim on vegetarian options. Only one cider option (which was in a can).

OVERALL: Everything about this place was fine or OK or nice. I&#39;ve been to better bars and pubs, but have been to more that were not as good."

We finally made our way over there last Saturday and were very happy with our visit.

First off, this place is huge. I&#39;m happy to see they&#39;ve taken full advantage of the space with a large bar, plenty of tables, and tons of TVs. I&#39;ve been to this location when it was another bar and a Mexican restaurant. Really hoping Draft Picks sticks around despite the venue&#39;s history!

They offer an extensive beer list, full bar, and enticing bar food menu. To start we had the pretzel bites with cheddar cheese sauce ($7.95). Pretty good, but a little too much salt for my liking.

I ordered the Draft Picks Burger ($11.95) which includes a 10 oz burger, avocado, chihuahua cheese, lettuce, tomato &amp; chipotle mayo on a brioche bun. It comes with your choice of side -- fries or cole slaw, and a pickle. Or you can substitute seasoned waffle fries, tater tots or onion rings (add $1). Or go the healthiest route and add a side salad for $2. I went with the waffle fries (with a side of ranch for dipping) which were very good. Guess I&#39;ll be healthier next time around?

My burger sounded and looked a lot more amazing than it actually was to be honest. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it was good, but nothing extraordinary. Hubbie had the turkey burger (lettuce, tomato &amp; chipotle mayo) and added an egg on top. He chose onion rings for his side. No complaints there.

Our waitress was nice and checked in on us pretty often. Our bill was a little more than we expected, but we did upgrade our sides and add to our burgers so that&#39;s probably why. 

We will definitely be back to catch a game, or more importantly a UFC fight since my husband is a huge fan."

My husband and I live very close by and have been waiting for the &#34;Opening Soon&#34; sign to change to &#34;Now Open.&#34;  We stopped by for a late lunch on a Sunday during a Bears game and split the nachos and some very large beers.  The nachos were FANTASTIC - they do them with chili, which is my favorite.  The waitress was very good about answering our questions and got us beer samples when they were requested.  There&#39;s a ton of stuff on the menu that I want to try, so we&#39;ll definitely be back.  It seemed like they had a ton of different specials depending on the day of the week, so that will probably guide future menu decision making.  

The main room was busy and loud.  As I had mentioned, the Bears game was on and they were doing some sort of Bears Bingo, which sounded like fun.  As a Steelers fan, we opted for the side room which was much quieter.  They had TVs all around the room with a ton of different games on.  You could just sit facing the game you wanted and enjoy!  

I am pleased that this place turned into such a nice bar.  It looks kind of shady on the outside because they really didn&#39;t do a very good job with the remodel.  It&#39;s still got the tacky Tex Mex thing going on from when it was Rancheros, but seriously give it a shot!  It&#39;s a great place to watch a sports game, or grab a reasonably priced but delicious bite to eat."

This place offers a food menu consisting of burgers, pizza, chicken sandwiches, etc. Ya know, the usual. The prices are fair, but the specials are even better and specials they have like every night.  On different occasions I&#39;ve tried a burger, the pulled pork and burger sliders, a buffalo chicken sandwich and the rib dinner. I did mention these were all on different occasions, right? Yikes, I sound like quite an eater.  Anywho, the sliders were amazing and the buffalo chicken sandwich was yummy.  The burger and the ribs were both overcooked.  So, they could use a bit more consistency in the kitchen.  

On to the drinks...they have a pretty decent craft beer menu and cheap domestics are almost always on a deal. They also have a full bar with wine and booze.  Prices are reasonable.

They also have a thousand tvs showing all the regular sports and we&#39;ve accidentally stopped in on fight nights too.  If you like sports, this is a good place to go."

But like most sports bars the food is only decent. I had the gyro platter and there was lot&#39;s of meat but it was really dry. My son had a Philly cheese steak and said it was just ok, and we both agreed that the fries weren&#39;t good.

The cook brought it out and said here I hope it&#39;s ok. Again well done. 2 burgers and 3 beers ended up costing $62 before tip.

I have been somewhat of a regular on Thursdays because in this area there really is not a better burger when coupled w the beers they have. 
Thursday is half price burgers, so I stop right after work (2pm).
Out of about 10 recent Thursdays, 5 of those times the fries were absolutely cold/left over from lunch? 
I wouldn&#39;t even eat all of the fries! But when I go to grab one and it feels like its 3 hours cold its the principle of it...
I told my bartender and she gave me a free beer (which was nice) but in my mind, when this happens, with that much frequency,  I am starting to wonder whether if  this is the management telling the cooks to cut corners? If this place is cutting corners there, then where else are they cutting corners? 
I think they just lost my business."

Believe it or not a coupon clipper as got it on out Friday Date night radar. First thing that struck me coming out of the bitter cold wax the warmth perfect for a night like tonight. Beer (not my thing but very much my college age kids) is varied and numerous. Menu straight forward with many choices. I had the Firecracker Chicken sandwich- buffalo chicken blue cheese and another cheese. Normally when you order this its soaked in blue cheese sauce you need a knife and fork to eat it. Not here. Perfect to eat with your hands. Wine list is a little limited- I know Sports themed bar/pub- but I&#39;m really nitpicking. Wife had the gyro sandwich and gave it an 8. Daughter had the steak wrap- a 6. Best review is we will definitely return

About half of it is a bar and the other half is a dining area.  We ate there for lunch on Sunday since we saw the sign outside stating half off chicken sandwiches and sliders.  It turns out they have specials every day of the week.  Although it&#39;s only because their prices are a lot higher for the area.  Average $11 for sandwich or burger with fries.  Those are prices in downtown Chicago but not Naperville area.  I would&#39;ve given this place 4 stars but I personally don&#39;t like this sales tactic to charge higher prices only to advertise discounts.  The waitress was very nice and the food we ordered was very good.  We ordered the chicken pita sandwich, chicken avocado sandwich and a bunch of sliders.

There were more macaroni shells than there was lettuce or veggies. Plus it&#39;s called chopped salad, at least chop up the macaroni pasta. Also the bacon bits was clumped up together and frozen. It was not good. Not sure if I will give this another chance. If I do, I might have to try something else like the pizza or something."

Food was pretty good; I enjoyed the Buffalo Chicken Wrap which was super spicy and the Saganaki, I mean who can pass up flaming cheese?  The only item I wasn&#39;t a big fan of was the pretzel appetizers, I think they are frozen and then just reheated, I would skip them.  While I was there I saw the nachos which look massive and I can&#39;t wait to try them next.

The service is 50/50... sometimes you hit the jackpot and sometimes you are going to be annoyed.  I live close by so I hope they can improve those margins to at least 75/25 because I would love to see a restaurant that actually lasts in this location."

It is an excellent neighborhood sports bar: tons of space and seating, cool rustic look with lots of Chicago sports nods, and a surprisingly large and thorough beer list.  Plus, of course, about a million TVs including one 6-screen monster. Check out their specials list. They run one or two great deals like half price burgers or $10 fish fry each night, and apps are 1/2 off after 9pm everyday. I had the shrimp fish fry one Friday night and hubby ordered the perch and they were both awesome- these people know their way around the fryer! Hot wings are perfect and burgers are really yummy, though a little oversized in my opinion. Can&#39;t wait to try their fried pickles so we are going back soon for that!"

There are  3 working the back room and despite my husband waving and calling out to the waiter we still sat unattended to.  You  would need  a flare gun to get someone&#39;s attention at this rate. After giving up on the  table we went to the bar to find out the beer menu is wrong and they actually don&#39;t have coffe bender or other craft beers as advertised. Long story short,  I&#39;d love to tell you how the food was but I never got to try it.  Worst service I&#39;ve seen in a really long time.  Won&#39;t be back."

The hand-made cavatelli are more like gnudi but were delicious, chewy, savory and very satisfying.  The appetizer size is smallish and really just a tease but I still loved it!

The corn chowder is first-rate - sweet and hearty.  We asked for a side of fries - theirs are hand-cut and fried in beef tallow - and they were able to accommodate.  WOW .. these were some of the BEST fries ever!  Really, REALLY!  Plus, the housemade ketchup was super good too.  Dilemma - to dip or not to dip?  Oh such sweet misery!

The fish entree, trout, was delicious in an unexpected way.  This is no ordinary trout.  It&#39;s an ocean trout which is a much larger fish than freshwater trout and looks and tastes more like a mild salmon or an arctic char.  Theirs is superbly prepared, crusty skin and quivering flesh ... it doesn&#39;t get much better than that.  The accompanying ginger fried rice was super tasty too - a bit on the salty side but that&#39;s a small issue.

The shrimp and grits was a bit disappointing.  The shrimp were too small and too few, and the grits were too sweet for my taste.

We had the coffee granita dessert - very light and refreshing, like a frozen coffee.  Very nice.

They have some nice craft cocktails and wines by the glass.

Highly recommended!"

Reading the reviews I can see that their amazing biscuits, eggs and chicken are all well-documented, and for good reason--they are all thoughtfully done with outstanding ingredients and great service. 

We recently started going to their Friday and Saturday night dinners and we have developed a whole new level of love for this restaurant. Their dinner menu is constantly changing which has given us the chance to try some delicious, creative meals. Last night my husband had a sushi-grade rainbow trout with ginger-leek fried rice that was extremely fresh, light but full of flavor. I had their shrimp and grits. I am not usually a big fan of grits but the texture of these were perfect and the sight sweetness was excellent along with the shrimp and andouille sausage. We&#39;ve also had the homemade pastas, steak (devoured by our five year old) and flatbread (Brie, fig and prosciutto--yum). 

It&#39;s no secret that Solstice is outstanding for breakfast and lunch, but it is a rare gem in the suburbs for dinner. The high caliber of cooking, the quality of the ingredients and the fantastic service (all at a seriously reasonable price) is something we usually have to go into the city to find.

I had the breakfast burrito, and my husband had the breakfast sandwich.  Don&#39;t go here looking for IHop or Denny&#39;s portions,  or even any other breakfast spots that you truly do love.  

We were taken aback when the plates arrived.  Did not look like much.  And then we ate.

Such great flavor.  Don&#39;t even get me started on the Solstice potatoes.  FINALLY someone gets that potatoes need to be crispy-crunchy morsels of goodness, finished with a bit of salt. 

Potato perfection.

My breakfast burrito was so good.  Loved the jalapeno kick.  And the eggs are AMAZING.  Truth be told?  I could have used a bit of awesome salsa on the side.  And my husband said he would have loved a drizzle of Two Pigs Farm pure maple syrup on his sammy. 

Just a bit of constructive criticism, yet regardless.....

Can&#39;t wait to go back and try so many other yummy sounding things.

solstice-western-springs,Samantha H.,dgiVMQrLMxYubREFUU6QQg,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,155,3,oSHxs0hrs0uLoZWwgD16_g,5.0,2016-06-09,"My search for a good brunch spot in the burbs unfortunately has left me stumped.  A spot with a good bloody, portions not large enough to feed a small country and quality ingredients have been scarce.  Enter Solstice.  I had been around there several times but never even noticed it; my bad.  It&#39;s a small spot but cozy.  It has an industrial feel to it inside.  They also have outside seating.  But why do that when you can sit at the bar?  The bar is only a few stools but is very inviting.  They have some awesome coffee (I&#39;m not a coffee drinker) and these donuts that I guess are famous.  Again, didn&#39;t get around to trying those yet but these are two reasons I can see a lot of food traffic here.  Lucas, one of the owners, was behind the bar and extremely attentive and friendly.  He gave me the background of Solstice and his brother, the chef, also is extremely nice.  I don&#39;t even know these guys and they treated me as though I had been a loyal patron for years (which works out, considering I plan to be).  As much as the atmosphere of a place is what separates the 3 stars from the 5 stars, what keeps me going back to somewhere is the food...so onto that!

So I start with a bloody mary, cause, why not?  This is le-git.  They do everything in house here (cure their own bacon, make their own sausage, etc.) and the jalepeno and cilantro infused vodka is no different.  I was lucky enough to get a taste of it on its own because I wanted to see if it was just their delicious mix that made this so tasty but the vodka itself was nice and spicy.  If you don&#39;t like spice, I&#39;m sure they can figure something out but then you probably wouldn&#39;t be getting a bloody anyway!  This was savory and spicy and had a level of acidity from the house made pickles that garnished it.  It was truly one of the best bloodies I&#39;ve ever had.  I&#39;m not sure if there is anything I could suggest to improve upon that.  It also comes with their outstanding bacon as a garnish as well.  Nom nom.  I also tried the mimosa, which is a good alternative if bloodies are not your thing.  There was some pulp in there which you would expect since they&#39;re not exactly  using Tropicana.  I look forward to trying more!  So I asked Lucas what he liked and he recommended the chicken biscuit.  Awesome, that&#39;s what I was eying anyway but I always like to ask because sometimes people will be honest and say it&#39;s not their favorite or guide you toward something else.  I mentioned I was between that and the biscuits and gravy.  So I get the chicken.  It&#39;s boneless chicken that they must marinate for a while because it was super moist.  The skin was a good crispy.  But what made this was the biscuit.  Oh the biscuit!  It literally was the best biscuit I&#39;ve ever had.  It must have won some accolades or something, right?  Actually, yes (https://makeitbetter.net/dining/10-best-biscuits-chicago/).  But I digress.  They also pour honey on it cause honey makes everything better (sorta like bacon).  Now, you can&#39;t eat this as a sandwich but who cares?  The potatoes were just potatoes to me but I didn&#39;t really care cause I was just nomming this chicken biscuit.  I liked the grilled onions on the potatoes but probably would like some more throughout or some dill or something.  My benchmark for potatoes is Bongo Room and that&#39;s a high bar to compare against.  Oh and how can I forget, there is a fried egg on top.  Everyone is throwing an egg on top of everything nowadays but here is really belongs cause it soaks into the biscuit and coats the chicken.  The portion was a bit large for me but my guess is most of the rest of their patrons would disagree.  I was fortunate enough to also get to try a sample of the biscuits and gravy.  Are...you...kidding...me?  Hands down the best sausage gravy I&#39;ve ever had.  It starts again with their own housemade sausage.  There are decent sized chunks throughout.  The texture is absolutely perfect.  I feel it&#39;s quite easy to have too thick (which also tastes like flour) or too thin gravy but this was just right.  I will definitely be a regular here and can&#39;t wait until they start their dinner service on the weekends!"

I am actually &#34;gob smacked&#34; a phrase from my home town Liverpool UK which means astounded, that some reviews mention dry food, it must have been an off day.

We have eaten here so many times because the chicken is always moist and the waffles with vanilla are to die for, the sprouts on the biscuits and gravy is genius, it shouldn&#39;t work but it does, and boy does it.

Regular coffee is great.  Locally sourced 

Not had a bad meal there, only ever disappointment was not getting in on Father&#39;s Day !

Impressed by the atmosphere. Coffee was great. Brunch on Saturday morning... Not overly crowded. Hubby ordered chicken and waffles, I ordered the Benedict with ribeye. We both agree that the flavors were excellent, but my husband&#39;s chicken was very dry and my eggs on the Benedict were cooked through when they should run out. The hollandaise was amazing so that made up for the overcooked eggs. 
We brought this to our waiter&#39;s attention and he said he would tell the chef and then came back with a donut, which was nice. We would like to come back and hope the food is cooked better next time."

Food choices are great, kids menu best around (steak and glazed carrots?! Our 4 year old gobbled it up). I&#39;m happy to finally see buttermilk fried chicken on a menu again. Two minor issues this last visit. Above mentioned steak was too raw and had to be sent back and then came out after everyone else was done eating. Part of a three piece dessert came out late, and although hot on the outside it was still frozen on inside. Hopefully these kinks will be worked out.

I really like locally sourced restaurants and I guess I was expecting to have my socks knocked off, but it was just okay. Yes, the portions were small, but likely what they should be. My husband and I both had the veggie omelet for $10. It was probably 2 eggs worth and was tough/dry, but the goat cheese was good. The kids portions were also miniscule, I had to give them my dry toast (no butter on the table and we never got the apple butter we asked for).  Coffee was good, donuts were fresh off the truck, service was friendly.  It was good to see a place like this busy. 

With the price for the portion, it should be stellar! We will probably try it again, but get something different."

We were greeted promptly and asked if we wanted to sit inside or out.  Outside was our choice as today was a gorgeous Sunday.  The person behind the bar set aside some silverware and said to follow another girl. This girl grabbed some menus by the front and another couple followed instead.  An innocent mistake or arrogant couple, I can&#39;t be sure.  But it was solstice that dropped the ball by not acknowledging what happened.  We were left just standing outside and ignored by staff (though it looked like a bus boy observed what occurred).

Not overly large or slathered in unnecessary cheese and served with a side of tomatillo salsa. Potatoes were really good but still a little less salt for my taste would be perfect- but they do use kosher salt which is nice.

It&#39;s a good breakfast and a nice place to go but I suppose I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way for it. I do have one complaint. Order the chicken and waffles to go and the chicken was literally burnt to a crisp on one side. Also they serve the food to go in cardboard box so all the juicy goodness is lost by the time you get home."

I have been here twice now (first for breakfast, then lunch) and I have not been disappointed.  Just about everything on the menu comes from local farms and businesses.  They make everything in house, from the bacon and sausages to the ketchup, mustard and pickles.

On my first visit, I stopped in for brunch.  The coffee is the sort that makes one remember a place.  I had the benedict (which I understand changes weekly).  It had shrimp and house-made andouille sausage.  It might have been the best benny I have ever had.  My wife had the pancakes, which were fluffy and delicious, served with the most amazing maple syrup from Driftless Breeze Farm in Wisconsin.  For our little guy, we ordered the muesli which was very good (perfect for a two year old).  Mallory was our server and she was very attentive and knowledgeable.

A few weeks after that, I found myself in the area with time enough for lunch.  I had the pulled pork sandwich, topped with a Carolina-style mustard BBQ sauce and wonderfully crisp and fresh cole slaw.  It was truly one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I have ever had.  The chips that came with were outstanding (again, made in house).  Claire was my server and she was as cheerful as she was helpful.

They recently added a full bar, which never hurts.  They feature some vodka and rye from Quincy Street Distillery, which is right up the tracks in Riverside.  I tried both while on a tour of said distillery and can confirm that they are very worth a taste at the least.  They also had Belt and Suspenders IPA from Buckledown Brewing in Lyons, keeping with the local theme.  It is also very tasty.  I have sampled it previously at the brewery as well as with my lunch that day and it was a lovey accompaniment to the BBQ.  

The food and drinks were wonderful.  The service was above average, to say the least.  The place is comfortable and appealing.  There is nothing to not like about this place.  Five stars and big thumbs up!"

-Well thought out food from local suppliers.
-Everything is home made including the ketchup.
-They do not serve the run of mill dishes or offer too many options(because it all fresh)
-menu regularly changes.
-Colombe Coffee served which is my favorite coffee from East Coast.

Once the food came, all doubts were removed.  It is rare to find a place that does two eggs with bacon and potatoes differently.  This place is a rarity.  With the hand cut bacon, farm fresh eggs and wheat toast with homemade jam it is on another level.  Throw in the Solstice Potatoes made with caramelized onions and you have the paragon of breakfast.

The only reason I can&#39;t give it five stars is I have not tried the lunch...yet."

Awesome bacon, biscuit was flatbread-like (not overly dough-y but perfect biscuit consistency), cheese was flavorful and the egg was scrambled perfectly.  Side potatoes a guiltless portion and very good.  The coffee was excellent - full-bodied and warm-ups kept coming.

Unfortunately, the service was really bad.  Our waiter was slow, forgot a lot of things, and was very disorganized.  The problem is she seemed to be the person in charge - maybe even the owner?  My impression is that she wants everything to be perfect so she tries to control everything.  The result is not very good.  Whoever is in charge needs to get good people to play their role and recognize their own strengths and weaknesses.

On the upside, the food was good but a little cold.  Similar to other reviews there were some issues of food overdone.  This place has potential if they get things together but I can&#39;t recommend it at this point."

We told the server that we had tried to come a few times, but it didn&#39;t work for one reason or another.

The brioche was medium pan toasted, with the interior just moist with a good egg saturation, and served with a warm maple syrup on the side.  Eggs were over-easy, as ordered, with fresh and plump yolks. The homemade sausage was delicious, well-spiced. For the price you might pay at a diner, you can get farm-to-table dishes in a quiet little gem of a restaurant hidden away in Western Springs.

We were never offered a second cup of coffee, or anything else for that matter after our food arrived, although the place was pretty empty.  The breakfast entrees were very small and rather blah.  Brioche French toast was 2 tiny pieces of brioche &#34;Wonder Bread&#34; and 2 tiny limp pieces of bacon.  That&#39;s it for what was on the teeny tiny plate.  No jelly was available in the restaurant.  My friend was given apple butter for her toast when she asked for jelly.  You have to ASK (aka flag-down-someone) for this apple butter/jelly, butter, salt, pepper, or cream for coffee.  The eggs were just not good and I ask you...&#34;how do you mess up eggs?&#34;

Both really nice guys who are bringing something new to the usual breakfast (haven&#39;t tried lunch yet), restaurant scene. Sure there are times we all like the mass produced, gigantic portions of food that we have become accustomed to in America. However, for a high quality, unique breakfast experience where the food is created by an actual chef, I would definitely recommend Solstice. I had grits that were to die for and unwillingly had to share them with my husband. The home made biscuits and jam were absolutely delicious! The portion sizes are exactly what we should be eating, instead of out of a trough like at many other breakfast spots. I feel the prices are spot on for quality, fresh food. We will definitely be going back in the near future."

Fresh pickles and mustard really topped off that sandwich. I had the grilled cheese which was filled with 4 types of wonderful cheeses. The fries are cooked fresh and have  the perfect texture. Get the chicken noodle soup. The broth is out of this world and you get your money&#39;s worth. All in all a beautiful little restaurant with a great atmosphere.

Excited to at least give it a shot we turned off our phones drew a few deep breaths and went in.   

Our experience.....
- my coffee and my wife&#39;s latte were both excellent
- my wife asked for cheese on her scrambled eggs and they were prepared &#34;just the way she likes them&#34;...
- my experience was similar with the sausage patties.  Quite satisfied
- the price was reasonable

I chose to create my first post on yelp because we feel that together we were able to overcome our fear of trying new semi popular dining experiences.  No need to consider us Heroes we cherish the opportunity to live on the edge.   In the end we were quite satisfied and will go back..."

Nice interior - even though the space is quite small, it&#39;s designed well. All of our food was great - not too long a wait, hot, fresh, and well-prepared. 

I think they&#39;ll do very well in Western Springs with one caveat: I really think a breakfast/lunch place in this village *must* have a kids&#39; menu. There were several children present during the lunch hour and it&#39;s always a hassle to order for a child from an adult menu. They could easily add 2-3 simpler, smaller, and lower-priced variations of foods on their current menu - similar to what Prasino does. 

That said, I&#39;m excited for this place and will likely be a regular.

Edited, 8/20/15:
They added a great kids menu. This place is especially good for breakfast - gosh, the homemade English muffin was good. Coffee is great. I&#39;m very nearly ready to bump it up to five stars."

I ordered scrambled eggs that looked and tasted like a lump of something yellow with little pieces of burned, salty potatoes on the side and what was supposed to be bacon...maybe turkey bacon or colored cardboard.  Anyway, the place is just pretentious.  The prices are high to begin with, but then they charge extra for a biscuit vs toast and serve tap water, no ice, in a capped bottle,...come on now.  And what&#39;s with the elderly fellow in the dirty apron and hat who comes around asking if he can get you anything?  The whole set up seems destined for a quick demise."

I can forgive poor service when a place is busy but I can excuse poor food techniques. I know they are relatively new but they need to figure out how to run a service on a Sunday.  The service was slow due to the fact the outdoor was open and they were undermanned.  They kept clearing plates and utensils when they were still being used.  Ask before taking is a general rule. Whereas the food conception was alright, the technique was lacking.   The Brioche French Toast was dry. There was barely enough egg wash to get a crust on the outside but all you tasted was the grille top history and not the custard from the soak.  It was flat, bland and dense while tasting fried.  I would expect some tooth to the bite but it was as if it was just stale bread. The eggs showed flat as well as if they were cracked in a pan and left to rubberize.   The pork sausage was mealy.  The tables were messy and they didn&#39;t clean the pool of water up off the floor.  We begged to have more coffee and cream always.  The Doughnuts from Stan&#39;s was the best thing.  That doesn&#39;t say much for the kitchen.  The classic Chicago Greek Diners do better job. I want places like this to be successful, but when you compound poor food with poor service and lack of managerial direction, I say there is little chance for a future.  That is a shame. 

For the price, I felt short changed.  We have been telling our friends and neighbors not to go."

I understand this a new place and sometimes takes a while to get settled. The food was not good and cold like the front entrance that should be covered. I would give a place another shot if that was it. Maybe my food would have tasted better if the busboy wasn&#39;t spraying the table closely next to me with cleaning solution. They are unfriendly which doesn&#39;t make sense to me. A smile with friendly service and semi-decent food would do well and sadly I think Solstice doesn&#39;t get it.

I like that each time I went in the menu had a few new things. The food has been fresh and very well cooked each time. My favorites have been the steak and eggs, pancakes, potatoes and waffles for breakfast . For lunch the soups and burger have been great. My husband has dined with me a few times and he tried their waffles, pancakes, bacon, sausage &amp; eggs benedict and burgers. He has enjoyed them each time. I really like that everything is local and in season. Our server gave us a nice run down on the menu items and how they make from scratch and even the sausage and bacon is made in house. My husband did make a point of raving about the sausage Benedict . He said the sausage looked different than most breakfast sausage and tasted even better. I am guessing it is because it is homemade.

The Honey Habanero wings are the best wings around! Sweet start with a killer hot finish. And I mean HOT. Any wing that brings a tear to my eye and makes my nose run uncontrollably but I can&#39;t stop eating them makes my top 5 list of best wings ever. Also had the Sticky Teriyaki wings and they were incredible. This place knows how to do wings! I must bite the wings bullet and try a burger next time I am here.

Their beer list is extensive and very high quality. And Jason &amp; the other bartenders will keep your glass filled and the food coming. I highly, highly recommend this place."

Ordered duck nachos to start. They came out pretty fast. Lukewarm and a bit too saucy for my taste. Cut back on the sauce and they&#39;re good. They need to be hot.
  My beer was great-chocolate porter. It was really good.
My husband got the pork belly hamburger. Sorry but I don&#39;t remember what was on it.  This was more roasted pork on a hamburger patty. Meh.
 I got the special - a sandwich  with  pork on it with alot of sloppy toppings and a flavorless bun. Ugh. I also had garlic mashed potatoes. They were ok. My husband got the garlic butter fries. Came out cold. Seriously? How hard is it to serve hot fries? Plus, this was not butter...it was oil + a big plop of chopped garlic on top. The waiter brought out fresh, hot fries. Another greasy pile. 
All in all, nachos would be really good IF they came out hot. Beer was really good. Sandwiches were a miss as were the sides. Over 50 bucks. Just not feeling this place. We both took Pepto that night and the next morning."

They have a bar, tables, and booths in the front area and there is an additional large room in the back with a pool table and a couple video games.  They also have additional seating in a patio area.  There are some pretty cool murals on the walls in the back.  We ordered bacon wrapped mozzarella for an appetizer. The bacon was overcooked and burnt on one of them.  We paid $9 for 3 small pieces.  I was not impressed and would not order it again.  The burger was cooked perfect but nothing about the burger really stood out to me especially for the price.

Tried this place with my two uncles- that&#39;s a tough crowd. My uncle legit stated &#34;this may be the best burger I&#39;ve ever had&#34;. We all tried an array of burgers and no one was disappointed. I had the &#34;you&#39;re the one for me,fatty&#34;. Freshly ground beef topped with shredded pork and avocado. Oh my! It was delicious.

My uncle tried the Mac and cheese and it was not very good. Watery and not creamy at all. Stick with the burgers.

The beer selection is fabulous! I wish I could&#39;ve tried an adult milkshake but that would&#39;ve made me burst after that burger. 

I would suggest offering a smaller burger? It may seem crazy in this gluttonous age, but I hate wasting food. Especially delicious food!"

I really enjoyed the &#34;Day of the Lords&#34; burger and their garlic fries! I can&#39;t remember which cocktails that I ordered off of their menu, but they were both delicious. The service was just as good as the food..my one complaint is the lack of domestic beer. I totally understand the concept of going local, but sometimes I just want a Coors instead of a craft brew.

Very nicely done, with some interesting murals on the walls. Our waitress was fantastic. She was funny and engaging. She was prompt once we were seated and took our orders right away and kept us updated... while waiting for our food.

That was the first problem. It took a bit over twenty minutes from the time we ordered for our food to arrive. Burgers and fries aren&#39;t that complicated. 

Once the food arrived, on first inspection, it looked great. It just didn&#39;t taste as good as it looked. After taking our order, our waitress asked if cooking to medium was ok. I told her that medium-rare would be ideal. My wife&#39;s burger was medium-rare, mine was a bit closer to medium-well. 

There was nothing that stood out about the taste of the burgers. My wife got &#34;Phony Tough, Crazy Brave&#34; and I got the &#34;You&#39;re The One For Me, Fatty!&#34;. We also got side orders of the garlic fries and the truffle fries. Later, I tried one of the adult shakes (&#34;Ebony and Ivory&#34;, I think?). The truffle fries tasted bland in comparison to the garlic fries and our waitress admitted that the kitchen isn&#39;t always consistent, yet. Both fries were a bit on the greasy side. The shake was decent, especially since there&#39;s nothing like it around.

I had high hopes for this place, but I was disappointed. It&#39;s not bad, just not great. Certainly not worth the money when there are chain burger joints in the area (e.g. Meatheads, Smashburger, Five Guys) that have great burgers that are cheaper. The place is new and I would imagine is still learning, but it&#39;s going to be hard to justify going back for those prices ($50 for two burgers, two fries, and one adult shake) unless it improves a notch or two."

The staff was courteous and attentive and the menu is well laid out. Now, on to the food. 
The food choices are unique and delicious. Wide variety of burger options, great sides (Chipotle Mashed Potatoes), and huge craft beer selection. This place goes beyond the typical Gourmet Burger joint to include unique Nacho plate options, gourmet Mac &amp; Cheese varieties, pickled veggies, and great looking salads.

The food part wasn&#39;t great. Menu states all burgers are cooked medium but mine came out totally cooked through, no touch of pink at all. I paid an upcharge for the salt and vinegar fries which came out barely warm with no salt on them. Bunch of little pieces too. My wife got a small salad and the garlic butter fries. Same temp on her fries.

We sat at the bar and began perusing the menu to decide which of their wide variety of cocktails we would order for our first round. We typically have a couple cocktails before dinner, and either wine or beer with our meal.  Our female server was obviously miffed with the length of time we were taking to decide on our selections. She kept snarkily asking and pressuring whether we were ready to order yet. Although working from behind the bar, she advised that she was only a server and not a bartender, and had no knowledge about the drink or food menu offerings. She seemed annoyed with our questions and could not answer any of them, about either the food or the cocktails - like for instance,  what vodka is used since there is no liquor on display behind the bar.  However, she was in a big BIG hurry to take our orders. The menu is limited but complicated; same for the cocktails. Prices are lofty and the drinks are tiny. We were all thirsty and out for a fun time together; we wanted to make the right choices but quickly lost our appetites and enthusiasm.

We might have decided on our selections sooner had we not been distracted by the 2 actual bartenders, both male, busily mixing up a variety of concoctions right in front of us behind the bar - it seemed they were either learning or training or experimenting or something. They would concoct different series of drinks then distribute their full-size samples to everyone around us, but us, obviously completely, deliberately and intentionally ignoring our group. Each round of their creations were given as freebies to either a couple sitting right next to us at the bar and/or to another group of 4 at the lead table in the window, bar side. So as we sat deliberating, constantly pressured for an order by our female server, the 2 male bartenders kept passing out numerous full-drink samples to their apparent &#39;favorite&#39; customers of the night while we 4 hopefuls sat gawking and drooling for at least even a small taste test sample ourselves, but not one ever came our way, and several rounds were distributed. The couple next to us, upon realizing we were not included in the drinks giveaway, even said they had no idea why they were the lucky recipients of all the freebies, then awkwardly and graciously asked us if we wanted tastes of all of the sample drinks they had lined up in front of them. (Of course, we declined - who wants to share drinks with someone else, esp strangers!?!) They said they had never been there before and had no idea why they were being so favored.

The noise level was extreme making convo impossible  unless the person was sitting right next to you. Even the server had a hard time hearing us from behind the bar, and she had to repeat everything she said to us.  

We are still not sure how we ended up with &#39;just a server&#39; as she put it, when we intentionally sat at the bar for cocktails!  Although we came so close to just walking out, we were all too thirsty and hungry so finally just ordered some beers and variety of burgers and fries, and mac n cheese - that being just about everything on the menu which, by the way, is overly complicated and loaded with ridiculous attempts at cleverness. 

Our wait for the food was too long - at least 30 minutes. Not one of us was impressed with any of the food which was all very basic and unimpressive. The menu is loaded with fussy details and gimicky titles to sift and ponder, but the food is standard at best. 


After such a long- awaited and highly anticipated opening, this place is a major disappointment on every level. Food and srinks are pricey and portions are small. The mediocre food and long wait-time for it was exacerbated by the sense of rejection that we all felt when excluded from the private Happy Hour Party that the two self-absorbed bartenders conducted right in front of us, along with the repeated disrespect, ignorance and pressure which the server displayed from behind the bar. 

Bad food is a disappointment but not a social injury, but being ignored, feeling unwelcomed and unimportant is. 

They did, however, get their name right: a crusade is a long and determined attempt to achieve something. They have a long  LONG way to go, and WE WILL NOT BE GOING BACK."

When they first opened the beef actually shown through in their burgers, so this is at odds with when they first opened.  Was it simply the cook being way too far, or was there a change in supplier, for the beef...combination of the two.  I don&#39;t know...perhaps If I was going to go back I&#39;d find out.

   On to the apps.  We got the mozzarella curds wrapped in bacon, three of them for 9 bucks.  Now, the idea was nice, with some greens and acidity on the plate. But if you&#39;re going to give me such a small amount, make it good...I would actually prefer it this way.  But this was, at best, deli sliced bacon and the equivalent cheese to one cheese stick cut into thirds.  A place like this could easily be making their own bacon, and make mozzarella cheese themselves too...but this was certainly not that.  This wasn&#39;t a fraction of that.

  Beer selection was really good, as usual."
crusade-burger-bar-yorkville,Brad B.,BGQqC8nQHdULGE01nPcYGA,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1,3,49,FiIH-LV9H5zZL8xoh--05Q,4.0,2016-07-12,"This is a pretty solid burger bar, though not quite perfect. 
We stopped here for a late lunch on a Saturday.  We entered and were greeted promptly by the hostess.  We asked for two seats with a high chair, and were told it would be a wait for a booth. When I asked if we could just do a two-top table, the hostess stated we couldn&#39;t because the aisle needed to remain clear. Shortly after, we were seated at a normal table with the high chair. The particular high chair we were given did not have the proper latch for the buckles, but I made do with it. Luckily my child was well behaved. 
Our menus were presented on a clipboard which had a logical order; drink menu in front and then the food menu behind. The menu is simple and straightforward, mostly burgers (chicken can be substituted) and a few other options. There are numerous local (Chicago area) beers served here, which is a huge plus for me.  Neither of us had one, but will probably return to try some of their selections.  
One thing to note here: clipped to the front of the menus was a letter from the management addressing a few things.  They explained the business was new, and to be patient with the wait staff, the bartenders, and the kitchen, as they were learning the menu items and such.  I felt this was insulting, in that most of the patrons here are probably aware the business is new, and also probably know there are usually growing pains with that (at least I do). It&#39;s not the first new bar/restaurant to ever open here. Either way, a printed letter making excuses for bad service ahead of time is creating low expectations of the product and, in my opinion, just poor management and customer service. If the staff is not properly trained or the product isn&#39;t ready, the business should not be open yet. That being said, I would say our server&#39;s lack of attention and general poor attitude were the result of her not wanting to wait on our table rather than her lack of product knowledge.  I observed her aimlessly walking around on the opposite end of the floor quite frequently, almost avoiding and only occasionally checking on her section where we were seated. We were not the only table with this issue. The table next to us waited for their bill the entire time it took us to get our food after ordering. 
However, a nice thing included in this letter was an explanation of their menu, in particular their beer selection.  None of the traditional domestic products are offered (Miller, Bud, etc.). Only locally manufactured brews are represented. 
The food itself was excellent. We each ordered burgers, and they came standard with a side of what seemed like fresh-cut fries.  For the little one, we ordered Mac and Cheese from the kids menu, which was a generous portion.  One oversight here is that while they provide a healthy side of apple slices and blueberries (awesome!) they are served in a glass mason cup with a hinged lid.  While it looks neat, it&#39;s probably not the best choice of plating for a young child. I would like to see it maybe in plastic or some other alternative. It did come with a free logo frisbee used as the plate, which I thought was pretty cool. 
One last thing, although not a big deal, was the men&#39;s restroom. There are two urinals in there, and one of them is positioned so high on the wall that it is unusable for me. I am 6&#39; 1&#34;. Just kinda peculiar, and on a busy night that could be an issue for some customers. 
I have high hopes for this place. It is a great addition to the downtown area. If they get their house in order, and maybe remove the condescending letter from the front of the menu, it can be a great place to go. I will give it another chance next time I pass through Yorkville.  The food quality alone is plenty reason enough."

The service was very good.  
Our only complaint was the noise level of the music at lunch time.  We felt it could be turned down just a bit as we were shouting over our burgers when in conversation. Yes, I suppose I&#39;m showing my age here, but honestly for a restaurant and not just a bar, conversation is nice.   We highly recommend and will be back. By the way- the fries were amazing too. 
Great work Crusade!"

But I can say we were disappointed. I really liked the concept of this place and how it looks, I also really liked how they don&#39;t have well known drafts and alcohol list. They have over 30 beers on tap with a wide range which is awesome! For our appetizer we wanted the bacon wrapped mozzarella, which our server said he was sold out of them. So we settled for pork nachos which is kinda hard to mess up... which they did. I don&#39;t not recommend these! The pork was fatty and gritty and had no sauce so the pork was also dry, mixed with an overwhelming amount of cilantro and chunks of onions this was not a good combination. There was some type of cheese sauce but you have to dig all the way to the bottom of the plate to find it. We would have told our server but he was sitting at the corner of the bar talking to some blond. Our food came out pretty quickly we ordered two burgers my fiancé got fries and I got the chipotle mashed potatoes. The burgers were ok, kinda mushy it would have been nice to get a cook option. The fries were very good. The mashed potatoes on the other hand were warm at best and tested like they had been portioned, cooled, then put into the microwave, they were very dry and had no flavor. I had gotten half way through my burger when the server finally finished chatting and came back for the first time after taking our order. I told him about the mashed potatoes and he was quick to replace them for fries. When the fries came out there was a lot of them and very fresh. This is a place I probably wouldn&#39;t came back and order food from but a place that I could hang at the bar and try their different drinks."

I haven&#39;t tried a burger I didn&#39;t thoroughly enjoy here so I feel like I have to keep going back until I try them all. I did have some brisket Mac n cheese that was great, but glad I tried it. I keep telling myself I&#39;m going to get an adult milkshake but I always eat too much and can&#39;t find the space to fit it. On our last visit, our waiter suggested some sort of licorice flavored shot drink to help digest the mass amounts of food we ate.

Concern was when my 16 year old tried the chipotle mashed potatoes and they were SUPER-SPICY.  She asked if she could get another vegetable and server took request to the manager, who said NO.   All the adults at the table agreed these were not a normal level of spicy--our server even told us that several people had sent them back that night and he believed that this batch was extra spicy.  Can&#39;t believe they couldn&#39;t substitute another $1 vegetable and instead we left with a bad feeling about the management.  Otherwise we did enjoy the burgers but the fries were just average and not very hot when served.  I suggest warning patrons who order the chipotle mashed potatoes that they are exceptionally spicy!"

This place looks great! It is clean, has a great selection of beer, and has an amazing staff.

However, the burgers are sub-par and they need to work on consistency. The burgers are supposed to be served medium, and I usually order mid rare. I figured go with what is recommended and make changes later. Mine came out RARE, no band of pink just solid red. And I was OK with you that since I usually order mid rare to rare.

I ordered the You&#39;re the one for me, fatty. It was a big pile of unflavored mush meat. I could barely tell the difference between the patty and braised brisket. Adding in avocado just added to the mush fest, and it&#39;s flavor didn&#39;t add anything to the party. Nothing was seasoned except for the garlic fries, and those were missing salt.

I still have hope for this place. They need to work on actually seasoning the burger, and getting the cook correct. Decent beer and the mac and cheese looked great. However for my burger fix I&#39;ll be driving to Schaumburg and Kumas Corner."

The fries were cold.  Despite being almost empty, it took almost 20 minutes to get the food.  Very limited menu. One family came in, looked at the menu and walked out as staff watched them. I don&#39;t see this restaurant making it.  Far too expensive for this area and for the quality and selection of the food.

I&#39;m not a fan of these fancy burger places that try and recreate the hamburger. I don&#39;t want topping options that have no place being on a burger. I prefer the simple traditional options. Some people like it, just not me.  The taste of the actual hamburger gets lost in its toppings. 
So why did I give it such a high rating then?  My basic burger was a 1/2 pound of great taste. The meat to bun ratio was perfect, and the fries were damn good. If you&#39;re a beer drinker, you&#39;ll love their selection too. The price was a bit expensive, but you are getting quality food that nowhere resembles fast food. 
Give this place a try if you&#39;re an adventurous eater or just someone who can appreciate a good basic burger. Either way you win with this place."

Went there tonight was greeted by their host who looked like she hadn&#39;t bathed in two weeks and was told they were on an hour wait. There were 3 tables open and about 5 stools at the bar. 1 hour for hamburgers come on. I went to the bathroom only to see more than half of the restaurant is a game room in the back that was totally empty. Leaving the bathroom i ran into some people i knew there who were trying it and were furious as how expensive it was for what they got. I looked at the menu and after seeing how limited it was we decided to take out business elsewhere. You people are supposed to know what you are doing the real estate in that restaurant is not cheap. And to have more than half of it sitting empty with pool tables and other games is a shame. I know the kitchen can handle more tables because Kendall pub had seating in the back. I wonder what the next restaurant will be after this one shuts down?


UPDATE- After getting several messages from fellow Yelper&#39;s, it appears Crusade has chosen to put my review on their facebook page to be made fun of. This shows the kind of arrogance management of this place has. Judging by the other complaints they are getting if they do this to all the people who do not like their restaurant which they have quite a few now, their whole face book page is going to wind up hurting them more then my review. Customers are hard to come by this group thinks its funny to get a bad review."

I had the knife party burger, which was excellent!! Cooked to medium, fresh and scrumptious. Best burger I have had in a long time. Fries are fresh cut but a bit bland; they definitely benefit from the added flavorings, such as the salt&amp;vinegar or garlic butter. Husband and two boys each had The Ordinary Bob Burger, all said it was excellent, and oldest son had the pulled pork mac n&#39; cheese and loved it! Burgers are big! Expect to be stuffed. Waitress was helpful, cheerful and quick. We knew they are adjusting to being so busy, so didn&#39;t mind the 45 minute wait to get a table. We got their app and walked down along the river. App told us when we were next, so headed back and enjoyed adult beverages until the food came. 
I only have 2 suggestions to improve the experience: 
1. It was very loud. They need to add noise buffers to the ceiling or something to soften the noise level. 
2. There isn&#39;t really any area where you can stand or sit and wait for your table. Maybe they can put some benches outside."

I stated previously I loved the burgers. I decided to give the other food on the menu another shot since I heard their menu expanded and changed a bit since opening. Let me tell you I now love it all! I went with a group of 7 for a birthday celebration and ordered the Mac and cheese/pulled pork and pork nachos for an appetizer and they both were AMAZING. I even commented to our server on how the mac and cheese has improved in my opinion and they actually said they value reviews and adjust as necessary (which in my opinion is great customer service). Again I ordered another build your own burger and again amazing. My party all ordered various burgers and NOONE had a bad thing to say. Plus the portion size is so filling it&#39;s worth the cost.

The decor is a little unconventional,  but I loved it.  It&#39;s dark,  and a little hipster but it&#39;s a nice chance from Yorkville&#39;s usual boring restaurants.  The host originally told us ot would be a 25 minute wait but then we were told that a table was actually available.  It seemed like there were still some kinks to be ironed out, honestly give them a break,  they just opened.  Our waitress was so awesome and attentive to our table, she laughed with us and chatted with us while a friend looked at the menu.  The menu itself is limited,  but holy cow the burgers are good! The only major thing is that is expensive,  my mushroom and Swiss burger (called the Day of our Lords)  was 13 dollars but I think it was well worth it.

Time of my visit: Evening

This was not my first time there.  I have been to this place before, based on advise of my former supervisor.  I was surprised on how empty the place was on a Friday night.

Today, I ordered chicken shawarma in a wrap and two falafels to go.  Chicken shawarma was delicious from the first bite!  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the marinade they use or spices or a combo of both, but it was just devine!  The falafels...  Not so much...  They did not taste fresh and tasted like they were sitting under the heating lamp since lunch.

I give this place an A-, but definitely will be coming back there for more of that chicken shawarma!"

The rice is super soft and flavorful, and the tzatziki sauce is one of the best Ive had. I stopped by to get some lunch to-go and got the Kifta lunch platter which came with ground meat, rice, pita bread, and tzatziki sauce. I believe it was $8.25...pretty good deal!  The place was clean and the decor simple, nothing fancy. 

Aside from the platters, theyve got shawarma, burger, hummus, wraps etc. The flavors are just amazing, and they made me remember how much I love mediterranean food! 

This place has easily become a favorite lunch spot. Too bad its a little out of the way for me. But I cant wait to try their chicken kebab platter and falafel! Im sure they will not disappoint!"

I wanted a chance to catch up with them before the meeting so, HEY LET&#39;S LEAVE EARLY AND GO TO LUNCH FIRST. I&#39;m always full of unusually grand ideas. Anyway, I was on my phone and didn&#39;t really read what kind of place it was. I assumed a &#34;bar and grill&#34; and saw the good reviews. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it was Middle Eastern food, which I love and had not had in a while. I&#39;ve been to plenty of places like the Pita Inn or &#34;add your favorite middle eastern place here.&#34; 

I found the food to be of really, really good quality. It was made fresh to order and was AWESOME. My coworker, who is Polish (wasn&#39;t sure if he liked this kind of food) was super impressed too. He said, &#34;Good choice, Q.&#34; That is a high compliment from him. 

I ordered a chicken and steak plate with rice and pita bread. It was really good. I don&#39;t remember what he ordered. There was meat and rice (helpful, aren&#39;t I?) but he enjoyed his food too. 

A really nice surprise that I would not have guessed by the name. Cute place. Great food!"

The atmosphere inside Cedar Grill is similar to that of most quick serve restaurants.  If you are eating in or taking your food to go, you can order at the counter and they let you know when your food is ready.  In the past I&#39;ve ordered their meat and pita type meals, but lately my addiction has been their vegetarian sampler appetizer.  The vegetarian sampler comes with hummus, baba ghanouj, falafel, tabuli, and pita bread. The size of this platter is appropriate for two hungry adults (lots of pita bread provided).  The different vegetable dishes that come with this meal are fresh and seasoned perfectly.  During my last visit, I tried this homemade garlic sauce that Cedar Grill makes,and that was a nice addition to the meal.  Meat eaters and vegetarians can all find delicious options here."

The place is in a pretty busy strip mall on a stretch of Ogden Ave. that moves fast so you might drive right past if you&#39;re not looking for it.  The decor is bright and clean and there is another huge dining room adjacent to the main dining room so plenty of seating if you&#39;re not carrying out.  Ordering at the counter was easy and the food was made to order.  I ordered a Chicken Swarma Wrap and although it took awhile to get it - it was totally worth the wait.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful with a tangy garlic sauce and tahini on a crispy pita. 

It was a decent size wrap for $5.99 and I had planned to only eat half but...well...you know, I sure changed my mind about that!  I had a great lunch for under $10.  I looked at a few of the dinner plates as they came off the counter and they looked fabulous too.  I can&#39;t wait to go back to try their falafel and hummus.  This place is a gem!"

They charge extra for the white sauce and my friends and I didn&#39;t know until the waiter told us after we asked for two cups of white sauce. 

The water from the soda dispenser there also tasted like it has a high amount of iron in it too and I was really disgusted with the taste of it."

So it may not be for every taste. Mine included, which is why I preface my review stating this. So even though it may not be the go to place for my taste buds that is no fault of the staff or ingredients. 

I ordered the beef schwarma and lamb sausage plate. The schwarma was basically a gyros but seemed much leaner. The meat seemed to be primarily beef and seasoned. It came with 4 small pitas to fold the meat into. I just don&#39;t think schwarma is for me since I&#39;ve had it at two different places with the same reaction. It&#39;s just a bit too dry and bland for my likes. The lamb sausage was very tasty. Almost sweet. It seemed kind of like a dessert sausage if that makes sense. Both entrees came with a large pile of rice. The rice was also tasty. No complaints about the rice. I just wish the food matched the pictures they had advertised since I was hoping for grilled vegetables as well. None of that was included. 

The staff was also very friendly. Thought be prepared to wait about ten minutes for your food depending on what you get. Overall a very good location for this type of food. I plan to visit again."

I came here for lunch with my boo. I ordered the sampler platter, which included tabbouleh, hummus, falafel, and baba ganoush. It was pretty awesome! Pitas were okay. My boo ordered some meat fest (combo platter?) on top of pilaf: everything was awesome but the best/worst was the garlic sauce! So garlicky, so  rich...it was basically like garlic butter...which is great for the lips and bad for the hips. And breath. God, the breath."

You order at the counter and pick it up when it&#39;s ready. The prices seem to be in line with what other restaurants of this type charge. It&#39;s not a super bargain, nor is it overpriced.

Interestingly, Cedar Grill does not follow the Chipotle-esque practice of picking a protein, add-ins, and a sauce. This may make it more approachable for those new to the cuisine. Instead, you pick a type of wrap, sandwich or bowl. In most cases you&#39;ll be presented with all three options for the proteins (e.g. beef kabob, chicken shawarma, kifta kabob).

The hummus appetizer was really tasty. I ate it with the supplied pita bread and used it later to help flavor my meal. Their falafel came out to the pickup counter hot and tasty - a very nice example.

The beef kabob pita wrap got good reviews from my dad. My mom&#39;s chicken shawarma pita wrap was also good, though she wasn&#39;t that happy with the sauce, which was liberally applied. My beef shawarma pita wrap was decent, but I didn&#39;t enjoy it as much as versions I&#39;ve had elsewhere.

Finally, the baklava was pretty good, though the portion size was small. If I&#39;m in the area (near Belmont and Ogden - just west of Fannie Mae), I&#39;d stop in again."

The portion was huge! I was surprised when I brought the food back to my hotel that it included lentil soup. The soup was very flavorful and the chicken was tender and moist. Their rice is exceptionally good and huge in portion size as well. Everything paired well with their garlic sauce. I thought their hummus was good but lacked in flavor a little but I did enjoy it with their pita. 
Later I tried the baklava with a cup of hot tea. It had a delightful creamy taste and not overly sweet. I have plenty for leftovers!

The chicken shawarma is very good, and for a comparison, you will find it more flavorful than Naf Naf&#39;s chicken shawarma.  The difference seems to be in the cumin and turmeric, where Naf Naf&#39;s is subtle, Cedar Grill&#39;s cumin and turmeric is rather prominent, so if you like a nutty, mustard flavor profile and a pronounced yellowish sauce, you will enjoy this shawarma. 

The gyro is typical fare, so does not appear to be homemade by them.  If it is, kudos to them, because the regular gyro that is mass produced is just fine by me, with great consistency in flavor across different vendors.  My one peeve about gyro is that often times, it is not browned enough, and the meat is limp and lacks that good, charred meat flavor and texture.  Cedar Grill does their gyro right as far as this goes, and the flavor is quite good.  It should also be noted that the portions of meat are generous in their gyro pita order.

Their hummus is a bit ordinary, lacking any real citrus accent so it is more of a compliment to whatever is it with.  I like my hummus to have a better flavor profile (again, comparing to Naf Naf, where Naf Naf&#39;s definitely has a lemony citrus profile, I find that to be very good against the subtle but savory profile of their shawarma).

Cedar Grill&#39;s menu is much more than just pita sandwiches and fries (good fries, too!).  While I haven&#39;t yet had the opportunity, I plan to try the rice and meat dishes, especially the kifta and kabobs.  The falafel also looks good, as well as the salads, enough that I will give them all a try.

Last worth mentioning is that they recently expanded their dining area to include a well apportioned space next door now connected to the original space.  Dine in seating now is a problem of the past (this shop gets busy at lunch time, so a good move on their part).

Overall, a great little lunch spot for middle eastern / Mediterranean fare.

Grades:  Seating / Atmosphere - B (ample and comfortable, but not luxurious); Food - B-plus;
Service C (waits can be a little long, but the food is always fresh and hot).

Overall, B."

The garlic sauce is excellent and the chicken is always seasoned and after eating has a clean, non-greasy finish. Also the falafel is one of the best around the Chicago-metro area; crispy on the outside and very soft and fluffy inside, without it being too oily. 
The eatery has a hole-in-the-wall diner kind of feel; also clean and a bright atmosphere. They also added more room for seating so there is always ample space and there is free wifi - that actually works. 
A great place to eat with a variety of very tasty foods at an economical price, food that is prepared with a high level of quality and care, and a location that is very spacious and clean.

Great authentic middle eastern food which we thought did not exist in our area until my wife and I found cedar grill!  The food is authentic, delicious and healthy... Reasonable prices and good portions... We carry out there on a regular basis and highly recommend the Swarma&#39;s, Kabobs and Hummus!"

Tips: ask for your wrap or sandwhich to be DELUXE (This will add fries and a pickle which creates a unique flavor)... they do carry a nice hot sauce but you have to ask. 

Restaurant ambiance is nothing special just reminds you of a mom and pop restaurant but always packed. You can fit aroudn 20 people in there comfortable though. 

They do have free wifi if your interested in a nice lunch meal and still being able to work. 

I am a regular here and will continue to be. ALL employees are genuine and willing to give opinions. They are definately not stingy as my wife and I tend to share our meals. Very reasonably priced. 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

Appetizer sampler (hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, toubouli) - the falafel was a big winner!! Nicely fried and very crispy. Delicious dipped in the hummus, which is slightly spicy from the seasoning &amp; oil they put on top. The baba ganoush was very smokey flavored and smooth. The toubouli needed some extra lemon juice though.

Chicken schwarma pita wrap - looks small, but it&#39;s very filling. Slather it with the garlic mayo!

Rice plate with beef schwarma - tasty rice pilaf topped with beef served with a grilled piece of green pepper and tomato half. The beef was a bit dry and tough, but adding some of the garlic mayo made it taste better."

The combination plate with the chicken shwarma and beef kabobs were super tender!  This place has pretty decent food.  It&#39;s not comparable to Naf Naf grill but still a pretty cafe to grab something quick and delicious to eat if you&#39;re craving Mediterranean food!  Pricing is fair since you get a pretty good portion! The only gripe I had was the soda machine had no ice.

I&#39;ve been a handful of times and each time the food has gotten even better than the last time around. The hummus is a must. Also the chicken kabobs and mixed platter .

The entrees come with a complimentary house lentil soup (simply delicious). I would visit just to grab the lentil soup alone. Staff are friendly and the place is clean. Small little joint on Ogden Ave, make sure not to miss it (next to the jeep dealership)."

It is juicy and bursting with flavor. The meat is of the best quality too, I never fear that I will find a fatty or veiny piece of chicken. The fallafal is also great and so is their beef. The beef has a unique flavor. Also their hot sauce is where it&#39;s at! I always take home the leftover hot sauce and put it on everything. Also their lentil soup is divine! Yum!"

It definitely moved up to the top of my middle eastern food places to go for lunch that are by work.  Chicken shawarma and the mixed grill are good.  The soup is tasty.  The flow in here does suck.  People like to just stand in the way which they believe is a right since they already ordered.

Hummus- little flavor
Falafel- nothing unique, taste like it was frozen and thrown into the deep fryer.

A coworker is in town from FL and found this place... Yea, I don&#39;t get out for lunch much as I bring mine to work.  We ventured out to the Grill today after my coworker had checked it out a couple days ago and loved it.

I had the House Lentil Soup, Beef Schwarma with the added Hummus inside, and a piece of Baklava... Now that&#39;s not exacly what I ordered... My coworker that discovered this placed ordered the Lentil Soup &amp; Greek Salad.  Another coworker ordered the Lentil Soup, Hummus, and a Lunch Special.  

The owner was funny and helpful with taking our orders.  When our order arrived an extra soup came out for me (w00t!) and 3 pieces of Baklava for us all (wu wu wu!)! This was totally awesome!

The House Lentil Soup was bound to be good cuz it was free, right?!  HAHA!  Just kidding... It was actually Amazing! And I&#39;m not saying that just because it was free! The Beef Schwarma was deceivingly small, but rediculously filling!  And the flavors were spot on!  I tried my coworkers Hummus and Pitas as well... Very good!  The Pitas were not stale as mentioned in previous reviews.  My other coworkers Salad was HUGE!  Everything in it was fresh and crisp!

Food was hot, fresh and delicious; made to order without hesitation as I had asked for some substitutions. Soup was tasty and chicken shawarma plate was delicious. 

Only thing which made this not completely 5-stars in my opinion (still gave it 5 stars because the restaurant had no say over traffic) was that it was difficult to get to location-wise from Ogden. I couldn&#39;t turn left from westbound Ogden so I had to make a u-turn in rush hour traffic."

Really I have never had a bad meal here.  Bear in mind that this is a cafe / takeout place, so there is a ceiling on how good it can be (IE this is not Hedary&#39;s in Dallas), but for what it is, one really could not ask for more.   I&#39;d say the quality is very comparable to the Naf Naf grill chain (which I also like), but that the menu is somewhat more comprehensive.

My family kept on raving about this place, and I don&#39;t know why! I thought I could trust their taste buds better than this. Chose the chicken kabob plate with rice pilaf, and a side of lentil soup and some hummus to share. The chicken was actually decent, but the rice was so flavorless. Disappointing.

Being new to the western suburbs i had no idea where to go.  Being originally from the southside, i was spoiled with the options i had.  

Everything about this place was bad.   

Lets start with the food.  I really really was hoping this place was going to be as good as some on here have stated.  It just wasnt.  They were &#34;sold out&#34; of the beef sharwarma by 2pm on a Saturday.  Apparently they didnt have any more?? i dont know.  I ordered the chicken instead and it as ok at best.  the sandwich was SMALL.  Not much flavor going on.  Bland. 

I also wanted a half dozen falafel but apperently he was out of that too?  

I was 0 for 2 at this point.   Went with the hummus and that was bland and boring as well.  

I wont even begin to go into how dirty and grimy this place was.  The grill/cooking area looked like it hasnt been cleaned in a year.  The dining area had food on most of the tables and garbage on the floor.  

If i could give 0 stars, i would.  Cedar Grill needs Robert Irvine to come here and do a restaurant impossible episode."

Still, we enjoy their food enough to stop here whenever we happen to be in the neighborhood.

So the other day, I really wasn&#39;t in the mood for the regular items of this cuisine that I usually go for. But my wife was, and we were driving right by it. She ordered the shish-kebab plate, and after staring at their menu for 5 minutes trying to get in the mood for baba ganoush or something (as if staring at the words would whet my appetite), I finally ordered a gyro as a &#34;consolation.&#34;

Holy Moly!  Let me tell you... I have never had a gyro that tasted so good!!!  I maybe order 2-3 per year, generally from hot dog joints whose gyros get high praises.  While I do enjoy them, compared to Cedar Grill, their meat is DRY.  This meat was cut thicker than I ever had before, and then grilled crispy on the outside (but juicy on the inside).  And the sauce complemented the meat rather than being the crux to the entire sandwich.

Sorry Nicky&#39;s and Mickey&#39;s... you may know your hot dogs, but you don&#39;t know gyros! But thanks to Cedar Grill (and my wife), i now do (and you can bet your sweet bippy that I&#39;ll be having LOTS more than 2-3 per year)."

I am a HUGE fan of Naf Naf Grill in Naperville, and he swears that this place is even better.  I did not agree; Naf Naf tastes much better to me. 

I tried the Chicken Shwarma, because that is my favorite thing at Naf Naf, and it was a completely different sandwich than what you get there - which I was fine with, but still nowhere near as good.  Their Chicken Shwarma comes more like a wrap, with everything wrapped up in this warm pita.  I like that it was easy to eat, but the flavor of the meat was missing and all I tasted was the hummus that was on my sandwich - which I did like.  I was surprised when I ordered and asked for a side of fries that they told me that the fries are actually in the sandwich, along with pickles, hummus and tomatoes.  The fact that there was so much in the sandwich made up for the fact that the chicken had little to no flavor, but I still wasn&#39;t a big fan of this sandwich.

Both the pictures of the kabobs and other Yelp reviews have enticed me to give this place another try and try something different next time, so I will update my review when I do that.  However, my advice is that if you are a fan of chicken shwarma - keep going and head to Naf Naf Grill - nothing is as good as theirs.  One plus is that this place also has American food items (hot dogs &amp; hamburgers) for the non-adventurous eater/children, which is great."

The food... well... I don&#39;t  know where to start. 
 
The wonton soup looked flat and boring. No cabbage, shredded carrots, or sliced pork. When I bit into the dumpling it tasted spoiled and sour. I immediately spat it out. 

The garlic chicken was okay in flavor but I&#39;m not sure if I was actually eating chicken.... it had a funny texture. 

The pork fried rice is incredibly greasy and ladened with too much soy sauce. 

One positive. My brother said it was the best orange chicken he&#39;s every had."

The lunch special is a must-try. For about 5 bucks you get a big bowl of pork fried rice topped with an entree with either a soup or can of soda and an egg roll. Some other places use a cheaper variation of the fried rice for the lunch special, but not here. I usually get the Mongolian Beef lunch special with wonton soup.

I remember when this place opened 4 or 5 years ago. I haven&#39;t tried Garden China until now-I even ordered off of the grand opening menu. Be warned that prices have increased since 2010 *gasp* :). 
   The good: Food was hot and ready to pick up when we arrived. The inside of the place didn&#39;t look like a hideout for the TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for those not in the loop). It was clean and the employees were very friendly. Onto the food-the crab rangoon and beef teriyaki appetizer were delicious. I usually don&#39;t like orange chicken because of it having too much breading, but this orange chicken was crisp and you could actually taste the meat. The Hunan beef was also very good. The portions are huge. 
     The not-so-good: The chicken wings were not that flavorful. I&#39;ve had much better egg rolls at other restaurants. We ended up getting only 2 hot mustard packets for 20 pounds of food (and fighting to the death for who gets to use them was not an option).

They have so much to offer including an extensive food menu and eclectic atmosphere.

I was overwhelmed with options and a fast moving line when I first entered, so I kind of felt a bit rushed to order. They mean business at 12:30pm and keep the line moving, which is good though. My stomach was telling me to get one of their delicious Philly cheesesteak sandwiches, but my mind said I should probably make a healthier decision so I went with the California wrap. 

In the end my &#34;healthier&#34; choice didn&#39;t really matter, because I chose a side of fries and the wrap was about the size of ginormous burrito. Needless to say, everything was really good! The fries were kind of sweet and salted perfectly. The wrap included fresh ingredients and was super delicious. For like $9 (including a bottle of water), this meal was really two in one. I took home half the wrap and half the fries and enjoyed it the next day for lunch!

Augustino&#39;s looks like a carry-out sandwich spot, but it&#39;s much more than that. They have flatbreads, pastas, and a full deli of goodness. Make your way to the right of the ordering counter and you&#39;ll find a side room with plenty of tables, TVs, and fun rock and roll paraphernalia. A fun spot for food, that&#39;s for sure!"

I loved all of the old school diners when I live out east and was hoping for the same here!

I ordered the Broccoli Cheese soup and Pastrami on Onion roll. The soup was thick and had a very odd flavor. I didn&#39;t like it, so I didn&#39;t eat it. The pastrami was ok, but the onion roll was super dry. 

The boy ordered Chicken Noodle soup and Auggie&#39;s Patty Melt. He said it was a pretty standard soup and he enjoyed it enough to eat it all. The melt was a little greasy. He&#39;s a burger lover, but didn&#39;t rate this one in his top list. It was just ok. The flavor was there and the cheese was melty.

So the first thing I noticed is the fresh meat and cheese they have up front. That is pretty cool.

I love sub sandwiches and Italian has always been my favorite at any sub places. I noticed the person behind me and the two people in front of me ordered the same thing. So it seems like the popular thing to order here.

My sub sandwich was good. Not great, but it was good. I liked how they put a lot of onions in the sandwich. For chips, drink, and sandwich it was almost 10.00. Almost like Quiznos when ordering their Italian (which I think theirs is quite tastier).

Someone said that Portillos is cheaper then this place and I tend to disagree. I think they are about even.

One thing that really bothered me was that is was an older building and it seemed like it was outdated. They had an outside eating patio, but it looked outdated with outgrowing plants (I think the owners like plants because it looked like a jungle out there). Thus I am giving it 4 stars.

It&#39;s a good mom and pop place. I won&#39;t come here again, but you have to at least come here once."

I opted for the Build Your Own Burger with provolone, mushrooms, and stone ground mustard: my favorite!It&#39;s $8 and seemingly one of the few things that comes with fries. 

Being this was my first time, I read the menu, but the employee who helped me was a bit surly. When he asked &#34;Is that all you want on it?&#34;, I asked if there were vegetables like lettuce and tomato. He said, dryly, &#34;Well, it&#39;s build your own, so yeah.&#34; Erm... okay, guy. I explained it was my first time there and didn&#39;t recall seeing the veggies listed on the menu, nor did I know I had to ask for them specifically, as many places include those staples.

It didn&#39;t seem too busy at 6:30 on a weekday, but took 10+ minutes to get my order. Everything was piping hot, though.

The burger was pretty large (1/2#) and on a sturdy bun. The mushrooms were fresh (NOT canned!), as were the lettuce and tomato. The portion of fries was generous.

Overall the food was good, but the smarmy service makes this just an A-OK experience."

Time of my visit: Early dinner

This was my first time visiting the place.  I had high expectations as several people had recommended this place to me.  At this point I am not sure I&#39;ll be back.

Let&#39;s get to the food.  I ordered ruben (and there was issue number one, at $8.99 it did not come with any sides), so I asked for homemade chips, which added another $2 and change to my order...  At this point, the prices are at or slightly above a sit down place with a real wait staff, which this place is by no means is.  My girlfriend ordered Italian combo (which she enjoyed, but the taste was about the same as the famous midwest chain, I won&#39;t mention here, but here at a higher price).  At least the size of the combo was descent.  The second red flag was a quarter charge for water... Seriously?!  I get it, plastic cups cost money, but at your prices you can&#39;t give someone a free cup of water?!

Now to the food.  I must say I was not impressed with my ruben, it was not anything special.  Homemade chips tasted just like any other homemade chips I has ever had.  The food was not anything spectacular, about average.

Let me mention the service...  As it&#39;s a big part of restaurant experience.  The cashier, that took our order, was perky and nice, the guy who brought it out to us, had this look on his face, which almost made me asking him, &#34;blink twice if you are here against your will...&#34;  But yet when one of his friends showed up, he was all Mr. Social.  Look, I worked in a grocery store when I was in high school, you better believe it, if I was not giving customers anything other than 100%, my manager would have ripped me a new one (and yes, I am not that old, it was in late 90s, when I worked at the grocery store in high school).

Overall, it&#39;s not worth the money.  Sorry to say it&#39;s an overpriced joint.  For what we got, we could have eaten the same thing at a sit down place for less.

Price wise, food taste and service is a C-.  Barely above D, friendliness of the cashier gets that slight notch."

My daughter loves it and it&#39;s probably one of her favorite restaurants because of the italian ice and the decor.  She doesn&#39;t actually really eat the food from here, maybe an occassional nibble on a burger, but she always demands we go if we are passing by.
The ordering system is a little wonky at times because people are slower and then you have to awkwardly pass them so you can pay.  I&#39;m not sure how it could be done better, but when it&#39;s packed it&#39;s a big pain.
Other than that it&#39;s a pretty standard restaurant.  The Italian beef is delicious and so far I haven&#39;t had anything I didn&#39;t like.  The house made chips are also yum.
The kids meals are nice for the kids because it includes a drink and the Italian ice.  Parking can be a little bit crazy because the lot opens into Schmale as well as St Charles."

Décor: This being my first visit to an Augustino&#39;s I had no real idea what to expect... and boy was I surprised haha. They have kind of a cheesy rock &#39;n roll, 1950&#39;s motif going on but inside and outside. It&#39;s a bit more strange that than, however, because it isn&#39;t trying to be &#34;authentic&#34; or period-correct, it&#39;s trying to be cheesy. There is a bunch of stuff on the walls and such and a giant guitar in a glass case and the dining room has a Marilyn Monroe statue in the middle... it&#39;s pretty bizarre... but ultimately &#34;fun&#34;, I guess. Anyway, everything was well taken care of and clean, so I certainly cannot complain.
Bathroom: decently well looked after, clean, and well lit

Staff: The sandwich guy and cashiers were both friendly and patient (I ordered my sandwich ass-backwards) and the &#34;bus boy&#34; (kid sweeping the floors) was also nice.

Food: We had a Turkey Burger (BIG burger, very tasty) with cheese fries (dynamite cheese and fries) and an Italian Sub (HUGE and quite enjoyable) with homemade chips (enjoyable). The food was delivered to our table rather quickly and tasted just fine. The portions are pretty sizeable as well.

Value: Given the portion sizes I&#39;d say you leave here ahead given the prices.

This was an interesting place with, ultimately, enjoyable food. I could see us coming back here again."

The ambience and the decor goes well with the name. The food is good for a deli and the staff is friendly.

I got the typical Italian sub - was good. Felt like it was missing peppers. Big portion! Leftovers when I got home.

Reminded me of Portillo&#39;s cheese fries (which is pretty much the only thing I like at Portillo&#39;s except the cake shake, but I don&#39;t hate myself enough to eat that anymore).

Also - gotta say - great meatball sandwich. There&#39;s actual meat in there! In ball form, no less."

I&#39;m a sucker for italian beefs and when I&#39;m home and craving it, I end up going to this place. The first time I wanted an Italian beef, I mistakenly said Italian beef sandwich and gotten a cold cut instead (it was busy during lunch hour and I never bothered to check my order) 

Next time, I specifically asked for the Italian Beef -- and it was alright. Just the sandwich could be a bit dry. What turned me off is that cheese and hot peppers are extra and I asked for it in all my sandwiches -- coming home and opening them, it turned out only one of the 3 had both. One was missing it all and one had only cheese. 
For a 5&#34; sandwich that ran me over $6, I expect it to be a bit better. I think I&#39;m gonna get my next fix of italian beef from portillos from now on :)

They have their own private parking lot so you don&#39;t have to worry about parking.
When you walk in all you have to do is place your order at the deli counter, pay and get a number. 
They bring your food to you right at your table.
We ordered the following:
-hot pastrami thinly sliced piled on high on soft rye bread really good. It wasn&#39;t too salty.
-A side of sweet potato fried crispy and sweet. And it was temperature hot fresh.
-turkey club on wheat with a side of cheese fries. 
They also have a few flat screen TVs in the dinning area. This place brings you back rock n roll style. Memorabilia all over the place.  In the background you can hear 50&#39;s music playing too.
 Staff are friendly and they&#39;re pretty quick and cleaning up your table when you&#39;re done.
They have a room that you could even have a private party also they have an outdoor patio which I plan to check it out over the summer.

Italian Beef

Meatball Sandwich
Italian Sub
American Sub
Homemade Italian Ice

I was a bit apprehensive, but I went along with everyone else (Disclaimer: To all my Yelp brethren, if you have a hunch, make sure you go with it. 9 outta 10 times you&#39;ll be right. Be open to your nonyelp friends suggestions, but be wary! I speak from experience)

Anyways, my initial feeling towards this place is and has been &#39;eh.&#39; Everyone else raves about how good the sandwiches are, but I just really had never been a fan. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m not a big sandwich guy in the first place. 

When I ordered this time, I used the custom deli. I did not make the mistake of ordering their gluten free bread (3.00 extra charge), so that was a plus. I ordered the oven roasted turkey breast with lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickle. NO MAYO! 

My order was correct, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much better the sandwich was than the last time I went to Augie&#39;s. I was put off by the long wait as well as the 14 dollars that I paid. This trip, I only paid 6 dollars for a substanially sized sandwich (It was sliced Rye; no roll).

I&#39;m glad I gave &#39;Augie&#39;s&#39; another try; Everyone else swears by it, and I guess if I ordered some of their more famous subs maybe I would too. I would defintely take this over Subway (funny since 2012 how Subway has gone down in quality and up in price). I will definitely be back, just not during the lunch rush hour!"

My husband and I and our 4 yr old son ordered dinner to go. My son got a cheeseburger kids meal. He started chugging his chocolate milk and then tells me it tastes horrible. I smelled it and it smelled like urine... No joke. I gagged. I looked at the expiration date and it was two days expired. I was furious that my son drank it and could possibly get sick from it!
I went back to augustinos (around 8 pm) and I see the manager and about 5 other employees standing around talking and laughing. So they have time to talk but can&#39;t go through their dairy products to make sure people (especially kids) don&#39;t consume spoiled milk?? Real nice. 
I got my money back but I&#39;m still upset that something that SHOULD NOT have happened did!! I hope after I left they checked the rest of the milk.... I mean after their hilarious, oh so important conversation."

From the outside, that kitschy &#39;50s American diner vibe just doesn&#39;t do it for me. I mean, I&#39;ll deal with it at Portillo&#39;s, but it&#39;s not as overwhelming as it is here. 

Enter Yelp, which has some fantastic reviews of this place, as well as elaborating on their menu. While it may look like a &#39;50s diner, it&#39;s actually a rather fantastic deli. They have burgers, fries, patty melts, hot dogs, Italian beef, and Italian sausage. But they also have great deli sandwiches, house-made salads, marinated olives, marinated mushrooms (you want some of these, trust me), and several flavors of Italian ice.

Not only that, I have to acknowledge the fact that they do something pretty unheard-of for most places like this out here: their water/soda cups, plates, to-go boxes, and all the other accoutrements of your typical fast dining experience (particularly if it&#39;s carry out) are all eco-friendly. No more being awash in a sea of #6 styrofoam that you can only recycle if you take it to the Dart facility in North Aurora! COMPOSTABLE TO-GO CONTAINERS. Sure, I&#39;ve seen them before, but usually only at places like Blind Faith or the Whole Foods cafeteria. This is a normal (but awesome), unpretentious deli -- and they care about the environment, too. And they&#39;re open late -- you can have a deli sammich for dinner, not just lunch! SCORE. 

I am so very down with that. We ate in, and ordered a chicken parmesan sandwich and an Italian oven grinder. The oven grinder was listed as being a two-handed sandwich -- which it is. I had to take half of it home to eat for lunch the next day, in fact. The marinated peppers and the special oil and vinegar sauce they put on this sandwich are magical, and perfectly balanced. The French bread is the perfect toasted, crunchy texture, as well. 

The marinated mushrooms are also fantastic. Just a little garlic, with a fantastic balance of olive oil, vinegar, and herbs. The marinara on the chicken parm is beautifully seasoned, and the whole sandwich is fantastic. My SO ordered that, so I only had a couple of bites, but I will definitely order myself one in the future.

Prices are super reasonable. My Italian oven grinder was just under $6 and I&#39;m getting two meals out of it. Score again. 

If you ask for a cup of water, they will charge you $.25...but since they&#39;re using the eco-friendly cups (and I know those aren&#39;t cheap), I&#39;m totally fine with it. That&#39;s less than a postage stamp costs. I am happy to spend a quarter to support an awesome eating establishment&#39;s choice to use less non-biodegradable crap in their daily business. 

Woot woot! We will definitely be back for more. Can&#39;t wait to try their reuben and their Italian ices! :9"

I rarely eat inside, so the 1950s decor isn&#39;t the draw for me at all, it&#39;s the sandwiches themselves. They pile the meat on nice and high, which is probably the biggest selling point. The bread they use for the buns is great, and they top the sandwiches well, but the quality of the meat itself is what makes the sandwich so good. They have a nice variety reminiscent of an old school deli, but in my opinion they undersell that. Not sure why. 

This is my favorite go-to for Sunday afternoon football food, so if you&#39;re eating Subway or Quizno&#39;s (even Jimmy John&#39;s), stop yourself and go to Auggies!"

Immediately recognizable with its jukebox themed exterior from the outside, Augustino&#39;s has a wide and diverse menu of items to try. Over the years I&#39;ve been to Augustino&#39;s a few times, and I pass the place nearly every day. You might be wondering, &#34;Why did it take you so long to review it&#34;. Well, it&#39;s never been a place I&#39;ve been super fond of, at least not enough to go out of my way to visit on anything resembling a regular basis. The other reason is quite frankly I was unaware they had hot dogs. Yes, the &#34;frankly&#34; was a pun, and a terrible one at that.

In walking into Augustino&#39;s there&#39;s a large counter with a menu board above you and a lot of food preparation stations. Someone comes over to face you and asks what you&#39;d like to order. The hot dog served by Augustino&#39;s is called the Aug Dog, and I decided to give it a try. I paid at the counter and took a seat in the 1950s themed dining area. 

What&#39;s interesting about Augustino&#39;s Rock and Roll deli is that it&#39;s really more of a 50s themed restaurant than Rock N Roll themed. Objects that I spotted not quite fitting the Rock and Roll theme were a statue of Betty Boop, Marilyn Monroe and some Rock em Sockem robots. Shortly after looking around my food was ready and I prepared to dig in and try the Aug Dog.

This hot dog came on a regular non-poppy seed bun. There were two long but well placed tomato slices on the hot dog so that tomato could be tasted in every bite. There was a thin pickle spear placed in the center of the dog. The application of mustard, onion and relish was excellent, and there were a couple of hot peppers applied to the dog but not in such a manner that you could consistently taste hot pepper flavor without reconfiguring the placement of these toppings. The sausage itself was skinless and appeared to be Vienna Beef or Red Hot Chicago.

 I took my first bite into the dog and was surprised by the outcome. This was an excellent hot dog. The condiments were well applied outside of the peppers, the bun was soft enough. I wouldn&#39;t quite say it was a five star hot dog, but I would definitely stop and try the Aug Dog again. Four stars."

A little over $7 for a 12 inch sub (that&#39;s closer to 15 inches) and a little over $4 for a 6 inch (that&#39;s more like a 9 inch) sub.

The meat is freshly cut for each sub as it&#39;s ordered, which makes it so much tastier than those pre-cut, pre-packaged meat subs from Subway.

I wasn&#39;t actually planning on eating here for dinner but It was unusually hot outside so I figured a cold sandwich would hit the spot. 

Compared  to the one on North Ave, this place is pretty small. The ordering process is kind of awkward too. You basically wait for your guy to make you the sandwich for you so you can pick it up and bring it to the cash register. I stood in the line and watched a few people walk ahead of me to the next guy that was open. 

I ordered:

Augies Italian Sub (6 inch) (Around 5 bucks): There are pros and cons to this sandwich, the bread is fantastic and chewy, its packed with different kinds of meat and the tomatoes,  onions, and lettuce tasted pretty fresh. Cheese was fine too. The problem I had is the house dressing, I normally expect italian subs to have some sort of tangy semi sweet zingy dressing. This dressing was just sort of salty which didn&#39;t go well with the salty meats and cheese already in the sandwich. In the end it still tasted fine. 

Chicken Noodle Soup: (2 dollars for a small): Had some sort of long wide home made fettuccine style noodle in it which tasted good. The soup itself was pretty generic and the chicken and vegetables were kind of lacking. 

In the end I&#39;m still not sure about this place, I&#39;m sure from the wide selection there are great items on the menu that I haven&#39;t tried so I&#39;ll keep going back to get a better idea."

We tried the beef, it was okay, and we tried the shrimp po boy wrap and that was good. The fries were average and the cheese sauce was terrible. The service I thought was eh. It rubbed me the wrong way when we were paying for the meal the person at the cash register said &#34;and what do you want for your drinks&#34;, implying we had drinks. I asked if they were included with what we ordered and of course they were not but to be honest I didnt know since it was my first time. Just kind of felt like if someone wasnt paying attention they could get bamboozled.

The decor was great, sort of a 50&#39;s theme but yet they were playing songs from today. Kinda thought if you&#39;re going for the 50&#39;s theme we would hear, well, 50&#39;s music, apparently not. My mental model also pictured ice cream and poodle skirts but thats just me."

I have heard people rave about this restaurant and then watched week after week as my boss would bring a BLT in to work from Augustino&#39;s- it looked like it had perfectly crisp bacon and bright red tomato and just looked so enticing that I decided to finally give it at try. 

My husband and I stopped by on a Saturday night. The line moved pretty fast but was confusing with who was waiting for something and when you could move ahead to pay. I did like the &#34;sandwich guy&#34; who was very friendly and helpful.

It felt like a very long wait for the food. Our table was really wobbly and the chairs weren&#39;t comfortable for the long wait. 

The decor in the restaurant is great and we enjoyed looking around and enjoyed the music.

My club sandwich was disappointing. The bacon wasn&#39;t crisp at all, the bread was really dry. It didn&#39;t taste nearly as I expected it would. The homemade chips were coated in parmesan cheese, which I don&#39;t believe the menu included in the description. I don&#39;t like cheese so that was a bummer. (My husband did love them, though.) We got a side of fried pickles and those were good but not amazing compared to other ones I&#39;ve tried at other restaurants.

The beef was ok. Lacked big time on the cheese. Especially since I was charged another $.85. I&#39;ve had much better beefs at Rosati&#39;s.

We have eaten in in the past, but pretty much exclusively call ahead and pick up now. They open rather early, even on the weekends, so you can call ahead and pick up a sandwich for lunch before work! When I&#39;ve had to do it early on a weekend, they&#39;ve asked me when I&#39;d like it ready, not just telling me a time, which I liked. Any other &#34;off&#34; time that I&#39;ve called ahead, I think they&#39;ve usually said 10-15 minutes, which leaves me just enough time to get off the phone and drive there. At dinner time I think they&#39;ve still only said 15-20 minutes, which isn&#39;t bad at all for being busy. And since just picking up at the counter, even if it is busy with the dinner rush, you don&#39;t have to deal with the line that others have mentioned. Quality is consistent, food is good, not crazy expensive. Honestly, we probably should expand our horizons a bit more with all their options on the menu, but we usually stick to the tried and true. My go to is usually the Italian sub, others in my family go for the American. Can never go wrong with cheese fries or breaded mushrooms. My husband loves the three bean/mixed bean (not sure official name) salad, he&#39;ll eat as much as I bring home. The last time we went, he thought he&#39;d try the sausage sandwich. (Based on the menu saying &#34;two hands&#34;, I think maybe it was the Maxwell and not Italian? But I can&#39;t recall at the moment.) Whatever it was, it was huge! At least a foot if not a few inches longer. But he was pleased with it. And that one they actually waited to assemble until I was actually there to pick it up. You know it&#39;s fresh when you see them do it! I think the only thing we&#39;ve gotten there that we haven&#39;t really enjoyed was the ravioli - then again it was for lunch the next day, so reheated which could change it a bit. But hey, everything else is good, and it&#39;s a deli anyway! Really no complaints here. Will continue to go back, and maybe even try something new!"

I was wrong.

My wife and I went to Augustino&#39;s for a late dinner... sometime around 8:30pm. She got a chicken sandwich and fries, while I got a roast beef sandwich with grilled onions and mushrooms, and a seasoned cheese sauce.

On the side, I had sweet potato fries. Maybe these don&#39;t meet some people&#39;s definition of &#34;real fries&#34;, but I don&#39;t care - they were crispy and needed only a little salt to reach perfection.

Now, the sandwich itself: The beef isn&#39;t thin and trending towards flavorless like Garibaldi&#39;s used to be (I only got it for the mushrooms!). Instead, the meat was sliced thick, and the marinade used for the meat was very good. The bread was lightly toasted; more importantly, it had flavor. The cheese sauce was thick, but not solid, and definitely had a little bit of kick to it. Fantastic.

My wife&#39;s chicken sandwich was thick, but still juicy all the way through - this is such a rare thing for white meat chicken sandwiches that I wonder if they brine the chicken before cooking. It came with a honey-mustard sauce that was strong on the mustard, and gave the sandwich (and fries) a nice, hot kick. Normally I&#39;m not a fan of hot mustards, so I was pleasantly surprised to be liking this sauce.

Next time, I&#39;ll try the cold cuts to see if they stack up as well."

The very best thing to get is the American sub in my opinion; however, everything else I have ever tried there has been great as well.  Not too long ago they had a po boy style wrap with breaded shrimp.  YUM.  It was the best po boy style sandwich I have had since I left New Orleans.  So many places here do a terrible job with shrimp since seafood isn&#39;t too common here, but Augustino&#39;s did a great job.  This location is the best in my opinion, but the West Chicago one is very nice as well.  It doesn&#39;t have the same &#34;old school&#34; feel to it, but it still is set up like a 50&#39;s diner and is just as nice."

Ordered a soup and a chicken parmesan sandwich.  Broccoli cheddar soup was watery and had to have salt added to it to give it some semblance of flavor.  And chicken parm&#39;s usually pretty straightforward and hard to screw up, right?  Well, more flavorless-ness.  Bread was a tad above average, sauce might as well come from a can from Jewel, and I&#39;ve had a better chicken patty on an airline.  Not to mention the presentation was just a sloppy mess.

As much as I love local sandwich places, especially places like this with a fantastic history in the community and decor that keeps me looking around, Augustino&#39;s under-delivered.  Definitely not worth the money - look elsewhere for a satisfying soup and sandwich."

Subs for everyone, tell them how you want it! They also have soup, pasta, burgers, wraps, salads, hot sandwiches . . . what more could you want? Many of the plates come with huge helpings of fries that you can share. Even the kid&#39;s menu items are fairly large. My little brother can&#39;t get enough of the mac n&#39;cheese, or the oreos on the side. I myself have tried a multitude of menu items, but my preferred dish will always be the turkey-bacon-club. It&#39;s big, tasty, and good-looking. If you&#39;ve got a sweet tooth but are looking for a healthier alternative to ice cream, try the Italian ice--and try several flavors! I like a mix of mango and strawberry, but they&#39;ve always got several choices. 

The best part about Augie&#39;s is the service. They are fast, always smiling, and super friendly. My family and I are regulars, so the owner always comes out to say hello. He even knows that my brother is picky and likes his chicken sandwich in a special way that differs from any other item on the menu, and we&#39;ve never had a problem getting it done that way. In fact, they made it wrong once and the owner himself came out with a new sandwich even though my brother didn&#39;t make a fuss. Augustino&#39;s is more than a restaurant--it&#39;s part of what makes this town home."

Took the teenager here for a lunch and he was in heaven!  He had the italian sub and I had a turkey wrap which had a great chipotle sauce on it.  It was a HUGE wrap, so I had half for lunch and half for dinner.

One thing we had which was just great, was homemade potato chips!  Yes, they are fattening, but what good food item isn&#39;t?

I have to agree with the other yelper who commented on the line.  They do tend to rush you, but that&#39;s only because it&#39;s usually out the door.  For some reason, this place is a big hit with all the contractors working in the area, so you&#39;ll see the painter, plumber, electrician, etc. trucks in the lot.

As mentioned, all the deli meat is sliced to order.  The french bread was nice and crusty on the outside and delicious and soft on the inside.  I had the Italian sub which was perfect.  Not too salty given all those yummy deli meats.  My wife had corned beef on rye and thought it was slightly above average, nothing to write home about.

It had been a while since I&#39;ve gone here and went back over the summer and picked up an Italian beef for my Dad and an American sub (minus bologna) for my sister. Now i&#39;ve read that the beefs are better than Portillo&#39;s (huge Portillos fan here) and my Dad also agreed. His sub did look rather tasty and I think the next time I go back I will have to get it. Augustino&#39;s has been consistently good throughout the years. It is a tad expensive for sandwiches - but worth it. They have great fresh cut fries and chips also. 

As stated in other reviews - this place gets PACKED at lunch time. It dies down after 1 or so - or at least it did when I went there. The parking lot is tiny so that fills up quickly. I think you can park in a &#34;lot&#34; adjacent to it but am unsure about that.

I thought the service was great, the guys who took our order could have been a little friendlier but I thought it added to the atmosphere. The ladies behind the register were a delight though, very helpful with a couple questions we had and just overall very kind. They even addressed people by sir and ma&#39;am... I like that.

My friend and I got the meatball sub and a turkey sandwich to share. Meatball sub was very good (I&#39;d ask for a little extra drizzle of marinara sauce) but the turkey was not very good at all. Because of the other great reviews I&#39;m going to let this one slide but the bread was that chewy should have been warmed or something kind of bread that makes you just want to eat the inside of the sandwich instead of suffer through the bite and tear motion over and over again. 

Couple more things:
Everything costs extra so if you don&#39;t want something on your sub when they ask you are saving yourself some $ (I just kept saying &#34;yeah sure&#34; because I didn&#39;t know)

Don&#39;t get your food &#34;to go&#34; if yo have never been here. I really loved the old-school art and even if you are eating by yourself there is at least ten minutes of looking around you could do before you get bored.

Italian ice should be avoided... artificial flavoring galore... eww."

The service is amusing, barking a lot of orders and directions but maintaining a friendly vibe.  Hard to pull off in most cases.

You grab the menu, pick out what you want, tell the cute guys behind the counter, grab your ticket and pay at the register.  

They take your money, give you your drink, and tell you to sit down because the burger you just ordered is a POUND, and will take a bit to cook.

I have never been disappointed with any selection. Considering the volume going through at lunch time, they keep the place clean. At times the line can be quite long and it is really awkward getting from the cashier to the eating area, the eating area to the parking lot and standing in line trying not to get in the way. In winter, it gets cold ad there is always somebody standing in your way. That part I think they could easily fix, but apparently the great food overcomes this inconvenience. I certainly beats all these trendy mall sandwich joints by a long shot and is probably a little cheaper and certainly better quality. The house chips are fantastic"

Mixed drinks were delicious. Location isn&#39;t the best but it&#39;s worth a visit for sure. 

The location appears to be well located, but if you&#39;re approaching from southbound Rt 59, getting to it requires local knowledge or GPS to find. The restaurant basically lost the star for that. No other complaints about the experience.

The crab rangoon was crispy on the outside and filling was sweet and creamy. No fishy taste whatsoever.

The filet mignon teriyaki was fantastic. We had the appetizer so when I ordered with the side of fried rice, I bit off more then I could chew. 

Lastly, their japanese delight mule was sweet and refreshing. The ginger beer owns the flavor of the drink, but when I&#39;m out for Japanese a strong ginger flavor is exactly in line with my expectations.

I would recommend this place."

We made reservations through OpenTable for Hibachi, and arrived on time. There was two hostesses at the front stand, and after standing there awkwardly in silence for over a minute, one of them finally looked up and half greeted me. (First disappointment.) We then had to wait for 20 minutes because the other group for our habachi table was running late. I&#39;ve been to lots of habachi places, and normally they seat you at your table while you wait for it to fill up - not here. So we sat around for 20 minutes before finally being sat. Once we were sat it took another 20 minutes until our server finally took our order. So yes, 40 minutes to finally get an order placed.

Our server was decent, and we got our soup &amp; salads right away. However, after finishing those, our chef still was not out at our table. When he did finally come out, he did a terrific job entertaining us and making a delicious dinner for all of us. And I would say the best part was certainly the food! The vegetarian was the best vegetarian habachi I have ever had, it included tofu &amp; noodles &amp; more! So terrific! My only compliant on the food would be that fried rice is not included at all, just white rice. So it&#39;s a $3 upcharge for chicken (or meatless) fried rice. Most places include fried rice, and only upcharge to add chicken. But that&#39;s okay... Like I said... The food was amazing!

Food: 5/5 (The best part!)
Drinks: 4/5 (Slightly overpriced) 
Service: 3.5/5 (Hostess, server, and chef)
Atmosphere: 3/5
Total Experience: 2/5 (Pretty frustrating evening, time and attention wise)

I think we would return at the right time - but it would only be because the food was downright delicious, not for any other reason."

One being that the spicy tuna was grounded instead of filet. More of a personal preference but definitely worth noting. Second would be the price. Everything there seemed to be about $4.00 more than every other Sushi place of this caliber. If you want to spend the money go to Sushi House. If you have coupons go to Shinto.

Happy hour is Monday-Friday 3PM-6PM and Saturday 2PM to 5PM. It&#39;s half-price select sushi and appetizers with purchase of one regular priced beverage. I lean towards nigiri and sashimi so I don&#39;t really like their special rolls menu (lots of &#34;tempura&#34; &#34;fried&#34; &#34;cream cheese&#34; in the descriptions). 

I usually order sake nigiri ($2.50) and unagi nigiri ($3); each order is 2 pieces. The quality is a hit or miss but it&#39;s been more hit than miss for me the last few times I was there. I don&#39;t really like how they do their maki rolls--- something is off with the rice maybe-- or the ratio...? For appetizers, I love the agedashi tofu ($2.50), beef mamanaki ($4), and vegetable tempura ($4). Their agedashi tofu is my favorite so far in the Naperville-Aurora area. My boyfriend loves the beef mamanaki---grilled beef wrapped around asparagus--- so a must for the sushi phobic. Sadly, I can&#39;t recommend any of their desserts. All the ones I&#39;ve tried (ice cream tempura and banana tempura) have been bland and had poor presentation (I pay full price for these so the standards are higher). 

The food is a solid 3. I&#39;m going to throw in another star for their service. I&#39;ve never had bad service here. It looks like there is a lot of teamwork. We have a main server who takes our order and checks in on us  multiple times throughout the meal. But other servers will come and bring our food, refill our waters etc."

At least for $9 you get a big glass full! :) We had a party of about 16 people and they accommodated us wonderfully. Plus they had an awesome selection of Daft Punk come across on their playlist!

Would you like a glowstick with your dragon roll?

Apparently the previous owners of this location operated a trendy bar, as there exists a hardwood dancefloor where there are now tables.  Interestingly enough, a color wheel/disco ball, black lights, and strobos are still present......and connected in the ceiling rafters!  Makes me wonder if they ever still make use of them after all the customers go home.  #SushiRave

Upon walking in, I immediately felt like I had entered a lounge (big surprise).  The lighting was sensual and the music distinctly clubby, which I totally dug.  The large freshwater fishtank was LOADED with colorful aquatic creatures and grabs your attention right away.  Once seated, Caty D and I glanced over the extensive sushi menu and made some decisions, a few of which were regrettable.

The gyoza (pot stickers) were cold and clammy, which I took exception to, but she didn&#39;t mind.  Caty D&#39;s miso soup was fine, and when it came time for nigiri rolls our reactions were mixed.  First off, the &#34;biggie&#34; roll was on special ($10 instead of the normal $15), so we got one of those, in addition to a &#34;fire &amp; ice&#34; roll ($12) and sashimi add-on ($5 extra).

Presentation-wise, the biggie roll looked amazing.  Taste-wise, it left something to be desired.  It was shrimp tempura with avocado and cream cheese, wrapped in soy paper and topped with a whole bunch of sh*t.  This &#39;whole bunch of sh*t&#39; included tempura crumbs, spicy mayo, eel sauce, and chicken motiyaki, which is basically teriyaki chicken.  There was ~far~ too much going on with this one, and quite honestly, it wasn&#39;t good.  Are you sushi, or teriyaki chicken?  Pick a lane, dudes!  Neither Caty D nor I found it appealing, and we&#39;re far from choosy eaters.

The fire &amp; ice roll (made with crab, scallions, and topped with thinly sliced red/white tuna) was much better, but it still lacked substance.  The sashimi add-on was essentially just cuts of raw salmon, fatty tuna, and albacore without the bed of rice.  Nothing too exciting.

For dessert, we got mochi balls--green tea, cookies &amp; cream, and mango.  Quirky Japanese steakhouse staple that closed out the meal nicely.  We used a Restaurant.com gift cert which our waitress had no problem accepting, even though she disappeared for quite some time before the check arrived.  Apart from that, she was friendly and did her job.

Bread = 3, pretty lackluster
Circuses = 4.5, terrific ambiance (5) and decent service (4)

I feel it&#39;s important to mention that the hot green tea I ordered was not a homebrew, but rather a very unimaginative green tea bag in a cup of hot water with lemon.  Yeah really.  To make matters worse, when I requested a refill, what I got was just more hot water added to my mostly-used teabag.  Uhhhh....what?!?!  Are you guys for serial?  Y&#39;all operate a pretty legit sushi restaurant yet the best you can do is throw a tea packet in some boiling water and slap a lemon on top?  Just for that, management deserves to be (green)teabagged as punishment.  The sentencing 100% fits the crime.

Despite being displeased with half of our food items [and that hot tea biznaz is frankly unacceptable], thanks to the hip decor and variety of sushi rolls I&#39;d still give Shinto another shot."

He spoke with me at length about my issues and really wanted to apply improvements to their customer service going forward. We went back yesterday and it was a 5 star experience. We had hibachi with steak and shrimp. The chef was entertaining and we were very pleased. Branden deserves kudos for his professionalism and our waitress was amazing as well!

I&#39;ve been coming here for years whenever I feel like grabbing sushi.  I like the contemporary decor, and their Americanized fried rolls.  You should ask for off-the-menu rolls.  Their nigiri&#39;s are OK, but obviously this place is more known for rolls.  
I also like their pear martini.

The negatives:
I would rate their wait staff 2 stars.  I also had one of their former hibachi chefs making inappropriate comments while I was on a date.  Considering it&#39;s located in Naperville, you do get a whiff of snobby young kids&#39; judgmental stares.

Verdict: if you can deal with the crowd and you are looking for sushi rolls, you should try this place."

Brittany our server was excellent and very knowledgeable of the menu.  She gave us free dessert for our mishap

We will return again to try the hibachi side of the restaurant  I gave it a 4 star because it is a little pricey"

I came in with my family for my 18th birthday and I wanted to have some hibachi. The wait time was about 5-10 minutes on a Monday so it wasn&#39;t bad at all. We got sat with another birthday party and our waitress showed up a few minutes later. She was very nice and we were assisted greatly! We got soup and salad before our actual entree from the hibachi grill and  they were both very good! When the chef arrived, he was very energetic and played a lot of games with the table. I was fully aware of the ketchup trick from a few years ago and he still managed to scare me with it! The way he made all the food was such a sight to see. When we started eating the food, everything was so yummy and I had such a great feeling consuming the rice and salmon teriyaki.

I&#39;ve never seen the texture involved in what they are calling &#34;spicy tuna rolls&#34;...Seems more like a pate&#39; than anything?

The grill side is very over-priced for what they serve.

That all said, I&#39;ve lived in Naperville for 6 months and have been to Shinto about 5 times and have been served by the bartender Michael G about 3 of those times.

I ordered the &#34;Choice Sushi Combo&#34; which is supposed to include soup, salad, a traditional roll and 10 pieces of nigiri for $22.

I thought OK, I&#39;ll have a roll, 5 pieces of Mauro and 5 pieces of ebi, so I wrote that out on the menu he gave me.

When I came back and told me what I wrote out was double the combo, I told him cut it in half as I didn&#39;t realize it.

He brought the soup, I finished. Where&#39;s my salad? I asked and he was like &#34;I totally forgot that a salad came with the combo&#34;.

Salad came...Soggy and I finished half.

Server came with the sushi and had 2 giant trays with a roll and 20 pieces of nigiri, including 5 pieces of sushi I didn&#39;t order and 5 crab heads!

Kind of an embarrassing sight for a single person sitting at the crowded bar on a Friday night.

I sent it back and said I didn&#39;t order all that sushi and then Michael G came back and insisted &#34;Yeah man, this all yours...It&#39;s what you ordered...You can always take some home&#34;.

My blood boiling, I told myself &#34;just wait for the check before you get pissed&#34;.

Regardless I ate it all without the rice, got the check and found I was charged $30 more than what I told him I ordered.

The $30 wasn&#39;t the issue as much as the principle of the situation, so I left no tip, signed and left a note &#34;You know what I ordered - Former customer&#34;.

Driving by on Route 59, you&#39;d think it&#39;s a bar/lounge/possibly dance club due to the lighting and ambiance being able to look through the windows.  In the middle of the restaurant is this large concaved blue glowing light fixture in the middle of the restaurant which served as the bar.  It was definitely the centerpiece of the whole restaurant. 

While I was patiently waiting for Eric to arrive, I noticed there was almost 3 separate sections: the hibachi bar grill, the bar with the awesome light fixture, and the seating area which looked like it may have been a previous dance floor.  Being seated at a booth, I had ordered a miso soup to warm myself since I had worn a dress and it was pretty chilly outside.  To my liking, it was hot and delicious, just the way I like it! 

Once Eric arrived, we contemplated what we were deciding to eat since there was a wide variety to pick from.  We started off with an appetizer of gyoza, shrimp pot stickers if I recall, and they were ok, nothing out of the ordinary but I was content.  I had made up my mind of the Fire and Ice sushi Roll and Eric has picked out their special for the week: the Biggie Roll.  We were in awe once our plate had arrived.  They had made the rolls onto one plate, making the entree bigger than expected.  Along with Eric&#39;s Biggie Roll, he had ordered a side of sashimi which did not disappoint us. 

Taking a bite of my Fire and Ice roll, I was enamored immediately!  Eric S. seemed to agree, but he was more involved with his sashimi to really care.  Getting around to the Biggie Roll looked like an explosion of so much happening on a roll that I couldn&#39;t comprehend what exactly was on it.  Clearly much larger that the sushi roll I had gotten, the Biggie Roll has so much going on, I couldn&#39;t pick out what ingredients were used.  The taste of it didn&#39;t really tickle my fancy because there were some spiciness, cream cheese, teriyaki chicken, and different sauces that everything tasted weird.  

Although dinner was an interesting experience, I wasn&#39;t going to allow us to leave without trying Mochi Balls!  Eric S had ordered Green Tea (of course), and I ordered cookies and cream along with mango.  I was fascinated with the idea of ice cream like texture stuck in a semi-like liquid medium.  I have to admit, I was pretty amused with them before I chowed down!  The green tea tasted like bubblegum and Eric agreed, however the cookies and cream and mango were definite favorites.  

Overall, this was an amazing experience in ambiance, food, and company!  I would recommend Shinto to friends and family."

We were seated at 6:45 and we weren&#39;t even given our soup and salad until 7:45. It is 8pm and after an hour, the chef is finally here setting up the grill. 

I worked in a restaurant and I understand restaurant delays. But I don&#39;t understand how until 7:55, we didn&#39;t hear a single word of apology from the staff; even then, it was only after we asked. Our server came by our table several times, but only ever asked the other party seated with us if they wanted anything to drink or if they wanted to order anything off the sushi menu. We weren&#39;t even provided refills for our waters, much less a chance to order anything else.

The food must be amazing for this place to stay in business, but from the taste of the soup, it isn&#39;t.

Edit 8:21: the veggies have been served. They are decent, but not outstanding.

Edit 8:30: the steak has been served. i ordered rare and it is actually rare! Very pleasantly surprised. The food is good, but I don&#39;t think it was worth the wait.

Edit 8:45: the manager has comped our desserts to apologize."

I&#39;d most definitely recommend their sushi rolls - the Miso Surprise, The Little Delicious and the Heat Roll being some of my favorites. They also have great hibachi, and excellent maki and nigiri - if you&#39;re into sushi, this is pretty legit for this part of town, or at least so far in my experience! I only took one star down, because it&#39;s almost always way too hectic, way too crazy and way too noisy..."

Me and my wife came on a fri night and for our first time tried sushi, let me first start out by saying the server we had was top of the line, gentelman with glasses i for get his name but he was PASSIONATE for his job  and his knowledge and wisdom was just what the cook ordered.
we started with the drinks i had a bloody mary, my wife also had a drink, i always feel these drinks are a bit pricey, as we continue.so we are ENJOYING our time RELAXING in the techo atmoshphere of the shinto, as a DJ , this music was PERFECT for the setting..a great mix...

the waiter ((brandon)) spent his TIME on really Carring what we wanted to order and made sure we were satisfied and even cared what we thought of EACH PORTION of the dinner..AWESOME....

So we went with the RAINBOW SUSHI me and my wife dont eat shell fish so we had a substitution of that for chicken..WOW  what a experience...were comming back MONDAY for 1/2 off sushi rolls..the waiter explained  how to do the sushi  and even gave us cheaters for the chopp sticks  a very WELCOMED experience..

we each had the chateau briand on the shushi side this time and i will say i will order my steak medium rare next time as it was a little over cooked on medium, we must understand the shushi tables DO NOT cook it like the Habachi  so it will never be as juicy  we ordered a side each of the chicken as well,, that also was a bit harder..the tarriakyi sauce was supurb!!!!

It came with Onion soup and also grilled vegatables,we also opted for the chicken freid rice in that WE DID NOT notice ANY chicken  for 3 bucks  more apiece.. we finished dinner with a bannana  tempura  mouth watering..

the VERDICT:   The food was excellent in taste, quality ONLY because of the steak and chicken being a bit tough was less desireable than last time, and we never got our chicken upgrade for rice   HOWEVER in their defense for the cooking side  that will be a difference in the pan fry to grill on the habachi..
The prices are a BIT steep,   150.00   w/tip    i also felt the portions as so did my wife were smaller this time...the saving throw for this japaneese experience was the SERVER....((brandon)).

I have no doubt as well be comming back ,this lower mark  was because we expected to much from the shushi bar, for the steaks, but aside from all this it was a WONDERFULL experience!!!!!!!!
thank you and again, as we left the restraunt, it felt to me and my wife that the SHinto experince  had now left us  and in our  world, it  was now back to reality...kudos to you Brandon"

I got every single fish they had on the menu (not really). Yellowfin Tuna cooked medium rare, a side of scallops, and the shrimp that comes with the hibachi grill special. This also includes Miso soup and a Ginger salad.

This place has vents that keep you from smelling like Teriyaki sauce for seventeen days after. I cannot wait to be back here!

The reason I would ever dock this place is just the prices. I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO DO IT! Expensive? So what? You&#39;re paying for an experience! I can&#39;t wait until someone does something of substance in my life again so we can celebrate at SHINTO!"

Being the Elite Yelper that I am, I didn&#39;t want to let her down with the restaurant choice. We decided to meet somewhere in the Aurora/Naperville area, and along with my brother, we decided on hibachi at Shinto!

We arrived at the restaurant at 7:25 for our 7:30 reservation. The hibachi side of the restaurant had a few parties, but our group of 5 was seated at our own table.
 
Everyone decided to have hibachi, and actually, four of us ordered the steak and chicken entrée, while my brother had yellowfin tuna and scallops.

Each meal came with house onion soup, a ginger salad, shrimp flambe (2), sautéed vegetables, and white rice (upcharge for chicken fried/brown).

Everyone was extremely satisfied with their meals. My steak was cooked medium rare, and it melted like butter in my mouth! There was nothing bad about the entire meal.

I can&#39;t wait to return. It was the best hibachi experience I&#39;ve ever had (haven&#39;t had too many but in the entire Asian cuisine spectrum, near the top). Highly recommend for any special occasion!"

(Felt a little rushed at the end for no apparent reason other than I think the server was trying to be super efficient).  I haven&#39;t been in a sushi mood in a while so I tried the hibachi here last time. I&#39;ve been several times before for the sushi and always enjoyed it.  Our hibachi chef, Chris, was really cool, kept me and my husband entertained as we were the only guests at our table on this particular evening. Great steak and fried rice- and don&#39;t forget to ask for the egg sauce if you so desire. I didn&#39;t see it mentioned anywhere on the menu, so I had to speak up to get it. Yum-o.

We always have a great time here, whether we&#39;re enjoying sushi, hibachi or martinis at the bar. So, I decided to upgrade my rating. 5 stars for Shinto!"

Apparently, I did it wrong though, I keep reading about how you can save with coupons and other deals... neither of which I came prepared for. The night was a little bit more than I expected, with martini&#39;s costing $10 a piece and most of the sushi rolls being around $15-17.

The place has a clean and trendy atmosphere. The giant hibachi area has color- changing lights, and the sushi side has nice little tables. The clientele was a young 20s crowd, so being there definitely made me feel cool and trendy too! 

It was bustling when we arrived, but we were still able to be seated promptly. Our waiter came to speak with us right away as well, and was very attentive throughout the meal. We ordered the shrimp dumpling appetizer, which was savory and delicious. I thought it was much better on its own, than with the soy sauce it came with. 

For the entree, our helpful server recommended his favorites and popular orders to help us out. We ordered the Naper roll- shrimp tempura, crab salad on top, the Little Delicious- a fried sushi roll, and the Jekyll and Hyde roll- with mango and jalapeño, which were all fantastic. I am no sushi aficionado, but I definitely think it was the best sushi I&#39;ve had. And props to the server for not making me feel like an idiot for needing those chopstick cheaters to eat with. I was going to use a fork until he showed me those! 3 rolls between two people left us extremely full and satisfied. Each roll was 8-12 pieces. 

Their martinis were awesome too- I had the passion martini, which had a pineapple and mango/passion fruit?? I can&#39;t quite remember, but it went down easy and was a nice treat. I would definitely go back again for sushi or to try hibachi, which I&#39;ve never done. I will prepare more next time to save a few dollars though!"

The only questionable part of our night was our server.  She wasn&#39;t very attentive, and upon bringing to her attention the crud floating in my drink and along the glass, she asked if I wanted her to switch my glass. Ew.

My wife and I were seated at 7:40 on Friday night. The restaurant was really not terribly busy considering the time and day ,evident by the numerous empty hibachi tables. By 7:45, six other people had sat down and completed our table. The table adjacent to us must have sat right before us as we got to watch them order, get drinks, get soup, and get salad. By 8:00, everyone at the table began to wonder aloud why we were being actively ignored. I worked as a server and understand delays in service, but if I took more than five minutes to get to a table, I had a manager breathing down my neck. I tried to get the attention of one of staff but they seemed to be intentionally avoiding eye contact with me. Finally, after sitting for longer than half an hour my visibly pregnant, hungry wife and I had had enough. We thought of saying something to a host or manager but at this point, I refused to give Shinto any money. At 8:15, we gathered our coats and left. On the way out, the hostess said, &#34;Bye, thank you,&#34; completely oblivious to what had happened.
I really do not blame the servers. It seemed that none of them were even aware that we needed to be served. I blame the manager. And, in reading the other reviews, it seems like this is a common problem for Shinto. You may have lost my wife and I as customers but maybe if you get your act together, you can prevent this from continuing."

On Mondays, they have their 50% off regular maki rolls priced $12+ if you order a beverage, even if it&#39;s only a pop.  Wasn&#39;t our first time here &amp; definitely won&#39;t be our last, but more than likely, will only be on Mondays for the special since really good sushi is usually pretty expensive when one has  a bottomless pit of a stomach.   

The place is laid out alot nicer than some other hibachi/sushi places. Sushi&#39;s on one side of the restaurant with hibachi on the other.  For the most part, it&#39;s a clean place though we have seen some hand smudges on the walls.  Service is very good with a polite staff.  Between the 3 of us, we ordered 7 different rolls for lunch. The food came out pretty quickly and I don&#39;t remember them all, unfortunately nor what each had on them, but they were all very fresh and tasty. Think some of them were the Spider, Li&#39;l Delicious, Filet, Cap&#39;n Jack, Caterpillar &amp; Rainbow rolls.  My pop was always refilled without asking when it was close to being empty too.  Big plus.    The only negatives I really have on this place are that the plates to eat sushi have a tiny nook/area to hold the soy sauce but it&#39;s too small for the size of most of the rolls for us soy junkies.  Also, I&#39;m a big fountain pop snob.  While they only have Pepsi products (booo, I strongly prefer Coke),  everytime we&#39;ve come here, the pop has been extremely flat.  We&#39;ve mentioned it before but apparently it&#39;s an ongoing problem or they are incapable of fixing it.  I have noticed though that unless it&#39;s a fast food restaurant or of that variety (read: no wait staff), ordering fountain pop is usually a bad idea but alas I have to feed the addiction.      

All in all, service &amp; food quality are very good!  If the walls were just cleaner and the pop wasn&#39;t so flat, I&#39;d probably give this place 4.5 stars...or just don&#39;t order a pop

I haven&#39;t been here in year&#39;s. Sushi was very fresh. I had a shrimp teriyaki platter, shrimp was cooked to perfection.Their fried rice was excellent. Fresh vegetables  mixed with the rice.Not that heavy greasy rice you find in other reastaurants..We had a excellent server, Adrienne. It&#39;s really difficult to find good sushi  reasturant&#39;s  in this area. They offer happy hour specials during the week. Half off on their rolls, drinks, etc..... Parking lot is a bit  of a pain. You can really only exit in one direction."

The hibachi is great and the steak is very tender and juicy. The sushi is a bit on the small side but is very tasty. They are accommodating to your likes and dislikes when it comes to the sushi and willing to removed items or swap them out for something you like. Everything is a tad pricy but the service and taste makes it worth it.

Now this was my first time inside of Shinto and we went there for lunch and upon walking in I was greeted by the hostess who turned around and became our waitress which if fine, sometimes we all have to wear more than one hats. She was very friendly but kind of of air head and that&#39;s ok. whatever I don&#39;t care.
 
So we had our choice of sitting in the sushi area or by the hibachi, we sat down by the hibachi area because I wanted to try it out but we still ordered sushi. But upon walking in there was a weird smell of I don&#39;t really know what it was but it kind of had the smell of dirty mop water, my boyfriend said it was the smell  of the grease from the hibachi but I don&#39;t know about all of that. We were placed at a table all by ourselves (YAAAAHHH) but the first thing that I noticed was the table was greasy and it had crumbs on it. YUCK. This is kind of weird because when we walked thru the door it had an air of snootiness to it like it was better then all other restaurants but it wasn&#39;t.
Anyway the waitress came back to explain things so kudos to her because she knew her stuff and her menu, but she was a complete air head. I ordered the shrimp flambé hibachi and it came with a soup or salad, I ordered the salad but she brought me the soup. DUH!! Then I looked at her like what is this? and she and I quote said &#34;OMG you ordered the salad didn&#39;t you!!&#34;  ummmm yeah I did. lol... well she let me keep the soup which tasted like the Beef flavored Ramen Noodles while she went and got my salad which I didn&#39;t bother eating because it looked gross. I have it to my boyfriend and normally he would eat anything but I guess couldn&#39;t stomach this one because he passed.
So then the hibachi grill master guy came out or whatever you called them and proceeded to make my food. Very nice guy. He did his job but the only thing he knew how to grill was my shrimp. My rice was undercooked but my shrimp and my vegetables were great. So yeah you can make that call for yourself.
Now on to the sushi, I&#39;m not sure how fresh that stuff was but I was not impressed by it at all. I had the Crispy Spicy Tuna roll which wasn&#39;t bad; it was cooked so they couldn&#39;t mess it up. Now as far as the raw sushi, my boyfriend ordered Ika (Squid), Unagi (Eel) and some more stuff that I didn&#39;t try because it looked grossed so I left that to him and his guts. Anyway I never had squid before and I found it to be rubbery and hard, I am not sure if that&#39;s how its suppose to be but my instincts say no so I don&#39;t know and the eel was not bad at all. As far as the other sushi items, my boyfriend was not pleased so I guess it wasn&#39;t good.
Anyway I wasn&#39;t impressed with this place and I don&#39;t think I would be back just because the non cleanliness especially if it specializes in raw foods I need you to be clean.
Side note: Clean your hibachi grills, the pit where you were dumping the scraps had black stuff (which I assume is oil and filth) all along the sides of it and when I chef got done cooking my meal there were still crumps on it which is gross. Now as I am writing this I am grossed out at the thought of what was on it before I placed my order."

To be 100% honest, the service is always slow but they are always polite and it&#39;s usually because they are swamped. This place is always busy and for a good reason too. Quality of sushi is unlike any other, even west coast/east coast sushi places. Lil delicious is without a doubt something everyone has to try, but what made our experience particularly amazing this time was our hibachi chef Chris. He is always so warm and friendly, a real pleasure to talk to while he is preparing your food and the way he prepares it.... I plan on asking for him every time if I can. The steak literally melted in our mouths with the perfect amount of crisp that we expect from a medium well. Cannot say enough good things about this place and I intend to be back here next week!!!"

They have sushi deals on Monday nights, which is awesome for all the sushi lovers!  They have a great collection to choose from as well, a little of everything for everyone.

It does get a bit crowded since its a great deal, so the service might be slow.  Depending on how big of a complainer you are, your waiter might not come by your table as often as you like....so order all your sushi ahead of time before you starve."

Okay, I take that last sentence back partially...the quality of the fish was good, not too fishy, which is very important.  We showed up on a Monday night to find the place fairly busy due to their 50% off rolls.  We were told by the hostess that it would be a 25-30 minute wait for a seat, but allowed us to sit and eat at the bar...there were a lot of seats available at the sushi bar, so I&#39;m not sure why we weren&#39;t offered to sit there.  We ordered a couple of specialty rolls that didn&#39;t really stand out (which is why I can&#39;t even remember the names) and your typical salmon, yellow tail, mackerel, sweet egg, shrimp, and eel sushi.  It took 45 minutes for us to get our food after my husband had to say something to the bartender.  By the time we received our food, the actual seating area was already clearing out, so B.S. on the hostess who quoted such a long wait time. 

Although we were sitting at the bar and didn&#39;t order alcoholic beverages, we didn&#39;t receive refills of water or iced tea, so that turned me off as well as the fact that  those specialty rolls that were supposed to be 50% off were not reflected in the bill.  What is 15 divided by 2?  7.50, not 8.  Fine, it&#39;s a dinky 50 cent difference, but if you&#39;re going to promote 50% off, at least do the math properly.  Yes, silly stuff like that bothers me.  The place came off a bit pretentious to me, but I guess that&#39;s the vibe overall - customers with a ton of blond highlights in their hair, lip injections, and a wonderful orange skin glow from the natural sunshine that the Chicagoland area has enjoyed this past winter!"

It was extremely disappointing.  We usually have wonderful food and service and today our sushi was terrible.  The rolls looked different (we always get the lil delicious and miso surprise) and tasted like they were made yesterday.  We have brought several people here over the years and have rarely had a less than perfect experience but what we got today left me disappointed.

This was a quick pizza dinner with friends and they recommended pizza from this place - I&#39;m glad they did because it was delicious! I cannot really comment on the establishment as a whole but they make a great pie and I&#39;d highly recommend ordering from them if you&#39;re in the area. I mean, Aurelio&#39;s Pizza is still the BEST in Chicago(land), which is second to NYC, but this is a SOLID spot.

I did not (personally) do the ordering, so I don&#39;t know what size we got, but I think their pies run a bit small so make sure you order more than needed - nothing wrong with leftovers if I&#39;m wrong! Also, their time estimate was pretty spot on for pick-up.

We&#39;d certainly order from them again and I&#39;d look forward to dining in to try other items on their menu."

What better idea than pizza!

We had a couple questions about the pizza sauces and the toppings since I have a restricted diet. Our cashier, we think she was new, tried to ask the guy behind her who may have been the manager. Unfortunately, he was too busy leaning in the kitchen window sending texts and didn&#39;t respond to her. She went to the kitchen to ask the cooks instead. While she was gone, the guy or manager finally looked up and asked someone else if they had a question. She let him know the other girl already went in the back to get the answer and he said they need to come to him with questions...

We ordered a thin, double crust with olive oil as the sauce, fresh garlic, and italian sausage with a side of cheese garlic bread. 

We&#39;re told that our total is almost $29! It&#39;s $2.69 / topping... Double crust and fresh garlic are considered toppings... Most places do olive oil and fresh garlic as a sauce, not here.

Once we got our food ordered the manager guy started to yell at someone from the back at the front counter... He said, &#34;I don&#39;t want to see you leaning on that counter. There is literally a camera watching you lean on that counter. Find anything else to do but lean on than counter.&#34; The manager guy went back to leaning in the window and texting...

At this point I was livid! I was going to ask for our money back and just leave. The boy calmed me down and we continue to wait our 30-45 minutes for our pizza. No, we didn&#39;t get deep dish... Luckily, it only took 25 minutes and we were able to get out of there. In that time though, our original cashier who seemed new was taken off the register was watching transactions and it looked like someone else was also being trained. There were 4 cashiers in that small front desk area trying to ring in sales, take call ins, and give take out orders. Meanwhile, the manager looking guy still just leaned in the window and texted...

Moving on to our food... The cheesy garlic bread was fantastic! There was a beautiful butter to garlic ratio that kept the bread from being too greasy, yet the cheese would just pull into strings and make you want to dive in for more! Two thumbs on this one!

The pizza was good, however, they put a ton of olive oil all over it! So much that it seeped through the box! The pizza wasn&#39;t greasy, but it was surely oily! This type of white pizza only needs a little olive oil to coat the crust.

On a good day, the food would get a 4. However, the service and the complete lack of respect from the guy who seemed to be running the place they get a 0! Due to that, we won&#39;t be back! I feel bad for any of the employees who have to deal with that type of management style, do as he says and not as he does. He&#39;s not willing to work, but you better!"

They have a common appetizer there called bruschetta. We have all had it right? Well, we ordered it to kill time due to our order being delayed. And OMG!!! It is a 10+ for sure. I have never had it like this in my life! It was amazing. So I should describe it here but it was just too good for words.

So then we had the deep dish pizza. We have never ordered this here due to our favorite pizza place is elsewhere and is the only place we would ever order it. But we did here this time and wow were we glad we did! This is tied with my number one pizza place now. It was amazing!!!! 

And of course I have written about their desserts before. Each item is the size of your head and the flavor, delivery and presentation is out of this world. We had the chocolate cake and also their cheesecake. So fresh and strong in richness and flavor.

The name of this restaurant does not do it justice. I consider this to be upscale in the atmosphere and food quality.

This is no cheaply made stuff so the approx  $30 price for the largest pie they had was expected.

The pasta is fine, but Barnelli&#39;s has cheaper prices, larger portions, and better selection. I only get pasta from Maciano&#39;s if I&#39;m feeling really lazy. 

The sandwiches and salads I&#39;ve had are nothing special. 

The pizza is bad. The crust is fine, but the cheese has a weird flavor. I&#39;ve tried both deep dish and thin crust, and the funky flavor is more prevalent on the deep dish, probably because it has more cheese.  There are so many good pizza options around that there is no reason to ever order pizza from here. 

There is one thing they do well, and that is the breadsticks. They&#39;re garlicky and buttery and addictive. 

The takeaway: unless you have a craving for breadsticks, you can do better than Maciano&#39;s."

Today I was told I couldn&#39;t order any pizza smaller than a 12&#34; over the phone.  Really?  Funny because I&#39;ve done this many times!?  Even when I told her she just lost my business and I&#39;ll order elsewhere... All she said was sorry.  

It&#39;s a bummer since you are so close. 
Back to Lou Malnati&#39;s for my pizzas."

After a very long day at the office, I decided to take my son out for his favorite kind of food. Actually, that&#39;s not true - I needed to pig out on some carbs after the kind of day I had. We were headed to another place in Winfield when I remembered passing by Maciano&#39;s one day on the way to the Smokehouse BBQ. So we decided to try it. 

We were greeted with a big smile, almost immediately, by Dylan, who ended up also being our server. The interior of this place is small, but really well done. Large booths, hi top tables and regular tables with a great color scheme and atmosphere.

As soon as we were seated, I found out about the travesty of no martinis - but it was half price bottles of wine night. I can handle that. 

The menu is easy to read, offerings range from appetizers to sandwiches to pasta to pizza - but it wasn&#39;t overwhelming. And the prices - for handmade/homemade  pasta? Amazing.

Of course since I am writing this after my carb crash and wine, I can&#39;t remember what the dishes were specifically called. But I had the penne pasta with Italian sausage and vodka sauce. I confirmed with Dylan before ordering that it had a bit of a kick, and it sure did. I loved it. My son had the tortellini and vodka sauce. He doesn&#39;t eat much, but he also enjoyed his. Presentation was fabulous. Simple, but elegant.

Desserts are usually never consumed when we go out because they cost more than a martini. These were reasonable. Tiramisu and a giant ghirardelli brownie - both under $4 each. Delicious.

The best part was the service. Anyone who has followed me on here for any amount of time knows how anal retentive I am about the service. Dylan was amazing - checked back appropriately, smiled a ton, super pleasant and straight up wonderful. His recommendations were spot on and next time we go back we will ask to be in his section.

Summary? Affordable authentic and delicious Italian restaurants around here are not easy to find. Go try this place, ask for Dylan, and have such a good meal that you forget about the crappy day you just had. Thank you Dylan!"

I&#39;ve always ordered their pizza and a few different appetizers. I have to say that the pizza is just meh, nothing special. Last night the boyfriend and I wanted something different and something that could be delivered to us. I pull out our delivery menu and we decided on Macianos. I ordered the breaded scallops with pasta and my bf got their seafood dish, mussels, shrimp and scallops over linguini. It was very nice and convenient to order on line and to be able to track my food with their online gps where&#39;s my order feature. It was also nice to use the free delivery and 2 liter Coke coupon. It was also nice that my food was delivered quickly and it was still hot. What wasn&#39;t so nice was the food itself. My dish was 15.99 and after I ate my pasta I was still hungry. The portion was extremely small for the price. The scallops were so tiny they must have been cut in half and my garlic bread was burnt. My boyfriend did not even finish his dish because it was so salty. We were extremely disappointed in the quality of our food. Our meals were not cheap yet they were awful! We will not be ordering from them any time soon, if we do it would just be for the meh pizza cause it&#39;s close by. Do not try their seafood dishes!"

Ordered fettuccine alfredo with chicken - there was no chicken, the noodles were not cooked and the alfredo sauce was soupy.  Ordered angel hair pasta with meat sauce, there was barely any sauce, it was watered down and the meat sauce was sausage. Lastly ordered a caprese salad, which included 3 tiny pieces of mozzarella and 3 slices of tomatoes. I could have made all of that food, plus some, that would have been much better and much cheaper.

I heard good things about this place and we finally went today for dinner.  It was a Monday night and the place was pretty empty.  It took a while for our server to greet us and even longer to take our order.  Our order was simple - pizza and a salad.  

It took 45 minutes to get our food and our server didn&#39;t even check on us to explain why it was taking so long.  When we questioned what took so long, the manager (who also happened to be our server) was not very helpful (he was defensive).  We asked to talk to another manager and he said that would take about 20 minutes for the other manager to talk with us.  The other manager never came by.  That was the last we saw him the rest of the night.  We had to ask for boxes and our check from a different server.  We dine out a lot and this was by far the worst service and management we have experienced."

My husband and I got there early (just before 5pm) on a Friday afternoon.  The dining room is small but very nicely decorated.  There are about 5 very large,  can seat about 6 people booths.  There are regular tables and 2 high-top tables.  My 5-star rating started when the server brought out the small, very crusty and WARM bread.  Wonderful!  There was olive oil, parmesan cheese and she asked if we also wanted butter for the bread. Yes, please.

The dinners are all ala carte. Husband had the torellini ala vodka and I had the side salad with creamy garlic dressing and an order of garlic bread with mozzarella cheese.   I believe it must have been sitting in the kitchen because the mozarella was not hot and stringy like it should have been if it was just made.  It still tasted good. My husband liked his pasta and there was enough leftovers for another meal the next day.

Our server was very good and properly attentive.  The manager came around and asked how everything was. Nice touch.

The dining room was nice because for once, there were no blaring TV&#39;s.  They had nice Italian, like Dean Martin type, music going.  It was truly an atmosphere to relax and enjoy the company that you came with.

If you join their e-club they will send you a coupon for 15% off.  I look forward to returning and trying their  pizza."

The first time we came we ordered a ton of food cause we wanted to try it all.  We got the small pizza and I got a frutti del mar and wifey got the pasta arrabiatta.  Daughter got the spaghetti kids meal.  

So first off, they only have fries for the kids meal.  Or bread.  I asked for veggies like brocolli or something and they gave us a salad.  With onions.  For a 20 month old.  Well she ate the tomato (the one slice of tomato) and I ate the rest.  I think if you have a kids menu you should be looking out for some healthy options.  Even McD is trying to do this now.  So hopefully Maciano&#39;s will consider something other than fries.  They give a coloring menu with some crayons so that keeps my daughter busy.

The floors are a laminate and it&#39;s very slippery.  It&#39;s kinda fun sliding across on your chair, but also potentially dangerous.  We went around 5pm and got in before the rush on a weekend night.  Around 6pm there was some crazy line.  At one point they had a big group coming and set all the tables together, but then they separated them and started seating people.  It kinda made me think of that game Diner Dash.  It&#39;s a pretty intimate setting.  When I see the building from the outside it seems like the kitchen is 3x as large as the seating area, but that&#39;s just what it seems anyway.

We&#39;ve been here a couple more times and enjoy it.  If you sign up for their email list you get a coupon.  And they send other coupons pretty regularly."

It&#39;s a pretty casual place, and I appreciated the decor, particularly the warm colors of the restroom. The service was somewhat inattentive, but not unbearably so. It took a long time for our bread to be served, so that it came only a couple minutes before our dinner. 

We ordered eggplant rolls (appetizer), a calzone with pepperoni, and a kiddie pizza with sausage. I wouldn&#39;t recommend the eggplant rolls...they had an overly sweet, super parmesany taste I wasn&#39;t expecting. I love ricotta, so I&#39;d have liked more of that. The calzone and kiddie pizza were both good, though neither very memorable.

I waited to review until I ate there a few times.  Sometimes you just have a bad experience, but it was just a fluke.  This is no fluke.  Service was terrible. A tiny dining room, but the waitresses are all over the place, instead of working zones I feel it was a, &#34;Who wants this table&#34; experience.  That means my waitress has to help one table on the opposite side, and when it is packed she can&#39;t check easily.  2 times that I dined in, I went 10 to 15 minutes with an empty glass of beer. The food is OK.  I mean am I going to announce to the world that it is awesome?  No. It&#39;s just OK. The thing I am most surprised about though is the cost.  For a family of 4 and 2 beers bought, my ticket was almost $70. Oh don&#39;t worry, my wife bought their best coupon...$1 off. The calzone I ate was so greasy I felt nauseous the rest of the evening.  Their marinara is completely tasteless if you remove the crazy amount of garlic that was in it.  All in all, I&#39;m done with the place.  With the prices, service, and overall quality of food, I give it another year before it is shut down and the owners are left wondering what happened."

Do we want to order something else she asked?  Sandwiches to go?  We left the restaurant as empty as we had found it and hungrier than ever.

We have had better pasta at olive garden. We probably won&#39;t be dining back there again, we almost did but then we sat there debating it for 30mins and chose to eat elsewhere.

We have eaten here before and enjoyed it. The Tortellini in Vodka Sauce is very nice but if you dont like onions it may not be your best choice. My wife cant do onions very well but this was the second time she ordered it! Its good. 

I had the Lasagna. It was very watery. Like the sauce was very thin and needed to be cooked down to reduce it. They need more meat in the stuffing and the ricotta cheese was bland and needed some seasoning. As you cut into it would just slide apart. Good lasagna should stand on its own. You need to drain the ricotta and have a flavorful binder like egg and or Pecorino Sardo. Mascarpone is a great ad too but you need to flavor it . Just my thoughts on that one! 

Our dinner partner had  Penne Broccoli Olive oil, garlic and broccoli florets. When it came to the table the first time it was completely submerged in water and oil. The pasta  and or the broccoli was not drained well and she sent it back. It should just be coated in oil that has had fresh garlic sauteed in it for about a minute not swimming in pasta water. The second time was the same. All they had to do was drain it and toss it in some garlic oil.

All in all it is a nice place the service was slow. Have not had the pizza yet but it looks like they do a good carry out business. Give it a shot!"

With the discount, and the decent reviews, I decided to place an order for delivery.

The prices aren&#39;t cheap. For two pizzas and an appetizer the total was $40+... with tip and delivery charge, it was damn near $50. 

Don&#39;t get me started on delivery charges plus the expectation of a tip....I&#39;m not a cheapskate and, in fact, worked as a pizza delivery boy back in the day...so I get it. What bothers me is these &#39;below the line&#39; charges. Almost like my cell phone company....the price is $X per month but then there&#39;s half a dozen random charges to bump up their profit. Just charge me extra for the pizza to cover your costs and stop nickel and diming me. But I digress.

Here&#39;s the real reason for the one star rating. They called me 20 minutes after I placed the order online to say that the side of ranch I had requested is going to be extra. Really? I paid $50 for two 12&#34; pizza and basket of fried crap and you want another 25 cents for some ranch freakin&#39; dressing? Surely some of that $3 delivery charge would cover my request for some sauce. Nope, the guy wouldn&#39;t budge.  He wanted his quarter or no deal.

I was a little miffed so I told him to cancel the entire order...he sounded confused but acknowledged. I went and got food elsewhere....but then about an hour later, the food from Maciano&#39;s showed up at my doorstep anyway....despite the fact the order was canceled. Oh, and the extra ranch was there...and they took it upon themselves to add it to my bill.

This is Chicago. Good pizza places are abundant. I shall take my business somewhere better."

When dining out our time is valuable,  our hard earned money will be spent knowing the restaurant value their diners and we will reward good service. Friday night apparently brings many carry out patrons and Maciano&#39;s does nothing to differentiate between diners and pickups. Ten minutes of our time awaiting to be acknowledged. Our table was a small rectangle that barely fit our bread, wine &amp; dinners in addition to I had to ask our waitress for something to keep the table from wobbling: she brought a leather bound wine list and that did the trick; that is how much table was off( ask for a booth). One of our two dinners was delicious Penne Vita Mia but I had ordered angel hair pomodoro with one of the more expensive add ons chicken. While our dinners were served piping hot and smelling amazing I found myself searching for chicken. When I did find it I was dismayed to discover that the restaurant had taken the liberties to add chopped cooked chicken ( I presume used for their menu item chopped salad) and threw it in my dish. I felt if I had ordered any other of the add ons they would not be pre cooked nor chopped and yet I had spent $3. I asked the waitress and she apologized and offered dessert but again being the new year and resolutions we declined... As a diner must we ask detailed questions to ensure we get the meal we are expecting and paying for? I don&#39;t want to become one of those pompous patrons that ask dozens of questions in order to get the meal of choice ( and not knowing how staff will react to your questions ...). This restaurant is a bit pricey for Italian and our expectation must be VALUE &amp; to be VALUED and in this case they FAILED!"

Maciano&#39;s was really quite good. Thin, crispy crust, flavorful sauce, ample toppings (this is key for me) and lots o&#39; cheese. Overall, the whole fam liked the pizza and it was devoured in no time at all.
We also ordered the tiramisu, which was not good. Don&#39;t order that. Also, the phone order girl seemed super confused, hence my 4 star review. The delivery was speedy though.

Ordered take-out for office at 10:45am for 11:30 pick-up.  Had to wait for food until 11:45 and the staff seemed totally disorganized even though there was only one table of people eating in.  Woman after me asked what the soup was today - the counter person disappeared into the kitchen and never came back leaving counter unattended for at least 5 min as a line of customers began to form.  Took a second guy several minutes to find out the soup - nobody in the kitchen knew.  Lots of staff yet most seem unprepared and under-utilized.

Food seems pretty good but if I can&#39;t get it out the door or I miss my lunch hour because they&#39;re too slow - forget it.  Maybe I&#39;ll try again in 6 months if they&#39;re still in business."

My wife and I both had calzones. They were outstanding. Marinara comes on the side which is a bonus for me since I find some calzones become a soggy mess when the sauce settles at the bottom. My wife also had the fried ravioli appetizer and I had the stuffed mushrooms. Ravioli was cooked well, not greedy or over fried. The stuffed mushroom were the highlight of the whole dinner. The caps are stuffed with Italian sausage and spinach and drizzled with a perfect blend of garlic and olive oil. Overall our first experience was great. Can&#39;t wait to try more items."

Daughter got the classic calzone which she liked very much. Food was great, environment is open and airy. This was our second trip there. On first trip manager (who is very nice) gave us a sample of a white wine which my wife really enjoyed, and ordered on our second trip there. You also get hot bread at the table but need to request butter (they have olive oil on all the tables).

The bartender who was friendly and took care of you has since moved on and it&#39;s just not as inviting anymore.  Some of the menu items are still solid but some just are average at best.  I also think the people that work there are not as friendly as they could be.

The grilled octopus was a tasty, healthy alternative, but why kid myself...fried is the way to go. Glad to see things have progressed, as their proximity to home makes them an immediate go-to.

The food was decent and our server did a fine job, but the place lacks a personality that was noticeable to all in our group.

The food was actually better than I thought it was going to be based on how the place just felt to me.  My fish tacos were quite tasty and my friend went with the BBQ chicken Flatbread at our server&#39;s suggestion and, while a little overwhelming with the BBQ flavor, was a large portion that was certainly shareable.  The salads were also quite good.

It wasn&#39;t busy on the night we were there so I was also a bit surprised it took so long for the drinks to come up.  But our server, Elisabeta, was great, apologizing for the delay and making sure our food came up quickly. 

The prices are reasonable and there is plenty of parking.  I just wish it felt more like the neighborhood place it looks to be from the outside."

There weren&#39;t many patrons on a Saturday night, but I think the location is part of the reason. 

We ordered the spinach artichoke dip, mushroom &amp; truffle pizza, shrimp and spinach flat bread &amp; the kale salad. 

The spinach and artichoke dip was the highlight of the night. Creamy, flavorful &amp; exactly what we hoped for. Really, it is a must try. The kale salad wasn&#39;t bad I guess but it wasn&#39;t a kale salad - it was a spring mix with pieces of kale throughout... not exactly what my co-diner was looking for. That said, he said the salad was still good. 
Now, I was really excited for the mushroom truffle pizza. That was not up to par either. The pizza was dry &amp; there was not a bit of flavor on it. Seriously, when you say truffle, you expect that flavor &amp; that was not accomplished here. The flat bread was eh as well, nothing to write home (or to Yelp) about. 

When we were leaving we ran into a group of people who had just left because they kitchen was closed. CLOSED. On a Saturday night at around 9:30? Who does that?! Hopefully, they were just getting their bearings due to them recently opening. We will give them one more shot &amp; hope our experience is better."

Even the kids menu was AMAZING. I would have eaten the chicken fingers-so tasty-not dry at all and very good breading. Mac and cheese was beautiful.

Of particular note is the french onion soup, the burgers, and the flatbreads, which are all spectacular.  The steak chopped salad is also as good as it gets.

* We visited over lunch, and the place was quite chilly.  Maybe because they&#39;d just opened at 11 and once the pizza oven&#39;s been going a while it gets better.

* Only one beer on tap (Stella).  I&#39;m a bit surprised the beer selection doesn&#39;t include more drafts.  Their bottle selection is decent, however, so this mitigates that somewhat.  But getting some more taps would be a big bonus.

It is a little tucked away from the main streets but well worth it. Their pizzas are fantastic very fresh tasting and a great selection. The steaks are perfectly grilled, tender and high quality.
The atmosphere is very inviting don&#39;t let the exterior or the location fool you. Can&#39;t wait for football season to start and catch some games in their bar area. Great food, atmosphere and great micro beer selections."

Playing it safe in the beginning, we chose the spinach artichoke dip. Most places do a horrible job with this dip, but not this place. Gooey cheese, chunks of fresh artichoke &amp; spinach, toasted pita bread alongside....damn it was tasty! 

Next up was my fish &amp; chips. Its really, really hard to do it properly in my opinion.  Honestly, I&#39;ve only found two places in the Chicagoland area that does it proper. Now its three places. Once again, these guys surprised the hell out of me. Flaky cod, crispy breading, neither of them separating from each other as I tore into the filets with my fork . Tartar sauce or spicy remoulade on the side....awesome.

Wifey had the jalepeno burger. After the quiet moaning after her first few bites, I took her other half. Cooked perfectly to medium, it was a solid, pure tasting burger. Nothing fancy, just memorable.  

As we were getting up to leave, the Manager thanked us for coming &amp; informed us that the dry run was to &#34;work out the kinks before the Grand Opening.&#34;

There were kinks? Not on my end, Mr. Manager dude....but thank you for being humble. :)

Price point for the quality &amp; portion size is kinda perplexing to be honest. Again, well worth the trek from the city. The residents, commuters &amp; visitors of the Willowbrook are lucky. 

GO HERE... EAT GREAT FOOD... PAY LITTLE MONEY....WORD."

I got the steak sandwich, and I did really enjoy it. I just enjoyed my parent&#39;s cheese pizza better. It sounded much worse to me than it tasted. I don&#39;t even like plain cheese pizza normally, and then they said it doesn&#39;t have sauce and it really didn&#39;t sound great. It was amazing, and I wish I&#39;d ordered that. Please don&#39;t think I&#39;m saying don&#39;t order the steak sandwich, it was really very good (and huge). I just LIKED the sandwich, I LOVED the pizza.

It&#39;s close to where we live and this is the third place to go into this somewhat awkward location in the past 5 or so years. My biggest complaint is again similar to the two prior establishments (are they all owned or managed by the same people?!), food is quite good but service and execution are downright poor. We ate here on a Thurs evening around 6:30 or 7pm. Restaurant section was fairly empty, only 1 other table. They have brightened up the place with light paint and some stock paintings (previous Italian place was way too dark). Fine for a pub and grill. We were seated promptly. Waitress came over to take our drink order. Nice, extensive beer menu but the beers are not described on the menu so we asked our server about one. She said, &#34;Yeah, I don&#39;t know much about beer.&#34; That&#39;s it, no offer to get us any info or otherwise help us? So I got my goto drink, a whiskey sour (again, for a &#34;bar and grill&#34; was surprised she didn&#39;t ask if I had a whiskey preference), and my husband ordered a bottle of hard cider. We ordered an appetizer of the buffalo wings (menu offers wings appetizer in buffalo, bbq or sweet spicy Thai). Waitress asked what kind of wings we wanted, we repeated buffalo. Yet again she asked what kind of wings we wanted and I said again buffalo. A third time she asked and this time I told her I didn&#39;t know what she&#39;s asking us since we keep saying buffalo is the style of wings we wanted and then listed the menu options for her. She looked at us a little blankly and then smiled saying she thought all wings were called buffalo. Okay.... So my husband ordered the steak cobb salad and I ordered the bayou shrimp pasta. After ordering we noticed a specials board on the other side of the room and wished the server would&#39;ve mentioned them since they sounded very good. Waited quite a long time for our food, no bread, no water refills, no one came to check on us (remember restaurant was pretty empty so no excuse for this really). Finally after about 25 min our entrees arrived. We were confused because our appetizer never showed up. Waitress said the kitchen screwed up and the wings would be out in a few minutes. We said we didn&#39;t want to eat the wings after our main dish and she said &#34;ok&#34; and started taking our entrees off the table! I said what are you doing and she said &#34;they&#39;ll put these back in the pan while you eat your wings&#34;. We said no, she should leave our meals for us to eat while they are hot and fresh and she should cancel the wing order! She frowned and put our plates back on the table. We then proceeded to eat our meals, which were quite good! Steak cobb salad was ample and had myriad fresh ingredients. My pasta dish was mildly spicy with a nice cream sauce and perfectly cooked shrimp. While eating our waitress and another staffer sat down at a table in the dining room and just kind of stared at us for the duration of the meal. Again, no one came over to refill water or ask us how the food was. So as much as we really wanted to like this place and as good as our entrees were our horrible service experience means we won&#39;t be back.....I guess until the restaurant changes over again. Too bad...."

off with the special French onion soup, not too salty, light sherry taste and plenty of cheese.   I loved the spinach artichoke dip served with toasted pita bread which was crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside- just perfect as far as I&#39;m concerned, there was plenty of this appetizer to serve four easily.  I had the jambalaya which had plenty of shrimp, chicken and andouille sausage and packed some serious heat.  The portions are huge.  The creamy bayou shrimp pasta also was spicey but well flavored.   This restaurant is on the former Luciano&#39;s Italian restaurant.  Interior has been updated, heavy drapes and poor lighting have all been removed.

Baritone Brian ( as we called him ) functioned both as our bartender and server, and not only was he super attentive - he made some mean drinks! My wife enjoyed his sidecars, while I was more in a beer mood, taking in a Dirty Bastard Two Brother Lagunitas, Krombacher, and Metro Afterburner!

The food was better than the drinks. French fries have a meaty body with amazing flavor and perfect texture. I&#39;m really picky on the coleslaw, but must say I gave this one a 7 out of 10. The ribs we ordered looked skimpy at first glance, but wow were they amazing in both flavor and texture - so tender you could easily pull them apart. The most awesome appetizer I&#39;ve ever had was here and they are called Southwest Sticks. These are more like gigantic eggrolls, stuffed with chicken and a host of other ingredients. Truly unique! I highly recommend you try this if you go here. The jambalaya was a perfect 10 - I could not believe the generous portions of shrimp, chicken, and sausage."

My wife had the French martini and thoroughly enjoyed it. We ordered the Reuben and Buffalo chicken sandwich both were nice portions and came with delicious hand cut fries and coleslaw. 

The reason we gave them an overall 4 was due to the prices seeming relatively high for the food and given they brand themselves a pub, not having any beer on tap was a letdown.

The pork chop is savory and super juicy cooked to perfection. The sides a great, the yams are so good you put them in your mouth and you involuntarily smile:) Great food, simple decor, just like poppin in to Granny&#39;s for dinner!!!!"

New Review::
I have to change my rating to a 3, mainly because I don&#39;t like how the Taco Bell half operates. They have limited amount of sauce you can pick up..&amp;&amp; They make your Spicy Buffalo Chicken Grillers with the shredded chicken instead of the regular chicken that all the other Taco Bells used. When asked to change it, they told me it would cost extra! Since when does it cost extra to substitute the meat/beans? Its always been free.


Previous Review::
Decent place to eat at. Dining room is moderately clean and their service is half fast. Not the quickest taco bell, but they are accurate with your order. Nice people, just have patience if you go in the drive thru"

Cashier ran away from counter to the back of the restaurant when it was my turn. Did not excuse herself. The drive through cashier just stood there and did not help take orders. I stood at the register for another 3 minutes before I was helped. 

I&#39;ve walked out of the restaurant 2 since I moved to this neighborhood. I love Taco Bell, but will not be going back to this location.

grabbed lunch today and ordered a nacho bell grande meal. the taco was good but nachos literally tasted like vomit to me, my girlfriend described it as tasting like &#34;chemicals&#34;. either way, it was completely un-edible and had to be thrown away. 

i don&#39;t know if someone maliciously doctored the food or what but it sure as hell tasted like it. on top of all this they don&#39;t even have a working phone number. hopefully i don&#39;t die from whatever i just ate.

This place is exactly what we were looking for. Simple food, nice people and prices you don&#39;t normally see around the Naperville area. For breakfast I had the Mexican Skillet and a bowl of their chicken and rice soup. Both were very enjoyable. My wife had the biscuits and gravy special. She also enjoyed this.

However, we picked the wrong time to go. They are currently doing construction on the runways and there were no incoming or outgoing flights. So that was a bummer. I was hoping that an amazing meal would compensate for the lack of scenery. However, I was disappointed in the food. I ordered the blueberry crepes and they were so soggy. The blueberries were mostly on top but the actual crepe didn&#39;t really have any filling, just a few scattered blueberries were used as a filling. I also tried some of my mom&#39;s omelette and it was mediocre at best. My mom insisted she was fine with her breakfast but she had a lot of her omelette left over and she hardly touched her hash browns which looked like they should have been cooked about 5 minutes longer. The waitress who was friendly and attentive, offered to take off the cost of the crepes from the bill after she noticed that I didn&#39;t eat much. That was appreciated. I do plan to give Charlie&#39;s another try after the construction is completed. I&#39;m hopeful we will see lots of activity on the runways and have a better meal the 2nd time around!"

Yes, finding this place can be rather confusing....it&#39;s actually located at the Bolingbrook airport, not necessarily behid a strip mall. 

If I gave stars based on the setting, this would be a 5 star place: love the fact that it has a great view of the Bolingbrook Airport runway, and the restaurant itself is peaceful and clean.

The food and service, however, have much to be desired.

I ordered the biscuits &amp; gravy, the gravy was ok, but the buscuits were obviously microwaved (rubbery texture gives it away) and they were VERY small. My colleague ordered a waffle, and although decent sized, it looked like a previously frozen toaster waffle. Our waitress was very chatty about herself, a lot of uneducated T.M.I....even unknowingly (mildly) offended my colleague in the course of conversation....and she knew nothing about the airport which the cafe is located on. Her bright green nail polish made the service &amp; food even less appetizing. Yikes.

I&#39;m sure the locals love it, but we will not be back. Cracker Barrel is just a short drive away!"

This place is hidden away in a steel sided building and hardly looks like much at all. Inside is full of wooden tables and chairs, a large counter for coffee or eating and there is even an old fashioned pilot statue. 

The window tables are just a few feet away from where the little Cessna&#39;s park and just a little past that is the runway so you can see all the planes going up and down. The little man of the group could not have been more excited! 

We all ordered breakfast and from what I could tell all the breakfast menu items were under 10$. The kid&#39;s meal we ordered consisted of two normal sized chocolate chip pancakes and a kid&#39;s juice for about 5 bucks. Not bad at all and they were delicious as well! For five of us to eat with a few drinks only cost 43$. I think the only thing holding me back from 5 stars were the portion sizes, which could have been just a little bigger.

We even had the added bonus of watching someone training to become a helicopter pilot take off and hover. We will for sure be here again. The staff and guests were all friendly, the restaurant was cool and clean, and we got to watch planes! So much better than Denny&#39;s."

I ordered a Denver omelet and it came with hash browns and toast or pancakes. It was delicious and cooked perfectly ($6.95). Our waitress was the best part of the meal. She was friendly, caring, funny and kept the coffee coming. I wish I knew her name to include in my review.

Charlie&#39;s is like a truckstop diner, except for small plane pilots.

The dining room is adorned with plane-themed memorabilia as well as pictures of restaurant regulars with their aircrafts.  Tables were clean as well as the restrooms.  

The food is nothing fancy, just basic breakfast / lunch fare. Steak and eggs were done perfectly, omeletes were fluffy, and home fries were tasty.  Simple food and simply executed at a reasonable price.  Staff was friendly too and I think my dad said they were daughters of the owner.

Can&#39;t give it more than three stars, because while the food was exactly what we expected, it was still mainly cold-cut sandwiches and breakfast offerings.   My daughter and I went for lunch.  She had a Bella focaccia (ham, turkey, cheese, roasted red peppers on tomato focaccia) with chips, I had a turkey club with fries.  Both sandwiches were fresh deli meat, and quite tasty.  I ordered my fries extra crispy, and was very happy when they came out perfect and crunchy.  Iced tea was brewed, not the nasty stuff from syrup (blech). Overall bill was a little over $21, and I think we ordered two of the more expensive offerings on the menu.  

As others have mentioned, it was fun watching the activity at the airport, and the large windows made the place feel very open and sunny.  I enjoyed watching a little boy at a different table watching the airplanes with his parents and grandparents, and it would be a great place to go with little ones.

These blue points are the best buy in town, at just $9 per dozen.  I always have the Baked French Onion soup, which is excellent.  Dark onions topped with a crouton and a thick slab of melty browned Gruyere covering the bowl. For their outstanding burgers, you need to bring a BIG appetite, because that&#39;s how they come...BIG.
My only gripe is they won&#39;t serve their crispy onion strings as a side- only on the dishes where they&#39;re listed. Not sure why; they would get big business from me.

Country House is a local place with many regulars.  The bartenders are very friendly and welcoming. I like the peanuts at the bar. As other reviews stated, the bar is crowded and it is not always easy to get a seat.

I heard Country House was known for its burgers but we were disappointed both times. Both times, the roll did not seem fresh. I suppose the burger was fresh but it had no flavor and seemed like it was frozen.

The atmosphere is nice, cozy and friendly. We live nearby and will try Country House as we would like a regular place. We are hoping the food can match the friendly service and  atmosphere."

She loved the one at Lisle and insisted to have the birthday dinner here. Surprisingly it was quite crowed at 6pm. We had to wait for about half hour for a table for 5 of us.

Everything seemed sped up once we were seated. I started with one dozen oysters which were on promotion for 69 cents each. My son got the country burger. my daughter went for the beloved hot dog. I order the special Spinach egg drop soup and the duck tender for her. Hubby got the french onion soup. Wanted to have the steak nacho but was told that is only at Lisle. However, I think he was eating more peanuts than anything else.

Everything tasted great. I quickly ordered the second dozen oysters which were the last dozen per our waitress. Mom finished the soup and some duck tenders as the rest of duck tenders were cleared by my son. 

The services were great. Out waitress was warm and friendly. Even the bus boy was quite chatty with us.The whole family was pretty content."

This was my first time visiting this location.  I was surprised at how small the inside is, as far as number of tables in the dining room.  But it is a real nice, cozy atmosphere.

Our server was excellent.  She offered suggestions from the menu, knew the specials of the day and did everything right for us.

I ordered the Hamburger Special of the week - garlic burger.  It was a burger basted in garlic butter and served open face on a garlic roll.  

I appreciated that our food was served to us hot.  I could tell that the fries had just come out of the fryer because they were almost too hot to eat.  The hamburger was hot also and cooked to my requested medium.  

Loved the coleslaw.

Nice job, Clarendon Hills Country House.  We will come back."

Every time I drive by (which is five days a week), it is packed.  I tried going once and they said a 35 minute wait.  So I finally stopped by at like 5:30 on a Wednesday and it was ONLY a 25 minute wait (which was accurate).  The bar was packed and they could do a better job of getting peanuts to everyone as opposed to only those sitting at the bar but the ladies behind the bar got to us relatively quickly for some drinks while we waited.  I love the ambiance and they have a dining rewards program.  I will say our server was really, really good.  I wish I had gotten her name.  No, I did not see any indication of anything haunted.  

We started with the duck fingers and I have to say, these weren&#39;t that good.  I was let down given the Yelp! reviews on these.  You couldn&#39;t tell it was duck and they were dry.  I love duck so I would have liked that duck flavor.  It could have been chicken, for all I knew.  We also tried the ostrich burger, which was solid.  I absolutely love ostrich and this did not disappoint but didn&#39;t blow me away either.  The bun was very good but there was a tad too much of it ratio-wise.  The fries that came with were decent but again, nothing that was revolutionary."

Four of us came here tonight for a friend&#39;s birthday..having heard and read good things from fellow Yelpers. We were greeted and sat quickly only to be approached by a flustered, sourpuss blonde waitress. Despite our best efforts to be kind, she fussed over the surrounding tables..while breezing right by us. Having been given an iced tea with a brown, spoiled lemon and waiting patiently for pop refills, a single finger was raised and an extremely polite, &#34;Excuse me&#34; to catch her as she was near resulted in our waitress spinning around and leaning forward, WAVING her finger in our faces while LOUDLY snapping, &#34;I&#39;M WAITING ON THIS TABLE RIGHT NOW SO YOU&#39;LL HAVE TO WAIT AND *THEN*  I&#39;LL GET TO YOU!&#34; 

*AHEM* 

I can only equate this to the reprimand a mother gives a nagging child that has repeatedly tugged on her apron. Not only was this embarrassing... it was the height of unprofessionalism. We sat flabbergasted and everyone felt uncomfortable for not only were we being eyed by curious patrons, but this dampened our birthday spirits. It is the single rudest encounter I have experienced from a server. Honestly, words cannot even relate the b*tchiness. I got up and sought out the manager to ask for the appetizer check..only to have my waitress brush past me hurriedly..making physical  contact without so much as a &#34;pardon me&#34;. 

The manager is the sole reason I did not leave the establishment. Although I paid for all four burgers and beverages ($82 plus tip) this delightful woman comped our 2 appetizers and apologized profusely...even treating for dessert with candles. The most impressive part was that this lovely lady pinned up her gorgeous, long locks and waited our table PERSONALLY. Burgers were truly great (I had Bison) as were the duck strips, onion rings and poppers. So a heartfelt thank you to this dear young lady for salvaging the evening. She was patient, joyful, and sincere in every way possible. These stars are for her....a pleasure in contrast to the giant pain in the a**. 
Bummer. I won&#39;t be returning."

There was only a five minute wait, so that was good. The entire atmosphere is very inviting and cozy. I really liked that.
The food, on the other hand, was just boring. The split pea soup was super salty. No flavor, just salt. The cheese sticks were run-of-the-mill. The burgers lacked flavor, too. There was nothing , food wise, that differentiated it from any other restaurant around. I was bummed. It was our first and last time there. Everything else seemed so nice.

Had pretzel crusted wall-eye that was delicious! One of only a handful of bar-food joints that have a baked potato at lunch as one of their sides and it&#39;s fluffy and yummy from the skin to the center. Have been coming here for as long as I can remember and it just gets better! With a wide variety menu, it&#39;s easy and tasty to have a fresh meal. The side salad is bountiful and the blue cheese dressing is one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. Good beer selection, decent wine list, scrumptious NY cheesecake.

Finding ourselves without the kids for once, we stopped in for a burger.

I would give this place four stars for food and two stars for service - saved from one only by the excellent bartender.  We literally came in and were standing in the middle of the place for at least five minutes with no one seating us or even asking us to put a name in.  I do not like having people stare at me - especially when I am starving.  So, I was ready to walk, but the husband, trying to salvage the rare time when I actually said I wanted a burger, tells me to just sit at the bar.

From there, things were fine.  We ordered some beer/cider and I got the Top Drawer burger with fries while the husband got a bacon cheeseburger.  The food was excellent - and we added a slice of the special caramel apple pie at the end.  All together, it was about $60 with two drinks each, which is not bad considering the quality of the food (and that he wasn&#39;t ordering Miller - on special that day).

The crowd is pretty old and definitely local - adding to the charm.  And, there is no smoke remnants from times past, which is great!"

Neat things about the place, in a desert wasteland of nothing but shitty sports bars and dumpy suburban food, they have a limited but inspired beer list; someone here, at least, likes a good brew.

Also, when seated at the bar, they serve complimentary peanuts and dumping the shells on the butter slick floor is a local institution. 10 points if you can land them in the fireplace.

The food itself consists of burgers my wife likes out of nostalgia but are kind of boring, notably a fine Ruben, other sandwiches, and overpriced appetizer that are actually a nice offering but I just can&#39;t muster an interest in.

The atmosphere is a dim ambience, cozy, a little tight, and always busy; it&#39;s actually a place I&#39;d like to have dinner and relax like the old timers here."

However, I continue to make it a point to visit every time I&#39;m in Chicago (1-2x a year).  Why?

1.  &#34;Everyone knows your name&#34;  Bartender Patti, makes you feel at home.  She learns your name, knows your drink, gives you the latest on sports scores and has an infectious laugh.  
2.  Country Burger-I add Blue Cheese crumbles, but they use good quality meat to make a great burger
3.  Fried Appetizers.  When I get off the plane, the first thing I&#39;m craving is some good old fried food that you can&#39;t get in California and Country House hits the spot.
4.  Great Selection of Beer &amp; Wines
5.  The place is HAUNTED!  Its been featured on tv shows, etc.  So I&#39;m always on the lookout for the &#34;woman&#34; ghost.

Finally, as a bonus, they have a large parking lot, so parking has never been a struggle.

I had the muffuletta with onion rings. You have to try this. Neither meat overwhelmed the flavor of the other. The real onion rings have a crunchy coating.

I was excited to see that upon moving to Westmont there was another one right around the corner from me!

Seems like the menu is the same or at least 90% the same as the Geneva location. 

I came here last Friday night around 8:30 p.m. It was the first Friday night I&#39;d been out since having our baby so I was excited! Even better, we came with some old friends that were back in town visiting. I decided to take them here since I&#39;d been wanting to check this location out and I knew they had a good beer selection. My friends love their beer!

Well we came in and there was a 30 minute wait. We decided to put our name down and we headed to the bar to get a drink while we waited. There weren&#39;t any seats so we stood on the peanut shells drinking our beers while we waited for a table to open up. Personally, I&#39;m not a fan of the peanuts and the shells on the floor. I think it makes the place less classy and dirty. I also think the shells are a trip and fall hazard.  I also wish the ventilation system was a little better in the bar area. This is mainly because we totally got crop dusted! Eww, the smell was horrible and just lingered forever!! 

Once the hostess called our names - the wait was about a 20 minutes - we headed to the dining room and were seated. Now, this place is crammed with chairs and tables already, but when you add a full house it is nearly impossible to walk around without physically bumping into other people. If you are claustrophobic I would find another place to get dinner.

All of our meals were delicious. The spinach dip was piping hot and came with plenty of pita toast points. My bison burger was mouthwatering and hit the spot. I would highly suggest their burgers whether beef, bison, or ostrich. All equally delish!

Overall I like this place because the food is good and hearty. And this past weekend the service was spot on. We will be back in the future."

Thanks to Yelp, I found this place. The chili was so SO good: it had ground beef, big chunks of tomatoes, fresh onions and cheese on top, green peppers, jalepenos, and a side of oyster crackers. Another great part was the hearty portion size. The only unfortunate thing was that they charged $0.80 for onion and cheese on the chili.

We also got the duck tender appetizer which was also a good portion size with a lot of tenders. It was nice that it wasn&#39;t super breaded either.

The overall feel of Country House is warm and cozy. Lighting is dim, with traditional country style wood furniture and wood paneled walls. Our waitress was friendly, quick, and responsive. I have no complaints about this restaurant. The food was great and we will def come back!!"

Picked a good night and scored $2.75 Miller Lite drafts. Ordered a Top Drawer Burger with American cheese, onions, mushrooms, and bacon, on a pretzel bun with steak fries. Burger was decent enough but nothing spectacular. Juicy, cooked to medium, and a formidable gut-buster, just not a whole lot of flavor...no pop! For all of the fanfare, I expected more out of the $18 Short Rib, Chuck, Brisket Burger. It was good, and I&#39;ll definitely stop in again, but nothing that silences the nearby competition.  In all actuality, the steak fries finished ahead (of the burger) in their respective field. Bar service was friendly and attentive. Definitely a local watering hole worth checking out, just not one I plan on calling my &#34;go-to&#34; anytime soon."

This is an old favorite (have been coming here since it opened), and one that is a special treat whenever I am in town.  It is one of the very few restaurants I have ever been to that will cook a hamburger true to order.  Medium rare means medium rare. In my opinion, they cook a perfect hamburger. One of the best I have ever eaten, and it is consistent every time. Lots of choices of breads, cheeses, toppings, and condiments.  One of the best places to order out of this world onion rings.  Lots of craft beers on the menu.  Friendly atmosphere, great service.

My parents met here, I grew up down the street from here, and I&#39;ve been coming here since I was a little kid. All nostalgia aside, now as a grown adult, I still love this place.

Their french onion soup is amazing. The bowl is a generous portion and baked with tons of delicious melty cheese on top. I always begin my meal with it.

Due to the sheer amount of years I&#39;ve been coming here, I&#39;ve tried a LOT of items, and everything is good. I like the pasta with chicken and vegetables, the Kentucky bourbon steak - but my fave, and the thing I always come back to - is the country burger. You have so many delicious options - what kind of bread? Cheese? Onion? And it&#39;s awesome every single time. I&#39;m partial to a medium rare burger with bleu cheese and no onion on dark rye. The fries are enormous thick cut steak fries and I always manage to clean my plate.

If you&#39;re looking for contemporary or cutting edge, look elsewhere. But if you want delicious, reliable casual eats in an equally casual environment (with a great ghost story attached!) get yourself to the country house, pronto."

When we were there this server Jen had to make multiple comments negatively towards my friend as we were trying to enjoy a meal and a nice cold beer. My friend doesn&#39;t even know who this server is other than patronizing the business. I personally was more uncomfortable as this server would make comments, purposely towards the bartender so we would hear, making it uncomfortable not only for us but for the bartender as well as we understood what she was saying.

Add ketchup and mayo and you have the worlds best burger. I&#39;m not exaggerating. You must try it exactly that way. It&#39;s more addicting than any street drug out there..

I normally get the Top Shelf burger with the steak fries. The burgers are always A-MAZING! The steak fries are cut super thick and are the perfect companion to the juicy burger.

On this occasion though, I wasn&#39;t really wanting a burger, so I went with the Fish and Chips.

For the Win! I love fish and chips. These were, hands down, the best I&#39;ve ever had! The batter was light and fried perfectly to just the right crispness. The fish was moist and flavorful. But what really set them apart was the tartar sauce... Oh. My. Gosh. Sometimes I have to forfeit to using ketchup with fish and chips when the tartar sauce is sub-par. Country House&#39;s is on point! I may have to order a jar next time to go! My wife went with her usual, the Top Shelf burger, which she really enjoyed. My brother and his girlfriend shared a plate, the Bacon Burger and fries.

I&#39;m not much for dessert, especially since the serving sizes are so big. My brother&#39;s girlfriend got the cheesecake and insisted that everyone try. I had one bite that was very, very good! 

I&#39;m awarding the five star here solely on the food. I really wish they could expand their dining area. The wait is ALWAYS super long and the bar isn&#39;t large enough to accommodate the waiting patrons. It&#39;s really cramped quarters and you&#39;re forced to awkwardly stand shoulder to shoulder with other folks waiting."

It&#39;s the type of place that i love to come more often during winter time and get a soup, Burger, and fries to warm up.

Personally i don&#39;t think their standard hamburger that they rave about is anything special.  Its good don&#39;t get me wrong, but it&#39;s not like &#34;Wow this is the best burger ever&#34;.  On the other hand the bison burger is exceptional, and is even more juicy and flavorful than the standard hamburger here.  Burgers are served with their classic steak fries.  They always come out super hot and perfectly salted.  I&#39;m sure their just normal frozen fries but i simply just like them a lot. I usually always get the bison burger but on occasion ill switch it up and get the Pork Chops which are awesome and would highly recommend, or i sometimes try the French dip which is solid.  I would not recommend really getting any of their appetizers.  It&#39;s pretty much just your standard bar food apps, although the duck tenders are the shining item of the bunch.  Oh yea, and as i said before i like getting soups here.  Usually they have a soup of the day rotation but they always have the french onion soup which is one of the best I&#39;ve had.

Back when I used to live right down Clarendon Hills Road from the Country House, I used to like to drop in for lunch when I was working from home. They have a variety of sandwiches and other goodies on the menu and I never went wrong no matter what I ordered.

There&#39;s a very cozy (maybe too much so) dining area and a bar, too. The ambience is comfortable and what you&#39;d commonly see before chain restaurants became all the rage.

They are known for their burgers and you can&#39;t go wrong with any of those.... they even have a Bison Burger!

The 1/2 pound cooked-to-order beef patty is juicy and perfectly sized for a hungry customer. The recent addition of a stoplight at the Country House intersection on 55th street should make it a little easier to access. The parking lot is a good size, yet it fills up during busy lunch and dinner service, speaking to its popularity.

 I&#39;ve eaten here a few times, and since I moved a bit closer to the restaurant, I thought I&#39;d give their takeout service a try twice over as many weeks. I ordered the burger each time (medium), and by the time I brought it home--less than five minutes later, it was still nice and hot. They offer your choice of grilled or raw onions, and the burger is offered with tomato slices and a leaf of romaine to top it off (no ketchup or mustard for a take out order). A generously sized dill pickle spear is provided. You&#39;re offered your choice of steak fries, potato salad or onion rings. I tried the fries and rings on my two most recent visits.

There were a couple of problems in these two orders which lowered my rating to 3 stars. On my first visit, the beef had a  funkiness to it which seemed to indicate that it had turned the corner from fresh. I thought it might be my imagination, so I gave them another shot a week later. On this instance, the burger itself was excellent, but the onion rings were room temperature when I ate them under 5 minutes after taking my order home. I was a little nervous about them -- I had a view into the kitchen from where I was standing, and the onion rings had been placed on the foam take out box four or five minutes prior to the  burger being added to complete my order. In fairness, I&#39;d rather that my main course be hot and the side cold than vice-versa, but they should be able to time it so that both hit the plate at about the same time.

I will give the Country House another chance to win me over, but for now, 3/5 is the best I can do. When all cylinders are hitting, this place is great. Their inconsistency is a drawback, though."

Been there many times over the years, some experiences better than others, will circle back after my next visit if things improve. The place is really dark inside. Not real clean. Service about as mixed as the food quality. 
Waitresses, r always very experienced and usually older and often appear a bit down trodden. Orders usually taken correctly in the dark.   Like the clam chowder on Fridays. Tables very close together and fairly small. Bar is often noisy, sit far far away, if that is an option. The layout of the place is awkward, appears to have been built by someone name Jack. Did I mention the noise, even away from the bar, you will hear people talking at pack in tables.

We ate there last night at 11pm after catching the new Hunger Games movie. We have driven past a million times, as we live just up 55th St. a ways in Downers but had never stopped. I asked my wife to search for restaurants on Yelp that were open late and had decent reviews, which led us to CH.

We started with the Savannah Shrimp appetizer. Tender shrimp cooked in butter with a great blend of seasonings and a light spicy kick. Fresh, soft French bread on the side allows you to dip into the tasty melted butter sauce.

My wife got the Bison burger on a sesame bun with sautéed onions, cooked medium. Side of onion rings. She said it was cooked perfectly to her liking and very flavorful.

I had the Top Drawer burger, medium rare on a pretzel roll with steak fries...

One of the best burgers of recent memory! Cooked to perfection. Extremely juicy! The combinations of meats was a match made in carnivore heaven... The pretzel roll held up perfectly to the extra juicy meat, never getting soggy throughout the meal.

Thanks also to our server who was very attentive. Drink refills came promptly and without being asked for. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t catch her name.

As I work in Chicago, it&#39;s refreshing to see good food like this coming in at a reasonable price!

So my gf, her brother, his gf, and I wanted to go out for AYCE king crab, but due to a power outage, the original restaurant was out of the question. Instead, we finally decided on The Country House.

I am not a fan of the supernatural and the fact that this place is supposedly haunted, but since I did not drive I did not mind... much.

Anyways, I&#39;m glad we went because first and foremost service was excellent from the bartender to our waitress. From the bartender I learned about a new drink after he took my original drink order. Waitress was just on top of things with the waters and how she took care of us.

Food itself was good. We came close to 9 and were able to get the $3 appetizer specials. Here are the food items that we ordered and I tried.

Poblano poppers: The clear winner of all the apps and a new item to their menu. Maybe it&#39;s because they&#39;re different that I liked it so much, but our whole table liked these.
Duck Tenders: These were also different. Not bad... they were decent. The sauce that this came with was really good.
Jalapeno Poppers: Tastes like jalapeno poppers, but you can tell they&#39;re fresh because of the snap of the jalapenos. 
Chili: I ordered this for myself although it&#39;s an app. Very good and has nice spice to it. Ask for sour cream with it. Delish.
Spinach and Artichoke Dip: Pita was a little off somehow, but good. Unlike other artichoke dips this one did&#39;t feel as bad for you. It was more cream cheese like for consistency too.
Kentucky Bourbon Steak: Gf got this and she liked it. I thought it was really good too. 

I just finished reading about the ghost here after looking at their website. Pretty scary, but with food and service this good we&#39;ll be back again with our group."

Tips: 
Certain appetizers are $3 Every day between 2:00 - 4:30 and 9:00pm - Close.

$3.99 Naked Burger - Sun through Thur night after 9:00 pm and Fri &amp; Sat night after 10:00 pm enjoy a full sized Country Burger without any sides

We ordered all the $3 appetizers. The duck tenders were a bit dry and not so tasty. The poblano bites were different and a bit spicier than the jalapeno poppers. I ordered the Kentucky Bourbon steak. It was really good. The meat was not too tough and the sauce complimented the steak well. The clam chowder soup was a little too watery for me, but the taste up on point. I didn&#39;t really care for the spinach and artichoke dip. The dip wasn&#39;t really cheesy, it was more of a cream cheese consistency. The pita bread that came with it was a little too soft. I was bummed that they ran out of the dessert. Would have liked to try it! We also ordered the $3.99 burger and it was huge. Awesome value for a late night burger!

It&#39;s very hard to find a place with exceptional service. Our waitress was awesome. She made sure our waters were always full, checked on us throughout the evening, friendly, and was prompt every time we asked for something. I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better waitress!"

It was my first time here and this place ROCKS. The staff (Dubee) and services here were better than she stated. That was just the begining of our time here. The burgers are out of this world good, I ordered the Bison burger w/cheddar, grilled onions w/jalapenos on a pretzel roll bun.  This burger took me back to a place I went to in Chicago, Buffalo Bill&#39;s.  My wife got a beef burger w/mozarella and she really enjoyed this also.
    We will be going back here soon as I am interested in trying other items from their interesting menu. I just have to save room for dessert next time.  They have a deal now for rewards as you return back here, that should save a few bucks. We hope to see you all again soon."

First the mozzarella sticks are amazing. Yes, I know I just wrote that. Because you think how easy are they to make, they must be universal. Well this place does something that makes them delicious. Yes try the mozzarella sticks.
I had the buffalo burger and it was delicious. My only problem was it was so good and tasted so much like a real burger that...
But the buffalo burger was great. It came with steamed veggies which were also quite good. 
It definitely has a country feel and an old school atmosphere. But the burger was delicious, everyone was happy with their meal. I want to go back and try the other &#34;health&#34; foods they have.
I would definitely go back, just not sure when I will be back in the neighborhood."

It is considered to be haunted by a visitor killed in a car crash nearby many decades ago. The exterior of the building is very dark and spooky, like an old barn. The inside is also pretty eerie. 

In terms of food, the hot pastrami sandwich is by far the best item on the menu. It is so rich that eating the whole thing is a challenge. The hot pastrami is served on a thick pretzel bun with a side of Honey Dijon mayonnaise. The Honey Dijon mayonnaise is essential; it really adds to the sandwich.The burgers are quite good too--juicy and charred just enough on the surface. This Country House is a great neighborhood place--and a must-see for ghost hunters!"

Parking lot was pretty crowded and was told that the wait would be around 30 min.  

We ended up waiting at the bar - $3.50 Miller Lite bottle or draft special......score!
The bar was packed but the bartender was able to serve us quickly - no hassles.

To our surprise we were sat after about 20 min.  The decor was very old school with wood paneling.  I had not come here since my high school days but remembered that the food was decent.

Menu is pretty basic but hearty.  I went for the buffalo burger, husband went for the regular burger.  Waitress was very friendly and kept pace when my husband ordered more beer.  Our food came out pretty fast and had no complaints on the food.

Overall the eating experience was good (in the burbs) and would definitely come out again.  Reminded me of a Hackney&#39;s where you get classic home food without the pretentiousness.  Reasonably priced as well.  I would recommend this restaurant based on the area if you want to avoid the chains!"

I was not expecting it to be soooo small inside BUT I like the little bar area! Low lighting, peanuts on the table = toss shells on the floor. Sweet!! Large boars head over the wall that the fireplace is on. Happy the seats had backs to them! Great beer selection if you are a beer drinker. I love my wine and mixed drinks. :)

I ordered the Buffalo burger with some cheddar cheese on an awesome pretzel roll. Mmm pretzel rolls!! Pretty good burger I have to say. Great fat steak fries as well. 

Fun place to hang with friends and to get to know the locals. I can tell there are many regulars there which is pretty cool. Popular place for sure! You have to go during the week or EARLY evening. If you don&#39;t then you can forget parking spot. One time I wanted to go there was ZERO parking so I had to leave. :( 

The one down thing was super TINY restrooms and a little too warm temp wise. 

Other then that good food and good tunes in the bar. I will def go back to try other items and to check out the daily specials.

If you like a cozy, small environment (this location used to be an actual house), then you will find this place very charming. The wait staff is very friendly and efficient.

This was my second trip to The Country House, and I was unimpressed the first time.  This time was downright depressing.  Our waitress told us a lot of people liked the fried chicken, but that it was bad.  She also claimed that the ribs were more bone than meat, and the meat did not even come close to falling off the bone.  When my husband asked what he should order instead, she looked around and vaguely stated that everything else was good.

He ordered the fried chicken, and it was not impressive.  I ordered the vegetarian southwest wrap, and it was okay.  The best item that I ordered was their homemade Shandy.  It was a smooth balance of sweet, lemon, and beer.  However, it would not get me to come back."

Waited in the bar, they passed some spinach/artichoke dip around... that was a nice touch.  I was underwhelmed by the food, I ordered the salmon on ciabatta; it was dry.  Tasted the muffaletta, that was okay... others in the party ordered burgers, no complaints yet no raves... a salad that was okay... and the tilapia sandwich, that was good.  Honestly my favorite part was the fries and the sauce they served with the sandwich.  Price wise, it&#39;s okay... there were six of us and we each had a drink with the bill coming in about $110."

However, after discovering this place years ago--I always told myself I would stop in here. I got this chance because a friend of mine lives 2 minutes from the place. We stopped in yesterday just to check it out, and boy was it fun. The bar had a cozy, crunchy atmosphere to it. Crunchy, you&#39;re wondering? There&#39;s sea of peanut shells that will greet you under your feet--but don&#39;t let that fool you, this place is wonderful.

Not only are the beers here priced well, but they give you peanuts at the bar to eat and you can throw the shells on the floor. Although we went at a down time, the staff was very friendly, and we even got to ask about their ghost that haunts the location. We didn&#39;t get to eat any of their food, although I&#39;ve heard good things. I will say I&#39;m definitely going to come back with a group soon.

There were four in our party and I know what everyone else had.... 
Veggie burger- one of the best according to the one who ordered it
Regular burger- decent according to carnivore #1
Potroast special of the day- no comment but the plate was wiped absolutely spotless by carnivore #2

I don&#39;t remember my dinner because all I can remember is dessert.  THE BEST CHEESECAKE. EVER.  Unfortunately carnivore #2 had eaten too much to try dessert, but the rest of us all agreed that as far as regular cheesecake goes this was the absolutely best cheesecake all of us had ever had.  Now, about every week since then we joke about going in and just ordering cheesecake but we haven&#39;t gotten back there yet as we tend to like to eat a whole meal out and are still trying new places since moving to Westmont a couple months ago.

It&#39;s a very small place, but it was clean on the inside and it&#39;s in a great location. You can get in and out pretty easily. 

They have a huge menu with things like hot dogs, sausages, italian beef, and of course chicken. The meal deals are great. You can get a sandwich like chicken parm, meatballs, italian beef, whatever you want, with a side, and a 16 oz drink for under 7 bucks. That&#39;s what&#39;s up. Although I love Portillo&#39;s dearly....it&#39;s like 7 bucks for a single sandwich there. Expensive (and yet so delicious)! But if you don&#39;t have a preference and you&#39;re looking for a cheap meal, this is your spot.

The sides are all pretty much sourthern comfort foods like mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, coleslaw, hush puppies, etc. The drinks do not come with free refills, so keep that in mind when dining in. It&#39;s 50 cents per refill which is pretty lame. Who charges for refills anymore?

Today I ordered the italian beef sandwich with extra hot peppers (at the time I didn&#39;t know about being charged for refills....fml). It was a really great sandwich. The bread was soft, the beef was tender, the peppers were hot as hell, and the juice from the beef was very well seasoned and also really spicy. Normally it&#39;s a little over 5 bucks, but each day of the week they run specials and today was 4 dollar italian beef day. Hooray! My husband ordered the maxwell polish street sausage. It came with onions and mustard and he enjoyed it. I think it was a little over 3 bucks.

My only complaint (aside from no free refills) was the customer service. The young girl at the counter was rude and acted like it was a hassle to take our order. Didn&#39;t bother to say hi or anything, just stared at us blankly until we said what we wanted to eat. So rude. Otherwise, this place was pretty good."

Beef and Sausage sandwich, tasted like old freezer burned tough beef and an unimpressive meat tube, it was chewy nasty and wrong, the chicken was not what it should be, salty, tough and unfortunate...  There were 4 of us and we were all sorely disappointed...

The place was a little small, but the spacing of the tables weren&#39;t tight. It seemed like a nice mom and pop restaurant and the owners were there to make sure you feel welcomed.

I came in with a party of 7, and they were able to seat us immediately. They did not hesitate to bring out the oolong tea, which was complimentary with the food. We ordered the ong choy, combination fried rice, mapo tofu with shrimp, egg drop soup, chicken and broccoli, and green beans with shitake mushrooms. 

Everything was standard. With most Chinese restaurants, the dishes were pretty oily, which I&#39;m not a fan of. The green beans were slightly over cooked where it lost its crunchiness. The tofu was a little sour (I&#39;m not sure if it was supposed to be like that), but the sourness reminded me of spoiled tofu; however, I could be totally wrong about that.

On the positive note, the stiake mushrooms were pretty good, but the highlight would be the chicken and broccoli! The chicken was very well seasoned and taste very fresh. 

Overall, I would give this place a 3, because nothing really stood out for me. The 10% off when you check-in and the service was the real kicker. If you want casual Chinese food, I would recommend this place.

I am a food snob, especially when it comes to Asian and since I moved to the Midwest from Los Angeles I am have been continually disappointed with the suburban cuisine.

It was fried and coated in some gelatinous, flavorless glop. Then we tried shrimp red curry. It tasted like a Chinese cook&#39;s attempt to make Thai food. It was in a &#34;gravy&#34;, rather than a coconut milk sauce. Finally, the sizzling pepper steak was the toughest beef I&#39;ve ever eaten. It was like chewing on an Achilles tendon.

The food was simple and decent. Singapore noodles were light and flavorful, not too spicy at all (in fact, I might ask them to bump the heat up a bit if I had a do-over). Moo sho pork was tasty, as well. We had the lunch menu and the portions were ample. The only so-so items were the soups that accompanied the meals, and they were still OK.

Their freshly made tofu pudding (dou fu fa) has a nice silky texture with good flavor. This was probably the best item I had in the meal. However, being called Fabulous Noodles, I expected that the noodles would be the best parts of the meal.

The beef brisket noodle was a bit bland with noodles that were cooked too soft that didn&#39;t really have a bouncy texture to them. The wontons were okay but didn&#39;t taste any better than what I get from the supermarket. Once again, the noodles and broth could have been better. The chicken wings were a tad overcooked so that they were a bit rough and could&#39;ve used more seasoning. The Yu&#39;s noodles Indonesian style had a pretty decent flavor to them although they were a bit too sweet and very oily. The beef chow fun also had a decent flavor but once again, the high amount of oil kept it from being too appetizing although in terms of flavor it was probably the 2nd best in the meal with a decent amount of &#34;wok hay&#34;.

If the level of seasoning and texture of the food was improved a little with less oil usage, this would be a 4 star and comparable to some of the better restaurants in Chinatown."

3. the potstickers are among the best dumplings we&#39;ve ever had.
4. dinner portions are large. but if you are looking for the over-candied americanized stuff, I recommend elsewhere. the food we had (hong sue chicken and indonesian noodles) was deliciously and not overspiced.
5. ate far more than was good for us, all for under 30 bucks.
6.  We will be going back to work through some of their 300+ menu items. the table next to us got sweet and sour fish, and it was all i could do to not ask for a piece :)

Came here for a late lunch on Friday around 2:30, there was only 2 other tables other than ours... an 8 top and a 2 top. I&#39;ve been debating for a few minutes on whether to give this place 2 stars or 3 stars deciding to lean toward the generous, but I can certainly say that this is no 4 star establishment. Granted I am rather stingy with my ratings for Chinese restaurants but I always rate honestly. We didn&#39;t have a spectacular experience by any means nor was the food at all satisfying. Though the owner, Helen is extremely polite and friendly, she failed to provide us acceptable service, instead focusing her attention to the larger table. There was no one else to service us except the busboy who could only refill our waters. 

We shared the shrimp toast appetizer, per the recommendation of a previous yelp reviewer... it was literally biting into crunchy oil (it&#39;s bread with mashed up shrimp on top then deep fried... and the oil is completely soaked into the bread). We also had the combination house lunch special and the chicken terriyaki with the hyped up pan fried noodles. Neither was the least bit tasty and was virtually all cheap noodle instead of meat on both. The combination had a few small strips of beef and chicken and ONE shrimp! Goodness... one frickin&#39; shrimp on the whole plate... how the heck are we supposed to split that?! LOL... I took a picture cuz I couldn&#39;t believe it. Wasn&#39;t &#34;cheap&#34; either... for the 2 of us, lunch costed $35 with tax and tip cuz I got a tofu dessert thing to go.

3 stars because they have soft shell crab when in season (the one time I ordered carry out years ago... I Love soft shell crab and no one else had it at the time except expensive seafood restaurants). Also... if anything could be considered &#34;cheap&#34; it&#39;d be their lunch specials for $5.95. You get soup with it, their hot and sour soup isn&#39;t bad... but I&#39;ve had better. 

But I really don&#39;t understand all these 4 stars... the location even looks ghetto. My recommendations for my Chinese food fix in the burbs are:

1) Mapo on Iroquis   (hot and spicy yumminess!)
2) Yu&#39;s Bistro on rt 59   (awesome noodles)
3) Great Wall on Maple Ave   (really good authentic Taiwanese)"

On the weekend, they have Chinese style breakfast.  They do not have all the selections as in Chinatown but they have the basics we always order.   Our favorite is Congee with pork.  My daughter loves their noodle dishes.

The interior of the store isn&#39;t really anything special; lots of teal green, if you&#39;re into that color. We were the only ones in the store (not wholly unexpected for asking for dinner at 9 on a weekday) but were still treated well. The menus are half in Chinese, which I&#39;ve been trained to think is a good thing, although who knows in reality.

We started things off, besides the usual hot green tea, with egg rolls. These were really good and what I hoped they would be--deep fried golden brown on the outside, cabbage on the inside, served with sweet and sour sauce and hot mustard sauce. Besides evoking wonderful memories of childhood, I found that the egg rolls were excellent.

For the main deal, we went with the house special, which is shrimp, beef, chicken and vegetables served over pan-fried noodles. This was really good, if a bit greasy. However, each ingredient still had its own flavor, so the whole dish didn&#39;t all taste like one thing, which is a good thing.

I also ordered duck served on rice on the side. Duck being what it is, it&#39;s *supposed* to be a bit on the oily side. This duck was very good, with a bit of crispy skin and moist and tender meat. They also spooned a little bit of duck broth onto the rice, and it&#39;s a good thing, because there was really incredible duck flavor in the rice as a result. I only wish I had a little bit more duck to eat at the end.

I found Fabulous Noodles from a newspaper review in Chicago and I went there to try their authentic Asian noodles which I hope would be anything but the standard crappy lo mein you get from Panda Express-like Chinese take-outs.

I walked into a humble dining area with no more than 8-10 tables. Then I was pleased to see that they have some specials on the board. They had soft shell crabs and some other enticing items that I actually might try. They also have a limited dim sum menu and I thought I heard the owner mention &#34;dou hua&#34;, which is a tofu dessert or some sort. Tempting but no thanks. I was determined to try their noodles instead.

We started with a BBQ pork appetizer and ordered the Taiwanese style fried noodles between my mom and I. My partner ordered a noodle soup instead. The BBQ pork smelled and tasted funny. Immediately, I knew it wasn&#39;t fresh. The fried noodles were quite good actually. It tasted authentic but nothing wowed us. Note that the portion is huge, enough for two people.

The owner asked if we want to take the leftover BBQ pork home but we declined. She looked surprised but asked us again. But we insisted that we didn&#39;t want them. Better to be safe than sorry. That said, I still think the noodles are worth coming back."

Their lunch menu, in particular, is very reasonably priced.  You can drop $5 or $6 and get a real meal.  However, after the dinner hours start (3pm?) the prices almost double.

The staff member with which I ordered and paid was very friendly, even as I was walking out the door.

My issue here was the food.  Reading other reviews, I am getting the jist that the menu is very touch and go, and not terribly consistent in quality. My General Tso&#39;s chicken was bready, but not fried terribly well.  The meat was cooked completely, but the batter was still mealy.   The sauce was almost flavorless, and even though the menu lists it as &#34;spicy,&#34; it wasn&#39;t at all.  I went home and dumped some dried red pepper flakes on it.  I couldn&#39;t believe how disappointing it was. 

My eggrolls were so greasy that I couldn&#39;t eat them.  Decided they weren&#39;t worth it; if I&#39;m going to eat super greasy, it&#39;d better be amazing.

Four of us went here for lunch. Each entree, while priced at $10-$15, can easily feed 2 people, as all of us had large takeout containers when we left. The menu situation is a bit confusing; one is geared more toward lunch dishes (served Tue-Fri), and the other has dinner entrees, but there is some overlap. Fortunately, the waitress was kind enough to answer all of our questions about the menus as well as how certain food was prepared.

I ordered the BBQ Pork w/ noodles in soup, which managed to put me at the full point on an empty stomach. This bowl was huge and had a large quantity of tender pork and noodles in a savory broth.

As other reviewers have stated, it is located in a strip mall and is rather small, but the food and service are excellent.  Helen, the owner, is the nicest person.  I actually prefer the food here over Joy Yee, though that restaurant seems more trendy at the moment.

For lunch, I like to order the wonton noodle soup which is the best in the burbs.  You&#39;d have to go to Chinatown to get better.  Their more typical lunch platters are good, as well, but nothing special.  I do like their Sunday Dim Sum, which doesn&#39;t have as many choices as the larger restaurants, has an excellent congee.

For dinner, we absolutely crave their season fried orange roughy (we order it with sole since orange roughy is on the seafood watch list).  We love their cantonese fried noodles with beef and chinese brocolli, and my husband loves their szechuan string beans.  Also not to be missed is their walnut shrimp and orange flavored steak.

After not eating here for several years and coming to assume a cozy little family run restaurant such as this would have gone under in these trying times, I saw it while driving back from running an errand and thought to myself that I just had to check it out - for old time&#39;s sake.

Imagine my surprise when everything was the same, from the multi-colored booths I recall bouncing around on as a child to the art on the walls I dissected with my eyes while waiting for our order.  The food even tasted the same as I remembered (I got Mo Po Tofu to go with my rice)!

They have a big selection with something for everyone, but it does cost a little more per dish than if you were to go to something similar in say Chinatown or something, but you get healthy portions and I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever gotten something here I didn&#39;t like.  If you eat family style (order a few dishes for everyone at the table to share), then it&#39;ll cost considerably less than if everyone were to simply order their own.

I can say I was not impressed by anything we ordered.  The hot and sour soup was completely average, nothing fresh added to it;  there was something hard and sinuey (sp?) in there as well.  The egg drop soup was very pale.  obviously not made with egg yolks, but the kids seemed to like it.  As for the Sweet and Sour chicken, the chicken was very small and heavily battered.  The serving size was generous though.  The chicken fried rice was also generous, but very, very oily.  If some got on your table, you&#39;d have an oily mess to clean up.   Nothing here that couldn&#39;t be had at any American Chinese restaurant.  I think they all get their food from the same suppliers."

My recommendations...start with shrimp wonton soup, the best wonton soup I have ever eaten, by far.  Continue on to potstickers, which are hearty and deliciously seasoned.  End with Ginger beef (nicknamed Ginger crack by a fellow devotee), szechuan string beans, and the seasoned tofu (spicy with jalapenos).  If you are a fried rice fan it also will not disappoint.  Not to be missed, never so busy that you have to wait, and with prices that are very reasonable, especially given the quality of the food.  Check it out!"

We were the only people there (it was after the lunch rush, but before geriatric dinner).

The food was delicious and the portions were pretty big. We ordered crab rangoon and egg rolls for appetizers  (we were so hungry I forgot to take a picture). I believe there were 5 pieces of crab Rangoon and 6 (SIX!!!) egg rolls---and not the small things kind, but regular size! We ate it all (they were delicious and in our defense we were soooo hungry!) My mom ordered the green curry and I ordered the pad see eiw. We were asked what level of spicy we wanted for our main dishes and we said medium (usually it makes no difference but they actually added some heat to it!) 
Service was a bit slow...it looked like the owner was dealing with some business business so it&#39;s understandable, but I would&#39;ve loved a little more attention (it took a while for my water to get refilled, I almost stole my mother&#39;s).

I will need to stop back and update my review based on their normal menu, but we certainly enjoyed the buffet offerings, and we&#39;re delighted to again have this space filled by a Thai restaurant. 

The owner and staff are very warm and friendly. Most of the food we tasted at the buffet was delicious, especially the Panang Chicken. Based on that, I&#39;m excited to try their Tom Kha soup next time we visit. I love that coconut-y goodness. Veggie tempura was addictive, as was a rice noodle dish that was out. The only thing I didn&#39;t enjoy in the buffet was the dumpling appetizer, but I never really care for those Thai-style (I&#39;d much rather the chunkier, more indulgent junk food version at every Chinese take-out place). Service tonight was a little spotty, but that&#39;s to be expected on such a busy night, I think. 

The restaurant is nicely decorated, and I love the view into the kitchen upon entering the foyer. That would be very handy for take-out orders.

My only constructive feedback is that I&#39;d love to see them spruce up their bathrooms a bit (I don&#39;t think much changed with the bathrooms since the former occupant left, and without providing too many details, I&#39;d say a new toilet seat and a deep clean of the floors is in order)."

I drove to her house in Wheaton, and we decided that we were going to dine in at Simply Thai. This is located in the same spot of where Pad Thai Etc. used to be.

We arrived around 7:30 on Friday night. There were three other parties in the restaurant when we arrived. My mom had ordered takeout from this establishment a few weeks prior, but she&#39;d never dined in.

The restaurant was very clean and had a comfortable atmosphere. There was ambient music playing, but I never really noticed it, which was nice. I hate places with blaring music!

Anyways, we decided to order an appetizer to split. Their menu was very typical of Thai restaurants: noodles, curries, and entrees. For our appetizer, we had to decide between spring rolls or chicken satay. Since I was going to have a chicken dish for my meal, we decided on spring rolls. They arrived promptly after ordering! They were filled with carrots, bean sprouts, egg, shrimp, and cucumber. They were covered in the Chef&#39;s special sauce, which was my favorite part! The sauce was very sweet, but not anything overpowering. My only request would have been to have the sauce served on the side, not poured over and onto the rolls. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I was fine with it, but I&#39;m not sure if every consumer wants their spring rolls covered in this sauce.

For the next course, I ordered Tom Yum Shrimp Soup. It also came out very quickly. It was served in a huge bowl, too. Our waitress, Mookie (I believe), brought two small bowls for us to share the soup, even though it was primarily for me. The amount of shrimp in the bowl was amazing! I think I had 8 or 9 total shrimp... so they do not skimp on the shrimp here! However, the broth had quite a kick, and the lemongrass flavor was extremely strong. It wasn&#39;t terrible, but I probably won&#39;t be ordering it again.

For our entrees, we both decided on noodle dishes. I went with the Pad Kee Mou with Chicken. My Ma had the Pad Thai with Chicken. I also requested extra vegetables on my dish. We both ordered mild, because we are wimps... especially me! 

Upon further review, I should have ordered Pad Thai. My dish was good, but it seems like I received less food than my Ma, even though our dishes were the same price.

Simply Thai was simply pretty solid. I was disappointed by the soup, but the appetizer and entrées were good. It was very similar to the previous owners, but there were subtle differences in the dishes. One reason I really enjoyed my meal here was the service. Owner/Chef came out and checked on us and was very nice. Our waitress was also very good. I would rate the food around a 3.5, but the service and atmosphere was a definite 5! It&#39;s the opposite at the other Thai restaurant we were considering that night (TT in Glen Ellyn).

Our total was 42 dollars. A bit high, but since I ordered a 10 dollar soup, I guess I should have expected it. We did not order drinks... FYI, they are BYOB for the time being!

I will return!"

After reading the review by fellow yelper Joe E. on 9/19/15, I decided to seek out this delicious new restaurant.  This is one of those places that if you don&#39;t know it&#39;s there you will never find it.  It&#39;s located in a small mini-mall just off of the train tracks.  

We went late on a Sunday morning and discovered another couple finishing up.  Otherwise we were the only patrons in the restaurant until we left when another family walked in.  It being Sunday I imagine that they had a slow start but I can imagine them getting busy for dinner hours, esp with take-out.  

We ordered the Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp which was very spicy and almost overpowering with fish sauce.  It was still tasty though &amp; had 7 shrimp in it for 3 people.  Not bad although a bit pricey for $9.95.  The Green Curry with Chicken was your typical Thai restaurant fare, and the Pad Thai with Pork was good. 

Overall I was impressed with the food.  It was a good comfortable meal.  The service was quick &amp; fair.  The food server was attentive &amp; chatty.  I would definitely stop back in when I&#39;m in the neighborhood.  But since there is no Lunch Special menu on the weekend I would probably avoid on Sat/Sun."

Had the Chicken Panang Curry ($12), Rama Noodles ($11), and a form of stir fried Pad See Ew noodles with vegetables.

Panang Curry was a bit too watery in texture but the spices were enough to balance it out. Serving size was good enough to make one full plus have extra for take out.
Recommend the medium spicy level.

Rama Noodles are Pad See Ew noodles (a bit thicker) in a sweet-peanut-spicy sauce, much like what you might put in spring rolls. Serving size also very large.

The taste is more catered towards non-Asians, but does not compromise too much.
This is probably the best (in taste and value) Asian restaurant in Wheaton.

Yes yes I know! Shocking right!! I am definitely going to give them another try and see if I have the same great experience again!"

Also I ordered a meal and PAID for a meal and only got the crunch wrap portion of it. My food was cold when it came to me.

He claimed the cashier making my food had changed his gloves in the half second he was out of my sight. I didn&#39;t buy it and asked for a refund. Tables were also filthy and the place was dead.

The drive-thru can be a little slow, even if the line is long.  Today the cheese in my quesadilla wasn&#39;t completely melted, so I&#39;d have to agree with some of the other reviews commenting on Taco Bell&#39;s inconsistency.  You get what you pay for, right?

This Taco Bell breathes a little nostalgia for me, and not just because of the fancy roof.  We&#39;ve stopped here after many bar crawls, baseball games, and nights at the club for our very satisfying fourth meal.  Now this TB only serves one purpose:  If I go to the bank next door, and I have to grab lunch, and I don&#39;t have time to go anywhere else, I go here!

Last night was my first visit (and I&#39;d like to say last so I can get into a good diet groove but let&#39;s face it, I&#39;m only human and sometimes that fourthmeal just calls to me). In fact, it was my first taco bell trip in almost 4 years and though I regret it for caloric purposes only, my experience was a particularly enjoyable one. 

I rolled up a little after 11pm full knowing that whatever I ordered would be down the hatch before I cold even maneuver my way out of the maze like parking lot. And since it&#39;d been awhile between meeting my old friend T-Bell, and my dietary habits had changed from meat monger to veggie whore, I needed a little assistance on what items on their menu, would still be available on my (non-carne) menu. The drive-thru gentleman was super helpful and let me know that they could leave off the meat and sub black beans for the animal lard-y refried beans. Perf! 

I ended up ordering an egregious amount of food for one person (so egregious that I actually lied about it today when asked) but the point is that I left happy and have yet to feel any dietary backlash from the amount of fire sauce I squirted on my (insert disturbingly large number here) tacos.

4 Stars for a fourthmeal decent enough to not instill a inordinate level of guilt."

Unfortunately we were met with a quesirito of despair and heartache. I was furious to discover NO real cheese on my quesirito. I knew this because typically the unmelted cheese is visible. Nope. Just gas station grade nacho disappointment. Reluctantly we opened our five layers of disgust burrito and were forsaken with the cold innards of goopy sadness. The refried beans should of been retired beans. The tortilla to filling ratio hurt my feelings. The cooks didn&#39;t care at all about me or my boyfriend AT ALL. Lastly we gave our best shot to the dollar menu nachos. Soggy chips, retired beans, and more fluorescent colored cheese.

I work in the mall so I need a place that can have my lunch order done quickly without much wait. Whether you call or you drop in, the food takes around 10-15 min at lunch. 

Located next to the Subway, in a little nook in the mall, this place is cool and sleek. There are lots of tables as well as a bar area. Every time I&#39;ve come in, the place has been steady busy but not slammed. I&#39;ve tried a few of their dishes, but my go to favorite is the green curry. It is always hot, fresh, and just delicious. Their rice is also always hot. My other favorite is this purple smoothie with tapioca bubbles (sorry I don&#39;t remember what it is called). Their chicken pad thai is good although the chicken was a tad on the dry side. Their hunan beef was super delicious (without mushrooms of course, I have an allergy).

I have fond memories of this place when it used to be basi Thai. The first thing I noticed was that it has been completely renovated with a nice clean modern feel. It is a bit dark inside with the black ceiling, dark brown tables and chairs and dark laminate floors. The owner greeted us promptly and sat us in the bar area because we needed a table with a high chair for our daughter. They aren&#39;t too kid friendly since they don&#39;t have basic crayons to color for kids to keep pre occupied. The first negative thing was it took forever to take our order and it wasn&#39;t very busy. The server was also very unenthusiastic and had a little attitude.  I was hoping the food would be a redeeming factor.

We ordered the fresh spring roll as an appetizer along with the pineapple fried ride and beef pad see ew. Pretty basic standard Thai dishes. The spring roll was extremely underwhelming and lack in flavor and freshness. The fried rice was decent but a little too wet for my tastes. The noodles were way too sweet. 

Overall this place disappoints. Probably will not come back."

I ordered take out but I got to sit and look around while I waited for my beef pad Thai. The restaurant is very modern looking, dark wood, the bar area is nice and they have a tv. 
Definitely big improvement in the decor. 
My pad Thai was ok, I hadn&#39;t had it in a long time so I devoured it. The flavor was good, portion to go was nice and it tasted fresh. 
I paid extra for the spicy sauce on the side which was very good but I was disappointed that they don&#39;t have the Spicy Mayo I loved from Basi.

Well, that&#39;s how I feel about t.m. Basil. Sadly, this place was just one bummer after another.

My experience started a few weeks ago when I got a message from Ming C., who is the new owner. He pm&#39;d me and told me that Baisi Thai was reopening with new a new name and most of the same food. Was this tacky, or was he trying to be helpful? I can&#39;t decide. There&#39;s a jaded part of me that figures he was just out to get another review, but perhaps not. Maybe this was just his way of trying to get former customers to come back. It didn&#39;t matter tho, because I already knew that it was reopening and already planned to visit. 

See, my wife and I had a long standing love affair with Basai Thai. We had our first date there, before we realized we were dating;  tho neither of us is sure if that was 16 or 17 years ago and...well...math is hard.

So we decided to stop in tonight to celebrate the fact that our fridge was empty. Er, I mean to celebrate that she&#39;d gotten released from her walking boot after ankle surgery. 

They repainted and redecorated and let me just say, they did a REALLY nice job. The place is gorgeous, and it&#39;s totally the kind of place I&#39;d like to hang out. But sadly, a hot looking place does not always make a good place.

Our waitress was incredibly nice. The kind of person you actually want to be friends with. Warm and friendly. But those are not the qualities of a good waitress. Those are just the qualities of people I want to spend my time with. Much like the decor. 

Things started out well. We ordered an order of potstickers and the boneless lemongrass chicken wings. Two of our favorite Baisi Thai appetizers were missing from the new menu, but whatever. We found something new to try in the boneless wings.

The potstickers came out before our drinks, and considering the big deal the waitress made about how long the wings would take, we figured we&#39;d get our drinks first, but she went to get them after the potstickers arrived. The taste was pretty good, but they were a bit heavy on the ginger. They definitely had a thicker dough than the old place, but the flavor wasn&#39;t bad. 

The lemongrass chicken wings came out a few minutes later and they were absolutely delicious. If I ever come back (which isn&#39;t very likely) I&#39;ll be sure to order these, because yes they are definitely tasty, and the serving size was much larger than we expected. 

About two sips into my wife&#39;s soda, our waitress came back to refill it. Something seemed odd about that. It was as if she was checking off all the things a waitress was supposed to do in her head, but she had them all in the wrong order. 

Things soured quickly when our pad thai came out. Basai Thai pad thai was the pad thai against which we held all others. And sadly, the new place just does not hold up. There was absolutely no flavor. Nothing. It was bland and tasteless as could be, which seemed incredibly strange because the color looked right, and that had to come from something. You don&#39;t just get fluorescent orange noodles in the wild (I&#39;m guessing). 

We didn&#39;t see the waitress again until we were finished eating. About half of the entrees were left on our plates, but that was okay because we were stuffed. We&#39;d filled up on the appetizers. Our drinks sat empty throughout most of the meal, and we never got offered refills for the rest of our stay. Eventually the bus boy just took the glasses away because even he probably figured it was a lost cause.

Upon her return, she (the waitress, not the busboy - tho if a girl wants to be a busboy who am I to assign gender roles?) asked how everything was, and I flat out told her that the pad thai simply wasn&#39;t good, and didn&#39;t taste like it used to. She seemed surprised, but genuinely cared about the fact and told the manager. She offered to have them remake it, but neither of us were interested.

She came back a few minutes later and told us the manager was upset and was having the cooks make us another order to take home.

Um. Why? Yuck?

&#34;You say you didn&#39;t like your food? Well here&#39;s MORE of it to take home. Oh, and by the way, you have to wait another 20 minutes for it.&#34;

Gee. Thanks.

Most places wouldn&#39;t charge you for something if you said it was bad, but that wasn&#39;t happening here, I guess. 

So we waited, and the manager (I guess?) dropped a bag off at our table 15 or so minutes later and walked away. He didn&#39;t say anything about it, just left it.  

Then our waitress brought us another table&#39;s check and disappeared for another 8 minutes or so until she realized her mistake and came back with the correct check, which by the way, did have the charges for pad thai. 

So we left feeling disappointed. Baisi Thai was always a very special place for us, but I just don&#39;t think we&#39;re ever going to feel the same way about t.m. Basil."

We came in and sat down immediately on a Sunday night, as it wasn&#39;t crowded at all, they have a full bar and the decor is quite nice and modern.  The waitress was wearing a Beer Chang shirt so I immediately said, get me one of those!  It&#39;s Thailand&#39;s version of Bud or Miller, so whenever I see it, I must order it.

As for the meal, there were 6 of us so we decided to go family style so we could try a little bit of everything.  We ordered the Red Curry with pork (pork is not on the menu but you can ask for it!), Basil Chicken, Panang Curry, Pad Se-ew with beef, Papaya Salad, and Nom Tok Beef and maybe something else I&#39;m missing as well.  We wanted to order the Kow Soy due to my dear memories of it from having some in Northern Thailand years ago.  The waitress said that it&#39;s quite the americanized version of it and it wouldn&#39;t taste the same so we shouldn&#39;t order it.  Then I suggested the Red Curry over basil fried rice since I read the rave reviews about it here on yelp, again, she said not to order it since it&#39;s not as good as the regular red curry.  Instead she suggested the Basil Chicken that it was much better and more authentic.  So you know what, we went with her suggestions, I mean she would know best right?

Once we got the food, everything, except for the Nom Tok beef was delicious!  the Nom Tok beef was pretty modernized with the plating of it, which meant the serving was quite small.  The flavors also weren&#39;t there for it either.  The basil chicken was really good, but the curries were the stand outs of the night, absolutely delicious!  I was quite impressed with the food, I was expecting them to be the watered down versions of themselves, but not at all.

Overall, we had a great time here at TM Basil, everyone enjoyed the food and left with our bellies full.  Service was on point and even steered us away from dishes that wouldn&#39;t be as pleasing to us as others would be.  Friends have already started discussing coming back to this place in the future as well, so I guess we will be back again!"

The menu I believe is the same now with it being TM Basil but the inside is completely renovated. I believe this is a good thing. With the new ownership I am uncertain if that meant the staff is all new as I wasn&#39;t there for about two years (when I came back it was rebranded), however I did notice at least back then as Basai Thai that the service was a bit better. Overall though I cannot say it&#39;s bad, the service when it comes to the host/hostess is great, as is with the food runners and the ones that refill our glasses, but the waitresses often seem pretty dismissive the number of times my colleagues or girlfriend and I have gone there. That&#39;s what prevents my 5-star rating. I haven&#39;t had the said-issue of forcing to tip high as that wouldn&#39;t happen unless on my own accord.

As a vegan, I&#39;m always concerned about what I order/eat and asked lots of questions. 

When the food arrived we only took a couple of bites before my child felt sick and dizzy.  I asked the server (again) what&#39;s in the dish because something made my child instantly sick.  The server sent over the &#34;manager&#34;, I didn&#39;t ask for him, but when I explained what happened, he never showed any concern, he never offered to make the situation right, he never asked if my child was okay, nor did he suggest other options to try. He didn&#39;t even apologize for giving me fish or offer to comp the meal we didn&#39;t eat.  The manager walked away and the server asked us to pay the bill.  WOW!  The server told me her &#34;boss&#34; was not there.  Wait, what?  Then who is the manager? Why even have this guy around if he is unable or unwilling to offer assistance to the customer. If he can&#39;t  &#34;manage&#34; a simple situation like this one, why was he called over to speak with me?   I will never go back and would advise anyone to avoid the aggravation and eat elsewhere.  Not only is the food bad, and the service poor, they have so many other restaurant options at the mall.  Don&#39;t waste your time or money at t.m. Basil.  

One last note, I was told this restaurant was the same as Baisi Thai that closed, which was the only reason I tried it in the first place. However, after attempting to eat at this run down place, I find that very hard to believe. This place is clearly on its way out!"

Inside I was greeted by a very nice and good looking hostess standing behind this vast lobster tank.  Its a eye catcher!  Take a look at the yummy lobsters.  

While being taken to my seat I notice the hugely renovated bar area with a ton of TVs and sports on.  To me that&#39;s a huge hit and I can&#39;t wait to come here with my buds to chill later on.  

After being seated, the waitress was prompt asking if I&#39;ve been here before and what I wanted to drink.  I told her I was a long time customer and I hope Thai ice coffee is still around, thankfully it is!   The best Thai ice coffee anywhere in Chicago.  

Later I order the basil chicken wings for appetizer and orange chicken for dinner.  I know what your thinking, why would you order Chinese food at a Thai restaurant? Well that&#39;s what I was in the mood for and let me tell you, it was one of the best tasting orange chicken I ever had.  

Towards the end of the meal, I asked the waitress where the bathroom is and she pointed me towards the back of the restaurant.  I go down this long hall way and noticed a room marked &#34;kids room&#34;.  I couldn&#39;t believe how nice that room was. I can see kids having real fun in there while parents dine.  Next time I go out with my wife, I will be sure to mention this to her.  

Overall I was greatly pleased with the new renovations and glad to see the food and drinks have not changed and still is 5 star worthy."

Basil, my friends and I ordered 1/2 wrong for what we truly wanted for lunch, and were disappointed not in the taste or the execution of what we ate, but in what we ordered. For 4 of us, we tried the pad Thai with chicken which we absolutely loved; the stir fried mixed vegetables which were unusually fresh and flavorful and accompanied by perfectly prepared brown rice. Very prettily plated with portions more than ample for 1, we were more than pleased. It&#39;s the 2 chicken dishes, the &#34;tower&#34; and the Thai crispy chicken that was so underwhelming at the table and even drier (if that&#39;s possible) and more rubbery at home as a leftover. The juxtaposition between the dishes was crazy, as the rice dishes were so good, yet the 2 chicken entrees were disappointing to a fault. Between superflat, dry, almost flavorless chicken breast strips, the accompanied cold &#34;salad&#34; like contraption and sauce/dressing of the tower was way too weird; while the seemingly same chicken breast, only whole on the plate, had another spicier sauce on the side with lime. None of us were able to stomach chicken that resembled the consistency and color of sandpaper, and it didn&#39;t get any better as a leftover. Dry is dry and doesn&#39;t change by the day. 

I will be back to try one of the other Thai favorites rice and noodle variety of dishes we enjoyed during this visit and can rely on."

A hostess who was agitated to begin with and made faces when we asked for a better table. It was like we tortured her to do her job. Extremely poor attitude.

Barely edible food. It was hands down the worst Thai I ever had.

And then as other yelpers reported the forcing to give a big tip. I was expecting they&#39;d understand why I didn&#39;t tip with the bad service and food. But it appears they just WANTED me to yelp this."

But the drama started after we paid the bill. Our waitress came up to us and charged us why we tipped her low. She called her manager. Even the manager charged us why we tipped her less. I asked if there was any rule to tip a certain amount. The whole scenario made us all mad and humiliated. Go there if you have a lot of money to give away as tip. Otherwise they will come and demand an explanation.

Never again!"

The atmosphere is very modern and open and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  This place is well-staffed and you have multiple wait staff coming by to clear plates, refill water and check if you need anything additional.  I sometimes find that ordering some dishes at Thai places can be difficult because you don&#39;t want to butcher the name of the dish - our waittress helped us to pronounce the names properly and even gave us some pronunciation tips!

I ordered the Pad Thai and was surprised that they brought me a separate tray with chili sauce (a necessity for me) along with extra peanuts (this was a first) as well.  This was a minor addition, but saves me from having to ask for it.  I just felt like they get it.  We also tried the Pad See Lew and a curry dish and I found both of those to be more enjoyable than the Pad Thai.  I tried the Thai iced tea and it hit the spot.  I was hoping that they would have a selection of bubble teas, I think that this would be a great addition.

I thought the pricing was spot on for what you get - I even had some leftovers to take home, which I greatly appreciated the next day!"

I&#39;ve had the sweet and sour chicken which is good but I wish they would give you the option to upgrade to fried rice versus just getting white rice.

Pad-see-ew, no egg with flat rice noodles and 501. Stir fry vegetable with tofu. Both the dishes were flavorful. The noodles could have used a little less oil, but they tasted great nonetheless.

Oak Brook mall scares me a little, but I find that if you park your car near the Sears, walk through their southern pathway, pass the ATM and go down the stairs, its right there. So yes, tucked away, but once you find it, it&#39;s totally worth it!

We always try 4 staples whenever trying a new Thai place:
1. Satay - came nicely grilled with an amazing peanut sauce
2. Crab Rangoon - $5 for 4 pieces seems like a lot, but their portions are crazy big, so you get your money&#39;s worth. dipping sauce has some kick.
3. Chicken Pad Thai - really good flavor and my husband says it&#39;s one of the best he&#39;s tried in the suburbs
4. Chicken Pad-See-Ew - also good flavor, nice veggies and my fave thai comfort food.

They also have wine and beer - limited, but good selection. i had a nice light malbec that went great with the dinner. 

Service was really nice. Space is huge, so really good for lunch or dinner groups. 

can&#39;t wait to come back to try their other dishes!"

Basil used to be Baisi Thai (the best thai restaurant in the Chicago suburbs) before the owners decided to move.  This restaurant opened up pretty recently and I decided to give it a shot, praying it would be as good as Baisi Thai but expecting disappointment.  I was not disappointed in terms of t.m. Basil not meeting my expectations for disappointment.  In other words it was no good.  I ordered food for pickup (a questionable decision to begin with) and was supremely disappointed to find one of my entrees missing entirely.  I called the restaurant and was met with indifference from the person on the phone and was offered neither a refund for the missing item nor something extra to make up for me having to drive all the way back to the Oak Brook mall.  Kind of a let down to be honest.  Chalking up the missing entree ordeal to confusion and my own mistake of not checking my food I headed back home dying of hunger but still hopeful that the food would be the saving grace.  The crab rangoons were soggy and greasy and not at all what I want from a crab rangoon.  The red and green curries were lacking any kind of punch flavor wise and the chicken was overcooked.  t.m. Basil succeeded in filling my stomach with food that was mostly edible but failed miserably in the taste, service and enjoyment departments.  I probably won&#39;t be eating here again but I think a second look could be warranted.  Not sure why but I&#39;m a forgiving person for the most part.  RIP Baisi Thai."

When TM Basil opened I got a message inviting me to give it a try so we made it a priority when we were home for Christmas. We just had an ok experience. The hostess was not warm or friendly- she didn&#39;t seem suited to her role, in my opinion, which is too bad since the restaurant recently opened. I ordered the same thing I used to get- Thai Crispy Egg Rolls which were chicken now and pretty good but not as awesome as I remembered- the sauce was good and the same. I had the cashew chicken which I&#39;ve always loved. I asked for mild spicy but it was non-spicy. There was also a piece of grisly or just not good chicken in it I couldn&#39;t eat. I was disappointed. Our server was really good- warm and respectful.

This restaurant replaced Basai Thai, a staple Thai restaurant in our home. The dishes lacked flavor despite asking for spicy and extra spicy entrees.  The pad thai was extremely bland and I don&#39;t recall seeing any peanuts or bean sprouts in the dish.. the beef in the pad-see-ew was full of gristle. The noodles in both dishes were dry and could have used lots more sauce. The egg rolls weren&#39;t horrible, but nothing to write home for.. 

I&#39;m sad to see the restaurant formally known as Basai Thai close its doors. As a lifetime customer I&#39;m sad to say I won&#39;t be back.  I&#39;m not sure if the management changed or they changed the recipes and quality of food, but it surely wasn&#39;t a good change.."

Although, this was similar to how it was in the past, they asked me how spicy I wanted it. I told them very spicy and it wasn&#39;t spicy at all. Clearly, the new owners were trying to build off of the previous menu and great taste but have failed at their endeavor.

At over an hour before close, we placed our very simple order. An hour and a half later, after a few calls inquiring into the status of our order, the food finally came. It was sopost to be 30-45 min. Our pasta dishes were not only cold, but not even close to what we ordered. Also ordered the pop but brought the wrong pop.Wait, it gets worse. We were hung up on 3 times by someone named Cheeto who was representing the restaurant, in lieu of who should have been there as a manager. Cheeto proceeded to drop F bombs and told us to go screw ourselves. 

I will never order from them again. Still hungry and no food. If you want horrible service, late delivery, wrong food and get yelled at, and hung up on, give them a try. I never will again!"

Typically i enjoy their food, good pizza. I have to say they dropped the ball this past time. We ordered a deep dish sausage and spinach, breaded cauliflower, garlic bread, and cannolis.

First the garlic bread. It was a hoagie bun not cut, warm with melted butter. No garlic, definitely not toasted. Soggy bread.
The breaded cauliflower was pretty good, a little crunchy but not bad. However, the menu and my receipt both say it comes with ranch and we didnt get any.
The cannolis are not made in house, they are awful. I couldn&#39;t finish mine.
Finally, the za. A deep dish that was not. It was a regular pizza, with a tall crust, and no sauce at all! !! It was incredibly disappointing, and rlly dry.

I will not order here again. Order john and eddies, it&#39;s always delicious."

Many students away at college,  traveling home up I 57, anxiously looked forward to tasting their first slice of Rosati&#39;s,  as a symbol of being home.  And for good reason: the pizza is excellent.  To my sensibilities,  this is the best deep-dish in town.

We got into the parking lot and noticed the two people at the front counter making out. It was a man probably in his 40s and a woman who was also in her 40s. It was gross. My girlfriend and I stood in the car and watched them wondering what the f@^* was happening. The two finally saw us and then played it off like nothing. 

We went into the restaurant and I told them my name and they said our pizza would be right up. So we took a seat and the guy came up to me and handed me a pizza thinking it was mine. The woman was like no no no that&#39;s not theirs. The guy looked so confused. I swear he was drunk or something because he had that blank stare, off kind of look in his face. 

While we were waiting for our real pizza to come out they continued to hug and make out in front of us. It was sickening/awkward/unprofessional. Then the lady kept asking my girlfriend about her tattoos and making her feel weird as well. 

All in all it was a horrible experience and I will never go back to this location. 

I&#39;m giving it a 2 though because the pizza was awesome. Cheers to the pizza maker for having to endure the amateur porn that was taking place up front."

They send several coupons a month. So, of course, I use them. However  when I do, they don&#39;t garnish the whole pizza. They stop a good 2 inches from the edge. The time before tonight, when I ordered, I asked if they skimped on toppings because I use their coupons because I would gladly pay full price if they would add toppings all the way to the edge.  The girl on the phone said, no they didn&#39;t and she would tell the cook to make sure they put ample toppings all the way to the edge. And they did. Tonight, I order another pizza and sure as shineola, they skimped! Yep, I used one of their 20 coupons I have in &#34;the drawer.&#34; See the pics for yourself.

I ordered a medium cheese pizza thinking, &#34;Hmm what could go wrong? Even I can&#39;t mess up a cheese pizza!&#34; I also ordered cheese fries because I was (am) overly hungry and had irrational food dreams. It took a while for the food to get here, but probably not unreasonably so since I ordered through GrubHub. 

By the time the food arrived, I was beyond starvation and literally ripped open the bag of fries. First thing I did was shove a handful into my mouth. The next thing I did was look down at what I was eating to see if there was cheese. Nope (but that&#39;s probably the pizza gods way of saving me from myself). My next observation was that they were unreasonably soggy and not very warm. I put them aside thinking surely my pizza would be better. 

After fumbling with the tabs on the side of the box for nearly 30 seconds (I know!) I opened the box and audibly booed. I mean, this pizza has the crappiest looking cheese:sauce:crust ratio I&#39;ve literally ever seen. The crust tastes like uncooked pita (but worse)/saltine/pretzel meh and the tomato &#34;sauce&#34; might actually be ketchup (it&#39;s not, but maybe just tomato paste). The cheese tasted like cheese, but not particularly good cheese. I LOVE crust so much I cringe when people discard it and even I could not ingest the crust. 

I&#39;m severely disappointed. I think the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least the fries will hold me over until breakfast and because my boyfriend had a bottle of wine delivered to my hotel room. 

I honestly hope this was a fluke (there are some reviews that suggest people actually like this pizza). I feel like I was punk&#39;d, only Ashton Kutcher hasn&#39;t popped out laughing yet."

Pizza and the cheese is decent, although the crust is mediocre. The wait times and prices are horrendous. $21 for a pseudo-large I can pretty much finish easily with one other guy? Why not go to a real pizza place. And waiting half an hour for pickup is absurd for a pepperoni pizza only. Look for coupons or just look for a better option."
rosatis-pizza-naperville-2,Heidi K.,oz-Kfz_tDfPQE19CsZy_tg,"Naperville, IL",1,1,1,41,2,gOpMeeW42h_g3fZL58r95Q,1.0,2013-11-26,"I&#39;ve been craving a hot dog for weeks now. After a long day at work, I was too tired to go out anywhere for one, and I don&#39;t keep them at home (the bf doesn&#39;t care for them) so I hopped on ol&#39; Grubhub to order a pair. Unfortunately, Rosati&#39;s is the only place close to me that delivers AND had hot dogs on the menu. I don&#39;t care for them, as they have unusually long wait times for delivery... but I decided it would be worth it.

I&#39;ve ordered their pizzas in the past and you can definitely taste the decline in quality. Not to mention the last time we ordered, it took over two hours for our pizza to arrive. It was partially our fault, as it was Halloween, so I expected a long wait. However, they went to our old address, even though we clearly indicated to deliver to our new one. I felt bad for the delivery driver; he was very nice and apologized. He stated that his manager (or whoever prepped the order for delivery) didn&#39;t bother to check the address on Grubhub, and just went with the address in the computer. Kind of a bonehead move on their part; you should ALWAYS verify the address, but that&#39;s just my opinion.

Anyway, back to my current order. I placed my order at 5:10 or so (2 Chicago Style hot dogs, fries, and a root beer), and was presented with an estimated delivery time of 6:15 - 6:25 p.m. With my past ordering experiences with Rosati&#39;s, this is about right, if not longer.
***Just got an e-mail from Grub Hub saying to expect my order around 6:30 -6:45. Sigh. That&#39;s a long time to wait for a pair of dogs and some fries. 

6:24, my order arrives. The delivery driver was very nice (I&#39;ve never had an issue with them- I suppose that&#39;s where the one star can go. &#39;Cause if I could rate this place 0 stars, I would). He hands me my order and that&#39;s that. Right away, I&#39;m weary.

I set my order down on the kitchen counter. There are three cans of root beer (I had ordered a 1 Liter). No big deal, I just didn&#39;t expect the substitution. 

The fries were barely lukewarm. That I expected; when you get fries delivered, very rarely do they arrive piping hot. Nothing a few seconds in the microwave can&#39;t handle.

Then came the hot dogs. Oh my friggin&#39; disaster. THERE&#39;S KETCHUP ON THEM!!!! There are only two types of people that put ketcup on their dogs: children and the slow minded. You CANNOT call your hot dog &#34;Chicago Style&#34; if there is ketchup on it! Due to being insanely hungry, I obviously did not notice the &#34;ketchup&#34; part on their online menu, so I guess that&#39;s my fault. All I saw was &#34;Chicago Style hot dog&#34; and I immediately added two to my order. I understand what goes on a CS hotdog, I didn&#39;t think it was necessary to read the ingredients.
 
Upon further inspection, the only other ingredients gracing my dogs were onions and mustard. (Red onions, mind you- I&#39;ve never seen red onions on a hotdog). Their menu online clearly states &#34;ketchup, mustard, onions, tomato, pickles, relish and sport peppers.&#34; My hot dogs did not have pickles, relish, or sport peppers.  Also, &#34;Chicago Style&#34; would have celery salt and a poppy seed bun. The temperature of the hot dogs was decent, but my delicious experience I had been looking forward to is now ruined. 

This is the LAST time I order from here. My bf swore it was the last time after the pizza that took over two hours to arrive. But I&#39;m done now. As I sit here chewing the last of my now cold french fries and 1/2 of a &#34;children&#39;s style&#34; hot dog, I am filled with shame and sadness; shame for eating a ketchup covered hot dog and sadness for being let down by such a simple menu item that is damn near impossible to screw up.

Never. Again."

I dont think I remember Rosatis selling slices.....but these guys did....I think it was 3.80 I paid for a slice and a soda (or water if they were out...which they were when I went...no biggie)  But I liked it.  Lots of parking and the inside decore is cool witht he menu on the wall and a couple of black and white photos adorning other parts of the store.

Good slice....no oregano in front with the condiments if you l ike it like I do.

I called them and the guy remembered when I called the hour before and said no, I didn&#39;t order that I ordered a plain deep dish which is pan pizza. NO, I didn&#39;t. I know the difference I worked there and I know there are sometimes mistakes so I make sure I say chicago style. So I went in the next day to talk to the owner and explain what happened. He was also VERY rude to me and acted like I was dumb, didn&#39;t even apologize for his employees rudeness to me. When people had issues at the Rosati&#39;s in Yorkville the managers ALWAYS apologized no matter what. So they gave me a credit. I decided to call today and give them one last chance since I did have the credit. I called, said immediately I would like to order a CHICAGO STYLE DEEP DISH. The man (who ended up being the owner) said &#34;do you want the sauce on top or cheese&#34; I said sauce because that IS a chicago style. He started on this whole lecture about the difference in the two. I said &#34;I know sir please can you just order me the Chicago style&#34; he said &#34;I see the notes in your profile and last time blah-de-blah-de-blah&#34; &#34; I said look sir, I&#34;m just trying to order the pizza, if you want to give me lectures and be rude that I even was nice enough to give you business again then that is on you&#34; I don&#39;t get why he has to be so defensive I wasn&#39;t even going to bring up the last &#34;incident&#34; with him, just order the fricken pizza.

But the reason I&#39;m giving it a 3 is because of my friend. My friend ordered a BBQ beef burger and the guy at the counter said 10-12 min. The burger took 30 min to make and he didn&#39;t give my friend a bag. I would recommend calling ahead.

I&#39;ve had plain sausage before, also Sausage and pepperoni, also sausage and mushroom, also plain pepperoni.  Those, in my opinion, were all kind of bland. The 3 meat combo hit the spot for me."

I would never recommend this location to anyone!! I ask for the manager and Sam (his Name) could care less about my compliant. The turtle cheesecake was hard as a brick, it was not edible.

The manager, who occasionally works the register, is always pretty happy when we walk in. I have to admit, the service is a little slow sometimes, but I&#39;m always happy to get the pizza.

The pizza is great, but not amazing. Their crust is puffy, and the pizza is fresh 90% of of the time. (We&#39;re talking about the carry-out slices here. The whole pizzas are always fresh.) They put on a little too much sauce and cheese, (I&#39;m a fan of the thinly topped Ocean City MD boardwalk pizza.) but the flavor is nice. They are reasonably priced, and I recommend this if you&#39;re on the road or just want a slice of pizza. (The sausage isn&#39;t that great though. Don&#39;t get it, I beg you!)"

You can get pizza by the slice (sausage is good!) but they also have a TON of other menu options. The beef sandwhich is huge and really tasty with cheese and hot peppers. I also enjoy the buffalo chicken sandwhich. It comes plain, but the chicken has a nice flavor separate from the buffalo sauce they put on. 

They have a lunch special where you can get pasta of your choice (lasagna, mostaccioli, or spaghetti). You can also choose the eggplant parmigiana which is a very nice vegetarian option. The dish is HUGE plus it comes with garlic bread AND salad. It&#39;s enough to feed 3-4 children or 2 adults. It&#39;s only $7! 

The calzione is good, however takes longer to cook, so order ahead!

Overall, great food at really great prices!"

I&#39;ve been in the Midwest for two years and my fiancée and I try every Mexican restaurant we can (like once/month....if I could, it&#39;d be everyday....haha!). We came upon this gorgeous place a few months ago, but my stipulation is that I wanted nice weather to sit on the patio for this great visit. 

Fast forward to now: it&#39;s my birthday and I do Mexican food for my birthday every year. I finally got to sit on the patio at Yerbabuena!!! Today!! 

I ordered a Cadillac margarita. It was nice! Generally, margaritas lend me instant heartburn and this one did not. My fiancée knew I&#39;d want nachos to start, even though we had fresh, warm, and delicious chips and salsa to snack on. The nachos were the best nachos I&#39;ve ever had! We topped them with chicken and this chicken was the best and most moist chicken I&#39;ve ever had. I know, I know, I just said that.... But I was blown away. My fiancée, who is a tough critic and not a nacho lover, even thought they were great. I&#39;ll be honest, I was full then....but I had to keep going!

I ordered shrimp tequila Diablo (sauce on the side thanks to our wonderful and helpful server Arianette) and my fiancée ordered tacos (pineapple salsa rings a bell). We only ate half and have left overs for later. I think they churn out their own tortillas, which were delicious.  Shrimp was perfect. The guac was a tad bland, but if that&#39;s they only thing.....I&#39;m more than okay with it.  My fiancée and I will be returning to Yerbabuena for our following Mexican food cravings. I wish we&#39;d have went months ago, however it served for the perfect birthday meal."

I&#39;m super excited about the new location of this restaurant that will be opening up next door (to replace this location). Our waiter told us that the new restaurant location will have a large outdoor area and a more modern look. 

I feel like you really can&#39;t go wrong with any of the menu items here. Their chips are non greasy, which cannot always be said about some of the other Mexican restaurant chips I&#39;ve had. I&#39;ve had their daily specials, and they have been wonderful. Last time I had their jalapeno enchiladas and that was an awesome dish with a big kick to it. I highly recommend trying their enchiladas if you come here since they serve different types of enchiladas for all taste preferences. Also, don&#39;t forget to have a nice big margarita with your delicious dinner. I prefer their Cadillac margarita, but some of their other types are great too."

They have great combinations of flavors. My personal favorite is the honey chipotle chicken dish. The only complaint is have for the place is the size. The original place was very small and cramped so they moved next door. It&#39;s now two stories so they space has increased as a whole but the tables are still very close together. The last time I went they had to literally pull out the table so we could fit into the booth.

But here I ordered a combo and could only stomach one of the three items. Everything was either super bland or just... off in the seasoning department. For example, the chile relleno batter was oddly sweet and inside was a different cheese than I&#39;ve had at any other Mexican restaurant. The enchilada wasn&#39;t entirely hot and lacked salt or any spices. The only thing I ate were the rice and beans (fine) and the taco (also fine.) 

My fiancé got a seafood dish and was really impressed, so he had a different experience. I&#39;d say maybe the &#34;specialties&#34; menu section is better? That&#39;s where his came from.

The food is authentic and fabulous. The margaritas are strong and taste like actual margaritas - you can tell they are not made with any sugary store-bought mixes.

The management and staff are really nice-  they are all either part of the same family, extended family, or individuals who have worked for the restaurant for several years. I honestly can&#39;t say we&#39;ve really never had a bad (or mediocre) experience here. It&#39;s our Saturday night weekly spot after a long work week.
 
It&#39;s kind of been a little gem in Lisle for many years.  We really loved the ambience of their previous space... waiting for a table wasn&#39;t a big deal because you could order a drink at the tiny bar and inevitably start chatting with other diners that were also waiting. Our favorite spot to dine was outside, but even in the winter, it was a cozy atmosphere.

The new space is very nice and still offers outdoor dining.  With 2 levels, the restaurant now offers more dining space and 2 bars.  I think the staff has worked out the service challenges that a larger space and a higher volume of patrons create.  

Each menu items is delicious, and if you are particular about your margaritas, you will appreciate their Cadillac margaritas.  We recommend the Siete Leguas reposado tequila!

I&#39;m a tough critic of margaritas but these were super tasty. Not too sweet or sour. I also tried the red sangria (which was not even on the drink menu), but I wasn&#39;t a fan. Overall, I must say I will definitely go back when I have a craving for Mexican.

The food was exactly what I wanted- cilantro, mango, jalapeño and fresh ingredients. They probably have your typical taco and fajita stuff but the specials caught my eye.

I didn&#39;t order, but got to observe the table-side guacamole making, which looked fantastic. I would definitely come back for that! 

For food, I ordered the orange pineapple chicken tacos, topped with a wedge of avocado and a light sprinkling of cheese. FANfreakingTASTIC. Sweet, spicy, and loaded with chicken. You got 3 good sized tacos, which led to delicious leftovers to take home.

We had to stand up or move back and forth each time when someone was going to seat nearby (we had central table). I didn&#39;t feel comfortable.

I&#39;m not sure how reliable someone walking down the street can be so take that info with a grain of salt.
Anyway, this place is nice.... Clean, good atmosphere indoors.  Decent service too.  Last night and probably all of my previous visits I got a glass of sangria and chicken flautas.  Both were very good!!! There was a bit of a language barrier with our server but all went well with that ... Totally fine.

It&#39;s definitely worth a visit.  When parking, watch for &#34;15 minutes only&#34; signs ... There are a few down Main Street."

This particular establishment had some growing pains which is to be expected when they moved to a new location but overall the food quality, cleanliness, and menu selections are amazing still.

We were seated and didn&#39;t have to wait. We had a waitress that barely spoke any English (I believe she was Lithuanian?). I had asked for a frozen margarita and what I received was nothing like what a margarita should taste like. I told her I didn&#39;t want it and would just like a water instead, but she was confused by my request and didn&#39;t take the drink away (I later had to tell her again it didn&#39;t taste right and I didn&#39;t want it). The best part of the whole dinner was probably the quesadilla appetizer. The entrees were subpar at best. When we received our bill, the margarita was still on there and I had to explain to our waitress how I only took one small sip and didn&#39;t drink it after that. She was definitely not prepared to start waitressing on her own that night, which actually made me feel bad for her, as I know some people can be really nasty to bad waitresses.

First time at new place and will never return due to the HORRIBLE service.  Imagine it&#39;s a Thursday night at 8 pm.  Place is busy as usual.  Seated at a high top table-no problem.  Sat there for a good 10 minutes and watched all the other tables around us get serviced by the new staff.  I literally saw servers go to tables at least 3 times but not give service to us.  Frustrated I went to server and said we were leaving because no one serviced our table.  She gave me the stink eye as I walked out the door.  I will not go back again.  The great vibe they had previously is gone.  There are many other places to go in the area...this was a good hole in the wall that tried to take it to another level.  Epic fail.

Food was above average. I had a chimichanga my wife had mango shrimp and the kids had quesadillas. I had a nice marg...Cadillac with silver pardon. Pricey at $12 but good.  

Would have been 4stars if the host staff was not so disrespectfully, at least the head hostess. She was very rude to my wife and three small kids in tow (I was parking the car) saying the restaurant didn&#39;t take reservations for five and smashed our family at at four top. In fact our reservation WAS there but she didn&#39;t seem to care, had horrible tone and body language....like she hated being there. 
The entire place seemed cramp, not cozy. They are doing a million dollar expansion next door and better get their act together and be more welcoming to families, after all this is the burbs.  I&#39;m not going to drop $100 on a meal 
and be treated like that.  She ruined our meal and impression of this place. Will not be back and will definitely tell our friends.  Sadly our waitress was wonderful but it was lost on me/us."

Just kidding. :P It is our lunch spot though, due to proximity for both of us.

Unfortunately for both of us, the love ends at the Al Pastor tacos though. The rice is rather tasteless; the chips ordinary; the tamales disappointing; the salsa is canned tomatoes with some fresh cilantro and onion thrown in. This is a notch above straight up Gringo Mexican food, but a very small notch up.

And is it my pale skin, my freckled shoulders or my ginger hair that cause people to assume I don&#39;t like heat in my food? If you ask me how I want my guac and I say &#34;hot&#34;, don&#39;t be so cautious with that hot sauce; because, trust me, this Irish girl is one spicy lass! I most certainly can take the heat. 

Hubs is moving his office location soon and honestly, I don&#39;t know that after he moves, I would return just for tacos when I feel rather lackluster about the rest of the menu. I&#39;ve tried a lot in these three years. Nothing is bad; it&#39;s certainly an ok place to meet for lunch, but I&#39;d never come for a date. Maybe. Just maybe those Tacos Al Pastor will call me back on occasion though. They really are good.

The only thing I didn&#39;t care for, which, honestly, can&#39;t be avoided, is how crowded and noisy this place was on a Friday evening. I&#39;m just a little picky and don&#39;t care for noise and crowds, so I don&#39;t exactly fault the restaurant for that little tidbit.

It was a friend that we have gone out with many times and I thought they had the same restaurant tastes as me.

I tried calling to make a reservation.  It rang about 9 times before I got a message saying their phone had been out for the past few days and giving an alternate number to call.  I called the alternate number and it rang about 10 times before someone picked up.  Then I was told they only took reservations for parties of 6 or more.

We arrived around 6:30 on a Saturday night and it was busy which I took as a good sign.  We were told there was a 30 minute wait, so we headed back to the bar.  It was VERY warm, like I thought I was in Mexico!  Normally when it&#39;s warm outside, the a/c is cranked, but I couldn&#39;t even tell if it was turned on here.  The ceiling fans did not make a bit of difference.

Hubby and I both got margaritas which were not too sweet and not too tart.  They were also not full of any liquor and I sucked mine down like it was koolaid!  After we were seated we were brought chips and salsa.  The salsa was really runny, like tomato water and it just didn&#39;t have enough flavor.

I ordered tacos al pastor, the pineapple version and hubby got the carne asada.  My tacos al pastor did not have much pineapple in them and the carne asada just wasn&#39;t done right.

We didn&#39;t get any follow up and felt like there was a rush to get us out of there and have someone else take the table.

I really wanted to like this place, but I felt like it was one disappointment after another.  There were lots of happy people there, but I wasn&#39;t one of them."

I Left, then looked at menu, it said $9.95. Went back, she got manager/owner. He said prices went up and showed me a different to go menu and restaurant menu with higher price.

Started off with fresh, warm chips and salsa. The salsa was slightly chunky, the way I like it. You could tell made fresh that day.  Chips has just come out of the fryer and the kept coming. 

To drink we shared a pitcher of the Cadillac margaritas. They were great!! A little orangey from the triple sec and I could almost taste papaya.

He ordered the combo with streak, enchilada, and quesadilla.  Steak perfect medium.

I ordered the enchilada. They let me get three different kinds with different meats. A shrimp with orange mango salsa, chicken with mole, steak with salsa verde. I love the mole. Honestly, best I&#39;ve had in a long time. The verde was slightly too limey, and I like lime, but was still good. I also loved the orange mango sauce. It would be amazing on chicken wings.

Doesn&#39;t have to be 100% authentic, but should show some creativity. 

Yerbabuena is pretty close to ideal, I have to say.

Downtown Lisle is a cute little stretch just a block off Rt 53 - and Yerbabuena has a hopping patio this time of year, though we opted to sit inside. The decor is great, lots of purpley-blue and cool fixtures, not a screaming cheesy mariachi look at all. It&#39;s homey and cool at the same time.

Chips and salsa were provided promptly, and in fact we were offered many refills; there seemed to be a dedicated guy walking around with chips. The salsa was fresh and flavorful, though it had no heat whatsoever (which I understand may appeal to some, but a diced chile could go a long way). 

I ordered carnitas tacos off the specials menu and my husband got flautas, two beef and two chicken. My tacos came dressed with cheese and guacamole and a side of pinto beans and rice. The pinto beans were definitely homemade and delicious; the rice was nothing special (side note: every Latino person I&#39;ve ever known has made amazing rice ... why is almost all Mexican restaurant rice bland and boring?). The tacos were tasty with very tender chunks of pork.

Husband enjoyed his flautas and while our first water refill was a bit slow coming, the waitress picked it up a bit after that.

Tiny little nitpicky thing -- and it might even be just me: the carnitas were perfectly cooked and tasty. But a little lime juice and a touch of salt would&#39;ve put them over the edge. How about a lime wedge or two on the side? And the salsa -- also clearly made well, but the tiniest bit of heat would&#39;ve made it really good.

I like this place, and I think we&#39;ll be back, but I wish the food had wowed me instead of simply being &#34;pretty good.&#34; A few small tweaks and I&#39;d be raving."

It was slow and our waitress really didn&#39;t seem to get what we were telling her.  She brought the appetizer at the same time as the meal.  She tried to charge us for two appetiZers when we only ordered one...and then when the manager/owner came to discuss it, he was also arguing with us as if he had difficulty understanding that we ordered one appetizer...not two.

With all that being said though, the food was delicious.  I got a combo (enchilada, tostada and taco).  Everything was amazing!  I would definitely return and pray for a different waitress."

It is on the small side and fills up quickly at dinner time (I have not been here  for lunch) but they do take reservations.  Service is quick and very friendly.  Our entrees were served piping hot (which they should be).  Our entrees were delicious and not too spicy.  Selection is huge.  Average price per person with drinks and tip came to about $20.

Now, the location of the women&#39;s comfort station, smack dab in the dining room, is awkward.  To minimize viewing into the single stall, the door swings open away from  the wall.  This is also where the highchairs are stored.  So, you have to maneuver between the door and the highchairs to get in and to the poor people seated on that side, it minimizes their view into the facilities.  AWKWARD.

Now, improvements: supply small plates to enjoy the chips and salsa, otherwise everyone is dripping on the table.
Replenish the chips, a very small bowl of chips served with a huge bowl of salsa= lots of left over salsa and nothing to eat it with.
Serve enough guacamole to spread on the entire entree.  The little dollop did not make it through one quesadilla, never mind 3.
STRAWS.

Make those adjustments and it would be 5 star worthy."

Our comment while leaving was just that we were in no way impressed by any one aspect of the dining experience. The chips and salsa, the service, the food we ordered (enchiladas and a combo meal), the sides - none of them were stand-out. It was a bit pricey for the overall quality."

I also had several people tell me it was the best Mexican food in the area... So, I was expecting something really good and what I received when I arrived was a typical Mexican place that didn&#39;t have great chips and salsa. The salsa was very sweet and not very spicy which is not my idea of salsa. I had a burrito which was much smaller than i was expecting and left the table hungry but it had a good flavor for the most part. My fiancé had a quesadilla that came with guacamole and pico de gallo and it was pretty good except for the pico de gallo had no color or flavor to it...

I have zero complaints about the atmosphere or service but I was just expecting more from what everyone had said and I was expecting it to be cheaper than many of the menu items were. We will most likely try this place again but not anytime soon."

Whenever any friends or family want to do dinner in Lisle, our go to is ALWAYS Yerba Buena. It&#39;s within walking distance, it&#39;s in an awesome location if you want to take the train. The decor is warm, and the staff is always friendly.

Pro&#39;s:
-Awesome food. I&#39;m talking about food you crave when you haven&#39;t had it in awhile. I always get the enchiladas verdes, tastes so good! My husband usually tries different things (he&#39;s always been more adventurous) but when he can&#39;t decide, the burrito mole is his go-to.
- The quality of the food is top notch... veggies taste fresh, meats are always cooked to perfection... their beans are awesome!!
- Table side guac... fabulous
- Chips and salsa are perfect! I can&#39;t eat spicy, and the salsa is flavorful without being an attack on the palate. 
- Get a margarita... you will not be disappointed
- We do takeout a lot, they always get our order correct, and it tastes just as good as if we were eating in the restaurant

Cons
-When its busy, its BUSY. It can be hard to get a table, especially in the summer
- Sometimes the service is slow and it can be a bit of a bummer, puts a damper on a good night
- Their menu is so  large, it can be hard to choose sometimes. It&#39;s full of great things, but it can take a long time just to get through it!!
 - The bar is very small...

Overall, we love Yerba Buena, and will continue to come back time and time again!! It&#39;s nice to go somewhere where they know your name!"

The staff was very accomodating and went over-the-top to insure our large table was satisfied. Huge kudos for that on a busy Friday night. 
Although all the food was good, I often judge on value for cost. I felt the cost was high for an average Mexican meal. Portions were right sized, but the quality of the steak in tacos certainly did not warrant the menu cost. The guacamole was outstanding - the bright side of the food.
I certainly would not go out of my way to return for dinner, but would certainly meet friends here if that&#39;s what is suggested."

You can always tell a great Mexican restaurant by their chips, salsa, and of course their guac!  Check check and check!  Yerbabuena gets high marks on all three.

Not only do they rock the guac (p.s. love the fact they literally make it on your table), their food is plentiful and muy deliciosa!  Oh yeah, broke out the Spanish for this review... you know I&#39;m serious.  Their meats are oh so tender and are packed with flavor like they&#39;ve been cooking all day.  No doubt, very authentic. 

The only reason why I didn&#39;t dish out 5 stars was that they can get pretty busy and at times the service was a little slow.  But hey, once the weather is nice, everyone&#39;s all about meeting up with friends and family for some good eats!  I can&#39;t really blame the place for being so popular!"

Yerbabuena is one of those places that I really want to LOVE, but it just never quite gets there. After going there numerous times (my wife LOVES it), I think the reason, to me, is that it&#39;s somewhat bipolar: It is consistently, truly excellent at what it does well, and consistently very dissapointing where it falls short.

The good: 
- The salsa is tremendous. Perfectly done, not too hot, not too thin, no overpowering  ingredient, it just works beautifully. I&#39;d also say the sauces in general are top notch for the same reasons. 
- Quality of ingredients. The fish, steak, and pork cuts never fall short here. Very fresh, always consistent, and they make them a number of different ways. 
- Menu options. Recipes are very inventive and they manage to offer plenty of options without succumbing to redundancy. 
- Atmosphere is very nice. Good use of colors and decor in a very tasteful and inviting way. Outdoor patio is small, but pretty.

The bad:
- The service is quite dissapointing. Everyone is nice and pleasant, but very little attention is paid to you and you have to wait long stretches between food, drinks, and the bill regardless if the place is crowded or not. I know that outside of America this is fairly common, but we ARE in America and it&#39;s not up to said expectations.
- A good bit of flavor is lacking. While the quality of the food is high, there is often a distinct lack of seasoning, it is often bland. Mexican food is defined by bold flavors, so if anything I&#39;d expect them to be too strong, not the opposite!     
- The food is more often than not incorrect and/or substitutions and additions are not easily accommodated (they&#39;ll do it, it just seems to throw them for more of a loop than it should). This could fall under the service category I suppose, but this seems like an overall communication issue. 

I really hope they can improve on what they do well because it would definitely be a hidden gem if they do!"

I reached a new milestone with this place, as it is officially the worst Mexican food I have ever had. Took thirty minutes for someone to show up to take my order and I never saw her again until she brought me my beer and then the check. She never returned to ask me about my dinner at all.

The complementary watery salsa and stale chips did not start the night off very well. My beer took over thirty minutes to be delivered and I was a party of one. I ordered chicken and steak fajita and while I do expect some amount of grease, I did not expect my rice to be added to the same hot plate as the fajita mix. The rice did help soak up the grease, so I guess that was a plus, all though it was uneatable.

You usually see the fajita coming out, smoking hot and everyone warning you not to touch the plate. Mine arrived barely sizzling and downright cold. I would have sent it back, but my waitress was missing in action. The gentlemen in the table next to me, sent his back as soon as he got it as well and it was ice cold, but he managed to flag someone down. I would guess since I was alone, no one was very interested.

All the sides came out in two small dishes, so it was a few minutes to move everything around the table, so I actually had a place to eat. The chicken and steak, must have sat for a very long time, and it became a good bit rubbery and was cold to the touch. I would think there are better places in the area and certainly hope so, that way the 4 and 5 start reviewers can actually taste good Mexican food."

Still excellent.  Consistent quality and the owner really cares about his guests.  He is always adding new items and improving the experience for his friends.  His Carnitas served as a special and the Chorizo and Cameron dish also served as a special, are examples of real Mexican, homemade and flavorful.  Still the best chips around - the guacamole table side is very good, better than I can make at home.  His house Margarita is awesome - ask for the Cadillac and you won&#39;t be disappointed.  He makes the best Tres Leche I&#39;ve had - a hometown recipe.

Still a great restaurant.  Wonderful people - the owner, wait staff and guests. I am always looking forward to my next visit to Yerbabuena."

We&#39;ve gone here twice to give the place a chance and we will never return. We were seated in the very pretty outdoor seating about 9pm on a lovely Friday evening. We waited 15 minutes for the waitstaff to acknowledge us- but OY... it wasn&#39;t our waitstaff who arrived - but rather the waitress who previously had the table and came to pick up the payment folder on the table from the previous guests. (Ok- it&#39;s a nice night - and maybe our waiter did not know we were his table. We&#39;re cool. It&#39;s a great night.) So... We continue to wait. A waiter finally shows up - takes our drink and food order - and we .... wait and we wait.  Drinks get dropped off but we never had any chips on our table during the whole meal. Food gets dropped off. And that&#39;s that. Really- that&#39;s THAT! Never were asked if we wanted another drink (which we really did!!!) nor if the food sucked. The guy just disappeared. Eventually the waiter slide the check on the table while we were talking and he never returned. We finally handed our money to a different waiter to handle for us, 

As for the food- barely adequate. I had flautas that were so hard I couldn&#39;t cut them with my knife. You know how at Mexican restaurants you usually have an enormous plate of rice and beans? Not at this place - 2 tablespoons of each which, I guess, helps you to watch your figure! My husband&#39;s enchiladas were unremarkable - again with two tablespoons of rice and beans so you can watch your diet (at Mexican restaurant!!!). 

My recommendation - go to one of the hundreds of other great other restaurants in the area."

They had some more exciting looking items on their menu - chicken with mango, fish with a tropical fruit salsa...almost Caribbean in feel, but I wasn&#39;t in the mood for it that night, so I went with flautas. So I&#39;m totally willing to be told that, like Mi Lupita in St. Louis, the gringo stuff is just that, and the specialty dishes are where the magic happens. 

The flautas were piping hot, tasty and reasonably well seasoned. Came with decent beans, the standard rice, and some good guac, which wasn&#39;t cut with white onion as it so often is. Really no complaints, but nothing exceptional here. I do want to say that their salsa is simply terrible - tomato sauce out of a can with not a hint of spice or chile pepper, but plenty of fresh diced onion. 

Service was fine, price seemed reasonable. I would go back to Yerbabuena, as aside from the salsa, it&#39;s fine. But there are so many other better Mexican options in Chicago...I wouldn&#39;t make this my first stop."

Don&#39;t get me wrong the atmosphere was loud and lively but it was a tight squeeze in there. The table side guacamole was great with the warm chips, but it definitely lacked flavor! Especially since we ordered it medium and I still had to add salt and lime juice. Friends ordered the sangria and it was bitter. Isn&#39;t sangria supposed to be on the sweet side? Horchata was fine, nothing special. The service was on the slow side, but they were packed that evening, but they did their best. The restaurant itself is small and there were a lot of waiters back at the bar and in front of the restaurant. If there was a fire, people would be running over each other to exit the place. I ordered the tilapia tacos for dinner. Decent size tacos... Meal came with 3 tacos and rice. The rice lacks flavor big time!! The fish was cooked perfectly,  but eaten by it self it also lacks flavor. Thank goodness for the Pico di gallo and the sauces that accompanied our meals. I&#39;d still give this place another chance and try something else off the menu though. but it wouldn&#39;t be my first choice to eat at for Mexican"

We went for lunch. I find their prices to be more reasonable (as they should be) and it was good. I ordered a mashed potato enchilada and a regular with their rancheras sauce which was excellent. The sauce was my favorite thing! My meal was around $8-$9 and came with beans and rice (and free chips/salsa). 

The beans, while not refried, are vegetarian, as is the rice. It&#39;s made with vegetable stock. Our server was quite knowledgeable and attentive. I thought they were great and I was thrilled that being a veggie, I could partake.

The chips and salsa are just mediocre to me. This might be strange, but I think the restaurant should consider giving out less salsa. I know, weird. But the bowl is huge compared to most places. Like for 4 people, the big bowl is okay, but for 2 people, it went almost untouched. Actually, I think we ate a total of 3 chips. Perhaps they should ask if you want complimentary chips and salsa? More a suggestion for the restaurant because people tend to eat less at lunch time. Normally I&#39;m all for the freebies, but don&#39;t like that they had to throw out our entire bowl of chips and salsa when we left.

For the most part, I think the flavor is the best in the area. While a little pricier than I like to pay for Mexican, I&#39;d say it&#39;s worth it for the quality of the food."

We have had too many dishes from their menu to list, but I can tell you that we have never had a dish that we didn&#39;t like.

We ate al fresco. The air was dry, the breeze light and the sun was not a threat.

Like another reviewer (Frank M.), I am surprised that this place so many high marks. I just don&#39;t see or taste the justification.

I ordered the soft corn shell chicken tacos.  The waitress was very attentive and cheerful. We always had chips and salsa on the table and plenty to drink.

Our meals came out rather quickly and looked fine.  However, it was the blandest Mexican food that I have ever tasted.  At one point, I was really was not sure if I was eating shredded chicken or fish. I don&#39;t recall shredded meat in the last taco that I had eaten.

The restrooms and inside of the place looked clean and bright.

Nearby parking was in easy reach at this time of day.

I imagine this more as a lunch place.  Or, perhaps as a quick choice for a weary commuter getting off the train and trying to get a quick bite before the next day&#39;s grind.

I probably will not return there for a second try."

High points include fresh guacamole made tableside and a willingness on the part of the chef to experiment with mangoes, fish and cilantro.

Not my first choice for &#34;authentic Mexican&#34; but a local, comfortable staple that knows what the customer base is looking for. The Camarones diablo and Tacos al Pastor con Pineapple Suiza are executed well and make for great comfort food around Cinco de Mayo. 

Consider getting a dessert to share. I have been pleasantly surprised by these before."

There were groovy wood paneled walls and a boogie-down salad bar. When&#39;s the last time you came across a dedicated salad bar?? Apparently this city gal is missing out. I was digging the charming, throwback atmosphere as well as the spectacular nature view with the Fox River dam and bike trail just outside my booth window.

I am a big fan of homemade, classic corn beef hash as well as sweets and this diner did not disappoint. My sunny side up eggs were perfect and the pumpkin pancake satisfied my sweet tooth. I&#39;m pretty sure the tasty berry spread served with my toast was made in-house.

Lots of cute seniors and locals about. The servers and restaurant staff were kind and efficient. I saw some folks digging into the chicken and dumplings Monday special. It looked homemade and delicious. There were huge, handmade caramel apples in the bakery area for fall. Regretting not taking one of those babies home!

I can see why this place is local establishment. Wish I could come back and try more items, but I was only in the area to get my bun fixed at the Fox Valley Animal Welfare League (see my other review) and don&#39;t own a car living in the city. Sometimes I tire of urban dwelling high-maintenance yuppies and ghetto trash constantly blabbing on their cell phones. None of that in this old fashioned establishment. It kinda restored my faith in the general goodness of people. Maybe I will move to this peaceful countryside paradise someday!"

Days are much more consistent than nights. 
Breakfast generally takes a long time to get the food. 
The food is good and generally homemade. 
The service is very spotty. We&#39;ve had great servers and we&#39;ve had terrible servers.
The one egg omelette is my wife&#39;s favorite. I usually have the coffee cake slice and eggs with the ground steak patty.
Beware of the uncovered samples on the cash counter. I&#39;ve seen kids touching and returning and people sneezing on them.
Disgusting!
The family management is lackluster at best. The staff is frumpy and generally 
messy.
Most disappointing is the disconnect of the bakery to the restaurant. You would expect foods that complement the bakery.
Like croissant sandwiches and baked items. Not so.
Traditional breakfast with toast, hash browns etc. imagine a baked hash brown casserole as an option. Or a baked pecan roll pancake breakfast.
Lost opportunity."

I had trout and my husband the prime rib. Most places do not offer prime on a Friday early in the afternoon. He ordered med rare and that is exactly as it came. Beautiful prime, exactly as it should taste.  We will be going back for that. I ordered trout and rice with squash side. It was very good as well. The squash looked to be a full quarter, baked with a tad of brown sugar. Trout was very good, but will probably order something else next time. The bread basket offers a small sampling of their bakery items and the bakery counter was bustling the entire time we were  there. 
The menu is extensive,  and a holiday special page added to the back page. No matter your diet, you will find something here.

I didn&#39;t know what kind of expectations to have for an establishment that&#39;s clearly a local favorite, and has been around for quite awhile, but I was impressed by their breakfast.  I had the Country Eggs Benedict, an English muffin with poached eggs and sausage.  I could be wrong, but the sausage patties looked homemade judging by the not-so-perfectly-round shape and the spices that gave it lots of flavor.  The eggs were cooked perfectly.  The portion was huge, you won&#39;t go hungry here.

We shared one of the Maple Walnut danishes which was also pretty damn good.  They were out of Pecan Rolls, but we quickly forgot about that while eating the Maple Walnut instead.  You definitely want to order something from their sweet case while you&#39;re here.

This location has a full service, dine-in restaurant, unlike the bakery-only location on Galena in Aurora.  The restaurant interior is bland, with banquet-style tables and chairs, but there&#39;s a pretty view of the park and river from their windows.

On several other occasions, I&#39;ve picked up yummy desserts in their bakery. They make special cakes, pies, cookies, donuts, you name it.

As soon as my friend mentioned the bakery, I was in. It is so hard to find an old-fashioned neighborhood bakery these days.

The bakery is worthy of 4-stars. The restaurant is worthy of 3-stars.

My friend and I met at 3:00pm on a weekday. I arrived before my friend and had the pleasure of chatting with the hostess. She recommended some of the more popular menu items, as well as explaining the daily specials. The restaurant was 1/3 full of diners, almost all elderly folks, which I was happy to see. It was quiet and peaceful. No loud children. No jerks talking on their cell phones. From overhearing conversations between the staff and customers, this place really seems to have a neighborly feel to it... the type where you run into all your neighbors, everyone knows everyone.

I was undecided between a classic home-cooked dinner, the daily special, or a cheeseburger. I asked our waitress (a young girl) for her recommendation. I was shocked when she recommended the cheeseburger over the dinner entrees and daily specials. It made me wonder... how bad is the food if she thinks the cheeseburger is the best item on the menu?!?! Per her recommendation, I ordered the cheeseburger, which was a disappointment. The burger meat patty itself tasted great. It was topped with the lackluster sliced onion, sliced tomato, and a huge wedge of iceburg lettuce. But it all went south the minute I picked it and the top and bottom bun dissintegrated in my hands. Seriously dissintegrated, to the point where my fingers were holding the burger itself and not the bun. It sadly was not an enjoyable meal.

While we were sitting there conversating, I noticed how dirty the carpet was. The floor was full of food crumbs and such which seemed to be there all day since breakfast-time. The carpet needed some serious sweeping.

After our meal, I purchased a pound of butter spritz cookies with colorful sprinkles on top, and frosted smiley face cookies. Wow, so yummy, reminded me of my younger days when we would go to Carneys Bakery in downtown Wheaton. Harner&#39;s cookies are so much better than anything you purchase at Jewel, Meijer, Walmart, etc. After that, my friend and I sat outside on the benches and enjoyed the beautiful weather. For two hours, we watched as all the elderly folks went in for dinner, and came out again. Per my friend, weekends are really busy here, with the grandparents, parents, and children dining together.

Recap: This is a plain, simple, no frills, mom-n-pop diner. Not great, not bad. Personally, I would eat here again because I enjoy the elderly crowd, and the peace and quiet. And my mouth is salivating at the thought of all those bakery goods -- yummy :)  Plus, the view of the river is nice."

I could see from the street heads lined up by the window reassuring my hungry paranoia there would be no place to sit as I was starving!

Pulled in found a spot in the main lot and walked in the front door to be hit right in the face with the sweet smell of baking dough and a delightful aroma of cinnamon and sugar. It was a wonderful smell which made me fee like I had just stepped into my grandmothers during a family holiday.

To my amazement, I was greeted and seated immediately. I looked around and realize just how large the dining area was. Took my seat and my drink order was taken immediately and I was presented my menu.

I scanned my surroundings and realized they had employed an entire army of service personnel. There were servers coming and going and bussers zipping here and there...It was a dynamic ballet of people coming and going, I was quite impressed to see such an orchestration of service.

I ordered the biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs and a side of corned beef hash and a tall glass of milk to go with it along with a side of cinnamon raisin toast.

Every piece of that order, every single element, blew me completely away. I&#39;m willing to bet every single piece of that breakfast that could be scratch made, was.

The flavor of the sausage in the gravy was unbelievable! I&#39;ve never had such a wonderful sausage gravy...it was like I had to do a double take to believe what I was eating. It was gravy, but it was somehow as light as the biscuits they covered! The biscuits were amazing, light, fluffy and paired against the best gravy I&#39;ve ever eaten was like something from a dream....It was insanely delicious!

The corned beef was made with corned beef which hadn&#39;t lost its texture or flavor amongst the other ingredients and was nowhere near greasy as you will find in many corned beef hash dishes.

The cinnamon raisin toast was the perfect compliment to the meal without having something so overly sweet it left you feeling nauseated. It was light, it was crisp on the edges and slapped with some butter and home made jam....like I said, it was the perfect end to the meal. 

I loved every bite of what I ate.
I loved the waitress willingness to work out what sides she could substitute for us in place of what was listed.
I loved that when she was up for a break, that she let us know and I loved that she also let us know who was covering for her in case we needed anything else. 

The service here was warm, welcoming, thoughtful and above all spot on in every respect. 

Given the amount of people they had packed in the place and how well the service was presented is a testament to the talent they employ at the front of the house and the back of the house!

My hat is off to all of you and I thank you all for providing me with such a great experience!

I will most certainly be back for more and I will bring friends too!"

Having previously liked this place, I hesitated on a review.  As for the restaurant, the salad bar seems overpriced for such a small selection.  The soups are inconsistent.  The chicken gumbo is in edible with fatty chicken.  On our last visit, my daughter ordered the chicken and dumplings.  Again, the chicken was in edible and fatty.  Here&#39;s the real oddity- they were out of vegetables.  Instead of coming up with a more feasible replacement (potatoes, soup, dessert), they offered beets.  Strange.  On to the bakery.  We used to stop frequently for apple fritters, cinnamon twists and donuts.  Everything has been stale the last 2-3 times we&#39;ve been there.

The waitress didn&#39;t seem that friendly at first, but seemed to be the happiest after I asked if they still had prime rib (available Fridays and Saturdays).

They also had fresh mix greens, pasta salad, coleslaw, potato salad, broccoli salad, and a couple of soups.

The prime rib was juicy and tasty!  It also comes with 2 sides.  How am I supposed to eat all this?  Guess what, it was also good as left overs.

Though there was a wait, it was well worth it. Imagine when you were 9 years old and your grandparents took you to their favorite breakfast place - this will remind you of it. Decor is what your grandma would love, which means you will love it just for the nostaligia of it.

We really enjoy ourselves there.  The food is delicious and the service is quick and friendly.  Kari, one of the waitresses, has remembered that I always order orange juice with my breakfast, that my husband likes LOTS of coffee, and that we prefer to sit next to the windows that look out on the Fox River.  Kari is an excellent waitress, but everyone there has given us great service. The man who seats us is friendly and works at accomodating us.  Both women I&#39;ve seen running the cash register at front are lovely folks.  The bakery is great, too, and I&#39;ve had brownies and turnovers I&#39;ve bought there to die for!

Your mouth instantly waters. Their bakery is definitely work checking out and I saw a sign that said some bakery items were 1/2 price after 6pm. 

The dining area is reminiscent of an old diner with stools to sit at or tables and booths. I went for dinner and there were many seniors there, so you know the food was good and the prices were excellent. 

They bring a complimentary bread basket with some of their various rolls and some nut bread that is just amazing. It&#39;s worth picking up a loaf to take home.

I just had the salad bar this time and the topping selection for the greens is minimal, but your main choices (bacon bits, cucumbers, tomatoes, cheese, croutons, etc). It also includes a random soup which happened to be a white bean and was delicious.

They also have side choices of cottage cheese, 3-bean salad, noodle salad, kidney bean salad and my favorite... the broccoli salad! 

They have many other items on the menu and daily specials. I&#39;ll definitely explore the menu more on my next visit."

I had the classic one egg omelette and that with some raisin toast and hashbrowns was more than enough for me (though the glutton in me wanted like a 10 egg omelette).

I would have given them 5 stars, but service can be a little slow. Last time we went, I had to ask for refills on my coffee. For a large group of coffee drinkers, a coffee pot should just be left at the table in my opinion. It&#39;s an old family restaurant so the decor isn&#39;t terribly updated."

We recently moved to this area and so this place has been on our list of local places to try. Hands down the best breakfast place I&#39;ve been to. It&#39;s very reasonably priced, if not on the cheaper end of breakfast food (like butterfields-way over priced). We came in about 9:00am on a Sunday, in which a good breakfast place probably is packed at that time. Plus there was some kind of race going on so maybe more people then normal stopping in. You can sit down and eat here or a lot of people just grab pastries and go. They have 50% anything fried after 2:00pm (pastries to grab and go) which is a super good deal as well. The reason I&#39;m giving 4 stars and not 5 is because we came in a sat at a table for about 10-15 minutes before even a server coming by. I know it&#39;s a busy place but we had our two year old with us so it was super hard to keep him occupied when we couldn&#39;t even get a server to get him a donut to keep him sustained. We ordered our food and that took quite a bit of time as well, so my husband actually took our little one outside to keep him busy. Overall the food was delicious, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll sit down and eat though. My best bet is to grab the food and take it home, or near the river since the river is right next to this place. I would say if you have time and are super patient aren&#39;t &#34;starving&#34; then definitely come to this place and sit down if not then at least stop in and grab a pastry."

My Uncle, who lives in Aurora, has been raving about Harner&#39;s for years. I had heard through the grapevine that Harner&#39;s was the go to bakery in the far West suburbs. The only way to judge this is of course by sampling the goods!

Pazcki day is one of my favorite days of the year. The only time I&#39;ve missed it was when I was a Freshman in college. I just didn&#39;t know where to find a bakery in my college town (pre-yelp days). Although I could have gone to the local grocer, I ended up being busy or something. NEVER AGAIN.

My Uncle put in an order for 3 Poonchkys for me. Chocolate Creme with Chocolate frosting, Apple with Cinnamon, and Cream Cheese with Chocolate frosting.

I&#39;m usually a  huge chocolate fan, but my favorite out of the 3 was the apple! It was filled with fried apples. Not overly stuffed, but perfectly filled. As for the chocolate creme (their spelling, not mine. I hate it spelled like that), it was very good. I&#39;ll be honest, the chocolate creme was not as filled as the apple. As for the cream cheese, it was my  least favorite, but that&#39;s not to say it wasn&#39;t good.

I was very pleased that for 3.75 I was apple (able; it&#39;s a joke) to purchase these. I know I will definitely be back next year. I&#39;m hoping to go to the bakery/restaurant well before that, though! Highly recommended!"

The prices are, dare I say, almost too reasonable. I went here after work to pick up a couple of donuts. Needless to say, I left with a dozen. After leaving, I stopped at the gas station and noticed that the donuts there were MORE than the freshly baked Harners variety. Get out! I do believe Harner&#39;s supplies some local convenience stores with donuts, but these weren&#39;t them. Harpers has a distinct look about them, and better taste. Anyway, aside from the goodies, the restaurant is wonderful as well. All home cooked fresh style food, just like their donuts. They have daily specials and a soup and salad bar. Their corned beef is as tender as a the day is long. But this is just to name one of their enticing eats. One last note.. donuts are half price after 6pm during the week.

That I did, several weeks ago. It was lunchtime, and I was surprised to see how busy it was. Harner&#39;s is not just a bakery! It&#39;s a great location for the start (or end) of a long bike ride, and my guess is that many had that same thought. 

I walked in for sweets only...walking out with more than I expected, for less than I expected! Under $1/item, and some very large and gourmet-esque.

Warm or hot water does not affect me but they charge me $0.95. I feel this discriminates people who are inconvenienced. The waiters/waitresses do not mention this charge for warm or hot water. I did not even see it in the menu.  Yet I have been charged for it in the past. If Harner&#39;s wants to keep costs down, ask all the patrons if they want water.

I&#39;m sorry to be a Debbie downer, but this place is average at best.

All the locals from around here love this place.  They put it in such high regard.  But it&#39;s no more then a family restaurant that has mildly good food.

I&#39;ve gone here at least a half dozen times, thinking that I must be the one that is wrong.  But, besides having a good bakery they are mediocre.

Portion sizes seem to be OK, but they don&#39;t blow you away.  The food seems alright, but can&#39;t see them winning some prize for it (I&#39;m sure they have now that I said that, but I wouldn&#39;t have given it to them.).

Just Average.

I was happy to see that they had both daily specials as well as a list of monthly specials to choose from.  I went with a Ruben sandwich.

High school girl with blond hair in pony tail and bad make up (bright blue eyeliner not applied well), stared at us when we walked in and didn&#39;t smile or say hello. They had a variety of bakery items and we didn&#39;t see donuts. After a few minutes of looking I asked if they had donuts.

On a random search this morning I found Harner&#39;s! We typically go out for breakfast when my parents are leaving to go back to Indy after a visit.  I decided that this was the place!

I had the Country fried steak, 2 eggs, toast &amp; hash browns for $8.25.  The breading on the steak was nicely seasoned and light.  It wasn&#39;t heavy or oily at all.  I was pleased and I love places with great sausage gravy.  Theirs isn&#39;t on the &#34;great&#34; side, but it was definitely on the &#34;good&#34; list!

Dad had the Homemade corned beef hash, 2 eggs and toast for $7.25.  Not many places make their own corned beef hash!  This was a really great homemade version!  Dad was please and I will definitely be going back for it!

Mom had the Vegetarian 1 egg omelet with hash browns and one blueberry pancake for $5.95.  Mom was impressed with the fact that they make 1 egg omelets!  She eats like a bird and refuses to eat leftovers like Dad and I love to do!  She was quite pleased with the blueberry syrup for her blueberry pancake too!

I will not go so far as to say that the coffee cake made me weep tears of joy - though poetic - it was fantastic, if a little indulgent, but what the hell, it&#39;s the weekend and you probably deserve it. It was extremely rich and decadent, with generous portions, and if you can stomach liberal &#34;paula deen&#34; amounts of butter and sugar - well as t.s. elliott states, &#34;Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.&#34; totally appropriate use of a meaningful quote on a food review...

The coffee is not great - it does kind of taste like airline coffee, but maybe I&#39;m just a stuck up snob who forgot that some of us came from humble beginnings and that sometimes, coffee that doesn&#39;t cost $3-5 a cup is okay. It&#39;s good. It&#39;s enough. Especially when you have the luxury of not needing the caffeine high to get through a crazy day...and can slow down, even for a moment.

The strength of my experience here was the amazing service. The warm smiles. The coffee never half full before being refilled. The genuine desire to make sure my friend and I had everything that we needed. Midwestern warmth.

The biscuits and gravy were good. I got the half order, so a little disproprotionate ratio of gravy to biscuits (my bad), the eggs were nothing to write home about, just...eggs. The pancakes were great. Don&#39;t quote me on this, even though it&#39;s now written down, but the butter was fresh - My imagination is that it was churned in the backroom, like how we used to do during field trips to Naper Settlement, I digress - anyways, am I the only one who hates those butter packages with the gold peel off lids where the butter is almost frozen and its impossible to spread on anything, especially pancakes, and just starts tearing away at the fluffiness like a rock on rye *end rant*  anyways, they were wonderful, not too rich, not too bland, and just enough uncooked batter to remind you that this was homemade, son.

my only regret is that I was so full after this meal that I had no room for donuts afterwards, which I hear are great - and looked great. The meal was incredibly affordable as well. I think it was less than $15 for everything, which is unbelievable for the amount of food I ordered. Anyways, thank you."

The bakery however was a different story. 

There is nothing fancy about the way the place looked but they had treats. 

I went into looking for an apple fritter...I didn&#39;t find any but they had an assortment of other goodies. I ended up ordering a caramel cinnamon roll with Carmel spread all across the top (Imagine a traditional roll but with a caramel topping).  I was going to eat them after my bike ride. 

I ordered 2 thinking that they would be small....uhm no the 2 pieces that the nice lady cut me were ginormous. I barely got through one of them after my ride where normally I am pretty ravenous. The caramel topping was delicious and the insides were nice soft with just the right amount of spices. I will be coming back here through the fall for teat and yumminess...

The woman who helped me wasn&#39;t overly fake helpful but just enough without feeling rushed. 

The parking is kind of a nightmare...I wish they had a place just for bakery customers as trying to get parking for less than 10 minute trip is a little ridiculous here ( I came around noon which is probably not the best time n a Sunday...still dedicated parking to the bakery would be nice. 

Regardless I will be back for more goodies."

Them new fangled donut places popping up all over should be schooled by Harner&#39;s.  This place has been in the bakery and donut business for decades.  This is the real deal folks.  Home made and delish.

At breakast, make sure to either get your biscuits grilled or get any of their made in house breads, hand sliced and toasted.  Comfort food at it&#39;s best.

This ain&#39;t no fancy schmancy dining place.  This is downhome cooking.  Think of a Wisconsin Supper Club and you pretty much have Harner&#39;s, right down to the cheesy salad bar.  Love it!

Try to snag a table by the window so you have a pretty view of the river anytime of the year.

If you&#39;ve never done the pig roast or the fried perch special on Friday, you&#39;re missing out. The salad bar is straight out of a Wisconsin lodge, but has the key items. Their fresh homemade salads make a great meal, along with two great soups. I challenge you not to take the plate of pulled pork home, the first Friday of each month.

One of these days I will try their prime rib. They have a special everyday and sure... it&#39;s a huge senior hang out, as they open everyday at 5:30 am. They have a great long counter and the bakery items will be screaming for you as you leave.

Feel free to walk in and ask for your sweets before you sit down and remember ... &#34;Life is uncertain, eat desert first.&#34; Save time to take a short walk down to the dam on the Fox River.

I had a doctors appointment on the area, so I dropped in yesterday.  I got a glazed yeast ring, a chocolate-frosted cake donut, and an apple fritter (don&#39;t worry, I didn&#39;t eat them all - just sampled each with a bite or two).  :-)

These donuts are slightly above average.  They are fresh, definitely homemade, and overall pretty good.  But they aren&#39;t great - they&#39;re a bit sickening sweet, and the apple fritter was not like most fritters I&#39;ve had (they were lightly fried/barely brown, quite doughy and lacking apples).

It&#39;s a step up from Dunkin Donuts, or even the average grocery chain - but there are definitely better options out there.  Busy Bee (Downers Grove) or Webers (near Midway) would be a good alternative to this place."

They serve &#34;the basics&#34; for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They are fairly solid and consistent, the kind of neighborhood place we all want nearby. And their bakery products are good. Nothing fancy or elaborate, just a good family-style restaurant.

My complaint - hence the 3 stars - is the cleanliness and decor. I&#39;ve seen dust and cobwebs on light fixtures and window treatments. Some booths have ripped upholstery and chipped table tops. The decor is tired, dated, and frumpy. The ceiling has lots of water stains. Before you think I&#39;m superficial, let me just say that appearances and especially cleanliness absolutely matter when it comes to restaurants.  We eat with our eyes, or so I&#39;m told. Whenever I&#39;m there, I feel uncomfortable and a little depressed. It doesn&#39;t have to be glamorous decor, but maybe it&#39;s time for an update.

I&#39;m a breakfast food person.  This place makes me crazy with excitement whenever I walk in there.  The fresh baked goods and the complimentary cookies while you wait for a table are enough to get you begging for food.

Every now and then after we eat our brunch we&#39;ll buy a pecan crunch coffee cake.  The coffee cake is so rich and dense that you&#39;d think it was Kim Kardashian.  I&#39;m pretty old fashioned with my cookies so I&#39;m a big fan of the shortbread cookies with the cherry cordial on top.  It reminds me of my child hood when my mother used to buy buckets of those Maurice Lennell cookies (if you&#39;re from Chicago, you BETTER know what those are).

We enjoy eating at the restaurant as well and being able to look out the window to the Fox River (a perk that I think most people take for granted).  They are a farm restaurant where everything is made fresh from scratch EXCEPT English Muffins and Bagels.

The essential breakfast ham, sausage and bacon they serve is exceptional.  I personally love nothing more than an order of biscuits and gravy with that spicy breakfast sausage.  Not to mention you have a choice between a 1 or 3 egg omelet which I love.  The 1 egg omelet is perfect for me and you can&#39;t get those kind of portions anywhere else.  Make sure no matter what you order you get the raisin toast at least once.  It&#39;s pretty much like a dessert covered in frosted glory and it&#39;s too much food but it just tastes SO DAMN GOOD.  The homemade jelly they serve with every breakfast meal is pretty much my favorite EVER.

However I have not tried anything other than breakfast because I&#39;m pretty much a breakfast freak.  I can&#39;t give an honest 5 stars if I haven&#39;t tried a good portion of the menu."

And for me, the geographical Center of Chicago is either near 31st and Cicero, where the original Home Run Inn is, or 16th and Wesley in Berwyn, where the original Salerno&#39;s was. 
For the lofty pizza reputation Chicago has, there sure is a lotta shitty pie around. My wife is from NewYork, and thinks Sbarro&#39;s is fab. Damned Ketchup bread to me. I can&#39;t believe Dominos or Pizza Hut have a toehold here at all. (Sbarro&#39;s is NOTHING like good NYC pie, IMHO)
And woe be unto you if you ax for Anchovies on your &#39;Za. (As I do) at many places. 
I&#39;ve lived in the far burbs for about 15 years now and always looked at the neon temple that is Spizzico with a slightly jaundiced eye. The bright and colorful lights seem to scream &#34;cheap&#34; is what&#39;s on sale here, and for those prices, don&#39;t expect flavor.
One night, wife and I were coming home from who-knows-what and it was near midnight. We didn&#39;t want Denny&#39;s or iHop. &#34;Spizzico is open&#34; said intrepid Missus.
I anticipated a pre-fab dough disc with concentrated Tomato soup for sauce, plastic cheese and mystery meat sausage.
But!
I was struck by the old-school Pizza joint smell when I walked through the Spizzico portal. Hmm!! Smelled splendid! Smelled REAL!
I ordered the Wife&#39;s half extra chiz and other half Spinach. I got Sausage and Anchovies.
Fine old-style thin Chicago Pizza!
No wonder when you learn this is an outpost of a long time Elmwood Park Pizza joint.
And that&#39;s good enough pedigree for me. For a West-Side boy, sometimes nothin&#39; will do &#39;cept old-school, and Spizzico&#39;s is it. Fine Salads and Sandwiches too.
Look past the garish neon and follow your nose!"

I&#39;ve driven past this place while they were working on the building for the past 2-3 months.  They finally opened up, and I decided to give them a try.  They are offering pizzas at a low enough price to make me think twice about going in.  I with I had thought a third time.

The owner was working in the kitchen.  He came out to talk to a few customers in the waiting/ordering area.  He made two very large claims.  First, he said that he is making the best pizza in the area.  I ordered the pizza and it was horrible.  The sauce had an odd seasoning mix and the crust had almost no flavor.  I think the Pizza Express down on New York St. is serving the same pizza.

There were two people in this shop trying to order chicken wings.  They asked for 10 wings, half buffalo and half parmesan.  They said this wasn&#39;t possible and that they would have to be done in quantities of 10.  They then ordered 35 wings (a standard quantity on their menu) and asked for 10 buffalo,15  parmesan, and 10 lemon pepper.  They were told that the 10, 20, and 35 quantities had to be ordered all the same type.  They couldn&#39;t order 20 wings and split it in 10s.  They had to order two 10 piece orders at a higher cost.

At this point the guys tell the cashier that they&#39;re new and are going to lose a lot of business for being inflexible.  This is when the owner comes out and talks about how he is making the best pizza in the area and that his wings are so good that people keep coming back to try the other flavors.  He claims that there is no reason to change the policy on wing flavors.

Long story short (too late), the food was horrible, management feels that they are better than the customers, and both the parking and waiting is problematic due to space constraints.  Never going back.


Incidentally, I notice there is a place with the same name in Elmwood park.  The two places seem unrelated."

But maybe it wasn&#39;t the best idea on my part to get a pizza to go on a ninety degree day. The pizza was made fresh as soon as we ordered it, but it was a bit soggy. We also ordered a twenty piece wings. Half lemon pepper, half buffalo. They didn&#39;t have breading, just chicken and sauce-not a bad thing. Pretty good.

Apparently on Tuesday you get 20% off your meal in the dining room though. How odd. The craft beer selection is a bit small, with a few IPAs, a radler, and some Belgians. I wish they had more beers on tap, but oh well. They have quite a few wines, though perhaps their bartenders need a little bit more time to learn the products and make recommendations as he faltered when another patron asked.

The dining staff was very professional, attentive and courteous. 

The gnocchi is made in house and very good, though the portion size is a bit small.

I ordered their special which was a seafood risotto. Presentation is nice. It has mussels, clams, and shrimp over a bed of risotto with a light sauce. Most of the clams had fallen out of their shells, the mussels were falling apart, and the shrimp was just slightly overcooked. Flavor was good, but I think the seafood may have been just a little past prime. All in all, not bad, but not great. The price was a shocker too. I probably would have gone straight for one of the lobster dishes had I known the risotto was $28. 

I would come back, I might even bring a date. But I would probably order something else."

I have vertigo and kept thinking about the stairs which are t very far behind. 

The service was okay; it seemed there was a lack of communication between the waiter and food prep. We ordered one thing, were told it wasn&#39;t available but it ended up being brought to us by another person.

It was a great portion of mussels, squid, scallops, lobster, shrimp and octopus.  And that was the very first time I ever ate octopus.

We arrived around 7 and did not have a reservation since we wanted to sit outside and that seating is first come first serve. We were told 45 min to an hour. No problem, there was plenty of seats at the bar.
At the bar I ordered a Pomegranate Swirl and my boyfriend got a Blood O&#39;Man, boy oh boy, those drinks were OUTSTANDING! My drink was refreshing, sweet, and had the right amount of alcohol. After 2 rounds of yummy and delicious cocktails we were told our table was ready. We go upstairs and at the very top they have a gorgeous rooftop. I was immediately happy and was so glad that we waited to be seated outside. I posted a pic of the rooftop and check it out, it is worth the wait to be able to sit outside on a nice day. 
So after being seated we get water and bread to munch on. We had a great server, a dark haired Italian girl, can&#39;t remember her name but I blame it on the yummy, delicious cocktails. Our server was professional, fun, friendly, she gets an A+.
I ordered the Misto Pesce, it was spaghetti with lobster, shrimp, scallops and cherry tomatoes, and my boyfriend had the slow roasted rib eye. Both dishes were terrific, full of flavor, fresh, the amount was perfect. I have nothing but great things to say about this establishment. I was happy with the ambiance, decor, the staff, the food, everything was on point. When the server found out I was celebrating my bday she brought over shots for me and my boyfriend and she took one with us as well. I could have not asked for a better birthday dinner.

1. Good wine selection. (This place has a terrible selection and should be ashamed)

2. When a place brags about its recipes they taste either homemade or special. Here, everything tastes canned and readymade. Nothing is special, everything tastes stale or microwaved. 

3. Bread should be pretty solid, as will the olive oil/cheese. Here the Cheese is crappy American knockoff stuff and bread is nothing special. Oil is bland and has zero flavor. Nothing exciting. 

The inside is stale and old, and pretty much lacks character and is upstairs so kind of strange, and stairs are dirty and not clean either. Pretty good idea for a first impression. 

Staff have no idea what&#39;s on the menu for both food and beverage, and look disinterested.

Our dinner was at 5:30 on a Wednesday, so not yet busy. The night we dined, the evening was a perfect early autumn night so the AC was off, but the day had been warm and the windows (only every other one) were open only about 8 inches, so no breeze and a bit hot and sunny in the setting sun. Later in our meal, when the sun was gone, we opened the two windows nearest us and it was instantly a great experience; we wished the staff had opened them all, there is so much value in that view and the ambience they lend to the room.

The martini was good, served very cold in a large martini glass and well-priced at $9.00 with $1.00 up-charge for premium liquor. All good. Bread, olive oil and Parmesan started our meal. Our salads were very well made and served in square bowls, a nice touch. The amount of dressing was just right. My Caesar salad was flavorful, a tad on the sweet side, not over garlicky. Husband had the house salad, balsamic on mixed greens with red onion. Again, hit the mark.

The main course for me was gluten free chicken piccata with wilted spinach. Wish I&#39;d taken a picture, it was bad on sight, and if we eat with our eyes first, well... I was disappointed. The chicken looked like gray cubed steak (I thought maybe it was veal, but no, the server assured me it was chicken), it had been excessively pounded into two textured thin rumpled sheets, not sure why. If one is pounding to thin and tenderize, this should not be the result. It lay, gray and lifeless in a thin butter (not buttery) broth that added no flavor to the dish. On top of the chicken were capers and bits of garlic. I ate two bites, the second one only to confirm the tastelessness of the first. The chicken was rubbery and bland. Only flavor being the capers. Yuck. The server tried hard to be gracious while explaining to me that a piccata is just a simple dish in a lemon and butter sauce. I&#39;ve eaten it before and have always liked it, but none ever tasted like this. He did bring the menu and eventually a new dish- sausage and red peppers, very good, and again, a tad on the sweet side, which stood up well to the spice and robust sausage. This dish was a good portion size for me, and may have been an appetizer portion. It did the trick and saved our meal. The server was helpful, but seemed not immediately understanding of the issue. He later came back to the table and told me that he had tried some of the uneaten part of the dish and he agreed with my evaluation. Hmmm, okay.

My husband had ordered veal Marsala, he felt his veal was okay, and the sauce smelled great and looked amazing and was dark and rich-flavored with plump and plentiful mushrooms. 

We then enjoyed the night air, the street scene below, and cappuccino and espresso. There is lovely sweet shoppe below (a separate business) so we enjoyed a bit of dessert there on the way to the car. Street Parking is usually a block or so away, but there is a parking garage around the corner.

Overall, a pleasant evening. Would try it again, but I&#39;ll skip the attempt to accommodate a gluten free piccata."

So much flavor,  cooked to perfection &amp; the staff are super friendly. My date had the white fish risotto &amp; it wasn&#39;t very fishy which is a good thing. I had the 8oz filet mignon &amp; rosemary garlic potatoes.  So juicy! Finished of with a canoli &amp; chocolate gilato, which made me dance in my seat. Love this place!"

Plus the downsizing of the menu does not disappoint.  The restaurant is a little more modern with new wood tile floors and updated seating and tables.  It would be easy to walk by this restaurant as its on the second floor of down town building in Wheaton but do go it.  

Started with the &#39;daily&#39; arancini balls.  Never I had been a fan of arancini balls in general.  Usually bland giant balls of fried rice.  Not the case here.  The fluffy rice with melty cheese, sweet peas and what ever else was in there turned out to be magic balls of flavor.

Chicken saltimbocca was on my plate this evening.... partially because I am in love with the side that comes with it....cooked spinach.  The chicken was perfectly cooked with a generous layer of prosciutto and cheese and sage.  Amazing favors all wrapped up in one bite.  Also love grabbing a piece of bread and letting the juices from my plate soak in and noshing in that as well.

The salmon special with grilled vegetables drizzled with a balsamic reduction was also amazing!!!  

Too full for desert but don&#39;t skip the rice balls!!!!  Service was great and always look forward to going back."

We&#39;d heard mixed reviews on it which was also evident by the reviews here on Yelp. We went last night for a birthday dinner. 

Good: 
- I&#39;m not much of a wine drinker but there were a few good beer options to choose from.
- I ordered the Vodka pasta and husband ordered the Chicken Saltimbocca - awesome! 
- Prices were to be expected at this type of Italian restaurant.
- Rooftop is a great addition to Wheaton. Plus they have heaters if its a chilly night. 

Not so Good:
- Hostess and a particular waitress was rude. First thing that went wrong was the hostess&#39; attitude. She was angry that we wanted to sit at a table for a drink before our table was ready on the rooftop. There were plenty of open tables but no spots at the bar. A nice waiter happily served us drinks (hostess was ticked) as we waited for 45 min for our table. Thank you sir!
- Waitress (seemed like she was in charge of rooftop) seemed a bit pushy/bitchy. Maybe she was just overwhelmed as there were two large parties on the rooftop but it didn&#39;t come off well. 
- The second floor dining room&#39;s acoustics are a bit odd. Its a very open space so you can hear a lot of clanking of glasses and chatting. They need some fabric to absorb the sound. 
- The rooftop is awesome, albeit small. In order to sit at a table on the rooftop you are required to order an entree. I think they&#39;d make more $ if they made it into a rooftop bar. It would definitely appeal to the younger people/families of Wheaton. 
- Three different people in the space of 5 minutes asked if they could take my plate. Look at my silverware placement, I&#39;m clearly still eating!

Overall I enjoyed the dinner as the food was excellent. The staff could be a little more welcoming. I understand the reason for the mixed reviews."

My husband and I planned to go to a different restaurant tonight but the wait was too long so I decided to try somewhere I had been intrigued by for quite some time.  I had super high expectations since a coworker of mine stated this was the best restaurant he visited in Wheaton. First, marrying into an Italian family has spoiled me.  However, my meal was absolutely delicious.  I ordered a shrimp pasta with white cream sauce special.  It was perfection.  My husband was second guessing what he wanted and left wishing he had ordered his original choice. The wine was good at a decent price. Service was absolutely stellar and prompt. I would definitely go back and am not wishing  had been able to get into the original choice. Thank you and keep up the good work."

What an incredible meal. It was nice outside so we ate on the rooftop which was beautiful. The service was outstanding from start to finish. I also may have had one of the best old fashioned&#39;s of my life!

I ended up having the chicken parmigiana which was delicious!! My date had the risotto which was also incredible. The grilled calamari appetizer was also amazing. And we finished the meal with a tiramisu which was perfect. Not too sweet or rich and very light.

On top of it all, the meal was very reasonably priced. I would argue that the overall value of this restaurant may be second to none. Highly, highly recommend it."

You can&#39;t go wrong with any of these dishes, but I thought the veal and tortellini were especially good. The Lemincello Sorbet was also probably one of the best desserts I&#39;ve ever had.

I think that physicists should investigate this location because of the distortion in the space time continuum.  

The English language also transforms here as the word &#34;reservation&#34; becomes merely a suggestion and your name is put on a &#34;list&#34;.  To top it all off some genius designed the place so the podium the host/hostess is at is right at the top of the stairs so there is nowhere to wait.

Eventually we found a small corner at the crowded bar that was filled with other people buying into the promise of 30 minutes, to sit in.  In the restaurant&#39;s defense, a waitress did ask us several times if we were ok.

The best part was when a waiter told us we should have come at 4pm to get a table.  Thanks for the advice, let me hop in my time machine and get right on that.  We arrived at 7:30 and waited until nearly 10pm without any updates, apologies, or explanations.  Every time we asked if a table would be available soon.  Just the same &#34;just awhile longer&#34;.

Eventually we choose to leave and eat elsewhere after investing 2 hours of our Friday evening trying to get a table at a restaurant we had a reservation for.  As we were leaving, they were still quoting the same 30 minutes they had been giving for 2 hours.  I would have liked to try the food, and they seemed to have a great atmosphere and drink selection, but as stated this was impossible.

I can&#39;t fault a restaurant for being busy, but I can fault them for lying about the wait times."

We ate on the rooftop on a warm summer night.  It&#39;s nice up there but bringing the food up from the main floor seems to be an issue.  One salad came, then two more, then the appetizers.

Or something that a normal 9 year old wouldn&#39;t want, or that my husband doesn&#39;t want me spending money on. So, we&#39;ve decided to take a few close downtowns and try all the restaurants in them. This week we came here. Walking up the stairs, it already felt like a great atmosphere. Since the rooftop wasn&#39;t open, they sat us by the window. This room had one of the most beautiful ceilings that I&#39;ve ever seen. Since it was after 7 on a post Cubs loss Thursday, it wasn&#39;t crowded. Service was attentive, my daughter got her bread and kiddie cocktail, and then our experience began. My daughter picked the fried calamari. It&#39;s lightly fried with sea salt, pepper, and I think a smidge of garlic. Cooked perfect, not too slimy and not too well done. And the sauces were delish. Picking dinner for the girl was easy for her, as she always goes for the ravioli. But for me? Was a tough call. The filet sounded amazing. The gnocchi sounded amazing. The rolled up ribeye thing that I can&#39;t pronounce sounded amazing. But I ended up with chicken parmesan. Which was absolutely the perfect choice for me. Chicken had a great breading and cooked well, there was some penne pasta but the sauce is what made this dish. It was just wonderful. All of the flavors and textures just came together and worked! Loved the service, they were very attentive and polite. We will definitely be back soon!"

It&#39;s an upstairs location tucked away in downtown Wheaton, and an hour and a half before closing on a Tuesday, we were the only group in the place. The waiter and bartender ended up still giving us top notch attention which I thought was pure class - they coulda slacked off and stood around, but they were total professionals. 

We ordered a couple of glasses of wine and then decided to eat - my friend ordered the fried calamari and I had the gnocchi al forno which was a decadent blend of gnocchi, Italian sausage, olive oil, and cheese. I loved it EXCEPT for the enormous chunks of not quite roasted garlic throughout the dish, eek. Even having to pick those out, the meal was SO delicious and comforting that I would still order it again! 

The place is cute and dark and would probably make for a romantic date spot, which we may just have to hit up again soon."

I have dined at this restaurant many many times including every Christmas Eve with my big ITALIAN family roughly 30 people.  You cannot go wrong with anything on this menu and cannot get more authentic ITALIAN.  The marinara sauce is the best I have ever eaten and this is no exaggeration.  The owner&#39;s mom literally is the head chef of this restaurant.  The atmosphere is also very lively, warm and inviting.  Also, menu items are not put on the menu unless they are fresh, I know this firsthand as we always order the mussels as an appetizer and if the owner cannot get them fresh, she will let you know.  As far as beverages, the coffee martini is so addictive and fabulous.  This is one of the only ITALIAN restaurants I will eat at.  This is a must try!"

For a place that charges bigger prices, I expect bigger bang for my buck.  We sat on the rooftop which is a very nice setting overlooking downtown Wheaton amidst stringed lights.  The ambiance inside the main indoor restaurant is warm, inviting, and sophisticated. They did their best to accommodate our group of 6 for a last-minute switch to the roof.
However service was quite slow as it was at least a good 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us.  We ordered the caprese and grilled calamari for apps, and I&#39;m not sure how one can mess up such basic dishes, but they did.  The tomatoes, though thickly cut,  were not ripe or flavorful and the balsamic was second-rate.  The grilled calamari was even more disappointing in that it was undercooked/grilled and tasted fishy, not smokey and savory.  It was also drowning in a that same second-rate balsamic &#34;sauce&#34; as the caprese.  Yuck.

Main dishes ordered were caesar salad with grilled shrimp, braised pork shoulder, and the cavatelli salsicce.  The pasta was well prepared, homemade, and substantive.  The salsicce was probably the best dish of the night with a nice mix of homemade sausage bites, cherry tomotoes and fresh lump mozzarella.  The caesar/shrimp had only 5 pieces of shrimp on it but they were large and flavorful.  Lettuce was fresh, well-chopped and the dressing was legitimate, however, a huge pet-peeve of mine is when I have to peel any stupid crustaceans in my dishes!  So messy!  The braised pork was a nightmare.  It was this dumping of a blob of meat on top of another blob of polenta...poor presentation and mediocre, overly-vinegared and one-dimensional flavor.  Again, I expect more for $24.

I used to work high-end restaurants in downtown Chicago and was trained to never leave a customer with a dirty fork/spoon when transitioning between app and entre and dessert, yet they looked at me as if I had two heads when I asked for clean flatware.    
We also thought it was a little unprofessional for the wait staff to be taking swigs of wine and being defensive that &#34;that&#39;s the way her mom likes to do it&#34; when I commented that I don&#39;t like to have to prepare/peel my dinner.   
Their soup of that day was &#34;cream of string bean&#34; soup.  What?!!  No please!

As much as I&#39;d like to support the family-owned type of establishments, this place is not one I can look forward to being a supporter of.  Too many other choices in the metro area that do it so much better for the price."

I enjoyed my spinach and cheese salad, though it was pretty heavy on the balsamic so that the bottom was swimming in tart dressing. I ordered veal parm for dinner, out of the ordinary for me, but I&#39;m glad I tried it. It was served with penne that was cooked just perfectly, and I really liked their sauce. Plenty for leftovers. I wish I had some more to eat right now, actually. 

I wish I could remember the name of the dish my husband had...the menu on Il Sogno&#39;s website isn&#39;t the same as the one we ordered from, so I can&#39;t track it down. It had &#34;pinwheel&#34; in the description, along with some sort of seafood and pasta. It had such an interesting presentation, that when the waiter set the plate down, he said &#34;Ha, you weren&#39;t expecting that, were you?&#34; The whole thing tasted like a seafood bisque to me, not unpleasant, but kind of a strange dinner. Hubby called it &#34;interesting.&#34;

The service was just okay. Our waiter was wearing cologne, which makes me crazy, crazy, crazy (and not in a good way!) I&#39;m offended by perfumes on anyone, but especially those working in the food industry.

Disposable plastic soap dispensers in the restroom, refilled with generic, bright pink hand soap? Class it up just a bit, will you, Il Sogno? Details such as this one, and our waiter&#39;s offensive, heavy cologne don&#39;t mesh with the upscale feel the restaurant seems to be aiming for. After we try all the other restaurants in town we&#39;d like to, we might circle back and give Il Sogno another chance to impress us better than &#34;a-okay.&#34;"

Normally Italian places overcook their pasta and drown it in cheap sauce. Il Sogno absolutely does it right.

We started with a sirloin stuffed pepper and moved on to an order of mussels and some baked oysters as our 3 appetizers. All were fantastic.

After that we moved on to some minestrone soup and an order of shrimp and panchetta pasta. The pasta was done perfectly. Good chew and a perfect al dente. Flavorful sauce, and the pasta wasn&#39;t drowning in it.

The next course was a sirloin and spinach. Again, everything was cooked right. Good sear on the steak, balanced flavors and a good cut of meat.

Dessert was a pumpkin bread pudding with almond gelato and cream puffs. Both were amazing.

So, the food was amazing. Southern Italian style, where dishes are simple with the emphasis on quality ingredients and doing everything right.

For our meal we started out with red pepper crostini and the calamari, both were delicious. I was a huge fan of the seasoning on the grilled calamari - it was so great I did not even try the fried! For our next course I had the berry salad which was also outstanding. The real highlight of the meal was the third course the rigatoni in vodka sauce. It was so yummy, they have an awesome vodka sauce at Il Sogno. For our meal we were given a few choices and I went with the stake vesuvio. It was a great choice and I know everyone else loved their entrees as well.

He had recommended a nearby restaurant that was more American fare with some Italian dishes. Then he said there was another Italian eatery a block away and we should check its menu. So glad we did.

Stuffed calamari. Chicken parmesan. Lobster da fraviola. Oh my God.

Usually you will get calamari as rings, be it boiled or fried. The stuffing in these whole calamari has raised the bar a mile high. Neither rubbery nor tasteless, this appetizer dish was not enough, it was so good. When you season calamari such that diners want more, the chef has achieved a significant goal in the culinary arts. The chicken parmesan my friend had seemed to have had a hint of ginger in it. That went over incredibly well, not to mention that the sauce was superb with a mild spicy kick. As to the lobster da fraviola, I could have had a cigarette afterwards. Truly spicy and stupid delicious, I could have this dish at least once a week for the rest of my life and never tire of it.

Must say that the server was very knowledgeable of the menu without having to refer to it and very engaging in banter while we ordered. Who would have thought that an Italian restaurant tucked away in one of Chicago&#39;s western suburbs would be so authentic and enticing? This experience warrants an encore."

The ground beef/ground veal meatball sliders on pretzel bun were to die for and you can&#39;t go wrong with any of their pasta dishes. I absolutely LOVED their vodka sauce.

First time the server couldn&#39;t make a wine recommendation or answer a basic wine question, then my table of three&#39;s food came out at different times so I was sitting there watching my meal get cold. Second time (last night) the host was so rude that I don&#39;t think any of us will go back. She scolded my friends for not responding when their name was called, but they were literally 6 steps away from her - directly in her line of sight. She was very snippy - we arrived at different times and each greeted the group with &#34;what&#39;s up with the host?&#34; Then she was rude to us as a group (is it possible to *enjoy* not seating people..?), so we decided to take our business elsewhere.

Get to know them - they will take care of you.  Nunzia&#39;s pasta is the star of the menu and should not be missed in any capacity.  She runs the kitchen with her exacting standards and ingredients, more overly she is a lovely person.  Speak with her and you will feel like she has invited you into her own house for dinner.  
It was because of her daughter, Rose, that our evening was a true success.  When we joined them for dinner in November 2104, Il Sogno was struggling with a very junior staff.  They had yet to learn the basic points of service, from water to wine, plates and silverware.  After several mishaps, we asked to see the Manager, specifically about the wine.  Rose actually presented us a bottle from her own private collection.  It was a Ferrari-Carrano PreVail West Face - 93 Wine Advocate &amp; Wine Enthusiast.  As a red wine lover, if you haven&#39;t tried it you should.  As someone seeking a wine recommendation - ask Rose, you won&#39;t be disappointed.
I hope that Il Sogno continues to invest and properly train staff so that Nunzia&#39;s food can be properly appreciated and the warmth of the Longobardi family is given the opportunity to shine.
Our evening of mishaps ended on such a positive note, my family sharing with their family over wine, good conversation and food well after the restaurant had closed.  After all, isn&#39;t that the way it&#39;s supposed to be??!!!"

We try to go there once a every other month to sit at the bar and have light meals. Since Sheila left, the bartending staff has no idea what they are doing! The new rooftop dining looked so nice, went there last night and put our name in....again total chaos with taking our name. We were told 30-45 minutes wait. Waited at the bar. Watched as several couples came in after us, put their names in, and got seated before us.

Residing in the second floor of the strip on Hale street, Il sogno provides delicious Italian food and outrageously reasonable prices. (Seriously! $12 for a generous helping is typically what you&#39;ll find here).
Not many places have veal on their menus, but Il Sogno has an entire section of it, and every dish is consistently awesome.
Some nights they do have loud music, but on a typical night the ambiance almost gives you a little taste of Italy here in Wheaton. The staff is knowledgeable and inviting, and the service is present but not overbearing.
Hopefully more people will discover this little slice of Italy hidden right in the downtown Wheaton area."

The elevator was a big help to get her up the stairs safely. Welcomed by the staff and seated by the big window, overlooking the busy Wheaton downtown area, snowy and lit up for Christmas. Just beautiful.

Ordered basic Chiantis and Chardonnay. Entrees include soup or salad. Wife had the green pepper appetizer stuffed with beef tenderloin - why didn&#39;t we ever think of that? I had the pasta fagioli soup, mom had a lovely green salad with balsamic vinaigrette. 

My entree was a magnificent Veal alla Parmigiana, two large pieces - took one of them home - with great sauce. Mom had the meat lasagna, again a large piece and very good. Wife had her dinner salad and some of my veal.

The restaurant was starting to fill up and it did get a bit louder, but still comfortable speaking to a senior with hearing issues.

We split a Tiramisu with good strong coffees. All in all, a great meal for a reasonable price and pleasant, attentive service. It was early-YMMV.

The only bad things I can say are parking for handicapped folks is not close, (was under snow, actually) and our take-home dishes were not sealed well - but it was in a plastic bag, so fine."

We had reservations at 730, arrived about 10 minutes early and were happy to be seated right away. The decor of the place is warm and inviting and we didn&#39;t mind too much when we were seated at a table between two groups. So far so good, but at this point the meal became a roller coaster and ended up with us anxiously waiting for the check so we could get out of there.

The Good:

Drinks! Great drink selection, wines, martinis, and even a decent craft beer selection for an Italian bisto including Three Floyds and Lagunitas selections. The Coffee House martin is excellent.

The food was good to very good I&#39;d say. 4 stars based strictly on that. We started with the Calamari and even she enjoyed it when normally she&#39;s not a fan of any kind of seafood. Each entre comes with a side salad or soup, so there&#39;s pretty good value in the dollars you spend food wise. We both liked our meals quite a bit and cleaned our plates. Tiramisu desert was very good, although they over did it on the Cocoa powder to the point where we were close to choking while eating. Our waiter comped our dessert recognizing it was out first time there which was very generous, but can&#39;t help but think he did it to make up for what had just 
happened. 

The Bad.
No idea what our waiters name was. Never got so much as a hello a welcome. The greeting was literally Can I get you something to drink? A bit overanxious bussers. I appreciate a good clean table, but being asked by 3 different people within a 5 minute period if they could take my plate was slightly annoying.

The Really Bad:

When we arrived, we were seated between a 4 top and a 8 top. From what I can tell, the group of 4 seemed to be sharing a bottle of wine and ordered a few desserts. The restaurant was busy, not never appeared to be on any kind of wait. At one point towards the end of our meal, we see our waiter talking to the 4 top and explaining that it&#39;s not something that normally happens here etc and apologizing. We weren&#39;t able to tell anything else so just assumed something must have went wrong in the kitchen which obviously happens, no big deal.

About a minute later the 4 top gets up and leaves. Our waiter returns to our table and explains to us that he asked that table to leave since they weren&#39;t going to order any other food and normally it&#39;s not a big deal but it&#39;s Saturday Night etc. etc. So not only did he ask that table to leave, he then complained about another table to us! 

This made both of us feel extremely uncomfortable. A band had started towards the end of our meal and we were planning on having another drink or two and enjoying the music. This experience basically ruined the entire meal for us and we couldn&#39;t wait to get out of there and head to the bar across the street for another drink or two. Spending $120 dollars on a meal for two, you hope you never feel rushed at any point.

The real kicker of it, is that table remained empty for almost a half hour before it was sat again.

Would not go back or recommend this place to anyone."

When we told them our friends had been waiting for 45 minutes already, manager told us that it was an hour from reservation time, not arrival Huh? Seated us inside, bus boy brought bread and water and 25 minutes later I had to flag a waiter to ask if we were invisible. Finally ordered dinner at the 40 minute mark.

I was extremely disappointed with my food.  Upon sitting down waiter was rushing for food order.  My friend and I ordered the risotto special which was shrimp and vegetables with a risotto and my husband got the braciole.  The risotto came with 4 shrimp that were not fresh but frozen and canned mushrooms and a veggie medley of broccoli, zucchini and carrots that came right out of a bag from the freezer they were so water logged that I could not even eat them.  My husbands steak which braciole is usually so tender you can eat with a fork was so tough he could barely cut with a knife.  For $38 I could have gone to a nice steakhouse and got a good, well cooked piece of meat.  Risotto listed m/p on menu and I was shocked to be charged $25 for frozen food.

The food is pretty good. I had the fettuccini with white sauce and it was delicious. Very rich. Also, the portions are big, especially for the price you pay (about $70 for 4 of us).

We had the bruschetta as an appetizer and the bread was very dry and crusty. The tomatoes didn&#39;t seem fresh and they put such a huge chunk of cheese that it falls right off. Definitely not the best bruschetta I&#39;ve had.

Like others have mentioned the service is slow. We didn&#39;t seem to mind because we weren&#39;t in any hurry and had fun talking and eating. The staff is very nice.

Party of 6 here we come... 

We originally had a party of 10 and with some last minute cancellations we were down to a party of 6. Our table was 2 small tables put together and overall very tight and uncomfortable during dinner.  I really don&#39;t know where we would have had sat with a party of 10. Our tables were right up against other tables... It was too close when peoples coats hanging from the back of their chairs were almost on your table. 

Noise Level: Very loud

Seating: Very tight, don&#39;t know if they were over booked or what but extremely tight. 

Score: 2/5 - Low score just because of the very close tables around ours. Maybe on a different weekend (Valentines Day Weekend) it would be better.  

Food: Food came out quick form the kitchen, fresh and actually really good. My mother-in-law had the lasagna in meat sauce which was excellent, my wife had the cheese ravioli in marinara sauce which my wife found the sauce to tangy and was &#34;ok&#34;.  Sister-in-law ordered Seafood medley on a bed of spaghetti which she said was excellent and brother in law ordered chicken marsala which was &#34;really good&#34;. I ordered the pumpkin filled ravioli and I thought it tasted very good - small serving of only 5 raviolis in a brown butter sauce. I was expecting a larger portion.

Score: 4/5

Drinks: Wine was served around the table, I had a seven &amp; seven which I found to be very weak on the alcohol. coffee and espresso served after supper was excellent.

Score: 2.5/5 

Service: Overall ok, I would give it a 3/5. dirty dishes were cleaned off the table quickly, took 4 times of asking for a fresh bread basket before it was delivered and I never saw a water refill once at the table. Servers and bus boys were rushing around the place the entire time - almost at a speed between a power walk and jog. It was distracting at times and hard to flag down a server as they were never paying attention to our table. 

Score: 3/5

We were lucky enough to be around when the live music started, 2 guys playing guitar and playing some great music during supper. It complimented the night very well and they sounded great. 

A couple of things bugged me during the meal: 

No water refills. 
Constantly had to flag a server for anything (Coffee, bread basket)
Servers running around the place all crazy and just looked stressed out. 

And the issue of the night that bugged me: 

My wife had gone to use the restroom when they were bringing out her ice cream &amp; b-day cake - when the server had noticed she wasn&#39;t at the table he put the dish on the counter near the coffee makers. My mother in law said she had went to use the restroom and his response back was &#34;she better hurry up or the ice cream will be melted&#34;  - Quite the snide remark and uncalled for. He could have taken it back into the kitchen, or said we&#39;ll make another one etc etc... 

Overall the food was good - service was questionable. 

Will probably give the restaurant another shot to determine if we will put it on our &#34;to-go&#34; list."

While I had no issue with the food, the service left much to be desired. Our server checked on us only once throughout our dinner and ignored my one request during our meal. He then mischarged us and seemed annoyed despite the fact it was his mistake. Lastly and most disappointing, he brought back the corrected check and asked that we leave, as he had five people waiting to be seated. I was shocked and disappointed by our treatment and will not be back to il sogno. There are simply better places to dine."

The restaurant is uniquely located in an upstairs portion of the building that it shares with an ice cream shop. The windows overlook downtown Wheaton and the metra tracks which adds to an already romantic atmosphere. Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. For wine, we ordered the masciarelli montepulaciano de abruzzo Italian red wine and it was delicious, far better than any of the wine we had just had tasting devine. The olive oil and bread were already on the table, which is an absolute must! I ordered the rotolo pomodoro and my friend had the gnocchi pomodoro. When you order an entrée, you get either soup or salad. I chose their side salad which our server recommended and it was amazing! Probably one of the best side salads that I have ever had, the balsamic dressing was spot on and not too soggy. My friend enjoyed her broccoli and cheddar soup. I thought that my entrée was unique and savory but my friend said that the gnocchi was just alright. After we paid, it was a few minutes before closing, and we asked our waiter when we should leave and he said to take our time and that everyone was still there working. Only about 15 minutes later, the manager came and asked us to leave because they were closing, which was fine but the waiter should have just said that we close at 10 instead of saying to take our time because we then felt embarrassed and rushed. However, it is without a doubt that I will return. I have already been raving to other friends about how great of a restaurant it is!"

Great:
Amberjack fish special - this dish was great.  Everything about it was perfect from how it was cooked, to how the sauce complimented the fish.

Good:
Mussel appetizer - perfectly cooked white wine, garlic, tasty.
Pollo Vesuvio - Traditional take on a traditional dish.

Bad:
My wine had cork on it.  Big pieces of cork smiling up at me.

Awful:
Gnocchi Alla Pomodoro - legitimately one of the worst dishes I&#39;ve eaten.  This was badly overcooked, gooey and sticky.  The sauce itself was completely bland, and a little gross.  Sadly, it was my dish.

We won&#39;t be back - every item on the menu needs to be good.  Even though it&#39;s an Italian restaurant, if you can&#39;t cook gnocchi take it off the menu."

Started out fine - waitress a little slow to get back to us after we sat down and said we needed a moment to look at the wine list, but that was not a problem..

We ordered our wine - visited and ordered our dinner.... dinner arrived and so did the BAND.... Good Grief - not that the group wasn&#39;t good, but....a four piece band w/vocal in a small dining area.  We couldn&#39;t hear ourselves over the &#34;music&#34;....  so a $70.00 meal and evening out was virtually ruined by too loud music.

Wifey and I went to Il Sogno on Wednesday night with two other &#34;foodie&#34; couples who raved about the Italian food being &#34;authentic!&#34; I&#39;m not sure I truly know what authentic is, but I do know what AWESOME is.

The restaurant is located in downtown Wheaton, but it&#39;s easy to miss if you&#39;re not looking up - that&#39;s right, up. It&#39;s on the second floor of a fantastic corner near the train station.

We literally had a food tour of Naples. It started with a stuffed eggplant which was terrific. The sauce was bursting with a celebration of flavors just asking to be sopped up with the fresh bread. Next was possibly my favorite course - a pumpkin capelacci. The sauce was buttery delicious and every bite tasted like pumpkin soup in a pasta. Homemade gnocchi was the real winner of the night. When Wifey and I go back this is the dish we will order without a doubt. I was so stuffed at this point I couldn&#39;t even finish my serving. I took it home and Wifey ate it for lunch the next day and said it was still amazing. Final stop on our tour was a smorgasbord of desserts including tiramisu, banana creme brulee, and a hazelnut gelato that was out of this world.

Every Italian food lover (and who isn&#39;t?) will immediately put Il Sogno at the top of their list."

We had an early reservation because it was a Saturday night. When we arrived (on time) the restaurant was still pretty empty (5:30p) When we sat down we immediately all felt rushed. The server did not want to give us time to figure out what we wanted to order. When we asked for a moment, that is what he gave us and came right back. it felt awkward. The food was overall good and 6 people really liked their dish. The grilled calamari appetizer was very good. My cappellini was under-cooked (not just al dente) and my dish cold. My husband&#39;s lasagna was very good as was the vodka sauce on another&#39;s dish. They do not have spaghetti and meatballs on the menu but we were able to order it and my brother said it was good. The salad before dinner was complimentary. It was ordinary. It looked like it should be 
complimentary. If I would have had to pay for it, I would have sent it back. The soup was adequate. The service was not great. After being there about 30 minutes, the restaurant&#39;s manager, a dark haired  woman, told us we were taking too long to order our entrees even though we were a larger group and were ordering bottles of wine and eating appetizers. Once we ordered we were rushed to leave. People constantly trying to clear our table even though we were not done eating. I do not think it is the wait staff, I think the problem is the manager who is on the backs of the wait staff to turn the tables. She certainly had no problem staying on us, trying to get us to vacate our table earlier than we cared to. We finally left and were glared at by the manager as she whispered to another group who was waiting for our table. I won&#39;t be back."

Waiters seemed to be racing around to help larger tables. I felt the floor shake each time they passed. We had a reservation, but still had to wait for table. Zero sound deadening. Had to yell to hear each other in spite of the fact that our table for four was tiny. I could not get the bus boy to remove the wine menu to make more room, so I threw it under the table.

We had a reservation and were seated by the window. The restaurant atmosphere is really nice and relaxing. We all got pasta dishes and we loved them all. They all tasted fresh and were homemade too. The sauces were really good as well. The reason why im giving il sogno 4 stars and not 5 is because our server isnt really what we expected at a place like this. The man that brought us our drinks was more attentive and more friendly. It seemed like our server didnt really want to talk with us or answer questions but who knows, maybe he was just having a bad night. Will definately come back here though, would recommend :)"

We had the burrata e prosciutto to start and the burrata was ok but you only get 4 tiny slices of not very appealing prosciutto. Next the minestrone soup, taste was ok but the veggies were overcooked and mushy. The pappardelle e gamberi was $26 and it only had 5 medium sized shrimp, with the tail still on, so you have to fish them out and chop off the tail. The broccoli was overcooked and mushy. The il sogno was ok but once again the zucchini was overcooked and mushy. We started noticing a trend. Our bill was over $100 for two of us and I think we would have had better food at olive garden.

It never disappoints and almost everything is delicious. Rosie is an absolute dream as a server, part owner and creatively concocts a lot of the recipes and daily specials for her mom in the back who is hand cooking everything like she was back in Italy. 

The pasta dishes with Italian sausage are some of my favorites and my husband splurges on some of the seafood dishes which are always worth it.  Honestly, with a number of dishes priced less than Macaroni Grill or Olive Garden, why go anywhere else!!!  It is some of the best Italian I&#39;ve ever had competing with some of Chcago&#39;s best in Little Italy. 

You will love it!"

At close to 3 pm we still made it on the lunch special, which includes an egg roll, soup and fried rice (though we both went with plain) for $6.95. Let me tell you, this was a stupefying amount of food for under 7 bucks: there were about 2 and a half cups of rice on my plate, and that wasn&#39;t compensating for a small entree -- there was plenty of meat as well, and I enjoyed the inclusion of the crunchy water chestnuts with my kung pao beef. Dad got beef chop suey and liked it as well. 

I really have to hand it to the staff for stellar service: the young man who served us was pleasant, helpful and just plain &#34;on&#34; in all ways. Just what you want in a waiter. 

Would certainly return for another meal! It was our lucky day when we found Lucky Panda!"

No more red dirty carpets and floor to celing blinds. Everything feels brand new and they even put a nice fun logo.  The dining area is clean and they even put a bubble wall decorations to create a family friendly resto. I would still consider the food mediocre and what you would expect from a Chinese takeout. But they only been open few months so I&#39;m still optimistic they&#39;ll improve.

The takeout: salt pepper fish, chicken lo-mein, kung pao chicken, shrimp fried rice, egg roll, crab rangoon, chow mein. Btw these are ordered in 2 seperate occasions.

The fried rice and salt pepper fish is drenched in oil and was too salty. Quite normal but I do know couple takeout places around the area that had this dish to perfection. The chow mein chicken dish  had bean sprouts that taste like it was sitting on the fridge for few days. All other dishes went fine though, lo-mein noodles taste like it&#39;s freshly made, including the kung pao dish which has enough spice to get your nasal passages decongested. Did I say they have smoothies as well. You found a new loyal customer in me, apart from the convenience factor since you guys are close by. Kudos to your friendly staff!"

Tonight we tried Lucky Panda for the first time.  Like other reviewers we were fans of Chan&#39;s but not when they were sold.  
This new restaurant is very good as was the service. 
The Crab Rangoon was in the top two we&#39;ve ever had. 
The egg drop soup was a good portion for ordering the small size and very tasty.  
We will be back and try other dishes. Tonight was Beef Chop Suey and a chefs special Three Star Sizzling. 
The steamed rice was also very fresh and not sticky gloppy.

However, I can finally say I&#39;ve found a great place and the best part is it&#39;s close to home!  

I&#39;ve already ate here (or ordered take out) four times in the last few weeks.  The food quality is excellent!  I&#39;ve ordered four different main dishes to see if they are just as good from the time before, and they were all awesome!

This is what I&#39;ve ordered thus far:

Egg Rolls - These are great!  Perfect amount of crunch and chew for the wrap and the filling is nice!  Oh and their apricot sweet &amp; sour sauce to dip your egg roll in is sooooo tasty!!

Crab Rangoon - I&#39;m picky about this appetizer.  Most places have a ratio of 100:1 cream cheese:crab.  Drives me crazy because I feel like I&#39;m paying for cream cheese.  However Lucky Panda puts a LOT of crab in them, and they&#39;re VERY tasty as well.  The sweetness is perfectly subtle as it should be.  Their crab rangoon rivals my favorite place in Chinatown.

Kung Pao Chicken - This was excellent!  The vegetables were fresh, crisp, and the sauce was flavorful!  Spice level was moderate... If you like it real hot, make sure you let them know!

Garlic Beef - Also excellent!  Great mixture of fresh veggies, tender beef, and the garlic sauce was just right.  Nice hint of heat as well. 

Chicken Chop Suey - I&#39;m very picky about this dish.  My favorite version of this dish is at a restaurant in Villa Park.  However, I will say that Lucky Panda is the closest I&#39;ve had yet and it&#39;s very tasty!  Again, quality meat and veggies in an light and flavorful sauce. 

General Tso&#39;s Chicken - I consider this a staple dish at Chinese restaurants.   Everyone makes it and it&#39;s always mediocre at best.  Not here.  This is THE best General Tso&#39;s Chicken I&#39;ve had yet. The batter is just right and not heavy.  Also the sauce is on the thicker side BUT the dish is not swimming in it which most places do and I can&#39;t stand that.  Nice job Lucky Panda!!!



Overall, I am super pleased with this restaurant and like I told the server the other night, keep doing what you&#39;re doing!!!"

Real chicken BREAST and not peppered with unknown dark meat, the veggies were crisp, sauces were tasty, and and shrimp was good size and great flavor. Will definitely order from Lucky Panda again."

It was greasy, and seemed old (I know some say fried rice should be greasy, but I disagree). Also, I didn&#39;t notice any egg in it which is typically a standard ingredient, so that was disappointing. The beef egg foo young and sweet and sour chicken were good. The egg rolls were just ok. I&#39;d eat there again but definitely wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to do so."

I liked their food but one huge mistake overrode everything positive that I could say about them. I went there for lunch today and ordered the garlic beef with no mushrooms. I am deathly allergic to mushrooms. The dish came out with mushrooms on it. I told them to remake it without mushrooms and again said I was allergic to them so don&#39;t just take them off. The dish came back too fast but I assumed because they weren&#39;t busy they simply made a new dish. That was my mistake. I ate about half of the dish until I stirred up the rice some more and found a mushroom. I then realized I should have gone with my first instinct and refused the returned dish. Had I bit into the mushroom, I wouldn&#39;t be here to write this review. This is a huge mistake and could cause the death of a customer simply because they didn&#39;t want to remake a $6.00 dish. I was hoping they were going to be a new place to eat in the area but now I can never trust them again."

The food was ready very quickly - though it was pretty quiet when we were in there. Hubby had the half white chicken with corn and mashed and gravy and liked everything.

Boston Market for me is an above-fast food quality fast food place. There is really nothing on the menu that is bad or nasty. I usually get:

Rotisserie chicken: Its what they do best. Almost always tender and juicy. I recommend the dark meat. 

Brisket Sandwich: not tough, horseradish mayo a nice touch and the au jus dipping sauce is nice and salty. 

Chicken Noodle Soup: I really like this soup, the soup is clear and rich, the noodles are like squares of pasta and the chicken is probably shredded from left over rotisserie chickens which I approve of. 

Chicken Pot Pie: there is a big air pockets inside but the filling is good and the sauce and vegetables are nice and thick. 

Sides:

Mac and Cheese: Should actually be called Rotini and Cheese cus that&#39;s what it is. Not made with macaroni noodles. Very deep yellow cheesy which is good and tastes great. 

Garlic Dill Potatoes: I don&#39;t taste any garlic in this but I do see the dill. Still tastes pretty good. 

Mashed Potatoes and gravy: Decent mashed potatoes and the gravy is very good. 

Corn Bread: Personally I think the name should be corn cake or corn muffin because its as sweet as a cake or muffin if not sweeter. Some people love it, i just like it. 

Yeah the prices are slightly above fast food. (Around 10 bucks for a meal with sides) but the quality is also better. (the chicken actually looks like a chicken instead of a patty or a nugget) If you want a decent quick dinner, I high recommend stopping by for a bite."

It&#39;s great when McDonald&#39;s (next door) will not do and cooking at home is not an option.  The level of service varies immensely, as a function of who is at the register, but the quality of the food is usually steady.  Over the years, I have mainly just eaten the chicken with mashed potato or vegetable sides. Not all the sides look appetizing to me. Some of sides look bizarre.

Last night, we tried the ribs that they have been advertising so heavily on TV.  They have the BIGGEST bones that I have ever seen on pork ribs.  While they are equally meaty, the taste is rather bland.  Perhaps the sauce needs some work.  We all know where to get GREAT ribs in Naperville, based on my other reviews...

I ate here over the weekend and ordered a &#39;beef brisket + Swiss sandwich&#39; from a girl who clearly wanted to be somewhere else. When I got my food, my spinach was very warm but the beef in my sandwich was almost cold; normally it wouldn&#39;t be an issue but the sandwich was served with gravy, which was also tepid I asked to have the sandwich &#39;reheated&#39; and the person who had prepared it barely looked at me and and instead of offering to bring it back to my table he disappeared to the back and had me stand and wait. I think I stood for almost 10 minutes with no sign of the man who had apparently absconded with my food. Finally he reappeared and said &#39;I hope it&#39;s hot enough&#39;, still not making eye contact. I don&#39;t know what he was doing for the 5-10 odd minutes of his absence but the sandwich wasn&#39;t much warmer; he managed to melt the cheese but the beef (which was originally scoped from a plastic container) was barely temperate. I could have sat on the sandwich and it would have been hotter and the worst part was some 15 minutes later, when I was finishing my last bite, the girl who originally took my order walked by the table and asked if it was &#39;hot enough&#39;; well, I guess it doesn&#39;t matter now, does it?"

Time of my visit: Late dinner

My girlfriend and I wanted to try something different for dinner tonight, since she did not feel like cooking.  It has been quite a few years since I was at this place, so I thought it would great to reacquainted with the place.

We arrived and the place was a bit empty, it had two larger parties, so we were promptly seated.  Our waiter came by and brought us water.  We opted out not to order any drinks and dived into the menus.  I was in a mood for pizza and my significant other wanted pasta.  So I ordered BBQ chicken specialty pizza and she ended ordering pasta.

Before I even get to food, I would like to address service...  My perception of the waiter was that he appeared a bit grumpy, short and a man of few words...  My significant other thought he was just fine... But yet again she likes to mess with me from time to time....

On to the food.  My pizza was delicious!  I must say, this is probably, one of the best pizzas I have had in a long time.  The crust was risen just a little bit, so it was not that thin crust, but just enough for it not to be anything more than a thin crust.  I keep telling people, the dough, the way you cook it with pizza will make or break the pizza.  Sure the ingredients are important, but if the dough is f*ed, regardless of the ingredients, the pizza is f*ed.  Now, I can safely say, I have two places I will be getting my pizza from, from now and this is one of them.  On to the ingredients, the cheese, the sauce, the BBQ chicken and the onion were well fused together to create this delicious pizza.

One thing, that bothered me a little bit, was waiter hovered a bit over a check.  He left it for us to pay, but when he decided to check on us, lingered a bit, waiting for me to get my card out.  Bugged me a little bit.

Overall, A-.  Definitely would recommend this place for the food."

When you first walk in you are a bit confused as to where the restaurant is - at first blush it is like a small cake/bakery shop - but then you see the host(ess) and know you&#39;re in the right place. We didn&#39;t have a reservation and were seated immediately. But then, however, we waited a rather extended amount of time before our waitress arrived. From then on though the service was rather prompt. The dining room(s) themselves are rather sizeable and there are plenty of tables and booths. The atmosphere is light and friendly and has a pretty standard Italian restaurant feel to it. The bathroom, which is in the front of the building, was looked after nicely.

We kicked things off with apps: Bruschetta (tasty, but LOADED with balsamic...) and soup/salad that came with the entrees (the Chicken Jalapeno soup is very enjoyable!); then moved to the main course: Gnocchi (the BEST we&#39;ve ever had anywhere. PERIOD!) and the Lasagna (enjoyable, but kind of just a heap of noodles/meat covered in sauce and cheese). All the food came out hot and tasted freshly made and the portions are HUGE! Wow!

The prices won&#39;t scare anyone away and, knowing how LARGE the portions are, you know you&#39;re getting leftovers - great bang for your buck!

This is a solid, local Italian place that we already want to return to again soon!"

I was pleasantly surprised by the comfortable family atmosphere, the menu selections, and the food itself. 

My mother is from Naples yet I&#39;m not a huge fan of pizza. When I do order it, I get a little picky. How&#39;s the crust, the sauce, the cheese, the toppings, the grease factor, etc? Barone&#39;s sold me in every category. Love the thin, almost buttery crust, the tangy and slightly sweet tomato sauce, the salty mozzarella cheese, and the pepperoni and veggie toppings are great. I even did the napkin blot to remove excess oil (don&#39;t judge me!) and my spinach pizza had only specks of grease. Not bad...

Lezza&#39;s spumoni is pretty hard to find these days but they have it here. You&#39;ll also find cannoli and other Italian desserts on the menu.

I had our rehearsal dinner at Barone&#39;s in April and everything was perfect. We had about 30 people and they all raved about the food. We had salad, appetizers, pizza and pasta. There wasn&#39;t one thing that wasn&#39;t devoured. If I could have their vodka sauce everyday, I would! Everyone there is so friendly and booking our dinner was super easy. They called the week of to go over the menu and verify time and number of people. The tables were set up and ready to go when we arrived.

I found this place through Yelp, I was looking for a place I could order delivery from. This place had good reviews so I decided to go for it. I love that I could place my order online, I didn&#39;t have to talk to anyone and I didn&#39;t need a paper menu, it was all online. 
I ordered the baked mostaccioli  and my boyfriend the jambalaya pasta. Both dinners came with a side salad and bread. 
Ordering online was easy and the delivery was quick. My food came nice and hot and I got it in less than 45 minutes. 
I am so extremely happy that I decided to order from here. I was a happy camper with my food. My mostaccioli was baked to perfection, the meat sauce was so flavorful, it had plenty of meat, the cheese was just enough and my portion was a good size. I had enough leftover for lunch this afternoon. My boyfriend said his jambalaya was delicious, great flavor and had a nice spicy kick yo it. The side salads are also a nice addition to the pasta. 
I am very excited to try other dishes from their menu and eventually try the pizza. I was 100% satisfied with my dinner, it&#39;s great to have a place that offers delicious food delivered to your door and the prices are reasonable. I would also like to try eating at the restaurant since I read that they are kid friendly. 
5 stars all the way! Good delivery food with lots of options is a rarity."

Sauce is good and has a rich flavor but our pizza was more well done than I would have liked. Ordered some fries that weren&#39;t good at all, could have used a few more minutes cooking and some salt. 

When i arrived to pick it up there was some disorder as to where the line was. The clerk at the register gave me a hard time b/c the person who took the order misplaced my last name; after I spelt it out for him. Then she entered my number wrong into the machine and made me feel a bit salty as though I hadn&#39;t placed an order. Made it uncomfortable.

Lucky this place has been here forever and after coming so many times service almost doesn&#39;t matter. Not many places has a kids room right next to the table we always go to so that is a savior for the adults.

I truly have never witnessed such horrendous and unfriendly service. Our waitress was one of the shortest grumpiest women I have ever encountered who is supposed to providing &#34;customer service&#34;. Asked us about 5x if we were ready to order when we hadn&#39;t been there more than 5 minutes, our group was not complete and we were getting the kids situated. I&#39;ve never felt more rushed in my life. When we asked for anything we got short and curt responses with no eye contact whatsoever, I won&#39;t even mention the fact that I still have not seen a smile from her (I currently am still here). If we didn&#39;t have kids with us we would have went to Santa Fe where we are ALWAYS warmly welcomed. 

Amazing service can save an experience where the food isn&#39;t to ones liking, I have returned to many places because the service was amazing. However, amazing food cannot save terrible customer service. The guest leaves with that taste in their mouth. 

I know when our pizza gets here it is going to be fantastic, however, I also know when anyone asks me about Barones I will not forget to let them know that although the pizza is great, steer clear of the short haired tan waitress.... Ruined my evening here."

We wanted to try a different pizza place. We ordered at 5 o&#39;clock thinking by 6 we would have our food. The delivery guy didn&#39;t show up until 6:30. We didn&#39;t receive a call from the restaurant saying it would take a little longer or anything about our orders status. I called and asked how long it would take since we ordered over an hour ago. We ordered 2 small pizzas, a Caesar salad and a house salad. Not very good! The food was disgusting, it was like frozen pizza. My wife ordered a small cheese pizza with extra pizza sauce on the side. Well we got a small &#34;cheese pizza&#34; with no sauce and under cooked cheese. Basically cheese bread. Definitely not what we were expecting based on all the reviews on YELP. Not looking for reimbursement or a reply from the owner, just letting others know that this is not the place to go for pizza.

I&#39;m a bit underwhelmed by Lou Malnati&#39;s and I&#39;ve yet to try Giordano&#39;s. But today I wanted a pizza. So I hopped on and found Barone&#39;s nearby in Glen Ellyn. Ordered online and wavered between it and Giordano&#39;s to try next. I was pleasantly surprised to see that a stuffed pizza with four toppings plus an entree sized salad was the same price as a three topping stuffed pizza alone at Giordano&#39;s. So this place got my money.

Went and picked up my food and brought it home. One of the first things I noticed was the people in the kitchen shredding the mozzarella. Nice to see that. I also saw someone putting individual ingredients into their own little bowls instead of grabbing from a large container of ingredients. Also nice to see.

Got my pizza, my salad, and picked up a couple pieces of cheesecake that looked pretty good. My review will not include the dessert because those are still sitting in the fridge. We were too full to think about that. Later.

The pizza had a great flavor and the crust was very nice. It had a nice buttery texture similar to Lou Malnati&#39;s. My partner said he isn&#39;t a huge fan of Lou Malnati&#39;s and prefers Giordano&#39;s when it comes to the big chains. But he preferred Barone&#39;s overall. Great flavor, good bake, and plenty filling.

When we crave pizza, we&#39;ll definitely be coming back here as our first choice in the area. Pequod&#39;s will still reign as our overall favorite though."

Normally, I&#39;m not a big fan of tiramisu, but I ate every bite. It&#39;s made in house. My kids love tiramisu so I brought some home for them and they loved it too.

Sadly, my phone was dead and I could not check in but I still really wanted to write a review.

I was fully planning to cheat on my gluten free diet because the place we were planning to eat was already closed and I was certain that an Italian style eatery was not going to be able to accommodate my eating plan. I was WRONG! Not only did they have gluten free pizza crust and pasta, they have a gluten free menu that has a really nice selection of items. 

Our server, Georgia, was friendly and attentive and when we asked about the gluten free crust for the pizza she couldn&#39;t be more helpful. We ordered soup to start, minestrone, and it was fantastic! She brought us a sample of one of the other soups were were interested in because we were on the fence about trying something new. We were really touched by the gesture, it ended up being two or three bites for each of us and we loved it (Cream of Chicken with jalapeno). 

My husband ordered gluten free pasta with white clam sauce, they offer red clam sauce as well, and was very pleased with the texture of the pasta. He felt that he got plenty of clam meat and that it was seasoned really well. It was a huge portion and we both felt the price was fair, not too high.  

I ordered a simple cheese pizza on gluten free crust, which was one of the best GF crusts I have had! When I ordered, our server Georgia had forgotten to tell us that there were two types of GF crusts and so she chose one for me that she thought I would like. Because she TOOK the time to talk to me and find out what I was looking for, she was able to make that decision and I was very glad to put my faith in her. She was right, the crust was awesome! Their sauce is a lovely balance of savory with a hint of sweet and plenty of herbs. There was just the right amount of sauce and cheese, I hate when places skimp on the sauce!

This is a place where you can celebrate with family and enjoy a really great meal in a really nice place. 

We will be back!"

The dining room area was real small so people were moving chairs and waiters running everywhere, a semi controlled choas.  We ordered a medium thin crust pepperoni and onion pizza.

The restaurant is clearly understaffed in all areas from the take out window to the bus boys to the wait staff.  I think it is likely due to the fact the location is so small that they just can&#39;t fit any more staff in there at any given time.  A helpful hint - if u dine in you are going to see your waitress exactly three times; once to order, then to deliver food to table and then to bring the check.

Always on the lookout for great pizza, and there are a lot of carryout places around us, not as many sit-down. So we thought we&#39;d venture to Glen Ellyn (not nearly as far as it used to be) and try out Barone&#39;s.

This is not a huge place, and it&#39;s kind of old-school, cozy and definitely very popular with the locals. It was nearly full when we arrived (5:30ish?) and jam-packed by the time we left. Lots of folks waiting for carryout. 

We got a big loaf of bread plus olive oil and butter right away, but our water was quite slow to arrive. Got the impression that a bus boy was supposed to bring it but it never happened; thankfully the waitress picked up the slack pretty well and our refills were well attended after that.

We ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and a medium deep-dish (pan), just cheese. See, I told you -- lots of cheese.

The mozzarella sticks were homemade and served with a great chunky marinara. They were not steaming hot, which definitely made them easier to eat but also made me wonder how long they&#39;d been out of the fryer. 

The pizza was also a reasonable temperature, with gooey cheese, tasty sauce and a buttery crust that was one of the better I&#39;ve had. A touch of garlic would be perfection. I also appreciated that they proffered us red pepper flakes, parmesan shaker and oregano -- I enjoy some oregano. 

It was noisy thanks to tons of families and people waiting, and the wait staff was clearly kind of frazzled; I think they did as well as they could. 

I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back, but maybe not on a Friday night next time."

So happy we did!  Our waitress Georgia was the sweetest!  Brought us out some hot bread with Italian seasonings and mentioned she heard we were first timers and to be sure to ask for the seasonings when we return since its only brought out by request. 
 Had the mussels to start. .... if I could have made out with the broth without being judged, I would have!  SO good.
We then ordered a thin crust cheese mushroom and olive pizza. Perfectly cooked! 
After wen paid we stayed for an additional 45 min or so and the place was closing down. They never once tried to shoo us out

I would be lying if I said i didn&#39;t buy a white chocolate covered rice krispy on the wayway out. YuM!"

The thin crust is nice and crispy, with the perfect meltiness of cheese. The deep dish uses a TON of really tasty tomatoes and plenty of cheese, with a great buttery crust. We&#39;re talking a ton of butter here...maybe literally! I usually, like a good Chicagoan, get sausage on the pizza, and it has always been good sized chunks, tasty, spiced perfectly and moist. Their pasta&#39;s are pretty good, and I have always been a huge fan of their Baked Mostaccioli. 

Parking can be a pain on a busy night, so keep that in mind. You may have to walk a bit. If you&#39;re doing carryout, the best bet is to take a passenger to run in and get it while you wait in the car in the parking lot."

We ordered a large thin crust for 2 of us with the idea of leftovers. Pizza was done quick In 30min. The pizza was good but pretty greasy. Sauce was also good, not too sweet which I like. I would recommend ordering a size up from whatever you originally planned as we are the entire 14&#34; between the two of us. The pieces were cut very small as if it were cut for children which I thought was odd but not something to prevent me from returning. I like this pizza and will more than likely come back as it is hard to find good pizza in the burbs."

There was a wait, which is a good sign.  The restaurant itself has that well-worn Italian family feel about it that never quite gets old to me, despite the fact that there are seemingly millions of restaurants with a similar atmosphere... but hey, comfort food is comfort food, and if the atmosphere is home-like and welcoming, the food is all that much better in my opinion...

The pizza itself was stellar.  Very, very stout- if that term makes sense for pizza.  Definitely dense, but that&#39;s because there&#39;s probably 5 pounds of cheese on the pie.  If you take issue with this, you shouldn&#39;t have Chicago-style deep dish pizza in the first place.  I personally have no problem with being cheesed-to-death, and even if I were lactose-intolerant, it wouldn&#39;t matter.  Even if I get put into a lactose-induced coma, I got an article in my living will that says that they gotta pipe in liquified deep dish pizza through a trach tube.  

If you think that&#39;s a bit zealous of me, you don&#39;t understand deep dish.  Eat it."

It&#39;s almost as good as yesterday, which says a lot for any food, especially pizza. And while I might prefer the sauce and toppings of places such as Giordano&#39;s, they could learn a thing or two about bread making. Barone&#39;s will make sure no carb is left behind, and I&#39;m pretty sure they coat their pans with real butter.

Our Pizza Connoisseurs club met for our monthly meeting. Rebecca R&#39;s boyfriend suggested the place and this was his one shot to impress us or forever be banned from pizza picking. He did not disappoint. We came on a weekday and the place wasn&#39;t dead, but was still able to seat all nine of us immediately. We just had to be careful not to pass it by, because the signage could definitely be upgraded so it doesn&#39;t look like an out-of-business business.

Drink orders were taken immediately and a giant loaf of fresh bread was plopped onto the table. We vanquished it and requested a second basket. They also brought out salt, pepper, Parmesan, crushed red pepper and oregano. But the main event was definitely the Chicago-style pizza: veggie for some, half pepperoni and sausage, and a plain cheese personal for my friend. Everyone walked away happy and brought leftovers. Our four pizzas, wine, beer and other beverages came out to a whopping $100 for 9 of us. Not too shabby."

My husband and I order a pizza from here at least once a month and we are never disappointed. We live just a couple blocks from this place so we most often walk to pick up our pizza. There have been times where we have company or are ordering on the way home from the airport where we have it delivered and it takes just a little longer than the pickup time. 

We always get pepperoni with green olives, well done. It&#39;s great, you should try it. Their house salad is great too as it&#39;s a chopped with peppers, onions, cheese, lettuce, and cucumbers.

One of the nicest features of Barone&#39;s is their &#34;Kids Room&#34;, where your rug-rats can play while your waiting for your meal.  Again, being new to the area, we don&#39;t have a babysitter, so the kids room where our son can play and we can see him is fantastic for giving us as close to a date-night as we can get right now.  The food is great (the Eggplant parmesan is our favorite), and the pricing is pretty fair as well.  The only challenge sometimes is the parking, but if you hunt around you can find a spot.

Ok, so the pizza here isn&#39;t THAT epic, but it&#39;s honestly some of the best stuffed I&#39;ve had in a long time.  It&#39;s inspirational pizza here at Barone&#39;s.  It&#39;s the kind of pizza that gets you talking about other places you&#39;ve been to, and how much better the pizza you are currently noshing on is than those other wannabe, player-hating pizzas.

Our server Rafael was very polite, even apologetic when it came to interrupting our talkative group to ask a few questions.  He recommended we order two 12&#34; pizzas if we were going to do the stuffed.  And a mere 25 or so minutes later, we were diving right into pizza bliss.  The crust was firm on top and chewy on the bottom; it had clearly fallen victim to the sheer volume of gooey mozzarella inside and the sweet, chunky tomato sauce on top.  The cheese was stuffed all the way through the &#34;handle&#34; part of the crust.  It&#39;s the kind of setup that taunts you into having a second piece and then immediately regret your decision after two or three bites.  Or maybe that was just me.

All in all for five of us, two 12&#34; stuffed one-ingredient pies and five soft drinks came out to $11-$12 per person with tax and a generous gratuity.  That&#39;s a downright steal!  

If you&#39;re not totally stuffed or deep-dished out of your mind, there is a generous spread of italian desserts like cannoli, tiramisu and flavored cheesecakes on display on the way out.  If calories matter not to you, I recommend you try a cannoli.  One day, I might too!"

It&#39;s usually not as cool as seen in the movies, and believe it or not, my hands hardly move, and I&#39;m almost always asked to speak up during conversation. However, I&#39;m not so far removed that I oblivious to the difference between delivery and DiGiorno. Well, sometimes they are interchangeable. I don&#39;t care how many days a year Sarpinos delivers. It sucks. Barone&#39;s serves a flavorful Italian cuisine, delivery or dine-in. You&#39;d almost expect plastic coverings on the booths. They have at least checked their gaudiness at the door before setting up shop. 

I&#39;m usually not too tempted to dive in to deep dish. To me, deep dish has more of a resemblance to cake than pizza, and is just too filling to consume the amount of pieces my heart sets itself upon. However, I am cheerfully able to shift my element to the deeper side of things at Barone&#39;s. One bite of deep dish, and my memories of thin crust are thrown into the thickness of my subconscious. My pizza was stuffed with roasted red peppers and green peppers. I had to retain some sort of consistency or else my pharmacy wouldn&#39;t be able to close that night. Just the perfect balance of the delicious unknown paired with my veggie friends. Pizza time in Glen Ellyn was just right. 

I have to admit that my pizza cravings have been relentless. I mean, I start off the week having a slice of grilled vegetable pizza for lunch, the next day I&#39;ll have a slice of margherita pizza, and I always have an emergency supply of frozen pizzas in my freezer. During my down time at work, those anxious moments just before my lunch break, I&#39;m consumed with the memories of the pizza I had the night before. And if it was from Barone&#39;s, it&#39;ll be in my Yelp lunch box the next day."

Every time we would head up to Glen Ellyn to visit my wife&#39;s family we made it a priority to order some Barone&#39;s pizza. Once all of my yankee in-laws got past the fact that I enjoy a simple pepperoni pizza, we would place our order and make the short drive to pick it up(I have dined in 1 time but at the time I was a little too tipsy to remember the experience). 

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the fact that I am surrounded by family i don&#39;t see that often, or if it&#39;s the fact that I am in a different city, but Barone&#39;s is the best pizza i have ever had.

He finally gave up and said he was just not going to get a beer. The waitress just said okay sorry. A good place woulda been like hey I brought you these samples. Let me know which one you want. Sorry for this issue. That could be why this place is empty on a Saturday night. Then we order some food. I order the TBM burger and my buddy does the same. They were out of tater tots so we had to pick something else out with or burger. My other buddy orders a goodfella pizza. It comes out my burger looks red. I ordered medium well. Halfway through I stop eating and ask my buddy if his burger is disgusting to he says yes. My buddy that ordered pizza only ate 2-3 pieces and said his was soggy and pretty much disgusting. I tried a bite and agreed. I stopped eating my burger and immediately felt like I was going to be sick. My friend did as well. We barely touched any of our food and one of the few times the waitress came over she didn&#39;t even ask if everything was okay. We waited another 10 minutes for our check then we asked her to just split between 4 cards. It took her over 20 minutes to complete this simple task with the managers assurance. The manager never once came over and said sorry about the beers being out, sorry about the wait, or hey sorry you guys didn&#39;t enjoy the food. This place is not good to go to get a beer or get food. Do not waste your time. Lack of management  has ruined this place. Their food sucks. They do not update beer menus or even the chalkboards (would be extremely easy to update or just simply erase a beer that is out).  Also the area where they usually have trivia was an eye sore and just a complete mess they tried to cover with a banner. If you skipped to the bottom of this review, JUST DO NOT COME HERE. It is not cheap prices food ether, but it is cheap ingredients. My friend and I literally spent the night throwing up from the TBM burger. That is what fueled me to even write this review. This place didn&#39;t care about the customer. The waitress didn&#39;t. The manager on duty didn&#39;t. It was pathetic. It literally made me sick, literally. Avoid this place at all costs. 

Update: 

Emailed the beer market team yesterday as told to in a comment. No email back over 24 hours later. No surprise, not great customer service either."

Staff either ignores you or forgets part of what you asked for.  Food is OK - just OK.  Limited menu.  We showed up on a summer night and asked to sit outside - we had a friend sitting inside so we told them we would wait inside.  3 different sets of people were sat outside as tables opened up (all showed up after us by quite a bit of time).  When we asked we were told that our inside server said don&#39;t bother, so we asked for outside again, and again were passed over.  Just not going back - stupid dumb and the food and drinks don&#39;t make up for it."

I come here relatively often primarily for the VERY large selection of beers. And free samples of drafts which is awesome. The food just isn&#39;t up to par, but that&#39;s usually not what I come here for. Also, live music which can be good or bad depending on the group. If it&#39;s just to chill and watch a game, ok for live music. If it&#39;s catching up with a long lost friend, not good bc it&#39;s quite loud. Lol either way, check it out, avoid the food if you&#39;re not actually hungry, and you&#39;ll be solid."

The food is always pretty good and there&#39;s a decent beer selection. The service is continually slow even when the bar isn&#39;t busy. I&#39;m also a little peeved they can&#39;t update their menus. The server told us that most of the seasonal beers listed were gone, and then the beer dubbed &#34;beer of the month&#34; has been gone for a week. Considering it&#39;s mid-October that seems like poor planning. So feel free to go, drink a beer, eat a pretzel- and it won&#39;t be disappointing if you don&#39;t expect too much."

PROS: 
Great location with easy free parking. The atmosphere was inviting. There are lots of tvs on the wall, and the decorations are nice yet not overpowering. The beer menu is extensive. It definitely gave us a bit of stress. Luckily, the waitress was very knowledgeable on IPAs and the menu. She helped me pick a nice IPA with citrus notes. My husband didn&#39;t ask for her help, and he didn&#39;t like his beer. [Shocker!] The place was exceedingly clean for a bar. The display of beers on the main brick wall was well done, too. We did not eat from the food menu. We left after one beer simply because the band was loud, and we didn&#39;t like yelling. [I think we&#39;re happily past our bar days.]

CONS:
The bathroom was stark white, which was a drastic contrast to the restaurant/bar. Once in Chicago, I saw a bar&#39;s bathroom wall lined with (cut) boxes from the 6 packs. They stapled the logo rectangles side-by-side to one main wall so no space remained in between. This place could easily do this, given their encyclopedia of beer options. Personally, I&#39;d laminate them first and then staple onto the wall and paint the remaining walls a warm color. So yes, the CON to this place is me focusing on how the decorate their bathroom. [Please don&#39;t think I&#39;m weird!] lol"

We basically seated ourselves.  Waited 10 mins till one of the waitresses/wait or approached us.  As we waited for another friend we skimmed through the menu. Nothing really looked appealing but we were starving.  Ended up ordering a pizza, wings and a pretzel.  It was ok for me it was bland.  I heard this place was good but the one in Schaumburg.  Couple things that made the score as low as if is.  Service was poor.  Food was bland. And there was a stench that we all noticed.  It was the menus  guess they don&#39;t clean them or something. But I gave them two stars cause their restrooms were clean."

The list on the wall was 5 days old and my first couple choices they were out of on draft. We also went through 3 ciders on the menu and they were all out. It is one thing to have this large menu but it needs to be kept up to date or at least up to date on the website if not on the menus. 

All beers are $6-$14 for a regular pour but you can buy bombers for $20+. Flights? No idea, our waitress really didn&#39;t have an interest in talking to us even though we tried. The food was decent and I would recommend the kickin&#39; pickles. You get 5 pickle spears with an amazing cajun/mayo sauce. 

Sadly, this is a one and done place for me."

The beer flights were fabulous - pick any 4 beers on tap and get a flight. I LOVED the Blueberry Hill.

Food-wise our group started with parmesan garlic fries which were delish but could have used some truffle oil. For our entrees we got the &#39;small plate&#39; shrimp tacos which I highly recommend, they come in an order of 3. We also got the Chicken Parmesan which was yummy, very large portion but had a bit of spice to it that I wasn&#39;t expecting. We also got the Big Cheese Pizza (because i&#39;m obsessed with goat cheese) and after our server heard us debating over whether or not to get another pizza with spinach on it, he put spinach on our big cheese!

We spent several hours here and it never got too loud or crowded. It&#39;s well setup and has a great ambiance. Besides awesome food, beer, and setting what REALLY took this place over the top was the service!! 
Our server Pascal was very knowledgeable and was assertive about which beers were good and which weren&#39;t, without being pushy. He never made us feel rushed and even took the time to chat beer with us.  He gave us all the sample taster we asked for without a bother and even brought us a couple that we didn&#39;t request but he thought we&#39;d be interested in. One of the best servers i&#39;ve had. MUCH better than the Naperville WOB location which is employed by know-it-all beer snobs who talk down to beer novices.

The atmosphere is warm and comfortable and the live bands and trivia are a fun time.
The food, however, is insanely over priced for what you get. The onion dip and pub chips were a joke, you get a thimble of dip and a mound of chips. They will refill your dip if you ask, but you will literally have to refill it about five times to finish off your chips (which are heavy and greasy). I also had the creamy chicken soup and I don&#39;t know if it was just an off night, but there wasn&#39;t anything creamy about it. No broth, just thick porridge- like rice and chicken. But hey, the place is called Beer Market and the beer is where it&#39;s at.

Been a semi-regular here for a couple years that spends a good chunk of change. Used to have the best group of employees. Beer selection is great! But many bars are offering craft now. 

I walked in today - 12/27/15 - n waited about 20 mins, keep in mind there were not that many people there. Bartender ignored me.. I then got her attention n she snapped at me about some previous experience n said she doesn&#39;t want to serve me. I have no idea who she is n why she would take it out on me. Why should I waste me time n money after that?! 

I think her name is Cassie.. Ef her! Yup, I said it. She should get fired n I promised I will do what I can to encourage others not to go there. How does management condone that type of employee? Plenty of other places to enjoy good service.

Everything on their food menu is great, been here a couple times. Would recommend any of their burgers, in house made pizza, or their giant pretzel.... It&#39;s huge. Staff is great and friendly. Shouldn&#39;t have a problem unless your a snob.  great vibes and live music on Friday and Saturdays nights. You&#39;ll have a great time on your own or with friends.

We had a great server to make recommendations, offer samples and guide us as well, which was needed and great. I wish I had realized sooner that they had a beer cocktails page- mixed beers running between $6-8 each. Would&#39;ve liked to sample more of those. Oh well, maybe next time.

I came here around 730 on a Friday, and this place was bumpin&#39;! Thankfully for a smaller table we didn&#39;t have to wait, but the group in front of us with 6 people were quoted a 30 minute wait time, so be prepared for that during high volume times.

Since it was hot, the had the patio area open, and some fans on, but it definitely felt muggy inside. Thankfully there was cold beer to no end, I guess! 

We ordered food a little later- I had a chicken cesar wrap with fries. I thought the wrap was good, had a nice portion of chicken, asparagus, romaine, and the dressing seemed house made- was more vinaigrettey than creamy, but still delish. I was a little surprised to see a $1.50 charge to add on fries. Seems unfair that a wrap that was already over $10 had an upcharge for a side. The kitchen must&#39;ve been backed up too, because the food service time was pretty slow. Definitely be ready to wait for your food at busy times!

You can&#39;t go wrong with The Beer Market in Bolingbrook. 1) Spacious bar with plenty of seats at the bar or the main floor has a ton of high top and low tables. 2) Awesome beer selection, with I&#39;d say hundreds of bottles in case something off the tap isn&#39;t your style. 3) Food, to start the pub chips are homemade and delicious. Great start for an appetizer or to keep it light have them as your meal. The Goodfella pizza is amazing and a perfect size for 2 people, especially after having those pub chips. My husband and I do find that certain servers are slow and you will be with an empty beer for a while. While other servers are chatty and will recommend beer, provide samples and such. Since we live local we try to go at more quiet times, such as during the week around 4p-7p and have never had a problem with finding a seat or the service. 

Just a tip, if you sit at the bar you have a chance to try so many more since all the taps are right there and most of the bartenders are extremely nice and really talkative. Plus I love to look in the cases and view all the different beer bottles from around the world. 

During the summer months they have a great outside patio area filled with high and low top tables. This is one of our favorite places to go and sit outside after a round of golf."

Four stars for service AT THE BAR.  

After eating dinner at The Nest in Bolingbrook, my friend and I wanted to grab an after dinner drink and I wanted to hit up a place I haven&#39;t been to...this being one of the many.  So it&#39;s Memorial Day weekend and Sunday night.  The outside was full so we went inside.  I&#39;d say the inside was maybe less than 1/4 full - there was  a large group in the middle of the place but people scattered about otherwise.  There was plenty of seating at the bar open as well.  We sat at a table near the outside patio, figured we&#39;d get service being close to the other tables....WRONG!

I probably flipped through the 23 page menu three times, decided on what I wanted ...and sat, and sat, and sat.... we saw plenty of staff walk by and completely ignore us.  We were going to walk out but decided to go sit at the bar instead....we both knew what we wanted, and well we just didn&#39;t want to leave, and I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t.

The bartender, on the otherhand made up for the awful service we previously got - he cleaned the area, gave us a food and drink menu.  The food menu looks pretty fab, so I definitely plan on going back to eat that&#39;s for sure.  He asked us if we wanted anything to eat, or dessert but we were stuffed full from our dinner we just wanted a drink (see my review for The Nest, that&#39;s how full we were!)

I did tell him I wanted to return for a &#34;Not Your Father&#39;s Rootbeer Beer/Rootbeer Float&#34;  he said he was out of that since Friday anyway...but I&#39;m totally going back for one!

My friend and I opted for drinks from the back of the menu - which were duos of beer, some had three mixed together like the one I had.  The prices were VERY reasonable and much better selection, as well as price as opposed to the Beer House in Lombard.  Comparable place but this place knocks that place out of the park overall.  

Definitely going back here...because of the beer selection, and the service we got from the bartender.  I shouldn&#39;t have to move to get better service but waiting roughly 20 minutes and not greeted usually means I should leave and find elsewhere to go.  Again, glad I stayed."

We were seated after about 10 minutes but waited several more before a server took our order. I had a glass of water and was never offered a refill and my husband had a beer and a Pepsi and was offered a refill only when he asked for the check. 

We ordered the hummus and guacamole appetizer tray that also had hot beer cheese. It took longer then an app that didn&#39;t need to be cooked should have taken, in my opinion. 

I ordered the chicken and waffles sliders with bacon and honey drizzle and a side of fries.  The chicken was dry, the bacon was slightly burned, the fries were limp, as if the oil was not got enough or they sat under a heat lamp too long. I thought as a pub at the very least the fries would be a home run. My husband ordered the Goodfella pizza, it was good, but not as hot as it could have been."

Trivia night on Wednesdays at 8pm here! Our group had a lot of fun playing trivia while enjoying a few mixed drinks and trying out a few beers. Oh, and no big deal or anything but... we WON! 

Their beer selection is fantastic, with a nice bar display and cool signs everywhere that fit the theme, but unfortunately we caught them on a bad night when their beer cooler was broken.

Their Parmesan fries were SO good. I can&#39;t wait to get them again. Their pretzel... even though you&#39;re envisioning it large.. is even larger than that. Their pizza was great too, good snacky foods and generous portions.

I&#39;ll definitely come back here again, and I&#39;ll bring friends with me."

I arrived at 5:25pm and the place had maybe 2 tables taken. There was no one at the host stand and I waited a good full 5 minutes before I was helped. The hostess came over and said I could sit anywhere. They have a huge menu of beer and drinks and a smaller food menu. I was disappointed to see not everything on their online menu was actually on their menu. Food varies in prices but since it is typical pub food, try to go for the cheaper items. My friend ordered their giant pretzel, it was ok but lacked flavor. I got the chips and dip and the dip was pretty good, but again I felt like the potatoes lacked flavor. My wedge salad was good and my friends both had the pizza and that was good too. Pizza is 50% off on Monday nights. My main issue is that we were in there over 2 HOURS on a Monday night when the restaurant was half full. The service was unbearably slow. A manager brought our food out and apologized because he said our ticket printed and no one could read it so the kitchen THREW IT OUT so it caused a delay. Did we get anything off for that? No, of course not. I don&#39;t understand how kitchen staff would think it&#39;s ok to just throw out a ticket without double checking. Anyway, I don&#39;t think I will be back."

The beer list is a book (literally) and can be quite overwhelming if you don&#39;t know what you want but our server was very patient and knowledgeable, offering tastes of anything and that piqued our curiosity.  

We came in for lunch on New Years day with a demanding group of 8, lucky for the staff that the place was empty.  We ordered beer and a bunch of appetizers and other dishes.  I was impressed that everything came out exactly as ordered and with no mistakes and it was all delicious!  We were absolutely blown away by the quality of the food - totally not expected to like it so much.

Highlights:  Chicken and Waffle Sliders!  I think another reviewer use the word &#34;orgasmic&#34; to describe them and that pretty much sums it up.  We also loved the Queen Pizza and the Bavarian Pretzels (we ordered two not thinking they would be plate sized - huge!! - but one would have been more than enough).  The mustard sauce on the side of the pretzel was great, the beer-cheese dip, not so much.  

We also ordered the Pulled Pork Chili (very good) and the Crispy Asparagus which was another stand-out.  Though they don&#39;t have a kids menu, the Mac n&#39; Cheese was delicious and suitable for them.  I also recommend their dessert waffle, ours was topped with ice cream, nutella and whipped cream.  And we topped it all off with a &#34;Root Beer Shot&#34; -  adults only version of achoholic root beer that is so yummy!  I love this place - we will be regulars!"

It&#39;s a win. For an appetizer we always get the soft pretzel which is really enough for like 6 ppl. This time I got the pork belly tacos which were amazing and my sisters got burgers. Their fries were under seasoned as we&#39;re their chips. Def a little on the pricy side though each flight of beer was like 12 dollars."

I came on a Sunday, about 2:30ish. There were a fair amount of people there, but it wasn&#39;t overly crowded. We chose a high-top table next to the fireplace. Michelle,  our waitress was friendly, attentive, and quickly brought our drinks (Lindemans Frambroise for me). For food, I had the Beer Bratwurst, which came with pub chips. The other half had the mac and cheese,  which looked fabulous.

They where completely understaffed and the beer menu was completely under par. A majority of their beers on the list where either out of stock or they no longer carried it. I got in contact with the local manager and he came up with a whole list of excuses to put the blame on someone else, such as a few people called off, our new menus have been delayed do to the printing company, him recently taking over the location and trying to revamp the food and drink menus and so on. 
For one I am sure you have more than enough servers on your entire staff, so if 1 or 2 or even 3 for that night quit or called off, you should have had some kind of backup. And, even considering changing your menu right before your biggest night of the year is the poorest planning ever. I was told from the manager that the printing company was located in Indiana, so if they where delayed, where was the effort to possibly drive there really quick and pick them up the day before or even that morning. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re ten states away.

Oh and not to mention, this was the busiest night or the year for them, &#34;The Tree Lighting Ceremony&#34; that is held every year in the Bolingbrook promenade.

I have contacted the manager numerous times, via e-mail, Facebook messenger and  even over the phone. I have been promised compensation for the horrible experience I received that evening and have been told that he tired to mail me an apology letter along with a gift card. I was also told he tried calling my phone and was told I was no longer at work, but that is impossible, considering I gave him only my cell phone number, which has been the same for 10 plus years. I only received a phone call once I told him via Facebook Mesenger that I was going to blast our messages and post my experience on a reviews. I decided not to do that originally because I was told that he was going to personally drive the letter and gift card to my house and hand it to be.

Now two to three weeks later I still haven&#39;t received any contact from him or any compensation. From the way the manager has been treating an upset customer and blowing me off for the last three to four months, I fully understand why the service was the way it was that night. If a manager can&#39;t do his job, then how does anyone expect his employees to know what to do."

I didn&#39;t see much hype over the Pizza but it&#39;s Monday night and our sever said they were serving half price pizza. I got the cheese pizza and half with mushroom. It was really good! Me and my friend split the fried pickle spears which were also pretty good. The beers and service were good. The atmosphere is nice and clean with many tvs. My friend and I said right away that we would definitely come back here.

The positives: they have a large selection of beer. The food isn&#39;t bad. 
The negatives, as someone that likes to enjoy the beer, to me average cost of seven dollars a bottle is a bit excessive, if it&#39;s a special release, I will gladly pay twice that, however for regular releases, too much.
I wasn&#39;t happy with the service, it wasn&#39;t crowded but it took a long time just to order food. I was at the point of leaving and heading down the street to teds   
All and all, it&#39;s not a bad place but I&#39;d prefer to head to a brewery or Binnys instead of being raped at the cost of this place"

I had been wanting to try this place and now I&#39;m mad I didn&#39;t try it sooner. 

The beer menu is insane! 100&#39;s of craft beers to choose from. I started with a flight so I could determine my favorite. They are happy to bring you free samples of anything you&#39;d like to try though. I couldn&#39;t really tell how knowledgable the waitress was about the list. That&#39;s my fault though because I never actually asked her anything. 

The food was delish! Chicken waffle sliders. Amazing! I&#39;ve been thinking about them nonstop ever since. The wings were great too! Someone had a burger and a pizza and everyone at the table was thrilled with what they received. 

Parking can be a bit of a pain here. That&#39;s typical with this shopping center though. I&#39;m trying to make plans to get back here ASAP!"

Went this evening with my boyfriend, very disappointing. Beer was good and they had $4 local bottles but the $4 burger wasn&#39;t even worth the $4. Ordered it medium came out well done. Parmesan fries have changed from what they used to be, tasted like frozen fries with some oil added, asked for the sauce they used to serve it with but the guy said he couldn&#39;t remember. Potato skins are really just an overpriced baked potato, not actual skins just all potato. Took forever to get everything, our server forgot our second round of beers but once we asked you could tell he had an &#34;oh crap&#34; moment. Honestly it was just awful and wanted to leave.

Why? Because I need an excuse to drink more beer.... JK I don&#39;t need an excuse.  Why? because the menu is full of your not so typical bar food, which is a great thing I get sick of wings and wraps all the time. I tired the Beer Brat and I didn&#39;t care for it too much. The pretzel roll was good but it was too large for the brat I was done with my brat in 3 bites and still have half the bun left. Also the caramelized onions were good, so was the sauerkraut however the both of them together, along with that dark mustard wasn&#39;t that great. the chips that came with the brat were awesome, I could of had 2 more baskets of them. Now my friend had the chicken and waffle sliders and after one bite he wanted to order another order. He was in chicken, bacon, and waffle heaven. For an appetizer we ordered the parmesan fires and they were the best thing I ate all day. Seriously, they were awesome. 

Now the beer, the beer selection is crazy almost too much. At first I thought that they could cut it in half and still have a great selection then I realized that choice is good and they really put thought into breaking down the menu to help you deciding what you want. They have a larger selection of bottles and cans over draft. They also offer a beer flight option where you can select your own beers and you can sample anyone you want for free. 

The service was good. My first beer was flat and our waitress returned it and brought me something else without an issue. She also offered some suggestions when we told her about the type of beers we like. 

Looking forward to another visit"

The beer menu is about 10x&#39;s the length of the food menu - prepare yourself.  They do offer pairing suggestions on their food menu and they are willing to give you tasting samples so that you are confident in what you choose to put in a pint. Each of their draft beer includes a beer classification, description, ABV, and serving glass.

For food, we ordered the fried asparagus, bratwurst, and the BBQ burger.  The deep fried asparagus was difficult to eat because the stem was too fibrous for the finger food appetizer it was being presented in.  The garlic aoli was awesome!  I actually asked for an additional side of it so I could dip chips and fries in it!  YUM!  The brat is served with grilled onions and sauerkraut all on a pretzel roll.  I would highly recommend ordering this!

The beer menu itself can be overwhelming, it&#39;s bigger than a Cheesecake Factory menu, but only 1 double-sided page is their draft selection and the rest is bottles and some specialties like mixed beers.  What had me over the moon here is how attentive and friendly the service was, especially when we asked for samples (free, by the way).

The samples are small, but enough to help you decide what you&#39;d like to drink.  I sampled the Sea Dog Blue something (blueberry) and a Banana Bread beer, and I liked them both but ordered the Sea Dog.  I was surprised when my beer arrived with a few blueberries floating in my drink!   I also had a mixed beer - half cider and half Framboise, which was my favorite of the three.  I would love drinking this in summer, and it hardly tasted like beer.  I love that this craft beer craze occasionally throws something in that doesn&#39;t even taste like beer.

Beers are reasonably priced, most between $5.50-7.00.

I wasn&#39;t super hungry, but I wanted something to munch on while I drank so I ordered the Bavarian Pretzel.  The menu says this will serve four people, and I saw a couple at the bar sharing one, but damn it all to hell I wanted a pretzel.  My bud Courtney C. had a few bites, and I did take most of it home.  The seasoning was salty, but there was something unique about it, and the beer mustard and beer cheese served with the pretzel were so good that I finished both sauces.  The menu offers burgers, small plates, pizzas, salads, and appetizers.  It isn&#39;t a huge menu, but there is something for everyone.

On a Friday night, I wasn&#39;t surprised to see that it was very busy.  We arrived around 8:30 p.m. and were informed of a 45 minute wait.  Within about 15 minutes we found a seat at the bar (as another party left the bar and was seated), so we stayed at the bar the whole night.  I really do not like tall bar chairs, but the ones at the bar have backs, whereas the ones at the tables are just stools.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever preferred to stay at the bar, but there is a first time for everything.

There was also live music, a woman with a piano and acoustic guitar doing covers, but she had a great voice and I could still hold a conversation.  Also, there are a lot of TVs broadcasting various sports events.  

I love this place, and I would definitely come back.  It&#39;s a lot better than Beer House in Lombard in every way.  The Beer Market has really perfected their concept."

After several times visiting here I have to say that you shouldn&#39;t make a stop by because their service is absolutely horrible (unless you sit at the bar).   I&#39;ve never seen a more inept servers in my life.  In my past visits it was more of just a minor annoyance but on my last visit, I had all I can stand and I can&#39;t stands no more.

I don&#39;t mind that you may be too thrifty to have a seat yourself thing on Sunday because you don&#39;t want to pay for a hostess, but when I&#39;m seated for 5 minutes with servers walking back and forth past my table without giving me a menu, that is completely unacceptable.    You simply can&#39;t be that inept.

This isn&#39;t the first time it&#39;s happened on my visits, there and in order for me to rate a place with a selection of beer as great as this place has and food as great as this place has, you must realize the service is horrible.  It&#39;s not like the place have ever been super busy when I&#39;ve been here.  It&#39;s just as though they&#39;d be better off just eliminating the wait staff all together and having a walk up counter to replace them.

I mean honestly, I am a really good tipper and I really appreciate a good server, but the ones they have here honestly don&#39;t give a f***.  If you can put up with the wait time it may be worth a visit, get the fries with the sriracha sauce.  For the most part though it is a place to be avoided."

Its absolutely crazy how much time you could spend perusing the menu and still never make up your mind. Since I&#39;m pretty damn indecisive by nature, I checked out their beer menu before visiting and found they had a lot of selections that interested me.

A server came to our table pretty quickly and explained everything and broke the menu down for us. She told us that we could try as many different beers as we wanted as long as they were on draft. Since there&#39;s around 50 beers on drafts, one could leave with trying a shit ton of beer. As not to seem greedy though, we both tried 3. My favorite one I tried was the Zombie Killer, which tasted like cherries and more like a wine than a beer. (I ended up looking this one up on Beermenus.com and buying it for myself at a later time.) I also tried Wells Banana Bread Beer and liked it, but not as much as the same version from Two Brothers. My third sample was a Red Velvet one. This was not my kind of drink at all, so I&#39;m glad I got a free sample of it.

In the end, I wanted to order the Zombie Killer but the price tag scared me off. I noticed a lot of people on Yelp raving about the Smalltown Brewery Not Your Father&#39;s Root Beer. Since I&#39;m more into the mixed drinks/wine/cocktail versus craft beer side of things, I figured this would be right up my alley and I ordered it without sampling. Good choice because I&#39;m now hooked on it! The Beer Market was my craft-beer loving husband&#39;s version of heaven. We probably could have spent hours upon hours here with him ordering different beers he&#39;d never heard of, however we were on a tight agenda, so we were only able to grab a few samples and 2 drinks each.

We also ordered the siracha and parmesan wings and the fries with beer cheese. To start, everyone that knows me well knows I can&#39;t do HOT but for some reason, the siracha wings sounded good and I went against my instincts. I burnt the shit out of my mouth and I think we both blacked out while eating them. I&#39;ve had siracha on food before and I&#39;ve also had siracha aoli, but I guess I didn&#39;t realize that the wings would be completely covered in it and not just one little dot like I normally use. Oops. They were hella good though and I think I can now handle more HOT than I could in the past. The fries and beer cheese were amazing, however we got a huge basket of fries and only one small container of cheese. The ratio of cheese to fries was not proportionate and therefore, a bit of a letdown. We were going to ask for more, but we managed to keep snacking on the fries while we waited and eventually had not enough fries left to justify getting more cheese.

This is definitely my favorite beer bar in the &#39;burbs so far and I can&#39;t wait to get back here ASAP."

We were there early on a Saturday, so no issues with getting a table.  There are a few tables right when you enter, highly undesirable on a cold night.  Everything else is high top table or up 2 steps to get to the bank seating across from stools.  About half the stools have backs, lots of switching going on.

From my seat I could see 13 TVs, and I have no idea how many were behind me.  I would say this is a good spot to come and watch a game and have a few beers.  The beer selection is about the length of a dissertation and recommendations are made on the menu to accompany your food selection.  However, on a Saturday, the day after Black Friday, they had run out of some beers.  Poor planning.

The menu is limited, which is fine, and we split the chicken and waffles as an appetizer.  I have never had that before and I found it extremely dry, not sure if that is how it is supposed to be, not to my liking.  Our burgers were huge and done perfectly.  I wish I had room for the &#34;Not your father&#39;s root beer float&#34;, maybe another time.

I was kinda taken back by our $97 bill at lunchtime for 3 people and a few drinks? We had a few sandwiches and a few beers!? Expensive- yes I think so!! What really irritated me was our server charged us more and didn&#39;t tell us ahead of time for the extra side of sauce for our monster $13 pretzel! That&#39;s fine!!! I am not a beer lover so I traded my banana beer early on for my step daughters apple cider. Cool bar, monster assortment of beers, decent bar type food?? The pretzel was the best!!"

We made a reservation but it seemed like they just pulled two tables together when we arrived. First impression was a very neat place, lots of televisions, upbeat music, a lot on energy and entertainment. The online food menu looked good and the beer menu was fabulous. As other reviews have posted about terrible service, it was. One of the worst experiences in quite some time. At least 8 minutes before anyone came to take a drink order and that was the quickest we would see a server return. Servers were try to deliver drinks to our table that weren&#39;t ours. It was just a mess. Our server seemed to be pissed off the whole time. It looked like a manager walking around picking up menus and oblivious to what was going on in the restaurant. We asked why it was so hot in there and he said it was because we were near the door. Another server told us the air conditioning has been out for a couple days. It&#39;s like they need a &#34;Bar Rescue&#34;. I think if they get their systems running smooth and get some solid management that can be clear about expectations of the servers, it could be a great place. Maybe we&#39;ll give it another try in 6 months."

Prior to my appetite for brunch, I was next door at Lenscrafters getting my ray bans an ultra-sonic cleaning. Yes, sometimes you must treat your spectacles to a good scrubbing.

Any who and moving forward....

I walked pass the outdoor patio of The Beer Market and was greeted with a friendly hello by one of their servers. It just wasn&#39;t any hello I have ever heard before in the Bolingbrook sector. It was a &#34;Hello&#34; with an English accent. It was different yet welcoming.

I entered and asked to be seated outside if possible. The server in his awesome English accent replied &#34;This is your world...we are merely living inside of it. Yes you may sit outside&#34;. Now that I have officially typed way to many lines about an accent let&#39;s just reveal his name. [Carlos from Surrey].

On my mobile yelp app I noticed in a previous review they serve Chicken N&#39; Waffle sliders. All I read was candy bacon and syrup drizzle fo&#39; shizzle then homemade waffle and fried chicken breast...slap yo&#39; momma good. So I ordered it with the quickness. 

Now I really wasn&#39;t in the mood to drink. I asked for coffee and unfortunately they do not serve it. My server Carlos was resourceful like Sly Stallone in Rambo III and countered with a 10% ABV rootbeer called &#34;Not Your Father&#39;s Rootbeer&#34; on tap.
Straight from the Wauconda valley of Illinois where canoeing is the way of life. I agreed whole heartedly with the suggestion. The only thing that would have made this rootbeer even better was if Meryl Streep from the flick River Wild was to have poured it herself.

I sipped and sipped that rootbeer...holy freakin&#39; v*gina batman that was some tasty adult rootbeer. [Now I am talking to myself like Ralphie from the Christmas Story] I wonder if this brand new hidden gem could quite possibly be my new hangout. I mean they are brand new and I am sure still working out the kinks.

Fast forward and the Chicken N&#39; Waffle sliders arrived and I forgot to mention earlier I ordered a side of parmesan fries too. It was a delicious Sunday meal and have to say my experience was a positive one. Their beer menu is on steroids with like 400 beers to choose from.

I will make a second visit soon because them burgers look incredible in the photo section."

Food: Hubby ordered a burger with an egg which was pretty ok. There wasn&#39;t a lot of seasoning on the burger and the egg was cooked to hard, but other than that it was great. The housemade chips were good too. I ordered the chili, which was a HUGE amount and absolutely delicious. Very savory, and enough to eat half and bring home for a tiny bowl the next day.

Drinks: Huge beer fans here, and we love to try new stuff! We loved the ability to customize flights and the prices were pretty good. I can&#39;t wait to visit again!"

Had to work later that afternoon, so friends and I did a little early day-drinking and had a fantastic meal. 

Now that I spent a week thinking about going there, I&#39;m going to spend the next week thinking about going back. 

Carlos took very good care of us. He was funny, helpful and sincere; all things I appreciate in a server. 

We started with the Not Your Father&#39;s Root Beer, which tasted awesome and got a good buzz going for 11:30 in the morning. Maybe we should&#39;ve gotten some food first, or eaten, I dunno, anything. But it was great. 10% ABV on an empty stomach is really something. Also, they do it as an ice cream float. I have to come back for that some time soon.

Next was the beer cheese ale soup. To say this was tasty is an understatement. It was just cheesy enough, and just beer-y enough to create an awesome flavor. And unlike most cheese ale soups, it wasn&#39;t weighed down with a lot of cream and flour. It has a thing consistency that was nice for what it was. I skipped the popcorn atop mine because...ew. I don&#39;t like wet popcorn. A friend got it on his, tho, and didn&#39;t complain.

Next we got the parmesan fries. They were a little soggy, but I didn&#39;t mind that this time. The parmesan and rosemary really married well into a flavorful snack. And the fact that the cheese got hot and melty was a plus.

I ordered the chicken &amp; waffle sliders as my main dish. They came with a spicy buffalo/sriracha-ish sauce that really worked well against the sweetness of the syrup. The waffle was fluffy and well cooked, and the chicken inside was moist and tender. I enjoyed it. 

Oh, and they have beer. I couldn&#39;t end this review without mentioning that. They have a LOT of beer. They have 500 beers. Yes, 5-0-0! 

That&#39;s a lot of beer.

I had one. And not being a connoisseur, I don&#39;t even remember which one. Oh wait, yes, it was called a &#34;Dirty Ho.&#34; How could I forget that? 

Maybe it was the buzz I had going made me forget about what I was drinking.

Awesome place. Great food. Tons o&#39;beer for every taste. 

Come here. You&#39;ll like it. The end."

The beer: I believe they had 40+ on draft, and much more in bottles. The Not Your Father&#39;s Rootbeer was fabulous, as were the two cider beers I had. The guys also tried a few different beers, and seemed to enjoy them.

The atmosphere: We were able to sit outside and it was absolutely beautiful out. There are about 10 or so tables outside, which are in a little gated area. The entire restaurant opens up into the outdoor area, so we were able to see the bar/tables inside, tvs, etc. Bathrooms were very clean and spacious. The place had a very cool vibe to it.

The food: The food was okay. We started with the parm fries (see picture) as recommended by our waiter. They were okay. Slightly mushy due to the sauce they had in them. I had a veggie sandwich, which had copped zucchini, peppers, onions, mushrooms, etc. with goat cheese and a pesto-ish sauce (see picture). It was okay. Not sure I would order it again, but I am glad I tried it. It was served with homemade chips, which I wasn&#39;t aware of because I don&#39;t remember seeing the side item listed on the menu. They were pretty good, but came in a larger portion, and I probably would&#39;ve chosen a healthier option if given the choice. The guys each had sandwiches (one had a burger with an egg on it, the other had a PLT) and seemed to enjoy them (see pictures).

The service: Our waiter, Carlos, was pretty cool. He didn&#39;t rush us through our experience, gave us some great tips, and had a great sense of humor. 

Definitely worth trying if you are into beer, bar food, and chill atmosphere."

There are a few menu items worthwhile (parmesan fries, chicken waffle sliders), but otherwise they miss the mark. I hate to say it, but the chain restaurant Gordon Biersch (which is located just down the sidewalk in the Promenade) has far better food.

The bartender was able to recommend a couple of beers when the one I wanted was tapped out. Amazing beer selection (as one would hope for a place called Beer Market) with a menu that goes on for ages. They do a good job of breaking it down into the country beers are from along with the style of beer. 

We just ordered appetizers that were fine. Nothing special, just typical pub food. The fries were really good and crispy. The beer cheese sauce was mediocre. I wouldn&#39;t get it again with the fries because it was too liquidy and didn&#39;t stick to the fry well. 

The place is huge, but it&#39;s very noisy which is a problem if you actually want to talk to someone. If you&#39;re against human conversation, then this is the place for you!"

For example, the garlic aioli dip that comes with fries tastes like nothing, but their burgers are very tasty.  You won&#39;t be disappointed overall.

The biggest negative of the place is the way the restaurant is set up -- it&#39;s insanely noisy when it&#39;s moderately busy.  Between the music and the TVs and high ceilings everything echoes and it was hard to hear people at my own table.

The beer is where it&#39;s at though, and the staff is pretty knowledgeable and makes good recommendations if you ask.  This is a great place to get drinks after work or on a weekend, especially when it&#39;s warm and you can sit outside."

Had no idea what to expect when walking in besides that they would have beer. Walked past the place a lot and it never seemed to be very busy even during prime meal times. 

Anyways when we walked in we were treated by a great waitress who went over how the whole place works, like no hard liquor at all and only import/craft beers... So it was cool that we were able to taste test as many as we wanted but I&#39;m not much of a craft beer guy so it was more of a pain in the a** than anything. Can I just get a Sam Adams or something like that. So after settling on a beer I didn&#39;t really want we order some original hot wings and a burger and fries to share. Everything looks really good when it came out but the fries were cold so not very good. The wings tasted alright but close to half of the wings had broken bones (did they have a gorilla preparing the wings) and the burger was actually pretty good. However I was hoping for it all to be good since it isn&#39;t really cheap bar food. 

I am sure there is a great market for the craft beer wielding gastro-pub-esque place but it&#39;s probably not for me. Needless to say we will probably not be going back since the food and beer selection left me wanting more."

I suppose if you are really just going for the beer selection, you may not care about how great the food is.  I&#39;ve been here twice and both times the food was equally disappointing.  Not awful, but definitely not worth coming back for.

My first initial reaction to the place is that it&#39;s very spacious. Tables were spaced out by high tops. Considering that we arrived around 7 or 8 on a Monday, we took the big &#34;T&#34; table in the middle. The environment of the space reminded me of a basement that my friends would come down to drink, which gave that &#34;home&#34; feeling.

Our server, Sean, was excellent with service. He gave us recommendations of beer, since all of us had selective taste. Our group also warned him about all of us having separate checks, but he performed perfectly with splitting us up. 

The food is amazing. Pub food with awesome beer. We ordered the pretzel as an appetizer. One could feed all ten of us. The beer cheese sauce and the mustard aioli complimented the pretzel really well. I ordered the chicken and waffle sliders, which is to die for. The hot sauce seemed out of place since I have a sweet tooth, but overall really good."

-They were out of a LOT of things we tried to order.  &#34;What&#39;s the soup of the day?&#34; They were out. &#34;I&#39;ll have a Hefeweizen.&#34;  They were out. &#34;I&#39;d like the pulled pork sandwich.&#34;  Out.  Out. Out.
-They weren&#39;t that busy but things took a while.  Having been a waitress for many years, I am always understanding that things sometimes aren&#39;t the waitress&#39;s fault.  But this was ridiculous. The dinner salads took almost 15 minutes.  That&#39;s the waitress. When two people in our party ordered second drinks, they took forever to arrive.  In fact, she brought one and forgot the other.  That&#39;s the waitress.  Dirty dishes remained on our table, uncleared.
-The food was borderline &#34;just ok&#34; and almost &#34;not ok.&#34;  It arrived only semi-hot.  Nothing wowed us.  The chicken in the chicken and waffle sliders was a glorified chicken strip and it was pretty overcooked and hard.  The pork belly tacos had clearly been sitting a while, making the shell mushy.

Maybe we caught them on an off night, but we won&#39;t be going back to give them another chance."

Our waiter was at our table almost immediately. He was friendly and patiently explained the menu which consists of 500 beers. He was extremely knowledgeable and truly passionate about beers. We had probably 10 different beers. All of which were amazing. We made the mistake of looking at the menu. Everything looked so amazing that we had to order an app (Pretzel). The menu says it feeds four. I call BS. We couldn&#39;t finish it. Our waiter was so cool that he the was getting off so we cashed out, got a new waitress, and invited our previous waiter to sit and drink with us, which he did.

We were greeted promptly by our server Jeff. Jeff was awesome! He was very knowledgable of the beer menu and made great suggestions for beer.

We ordered the Barbarian Pretzel to start- this was perfect for our party as it is the size of a Mack truck steering wheel. It came with 2 dipping sauces, was served piping hot and very fresh.

I had the pork belly tacos-very good, my wife had the vegetarian sandwich and she like it ( she is a tough customer) others in our party had pizza, hot dog and brat- everybody was happy with their food. 

This place is awesome for beer lovers- over 500 available, but if you want an ice tea, you are shit out of luck.

I was wondering why it wasn&#39;t more crowded on Father&#39;s Day. The place was fairly noisy for not being full. I think the acoustics and the music contribute to that. Also, the menu is limited to sandwiches and pizza. But as I mentioned, the food is VERY good.

Again, Jeff was a great waiter, he didn&#39;t smother us, but really took care of us. I don&#39;t know this guy, but the next time i go there, I am asking for him as our server."

The beer selection is amazing, no doubt about it.  But they&#39;re often out of things and servers don&#39;t make an alternative suggestion when they are.  The menu is interesting because it&#39;s not typical bar food, but it&#39;s also not super-high quality.  In a mall that has Bar Louie (cheaper) and Gordon Biersch (much better food and very similar prices) I think they need to up their food game a bit.

It&#39;s both too bad that it&#39;s in Bolingbrook and really good that it&#39;s there, too - because it&#39;s like having a little oasis in the middle of suburbia; it&#39;s a nice little escape from hanging out with the family, but it would probably thrive in a more urban location.

There was only one thing I really wanted that was on the menu but they&#39;d run out of, and I think it was Victory at Sea by Ballast Point. Just the fact that they had so many great California craft brews on tap tells you just how serious these guys are about great, real beer.

I was only slightly disappointed in the service. It took quite a while to get someone to take out drinks when we joined our cousin for his birthday. After that, it all went smoothly. The fries were good, the waiter let us split the bill in whichever ways, and was very attentive thereafter. He also knew quite a lot about the selection and offered tasters first instead of pushing a full pint when trying brews.

I&#39;ll definitely be back. This is a place for drinking beer, not necessarily being picky about food."

We did have a little down moment on our last visit which is why I give 4 stars, we were sat and weren&#39;t spoken to again for almost 15 minutes. We watched other people get sat after us, get a server, and get their drinks before we met our server. 

Not cool but not the end of the world. It happens.

I would recommend Beer Market for group outings, dinners, or casual get-togethers. 

It&#39;s nothing fancy, which I mean as a good thing, because they concentrate on the food and the beer and not a bunch of bells and whistles in decor or TVs. Best of all you can really try A LOT of different beers."

There is a small outside area however it was still a little chilly out so everyone was inside.   It is on the small side to be sure to arrive earlier than the time you think you&#39;d like to arrive at, at least on a Saturday night.    I&#39;ve been here a couple times and even though it is a place known for its beer...hence beer market, the food is really good!   I&#39;ve only had a pizza and the garlic fries but anytime I am there everyone elses dish leaves them pretty satisfied.

Onto the beer.    HUUUUUUUGE menu.   They are ever so kind as to bring you a little taster (or small shot) of any beer so that you&#39;re totally happy with what you order.   The girls in my group pretty much were ordering the blueberry beer on tap all night until...the tap unfortunately ran dry on that one.   As we were getting ready to leave we took a stroll to the fridge area to ask the bartender if they had any of that blueberry beer in bottles we could take home.   There was one that was similar but at $11 per bottle I&#39;ll just go home and drink some summer shandy :)

I love that this place is so close to home and I look forward to more get togethers here."

Service was great -- our waiter attended to us right away and checked up on us throughout the evening.  

The beer selection was overwheming. Just about every imaginable beer was available and a huge selection available on tap as well.  

The food was ... interesting.  They didn&#39;t just have a plain burger or cheeseburger with fries.  It was more unique offerings, which isn&#39;t bad, but given the area, I would have had some more food offerings.  

Overall, it&#39;s not a bad place to watch a sporting event.  I&#39;m not so sure it&#39;s very kid friendly, so unlikely I&#39;d return with the family, but not a bad place overall."

We went for lunch on a Monday at 12:30 and placed our order. We noticed several other people coming and going that arrived after us. I asked to speak with the manager after waiting 45 min and seeing others get their food and leave , we were told that he was in his office and would be out to talk to us and our food would be out shortly. It took another 15 min a total of one hour for two orders of Tacos and one sandwich! The manager never bothered to come talk to us, very poor customer service. With all the great restaurants at the Promenade I will definitely not be returning or recommending this establishment to my friends or clients.Obviously they really don&#39;t care about your experience there."

1st, they&#39;ve been rated the best Reuben sandwich in Naperville for 4 years.  This was my first try, but it is a really good Reuben.  Highly recommend trying it.Also had the pastrami sandwich, which was also really good.  Both sandwiches were really big. 

The deli meat is mostly Boar&#39;s Head brand, which I believe is better quality and more tasty.  Because it&#39;s a deli, you can also order sliced meats by the pound and bring home.

The sandwiches come with homemade chips, so basically potato chips but they are warm and fresh.  Those are so good.  You can pay an additional fee to get the curly fries, also very good.

If you&#39;re familiar with the area, you know there isn&#39;t a lot around.  If you need some general items, this can also serve as your local convenient store.  Plenty of items you might need.  

They have a large fridge cooler with many soda options, and also have a decent beer and wine selection.  So if you live close and need some alcohol, just stop in here.

Lastly, Elli no longer owns Elli&#39;s deli.  Sad, but a lovely couple bought the deli and kept Elli&#39;s name on.  Very sweet couple.  The lady runs the register and the gentlemen prepares the food."

It all starts with good, old fashioned, customer service. Build a business with a good moral backbone, and you&#39;ll see the business grow. 

We went on a Saturday evening and were very happy with our trip. I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect, it&#39;s a deli and small convenient/liquor store (?), that was slightly confising, but they have seating. We had cheese curds, fried cauliflower, jalapeño poppers (thanks again!), Reubens and chicken tenders. 

Let me say, it takes a little bit for the food, small shop and all, bit it is WORTH the wait. 

We were extremely happy with the Reubens. I can&#39;t argue they they&#39;ve had best running in Naperville for 4 years running, as their signs stated, because it was absolutely delicious. The curly fries that came with it were hot and crispy with food flavor and the dip that comes with the cauliflower and curds (a thousand island dressing of sorts) was awesome. 

I absolutely recommend Ellie&#39;s Deli, and we were so glad to meet everyone there!

Oh! And thank you for the free cookie! That was a delightful surprise! Hope to visit again soon!"

Take a look at their photo book that Margo keeps behind the counter, It will blow your mind on what they can produce!!!

I have been in a couple of times and ordered the Brazilian steak sandwich with chips/fries.  Solid!  Tasty!  Homemade!

The decor is a bir sparse but I imagine that it&#39;s because this is a truly family-owned business.  They offer a wall full of bottled drinks, and salads and sides that fill their meatcase, plus there are other odds and ends as well.

Check them out when you are in the neighborhood and help support the local community.  You can&#39;t go wrong here!"

WOW, to say Ellie&#39;s has an identity crisis would be an under statement.  Is it a candy store?  A grocery store?  A wine shop?  I think they are trying to try everything to see where they can make money.  The deli is almost an afterthought.

We had the chicken and rice soup, an &#34;Italian&#34; and a Brazilian steak sandwich.  We got chips with both sandwiches.  The soup was all rice with a few small pieces of chicken thrown in.  My wife really liked her Italian thus the three star rating.  The Brazilian was nothing special.  I wouldn&#39;t order it again.  The chips were hard and greasy and lacked any seasoning.  They may have been old.

I had a chance to look around while we were eating.  That&#39;s when I noticed the grocery rack.  If you need Ajax or Pledge, Elli&#39;s has it.  If you are out of flour or sugar or ketchup, Elli&#39;s has you covered.  They also have a wine section past the counter.  What&#39;s that all about?  They also have a large selection of soft drinks.  I think they might have more soft drinks than menu items.

Note to Elli&#39;s owners:  Decide what you want to be.  Right now it&#39;s not clear if you want to be a candy store, a grocery store, a wine shop, a soft drink distributor or a deli.  For us you are failing at all these."

They can also provide any soda or drink you could ever think to wash down your delicious sandwich. I had half of a reuben, and half of a Brazilian steak. Both were made fresh, and to perfection.

I had just finished up a chiropractor appointment right by this place and I was STARVING! We found this deli that was right next door. We walk in and get a great friendly welcome from the owner Bob. 

They have a great menu selection and all their meats are gluten free. I got the Brazilian steak sandwich with curly fries and my dad got the Venetian sandwich with chips. Both the fries and chips are handmade and fresh from the fryer. They also have freshly made cookies (chocolate chip and sugar) for 2 for $1. The owner was so nice he gave us the cookies for free. He also took the time to hand carve the meat (Boar&#39;s Head Brand!!! Best quality mean I&#39;ve had) and assemble the sandwiches instead of sloppily throwing them together (like most fast food restaurants cough cough). The flavor of the sandwiches are great!!! Well seasoned fries, and yummy cookies! The chips were the best my dad ever had. He also gave us this wonderful Brazilian sauce that went amazing with the sandwich (might&#39;ve been chimchurri sauce but I can&#39;t remember the name exactly).  And he gave us another side of free chips!

The deli also has store items. They have a section of all kinds of wines and drink mixes and a huge selection of nonalcoholic drinks (including unique ones like almond cola and my favorite brands sprecher and green river). They also had an ice cream fridge, snack shelves, and a shelf with different cereals and even paper products haha. Definitely unique. They also sold meat, cheeses, and breads.

I would highly recommend and will be going back again soon.

Fresh purple cabbage, red onion, the tiniest bit of mayonnaise just to keep it all together and some other spices I couldn&#39;t quite place. Just fresh, simple, delicious food.

Don&#39;t go here unless you know they have the exact item you&#39;re looking for. I had the Philly cheesesteak which was really tasty.

Food was delicious but not sure i would stop in again except for take out. Lunch for two was $20 - i could get the same lunch at jasons deli in 1/5 the time and a few bucks less....too bad seeing as i always try to support mom and pop stores in town over corporate places...

I stopped in after a raving review from a client at work. I grabbed myself a pmb sandwhich and a small side of chicken salad and pasta salad for later. 

My sandwhich was nothing short of heavenly. 

A simple concoction of ingredients...thinly slices proscuttio, basil, mozzerella, olive oil and a tomato at the suggestion of the owner. Even now my mouth is watering reliving the briny yet smooth, fresh and buttery taste of this sandwhich. 

I ate the chicken salad the next day at work with crackers. And shared the pasta salad that night with my boyfriend. The chicken salad has legit chunks of chicken in it--none of that cop out shredded in a can kind. It was left me feeling blissful and spoiled by its generosity.  The pasta salad held well for a whole day, I typically find myself less than impressed by pasta salads from restaurants because they are too tangy and leave an odd film in your mouth. This one was more than I could have dreamed it to be.  This shop is small and quaint filled with essential grocery needs and quite the selection of sandwhich supplies. It reminds me of a deli in nyc which made me smile."

We had a group of 6 and the adults all got the signature chicken salad in one form or another (wrap, marble rye, French bread). The hummus and Deviled Eggs were also excellent.

Bottom line is, Naperville needs good mom and pops Delis like this.  It is a huge step up from Subway.  Support this place because the food is good and the owners are kind.

I ordered deli sandwich meat and chicken salad sandwich. Let me explain my horrible experience.

When I asked for salami, turkey, and cheddar cheese to the cook, he kept trying to sell me more items that I did not want. The woman at the register was even trying too! Try our reuben, try a steak, I did not want to. But then I said why not, I will try a chicken salad sandwich to go.

Twenty one minutes later! Just some children were in the store and me. And it took 21 minutes! I asked the cook what the delay was and he said I did not have a box with my name on it . I did not know I had to write my name on a box?

Immediately I left and when I got home there was a small black and gray hair in the chicken salad sandwich andddddddd my deli meat was bad."

I really wish my boyfriend still lived over here so I had an excuse to go to Ellie&#39;s Deli. First off, I love this place because my name is Ellie and, well, that&#39;s self explanatory. Secondly, this place has awesome, affordable  sandwiches.

I&#39;m a sandwich freak and am very picky. The Venetian sandwich at Ellie&#39;s Deli is drool-worthy. They use Boar&#39;s Head meat and cheese, which automatically pushes them to the top of my list. They bake their bread in-house and the Venetian sandwich comes on a French roll that is so soft, delicate and perfect. Their spreads are creative and give the sandwich great flavor, ex. pesto mayo, roasted red pepper, etc. They have a variety of sandwiches to order and I&#39;ve seen multiple people get their Reuben. 

I recommend calling in your order beforehand and their website is very easy to navigate. Their deli and catering menus are online. 

This place offers more than just sandwiches. It&#39;s a cute little international deli/store, focusing on Polish and Brazilian specialties. I lived in Germany with my boyfriend a couple years ago, and it&#39;s so nice finding special treats at Ellie&#39;s Deli that I used to eat in Germany like chocolates, chips and drinks."

It&#39;s a grocery store, and sells alcohol, which is never a bad thing.
I has sandwiches which are basically rehashing the Boar&#39;s Head meats and cheeses which you can buy yourself on fancy bread.  But the spreads they use, the roasted tomatoes, and the bread is delicious, on top of having delicious meats and cheeses.  And they are cheap too, two sandwiches and a drink is about 11 dollars.

Ellie&#39;s deli is a little Polish deli shop off of Plainfield/Naperville Road and 104th that is the cutest thing since sliced bread. My boyfriend took me here because he found some pretty good stuff about the place on the web, so we decided to check it out.

The place is a like a deli-convenience store love child: it features the sandwich counter and a few foodstuffs for sell. They stock both polish and american items and even have a decent wine selection if you&#39;re trying to keep everything in budget. 

My boyfriend got the Venetian sandwich, which was pretty darn good when I snagged a taste. I went for the Brazilian: italian bread, thinly sliced ham, lettuce, red bell peppers, and pesto sauce. YUM! One of the best deli sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure of consuming.

The women working the store were very nice: attentive without being in your face and they really know how to make a sandwich! The gals even gave us a clip-card thingy: eat a certain number of sandwiches, get one free! Excellent.

And for two people and a drink, the entire meal came in at around $12. The sandwiches were so much better than your typical Quizno-Subway sandwich shops and the fact that they are much cheaper makes me a very happy Evelyn. I&#39;ll basically be stalking Ellie&#39;s Deli from now on."

Food is great when you get it, but they need to tighten up there whole process for taking orders, preparing and delivering it the customers.  This was a convenience store/deli, looks like they are moving towards full scale sandwich shop/deli.  

I agree with another reviewer...good place to stop by for Boar&#39;s Head deli meats and some good sandwiches if you are not in a rush.  Also, did NOT like the fact that one of the owners (or workers, not sure which) went out front for a cigarette and then just tossed the smoking butt on the ground.
