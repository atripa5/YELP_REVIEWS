Staff was very friendly. We started with their chips, salsa and guacamole. The guacamole was great. My daughter ordered the kids&#39; menu macaroni and cheese- totally homemade and delicious. 
I had the grilled veggie wrap, little too much sour cream, but it was yummy. 
Husband had the BBQ beef and garlic parm fries/ he was pleased with both. 
My boys had burgers from the kids&#39; menu- cooked perfectly, and the cod sandwich which was huge!
All in all we were so pleased with this place and we look forward to being back in the area for football so we can try them again!"

This place is awesome! We ordered the buffalo chicken dip, which was soooo good. I ordered the BBQ Bacon burger w sweet potato fries, best sweet potato fries I&#39;ve tried ever, and had to try their homemade chili which was super delicious! I didn&#39;t get to try the burger because I had gotten so full, but it looked really good!

Let me just mention how wonderful Zuzu was with us. As soon as we walked in she was so nice. She made us feel like a couple of friends visiting a friend at work. She asked for our names and used them, which is unlikely when you go to a restaurant. Loved her bubbly personality. Overall, she is the icing on the cake to this restaurant for sure! 

If you are ever if the area, go check this place out.  Living out in Indiana, I would definitely drive the hour to have dinner at this place again and to see Zuzu!"

I was trying to find a place to eat and my husband said &#34;let&#39;s go to the adorable place we passed on the way in.&#34;  I had no idea what he was talking about, but in my low blood sugar haze, I just let him pick and we ended up at Bryan&#39;s.  This place was GREAT.  I have to say that I was completely jealous of my husband&#39;s fried fish and fried shimp platter, which was the star of the show.  I had a chicken sandwich, which was good, but not as good as fried things late at night.  The server was super nice.  She was doing a great job taking care of all of the people there, and there were a surprising number.  Seems like a great local establishment.  If we lived closer, we&#39;d be there all the time."

Its a smaller place but very cute and cozy inside . We ordered cheese curds, buffalo cheese curds, and spinach dip. The only thing I could say is that we ordered waters and we were one of three customers in there and it took a bit . But other then that , our waitress was very nice , she answered questions about the menu and was very pleasant . The prices were god for the portions you get. The buffalo cheese curds were my favorite, dipped in blue cheese! Plus Ive never seen them anywhere else so it was new to my sister and I. I would definitely go back for another round of those"

Five stars?  FIVE??  My guess is that this is a local favorite with loyal fans who are pumping the ratings.  BUT...

For a local place it&#39;s great.  Someone called the atmosphere cozy and I would agree.  The mood in the place was comfortable with everyone, especially at the bar, seeming very open and friendly.  There was karaoke last night and it was good karaoke.  By that I mean that it was just ordinary people having fun.  I&#39;ve been to a lot of karaoke nights that are more like shows of semi-professionals.  Your ordinary shower singer would feel intimidated even with their Beer of Courage under their belt.  That said...

I didn&#39;t go here to be &#34;where everybody knows your name.....&#34;  I was a stranger and went for really good food, as indicated by the ratings.

We were told that the fish and the burgers were the best.  I had the fish and it was most definitely not the best.  The breading was heavy and doughy and tasted a bit stale.  The fish - two pieces - was nothing to get excited about.  I substituted onion rings for the fries for a dollar more and was unimpressed.  Three thick rings that were just eh.  The cole slaw also was just okay.  The burgers looked fine and were said to be good when asked but there was none of that exclaiming that goes on when you&#39;re eating a really great burger.

They seem to have a really good selection of beers.  Service was friendly but patchy.  Might be that they were short someone because on a Friday night I doubt they&#39;d schedule only one server.  

Only real negative was that they have a patio out front that people use for smoking.  They may as well have smoking in the restaurant for as much as the smokers passing through pollute the air inside.  Blech.

So in short....if this were my neighborhood place I&#39;d probably be giving it five stars all day long because there was something about it that does inspire affection but it&#39;s not nearby so I have to look at it as in would I get in my car to go here?  Would I want anyone else who was searching for food to think this was the best choice?  The answer there is:  Doubtful.  It&#39;s okay but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way."

Our server was friendly and, I was told, the place has really been cleaned up with the new owner.  Plenty of TVs around the bar area, but we had to ask for the Clemson vs Notre Dame game to be turned on.  It took a while before someone, apparently, found the correct remote to accomplish the task, not that the game was worth watching.  Free popcorn, but there was none available when we were there.

We will probably return to try a meal here."

I&#39;ve eaten at Bryan&#39;s several times now and I am completely in love with the fried chicken! I met the chef and owner&#39;s wife and here&#39;s what she shared that all servers should tell everyone on their first visit: it&#39;s fresh, never frozen and hand-breaded at the time of order. It came out crunchy, well seasoned and moist...I absolutely crave it. I also had their perfectly cooked broccoli and a side salad. As seasonally appropriate, they buy their vegetables fresh from local farmer&#39;s markets and have a rockin&#39; homemade balsamic dressing. 

On the con side, the atmosphere doesn&#39;t fit the level of food. I would call it local-diner-meets-sports-bar. There are ample TVs, chotchkie sayings on the walls and a plastic picture menu, reminiscent of Denny&#39;s. There&#39;s outdoor seating that faces the automotive shop next door and Ogden. And traffic on Odgen can make it quite difficult to turn in and out of their parking lot. However, the kitchen and bathrooms sparkled. The place is well maintained and really clean - just not super inviting...

Considering their food alone, however, Bryan&#39;s has a tremendous amount to brag about. I think they need to do a better job of this. Here&#39;s where my decades working in branding are going to get annoying, but even their website doesn&#39;t give you a feel for their high-quality ingredients and preparation. Instead of telling us about the chef&#39;s food chops and their passion for quality, they published a vision and mission statement that focuses on a clean and safe environment...sports, TVs... fun and camaraderie. I guess that&#39;s what they&#39;ve hung their hats on but I don&#39;t feel that&#39;s what makes Bryan&#39;s special. It&#39;s the food.

So all said, I will return to eat at Bryan&#39;s over and over... but I likely will eat and run and not linger."

I live in the area and had been to this place many times before new ownership. I always had found it fine but unremarkable. That&#39;s changed. The burgers we had were awesome. I&#39;m not saying to make this a destination, but if you are in the area it&#39;s well worth the stop. Both burgers were cooked perfectly. I loved my olive burger and my daughter seemed to agree since she basically licked her plate clean. 

My only negatives are that it is a bar first. I knew with the Holiday and a lot of people not working tomorrow it might be a little rough with hard drinking and language and to a degree it was. The staff was very friendly, but there were only 2 of them so it was slow at times as they were also tending bar. I love craft beer and they had a very average selection. The one I ordered I really enjoyed but the Brewer wasn&#39;t listed. I asked the waitress and she didn&#39;t know. They served it in the breweries own glass and by the logo I was able to find it. Improve in that area and I&#39;ll be back for more than food.

Overall, good food. Friendly atmosphere. I&#39;d just be careful, like any bar, you show up at a appropriate time."

Because we were there for 1/2 price apps, we ordered the sampler and a calamari. The food was very tasty - homemade onion rings were huge. The chicken tenders were juicy. The mixed drinks were great too.

We were promptly seated by the hostess where we asked (always a plus!) Our server brought us an extensive craft beer menu as well as complimentary popcorn. 

We ordered the wings on recommendation and were not disappointed! I don&#39;t know what they do to them but they easily blow all the chains away. The potato skins rocked also. 

After trivia ended the bar became a little more crowded but you could still hear the audio of the hockey game that was on. I love bars that don&#39;t play music during a big game. 

There&#39;s a stage for karaoke that they do on Friday nights and plenty of flat-screen TV&#39;s with all the games on instead of just one game on like some places. 

The owner (Bryan) came out and met us. Very nice guy. Made us feel very welcome just like everyone else in there. It&#39;s a nice, cozy establishment where everyone is there just to relax and have a good time.

Nice family atmosphere before 8. Great fun with karaoke on Friday nights. Live bands on Saturday nights (meh). Sports on Sunday&#39;s. All among a great group of regulars and did I mention there is booze?!  All with free parking, casual dress, incredibly friendly staff, and plenty of seating. 

I love this place."

We were not too happy with the way the oil and garlic&#34; pasta was prepared- so flavorless. So we asked to have them fix it. They added more spice, a little spinach and it was much better.

They were very nice about the fact the dish was lacking.  

The wine selection was good but by the glass a bit $$, but I guess its Hinsdale? and that&#39;s what you get.

The decor was pretty and the mirrors on walls really added a cool look to the room."

We rarely frequent downtown Hinsdale and really didn&#39;t have many expectations for this restaurant and needless to say we had a great experience. 

My dad and I sat at the bar and enjoyed our dinner there. The atmosphere and ambiance were great and something we really enjoyed.  We each ordered a glass of wine and our dinner came out very shortly after ordering. I ordered the Carbonara, I have eaten better before but this was very good nonetheless. My dad ordered a rigatoni dish which he really liked. The portions are not huge and what you should eat. Bread was never brought before the meal and we had to ask for it to be brought out, which wasn&#39;t until after we received our dinners. Not a big deal, just not the best service. The chocolate cake and ice cream almond dessert was very small and underwhelming, as well. Typically my family shares desserts because they are so big but this was not the case. 

Now that I know what to expect, I will most likely return to the restaurant. The dishes were very good and I enjoyed eating at the bar."

I walked in and sat at the bar, which is not crowded on weeknights.  Garrett, Chris and Henry all are very attentive and take good care of you.  The dining room is fairly standard for Italian restaurants but what I think sets it apart is the upstairs.  It&#39;s got a lot of personality and makes the spot look not cookie-cutter.  The bar area is quite elevated and cozy.  All of the staff thus far have been great both with attentiveness and recommendations.  Also the bread they bring is very good.  It&#39;s been hot every time and they bring cheese and Parmesan, just how I like it.  For those of you like me that need some guidelines when it comes to suburb portions, I will say the apps are probably in line with what you would expect, maybe a 6 out of 10 on the largeness scale.  The entrees weren&#39;t super huge but definitely larger than a city portion.  If you get a pasta dish, you will likely take half of it home but it&#39;s at least not some of the places I&#39;ve been where it&#39;s a family style that should serve a table of six.

The fried calamari to me was just average.  I like that they bring you a marinara and aioli but it was nothing special.  However the burrata is outstanding.  Literally might have been the best burrata I&#39;ve ever had and I eat it alot (including making various dishes at home).  They serve it with roasted cherry tomatoes and a basil sauce (they might want to add just a tad more of this) but the flavor and freshness was really amazing.  The carpaccio was very good, but I felt like it needed a little fat to bring it together.  Perhaps just a drizzle of olive oil.  Overall though, I&#39;ll definitely get it again.  I also tried a special pasta they had which was squid ink and lobster tail.  I should note that not all of their pastas are made in house.  I, personally, as someone who makes my own pasta very regularly, find it hard to compare dried pasta to fresh.  It&#39;s not flavor but texture that really stands out with fresh to me.  The pasta was legit.  I thought it was perfectly cooked and it had a few fresh veggies in there but really wanted the pasta to shine.  The lobster was grilled and a tad overcooked but not rubbery.  It was also served in the shell, which makes for a dramatic presentation but not always the easiest to eat.  My husband got the chicken parm.  He is a chicken parm connoisseur.  I only say that because he is typically highly critical of the dish.  He said this was one of the best he&#39;s ever had and the best in years.  The chicken was still moist but the outside crispy (not the bit I had but he assured me the majority was).  The sauce was the standout to me.  Typically I feel like restaurants focus on the chicken and the sauce literally just tastes like bland tomatoes but this had a ton of flavor both in the chicken as well as the sauce.  This is becoming one of my go-tos!"

I&#39;d heard mix reviews before the evening started but decided to go anyway to support a charity that was hosting an event there.   I was part of a large party that had a reservation made for 20 people which also included 3 young children.  The children behaved perfectly despite the obscene wait. While I can appreciate that it can take a long time to prepare and serve a large party I feel that waiting almost 2 hours is unprofessional.  When we placed our order we even asked the server what would be the fastest meal and after he recommended a pasta we all ordered pasta thinking it would come quickly.  It didn&#39;t. After waiting we immediately asked for our meal to be packed up because it would not have been fair to our children to make them continue to sit there asking them to continue to behave so that they could eat in the dinning room.  We eventually ate the pasta at home and it was okay but nothing special.   

 In this case I place fault not on the server but on the kitchen and the manager.   The person I assume to be the manager stood near the bar the entire wait staring at the dinning room and never once noticed that our large table with kids was the last to get served and that we waited forever. 

I would however like to say that while the server did not help rush our order they were polite throughout the evening.  I also feel the bartenders were very polite.   Again though while sitting at the bar while we waited for the rest of our party, the person I suspect to be the manager appeared rude with the way I saw him interact with the staff.  

I will not return."

Originally was looking to come here with a group for lunch on Sunday, but they are not open for lunch on the weekends.

A group of us was gathered near the front at a couple high boys for some pre-gaming appetizers and drinks. The appetizers were really good, but then again I rarely meet a bruschetta that I do not like. 

The dinner was also okay. Not a ton of menu choices but enough. My food was not to my taste, not very flavorful. My husbands food was also bland. Others at the table seemed happy, so maybe it was just us. Our server was nice and efficient.

Here&#39;s where things get strange. During desserts and coffee, someone starts yelling &#34;last call&#34;. Mind you, this is restaurant, not so much a bar. There are a few tables filled, probably 30 people in the place, so fairly populated. Shortly after, the heat is off. Completely. No heat, no oven. It gets freezing in there fast. I did not think we were there past close, rather, that someone needed to get out at close, which mean everyone had to be out the door. It was strange to say the least. Our bill for 10 was over $1,000, we weren&#39;t loud, and we weren&#39;t the only ones there, so I&#39;m not sure what was happening, but for just okay food I am in no hurry to get back.

We had reservations for 30 minutes after the restaurant opened and we were seated immediately.  The place was decently crowded, a lot of people there for brunch.  We started by ordering a round of bloodies. I asked for a grey goose Bloody Mary, but then told me they pre mix their bloody Mary&#39;s.  Which I can handle, except for the fact that they couldn&#39;t tell me what kind of vodka they used (they think it&#39;s absolut).  My mother and sister (mother of two) were the reason we were out for brunch.  My sister was 6 months pregnant at the time so we ordered a virgin Bloody Mary for her. The waiter said all the drinks were coming from the kitchen where they were pre mixed so there was no virgin ones.  Fine. I&#39;ll go to the bar and get one.  The bartender just so happened to be pouring a Bloody Mary out of a premixed bottle and then adding vodka to it.  A virgin Bloody Mary shouldn&#39;t be a problem. He told me he couldn&#39;t do it. Then someone (who I assume was the manager) told me they had no more mix left because a group of older women were there drinking earlier and they consumed all the mix that wasn&#39;t already premixed....keep in mind this place has only been open for thirty minutes at this point....I don&#39;t like being lied to, especially when I give you my business.

We were starving and over ordered.  We started with grilled and fried Calamari, Meatballs, and a Flat Bread Pizza.  For our main course my husband got the Hangar Steak, my mother in Law got Grilled Salmon and I had the house salad with Grilled Steak.  For desert we had Nutella Gelato, Tiramisu and a cranberry apple tart.  What a meal!!!!  Everything was amazing, and enjoyable.  As we over ordered, the extras made delicious lunch the next day as well.  The staff was attentive and made our dining experience a special evening although it was just a regular Sunday night out.

The dining room and bar areas are classy and modern. Looking up to the ceiling, you will find unique light fixtures that resemble giant lamp shades. The service is friendly, prompt, and pleasant. After my first visit, I walked away quite impressed, having ordered the arancini and margherita pizza. Arancini is basically a ball of risotto, fried. It had a nice, crunchy texture to the outside; rich and creamy on the inside. 

At my second visit, I also ordered the arancini as an appetizer but tried the pepperoni pizza for my entree. The pepperoni pizza was extremely greasy, and I absolutely would not recommend ordering it. Also, for reference, the pizza is more than one person can handle. 

Overall, cocktails are good but not out of this world. 

This may be a nice place to check out if you are in the area but I wouldn&#39;t make a special trip for it."

I&#39;ve been twice on Thursdays (last was 1-15-15) when they have live music and it ruins the whole experience.  The singers are good, and in the right venue listening to them would be nice. The restaurant is small and the acoustics so loud that we had to literally yell to our table mates.  Yelling to each other becomes exhausting and doesn&#39;t lend itself to good conversation.
I will avoid Thursdays and enjoy dinner there on other nights."
il-poggiolo-hinsdale,Carol K.,ZYZNcugF3xUEGyLOVGiZ0Q,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,1235,405,P3iv2oelCY71NCJ5HrMRzA,4.0,2009-07-06,"Jerry Kleiner who owns some of my favorite spots in Chicago (Carivale, Gioco, Marche, etc) has done it again with his latest venture- this time out in the &#34;Burbs&#34;. Yay! And it&#39;s actually in my town of Hinsdale. 

Il Poggiolo (the balcony in Italian) opened about 8 days ago in what used to be a silent theater in Hinsdale back at the turn of the century. Characteristic Kleiner touches are evident- the huge oversized red chandeliers, the metal and leather chairs, the bar reminiscent of Room 21 and Park 52, the eclectic decor of Marche. And scattered around the walls are pictures of Kleiner&#39;s various trips around the world (or so says the manager). 

Hinsdaleans are obviously in need of a good restaurant as this place was packed on a Monday night. We got there around 5:30 to enjoy a drink at the bar before our 6pm reservation. We chatted with the bartender, perused the specialty cocktail list and basically checked the place out. 

We were seated right on time and as per our usual- ordered a variety of things to split and taste being that it was a new place. 

For our appetizers- we went with the carpaccio and the meat antipasti plate. Both were good but the meat antipasti was the clear winner with three kinds of meat, figs, grapes and 3 kinds of cheese. 

Finally on to the entrees. We had the sea bass (served with skin and our least favorite as it was dry) the lamb chop special (delicious, tender, done perfectly) and the pasta with bolognese sauce (absolutely delicious!) We also ordered the risotto special of the day which came with figs and Gorgonzola cheese. It was just okay. 

The chef, Jim Kilberg, who recently was the chef at the now closed Via Ventuno creates some wonderful dishes. I was a fan of his there and now that he is just a couple a blocks away makes me a happy camper. 

The biggest issue Il Poggiolo has right now is service. They are still finding their way. The wrong appetizer came to our table the first time. There was a long delay in getting the right one (not sure if the server entered the wrong one or what). 

Three times people came to our table with food that was not intended for our table and had no idea where to take it. Flatware was removed and not replaced so we spent quite a lot of time just looking at the food on our table as we had nothing to eat it with. And finally- water and wine were cleared before we were ready to leave. All signs of a new place with some settling in time needed from it&#39;s staff. 

But for me, the shining moments of service in the evening came from a young man named Austin. I have no idea what role he plays at this place but twice he noticed something that was wrong and ran to rectify it long before we had to ask. Nicely done. And because of him- the other service glitches were remarked on and forgotten. 

Hinsdale needs a place like Il Poggiolo. Good food served in a classy ambiance right in the neighborhood. Give the service a couple of weeks to catch up and I think we&#39;ve got a winner. You can almost hear the old silent movie stars who once graced this place clapping their hands and saying &#34;Bravo&#34;!"

I enjoyed my meal, but watching the servers lavish attention on other diners while we were often neglected left a bad taste in my mouth. Regulars should always be treated as such but all customers deserve a certain level of service that we didn&#39;t find here.

Came with my parents and sister, as the parents had enjoyed this place before. The space is okay, maybe a bit pompous but what restaurants in the suburbs aren&#39;t?

Calamari was toothsome with a crispy batter and killer homemade tomato sauce. Endive salad well balanced with candied nuts and sharp cheese pairing well with the slightly bitter endive. All the pastas dishes were very good, a light touch of cream on the rigatoni and sausage, decent seafood with the spaghetti and great bolgonese.

Was slightly annoyed they had no idea how to make an Aperol spritz. And again, the service! I had to get up and flag down a manager to get some extra silverware after being soundly ignored several times.

Decent food but inconsistent service doesn&#39;t convince me to return."

Gorgeous interior, high ceilings, two floors of beautiful decorations. The large mirror in the main dining room diffuses the natural light streaming in perpendicularly from the window-lined front. Outside, classy cafe sidewalk seating. Inside, bistro casual with white tableclothes and butcher paper to protect it.

Their Insalata con Tutto, a Cobb salad with pancetta, was delicious and perfectly (lightly!!) dressed in an unobtrusive vinaigrette.
The hamburger with gorgonzola was tender and juicy, with sweet red onions that melted in my mouth.

I have never been into a place where everything runs so efficiently.  I met the manager Giani back in the summer, which I think was one of his first days and to see him now work the crowd and staff is great. He doesn&#39;t seem to run around crazy like the past hostess/manager.  Also if your looking for a recommendation ask him he has never let us down!

Dare I say it&#39;s better than my former love affair with La Scarola? I went with one of my best friends, Kristina B., to celebrate her birthday and new job. She has been raving about this place for awhile now and wanted to share the yummy experience with me. I am not complaining at all. I fell in love...hard.

The decor and ambiance was what I anticipated for a posh town like Hinsdale. However, for a Monday night it was unusually crowded. The bar was packed and every table was seated. Given that it is an old theater, and the acoustics weren&#39;t the best, it was a little loud. We asked to be seated upstairs-- in the balcony. Il Poggiolo actually means the balcony in italian.

We kicked off our celebration with her recommendation on libations...the strawberry balsamic martini. Holy WOW was that an unbelievable drink. The specials didnt drive us completely crazy and we both opted for a pasta entree and started off with the fried calimari. It was absolutely delicious- full of flavor and nice and crispy. The garlic aioli was a nice touch with the lemon to squeeze over the octopus. We practically licked the plate clean! Next, for our entrees I ordered the Tortelloni con Ricotta e Spinaci (another recommendation from Kristina). It was absolutely superb. Bursting with creamy flavor and rich butter and sage notes. I had a hard time not finishing it off! Kristina went outside her comfort zone and ordered the Gnocchi al Pomodoro. It was like little pillows of creamy heaven. Just enough garlic, and they melted in your mouth. You didnt even have to chew!

For the dessert, we ordered the Tortino Di Mele (apple tart with vanilla bean gelato and maple cream sauce). It was a comforting, warm and delicious sweet ending to our visit at Il Poggiolo. I definitely will be back!"

The food was good, best food yet that I&#39;m writing a review for.

 This place is the type of food I&#39;m willing to spend money for; it has quality over quantity and I&#39;m alright with that whereas most people rather have quantity over quality.

So about the experience: it was pretty packed for only a 70-80 seat restaurant, smaller than a lot of restaurants out there. Open kitchen, small bar,  about 20 - 25 menu items. It seems like it was a season menu as in menu can change due to what is available on the market which is always a plus. Semi-open Kitchen, small bar about 10-15 seats at most. limited wine and beer list. 

I ordered the carpaccio, roasted purreed fava been soup, and &#39;carmella&#39; - butternut squash and riccotta wrapped &#39;noodle&#39; (actually pasta - like a hand rolled ravioli). 

The carpaccio was actually really good. it was thinly sliced sirloin with arugula, truffle mayo and olive oil. I normally not a fan of arugula because of the strong pepper note that is has but the olive oil and mayo really mellow of that flavor; over all a very simplistic dish.

The fava bean soup was pretty simple in it self; one note in terms of flavor, seasoned well. wasn&#39;t broke or grainy like most other restaurants would probably be. During the time I was eating it I was thinking maybe another herbal flavor like thyme would really work well with this soup; other than that it was fine.

My main entree the squash and ricotta ravioli was very sweet in terms of flavor, nice butternut squash flavor. Almost felt like a dessert and entree at the same time. The only problem with the food was that the ends where they sealed the filling were under cooked or raw. because that portion of the ravioli was twice as thick or thicker than where the filling was. It gave the overall plate nice texture eating &#39;al dente&#39; undercooked pasta. Also wish the sauce was slightly thicker or had more of a sage and brown butter sauce. It tasted more like a chicken stock thickened with butter, and the sage was more of a garnish; having to actually eat the sage leaves to get the sage flavor - which wasn&#39;t really infused into the sauce.

Last note the dessert:
I had a taste at two actually. First the Fig tart. had like a licorice caramel on the place, with a vanilla gelato. The problem with this dessert was that the crust of the tart was super thick. Like 50:50 ratio to the filling. It was like eating a pastry crust cookie with the fig filling. It wasn&#39;t a good ratio, but the flavor of the tart filling was nice.

The other dessert was the tiramisu. Wasn&#39;t a fan at all. Worst of all the cream had gelatin in it. It was like eating a poorly made mousse cake. You basically can put a brick on that tiramisu and it would have held. The flavor was bad, When I think tiramisu I think of a strong coffee flavor. This had like an off star anise flavor to it. couldn&#39;t eat more than 2 bites to it.

Over all the service was great; my server knew what she was doing. Understood the menu, and cared for her customers. The food was great; I think the restaurant should pay a little more attention to the desserts other than that the rest of the food was spot on.

Paid about 45 dollars including tip for 2 appetizers, entree, and technically 1 dessert."

The food: Everything was excellent.  Appetizer (layers of cheese, sauce, and eggplant) and salad (various beets with extra fresh goat cheese (NOT the hard feta cheese of less nice places)) were excellent, but what was really OFF THE CHARTS amazing was the fresh pasta dishes.  The Caramela (butternut squash-filled FRESH pasta) was truly excellent, if you like a sweeter pasta dish as I do.  The chicken filled FRESH pasta with truffle sauce was off the charts if you like creamy more than sweet.  We even loved the little touches and extras like the excellent bread, and the kind of olive oil that is a slightly earthy green color like the higher end restaurants have.

The drink: The wine was excellent as it usually is at nice places, but the true STAND OUT was the lemon cello.  It was icy cold and tasted like fresh lemonade, even containing tiny bits of lemon pulp.  I don&#39;t know if they made it themselves or just doctored it up, but I&#39;ve had a lot of chilled lemon cello out the the bottle before, but this was the best I&#39;ve ever had.

The service: We were treated very well. The main server (Heather) was excellent, even when compared to the class of servers at high end places.  She was very personable and knowledgeable, and was the main act in a very well-orchestrated service experience that included what I I believe were four other wait staff as well, all coming into and out of the picture at the right times.  The word &#34;prompt&#34; isn&#39;t the right word, because that implies that we were wanting of something for a short period of time, and then somebody showed up to &#34;promptly&#34; fill our want.  The word &#34;predictive&#34; is more accurate, because our main server and all the support staff were always there with the right thing before we knew we wanted it... it sounds too good to be true but this was our experience.  This restaurant&#39;s pool of highly capable service talent is deep as well.  It wasn&#39;t just a talented main server with some goofy, mindless extra helpers.  The people who supported our main server made intuitive, thoughtful decisions... they didn&#39;t just mindlessly drop off and pick up things.  Too many high end restaurants give you a good main server but mindless support staff.  This restaurant doesn&#39;t skimp on any part of the experience.

The ambiance: The ambiance was excellent. I highly recommend a table on the balcony, where you can look over the restaurant and bar.  You&#39;ll be way up high, and when you look around you will notice that the details of the three-dimensional space that you will overlook in that restaurant is a visual treat.

We had a superb experience at Il Poggiolo, and I hope that you do as well."

The food is very good authentic Italian (not Italian-American).  Great menu with a wide variety of proteins.  Good service and a very attractive room.  Price is very reasonable given the high quality of ingredients and expert preparation.  Kids eat free on Sunday.
 
My only criticisms are (1) the wines are marked up too much for my tastes and (2) it took a while for the apps to come out, probably because the place was packed on a Sat. night so the kitchen might have been in the weeds a little bit."

I love the decor, I love the bar area, I love the balcony... love love love it all!

I believe I&#39;ve had something different each time I&#39;ve been there - and ordered from the nightly specials a few times as well. To start, the foccacia they put on the table is outstanding. In the fall, they had a pumpkin soup which was amazing. I tried a pappardelle pasta with fresh mozzarella that was to die for. The skirt steak is great, with a delicious marinade/glaze - get it with polenta on the side, YUM! I adore the spinach and ricotta tortellini in the butter sage sauce - just a few of these and I&#39;m full! I&#39;ve had a few desserts here, all of which I&#39;ve enjoyed - but the one I enjoyed the most was the most simple - on Saturday, I had nutella gelato - borderline amazing.

The service here is great and we always get treated well - there&#39;s no rush to eat and vacate your table, they encourage you to take your time and enjoy yourself.

Given the  great options that exist, I find it amazing this place is still in business.  I&#39;ve been here four times, trying desperately to support a business in my community, but I simply cannot name one single thing that makes this place stand out.  

Service is just average.  The food is just average.  The owners apparently also own the sushi restaurant next door, which for me questions their passion for being a destination for a great Italian meal.  

Just &#34;average&#34; Italian food in a Chicago suburb should only get you as far as having an &#34;average&#34; hot dog.  Too many great options, this one falls too short."

The poseurs still hang out here, even though the place has been open for a year and a half or so.  Was hoping they might move on.  However, I have to say that I gave Poggiolo another try this week.  Service was flawless and I had the best butternut squash ravioli I have ever eaten.  And I&#39;ve eaten a lot of it.  This version was made with perfectly al dente homemade pasta, and was wading, not swimming, in a silky brown butter sauce.  

I am much more impressed with this place than I was when it first opened.  My first review is below.

Oh, the attitude!  Oh, the poseurs!  Oh, the crowd!  The noise!  Let&#39;s not even get to the overpriced food and drinks!  As P.T. Barnum said, &#34;There&#39;s a sucker born every minute.&#34;   Given the crowds at this place, there are a lot of suckers in Hinsdale apparently willing to part with a lot of money to be shoved into a small space, eat mediocre food and sip much-too-pricey wine.

It really is too bad Hinsdale does not have much in the way of restaurants that are reasonably priced, serve quality food, have a liquor license and are family-friendly.  It&#39;s not that much to ask.  Il Poggiolo certainly isn&#39;t one of them."

Back in the day this place was a go to place.   Cold pasta and a fish entree, with a bartender server that was apparently aware of the poor meal is a non-negotiable.

I think there &#39;s been a chef change since our last visit.  Anyhow, I am glad to report that the arancini remain excellent.  We had some salads that were uniformly not dressed enough but were otherwise tasty and fresh.  I had the arctic char which was nicely prepared but the accompanying pickled fennel was far too overpowering (sour) and the dish was quite unbalanced.  My wife had the gluten free pasta.  The quinoa-spaghetti was actually pretty tasty, nicely al dente, with a tasty creamy sun-dried tomato sauce on top.  Our daughter had the gnocchi with side of meatballs.  This was good.  For dessert, we shared the chocolate cake and the fig tart.  The fig tart was good, however, fresh figs would have been better than the dried ones.  The chocolate cake was just ok.  Service was friendly and attentive."

One bathroom for that huge place. Dumb. The &#34;other&#34; owner walking around like he&#39;s the god damn President...dumb. Building a restaurant that large in a town where nothing makes it and people are more focused on homes and appearance. Dumb. Being rude to one of those exceptions who spends a shitload on dining out.

Two friends and me headed to Il Poggiolo after seeing the positive yelp reviews hoping it was our new spots.  Unfortunately, it was not a place we will be returning to.  We were seated promptly when we arrived but our waitress did not arrive until 20 minutes after we were seated.  This place is upper class on the restaurant scale and I got the vibe from the waitress that because we were younger than most patrons, we were not to be taken seriously or would not tip well so we were not worth her time.  The specialty drinks we ordered were the best part of the restaurant.  They arrived quickly and were delicious so if I do go back, I&#39;ll be sitting at the bar.  I ordered the linguini with clams and it was average and needed a kick to it.  Others with me ordered the chicken parmesan and it was a bit better.  The patrons around us were all middle aged or older and seemed to be having a better time than us.  Overall, I was disappointed with the service more than the food."

The colors invite you in and embrace you, the photos, the lamps, the GINORMOUS mirror...everything screams, &#34;Hello!  Please come in and relax, enjoy some wine, enjoy the mouth watering cuisine, and have a wonderful time.&#34;

My experience continued to get better and better when I was seated and my server called me, &#34;Miss,&#34; (which, clearly, I am no longer).  Big score there!  He clearly was knowledgeable about the food and the wine selection that Il Poggiolo has to offer.  He was very attentive and always made it a point to check on us, ask if we had any questions or needed anything.  In most places, this can border on obnoxious, but here, it was quite delightful.

The food........OH MY!  Not quite sure what to say.  I have had the good fortune to have tried multiple dishes and have never once been disappointed.  The gnocchi with pomodoro sauce left me with a very happy tummy.  It was smooth and tangy, full of flavor and spunk, but didn&#39;t leave me feeling like I had been over-garlicked.  The portion was large enough to fill me up, but not so much that I felt intimidated or needed to take some home (though I&#39;m certain my family was disappointed at the lack of doggie bag...ooops, I ate it all!).  

I have also feasted on the sausage and pepper pizza, the osso buco with saffron risotto, and succumbed to the fig tart for dessert.  Not once have I been disappointed.  Everything - the atmosphere, the service, the food, the wine - ALL are amazing.  You will love it!

From the stunning decor (classic Kleiner) to the tasty dishes, to the knowledgeable wait staff and cute informative hostess, everything has always been spot on.  

I have never been steered wrong by the wait staff when it comes to ordering, I am in love with the Octopus Salad and their thin crust pizzas always hits the spot (they have a specialty pizza everyday!!!).  If you are in the mood for pasta their Gnocci is out of this world, they are like little pillows of heaven.  

If you are ever in for lunch the two brothers serving are always helpful and always ready with a joke.
  
No beers on tap but a good selection of bottles and more wine than you can shake a stick at.

I would recommend Il Poggiollo to anyone who wants the big city restaurant feel but doesn&#39;t want to leave the burbs.  Lunch, dinner, brunch, drinks, happy hour, sad hour, who cares go get your dine on."

It was noisy but I was able to hold a conversation at a table of four; plus who doesn&#39;t like overhearing some gossip at the table next to you. I ordered the fontina stuffed pork chop which was grilled to perfection and served on top of a bed of polenta. I have always hated polenta and this is not my definition of the stuff. I would call this cheese grits, but that of course does not sound as classy. The &#34;grits&#34; were money and they were gone in no time. My wife had the rock shrimp and saffron risotto and she liked it too. The wine list is extensive and not that over priced as described in previous posts.

+ Pork Chop w/ polenta
+In my favorite western suburb
+Easy to find parking
+ Olive oil

When we asked our waiter what the hold was, his answer was sorry they made a mistake on the order and had to do it over, finished a wonderful meal, customer service sucked!!  Good customer service would say, can I at least offer you a cup of coffee for inconvenience, take 10% off bill nothing, very bitter about how this was handled, we have been yo many 1st class restaurants, most over apologetic if an error in order, nada here!!

1st, they were having problems with the fryer?  So couldn&#39;t have the Arancini, which is a particular fave of mine.  I was disappointed, but hey, it happens.  
For dinner, I had the Gnocchi al Pomodoro which was very good, and my mom ordered the braised duck in wine sauce which was also very tasty.  But here comes the part of where I felt like I was duped a little.  I asked our waiter to recommend a wine, which he did, and it was very good. my mom and I had two glasses each.  The problem is when I received the bill, I discovered it was about $15 a GLASS.  Now, I realise I should have asked the cost, however, whenever its that much the waiter should make a point of it.  If I had a chance to think it over, and was in the mood to splurge, I wouldn&#39;t have had a problem with it, but I had a bit of sticker shock when I received that bill.  I live on the Northside of Chicago, and eat out a LOT, and have never experienced something like this.  Also asked some fellow foodies, and they all said our waiter should&#39;ve given us a heads up if its over $10 a glass.

The main level dining room is so noisy that you have to scream your name at the hostess and then at each other during dinner if you want to talk;  but woe to you if you opt to sit on the way-too-hot upper level, where the service is very slow.  Plus, you get to walk up a narrow, long (over 20 steps) staircase, which is used by the servers who, balancing huge trays of food, are scampering up and down.    (This is a workers comp case waiting to happen for them, and for the patrons, a huge inconvenience if you want to go to the first-floor-only, one-person only restrooms).

The drinks are adequate (not generous), much like the wine list, but the food was a huge disappointment.  Barely fried calamari (so white we thought it wasn&#39;t cooked) with two unappetizing sauces;  a first course pasta that was scarcely sauced;  a hangar steak that demanded more tenderizing;  and fish that was drowning in so much olive oil that we thought the restaurant was named after an olive grove.  The side that accompanied the fish might have been good, but it was too gritty because the kitchen didn&#39;t rinse the sand out of the spinach before combining it with tomatoes, garlic, and barley (yes, barley).  As for our server, we had to ask for bread, but he neglected to give us oil or butter and we had a very long wait for our second glasses of wine.  

BTW, it&#39;s not cheap--just trying too hard to be pretentious."

My wife and I went last Saturday night,we should have read some reviews prior to going. Anyway, we had reservations but decided to go early to check it out. We arrived about 20 minutes early and when we walked in we had to go through a maze of curtains before actually getting into the resto!! That being said we stood in the doorway for a few minutes before anyone even realized we were there so we just walked over to the bar. My wife ordered the strawberry balsamic martini and it was good, I had a grey goose with bleu cheese olives, also good. The bartenders were friendly and seemed to be busy but had enough brain power to talk to us which was nice. Time for dinner! I went over and told them we had reservations and the hostess asked where we wanted to sit. (I thought, shouldnt you have a table reserved for us??) I said anywhere is fine.

It was very cold last Saturday so we both had heavy coats, I said I would go back to the bar and get the wife and coats that were drapped over the bar stools by the way and we would be ready for our dinner. We waited nearly 10 minutes standing there by the kitchen wondering if she had forgot about us, so I asked another server to get our hostess. Unreal!

We march upstairs to our table. Our server came over and asked us if we wanted to start with a cocktail, ummmmmm duh.....there sitting on our table already...hello?????
Anyway after a few minutes, I ordered a bottle of wine, and lemme tell ya it was an expencive bottle. He brought it over and opened it up in an &#34;OK&#34; manner (I think he was a newer server) but really did not present it well to be honest but poured me a taste and we thought it has to open up a bit yet, so we asked if he could decant it for us. Oh boy.....he takes the bottle and leaves with it, comes back with it in a decanter, great, I just spent $100 on a bottle I am wondering if it is the same bottles I ordered!! I am very sure it was however, but should I have to wonder about that? That should be done directly in front of us.
Anyway, as he poured us a glass, I noticed that the decanter was the most disgusting, greasy, filthy, and down right made you wanna vomit looking decanter I have ever seen!! I didnt want to touch it that is how filthy this thing was. We ordered the calamari  and the parmesan cheese, for apps prior to dinner and the bottle of wine, both were good, but we did ask for the check and went to another place.

I am still in shock, this place should be on top of it for the prices they charge, come on $100 for wine in a decanter that looks like they store it in the mens room behind the toilet. No thanks, my money is green, it spends anywhere!!"

Resaurant was more than half empty.  We were a party of 6 and were seated promptly. That was about the best thing of the whole experience.  Service was inexcusably bad.  My mother requested butter since none is brought to the table for her bread.  We ended up having to ask 3x for butter, and then when they finally brought the butter, it was this incredibly tiny pat of butter about the size of your thumb nail!  We just couldn&#39;t believe it.  I had to ask for extra lemon for my ice tea more than once.  My brother requested a side of extra sauce for his pizza when he ordered, and had to ask for it again once the food was deivered.

On the positive side, their pizza&#39;s are very good, Very thin, crisp crust.  Bread is good and olive oil is provided automatically.

However, I don&#39;t know where management was, but no one inquired as to how our meal went, until the very end, when Molly our server did come to the table and apologized for the service but nothing was comped off the bill.  

Restaurant management 101, you should always have the hostess or a bus boy walking around, refilling water glasses, clearing plates, taking care of the little requests like the butter, or addiitional lemons, etc.  

If this was a LEYE restaurant the whole meal would have been comped.  I&#39;ve been at a LEYE restaurant and not even complained, and management noticed something was amiss and immediately comped my lunch.

Wednesday.  We were the only people in there.  We ordered the arancini, calamari for
appetizers.  The arancini were still frozen on the inside.  The calamari were soggy.
After we ordered a pizza, and gnocchi with a pesto cream sauce, per our waitress
suggestion.  The gnocchi were gummy, overdone, with no taste of pesto!  The
pizza was dry.  The room was empty, and since we had a 2 year old with us, I
would of thought that they would of not put anyone close to us.  A young couple 
walked in and they seated them right next to us. The whole restaurant was empty.
They had to asked to be seated elsewhere.  The waitress was apologetic, but she
knew that the food was not up to any standards.  We got our bill, paid and left.

I will say, it&#39;s a place that may have you limiting your drinking consumption with the unreasonable amount of $15 per glass for bar wine, we didn&#39;t find it justifiable, especially in todays economy; then too at the table finding an otherwise cheap bottle being very expensive.   If I were to order top shelf wine I may expect to pay such an amount, but not even the Ritz Carlton Cafe in downtown Chicago charges that.

I&#39;m a native of Hinsdale, but live downtown and love all the &#34;Marche&#34; restaurants (Opera, Redlight, etc.)  When I found out the same group was opening a place in the suburbs, I was so excited because they ordinarily have unique concepts and exceptional food.  

The place is decorated well, and its nice to have a large bar in downtown Hinsdale.  Fortunately, our entrees were good.  Not fabulous, but good.  

However, that is all the praise I&#39;ll give Il Poggiolo.  When I left the restaurant, I literally said to my dining partner, &#34;They must think people in the suburbs are idiots.&#34;  

Most upscale restaurants downtown know that they will get customers that know what they&#39;re talking about, i.e. Foodies.  Thus, they cannot serve cheap, poor quality, or ill-prepared food.  However, Il Poggiolo did just that.  And it probably wouldn&#39;t take a foodie to figure this problem out.

As we ordered our appetizer and entrees, we ordered the tuna appetizer.  The waiter told us not to get it.  Shocked, we asked why and he informed us that he just didn&#39;t think we&#39;d like it.  My honest thought was that he must not like rare tuna, as that is how most tuna apps are served.  Regardless of his warning, we ordered it.

He brought out a plate with what looked like catfood on it with some capers and drenched in lemon juice.  As we tried it out, we both turned to each other and said, &#34;This is canned tuna.&#34;  As we&#39;re both young persons, we have had our fair share of sh*tty canned tuna, so we know what it tastes like, and it was just that.

When the waiter returned, we congratulated him on being right, and asked him &#34;Dude, this is canned tuna, isn&#39;t it?&#34;  He said yes, it was.  He explained that not enough people order it to warrant buying fresh tuna, so the chef prepares it canned and calls it fresh on the menu.

Honestly, if it had just been bad, I wouldn&#39;t have care.  But the fact that the chef obviously didn&#39;t think his patrons were smart enough to figure out that it was canned tuna was just plain insulting. 

Shame on you, chef."

The two hostesses were really sweet and offered us our choice of seating. I appreciated that and we sat downstairs with a view of the bar and the door. We came early and I noticed that there were other families with small children in this section, which is appropriate. It is noisier downstairs and if you are looking for a quieter evening I would suggest going upstairs.
I love the decor of the place and found it to be really inviting and everyone we encountered was very friendly. Our waiter seemed very new and was &#34;off his game&#34; but he was very sweet and though he kept forgetting things (ie: our drinks, to return our credit card, etc) I am sure he will learn with time!
They had a good wine list and what looked to be a lively bar scene. At 5:30 on a Thursday the bar was filled with an older, after work crowd. 
We shared the lamb meatballs, which were amazing! I had a salad with dates that I loved and we shared a pasta dish that was o.k. Neither of us cared for the sauce, which was really sugary and the pasta was a little gummy. 
The apple torta for desert was amazing and more than made up for the sort of generic tasting pasta. 
I would definitely come back for that salad, the appetizers and maybe skip the pastas and try the entrees. The lamb was so good that I would love to try some of the meat dishes next time. 
All in all it is a great place that is kid friendly without being overrun by kids."

Not the case.  Hinsdale is in desperate need of a good restaurant!  The food left you not satisfied.  The waitstaff was lazy and not attentive.  The Manager/General Manager never came by our table after I asked to speak to someone about my improperly cooked fish.

Its setting is chic and modern in historic downtown Hinsdale, the building was actually a silent movie theater for many years.

My recommendations are the sausage and pepper pizza and the pesce Panini and take advantage of the half priced bottles of wine on Monday."

The food is really good Italian... the decor is Kleiner, (which, while it&#39;s nothing new to me, is perfectly cool with me) and I feel there is finally I place that I feel is a destination restaurant.  While I usually make the trek into the city to dine, I feel this is a worthwhile choice NOT to.   Furthermore, It&#39;s a great place to meet friends and have a glass of wine in the evening.  Also, went to early dinner with my four year old and there was a fantastic children&#39;s menu, they brought crayons and they showered her with attention....  They obviously know the way to my heart... 

I&#39;d go here for lunch (business or pleasure), for dinner (date or with kids) or just for wine...    My only complaint is that things shut down early... A western suburb problem, not exclusive to Il Poggiolo.  I&#39;m a night owl, though...

This is a good restaurant... no &#34;for the suburbs&#34; caveat!

Rather than the usual Mother&#39;s Day brunch in the city (usually Bin 36) , my family is choosing to spend it here!  Stay tuned for review..."

Few places do it right in Chicago, such as Coco Pazzo, Spiaggia, Piccolo Sogno and a few others. And most are knee-deep in big ragu, marinara, garlic, yadda yadda. And sure, the poseurs have the faux trappings, such as the great Tuscan/Bolognese walls (wallpaper, btw, not Venetian plaster) and an astoundingly handsome bar. It gave me great promise when I entered, but it took about 8.3 seconds post-bar review to realize that I&#39;d seen this movie a dozen times.  I mean, c&#39;mon, Kleiner has a signature to his restaurant designs, but don&#39;t owners ever sit across a table from him and ask, &#34;Ummmm, since my checks seem to be clearing for your design, would you mind terribly giving me something I haven&#39;t seen e v e r y w h e r e  else you&#39;ve done a job?&#34; C&#39;mon. It&#39;s beyond boring. It&#39;s become a cliche&#39; for his design.  Let&#39;s not even enter into the only one bathroom issue for a restaurant that holds 150 or so. Maybe he has a Kleiner-DesignWerks catheter that he can market along with first course offerings.    On to the food: Someone else in these reviews mentioned the infused olive oil (once the bus and bread boy finally showed up). Lose it and opt for just a great olive oil. It reminded me of places that put lemon in table water. It&#39;s like a signal that, &#34;Hey, our water tastes crappy, so here&#39;s a lemon.&#34;  Leave the option of flavoring olive oils to the customer, please.  Also, the waitress who was overstressed with two other parties to take care of my simple two-top, seemed preoccupied and almost put off that we asked about wines by the glass. We ordered the calamari, which was thicker-cut than I&#39;d had before, properly prepared and served with a couple of great thin-sliced and deep-fried lemon.  Our entree&#39; choices were goat cheese ravioli and (get ready for this) buccatini carbonara. The ravioli was good, tasty, pretty, overall a solid a choice. I resisted the choice of buccatini pasta as a carbonara, but was assured it was a huge hit, so I contradicted my basic instincts which are tempered by three years of living in Milan where I never--ever--EVER---would have seen a carbonara made with a big, doughy buccatini. Hell, I&#39;d get laughed out of a place in Milano ordering that. My suspicions were confirmed when it was served. I had two bites and realized that this was just so wrong on so many levels. The waitress finally came to check if &#34;All&#39;s OK, hon???&#34; at which point I told her about my disappointment. She said she had it there when she visited Italy for two weeks. Perhaps in her two weeks she went different places than I found in three years. Who knows. Suffice it to say I thought it was less than its promise. Will I go back? Maybe for a drink at the bar, but I normally eschew places where half the bar is inhabited by guys trying to look like Tony Soprano, all in their appropriate uniform: Camp shirt, silk pants, &#34;Mr. T Starter Kit&#34; chains, and enough &#34;rearranging their personal furniture&#34; to make the Seven Bechka Brothers Moving Company blush. One final Kleiner note: The scale and execution of the north wall is off. The big circular porthole window was centered on the total wall width, not the visual center. How did the owner ever allow that to happen? You can&#39;t help but look at it and think, &#34;Wow, I thought this guy was supposed to be some kind of Wunderkind, but perhaps he&#39;s just as much a poseur as those guys at the bar.&#34;  You don&#39;t have to be an architect or designer to see that something is visually wrong and this was clearly an unforced, avoidable error."

The waiter was awful and inattentive - everytime he spoke, it was like nails on a chalkboard.  Our food never really came on time and I hate it when the wine comes after the food is served.   The portions on my husband&#39;s plate were little (pork special with a scary looking pork rind on the dish) and I&#39;ve honestly had better Margarita pizza at California Pizza kitchen.    Around 7pm they lowered the lights upstairs and it was too dark too see without any candles on the table.

- Gon Chow Ngau Ho (standard, not terrible)
- BBQ Pork Fried Rice (same, pretty decent)
- Beef with Broccoli (POISON! Okay, not poison, but it was def funky)

Let&#39;s elaborate. Since I&#39;m a lady, I&#39;m not really familiar with the smell of a urinal. However, my boo informed me that the beef with broccoli did, in fact, smell like a urinal. It was weird and creepy and we didn&#39;t eat it. 

We called the place and they let us bring it back for a refund. Later, we asked our chef friend for potential reasons why the food would have smelled so bad. His guess was that the broccoli was probably really old, which is a better scenario than using urinal cakes as an ingredient. But it is still a little off putting.

So long story short, very standard carry out with questionably fresh ingredients. I&#39;ve had a lot better. Wah wahhhhhh!"

It&#39;s true that Taste of China goes a little heavy on the cornstarch, but what quick chinese takeout place doesn&#39;t? What really shines at Taste are their huge eggrolls, delicious crab rangoons, and phenomenal Hong Sue Chicken or Shrimp. 

The eggrolls are thick and stuffed with delicious cabbage, shrimp, pork, and soy sauce and always hit the spot. Kids come home and want Portillos. I come home and want eggrolls.  (P.S. They have a veggie eggroll if you can&#39;t do the meat)

The crab rangoon is also great: huge triangles filled with crab and cream cheese, guaranteed to melt in your mouth. Delicious.

Okay, Hong Sue. It&#39;s a dark brown sauce that is savory (and not spicy) and has no cornstarch. It comes with veggie like water chestnuts, carrots, mushrooms, snap peas, and bamboo shoots. It comes with a side of breaded *insert pork, chicken, beef, shrimp here* and is to die for with rice.  Seriously, my go to dish pretty much every time.

Sometimes I just want my standard Americanized Chinese food and Taste of China did a great job providing me exactly that.  Meat was REAL - with no odds and ends and all white-meat chicken.

I had their appetizers of egg rolls, crab rangoon, and candied rib. Those were all delicious. Some of the best I&#39;ve ever had.

The prices aren&#39;t bad either for the portions you get. So that&#39;s a plus!

My issue was with the main course. The Gong Ho Chow mein. I did not like it. It tasted like Salisbury steak sauce poured over noodles. Too thick. I didn&#39;t eat much. But I was told their fried rice and sesame chicken are the best ever. I will need to try those next time I visit. 

So if you want Chinese food you can&#39;t go wrong here. I just wouldn&#39;t recommend the chow mein."

Dining in: Service is fast and attentive, and the food came out very quickly. We ate fried rice, chow fun, egg rolls, crab rangoon, egg drop soup, and chicken (orange chicken, maybe?). Everything was delicious! I didn&#39;t get to eat much of the chicken though, because my dining companions wolfed it down before I could get more than 2 bites!

Takeout: Wait, did you just say I can pick this order up in 10 minutes? How cow, that is FAST! Ordered favorites again (the fried rice, crab rangoon and what just might be my favorite egg rolls did NOT disappoint!) and changed out the chicken to general tso, since that is my hubby&#39;s measuring stick for any Chinese restaurant. The chicken&#39;s texture wasn&#39;t as mouth-melting, poppingly crispy as my all-time favorite from Shanghai (a little place in Emporia KS), but the breading was respectable in texture and the sauce is nothing to sneeze at... I&#39;d order it again.

A tip though: everything reheats well EXCEPT the chow fun (it turns to mush as leftovers), so make sure that you finish that one while it is still fresh!"

Me and my crew have been going there so long we had a special bond with the previous owners and the staff. The previous owners, who are older, understood how to treat long time customers and keep them. The new owner is younger and does not get it when it comes to keeping customers coming there.

Then  a few dishes I picked were not orderable (then why put them on the manual ). Finally I got beef with broccoli, which you can find in any Chinese restaurant.  It&#39;s really really average.

Long story short, this will be our first and last time here. 

The egg drop soup is not very good. It literally tastes like we were drinking straight scrambled eggs. The beef in the beef and broccoli was very mushy and low grade. The sesame chicken was ok but nothing to write home about. 

Finally, as I was in the middle of writing the review at the restaurant our server asked what we wanted boxed up. We told her the chicken and rice but not the beef and broccoli. She said it heated up well, but we still told her that we would prefer not to have it. She pressed the issue for a minute more and then said that &#34;we always order the same thing.&#34; We told her it was our first time here and she turned around and walked away. My wife and I all thought that this whole situation was quite humorous but uncalled for at the same time.

Their lunch special is pretty rad, it&#39;s like $4.35 a person and you get either a beverage or egg roll.  Or maybe it&#39;s soup.  Or something.  We&#39;ve done the lunch thing twice and I&#39;ve gotten the vegetable &#34;delight&#34; with fried rice both times (with beverage).  We order an egg roll appetizer too.  So anyway, it&#39;s super cheap and you get quite a portion - I can never finish it but that could be because I&#39;m stuffing egg rolls into my face and filling up on those.

They aren&#39;t creating fancy new Asian dishes for foodies to fawn over.  It is just good, inexpensive, simple Chinese food.  In fact, it is my favorite Chinese restaurant because I like my Chinese food simple.  That is a big bonus for families with picky eaters like myself, though foodies and adventurous diners may not get a thrill out of it.

As far as the staff, I&#39;ve been getting take-out there for years and it has never been an issue.  They are polite, efficient and communicate well enough in English.  When I asked them to make me a party tray of fried rice for work, they asked me what size I wanted: half or full tray.  It is not on the menu anywhere, but they were happy to do it.  People at work devoured it and asked me to bring two trays the next time.  I&#39;d call that a success!"

Let me say this: there are only two downsides: 1) the decor - it looks like they&#39;ve never updated anything inside the restaurant; 2) they don&#39;t deliver.  

But, at least you can call ahead and pick up your food, typically in 15 minutes or less - which is remarkable!  I can&#39;t recall a time when it&#39;s ever taken longer than expected, or where the order wasn&#39;t right.  Top notch service when it comes to speed!

We always order extra egg rolls because they&#39;re just so damn good.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything on the menu I don&#39;t like - so that being said, I don&#39;t have a particular recommendation!  They&#39;ve saved me in a few home-cooking dinner disasters in the past"

It wont be the greatest but it is quite affordable.  So if you are just looking to get some decent Chinese eats, and it&#39;s close enough, you may find this your go-to &#34;take out&#34; place.  

Since my first review,  I have been back since and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s me or what but the quality of the foods hasn&#39;t quite match my first impression of it.  Maybe things tasted different when you get them carried-out instead of dine in (which I&#39;ve only done once since the first time)? 

So far up to date, I have tried Chop Suey which tasted very bland.  And just today, I ordered a Combo Chow Fun and some sort of Fish Fillet in Black Bean sauce and Garlic and both kind of ended up looking the same and tasting the same.  They were very saucy and dark-brown and wasn&#39;t very flavored.  The only exception was the fish fillet which came out very salty! Now I know that most of dishes use the same basic ingredients or technique but I think as a restaurant, their cooking skills and tasting variety should be placed above of what I can conjure up at home.

So it&#39;s unfortunate but to keep up with expectations, I&#39;m changing my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars."

One plate will fill you up - for a different take on the Chinese buffets that dominates these cross streets you can go with someone else and order 3 dishes affordably.  A friend and I can do this but yes, if you do you will still have to be rolled out of here.

The hot and sour soup - yes it is probably loaded with something I don&#39;t want to know about... but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had better.  It is like when you like the knock-off fruit snacks better than the brand name ones even though the texture and color is a bit off.

Orange chicken is spicy but good.  Beef and broccoli is very hearty and full of flavor.  General Tso&#39;s sticks to your gums just right.  The main dishes rank high on value and pretty high on flavor for the price.

I constantly tell new recruits to the cult of The Gong that if they come with, and don&#39;t like their food, I&#39;ll buy it for them. No one has taken me up on my money back guarantee yet.

Why?

Because The Gong is incredible. That&#39;s why. They serve the finest egg rolls on this side of the Pacific, and believe me, I&#39;ve tried many an egg roll in my day. Their potstickers are divine, and really, everything else they make is simply incredible. Their lunch specials are insane, and for $5 you can get enough to eat to send you straight into a food coma, especially if you add an order of potstickers on top.

Just found out that the owners of Gong Ho retired and it was sold to new owners with new cooks and staff a few weeks ago.  One waitress stayed behind.  Everyone else is basically new.  When placing my order, new staff was not aware of what shredded pork was and had to go ask if they sold it.  Fried rice was tasteless, egg drop soup was bland, and all food was bland, made differently than normally, not with original Gong Ho flavor.  This place better step up.  Food was not good!!!  I am terribly upset.  I was a loyal customer for over 20 years.  My family had been coming here since I was in grade school, and we even knew the owners before the owners that just retired, and the past owners and all their staff.  Sadly, I will not be coming back.  My only other favorite place now in Downers Grove is take out only, Hong Kong carry out on Fairview.  I order from here weekly.

Don&#39;t make the mistake of going inside the main restaurant door hoping to get your takeout order. If you do accidentally step inside, go back out onto the sidewalk and head about 20 feet to the right. If this sounds like the voice of experience, you may be on to something.

The lunch specials are really quite remarkable values -- all of the dishes are between $4 and $5, and they are not small portions AND the lunch menu is available on weekends. I asked for my General Tso&#39;s Chicken to be made extra spicy, and they accommodated me. The food was fine -- not spectacular. This is not a Tony Hu restaurant after all.

If I lived closer by, I might eat here a couple of times a month from the lunch menu because it&#39;s such a fine value. But as-is, unless I&#39;m in the neighborhood, I&#39;ll probably not make it here very often. I&#39;m pretty sure many others will be happy to take my place."

With those criteria set, this place is amazing.  No, it&#39;s not gourmet Chinese food.  But you can get a huge feed here of decent food, and it&#39;s hotter, tastier, and cheaper than Panda Express.  With sit down service!

Seriously.  Set your expectations accordingly, but just sit down, order a lunch combo, and be impressed as it shows up almost before you&#39;re done speaking the order.  Then eat and enjoy, and pay on the way out.

You get enough food for anyone, and it&#39;s cheaper than a buffet.  Even faster some days."

Cheap food..... CHECK
Food COMA.... if there are grammatical errors below...CHECK
You won&#39;t find the SLOWSKI&#39;s here.  Service was very fast and for a quick business lunch i was in and out in 25 minutes!


The good:

Great egg roll
Egg drop soup was above average.  Very &#34;yolky&#34; and not watered down like most places.
Fried rice had good flavor ( i prefer more veggies)

The ok:

The general Tso&#39;s chicken was just average.  The sauce was too sweet, i had 1 piece of veggie on my plate.  It was not spicy at all.

No refills on soda and meal did not come with egg roll.  Total out the door with tip was $10...."

It took longer than a year but after some good trial and error the winner is Gong Ho for now. Lunch specials that are under $5 and so much fried rice that you can tell they had to scoop some out just to get the lid on. I have just begun to run through the menu but everything had been really good so far.

We did the general tso&#39;s chicken, sesame chicken, and a combo with bbq pork, egg roll,  and some rangoons. Chicken was crispy and still juicy - somehow impossible for takeout places to get right. The sauces were spot on and just spicy enough to keep me and my chili obsession at bay. Dark fried rice which brings me back to a small little chop suey place where I grew up took it over the top.

Check this place out for lunch cause you can prob fill up with whatever cash is between your car seats. This place is as sold as your gonna find for the price and the quality it up there too. Oh and btw the map on Yelp is way off so use your GPS to find it or you will never get there!"

First impression when we walked in the door was stacks of corrugated boxes containing fortune cookies (which we later found to be tasteless) and other supplies.  It seemed odd that this restaurant has no windows.

Food was inconsistent.  Wonton soup was plain, sesame chicken was crispy and tasty, but the Beef Kow had an off-taste.  Service was decent, but food is brought on carts that are noisy on the multiple floor surfaces.  Table clean-up carts are even noisier.

Here&#39;s what I learned while I was there...
1. It&#39;s cheap
2. It&#39;s cheap
3. It&#39;s cheap

Seriously cheap food. Decent food though. It&#39;s nothing I&#39;d write home about, but for $11.00, my husband and I ate a pretty decent lunch. Highlights from the combination platter that I ordered included the fried rice (pretty tasty), crab rangoon, and the teriyaki beef. The chicken tenderloin was just okay, as was the fried shrimp. But for $4.35 I got a sample of 5 different menu items and the majority of them were pretty good. My only complain is that I wish they would improve the sweet and sour sauce since I tend to use that quite a bit when eating Chinese Food. Theirs was okay.... but there&#39;s room for improvement.

Is it the best Chinese food I&#39;ve ever had? No. Would I come back? Sure!"

3 stars for food quality (A-Ok!) which is totally acceptable - if I were grading strictly within the realm of &#34;American&#34; Chinese restaurants (including those sometimes questionable buffet joints), I would give 5 stars... but hey I don&#39;t want people to forget this is not a &#34;fine dining&#34; establishment like another reviewer mentioned.

If you are in the area for lunch - they have GREAT lunch specials for a great price.

Atmosphere: not super nice, but like I said above, this isn&#39;t a fine dining establishment.  The place is well suited to get people in and get them out.  

Service: I believe this is a family owned place, so you see the same folks there every time.  The majority of the people you deal with are OVERLY nice.  When you get to deal with them, it makes your day better.  There is one waitress who has a bit of an attitude and you always hope to never get sat at her table.  Overall, the service is incredible.

Food: For a local quick and easy Chinese restaurant, the food is great.  I am never disappointed with the food.  I moved to the area about 3 years ago and tried countless Chinese places and was turned off to each one on account of the bad food.  I tried Gong Ho and haven&#39;t gone to a different Chinese place since.

Price: out of this world.  Lunch specials start at 3.95.  I regularly walk out of there after lunch with a $10 bill for 2 people.  Dinner is a little more expensive, but they do have a good selection of family dinners that provide a whole lot of food at a reasonable price.

I would highly recommend Gong Ho if you are looking for a good local Chinese restaurant to eat in or take out."

1) I had nasty hair in my food!  Not once, but twice!  I just cringe everytime I think of eating here because I visualize pulling long gooey hair out of my kung pao.  Not appetizing in the least.

2) The waiter was creepy.   He kept peeking at us from behind the wall.  It wasn&#39;t to check on food and drinks because he had just served us.  It was like he was secretly playing peek-a-boo.   Freaked us out a little.

3) The food wasn&#39;t even that good.  I&#39;m new to the Chicago area, so maybe there aren&#39;t a lot of good Chinese restaurants in this area, but I would give this about a 5 out of 10.

4) It was filthy.  Again, not sure how things are in this area, but when my forearm sticks to the table cloth (or should I say plastic), it&#39;s never a good sign.

Overall, this place is a no-go for me.  If I really wanted hair in my food, I&#39;ll just make my own food and have my cats walk all over it."

The orange peel chicken is phenomenal, and my dad swears by the Szechuan chicken.  The crab rangoon is awesome.

I went there and got some General Tso&#39;s fish with white rice, an egg roll, hot and sour soup, and an almond cookie and fortune cookie and paid $6!!  Food was good, (I&#39;m not going to over-exaggerate and be like &#34;ZOMFG its AMAZING!!!!!&#34;) Its good food, fresh ingredients, and nice flavor...that&#39;s it.  I have read a few reviews of people saying it was sub par, this and that...but you have to realize that first off this is &#34;americanized&#34; chinese food.  Every single chinese restaurant in the burbs (with the exception of a few) are americanized...and ALL americanized chinese restaurants will be &#34;eh&#34;.  (My opinion, &#39;cuz I&#39;m asian and enjoy the authentic stuff...ie &#34;sweet n sour chicken&#34; is not a chinese dish) This restaurant however, has a better menu than 90% of the other suburban chinese restaurants out there.  They actually serve chow fun.  The chow mein is actually yellow egg noodles, and not those cheap little crunchy things that other americanized chinese places serve.  I&#39;d like to think that Gong Ho is a nice bridge between americanized chinese and authentic chinese.  They have a lil bit of both, and mesh it together well.

If you want real authentic hardcore chinese, go down to wentworth and cermak in the city and you&#39;ll find amazing real chinese food there.  Gong Ho&#39;s food is made for the american palate, and for the price of the lunch combos it beats anything from your local fast food restaurant!  I walk out stuffed after having lunch there and only spent $6!  You can&#39;t come into this restaurant expecting 5-star quality food for less-than-fast-food prices.  I don&#39;t walk into Burger King and ask for 2 filet mignon burgers for $2.  Be realistic about your expectations and you&#39;ll see what I mean. =)"

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s their fault or mine, but maybe I should find a different place to get Chinese food. I went there yesterday and when I called ahead of time to order VERY simple order of pork chow mein, I was told that I was crazy because the woman didn&#39;t understand what I was saying. I went in there and told her the same thing. She shows me a plate of noodles and says which one. I showed her and she says ok, like nothing.  I chose the one THAT&#39;S EXACTLY what I said on the phone. I didn&#39;t ask for the dish to be spicy or didn&#39;t ask for lo mein. What was the big deal? I didn&#39;t appreciate her calling me crazy because she didn&#39;t understand me. If you will run a business in Downers Grove, how about catering to your market and having an English speaking order taker? The food is just ok, not anything too great but I have not found another non-buffet Chinese food place nearby."

Being a Chicago transplant, I am well versed in Chinese cuisine and this place was mediocre at best.  The prices were ok and they did have my order ready quickly, but the quality of the food was just not there.  The mushrooms seemed to come from a can and the food overall just did not seem fresh.  It was also slightly greasy as well.

I think we ordered a total of about 13 pizzas including specialty and regular topping pizzas. I was very impressed with the service, coordination, and communication throughout. Even though local owned, they are very professional and truly care about the customer&#39;s experience. Delivery was handled easily and pizzas were still hot even though they traveled 30 minutes to arrive. With about 150 people in attendance, several guests inquired about where the pizza was from and had countless compliments about the taste. I think the Chicken Fajita might&#39;ve been the fan favorite. 

I have also ordered burgers from there on a personal occasion, and again was thoroughly impressed. I highly recommend this place for both personal and party experiences."

Their pizza&#39;s are excellent especially the &#34;Chicken Fajita Supreme&#34; and #1 is &#34;Creamy Chicken Pizza.&#34; in my opinion. 

The burgers and sandwiches are just ok, not on par with the tasty pizza&#39;s. The gyro wrap is a bit salty with only gyros and onions in it (big portions more than enough to fill you up). I would have preferred a few more veggies in it such as tomatoes, lettuce etc. 

They also need to improve the &#34;look&#34; of the restaurant a bit, especially the bathroom (needs more lighting, a nice sink as well instead of that mini one.)

All in all, I would recommend ordering take out, and definitely the pizzas, they all have a slight Indian twist and are verry well done."

We tried both their butter chicken pizza and their gyro pizza. 
The butter chicken pizza was delicious. The unique sweet tomatoey chicken flavor on a think crust pizza with green peppers and red onions topped with cheese was a great combination. 
The gyro pizza was on par with other gyro pizzas I have had at Italian express and also very good.
For desert we had mango and pistachio kulfi. Wow so light and refreshing. The pistachio actually had pieces of pistachio in it. 
Give this place a try and be adventurous when ordering your pizza. And if you want it spicy be sure to tell them when ordering. You&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised!"

Also, if you plan to come for deep dish, don&#39;t come as soon as they open, because it takes 2 hours for the oven to heat up. Even regular pizza takes 45 minutes.

However, what really makes this place stand out is there unique Indian inspired toppings. My favorite is the Bihari Chicken, which has something truly Chicagoan about it with the sports peppers side by side with Indian-spiced chicken. The variety of speciality pizzas ensures you&#39;ll never get bored and they are good enough to keep you craving it and coming back for more. Be sure to try the Butter Chicken and Arabian as well.

This is more of a take out operation so the dine in experience is more of the hole-in-the-wall variety, but food is worth it."

Their best pizza is the thin crust seikh kabob supreme. The combination of the spicy seikh kabob and the traditonal pizza ingredients is sheer genius. I am a huge pizza fan and accept nothing less than awesome. This pizza did it for me. I love thin crust. They have both thin and pan styles.

The gyro pizza is outstanding - and it blows away the gyro pizza that all the other places serve - these guys got it right.

Lastly, the pricing is very very reasonable. E.g the large seikh kabob thin-crust pizza was 12.49. 

The place sits about 20 people - not a restaurant, more like a small casual place. If you are a fan of good pizza you must try this place.

Edit: They must have taken the other review into consideration and souped up the seating area. It now has two comfy round tables that each seat a family of 5, and they have 4 small tables that each seat 2. So that&#39;s 2 × 5 + 4 × 2 = 18 seats."

We wanted pizza and just saw their add so we figured we&#39;d give it a shot. At first we didn&#39;t think they were open because no one answered the phone. But then 2 mins later we get a call back from them. We asked them if they are open and they said &#39;yes.&#39; Then we asked if they have dine-in and they said &#39;yes.&#39; We were about 10 mins away but it took us about 20 mins to get there because iphone maps could not locate it. We had to then try through google and it got us there eventually. They said they opened up about 2 months ago.
The place was small and only had seating for about 10 people. Since we had 7, we pretty much took up all the seats and utilized the bench. We placed our order and realized that this was not a dine-in restaurant at all. There where no plates, napkins, silverware or glasses on the tables so we had to ask for everything individually.  Plus they had not highchairs so my 2 year old kept trying to get off the chair and run around.
We ordered 2 pizzas (1 pepperoni and 1 sausage), wings (BBQ) and cheese sticks. We asked if we can have the cheese stick first since they are appetizers.
It ended up that the cheese sticks where the last food item to come out. However the pepperoni pizza was great!!! The pizza sauce tasted very fresh and the dough wasn&#39;t too heavy. The wings were ok but my daughter loved em. The cheese sticks were standard.
The owners seemed like very nice and sincere people but I don&#39;t think they understand what &#34;dine-in&#34; means in a restaurant. I&#39;m sure I will go back here again in the future but it will only be for carry out."

I ordered three tacos (steak, chicken, and carnita) and chips with guacamole.  The carnitas taco was my favorite, flavorful and extremely tender.  The chips were fresh, but the guacamole was a little bland, could have used a little more onions and cilantro.  I added some of their very tasty red hot sauce to it, and that did the trick.

Let me just say this food is legit. The steak tacos are my favorite. The food is always hot and fresh. The burritos and chicken tacos are also pretty tasty. I come here weekly for the chilaquiles or huevos con jamon as this is my child&#39;s Sunday breakfast treat. The service is friendly and prompt. Best Mexican food in Bolingbrook!

First impressions were good, place was nice and clean and the &#34;hostess&#34; was very friendly. I ordered 3 tacos (Pastor, Carne Asada &amp; Chorizo), a Mexican Restaurant can&#39;t go wrong with tacos, if they do, something is horribly wrong. In the case of Tacqueria Coral, they hit the nail right on the head. All tacos had plenty of meat and the taste was spot on, my favorite was the Pastor. I probably would have given this place 4 or 5 stars but unfortunately it missed the mark on one point - food received in a timely manner. I placed my to-go order at 12:55 pm and didn&#39;t receive my order till 1:13 pm, to me, this seems a little long for 3 tacos plus another couple that placed their order after me received their order before me? I guess someone dropped the ball and I would have been okay with it if they at least acknowledged the fact that they missed my order and maybe offered some chips or a drink for my wait but they offered nothing. I&#39;ll be back when in the area and hopefully I can adjust their rating."

Empanadas the size of an infant&#39;s head.  A large infant&#39;s head.  Cookies the size of your face and what I&#39;d call &#34;a small C cup&#34; on the muffins.  Don&#39;t forget the slices of cake that are more like slabs.

There weren&#39;t any bags in sight, so I asked the lady behind the counter.  Don&#39;t be fooled by the older Mexican lady appearance, she spoke sparkling English.  She handed me a tray and tongs so I could choose my pastries.

The signs weren&#39;t in English, but I knew what an &#34;empanada&#34; was well enough to purchase 3 (one was filled with what I think was orange marmalade).  I also picked out a muffin-y looking dessert.  The sign read &#34;blueberry,&#34; but I think it was in the wrong spot.  I devoured this one before I got home:  it was shaped like a muffin, with a cheesecake layer on top and what tasted like a corn bread on the bottom layer.  I could&#39;ve split this muffin with someone, but I didn&#39;t want to!  

If you aren&#39;t familiar with Mexican pastries, they are not super sweet and sugary.  The empanada I tried had a very mellow orange flavor and the dough had a coffee-cake like texture.  Most pastries are on the dry side and again, not super sweet.

For 4 pastries (3 empanadas and a cheesecake corn muffin thing), I paid $3.81.  This place is the real deal.  I definitely didn&#39;t expect to find something like this in the suburbs.  I thought I&#39;d have to drive out to Humboldt Park for a flipping churro. 

They also serve Mexican food here; there were 2-3 couples in here.  I got a side-glance from one guy that clearly said, &#34;is this white girl lost?&#34;

Panaderia Coral is on the north side of Boughton Road at the intersection of Schmidt.  There isn&#39;t much else in the shopping center; there&#39;s a Middle Eastern grocery store and not much else."

Went in for breakfast today and as soon as we walked in everything looked dirty... We decided to stay because we couldn&#39;t find anywhere else to eat chilaquiles. Our burnt tortilla chips were the second red flag, however, we decided to stay and try our food. Our plates came out and we noticed the tortillas in our chilaquiles were just as bad as the chips. We literally took 2 bites and decided we&#39;d rather let $20 go to waste than to keep eating the food. The guy at the front noticed and did offer a replacement for the food instead of a refund but seeing as to how bad one meal was I was hesitant to try something else there. As a restaurant manager myself I could tell that the problem was the oil they were using to fry tortilla chips was probably old, hopefully they fix their restaurant soon. It&#39;d be such a shame to see what was once a decent place to eat completely fail."

I got 6 HUGE ass pastries for $3.27. Seriously, I just about pooped in my pants when she told me the price... or maybe because I ate way too much spicy sauce. Dessert just got even sweeter. 

In addition to my pastry splurge I got 2 avocado tacos and and a veggie burrito. Both were D-lish but the tacos rocked my world. My BF got an egg taco and some other meat junk and the egg taco looked like the perfect cure to a hangover. A meal for 2 with left-overs was $11 and it was all dayum good. 

I&#39;m sooo going back everyday. The only thing I was a little iffy on was that there&#39;s not an English translation for everything so I really only knew what  8 things on the menu were but maybe this will be my motivation to learn more Spanish food words... even though just knowing Jamon and Salchicha has gotten me pretty far up to this point."

Counter in back with large menu above and pastries on the left in openable glass doors for self service.  Was more here for the cooked food than anything else.  $20 got me a chicken torta, steak burrito, 2 al pastor tacos, and flan to go. 

Chicken torta was outstanding!  Sandwich had avocado, lettuce, tomato, and refried beans.  Never encountered big chunks of grilled chicken in a torta before.  Steak burrito had a seasoned-sour cream goodness to it.  Tacos were ok, were packed with a lot of big pieces of meat and onions, but the al pastor didn&#39;t have much flavor.  Same with the flan, aside from the honey on the bottom, as there was no flavor at all.

Burritos and tortas are a must try!  The flan, not so much."

There is nothing to control food dates on bakery. So.. Go for it. As far as the foods. Hmm well.. The horchetta is full flavored. Not watered down and rich flavor with a lot of cinnamon. The quesadilla.. Eww.  None of the cheese was melted. I paid $2.99 for one tortilla folded with unmelted cheese. Who&#39;s not thrilled?? This Girl!  I will however give a second try &amp; update the review. Seems clean &amp; nice ppl. $ is acceptable.

Anyway, I&#39;m just now recovering from the rapture that the pastor tacos induced.  Perfectly seasoned pork, fresher than fresh onions and cilantro, and fantastic hot sauce.

The steak torta was big and yummy, chorizo tacos and al pastor tacos both excellent. The guacamole was fresh and delish. Free chips and salsa and the cook brought us an extra yummy green salsa with chunks of avocado. 

The baked goods also looked yummy. We brought home some flan (since were were already full!) and it was super excellent. I highly recommend for an authentic, but not fancy, Mexican food experience.

Once you walk in you are greeted by the fresh smells of all the bakeries. Fresh breads, cookies, cakes yummy indeed. If you want any of these items you just grab a metal tray and some tongs and pick out what you want. The make special cakes also. 

As for the food. The girls said the steak tacos are the best. I went for a steak taco and steak torta. Yes they were correct. Steak is very good. the tacos are small, so for those with big appetites you will need a few. The torta was huge, kind of like a sub sandwich. ! other had a burrito and no complaints.

1. Place is so much nicer and welcoming since the remodel, even though it was closed while my wife was pregnant and she craved frostys; oh well.
2.  Never have had an issue with great crew, and product has always been consistent.  Occasional mistake, but such is life!  They&#39;ve always made it right.
3.  Drive thru is on the rt 59 side; so naturally if traffic is loud I sympathize with those who have needed to repeat their order.  
4.  With steak and shake closed(thank god: location was terrible) it&#39;s the best place for quick/fast food.
5.  Finally, it&#39;s Wendy&#39;s, overall the experience, service, and location are good especially compared to some of the ones I&#39;ve been to in my life.  Just trying to counter some of these reviews that do not take into account it&#39;s Wendys!

We have tried quite a few other pizza places and wanted to try something new. We searched places around our hotel and, out of the nearby places, this place stood out on Yelp and other travel/review sites. I&#39;m back in Springfield now, am happily eating the leftovers, and figured I&#39;d better tell everyone else how good it is. 

The pizza: we had the stuffed pizza with sausage + mushroom. The sauce is very well seasoned, the cheese is amazing, and we really liked the bread-like crust. It was a good change from dense crusts or cornmeal-based crusts. 

The salad: it was really good. Romaine lettuce, eggs, carrots, radishes, and red peppers went well together. Everything was crisp and fresh. Home run here!
 
The dessert: As much as we liked the pizza, we were equally pleased with dessert.  Banana cream pie for me and carrot cake for my wife. Wowsers - they were fantastic! The banana cream pie was very flavorful from top (whipped cream + slivered almonds) to the bottom (crust, which was really good). The carrot cake was exceptional. The icing still kept a little tang from the cream cheese - something a lot of folks don&#39;t get right. 

The staff: being carry-out only, there were no tables or wait staff. We had a really good chat with the two employees while we waited for the pizza to be done. They were super-friendly and genuinely happy. 

The kitchen: I normally try to get a glance of the establishment&#39;s kitchen to get an idea of cleanliness. The only thing I saw on the floors and counter tops was....some flour. You can&#39;t help but get flour everywhere in a pizza place, but the floors, make tables, counters, etc... were all very clean!!! 

We will definitely come back the next time we are in the area. I&#39;m hoping they still have the Boston cream pie next time, because I really want to try it!!!"

Make sure to pick up one their awesome, homemade desserts.  I really like the banana thing and their carrot cake.  The house salad with dried cranberries, blue cheese and toasted pecans is my daughter&#39;s favorite.

Gianorios makes an excellent pizza.  It has perfect sausage, great sauce, tons of cheese, and a chewy crust.  I like my pizza crust REALLY thin so that was my only complaint.

While I don&#39;t have anything to say that hasn&#39;t already been said, I do have another 5 stars to chip in.

We had the stuffed pizza for the first time last night, and it was so incredibly delicious! Love the sauce, the crust, and the abundance of tasty cheese. I recommend trying the carrot cake, too.

As another reviewer mentioned (or maybe multiple other reviewers), I can&#39;t believe how many times I&#39;ve driven past this place without realizing it was there."

We love the crust on the double dough. We all fight over the outside pieces! The sauce is very tasty and has a homemade fresh taste to it. They are always generous with the cheese and other toppings. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because delivery is not available and they do not offer any coupons . The reason I think is because it&#39;s just that good. They are always busy! Once you get hooked you won&#39;t care that they don&#39;t deliver or offer coupons. Kind of like the &#34;Soup Nazi&#34; on Seinfeld. You have the privilege to eat great pizza or get outta here! LOL- only kidding. They are very polite. But trust me they don&#39;t have to be polite because their pizza is just that good! You will keep coming back.

Ordered a regular crust half mushroom half sausage easy sauce. I thought that the sausage was of high quality and the mushrooms no problem there...however...light sauce should be for the whole pizza not just sections of it. Bit into a piece of mushroom and sauce spilled out upon my bite. I&#39;m just not a fan of a lot of sauce and it should have been made properly. I also wasn&#39;t a fan of the amount of cheese on my pizza. Seemed light for the amount of money pizzas sell for here. Maybe I&#39;ll give them another shot in the future but to me it&#39;s not 5 stars. There are better options in the area.

So when I was hit with an undeniable pizza craving a few days ago, I turned to Gianorio&#39;s.

I called in and ordered the 12&#34; stuffed cheese ($14.50 for the 9&#34; cheese, $18.50 for 12&#34;). It takes about 50 mins to prepare. When I came in to pick up my order, I was promptly helped with friendly service by the young man at the counter. I remembered that I had to try their carrot cake, so I selected that, along with their banana cream pie. Both were generous portions that could easily feed 2-3 people. The total came to $30. When I physically picked up the pizza, I was impressed by its hefty weight haha.

Now onto the pizza. For me, the flavorful sauce &amp; cheese really elevated the pizza into awesome stratus. When I took my first bite, I was transported into my happy place. I may even have closed my eyes and made a few onomatopoeic sounds of appreciation lol. The sauce at first seemed sweet, but no, my tastebuds were tricked; it was more tangy than sweet. Perfect texture to the sauce too, thick and not overly chunky or runny. And of course the cheese was excellent, not bland at all. 

I was impressed that there weren&#39;t greasy pools leaking from the pizza considering the huge amounts of cheese that Gianorio&#39;s stuffed uses. Also, I was glad to note that the crust wasn&#39;t soggy, one of my pet peeves, though I&#39;m lenient if it&#39;s leftover pizza. I noted a slight smokiness at times when biting into the crust, which I enjoyed. And even though I started out ravenous, I couldn&#39;t finish one slice, so big kudos! :D

Of the two desserts, I loved the carrot cake. It was the richest carrot cake that I&#39;ve ever tried, especially with that satisfyingly thick layer of luscious cream cheese frosting. I liked how the frosting wasn&#39;t overly sweet either. This cake was perfect &amp; moist, and I honestly can&#39;t think of how it could be better. The banana cream pie was good, in particular, the buttery thick crust, but I can make better so I&#39;ll pass on this next time.

EDIT June 2013 - Even after trying pizzas in Italy, I still think Gianorio&#39;s has some of the best sauce &amp; cheese I&#39;ve tasted. After returning to the US, I ordered a small stuffed ($14.50 for 9&#34;) and small sausage double dough. The stuffed was spot-on, but the double dough was too much bread for me. I wanted more sauce/toppings. The sausage was okay. I like White Cottage Pizzeria&#39;s sausage better. Next time, I plan on trying their thin pizza ;)"

I now live in central Illinois, but any time it is the weekend (I have my big meals on the weekend), I am in the area, and I am craving pure euphoria/nirvana (pretty sure that doesn&#39;t make sense, but not much of what I write does), I head to Gianorio&#39;s of Winfeld. There is also a location in Lombard (which I have not tried) and there is a Gianorio family deli that is open for lunch M-F down the road. This review focuses on my one and only located at the corner of Geneva and County Farm!

Anyway, I have had Gianorio&#39;s before, but it was a few years back, and I thought it was great, but it wasn&#39;t really by choice.

A friend had it, and we got the standard sausage and pepperoni, regular crust. That was back in high school when my parents used to pay for pizza on the weekends. Now, I am grown up, with a bank account that dwindles because of my frequent Yelp excursions. 

I am now ready to drive and carry out wherever I please, not a slave to my fathers&#39; coupon obsession (even though he never gets a good deal). Plus he eats dinner at about 430 pm everyday, and washes it down with a Busch Light, stay classy, daddy-o! 

.I get the whole early dinner thing if you wake up early, but I feel like dinner should be a reward for a job well done or a hard day at work. That&#39;s the way I look at it. I guess that&#39;s why I love food.

Anyways, in the words of a terribly named legume band (Black Eyed Peas) &#34;I gotta feeling, that tonight&#39;s&#39; gonna be a good night...&#34; Well, weird black guy who has his voice digitized for that song, you were right, every night with Gianorio&#39;s Pizza gon&#39; be a go-ood night. My goodness this pizza makes me want to get up and dance like Justin Timberlake. Don&#39;t even need a suit and tie to eat it (yay pop culture).

Consistency is key, and Yelp usually doesn&#39;t let me down. There are three keys to a good pie, no matter what type you order: thin, regular, double dough, pan, deep dish, or stuffed. 

Yes there is a difference between the latter two. Please do not offend my pizza sensibilities by not recognizing that. I get so upset. My psychiatrist and psychologist tell me not to get upset over things I can&#39;t control. Like pizza novices, but I digress. It doesn&#39;t matter if you prefer cracker thin crust, pan style, or stuffed...

The three things I look for that must be outstanding no matter what are they are crust, sauce and cheese.  


Gianorio&#39;s stuffed cheese and double dough are my favorites. I&#39;ve also had the standard thin, pan, and calzones. I even took a frozen pizza down to my home in Paxton, but let&#39;s be honest. There is nothing like getting a pizza from Angie on a Friday or Saturday night. Her mom is usually there too. The high school students, recent college grads, and working women in the kitchen/oven area give this place charm. They&#39;re all covered in flour and sweeping up usually when I pick up. I would give them all high fives because what they give me is pure bliss via marinara sauce.

If you have room for dessert (I usually save it for the next night), I highly recommend the carrot cake. It&#39;s the best carrot cake I have ever had. They also have coconut creme and banana creme pie, brownies, lemon tarts, chocolate cake, and cupcakes! It&#39;s like finding $10 in your pocket when you wash your jeans...an awesome occurrence! 

Will I be back? Is the sky blue? Is Barack Obama a black man? Are the Cubs awful? All of these are questions that have obvious answers. Gianorio&#39;s, keep it up. 


My brother and I often reminisce about how different our lives would be without ever finding this place. Sure Lou Malnati&#39;s deep dish is great, Giordano&#39;s stuffed is solid, and Gino&#39;s East Meaty Legend is... legendary. It&#39;s about finding what you love and sticking with it. I am all for trying new things. But when a place like Gianorio&#39;s comes along and is consistent, the staff caring, and the service impeccable it&#39;s really hard to dial a different number on pizza night. I always beat myself up for not finding this gem to order throughout my childhood. I wish I found it sooner, I probably would have won the lotto or something life changing. Not as life changing as when you arrive and the smell of success engulfs your nostrils at Gianorio&#39;s Pizza. If this is what love feels like, then I finally know how to love.

P.S. I know I always go back and forth between stuffed and double dough, but I can&#39;t help it. I think I love one more, but it&#39;s like Grandma Gianorio puts here love and care into both pizzas equally. I am not exaggerating either. My only gripe with this place is that I can&#39;t have it every single meal of every single day. I know that when these small business owners go on vacation and I am in town I panic like Americans did with Sputnik!

TAKE COVER AND FIND ANOTHER PIZZA PLACE. No thanks, I&#39;d rather eat tin foil."

I grew up on Giordanos stuffed spinach pizza ...we had one down the street.  Since then  I&#39;ve dabbled with Nancy&#39;s and Jakes stuffed spinach.  I am sure there was an unremarkable UNOs, Ginos and Malnati&#39;s in there somewhere. Really, none of them hold a candle to the stuffed spinach I got last night ...at Gianorios.  Chicagoans say that they hate stuffed pizza, but bring out-of-towners out to experience the treat.  Huh?  Yeah thin crust, flatbread and artisan pizzas are awesome, but nothing can take the place of a stuffed spinach pizza ...it&#39;s the real &#34;pizza pie&#34;

Troubling thing, is that I have driven past this place 2,00 times over the last 15 years, and never gave it a second thought.  Unfortunately, the whole mall has always been run-down looking, hidden behind other stores and has poor signage.  I even did a dry run an hour before pick up, because I was not sure where this place was.

How was I to know the best stuffed pizza ever resides here??

I digress ...

I typically do not write a review after only one visit, but here it is:

Ordered 12&#34; stuffed spinach ...and sorry, I got sausage on it too:

The spinach stood out, and had great flavor
The sausage had that tasty pop of flavor, that you want
The sauce was amazing, truly the benchmark from which all other sauces should be measured
The crust? Crispy where you want, gooey where you want and there was a tasty char on it
Cheese ...well duh whats not to love about cheese?

My pizza was stuffed and I ate it until I was stuffed, with pizza.  No clue what double dough is or how their thin crust measures up to what I am used to ...but I will let you know!

Signed,
Customer for life"

Tonight was my first time trying Gianorio&#39;s Pizza with the fam. We usually head to Rosati&#39;s, Nancy&#39;s, or Lou&#39;s. I am definitely a pizza connoisseur. I&#39;ve had pizza from everywhere...the East Coast, NY, hole in the wall places in Chicago, Uno&#39;s, Nancy&#39;s, Jakes, Giordano&#39;s, everywhere. 

I read the outstanding reviews about this place and we decided to give it a shot. Let me preface this by saying, it takes a lot for me to give a place five stars. I am a pretty harsh critic, particularly when it comes to sizing up the quality of a pie. I&#39;m a pizza skeptic. 

So many things go into my consideration of a good pizza. Crust, sauce, cheese, toppings. Not to mention service and freshness. Gianorio&#39;s Pizza excelled in all these areas. We got a regular (thin crust) pizza with black olives, onions, and green peppers. The crust was a tad thicker than most thin crusts, but absolutely wonderful with just the right density and crunch, baked perfectly. The sauce was savory and tasty, with herbs and spices. The cheese was also sprinkled with herbs and there was plenty of it, cheese, that is. The toppings were plentiful, no scarcity, and the pizza was cooked to perfection and was hot and fresh. 

The service was also great, even though they were super busy. This is one thing I will say some other places in the area lack. They were prompt, efficient, and friendly. No mistakes and the pizza was ready right when they said it would be. 

We will definitely be coming here for our weekend pizza ritual from now on. The pizza is truly heaven on earth, can&#39;t wait to order from here again! I would definitely recommend Gianorio&#39;s Pizza for a fantastic, delicious, suburban pizza experience!"

I called for a carry out order to try them out. Very nice people, very hospitable, and humble, and appreciative of the business. Told them of the bad experience at the other place and they said to let them know what I thought about their pizza. Brought it home and my wife asked if I requested extra sauce and extra cheese.

I&#39;m not a big fan of the crust though, I still prefer Malnati&#39;s crust because it&#39;s buttery and they use corn meal.

And oh, the pizza. It&#39;s wonderful. High quality toppings (we had a 6-topping combo, and a sausage/pineapple/garlic pizza, and a sausage/pepperoni), the sauce is sweet and not too acidic, and the crust is great. Just all around awesome pizza, first place we&#39;ve found that we like better than Gino&#39;s East.

Grew up in the city with Gino&#39;s, Uno&#39;s, Home Run Inn, Giordano&#39;s, etc.  Have had pizza from every little place in the Western Suburbs and this place is hands down the best.

i have had it for several of my parties and now people from 25 miles away come out here to pick up this pizza.  I discovered this place when they first opened in 1988 and I had just moved about a mile away and have been going back ever since.  

In 24 years of pizza, every pizza has been fantastic.  And believe me, that is alot of pizza to get right. 

A couple of weeks ago, had a taste testing party against Al&#39;s Pizza in Warrenville.  Their pizza was really good, but Gianorio&#39;s was the unequivocal winner.

The joint was filled with many older folks who looked like they&#39;d been many times.  The rooms reminded me of an old steak house that had seen it&#39;s heyday in the late sixties - still OK, a bit kitsch, but you can tell at one time it had some swing.

Not sure why you wouldn&#39;t get the poor boy, loaded with garlic butterine.  It&#39;s their specialty, it&#39;s been on television, it&#39;s what everyone recommends.  I can see the novelty  of a sandwich dripping with garlic oil - it likely was very amusing in 1967, but now just lives on in a faded memory of good times.  If you get the platter it comes with an iceberg salad and backed potato.

Be prepared to be called &#34;Hun&#34;, but get the sandwich, and enjoy."

Merichka&#39;s is one of those places. Very few people have lived a lifetime in Joliet and not visited at least once.

However, there are a few of those places that attract people from outside the area. Merchika&#39;s is one of those rare places that though not so convenient, or trendy, still manages to attract and bring people back from far away. 

The older part of the restaurant really helps bring you back to a joint that has been around since the 1930s. The simple table setups something your rarely see anymore and really hits home that this isn&#39;t a corporate chain, or some new take on some old thing by a fancy chef. You can tell this place was started by a few family members making something special in a small kitchen years ago and then sharing it with the rest of the world. 

Since I have moved away from the area I try to stop in about once a year on visits home. While I wouldn&#39;t right a review based on food I ate in the 1980s, I have to be honest, I have not tried anything else but the famed &#34;poor boy&#34; since I moved 20 years ago. Maybe someday I will, but until then, I haven&#39;t grown tired of this butter covered meat treat."

Merichka&#39;s makes me feel like I too can open a restaurant if I just collect enough Papa Johns garlic dipping sauce cups and soak bread and pressed meats in it. Falsely identifying their garlic oil, that my sandwich had apparently drowned in earlier that day, as butter, is a real crime. Second, I haven&#39;t known too many places that have a claim on deep frying packaged onion rings and calling them a specialty but Merichka&#39;s is that bold of a restaurant. As I sat, starring at a mound of fried disappointment and a sandwich that was saturated and leaking, I felt like even the most seasoned trucker would have been defeated.
Unfortunately after all this he left there $50 poorer, with a complimentary tummy ache and a girlfriend still hungry. Never again folks, never again."

Growing up, this was my dad&#39;s favorite place &amp; we visited often.  Many of my siblings now live out of the area, so following New Year&#39;s, we were looking for a place for a large family dinner and settled on Meichka&#39;s.

On the positive, I think the feed is decent. I wouldn&#39;t rate it as amazing.  Nobody is going to drive 30+ miles just to check it out.  But at the same time, if you&#39;re in the area, it&#39;s worth a visit.  Our table had a variety of different foods, including steaks &amp; poor boys.  

I opted for the filet, my mother the ribeye.  Both steaks were cooked as we requested, medium rare.  The meat was good.  Again, it&#39;s not omgamazing, but it&#39;s a good &amp; well-cooked steak.

One interesting note was &#34;wagyu&#34; on the menu.  The last time I had wagyu was in Santa Monica at $60 for 3 ounces.  Here it was $16 for 9oz.  I also noticed on the menu that wagyu was in quotes, so maybe it was wagyu-esque?  Either way, I didn&#39;t take the risk.

The food itself was 3 stars.  I knocked my rating down to 2 stars because service was pretty bad.  We waited north of 45 minutes for someone to finally take our order.  When the food did come, there was a few screwups.  Not surprising given we were a party of 10, but it took a while to get them fixed."

&#34;You have to try the onion rings&#34;. Yeah, they taste like some onion rings I could get from White Castle.

&#34;Best poor boys&#34;. More like overpriced and not flavorful. Unless you like your bun dipped in garlic butter and leaking when it&#39;s on the plate. It was unappealing, but I tried it anyways. Not very good and I wish I hadn&#39;t for my hearts sake. 

Got a double baked potato with my sandwich that was by far the worst double baked potato I have ever had. 

The wife ordered a spicy chicken poor boy. Yeah more of the same. Flavorless and dripping in garlic butter. 

I spent about $50 to feel ashamed for eating here. I could have just drank some garlic butter and punished my heart for cheaper. It would have tasted the same."

I read some of the bad reviews on here and have a few things to say to yuppie fucks.  1. Don&#39;t call it, nor compare it to a Po&#39;boy, you want a crappy Po&#39;boy head down to the bayou.  There is a difference between Po&#39;boys and Poor Boys idiots.  

2. For those that think it is greasy etc.  go back to eating your sushi.  The sandwich is slathered in garlic butter what the fuck do you expect it to be.  The guy from Madison Wi. LOL seriously, your going to critique food, your from Wisconsin hahahaha go eat a block of cheese.

3. Final note your not going to find a better POOR boy around.  Try it with cheese and grilled onions, It is big, juicy, greasy, garlic buttery awesomeness.  The fries are fantastic, and so are the rings.  I have had the steaks and they are perfectly fine, but don&#39;t expect to come here and eat the same type of steak you would find at Mortons or Gibsons, of course on the other hand Merichkas doesn&#39;t charge 50+ dollars for a steak, so why would you expect the same results.  Joliet in my opinion is a extension of the south side, and just like hittin up maxwell street depot, Phils pizza, Vito and Nicks, or Freddies.  This is the place to be.  Enjoy my South Side friends, and to all you bad reviewers of this place, head back to the north side and eat your fuckin kale.  Go Hawks!!!!"

There was an interesting mix of people here including elders in their finest pink pantsuit and pearls, along with some middle aged adults in sweat pants.  The checkerboard tablecloths invite casual ensemble.  

The menu will expand your waistline tenfold.  The onion rings are a must; the small portion will feed more than two adults.

The &#34;plates&#34; come with a salad, a potato, and pickle slices on the side.  I recommend the double baked potato over the fries.

We each ordered a po&#39; boy, one steak and one spicy fried chicken, cut them in half and shared.  The steak was tender and juicy, but underseasoned.  The buttery garlic bread made up for that though.  The spicy fried chicken was extra crispy but also in need of some seasoning.  The po&#39; boy is not traditional New Orleans style; these are sandwiches on French bread, which I suppose you could loosely call a &#34;po&#39; boy.&#34;

I cannot stress enough how much food we ate.  I took the half of my spicy chicken po&#39; boy home and ate it for lunch the next day.  I actually enjoyed it more reheated, since the sandwich absorbed some of the spices from the garlic bread.

The beer list is short but sufficient.  I had a Goose Island Green Line.

Prices are fair, and there is lots of seating.  The older folks and families make up most of the clientele.  Merichka&#39;s would be a cozy spot for a small party.

Our waitress was a total sweetheart.  My husband ordered chili, but as our food started to come out, we realized she forgot about the chili.  After seeing how much food we had, he was fine with that.  At the end of our meal, she delivered the chili to our table with a to-go container, apologized for the mistake, and took the chili off of our bill.  I thought it was an honest, classy move."

As a new resident of the Joliet area, I was instantly recommended to go here. It was terrible. Definitely got a weird vibe when my girlfriend and I were the youngest people in the place by at least 30 years.

I had the spicy chicken poorboy and man was it brutal. Living in the MS/LA area for 4 years, I am very familiar with po boys and what makes them good. This place has no idea. The bread I will admit had good flavor with the garlic butter. That&#39;s about it. The chicken was not very flavorful and extremely hard. The sandwich fell apart in my hands several times because the butter made the bread so flimsy. Not to mention the &#34;poorboy&#34; was literally just bread and chicken, with a few pickles. No other toppings, no sauce or condiments. 

If you want to eat crappy food that costs way too much with Joliet&#39;s senior citizens, have at it. I won&#39;t be returning."

Steak poorboy: seemed like hamburger meat to me. Very greasy, which is fine (hence the garlic butter). But I saw many reviews say &#34;extra&#34; garlic butter. Wow their sandwich must be swimming in the plate. 

Onion rings: definitely home made. But compeltely flavorless. Had to dip/drown in ranch dressing...

Double-baked potato: I thought was very good. Some reviews claimed it was too dry. But what do you expect for double-baked.

Overall, very over-priced as other reviews say. For just my meal, $25 (tip included) was way too much for what I ate....  Won&#39;t be back again :("

There are only 2 good things about Joliet, 1 &#34;Joliet&#34; Jake  and his brother Elwood and 2 Mirichka&#39;s . Well that&#39;s what my dad says . First we ordered the mushroom and onion rings dish for our appetizer.Wow!! It was filling! Then we both ordered there famous poor boy. It had just a perfect amount of garlic butter , perfectly cooked steak and amazingly melted cheese, if you like pickles these are super!!! The poor boy has amazing flavor, and I had never had a poor boy before, and I am glad that I tried it!!! It&#39;s like a hamburger and a slice of garlic bread mixed together!  The dinning area Isn&#39;t  to loud , and there is also a bar area it is your choice!  I think that Mirichka&#39;s is a wonderful place to go eat if you are hungry, and in Joliet.

Finally, I got a chance to try them and they did not disappoint. Very crispy and delightful...probably some of the best onion rings I&#39;ve ever had.

I had also heard of these po&#39;boy sandwiches that they serve with garlic butter. This excited me... However, when I finally had it, I didn&#39;t know what to do with it.. I put the butter on the bread, it tasted OK but was missing something -- so I asked for mayo and some grilled onions, which helped bump things up a notch or 2. But, the sandwich fell short to the onion rings. 

They had weird coleslaw too..it was vinegar based instead of creamy.. I wasn&#39;t a fan. 

This is one of those places that has their regulars who have probably been eating here since the beginning of time. It&#39;s old school and they just do things the way they do em and don&#39;t make any apologies for it. When I asked for a glass of water to go, they seriously only had a tiny styrofoam cup. I asked for a larger to-go cup and she said that was their largest cup. HA..ok weird.. but, I&#39;ll take it.

Service was good and the place had a nice vibe. I&#39;m bummed they only had brown t-shirts left in our size because I love their t-shirts. Oh well, maybe next time. :)"

This place was highly recommended to me by several locals as being the best place for a poorboy sandwich, and just good food overall. The place is sufficiency clean, and the staff curious and helpful, but the food just plain disappointing. The salad would have been good, except there was so much dressing it was a struggle to find the lettuce. The sandwich was mediocre at best. The bun was good, but the beef inside was dry and hideously overcooked and dry, and I assume in an attempt to cover this up, the sandwich was soaked, I mean absolutely drenched in grease. 

I guess if greasy slimy food and copious amounts of dressing are your thing than this is the place for you.  As for me though, I&#39;m underwhelmed."

For me, though, its about nostalgia. When I was a child my parents would bring us to Merichka&#39;s. Most likely because an unruly brood of 6 kids didn&#39;t much disturb the other patrons. Having said that, this joint brings back fond memories for me. So, while I understand that it isn&#39;t the best food, it is special to me.

Its all greasy, butter soaked, garlic infused and wonderful. The house dressing is uber tangy and the house pickles are super tart."

So for anyone who doesn&#39;t understand what the sandwhich is, it is simplu a thin long ground beef patty on garlic bread essentially. The enfatuation the reviewsers have with is not understandable. The meat did not have any flavor at all really though they did use excellent bread and the garlicyness was good. But given the hype one would think there was something more to the sandwhich but there wasn&#39;t which is a shame. The potatoe was also very lack luster along with the sampler items of which some if not all were not made in house. Correct if I am wrong but the mozzarella sticks for example were identical to ones at numerous other location such as Sonic annd the freezer aisle.

Now for some why it has 3 and not 2 stars... the food did seem to have some potential, perhaps the ribeye sandwhich and the staff was great and the building is fun. Come and visit. The place has history and afterall most places deserve a second shot."

Because you&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re at home, spend only a couple of bucks, and have to be rolled out.

Merichka&#39;s is no fine dining and they don&#39;t claim it to be. I haven&#39;t read through the reviews, but my guess is there are some negative reviews about the greasy food. If you&#39;re coming to Merichka&#39;s - guess what?! - it&#39;s going to be greasy. So go or don&#39;t go, but know there will be grease. You&#39;ve been warned.

And when you go, do yourself a favor and don&#39;t go against the grain: get the steak po&#39;boy. Extra garlic sauce on the side, with a twice baked potato. Oh - and try some of the onion rings.

The garlic sauce is a greasy garlic mess of caloric deliciousness. The twice baked potato is as big as your head. And for somewhere under $10, you&#39;ll have enough onion rings to feed a small army. 

But the sandwich! Oh the sandwich. My mouth waters thinking about it. The cubed steak is tender like butter (or roasted garlic, in this case) and the pickles are the perfect addition to the taste. If you eat all of it, you may have a problem. So in the case that you do have leftovers, pop them in the broiler and it&#39;ll reheat just fine.

And remember: this is a diner. It&#39;s a fun, low-key place with below average service - don&#39;t let it ruin the experience. Be prepared to wait on weekends!"

When I was a child I thought Merichkas was at the center of the culinary universe.  I&#39;ve grown. 

My family went there after a funeral.  50 of us. The bar service downstairs was prompt.  This was the highlight.

Orders were taken upstairs.   Our salads arrived and it was lackluster.  Just iceberg with some red onion and 4 croutons.  No spring mix...no romaine added to the mix...no spinach.  No added color...perhaps cheese or carrot....tomatoes?   The dressing was home made in their defense.

Everyone at our table ordered a poorboy.  I can&#39;t believe I loved these as a child.  Good quality bread with a beef patty and sautéed mushrooms, onions, and butterine. Maybe my palate has matured.

The twice baked potato lacked salt and pepper and was bland.  Fat needed to be added: sour cream, butter, cheese, anything!

There are no steaks over $30. They even have bone-in cowboy ribeyes and 28oz porterhouse. 

Again, the steak is nothing overly exciting or particularly special, but they cook it well and it has good flavor.

I remember eating at Merichka&#39;s as a child.  My entire family thought of it as a great night out with great food and atmosphere.  I cannot be sure since I was there in the late 70&#39;s early 80&#39;s before last week, but I think the bread has changed.  I loved the bread years ago, and it seemed Jimmy Johnish last week.  Regardless, it was still delicious.  There is a nostalgia factor for those of us who dined there as a kid.  My southern Illinois wife loved it last week, and so did I.

I sometimes go in thinking I&#39;ll try something else but the garlic seeping throughout the restaurant makes me go back to the old standard.

Like potica, if you&#39;re not from Joliet, you&#39;ll never have the true appreciation for it.  For those of us local, it&#39;s not just food.  Merichka&#39;s is the place you go after a funeral.  It&#39;s the place you go after a first communion.  It&#39;s where the high school newspaper team went for our year-end dinner.  Merichka&#39;s isn&#39;t about the food as much as it&#39;s about the reason you&#39;re there.

The food is great...a piece of chopped steak over-saturated with garlic butter served in a bun that&#39;s also soaked in garlic butter.  Then there&#39;s the pickle and olive tray, the onion rings and salad.  These are all items I can still taste in my mouth and I haven&#39;t been there in years.

Everyone from Joliet has been to Merichka&#39;s and Al&#39;s in the same weekend (possibly Aurelios / Cemino&#39;s too).  It&#39;s not just a place to love for the food alone, but for the big family parties there.  Being a kid and chasing your cousins around the table.  Being an adult now, Merichka&#39;s is the post-funeral meal (Al&#39;s is the post-wake Dinner). I went there after burying my grandma (who was friends with Merichka), my aunt and my father (who used to work there when he was a young man). There&#39;s something very comforting about knowing that it&#39;ll be there.  It&#39;s a stable constant in this world.

So, for everyone who goes there for the first time expecting a life changing meal, you&#39;re going to be disappointed. It doesn&#39;t taste like childhood to you.  You don&#39;t remember being there as a little kid in your Sunday best.  You don&#39;t remember how the pickles taste exactly the same 30 years later, or how the walls feel like home. You&#39;re going there expecting something that can no way be delivered this late in your life. It doesn&#39;t remind you of your grandma.

Much like potica, Merichka&#39;s just tastes awesome if you&#39;re from Joliet. If you&#39;re not, then go ahead and give it a try buy manage your expectations."

Come on...it&#39;s a Poor Boy (po boy) however you want to say it. It&#39;s a cheap piece of meat on a bun with garlic butter and cheese for TEN BUCKS! Plus over $5 more if you want to add a salad and fries. I can get a much better meal elsewhere for over fifteen bucks than basically a fast food place. If someone put the plate in front of me and asked what I would pay I would say about 8-10 at most.

From what I was told, after I entered the world, my mother&#39;s roommate&#39;s family brought in bags of poorboy sandwiches from Merichka&#39;s.  These days, the poorboy sandwich is still delicious(although smaller than I remember) as is the  house dressing.

One seated (kind of reminds you of your mom&#39;s place - big tables!), we got our order in quickly. We started with a small order of onion rings, which were supposed to be for 2 or 3 people, and were more like for 4 or 5 people.  Unless you are big eaters, you&#39;ll leave some behind.  The onion rings were very good.

I ordered their 10 ounce filet, and my wife went with their poor boy, which was so big, she had to take around half home.

Dinner comes with a relish tray and salad, and both were fresh and tasty.

We had a good time.  The ambiance is a little (okay, a lot) dated.  It could use an update, but the food is fine, and the price won&#39;t break the bank.

No free WIFI if you need that."

You get what you pay for here, nothing more and nothing less. The atmosphere is very old and they&#39;ve only recently made updates to some aspects of the restaurant.

I usually get the Yodel Burger (comes with cheese) which is like a Poorboy but with hamburger meat. It is very greasy, as is anything you order here. I also usually get a house salad with ranch dressing which is pretty good. Salads come with the cracker basket which is my favorite part!

Most of the servers are older. Our waitress this past Monday had a little attitude, but nothing too bad.

As long as you know it&#39;s a local, small business and aren&#39;t expecting TOO much this is a fun place to go once in awhile."

We gladly make the drive out from the Chicago area to indulge in those giant onion rings and p-boy sandwiches. The best part of this place for me is that they aren&#39;t trying to be something they&#39;re not. The interior is dated and simple and the food is a throwback to a time when transfats, carbs and high fructose corn syrup were not dirty words. So if you&#39;re into healthy eating and you&#39;re a gluten-free, organic vegan you might find yourself in hell here at Merichka&#39;s. With that being said, I&#39;m a &#34;healthy eater&#34; and I make exceptions for places like this.

Not a Po-Boy that you&#39;d find in Louisiana, but a totally different creature, one I found that you could duplicate, but never replicate. It&#39;s a sandwich of Mona Lisa beauty, but Jennifer Lopez taste. The perfect sandwich, where you say to yourself &#34;I&#39;ll cut in half I swear&#34; of course this never happens.

The Poorboy consists of a soft hockey bun, a tender slab of steak, onions cheese and melted butter, butter, butter. Some how it works, and works to a tee!

It has been a long time since I had been to Merichkas and I had a craving for a poorboy. The sandwich by itself is 8 bucks and with fries takes it to 12!? 4 dollars for fries is a bit much. Fries are cheap people!
            One thing that was lacking from my meal is salt. The fries had no salt or seasoning whatsoever. Very expensive and bland fries. I did however enjoy the combination of pickles with the fries. I totally felt like a pregnant chick eating that but it was kinda good. 
      As for my poorboy- it was good, but not like everyone makes it out to be. The meat itself has really no flavor to it. It&#39;s the garlic bread and the pickles that made the poorboy taste better than what it was. Eating my poorboy brought back old memories of when I ate there before. The food was just average then and still is today.  Old people love this place.
            Will I eat at Merichkas again? Yes. It wasn&#39;t bad, but I don&#39;t get all the raving over bland food. I think it&#39;s the old time atmosphere and nostalgic childhood memories that people love about this place but the food simply isn&#39;t all that. #SorryBoutIt #GurlBye"

Other than that, I really can&#39;t recommend the restaurant so I gave it 3 stars.  Not sure if you can give more than that to a restaurant with only one dish.

It&#39;s like the song &#34;All Right now&#34; - great song but can you rate Free as a great band.  Paul Rogers didn&#39;t think so, different story with Bad Company.

Shrimp cocktail and mushroom appetizers were good. Side salads were browning and had huge dollops of dressing forcing you to dig through sludge to get to the salad. My buddy had the pork chop, which looked good, and he confirmed it was a good dish. I had the New York Strip with 3 shrimp. The steak was tasty but the shrimp were caked in hard, bland breading. I joked with the table that I nearly broke my teeth biting into the breading. That was an exaggeration of course, but they were unusually hard. The twice baked potato was cold, and I also got bread and onion rings that I didn&#39;t taste (huge portion). My girlfriend got a filet that was overcooked. The second try was much better, but unfortunately took an additional 15 minutes and the rest of the table was finished.

I asked the waitress to describe the different breads, bun vs garlic bread and which she suggested.  She looked at me like I had three heads.  I chose the spicy fried poorboy plate.  I asked for ranch dressing on my salad, and she had me repeat myself because she thought I said merishka dressing, they don&#39;t even sound alike.  When the salad came it was swimming in dressing.  I asked her the difference between the 3 types of fries they offered, and that seemed to annoy her as well.  When she dropped the food off, I asked for ketchup and she forgot to bring it.  My sandwich was not spicy at all.  She never came back to ask how the food tasted, so I wasn&#39;t able to get my sandwich fixed.  She instead just dropped off take out boxes and the check without ever checking in.  I told her that my sandwich was not spicy but I ate half anyway because I couldn&#39;t find her to let her know it was wrong.  She looked at me again as though I was an alien and didn&#39;t even apologize.  $40 for 2 people to eat crappy food was not what we had in mind for a birthday lunch."

It&#39;s a little fancy inside, but welcoming, and I was seated quickly.  Service was great start to finish.  The menu is expansive and I was partly familiar, but the waiter stepped in with some good suggestions.  I ignored them, it turned out, but I have a feeling everything here is good.  Food came out fast.  I got the crispy binagoongan, fried pork belly with veggies.  It was a platter big enough for two, but I made a valiant effort.  The meat was perfectly cooked, and the veggies and rice (I added a side of plain) blended to make an amazing meal.  Shrimp paste, eggplant, tomatoes, onions... Just amazing flavor and textures.

Prices are very good for the quantity and quality.  There is so much on the menu I want to try.  If we are back up this way I will make more of a dent."

We ordered Lechon Kawali, Chicken Adobo, Seafood Karekare, Bowl of Garloc Fried Rice, and Halo halo. All were good and tasty. Unfortunately the fish paste for the Seafood Karekare was not within our like of sight and hidden behind the huge bowl of Karekare so we ate without it; I wished we would&#39;ve known as I don&#39;t normally eat this dish. It was bland and my friend agreed given to what was mentioned, we wished it was on plain sight. Lechon Kawali was great and crunchy, though the sauce was the generic liver sauce (Mang Tomas) nothing special there.

The server was great and suggested some for us and we tried it, such as ordering a bowl of rice instead of 3 cups of rice. Thank you for that. But once we ate, we were only checked one time and we had to get the attention of other servers so we can ask for something. Observing the servers, there was a lot of talking amongst themselves and that could be one reason why we weren&#39;t paid good attention, also it would be appreciated if all of them smiled and not look that they were having a bad day or just had a poker face. Our main server was great though he smiled genuinely and had good mannerism. What&#39;s good was after we got their attention, our request was granted in a timely manner, it wasn&#39;t a hectic day I might add."

I&#39;d give this place a 2.5 only because the food was great but the service was really bad.. 
Maybe it was the time that we got here (around 2:30 on a Sunday) but the service was just... bad. First off, there was a really disorganized line - only one line for both those waiting to be seated AND for to go orders. Everyone was hovering the front desk and customers were all over the place.   As I waited in line, I noticed waiters on the side talking rather than cleaning up tables  for other customers to be seated. 
Anyways, they finally called our names and we were seated an hour later. They took our order (hototai soup, crispy pata, pancit Bihon, okoy, Kare kare, and 3 desserts - halo halo, Taho, and buko pandan - &amp; like I said we came from Chicago so we wanted to try a lot of food and take whatever left home). We got our food in decent time and everything was fresh and hot (which is why I&#39;d give this a 4/5 if only rating the quality of the food)..
BUT.... Honestly there was a lot of hair on the crispy pata - not appealing at all. And the pancit came last and we were basically done with all our main dishes by the time it came out (we thought they&#39;d forgotten about the order). But whatever, it was good. 

SO THEN they eventually gave us the check.. YET it turned out to be someone else&#39;s check smh (theirs was like 90 and ours was supposed to be around 60) so we complained and they finally came back with our check. We paid, blah blah. BUT WHERES OUR DESSERTS? A bus boy kept hovering our table like wondering why we aren&#39;t leaving and we finally told him that we&#39;ve been waiting for our 3 desserts for the past 10 minutes after we returned our check. So they finally give us the halo halo and Taho and they apologize for the wait and thank us.. BUT WHERES THE BUKO PANDAN? So they finally give us that after like 5 minutes... Smh everything was just going badly service wise. 


Other than the terrible service the food was pretty good especially because it&#39;s rare to find a Filipino restaurant that doesn&#39;t have oil overpowering the food. Also, the quality and quantity of the food was fair for the price. The food is the reason I gave this place a 2 (a 2.5 if I could) but the service was too bad for me to give it any more."

I&#39;ll admit it- I tend to be skeptical about Filipino restaurants because my mom caters Filipino food and I haven&#39;t found a place that is up to par with her cooking until Hong Ning. I recommend! My mom does too!

We usually visit on Sunday afternoons. There is always a bit of a wait, but we just walk over to the nearby Starbucks to kill time (the waiting area is not that big). From my experience, the wait never went over 30 minutes for a group of 4. Most of the guests come in families. 

The decor is nice, but the floor is a bit slippery-- not sure why. The tables are small, especially since the food comes in large plates/platters so the table gets a bit crowded once the food comes. I can tell that this place is a bit understaffed, but service was still pretty good on all occasions we&#39;ve been there. All servers are helpful, despite how much they are running back and forth from the kitchen to the dining area. 

We always order the sinigang, crispy pata, and the inihaw fiesta. The entrees are meant to be shared, so the portions are a bit large for 2 people. 

Sinigang: Yum! Served at a nice, hot temperature and is very sour-- which is how I like my sinigang. It could&#39;ve had more meat and veggies, but it is still very good. 

Crispy Pata: We order a large for a group of 4 of us. Very crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. They got the dipping sauce right, too. 

Inihaw Fiesta: Beautiful presentation, it&#39;s served on a platter with banana leaves (love!). It comes with muscles, calamari, tilapia, barbecue chicken skewers, chargrilled pork belly, dipping sauce, and bagoong. This is perfect for a larger group. Definitely my favorite on the menu. 

Overall: I very much recommend! Honestly, Hong Ning is the ONLY Filipino restaurant in the Chicago-land area that my family and I regularly visit. Haven&#39;t found another restaurant that we like enough to make a second/third visits to except this place!"

I really like Filipino food because it reminds me of the friends.i made in college. However, the restaurant didn&#39;t have a lot on their lunch special. I ordered off the main menu and I think the food was a little costly. Also, for lunch, this was not a good option. We had an hour to eat but the check took a while. The food I got was good, but not a huge favorite. I think if you want authentic meats like tripe, oxtail and jackfruit, come here. They have a lot of those options."

They seem blasé and unfocused. Upon seating, our party of 5 was given as carafe of ice water... with no glasses. I asked waiter #1 for cups. He said yes, then proceeded to do other various tasks. 5 min later I ask waiter #2 for cups. She says yes.. then a couple min later, waiter #3 arrives with our cups. But in all that time no one asked if we were ready to order. We finally order (15 min after being seated), and the food arrives very quickly. The amount of stars I&#39;ve given are based on the food alone. I&#39;ve never had any bad food here. Maybe the negative food reviews are on their off days?

So we finish what we can but of course have leftovers. I went through the same amount of almost begging for to go containers as well as the check. When asking for the containers the 2nd time, I also asked for our 2 halo halo to go, since at that point I just wanted to get out of there. It took almost 30 minutes from the time I asked for the check the 1st time to the time I could finally leave. 

I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve done something to offend the waitstaff but it definitely felt that way. I&#39;ll definitely be back, but never again to stay and dine in. I hope they improve their ideals of what it means to be customer-oriented. You don&#39;t have to love your job to deal with the public, you just have to know how to make the customers believe you do. ;)"

The interior is really nice. Enough to take guests when they come or for a fancier outing consisting of Filipino deliciousness. 

First time the service was A+, but the second day it was so slow...they also forgot to give us rice as our entrees were coming out and one of our dishes came out as we finished our food. We ended up sending it back because it was too late. But everything we ate was delicious, so I am less bitter.

Fact 2: despite being proud of the awesomely diverse culture, just about every Pinoy/Pinay dining at a Filipino restaurant secretly expects the food coming out of the kitchen to taste EXACTLY like mom&#39;s, lola&#39;s or tita&#39;s.

Fact 3. Ain&#39;t no way a Pinoy/Pinay that is dining w mom, lola or tita will admit that the restaurant food is better. That would be suicide.

Given these undisputed facts, it is a testament of quality to Hong Ning that they&#39;ve been able to thrive for almost 2 decades from its original humble store front in Glendale Heights to its current locale in an area that has a large Filipino community full of home cooks that think they&#39;re the latest incarnation of Iron Chef Pilipinas. Hong Ning has stood the test of time bc it&#39;s good Filipino food period. If you don&#39;t like the food here, you might just not appreciate Filipino food. Yet. Give it a few tries before you give up bc sometimes people need some adjusting to unfamiliar flavors.

Anyhow, if you haven&#39;t tried Filipino food, this is a great place to start. The food here is better than some nationally recognized Filipino spots I&#39;ve been to around the country. Entrees are inexpensive and I suggest coming with a group of at least 4+ so you can try a lot of things (BBQ!). The service I&#39;ve had here has been above average especially for an Asian restaurant (no shade thrown... You know what I mean!) and especially since the last time I was here it was with a rowdy group of 20+ picky ass eaters who ditched their moms, lolas and titas bc they didn&#39;t want to hide the fact that they were really enjoying the food. A lot."

We ordered the calamari (skip it - huge rubbery rings of seafood), lechon roll (lots of fat, but the meat and skin were crispy and tasty), kare-kare (plenty of beef cubes, but I prefer it with more oxtail and more sauce), a pancit (a bit salty), a grilled chicken, halo halo (yum!), and a pandan sundae (very good!).

We tried to call for a reservation, but were told it was strictly first come - first served.  Luckily, we were seated right away.  When we left, there was a line out the door!  Go early or go on a weekday!"

Ever since they moved to this Carol Stream location they upgraded the entire dining experience. Not only is the food still delicious with generous servings and nicely presented, but the staff is younger and friendly. The Filipino decor on the east wall is tastefully done, and you can learn about Philippine history and culture by taking a close look. Good quality tables and chairs are not usual at Asian restaurants, so I am glad they invested in them. But my #1 pet peeve with Asian restaurants is the typical filthy, icky restrooms and the hallways that lead to them. Hong Ning has now broken ranks from that low standard and have installed presentable, decorated restrooms that are clean! May they keep it up!"

This is one of the better filipino restaurants that serves really well cooked filipino food. The crispy lupia is cooked to perfection. Perfect crunch with a meaty inside. I recommend to skip the calamare. It used to be fried squid, but now its the rubbery squid rings that you can get a a grocery store. The chicken inasal with java rice dish is one of my favorite dish. It comes with about 4 chicken medium sized chicken breast grilled well. Inside is moist and tender. My family likes to get the Crispy pata, which is roasted pork hock. Skin is crunchy and there is a lot of fat, but the meat is tender. 
This place gets pretty busy, so if you come with a party make sure you have everyone with you, or they won&#39;t sit you. Service wise, kind of typical of any asian place, you usually have to flag down a server and they tend to be inattentive and slow. Don;t worry if its not the one that initially served you.

I decided on something rather simple that both my little sons would be happy with. We ordered the shanghai egg rolls, BBQ pork skewers and an order of chicken inasal. The chicken in particular was very good. My boys were happy and couldn&#39;t get enough of their baby egg rolls. My 4yr old (the particular one ) asked me about 4 times if we were going to be able to bring the egg rolls home... so that means they were a hit, lol. He was not excited to eat there on the way to dinner but made sure to ask me on our car ride home if we could go back sometime. We&#39;ll be back and I&#39;m excited to try something else soon.

The decor is very nice the tables and lighting are unique. When we got in the place is packed and busy with filipino athmosphere.. We were seated right away after they cleaned a table for us. 

The menu was very simple and right on the spot your classic filipino dishes. We started with appetizer of fried calamri and for entree the sizzling sisig and grilled pork belly. The service was fast, food came in quickly.. 

The food is very flavorful and everything we like. The only negative was they charge for the rice.

For dessert we ordered the halo halo. And it was plentiful for the price me and fiancee had hard time tackling it. 

Overall our 1hr trip was all worth the drive. They set the standards high for all filipino restaurants. Filipino restaurant in the orland park area are pretty mediocre.

I feel obligated to detail our lunch, and our experience which is not (at least as of this date) reflected in the restaurant&#39;s current rating.  Lunch - crazy good.  We had a garlic rice, which I must learn how to recreate, as it was insanely good.  I did the adobo chicken and my lunch partner/nephew did a fried pork belly dish with shrimp paste.  Holy cow, it was all so good.  Service was splendid.  I have tried to come here twice before but the line/wait was too long and I gave up.

If you&#39;ve never had Filipino food it may be best to stick to the skewers and rice which by the way taste just as good as the skewers you can by on the street in Manila  or Makati.

And it is also my first time having Filipino food, and I was so disappointed. 

I&#39;ve never been to the old location, but this one is spacious and the decor is interesting. When you first walk in, it smells delicious and you can&#39;t wait to sit down and order.

I had ordered a kare kare. It is a braised oxtail and tripe in a &#34;peanut sauce.&#34; First off, there were no &#34;peanut&#34; present in the sauce whatsoever. like none. The tripe were big pieces and uncut, so it is a little chewy to bite. They were also not cleaned well, therefore  it gave off a fishy smell. The oxtail were okay, the meat fell right off the bone so it was easy to eat. Overall, the dish was very bland and under flavored. It looked like a curry, and I was hoping it would taste like the sort..but it didn&#39;t.

My boyfriend got the pritong  tilapia, basically it is just a WHOLE tilapia deep fried. They also served it with their &#34;house spiced vinegar.&#34; The fish... was fishy. Because it was not rubbed in any spice or flavoring, the fish was very fishy. Their sauce seemed like it was just soy sauce mixed with vinegar because there were no &#34;spice&#34; to it. 

Our meal was served with rice and some sort of fish or shrimp paste. I have eaten my fair share of fish and shrimp paste. I mean, Vietnamese people know how to ferment their shit man. I digress, anyways...the smell of that paste was so pungent. The taste was delicious to the bland meal, but I could not get over that smell. I did not find it very pleasant. 

I am also wary at the fact that they CHARGED me for rice, like really? RICE for crying out loud. 

I was not impressed with this place, seeing how many of my Filipino friends boasted about this place and how salty Filipino food can be and how EVERYTHING was delicious. smh."

Food: We came for lunch on a weekday to avoid the weekend crowd. We ordered pretty much the main traditional dishes: crispy pata, beef soup, pata tim, fried rice, halo-halo, kare-Kare, pinaputok na bangus.  The servings were satisfactory. But overall, the food lacks flavor, the meats could be more tender, and needs more time for flavor to set in. The pata tim was one of my greater disappointments -- the hocks tasted gamey, and wasn&#39;t cleaned/shaved well of pig&#39;s  hair. Kare Kare was tough, and lacks the usual creamy flavor of the dish. Fried rice was ... A little on the hard side.  The owner was around talking to a few patrons, said Hi to us at the beginning but never came around again. If he had taken the time to ask us about the food, we would have told him."

I don&#39;t write many Yelp Reviews unless it&#39;s the best thing or the worst thing I ever ate OR unless it really pissed me off...LOL...If you like salty very salty Filipino food and lack of service this is the place to be. I ordered the &#34;sizzling pusit&#34; and there was nothing sizzling about it literally... It was cold and it was NOT cleaned properly it&#39;s was sandy and I had a plastic cartilage that needed to be taken out!  

We&#39;re not the only one that noticed the salt,the family behind us said the same thing about the food they ordered which solidify my findings.

Then the Caldereta came short rib style and the meat was not tender... It needed about 30 more minutes in the pressure cooker! Caldereta needs a little more spice! The only saving grace to my first experience here was the Lechon Roll that&#39;s it. I hate that they charge for white rice! Even the Chinese people don&#39;t do that no offense... But it&#39;s true! 

If you want authentic Filipino food try Sarilin Atin in Des Plaines! It&#39;s a small hole in a wall place but their weekend buffet is grand slam I can&#39;t say anything bad about them.  Again it&#39;s a really small place but it&#39;s a hidden gem..I just wish I lived closer to Des Plaines so I can go there everyday. 

In conclusion if you want to pay extra for rice, lack of customer service, and an insane amount of salt then Hong NiNg is the place to be... Sorry Yelpers I must have missed the memo on this one..."

Either we went on an extraordinary night, or those who didn&#39;t like this place have never eaten at a &#34;real&#34; Filipino restaurant.  Most of the bad reviews spoke of bad service or finding hairs on food.  Granted, we weren&#39;t cowtowed to in Hong Ning as we&#39;ve been in snootier places that we enjoyed half as much, but I had no service complaints and the food was fantastic.

Which is another thing: many reviewers weren&#39;t impressed with the food.  Again, maybe we went on a night where the best chef from the Philippines was substituting for the regular guy... but somehow I doubt it.  My guess is that either Chicagoans are pampered by the only really great Filipino restaurants in America and are therefore spoiled, or they don&#39;t know Filipino food at all.

I have eaten at many a Pinoy restaurant, both here in LA and in various locations in the Philippines, and the only place in which I have eaten that comes close to the wonderful food I had on Luzon and Palawan was right here at Hong Ning.  Now the review.

I was in the mood for pork in a big way, and with Pilipino food that almost always means fatty pork belly.  We had the liempo, the crispy pata, lechon and sisig to satisfy that urge (and then some); in addition we sampled the pancit and chicken inasal.  Everything was delicious.  The pata was divinely crispy but not crunchy; the liempo was tangy, saucy and tasty; the lechon had thin, crisp, succulent skin and tender yet juicy meat with appropriately light seasoning and the sisig was the best I&#39;ve had outside of the Philippines, even if it wasn&#39;t made from a pig&#39;s head (as is traditional and fantastic, for my likewise ignorant American friends).  The pancit bihon was just fine (I&#39;ve had better, but that was in Tayabas) and the chicken inasal was unexpectedly tasty: delicate seasoning so as not to overwhelm the flavor of the chicken, and the single large breast we received was unusually juicy and tender for grilled chicken.  I couldn&#39;t do better myself--and I&#39;m a damn good cook!

This is a good place for Whities like me to introduce themselves to Pinoy foods (a thing I strongly recommend for those planning on visiting the Philippines, or those who just love good food and to say hell with the calories), mainly because everyone working here speaks English.  If you expect 5-star service, go to some snobbish French bistro for inferior food and the ass kissing you require.  Regular folks will like it here just fine."

And after I asked for lumpia, the server was like eggrolls?!?! Seriously it was like a lumpia hot dog  The inside of the lumpia was like they took all the ingredients, pureed them and then stuffed them back into the lumpia rolls then cut them into two inch pieces.  Now I know lumpia.  I am Filipino. I make my own lumpia at home.  This was SO disappointing because the place itself was really nice on the inside, had a nice crowd of people.

Totally wrong idea. We got in about 12:15 and got seated.  Realized lunch menu was not given to us, so we asked our server to bring.  He was extremely slow - took more than 5 minutes to bring the menu itself.  Ordered two of the lunch menu and then we were told that one of them was ALREADY out of it.  It was only 15-20 minutes past from noon, plus, the seats were not full at all.  We had no choice but ordered two of the same lunch menu.  Then only 1 of 2 came.  We waited another 10 minutes or so, and finally they brought another one. It took eventually about 45 minutes for us to start eating together, and we of course were running out of time.  We had a couple of bites then had to leave.  Some parties of 4-5 people were served fully before us although they came in later than us. The lunch menu - pork was good but no vegetable in it, just pork and garlic rice.  It was not really special anyway, or I have to say, their poor customer service really made everything screwed up.

About an hour into my wait they finally told me they didn&#39;t have some of my order so I had yo wait longer. I didn&#39;t go back for a while because I thought they needed time to adjust to a new building and I assumed they would&#39;ve fix this problem.

I showed up 20 minutes later and after 10 minutes of waiting for them to finally acknowledge me at the front door they let me know that they hadn&#39;t started the order yet.

This place has the best kugelis I&#39;ve eaten since my grandma died. Well, I&#39;ve made a pretty decent batch myself once or twice, but this place still does it better, and more authentic I would imagine too.

We tried koldunai, kugelis and cepelinai. The latter which I would not recommend unless you&#39;ve had it before. I kind of hate them, but most Lithuanians do not feel the same way. I&#39;m broken, I guess. I think they&#39;re gluey and tasteless.

Why are their dishes so filling? Because most of their dishes are made with grated potatoes and sort of dehydrated, then PACKED. Now that&#39;s a lot of potato.

It is a nice little nook, I have come here on occasion after biking at Waterfall Glen in the summer or when I need a change of scenery while studying.
It is a nice, quiet environment with a beautiful color scheme. The place is never very full so it is a nice, relaxing atmosphere. There is also a really nice outside sitting area for warmer weather.

The service I have had has always been fantastic. I have always had the same tall, dark-haired.

The coffee is good. Nothing breath-taking, in my opinion, but I would choose this over Starbucks any day of the week!

I have only ever had the crepes, meat and fruit, when I have come here. I wasn&#39;t too impressed with the fruit ones, the fruit never seemed so fresh, but the plate was decorated so nicely. I like the meat ones though, but perhaps that is my German coming out! 
I am more used to the French-style of crepes, thinner and crispier than the crepes at Ruta, so it is an interesting texture and heartier.

The only thing that could really be improved upon is the menu. Yes, I do like that is in English and Lithuanian; but it is not descriptive at all.
For example, with the meat crepes I was taking a bit of a gamble. There was no description of what kind of meat, spices, flavor, etc. So luckily it turned out well!"

The Chicken Coop is a no-frills take-out place with a diverse menu of chicken, fish, and gyro options. I decided to try to catfish sandwich (despite not liking catfish - I have no idea why I decided to try it) and got my wife an Gyro.

The catfish sandwich was tasty and I would definitely order it again in the future. The fry of the fish was perfect, the lettuce, tomato, and onions were all very obviously fresh, and the tzatziki sauce I asked for on the side was an awesome complement to it. I was pleasantly surprised.

My wife had me try a piece of meat from her gyro and it was fantastic. Having lived in Buffalo, NY and personally believing that Buffalo has some of the best foods available in the United States, this gyro was good enough for me to call it &#34;Buffalo-good.&#34;

It&#39;s a little pricier than I expected but I will definitely be returning. Next time I&#39;ll try the wings and maybe a different kind of fish. My wife? She&#39;ll be getting a gyro, I&#39;m sure. It was just that amazing."

I expected to find a roach-palace, but the interior is very clean, and actually inviting once you get inside. the Menu is a little bewildering at first, but give it a second and you&#39;ll make sense out of it. It&#39;s a classic Chicago take-out joint! (nowhere to sit and eat inside at all)
Mostly fried everything. And they do it well. REALLY well!
I&#39;ve had a bunch of the menu, and everything had that GOOD fresh fried flavor. This guy takes pride. Have NOT had any of the non-fried stuff like the Hotdog or Burger, so I can&#39;t comment on those. I don&#39;t think those are the things you come to this joint for. But based on the rest of the menu, I&#39;ll bet the remainder of stuff this guy serves will be fine.
DO look for the special combo handwritten in the ordering area-you can get three or four entree items with Fries for a decent price. Some chicken, Some fish and some shrimp (among other items) A great little sampler. And they have Livers and Gizzards! You can see right into the kitchen. Gotta love it when nothing is hidden at all!
The plates are bursting with food, and the only hassle I&#39;ve had coming here was the Foam Clamshells popping open in the bag on the way home &#39;cos there was too much food stuffed in them! Such a Problem!!
Everything is made a la minute, so you&#39;re going to have a little wait after you order. That wait is worth it."

The fries had no salt and the pizza puffs were also burnt. I asked him to remake the food and he said no because there was nothing wrong with the food. He refused to give me my money back and called the police on me. The guy was so rude and racist lied to the police saying my husband was threatening him. I don&#39;t know how he stays in business.

The restaurant is basically a family diner with lots of Snow White and dwarf themed paintings and nick-knacks. Fun, but not leaving a great impression like a theme park.

The food and service were solid. I tried a chili taco salad (not sure why, just struck me as fun) and it was pretty standard in flavor, though a very generous portion. I had a side of dumpling soup, which was OK. Fun dumplings, and decent flavor, served piping hot. The bread left in the middle of the table, however, had already been out quite a while with the bread very dried out. Not too appetizing.

Service was prompt for a business lunch, and very friendly. The owner checked on us (Sam?) and our busboy was always making sure we were attended to with water refills and empty plate removal.

It seems the service and food can be hit and miss by the reviews, but our experience today was genuinely solid."

I like a good diner now and again. Sometimes they&#39;re not all they&#39;re cracked up to be though! We stopped into 7 Dwarfs for lunch one day not sure what to expect...

We ordered a bowl of Chicken Noodle soup to start. The noodles were way mushy! It was pretty salty too! 

For lunch I had the Ruben with Mashed Potatoes on the side. The ruben was ok though the bread was a little greasy. The potatoes were weird though. Very gelatinous!

The boy ordered a Patty Melt with Fries. He prefers his burgers medium rare. This thing came out well done if not more! It was way over done! 

The place is really run down and the service is pretty slow. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place at all."

Ive driven past here for years and always wanted to try it so today i finally did......

I should have ran after i walked in and noticed the lack of care to the interior but it was too late, i was seated rather quickly. 

I sat down and looked at the menu, placed my order and waited. While waiting i noticed the drop ceiling tiles were black with years of dust, one of the creams was opened and leaked all over the other creamers at our table. 

When our food arrived our server brought us syrup and  butter for our toast and pancakes, our toast and pancakes didnt come out, our server said they&#39;d be brought out to us shortly. Our ham was salty and our hasbrowns were mushy ughhhh. My water that was brought to me was dirty, the rim had orange stuff on it yuuuck. After i finished eating my food i noticed a weird little black thing on my plate. I was having a hard time determining if that was char off the grill or mouse poop...when the server came and FINALLY  brought us our toast and pankcakes (by this point we pretty much finished eating) my boyfriend noticed the same black thing baked into his pancakes. ...im leaning towards the idea that that was mouse poop in our food. 

Heres the icing on the cake ... my boyfriend went to pay, he hands his credit card to the man, who i think is the owner. The owner swipes the credit card and then throws the card back at my boyfriend. I will NEVER ever set foot in here again. Terrible food, dirty, and poor service."

So my girlfriend and I went to this restaurant and they are behind the times here. There is a 12.00 dollar groupon for 20.00 value. I bought this groupon since it was close to my girlfriends hospital where we were at plus I like to explore new and cool things.

There is lot of confusion between and management and groupon. Plus they don&#39;t use digital cash registers and very old school. They tried charging me the 12.00 that I already paid for and I had to explain to them that I already paid the 12.00 on Groupon. What they taught was that since my bill was 21 dollars they subtract whatever it was down to 12 dollars meaning my bill would be 9.00. But my bill would of been 1.00. The lady was Eastern European and her English was not the best so it was difficult explaining it to her. She was a VERY NICE lady though! We finally got it resolved at the end. My recommendation...if you get a groupon for this please contact the restaurant first. I don&#39;t the think the restaurant are eye to eye with groupon.

This place was not very Disney like many would think after first hearing this. There are paintings of the dwarfs and Snow White. But it&#39;s not like you are entering Walt Disney World or something.

4 stars for great service though minus the groupon situation which I don&#39;t think is their fault. The food was good. I had the fried perch and Mac and cheese with salad. It was a Friday special I think for 8.99. Very clean restaurant.

It&#39;s just a standard out of date mom and pop diner. The wow factor was not there like U Gazdy in Woodale and Toots for Train in Bartlett. But for last second good meals in the immediate area then it&#39;s a must."

We were hungry so left to find something to eat nearby. It has a typical diner style, but the lack of people and clientele was a weird group. It felt as if we were in a deserted ghost town where everything/everyone is bleak. 

I got a soup and salad. The salad was very sad....it was pretty much all lettuce with no veggies at all! The soup was a bit too thick for me. Our server was very cold, she wasn&#39;t friendly nor mean. Not welcoming at all. Other tables got a bread basket and on the menu it said if you order soup, you should get a bread basket, but we didn&#39;t. Maybe I read it wrong though....

However, the older lady, who is the owner who checked us out was friendly to us. 

Overall, just a weird experience to say the least...."

This is truly like the old fashion Greek diner.  Expect a book for a menu with so many choices, you need several few minutes to get through it all.

One item that I thought which I did not care for was the different service between the waitresses.  Ours an older lady was ok, but the younger two, oh this is going to sound petty.  Both of us order a dinner, which came with the soup.  Awesome!  She said it was a cup, but when we got it, it was a bowl.  Now the other two waitresses I noticed were giving their clients a bread bowl, for breakfast food, sandwich, basically anything.  We did not get that.  When asked she never came back with one.  Granted with all of the food we truly did not need it but it would have been better with the soup then the crackers.

Anyways, the food came, and it was ok, but that is what a greek diner is.  I would rather it be ok, than taste like crap.  But then again we are not going to a five star dining experience, so when you come here, get your priorities straight don&#39;t knock the place because they did not have the latest Starbucks designer inside.  The old sign outside should give that away before you step through the doors.

My husband and I will be coming back to try breakfast next time.  It is worth it when you get good solid food.  Plus they had Free WI-Fi to keep kids happy!

We ate dinner here tonight, and though the people are so, so nice, the food and facility are subpar.

Everything we ordered was underwhelming, with the exception of the pancakes. Those were cooked to perfection. But our eggs were rubbery and the sausage was inedible. 

The restaurant itself is quite dated, which is just fine. But the bathrooms are really in need of attention (not just a cleaning, but major updates and a deep, deep cleaning), and I don&#39;t like eating with a bin of bussed plates sitting nearby.

I ordered the Mexican Skillet and it was meh. Waaaaay too greasy for my taste, not enough hash browns at the bottom of the skillet, and just overall not really impressive. My friend&#39;s son had the kids pancake which was a little sad. A thin little pancake with chocolate chips and whipped cream. Not as cute or creative as I&#39;ve seen other places do for the kiddos. 

The service was really not impressive, especially when there was only 2 other tables in the entire restaurant besides my table. 

Seriously, I hate to bash this place when it&#39;s so old and has been there forever, but they really need to spruce up their menu or light a fire under the chef&#39;s butts to make some Snow White magic happen.

Then soon after sitting the busboy came over to ensure we had enough table settings for all seated. And immediately after, a friendly waitress came over to ask for drink orders. They were kid friendly, because my kids got their drinks in a cup with a lid and straws. When I looked at the menu I saw a few entrees that seemed a little more pricy than expected and my kids having the expensive taste they have, they ordered breakfast entrees that were $9 each. I was a little taken back but when the food arrived (5 mins after ordering !! Wow!!) the entrees looked good. My kids got Ham off the bone with eggs and so many times when they&#39;ve ordered ham off the bone at other restaurants it&#39;s been dry and disappointing to say the least.

The whole Snow White and Seven Dwarves things is just awesome.  It really is.  What a theme for a restaurant.  Is it Dwarfs or Dwarves?  We&#39;ve driven by a couple of times and that&#39;s what caught our eye.  We&#39;d probably never had a reason to go if it was called anything else.  The dwarf thing really works.  

The menu was full of variety but I settled on breakfast.  I had a cheese omelette (so boring, I know) but it was the really good poofy, fluffy kind.  Not the flat crepe looking kind.  The American cheese wasn&#39;t completely melted though (as you can see in my pho-to) and non melted American cheese really grosses me out for some reason.  It has to be melted.  Totally weird, I know.  I got hasbrowns as well and I&#39;m trying to remember if I had toast or pancakes.  I&#39;m thinking I had pancakes.  

It wasn&#39;t very crowded, we were there at a weird time on a Saturday.  Kind of between lunch and dinner.  The other patrons were mostly much older people.  Some guy was all freaked out because he ordered his sandwich on rye bread and insisted that whatever bread he was given was not rye bread.  Apparently, it was rye bread but they switched their old species of rye bread for a new one.  I don&#39;t think he was completely convinced...

Husband ordered the Mexican skillet.  It apparently had a kick to it because he was sweating profusely the entire time, wiping himself off with napkins.  It was gross, but it was also funny.  I kept taking pictures of him and sending them to my sister.  

I had water, husband had coffee.  Our entire bill was $16.42.  Whaaaa??

I love the banter that comes along with an encounter like that. Sadly, that&#39;s where the fun ends. 

Once seated we start to look over the menu which was pretty broad and we all make some pretty quick choices.  French dips, burgers and Greek chicken. 

Here&#39;s the thing: the food tastes good. Especially the soup. Normally, I am very observant, but this was a high stress day and I didn&#39;t realize until after lunch how dirty things seemed. Smelled like dirty dish water. The waitress dropped utensils and picked them back up and distributed for use.

I can not even begin to think of how many times I have driven past this place.  To be honest, for years I thought it was an abandoned restaurant.  There are many shops or restaurants connected so it seemed quite possible.  Then I heard someone talking about it.  One day while running errands in the area, my husband and I decided to finally give it a try.  It was in the middle of the day so I was not expecting too much of a crowd.  We walked in and were greeted by a very friendly worker who let us choose our seat.  There were plenty to choose from with only about 3 other families there at the time (although as we were exiting it definitely picked up). The food came out fast, coffee was just ok, and service was decent as well.  It is hard to give any diner more than 3 in that they are all kind of similar.  I also think there are other diners in the area that I would frequent before coming back here.  Partly because of location but mostly because of overall service and food."

Someone get Sneezy some Claritin already. Doc, Bashful and Sleepy are fine. And you guessed it Grumpy is my favorite. He&#39;s just misunderstood. 

I have a soft spot for old diners. I want to visit all of them. Especially if they have cute names or cute signs outside. The light up sign is so cute, even with some of the burned out bulbs. 

We stopped in for dinner one night and it was not very bust at all. Service was very friendly and both servers in the room stopped to chat with a few of the diners for a while--appears they were regulars. 

Our dinner was pretty average. He the BLT club and Me the Monte Cristo. Both come with soup or salad and we tried the Florentine Chicken, which is basically cream of chicken.  I did like the french toast bread on the Cristo and that seems to bring a promise of good breakfast so I might return for that. 

I loved the names of the Snow White Themed Desserts. The seem to offer some great soda fountain creations. I opted for the orange cream soda--orange sherbet mixed blended with soda water. It was just OK. I&#39;ve had something similar at Tate&#39;s recently, but they used 7up and that was much better. 

Tons of Snow White themed decor/knick knacks. Plus several pictures of the owner with the Belushi Brothers (that was interesting). Clean interior, very dated decor. Family friendly."

I never would have guessed that the name of the restaurant truly meant &#34;Snow White and Seven Dwarfs&#34;! Snow White paintings and decor everywhere! A bit odd but it didn&#39;t really bother me.

I remember this visit over 20 years later, and have actually been here once or twice in the decades since then. But it wasn&#39;t too long ago when it was an early Saturday morning and I was interested in trying something different for breakfast that in searching I discovered they had a breakfast menu, and soon was scraping snow off my car to take a trip to the magical land of the Seven Dwarfs.

The inside has a big mural of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I managed to snap a couple of pictures of the mural while I was here. There&#39;s various other Snow White themed items found throughout the restaurant, mostly Disney merchandise.  The fairy tale theme is fairly noticeable with the decorations throughout the restaurant. But now it&#39;s time to move on to the actual food itself.

After scouring the menu at Seven Dwarf&#39;s I settled on a Mexican themed skillet. The eggs were well cooked, there was some chorizo sausage in it, various peppers and salsa.  I would say it was a little light on meat, and a little heavy on the salsa and veggies. The potatoes were crisp and tasted good. Overall this was a solid tasting skillet though as I mentioned a bit lighter on the meat and egg than some other places.

With my skillet I also got pancakes. These were fairly run of the mill pancakes, they were of average thickness and diameter. The maple syrup used was a little sweeter than normal and complimented the pancakes fairly well.

Overall I was pleased with my breakfast at Seven Dwarfs and would come again. There were no poison apples to speak of, service was quick, and efficient and soon enough I was singing &#34;Heigh Ho&#34; and on my way. I&#39;ll say this is an average diner and award it three stars. It&#39;s not a bad place to stop if you&#39;re in the area, and because of the Snow White theme would be a good place to take little kids."

A little childish, a little Disney, and a little dirty. The wait staff was VERY friendly; in fact, our waitress aired out her dirty laundry and told us her life story, ongoing conflicts, and a offered a myriad of other random details about her sorry life to the point of being intrusive. She must not have much of a social life aside from the patrons that frequent this establishment. Poor thing. So sad.

The food was adequate at best. The chicken noodle soup was a huge let down.  In fact, the soup wreaked of body odor and chicken ass. The noodles were so mushy and flimsy they would barely sit in my spoon. I sent it away and didn&#39;t want to even venture into navy bean territory even though it was offered. Blech.

The chicken salad sandwich was passable, but had no flavor whatsoever. I wondered if other ingredients aside from mayonnaise and chicken niblets would help their cause? I make a better chicken salad sandwich than this place on their best day.

The bathrooms were filthy dirty and wreaked of feces and bodily juices. So nice to see the owners care about cleaning their establishment. We took a gamble coming to this greasy spoon and lost. Oh well."

Not that it mattered much, because it really is a quite nifty little place to grab a bite to eat.

A little bit more about the ambiance.  The one whole wall is decorated up in a life-size Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs mural.  Also, every which way you turn, you are bombarded by statuary and pictures of the aforementioned Dwarfs.  After a while I got used to it and considered it quite quaint, but upon first entering, I found it very unsettling.  Little Dwarfs looking at you from all angles.  Shit, did that one statue by the door just move a little bit?

Service was decent.  Our waitress was prompt and courteous.  The host, who I am also going to assume was the owner, was also very friendly.  From the looks of it, they get many a repeat customers here (mostly older folks this particular morning) and he was at the door with smiles and hugs for most of the customers.  

The food was your standard family restaurant fare.  The highlight of my meal was the cream of chicken rice soup.  With its creamy texture, and faint lemon taste, it was to die for.  We both had burgers, and they were decent, nothing really earthshaking.  The portions were huge, so halfway through, I was full.  Which was kind of a bummer, since I really wanted to try one of their fountain creations for desert.  They have the old-fashioned soda fountain setup along the front counter, and I can bet some really tasty ice cream related treats are whipped up there."

Waitress did not seem happy to have us there at all, so it was a bit uncomfortable.

The food was okay. We both had omelets. I had fruit instead of hash-browns, and the fruit was extremely disappointing.

This was not my first choice for breakfast yesterday, and honestly, it wasn&#39;t even on my radar.  I was in Wheaton for work and I was with a group of folks, so I went where everyone else wanted to go.  

The coffee I just mentioned opened my eyes quick!  Our waitress (Sherry) was right on top of it, and was asking who wanted coffee practically before we&#39;d even sat down.  Maybe it was because we were seated at one of the larger tables by the coffee machine, or maybe she was that good at her job.  I&#39;m going to give her the benefit of the doubt and say she was good at her job.  Besides, she proved it plenty of times throughout the meal.

The owner (another reviewer said his name is Sammy) came by and checked on us, and stopped to enjoy a conversation with our group.  

I ordered the spinach/feta cheese omlette, and got my choice of pancakes or toast, and I went with the pancakes.  They were delicious, and tasted slightly different from the other pancakes I&#39;ve eaten in restaurants of this type, so I&#39;m pretty sure they make their own batter, and don&#39;t use some mass-produced restaurant supply batter.

The hash browns reminded me of the Ore-ida brand hash browns that my Mom would make for dinner.  This is not a knock on the hash browns, I was pleasantly surprised by this and it brought a smile to my face!  They were delicious and reminded me of simpler times!  (Yet one more reason to add the fourth star.)

We waited for 15 minutes for a waitress. There were three waitress&#39; on duty. One could have swung by to say hello or I will be with you shortly. Nope. I asked the hostess for the waitress, &#34;she will be right over.&#34; Five minutes later, still no waitress. So I asked for my check for the two coffees and then the hostess said &#34;she is coming, she is coming.&#34; by. That point I didn&#39;t care. We ordered a plate of eggs for my three year old because he has to eat, as kids do at that age. The waitress could have cared less that she so slow. She must not work for tips because she didn&#39;t care about service levels.  I get it when you are busy, but you have to organize the place into sections so a waitress doesn&#39;t run from one side to the other.

The food was bland. I could have made it better at home. The bus boy used the same towel to pick up food off the floor to wipe the table. The carpet is worn out and needs to be replaced. 

What is the appeal of this place? Was it owned by a Disney family member to make the connection to the seven dwarfs and snow white?

Oddly enough, I was not in the &#34;egg mood&#34;, so I opted for a club sandwich on pita.  Nicely enough, you can opt to get your sammies with a side of fruit or fries, which made me feel better about my bacon-mayo goodness on my club.  Nothing too exciting, but it did what a club sandwich is intended to do...filled me up.  And I loved the soft, warm pita bread.  A nice touch. 

The menu was big with a decent assortment of breakfast, lunch and dinner options.  You&#39;ll likely find something to calm the beast of hunger within.

The service was fast and friendly.  She kept the refills on my pop coming, and on my partner-in-crime&#39;s coffee, luckily for us caffeine addicts.  (We&#39;re really nice people, but when it comes to a stoppage in the flow of caffeine, we can&#39;t take responsibility.)

Kitchy and fun, we&#39;ll likely be back for some comfort food after another day in the trenches of municipal court, DuPage style."

We were greeted very nicely and enthusiastically by the man up front. It was a wonderful change from most places. We also loved the fact that there is still a breakfast bar like in old diners. We hadn&#39;t even had anything to eat or drink yet and already loved the place based upon the hospitality alone. Our waitress was very pleasant and actually had a personality, which is often lacking in places lately. She was prompt and courteous as well. My friend has been ordering corned beef hash skillets for years and said that this was honestly the best on he has ever had! Food was great, typical breakfast food. Pancakes were wonderful.

---

Boy, not much else to say about this place. I love that I have a new option in the area for lunch. I usually get a build-your-own with shredded mozzarella and ovalini mozzarella, no meats, but just about ALL the veggies. 

I love that they have interesting toppings like artichoke hearts, basil, cherry tomatoes and roasted garlic cloves (which are REALLY delicious by the way). It&#39;s pretty quick, too, since the pizza is really thin.

This is more like what I would imagine &#34;authentic&#34; pizza would be, but commercialized, if that makes sense. It&#39;s very thin, a little floppy (you can fold your slice in the middle), it&#39;s light on sauce and cheese, not super gooey like a Chicago-style thin crust. But you can load up as much toppings as you like and it has a really nice crispy crunch.

I like that they have a small patio to sit outside when it&#39;s nice, though it&#39;s a little loud since it&#39;s right on Roosevelt, and with only two umbrellas, you have to place them strategically or fight someone over the shady spots.

I come here at least once a week and intend to keep coming back!"

My hubby and I both had to come in to get a promo which was kind of inconvenient since they wouldn&#39;t accept it without him present. They had just opened and as I looked around, the place looked dirty. There were dirty tables (I&#39;m assuming from the night before) and ingredients under several tables that had been dropped. One of them had a lot of ants around the food on the floor which made me question, if they&#39;re not clean in front of house, how does the back of the house look? I come from the hospitality industry so I feel that&#39;s important for guests. Pizzas were a lot better than MOD pizza so I would go here over there anytime though.

My sister and I were in and out within 30 minutes. We both ordered the Meat Eater, one of their signature pizza&#39;s. It&#39;s topped with pepperoni, crumbled meatballs, red onion, mozzarella, and red sauce. I added giardiniera on mine and she added pepperoncini and jalapenos on hers. 

The pizzas are about 12&#34; and the crust are thin. They&#39;re put into their fast fired pizza oven, so when they come out they&#39;re nice and crispy, except the very middle, that was a little soft. The sauce is a little sweet for my liking.

1. Personalization.  They treat you as a person by addressing you by name when telling you about how to create your pizza and what you want to add when you get to the sauces, proteins, veggies.  
2. Cook times are not standardized.  There isn&#39;t a timed track since some toppings are combinations take longer than others.  They are primarily checking the bottom but they are at least checking the toppings to make sure they are done as well.

The price point is fair for the variety that you can have for all kinds of toppings.  I would highly recommend that they don&#39;t put as many toppings in the middle of the pizza since it is very difficult to eat with your hands.  After it is sliced, the point of the pizza slice is the middle of the pizza and it can get wet after ordering a pesto sauce, marinated red peppers, meatballs, or other toppings that don&#39;t want to cling to a hot pizza slice.  Still, it is fast food pizza so go in with appropriate expectations."

I came during the first week and ordered one of the pre-made options and they gave me a BOGO coupon to come back. I&#39;ve tried almost all of the fast casual pizza places out there--Pie Five, UBuild, Presto--but of all of them, Blaze is my least favorite. 

I came back today for the BOGO and ordered the veggie (add sausage) and the link. The link was decent and reminds me of a pizza I like from another pizza place, but it didn&#39;t have near enough toppings. The veggie ended up being pretty soggy. The pizza will run you about $9. Not bad, but go to UBuild for the same price with a drink included. 

I really like the crust. It&#39;s super thin, but this could also be why it gets soggy if there&#39;s too many toppings.

Also, they&#39;re still working out new business kinks. I ordered a veggie and when they got to the veggies, they asked me if I wanted any veggies. I had to read the menu and tell her what was on it.  Overall, not bad pizza but not my favorite either."

Blaze is my absolute favorite &#34;fast casual&#34; restaurant concept.  Ordering is straightforward, and the results are pleasantly predictable. 

Bonus points for options available to those allergic to cheese or gluten.   Their fake cheese and gluten-free crust are not bad.   (I prefer the regular crust and choices of standard cheeses, such as the gorganzola.   But good to know you can bring your allergic friend here and they wont suffer.)

First the app makes us go through the order twice before I give up and call it in. Then they tell me they don&#39;t take phone orders. The place gets great reviews so I put up with the aggravation of trying the app again (this time, outside of Yelp). That works, so I arrive there at 6:35, precisely the time I was required to check in. Tack on 2-3 more minutes to get the cashiers attention and after I do so, it&#39;s yet another 3-4 minutes before then they are even fired. 5 minutes after that, they out of the oven cooling down for 3-4 minutes before anyone thinks about boxing them. When that eventually happens, I&#39;m offered both my pizzas and told to have a nice night...without either of the salads I ordered. Then, the girl takes several more minutes to make a couple of salads. 

I expected to be in and out in 7-10 minutes but it took more than double that.

At the end of it all, the pizza was mediocre at best. My wife&#39;s had no sauce and mine had way too much. The only good thing about this whole ordeal were the Caprese salads.

Was not disappointed. They make personal pizzas but they are really portioned out. I ordered a pepperoni one and while contemplating the meat head one. The cheese is great and the crust had a great flavor. The pizza itself is thin but for the price point and the ingredients it hit the spot. If you download the app you get a bunch of freebies like free pop or dessert which is a great reward. If you&#39;re looking for a quick lunch and use the app to preorder your pizza you just walk in and bam they put it in the oven and you&#39;re good to go. Next time I come I will try that meat head pizza. This is the perfect spot for a quick pizza with top notch ingredients.

The line workers and pizza  oven valet&#39;s hustled their tale off...with smiles and intensity on a Thursday lunch in early November.  With their hard work (oh, yeah, free coupon) I&#39;ll give it another go just in case I caught it on an off period. However, this is definitely the runt of the litter or &#34;little brother&#34;  of the new three quick pizza restaurants near Elmhurst. The value and quality of MOD and Pie Five far outclass blaze. The portion and quality of cheese just isn&#39;t there and the value of what I spent on a pizza and soda to what I felt I received was well below expectation. Once again, because of the service I&#39;ll give it a #2 but the other two are well ahead on the pizza place hit chart!"

This seems to be the new trend in Lot of these chains that are popping up. Nothing was bad but kind of a soulless approach to food. The prices were OK, I suppose. I&#39;m not sure why all these new restaurants are looking and feeling the same. Very forgettable."

It was great!!!! The customer service was a nice surprise. The pizza makers were personable and carried on a conversation. They explained the process and offered us extra sauce one the pizza once it came out of the oven. My guy even put my pizza back in the oven to get it a little more toasty- I didn&#39;t have to ask him to do this.  

Second visit today on the 15th @ 4pm a completely different crew and HORRIBLE customer service. No eye contact, no smile, were chintzy with ingredients, pizza was soggy. They acted as if it was a bother for them to make our pizza- a big inconvenience to them. The manager spent more time on the phone rather than ensuring customers were satisfied. I wasn&#39;t offered any finishes. When I did ask for a &#34;finish&#34;, I was looked at like I had 5 heads!!! Not sure if I&#39;ll be back.

Ok here&#39;s an update to today&#39;s bad service. Just prior to us leaving, the manager of Blaze asked us how things were. I informed her of our experience today, which she apologized for. She did mention that they were down a person and that some &#34;things&#34; were going on just before we got there. She hoped that we give Blaze another chance- which I probably will."

You get to personalize your pizza as much or as little as you want.  The staff are all wonderful and friendly and let you put every single thing on your pizza that you could possibly want.  You can get everything from spicy sauce to various cheeses like fresh mozzarella or feta.  The concept is great and it always comes out very tasty.  It&#39;s on the pricier side for &#34;fast food&#34;, but the whole idea of this place is spot on. They execute it well and I&#39;ve already been there twice and it just opened a couple of months ago.  Toppings are fresh, pizza is tasty, and people were nice.

Staff was Very friendly. Picked out the pizza I wanted and noticed how skimpy they were with the ingredients, especially the cheese. When I asked for more cheese I literally got 3 more pieces. When my pizza came out of the oven there was spots without cheese, bummer :(. As I sat down to eat it, I really liked the crust, crispy, thin, how a pizza should be.

Had the bbq chicken wth some modifications crust was good. Too bad so much competing around with five pie mod pizza u build it and others. Same concept but more expensive than others listed and only one type of crust plus gluten where as five pie has different crusts and costs less. Though everything was fresh and tasted well.

The place was dead, just my boyfriend and myself in line. We were greeted by a laughing teenage associate, with at least 5-6 other teenagers standing around awkwardly behind the line. We got through the process of building our pizzas, quite slow, but understandable as I know they have opened recently in the past month. The quality of the pizza was just OK, the crust a little soggy, but what you would expect from a fast service pizza place. The variety of toppings was plentiful, and everything seemed fresh. What left a sour taste though was the service, the teenager associates laughing and joking amongst themselves through the entire ordering process, despite us being the only customers in the restaurant. While eating, 2 of them stood in different areas of the dining room pretending to sweep but were standing in place, 1 with the broom and 1 with the dustpan, talking the entire time. The restaurant itself was spotless, there really seemed to be nothing left to clean. Would&#39;ve been better for their image on service to send 3 of the associates home and keep the other 3 who actually seemed like they somewhat wanted to work. Overall, taste and service at Mod Pizza is much better."

We were seated immediately which was s good sign. Restaurant was modestly full at 7:30 on Tuesday. Our server Abigail told us what the drink specials are and asked if we would like one. We declined and ordered soft drinks. 
I noticed since we did not order alcohol she wasn&#39;t interested in our table. She arrived with the drinks and said be back in a bit for your order. At this point we were ready to order some calamari but had to wait for her return. We placed our order along with the calamari. I ordered a California burger my daughter ordered the chopped salad. Our calamari arrived along with share plates but guess what, no silverware. 
My daughter had to ask our hostess that happened to be walking by. The manager delivered our food but had to ask who ordered what, not his fault. My burger was just ok fries were not hot but that&#39;s what I kind of expected. My daughter said to ask for new fries but I&#39;m the kind of person that will just deal with it .

We were seated right away but when we asked for a few minutes to think about drinks, we were told the &#34;clock is starting&#34;. We laughed because we thought it was a joke but were later told it was because of an upcoming shift change.

Being a little pressed for time we ordered our drinks and food at the same time. When the drinks came out, one of our party noticed a couple of small black things with wings floating in her drink. We spooned one of them out and realized they were tiny fruit flies. Since our waiter was nowhere around, we stopped another one and asked for a manager. Before the manager came over our waiter came back. We showed him the flies in the drink and his response was &#34;ooo, I&#39;ll get you a new one&#34;. Minutes later the manager came over and apologized but offered no type of concession and really appeared as though this was nothing out of the ordinary. 

After we ate (I would add the food was decent but small portions for the price) we got our check and nothing, including, her drink was comp&#39;d, however the waiter actually made a point to say they did not charge us for the drink with the flies in it. Irritated, we mentioned again that the flies were pretty disgusting and he explained that it is because there is an open window by the bar. Again leaving us with the impression that this is somewhat common. 

We will never return here but if someone else decides to, please take this advice, check your drinks and/or food for flying things. Disgusting!"

Although the Promenade was bustling with shoppers, the bar and dining area of Gordon Biersch wasn&#39;t that busy.

My friend made reservations very much in advance, to ensure they could accommodate our large group.  Surprisingly, the majority of our group arrived on time, with only a few stragglers.  Two girls were waiting on our 2 tables, but they definitely could have used a third hand to take extra drink orders, refills, etc.  Considering the size of our group, the service was pretty good.

I ordered the Lobster Shrimp Macaroni &amp; Cheese which was alright.  I&#39;ve had better lobster mac.  For $20, I was disappointed with the dish, but it wasn&#39;t terrible.  The sauce was thin and the dish needed more lobster, shrimp, AND cheese.

I tried the garlic fries - now those were fantastic!  

I like that they have their own beers;  I had the Pumpkin Ale (VERY good) and sampled my friend&#39;s Winter Bock (again VERY good).  I opted for the Vandermill Totally Roaster Cider afterwards.

The bar here doesn&#39;t have Malort, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s really going to interest (or surprise) many people.  Actually, the bartender didn&#39;t even know what it was and asked me if it was a beer - &#34;is that Three Floyds?&#34; um, no.  Yikes!  Your suburban is showing, bro.

Overall I had a good time here, but I wouldn&#39;t strongly recommend it as a dining option.  A bar crawl at the Bolingbrook Promenade is a great idea though, and GB&#39;s brews are a solid start to the night."

The first time I dined was with my in-laws to celebrate my big move and then I came back again with a party of 20 last night. The service was good both times (I had a few minimal complaints last night.. but I did keep in mind we were a large party and I think they did a nice job. The manager even came over to check on us and make sure we were enjoying our food and drinks.)

I must start by mentioning that the fish tacos are fantastic. I usually order them everywhere I go and the ones here are very good. Last night, I ordered the beer mussels and-- upon recommendation from the server-- the seafood cobb salad. The mussels weren&#39;t my fave but they were aight. The seafood cobb salad was so good. It had crab and shrimp in it with a jalapeno ranch dressing.

They offer their own beers, as well as a seasonal cider and select wine and cocktails. I went with the Vandermill Totally Roasted cider, but I had a few sips of my friend&#39;s beers and did enjoy them.

This place has your average American food.  I&#39;ve been to a few Gordon Biersch locations, and they all feel the same.  I ordered a basic grilled chicken sandwich on a baguette with garlic fries.  Those fries make it worth coming, good spuds.  Otherwise, on my last visit, we ordered the fried artichoke hearts that I felt were a bit too small in size and quantity to justify the pricing.  The sweet potato fries were nicely fried, but the added sugar took it a bit far.  I personally feel that the natural sweetness of the potato didn&#39;t need the extra sugar - if anything, a hit of salt could have made it a bit more interesting.  Their salads however are a decent size with chicken nicely tender and thankfully not overly cooked.  If you&#39;re a beer lover, I would give this place a shot considering that they brew their own beers, which scores points with me.  They have a variety of beers, if you feel adventurous, go for the sampler."

For a $9 Bloody Mary, I felt it needed to be more garnished rather than a half a piece of celery. The waitress was also very rude and seemed to have rushed us out even though it was very empty during the afternoon. She also did not bring my change back, she voluntarily kept my change without asking as a tip. Not once did I say &#34;keep the change.&#34; 

The nachos were bomb though. Nice venue."

We&#39;ve been here a few times before and it would easily be more if not for one of my favorite restaurants being literally feet away. Anyways..on to GB. I split the CBLT and Cali Chicken sandwiches with my wife. Both were phenominal but the CBLT is heavenly. Shit..so is the Cali Club!  My son adds that his cheese pizza was pretty damn good too. 

Beer. Had the &#39;brown&#39;. No cutesy names here..just beer. The brown is caramel, toffee and a dash of bittersweet chocolate..and..awesome. Had to knuckle down to avoid a second.

Aside from the food and beer I like the seating options. We sat at the high top barside tables but they also have outdoor bar pull-up seats. If it wasn&#39;t for the Cubs game we would have sat out there.

We have given this glorified bar food restaurant third and fourth chances but never again. We ordered the Kobe burger- they&#39;re out of Kobe. Their pear and Gorgonzola salad was served with underripe pears, 5-6 Craisins, a few blueberries and wilted greens. The atmosphere is good, but watch your wallet and your intelligence- the ownership insults its customers to their face by offering crap food and making you thank them for it with their prices."

We sample about five of the GB pilsners and each one was as good as the last!  

We ordered the blud crab and artichoke dip for an appetizer.  B+  It was very good and was served still boiling.  The taste was great, I could have used a bit more crab and a little more dip.  We ended up with 2 crostinis and an empty dip bowl when it was all said and done.  

I ordered a cup of the New England Clam chowder.  A+++   I am always amazed when I find a chowder that has clams as the main ingredient as opposed to potatoes!  You would think that this would be more the exception than the rule!  Literally 60% clam meat and seasoned to perfection.  I will be back for this yummy chowda preparation.  

Because we were pretty full by this point we decided to split the fish and chips with the famous garlic fries.  I will give the fish a C+, they looked like fish sticks.... perfectly straight and  all identical in size.  That always makes me nervous, fish should not look like it was extruded out of a fish stick maker!   The taste was acceptable though, and we ate about 40% of the fish.   The Garlic fries were pretty damn good.  I prefer the garlic fries at Firewater BBQ in Crest Hill, IL, but these were pretty good as well.  A

Our bartender was attentive and engaging when he had time.  They were tolerant of our loud presence and even participated in the ruckas a few times.

However, after our last experience this weekend we will not be returning. 

The food and the beer is decent. The garlic fries are incredibly delicious. However, all of these good aspects of the restaurant mean nothing when you look at the awful service you receive. 

During an experience here last winter it was incredibly difficult to get ahold of our waitress and the food took forever. We chalked it up to it being the holidays and that they were busy. This past Sunday they were not busy, but we got the same treatment.

A family next to us who had sat down about 15 minutes after we had arrived received their food and had left before ours even got on the table. When we finally did receive our food, my dads chicken was severely undercooked. It was literally still pink on the inside. 

While I understand these things are bound to happen, the staff did not handle it well at all. They apologized and concurred that it was underdone, but did not take it off the bill. The full entree price was still on the check. It is common curtesy to take off something that could have made your customers sick. The mix of that situation as well as the awful service has left a bad taste in my mouth about this place which is why we will not be returning."

Now, they have many new styles to choose from as well as a &#34;flight&#34; where you choose 6 or more small samples.

The reason why I have given them a two star rating is because their food quality has been declining drastically over the past several years to the point where we have decided never to cross their doorstep again. 

For starters, my wife ordered the potato chips which were very tasty and season to perfection. I ordered the yellowfin tuna. Each time I come to this restaurant I order this appetizer and they do &#34;okay&#34; considering the preparation is never the same. This preparation had no taste at all. I feel I wasted my money. 

For her entree, my wife ordered the margarita flatbread pizza. Several of the pieces tasted like sand was sprinkled on top. We nave no idea what that was all about. I ordered the wild halibut, blackened. It came out like shoe leather. First, the waitress was a little belligerent when I was asking if they could prepare it this way; she didn&#39;t seem to understand what I was asking yet there were other blackened fish selections on the menu. Anyway, the fish was awful. It was extremely dry and over cooked. Kristine, the GM, took it off our bill. Actually she said she would, but didn&#39;t. So we insisted the server remove it.

Long story short, go for the beer but make another selection for dinner."

I give it 4 stars on the food &amp; drink.  However, the service was horrible.  We sat at a high top in the bar area which was half full on a Friday at 4:30.  Took forever to get our drinks, had to track down the waitress 3 times. Once to put our food order in, then to get the check, then to pay.  The manager was walking around and it appeared his only concern was to push chairs in.  I&#39;m sure that&#39;s important.  Also, our table was never cleared.  Definitely not worth the trip."

Get there early especially during the weekend.  It tends to get crowded during dinnertime.  I like the feel of this place.  It has a warm, tavern feel and it&#39;s a great place to dine with a large group.

I ordered their Lobster and Shrimp tacos.  Very good!!  We ordered their fish and chips.  My only complaint was they looked more like fish sticks than your typical fried cod.

They were the only brewery to make German style pilsners vs ales and their food was all excellent. Then something happened about a year ago. It might be due to it being bought out by the same company that owns Rock Bottom or just new management, I don&#39;t know. The food now is forgettable and it seems like they cheapened the ingredients in their beers. Their signature garlic fries are not even good anymore.

Since moving away from area, I have not been able to make it out to GB in quite a while; so my boyfriend and I made a special trip out this way. The beer quality remains the same, but the food quality has drastically changed for the worst. The food no longer has a finesse about it that it once had, yet the prices still remain high. For example, my boyfriend ordered the steak frite and was completely dissatisfied with what was delivered to the table, he had it sent back. Nothing about the dish was as he remembered. A manager never came to our table despite our dissatisfaction which had to be painted clearly on our faces (we don&#39;t like to raise our voices and cause a scene). The only thing we received was an apology from the bartender (we were sitting at the bar) and a short explanation on how they have &#34;re-engineered&#34; a few items on their menu ... just awful. If it&#39;s not broken, why fix it. They replaced a traditional steak frite for an underwhelming steak with french fries on the side and no sauce on the steak or on the side. I had the California burger, also a disappointment from the previous times I would order it (and cold from me waiting for my boyfriend&#39;s food to come back out - my fault, but I didn&#39;t want to finish my dinner in front of a starving boyfriend!)

We didn&#39;t care where we sat, so when we heard the bar was open seating, we were able to sit immediately, and were still able to get the full dining experience.

This was my first time, and I wanted to try one of their own brews, so I opted for the Golden Export. It was light, not overly flavorful, but drinkable. 

For food, we ordered unhealthy and got the blue crab artichoke dip and the sampler platter. I was excited for the dip, since I love crab. There was good chunks of crab in there, and it was nice and hot, but I thought the flavor was a little too cream cheese/sour creamy for me. I also didn&#39;t note much in the way of artichokes.

The sampler platter had two kobe sliders, southwest egg rolls, garlic fries, hummus.... it was a LOT of food. All of it was good, but nothing was super memorable.

Service was pretty consistent and quick. The place has an open, but warm atmosphere. I&#39;d like to come back when it&#39;s warmer to sit outside!"

I was a regular at the Gordon Biersch in Miami and was thrilled to be able to go there for dinner after a trip to the nearby IKEA.  The menu is almost the same from what I remember three years ago.  

We started our meal off with beers--I got the Marzen, and he got the Oktoberfest.  The great thing about GB is that all of their beers are 1.5 liter pours.  However, the beer wasn&#39;t as good as I remembered.  Maybe it was an off batch, or maybe the brewer isn&#39;t as good at this location.  We ordered the crab and artichoke dip which is still amazing.  It used to come in a bread bowl, which would have been better because you run out of bread.  I ordered the blackened mahi sandwich with garlic fries.  The flavor was really great, maybe a little bit too salty, but the same as I remember.  If you love garlic, you will love the garlic fries--they are awesome!

The service was really good throughout our meal.  And we sat on the patio on a slightly chilly fall night, but there are heat lamps which made it nice.  The food is great for a bar, but the beers weren&#39;t so great, maybe they&#39;ll be better next time."

Hence I am using my fiancés Yelp.  Brought her out to a late dinner here on Friday at 9:00 pm.  When we walked in I asked for a table of two, the hostess started walking me toward the back and proceeded to a table right next to the entrance of the kitchen where there is a lot of foot traffic from the employees. I immediately asked for a booth because there were only 2 booths occupied. The hostess said booths were only for reservations, so I reluctantly agreed to sit at a table near the entrance to the kitchen while there were at least ten other unoccupied tables and at least 8 booths unoccupied in the same section. We proceeded to wait for the waiter to greet us. 20 minutes goes by  and an older gentleman with gray hair approaches the table looking like he absolutely hates his life and has better things to do on this Friday night than to wait a table.  He never gives us his name. We order a bottle of wine and some waters.  Another gentleman comes to the table and sets the bottle of wine on the table and leaves after opening it, not even pouring a glass for us. Another 20 minutes goes by, meanwhile our waiter is liaising with other customers and chatting and laughing with his other tables. He finally comes to take our order. We order steak dinners. While I&#39;m trying to enjoy my meal with my fiancé, another waitress begins to sweep the carpet in the middle. While sweeping, she sweeps a half eaten piece of bread next to my foot as well as the dust from the carpet. I was totally disgusted and proceeded to stare at her while she continued to do this while I was eating my meal. She then sits down at a table, leaving the pile of dirt and food next to my table to chit chat with a couple she was waiting on.  We finished the bottle of wine and the meal and the waiter keeps ignoring us chatting with his tables ( that were sat at the booths after we arrived that were supposed to be for reservations only) and another 20 minutes goes by. Finally he approaches us and asks if we would like dessert. Reluctantly I said no just the check.  I proceeded to tip my usual 20% on a bill that was over $100 even though the service was unlike anything I have ever experienced in my life. I am a 29 year old male who looks very young for his age. I came to the conclusion that I was treated this was because they either thought I was young and broke and wouldn&#39;t make any considerable tips off of me or because they just didn&#39;t care that I was a customer trying to enjoy a meal with my fiancé. If I could give below one start for this place I would but it&#39;s not possible. There is more I could say about this place but it&#39;s not worth my time to be on here.

My friend ordered the chicken sandwich, kind of disappointed with the portion size of the chicken itself just by looking at it, I personally did not try it, it looked good. Just there was ALOT more bread then there was chicken, the piece of chicken was probably slightly bigger than 1/2 of the pieces of bread. 

Waitress - I cannot recall the waitresses name but she seemed friendly but didn&#39;t give our table her full attention, I ended up finishing my coke and didn&#39;t get offered a refill until we were ready to leave. There were two times throughout the meal that I couldn&#39;t find her to get a refill or ask for some additional ranch. She didn&#39;t bring the food to us, another waiter did. The waitress didn&#39;t come and ask how it was at all or even check up to see if we needed anything else, if we needed something we had to flag her down. Being the &#34;dinner rush&#34; time she wasn&#39;t very attentive, which it didn&#39;t seem all too busy to the point where she couldn&#39;t of paid attention to her tables.

Saw the Manger (I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s who he was) of the restaurant laughing and joking with some of the staff at the bar, as a manager of a restaurant he should be walking around and introducing himself to tables and seeing how things are with the tables. 

Would I return?  - probably not... food was just okay, nothing I would absolutely have to go back for, especially with the service given."

Went with my boyfriend for his birthday.  He loves there bbq chicken pizza. Their fried calamari app is lightly battered fried to perfection and never chewy. The garlic dipping aloi is better than the marinara and has a horse raddish kick to it. 
They don&#39;t have blue cheese olives the server said it was a health code issue.  He was very accommodating and gave me a cup of blue cheese so i could stuff them myself.  
I had the chef special pan seared cod. It was greasy and the kalmalata olives were pitted but there were still pieces of the seed and i bit down on one and thought I was going to crack a tooth."

It was good but not amazing like it had been the previous time. My burger also came with about 10 fries total, which was quite a small portion compared to my previous visit. We were with a large group but our servers didn&#39;t really check back with us for refills and there were quite a few errors on the bill when it arrived. Still love the place, just wasn&#39;t as impressed as I had been on the previous visit"

Pros: crab &amp; artichoke dip was absolutely  fabulous. Garlic fries were on point. There is the two stars...

Cons: service was absolutely embarrassing. The burger was bland and just inedible. It was not seasoned at all, total waste of our money. We saw our waiter maybe twice, didn&#39;t get drinks refilled the entire hour and a half. Had to ask 3 times for a check and saw him standing around making small talk :/ really horrible date night."

We snagged the last seat on one of their 2 patios. Our server was nice but a little awkward and soft spoken. We got the Hefeweizen and a marzen brewed in-house and both were tasty and gave me a good buzz. I ordered the peppercorn steak which came with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was VERY peppery but that&#39;s to be expected. My boyfriend got the cioppino which was a Cajun seafood mixture in broth. It was spicy but very good. A lot of their menu items had a Cajun theme so I&#39;ll definitely be back to try some more items. All the dishes we saw on other diners&#39; tables looked delicious!

Someone else in my family loves it, not me.  The server seemed overwhelmed and the food lacks certain character.  It reminds me of Bennigan&#39;s.  

How do you offer pizza, but no Italian sausage?  When someone asks for sausage on the pizza, the entree returns with andouille sausage!!  Let the customer know the type of sausage served first.  At least the reordered pizza was complementary. 

The strawberry lemonade was too weak.  At least the server had he foresight to ask another server to refill our drinks.  

My daughter asked for lettuce with her sandwich.  She gets her food, but has to wait 5 minutes for lettuce to arrive.

Perhaps this was a bad day on my second visit to this place.  They are definitely better than Rock Bottom Brewery."

The food was alright. I got the southwestern egg rolls for an appetizer and that was decent. I got the bourbon chicken and grilled shrimp with the mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were good, but the chicken lacked flavor and was a little dry. My boyfriend got the brewhouse chicken and while his chicken was juicy and fresh, it lacked the flavor that the menu had promised. 

The only reason I gave this place 3 stars instead of 2 was because of the fantastic service. Our waitress was very nice and attentive, but not overbearing. It was like she had a sixth sense about when we needed something and she was there. She was super friendly. To be honest she was so nice even though the food was very average, we stayed for dessert. The hostess was very nice too. She greeted us with a huge smile and even though the patio was busy, she personally went outside to clear the table so we could sit down. Since I&#39;m a sucker for great service I will go back and hopefully get something that tastes better."

Ordered drinks and appetizers from our waitress. The 4 appetizers came out and were delivered by another person. After a half hour, with appetizers eaten, plates empty and drinks empty, still no waitress. We asked another waiter for help, said he was busy, waited 5 minutes got up to find a manager for help. Finally the table was cleared, new soft drinks ordered and Waiter told us there was a shift of tables and each server was getting two large sections of tables which was too much for them to handle. So original waitress was somewhere else doing other tables. New waiter brought drinks then finally took our order for dinner. We waited for over an additional hour for dinner. Waiter said once it would be coming soon, &#34;any minute now &#34; he said. 15 minutes later he said it again, when we called him on it he said &#34;if I go up there to look for your food, they will chop my head off!&#34; He walked away. We noticed that there was a ton of food lined up under the heating lamps and nothing was being delivered. Now, after 2 hours total of waiting for dinner, nothing, water glasses were empty, no refills on the soft drinks. Sooo...we got up and left. I went over and told the waiter we were leaving, so I could pay for what we had, the 4 appetizers and the 3 soft drinks. He took me over to the manager, who said he was too busy to talk. REALLY! We just wasted over 2 hours for 6 people and you are too busy to talk? So I just walked out with the other 5. Never paid a dime. Never Ever will go back there again. They do not care for the customer. I have never walked out without paying before, but they deserved it."

Ordered off the Valentine&#39;s special menu. A big mistake. The portions were really scaled down. We watched the other tables receive regular sized portions and it looked like we were eating dollhouse food. 

Our watress disappeared and we saw her sweeping one of the areas on the other side of the resturant. Sweeping must of been on the to do list for the evening. Another waitress was sweeping the carpet  with a broom around us for about 5 minutes while the food was being served around her.

It took about 1/2 hour between the salads and the main meal. The resturant was not full so It was hard to figure out why it was taking so long. 

What we got of the food was good....but we left hungry. This meal with  3 drinks from the bar , 1cup of coffee and tip. $100.

It was a disappointing Valentine&#39;s dinner. Maybe stay away from this place unless you want a beer and a burger."

It really delivers solid beers and food all around. 

Their seasonal beers are really high quality. The winter ale at 7.5% packs a good punch but is a smooth dark beer. The garlic fries are packed with a ton of garlic and it pairs well with the beers.

I had the special cod sandwhich and it was cooked to perfection. Flakey and on chibiatta bread which was amazing. Upgrade to the sweet potatoe fries. Lots of flavor and worth the $1 upgrade. 

They got dinged a star because the waiters are spread thin they had a tough time explaining some dishes. It is a busy place and probably $20-30 a person. Would recommend and go back."

Our server was absolutely amazing.  He was very friendly, attentive and sociable. The Märzen beer is so good. I got the grilled chicken and shrimp,  it was absolutely delicious, though the green beans were a bit over seasoned. Everyone else enjoyed their food as well.

And then or server was too kind and presented my husband with a slice of chocolate cake on the house. With a candle in it of course :)

I&#39;ve been to GB 2xs. Both experiences were eh. I went for my 26th birthday with two friends and had the crab &amp; lobster cakes. Came with a side of asparagus and garlic fries. Fries were great, the crab cakes... Mm. They weren&#39;t as together and crisp as I envisioned, plus flavor was a bit bland. Not worth the amount of $$. My friend got the steak frites and asked for it to be medium well, but, the amount of time it took for the food to cook and come out, it seems the steak decided that it wanted to be well done to the point of dried out. She is a lot like me, we don&#39;t like to send food back, but her sister (she and I had the same meal) made a good point- &#34;You&#39;re paying for it.&#34;
The waiter was super nice, he seemed a bit overwhelmed, our diagnosis was that they were short staffed. Even the hostess was delivering food &amp; drinks. Got dessert, it was fine. A brownie something. I requested pecans and for the ice cream to be separated (no one likes melt ice cream) and it was satisfying. BTW, I got the strawberry soda and it was good, not too liquored."

We were never asked if we wanted water and it was never brought.  One of our burgers was about half the size of another.

Historically the family enjoys this restaurant with no exception. However tonight  left a little bit to be desired.I ordered Ahi tuna steak and it was dry, my son in laws hamburger was dry, the mahi mahi sandwich  ( ordered by two people based on previous experience) was a disappointment. I also ordered the prosciutto sliders for appetizers and the prosciutto was too thick  more like bacon , dry and tough as well . THIs is the first time in years that I have been disappointed    On a more positive note the wait staff was as usual very nice and very accommodating. One of the plates ordered by  a child arrived at the table cold and it was immediately replaced with no hassle. Not sure what was the issue tonight  Possible a change in kitchen staff???  I have been to this GB many many times in the past as has  the other members of my family and we have had too many great meals and experiences to allow this to turn us away from this restaurant permanently.

The atmosphere, food, and service is all very consistently mediocre.

Appetizers --blue cheese chips. In general I love anything drenched with blue cheese but their cheese sauce left much to be desired. Also, their crab dip didn&#39;t taste as well as I hoped. They were both decent, I might order the chips again. 

Dinner-- I chose the Tuscan chicken pasta and I thought it was flavorful and tasted alright, but for $20 I was wishing I had ordered an individual pizza that my cousin next to me ordered for half the price. 
Their garlic fries are often raved about but I think they&#39;re WAY too garlicky.

Our server was attentive to our large group, and brought everything out as we asked for. No notable personality, but she did get the job done.

The service for the most part is pretty good, good atmosphere as well.

The food unfortunately the second time around was horrible!
1. My sister ordered a salad and didn&#39;t taste a dressing. So she asked the waiter&#39;s assistant if there was already dressing on it, he replied yes. So she asked if she could get extra on the side. 10 minutes later he came back with a dressing, that was most definitely NOT already on the salad. 
2. My mother and I ordered the chicken bruschetta that comes with asparagus. My asparagus tasted more like the grill than it did asparagus. Which is normally a good thing, but I couldn&#39;t taste the yummy asparagus I had eaten there before.
3. As I said, my mother and I ordered the same thing... although her food came out about 10 minutes later than the rest of ours, which I think made us all feel bad for eating in front of her. At least her asparagus tasted better than mine!

Steak (certified Angus beef) bite after bite ended up on plate because I chewed and it wasn&#39;t breaking down. Like chewing a Cotten ball. This was NOT  good quality beef. In fact, it was the worst quality beef. I was embarrassed that I kept removing inedible chewy bites of meat from my mouth. Also, I asked for medium rare, and meat was cooked solid medium all the way through. I told and showed waitress (we ate at the bar) and she did not offer to take it back. Also, ordered Bernaise sauce that was forgotten. 10 minutes later it arrived totally congealed, firm, not a sauce. Maybe just a bad chef tonight. But, c&#39;mon. Paid $78 bill (before 15% tip - because issue not with staff, but with kitchen) and will not be coming back."

All the all fresco dining was taken, so we took a nice booth inside facing outside.  It was bit odd for the two of us to take up a booth, but it let us sit next to each other, hold hands, and all that romancey stuff.  =)  Personally, I think the hostess sat us there since the Asian waiter was covering that section, but who knows.  I&#39;m just glad he was a great waiter!

In our attempts to stay paleo, we got the following:

Sweet potato fries - Unfortunately there was a sugar coating on the fries, but otherwise it was paleo and delicious!  The big piece of rosemary added an interesting but perfumy flavor to the fries touching it... not all together bad, but surprising.

Turkey/mushroom meatloaf - Wow, this was actually pretty good!  Subbed out mashed potatoes for vinegar slaw, and the veggies were a cayenne pepper sauteed green beans.  Very tasty, and decently close to paleo as well (I&#39;m guessing there was bread crumbs of some sort in the meatloaf, as it was waaaaay too tender not to have them).  Surprisingly good dish overall!

Seafood cobb salad - This was gigantic.  Seriously, bigger than your face bowl filled to the brim with toppings.  My only complaint is that the seafood definitely tasted canned or frozen (shrimp were flavorless, and crab was pretty salty), but the rest of the ingredients were great!  If they just dropped the seafood and knocked off $3-$4 on the salad, I think we would&#39;ve been far happier... overall, great salad, the seafood just didn&#39;t add anything to the salad.

Verdict:  High priced ($40+ after tax and tip, no drinks), good food, glad we had a gift card here.  For a mostly paleo meal, we were pretty happy!  Prices are just a little steep for what I&#39;d be willing to pay though..."

A substantial amount of time passed before our server stopped by to greet us and take our drink order. The menu has some interesting items so initially, the wait time didn&#39;t bother me as I was having trouble making up my mind. I decided on the smoked chicken and mushroom pasta and my boyfriend ordered the GB beer mushroom chicken. We each ordered a golden export which was excellent. We split the famous garlic fries for an appetizer that we have heard so much about. The fries were crispy and delicious. I&#39;m glad we ordered the fries to hold us over because our food took quite a while. Our entrees were just okay. Next time I come, I&#39;d definitely order something different.

I ordered a chicken avocado club. Chicken was slightly dry. There was not a lot of sauce. Side order of garlic fries was a joke. I received about 10 fries. 

Service- Mediocre/okay
Everything we asked for took a long time to receive. I asked for ranch because the chicken was dry. By the time I got it, I had nearly finished the sandwich. Only good thing I can say is, my girlfriend spilled an $8 dollar mojito after about two sips and they replaced it for her and only changed her for one. That was nice. 

Atmosphere- Pleasant/enjoyable
Lighting was not too bright or too dark. Music wasn&#39;t so loud that it was distracting. Decor was nice and comfortable. 

Overall-
 I would not return to this restaurant. Food and service was not worth the price. However, the environment/atmosphere was comfortable. 

Side note- Beer was decent."

For a brewery, GB didn&#39;t have many beer options. For a restaurant, GB had pretty standard bar food that, while good, was nothing to write home about. The famous garlic fries are flavorful, albeit oily. 

It always confuses me when a venue has an exposed kitchen, only to show the staff all standing around doing nothing. Perhaps it was only that way because we were there late on a weeknight, but it was a little... &#34;why are there so many people standing around when I asked for water ten minutes ago?&#34; Thus, I can&#39;t rave about their service, but our server was nice enough to offer beer samples before I committed to one."

Here&#39;s the bottom line: good food and service.  The owner stops by your table on a busy Friday night.    I had the Chicken Marsala and my better half had the Lasagna.  There are a couple of ways you can serve the Marsala.  One is to make a thick sauce with Marsala wine and pour it over the Chicken. The other has your Chicken swimming in Marsala wine.  They both work.  I had some linguini to take home.  The Lasagna is special.  One of the top five Lasagnas  I&#39;ve ever tasted.  The portion could easily feed two people.  

The Tiramisu was superb.  You want your fresh lady fingers soaked, but not drenched in rum.  Discernable, but not overly so...just the way I LIKE IT. Light enough you can drop your fork through it.  

 Next visit, I want to try the Chicken Vesuvio and the Goosey cake.  Nice job Paul and Mike."

We caught an early show and missed dinner. I called in a pickup order and grabbed a pie on my way home. The horror was opening and seeing they pie cut a small into 12 pie shape pieces and it was undercooked.

I requested a new pizza and now feel upset, as I wanted to have already had my dinner by 10pm.   The manager commented they have a new guy on the oven and it looked cooked. He was wondering why he cut into so many little pieces. He requested the old pizza back so he could see it and show his staff.

They probably had a really busy night and I just got in a bit too late. The replacement wasn&#39;t much better. For a thin crust, the bottom was doughy and not at all crispy. I&#39;ll reheat the other half on a hot pizza sheet for the desired crispy crust another day. I prefer when the pepperoni is on top of the cheese too.

Now for the worst part.  By the time we arrived home less than 5 minutes.  The pizza was cold.  The box felt cold when we left.  Small pizza looked like it had been sitting.  Medium pizza needed reheating.  Hoping to find a good pizza place soon... Traverso&#39;s is not it!"

Decent food for what it was, but not Italian in the real sense. It felt like a very homey environment though. Food served, much like I imagine my mom would have made, had she have known how to cook.  Sadly however, I grew up with a mother who cooked eggs in the microwave , so this was not even the &#34;Italian&#34; I was served at home growing up. --Italian in my house was Chef Boyardee. ;)

Judging Italian restaurants is tough for me. Am I rating it on real Italian (that I&#39;ve eaten here and in Italy) or am I rating it on &#34;American Italian&#34;? This review is strictly &#34;American Italian&#34;; their food was so Americanized, they should just call it &#34;American&#34; and be done with it. ;) 

I give the food my husband and I ate 3-stars. The gluten free food my brother ate 3-stars and Wendy our waitress earned a 5-star. The fact that it is a family owned business is a 5-star. All together and Traverso&#39;s get&#39;s a 3-star from me.

We will be back for sure. Why would we come back for what I consider to be &#34;A-ok&#34; food that also happens to be 5 miles from my neighborhood? Because my celiac brother was able to eat a heaping plate of  gluten free fried chicken. His very first fried chicken since being diagnosed 2 yrs ago. He also was served GF bread and as GF breads go, he really liked his. 

I ordered the gnocchi with meat sauce. Would have preferred gnocchi with cream sauce but after having eaten a doughnut the day before, red sauce it was. Gnocchi was slightly gummy and a little too dense. They were not melt-in-your-mouth fluffy, like they should be. I still found them to be &#34;A-Ok&#34; though.  Meat sauce was made of very fine ground meat, definitely had a fair amount of sugar added to it and very reminiscent of my grandma&#39;s cooking. --Close enough that I could have sworn she was back in their kitchen! My own red sauce only has enough sugar to cut the acid and full of sausage and short ribs. Good enough to elicit a marriage proposal I&#39;m told.  Theirs was too sweet and just not meaty enough with the very fine ground meat. Not bad, but nobody would propose over it. 

My husband really liked his spinach and feta stuffed chicken breast. I tried it as well. Chicken was cooked very well. Juicy. Had very nice flavor. His also came with polenta, which was completely swimming in sauce and just not visually appealing to me. --When it came out, I couldn&#39;t even tell what he&#39;d ordered. I still liked it enough to steal an occasional bite from his plate though, but should I order polenta from there, I will be sure to ask them to only add half of their usual amount of sauce.

Wendy might be my favorite waitress I&#39;ve ever had. I liked Wendy&#39;s attitude and humor so much that I&#39;d like to take her to lunch just to keep listening to her speak. She was exceptionally helpful; very knowledgeable of the gluten free menu; very patient with our table&#39;s questions and stayed on top of our table&#39;s needs without being overbearing, all while delivering comedic comments. If all wait staff at every restaurant could be that fantastic, we&#39;d all be very lucky people indeed. --She earned the biggest star of the night; although, my brother might say she tied with the GF fried chicken. ;)"

The bf and joke that it is now &#34;our&#34; booth. 

After being seated by the extremly friendly host, we ordered our drinks. I wish I could remember our waitress&#39;s name, but I can&#39;t recall it. She was very friendly, attentive, and kept us &#34;in the loop&#34; about the status of our order.

My drink for the night was an Abita Satsuma Harvest Wit. I had never tried it, though I&#39;ve tried four of Abita&#39;s other brews and I&#39;m quite the fan. After a sip of the Satsuma Harvest Wit, I was pleased with my selection and I must have been rather thirsty, as I ordered another one almost immediately. 

For our appetizer, we selected the Spinach Artichoke Dip (bf&#39;s choice - he&#39;s a S&amp;A addict). It&#39;s a large appetizer and I knew immediately I wouldn&#39;t be finishing my entree, that&#39;s for sure. 

I chose the Chicken Picatta for my entree, which was boneless chicken breasts sauteed in white wine and lemon, served over angel hair pasta and topped with capers (similar to the Chicken Limone at Luigi&#39;s, so it seemed). I had the choice of soup or salad with the entree, and I chose the mixed greens salad.

Our appetizer arrived quickly, however the entrees took quite a bit longer. It was Black Wednesday though, so I understand. Once the food arrived, I was correct in my assumption that I would not finish my entree as the portions are quite large. I enjoyed my meal as did the bf (he orderd the same thing) however we both agreed we didn&#39;t really care for the chicken. It seemed rather.... greasy? It wasn&#39;t bad, just not great. The mixed greens salad was fabulous.

I wish this place was a little closer to home, but it&#39;s definitely worth the trip and we&#39;ll certainly be back again. You definitely get your money&#39;s worth here!"

In fact, I left so full I could barely walk, and yet after I got home, wanted to open back up the leftovers and eat more! I am only disappointed I never visited earlier.

Immediately as we walked in, I was pleased. The hostess was very friendly, offering us a spot either in the dining room or the bar. We chose the bar, and it was a good choice. Everyone was watching the USA World Cup Game, and it was a great atmosphere. We were all starved, so we decided to start with an appetizer before our pizza.

We settled on the calamari, and I must say, it was hands-down the best I&#39;ve ever had. Light fried crust and the calamari was so well cooked. Not rubbery; almost melt in your mouth good.

For dinner, our group of four ordered 2 x 14&#34; pizzas. The boys shared (and finished!) a half pepperoni and half sausage. The fresh sausage was delicious and the cheese was greasy and fantastic. Us girls split a 14&#34; with black olives, mushrooms and green peppers. The peppers were crunchy and the toppings were plentiful. To top it all off, the ranch for dipping was amazing! We ate about half of the pizza and split the rest to bring home.

The prices are a bit on the high side, but the food really was great. Our server was attentive, friendly and helpful as well!"

I had read a lot of other reviews on here and knew the service was going to be hit or miss. We got a miss. Hopefully next time we will have a little better service. 

My friend and I were not in a hurry, but the entire dinner took 2+ hours. Our waitress just seem preoccupied with tables other than ours. We initially asked for another minute to look over the menu since neither of us had been there before and after 45 minutes we had to ask the owner to send our waitress back over so that we could order. 

Now onto the food... I ordered the chicken parm and asked for the tomato cream sauce on the penne pasta. The chicken parm was good, not the best I have ever had, but good. The tomato soup that came as a starter was one of the best I&#39;ve had. The tomato cream sauce on the penne was awesome. We ordered the brownie sundae for dessert and I was totally blown away with how good it was. There was this cream cheese topping that was to die for. It was warm and served with ice cream and whipped cream. Delicious! 

I had to ask twice for a glass of water and my friend had asked for a refill on her drink half way through the meal and never got it.  There were a lot of larger parties in there and it seemed like there were only 2 waitresses working which didn&#39;t seem like enough. 

Will be back based on the food alone. A bit pricey for the area like others have said, the quality of the food makes it worth it."

For an appetizer, we ordered the toasted avocado, which was great. Imagine an avocado lightly heated and decorated with bruschetta toppings. It was out of this world, so I hope they continue to offer it since it was a only a special for that night.

For dinner, we split the eggplant rigatoni dish (also a special). The waitress was amazing at accommodating our request to split the meal, even so far as splitting the salad that comes with it.

This place is great for a date night or for a night out with the family, but it&#39;s not too fancy. The prices were a little high for Naperville, which is why we split the dinner, but we really liked it overall."

The service is terrible. We have 2 small children and when we sit down we always ask for bread and order the kids meals right away before we even look at our own options. Last time we had to ask 4 times for bread to ensure our son stayed quiet and despite asking for the kids&#39; meals right away we didn&#39;t get them until our food was out. This is bad mostly for the people around us who had to wait for our children&#39;s food so they would be quiet. My husband also order 2 beers and asked that the second be brought with the meal. He didn&#39;t get it until AFTER our check. Again, with 2 children under 2 the people around us were the ones who suffered the most when my husband had to chug his beer while I tried to continue to shove food into my full children&#39;s mouths.."

In our case, the beef was tough and the salmon was undercooked.  Perhaps the more traditional Italian dishes are better.   Been here a couple of times and disappointed both.

I grew up eating their pizza and to this day it&#39;s my benchmark that I compare all other thin crust pizza&#39;s to.  

I moved to Naperville not even knowing they had a second location.  I was soon happy to be ordering pizza a delivery from my favorite spot.  Best pizza in Chicago and the Naperville location is spot on to the original.  Nothing fancy, just a really great family owned old school joint.

First time ordered out.  This time we dined in.  I really was hoping for an excellent experience so I could give a good review.  That is why I waited to go back &amp; dine in.  

Gross and dirty will sum up my experience in total. 

We sat in a booth by some fake flower arrangements.  It hadn&#39;t been dusted in forever &amp; there were cobwebs.  Gross.  For a restaurant that supposed does high volume, please clean up properly.  Your windowsills and fake arrangements included!  It&#39;s disgusting to see dust and webs as a diner. 

Onto the food, had some calamari.  It was drenched in oil...drenched.  We took a few bets and oil was just pouring out.  Again, gross.  There was no flavor except the oil.  Maybe put some grilled on the menu with less oil? 

We had a pizza.   It was SO salty...  We barely ate.  Got our check &amp; left.  We did not complain.  Our server was decent &amp; not her fault that the food was disgusting.  We tipped hep appropriately.  

Not a place id go to, or order from again given an option.  It&#39;s unfortunate because they&#39;re so close to my house. 

The menu reminds me a of an Italian version of Applebee&#39;s.  You don&#39;t need that much stuff.  Maybe that&#39;s why the food is barely edible."

I don&#39;t normally subject myself to bringing 6 1st graders and 2 toddlers to a restaurant but this was all for a good cause. I wanted to leave a review because I was very happy with how the restaurant staff treated our big rambunctious group. Our server right away grouped everybody at our table into groups so that the check situation wouldn&#39;t be a nightmare. She then very calmly (over the dull roar of our boys) took our orders. The food was incredible. I had heard rumors of these magical raviolis and they did NOT disappoint. The pizza and pasta was also amazing. I am so glad that our school partnered with Taversos and we will continue to visit and enjoy this restaurant.

One of the two owners, which I believe are brothers,  seem to always be on the job, ensuring everything is up to standards. More often than not one of them will come to the table and ask if everything is satisfactory.       Traversos has a modest number of menu choices, but executes them well. The wine list seems to have been upgraded. 

My wife and I dined there this past Sunday. The place was busy with one long family table occupied (10) plus a special party group in the back room. In spite of this our service did not suffer. I had a simple pasta dish and my wife ordered a customized pizza. Everything was done nicely and we got away without breaking the bank.

Portions are such that one often takes home leftovers. A recommended staple for neighborhood Italian food."

Have been to Traversos many times and have enjoyed each time until we tried the pizza tonight.  The dishes we have loved are bow tie pasta, cheese ravioli, chicken parm, and lasagna.  They have a very good craft beer menu.

This would be five stars if we had not had the pizza.  The crust is spongy.  The mushrooms are canned.  Both are pizza sins in my book."

The bread tastes like bread and is spongy like bread - not brick-like. They even have gluten free fried chicken - and it is crispy and AMAZING! My fiance, who does not have to eat gluten free, even liked all the gluten free goods that we tried, and having been with me for so many years he&#39;s tried a great deal of gluten free foods and knows what tastes good and what does not. The service was amazing, everyone was friendly, the restaurant is super clean, inviting and has a nice, comfy family atmosphere.

The inside ambiance, particularly lighting, is still great and the parking was ample. The bathrooms were in pretty decent shape as well. I sat in a booth on the bar side.

Since I had last graced this restaurant with my presence, they added a pretty nice gluten free menu. The chef really knows what he&#39;s doing. There are actually more than just two lousy entrées. There&#39;s fish, pizza, pasta, salads and other things that I like and now will be able to eat like a normal person. There&#39;s a wide variety of sauces from which to choose for pasta.

The service was a tad sluggish, but nothing to fret over. The server, Kelly, certainly made up for it.

Incidentally, there was a strong wi-fi signal on the north side of the building where I sat. However, it was very difficult, at first, to get my Samsung phone to connect. I love free wi-fi in restaurants. It&#39;s sort of like having paper towels in the bathrooms, rather basic. After some finagling on the part of the owner or manager, I finally got my phone to display web pages consistently. I hope that the owners and management will stay on top of this.

I ordered the chicken piccata with gluten free pasta and a mixed green salad.  The portion size on the chicken was huge. Enough for dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow. I was especially fond of the mixed greens salad. I enjoyed mine with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. The salad comes with delicious medium size tomatoes and fresh walnuts. Out of this world.

This place is off the beaten path a little, as it&#39;s not on Ogden Ave, 75th street, 95th street, or the Route 59 corridor in Naperville.  They feature Italian cuisine and our family eats there probably 4 times a year, and I wish it were more.  It&#39;s a very modern, darkly lit restaurant with separate bar area and is kid friendly (high chairs are available).  You can expect to see a lot of families here on any given evening, usually with adult males wearing golf or polo shirts, and the parking lot will be full of luxury cars built within the last 2 years.  Service is always consistent, and you will get good attention from your server.

Their fettuccini alfredo is an absolute masterpiece, and it simply does not get any better than this.  I always order it with grilled chicken and find the portion size to be well worth the value of $15 for the dish.  They hand make their ingredients in house, including the pasta, and the finished product is excellent and does not contain significant amounts of garlic (my preference).  Over time, I have had their burgers and Italian beef and both were excellent.  My wife and mother have had other various pasta and Italian dishes and have been very happy.  We usually order a pizza for the table, which also is excellent, cut in squares.  Bread and butter is complimentary, unlimited, and always arrives hot and fresh.  For dessert, they have a brownie, cookie &amp; ice cream sundae called &#34;goosey cake&#34; which is to die for, and I am sure it&#39;s 100 calories per bite.

Every time we eat there, the manager can be seen making his way throughout the restaurant talking to regulars and asking if everyone&#39;s meal was prepared properly.  You&#39;ll know him as he has a very deep voice.

They did pull a fast on us over the last year or two - they changed their soda provider are serving generic cola now (not Pepsi or Coke) and I can tell the difference.  I probably should not be drinking soda anyway, so it&#39;s not affecting my 5 star review!

Do yourself a favor and try this place if you have not already done so.  But don&#39;t tell too many people - I don&#39;t want this hidden gem to become overly popular so that I always have to wait to get a table :-)"

Okay, maybe it&#39;s only close if you don&#39;t get lost for 35 minutes trying to find it like we did. Man, did they tuck this sucker away. Google doesn&#39;t even know how to get there. 

I ended up getting off work early and really craving pizza; preferably from somewhere new, so I could yelp about it, but also close, so I could get pizza in my gubby ASAP. Traverso&#39;s appeared to be a bulls eye. 

It was about 8:30 when we got there and the place was packed. Our server looked really busy but she still took the time to come over and told us she&#39;d be with us in a moment and I totally appreciate that... plus those extra few moments while we waited were spent well by perusing the yummy dessert menu... but you&#39;ll hear about that later. 

For starters we got mozzarella sticks and a Caesar salad and both were great. The mozzarella sticks were the kind that have the solid crisp outer shell and then you bite and cheese oozes and stretches out but is still stuck to both the part in your hand and in your mouth (picture the Selma Blair / Sarah Michelle Gellar kiss from Cruel Intentions with the saliva strand from lip to lip), it&#39;s cheesy perfection! The salad was good, too, and perfect for two of us to split before a meal. 

For pizza, we got black olives and mushrooms with giardinaire on the side... thin crust, of course. The pizza was delicious and perfect. It had ultra thin crust, it was crispy, had a good topping ratio, and they gave us a hot and a mild side of giardinaire. We finished the whole thing and took a carry out menu so I could hint to my family that they should start ordering pizza from here. 

For dessert, I was torn between wanting their carmel apple crunch and their goosey cake... we went with goosey cake because it&#39;s more fun to say. Wondering what goosey cake is? Well, it&#39;s like a dessert you would make for yourself if you were 8 years old with chocolate brownie cake with a chocolate chip cookie pudding layer on top and then it&#39;s both surrounded and topped with LOTS of whipped cream and chocolate sauce and a cherry. It&#39;s kind of like a dessert swamp and it&#39;s was one of the most delicious things I&#39;ve ever eaten! 

I can&#39;t wait for Tuesday when I order pizza again... with enough leftovers for Wednesday of course."

My family has been eating there since back in Pullman / Roseland area decades ago. I&#39;ve always been a huge fan of their pizza and food. I have to say over the past few years prices have gone up and I&#39;ve been less satisfied with the quality and taste of the food.

Here&#39;s my complaints. You guys seem to change your garlic bread on a weekly basis, everytime I order it its different. I like the old style heavy garlic, now days one week its full of herbs, the next weeks its more of a wet garlicky bread the next week its a dry bread covered in herbs. The fries seem to change on a regular basis as well.

One my my biggest complaints is your meatball sandwhich and smaller serving sizes overall. You guys make the best meatballs you really do. Your meatball sandwhich used to be 3 or 4 heaping meatballs. Recently at there and there&#39;s these little ping pong ball size meatballs, it truly was pathetic and everyone at the table commented on it. Not only is it smaller serving for same price but smaller meatballs dry out unlike your big balls.

I&#39;m very disapointed with the direction traversos has gone in the past several years."

Made our way here, and got seated in 5 minutes.  Excellent!

Service was super friendly, especially after we told her we just moved into the area, and she was happy to give us some suggestions and insider tips on who to know and talk to for getting into other restaurants as well!

Mozzarella sticks appetizers:  Made for four... for the pricing, we figured we get a few, but I think they served us 11 or 13 of these things... good God, I was full before the main food even came!

Traverso&#39;s Pizza - Thin crust:  When we want thin crust, we want cracker thin crispy crust... this isn&#39;t it.  It&#39;s a mix of thin/chewy, and is an excellent crust by all means, but not the perfectly thin crackling crust that snaps with each bite that we enjoy.  And the biggest no-no for any pizza for me: canned mushrooms.  Granted, it seemed like higher quality canned mushrooms, but the mushrooms definitely seemed overly moist with each bite, something that I find only happens when they&#39;ve been soaking in liquid for too long.

No room for dessert, but the waitress let us know everything is homemade, so would be curious to go back for some tiramisu.

A great family joint, excellent laid back Italian-American style eating.

Verdict:  Would be back if in the area, and could see it being the kind of place you bring your kids to after a softball/baseball game or something."

I&#39;ve dined in plenty of times, but I prefer takeout. We get their Potato Skins or Buffalo Wings on occasion, both are solid. Their homemade soups are really good and their salads are pretty damn good too. The Antipasto is excellent, especially with their homemade Italian dressing. I just wish they cubed the meat and cheese instead of slicing it. It would work better for the salads overall Constancy. 

Their pastas are decent, but you could make better if you put in a little effort at home. Their pizzas good, but the crust is too thin. It cant handle a lot of ingredients very well. I&#39;d recommend only getting 1-3 (maximum) toppings. If the pizza cools down a little bit, it tastes light years better than when it&#39;s hot. That&#39;s a personal opinion though...

To finish, I&#39;ll go back to my childhood. You MUST order the Goosey Cake. I don&#39;t know what it is about that damn dessert, but it&#39;s got me hooked like a meat head and affliction t-shirts. 

Traversos is a neighborhood spot that has been around, and will be around, for decades. Oddly, I just saw the original for my first time. I love having this location so close by.

If you&#39;re planning to come here on a Friday/Saturday night, expect a crowd as a sizable line was forming at around 6 and the restaurant and adjacent strip mall parking lot were completely packed!  Thankfully, I was there for carryout.

Despite the crowd, everyone there was polite.  Got a medium thin crust with bacon for $14.00.  First thing I tasted was a flavor of oregano and salt from the bacon, which they put a lot of on the pizza.  However, the saltiness was starting to become too much as it overpowered any other flavor I would of tasted.  

Traverso&#39;s seemed to be a slightly-higher class restaurant, judging from their prices.  

Pizza was good, but the best in town, which is an overused statement, might be pushing it a little."

The decor was typical of many of the old timey places you find in big cities, and the clientele seemed familiar to the staff, and the servers themselves were friendly and helpful. 

The food was very good. We had the pizza, which was thin crust done very well. I also ordered a veal dish, because I am an abhorrent glutton who particularly loves the taste of young cow. The veal was tender and well prepared. The fresh bread, as many other reviews have stated, was totally top. I like. I love it. I want some more of it.

Whenever, we we are in the mood for thin crust or we have out of state guests visiting, we end up going to Traverso&#39;s. It can get crowded on the weekends, but it is worth the wait. We will sometimes eat in the large bar area which is much less crowded than the restaurant area. Beware, if you have young kids, the bar seems to have some crusty, &#34;salty&#34; regulars. Thankfully, the no smoking ban makes the bar more appealing than in the past. 

This is a standard family restaurant, no real frills as far as decor. A lot of dark wood, booths, low lighting and waitresses that call you hon. I would be hesitant to go here on a date night, but if you have kids they are very accommodating. One of my favorite things is that they use paper tablecloths and give out crayons. Hangman, Tic tac toe, doodling are all great ways to pass the time while waiting for your pizza!

As far as their other dishes, especially their pastas, give it a wide PASS. For some reason, the pasta noodles are always undersalted, overcooked and mushy. We have learned this the hard way after ordering ravioli and spaghett a few times. Note to the restaurant, add salt to the boiling water, cook al dente,  and drain your pasta really well before serving it on a plate. Nothing is more unappealing than ravioli in a tomatoey, watery bath.

Pricewise, their pizza can be a bit more expensive than some places. However, we think the quality is worth the price. We like Traverso&#39;s pizza and plan on going back again and again."

So I headed onto Yelp for a quick peak at what might be a good choice. After reading several good reviews for Traverso&#39;s we decided to check it out. 

When we first got there it was a little weird because the bar was stuffed with people, but there was only one table of people actually eating in the dining room. It took a few minutes for them to notice us waiting by the door - but once they did we were asked if we wanted bar or dining room. We chose the dining room - because the bar area was pretty noisy for a small place. 

We ordered a large sausage and mushroom. I asked if they could please make the crust crispy. Our waitress said, &#34;Oh course!&#34;. I was pleased with her response. If you&#39;ve read any of my reviews before you know I&#39;m searching for the perfect thin crust CRISPY pizza near my home and still haven&#39;t found it  Anyway, when it arrived it was on a pizza pie tin and the pizza was on an oven rack. This is brilliant because it helps to keep the crust crispy longer. The pizza was piping hot, super crispy and not burnt. The cheese, sausage and mushrooms were all fresh and great quality. I wasn&#39;t 100% in love with the sauce but it was good. 

We then finished with the caramel apple crunch. It was delicious, warm, gooey and just perfect. 

Our waitress Wendi, was very good. She was attentive, checked on us often enough but was not annoying. She was helpful with the menu, told us about the wonderful desserts and told us to come back and try the homemade ravioli (which we will). She also gave us directions back to the expressway - that were perfect!

I also want to give a shout-out to Candice G. because of her review we chose Traverso&#39;s, and we&#39;re glad we did. 

I don&#39;t know when we&#39;ll next be in Naperville, but when we are we&#39;ll be back to Traverso&#39;s.

Verdict: Great, crispy thin pizza, give it a try.

And yes this is the same Traverso&#39;s that&#39;s in Orland Park, it&#39;s a family business. The family still makes the sauces and doesn&#39;t share the recipes you gotta love that."

I have had numerous things from this pace. First I tried their ravioli - which I couldn&#39;t even finish because it was so bad. I&#39;ve also had the chicken parm - which is also lackluster. I&#39;ve gotten pizza from the place a few times tool...and it&#39;s ok - not great...and somewhat overpriced - In fact over the last 7 years of living across the street, i&#39;ve only gotten pizza from the place like 3 times.

Now I heard of Traverso&#39;s but never actually tried it. Now you might see the &#34;Naperville&#34; location but if it&#39;s any further south it would be Plainfield or in Bolingbrook a little further east). If you&#39;re not familiar with the area, you have the following choices: 
1. Get directions before you go. 
2. Have your GPS ready to go and properly programmed. 
3. Be prepared to get lost, especially if you&#39;re not familiar with the area. Make sure your tank is full. 

So now you finally arrive. The place is pretty comfortable. The staff are very nice folks to deal with. I don&#39;t frequent this place much because I&#39;m not in that area much. However, I would eat there if I was in the area. What I heard about Traverso&#39;s is that they have a solid pizza. I&#39;m more of a deep dish guy myself so for me to endorse a thin crust pizza, it might be worth a try. Traverso&#39;s has a VERY good thin crust. The toppings are also very generous (I normally eat sausage and mushroom). The crust is nice, light, crisp but (here&#39;s the kicker) not overcooked. That&#39;s what gets me about thin crust pizza is places burn the bottom a bit much. That&#39;s not the case here. Next time (budget permitting), I may go with the Traverso&#39;s Signature (sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, and onions) or add garlic. I might try a pasta dish next time should I not want pizza. My last visits have been takeout. Family owner and operated. 

4-4 1/2 stars from me."

Well, the pizza was pretty good.  I liked the sweet sauce and thin crust.  The crust wasn&#39;t crispy though....it was mushy.

Yes there was Sausage, and Mushroom....but not as much as you get from a Nancy&#39;s, Beggars, Giordano&#39;s......it was good, but there wasn&#39;t much substance.

The pizza has a really good flavor to it and will keep you coming back.  Their minestrone is definitely a favorite of mine.

This family has been making pizza on the south side of Chicago for years as detailed at http://www.traversosrestaurant.com/ and have really kept up a great tradition.  If you are hoping to find pizza similar to the Traverso&#39;s in Orland Park or the former restaurant at 111th St, you won&#39;t be disappointed."

Nothing to rave about, but also nothing to complain too much about.  I have had much better and much worse- in terms of taste, service, prices.

We went on a Saturday night at 6:00 and were pleasantly surprised to only wait for 5-10 minutes for a table of 4.  We had:
Thin crust pizza-  Good, but not as fantastic as some of the other reviews would make you think.  Other places in town- notably Vito &amp; Nick&#39;s- are clearly better.
Lasagna- Not very good at all.  They list it as lasagna bolognese, which would make you think it has a bolognese sauce.  Incorrect.  It was a lot of noodles and a lot of ricotta, with some meat sauce on top.  Definitely stay away from this dish.  The caesar salad they gave with it was excellent.
Caramel Apple Crunch- Quite tasty.

Service was spotty.  The waittress was very friendly but disappeared for long periods of time.

All in all- not a place I would recommend as there are places very close-by that have better pasta and/or better pizza."

My mother and I ate here 4 nights a week when my dad was out of town - pasta, minestrone soup, salad, and bread - these were the staples.  At that time it was a low key, not crowded place to go, we tried a few weekends ago to go for dinner but it just looked far too busy to wait (especially since my house is two blocks away).

Defintely give this one a try, it will surprise you with its plain brick exterior, can&#39;t judge a book by its cover."

I had driven by the place a bunch of times and by the looks of the outside, I would believe their pizza should be pretty good.  Let me start with the good points first.

Good points - The pizza is decent, not great, just decent.  It is a little different compared to most places in the area by it being very thin.  I will not fault them for it being so thin as their menu does say it is thin.  The pizza appears to have used pretty fresh ingredients, just not many as I will explain later.  

Bad points - The pizza is way overpriced for what you get.  I paid $18 for a large pizza with 1 ingredient.  Crazy prices.  The pizza barely had any sauce nor did it have much of the additional ingredient.  The cheese looked like plastic.  It had no taste to it.  

I have had frozen pizzas that tasted way better than this one.  I was really hoping that this would be a good place for pizza being that it is so close to my house.  Unfortunately I have to keep looking for another place.  I will not order from them again, nor will I ever dine in there.  They could be great considering there is no good pizza in the area.  With those prices and the looks of their current pizza, they will never get there. I don&#39;t know what the other reviewers saw that I didn&#39;t.  A shame."

We had a taste for pizza and thin crust is our preference so we gave it a try.  It is VERY good pizza.  Our previous favorite place was Connie&#39;s.  Compared to Connie&#39;s, Traverso&#39;s sausage tastes better and there is more of it on the pizza.  We also shared an antipasto salad.  It was huge with a light oil and wine vinegar dressing.  I know that I am going backwards here but the warm bread that proceeded the salad was very good as well.  We sat in the bar room which has a nice warm feeling.  We sat in a booth but the chairs at the tables looked very comfortable.  Unusual for a place like this.  We&#39;ll be back."

The other people in my party either enjoyed their entrees very much, or thought it was just alright as well.  Because of our delayed ordering and receiving process (on our end, because we had spent a good amount of time drinking, and on theirs because it was a busy friday night), I wasn&#39;t in the mood to have them fix the issue.  Well, my stomach wasn&#39;t anyway.  Someone else in my party notified the server of my soggy chicken and she came back offering dessert, and we decided to have some port.  They had a good wine selection, her input on the port wines were extensive and appreciated, they were also very delicious :)  The bill was what was expected (5 people, $200+), and I&#39;d definitely try it again."

Weird, I know, but I just could not go on with my day until I ate some southern biscuits. Nothing came to mind accept KFC (hard pass), so I of course turned to my good friend Yelp. Low and behold 7 minutes away was Mr. Broast awaiting my visit!

I stopped in with the intention of only getting a side order of biscuits, but once that smell of delicious fried chicken hit my nose you best believe I was ordering a full meal. To make myself feel better, I went with a 3 piece value meal because it sounded like it would be a smaller option. I chose two wings and one breast and the meal comes with fries and a beverage (they have a fridge with cans of pop, water, etc.). The value meal and my side order of 3 biscuits came out to about $10.

I&#39;m pretty sure the biscuits from Mr. Broast are sent straight from heaven. They are flaky, buttery, and have some sort of sweet and light glaze melted on them. UNBELIEVABLE. It&#39;s only going to be trouble that I now am aware of these delicious little beauties and that I live less than 10 minutes away.

The chicken is bomb dot com as well. The skin is crunchy and amazing and the chicken itself is juicy and tender. I ate 2 biscuits, half the fries and just the chicken breast they gave me and was more than full. Hubbie finished off the two chicken wings, last biscuit and rest of the fries. It&#39;s safe to say their chicken breasts are pretty huge and a meal like this is plenty to be split between two.

On their website you can place your order ahead of time and I suggest doing this! I popped in on a whim so it took about 20 minutes for them to get my order ready. Luckily, Mr. Broast is located in a strip mall with a ton of other businesses so if you do happen to pop in there&#39;s plenty to browse while you wait for your order. They also have tables, chairs, and a TV if you want to hang out in the restaurant.

Can&#39;t wait to enjoy Mr. Broast again soon!"

the order...:  we ordered the 12 piece chicken and 2 sides with biscuits, the sides were seasoned fries,, and caliuflower  the rating on a 1-10  10 the best./.

CHICKEN:  strong bold and very SPICY taste ALMOST 2 spicy...very juicy...     8

Biscuits:    very awesome  flakey  with   beautiful honey butter melted in.........9

fried Cauliflower :   awesome......10   complete with many dipping sauces.

.................................................................................................................................

the negative  the pieces of chicken were 12  HOWEVER  3-4 of them were tiny wings and the price of  the 12 for 19 bucks was a bit pricey  

total bill 37.00  for this being a carry out,, this was very expensive and cannot recoomend the value to the price..  going out and sitting down i can think of 5 restraunts right off the bat that are cheaper with more food at higher quality..

service:  i DID like the lady  who answered very patient and explained everything great././

Zinger Chicken Sandwich $6.50 - This sandwich is great and has a little spicy kick to it.

I think the Zinger burger is overrated or they just mess it up here. I barely tasted the sauce and parts of my sandwich were very dry. The fries are not as good as the other locations. Actually, the fries are pretty bad here. 

The gyros was average, it wasn&#39;t bad but it wasn&#39;t extraordinary. It was good enough to fill me up, but it&#39;s not something I&#39;d go out of the way before. 

My favorite was the bun kabob. They add a desi style omelet right above the kabob which I really liked. However, they call it bun kabob but it tastes more like shami. For those who don&#39;t know what that is, it&#39;s beef and more &#34;mushier&#34; then a kabob."

The Zinger Burger tastes just like how fireworks look.  Slightly dangerous but wowee so amazing. Yeah, I said &#34;wowee.&#34; Deal with it.  

Somehow they managed to have the juiciest chicken breast ever.  It&#39;s all fried and spicy and laid out on a soft sesame seed bun. But oh wait! Then they add this crazy sauce that&#39;s like mayo but with the flavor and crunch of giardiniera!  The fries have perfect crunch and spice to them as well. Basically they are the perfect couple now that Bennifer is over.  

As far as service, I ordered over the phone and picked the order up.  The food was obviously freshly made, so I&#39;d expect that if I just ordered at the counter, there&#39;d be a wait. Totes worth it."

I don&#39;t know, because I ordered from here through delivery.com: just wings and a biscuit. It did take every minute of the estimated hour for it to get to me, but was still hot upon arrival. 

I ordered &#34;wings&#34; (higher on the delivery menu) because I didn&#39;t see the &#34;wingettes&#34; (like drummies, I guess?). It was more food than I needed, and the wingette order is cheaper (obviously), so be aware of this. (If you are on their online ordering menu, you must scroll down much further to see the wingettes.)

Also be aware: for broasted chicken this is spicy! (These are not sauced wings like Buffalo Wild Wings, by the way, but breaded.) 

So overall, it wasn&#39;t bad, just not the meal I expected. Next time I&#39;d be more likely to get the regular broasted chicken. They also have burgers, gyros and some other offerings that I wouldn&#39;t have thought of based on the restaurant&#39;s name.

The zinger burger wasn&#39;t that great compared to their Lombard location and had almost no spicy kick to it, I actually added a bit of hot sauce to it try try to get some tingle on my tongue.
   The above mentioned things contributed to the low rating but what pushed it over the top was the fact that they had no bathroom or even a sink to wash your hands, how can you not have those facilities as a dine in restaurant? To make matters worse was the fact that my 4 year old had an emergency and all they did was smile and apologize for not having a bathroom, they obviously had an employee bathroom and as a level headed person I completely understand that they don&#39;t want the customers using it, but any decent human being would make an exception for a 4 year old.

When I arrived an hour before closing the place had a decent amount of customers-empty restaurants scare me, so I was happy. We ordered the 6 piece fried wings for $7.99.What I like about this place is the wings are large, and you get a LOT of fries, you can definitely share a 6 piece wing order with someone if you have a normal appetite.

The wings have a nice flavor and if you taste them right away they are really juicy. I ate one in the car that was juicy, but when I tasted another one 30 minutes later all the juicy yumminess was gone. The fries are good, but while my chicken was fresh, they fries were not. Everyone seems to like the fries, but you can get those same fries at Jewel(Orange bag, Jewel brand seasoned fries) I buy them all the time. The chicken was also good cold.

My companion said that the chicken was average, but he is used to eating overcooked TINY wings from Harold&#39;s. For the price,taste,and the amount of food given-This place is great. I did not go inside so I can&#39;t comment on that, but while I waited in the car I noticed a lot of people coming from the back alley, me being nosey I had to check it out, turns out there is an apartment building in the back and people use the alley as a shortcut."

The person who took my order was very friendly and the prices were about on par with this type of establishment.  I ordered the Zinger Chicken Sandwich, which is what they are known for.  Please be aware this is not fast food, I waited about 10-15 minutes for my food to be ready.  The food was good quality and cooked just right, but here is where my review dilemma starts, it just wasn&#39;t my cup of tea.  The zinger sauce was disgusting and the zinger fries were just okay (like Arby&#39;s curly fries without the curl).

Ordered: the fried shrimp was the bomb. They were huge. I was expecting them to be the typical lame but trustworthy shrimp you get from anywhere else. They were not. If you ever tried Chicagoland infamous Lawrence&#39;s shrimp or goose island shrimp -then you will like these. I like the batter better with mr. Broast. I do have a drawback. I&#39;m wondering since they didn&#39;t show up like the typical fried trustworthy shrimp-did I give them to much credit. I&#39;ll order again to let you know. Lol

Fried cat fish: EXCELLENT AND HUGE (trust my review with this one)no flaky batter. The fish tasted clean and really fresh. Will order more soon. 3 pieces doesn&#39;t sound like a lot but the fillets are so big, you will have left overs. 

Broasted chicken: my family says it&#39;s great. I wouldn&#39;t know because they make it tooooooo spicy and I can&#39;t eat spicy. They don&#39;t have a non spicy option and this&#39;s why they are receiving 4 stars from me. It&#39;s stupid. Not everyone eat spicy food. It&#39;s silly to believe that &#34;spicy&#34; s the majority vote. 

Fries: tooooooooo spicy. Ate one and almost had to go to hospital. 
The spicy food is even to spicy for my family members who eat spicy. 

Gyro: I must say I have never ever ever had a gyro like there&#39;s. I love gyros. 
So when there gyro popped up-It was looking shady. I didn&#39;t know what meat they were trying to serve me. The texture was crazy soft. Dude-hat gyro almost got tossed. I turned it into a science project. I had it laid out and inspecting it like forensics. I just don&#39;t eat anything. 
So my husband gets annoyed and takes the meat to taste. He def thought it was lamb. So I assembled it back together (lettuce/tomato/diced onion). I was going in folks..... THE BEST GYRO EVER. The pita was soft. The gyro meat was really tender tender tender. The set back-the sauce they say is tziki
Sauce tastes like mayo. I ordered the gyro again and requested that to be taken off."

But if you&#39;re gonna go, make sure to try what is the star of their menu - the Zinger burger. A hearty sized portion of broast chicken breast served on a bed of delicious coleslaw, and you can determine what kind of heat you want on it, and they&#39;ll adjust their special sauce accordingly! Also, their broast chicken by itself is pretty amazing too, and a delicious alternative to good, old fried chicken.

I had the Zinger Burger (actually a chicken sandwich) and the wife had a two piece dark meal. The chicken has a mild spice to it, by my Southern tastes. I will say, it is the best fried chicken I have had in the area. It is far superior to places such as White Fence Farms. The accompanying fries are very good seasoned fries. They were cooked perfectly. If this review were for food alone, it would be five stars.

Now, as for the facility itself. They desperately need to move or expand. The current space has no openly accessible restroom (I assume you have to ask to enter the kitchen to access one). Also, there is no effort at all to decorate the dining room. The addition of some photos or art would help. There also needs to be some music or a TV, it was eerily quiet in there. 

In summary, fantastic food served in a horrible space. Go try it, but maybe eat your food in the car!"

I think their burger patties are made from freshly ground beef, as it tastes a lot better than the usual frozen patties many places have. But overall, the food is delicious. And the fries are seasoned and tasty too.

Gyro meat looked like the kind that is pre-made in a package and warmed up. Not the kind from the mystery meat wheel, which is what a gyro should be. Had some chopped sauteed onions and a small blob of the sauce. Portion was small and not very good.

If you like buttermilk biscuits, you will love these.  They are very light and fluffy and served with just the right amount of butter and honey.  Allow about 15 minutes for the chicken to cook, so you may want to call in your order.

The chicken breading was also spicier than my pallet enjoys.  The meat however was very good and moist.  
Be prepared to wait for your meal as everything is cooked to order.

The food order process was the worst experience I ever had with any place.

My advice to them , do not try to lure customers if your coupon price is the same as the menu price.
Next , never say you would not honor the coupon when you have the validity date, the consumer bureau would not like it.

The owner replied with an apology and asked me to give the place another try.

Zinger burger is the best I&#39;ve had in a long time, very flavorful juicy and fried golden brown (you can get it spicy/ regular), it beats KFC/ Popeyes any day! 
Also, coming from Philly, this is probably the best Philly steak sandwich I&#39;ve had since I&#39;ve been here (they also offer Philly steak panini which I thought was pretty cool). The Philly steak is not slathered with a bunch of mayo, I think they put just the right amount of everything in to make it nice. Fries are very well seasoned and similar to Arby&#39;s seasoned curly fries although these aren&#39;t curly, and in my opinion these are perfect (I hate bland fries, makes me feel like I&#39;m eating straight potato.)
Note: if you have any problems to spicy foods, let them know ahead of time as they make everything fresh to order. Personally I don&#39;t mind the 7 minute wait time when food comes out incredibly fresh. I got my food to go, and by the time I got home, there was still steam coming out of the chicken, just amazing! 
Funnel cake is oh so sweet! If you ask them to make it a funnel cake sundae the way you see at street fairs, they&#39;re more than happy to accommodate you. We got ours with vanilla Ice cream and chocolate syrup! 
The people that work at this establishment are the most friendliest and welcoming people I&#39;ve seen (girl behind the counter always greets me with the warmest smile). 

Facility: It&#39;s nice that they have a big screen tv up against the wall for everyone to watch and be entertained. The facility itself is kept very clean but the small space gives the appearance of it to be a lemon. (I know they&#39;re in a strip mall so it might be difficult to expand, but I only say this for ease of accessibility to use the restroom and to be able to dine in with larger groups). They do keep a huge bottle of hand sanitizer up at the front when you walk in which is pretty decent of them. You can tell that for a small restaurant, they&#39;re making a lot of effort to keep their customers happy.
(sometimes you can only do the best with what you have)
The nice thing is that they deliver within a 10 mile radius! So if you don&#39;t want to dine in, carryout is not your only option depending on where you live, you may be able to get delivery as well."

We ordered a chicken sandwich and a gyro with some sides to go. We were told it would be about 20 minutes which was fine since they seemed to have some orders building up. At the 40 minute mark I asked what the situation was with our order. Other orders had been coming in and going out so we thought maybe one of our items was just taking a longer then expected time to cook. Oh no, our food had been done 20 minutes prior and had been given out with another take out order! At this point we were starving and ready to leave so I asked for a refund. The lady at the counter was nice but the person she was talking to in the kitchen (possibly either the owner or manager) never said a word to us, only talked to her, and he made absolutely NO attempt to apologize to us. They did refund our money and the lady at the front counter did sincerely apologize to us which we appreciated. However, since our business apparently means little to nothing to anyone else in there, we will not be going back. It could be the best food I&#39;ve ever tasted but if I never get it after I order it is pretty hard to review. So based on our service experience I can not recommend this place. We have considered doing a phone order and seeing how turns out but then again we don&#39;t want to suffer another disappointment."

The Peri Peri chicken is tasty, though truthfully I could do better on my grill at home.  It just isn&#39;t as flavorful as it could be.  The fried chicken is good too and is definitely a step above KFC or Popeyes.  The Zinger sandwich that they are apparently known for is really gross though, it&#39;s just a fried chicken breast on a boring bun with, as they described it to me, their own special sauce (tasted like thousand island dressing, gross) and a little bit of cabbage.  I had to scrape off the sauce and drench the sandwich in hot sauce to make it palatable.  The meat in the gyros is the same presliced garbage that comes in those kits at the grocery.  Why put something on the menu if you&#39;re going to half ass it?  The most notable thing about Mr. Broast are the lunch specials.  You get a wrap or sandwich with fries and a drink for 6.50 and the portions are generous.  Just be careful which sandwich you order."

So many better options than some of the other chain sandwich shops around here. Lots of veggie options. Nice, clean interior with a good amount of seating for a sandwich place. Daily soup offerings. Breakfast sandwiches are served all day, which is unusual and much appreciated. Quick service. I got one of the tuna salad options and it was delicious- fresh veggies, not too much mayo, and thick fluffy bread."

I&#39;d assume that I ordered the wrong stuff, but then looking at few other reviews here, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case!  I ordered Chicken cutlet sandwich and I can almost guarantee you that A chicken sandwich at any Wendy&#39;s is about 10 times better than theirs!  It was a pre fried/breaded chicken piece tossed on an Italian bread and heated in a microwave!  Seasoning, cheese and if there was anything else on it, could barley be tasted! 

Tried once and done forever!  There are better places to eat in downtown Naperville!"

However, it wasn&#39;t anything special. I ordered a turkey wrap, as it sounded good, but it was average. The wrap was flaky and didn&#39;t seem to be super fresh. There wasn&#39;t anything special about the experience at all. They have the same stuff as Einstein, but Einstein&#39;s wraps are fantastic. Halsted would be better if they are known for something--a sandwich or other item. I&#39;ll give it another shot, but I wasn&#39;t impressed."

My boyfriend and I order a chicken parm and the State St. Sandwich. The atmosphere is amazing and the service is quick. Took about less than 10 minutes for us to get our food after stepping foot through the door. They have a great arrangement of Sinatra playing in the background which really adds to the atmosphere of the place. The pricing is great and that&#39;s a lot coming from a college student!

I ordered a Ruben and was disappointed.  It wasn&#39;t grilled, rather pressed in a panini grill which only toasted the bread and the contents inside were cold. There was only 2 slices of corned beef, looked like a half slice of cheese, a dollop of dressing and hardly any sauerkraut.  Very disappointing, I was hoping to see a great deli in downtown Naperville. Too pricy for what you get."

I haven&#39;t reviewed it because the first time that I ate there, I said to myself,  THIS MUST BE A FLUKE, because most all the eating places in downtown Naperville are lame, unless you are willing to spend like $25 $35 maybe $45 for your lunch, and even then it can be a crap shoot. (You know this if you have read my other reviews). Now I would not say that they serve a sandwich as good as you can make at home, but for food out, the six or seven things I&#39;ve tried have all been as good as I&#39;ve had out, and this place is clearly in the top 3 or 4 lunch destinations in downtown Naperville. They have a large menu,  so its taking me a while to work my way through it, but so far so good,  I&#39;ll go back again, and there are few places to eat in the Naperville downtown that I can say that about. P.S. I wish they would start selling Gyros, I shouldn&#39;t, (and won&#39;t typically) drive 4-5 miles to get a good one."

Ordered the cornbeef on onion bagel.  Wow it was soooo good.  The price was very reasonable for dt naperville.  The owner was in on the day we went in and he told us that if we like the corn beef that we would really like the pastrami.  he even gave us a free sample :).  he was a really nice guy.  If they keep up the quality like they did over the weekend I will definitely become a regular.

As soon as I walked in the girls were so friendly and kind. I felt welcome and comfortable once I walked inside. 

The burger was absolutely hands down one of the best burgers I&#39;ve had here in Lockport area. I would most definitely recommend this burger. If you can push yourself to look past the appearance of the place, you&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised!"

1- despite the simple PDF menu online, there are all sorts of fun variations once you step inside their corner locale (which is in need of major upkeep, but that&#39;s on the landlord). The Star Wars sandwiches, the seasonal varieties, and...

2- the shakes. I can&#39;t say enough how awesome the shakes are. Between customizing from a huge flavor variety, pulling from their highly creative offerings, or finally slurping a chunk of topping through their oversized straws, you must get a shake. Current faves are pumpkin and the breakfast one (French toast?).

3- price is perfect. I got 3 meals and 2 shakes for $30, with some leftovers.

4- indoor atmosphere is quirky and cool, like your favorite dive bar. Hair metal trading cards, a massive local business wall, and the breezeway for summer chow.

Only minor complaint is the service, but this is dependent on the individual. The owner is always super friendly, same with the taller blonde who has been there forever. 2x in 2 weeks I&#39;ve had the taller brunette with the lip piercing and she isn&#39;t unfriendly, but just looks at you like &#34;please just order&#34; even though they aren&#39;t busy. But it&#39;s a tiny flaw. 4.5 stars?"

There was nothing to dip except 5 coin cut jalapeno pieces and a mixture of fried bread crumbs. We found maybe 6 - 8 tiny onion slivers mixed in with the fried bread crumbs. We could not eat it and threw it away! The chef must have had a bad day!

Burger: was ok. Would eat it again, but not to go out of my way for. 

Fried pickles: I would have preferred more crispy. Good flavor but kind of flimsy. 

Read some great reviews in their shakes but noticed they had the soft-serve machine. So shakes are not real ice cream. Awesome shakes, I&#39;m sure. But I only like real ice cream shakes, so did not order. 

Service: Awesome, very friendly. Cashier asked how everything was mid-meal."

We ordered the bacon chicken ranch wrap thingy and split it with garlic fries. It. Was. Amazing. After seeing another customer leave with a milkshake we decided we needed one too.

I saw a post on Facebook where customers had positive things to say about it.  Happy to hear it, I chimed in on FB that I would make the stop that evening and check the place out.  A person representing this establishment on FB even commented back to me on the FB thread about &#34;seeing me later&#34;.

I pulled up behind the building and walked towards the entrance.  It is a very small place, I would consider the size fairly common for a hotdog/takeout place.  They did have a small covered area where I saw two (maybe three) small tables set up for anyone wanting to eat indoors (it wasn&#39;t a bad setup).

There is a number of items on the menu, including a large choice of slushes/ice cream/shake options.  All looked appealing on the menu.  It was after 7pm and I opted for the Maxwell polish (usually my favorite when going to a &#34;hotdog&#34; establishment).

The girl at the register was pleasant and took my order quickly.  The polish and fry was only $3.98 (really cheap in my opinion, Portillo&#39;s charges me about $8).  My order was ready quickly and I left with my carry out.  Arriving at home minutes later,  I opened the bag and started eating.  Into the first bite of the polish, I noticed it had a &#34;water-logged&#34; taste to it. . I opened it up to find it dried out on the end and really water/steam shriveled, with a lukewarm temperature.  It was not good.  I took a picture of it and texted it to my husband telling him I would be eating leftovers from the night before because my pick up this evening was terrible.  I threw the food away and didn&#39;t fret it, as it only cost $4 and the drive wasn&#39;t really out of my way.  Definitely won&#39;t order that again, but hadn&#39;t completely written this place off (we&#39;ve all had a terrible meal somewhere, where we know others have not had the same experience).  Anyhow, minutes later the representative posted on the FB thread following up on my experience &#34;I hope it was fantastic!&#34;.  I responded on the same FB thread that the experience was pleasant but the food I received.....was not good.  I even went as far as commenting that maybe the salad or beef would&#39;ve been a better option and shared with them the picture of what they sold me.  (I certainly wasn&#39;t offensive in my post, just gently honest).  Sometime later that evening I got a FB notification from another employee (possibly the girl at the register), responding on the thread that my experience is &#34;insane&#34; and that their motto is to provide the best food (I wish I would&#39;ve  taken a picture if this poor response).  Feeling as if this young lady was implying my post was untruthful, I responded to her remark advising her that &#34;that is a great motto but most definately wasn&#39;t utilized when they put my food in the bag&#34;.  Being somewhat slided the next morning, I went back to my FB notifications to make a picture of the employee&#39;s comment to amusingly share with my spouse, I see they deleted the post entirely.  This was likely done to keep other customers from seeing it.  I was never reached out to by management in hopes to rectify the experience.

Unfortunately, I did give this place a try.  I hadn&#39;t written them off after the food I received was terrible (thinking maybe next time it will be better).  After the &#34;that&#39;s insane&#34; comment...eh, I won&#39;t be back. I feel  they really handled this situation poorly, even when the customer was overly understanding."

My husband went by himself to pick it up, so I personally didn&#39;t see the place. He said it was small and there are only a couple small tables to dine in at. 

I opened the container that my burger was in, and was impressed with what I saw. They had a toasted bun, and then under the toasted bun was the burger sitting on top of a piece of regular white bread. They do this so the burger doesn&#39;t get soggy and the bun is still toasted! I&#39;ve never seen this before. The burger wad good and so was my soup. My husband was extremely impressed with his steak sandwich, which came on garlic bread. He said it was probably the best he ever had and beats out Pops and Mickey&#39;s (our normal go to places). The cheese fries were also delicious. Can&#39;t wait to go back and try out other items."

Like everyone says, the burgers are fantastic, but I almost never get them because there are so many other great choices. The Angry Bird (buffalo chicken) Sandwich is amazing. I eat a LOT of Buffalo Chicken sandwiches and this might be the best I&#39;ve ever had. For whatever reason, I like the sandwich better than the wrap they sometimes offer. 

The other option I usually go for is a salad. They are really good, with generous amounts of the good stuff. 

A small, local place where everything is homemade and the owner is great. You really can&#39;t beat it."

She does a lot of community outreach and gives back so much. The staff has always been friendly and they remember you when you come back. I&#39;m amazed that she goes above and beyond to give such great customer service! For take out she will send you home with white bread between the buns so they don&#39;t get soggy (never seen that before but it&#39;s genius) also shout out to the jalapeño ranch that Mervet makes fresh for me!

It was a small restaurant that seemed more geared to carryout but you could sit along the wall against a counter or they had some tables in what looked like a screened in porch.  It defintely had a local vibe.  They even allow local businesses ti put their cards and flyers on the walls.  I was excited to try the food from such good reviews.  My daughter got a beef which she liked and I thought was good too.  The flavor reminded me of portillos.  My 2 sons ordered burgers.  One of my sons was ok with the burger and the other thought it was dry and overcooked.  I got a grilled chicken sandwich that was pretty dry.  It was not something I would order again.  I will come back again as I think it was just an off night.  They had some really neat looking burgers on the chalkboard behind the counter I would like to try.  The girl that took our order and staff was very friendly.

Having driven past several times, my initial assumption/impression was just another hotdog joint. My assumption was way off. The place looks a bit dated from the outside but was nice, exceptionally clean on the inside. Their menu contains a plethora of choices, sure to satisfy even the fussiest of eaters. While I waited for my food, the items that were handed out looked pretty darn good. Food arrived fresh/hot with good flavor &amp; served with a friendly smile. The young ladies behind the counter were on the ball &amp; very friendly/efficient. The chili cheese fries looked amazing, and are/were according to the fellow (I had to ask) that ordered them. Appears to be a family run small business that works hard, serving up quality food. I pass by many choices for food options during my day. I try my best to frequent the American small business owners whenever possible. These folks put their heart/soul into their business &amp; it really shows here at Sizzles. These American small business owners that are earning it, should receive our support &amp; our business. These folks work hard providing superior quality/service. By patronizing their establishments, we are also keeping the money in our neighborhoods. I choose to support places like Sizzles &amp; other local American small business owners. I&#39;ll be back real soon.."

The food, the service, the price, and the amount of food you get is all amazing!!! They are very helpful and willing to work with you on what you want or don&#39;t want with your food. If you have a suggestion they listen and might even use it and keep it as a menu item. 

 Now don&#39;t go in and expect to place your order and step over and be handed your food. This food is all made fresh and made to order. There will be a wait and because they want to make it the best and freshest for you. Believe me, this food is worth the wait! 

If there is any complaints about anything having to do with this establishment than that person is bitter, miserable and lacks excitement and joy in life that when experience something so grand they have to bitch about it just to make themselves feel bigger.

Sizzles should be the only choice when you want to go out for a meal.

Love them!"

Sure it beats the McD/BK nightmare but it certainly is expensive for the quality. After I tried the place once and really wanted to love it (because the staff is awesome) I decided to give it 3 more chances. Each time the food was soggy, greasy, and nothing more than the average food service/out of the can quality.  I know a lot of people enjoy this place but I just can&#39;t understand why (aside from the service which is good). All in all I wouldn&#39;t discourage someone from giving it a shot but if you&#39;re expecting a &#34;unique&#34;  version of some classic fast food favorites sizzles won&#39;t be it. 
My husband does not like the food at sizzles at all, and he usually could care less about what he eats. He likes places like olive garden and even the dogs and pizza at speedway so I question his palate in the first place, but it&#39;s rare he&#39;d specify not to go somewhere because he doesn&#39;t like the food."

I ate in. Good atmosphere, interesting community board. People were friendly, menu had enough items.

In addition to the good burgers I&#39;ve had a few other sandwiches now that were even better. Their sandwich of the month tends to be really good, the meatball one from a while back especially. The current one for December is a donut burger which is... exactly what it sounds like. I haven&#39;t tried it, but I&#39;m morbidly curious enough to soon. They are also branching out into more ice cream creations. Their simple versions of the blizzard are good, and they have some really solid shake flavors too. I recommend a blackberry shake with oreos. She makes all the ice cream in house too, which is neat.

Lockport needs more small outfits who are making an effort like this. Get out and support folks, its good stuff."

I must admit I thought it would be just like all of the other burger/fries restaurants in town.  But this place has a uniqueness to it and everything was really fresh.  The woman who took our order was the nicest lady.  I had a burger and it was perfectly cooked medium rare as requested.  My wife had the Angry Bird chicken sandwich and said it was really good.  I tried my daughter&#39;s chicken tenders and they were great and appeared to be homemade.  They also have fried pickles and I don&#39;t know anywhere in town that has those.  I will definitely be back and I&#39;m really glad we have a place like this in town.

I was pretty underwhelmed. The interior has been redone since the &#39;upscale&#39; lounge moved out and the changes are not good ones. I was disappointed with how cheap the interior looked. The crowd was older and it was not very busy on a Saturday night. My friends and I didn&#39;t order any food, just drinks so I can&#39;t comment on the food here. I did look at the menu and it was typical bar food. So, I&#39;d probably never come here to eat. This is a pretty big space but the layout is kind of weird. The video gaming machines take up one entire wall and there was a back area with a bunch of supplies on a shelving unit in plain sight. Another table had boxes and random things all over it. The lights were pretty bright in there so it was easy to look around and notice the mess. It felt like they had forgotten to clean up before company came over. 
Overall, the waitress was nice and attentive and the drink selection and prices were just average. I will definitely suggest a different spot next time I head out with my friends."

Initially concerned about out attire, which was extremely casual at best. those concerns quickly vanished when we entered and saw an extremely diverse attire of formal to beach to business and to barn--we felt comfortable!   

We were early for our reservations, so grabbed seats at the bar. The jazz band was amazing, and amazingly LOUD!!

Our bartender was knowledgable-made us a  mule, brandy manhattan and the house margarita. Before we got the opportunity to taste, the hostess directed us to our table. Once seated, found all drinks to be made just right....hubby is a manhattan snob, myself very picky about my mules and the kid fussy about the tequila used in any of his tequila drinks.    

The band was still overbearingly LOUD even in the dining area. Thankfully, their sound, although extremely LOUD was great-guessing the intense volume is a managerial/sound system issue--not a problem of the band.  

Our waiter, Landon, was a stitch--we needed that humor to end our day.  

The bread basket was served with a plate of roasted garlic, shredded cheese and balsamic vinegar-delightful change to simply bread and butter.  

Service was a touch on the slow side, but we had much to discuss-so as long as the drinks were full we barely noticed the time. Besides, I absolutely HATE service personell that rush you into ordering.  

Landon kept an eye on us, making sure we had what we needed without stalking or being pushy. We started with bacon blue cheese chips and some oysters. Disappointingly they were out of oysters and the chips didn&#39;t make it to the table before our main course but we didn&#39;t care as the chips were right up my alley of crunchy, gooey, blue cheese, béchamel and bacon goodness.  Even my husband and son, who generally steer clear of blue cheese (leaving more for me) found them to be quite appetizing. Thankfully it was a very generous serving-more than the three of us could eat-no worries, they&#39;re great reheated on the pizza stone at home.

We all asked many questions of our server, Landon, regarding the main courses, as we weren&#39;t sure which to order-lots of very appealing/sounding choices on the menu. We all split a gut when the music suddenly stopped to hear Landon screaming ordering ideas to us!  He was embarrassed but had a cute comeback to defuse the situation

Hubby had the penne w/grilled chicken, steamed broccoli and another manhattan. I was torn between the rib eye, kalamata pork tenderloin and moussaka. Landon said they were all great choices, asked me a few questions about my personal tastes--I decided on the moussaka and another mule. Our son had rib eye, side of roasted sweet tato, glazed baby carrots and another margarita.  

As we waited for meals to arrive, Landon was both attentive and entertaining. Hubby and he had a lot of laughs together, joking back and forth-keeping the kid and I almost in tears laughing with his comebacks and entertaining quips.

Dinner arrived and upon seeing my son&#39;s rib eye, commented on how it was kinda on the thin side.BUT once he cut into it, using the table knife, it was obviously super tender and cooked perfectly to his liking. It may not of had the superb flavor of a Mastro&#39;s-NOT saying it was flavorless-just needed a little steak sauce. Then again, this is a mediterranean dig, not a steakhouse! The roasted sweet tato and carrots were like dessert, although the kid thought both could have used more butter.

1/2 way through the meal, a manager stopped at our table, embarrassingly apologizing and handing our son a steak knife-which we had NOT asked for-as the steak was tender enough NOT to need it. Perhaps some sort of rules or policy that hadn&#39;t been adhered to?? We chuckled once the manager left at the silliness of his well intended handing off of the knife. Soon after Landon stopped by to check on us and my son handed the steak knife back. Landon looked perplexed at this gesture, and I started rolling on the floor when my son explained--just as the manager coincidently walked by again and wrenched his neck hearing the &#34;I don&#39;t need it&#34; comment.    

Hubby&#39;s penne and chicken had wonderful flavor-the penne was cooked perfectly. Sauce wasn&#39;t overbearing and very tasteful.

I thought my mouth was in heaven with the richness and full deep flavors of my moussaka.  Seriously good, comfort mediterranean dish-with ground beef not the traditional lamb which was fine with me!!  

We were all very satisfied with our choices and the service.The LOUD music could have used a few notches less of volume

Had flourless chocolate cake for dessert. Rich yummy goodness that could have used a lot more of the raspberry &#34;sauce&#34; for my personal liking.

Will eat at City Gate Grille again-Gr8 ambience;hoping all service is as good as Landon&#39;s and praying management has decided to turn down the volume of the music-bring ear plugs just in case!"

I&#39;ve been wanting to check this place out for a long time and for one reason or another didn&#39;t get there. As other reviewers say, it&#39;s definitely a hidden gem and worth finding. 

They have a really wine and craft beer selection, although the wines by the glass is a little on the high side, beers are priced just right. They also offer some great cocktails too.

As you walk in the door, you; re greeted very warmly, they offer to take your coat, everyone is professional and friendly. The place itself feels like a high quality restaurant you&#39;d find in the city. I love the huge &#34;cityscape&#34; of Chicago over the bar, beautiful.

We each out off of the prix fixed menu, she had the salmon and I had the short ribs and they were fantastic as others have said. They offered me a steak knife to cut it with, but it was so tender it wasn&#39;t needed. The salmon was also delicious, had a really nice glaze and was cooked just right. 

They also were very accommodating of my date as she is lactose intolerant and the desserts that were offered with the prix fixed meal had dairy in them so the waiter brought a serving of fresh berries instead.

The place is certainly a $$$ but well worth it, we will be going again!"

Great food, great price, great ambiance. Jazz night is fabulous. Wait staff is a little wanting though. It always takes a while before our orders are taken or our waters filled- even though the place isn&#39;t crowded. 
The bathrooms are also tricky to go to- it&#39;s down a steep flight of stairs so if you are a little older or have issues with steep narrow stairs, it will be a huge problem. The last waiter we had we thought was a little too informal and way too chatty and he tried to talk us out of ordering some of our favorites because he said it doesn&#39;t taste good and started gossiping about their current kitchen chaos and a lot about his personal life situation. Other than that very &#34;Cheap diner attitude&#34; that doesn&#39;t match the ambiance, the place is wonderful."

We started in the bar for cocktails, which was nice.  We were promptly seated at our reservation time.  Despite there being quite a few open tables, we were seated immediately next to an ordering station--one of those little kiosks that servers use to enter dinners.  Maybe I&#39;m sensitive, but there was a large LCD screen lit about 4 feet in front of me and slightly to the right.  It was distracting and not a very nice place to sit.  So, right away, I politely asked to get a different table and the hostess took care of it and got us a new table.  Great service.

Our server during dinner was great.  He did a good job of paying attention to our dinner and pace.  We were there for a nice date and great conversation, and I thought he did a great job of keeping the timing of the service great.  He slowed things down and didn&#39;t rush them, which was exactly what we wanted.  I feel like servers who are &#34;in tune&#34; with the diners are hard to find; so this was a very pleasant experience.

My biggest problem is that the food was just alright.  We both ordered medium rare hanger steak.  I had a side of sautéed mushrooms and Brussel sprout/bacon.  Wow was it salty.  Generally speaking, we both like salt and add it regularly to our food at home.  Here, however, we both thought that our dishes had an overpowering amount of salt (not just the steak but also the sides next to the steak).  Salt is one of those things where you can tolerate a bite or two of something that is salty, but each bite adds up.  At some point, you&#39;ve had enough salty bites that you&#39;re not sure you want to take another.    

So, the ambiance was good.  The service was great.  The entrees were hard for us to eat.  Ugh."

Extremely dissapointed after having dinner last Saturday at 7:00pm with a party of four.

1st Attempted to resolve during dinner &amp; spoke with the GM Jonathan Cook

2nd attempt was made &amp; I called the restaurant &amp; again spoke w/ Jonathan Cook. He remembered our table &amp; before I could provide any specifics, I was put on hold for 2 mins &amp; he returned and offered to send a token gift certificate.  I declined his offer and thanked him yet responded I&#39;m surprised you would not want to know specifically &#34;why&#34; we were unhappy.  He had no interest in finding out and I ended the call...

Why I would not recommend City Gate Grill for the service or the food

Party of 4 seated with a reservation in a section with one server and no back up servers.  Our Server already had a large party of 20-25.  Service through the entire meal was poor.  We were greeted by the server after sitting at the table for 10 minutes.  He was polite &amp; knowledgeable yet clearly overwhelmed.  

After our appetizers were served &amp; eaten, our plates, and drinks sat empty for over 10 minutes, I excused myself &amp; found the GM and explained our dissatisfaction with &#34;no&#34; service.  He came to the table, cleared it &amp; explained we were in good hands with his senior server.  He never returned to the table for the entire evening.

I reminded the server 2x to bring my dirty martini w/ blue cheese stuffed olives &amp; finally received it with pimento stuffed olives.  Waters were left emtpty through out the meal.

Food:
Appetizers - Bacon wrapped dates &amp; shrimp were ok yet I would not recommend it. There were 2 small shrimp &amp; 2 dates (4 total) that were wrapped in bacon.


Dinners:
Gnocchi - The gnocchi was not homemade &amp; reminded of the processed pasta that you see on the shelf.  The dish was oversauced so the flavors were not detectable
Rib eye steak - The steak was delicious but 30/40% was not eaten b/c it was all fat and grisle.  
Hanger steak - Excellent
Braised short ribs - Excellent
Desserts - best part of the meal / Choclolate ganache &amp; cheesecake

Sides: I ordered 2 sides, the creamed spinach &amp; Brussels sprouts but the server forgot to bring them

When we were presented with the check, nothing was comped even though the service was horrible &amp; only 50% of the meal was acceptable...  I gave the server our credit card &amp; said I was glad that we were not charged for the sides that I never received, he returned with the check &amp; advised he took off the corkage fee on two bottles of wine we brought into the restaurant.  We thanked him and ended our evening..."

Went with 3 girlfriends after the wine festival got canceled because of the rain.   The hostess told us the wait would be 15 minutes.   After waiting at the bar for over 45 minutes we were told it would be another 5-10 minutes.  A table at the bar opened up so we decided to sit there. We waited there for 10 minutes with no one coming by.   We left and will never go back.   Terrible service.

My friend suggested the place. She had been here a few times and said that she had loved it. The place is nice. Nothing special about the decor but clean and classy. It was infested by baby boomers but I can live with that. After all it is naperville. 

My friend said that we didnt need reservations so we never called. She was right. We got there at 815 and got seated right away. We had a great view of the band, which by the way were great. They brought the place alive. (I am a sucker for a live band though so I may be a bit bias).

As far as drinks go, we had a bottle of chanti (dont know the name but it was the only chanti offered). Good wine! They had a ton of drinks on the menu but it was a wine kind of night. For food both of my friends had steak and risotto and I had scallops and risotto. My scallops were great and so was the risotto. The steak was great as well but the risotto that came along with it did not compare to the pine nut and leek risotto that was offered with my dish. The food was great overall but a bit overpriced I thought. Sure it was delicious but it wasn&#39;t very well presented either. I had 3 scallops,  which accounts for 10 dollar a scallop so it better be presented in the most gorgeous way, no? 
Being so pricey I am not sure it is a place I plan on frequeting that often but if there is a special occasion then sure I shall stop by. 

The reason I deducted a star it is due to the location of the toilets. You have to walk outside of the restaurant to take care of business. It is located in the basement of the place and I find that annoying. I shouldnt have to mentally prepare myself to use the restroom. It is so far. Some of you call that lazy bur I call it practical."

Our server was Kelly and she was knowledgeable, helpful and extreme friendly. We were pleasantly surprised! 
I had the 14 oz Ribeye with sauteed mushrooms, truffle pomme frites, and loaded baked potato. My wife had the braised beef short rib, and we had the crab cakes for an appetizer. The food was excellent and well worth the cost.
I not only will go back, but I will recommend this place wholeheartedly.

There&#39;s a big reason for that though, I got married here.  It was so great.  The people were so good to us.

When we go here to eat though, I still think this place rocks.  It&#39;s not crowded during the week at all.  Just like some businessmen and stuff.

There is no word in the English language to use to describe how absolutely divine the food is.

They bring you out bread and crushed roasted garlic with parmesan and olive oil to start your dining experience.

One of my favorite meals is the ribeye.  But the skirt steak is good too.  If you go in fall and they have the pumpkin spice soup... GET IT!!!!! It is so amazing.  It&#39;s not sweet, more savory.  The best way I could explain it to you is that it taste like tomato soup made out of pumpkins.

Pablo is my favorite server here, as he remembers us.  Well everyone remembers us here.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just cause we got married here, but even before that... they remembered us.

The drink are awesome too!

This place makes you feel like you&#39;re spending a million dollars to eat there with prices that are comparable to Maggiano&#39;s and Other nice places.  Maybe even cheaper.

I can&#39;t believe I never reviewed this place before.  But whenever there is any reason to celebrate with me and wife... this is the place."

The hanger steak was cooked exactly as ordered and melted in my mouth. My date had the moussaka and he said &#34;hell yes&#34; when I asked was it good.  He also enjoyed the oysters I would not touch. The manager even came by to refill our water glasses and was able to tell my curious date about the materials used on the glass looking, but turned out to be not glass ceiling. My date and I had a reservation and was seated as soon as we walked in, the restaurant however, was packed and we couldn&#39;t sit near the band. After dinner when the restaurant wasn&#39;t as crowded we were able to sit near the band and really enjoy the music. If you don&#39;t finish your bottle of wine they seal it up so you can take it home so you don&#39;t feel like you HAVE to finish your bottle of wine.

I feel the menu is better than it has been recently since the new chef took over.  Our server Chris was excellent! Amazing server! The restaurant was extremely busy and he rocked it.

Brittiny, the social event coordinator, assisted me in making this an absolutely perfect evening.  The party was just immediate family so there were only 11 of us, and we fit perfectly in the Wall Street Room.  When I learned they had audio/video equipment available I decided to create a family photo slide presentation that we played throughout the dinner, which was a huge hit with the family - as anyone who has worked with AV equipment knows, the success of a presentation is contingent on the equipment and their equipment ran flawlessly.  

Miguel was our head waiter and he was outstanding - professional, attentive and personable.  Those assisting him were also professional and personable.  Some in our group even joked about how our water glasses were mysteriously kept filled, which speaks to how deftly the wait staff works.

Everything ran smoothly from the moment we got there until the moment we left.  The food was exceptional - from the appetizers to the dinners and then dessert.  For appetizers we ordered the seafood platter, caprese flatbread and sashimi grade blue fin tuna - all of it was excellent.   The sushi eaters in our group fought over the last pieces of tuna.  

Dinners selections in our group ranged from duck to seafood to beef - again, all excellent.  We had a couple foodies in our group and a couple picky eaters - even they were very happy with their meals.  My parents were given a complimentary cheesecake dessert, which was very thoughtful and delicious.  Everyone was also very happy with their drinks and wine selections.

I think that sums it up!  I highly recommend CityGate Grille!"

This was going to be for our daughter&#39;s upcoming Sweet Sixteen Party. When speaking with Holley over the telephone she seemed very excited in our theme,  which is The Great Gatsby,  and was very what I thought to be attentive during our conversation. When my husband and daughter arrived for our appointment and to view the proposal it was the complete opposite if our telephone conversation. Nothing that my daughter nor myself wanted  was included in the proposal. Chair covers, bows, centerpieces were were all in addition to the $9000.00 proposal. We wanted wanted a cash bar,  and buffet style dinner as 80% of our guests we age 15 and 16. The proposal included open bar, and a plated duet dinner with a party lasting only until 10 pm, when we clearly stated we needed the venue until midnight.  Weddings are their forte, obviously.  So if that&#39;s what your looking to book this venue for I&#39;m sure they are capable.  If Miss Holley would have taken they time to listen to the &#34;guest of honor&#34; and included in her proposal the wants and needs of us as well, perhaps we would have booked with them. Thankfully we found a very elegant venue just down the street for a little less, but with everything &#34;extra&#34; included into one package.

Went for valentines day, weeks in advance the soonest reservation was for 930pm (which is completely understandable) but the restaurant was EMPTY... Which I found odd. 

Coat check, valet and host services were all friendly and attentive, our waiter wasn&#39;t too bad but he got frustrated with my indecision - as if there were lines of people waiting and he was trying to get us in and out as quickly as possible... Let me remind you it was after 930 and the place was near desolate! 

I asked if the salmon was farm raised or wild caught, the waiter said &#34;it&#39;s from Scotland&#34; So I repeated my question which was met with &#34;I don&#39;t know, do I need to ask?&#34; I said &#34;please&#34;, he groaned and rolled his eyes and walked away... Come to find out the salmon is farm raised ( which I refuse to eat, disgusting!!!) so I asked for another minute to look at the menu... Waiter seemed peeved... 

We ended up with a bottle of wine (that was almost triple the price on the menu than at the liquor store-because I checked- but once again that&#39;s somewhat expected), the calamari, which was nothing special and had wayyyy more garnish than squid, then
I had the asiago stuffed gnocchi, it left much to be desired and the was no asiago flavor whatsoever, straight ricotta inside, I swear. the &#34;crispy eggplant&#34; was literally just breaded fried cubes of eggplant thrown on top... Eh.
Boyfriend had steak, whipped potatoes and asparagus... Steak was cooked almost perfectly (asked for med and it was med rare but he didn&#39;t mind) So that&#39;s a plus but the asparagus was scrawny and withered-Like it was frozen or sat for hours and had been reheated more than once, he didn&#39;t comment much on the potatoes... Plating was sloppy.

Overall for an upscale restaurant with higher end pricing we avid foodies were extremely disappointed!!! They use low quality ingredients and try to dress them up in fancy names and big price tags! The plating and presentation could have made up for the lackluster flavor but that was sloppy as well. We don&#39;t mind paying high prices for food that is worthy of such, but this place has no business charging what they do for what you&#39;re actually getting!

The two stars given were for the friendly and accommodating staff, the somewhat nice atmosphere... Bonus points for the fact that it&#39;s Greek owned &amp; I support my people.

BUT:

Boyfriend and I agreed we will absolutely NOT ever be back. There are much better options in the area that use quality ingredients and are lower priced, such as Cooper&#39;s Hawk or Two Brothers Roundhouse!!!"

Very corporate/hotel-y feel, great valet service, you enter through the lobby of an office building. Do note the cool art from the Calamos Collection, very interesting self portrait of Zorba the Greek by Anthony Quinn.

Front end service was awesome; valets, hostess, coat check all friendly and attentive.

We got there well before the big &#34;NYE Party&#34; began. The main dining room is on the main level with a party space downstairs where the NYE festivities were being held.

The service and food were all great. 4 diners, all different meals; Salmon, Short Rib, Steak and Shrimp Pasta dish.

The beef dishes were great, as were there corresponding sauces, risottos, gravies.

To my taste the salmon was underdone, but that is pretty common and I probably should have made sure and asked for it medium.

Everything was well made, well presented, brought out timely and to the right person.

The space itself is great. As odd as it sounds, the view of 88 and the area around it was kinda cool at night. The bar dining room are one big area and there is bar seating as well.

Will definitely go back. It is pleasantly devoid of the downtown Naperville problems. Handsome location, strong food, reasonably priced....will definitely be back"

The complimentary valet was really nice, and the valet guy was super friendly.

We were seated by the window in a quiet corner, and promptly tended to by our server. She mentioned that during the summer months they offer 1/2 priced bottles of wine- which is awesome! While the menu is not huge, I found many things that I would have loved to order. My boyfriend and I both got the wedge salad and filet. The service was very prompt, my only complaint is that we recieved our entrees before finishing our salads. It&#39;s not a huge deal, but would have been nice if timed a little better. Both of our filets were cooked perfectly and each came with two sides - I choose asparagus and the three cheese mac n&#39; cheese. My boyfriend chose broccoli and carrots - both of which were delicious and very flavourful. While they offered dessert, we opted out. The menu looked fantastic though!

The atmosphere was very nice, clean, and modern. They had a live jazz band which seemed to be a big hit with those sitting at the bar. The music was not too loud and made for great background ambiance. 

Our server was super nice and attentive. I forget her name...

PS- Prior to ordering, we were served with fresh roasted garlic, a tomato mixture, and pita bread- which was very tasty!

Maybe it&#39;s because the restaurant shares a lobby with an investment firm, but it felt a little like peering into the Big Boy&#39;s Club: it wouldn&#39;t phase me if a multi-million dollar Wall Street deal took place here over steaks &#39;n&#39; scotch.

Anyway, on to what matters! The waiter was extremely attentive and considerate. Even the bus boy, when pouring ice water, shielded his hand with a napkin to prevent any water from potentially splashing me. I was shocked by this move and said as much. The poor soul&#39;s demeanor suggested he may have been lashed before, god help that wayward drop of water.

A fresh basket of bread (cut into clever slivers that resembled chips) arrived alongside cloves of garlic, which the waiter crushed right in front of us with a fork! The beet and apple salad was superb, with an excellent (and light) touch of vinaigrette. And my mom had to restrain herself from licking the plate clean of her birthday dinner (mushroom dusted mahi).

This wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing if the food and service were on par with this lofty vision, but it isn&#39;t.

Food overall was fine. Entree portions are on the small side, so appetizers and a salad are in order. Lots of seafood, but I found some things lacking. The mussels were really small instead of being fat and luscious. The chorizo sauce that came with it was very good though. The lobster bisque was fine, but a bit skimpy on the lobster. I would have preferred chunks instead of  hairy filaments. The scallops were fine, but could have been seared more crisply outside to complement the buttery richness of the inside.

They offer a lot of fancy drinks, but don&#39;t have a solid knowledge of your classic cocktails. I asked for a negroni - Campari, gin, sweet vermouth - and they had to come back and ask what was in it. I&#39;m no cocktail snob, but really?

The decor is a rushed interpretation of luxury Euro-American with a tinge of oversized suburbia. Lots of dark stained wood and a slightly chilly feel. Service is appallingly bad. Lots of long waits yet waitstaff are seen lingering around?  We waited a while to order dessert and once more for our checks. In this case, they were working a party celebrating a really old guy&#39;s birthday with his grown children, his grandchildren, and his twenty-something girlfriend. Eeeeewwww.

If you work in the area and want to impress clients, CityGate Grille will do an adequate job. Otherwise, there are better places to go nearby, like Sugar Toad."

The place was not busy on a Saturday night so there was something not quite hitting on all cylinders.  It may be the location, but it also may be the service.  The reception staff and valet were fine; the table service was not.

The specials list was uninspiring and omitted the soup of the day.  We ordered from the main menu.

Our server was unable to describe the preparation for the bacon-wrapped dates and shrimp appetizer.  Instead he tried to explain what a date was, unsuccessfully.  Our appetizer and first course plates were cleared, along with our silverware.  No silverware was brought with the main course.  We asked for silverware and waited as our food cooled.  Finally, no help in sight, we got up and helped ourselves to silverware from the next table.

The menu was all over the place, from hamburgers to high-end steaks to seafood.  Some things lived up to the &#34;Mediterranean&#34; influence advertised, and some did not.  The bacon-wrapped date &amp; shrimp appetizer was really good -- nice crispy smoky bacon contrasted nicely with the sweet dates and shrimp.  It came with a carrot slaw which seemed to be there mostly for color - didn&#39;t really add anything to the flavor of the dish.

The lobster bisque was decent.  The crab cake appetizer, served with pearl cous-cous was average.  It lacked lumps of crab--had that beat up texture we often find, but it was served with a good olive-infused sauce.  My friend enjoyed her salad with fresh parmesan and light vinaigrette dressing.  My main course of lamb loin, garlic rapini and bleu cheese potatoes au gratin was really good.  The lamb was tender, flavorful and perfectly cooked medium rare as requested.  I would have liked more of the sauce to go with it.

Desserts were a predictable run of creme brulee, flourless chocolate cake, cheesecake, etc.  Nothing Mediterranean about it that I could tell, other than one sorbet which our server described as &#34;bloody orange.&#34;

Dinner for two with one glass of wine, tax &amp; tip was $120."

Everything about this place is great - the ambience, the food, the service -seriously, they are all top-notch.

Some of the highlights of the menu:
Spinach &amp; Bleu Cheese Salad
Caesar Salad
Crabcakes
Asiago Gnocchi
Flatbreads

A note about the Asiago Gnocchi - it comes with little crispy fried eggplant cubes on top that melt in your mouth like butter.  It is one of the most unique, whimsical, and flavorful gnocchi dishes I have ever had.  

The only thing I wasn&#39;t too thrilled with was the Chocolate Bombe, basically chocolate cake with chocolate mousse on top.  The cake was quite dry and it was cold, as if they just took it out of the freezer for a few minutes to unthaw.  I expect a much better dessert for $9.  

Note: they also have a bar menu that&#39;s worth looking into with $2 sliders served on mini brioche buns (burger, crabcake, tempura sea bass, or bistro steak sliders).  So for a minimal cost, you can sit in the bar area, order a drink and three sliders, and see if you like the food."

Seared to perfection.  Others in our group had the filet which was also cooked perfect (med rare).  We also had the salmon bruchetta which is nothing like any other bruchetta I&#39;ve ever had.   No tomatoes at all, had salmon, capers, eggs and a white sauce it was excellent though!  Good beer choices too.   Highly recommend."

Great Caesar salad, we both order the filet and were a little disappointed with the cuts. Mine was not a center-cut that we are accustomed to. However, the flavor overshadowed the mediocre cut. My husband&#39;s cut was a much better cut than mine. The green beans were amazing. Stayed for dessert and got the creme brûlée and tiramisu and both were top notch!! Will probably return to try some other menu options."

It was pleasantly decorated for the Christmas holiday in a modern but spirited feel. You have the option of wanting to watch sports or just chat with you friends. It was nice because the waiter didn&#39;t even rush us at all.  We ended up being there for 3 hours.  

The house starts you off by bringing out roasted garlic with parmesan and pita triangles that are amazing.  Plan ahead if you are going on a date because you don&#39;t want to have to miss out on the garlic.  My friend wasn&#39;t going to have any but I was able to twist her arm and then she couldn&#39;t stop it was so good. The Pita triangles also come with butter and a roast red pepper dip that was pretty good. 

My friend had ordered the crab cakes as an appetizer and they were great.  Full of crabby  goodness.   I had ordered the caprese salad which was very surprising. I was totally not expecting a two of tomato&#39;s and mozzeralla. The presentation was great. The chef was not shy on the balsamic.  I could have used one more slice of mozzeralla but I am not going to complain.  

Now to our amazing main courses. My friend had got the dinner special which was a seafood risotto which had lobster and shrimp.  It was very taste but very rich. I you are in the mood for a rich dish it is the one for you. Me myself I was torn I couldn&#39;t really decide what I wanted. I was waviering between the steaks and the risotto&#39;s.   Being the foodie that I am I can be alittle pick. So I finally decided on the steak risotto. I figured I could get a little of both.  The dish I got was not at all what I expected. I had assumed that I would get a risotto with small pieces of steak in it. Well that was not what I got. It was a steak with a side of risotto. The steak which was a skirt steak was cooked perfectly.  The risotto was a cream lite side with pearl onions , mushrooms, asparagus and spinach. It was amazing.  I did make a good choice.  

To finish off the evening we closed with an order of the Tirimasu.  It was fabulous. The perfect mix of coffee and Kahlua.   It is a good restaurant to celebrate a holiday. it is also nice because you can actually hear yourself talk. The back ground music is not to loud.  The drink specials are also very good."

You&#39;ll first have to venture into Calamos Holdings and make a left and venture down this long hallway, making yourself second guess if you are going to the right place. Ah, finally to your right, before you walk down the stairs is CityGate Grille, somewhat hidden to the untrain eyes. 

I was politely greeted by the host and when I told her I was meeting with with someone she told me I can have a seat. Exactly where? The only seating was couches that didn&#39;t belong to the restaurant, but more to the building itself (hence it being located outside of the restaurant). 

Anywho as we were were seated for lunch I was at awe at how modern and sophisticated the restaurant was. A great atmosphere with a full bar and private dining rooms for special events.

As we sat for lunch, we were greeted by our server and he took our drink orders, water for me please. I ended up ordering the Lobster Bisque and Philly Ribeye Sandwich. This has been at least 2 weeks ago and I can still smell the delicious aroma and taste the smooth, creaminess of the Lobster Bisque. By the end I was literally licking my bowl clean (actually imagining it because doing such things in public is not really acceptable). The Philly Ribeye Sandiwch has an upperhand on other so called Philly Steaks. Served with a side of crispy, hot fries the ribeye was juicy and well seasoned.  

HmmMmmm it&#39;s getting frosty out, a bowl of bisque will do me right."

We sat in the bar area and there was live music yesterday evening.  I had the special Grouper and my wife had the 8 finger cavatelli.  The fish was fantastic, light and flaky and had a great lobster sauce with it and the pasta was prepared perfectly.  The kitchen is generating some great food in Naperville and CityGate is a real hidden gem.  As a baker, the desserts were great and the tiramisu was HUGE.  It was flavorful and light, a great way to end the evening.  My bread pudding was just as good, a great rendition of the traditional dessert.  Great service, attentive without being over the top.

Somewhat hard to find as it is in an office complex and further back than where you&#39;d expect, but keep looking.  Not much in the way of signs.

It&#39;s located in the same building as an investment firm.  The restrooms are on the lower floor and you can peek into the firm&#39;s cafeteria.  There are a lot of businesses and office parks in the area so it&#39;s a good place to take a client or have a nicer meeting over lunch.

The restaurant has a business type atmosphere but I could also see how in the evening it could turn into a nice steakhouse restaurant.  I ordered a soup and salad and both were served quickly, were reasonably priced and decent tasting.  The food wasn&#39;t particularly outstanding, it was just OK.  The serves know that lunchtime has to be a quick turnaround so it&#39;s impressive that they turn out a decent meal so quickly.

I don&#39;t know what else is in the area but I could see folks coming here for dinner or grabbing a drink in the evening.  Seems like a place for more mature crowds.  Couldn&#39;t see myself here doing a social thing but maybe in a few years if I find myself living in the western suburbs.  It&#39;s OK, served the purpose for what I was there for."

This could be a great place if they hired a chef with a vision. Unfortunately, that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening here and it bothers me deeply. Oh well - end of rant. The other truly bizarre thing is that there are no restrooms in the actual restaurant - you have to make your way through an office building to find them. Just weird.

I&#39;ve also tried the gnocci with crispy eggplant (delicious) and the roasted chicken. The steaks are also very good. The only thing that I didn&#39;t like was the rapini served with the roasted chicken.  It was very bitter.

The drinks are boozy and there is free live music on Fridays and Saturdays, which makes for quite an entertaining night out.  There&#39;s a bar menu with inexpensive sliders and apps."

The atmosphere of the restaurant is divided into three sections.  The bar area, which is sectioned off by a wall of glass, the main area, and one large area for big parties.  

I had to lobster tail, and it was delicious.  However, my favorite part of the meal was the appetizer they supply, a garlic paste and pita chips.  Absolutely delicious!!  It is a bit pricey, so be prepared to spend around $45-$50 a person if you want steak or seafood and wine."

When you are driving up to this place you may not expect much because it is in an office park in the middle of no where. Looks can be deceiving.

A $500 disaster.  New Year&#39;s Eve, party of seven.  We experienced the worst service I have seen in more then ten years.  The wait staff while friendly was awful. We were at the table thirty minutes before they took our drink order, then they brought out incorrect drinks. One hour into experience we had to ask for them to take out entree order.  The food servers had to ask which entrees were supposed to go to the people seated at the table.  

After they brought the wrong entree to one in our party, they then added a $35.00 surcharge called Bad Quality.  When we questioned the manager about it, he was argumentative.  They did finally remove the charge. The entire experience was a perfect example of how not to treat customers or run a restaurant.

It&#39;s in a not so good location because no one would ever think about going into an area of corporate offices for dinner. So I actually think this makes the restaurant one of the best kept secrets in Naperville.

My mom found a $20 coupon in the Women&#39;s Health magazine (free at banks). I take my parents out to eat every Thursday. That Thursday my mom was giddy (aka drunk) with happiness. $3 mixed drinks on Thu...she had 2 amaretto sours. 

The calamari app was eh. There was something weird about the breading...I can&#39;t put my finger on it. 

However after plates were passed around and every one got a bite of everyone else&#39;s food every one insisted that their own plate was the best and was super awesome. I had the SMOKED SEA BASS with sweet potato &amp; brussel sprout slaw, kalamata jam. I was a little disappointed when it came out and it did not look like it was smoked. I think they just write that on the menu b/c it sounds good? However the presentation was beautiful. The fish was on a cedar plank and the jam was used as garnish around the plate. The brussel sprout slaw was a little too salty and too vinegary. There are obviously still some kinks for this restaurant to iron out. But it&#39;s definitely on the right track."

Anyhow, the place is decorated nicely and has a swanky atmosphere. 

We got an appetizer of mushrooms on flatbread which was quite delicious....crisp, buttery. 
Shared a bottle of pinot grigio with my wife and she ordered the gnocchi with caprese and fried eggplant cubes. Was a great dish...quite innovative and done nicely. I had the halibut special with a crabcake on the top, and a rich caper sauce, brocolli rabe, and whipped potatoes. Nicely done.
I have to put a nice note here, as I had a little communication problem with the waiter on the price of the wine specials. I had put it in a previous review, but I received a note from manager and was refunded the money I overpaid for a  wine special. That was above and beyond their call of duty, and I certainly appreciated it. It appears customer service is high on their list, and I am adding a star to my personal rating..........
We&#39;ll definitely go back and try some other dishes."

It was not crowded, featured attentive, knowledgeable staff, and well-prepared, delicious food.

We started with the hummus trio, compliments of our check-in with Yelp, and were overwhelmed with the appetizer. Plenty of warm, tasty flatbread to dip in three very different hummus selections. Lots of food for two people, and we even managed to take a little home for a late-night snack.

My wife tried a Halibut special that night and I chose the Skirt Steak Risotto. Her fish was lovely, and was presented as described. As for the risotto, I imagined it to be prepared as written, featuring small pieces of steak scattered throughout. I was pleasantly surprised when I was presented with a large serving of a savory risotto AND about a 4oz portion of a delicious marinated Skirt Steak.

The atmosphere at City Gate was fresh and chic, yet comfortable and accessible. Great job to everyone involved in this establishment. We will definitely make plans to return!"

Fantastic wine, appetizer, entrees, dessert and customer service.  My wife ordered an entree without quite knowing what it was, and after my wife only picked at it after a few minutes, the waiter graciously and proactively offered to exchange it.  Not wanting to make a scene, my wife declined.  So what did the waiter do?  He later brought us free desserts and comped her entree.  Say what?!  Yep, he did that.  The food tasted great, good atmosphere, and half off wine over $50.  Ah-MAZE-ing!  Definitely coming again!"

My husband and I had a wonderful dinner here, from start to finish. Here&#39;s why:

- We had no trouble getting a reservation during &#34;prime time&#34; on a Saturday night. They also honored our reservation request to be seated by the windows but there really isn&#39;t a bad table in the place which is saying a lot considering its size

- The restaurant itself is beautiful. It is spacious and has a lovely upscale feel to it. One wall has tw-story floor to ceiling windows that look out on a corporate pond lined with huge lit evergreen trees and I-88 (which surprisingly gives off a good energy vibe). The view can be enjoyed from any table in the restaurant. The bar looked very nice and it appeared you could eat there, as well.

- The menu had many choices and our food was excellent! Entrees included steaks, seafood, house specialties that included pasta, some Greek dishes, and nightly specials. There even was a black angus burger so really, something for everyone! We both had their salmon with pasta and sweet peas in a lemon-parmesan cream sauce, a special that was both unique and delicious! We also really enjoyed the appetizers that we selected: skirt steak mini-kabobs, as well as bacon wrapped shrimp and goat cheese stuffed dates, each with its own delicious sauce but there were at probably ten to choose from. We&#39;re glad we saved some room for dessert. There were many tempting choices but we selected the key lime tarte and flourless chocolate ganache cake, both made in-house. We loved them both. There were also flatbreads on their menu and excellent salad possibilities which are also offered as half-portions, a nice idea! We saw many of reasons to come back.

- All of the wait staff (but a special shout-out to our waitress Daniela!) was attentive, knowledgeable, and there was never a language barrier issue with anyone who came to our table. It&#39;s clear that they have all been well-trained.

- The manager was also very attentive to the patrons. We found him to be personable and committed to giving us a good experience.

-  This restaurant is not at all noisy. You&#39;ll be able to converse easily with members of your dinner party instead of straining to hear, a common problem in the downtown Naperville restaurants once it gets crowded.

- Parking is a breeze. You can either use their free valet service or park your own car. If you do the parking, you&#39;ll be no more than 75 feet from the door

While CityGate Grille is off the beaten path of the downtown Naperville restaurants, we think that&#39;s one of its positives aspects. We weren&#39;t sure what to expect after Riva left but we walked out saying, &#34;Well done, CityGate Grille! We will be back!&#34;"

They had a good crowd in the restaurant and several people in the bar area. We grabbed two seats at the bar, and Katie had dinner while I had a few beers and some apps. Neil, our FAVORITE bartender, was working and took great care of us.

I love sitting in the bar, two large screen tvs behind the bar, good cocktails and cold beer (what else does a man need?). Its comfortable, and the redecoration of the joint looks great!

The tomato soup is FABULOUS, and Katie loved the mussels, salad, and especially the cobbler for dessert.

Great evening, excellent food, and warm/friendly service.

We had early reservations and were seated right away by a friendly hostess. The waiter however never cracked a smile or asked if it was a special occasion even though two of us were carrying gift bags...This was a birthday celebration for two people but they never bothered to ask. After drink orders were placed the waiter brought roasted garlic and a bowl of olive oil but no bread...Ummm...It took like ten minutes to get a small basket of pita wedges and super thin parm crackers to our table which also came with some sort of tomato (bland) sauce. They kept pushing drinks on us which I thought was weird until I got my salad. How can you screw up a Caesar salad? Well, you use store bought croutons, skip the anchovies and go light on the shaved parm. Oh, and you barely drizzle dressing on it. Bland and boring. A friend had the spinach salad which looked okay and my hub got the wedge salad with bacon and ranch which he loved. Our entrees were so-so. I had the gnocchi which was really rich and the sauce overwhelmed the dumplings. I ate maybe half. My husband got the steak with risotto which was bland and boring. 
The wine and drinks were top shelf however the food was sadly lacking. Will I go back? Probably not, there are plenty of tasty places in the area with friendly service."

It&#39;s one of my favorite places in Naperville: simple and tasty food, good service, and a nice atmosphere. If you&#39;re there after dark, there is a pretty view of lit-up trees and live music. It is a nice little gem tucked away in Corporate-ville. Once you arrive at the building (valet and lots of self-parking), go inside and turn left; the restaurant is on the main floor at the end of the hall."

The location is in the lobby of an office building off of Rte 59 and I-88.  It was a Thursday evening and our party of 12 were the only ones in the restaurant.

I ordered the mushroom flatbread for my appetizer.  It was borderline burnt and too crispy.  My 1st choice was not available so I had to settle for the pork medallions.  The menu did not mention that they were fried.  I found the dish to be too oily and salty.  I was barely able to eat one of the two medallions.  The service was a but a bit over the top and came across as trying too hard

I now understand why the restaurant was empty.  I will not be returning."

We had called ahead about an hour before hand and our tables were ready and waiting.  As soon as we sat down, drinks orders were being taken.  Apps came out shortly after, and the main course, I had a ribeye blackened and it was amazing... seriously best steak I&#39;ve had in a long time.  Service was on point all night, from start to finish.  The only problem I have, is that we live on the West Coast and can&#39;t go back more often."

our friends came in as we were finishing up, looking for recommendations.  what else could we say but EVERYTHING!?

while everything was delish, my personal faves were the caprese flatbread (big chunks of grape tomates and loaded with fresh mozzerella, but barely braised!  not a melted hunk of goo at all...)...the baked apple crisp dessert was unbelievable and i&#39;m not even really a dessert person...and, i&#39;m a sucker for dates, but dates with chorizo?  wow.

my friend had the sea bass with this amazing sweet potato bake and a weird-sounding but so good brussel sprout slaw?!  yum!!

i feel compelled to say that everyone (except the reviewer who detests truffles) loved the truffle flat bread too.

the service was fabulous, completely attentive but not overbearing.

the prices were fairly reasonable , i&#39;d say, especially given the quality.

i dined at sugar toad last night and while i commend them for their creativity, citygate blows them away.  even citygate&#39;s wine was better - conundrum?  my fave.  half price tuesday nights?  it&#39;s worth a trip to the ville!

the location is a bit odd like everyone said, but given i was staying at hotel arista, i had no complaints.

thanks for a great dinner!!"

Very urban feel to the bar and a nice sized private dining room. We came for a late dinner Saturday night with 4 couples and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the live music. The menu is varied from pastas to scallops and veal chops but the winner of the night was their flat bread selection!  Several of the ladies opted for a salad and a flat-bread as their meal and they were not disappointed! The flat breads are crisp, buttery delicious and topped with a variety of offerings from caprese to mushrooms. Yum!  I opted for a lobster ravioli and it was sweet, succulent and just  the right size portion. The wine list was a very nice surprise with great selections and reasonable prices. All in all a great value and we will most definitely be back!"

Being new to the area we are looking to find a replacement for our favorite breakfast hang out. Double Yolk will not make the cut. 

Service for us was slow and the server was distracted. Time for her shift to end was what I kept hearing her repeat to other customers. For me service when exceptional can make a difference in the overall experience. Keep my drink full. Check on me once or twice during the meal. It all goes a long way to improving the customer/server dynamic.

The real killer for me was the food. I ordered the Hungry man platter. Eggs over easy. Hash brown and sausage patties with a sausage link. I also got the pancakes vs toast. Everything was barely warm. One requirement is food must be hot! Warm at the very least. This felt like it had been sitting for 7 min or longer before it was served. On a positive note the pancakes were by far the best part of the meal. 

Overall all the customers seemed happy and the environment was clean and well represented. 

Update: My wife and I returned and overall the service was better. For the 2nd time in two visits we were seated next to the bathroom. Other seats were available but we were marched to the rear of the establishment. I didn&#39;t say anything but is this a coincidence or just incredible bad luck? The food was warmer this time but overall still nothing to rave about. Thanks for the invite back  but again I say firmly Double Yolk will not make the cut."

It&#39;s was okay not really authentic but everyone has there own style in cooking. It filled me up and I enjoyed it. The waitress was very polite and always had a smile :) . I saw large groups and they seemed to handle it pretty good.  

I based my 4 stars on parking, wait time, speed of serving, how food was cooked, and cleanliness. I did not really count the taste of food. I would like to try some other meals first.

I&#39;ve gotten take out here several times and I have also eaten in a few times. The servers we&#39;ve had are wonderful, attentive, and nice. It always makes me happy when the server goes out of their way to make your toddler happy while dining out. The place has always been super clean, including the restrooms. 

I think my favorite thing would have to be that they offer biscuits and gravy as a side instead of toast or pancakes! I love this! Now, they don&#39;t have anything on my homemade biscuits and gravy, but it is a really nice change every now and then. I love the breakfast burger! If you can&#39;t decide, believe me get this and you won&#39;t regret it. Also love the healthy items they have available.

And as always, the food is great! I fell in love with the &#34;meat lovers skillet.&#34; The portions are quite large, I always end up taking half to go in a box. It seems to be a common theme here. Everyone walks out with a box.
If you have Gluten sensitivity or intolerance, you can substitute for the Gluten-Free pancakes. Some of the best I&#39;ve ever had, but don&#39;t take my word for it. Come have a taste for yourself.

We set out to grab brunch at a place nearby that we haven&#39;t tried yet, and this place was a winning choice. It was about noon on a Saturday and the restaurant was pretty full but we still got sat right away (in a comfy booth too!).

Our waitress was very helpful and efficient. We had coffee flowing right away and she even made sure to grab some decaf for me (trying to cut down on my caffeine intake). The menu was huge and had everything you could want for breakfast or lunch. Making a decision was HARD. Especially since the menu had so many delicious photos of the food and I was super hungry. 

I ordered the avocado omelet (which included bacon and mozzarella) along with hash browns and a side of pancakes. It sounds like quite the hefty order I know, but the sides were included! It was all super delish. Hash browns were on point and the skillet was made to perfection. Plus, all that food was only $8.95! What a deal. Of course I ended up taking home half the omelet, a little bit of potatoes and a pancake - all of which made great leftovers minus the omelet due to the avocado getting brown.

Joshua B (husband) enjoyed the country skillet topped with biscuits and sausage gravy. I stole a few bites off his plate and I am definitely a fan of the biscuits and gravy, that&#39;s for sure. But then again, who isn&#39;t? 

We&#39;ll definitely be back to enjoy more of their menu!

We ended up here this morning after M whined that he was hungry.  I suggested Double Yolk, and after he reviewed the menu and salivated over the pictures from Yelp, we made our way over.

Upon arrival, we encountered a 15 minute wait, not bad at all.  After our number was the called, the gentleman at the register thanked us for our patience and told us to enjoy our meal. 

We were seated in a cozy booth, but next to the window, it was quite chilly.  Not a big deal, but come winter, it may have been downright uncomfortable. However, the back corner booth gave us a great view of the entire restaurant, so that&#39;s a plus.

Shortly after being seated, our server Betty arrived to take our drink order.  We both chose coffee and ice waters without lemon.  She returned with our beverages and we ordered:  the Country Skillet for M (eggs over easy with biscuits and sausage gravy) with english muffin for the carb-inducing side) and I chose the Philly Cheese steak sandwich (no mushrooms), with curly fries and the soup of the day (Cream of Chicken and Wild Rice).  As much as I wanted a beautiful skillet breakfast, eggs have made their way into my &#34;can&#39;t eat this anymore without severe repercussions&#34; list.  I don&#39;t care for pancakes, waffles, crepes, etc.... so I have pretty much given up on breakfast foods.

Looking around, the restaurant is modern, clean, and smaller than most breakfast places, but you can tell it is well run.  Busboys cleared tables immediately after patrons departed, servers keep the coffee flowing, and the attitudes of the employees were very pleasant despite a busy morning breakfast rush.  

My soup arrived quickly, and I quickly dug in.  It was thick and full of flavor.  This tasted homemade, and not some nasty, preservative filled Campbell&#39;s garbage.  The chicken and rice were amazing.  I could have eaten a bucket of this stuff. 

A few minutes later, our food arrived and M immediately said &#34;Oh man&#34; as a mountain of food was placed in front of him. I said the same (but silently) as I stared down at a delicious Philly cheese steak sandwich with the most beautiful curly fries I&#39;ve seen outside of Arby&#39;s. We dug in.

My sandwich was amazing- a bit greasy but the slightly toasted french roll kept the juices from escaping for the most part. The fries were incredible: perfectly seasoned, good crispy exterior with a soft potato-y interior, and were piping hot.  A few slices of crinkle cut pickle were also provided, and they tasted way better than store-bought, jarred pickles. 

I only managed to eat half of my meal, but M was bound and determined to finish his enormous skillet.  I was certain he&#39;d be successful, but he gave up with about a quarter of it left. Betty brought us some boxes and our check, and thanked us for coming in. After settling up with the gentleman at the register, we (slowly) made our way outside.

I&#39;m definitely impressed with the food and the service provided here (Betty was amazing!) I&#39;ve known about Double Yolk forever, yet I can&#39;t give a good reason as to why I haven&#39;t been here until today.  The prices are fair, the atmosphere enjoyable, and you will absolutely leave here in a food coma.  We will be back!"

I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve been coming here so often and so long that I never reviewed it. I usually get breakfast food like the hungry jack omelet, the French connection and the chorizo skillet and all have been very tasty and big portions.  Just watch out for their chocolate peanut butter french toast...very good but waaay too sweet.  But I also like their lunch as well like their chicken sandwich and panini.  Although their breakfast food tastes better. You won&#39;t leave here hungry!  All the staff is very nice.  Even on a busy day which is usually any Sat/Sun morning, you can usually get seating within 15 mins.  Also you can get discount certificates on www.restaurant.com so the food is a great value.

Brunch time, maybe lunch time. We were seated promptly and received our drinks quickly. Our meal was good and we were in and out within an hour. Attached is a gelato shop which we would like to try at some point. 

The name behind &#34;double yolk&#34; is if you ask for 1 egg, you get 2, 2 eggs, you get 4, etc. So I guess if you want 3 eggs, you have to ask for 1.5 eggs.

On a side note, this restaurant is on restaurant.com, so you can save some money that way."

However, when we got our bill, we were upcharged a dollar each  for &#34;large&#34; coffees. This made no sense. They own the cafe next door, the businesses are connected and diners are eating on either side of the french doors.  They should have put our coffee in a  regular mug and brought it to us. Instead they served it in  LARGE TO GO cups and upcharged us a dollar each. Not what we asked for....

Then, we were also up charged for 2 sides of gluten free pancakes. No where on the menu does it tell you there is a fee for gluten free this and the waitress did not tell us either.  It simply showed up on the bill. We would not have each ordered a gluten free side because our main meal was the omelette.  We simply wanted to try their &#34;gluten free&#34;. When I brought this up with the hostess, she said they have received this feedback and they are working to update the menus.  She said the waitress was, &#34;new&#34; and that is why she didn&#39;t tell us.

So..... no menu listing, no warning from the waitress and we paid an extra $2 per omelette which is 24% of the cost of the entire menu item! So, overall we were up-charged $6 on the entire bill. Which is not a fortune, but on a $30 meal that is 20%, which is completely ridiculous.  The  hostess went to talk to the owner and he didn&#39;t care, he was unwilling to modify our bill or apologize for the confusion.

We won&#39;t be back.  This is not the service, we are looking for. It&#39;s not worth the hassle for a $30 breakfast!"

The portions are really big as well. I have gotten a to-go box a couple times because I couldn&#39;t finish it all. I have never heard anyone complain about this place. There is usually a line so make sure you come early. They have a really talented wait staff. It is an overall fantastic experience at the Double Yoke! 5/5

We were looking for a kid-friendly place that had a good selection of breakfast/brunch items.  Double Yolk fit the bill.  

Although they looked very busy on first glance of arrival, we were surprised to find out the wait was only around 5 minutes.  It seems that they have recently acquired the space next door, which has opened up additional seating for them.  We were greeted quickly by our server and was asked for drink orders.  They had the usual selection of breakfast type drinks. 

Now onto the menu! They had an extensive breakfast menu with a little bit of something for everyone.  If you want to get allot for your money that doesn&#39;t skimp on quality, then this is the place to go.  The omelette that I tried was delish.  It came with a choice of hashbrowns or fruit and a choice of 2 pancakes or toast (tons of varieties of breads).  If you leave Double Yolk hungry, then you must have a huge appetite! I couldn&#39;t finish my entire order!!

Overall I would recommend Double Yolk! They have quick service and good food with great pricing.  Try it out the next time you are in Aurora!"

The service was great and everyone was friendly. I ordered the country fried steak with scrambled eggs and upgraded my pancakes that came with my meal to French Toast for $1.50. The eggs were perfect, gravy was good as well but the French Toast was eggy and pretty dense. My friend got the burger which was over sized, the bun fell apart and it was cooked well done (they didn&#39;t ask how he would like it cooked, which would have been medium rare). The bacon that came on the burger was unfortunately flavorless. I understand a breakfast place not having the best burger but I definitely expect the bacon to be good! Overall, a nice place with a great atmosphere."

Double Yolk is so close to home for me that it was an instant hit. Killer biscuits and gravy. I&#39;ve had the country Benedict a few times now as well. 

The staff has been stellar and on point with every need being fulfilled. High quality of service. I could see where this place would be packed on the weekends with long wait times. But the food and service are worth it.  If I see anyone bawling over an hour wait for a party of six or more on a weekend morning...y&#39;all need to go to IHOP or something. This place is quality. Just have some patience. It&#39;s worth the wait.

Prices are excellent. I heard someone complain on here and in a conversation that this place was too high priced. If you want cheap by a dollar or so, go to McDonald&#39;s next door. I&#39;ve eaten at places twice as expensive and not as good in quality and service. So give that a rest as well.

Did I mention killer biscuits and gravy yet? It&#39;s usually the first thing I try. Because if you mess that up, the rest of the food is gonna suck. And it is primo here. 

Keep up the good work folks. You have a new regular."

Additional seating in the rear of cafe. It&#39;s been a soft open for them the last 2 months. They make their own gelato and pastries. You can be served or have a meeting in there too.

I just love their creative dishes. They offer affordable specials during the week both lunch and breakfast, which includes coffee. You have to try the breakfast burger. Always a great deal when you can have biscuits and gravy for your side. Great healthy items too.

And just like the name says... except double yolks when ordering eggs. I certainly enjoyed the egg white sandwich with spinach and fruit this morning. #eatinghealthy"

One such place was Double Yolk in Aurora, I passed by it one day, added it to my bookmarks for a future visit. 

Once I headed in the layout seemed very familiar, it reminded me a lot of a place I&#39;ve reviewed prior to this called Mapleberry Pancake House. I was seated, given a menu and took some time to look over the menu. I eventually settled on a meat lovers skillet with pancakes rather than toast as the side. Within ten minutes my order was out and it was time to dig in.

With a name like double yolk I thought perhaps they gave you double the number of eggs ordered. There are a few other breakfast places that do that, though that did not appear to be the case here. There was a big egg pile towards the center of my skillet with meats, cheese, and the rest of the skillet below. There was sausage, ham and bacon in the skillet as the meats and all were tasty and they didn&#39;t skimp on the meat amount. The potato at the bottom was a little on the bland side but was crisper and more flavorful than most. The way the cheese and different meats blended together really put the &#34;skill&#34; in skillet. This was an excellent combination and overall this was an outstanding skillet.

The pancakes that came with my skillet were good as well. They were soft and had a good texture. Had some powdered sugar on top for extra flavor and a nice rich maple syrup to go with them. I&#39;d say these were good pancakes as well.

My overall experience at Double Yolk was positive. Service was speedy and I was happy with my food. I&#39;ll recommend it, this is a review that&#39;s right on the border between four and five stars. The fast service and comfortable atmosphere will nudge it just over that line. So I&#39;m five stars for Double Yolk and while I&#39;m not egging you to try it, if you&#39;re in the area I&#39;d recommend it for breakfast."

While expectations were mixed based on the exterior, we were pleasantly surprised with what we found. 

Specializing in breakfast, but with additional offerings, it&#39;s like going to a Denny&#39;s that doesn&#39;t remind you of sad Christmas movies, but I digress.

We were seated promptly and greeted with menu&#39;s that offered Swedish, German, and &#39;Merican pancakes. My better half had some Swedish lingenberry pancakes that were reminiscent of Crepe&#39;s and I had some delicious corned beef hash. Good, not great, coffee. A buddy had the Shamrock Benedict and it definitely won best breakfast for the group. A solid take on the old favorite and with corned beef hash to boot!

Overall, we were really impressed with this spot. Felt much more like a localish spot than a chain. Somewhere we&#39;ll likely hit up again."

It&#39;s kind of annoying, because in my mind, the &#34;perfect&#34; breakfast place is something like a Waffle House in the deep south- Filthy, cheap as hell, a dude with prison tattoos behind the grill, a waitress who is always ready to tell you her latest tale of woe... and amazing food and coffee to eat and drink while listening to it.

Well, Double Yolk doesn&#39;t have most of that. It&#39;s clean and well lit, I wouldn&#39;t really describe it as cheap (But it&#39;s not exactly expensive either), I&#39;ve yet to spot any kind of prison tattoos, and all the waitresses are surprisingly pleasant, even when you show up super early. I guess the only thing that actually counts when it comes to a restaurant is how good the food is, and Double Yolk nails it. We&#39;ve been here a bunch, and have tried a ton of stuff on the menu, and haven&#39;t ever been disappointed.

In fact, here&#39;s a tip for you- Biscuits and gravy can be added as a side instead of pancakes or whatever. I&#39;ve never seen a restaurant do this, as biscuits and gravy are typically their own entree item. GET THEM. They&#39;re good, and essentially free with whatever you order. I feel like this has to be some kind of menu design oversight, but, you might as well take advantage of it.

The portion sizes here are insane, which I guess is good for &#39;merica and all, but I always find myself wishing they had some secret menu where you get half as much food for half price. I love the food here, but I hate that I always end up throwing half of it away while still walking out feeling stuffed. I guess there&#39;s worse things to complain about.

Oh, also, look around for signs in their window. You get a coupon for sending a text message to a SMS short code. Presumably this is to spam you with text messages, but I haven&#39;t had any issues. 

I wish they had real cream instead of those gross shelf-stable creamer cups, but, it doesn&#39;t seem like anywhere in the Aurora area serves real cream to go with your coffee so they&#39;re on pretty even footing there.

So, yeah, check out Double Yolk, you won&#39;t be disappointed... Unless of course you&#39;re like me and your barometer for how good your breakfast is going to be is calibrated solely to spider web and tear drop tattoos."

We arrived around 12:30pm on a Sunday, I&#39;m willing to bet we missed most of the regular Sunday crowd (luckily!). Our food came out in less than 10 minutes, it felt almost instant. I had the Eggs Benedict, which is usually a telltale dish-- I&#39;ve found its easy to ruin hollandaise sauce, but theirs was fantastic. My husband got the Greek skillet, he said it&#39;s the best he&#39;s had, and he&#39;s tried quite a few! We shared a side of biscuits &amp; gravy, I normally only have a bite or two (usually too heavy for my taste) but I love it &amp; finished mine-- fluffier gravy and a very firm, buttery biscuit (yum!). The service was attentive and friendly, price was very reasonable. I wish we lived closer, we&#39;d make it a regular breakfast place!"

It is hard to pick a favorite as all are amazing.  After the tour, I brought home some of the beautiful pastries to share with my family as well as more gelato.  WOW!

I always told myself to give it a try some weekday a.m. I&#39;m off.   So, since the preferred destination of Ari&#39;s Kitchen was closed,  yesterday was that day.   Since I also was having surgery at night &amp; had to stop eating at 10 a.m., I  figured I&#39;ll try it &amp; make on big meal out of it.  

I walked in to a very clean restaurant around 8 a.m.  The only other patrons were a older group of guys, probably a coffee klatsch (sp?).  I was promptly greeted &amp; placed in a booth.  The hostess asked me for my beverage of choice before I could even get my jacket off, which was appreciated.  My large Diet Pepsi (minus points for not having Coke in my opinion) was fresh &amp; tasty.....which is VERY important to me as a fountain pop snob. 

The menu was pretty big with lots of great sounding options.  I tend to stick with omelets &amp; hash browns when I go out.  However today, they had a &#39;truckers skillet&#34; with 2 eggs, onions, peppers, ham, bacon, sausage.  As an avid carnivore, I ordered that &amp; a biscuit to neutralize the grease that would soon hit my stomach.  

The skillet was very good.  The eggs were soft &amp; fluffy.  There were plant of  meats (though the sausage appeared to be just slices of links), veggies &amp; cheese underneath.  All in all, a very tasty &amp; satisfying skillet.  The biscuit looked really tasty but was rather pressed and dense for my liking &amp; was a bit of a letdown.  

Service was very good, as one would expect when they are 50% of the places patrons at the time.  My Diet Pepsi glass never got close to empty.  The check came &amp; was for $12, excluding tip.

All in all, good service &amp; very good food for a good price. I&#39;d give it 5 stars but the biscuit was a letdown as was not having Coke products. Then again, as one of my favorite comics says, you can&#39;t have everything because where would you put it?"

Recently, a new menu was implemented with higher prices, of course. Then today my friend and I noticed that when we ordered 2 eggs, there were 3 yolks instead of the usual 4, hence the name &#34;Double Yolk&#34;. We were told that they had cut back and this is now the norm. Also, I think they changed to a cheaper product for bacon. The slices were smaller and it definitely had a different taste.  So, at the same time prices were raised, they have switched to cheaper products and practices.  I think I&#39;ll eat somewhere else from now on."

I ordered the extremely simple Denver Omelette meal and subbed the ham for turkey. I added American cheese to the eggs and glazed strawberries to the pancakes. The eggs and potatoes came out first, I started breaking them to look and make sure they&#39;d used the correct cheese, but there was none so I sent them back at the same time she returned with the pancakes. The pancakes were blah and the glazed strawberries were served cold...I would never serve a cold glazed strawberry on pancakes. Anyway, when the Omelette came back it was the same eggs that I&#39;d broken open to check with cheese added to the top of it. So I just sent it back. This place is a joke. During check out when asked what I thought of the meal I informed them I didn&#39;t enjoy it and I was asked if I was the one with the Omelette. I replied yes and this woman had the nerves to say I removed the Omelette from the bill. I replied I would hope so since I sent it back.

I was getting angry reading these other reviews!

Double Yolk is a new, and welcome, addition to Aurora. They have an extensive breakfast and lunch menu - and I heard a rumor they may be serving up dinner a few nights a week in the near future. Double Yolk offers traditional breakfast food that is consistently delicious. It&#39;s also the most affordable breakfast we&#39;ve had in the area - let&#39;s just say since it&#39;s opened we&#39;ve abandoned our usual breakfast spots. 

Please don&#39;t be swayed be these haters - check out Double Yolk and I know you&#39;ll enjoy the friendly atmosphere, bright space, and scrumptious breakfast food, or I&#39;ll reimburse you, okay not really, but you won&#39;t be disappointed!"

Anyone that has read a breakfast review of mine before knows of my quest for homemade corned beef hash and ding!, ding!, ding! Double Yolk fits the bill. (You can really tell the difference.)  So in addition to them having this leg up going in, I&#39;ve gotta say, I also loved Sweedish pancakes and Amie loved the spinach-cheese omlette.  Once we could be seated (a 10-20 minute wait on a Sunday morning is to be expected if the place is good!), the menu was pretty extensive, the service was prompt and friendly and the ambiance not too loud.  

Bottom line is that just about all bases are covered here.  Especially with reasonable pricing, the only reason I can&#39;t go 5-stars was that the coffee was pretty bland and the accommodations and process for those waiting to be seated is clearly inadequate.  A counter for solo patrons would be nice too, but otherwise this place on the northwest edge of Aurora/North Aurora is a real keeper and highly recommended."

We then placed our orders.  Two kids meals: the silver dollar pancakes with bacon and the scrambled eggs with sausage. Then the two adult orders:  a broccoli and cheese omelet and a breakfast burrito.  The silver dollar pancakes arrived with the sausage instead of bacon.The scrambled eggs came with no side.  The breakfast burrito had ham in it which was not stated on the menu.  I feel like it would be much better if service was on point and the menu matched what you were brought.

Now we never get by this way.  We just happened to accidentally go this way and see the Double Yolk one day.  I&#39;ve been wanting to try it out ever since!

It&#39;s nicely decorated and quite inviting inside.  We were told there was a 10 minute wait at 11am on Saturday morning, but it was just a few minutes.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  

We both had a skillet and shared an order of Potato Pancakes.  I&#39;m picky about my cakes and these looked quite eggy... I must say they were really good!  They had a nice flavor of onions and garlic!  There were 3 large cakes to a serving, so we left with extra!

I had the Country Skillet which had Hash Browns, Biscuits, Sausage Gravy, Scrambled Eggs, and Mozzarella Cheese.  The hash browns were nothing special.  I&#39;ll go back some time to try their Home Fries.  The Sausage Gravy though was pretty good.  My bff and I judge places on their gravy!  Just for that we&#39;ll be back!

We had heard nothing about it, only saw it when it was closed as we were pulling into the parkinglot for karaoke at JJ&#39;s one night.  On our first visit we were impressed, and by now (too many visits to count), I can safely say, this is our favorite spot for breakfast.

The first time we walked in the door, the cute hostess with the british accent showed us to our table with a smile, the waitress got our orders exactly right and the manager (owner?) visited our table just to be sure everything was fantastic...which it was.  

By our second visit, almost the entire staff recognized my friend and I, asked us about our week, and treated us, not like guests, but members of the family.  We were hooked.  

The menu is not to be passed over in this review either.  In addition to the friendly, warm, inviting atmosphere, the menu is diverse, unique and delicious!  Favorite items of this sweet-toothed girl are the Tarimisu Pancakes and the Crazy Monkey Belgian Waffle!  (Come on, how can you not smile with a name like the Crazy MonkeY!?)  

My honest opinion: if you are looking for a place to meet with a friend, bond over some comfort food and have a gigantic cup of hot coffee (with flavored creamer if you so desire), this is the place to go.  If you are looking for delicious food, and fast, friendly service, and to still have enough money left over to go shopping over at those outlets, THIS is the place to go.

The service here is some of the kindest in the area and I am very grateful to find this breakfast/lunch place. I never leave here hungry. Not horribly expensive, but not cheap either. I believe it is worth it since you can taste the quality in the food. Fruit is always fresh and perfect and breakfast is definitely the best meal served here. I will be back again for sure."

So when we do, we try to make it someplace special (Maggiano&#39;s, Mexican, etc.).  But this particular day, he was begging me for some breakfast food.

Far be it for me to stand in the way of someone else&#39;s craving!  So we drove the five minutes from his work to Double Yolk.  Neither of us had been there before, and it&#39;s not likely either of us will return anytime soon.

We were seated right away, and they seemed to have a healthy lunch crowd, which was good for them.  It didn&#39;t slow our service down at all.  Our waitress was really nice (remember this for later), but the food was lackluster.

My husband got the french toast, and it came with a side of eggs.  I ordered the veggie omelet with pancakes as my side.

We also got a sweet roll on the side, and that came out first, like an appetizer.  She asked us if we wanted it toasted.  It sounded strange, but it was really delicious.  This actually saved my meal for me because...

...two bites into my omelet, I noticed a long, black, nasty hair in my food.  It was ENTWINED and BAKED into it.  My appetite for anything else was gone at that point.

Our waitress noticed something was wrong and I told her about the hair.  She was really, really apologetic and she felt awful.  She offered to make me a new one, but I was pretty much grossed out at that point and just wanted to leave.  She ended up taking it off the bill, which was really nice of her.

Overall, I am still really disgusted, so I likely won&#39;t be back.  There are better (and cleaner) places in the area to try."

Among my favorite places are Cracker Barrel and Original Pancake House (Walker Bros).  Or I should say, it WAS.   This place rocks.   The pancakes are HUGE plate size and taste great!!  Not too fluffy, nice malted flavor, actual normal maple syrup (not like Cracker Barrel with the natural stuff) and the portions are also MASSIVE.  Yes as the name hints, 1 egg = 2.  Sausages are almost the size of a jumbo hot dog.  Swedish Pancakes are FANTASTIC (they taste like 49ers Flapjacks.... Mmmmmm).

I am not shy in saying this is the best breakfast spot I have ever been to, and I have been everywhere.... I seek out Waffle House whenever possible, and I avoid I HOP and Denny&#39;s like the plague, they suck.  Double Yolk, is relatively inexpensive, as I ate fro about $9 with the coffee, served in a big mug good creamer too.

Heard the thin pizzas ruled at Armand&#39;s so I took the word of others and went for the entrees. 

Julie, at the bar, was sharp, friendly, and attentive. She did what many don&#39;t do...silently pays attention to details, I.e. Bread butter water, is order correct. Two stars just for her. 

Caprese salad served with and aged balsamic. Nice flavor generous for two. One more star if the tomatoes had been farm market. 

But the linguine and clams!!! OMG!!!! Delicate clams buried in al dente linguine with a balanced and flavor filled olio sauce. Really fine...mighty fine.

Requested the lasagna in two containers, for the two of us.  Arrived in 1.  Seeing that it appears to be cooked in it, I understand.  No dings for that.  Asked for dried crushed red peppers. There were none.  And of course, only one fork, as the note was obviously not read.  The lasagna serving, while large, wasn&#39;t well spiced and was a bit watery.  Below average flavor.

Not off to a good start.  We then tried the thin crust pizza with sausage.  The sausage was quite good.  Nice flavor and texture.  As good as it was, it couldn&#39;t overcome the overcooked crust or cheese, or the taste of burned crust.  A surprisingly poor performance, for a Saturday night.  Clearly, the &#34;A&#34; team was on break.  However, at these prices, neither my buddy or I will be risking good money after bad."

  Tonight I ordered out and was disappointed. The thin crust wast thicker than it was previously. We also ordered the vodka sauce which was ok but very small and dry. The worst however was pasta fagoli soup which was so thick when I turned it up side down it stuck to the container! It tasted burnt. 
   All and all the pizza is still fantastic and I would order it again. However, I won&#39;t stray away from pizza when ordering next time. Which is a total bummer."

They have tons of beer on tap and if you go on a Thursdays, their beer is half off. Come on! You can&#39;t go wrong with that. Pizza and beer!

I was in the mood for something new so I decided on Armand&#39;s Victory Tap. It&#39;s located on the edge of the Yorktown Mall in Lombard. 

I walked in with my husband shortly after they opened. There were a few groups that walked in at the same time but we still had great service. Our server (Staci) did a fantastic job!! 

She welcomed us right away and brought us a list of drink and food specials. We were able to take our time before placing our drink and good orders. Armand&#39;s is known for their pizza but we both ordered sandwiches--great choice. I ordered the Beef Marc Antony sandwich--filled with a large portion of Italian beef. I could not believe the portion size--great value. The sandwich had a great flavor. My advice would be to make it a fork and knife sandwich!

We asked the bartender for assistance since we never been to an Armand&#39;s before. Obviously the easy choice would be pizza, so the we asked about other items on the menu. We landed on starter soups (chicken noodle), baked ziti and fresh cavatelli with vodka sauce. All great choices!

The only downside was the fact that the place is really small inside.  If it&#39;s busy, you may be waiting a long time to get a table.  It might just be better to take the food to-go.

After visiting the Elmhurst location for many years, we recently discovered a new Armand&#39;s in Yorktown Center - whooo hooo - what a find!

The place is small but so cute - it looks like a tavern you might see in the 40&#39;s-50&#39;s with pictures of movie stars on the wall.  The menu has all the signature Armand&#39;s specialties...the Stuffed Artichoke being one of our favorites.  I really liked their extensive drink menu and tried the Bourbon Grapefruit and Basil cocktail and really enjoyed it.  

The pizza is delightfully thin and ridiculously crisp, topped with fresh ingredients and the perfect amount of cheese.  You can feel and taste the cornmeal on the bottom of the crust - which is what sets Armand&#39;s pizza apart from the others.  This might be the one place where I could eat an entire pizza all by myself!  

Aside from the very sparse outdoor seating area - there is nothing lacking at this newest outlet of a suburban Chicago institution. They should do very well in this location, I know we will be regulars."

It&#39;s outside at the Shops on Butterfield, next to Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s. It&#39;s not a big space, neatly divided with about 10 tables on one side and a bar and high tops on the other. Black and white tile, Edison bulbs, pictures of 50s movie stars, a big chalkboard with the specials on it. Looks very nice.

I think they&#39;re going for more of a classic Italian restaurant vibe, which I appreciate, but ... here&#39;s my first nitpick -- there aren&#39;t really appetizers, per se. There are &#34;small plates&#34; and salads. The small plates include clams, bruschetta, a fresh mozzarella plate, calamari, and then things that are basically small entrees -- ribs, sausage, even chicken parmesan.

I mean, I have no problem with this, but I feel like there should be a few more appetizery things, mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini, maybe some toasted ravioli? In any case we started with the ricotta and crostini plate and there goes another nitpick -- it was a generous portion of whipped ricotta with four weenie little toasts.

Now, they did serve us all the complimentary warm bread we wanted, so that filled out the plate, but why would you serve a large portion of spreadable cheese meant to be eaten with bread and then only put four little toasts on the plate? Surely the toast is the inexpensive part? 

But the ricotta was delicious, and the bread was pretty tasty too. So there is that.

We also got a 14&#34; thin crust with pepperoni, and it was delicious. The crust was crunchy-crispy and the cheese was nicely browned in spots, which I dig. All in all a very tasty pizza.

Service was reasonably good. We stuck with water this time but they do have a full bar and decent beer list.

Guys, if you add toasted ravioli or similar starters, or even just put more bread with the ricotta, we&#39;re likely to be back. And I&#39;m sure there will be some carryout in our future."

They&#39;re not little kids, (10-17) but I mean, they got a whole new lesson on the birds and the bees. I totally understand that this was not the restaurants fault other than the size of the place.

Tried the chicken Parmesan - very good! Couldn&#39;t help but notice the tempting looking entrees others ordered. Everything looks very, very tasty.

Upon hearing I&#39;d never tried it, his jaw dropped. &#34;You&#39;ve never had a thin-crust Armands or a stuffed artichoke? We HAVE to go.&#34; We came in for lunch a few months ago and I was instantly hooked on the crispy, crunchy thin crust. I ordered the lunch special pizza w/ roasted red peppers and sausage. It also came with a salad. We also ordered the clams and artichokes as an appetizer. Like I said before, their pizza is great. If you enjoy thin crust, then I definitely recommend giving them a try. The lunch special is the way to go as it&#39;s a pretty decent sized individual pizza and you also get the salad to go along. I will also make a side note not to come here if you&#39;re on any time of time restraints. We&#39;d arrived at 11:15 and didn&#39;t make it back to work until almost 12:45. There was a party of 10 that got here well after we did, but their pizzas were all put into the oven before ours. I ended up being late back to work.

We gave them another try this past weekend when the Armand&#39;s in Wheaton was closed. (Side note, the one in Lombard *IS* open on Sundays, as opposed to the Wheaton location which stays closed all day.) My husband&#39;s family came over so I left the ordering up to him, but we ended up spending $70 for two pizzas and a salad. It turns out that you&#39;re charged for each topping an astronomical amount of money. They have &#34;recommended&#34; pizza listings but if you order a 14 inch 1856 pizza, you&#39;ll end up spending $8.25 on toppings alone (+$15 for the pizza) and $10 for a 16 inch (+17 for the pizza.) I definitely understand charging a surcharge for toppings as opposed to a cheese pizza ,but I think these prices are way too high. I think it would be nice if they put prices next to the &#34;recommended pizza&#34; to make it more clear. Also, I actually the simple pizzas were better anyway. Try the Uncle Mikes! It&#39;s my fave.

The artichoke is all that and worth every penny. I love them. However, I wouldn&#39;t order the family style $14 Armand&#39;s salad again. I thought it&#39;d be a huge salad, but it wasn&#39;t anything special and not all that big for the money.

I give Armand&#39;s a 3 star based on taste and value. The taste of the pizza is great, but be advised that you&#39;ll probably end up spending more than you normally would on pizza."

It wasnt busy at the time we were eating. 
The bread basket had some crouton foccacia pieces in it. Had to ask for more regular sized pieces.   

My dad ordered a house salad and we ordered a pizza. Salad never came. 

Pizza was over cooked and burned.

My mom was never asked if she would like another glass of wine.

I begged for some more iced tea. 

No servers to be found. One busboy wandering around. 

We got our check and was not offered anything for the missed salad. 

This busboy started stacking dishes on our table in front of us and grabbing my iced tea! I had not finished. Can you possibly wait until we pay the bill until you clear everything off? 

Note to Armands...get a restaurant manager!

I cant believe this can be the same restaurant family owners from Elmwood Park when their grandmother was cooking in the kitchen.

This service/food would never fly there."

The only qualm I had is with the pizza itself. While the crust was great and the ingredients fresh, the pie itself was bland. If the sausage was more flavorful and a few more spices used, this pizza would be near perfect."

I had been going to the Elmwood Park location with my parents as far back as I can remember. Once they opened their Arlington Heights location, we were stoked. I recently moved to Lombard and was THRILLED to see that this location was open. Hands down the best thin crust cheese and sausage pizza anywhere...even better than their AHTS and Elmhurst location. My mom says its just like the old Elmwood Park location. Whenever we go, we split the antipasto salad and a sausage pizza. I have ordered the baked ziti and meatballs, and that was outstanding as well, but the smell of the pizza made me miss not getting a pizza too! I&#39;m here typically once a week, whether it&#39;s carry out or dining in. I just wish the restaurant was bigger, you need to get there early, it fills up fast! Understandably so!

The good : crust is great

Cons: way too many peppers. And they were sweet peppers you usually get on Italian beef. Wouldn&#39;t get that topping ever again. 
            Bland sauce and sausage. Also skimpy of the sausage. Too much cheese
            
Big Con- delivery driver totally tilted the pizza when he removed it from the carrier.  Shifting the cheese. He also didn&#39;t have a pen. 
 
I&#39;m sure we will give it one more chance. But there is way better pizza in the area. Especially Sals in Lombard and Angelos in Downers Grove."

The food was tasty if you&#39;re looking outside commercial delivery, not that there&#39;s anything wrong with that. I&#39;ll move on to the food. We ordered the 1956 Supreme (sausage, pepp, shrooms, green peps and onions). Great taste, crunchy crust, and a proper amount of even toppings. We also ordered the Signature Nova (artichoke, Fontinella cheese, roasted red peps, and basil). A refreshing za, olive oil based sauce instead of tomato. You also get complimentary bread and oil. Nice.


A few things that I could do without, the pricing for the Signature Pizza suggestions are great suggestions but the prices are not included. We got a bit caught off guard when we ordered the 1956 Supreme and were charged the pizza plus all of the ingredients. It&#39;d be nice to have the price included ahead of time. Also charged an alcohol tax. The second comment is in regards to the service. Overall, good service and nice folks. With this being a new establishment, it&#39;s somewhat expected to have a wait staff with not as much experience as others. However, they are very willing to make sure you have a nice visit. There seemed to be more staff than customers which was kind of strange. Finally, &#34;Victory Tap&#34; is in the name, but not sure if they actually had Victory beer, although it could have another meaning. But good beer selection and a nice big bar. A beer menu would be a good thing to include.

Smile when you order!"

I always rate pizza based off the style they are known for and only getting cheese. This pizza was subpar.  The artichoke app was also kind of strange but the inside was tasty.  We tried the pasta on the second visit and it was pretty good.  Everything tastes homemade but the flavor isn&#39;t that strong.  Got homemade mozzarella sticks and they were awesome.

We ordered the house salad with their house dressing and a 14&#34; sausage, green pepper and onion pizza . First problem - way too much stuff on the pizza. I don&#39;t want skimpy toppings, but the amount of green peppers and onions was excessive,  but the amount of sausage was not enough. And there wasn&#39;t enough sauce.  Good thing was that the end pieces were nice and thin and crispy like we wanted, but the middle seemed soggy and under-cooked.  The salad was good and I really liked their house dressing.  It was a red wine vinaigrette, but it had a creamy consistency.  The salad was fresh and plentiful.

Service was good and she did a good job at refilling our drinks. 

The inside of the restaurant isn&#39;t super big and I kind of wondered if when they get really busy if you are sharing a table with others - not sure. 

We will give it another try so we can try a small thin crust pizza with only sausage, extra sauce and possibly try their pasta. But if their food isn&#39;t good, it would be the last time we would be back."

First off, horrible service! Our waiter was so slow and barely came over to our table. He would ask us how we were doing while walking away from us. The staff should be more attentive to their tables. We started off with the calamari which wasn&#39;t bad, but we also had the minestrone soup which was AWFUL! It was bland, flavorless, and just flat out disgusting!! I would not recommend that soup to anyone. After we finished our calamari, it took about 15-20 minutes just to get our food, which wasn&#39;t the worst part!!! I had the chicken limone and I have no words to describe how disgusting it was. I took one bite and didn&#39;t touch the plate the rest of the night. My fiancé had the chicken Parmesan which tasted like I was eating rubber, it was not cooked properly at all.

The eggplant parmesan dish was my fave.  
We stopped by again over this past weekend. Much to the chagrin of my husband, I&#39;m not much of a pizza lover.  I have to REALLY LOVE the pizza or I don&#39;t even want to order it.  The place was really busy and we walked by a table that had a deep dish (or do they call it &#39;pan&#39;?  I can&#39;t remember) but it was the thick kind.  I told my husband we were ordering that.  He was thrilled!   Turns out it tasted as good as it looked!  We ordered a huge one so that we would have leftovers.  I just had the last piece for BREAKFAST this morning, which prompted me to take the time to write a review.  Thanks, Victory Tap, for making my husband love me more now that we found a place where we can order pizza together as a REAL couple.

Tried their sausage and a hawaiin. Both pizzas were undercooked, and the dough was very soft an inch or so in from the crust. This made it pretty hard to eat as you couldn&#39;t really pick the pieces up. But the god news is they were so delicious it was only a minor inconvenience! Probably the best hawaiin I&#39;ve ever had. The ham was crispy and so yummy, it&#39;s saltiness set off perfectly by the pineapples sweetness. 
  Service was really good. Perhaps a bit too good for my mom&#39;s taste as we had 3 diffrent people swooping in every couple minutes clearing plates, refilling sodas (without being asked) bringing bread. The extra bread came in handy to use with the ricotta spread we got as as an appetizer as it really didn&#39;t come with enough crustini. But yea that was pretty good too and there was plenty of it.

We ordered drinks and a cheese and sausage thin crust pizza, they were out of the bottled beer I had ordered so I ordered something different. Shortly after the drinks were served the bartender came to the table and appologized for being out, never have had that happen before..ever.
The pizza was what we expected, crust a bit thinner than I remembered but I am not complaining. Alcohol was fairly priced. Service was outstanding.

Apparently they have a pizza BOGO on Tuesday nights and half price wine on Wednesdays.

If there is a downside it is the additional taxes the Village of Lombard has levied on Yorktown, a higher sales tax and alcohol tax. That is not Armand&#39;s fault."

We ate the pizza that they made wrong and it was awful. The cornmeal crust was so thick and hard to chew it hurt our teeth. The sauce was plain and had no flavor or spices. The cheese was very scarce and the only good thing on the pizza was the sausage.  How could they mess up our pizza when there was only two other tables having a pizza?

We sat at.a high top in the bar. We started with the Buratta salad with arugula and stuffed artichoke. The artichoke was way over done and drowned in oil. We ordered a thin crust and a Sicilian pizza. The Sicilian we had to take home because we didn&#39;t realize it had meat in the sauce and it was good Friday. As for the thin crust, Ive had frozen pizza that tasted better unfortunately.  Service was over solicitous and a little bothersome. Also more expensive than you would expect for this kind of food."

They have other things on the menu, including a tasty sounding black bean veggie burger, but I don&#39;t care, I&#39;m here for the hot dog.

A great sandwich and dog place.  I indulged myself a bit in order to get a good fair review out of my meal, so...
* Italian Beef - 4 stars.  Served with sweet and hot peppers, dipped.  A pretty good sandwich a great serving size!
* Chili Dog - 3 stars.  Served with cheese and onions.  I didn&#39;t think the chili cut it for me.  Seemed a little flat on taste.
* Fries - 5 stars.  Served with a side of cheese.  These are fresh cut fries, and they taste GREAT.  Best part of the meal.
* Green River Soda - The second restaurant I&#39;ve seen that serves it.  If you don&#39;t know, it&#39;s a prohibition era Chicago Classic (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_River_%28soft_drink%29).

Other noteworthy items... buy a shake, get drink refills for life (everything but shakes from the sounds of it).  So that&#39;s a cup that&#39;s definitely going back with me.  They also look like they have two sand valley ball courts and a hot tub, none were active when I was there, but it leaves questions for the imagination!

Overall, a place to visit again, but a bit of a hike for me so maybe not for a while."

The hot dog at this Scooby&#39;s has an excellent taste, the condiments are applied very well and the hot dog has a nice flavor. The buns aren&#39;t always the softest but are never hard. The pickle used isn&#39;t too thick. There&#39;s no sign of celery salt on the dog. The sport peppers aren&#39;t too hot. Overall this is an above average example of a Chicago style hot dog.

 The fries are fresh cut style which are nice, but a little on the greasy side. This Scooby&#39;s also has Green River in with their fountain drinks which is a big thumbs up in my book. The only major complaint I have about this Scooby&#39;s is their operating hours as it seems like they close around 7:00 or 8:00 PM most nights.

Overall, my experience is that at least the hot dogs are better here than the Scooby&#39;s in West Chicago and I&#39;ll give it one more star than that Scooby&#39;s received. So four stars for Scooby&#39;s in Downers Grove."

This is a classic Chicago hot dog joint. Small, kinda shabby, but the kinda place you know you&#39;re going to get the great Chicago classics- Hot dogs, beef, Polish, tamales, gyros, etc.

Excellent hot dogs and fries. I love the way they fill the bottom of the brown paper sack with the fresh cut fries so the grease soaks into the bag so everyone can see you&#39;re carrying something good in there.

Love their gyros, served classic style- it&#39;s just really good.

I&#39;m also a big fan of their burgers. They&#39;ve got a nice flame grill there that cooks the burgers up right. The double cheese burger is awesome. Perfect char on the burgers and melts the cheese. 

Scooby&#39;s is one of the increasingly few old school Chicago style hot dog stands that in my book blow away the big chains like Portillo&#39;s, Al&#39;s and Buona Beef any day.

Too bad these places seem to be dying. I urge everyone in the Chicago area to seek out and patronize these local hangouts.

Gyros are from the cone and about what you&#39;d expect.

I love hot dog stands. Good ol&#39; greasy pits spitting out burgers, fries andall sorts of heart-clogging goodies. Scooby&#39;s doesn&#39;t look special from the outside. As a veteran of the grease-eating scene I didn&#39;t think much of it but my wife swears by the place so we grabbed some grub from there this evening.

They have 12 different combos involving pretty much every sandwich they offer. My wife opted for their two hotdog combo while I went for the double cheeseburger combo. We also ordered a gravy bread to share. Service was polite but slow, especially seeing as the hot dogs are already cooked and from what I could see, so were the hamburger patties. Most of the waiting seemed to be waiting for their fresh-cut fries. Of note is they serve GREEN RIVER, something all my Fluky&#39;s loving homeboys will understand as being very important at a hot dog stand. 

The loss of a star is for price. The meal came to over $14 for what would only be a $10 affair within city limits. It&#39;s the cost of living in the burbs, I suppose, but as we can&#39;t deduct half stars it will have to do.

Overall I was happy with the food. Their grilled onions had bite to them, not much like so many inferior places. The fries really were good, much better than most others I&#39;ve tried at similar stands though they could use more seasoning. It was Good Grease[tm] to be sure. The Green River capped off the great experience and we&#39;ll definitely be returning to Scooby&#39;s when the hankering returns."

We live near the Downers Grove location and when we need some good cheap food we head down to Scooby&#39;s.  The most recent time we visited my girlfriend got a hamburger and fries and I got the Maxwell Polish and a Chicago Style Hot Dog.  

The hamburger is just that a hamburger, nothing more and nothing less.  It is a good size and has fresh toppings.  The fries are fresh cut and pretty good.  They were a little too salty this last time, but times in the past they were fine.

My hot dog was really good.  Served Chicago style which is the only way I will eat a hot dog.  Scooby&#39;s hangs with a lot of famous hot dog places.  The polish was pretty good.  Nothing fancy, it was a little over cooked, but still good.

One of the big things I love about Scooby&#39;s is that they have Green River soda in their fountain, which is a rare find.  Who doesn&#39;t love a an endless supply the world&#39;s greatest soda.

To sum it all up.  Will I go back to Scooby&#39;s? Yes.  Will I recommend Scooby&#39;s to my friends? Sure.  Scooby&#39;s is a good place for a good hot dog, some Green River, and some fries.  They aren&#39;t going to break any new culinary ground, but maybe that&#39;s a good thing."

The bread was stale, the chili wasnt good, and the chocolate milkshake was vanilla with barely any choc syrup swirled in.   (Its filthy inside too, the seat my friend was sitting on was broke!)

It&#39;s located in downtown Downers in the small strip mall by the nail place and the Downers Grove Food Market. They are a kitchen only, so carry out is your only option. 

The food is pretty good, but not excellent. I got Thai red curry and the bf got pad thai. When I placed the order and asked for extra vegetables in my curry, they said it would be a $2 charge! I feel like I was nickel-and-dimed for that, but got it anyway.

When we placed our order, we didn&#39;t specify the spicy level, but they also didn&#39;t ask. This resulted in a dinner that had Thai flavor, but was bland with the spicy level. We were dumping red pepper all over our food at home to kick it up a notch!

I will say I liked the variety of veggies they put in my curry: green beans, carrots, onions, red pepper. And they cooked the tofu well too. But the curry itself was a little watery like most Thai restaurants around here.

I have yet to find a Thai place that knocks my socks off."

Tried the fresh spring rolls, larb kai, basil chicken, and their version of drunken noodles. All were very good to excellent, especially the larb kai, which is ground chicken, salad-style, served on lettuce leaves. Would have preferred to see ground chicken used in the basil chicken entree as well, but that&#39;s a personal preference. Service was fast, the portions large, and the prices were reasonable. Overall, this place is a great addition to the local Thai food lineup."

They&#39;re friendly and cook consistently great food. This review is based on over 20 to go orders.

Standout Dishes:

Pad Khee Mao - Awesome flavor, I personally like this dish with beef and cooked extra spicy!
Red Curry Tofu - Flavorful and reheats amazingly well!
Panang Curry Noodle - This dish is best with beef and served extra spicy!
Duck Curry - Big pieces of duck with Red Curry, lots of flavor, peppers and pineapple play well in the curry.
Cashew Noodle - Recommend to get with chicken and extra spicy, while the nuts don&#39;t reheat well the flavors all work together very well. 

I&#39;m looking forward to trying more from this place and will update, so far everything has been delicious. Try them out. One last call out they&#39;re best for take out."

Thai Iced Tea - A little on the sweet side.

Shrimp Pad Thai - Generous portions! I can usually finish my plate at most other places, but these dishes can feed two. Noodles could have been cooked a bit more, but aside from that, the ingredients were fresh and the sauce was pretty good.

Massaman Curry - The sauce was the epitome of perfection. Definitely my go-to place for curry.

Space - It&#39;s a quaint, little place that has two tables inside with two chairs per table. There&#39;s also a counter with 4 bar stools. 

If you love curry, this is the place to go!"

The chicken satay was good, meat was tender not over cooked. Peanut sauce was the classic Smokey, sweet savory that you would expect.

Portion sizes were awesome. The dishes were family sized, so one dish was usually more than enough to satiate an appetite.

The service was good, and the meals came out quick, although we were there during a slow night. There was not much seating for big groups, for example a group of two or three might be pushing it.

If you are looking for mid range solid thai food this is the place to be."

****lad nar with tofu- delish. You can taste the char on the veg and tofu from the wok. Very good. 
*** red curry with chicken. Good/great not amazing. Wish there was more veg and they would have offered more rice with such a large dish. If more then 2 people (moderate eaters) tell them they should make it a large rice.

(Their location has parking in front of it, but you can also park further out on the street, which makes it easy to get in and pick food up.)

The establishment is small and has limited seating space. I wouldn&#39;t choose to go and eat in. That said, I placed an online order (they use EatStreet) and specified that I wanted food to be ready in 85 minutes. When I arrived to pick it up, it was piping hot. As far as the food goes, it was fairly portioned (serving size is ample enough to easily have one entree be shared between two people). There were six pot stickers ($4.95), which were about two bites each and the thai fresh spring rolls ($5.95) had 12? per order (one bite each). The entrees are a little pricier (by about 1-2$) than other Thai locations in the area for similar orders, but I find that Thai Cafe has a more satisfying flavor profile. 

They will acknowledge special requests (mild spice, more spice) and their average is a little spicy but not overwhelming so if you want more heat, request it and you&#39;ll get more. 

All in all, I found Thai Cafe to be pleasant. It was flavorful (the crispy pad thai &amp; the massamun curry), well portioned, and pleasantly seasoned (with the ability to make food more or less spicy). It was satisfying and price-wise, in-line with everything else in the Downtown Downers Grove area (with more ample portions)."

Scratch that. I don&#39;t want to cook ANY night. But I do. And my wife does too. But I wouldn&#39;t say either one of us will be competing for a spot on the Food Network anytime soon. 

Either way, I had to pick her up from the train station last night and decided that takeout was in order. My eating hasn&#39;t exactly been of the most healthy nature as of late, so I decided to order up some Thai. 

Keeping it simple, we went with two orders of pad thai with chicken, and some potstickers. 

The lady at the counter was super friendly and made me want to order all my meals from her. However, the portion sizes seemed a little lacking. Maybe this is a Downers Grove thing? I seem to find that portions are smaller, with heftier prices everywhere in the Grove. I just moved here from a &#39;burb about 10 minutes south, and sure they&#39;re slightly less wealthy than the folks who inhabit Downers, but the $$ doesn&#39;t exactly grow on trees here either. And a deal is a deal. So when I spotted the two microwave entree-size containers and six miniature potstickers I was a little disappointed. I&#39;m used to generous portion sizes, especially considering that the total for this meal was about $25.

The food itself? It was all right. It wasn&#39;t the best pad thai I&#39;ve had, but certainly wasn&#39;t the worst either. It had a very pungent sauce, and was extremely sticky. The potstickers were tasty, but definitely one-biters. We could&#39;ve used a second order, methinks. 

So will I try Thai Cafe again? Most likely, especially considering that they deliver. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be my first choice."

It&#39;s a carry out shop hidden in a small strip mall east of the train track in downtown Downers Grove. The food is delicious and flavorful. The portions are not considered generous. However, the business does not skimp on the ingredients. (For instance, the Pad Thai noodles are not just loaded with noodles and sauce, it is a good even fixture of 1/3 protein, 1/3 veggie and 1/3 noodles). Flavoring is also solid, nothing is overly greasy or too salty. You&#39;re a fan of Thai cuisine this place will delight you! Enjoy."

The place is TINY and clearly does mostly a carryout business; there are two tables and a bar with a few stools for eat-in, but they were doing a brisk business of take-away on Friday night. 

We did eat in, but because they&#39;re used to timing orders to go, everything in the meal came at once (i.e. entrees only seconds on the heels of the appetizers). Everything was great, though!

We tried the unusual shrimp cigars: shrimp wrapped in a wonton with a basil leaf and fried; unusual and tasty! The perfume of sweet basil permeated nearly everything that we ate, which was a good thing. 

Crab rangoon here was realized in the form of little purses, heavy on the cream cheese, with a slight bite of chive. 

My dining companion and I each kept stealing off each other&#39;s plates, meaning that we both liked everthing! He had the Pad Khee Mao wide noodles, and I had beef panang curry, both excellent interpretations of these standards. 

Service was friendly and fast, and the people getting their to-gos were treated in an efficient and timely manner as well.

I was really excited to get some great Thai food  and the 4 star reviews for this joint made me excited to try some take out. My boy and I ordered a spread of Thai tastes - noodles, soup, spring rolls, rice. 

Sadly, every dish was seriously flawed.

The spring rolls were wrapped in a thick wrapper that made you feel like you were eating a tube sock.

The tom yum was boiling hot 30 minutes after pick up (re: microwaved) and the seafood tasted like it had been freezer burned. They also fail to mention on the menu that &#34;crab&#34; means &#34;krab&#34;. That&#39;s fine - just tell me so I know what I am getting! A little expectation setting always helps ease the disappointment. The broth actually tasted OK - but not great.

I didn&#39;t eat the noodles but my guy said they were flavorless (his exact words were &#34;meh&#34; as he tossed 3/4 of it in the garbage).

The rice was fine but what is the point of rice if there is nothing tasty to eat it with!

The soup was super-hot in temperature and just the right hot in spice. This is the perfect soup when you&#39;re sick, I think, although I love it any time. The balance of spicy-sour-sweet notes with tender chicken and tasty veggies really hit the spot.

Then I dug into my woonsen pad thai. I love those glass noodles, the flavors were well-balanced, maybe a little less tofu than I would have liked, but it was a large portion and I can&#39;t complain. 

I really need more Thai food in my life, and I think Thai Cafe and I are going to be good buddies."

&#34;Dine-in&#34; really isn&#39;t too much of an option here, they do have 2 small tables and a counter with a few stools, but it&#39;s really a take-out mecca.

Instead of calling ahead, I ordered at the restaurant and just waited for my lunch to be ready.  The girl who took my order was very friendly, and seemed genuinely happy I came in that day.  Everything is made to order, which was evident by my 15 minute wait time.

I ordered the green curry lunch special with chicken.  The portion was huge, and came with a large heap of rice and two spring rolls, which I couldn&#39;t even get to after eating the curry.

The curry.  Ohmigosh, was the curry good!  Rich, deep flavors and the perfect amount of spice.  Packed with plenty of thai basil, veggies, and chicken, I couldn&#39;t finish what was given to me.

So, if everything was super great and I&#39;m raving away, why only 4 stars?  $10 minimum for credit/debit card purchases.  Boo-hiss.  I just don&#39;t carry cash on me, and don&#39;t really like to have to order more than I&#39;m going to eat in order to pay with plastic."

The owner was super friendly too. I am taking way one star since there was no seats to dine in. The owner had turned a party of four away as there was only one table with two chairs available when other two chairs were occupied. So pretty much this is a carry out place.

We ordered the Shrimp Cigar which was big hit among us. The tender shrimp wrapped with Wonton skin which was fried to being crisp and crunch. The sauce with it was perfectly made as well. The Tom Yum soup had a nice balance with the sweetness and sourness which basically woke up all my taste buds. You have to try it out.

The Red Curry with Duck had very tasty sauce. I probably had too much rice with it. The Pad Khee Mao was pretty good as well. However, the Basil with mixed vegetables didn&#39;t turned out as I expected. That was a bit dry and not spicy at all which I did ask when I ordered.

We will be back to have more curry dishes from here."

I walked in the door at 6:40 p.m. and the order was being placed in the bag.

I have now ordered various entrees from Thai Cafe and all of them have been spectacular. From curries to noodles to fried rice, all of them use fresh ingredients and they are well balanced in flavors. There are many great thai places around this area (Thai Pot, Mai Thai), but Thai Cafe provides the best value.

During one very long workday, the thought of their duck curry was what actually kept me going...much better than the coffee that I chugged. 

It&#39;s the smallest of seating areas, so I would recommend getting your food to-go, but after that, you can&#39;t go wrong."

And it&#39;s no secret that this little lady lives, breathes, and dies for good Thai food. Heck, I even have the logo of my now 2nd fave Thai spot tattooed on my body 3 separate times. So you can imagine the conundrum I&#39;m in now that I&#39;ve found my official untoppable fave with Thai Cafe, who doesn&#39;t appear to have an official logo as of yet. What&#39;s a gal to do? Well I&#39;ll tell ya what I did- stuff my pie hole with generous portions of the finest Thai food around. 

Anywhooo. I found Thai Cafe while doing my bi-weekly exodus and migration from Nordstom Oakbrook to my housing project in Naperville. Normally, I just get right on the highway and do not pass go and I certainly don&#39;t collect $200- just ask my empty -practically virgin- wallet. But on this particular day it was different. Instead of zipping home I felt oddly drawn to take the long, traffic filled, stress inducing drive through suburban America during rush hour for a scenic tour of d-town Downers Grove. Actually, I&#39;m convinced that the fine businesses of DG have somehow (fingers crossed it wasn&#39;t rectally) implanted a homing and retrieval device in my stomach because whenever I&#39;m hungry (or even when I&#39;m not hungry for that matter) I find myself in the area and eating. Today I found myself ordering up a smorgasbord of food from Thai Cafe thanks to the delightful little &#39;refresh Nearby Restaurants&#39; option on Yelp&#39;s mobile app. 5 star average + Thai Food- Looks like this is my lucky day!

Again straying away from my norm, I ordered take-out instead of sitting down to eat- mainly because it&#39;s a not a place you&#39;re really meant to sit down and eat in. And though there is one table and some seating along the wall, I think it&#39;s meant for waiting and maybe having a beverage since they only have to-go packaging. 

When you order from here (and you absolutely MUST order from here!), you should get at least one order of shrimp cigars for every person you plan on feeding. TRUST ME.  A plan to share these things is like an evil plot to start World War III... just ask my boyfriend. No, wait- don&#39;t remind him. Honestly, they&#39;re one of the most delicious things I&#39;ve ever eaten in my entire life. Next time I&#39;m getting 3 orders for myself + my meal b/c I&#39;ll be damned if I walk out of a Thai place without extra spicy basil with tofu. 

Truly, Madly, Deeply I promise you that everything I had from Thai Cafe was fantastic. The fried Tofu was perf and the crab rangoon (which I normally am not a fan of) was devilishly good. I LOVED their spicy sweet and sour sauce which has more of a vinegar-y flavor than most places that have a sweeter flavor and more of a honey consistency that I&#39;m not a fan of. My Tom Yum soup was a steal at $8 for a large... and they gave us an extra soup and free bottled water b/c we waited all of 15-20 minutes for a metric ton of food. I followed up my spicy basil with tofu with some mango and sticky rice for dessert and I recommend you do the same on your trip. 

The boss lady owner went above and beyond to make us at home while their phone line was positively blowin&#39; up with take-out orders at 8PM on a Monday evening. Not only is she beautiful, but you can tell she puts everything she&#39;s got into making every person&#39;s experience into a 5 star one from the food to the service to the (and I appreciate this from so many Thai experiences in the past that lack it) comprehensive website with menu and pricing listed. Oh, and did I mention they deliver?! I believe I&#39;m out of their delivery range but the owner did mention that they&#39;re opening another restaurant shortly a little farther South closer to my house. 

This tastes like the beginning of a beautiful relationship."

The food is excellent, of course, and reasonably priced. But it is all of the other things they do that separates them from everyone else. 

We called in an order from a downtown Downers Grove business and Thai Cafe delivered at no-charge and were absolutely delighted to do so. I stopped in last night to place an order after a long drive back from Wisconsin. They brought me a complimentary soup while I was waiting. 

I asked to use their restroom - it&#39;s not a public restroom - and had to walk through the kitchen, the place was immaculate. The bathroom was pristine as were the food prep area and where they do the dishes. I was very impressed as these are not areas open to the public and it speaks volumes about how they run their business.

This is one of those places that you find yourself really rooting for. I&#39;m glad Yelp gives me the forum to do so.

The Basil dishes are fantastic!"

The food was good but they need to address the smell. It smells like &#34;wet dog&#34; in the restaurant. The smell was so strong I almost couldn&#39;t eat my meal. They also need to offer water to customers that dine in. They try to force you to buy a bottle of water as a way to increase revenue. My suggestions to the owners: Scrub the place down and if necessary put an exhaust fan at the back of the restaurant and don&#39;t be so cheap that you don&#39;t offer customers a 1 cent glass of water with their $15 order.

The restaurant itself is really small and can only seat 7 or 8 customers at a time, but it&#39;s perfect if you&#39;re looking for take-out.  The food here has all of the traditional Thai flavors.  Trust me, I&#39;m Thai and I&#39;ve had their Pad Thai, Larb Kai, Panang Curry, Nam Sod, Lard Nar, Tom Yum, Tom Kha, Crab Rangoons, and Thai Fried Rice.  The only downside to this place is that their curries are a bit on the watery side and their portions could be a bit bigger.   Their service is courteous and timely, sometimes they do get a bit backed up due to order volume but keep in mind that this place is run by a small Thai family and they freshly prepare their food.

Called in for take out around 11:50. took me 3 attempts till somebody picked up. ordered the Pad Khee Mao. was quoted 20 mins which I thought was a long time for a primarily no-hassle take-out place. Got there around 12:10, and the place was totally empty, so I don&#39;t know why I was quoted a 20 min wait time. I was also charged the dinner price ($2 more with no spring rolls) because I didn&#39;t clarify that I want the lunch specials. I don&#39;t know about you, but I thought it&#39;s pretty obvious that I bought something on the lunch menu during lunch hours. Maybe it wasn&#39;t intentional, but it just wasn&#39;t a good first impression.

About the food: the portion was small for a $10 lunch. The lady said that the dinner portion (which I got) is double the lunch portion, so I don&#39;t even want to think about the size of the lunch portion. My Pad Khee Mao was pretty good, but not great.

If you&#39;re craving cheap Thai food, give this place a gander. If you want a much more refined Thai experience, try Baisi Thai in Oakbrook Center. It&#39;s slightly more expensive but it&#39;s a much more well-rounded eatery and the food&#39;s quality takes a noticeable upwards shift."

A makeshift paper sign taped to the window for the restaurant.

Threadbare seating.

A &#34;just-got-started&#34; look.

Positively RIDICULOUS Thai food.

Do -not- let the piecemeal appearance of this place fool you. This guy knows what he&#39;s doing. Went in on a Saturday afternoon awhile back and I, along with two of my friends, were met by a kindly older gentleman at the counter who took our orders. It left me with the impression of one of those (stereotyped) quiet Asian restaurants where the grand master cook comes out to meet you and is this totally unassuming person on the outside, but a freaking -wizard- in the kitchen. 

We honestly had our doubts when we walked in the place and it looked like they had literally just unpacked their equipment into the restaurant - but it became refreshingly clear once the food was served that the stereotype above was more the -reality-. And I have to say that that&#39;s one stereotype that benefits everyone involved!

The place is designed more for take-out than it is for dine-in, so there&#39;s only a few seats in the place, and everything is served in take-out containers with styrofoam plates. Despite the cut-rate tableware, the food will freaking BLOW YOUR MIND.

I ordered my old standby, pad cashew, chicken, medium. I&#39;ve learned that at a Thai place, order it medium to start - because while you can always turn the heat up later, you can never turn it down, and one place&#39;s &#34;medium&#34; might be another place&#39;s &#34;nuclear&#34;. 

That said, their definition of medium is just shy of what I would personally consider medium - about a 2.5 on a scale of 1-5, which is, incidentally, how you tell them how hot you want the dish. My friend got their Szechuan chicken at a 4, which was nice and solidly spicy as well. I ended up asking for an extra shot of spice in mine, turning what was once a 2.5 into a solid 4-plus for me. 

Flavors were much lighter than at other Thai places I&#39;ve had, although the brown sauce used in the pad cashew was still quite savory. The red and green bell peppers really brightened up the flavor of the dish, and the chicken was tender and not at all stringy.

What can I say? It knocked my socks off. And, as it turns out, the place actually -is- brand new - they had apparently only opened a few months before I walked in the door."

Yelp gave this place great reviews so I figured I would give it a shot. I live within walking distance of this place but did not even know it was here. Don&#39;t let the paper signs in the window scare you off - they are just starting off.  We ordered four dishes, three I thought were excellent.

Crab Rangoon had light pastry-like wanton dough and not over cooked (nor as greasy) as is almost always the case with this dish. Filling was creamy and tasty. The shrimp cigars that someone else recommended were also excellent - this is not just battered or tempura shrimp.

Sesame chicken was also lightly breaded and cooked to a golden brown - again not over fried as is common. Carrots were but retained their crispiness - no soggy veggies here.  We got the crab fried rice mainly because I misread the menu. The crab was hard finely ground instead of  in junks. I&#39;ll try the house Thai Rice next time. For Asian rice dishes, we tend to really partial to Jockey Rice from Jockey in Westmont - we found none better and tend to be hard on most other rice dishes.

Now for the important part: what we ordered! My wife ordered the Pad-Thai noodles, and Crab rangoons, both of which she said were excellent. I personally RECOMMEND the Mongolian beef, which consists of well-marinated and perfectly cooked beef mixed with a variety of bell-peppers, onions, and carrots.

The dishes they offer are typical Thai dishes you expect from Thai restaurant in the suburb. 

But I give 5 stars for the food , above average of Thai restaurants around Chicago suburb I have tried. I ordered 4 dishes today and they are all very good and price is very reasonable. (Obviously I am not comparing Thai restaurants around Chicago suburb to the ones around Lincoln Square area .. those are exceptional)

The special ones I like are Trio Tilapia. And Pad Thai is surprisingly decent. It has lots of peanuts, and great taste of fried shallots. I order most items in 4 stars spiciness (scale from 1 to 5) could go for 5 stars next time.  

Now I am happy to have a place for Thai food for lunch during work days.  They said they also deliver, but it would probably be much quicker to get a take out than delivery because they use the same delivering crew as the pizza place next door - could be very busy.

Forgot to mention that I am Thai :)"

I ordered the duck curry ($12.95) for delivery about an hour before close and was quoted 30 minutes for delivery. They showed up in 20. There was an unmentioned $3 tip/delivery fee on the bill which I did see until after I signed for the food. The curry itself was delicious. Lots of duck, lots of veggies, the perfect amount of spicy. When asked if I wanted it spicy I said the spicier the better which Thai restaurants usually take as a challenge. They made it decently spicy and included a little container of some siracha style sauce. Will be ordering again."

I decided not to do the $7.95 lunch special, and went with one of my favorite Thai dishes, Pad Khee Mao. Everything was delicious. Some may argue that the vegetables were a tad undercooked, but I love the crispness. Well done. 

The spring rolls (called egg rolls on the menu) were very good. The sauce served with them was not entirely to my liking, but I thought the dish was excellent. 

I got carry out and sat at one of the 5 bar stools in the window. While I waited, the server surprised me with a complimentary cup of the noodle soup. This soup, and this restaurant, have found a home on my favorites list very quickly. 

One word of warning, hot means HOT! at the Thai Cafe. I love spicy and I asked for the Pad Khee Mao spicy. It did not disappoint, but I feel like casual &#34;spicy&#34; people would be overwhelmed by this. I recommend working up to spicy if you are on the fence. 

Overall, a wonderful addition to the downtown DG restaurant scene."

It was pretty bland and I had to spice it up with chili sauce. Unfortunately the only gave me about half of a small container of the sauce, plus about half of a container of rice. The pot stickers had a little more flavor, but that sauce was weirdly spicy. Everything about the experience seemed off. Definitely NOT going back."

However they do have seating at a counter that either faces the wall or the window overlooking the parking lot. 

We had the fried tofu for an appetizer and it was pretty good. I would have liked for it to have been a little more on the crispy side, but the tofu was firm and the sauce was nice and spicy. When I try a thai restaurant for the first time I like to order the pad thai because you pretty much can&#39;t mess that up.

The digs were much too look at so we didn&#39;t expect too much. From the look of the outside we thought the food would be typical at best.

Boy were we wrong! Thai food is one of my favorite types of cuisine so i considered myself to be well versed in classics like Tom Kha soup and yellow curry.

Of all the thai i&#39;ve tried around the world (mainly Europe and the US) this is the BEST thai i&#39;ve ever had. 

Sam the owner is VERY friendly and warm.

We sat by the window (there are a few little stools for dining in if you so prefer) and couldn&#39;t stop talking about how good the food is. The place is very clean and the portions are big enough to split among two people. 

We&#39;ve now gone back 3 times in 2 weeks and Sam recognizes us by face everytime.

It is rather pricey and you don&#39;t get the biggest of portions BUT you get what you pay for you can tell she uses really fresh vegetables and good cuts of meat and seafood.

I always get the Pad Thai with shrimp. It tastes different than other Pad Thai&#39;s Ive had but pretty good! Also all of the currry&#39;s with chicken are yummy!!

Not a big fan of the deserts or appetizers though they are just too overpriced and not that good. 

They used to have delivery but I think they lost their driver, hopefully they got a new one. The people who work there are super nice and REALLY appreciate your business.

I am in town for the weekend on business.  I like to find the little &#34;hole in the wall&#34; mom and pop places.  I found the reviews on here and thought it would be the perfect quick lunch. 

First off, I had planned to eat at the small counter by the window, however it just didn&#39;t seem clean to me and I decided to take my meal out to a small park down the street. 

The service was great.  Very friendly and energetic.  The gentleman who waited on me made me feel more comfortable about ordering even though the atmosphere made me leery.  There were a lot of piles of papers and &#34;stuff&#34; next to the counter including a container of food.  

The chicken satay I ordered had okay flavor, but it was WAY over-cooked and the cucumber salad that came with it only had cucumbers in it (not what was described in the menu).  Although the salad was also okay in flavor, there was only about 3 bites in the container.  

I would not come back here, nor would I recommend it to others.  Sorry, but I think the &#34;run-down&#34; atmosphere, small portion and the &#34;just okay&#34; flavors made this one a negative experience for me."

Pad Thai is soupy sweet (vs. stick-to-the-noddle umami that&#39;s manifest in good pad thai), Larb Kai was good although the celery was a strange add, and the Pad Cashew followed in the Pad Thai&#39;s footsteps in being overly sweet and lacking complexity of flavor. If you like Americanized (e.g., sugary saucy) Thai food you will probably like this place. If you are looking for something more authentic along the lines of what a Thai person would actually eat, you will not be a fan. Better nearby options are Mai Thai in Westmont and Thai O&#39;Cha on Plainfield Rd.

I wanted something close to home. So of course I turn to yelp and that is how I found this little gem. 
I love the name, I was raised on the Northside of Chicago and I was rooting for my Northside team. I figured, if I can&#39;t go to the Northside to catch the game then I can be at a bar called the North Side, lol. 
I walked in and immediately loved the place. High ceilings, exposed brick, there is plenty of seating at the bar and there are high top tables and regular tables, plenty of tvs and they also have a patio out back. 
My boyfriend arrived first and he saved me a seat at the bar. The bar was quite full because of the World Series and the Blackhawks were on. I did not mind that I was able to watch both games. It was actually very nice. 
I was starving so it was nice to see that the menu has so many options. The special of the new guy was pizza so we ordered a pizza. The pizza was very good, fresh mushrooms, onions and pepperoni and the crust and sauce were just right. 
We sat there for a while so later on in the night I indulged and ordered a six piece wings. The couple seated next to us had ordered them and they looked and smelled fantastic! So I ordered the bone in garlic parmesan wings, OMG!!! I&#39;m not a fan of wings but these were fantastic!!! 
I had a great meal, great atmosphere, the bartender, Mike, was very attentive, and I got to enjoy the game. 
I really liked this place, I will be going back soon. This is a great place to go catch a game. They are a Blackhawks bar so if you&#39;re a fan check them out."

From the outside this place doesn&#39;t seem like much but once you step inside you see that there is some room to move around and that it&#39;d be a solid place to catch a game. There are a bunch of tables (both regular and high tops) and a good-sized bar if you&#39;d prefer. The place is well-lit, clean, and pretty inviting - also, the TVs didn&#39;t seem to be too loud by any means.

Our waitress was nice but left a little to be desired when it came to level of service... while she arrived quickly after we sat down she wasn&#39;t too present from there on out. In fact, several times she&#39;d roll past our table with not so much as a peek to see if we needed more water (or anything...). She did seem to be preoccupied with a large party that came in, but we were literally in her path to the bar and kitchen. Anyway, it wasn&#39;t a huge deal in the end.

We kept it pretty simple (both battling hangovers) and went with the Nachos (they came out piled HIGH with all the fixings and were very tasty) and the Chicken Wings (I went with 20 and two flavors: Cajun Dry Rub and Hot Buffalo, the dry rub was almost OVERLOADED and the buffalo wasn&#39;t too spicy and didn&#39;t seem to be very thick either). The wings were really good sized, and meaty, and came out hot and tasted fresh.

We left not paying too much and with full stomachs so we certainly cannot complain. In fact, I&#39;d return again to try a few different flavors of wings, and other items on their rather extensive menu."

The bf comes here for lunch on occasion and said that their food is really good, particularly the burgers. And well, he sure as hell wouldn&#39;t steer me wrong. So I took advantage of my winter hours this week (leaving at 1 p.m. on Fridays), met up with the bf at his work, and we made our way over here. 

We chose a seat at the back, near the kitchen and restrooms (and far away from the door, wind, and cold). There were two patrons at the bar, and then us. That&#39;s it. Kind of nice, perfect for lunch for the two of us. 

The inside is well decorated with various sports memorabilia and decals on the west wall of the Chicago sports teams (yet somehow I ended up seated next to/beneath the damn Cubs logo. Ack!). They even have a hockey goal light. They have daily specials including 1/2 price burgers all day on Tuesdays, an AYCE fish fry on Friday nights for $9.99, and 50 cent wings on Sundays. Plus there&#39;s drink specials of course. 

Michelle came over and took our drink order. I opted for a water and a sweet iced tea for the bf. She told us that she&#39;d get our drinks while we had some time to look at the menus. They had quite a few tasty choices and so it was difficult for both of us to make up our minds. 
Finally I decided on the Chicken Cajun Pasta, which is sauteed chicken in a cajun cream sauce, with grilled onions, green and red bell pepers and mushrooms. I of course requested no mushrooms. 
The bf decided to try the Buffalo Mac &amp; Cheese, which (as the name suggests) is a creamy buffalo cheese sauce over cavatappi pasta. For $3 more, he chose the blue cheese crusted fried chicken. Are your mouths watering yet? Ours sure were.

Our food arrived, and right away we noticed the portions were huge. The first bite was nothing short of heavenly. Seriously guys, this is NOT your typical bar food. My pasta tasted better than stuff I&#39;ve gotten at Carrabba&#39;s and almost as good as Luigi&#39;s House. Both of us wolfed our meals down as though they were our last. 

Of course, when you eat a carb heavy meal that fast, you approach THE WALL much more quickly than anticipated. I saw it coming, and reluctantly stopped halfway through the gigantic mountain of chicken and cavatappi. The bf ate a bit more than half but he too then realized he needed to stop ASAP or he&#39;d be napping back at work. We had our leftovers boxed up, paid the bill and headed back to his work. 

I&#39;ve gotta hand it to my awesome other half; I definitely loved their food. The prices are a bit on the high side but you have to figure 1- it&#39;s downtown Glen Ellyn and 2- it&#39;s not, I repeat NOT, your typical bar food. If it was closer, I&#39;d definitely like to catch a sports game here. Nonetheless, I will return!"

The Blackhawks were also playing that night so the bar area itself was a little crowded with Hawks fans. There were plenty of tvs with different games on so we found one that had the Iowa State game on and found a great table.

The first time I was here, the bar was fairly empty for a Saturday night. You&#39;d think that this meant great service. Wrong. So very, very wrong. I don&#39;t know what our waitress was doing, but it took forever to get anything we asked for. We&#39;d order a drink, ten minutes later we&#39;d finally get it. My friends ordered a side of mayo for their fries, and I kid you not, it took at least 20 minutes for her to bring them a little cup of mayo. Even that, they had to ask for it again and she acted like she heard it for the first time (there were two waitresses on the floor, so it wasn&#39;t due to a lack of staff). My friend went back a separate time and had the same waitress with the same slow service, so it could very well just be her.

Their burgers and price point are their saving grace. The fact that you can get a burger with FIVE toppings included (of your choice and the list is extensive) plus fries for $8.99 (half price on Wednesdays) is awesome. The burger is delicious and I would definitely recommend their waffle fries. None of this stuff where you pay one price for the burger and 79 cents per every ingredient after that. Their beer list isn&#39;t super extensive, but they still have a nice selection. Also fairly priced, always served nice and cold. They have drink specials every night, and food specials everyday except Tuesday and Thursday (1/2 priced burgers, $10 fajitas, etc), as well as a variety of foods to choose from if you&#39;re not feeling typical bar food.

The second time I went back was on a Blackhawks game night. I called them about 45 minutes before I planned to get there, gave them my name, and when we walked in, there was a card on a table reserved for us. So that&#39;s a definite plus and I&#39;d recommend doing that to ensure yourself a table. The service was excellent, considering how busy it was (the-day-before-thanksgiving-everyone-home-from-college-wall-to-wall people kind of busy). We ordered and within a reasonable time frame, we had our drinks and food (I think maybe at most we waited 10 minutes for something and if we waited longer than that, our waitress actually seemed sorry). She was definitely on top of her game.

During games, they have more than enough TVs to watch it on, so you never miss any action, and they play the goal horn and song when the Hawks score. Excellent atmosphere! I&#39;ve even heard that there&#39;s a patio you can sit on (it was a little cold both times I went).

Overall, I&#39;d recommend this place. I already have plans to go back. (;"

But wait!  There&#39;s more!  They have indoor and outdoor seating!  There&#39;s a decent beer menu with $3 featured craft beer cans on Wednesdays (and other specials that don&#39;t involve craft beer too)!  A Build-Your-Own-Burger with awesome choices (there&#39;s fresh AND pickled jalepenos, grilled AND fried onions, bleu AND pepper jack cheeses [and more that I don&#39;t care about], eggs, bacon, etc.)!  And a whole menu full of delicious bar-food-with-a-twist!

Obviously, I am a new found fan of North Side.  Apparently, it&#39;s the sister bar of Tap House Grill down the street, but it is much less kid-friendly (thank God), much smaller (get there early if there&#39;s a game on!), and has a decent menu to rival its original (see also:  PEANUT BUTTER BURGERS).

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the Italian in us, but my friend and I already have visions of coming here weekly for the next few months just to try all the things that we couldn&#39;t have on our first visit.  What?  Beer and food make us happy.

See you next week, North Side!"

(Here&#39;s the funny thing ... same guy owns Tap House Grill about three blocks away. I was slightly disappointed by Tap House but pretty impressed with North Side.)

This is a long, not-too-wide space with brick walls, high-tops and tables, and giant sports logos on the wall. Lots of TVs and a long bar round things out. There&#39;s also a patio out back, though we did not visit it.

The menu is not too big (that&#39;s a good thing) and with a nice variety -- build-your-own burgers, apps, wings, sandwiches and the like. Prices are also pretty reasonable.

At our table, we shared nachos, I ordered a shrimp po&#39;boy with fries, the husband had a &#34;Ryne Sandburger&#34; and our friend had the Friday night fish fry deal (wedge salad, fish, choice of potato and hush puppies, plus refills on the fish).

The nachos were very good although the chili was somewhat unevenly distributed, leaving the top chips a little dry and the bottom ones soaked. Tasty, though. 

I was pretty impressed with my shrimp po&#39;boy. The bread was awesome, the shrimp were cooked just right and the chipotle mayo had just a little kick. The fries were also very good, fresh-cut and cooked well.

My husband&#39;s burger looked tasty (and he devoured it), and our friend managed to eat all of his food plus another order of fish. 

Service was good although a touch flaky; the food was definitely impressive. The beer list looked decent, not spectacular, and they did have a few specialty cocktails that sounded promising.

While this isn&#39;t as close as some sports bars to us, I have a feeling we&#39;ll be back -- I could definitely go for another po&#39;boy."

I never really thought about Chicago in terms of &#34;sides&#34; growing up, but I went to a college in Indiana loaded with rich kids from the North Side (and suburbs) who had nothing but terrible things to say about the part of Chicagoland in which I was born and raised. In time, I came to be defensive of the neighborhoods I loved and before I knew it was firmly entrenched in the South vs. North battle.

Now, I&#39;m firmly Sox over Cubs, Hyde Park over Lincoln Park, Orland over Evanston. If it&#39;s south of Madison St., I will praise its virtues.

So you have to imagine I have a little bit of trouble with a place that wears its North Side centrism proudly in its name. Do I really want to eat at place that goes on and on about a team that hasn&#39;t won anything important in over 100 years?

Yes, yes I do.

To start, I really like the atmosphere of this place. I&#39;m always a fan of sports bars, but it seems like most either are too heavily family restaurants or too heavily bars (and I hate going to the ones that seem to want to drink more than eat, for dinner). North Side seems to hit the middle ground pretty nicely.

As for the food, it was pretty good. The nachos (yes, I have to sample them everywhere) were really well done, although the toppings could have been distributed a little better to keep the bottom ones from getting so soggy. The burger was phenomenal. For 7.99 you can add 5 toppings to your delicious juicy burger, which is just a deal that can&#39;t be beat. Plus it&#39;s on a pretzel roll, which would make even a mediocre burger taste a lot better. 

The service was hit or miss. I definitely felt like we had been forgotten at points, but when things needed to get done, they got done.

Overall, definitely a place to go back to, especially when we&#39;re already in the downtown Glen Ellyn area.

So yeah, it may be somewhat of a shrine to a side of the city I&#39;m less than thrilled with, but just like the area it&#39;s named after, there&#39;s still some good to be found."

With these, we were given the option of four entrees including steak, two seafood dishes and a vegetarian stuffed pepper dish.

Not in the mood for meat, I opted for the stuffed pepper and I was not disappointed. The dish is two char-grilled red pepper halves stuffed with portabella mushrooms, roasted corn, other veggies, goat cheese and balsamic. The dish was well-balanced with sweetness from the corn, creamy goat cheese and sharp balsamic. 

To complement the main, the peppers were served on top of a red pepper risotto cooked perfectly.

For dessert, I had an Amaretti cake that was rich without being heavy."

Cute cozy and the owner was there to welcome us, he told us he was giving us his best server SAM and he was correct, she was great. My husband had me google the best place to get a steak, that&#39;s all he wanted was a steak. We ordered and when Sam brought them she asked us each to cut into them and make sure it was ok everyone&#39;s was perfect except my husbands and he asked for it to be cooked a little more. She took it to the cook  and he he made a very loud comment &#34;Are you kidding me &#34; awkward because we were at the table right in front. By the time we got it back my husband was so uncomfortable he did not eat.
Sam took the steak off our menu but the owner never approached our table. When we left the cook gave us a very uncomfortable watch out the door!
Really a shame but when I go out to eat I want to feet comfortable.
Sorry I cannot recommend this place"

The burger is a good quality generous half pound restaurant burger; however, it is not in the category of a gourmet burger such as what is available, at Kuma&#39;s, Burger Local, or the DMK Burger Bar. They do nickel and dime you for the toppings, but it is still a good deal and if you like a plain burger then it is even a better value. I was surprised someone was so impressed with the French Onion soup. It is good but certainly not class leading. Even though it is a little dark, the modern trendy décor is appreciated."

It delivers every time and is really well run. Every single time I have been there a manager or who i assume to be the owner will come up to our table and ask us how our evening was. It has a very cool vibe inside as well with exposed brick and a visible kitchen. Something you really don&#39;t see in other restaurants. Great wrap around bar too if you need to wait for a table.

Two favorite appetizers are the Asian Calamari and the baked goat cheese. The calamari has a really great sweet and sour sauce on it which really makes it different from calamari you would get at another restaurant. 

My three favorite entrees on there menu would have to be the Napa Valley Chicken which comes with a great white wine creme sauce.  The Scallops are some of the best ive had with a great roasted red pepper risotto. Also you can never go wrong with a steak either here which can have special toppings added. 

Cant go wrong with a burger or salad either. 

Overall great place to go for a casual dinner or for a bottle of wine and a great meal."

The owners have always been so professional and nice, the steaks have been great and, as someone with Celiac, there are few places to eat in the area. Unfortunately, we just literally can not go back until things change.

Foxfire has always been one of the most expensive restaurants in the area. Just recently, however, they changed their menu, adding options and making once included side items a la carte. The potato that used to come with a $49 steak order is now $6-$8 extra.

I opted to get a risotto I&#39;ve had many times before, but something is definitely different around there. This risotto came out lukewarm and completely lacking flavor with cold, plain cocktail shrimp on top of it. It was uneatable, just gross.

As a long-time and loyal customer, I wrote the owners trying to have an honest dialogue about the changes. I received no response. Just disappointing."

The big paw on the fox clock is pointing at &#34;NO&#34;.

OK - to be absolutely fair - ordering a half rack of ribs at an upscale eatery in an upscale area might seem incorrect.  But I LIKE ribs.  I was in the MOOD for ribs.  And...if they cook even halfway decently...they should be able able to serve an upscale plate at their decidedly upscale prices regardless of what the customer orders.  

The ribs were, in a word; awful.  

Not a hint of smoke, lukewarm, and - quite frankly - seemed like they had done a few laps around the block.  The sauce was sweet and thick, and did nothing to hide the awfulness of the meat underneath.  I have had FAR better at franchise restaurants for far less money.  Even the rolls served with the meal tasted suspiciously like the the ones your mom used to buy in a supermarket 12-pack and heat in the oven just before serving Sunday dinner.

At these prices, there are far better choices in the area.

What does the fox say?

Once we were sat someone came over and cleared the extra plates, silverware and glasses and another person came and filled our water glasses. Our server Miguel greeted us within 5 minutes of being sat down, took our drink orders and once he came back we were ready to order. I had a couple questions about the menu which he was able to answer no problem! Now for the order, I had the ribeye with parmesan crust and chose to add on their garden salad, my boyfriend got their napa chicken dish and added on their 1/2 mozzarella salad. We got a side of grilled asparagus and au gratin potatoes to share. The garden salad was OK exactly what youd expect and my boyfriend absolutely loved their mozzarella salad(caprese). Ribeye was cooked to perfection and the chicken dish was wonderful and had an out of this world white wine cream sauce! The au gratin potatoes were the best I have ever had...sorry grandma! During our meal three gentleman stopped by our booth to check on us and see how we were enjoying everything, one was our server and I believe one of the other gentleman was the owner and the other their head chef! It feels wonderful when you are approached and asked how your evening is going, if youre loving the food, and I particularly like that Miguel asked us what brought us out tonight and trying to get a hint if we were celebrating anything special. On our way out we were very warmly wished a good night by several staff and I almost forgot my to-go(how could I!?) and the man who I believe is their head chef noticed and saved me from leaving behind a wonderful piece of meat I planned to heat up and devour later on! This place has a great atmosphere with live music and is simply decorated as the restaurant is beautiful by itself with exposed brick walls a cathedral style ceiling with wooden beams. I would go back in a heartbeat, I truly have no complaints about this place!"

I&#39;ve been going here for about 8 years and have always had a tasty meal. I took my girlfriend there tonight and was shocked to see that they significantly changed their menu and more importantly, made it so that all sides and salads are ala carte. I&#39;ve always felt that Foxfire got penalized (on Yelp) for having slightly higher prices than similar places in the area. I gave them the 5 star review 4 months ago because I wanted to acknowledge that while their prices are a bit higher, they&#39;re food is always on point. Well, after seeing that they removed many of our favorite meals from their menu, they are now charging six dollars for a side and eight dollars for a dinner salad. I ordered a filet ($33) and my girlfriend ordered a new chicken dish (25ish dollars and the only chicken meal on the menu now). We both had one glass of wine and we split a side. That&#39;s it. The bill was about a hundred dollars before tip. Our waitress was fine (staff has always been good) but the cost to get a full meal there is just too much for the area. I will say that the steak was good, they upgraded the quality of their steaks without charging more (which is good considering you were already paying 33 dollars for a 6oz filet). Overall, I was bummed out the whole time I was there, knowing that would be my last time going there after many years of enjoying their food. I&#39;m not sure if they weren&#39;t doing well financially, but this was a very bad move. It was pretty empty for a Saturday night, so in guessing I&#39;m not the only one that feels this way."

Sat for about 10 minutes before a server came by and then it took a while for our drinks to come - martini and beer.   I ordered the french onion soup - it was good, but it could have been hotter, i have a feeling the waiter didn&#39;t pick it up right away.  It wasn&#39;t that busy, so I&#39;m not sure why service was so slow.  I ordered a beef tenderloin special - each 3 oz piece had a different crust, one blue cheese, one peppercorn, one horseradish - they were all very tasty, good piece of meat however my steaks were cooked to medium when I ordered them cooked to medium rare.  my husband had the steak salad - the salad was fine, but don&#39;t expect much steak, they were puny skewers that, because they were so small, were also over cooked.   

bread basket was delicious and hot.  overall, wasn&#39;t the perfect dining experience, but a good value / price for quality.  will definitely go back and try again!"

I love Foxfire but I was a little disappointed with this visit.  My entree was scallops with red pepper risotto. I have had this entree twice before, and I think my luck ran out with #3.  The scallops were inconsistent, half of them were tender and terrific, the others were chewy, almost like calamari.  They do serve a large portion, so I was fine with leaving a couple on the plate.   The risotto was, as usual, unbelievably good.  Could be the best side I have ever had, anywhere.  So what was the problem?   The portion size was about half what it should have been for this entree.  The scallops are arranged around the risotto and the presentation was pretty bad.  I&#39;m surprised they served it at all, perhaps they ran out?   Fortunately, my daughter have the same side with her entree and couldn&#39;t eat half of the portion served to her, so I ended up with a decent amount.  Must mention that my wife and kids enjoyed their meals, and my son and I each had a bowl of their marvelous French onion soup, just exceptional.

I went here for my boyfriend&#39;s 21st birthday with some friends. We went on a day when there was a burger deal so we could avoid their ridiculous prices. 

First off, it took about 20-30 minutes to get our drinks. The server had no empathy, thought was doing a great job. She was terrible. After we finally got our drinks, she left for another 20-30 minutes. This was the patten for the entire evening. The server never once apologized for her terrible service. 

The food was mediocre at best. Everyone got burgers. Nothing to write home about. 

We eventually gave up on ordering drinks because that was too complicated of a task for the server. We ate quickly so we could get out of there but of course when we wanted to pay, the server was no where to be found. When we finally got the checks, she charged us incorrectly so we had to wait for her to grace us with her presence once again.

From the dinner rolls upon arrival to the filet mignon to the ahi tuna (and I don&#39;t usually enjoy seafood of any kind) to the Fox Fire Ale on tap (some of the most refreshing local brew I&#39;ve had) to the star of the show -- the Angus Burger -- Fox Fire&#39;s entrees never disappoint. The dessert menu is rather small and I have been underwhelmed more than wowed; but, for your own sake, if you have ever thought you remotely enjoyed a cheeseburger, then you owe it to yourself to grab an Angus Burger. If you&#39;re on a budget, book a reservation on Monday night when the $10 burger goes to $5. There is ZERO dip in quality, I assure you. You can thank me later.

P.S. Their buss staff is one of the most efficient and friendly that I have ever witnessed. The owner/proprietor always makes a point of being on the floor and engages us before we pay or exit each and every time we dine here. More businesses could stand to take a lesson from this man, his gregariousness, and his overall business acumen.

Waitress was friendly, on the ball and kept us moving at whatever pace we wanted to dictate.  We dawdled through drinks and apps and then sipped some wine and then kicked into gear when it was time to wrap it up.  She had no problems shifting gears right along with us and I truly appreciate that.

I had a shrimp de jonghe app that might have been the best I&#39;ve ever had.  The shrimp were of good size, and the whole thing was done perfectly with not too much garlic and what I think was parmesan or pecorino cheese, which is a nice touch.  I&#39;ve been back since for drinks/happy hour just to hammer down one of these delectable treats.  If it was a larger portion on the dinner menu I&#39;d order it.  (consider that a submission to your suggestion box, Foxfire)

My other point of interest was the wine.  The wine list is decent for a semi-casual place.  You can find a decent bottle here.  Thing is, we&#39;re kind of winos, so when we blow the roof off for a birthday or something we like amazing 93+ point wines that are sitting in their prime drinking window.  In fact those special occasions are why we buy the really good stuff in the first place and stick it in the cellar for &#39;someday&#39;.  Not having that option takes something away from special occasion dinners for us to the point where we have at times decided to cook at home with a top tier bottle(s) rather than go out.  Foxfire does not go that far with their wine list, and I imagine there just isn&#39;t enough demand to justify stocking all of that expensive grape, BUT their corkage fee is nominal, like 15 bucks or something, so next time we&#39;ll cart our own in and have the best of both worlds.  This really is a nice amenity.  15 bucks to pop and pour a reallly nice bottle out at a restaurant while they do the rest of the cooking?  That&#39;s an attractant for us right there.

Why 4 instead of 5?  Well, it is maybe a bit overcasual for the price point, with the dining area directly adjacent to the bar, so I found myself kind of on the fence about that aspect, but the food was really good, as was the service, and we liked it well enough that we&#39;ll be going back."

1) Our meal was superb!  I had the FoxFire Filet Medallions; the unique berry sauce was delicious, filet was cooked nicely, flavor was spot on.  Husband ordered prime rib and it was one of the best I&#39;ve tasted.  So tender and deliciously seasoned.  
2) I appreciate that the meal comes with bread and soup or salad and a side.  The bread was warm and amazingly soft.  So yummy! And filling!  Finally, a nice restaurant where not everything is ala carte.
3) The building is unique and beautiful.
4) The gentleman, who I assume is the manager, walked around and checked on all the tables to be sure everything was going well.  He stopped by ours twice in the time we were there.  
5) The wait staff was on their game; we never had to ask for a refill.

The only semi-downside was that we were seated in an obvious less than desirable table.  By the kitchen and by a side &#34;filling&#34; station.  We did make reservations but it was our first visit.  Having worked in a nice restaurant before, I assume if you&#39;re frequent customers, the better your table.  
Our waitress, while she started off friendly, became much less engaged and chipper when we opted not to order drinks or appetizers.  After having the meal, I know FOR SURE we could not have finished our meals if we had an appetizer on top of it since the entrees are solid portions as mentioned above."

I had requested a  &#34;nice&#34; table and despite its nearness to the fireplace, which provided no warmth to us, it also was near the back door which opened frequently and blasted us with cold air.

However, the rolls were some of the best I have ever had, and everyone proclaimed their entrée to be absolutely delicious.  That included salmon, prime rib, filet, and tilapia.  Dessert was tasty, too: white chocolate raspberry cheesecake.

It was on the loud side and very difficult to hear the person across the table from you.  They have a party room and that was in use and even with the doors closed we did hear  &#34;Happy Birthday&#34;  LOUD AND CLEAR.

The bar is in the front and on the left as you enter and the hostess stand is in the middle of the restaurant, just a little heads up.  The kitchen is next to the bar which means the tables are along one side of the wall.  That continues to the back, but there are a few tables on the other wall in the back and a couple of tables along the passageway to the back door.

Server was friendly and attentive but water refills needed to be requested."

Enough food for three and wonderfully spiced. 
My only two complAints were about the dessert of creme brulee wHich was very bland and cold and watching the manager (owner? ) rub the shoulders of a staff member.  It&#39;s completely open - no pRivate wait stations- and when i happened to look over and see the 60 something year old manager rubbing the shoulders of a 20 something server -- it&#39;s the definition of harassment.

This was our first visit and we happened on your restaurant by chance.  My husband and I were out for a beautiful convertible weather drive and he was looking for a new dinner location on &#34;Open Table&#34; and your location had great reviews so we thought we&#39;d try.  The restaurant impressed us as we walked in with the set up and decor, your host was so friendly and pleasant.....service was so welcoming and attentive....the gentleman bringing the water even asked if we were enjoying our meal....great staff!  I am assuming the gentleman that came around to the table to ask if we like our meal was the owner?  He was such a nice and friendly man we appreciated him checking in on us.

I had Prime Rib and it was perfect.....my husband loved his Steak Salad....we had &#34;Lunatic&#34;  wine and it&#39;s a new favorite now!  Thank you for all of the hard work....it sure pays off.

Good-sized portions.  But WAY overpriced given the quality of the food.  Crab cake appetizer was good, but very salty.  Ordered the &#34;house specialty&#34; pork chop meal - my first bite of pork chop nearly burnt my tongue.  It was so hot and overcooked, and only continued to get worse as it cooked itself even more on my plate. Asparagus was overcooked and mushy, too.  I rarely complain, but when a manager came over to check on us, i had to mention the rock-hard pork chop.  He apologized and said the grill was probably &#34;too hot.&#34;  What?  10 minutes or more later, another full meal arrived.  This one was now rare to medium-rare (the original request was medium).  Asparagus was done properly on the second attempt.

Meanwhile, my daughter&#39;s child meal of potatoes and mac/cheese was okay.  Maybe it&#39;s best to order from the kid&#39;s menu here."

Our server brought everyone&#39;s soup but mine and when I reminded her about it she brought the wrong soup...ugh! I then asked our table of eight if I had failed to mention it when ordering or she forgot. They confirmed, she forgot. Maybe she should try writing down the orders the next time she has a large table.

Then i received my entree (Salmon) and it was the smallest piece of fish I&#39;d ever seen. Way overcooked and downright awful tasting. Luckily I had some snacks back at my hotel room.

I went here on a date with my wife recently. The decor, ambience and atmosphere were wonderful! Really a spectacular interior and very cool, exposed, trendy kitchen. We were dressed up, ready to fork over $100+ for two, so my expectations were high. The waiter was decent but definitely could have checked on us more often. I still tipped him well. He was friendly and helpful when he did show up. We ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer. They were not that great. Not bad, but NOTHING to write home about. I&#39;ve had better crab cakes at very casual seafood joints. My wife got shrimp scampi and she said it was good and I got the FoxFire medallions w/ Garlic Mashed Potatoes. The mashed potatoes = same story as the crab cakes. Not that great. Not bad. Not good. Was expecting much, much better though. The steak... was AMAZING. Cooked perfectly medium-rare. Absolutely spectacular steak. The demi-glaze, bleu cheese and cranberry style was unique, original and perfectly executed. Besides the lackluster sides and apps, this place is DEFINITELY the go-to steak spot in the Geneva area, no question about that. I will be back! GET THE MEDALLIONS!"

We have come before and really enjoyed the food, however tonight was really quite bad. Our waitress, I believe her name was Sam, was erratic, inconsistent and seemed completely unfocused on her job. She also whined and complained loudly about everyone and everything right in front of the whole restaurant. While eating all we could hear was her complaining about how she has been scheduled and that people there still view her as a rookie. In her own words she said she would rather they just fire her if they will always treat her like a rookie. Now her complaints might be totally valid-I don&#39;t know. But I certainly didn&#39;t need to hear her talking about them to her coworkers for my whole meal. 

My soup was amazing, as always. There is no better French onion soup around! My boyfriend also enjoyed his soup of the day. His steak was excellent. 

However, my dish, the frutti di mare was really just awful. It&#39;s a fairly basic dish and this place is steak and seafood so I don&#39;t understand how it could be so badly done. The sauce was flavorless and acidic. Like a can of plain tomato sauce. The mussels were atrocious - they actually felt and tasted like powder. The scallops could&#39;ve been chicken they were so tough and dry. In my opinion, it&#39;s a sin against the entirety of seafood to overcook scallops like that. In addition, the temperature of my dish was all over the place. Some pieces of calamari were ice cold. Some pieces of shrimp were so hot they burned my mouth. After mixing the insanely hot with the very cold my whole dish was basically lukewarm. Extremely disappointing for a birthday dinner. 

Didn&#39;t even get a chance to finish my wine and pick at the noodles before our waitress came and boxes up my pasta even though my boyfriend was only halfway through his steak and I had plenty of mediocre food left. Big party at the back got all the staffs attention and we left displeased. Not sure what to do with all this leftover pasta in my fridge now..."

The service was okay, a very nice server, but way too slow bringing out the drinks. The salad was so cold you had to let it warm up to be able to eat it. The shrimp salad was good, but nothing special. The chicken marsala was one of the worst I&#39;ve ever had, considering it was a house specialty I was even more disappointed. Other members of the party ate less than a quarter of their dishes stating they were inedible. I didn&#39;t taste them myself but trust their word. And then the bill came........yowza! I don&#39;t mind paying a lot for a good meal, but I do mind paying a huge bill for a very mediocre meal.

The bottom line for me is that the food is way overrated, there are much better offerings in Geneva."

Atmosphere: it was actually really nice. It wasn&#39;t congested or overly loud. The place was clean and had space so you didn&#39;t feel crowded. It has a nice warm cozy feel about it. 

Service: the host was really nice a mid aged young gentleman with glasses on was friendly and seated us immediately we came in for a late lunch/early dinner. 

Our waitress was on the verge of being really bored of working and slightly annoyed with us.  When I state annoyed with us I mean when we asked questions related to the menu she seemed annoyed that we were even asking.  When we also asked to see the dessert menu she literally tossed/threw it on the table. Overall I think she was rude and she does not need to be in a job where she deals with people. She also rarely came back to the point we were always grabbing another waitress or yelling across the restaurant to get her attention which I am sure annoyed other diners (which was slightly embarrassing). 

Food: Ok I think I may have just ordered the wrong things but one thing I would recommend you do NOT order is the salmon salad. The lettuce was disgusting and close to mushy and the salmon has the wrong taste it wasn&#39;t rancid but overcooked and it did not taste fresh. 

I had the cauliflower soup and it was supposed to be a cream of soup it was runny and watered down with little flavour. Dessert was just kind of frozen tasting-like frozen chocolate cake. 

What my friend ordered was really delicious looking and she stated it was really good. And the other food from other tables I saw flying by looked very delicious I think I just ordered all the wrong things :(. 

I gave it three stars because the service by our excuse for a server was piss poor at best and because all 3 items that I personally ordered were ok to fair.To be fair I think I will come back on a different day and try again and see if maybe they were just having an off day. I really hope they were as I kind of really liked the atmosphere of this place. 

We went on a Saturday and like many other posters the restaurant does get busy around the 530-600 hour as we were leaving...maybe their service gets better as well."

Our experience started of well with a very tasty appetizer, the Beef Brochette, and I had their house beer which reminded me of a Killians Irish Red. Their soup of the day, chicken tortilla, was good too but really the thing that fell short, unfortunately, was the main course. While my steak was pretty good (the blue cheese crust was a little overpowering but I can&#39;t really complain about a blue cheese crust being to blue cheesy) but my fiance&#39;s chicken Alfredo was very under seasoned (reheating it at home with a good dose of salt, pepper, and parmesan cheese produced a better outcome even thought it was reheated pasta). The white chocolate cheesecake for dessert helped soften the disappointment of the main course. 

While the meal began and ended well, falling short on the most important (and most expensive) part of the meal is cause for a couple lost stars."

Our server was actually bad, because she did not follow through with promises. If you say you will get more bread, do not make us ask for more 10 minutes later. If every one has empty water glasses at the start of the meal; do not ask if any one needs water refills. Service rated 1 star on this visit.

Most of the food we had was mediocre, or downright awful.

Appetizers - shrimp cocktail was ok
                    mussels were awful. Overcooked, too small, and a waste of money.
                    the sauce the mussels came in was outstanding, and we ate it on
                     the bread as a makeshift appetizer. This was when we were brought
                     bread refills

Entrees - Signature rib dinners were not so special. Dry, overcooked ribs, with a 
                peculiar bbq sauce poured on top. Presentation was poor.
                Cajun ribeye sandwich had no flavor and the meat was tough. Cajun
                to me means spicy. Not here.
                French onion soup had the perfect mix of bread and cheese. It is
                unfortunate, however, because the soup was so salty it was inedible.
                The au gratin potatoes, which I loved before, tasted like fish. Something
                was definitely off this evening. 

When a restaurant charges high end prices, say 30 to 40 dollars for entrees, one expects attentive service as well as a high level of quality of the food.

Sadly, we received poor food, with even worse service. There are better alternatives in the tri cities that we will exhaust before we return here. This restaurant seems to be resting on its past reputation. No effort seemed to be made to create a superior dish, properly cooked, seasoned, and presented. The sandwich was actually served on a plate, with zero garnishments. It takes effort to keep a good restaurant running well, and we did not see much effort being exerted."

We walked in, excited for a good dinner, and were greeted by one of the least personable and service-oriented hostesses I have encountered in my entire life. 

That left me with a sour taste in my mouth to start the day, but I left feeling fantastic, so that tells you something about how awesome this place is. Our waitress was kind, courteous, and helpful (pressing us to order just moments before the party of 30 was perhaps the most helpful thing a waitress has ever done in my experience). 

The atmosphere is what you might expect at a relatively pricy steak house. You get the feeling of being high class, but not without being accessible. It&#39;s a surprisingly urban spot in the far outskirts of the suburbs. 

As far as the food goes, I&#39;ve usually only had burgers and steaks here, which are -- understandably -- delicious. Last night I decided to branch out and try a a Cajun tuna which was almost certainly the best tuna I&#39;ve had in my life. Add to that a delicious French Onion soup and a baked goat cheese appetizer, and we had a meal that left me as satisfied as I was after hitting some of the finer establishments in Charleston, SC (a place a bit more renowned for great food than my birthplace in the west suburbs)."

We had five in our dinner party all ordering from the dinner menu and everyone was pleased with their entrées which included the prime rib, filet, and the special of the day which was salmon. The appetizer to go for is the goat cheese. 

The wine list really needs some work, the selections are extremely limited. Scotch and other liquors, there is a better selection.

Our server Audra was amazing, my brother and I both know what we like in food and despite our boisterous nature she was right there with us.  Recommended for a special occasion."

Our reservation was for 8:30, so we showed up at 7:00, put our name in, and waited the 40 minutes until our seating across the street at a bar.  Perfect.

The steak was perfection.  Really.  I asked for medium/medium well, and with a confused look, my waitor made it happen.  Thanks waitor!  This is excellence on a plate!  My sweet potato even came with the special whipped butter and brown sugar on the side-- that&#39;s the way to do it.

The bf&#39;s porkchop was also excellent, but not gonna lie, he was a little jealous of my filet mignon.

The bus boys were very attentive, our waitor was a little busy, and I would ask for the crab cakes to be a little more crispy on the outside.  But, our experience was great.  And, they let us sit there as long as we wanted, with no pressure.  

I appreciate it, Foxfire.  Thanks.  And thanks to groupon, for letting us know about this place in the first place!"

We arrived around 5pm on a Saturday.  Walked right up and were seated immediately.  It looks like the sweet spot is before 6:30 because as we were leaving there was the beginnings of a wait.

We started with the Fox Fire Red Ale.  Who knew they had they own brew?  Ours was excellent!  A nice compliment to our crab cake appetizer which also was good.

My wife had the Salmon Alfredo which she thoroughly enjoyed although it had a few too many noodles compared to the other ingredients.

I usually try a filet mignon when ever I&#39;m at a steak place.  This time I tried the Filet Oscar.  I loved it.  the asparagus bed was crisp the filet was juicy and cooked to a pefect medium.  It was all topped with a creamy sauce and a crab cake.

The service too was attentive.  Even though they were getting busy near the end of our stay, our waitress was still attentive and yet not too pushy for us to clear the table.

The only reason this is 4 instead of 5 stars is due to the price.  $23 for the Salmon Alredo and $36 for the Filet Oscar.  Not bad but just a tad higher than our normal fare."

There were only a few people in the place. I have to say everything was great from start to finish. I had the mixed green salad with peppercorn ranch dressing (a suggestion from our enthusiastic waitress) which was delicious. The filet was scrumptious and perfectly cooked. The au gratin potatoes were wonderful as well - sliced very thinly and not overcooked. The white chocolate raspberry cheescake I had for desert was my least favorite part of the meal, though it was very tasty. I felt it paled in comparison to my friend&#39;s flourless chocolate cake. 

So thanks to Yelp for the suggestion. We really enjoyed our visit. If I could give 4.5 stars, I would."

They were not prepared for this crowd. No we had not made reservations, big mistake. They were sitting everyone and overloading the servers and the kitchen. We were sat outside where two servers were trying to meet the needs of nearly 18 tables, needless to say everything went extremely slow.

We have eaten here before and have had good service and good food. My wife ordered the ribs and they were a little tough, but very tasty. I tried the peppers. They claimed it to be two peppers, actually two halves. Though the ingredients sounded good, they did not meld together well, I would not recommend them, try something else.

The last two times we have gone, we have gone on Thurs - it lasts til 7 and we sat at the bar, had 4 or 5 appetizers and a bottle of wine for a great dinner at a really good price.  The shrimp skewers are a favorite - with these unique spicy little red peppers and pineapple, very tasty.  Mussels are also good - the only complaint there is they need to include more toast points.  Also has a Cajun beef slider that was really nice.  Mushroom caps and beef skewers were OK, but instead I would try the ahi tuna next time"

The server didn&#39;t come to our table at first, but when he finally did, he was attentive.  I ordered a glass of wine and it was a nice pour - not skimpy.  We ordered the Asian Calamari appetizer and it was very tasty.  He did not rush us for our dinner orders.  Dinners are on average $24 (unless you order a pasta).  We were there for steaks.  The menu has a good explanation of how to order your steak in terms of rare to well done.  You can also upgrade and buy a sauce for your steak.  We both ordered ribeyes, which come with a starch and small salad.  They could do better on the wimpy salad - but they want you to buy an &#34;upgrade&#34; for $5.  Some sides and veges are also extra $.  I am starting to feel nickled and dimed about now.  Steaks were about half-inch thick, tasty and cooked to order.  They were busy that night and maybe trying to save a minute or two off the cooking time - but that didn&#39;t effect our steaks which were very tasty and juicy.  We ordered dessert, but it would have been nice to see a dessert tray.  Skip the 7-layer chocolate cake - a little dry and just so so.      

The tables are set along the one wall.  Several tables are in front (along the bar area, but elevated and separated by a railing) then 4 booths are across from the open-kitchen/serving station (where we sat) and more tables in back.  There is a back door into the restaurant and thank goodness we weren&#39;t seated at those tables - the people walking in and out would be very distracting!  Especially if you are dropping $100 to $150 for dinner for 2.

Wish they would include more with their entrees (simple sauces, veges, etc) instead of making you pay extra and they could easily make a better salad without charging extra - such an easy thing to do.  I think they are trying to be high-end and the entrees don&#39;t reflect that kind of restaurant."

Personally, if it were not for her and the fact the waitress was awesome (thanks Marcie or Marcia), I would be giving them only 2 stars!!

First off, the place was clean, open and not congested.  There were plenty of seats open, but due to not having reservations, we were seated near the bar, which was just fine with us.

Started off with a red Wine for my Girlfriend and a Blue Moon for me.  Both were perfect.  Dinner rolls were brought to the table as well, but seemed they were not fresh made and in fact looked just like the frozen or processed variety.

We started off with the Sesame Encrusted Ahi Tuna appetizer, which although appeared to not have been entirely fresh and slightly over-seared, it was tasty.  FYI..  the &#34;Micro Greens&#34; they have listed are not much more than Julienne style carrots and cucumber peels!!  Very difficult to eat with anything but your hands, if you decided to do so.

For dinner, we split the Porterhouse with the FoxFire Style topping (wine sauce and blue cheese).  Here is what it says in their menu:
Porterhouse - Our 20 oz. Certified Black Angus Beef is a selection of two favorite cuts - New York strip and filet Mignon. Served with your choice of starch. 44-

The cut they served us was nothing more than a stringy and full of fat / gristle T-Bone!!   This is not the higher quality Porterhouse expected based on the description their Menu implies.  I would not be upset,  but  $44 DOLLARS for a piece of meat that also seemed like it was being covered up by the &#34;Fox Fire Style&#34; sauce....  well, that&#39;s just highway robbery!!  I wanted to say something, but my girlfriend said no, lets just go, and we will probably not return....  sad, really sad!"

Finally went the other night with my fiance.  This place did a good job.  The restaurant is bigger than you would expect and the atmosphere is casual and relaxed.  We arrived on a friday night without reservations and were seated immediately.

They have a nice wine list - fiance had a nice Pinot Noir and i opted for a Malbec.  We started off with the seafoiod fritter (halibut or trout I think) and it was yummy.  I went with a house salad and the chicken, artichokes and blackberry entree.  Fiance went with french onion soup as started and then the filet diane for an entree.  All the food was excellent.  The soup was tasty without being overly salty.  The steak was cooked perfectly and came with great roasted potatoes.  My chicken was great - the suace was a blackbery flavored balsamic and it was yummy.    We tried desserts - i opted for the espresso creme brulee and fiance went wiht the chocolate fusion.  Both were great.

the service was great - spot on, friendly and helpful.  We will return."

The menu was typical Chicago suburban steak fare, but you have myriad options of how your steak is prepared, which is a huge plus.  And they do know their temperatures.  Med-rare really is med-rare - very important.  A decent wine selection and the cozy, woodsy fireplace made it comfortable.

With both dishes the sauces were perfect however there was very little chicken in the butter chicken (VERY LITTLE)  and very little peas (beans?) in the Matar Paneer.  Both dishes were 99% liquid.

UPDATE: 5/3/2016

In my previous review I stated our disappointment that our order contained mostly sauce.  We have been in contact with the owners and they truly care and are honest people that run this restaurant. 

They corrected the mistake and we are satisfied.

Truth be known Mast Masala&#39;s Butter Chicken and Matar Paneer are the very best we have ever had of all the Indian Restaurants we have ever gone to.   Whoever does the cooking for this restaurant is not simply a cook but a master chef.  We are not adventurous so we basically stick with Buttered Chicken and Matar Paneer but have sampled enough different Indian restaurants with these two dishes to get a feel for good and great.

Mast Masala&#39;s Butter Chicken and Matar Paneer is not simply good but great.  Easily great.

Just call direct instead of ordering through the EAT24 app! I prepaid through the app, when I arrived 10 minutes after placing the order they didn&#39;t know about my order. EAT24 kept calling them, but the man helping me must not be familiar with how EAT24 works as I ended up talking to the EAT24 lady and telling her to just cancel the order and I&#39;d pay him directly.

He is vegetarian and I was suspect that I would enjoy the appetizers he ordered. This was my first experience with IP food and I must say, I was absolutely blown away.

I had no idea anyone could layer so many flavors into a dish and you would reach another level of flavor with every bite. This stuff was pure vegetables, if I could make vegetable taste that damned good I would be 100% vegetarian today!

Then out came this Naan bread. If you don&#39;t know what naan bread is, when done right, like they do here, it is the most delicate and delicious bread I have ever had. I also got a chicken tikka masala I think it was and it had this creamy delicious gravy that was amazing with the bread.

This was my first experience with this regional fare and I was stunned at the complexity of flavors as well as the depth the flavors enhanced each other.

It was literally an explosion of flavor with every bite.

I would gleefully come back anytime!

Ambiance: Cozy
Food: OUT-STANDING!!!
Value: no clue, it was my birthday!"

There was a salad dish, veggie samosas, 6 veggie sides (masala, yogurt, curry, saag based), and 2 meat dishes. They also serve fresh roasted red chicken, on a hot plate with onions (which I believe is typical for lunch buffets) and hot naan, both that they bring to the table. The manager (?) there checked in every once in a while to make sure everything was good or if we needed more water. Everything was very tasty and flavorful- the buffet looks small but I typically like smaller buffets because then you know they make it fresh everyday and it gives it a homey feel. Not that I have anything against large buffets, but I feel like making food in smaller batches gives it good quality control. For dessert there was a sweet carrot item (that my friends really enjoyed) and gulab jamun. 

I absolutely love indian food and my friend that I was with, who happens to also be indian, says that Mast Masala is one of her favorite place to go to and get indian food!

***Quick tid-bit (because I&#39;m all up for transparency) : Someone messaged me saying that they had been to Mast Masala in Hanover a few times and wasn&#39;t aware of the lunch buffet.

I&#39;ve only been there once on a Wedn. afternoon, so I am not sure if they have the buffet every lunch weekday or not. I could have been lucky when I went, since my friend was the one who suggested the place. I would suggest calling ahead and asking if they have it that day! There is definitely a (small) buffet at this location!"

I had NEVER tried Indian food before I came here and I am glad I started here because I was totally wowed! First time here, I ordered Butter Chicken and my girlfriend and I shared a plate of Naan. Food came out hot and quickly and it was delicious! I think what I like about Indian food is the layers of flavor in each dish. Everything is amazing! I recently went to the lunch buffet and first of all, WOW, only $8.99 during the week? Crazy! The buffet isn&#39;t huge, but it has so many options! I tried many new things including the Paneer Tikka Masala, which I liked more than the Chicken Tikka Masala! I also tried some lentils and several other entrees (Sorry, I don&#39;t remember what everything is called!). With the buffet, you also get an order of Naan and an order of Tandoori chicken. I loved the Tandoori chicken! Kind of like a dry-rubbed BBQ chicken and it came out sizzling! I wish it was closer to my house so I could eat there more often.

3 adults and a baby paid a visit to Mast Masala on a Sunday evening because the wife had a hankering for butter chicken.  Although there is no shortage of Indian restaurants in Schaumburg proper, we wanted to try something new...Yelp to the rescue!  For the appetizer, we ordered the green chicken tikka, which we all agreed was moist and full of flavor.  The main course brought us to Vegetable Korma, Butter Chicken, Chicken Vindaloo, garlic naan, onion kulcha, raita, and plain rice.  EVERY single dish was sinfully delicious!

I LIKE Mast Masala but there&#39;s something about the food that makes me not LOVE it. My Indian food palate isn&#39;t refined enough to tell you what exactly it is about the food here that makes it less delicious than some other Indian places I frequent, but I can tell you that it has a certain sweetness to it. And maybe even an anise/licorice flavor. Maybe it&#39;s a different region than I usually eat but it just seemed off. All of it. 

We got a Butter Chicken, a Chicken Tikka Masala, some garlic naan, and an order of the Aloo Ghobi...our usual try out foods for any new Indian place. I will say this...the standout of our entire meal was the garlic naan. It was HUGE. We ordered 4 orders (one naan an order) thinking they&#39;d be smaller. Big mistake. Each naan is the size of two regular pancakes stuck together. No wonder they were $2.50 each. Sheesh. Needless to say, there&#39;s a couple of leftover naan in the fridge as we speak. Other than the carbs though? Everything else was just okay. The food comes with a ton of sauce (which is great to dip your naan in!) but not a lot of meat. And the meat you do get is somehow really dry. Even the vegetables were just alright and had a different flavor to them than usual. At least it came nice and spicy (white girl spicy, that is) even when ordering it mild. I could even go medium here but surely the hot would burn my mouth off. Be warned. 

Overall, this is a good Indian place, but it&#39;s not great. Guess I have to keep searching for &#34;the one&#34;. Oh well."

They should probably expand their space and get some seating for the guys who are waiting - we had like 3 different groups waiting before us and two after us. Everyone went to walgreens nearby :p

Once seated, I thought the service and staff both were really good. We got some papad w/chutney as complementary. We got the cilantro chciken tikka sizzler as appetizer. Even though, it was SIZZLING it tasted good. We got the butter naan ( 4 pc) with Butter chicken masala - which by far tasted the best among probably about 10 other indian restaurants I have visited in the NW suburbs of chicago. We got the chicken briyani - which had a lot of chicken - which was super cooked and tasted good. It was more like Dum briyani kinda style (not sure if they mixed rice and chicken tikka masala), but I really cant complain about the taste. Good job guys :)..

Since we cook our own Indian food at home, and love it, I was hesitant but willing. Since he is from London and use to the curry shops there, I trusted his judgement on this one and we were not let down. We tried the Lamb Korma and the Chicken Tikka Masala. Since I did not have control of the spices, I had my korma served medium, and his tikka was served hot. Both complimented each other favorably. The lamb was so tender, it was easily cut with a fork. There was a generous amount of gravy in our pots for dipping as well. The meal came with quite enough rice, which by the way was cooked perfectly. We ordered the butter naan and the garlic naan- again - plenty for both of is and delicious. 

The decor was lovely, not at all like a typical London curry shop- which was a pleasant surprise to my husband. After all, it&#39;s not about the decor, it&#39;s about the taste. And this one past his stringent test.. 
Since this is the only Indian Restaurant I have visited in the Chicago area - I am 5 starring it and setting the bar high. 

The price for our meal was a ridiculous $31.00 for 2 people. VERY reasonable, since we left completely full.

I ordered lamb vindaloo tonight &amp; it was greasy with a LOT of inedible pieces of unidentifiable &#34;stuff&#34; in it. Our buttered chicken had no curry in it.  I had to go back &amp; ask for rice again.  I&#39;d already paid for our food, and before leaving, I asked the woman who&#39;d taken my money if there was rice in the order.  That stopped the transaction dead in its tracks.  She had to go to the kitchen and get approval to add rice to the order.  I got a small container of white rice - not Basmati rice as the previous owners would give us with our order.  While I was waiting, the owner was standing there staring at me.  No smile, not acknowledgement that I&#39;d just paid $50 for a meal for 3 people.  While I was waiting there, I noticed my shoes were sticking to the floor.

We used to be loyal customers - we came in 10 times over the past year and the food was outstanding.  The new owners clearly don&#39;t get it and they don&#39;t care - we&#39;ve given them 3 chances.   We won&#39;t be back."

So I decided to give this place a try.   First time I did carryout and ordered their Chicken Vinadaloo along with veggie samosas (though I want to find a place that does Keema samosas) and some naan.   I thought the food was fine...was disappointed with the naan portion but then realized they only charged $2 for it and I could take a second order and be satisfied and that price would be around what other places typically charge.

My second visit was a weekday evening.   First good sign was that there were a lot of Indian families at the restaurant.    I was my usual party of one so they sat me in an area away from the families which was nice.

This time I had two orders of the butter naan which more than satisfied the bread order.   I this time ordered the Shrimp Korma along with an appetizer of veggie samosas (still looking for a good keema...sigh) and basmati rice.   I also had an order of mango lassi which I thought was a little more room temperature than I would&#39;ve liked.   Also thought I could&#39;ve used more rice (though maybe I have to do two orders of that as well).   Barely had enough rice for the leftovers the next day.

My coworker highly recommended Mast Masala - he said the cuisine here is from his home region and, in fact, has a dish that he cannot find anywhere else in the area - Khoya Kaaju (fresh cashews cooked in a creamy sauce).  We had it and it was delicious.

We also have had MANY different dishes and have yet to be disappointed with ANY of them!  (Vegetable Samosas, Paneer Pakora, Chicken Tikka, Butter Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Korma, Malai Kofta, Lamb Korma, Lamb Curry, Garlic Naan, Butter Naan, and Lacha Paratha)

If they were closer to my home, we&#39;d be here at least once a month - it&#39;s almost a 30 minute drive for me but it is definitely better than any other Indian restaurant inside that driving radius from my home!!"

If you want to real authentic Punjabi food then you should visit this place first. Food is always fresh and taste out of the world. Please try the Bullet Naan. It&#39;s amazing. Also do not forget to order paneer tikka and dal tadka with extra tadka. I have been to this place almost 6-7 times and never been to anywhere.

And quieter than what I had expected. Probably because it&#39;s midday and a weekday. Besides me and hubby, two other groups of people were eating at the time. 

Our experience today was way much better than our first visit. I must say they redeemed themselves. Our server, whom I believe to be the owner as well, was very quiet but professional. We were promptly seated and checked on at appropriate amount of times. We got garlic naan, veg samosa, channa masala and mango lassi for drinks. You just know that these food are of the best quality and are always made fresh. 

Great food and better service! Had the server been a bit upbeat, we&#39;d give a bigger tip. Nonetheless, we&#39;ll def come back for their awesome food:)"

I was rather apprehensive when I first got here on a Monday night; the whole place was empty with just a woman behind the cash register.
Anyways, given it was Monday night, I had to try to be fair--- Paneer tikka masala was very different from what I have had at other Indian restaurants, daal makhani was not-so good, lacked taste and flavor. It was a regular kaali daal with taste not close to typical dal makhani. We will be back for sure to for a in-house service. I shall update my review then."

I never asked!!!.  I know when you start making other restaurants look bad, yours isn&#39;t any better.    He explained they provide more meat and there plates are larger.  I said okay and I don&#39;t care.  When I got home, my chicken dish had  5 or 6 pieces of hard chicken and the rest was just gravy.  I called later and explained and he had no answer.

However, last night we picked up dinner from there for the first time in a few months, and it was obviously quite different (in a disappointing way).  New chef, perhaps? The shrimp dish (shrimp korma) contained only about 7-8 really overcooked, quarter-sized shrimp.  The onion kulcha was very greasy, and the onions used were quite sharp/bitter, not the usual sweet, mild onions usually found in onion kulcha.  Actually, this was the first time that we didn&#39;t want to save our leftovers in the fridge.  With the overall change in quality and flavor, we&#39;re disappointed.  We&#39;re hoping it was just a fluke, but I&#39;m afraid we&#39;re not likely to venture back."

I was very happy with the service and food they cooked for me.  I ordered the Butter Chicken - Chicken cooked in heavenly tomato and creamy sauce and came with rice; Butter Naan  - Traditional Indian break baked in clay oven with butter, Kadai Chicken - Chicken cooked with fresh onion, tomato, green pepper and traditional Indian spices; and Vegetable Samosa - Vegetable Patties turnovers stuffed potatoes, peas, and spices.

Everything I ordered tasted perfect.  The Butter Chicken had enough spice to it since most Butter Chicken is cooked without any kick to it, the Butter Naan was heavenly.  When biting in to the bread, it was just like walking on clouds.  I haven&#39;t had Naan as awesome as theirs in a long time.  The Kadai Chicken was also cooked to perfection.  The chicken was moist with the perfect amount of spices added to it.  As for the Samosa, it couldn&#39;t have been any better than any other Samosas I&#39;ve eaten.  The flaky bread married with the potato and peas filling made me want to eat it all day.  

I gave this 5 stars because of the customer service I received and how delicious the food was cooked for me."

My boyfriend and I planned to order take out from Mast Masala. We tried calling about 10 times to place our order and then phone just kept ringing and ringing. Finally we decided just to drive over and place an order - about a 15 minute drive. We get there and asked to place a carry out order and they immediately questioned us why we didn&#39;t call ahead with the order - as it will take an hour. At this point I was livid - and told them that we called 10 times without anyone bothering to answer the phone. The least they could have done was accomodate us and take our order. But after discussing with the employees - you could tell that they didn&#39;t care whether or not we were serviced. NEVER WILL COME BACK HERE. Instead we drove over to a competitor of theirs who happily took our order and will take all of our orders in the future. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

First of all, the older man in the restaurant--I think he may be the manager--was extremely inattentive and rude. I&#39;ve never had to order white rice separately (it&#39;s usually included in the meal in any Indian restaurant I go to) but I was told since I didn&#39;t order it, I wouldn&#39;t get it. The appetizers--veggie samosas, seekh kabob and chicken pakoda--were pretty good and they all had distinct flavored from one another. I can&#39;t say the same thing for the main dishes. Butter chicken, shrimp vindaloo and chili paneer all tasted very similar. Even worse, the Vindaloo seems to use the standard american method of drenching everything in tomato sauce. The  only other things we had was okra masala and onion kulcha and those was very good. I have to admit the young server/waiter we had was very friendly and did his job very well. I wouldn&#39;t come here again based on the food quality and long wait for food.

Side note: the food did not sit well with me and I ended up with a nasty case of upset stomach during the night and early the next day."

Well I didn&#39;t feel like paying more money for less variety so I took off.  I then went to go a couple miles down the road to Himalayan.  That place is gone!  Triple dang!  It&#39;s just not my day.

Edit:  So they brought back the lunch specials they told me they weren&#39;t going to have anymore.  It&#39;s like it was before, but doesn&#39;t come with the chicken tandoori anymore, which is a shame since it was really good.  You get filled up for 7 bucks though so it&#39;s still a good deal."

mast-masala-hanover,William B.,t-QRWAHVazoHiSaaBSXJKA,"Crystal Lake, IL",0,1,1,37,19,yxDAV5ghaYK9TtMNxyTcGw,4.0,2013-02-11,"Its been quite a while since I&#39;ve branched out to try any new indian cuisine in the area, but  since my family&#39;s favorite local place for indian food has closed (those who know), we will now be on a quest to find a new favorite.  I don&#39;t know how long Mast has been around, but it appears fairly new.
Mast Masala was recommended by a friend (oops, I didn&#39;t yelp search first), and Mast didn&#39;t disappoint.  
Upon first experience, I was impressed.  Mast appears to be a nice, small, clean place.  Everything we ordered seemed very freshly prepared.  Compared to the typical diners of indian cuisine, we eat early enough to qualify for the early bird special.  Place was dead when we arrived.  Some would see this as a bad sign, but the typical diner usually eats later in the evening.  Plus, with the kids, we feel its easier on us, the kids, and the wait staff if we get in and out early before a place gets hectic. 
When we try a new place, we like to first try the old standbys to compare.  However, we deviated a little this time.  We usually get a vegetable pakora to start, but got the pakora platter this time, which had both paneer (cheese) &amp; vegetable pakora.  The vegetables we more of a hash brown, or blended veggie patty, instead of individual fried veggies- very tasty.  The paneer had a green, spicy sauce inside; also very tasty, and 2 of the 3 kids approved.
For main courses, we tried the chicken tikka &#34;sizzler&#34;.  A little different than We are used to, closer to a regular tandoori chicken, but still good, none the less.  Our usual saucy dish was hijacked by our daughter.  She usually just lets us order, as we all share, and we know what everyone likes.  But she decided to open a menu and pick something out, so we went with it.  She chose the chicken curry.  It was very good.  Different, as we typically get a tomato sauce based dish.  As the description says, this has a traditional sauce.  I would order it again, though would probably want to make the rounds on the menu first just to try different things.  We also ordered the mutter paneer, which is a vegetarian dish of peas &amp; paneer in a creamy sauce.  We ordered everything mild, as we didn&#39;t know what we were getting nito, and didn&#39;t want to turn off the kids.  The mutter paneer was so mild, it was almost sweet.  We would probably order this spicier next time.  We had to order 3 full entrees since everything is a la carte, which raised the price we are used to for the cuisine.  We do like the places that offer a &#39;thali&#39; as it provides enough side dishes that we don&#39;t have to order more entrees.  But I suppose the kids are getting older, and they get more expensive to feed.
As we were finishing our meal, every table was full and there were several groups waiting for tables.
We will probably be back.  As we try more of their menu, I can foresee I will likely raise their rating."

Been coming here for many years, and never a duff meal.
Never screwed up an order.
Never had to wait long for my take-out order, even when the place was slammed.
Their red and green salsas they throw in the bag are exemplary.

But here&#39;s the tip!
If you dig HOT, and I mean Yellow-Jacket sting on the Tongue hot.
Go over to the little buffet bar thing adjacent to the kitchen window. It&#39;s not a buffet, but a little stand with condiments. You gotta have condiments with Mex food.
Look for the yellow-beige stuff with Orange shards in one of the trays.
(there are also Radishes, and Cucumbers in other bins)

This is the elusive &#34;Garnish&#34; I was introduced to by the Siren Waitresses at Lalo&#39;s years ago. When I asked them what the Spanish name of this incendiary preparation was, I got a blank stare. 
&#34; &#39;Garnish&#39; is what we call it.&#34; said the assembled Marias, much to my chagrin.

I&#39;ve asked for &#34;Garnish&#34; at countless Mex joints, and have gotten a plate of parsley, a leaf of lettuce, and I won&#39;t be surprised if I get a tiny paper umbrella one of these days. But NEVER the real deal. Imagine my surprise finding again here.

What &#34;Garnish&#34; is: Thinly sliced spanish onion and slivered habañero chiles in a watery creamed dressing, that may or may not have some vinegar in it. Also a smattering of 
what seems to be Mex Oregano and other herbs (but not much).

There must be some synergy between the chiles, onions and vinegar that ramps up the heat factor. I can withstand Hot food well. I&#39;m a big fan. But &#34;Garnish&#34; is like a napalm lozenge. With outstanding flavor. I mix it in my Guacamole, I put in on my Tacos.

I cry like a whimpering little bitch, all the time reaching for more.

There are no covers for the little styrofoam cups on hand to put your condiments in, so while you&#39;re waiting for your take out, go grab a cup, and hand it to the attendant as you pay your bill, they will wrap it up in tin foil.
(I know it&#39;s stupid, I know it&#39;s not the case, but each time I bring &#34;garnish&#34; home, I expect the Styrofoam to be melted or degraded. It&#39;s a slight neurosis, but I laugh at it.)

the epilogue: I&#39;ve asked each attendant there what they called the preparation I call &#34;Garnish&#34;. I got blank stares. They did NOT say &#34;Garnish&#34;. In fact I got shrugged shoulders and blank stares just as I got at Lalos. I looked to the apparent Boss-guy and HE didn&#39;t have anything to say-he shrugged his shoulders again and said &#34;Habañeros?&#34; Like he was aksing ME what the hell its name was.

Normally my husband and I order the nachos as an appetizer.  You can definitely split them between a few people.  Sometimes we will order them and the one combo platter, other times we order them and two meals and take the leftovers home :)

The combos are great because you can try a few different things and get rice and beans. I order at least one tamale because I am addicted!! They are so moist and delicious, definitely the best I&#39;ve had in a long time!!!

I would describe Arandas as fast, delicious, and cheap.  The perfect combination for a quick date night!!  It isn&#39;t the prettiest place, but the food is awesome!"

Probably more 3-1/2 stars than four but I didn&#39;t want to deny them a half-star by rating it a 3. I eat here more than any other Mexican place in the area as it is close to home. While there may be better taquerias in and around Aurora/Montgomery/Oswego, this place consistently delivers tasty food that&#39;s served quickly and at very reasonable prices. 

Favorites include the Tacos Al Pastor (I prefer them with cilantro &amp; onions, a squeeze of lime and one of their excellent salsas). Chicken and steak tacos are also very good. My niece likes their guacamole and nachos. I prefer to order tacos ala carte, but have ordered the taco dinner with rice and beans a couple times. The rice and beans are fine, they&#39;re just, well, rice and beans. I&#39;d rather order an additional taco if I&#39;m really hungry.

FYI, soft drinks are served in a can; no fountain drinks. If you dine in they provide a styrofoam cup filled with ice. Have not tried the horchata that everyone raves about since I&#39;m not a fan. Also note that if you dine in, a server will take your order but you pay at the register. (I&#39;ve also noticed that a check may not always be brought to your table, but you can just go to the register and tell them where you were seated and they&#39;ll ring you up.)

Plenty of parking (it&#39;s located in the shopping center anchored by Jewel off Rte 30). It won&#39;t win any awards for decor, but it&#39;s still a pleasant place to dine in. Although it can get crowded at times, I have always been able to find a seat. TVs around the dining room are tuned to Telemundo soap operas most of the time, while at other times traditional Mexican tunes are played. Because of the volume, it can get a bit loud when crowded, but that just adds a lively vibe to the experience."

Their steak (asada) has been hit and miss--sometimes great (browned well) but other times look like boiled grayness.

I ordered each one with steak and told them easy on the tomato&#39;s, which they did. Had a coke (in can), no fountain service here. He said they&#39;d bring it out to me and not worry about paying until I was done eating.

I have to say, my tortas was excellent, just the correct amount of steak, lettuce, tomato. Rice was moist and the beans...the beans just melted when I took a bite.

Taco was double wrapped in soft flour shell. I should have asked if they had corn. Shell was a little too soft but not enough to lower the rating by a star.

Burrito was good sized, hot and stuffed with enough steak to be a very good value.

From quantity, quality and value you can&#39;t go wrong. Plus their open late (12AM weekdays, 3AM weekends). I only eat halal so this also gives it another star.

I&#39;ve been here many times. Mostly because it&#39;s open late, and the only other option is McDonald&#39;s. They have a wide variety of stuff like hot dogs, burgers, philly cheesteaks, chicken wings, etc. The hot dogs come with ketchup and lettuce (along with other ingredients). That should tell you something. With the exception of the deep fried philly cheeseteak which is really good, everything else I&#39;ve had there has been pretty bland.

Gyros sandwich was super dry. Hot dog had ketchup and lettuce. Some of the fried foods are pretty bland. Mozzarella sticks are super bland. BUT if you have had a couple of drinks and you want an extensive menu of just OK food, this is the spot."

I plan to go back again - I mean its convenient and has a huge menu, why complain lol

Tip - Make sure you get your sauce/ketchup before you leave because they do not give out condiments for take out, so if you don&#39;t have it at home or wherever you decide to eat - don&#39;t forget!"

I guess it&#39;s a good sign that they&#39;re busy, but it can be a pain.  They have a sign saying you don&#39;t have to wait if you&#39;re picking up ordered food, but they only have one guy running the cash register, so you HAVE to wait for him.  So far I&#39;ve tried their Italian beef, which is ok, Don Walkers is much better for those, as well as the onion rings, which are frozen and prepackaged here, but fresh cut and delicious at Don Walkers.  However, I can say that they make a terrific Philly Steak sandwich!!  Just make sure you take off the limp lettuce first, as it has no business being there in the first place.  Like I said, don&#39;t get the onion rings, their crinkle cut fries are really good anyway, and most sandwiches come with them anyway.  Their lemonades are also quite tasty and have myriad exotic flavors to choose from.  

I am also glad to see a new business taking root in Northgate, as that poor decrepit shopping center needs new money, business and is screaming out for a make-over. FIX THE NORTHGATE SIGN ALREADY, AURORA!!!!"

I&#39;ve been there 3 times total, don&#39;t think I&#39;ll go again. Food is decent, nothing special. The first time was soon after they opened and the whole experience was decent, but again, nothing special. Second time I placed the order 30 minutes ahead of time and had to wait in a long line (even though there is a sign saying you don&#39;t have to wait, but there is only one person on register, how do you not wait?) and when I finally got to the register they hadn&#39;t even started my food, so I had to wait. Third time I placed the order ahead of time again, and the place was empty when I got there. As I got up the to the register the cashier got a call on his cell phone and WALKED AWAY to take the call. So I had to wait about 5-6 minutes while the cashier walked around the back, talking in a language I couldn&#39;t understand (don&#39;t know what the call was about) before they finally came back and took my order, which again, was not done. Both the second and third time, the cashier seemed like they we&#39;re annoyed that I was there to make an order, like I was interrupting their day. So average food, on top of horrible service, means this business won&#39;t be seeing me again. Hire a nice, friendly cashier and maybe a second register for busy times, and you could get a 3, maybe 4 star review. I was disappointed, Aurora needs some more good, quick, local joints."

From a previous review, someone complained by a &#39;small&#39; beer list. I completely disagree as it was enormous and they had numerous specials as well (specials of the day and specials of the month).

My wife ordered the Fig Pizza and by Chicago standards, it was unique. The crust made the pizza but the toppings complemented a sweet and salty contrast (Fig against cheese).

My buffalo shrimp appetizer with the siracha sauce was done to perfection. Although only five shrimp were served with the dish, they were extremely tasty and satisfyingly large.

Our other companions ordered burgers and sandwiches which equally looked good.

Both times I was there for lunch on a Sunday.  The staff was attentive and friendly.  The place is dead at 11:30 but I was told that there is a park close by and once the kids are done with sports a bit later in the day, it gets crowded.  They have a ton of TVs as well.  The wine list isn&#39;t great but they do serve in a chilled wine glass, which I thought was great.  The place is rather large but I do recommend sitting at the bar. There were regulars both times I was there.  

The chicken quesadillas were decent but they are with barbecue, which was sort of a strange flavor in a quesadilla.  The sliders were average to above average.  The pretzels are actually good; many of these frozen pretzel type of things taste like cardboard but these had a good texture and came with three dipping sauces.  My favorite was the beer cheese but there was also a spicy mustard and chipotle butter.  The chicken fingers were above average.  They had good flavor and were super juicy but the breading was a bit too thick and kept coming off.  The fries were nothing special.  Overall, bar food that is elevated and superior service."

While not your ordinary pizza, the fig and prosciutto is EXCELLENT, as is their black and blue burger. Make sure to save room for the Skillet Cookie as well... it is delicious! It is obvious that a lot of painstaking thought and care was given to this menu.

I ordered the seaweed salad, spicy tuna roll, and shrimp tempura. $24.21 including tax, delivery &amp; tip.

Spicy tuna was not very spicy... It was actually pretty boring. Shrimp tempura was ok, better than the spicy tuna, but again nothing exciting.

The sushi rolls were pretty small, which I knew based on the piece count provided on their menu... But there really wasn&#39;t much fish in each roll.... And I was not very full after eating them.

Only positive is that their seaweed salad ($5)  is a decent size compared to restaurants in Chicago.

We should have realized something was wrong when walked in at 7pm on a Saturday night and the place was basically empty. The only thing I can say positive is that the egg rolls were good. 

The crab Rangoon was bland and had no crab flavor at all. They were all cream cheese and onion.

The chicken satay was equally bland. What they called peanut sauce was actually coconut milk with so little peanut sauce as to be only coconut flavored sauce. If you are going to advertise peanut sauce, buy some peanut butter and add it to the coconut milk. Otherwise, just call it coconut sauce.

The Singapore beef was raw when it first came out and overcooked when it came back out.  That is a sure sign of a lazy or incompetent chef. 

I have been to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore and what I ate here would only be found at the lower quality hawker stands.

There are so many other places in the area that are so much better that I will not waste money at one that is this bad."

We both ordered the vegetarian lunch special. It supposedly came with soup, salad, and the sushi rolls. We got the salad, no soup. Ok, no big deal. The sushi came and it was dreadful.

Sauce was weak and the pineapple was mushy and seemed straight-up canned (at least veggies were fresh). Since this place isn&#39;t incredibly cheap (app of crab rangoon plus the chicken dish was ~$17), it was pretty disappointing today, and I know they can do this dish better.

Jin 28 is great for a lunch date! They have a different special each day which is awesome. For 12:30 pm on a Thursday in downtown Nape this place was a pleasantly quite and relaxing find. Now mind you, it took forever to find a parking spot but I blame that on the holiday season.

My mom and I each ordered from the lunch menu - 2 sushi rolls which included your choice of miso soup or salad (for only $6.95!). With plans to share the sushi we ordered 4 different kinds: the avocado, salmon, sweet potato and crunch roll.

My favorites were the sweet potato and crunch roll, but all were pretty good! If you&#39;ve never had a sweet potato sushi roll, definitely give it a try. It&#39;s my new favorite anywhere I go. The miso soup was also delish. Sounds like something you can&#39;t mess up, but oh you can. I&#39;ve had some pretty funky miso soup in my day, so I&#39;m happy to say Jin 28 does it just right!

This wasn&#39;t the best sushi I&#39;ve ever had, but I also ordered some pretty simple rolls and for the price it can&#39;t be beat. I&#39;ll definitely be back to explore the dinner side of the menu and try some specialty rolls. I feel a 5th star coming in the future!"

The jalapeno spicy chicken fried rice is incredible! All white meat chicken (you can select different meats), slices of fresh jalapeno, and quality fried rice. 

The pot stickers (6) were just okay.  I&#39;m pretty sure they were frozen and then deep fried. Parts of them were oily from deep frying but the edges were dried out like had been freezer burnt. The sauce that accompanies them is decent. 

On one particular order, I had spent enough to get a free California roll (6 piece), so I gave it a go. I&#39;ve graduated from the novice sushi rolls so I can&#39;t say it was anything exceptional, but it was well made and fresh.

The Chicken Tom Yum Goong Soup was... different. I&#39;d never tried it before, but I figured since I like almost all of the ingredients(chicken, fresh mushrooms [yuck!] in a tart lime broth and lemongrass, hot chili, lemon juice, cilantro and coconut milk) it was worth a shot. Not sure if it was the coconut milk (never had it before)  or the lime broth, but my tastebuds wanted none of it. Sad, because this is a $7 soup as it&#39;s meant for two.

The Sweet and Sour chicken is quite delicious; I love how they incorporate pieces of chopped bell pepper in the sauce. It gives the dish a bit more depth than the standard pineapple most places use.

The Orange Chicken wasn&#39;t too bad. I found that it had the right amount of heat and sweet, and the breading was crispy enough (it softened a bit due to delivery, but I won&#39;t hold that against them)

I&#39;m eager to try their sashimi (I don&#39;t know how well it would travel if I order delivery) so perhaps I&#39;ll venture out some time to try some, as well as Kamikaze and Crazy Tuna rolls, and many of the Maki."

With a small face and large hazelicious eyes pleading for tempura and miso, I caved. After having eaten here at least 6 times now, I find that each experience causes me to like it less and less, so I will review it now --before another experience whittles it away to a 1-star.

Curry. --a gelatinous abomination.  I&#39;m quite certain it came from a jar. It had a &#34;solid&#34; feel to it and it clung strangely to the chicken and onions. I gag just thinking about it.
 
Mapo Tofu -- Watery. And it claimed to have tofu and ground pork but there was no ground pork to be found. No flavor depth at all. All I could taste was jalapeno. A huge disappointment. My husband&#39;s is definitely better and I once begged him to never make me mapo tofu again. --so take from that what you will.

Wonton Soup. --the tiniest wantons I have ever seen. Two in my whole bowl and they were each the size of a grape tomato. Mostly just watery broth full of julienne vegetables. I would never order that again.

Sushi --it was fine. The flavors were fine. But still &#34;meh&#34;.

Miso --the dashi was a little weak and the tofu pieces miniscule. 

Tempura was fine. I don&#39;t know that you can screw up a fried vegetable. My kids jump on tempura like monkeys on cupcakes and Jin 28&#39;s was no different. Everyone snatching the broccoli. We had shrimp in ours as well. Long, limp, skinny &#34;jumbo shrimp&#34;. --&#34;limp&#34; anything is just a huge turnoff to me. So... a big no thank you.

Reading reviews ... one thing in common, stay away, or even run away from the Pad Thai... GOT IT!  Almost makes you want to order it to see why it&#39;s so bad!

The kids meal is nice and inexpensive.  A little on the unhealthy side.  Wish they offered less fried options and like a veggie side of broccoli or beans or something, for 5 dollars, can&#39;t really complain too much though.

Hot and Sour Soup - actually pretty decent here.  No complaints and I am a hot and sour soup snob!  

I ordered the chicken and lobster sauce.  When I read that I could have chicken instead of shrimp in the traditional shrimp and lobster sauce dish, I was ecstatic.  Sometimes I just don&#39;t feel the shrimp, but want the yummy sauce.  This was pretty yummy as well. It was missing something in terms of flavor, but it was okay.

My husband got the Lard Na.  Huge plate, looked good, he didn&#39;t complain, and ate his leftovers for lunch.  He said it too was just missing something in the flavor, maybe a little more salt.

Either downtown Naperville is getting crazier in terms of how packed it is, or I am just getting older ... hope it&#39;s the not the latter, but there was no wait, food was decent, service was good, so if everyone else is booked, give this place a try.

I was a little worried because the menu is extraordinarily varied and MASSIVE, and I always feel like ya can&#39;t be good at everything, ya know? Like why does this restaurant do Thai, Chinese, sushi...? But I didn&#39;t panic and pressed on - I ordered potstickers, orange chicken, the BBQ pork lo mein, and a philly roll for my husband and I to share. GrubHub estimated our wait to be 50 mins and I patiently (crabbily... I was hangry) waited for the food to arrive. 

75 mins later, I was like turbo mega ultra starving and getting angry when our door finally buzzed. My husband went to answer the door to find a small Asian man running toward him shouting &#34;SO SORRY SO SLOW TONIIIIIIGHT!!!&#34; He thrust the food at him and off he went. Well, points for presentation, I guess.

The food was all packed neatly and smelled delicious. The potstickers had a weird texture (I&#39;m used to steamed or pan fried, these were like straight up deep fried), but the sauce that accompanied them was delightful. The orange chicken was good, but nothing special. The bbq pork lo mein was DELICIOUS. Thick, well-cooked noodles in a delightful brown sauce with assorted veggies and a generous portion of thinly sliced, well-flavored BBQ pork pieces. I could have eaten just this as my whole entree, but we were sharing, dammit. The philly roll was shockingly good for delivery, and I would totally venture into more exotic sushi selections for our next order. 

The food here isn&#39;t cutting edge or trendy or memorable, but it&#39;s well priced, well portioned, fresh, and they deliver. On some nights, that&#39;s all I need to be happy. I&#39;ll definitely add Jin 28 to the rotation."

I ordered the chicken pad thai, mild, and with no bean sprouts. I didn&#39;t realize &#34;mild&#34; meant &#34;totally flavorless&#34; and that they don&#39;t put any vegetables at all in their pad thai.

The chicken is very bland, as well, and oddly hard to chew... not just dry, it almost tastes like it&#39;s some sort of super-tough chicken breast substitute? It even looks rubbery. 

The noodles are awful - they&#39;re all like 1-2 inches long and totally stuck together. I ate a few clumps and gave up. It&#39;s just gross; neither the lime wedge nor tablespoon of dry, clumpy peanut bits helped at all. The portion size is great, which is a huge shame because it means I&#39;m just wasting a ton of food now.  

The egg drop soup is thin and I think I&#39;m tasting sesame oil in there. It&#39;s not terrible, but I don&#39;t want to finish it. 

The crab rangoon is flat, squishy and tepid. Very oniony, but not awful. I&#39;ll probably finish these since they&#39;re tolerable.

I usually eat at phat noodles (shout out) for spicy fried rice, all the time. However, I decided to try this place upon someone&#39;s request. 

First of, the spicy fried rice are far different from the traditional fried rice that I have had with carrots, peas and other veggies.  At Jin 28, their fried rice had big round jalapeño,  green and red  colored green peppers,  white onion, and basil. The other ingredients that were included were fried egg and crushed pepper and of course white meat boneless chunks of chicken. The chicken was well cooked. I was impressed actually because the basil made it seemed really good with the flavors and for me personally it was not too spicy but still good to eat again.  The rice were good quality not to tiny as in other places. 

The second thing was mini crunchy shrimp rolls. These were eight pieces and the we&#39;re just shrimp inside mini spring roll sheets and nope there were no veggies inside. The shrimps were cooked and lightly flavored, which made them yummy.  If you eat when  they are cold then the shrimp rolls are not too crispy so eat while they are hot.


Lastly, I was served with many sweet and sour sauce and soy sauce plus a fortune cookie.

Orginally, I had planned to order just spicy fried rice but ended up having to order extra because the Jin 28  has a minimum order of takeout of $10.00. However,  there is no regret of ordering the mini shrimp rolls.

So far the first impression of this place for food was good."

The noodles were undersauced and underwhelming. The tofu was ill prepared. It was good enough, but who wants a meal deemed sufficient? 
Perhaps their other items would be better. If I was in town longer I would give it another try!"

Because of this I have ordered from them several times (long trip), and it has always been good.  The sushi rolls were solid, and the nigiri was a show stopper.  I especially enjoyed the scallop nigiri.

I have since moved onto the Thai side of the menu with similar results.  The pad Thai had a really nice and bright tamarind sauce, but it totally lacked heat.  They may have missed that I requested spicy, which isn&#39;t too big of a deal.  The Tom Yum Goong soup is amazing, however.  I really can&#39;t get enough of this.  It, too, could be spicier, but the flavors in that soup are incredible.

Ordered delivery one night- which I must say was an easy process done online and everything was delivered nicely. Unfortunately- the food kinda sucked. Quite possibly the worst pad Thai I have ever had, even worse than the time I attempted to make my own pad Thai when I first started cooking many years ago. We did not eat those leftovers, as we did not eat these leftovers.... The basil beef we ordered had one small piece of basil in it and was smothered with bell peppers. I thought for a second I ordered steak and peppers? I was so confused. Was nothing like the Thai dish that I expected and have had at other places, including freakin Thailand.  Thai red curry was okay, but again, way too many bell peppers in it what in the world?!  The only thing that was pretty good was the sushi we ordered. 

All I wanted that night was good pad Thai and good Thai curry. Very very disappointed. Oh and quite overpriced for the quality!!"

I had beef pho, which was pretty decent. The beef was kind of blah. But the presentation was nice, lots of veggies to go into it and the broth had a great flavor.

But the maki rolls were the best. The only thing I didn&#39;t like about this location was the delivery guy never waited on the person to pick up the order. He&#39;d drive up, give the order to the receptionist and before someone could come out to get the food all you&#39;d see was this guy&#39;s taillights. He did that at least five times. I guess he felt like he got his tip so why bother hanging around. I never went to the actual restaurant. I did call one time to find out what the ingredients were in some item (can&#39;t remember why) and the cashier started screaming about he didn&#39;t know and hung up the phone.

My theory: They use sweet and sour sauce perhaps? Or they don&#39;t know what pad thai is?  Either way, for Asian food to be this restaurant&#39;s &#34;thing,&#34; they are a far cry from that.  

I am not Asian nor a culinary expert, but I can safely say I&#39;d prefer my home cooked Asian food than here.  In fact, I&#39;d rather have a pad thai TV dinner than theirs.   To top it off, their sushi is cheap, which speaks for itself.  You get what you pay for.  

I gave this place a few chances and it was never consistent.  Bad sushi, terrible pad thai, and inconsistent when I ordered their orange chicken (part of it was hot, the center of it was cold).  I tried all three of their cuisine types: Japanese, Thai, and Chinese and all were bad.

They do not mimic our experience at all! The FIL made reservations here for dinner and while I love all Asian food, normally a place that promotes sushi, Thai and Chinese in one spot usually means a jack of all trades and master of none... but not the case!
We were waiting on someone that was running way late, so we went ahead and ordered apps and drinks. The eggrolls were decent, but the Shu Mai were incredible. I contemplated ordering them as part of my meal as well!
For our meals we ordered a hodge podge of sushi and dishes.
The stand out item was definitely the green curry. It was not spicy and very very flavorful and good. Would order this again without question. 
The rolls I picked were the Triple Tuna and the Cherry Blossom. Tuna is my hands down favorite and so I really liked the Triple Tuna, but the Cherry Blossom was nothing remarkable to me. The Mexican roll was good as well with lots of cilantro on top. However, all of the sushi was fresh and delicious, there was nothing that I wouldn&#39;t eat again. I was also very impressed with the unique rolls. Lots of combinations that I have not seen elsewhere, which is what I always look for in a go-to sushi place. Creativity is key to a good sushi chef. Of course, all the standard fare was available as well though. 
Overall, I was very impressed with the place. The service was good and upon hearing that I was getting married in 2 days, they gave me a cute little purse hook that was wrapped with ribbon. A very unexpected, but appreciative gesture. I would definitely return here next time we are in town."

The best sushi was the yellow river. The crunchy roll wasn&#39;t that of a typical &#34;crunchy roll&#34;, meaning it didn&#39;t so much have the crunch as it had toasted panko sprinkled on top...just so so. The Godzilla roll was good although it had pretty much the same flavors as the crunchy so a bit un-memorable. 

The overall experience was good as the food for the price met our expectations, however, there were some glitches... First, I ordered vegetable egg rolls and on the menu it states that it comes with peanut sauce. Okay...peanut sauce is a staple in Thai foods so that combined with the fact that it&#39;s on the menu, you&#39;d think it would come! When it didn&#39;t and I asked our server for some and she said &#34;they don&#39;t have that but that she can bring curry peanut sauce.&#34; Bless her for trying, but I couldn&#39;t help but think what the??? Referring to this same waitress, I really do feel bad because I think the whole strange experience with her was due to a language barrier. My aunt ordered basil fried rice with tofu and vegetables. The waitress didn&#39;t get the vegetables part, but she later took the plate back and said she would quickly cook up and add in vegetables and apologized. My uncle had the panang curry with brown rice. It looked delicious and he said it was so since I didn&#39;t try it let&#39;s assume it was good. 

I liked this place-will come back. Unlike so many Naperville places, this is a small and intimate setting which can be so hard to find. Wish there was outdoor seating but oh well.

I split a roll with one other person, and it was pretty good - a tempura shrimp roll topped with white tuna and spicy mayonnaise. Mild tasting, but pretty good. My entree was Szechuan beef...and this was really missing something. I like the veggie mix - baby corn, bell pepper, and bamboo shoots - and the meat was tender, but it didn&#39;t have something. I don&#39;t know if it needed more...salt? More MSG? Something like that? I dunno. It just wasn&#39;t all that good. 

I would say a 3 or 3.5 for the sushi, and a 2 or 2.5 for the beef - I&#39;ll be generous and say 3 stars overall. I might go back...but I&#39;m still on a half-hearted search for reliably tasty Chinese in the suburbs, so I&#39;d try elsewhere before returning.

I thought little of it until after I received my food in a to go container. I explained that I&#39;d intended to eat inside the restaurant but she refused me. There was a couple there and a family seated as I left. Besides myself and the the groups the place was completely empty with a lot of available seating. I wasn&#39;t inappropriate, rude, or poorly dressed for the atmosphere. I was not welcome either.

It&#39;s a small place that is centrally located in downtown Naperville, but it&#39;s never very busy.  That may be because the service is a bit uneven.  The staff obviously care a great deal but seem to be untrained.  We were seated before a table was cleared and it took quite awhile before dirty plates &amp; silverware were removed.

The sweet &amp; tangy pickled vegies brought before the meal are delicious.  We also liked the sushi special we ordered.

I feel like Jin 28 would do better if it was more of an Asian fusion restaurant with strikingly beautiful, creative, unusual dishes. Instead it feels like they just happen to serve standard Chinese, sushi, and Thai dishes all on the same menu.

When our order of the Old Country Tofu came out, we found that the tofu had gone bad. Thankfully they were quick to replace it with a new one. Flavor was just okay.

At the end of our meal, someone different from our waitstaff thanked us for coming and gave us a $10 gift certificate. He wasn&#39;t very clear about what it was for but we&#39;re assuming it was an apology for the tofu. I appreciated the gesture and it&#39;ll probably cause us to return and give them another chance.

I was impressed that they had a vegetarian dragon roll available, but I found its flavor to be lacking. The maraschino cherries on the top were interesting but I didn&#39;t like the overall taste. (Could be that I&#39;m spoiled from a mind-blowing equivalent I had in Seattle which was also $10.)"

The only reason I found this place was because I downloaded an app called grubhub on my iphone.  It finds all of the local food places around you that deliver.  You look at the menu, order, and pay through the app. 

 So what does Jin28 look like?  I have no idea.  Are they nice on the phone?  Who the hell knows.  What I do know is they have a bomb ass menu and they deliver.  The food was good.  I eat pretty clean and I splurged for an old school favorite General tso&#39;s chicken and a spicy tuna roll.  The chicken was all white meat...no fatty gross grisle chunks.  The sushi was great.  Best of all, my lazy azz just pulled my phone out, blipped a few key strokes and the magic sushi man was at my door in 45 minutes.

If I could find a little bridge that I could live under with a power outlet, I would order all my food delivered there and make the driver&#39;s solve three riddles for ever increasing tip amounts.

btw their prices are very reasonable.  The end"

Not to mention I didn&#39;t have cash on me which is why i paid with a debit card, so I had to go to my car and search for a dollar in coins... That&#39;s bad customer service.

I get it, you live in the suburbs, what do you expect? But come on, I am willing to pay all of the delivery fees for my laziness. Lazy tax! I will pay it!

RARELY do any businesses of any kind deliver for FREE any more, so let&#39;s get on it, &#39;Burbs. More delivery options &#39;cause we&#39;re paying for it anyway.

That said, delivery is pretty much the only reason why we&#39;ve ordered from Jin 28 as much as we have in the past. They deliver. And it&#39;s not pizza.

But all the dishes we&#39;ve tried have been merely &#34;meh.&#34; 

The Pad Thai is passable I guess, if you&#39;ve not had Pad Thai anywhere else ever before. Pot stickers, fried rice, sesame chicken, General Tso&#39;s and all the standards? All of &#39;em, &#34;meh.&#34;

It&#39;s food. That you do not have to cook for yourself and another human will bring to you in exchange for money when you are tired and lazy and in the middle of a Breaking Bad marathon you just can&#39;t tear yourself away from.

Yep. That about covers it.

I&#39;m docking two stars for service and a bit of a pricey menu. The staff was pretty attentive toward the beginning of our meal and sort of slowed down and forgot to give us our check. Or they were too busy trying to close down the restaurant. Either way, it took us forever to leave."

Our server was helpful, my husband enjoyed his Thai dish, I loved the Shiroi Brown roll and the kids got their usual Udon noodles.  

*Update*  I was pleasantly surprised to receive a hand written note and credit for future order after our less than perfect experience last week (described below).  I hadn&#39;t planned to revisit Jin 28 but I keep thinking about the hot and sour soup and after such great service recovery, I&#39;ll consider it again.  You should too!

***SLOW DELIVERY***
So I wasn&#39;t wild about Jin 28 when we dined in but when faced with requests for sushi, Pad Thai and fortune cookies by my family members, I thought I&#39;d give it a shot.  I ordered online - pretty straightforward tool.  Received confirming email saying delivery would be 1 hour.  After 75 minutes, I called to confirm the systems were working properly and was told another 20-25 minutes.  In total, our food took 2 hours.

Beyond irritation with the delay, I had requested plain udon noodles in the notes as there wasn&#39;t a way to order them.  They were not included in my bill or with my food.  

The diverse menu is a plus.  The hot and sour soup was above average and a nice thickness (not slimy like it can be some places).  The egg drop soup was also very nice.  We enjoyed the flavor of the noodle dish though the noodles themselves were a bit doughy.  The sushi rolls were just okay - the Mexican was not spicy, the philly roll very thin. 

I love the one-stop-Asia-shop concept, the execution just isn&#39;t there..."

The menu makes it a challenge to decide what to order. It always helps going with a group of friends so we can sample each others&#39; dishes.

Recommended:
- Shrimp and crawfish fondeaux for an appetizer
- Baked crab mac and cheese
- Stuffed shrimp (very huge and filled with crab meat!)
- Shrimp creole and grits 

For dessert, the server brings out a tray to show what desserts are available, which makes it very very hard to decide!  They are big enough to split. The creme brulee and the praline bread pudding have been my favorites.

Pretty decent menu.  Started off with some calamari and alligator.  LOVED the deep fried alligator  (It tasted like chicken tenders).  Breaded and seasoned nicely with some really good sauce.  The calamari was not...it had pieces that were good and then these pieces that were soggy and tasted like breaded sardines.  The marinara sauce had a weird fishy taste to it.

The fried catfish and shrimp is my favorite...except when I&#39;m dieting since I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a 4000+ calorie meal given it comes with french fries! So, this time, I ordered the cedar plank salmon which came with asparagus. A much more healthy option and delicious. Unfortunately, I had to get a desert-the banana pudding, my favorite! Now, I will say it&#39;s a bit on the expensive side in my opinion. For my strawberry lemonade, side Caesar salad, salmon, and banana pudding, the bill was almost $50.

After driving by for year, my family decided to go for my dad&#39;s birthday last weekend. They don&#39;t take reservations on the weekends but my mom was told when she called that they take call ahead. They don&#39;t. We tried and they said you just have to come in so we got there around 5 and it was a 35 minute wait for 4 people. 

It was extremely crowded and very loud. We were wary to be honest. After about a half hour, we were seated near the Windows. Our server was friendly but seemed very busy. We started with the calamari, but I don&#39;t eat it so I can&#39;t comment. My parents split the Greek salad and it looked good and I enjoyed the wedge I ordered. Bread was warm and delicious. 

For entrees, my dad had the cedar plank salmon, my brother had the medium fried shrimp entree, my mom had the halibut special and I had the plain halibut. Everyone enjoyed their food, I think next time I would ask for mine to be blackened and maybe add some capers or something. Dessert was pretty good, they have a lot of options and everyone got something different. I know it&#39;s all fresh seafood but it also was a little pricy for some of the menu items. 

I took stars off for the dirty bathrooms, the loud and crowded atmosphere and the no reservation policy. If someone else wanted to eat there I would go back, but I wouldn&#39;t suggest it myself."

For us it took about an hour. Pretty good seafood for the area, but they are heavy with the salt (specifically their soft shell crab, and the shrimp on my halibut dish, which was otherwise good). I actually liked the dirty rice that came with the crab even more than the crab. I also found their Gulf oysters to be creamy yet pretty bland. Maybe it&#39;s due to the June season? The bartenders are friendly, and will dole out water, iced tea, or sodas for free while you wait."

You may want to make reservation. It&#39;s the midwestern access to Southern or New Orleans cuisine....or seafood in general that&#39;s not just Red Lobster. Service was a bit slow but it was very busy. 

Foodwise, the portions are fairly large enough to be shared. we enjoyed the trio sampler to start. I tried the redfish on the had shell and frankly, I didn&#39;t like the texture/taste of the fish, shrimp and the scallop that it came with. It didnt tast very fresh maybe. The boy had the classic alexander mahi mahi dish which was pretty good. the dirty rice was sooo tasty. Maybe I just dont like redfish.  

Dessert - The bread pudding can be shared by 4 and very hot. It was more pudding than bread but it&#39;s not a bad choice."

I lost count of how many times I have been to this place for lunch dinner or just beer and oysters. 

You cannot beat the lunch specials and happy hour they are fantastic. 

During the year they run specials. I waited a bit but my and my uncle got a seat on 2.99 dozen of oysters night. We ate 6 dozens we had oysters coming out of our ears. 

I love their dirty rice and their Diablo sauce on any piece of fish. One time I had lobster and it was fantastic. It can get super crowded so be patient."

From time of arrival I had prepared myself for a wait. The parking lot gave me a picture perfect view of what we were walking into. We had a party of 25 and everyone arrived on time 6pm. By 6:45 we were seated. I didn&#39;t enjoy the both style seating with such a large group. It is a pain scooting in and out for people exits and bathroom breaks. 

Our server came to the table quickly to introduce himself and others that would be attending to us.
He worked his way across one side of the table then the next for drinks and appetizers. We waited close to an hour for the appetizers and only one side of the table received their drink orders. The other side drinks did not come to almost 30 minutes later right before our meals, along with the lemon for my water I had asked for over 5 times. When it came, they brought 3 bowls full. Everyone enjoyed their&#39;s except for one person in the party that had a watermelon mule. I was disappointed with my large order of calamari. It was cold when it arrived at the table. I barely touched it and decided to enjoy my salad instead which was perfect. 
Shortly thereafter our meals arrived. I ordered the sampler platter with the catfish. The plate was filled to its capacity ( A+) everything was delicious except for my catfish. It was over fried. Someone ordered the Pappadeaux Platter and it looked like a feast for for four. Everyone enjoyed their meals. There were many to go boxes on the table! Yet, when the dessert platter was presented before us everyone ordered. Everything on there was ordered between the group. I myself ordered the banana pudding to go. I loved the little mason jar it was placed in. I&#39;m sitting now waiting for my bill as I finish my review. 

Overall, I cannot say if I would attend again considering the service we reviewed, especially for the price of my meal. Cold food and poor service is not acceptable. I understand large crowds can slow things down but a restaurant of this magnitude should very well understand its business and to staff their establishment accordingly. They have a good thing going and with a few adjustments could be great. I would then give five stars. 

One more note before I go. One of the guests in our party asked if they honored military and he was told no and the smell of the ladies bathroom was repulsive. I was told the men&#39;s bathroom wasn&#39;t any better."

The lighting, decor, and food is definitely appealing and provides an atmosphere that made me feel like I was some place more exciting than Westmont.  This was my first visit to a Papadeaux and I left impressed and ready to return.  I ordered the &#34;mixed seafood grill&#34; which includes two skewers of fish e.g. salmon and vegetables.  As somebody who strives to eat clean and lean, I happily enjoyed this and a salad with some extra grill shrimp.

In addition to the tasty food, the service was spot on.  Before I could finish my drink, the waiter would have another one ready to replace it.  Needless to say, I will gladly to return to this delightful spot and look out for it if I am ever back in Dallas or Houston or just want some good seafood/dining experience out in Westmont."

Now the food is always good so therefore, I am rating it a solid 3, but the overall environment in my opinion has gone down.  This used to be a place I would want to go on a date to, now, I barely want to go at all let alone think I will experience a romantic atmosphere.  

The last few times i have gone the food came out waaaaaaaay to late or not correct.  

I will return because i do adore the place but they need to do something in the realm of marketing, staff training, and overall hiring!

Here is why:It was around 8pm on a Sunday night and the restaurant was PACKED. I mean, literally, packed and you couldn&#39;t see an empty table if you tried. We were a party of five and we were seated near the windows. As the night progressed, we realized it was very cold and started to put our coats on. Every time we wanted to mention it to the waiter, we would wait but then forget as it was just that busy. Another family seated near us was saying how cold it was as well. At the end of our meal, we noticed Maria K the manager talking to the other family. We then added our two cents. After she finished with the other family, she came to us. She was not aware of the problem but later found out that another manager or employee had heard that people complained about these particular tables. SHe was very apologetic, very personable, and very kind. She discounted the meal and still had a smile on her face. We were very grateful. She was very honest and that is what we respected about her. Next time we will do as she advised and tell her BEFORE it gets too bad. 

The food was amazing. My family devoured the mussels. They didn&#39;t have straight mussels on the menu (the one on the menu comes with chorizo). But we asked that they make just straight mussels. My family said it was awesome. I don&#39;t eat mussels so I really couldn&#39;t comment but they loved it so much they were drinking the soup at the bottom of the pot. 

Calamari was a good 3 stars. My lobster was awesome. I did not care for the sides nor did I finish them. Others had the fried shrimp and they loved it but the large is HUGE so be aware. You can order small, medium, large. My brother didn&#39;t care for his dish and I am not truly sure what it was. 

The service is what sold me about this location. We had been to the other pappadeaux in Schaumburg/North suburbs before it closed down (it had a buffet too) but this location is definitely a whole lot better when it comes to service. Thank you Maria K for making our visit awesome and for taking the time to listen to us."

The halibut was perfectly seared with the macadamia nuts. Added a great flavor. The broccolini was a little drenched in butter but not too bad. A very light meal altogether. 

A must try is the new crab Mac n cheese. This was rich but I thought it was suitable for one person. So good. The lobster caprese is eh not worth the money for the amount of lobster. And too many onion.  I want to try the salmon and octopus. Sounds outstanding."

It&#39;s like going to a club at this joint .... damn...

This was at 8pm lol

Service at the bar was outstanding though.... Gabe our bartender, was very professional, and on point with the draaaaanks.... Woooot wooot...

I ordered two large swampthangs... My BF ordered a Manhattan, some daiquiri and beer...

We ordered Mediterranean calamari... Way better than the traditional calamari coz it has a lil kick... 

We ordered a bowl of seafood gumbo, we ordered Shrimp and scallop pasta and redfish Pontchartrain....

Never have had a bad meal. Our server was so DOPE. Kady/Katy (it was loud and I didn&#39;t wanna keep asking her Kady or Katy? Lol). There&#39;s another server who is really bomb too. I didn&#39;t see her yesterday (they come and go) but her name is like Leelay or Laylee. Very attentive. When servers are like that I forget they&#39;re at work and I wanna be like &#34;pull up a chair and have dinner with us&#34;. So damn friendly these two. Anyway, we both wanted to try s&#39;thing other than the seafood platter/Pappadeaux platter so she (Kady/Katy) explained in mass detail how all the food we were interested in trying is prepared (damn! Do they go to sous chef classes first???). Anywho, the red snapper and butternut risotto was DELICIOUS. I woke up today like  I have leftovers!!!

The restaurant was rather empty and most patrons were seated in the bar to catch the ending minutes of the Stanley Cup final in which the Blackhawks won. 

For two of us, we had the appetizer trio, crawfish etouffee, and Cape Cod Bay mussels. The trio consisted of mini shrimp and crawfish fondeaux, fried alligator, and hot smoked salmon. The fondeaux was hot and creamy. We dunked several thick slices of bread into that steamy bowl and there were still plenty of leftovers. The size of one piece of fried alligator was similar to popcorn shrimp. It was crispy and juicy. The Atlantic salmon was medium well and prepared with a creamy maple mustard sauce. It had a slight spice but the meat was exceptionally tender. 

The crawfish etouffee came with dirty rice that consisted of chicken, pork, and chives. The crawfish is deshelled and cooked in a thick brown sauce with tomatoes. It was well seasoned and extremely flavorful. I would definitely repeat this dish on my second visit. The Cape Cod Bay mussels came in a huge pot filled with thick slices of adouille sausage. The contents were drowned in a white wine sauce made with lemon garlic butter. The mussels were fresh and fatty. It was refreshing and well marinated, but my attention was drawn by the broccolini prepared with butter broth. The greens were so crisp with notes of broccoli and asparagus. I could have easily finished the side by myself if I didn&#39;t have to share. 

Prices are a little high with this Creole eatery but the service was exceptional. I will eventually return when I am in the area again or if there is a certain event to celebrate."

We got there early, so we had no problem getting a seat, however, later it was packed (on a weekday!). Needless to say, you may want to make a reservation, It was holiday time, but you never know.

The drinks are definitely pricey for the suburbs, so that wasn&#39;t a perk. However, the food is great. A little salty, but overall really good. It&#39;s hard to find Cajun/Creole restaurants in this area. They have a variety of different dishes to choose from, most of it being seafood. For the price, the value is great. I ordered a dish that had shrimp, a nice portion of Mahi fish, scallops, and crawfish. The sauce was so good, just right amount of spice. I also love the dirty rice.

Our waiter was really nice and honest. When we asked his opinion of certain dishes, he gave us his honest opinion. It was busy so towards the end so he wasn&#39;t around as much. But overall service was good.

I was disappointed in my meal, don&#39;t remember what I ordered (some fried fish), but everyone else&#39;s meal looked so much better. I think I just ordered the wrong thing. It came with a side of fries, which was probably my first mistake. The other dishes with rice and all looked much better.  I had the cheese oysters which were good, a bit too cheesy though...nowhere near NOLA style. I liked that they had the jazz band playing live going around to the tables. That was entertaining and I felt I was right back in NOLA. 

Prices are up there, I think I just ordered the wrong dish. Will try again one day, just don&#39;t want to spend all that money again so soon."

They offer a super decent kids menu, including grilled chicken and rice and also several fried fish and seafood choices. Our under 8 bunch was satisfied with the selection. 
I had the lobster bisque, which was amazing as other reviewers have stated. I also chose a house salad, which was really fresh. Props to the waiter for letting me know their French dressing had blue cheese in it. It was tasty, but may have bugged me if I didn&#39;t know.
My husband had a massive serving of seafood kabobs that were also delicious. He had a hard time finishing it, but was determined to be in the clean plate club!
We skipped dessert as we were so stuffed, but the tray of yummy was sitting right next to us and was hard to pass up!

We each grabbed enough to get a taste and hold down the hunger.

FOOD - Appetizer to our main meal (in which we all ordered something different, all looked delicious and we all agreed tasted how it looked). We also ordered a treat at the end. I ordered the Mardi Gra&#39;s special cheesecake. It was a huge piece and tasted great! The amount of food i my plate was filling, im a big eater and was able to eat it all, but i feel for many it could be too much. I also enjoyed the food presentation. 

DECOR/ATMOSPHERE - My favorite! Dim lights! The amount of people there, the place was kept up nice and clean. Down south style especially the night we went, made me feel like i was somewhere in Louisiana. 

$$$ - Pricing was about average for seafood. And i felt i got my money worth with food. 

STAFF/SERVICE - There was plenty of staff around which is great! There was plenty of bartenders as well and all were nice and polite and attentive. Our server did a well job not keeping us waiting long in any case and helpful to ask if we had been there and helping us through our first time."

The alligator appetizer is a must get!! The food is seasoned to perfection and its fresh! It&#39;s pricey, but well worth it. I tried their signature drink and it did not disappoint. I like how they are full of variety. They have fresh cold options, fried options, and sauté options. I would recommend this place to anyone! 

They give free dessert of your choice if it&#39;s your birthday! The key lime pie is delicious!

Con: I tried the salmon appetizer and it wasn&#39;t that good. I can see where the chef was trying to go with the sauce, but I think it should be off the menu all together."

Lobster Bisque is the best.  About a half lobster tail&#39;s worth of lobster in the bisque.  Flavor is beyond words.

Fried seafood platter is my thing and there&#39;s a wide selection of many different fried seafood platters.  Pure heaven.  All of it is fantastic.

Highly recommended!"

Have been here many time for the happy hours and for the Oysters. You could expect more stronger floavered food if you order spicy shimp, dirty rice, or even the alligator nuggets. I think those are overly salty for me but some of my friends just love them. 

During March to May, we just go for a dozen of Oyster and a few pounds of crawfish boil. Then a mojito or Purple Voodoo and share a dessert which usually fairly big portion. Take  you time to eat up the food and chat along the way.

Services are friendly and quick. It has been always crowded so all the waist stuff are almost running around to get everyone servied. So remember to stop them to ask what you want. They usually come back very quickly.

Enjoy!"

There&#39;s quite a bit of options on the menu and they have a decent lunch menu too. I really wanted to try the fried alligator as I&#39;ve never had it before. I didn&#39;t know what to expect. It had a taste somewhere in between of a catfish nugget and a chicken nugget. It wasn&#39;t bad at all. Glad I tried it!
For my entree I had the lobster and shrimp salad. It had big pieces of sliced mango and avocado. Yum!  This was a tasty salad."

Everyone enjoyed the entrees which included the halibut, sea bass, salmon, catfish, redfish, shrimp and a few others.  The portions are quite large and with having the earlier appetizers, we were all too full for dessert.

The atmosphere was fun and the staff was great.  We were lucky enough to go at a time where they were accepting reservations and that was nice.  Wish they could offer that at other times too.  The patio is a great place to hang out.

We highly recommend the spring rolls. Red beans and rice with generous andouille slices, reliably good. Crab Mac n cheez was rich, cheesy, and very satisfying.

I&#39;ve been here 4-5 times and it never disappoints (although I typically stick to the same order). 

Tonight, we started off with the Shrimp and Crawfish Fondeaux, which is absolutely delicious and perfect on the garlic bread it is served with. I ordered the Atlantic Salmon Yvette, which is what I usually order because it is delicious, HUGE and is consistently my favorite! My mother&#39;s go-to order is the Jumbo Shrimp Brochette, which is jumbo shrimp stuffed with cheese and jalapeño and wrapped in bacon... Enough said! 

Dessert consisted of the Key Lime Pie and Turtle Cheesecake. Both ok, Key Lime Pie is better, but I would recommend just eating more of your main course than saving room for dessert.

So yah, not from these parts but when I fly in for some meetings, Pappadeaux is on the short list of favorites. The menu is absolutely amazing. There is just a ton a great choices on there that can get you some of the best seafood that I have ever had here. I normally go with the Blackened fish but this time I had the crawfish Etouffe by recommendation and am very glad I did. If you go with the platter for $4 more it comes with a huge portion of fried crawfish with some dips. I found the fried version very light and crispy with a great soft but chewy texture. The Etouffe (which I know I am spelling wrong but am unsure how to spell this amazing find) is basically simmered crawfish in a light gravy. Served with rice, this is a true find. 

If you are really hungry, give the calamari a try. They are lightly battered in a seasoned coating. I believe they are soaked in buttermilk or something since they are chewy and have a ton of flavor. Some of the best I have ever had. 
Overall, great place to have a nice dinner and even better for a business dinner. Recommended"

It&#39;s probably never happened, because no place can possibly be that good.  Last night I finally crossed that wait off my bucket list- my girlfriend demanded we come here and wait, and seeing it was her birthday I felt necessary to accommodate her wishes.  This place is good, but I sure as heck would never wait 2 hours again to eat here.  It&#39;s good, solid food, good service, and a great bar, but no reservations and high prices mean this place is only for someone else&#39;s special day :)

They have a huge bar, and they seem to specialize in big, fruity, tropical drinks.  I stuck to bourbon, my GF had a Cosmopolitan. Our bartender was cool enough, and the people watching made the time pass fast. We ended up ordering a plate of oysters Pappadeaux for an appetizer while we waited.  They were pretty good, not amazing, but definitely good.

By the time we got a table after 2 hours, our server was awesome- I think her name was Alexis??  She got our orders in quick, had some good suggestions, and kept the drinks flowing.  I ordered redfish, my GF had salmon.  Both were really good, but honestly, the bill was like $150. We had an appetizer and a few drinks at the table, too, but if you factor in the bar bill before we sat down, this was close to $200.  

Between the cost and the wait, I don&#39;t think this place is that awesome.  Don&#39;t get me wrong- the food is really good, the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is circus-like, but I&#39;d be hard-pressed to come back here given the wait time and prices."

There are no other business surrounding it so the parking lot is very spacious. My friend and I went here for lunch on a Saturday and it was pretty packed already. I think if you go for dinner, there will definitely be a wait unless you make a reservation or beat the crowd. 

I went here specifically for the alligator meat! The waiter said it tastes like popcorn chicken except it is a little bit more chewy and that is exactly the description I would give, too. The alligator meat medium size is enough to share between 2-3 people. It also comes with shoestring fries and a house special dipping sauce.

I also tried the jambalaya but it wasn&#39;t anything special so I would skip this. My friend and I also shared the seafood grilled platter and it came with dirty rice and a skewer of assorted seafood and veggies.

We made reservations at 6:30, checked in at the door just before 6:30 and they said they&#39;d text us when the table was ready. It was probably 6:45 by the time I walked up to check with the host. We were sitting right in front of them but we never received a text, so their system may not have been working. Regardless, hosts were very nice and apologetic and sat us quickly. 

Service was a bit slower, but our server was very friendly and knowledgable and we understood that she seemed to be running quite a few tables so it really wasn&#39;t a problem at all. We also made Pappadeaux our only plans for the night, so we weren&#39;t in any rush. 

I must point out- this is the second time I&#39;ve been to this location and both times, the servers have been out of this world. They&#39;ve been extremely friendly, professional and knowledgable. I would not hesitate to return. 

For dinner, we enjoyed blue point oysters (we ordered a half-dozen, but the kitchen made us a dozen on accident- happy mistake!), fried crab, a 3 lb. Maine lobster, a bit of beer and wine and for dessert- the creme brûlée! 

Everything was fresh and delicious. Also, our server had our dessert taken off the check since service was slow and our bar drinks often took a bit of time to reach us. It was very nice and thoughtful of her.

Another couple we met suggested we get there early, so we met at 4:30 and were immediately seated, but literally 10 minutes later the waiting line was out the door. 

The food is very good and we shared appetizers with the other 2 couples.

We hadn&#39;t been to Pappadeaux in nearly a year. We love the New Orleans flavor angle. The dirty rice goes well with just about everything. They let us order off the lunch menu, which was plenty of food sharing appetizers and each getting a salad. (The wedge with blue cheese, bacon and tomatoes is fantastic) My wife&#39;s side salad was only $2.50 more.

There are good options for non-seafood eaters. 

We thought the service was very slow. Faster service would turn more tables. Live band was great but it contributed to a pretty loud noise level.  We all decided to find a quieter place for our next meal together. We&#39;ll go back, hopefully sooner than the last time!"

I have frequented the locations in Texas. The quality and service here is just as good as the southern locations. Vito was our server on this most recent visit and he was a joy. It was my mother&#39;s first time at any Pappadieux location and it did not disappoint. The restaurant offers fresh fish in a Cajun style. I had the red fish with crab and lemon butter sauce.  My mom had a Mahi with some yummy topping. We had dirty Rice and spaghetti squash. We also had the fried alligator just for kicks and giggles. This place has great drinks. We both had more than enough leftovers for a second helping at home. If you go on a weekend be prepared to wait but it is well worth it.

Greek salad was delicious and very unique. A great place to start. Only comes with 2 shrimp even though it&#39;s for 4. Good amount of ingredients other wise: green peppers, chives, capers, pepperioccini, tomato. Really lovely salad.

Calamari: cooked just right -not chewy. Nice sauces. Has fried artichoke leaves too.

Clam chowder: really good. Has bacon but bacon doesn&#39;t over power the clams. I&#39;d like to say it&#39;s amazing but I have this thing against bacon in chowder. It&#39;s s pet peeve but this was a very solid contender for best chowder ever. 

Oysters on the half shell: they were the ones that come with the shrimp. It was an app that came with a half dozen oysters and shrimp so I&#39;m pretty sure they were the golf oysters and not the blue point. They were perfect! Yay pappadeux! Big and juicy, lots of lemon, mingoinet was nice (werchester sauce flavor plus onion and vinegar), and customizable cocktail sauce. This oyster experience was a 9.8 for me. They came with a little bit of the oyster juice and the meat was separated from the shell. Only reason it&#39;s not a perfect 10 is bc I prefer a brinier oyster and I play favorites which makes being a 10 nearly impossible.  

Drinks:
Texas rose: cucumber, basil, sweet, martini style, pink -girly but grown up
Frenchman street spritz: refreshing and fruity

Service was spot on. No complaints at all -she was laid back, polite, and efficient. Not as chatty as others but I personally like that. 

All star work here. Can&#39;t wait to go back."

If you want to have a meal that will blow you away, start with the shrimp and crawfish fondue! 

The atmosphere is fun and relaxing, especial when they have the love music that will play tableside. A very colorful dining experience for sure.

We got one of the appetizer combos and liked some of the things and didn&#39;t like others.

The feijoada Was very bland and seemed like it was few days old. The rice was not prepared as a Brazilian rice should be properly prepared. Tasted more like minute rice.  The chicken in the coxinha tasted like it came out of a can, a can of cat food.  The only thing that was a saving grace was the mini coxinhas which were tasty. There are not many Brazilian restaurant out there, and even less that are not the big steak houses. Hopefully they can turn themselves around.

They were very generous with the slices for $5.  They even plated the pie and drizzled cream on top for a beautiful presentation.  This key lime pie was sweet but missing the tart of a traditional pie, but I still enjoyed it very much.  The texture was thick pudding and very creamy. 

It was late on a Tuesday night and there were no other customers in the restaurant.  I thought it was cool that they had motorcycle racing on TV.  I&#39;ll have to come back sometime and try their main menu.

Free street parking on New York can be easy to come by, but if not then there&#39;s the casino parking lot on Rivers to park in."

Very interesting, learning Portuguese language. The pictures were really helpful, easy for me to decide what to order :)

Very nice and colorful decorated restaurant with their traditional touch of Brazilian. Didn&#39;t expect to see this in the heart of Arora. It&#39;s a small restaurant so only one server was there. He did an excellent job gave us the best service. He was so sweet and friendly, very knowledgeable about Brazilian food but he is from mexico :)

Our party of 3, ordered a few different kinds of drink to start. Mom ordered a Brazilian beer called &#34;Palma Louca&#34; $4.50 and it was very good. it&#39;s a light beer so I loved that. I had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc from South Africa/2013 $7.59 and the last drink was my favorite &#34;Caipirinha&#34; $9.99 this  drink was so delicious and refreshing with their fresh ingredients : Alcohol from sugar cane ( cachaga) mixed with a lot of lime, sugar and Ice.

We all enjoyed the food. We had limited time before the show at the Paramount theater so we didn&#39;t order appetizer or dessert but only the main course was perfect for us.
I loved my dish &#34;Beef Stroganoff&#34; sweet curry sauce with tender beef worked well together, a crunchy taro fries and white rice completed this dish beautifully. 

If you would like to experience some Brazilian culture and have a great authentic Brazilian food, please check out U Samba? Cafe. This place won&#39;t disappoint you. Enjoy!"

The table service was good. The food was good, but something was missing that I recalled in the food I had in São Paulo, in Recife, at Taste of Brasil in Oak Park, and at Brasil Legal in Chicago proper. It was weird that the cook made rounds at all the tables, except mine. Big determining factor for whether I would blog about U Samba.

The chicken in the coxhina frango was flavourful yet had a creamy texture. The same was the case with the empada. Although I ordered the empada with cheese, it came with chicken. I really liked the empada, though. The pastel with chicken was my favourite snack. I ordered the estraganofe frango (chicken stroganoff) and got estraganofe carne (beef stroganoff) instead. Rather than show out, I ate all of it and it was surprisingly tasty.

If you&#39;re out near Aurora and want to try some Brazilian cuisine, U Samba may be the spot for you. Nice experience, but Aurora feels too &#34;Deep South&#34; for me to return."

The rest were honestly not that flavorful and interesting. Ordered the chicken stroganoff. The sauce had decent flavor, but the chicken was tough, dry, &amp; overdone! Ugh. My other party ordered the Bife a rolé (steak rolls). The sauce on top was sparing and sadly the only flavorful thing on the plate. I understand Brazilian food isn&#39;t spiced like Asian cuisine, but there&#39;s an important distinction between good, subtle flavors vs. mild, bland ones. The food was overwhelmingly on the bland side, and table spices aren&#39;t enough to cut through it. Customers shouldn&#39;t be required to add on hot-hotter peppers to make everything taste better. Dishes are supposed to be flavorful as-is. They&#39;re not. 
After 1 beer, 1 juice, 1 app (10 tiny flavorless balls for $10.99) &amp; 2 dishes, the total was over $63. Not in a hurry to pay that much for consistently under-seasoned food."

I love yucca so this were a guaranteed good thing. They come with bacon. Then we moved on to the feijoada--black bean, three meat stew. If there were enough room in my stomach I would have been finished every bit. They came with collard greens and rice. As if that weren&#39;t enough--we ordered coffee and what I call flan. It was so creamy and we savored every bite. The coffee was REALLY strong, but that&#39;s what I was hoping for.

Great place to hang with friends or family. It serves typical Brazilian family-favorite dishes, differently from the large and popular Brazilian steakhouses around Chicagoland. I strongly recommend the place for a better taste of Brazilian most traditional dishes. 

We tried the &#39;coxinha, empanada and bolinho de bacalhau&#39; appetizers (chicken, beef and fish salty fried pastries respectively) and they&#39;re very good. Kids also enjoyed having them. For the main entrée we had the Full Size &#39;Feijoada&#39; (stew of beans with pork) which comes served with white rice, colorful bell pepper vinaigrette, sort of green collard with bacon salad and farofa (toasted flour) on the side.

It&#39;s great for families and also for a grown-ups&#39; evening out. Every time we&#39;ve eaten here, the food and service have been outstanding. 

If you go on the weekends, order the feijoada (black bean stew) - it&#39;s unbelievably good. The collard greens are so perfect. You also can&#39;t go wrong with any of the appetizers. The sampler gives you a taste of some of their more popular appetizers so that you know which ones are your favorites on your next visit (spoiler alert: the ham &amp; cheese churros. Oh my goodness). On their cocktail menu, I&#39;ve only tried the caipirinha - it&#39;s delightful. 

If you are stopping for dinner before a Paramount show, make a reservation and leave plenty of time - when things get busy, the food can take awhile. It&#39;s worth the wait!"

We were greeted right away and sat quickly. Our server was a delight, answering all of our questions we had since Brazilian food was not something we had tried before. We ordered an appetizer of mini coxinhas, two small orders actually, one savory and one sweet. The bacon and cheese came out first and was amazing. I vowed that even if I didn&#39;t like anything else I would return for these. The second was a mix of cheese and a derivative of guava, not two flavors I would normally pair together, but to my surprise they worked so well that I found myself a little sad when the cup the were served in was empty. The main meals (a stuffed gnocchi dish for me and the Steak rolls for my husband) were filling and delicious. I opted to finish the meal with a slice of prestigio cake. Please do yourself a favor and get this cake! It&#39;s chocolate with small amount of coconut center. My only downside was that it took me so long to try them. We already know we will be back in the future."

Small place, but clean and appealing. Service was attentive and friendly. Ordered beef rolls. Came with fries, rice and beans. I can do without fries. Would rather beans and rice be seasoned and mixed together as they were kind of plain for our tastes. Husband got the special, beef, carrot and onion mixture. His was sort of plain as well and seemed to have been cooked earlier. He felt the same about the fries. My salad was the out of the bag kind....very ordinary with out of the box croutons. Really, i can pass on that! We really wanted to love this place, but...just missed the mark for us. There is just too much competition out there in the restaurant market to be so-so."

The only suggestions that I would have for improvement is that being Brazilian myself, I expected the salad to be served on the same plate as my dinner (I&#39;m being picky)  and that the fries would be like my grandmother made them, freshly cut and pan fried. I also would&#39;ve loved to hear more recent popular music from Brazil and not the standard Brazilian songs that you hear whenever you go somewhere &#34;Brazilian&#34; in the U.S. I guess it&#39;s because I crave the Brazilian connection. The experience itself was like being home again, though, I left the restaurant feeling as if I had gone to visit someone&#39;s house. Everyone there was so friendly, that we were even having conversations with other tables.

Will definitely go back there again to try the feijoada and bring my whole family!"

The ambiance makes you feel very cozily nestled in a small cafe in São Paulo or Rio. We started with Cheese Bread and Fried Polenta. The Cheese Bread was light, but not very exciting. The Polenta was nice and crisp and tasty. For entrees we ordered the Beef Steak with Onions (Bife Acebolado) and the Shrimp Bobo (Bobo de Camarao)  Both were excellent and nicely presented. We finished off with Prestigio Cake ( Chocolate Coconut) and Passion Fruit Mousse, as well as chocolate and coconut Bon-bons. All were great!  We had Guarana Antarcticas to drink to top it all off. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive and the chef/owner came around and asked about our meal (thankfully one of us spoke Portuguese!!). Great night that brought back sweet memories of Brazil.

Gnocchi was soft and delicious
The rolled steak was flavorful and the sauce was delicious 
The sangria was strong and flavorful
The special naranha drink was delicious
The server was friendly and helpful  
The placemats are colorful
The hats the servers wear are perfect for the concept
Collard greens were very tasty

What I disliked:
The door opens directly to the small dining room- freezing out everyone 
The motion detector light at the front   
Kept flashing on and off
The dinner napkins are small and speak loudly to very cheap and not functional.
The salad is ugly lettuce and supermarket croutons. The dressing is served on the side in the smallest ramekin I have ever seen- half ounce?
 No specialty dressing? Like a brazilian?
No just stuff like casear, ranch, blue cheese. 
The appetizer sampler was just edible
Twice the manager tried to deliver
food to the wrong table

Summary:
Convenient to the paramount theater
Hoped for specialty brazilian- found 
Mediocre concept confusion.
Tried it.
Won&#39;t be back"

The place was decorated appropriately. Some of the table items were cheap, but I get that.  Invest in the food.  WE came for the food.  Lots of listed appetizers. Unfortunately, one of the traditional items (pao de queijo pequeno) , they are out of.  It&#39;s cheese bread. How are you out of cheese bread?  Ok.. fine. We got the kibe and coxinhas (beef and chicken stuffed croquettes). They came with a side of chopped peppers in vinaigrette. The only thing that helped them from being a bland lump of fried dough were the peppers.  The two most interesting looking entrees are only offered on the weekends, so we choose the bife a role (steak roll with carrot and bacon) and the breaded fish.  Everything came with a pile of plain white rice, a bowl of bland beans, unseasoned fries, and a salad (iceberg lettuce with a few tomato pieces) 
It was all so very bland. No spark at all. So much looked like cutting corners. Everything was edible. It was ok.  But we won&#39;t be going back.
A brand new restaurant that felt like it was the last week open.
$35 was a high price for what we got."

They have many small appetizers that are very good, you could easily just eat a dozen of them and call it a meal.  I&#39;ve been there twice now - 1st time for the Friday &amp; Weekend Special Feijoado which was very good, I especially liked the pepper/vinegar salsa that comes with it.  2nd time I had the unstuffed gnocchi, also very good but a little disappointing that it doesn&#39;t come with anything besides gnocchi (like bread or side salad).  
I think a lunch menu would be a welcome addition.  Still new so only a dinner menu - which means dinner prices at lunch hours.  Also, wine or booze of any type would be good.  A frosty brew with Feijoado would fit right in."

My only knowledge of Brazilian cuisine is  the Brazilian steak house where you feast on meat after meat after roasted meat.  U Samba cafe explores southern Brazilian cuisine with luxurious sauces, melt in your mouth stuffed gnocchi with Italian roots and black bean and pork stew, only available on weekends, with a rich and complex sauce.  The owners are eager to share their cultural knowledge of what they cook and are helpful in navigating the menu.  Definitely save room for dessert. The flan slowly dissolves in your mouth in a creamy stream and the lemon pie is creamy and just a little tart to accentuate the citrus flavor. We will return to try other menu items in the near future."

u-samba-cafe-aurora-6,Daniel C.,VZxrIigWJ80T1pg-SKhu3A,"Batavia, IL",0,1,0,27,11,B0QvSQNDceGhh9ztagDq-g,4.0,2015-03-30,"So happy to see a new restaurant open up in this location!!  I was very sad to see the Comfort Zone close down, so this will help us get over their loss.  

First off, if you are thinking this will be similar to Mexican food, or those weird Brazilian steak on a stick places, you are in the wrong place.  U Samba has very traditional Brazilian dishes, and a very cozy, family feeling, probably because it is staffed with the chef&#39;s family members!  This cuisine leans on the side of comfort food.

My wife and I were celebrating my birthday and decided to go with 3 of our friends, and we were able to try a few more things that way.  We started with some appetizers: risole (kind of like a steamed bun with ground beef, but lightly fried), coxinha (similar to the risole, but with shredded and seasoned chicken, almost like a dumpling filled with chicken soup flavor!), and yucca fries with bacon.  All of them were terrific and got our mouths watering.  

Once again, if you are thinking really powerful or spicy flavors, this is not that.  This is more like comfort food.  

For the entree my wife and I split one of their weekend specials, the Feijoado (Brazilian Black Bean Stew with 4 different meats). If you&#39;ve ever had a french cassoulet with duck confit, it&#39;s kind of like that, but with different kinds of pork, instead.  It&#39;s a rich blend of black beans, black sausage, pork, and seasonings, served with white rice to pour it over, a lovely and refreshing &#34;vinegrette&#34; that was more like a dice of veggies in vinegar, which helped cut through the richness, and a side of a chiffonade of collard greens lightly sauteed with bacon, and a bowl of powdered seasoning with bacon bits to sprinkle over the dish (which we ended up putting on everything, using it like bacon fairy dust that made everything taste better!!).  It was wonderful!!!!  Hearty and flavorful, but not too rich.  This is like the food my old chefs used to reminisce about, the kind of food that gets people into cooking in the first place.   But make sure you go on the weekends for that dish, as it is only available then as it takes longer to prepare, much like cassoulet.  FYI, we split the 1/2 order, so make sure you get your portion size right.....we also had just a little bit left over to take home! :)

We also tried our friends&#39; dishes of stuffed gnocchi (typically thought of as a traditional Italian dish), potato dumplings stuffed with white cheese served in a creamy tomato sauce - DELICIOUS. I love gnocchi, and it&#39;s great to have a place close by to get it freshly made!!  Our other friend is a little less adventurous with his pallette and went with the breaded and fried chicken breast plate, which he was very happy with and enjoyed.

I was also able to try their Guarana Antarctica, which is a traditional Brazilian soda. It was very refreshing and tasted a little bit like ginger ale, but sweeter.  

For dessert we had to try a few things, as well, as one must do when celebrating their birth.  We went with the chocolate bonbons, which were VERY rich and gooey, almost like a cross between fudge and icing.  We tried the Brazilian milk pudding (think flan), which was delightful and also rich when paired with a decadent syrup.  The coconut bonbons were enjoyed around the table, and our Puerto Rican friend commented that they reminded him of something he grew up with.  I think everyone&#39;s favorite, though, was the lemon pie, which ate like a key lime style pie. 

Overall we very pleased with our meal. The price is right, around $25-35 for two people with sodas, apps, entree and dessert!!  The young boy who brought our sodas was a bit timid, and the servers may need some practice and fine tuning, so don&#39;t expect 3-star service, but it is a genuine family restaurant vibe that is very friendly, inviting, cheerful and accepting, and the food is just as comforting."

Neither of us had ever tried collard greens and now we are definite fans of it. For desert we shared the Brigadeiro de colher (Brazilian hot chocolate) and I can&#39;t get it out of my head!

Note I don&#39;t say CHEAP, just easy - this year I bought two turkey breasts (one smoked, one roasted), a container of gravy, a container of stuffing, and two bags of rolls and it was 75ish bucks. Steep. But the turkey is so moist and incredibly delicious, especially the smoked one. The sides taste relatively good for being frozen. The rolls were fresh.

So, I will try again.  I looooooooooooooove  Honey Baked hams.  Now you can purchase small prepackaged slices of ham, both boneless and traditional.  I find by doing that I do not waste a whole lot of ham.  Perfect for just 2.  They also have slices of both kinds of turkey.  The packaging can also be used to freeze any you might have left over.

With expiration dates into 2015, I was able to buy sweet potato souffle for the holidays.  They also shared that they are coming out with 3 new sides in time for the holidays.  So, I may just have to risk an incredibly long line just to try the new sides.

I have also discovered their delicious BBQ sauces.  I was shocked at just how good they are.  The ribs are fall off the bone, juicy, and tasty.  20 minutes in the oven, purchase a couple of sides, and dinner is served.

So, you can go to buy ham, turkey, ribs, side dishes, sauces, desserts, and sandwiches.  Everything covered?"

This store used to be a great catering choice for my company. Everyone loved the ham pasta salad, which we ordered as a side for our sandwiches. The last time we ordered, that was gone and replaced with an oily pasta salad. Ok, things change. This time, we received our catering with each sandwich in a separate bag, double knotted. Do you know how long it takes to undo 20 bags to be set out? And we ordered a pasta and potato salad side. No utensils or serving spoons. We also ordered a dessert tray. Half of it was crumbled, the heavy cookies were on top of the lemon bars ... etc. Horrible.

The bread was still fresh (even at the end of the day).  We got a classic ham and a roasted turkey sandwich.  The turkey could have used a little more mayo but otherwise the sandwiches were good.

Loved have sushi nearby--scratch that not just sushi, but SUSHI DELIVERY near me. Score!

I mostly have gotten rolls off the menu, since that&#39;s my main preference. Had pretty much all the standard fare, plus 1-2 special ones we try each time we go. Everything is pretty good. It&#39;s not my very favorite, but they hold their weight.

Other than sushi, I always get a miso soup and if with a group we get the Gyoza a lot- both are tasty.

Service-wise, sometimes it&#39;s really slow to get sat. Even if there are open tables sometimes there will be 1-2 employees standing around, but not playing host/hostess. It can be a little frustrating. But, once you get a table, the service is usually quite acceptable.

We live in Plainfield now, but we still head out that way every few months to eat there, so it does have a good draw."

It was empty which was nice. I really like the decor and they made the benches festive with pillows. 

I ordered a few things

-Edamame- Very fresh and delicious with the right amount of salt
-Plain Fried Rice- The rice alone was ok but it came with this sauce that made it great 
-California Roll- These were ok but not great, the reason for the 1 star deduction. 
-Caterpillar Roll- Amazing, perfect, I loved it.

One thing I&#39;ve noticed is that the average rating for a non-chain restaurant in the far north, south, or west suburbs, is significantly higher than if you put the establishment in a more established area.  So, for Oswego, Sakamoto is probably in the top 10 non-chain restaurants in the area.  But when I factor in the poor service, uncomfortable seating, and food, it&#39;s A-OK and nothing more.

The decor is trendy and the setting is intimate.  The tables are uncomfortably close to each other in this tiny space, which was very busy on a Saturday evening.  When we walked in, I noticed a few 4-top tables near the window.  It was not as crowded in that section, so I asked if we could be seated over there.  The hostess (think Linda Yu in white go-go boots) was snippy and said it was &#34;reserved.&#34;  Regardless of the table&#39;s status, why the attitude?  We were then wedged into a table next to another couple.  We didn&#39;t talk much during our meal; who can be relaxed and have any sort of banter when you&#39;re practically cuddling with strangers?

If I had to, I&#39;d return during a less busy period and hope for a table where I&#39;m not literally rubbing elbows with strangers.

We ordered several rolls (below).  They were all good, and honestly I would want to come back here if I had a sushi craving since it&#39;s fairly close to home.  

Spicy Crunchy White Tuna --- This was not spicy at all.  :(
Phoenix (spicy salmon, tuna)
Green Turtle (with avocado and mango)
Paradise (salmon, tuna, red snapper)

I don&#39;t mind driving a little bit out of my way for something I really like.  That being said, I can see why locals like this place.  In an area saturated by chain restaurants and tacquerias, Sakamoto is a welcome addition.  

Say what you want, call me a snob, but I would rather make the trek to another nearby suburb (or the city) for excellent sushi in a more comfortable environment."

It was a Saturday so it was pretty busy. Upon arriving, the hostess just stared blankly at us. She walked away and didnt come back out for a few minutes. She whispered that it would be a long wait and left us standing in confusion. Fast forward to the meal. When our food was prepared, the chefs set it on the glass counter. There it sat for over 20 minutes as our server neglected to pick it up and deliver it. Definitely will be avoiding this place until this staff is turned over."

Snotty hostess, sub par food.  It&#39;s almost as if they weren&#39;t sushi chefs at all.  The rice was not sushi rice, the rolls were extremely loose, and the flavors were just off.  Nothing was bad but I can get better quality in the end cap at jewel.  Clearly all these 5 star reviews don&#39;t know what quality sushi tastes like.  Our order was $100.  The hostess acted like we were some hobos off the street begging for water.  I&#39;m contemplating declining the charges I&#39;m so upset about the whole experience.

Good customer service goes a long way and she has LOTS to learn! When I went home my mother said that was the reason she stopped going to this restaurant. I had no idea. First and last for me!

We typically do carry out. They used to deliver, but that isn&#39;t an option with their new menu. The teriyaki chicken we ordered came to us hibachi style with no flavor. It was chewy and gross and a lot of tendons, so it definitely wasn&#39;t a breast. We added a side of teriyaki steak for $5, and got 4 pieces of meat. We asked for extra teriyaki sauce and got soy sauce. The California roll was hot, and the avocado very mushy. Not fresh tasting at all. We&#39;ve had problems with the quality of this place going down over the last year, but I think we&#39;re done. It was nice to have good Japanese food that delivered.

It&#39;s in a strip mall in the out lot by the Home Depot. Not much from the outside, but once we entered, we knew we found a neighborhood gem. The restaurant is nicely decorated, very clean and quiet...I&#39;d say a trendy space where you can actually enjoy a dinner conversation.  Our server Megan was very friendly and attentive. We started with shrimp tempura and miso soup. The tempura was so light and flaky. The only negative from my whole dining experience here is that there were just three shrimp tempura in this appetizer. I thought that was a little too skimpy, 4-5 yes, but three just seemed a little too little. The miso soup was flavorful and a good size.  My husband and I shared two specialty maki and two regular maki, Red Zebra, Dancing Eel, Alaskan and Spicy Crunchy White Tuna. These rolls were presented beautifully and artistically with rose petals and a fruit carving. The fish was extremely fresh and the flavors just exploded in my mouth. I savored every bite. I highly recommend the Red Zebra with spicy tuna, yellowfin tuna, super white tuna with unagi sauce and tobiko (fish roe) and the Dancing Eel with bbq eel, tempura shrimp, avocado, cream cheese with a mango sauce, unagi sauce and a spicy mayo. Both of these rolls were outstanding.  Our first dining experience here was so wonderful that we determined this little place surpasses Kiku in Naperville and Chef Soon in Woodridge.

I found this little gem in a strip mall nestled among all the corporate giants and food chains.  Don&#39;t judge a book by the cover because the whole in the wall look from the outside is actually very warm and welcoming on the inside.  

The sushi menu is large, and the first thing I looked at caught my eye and I ended up ordering it.  The &#34;smokey samurai&#34; has smoked salmon, fresh crab, cream cheese, and avocado wrapped in rice and fried in tempura batter.   It&#39;s then topped with snow crab, two sauces, and bonito flakes.   When it&#39;s served, the flakes actually move almost like their alive.  It&#39;s really cool!  The roll was delish, the combo of sauce leaving almost a spicy bbq flavor lingering in my mouth.  Really tasty, cooked very well, and served beautifully.  I also had the house miso soup and it was also very good.  Nice balance of flavor and good fresh tofu.  

At this point I was pretty full, but the very helpful and friendly waitress offered desert.  Banana tempura with vanilla and coffee ice cream.  Sold!  This thing was huge!  The banana was the hero, as it should be.  A nice ending indeed.  

 I almost hope I end up staying in this hotel again at some point so I can come back here and try more food!  If you find yourself in the area check this place out, it&#39;s earned it&#39;s high rating."

I had gotten out of night class a bit earlier so I called as soon as I could to place a pick up order. I had 20 minutes before closing and they made it happen. I was very happy because I thought it might be too late, and it took me 15 minutes just to get there. 

When I arrived my food was all ready, I literally walked in, paid, walked out. Super fast. 

Upon opening my meal it looked very tasty, wonderful presentation and the flavor were good. I ordered a version of the rainbow roll and shrimp tempura. I will certainly be going back to this place for more."

Great little sushi place with a creative attitude. Seeing that it was a popular place, we made reservations for 6p; however, that didn&#39;t turn out to be completely necessary. We were promptly greeted, taken to our seats, and drink orders taken. Our edamame came out fast, as did our rolls. We had the Firecracker, Smokey Samurai, Tropical Tuna, one I forgot, a spicy veggie, and a mango veggie. Yeah, we went a little overboard, but it was oh so good. Great service, presentation, and they even offered us a military discount. What&#39;s not to love?  If you like creative sushi rolls, this is your place. Thanks to Sakamoto for supporting our military!"

We were seated quickly but after a long wait, our server finally took our order. I got the 2-roll lunch special which included soup or salad and 2 rolls from a list of about 18 for $12.99.
I opted for the miso soup which was very good! My girlfriends both got the salad but I was unimpressed that both bowls came out messy, with dressing dripping down the side. For my rolls I ordered the spicy crunchy (tuna) roll &amp; the shrimp tempura roll. When they came out the server did not explain to us which rolls were which, as is customary. Both rolls were yummy and fresh but nothing to write home about. When were finished our server boxed up our leftovers and even gave us extra salmon &amp; spicy mayo upon request!
One other thing: the sushi chefs were working at a counter not too far from us and the constant sound of the knife hitting the cutting board (chop, chop, chop) got annoying. I could understand if they were doing it for spectators to enjoy but it was behind a counter. Very bothersome during lunch conversation!"

Bf and I went here on a random friday night. No special occasion, we just wanted sushi. We ordered drinks- i got the mango mojito (pretty good) he got some sort of &#34;special&#34; tea. We also ordered an app- the veggie egg rolls which were tiny! But delish. For dinner I got shrimp habachi which was good, brown rice wasn&#39;t the greatest. The shrimp was excellent. Bf got sushi- california rolls and another one with some sort of mango sauce which was amazing! He said the sushi here was the best he ever had!! 
What made this visit special was our server, Christina. She asked for my ID when I ordered my drink &amp; noticed that my birthday was last Monday. At the end of our dinner she surprised me with a complimentary ice cream sundae complete with a birthday candle! I was so excited, especially because we didn&#39;t even come to celebrate my birthday. It was unexpected and totally awesome of her to go out of her way to do that!! It&#39;s little things like that make a restaurant experience extraordinary. We will definitely return soon :)"

It&#39;s small, but the interior is always decorated nicely and clean. I love their spicy crab egg roll for an appetizer. We try something new every time we go, but you can&#39;t go wrong with their shrimp tempura roll and crunchy California roll. I love their unique specialty rolls as well. Make sure to order a glass of wine because the prices are reasonable and the servicing nice is generous.

Also, things are covered in dripping sauces,..........eeew. WAY too much. And, you should let the diner add that final topping as needed.

Ingredients in the rolls seem to have been sitting around a long time, awaiting assembly as needed. Pot stickers were really greasy. And the doug was thick, almost pierogi-like.

 Fried rice was cheap tasting; like a cheap chinese restaurant. This was americanized corrupted &#34;asian&#34; food......trying to appeal to the everyman/blue collar worker.  The place is laid out poorly and makes it seemed more cramped than typical sushi/urban seatings where its common for people to be close together, the floorplan doesn&#39;t make this situation OK.

I kinda felt like I walked into a small town bar and was from out of town... I&#39;m pretty sure the music stopped. That said, they do have a kids menu, so take it as you will...

I love Sushi places, this one was just okay. It was fresh and all but the prices were very high and the portions lacking compared to others. Again, it was not bad, but it was not great. The host and server argued when we came in over where to seat us for about 30 seconds before acknowledging our group. This was also a kids issue I think.

Here is my BIG Gripe, the place smells a lot like a nail salon since they are next to one and I think share the air system.  This gave me a nice headache.

By far the best, freshest and most visually appealing sushi in this area. The inventiveness of the rolls here is awesome not to mention the care that is taken in the presentation. My only gripe is that I was served a mixed drink with flat soda which I returned. The food and service soon made me forget about this small oversight. 

It&#39;s a super small place yet pretty hip for the area and very comfortable inside. One real plus is that they do indeed have a kids menu as well if you bring the kids with you. That&#39;s always good.

Arrived at 4:30 pm on a Friday.  Stood at the door with my daughter.  Asian woman with deadpan face across the room asks how many in our party.  She turns to get the menus.  Turns back and looks past me out the door it seems.  We wait for her to tell us to follow her.  She continues to look past me and then at the dining room and then past me again.  She walks a few steps into the dining area looking around.  We wait to be asked to follow.  She finally looks at me raises her shoulders and twists her face into an irritated look.  If you can imagine &#34;WTF!&#34; translated into a physical motion, you know what she did.  I turned around and left.

Here I was about to drop $100-$150 on dinner for three and an owner of the business (I am assuming she was an owner) effectively says &#34;WTF!&#34; when we failed to telepathically understand we were to follow her.  I won&#39;t be treated that way anywhere I go.

It&#39;s a shame, because we only live 2 miles away, regularly eat sushi, and we had been here 2-3 times before.  The person seating us has always been noteworthy for their lack of polite customer engagement (notably so) but, previously, it was just the deadpan look, not the rude attitude.  And no, I can&#39;t confirm if it was always the same person doing the seating.

The sushi has been ok in the past, no complaints.  So, if you do decide to go and risk being treated like dirt, you&#39;ll probably have a fine time.   Typically, the person who has sat us was not the person who waited on us.  The waitresses themselves have always been nice.

But good sushi and nice waitresses do not trump knowing my money is going to someone so rude.

On the other hand, the people at Kiku&#39;s recognize us on arrival and have always offered a welcoming greeting.  I&#39;m not saying Kiku&#39;s is always perfect, but we&#39;ve been going there regularly now for 8 years and except for the high cost of sushi we&#39;d gladly eat there 3-5 times a week.  Another good place we&#39;ve eaten sushi was Moshi Moshi.  We&#39;ve gone to every sushi place around this area.  All of them have been at least ok, just Kiku&#39;s and Moshi Moshi stood out for us.  But can&#39;t recommend anyone be treated like this at Sakamoto."

I am something of a sushi pansy. I&#39;m not really a fish eater and approached sushi with much trepidation.  I do enjoy shellfish and veggies, so I&#39;m a maki roll girl.  So I&#39;m posting that disclaimer up front - I can&#39;t comment on the fish here.

However, what I have had has been wonderful.  Love the Spicy Crunchy Cali rolls and the Spicy Philly Crab roll.  They also have a Crab Mango roll that looks and tastes like a bite of summer.  

Their other menu items are fabulous as well.  The teriyaki steak and mushrooms has always been a big hit among the non-sushi eating members of my dinner party. and I dream at night of that Philly Crab Egg roll.  So, so good...  

The place is a bit small but nice- intimate.  Cocktails are fabulous (Japanese Sex... OMG) and they have a nice little selection of hot tea.

If you are budget conscious - and I am -and like maki rolls,  hit them for lunch.  They have a two rolls and a salad (ginger dressing to die for) for $9.50 and three rolls is somewhere close to $13.50.  Split that with a friend, order an extra salad and you have a very reasonable sushi lunch!"

They were both talking about sushi nonstop that day, so this was the closest place we saw. Since I&#39;m on a low carb diet, i was hoping they&#39;d have something I can eat since I can&#39;t have rice. We sat down, and ordered. My coworker ordered two rolls-a Philadelphia and a shrimp tempura. My other coworker ordered a large soup bowl with tempura veggies and shrimp. I ordered a sirloin steak with veggies. The server asked me how I wanted the steak cooked, I said medium rare. I also told her not to include rice with my dish because I couldn&#39;t eat it so she asked if I wanted extra vegetables instead of the rice, which I said yes to. We then sat there drinking our water for 43 minutes... Yes 43 minutes! By the time we had gotten our food it was already time to go back to work. We contemplated taking it to go but we were so hungry we finished our plates in less then 10 minutes. My steak was actually dry and wayyyy overcooked and underseasoned, not even close to medium-anything! She also ended up charging me for the extra vegetables that she asked if I wanted instead of the rice, which wasn&#39;t much but still.

I eat sushi as often as I can (usually every week) in almost every suburb in the area and while some are really bad and I wouldn&#39;t return to them and some others are so amazing that I want to eat there every day, Sakamoto was no where near the top of my list. It wasn&#39;t at the very bottom either but it was very close. 

I went in the other day for lunch, no one else was there at lunch time which should have told me something. I sat at the bar and ordered 10 pieces of Nigiri sushi - the very basic, salmon and tuna, to see how they prepared them. When the piece of salmon doesn&#39;t extend over the ends of the huge clump of dense rice, I know there is a problem. Either the chef doesn&#39;t know how to slice the fish properly or they are told to cut smaller pieces by management to save money.  When they do that and still charge what they charge, they have immediately lost my business. 

Maybe the other reviewers judge the quality of their Nigiri by the size of the clump of rice but I prefer to judge it by the actual piece of fish (salmon, tuna, yellowtail, etc.) that I am paying for. 

Another issue I had was because no one else was there the waitress literally stood next to me at the bar and watched me eat and kept talking the the chef about what was on TV. She also tried to engage me in a conversation when I was trying to eat. Very bad customer service and even worse having a TV showing some daytime talk show garbage. 

I would rather drive to some place nice like Kiku in Naperville and pay the same price for a much larger piece of higher quality sushi than eat her again. Every time I drive by there I wonder how they are still in business."

I ordered a variety of rolls, which were all delicious and seemed really fresh!

(With as many times as I&#39;ve been here, I&#39;ve only had a few lunch/dinners that were a little off, but I think it was because they were just SUPER busy.)

I love to go for lunch because they have awesome specials Mon-Sat. Sushi Rolls+ Soup or Salad, or Hibachi+ Soup or Salad. My favorite roll is the Spicy Philly Crab (which I haven&#39;t come across at any other sushi place I&#39;ve been to).

Their fried ice cream is amazing- if you have room, I would definitely get it!"

Based on its location of being right next to a nail salon, I wasn&#39;t expecting much seeing as there aren&#39;t many restaurants in the area. I tried Sakamoto on a Thursday night. When we first walked in, there were only two others seated at a able and some lone dude at the bar. Soon after the entire place filled up. I&#39;d assume we beat the dinner time rush.

Miso soup was somewhat bland, but I&#39;m use to really salty types. What I was most impressed with was the portion sizes of the roles. The price and amount made for a sweet deal. This was definitely your average sushi and nothing mind blowing. Be prepared to wait a bit for your sushi to be made. Saki fan? They&#39;ve got a good selection of that too. Service was on par from my single experience. I would definitely go back if I&#39;m looking to get my sushi fix!"

Not too long ago, Sakamoto came to town and is located in a strip center in front of Home Depot on Route 34.  I&#39;ve been wanting to try it for some time but finally had my first opportunity last night for dinner.

The atmosphere is very trendy and pleasant albeit small.  There is even a very small bar area as you walk in so you could stop for a cozy drink if that was all you wanted.

The place may be small but the menu isn&#39;t.  Sakamoto specializes in sushi but also features warm dishes for those who aren&#39;t quite ready for sushi.

We started with a very tasty Tempura combo appetizer ($8.50) which featured shrimp and vegetables.  Tempura comes with a light fried battered coating which was done perfectly to my taste.  

For our entrees, my dinner partner was one of those who prefers a warmer, cooked meal and ordered the Yaki Udon with Beef ($13.50), which is a Japanese noodle dish with generous portions of meat and vegetables.  It had a very slight &#34;kick&#34; to it that was just perfect.  She loved it and I sampled it as well, and agreed with her assessment. 

I went with a combination of two different sushi entrees.  The &#34;Godzilla&#34; ($12.00) was delicious!  It combines Shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado with crunchy sprouts. Next I went with the Chef&#39;s Choice of 7 pieces of nigiri sushi ($16.00).  It was also excellent and I would highly recommend this as well.  

We normally pass on dessert but as we had not stuffed ourselves and still had a little room left, we splurged and tried a wonderful tempura banana dessert that had 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and had caramel and chocolate sauce lightly drizzled over top.  Sinfully delicious that capped off a terrific dinner.

We each had some wine with our meals and a garden salad came with both dinners.  The salad was nothing special and considering all we ate for dinner, could have easily been skipped.  Our total tab was $71.00 plus tip.

All in all, we both were very pleased with our choices and look forward to our next visit to Sakamoto!"

All were AMAZING. I wasn&#39;t expecting much for my husband&#39;s delivery steak, but it was a PERFECT medium, and tender enough to be eaten with the included plastic silverware.

I here for lunch at least three times a week. My favorites include: the tacos, pulled turkey sandwich, and the kabobs. The tacos are great, my preference is for the beef brisket tacos, but the pulled turkey version is also good. They used to have a bbq chicken taco, but it&#39;s off the menu now, which is kind of a bummer. The shrimp and chicken kabobs are also good, a little on the expensive side for a regular lunch item. The pulled turkey sandwich is great when paired with sweet potato waffle fries. Overall, solid lunch spot!"

When it comes to ribs there are so many variations and many people like them done differently.  What I like about the ribs at the patio is that they don&#39;t just fall off the bone.  They are tender, but you do have to bite a bit to grab the meat off the bone.

Many places use a tone of sodium and brine to make them so tender that they fall right off.  If you like it that way go to Portillos.

Keep in mind, this is a fast food place.  It isn&#39;t a fancy sit-down restaurant where they are serving you......you don&#39;t have to tip here.  The prices are pretty low for good ribs.  If you think this is too expensive, go to Portillos."

It&#39;s almost unfathomable that they actually built their own building from scratch here with so many vacant buildings to choose from.  But regardless I am pleased with the results.  This location is ultra modern and sleek with clear glass outer walls so that patrons can sit and feel almost that they are outdoors on a patio!  They must have consulted a feng shui expert because the decor tables and chairs include a wonderful mix of metal, stone, glass &amp; greenery.  LOL!  Just my observation that this location puts you amazingly at ease.  

We recently went on a Friday night after a concert.  The place was packed!  Having already eaten dinner before the concert we just decided to stop in for a &#34;midnight snack&#34;.  Although I have had many different entrees at The Patio I have never had their onion rings, fried mushrooms and fried zucchini before but they were all what you would expect.

It&#39;s fast food done well.  I&#39;ve been to other locations and usually they are too noisy for me to enjoy my food.

It literally will take 10 minutes to figure out what you want to eat though.  As the menu is an entire backlit wall.

I tried the ribs once, and as a picky rib connoisseur, I have to say that I was impressed.

My usual is the pulled pork sandwich.  Sometimes they skimp on the BBQ sauce, but there is some right at your table to indulge in.

I had the BBQ Pretzel burger and felt that it wasn&#39;t my favorite.  It almost tastes like frozen patties.  It might not be, but that&#39;s what came to mind when I bit into it.

I know I will be going there often as a quick and easy meal choice."

The restaurant focuses on BBQ and that &#34;patio&#34; atmosphere, but there is more than just BBQ if that&#39;s not your thing.

My favorite thing at the Patio is the Monterey Jack Chicken sandwich.  The chicken is consistently a big portion and very tender.  I always slather on extra &#34;hot and sassy&#34; sauce, which is provided by the bottle at the table.  The fries are monstrous portions, ideal for sharing, and the macaroni &amp; cheese is both creamy and cheesy.  For about $3, this &#34;side dish&#34; is a generous portion.

The line inside was long, maybe 6-8 people deep, so they had a girl taking orders in line to assist the counter help.  There&#39;s a menu posted on the length of the wall, which is easy to read and convenient.

When I ordered, the girl asked me, &#34;do you want the regular or the loaded?&#34;  I asked her what the difference was, and I could tell by her hesitation that she really didn&#39;t know.  It would help the line move faster to have someone do this job that is better acquainted wiht the menu.  I ordered the &#39;loaded&#39; anyway.  

Patio is a welcome addition to the mall area, currently chock full of family-oriented chain restaurants and stuff that just, well, sucks.  I&#39;m happy to have this place nearby."

Unfortunately I won&#39;t be going back to eat below average overpriced food. My wife ordered 1/2 slab of the bbq ribs and I went with the 1/2 chicken oreganato plus 2 hot teas. Price came up at almost $40.  The ribs were not tender at all and they did not have a smoky flavor whatsoever. The bbq sauce was good but it didn&#39;t matter. The chicken was tender but not much flavor to it. The sides that came with both meals were just ok. I should have read previous reviews before going to this place. I&#39;ve learned my lesson.

However, when I stepped into the brand new established I was bit taken aback at how nice the dinning area was. There a few areas to sit in and a plethora of TVs to keep you entertained while waiting. This made for a really enjoyable dining experience as me and friend enjoyed our food with some NBA playoff basketball. 

Strangely enough, I didn&#39;t go with ribs for my first time back. Instead I opted for the roasted chicken dinner, which at $11 (with a drink) wasn&#39;t a bad deal at all. Included was half a chicken, coleslaw, a healthy portion of mashed potatoes, and roll. 

The chicken was cooked to a good temperature, not too dry while maintaining a nice crispy skin. However, the chicken didn&#39;t really have much flavor and needed a bit of help from the BBQ sauce  on the table. The coleslaw is mayo based, but had a nice crisp to it. The mashed potatoes were super creamy and buttery. This was probably my highlight of the meal. The roll was a bit stale so it remained relatively untouched throughout the meal. 

Overall, I think the establishment is a good additional to the the area. The menu is pretty vast, while still offering a specialty item (the ribs) to draw in people with specific cravings. The seating area is comfortable and really nice. I will give the food another chance, even though my meal was relatively average."

It&#39;s definitely not the ideal location for al fresco dining, but if you like exhaust smells it might be just perfect!

Not that I sat outside on my visit. It was in February so the fam and I saddled up to a booth right next to a fireplace. I can&#39;t say there was a ton of heat emanating from there, but it was a nice thought.

If you care to cross reference this review with my other review for The Patio in Bolingbrook (yo, girl), you would know that I love that location. I think this one has potential to be just as great, I just think the staff needs a few months to get their act together. It was a little rough but I have good faith. 

I will say that their salads are kind of tiny but really expensive and their ribs are pretty good. As always, the Greek pita is off the chain.

But. I&#39;ve been going to these places for years, and frankly, didn&#39;t give a shit. The food was okay, but not worth going out of my way for. Stopped going there for a long time. Then one evening it was a little late and the Patio was the only thing that was open in the vicinity, so the Wife and I stopped in.
Wife-unit eats only Chicken Breast. And it&#39;s gotta be cooked well done on the verge of burnt. I can&#39;t stand White meat poultry for the most part, with a particular aversion to boneless, skinless chicken breast. Usually dry and tasteless. Why Bother?
So she orders the Chix sandwich  with orders to cremate it, and I swung with the Beef tenderloin Kebabs, RARE.
So the food is delivered to the table, and it looked yummy. Even my wifes plate.
The Beef was extraordinarily tasty. A great plate for a modest price. Easily on a par with Outback. 
Wife was gushing about the Chicken. She offered a taste, and I was shocked!
Even though there was a considerable char on the outside, the filet was juicy, tender and actually had considerably good chicken flavor.
What the hell kind of magic was going on in that kitchen?
I&#39;d order that Chicken in a heartbeat, and that&#39;s saying a lot.
On the way out, I noticed an older fella in shirt and tie counting cash out of the register, and I approached him
&#34;Are you the boss?&#34;
&#34;I&#39;m the Owner!&#34;
I proceeded to tell him just how much I hated Chicken Breast, but how absolutely delicious his rendition was. Like a good Greek proprietor, he kind of grunted with &#34;yeah I know&#34; understood, but a tiny &#34;Thank you&#34; without a smile. (Years of Greektown experience has taught me the temperament of Greek Restauranteurs, and I know my compliment registered with him, dont ask me how, but I did)
We&#39;ve been to some of the other Patios in the area, and the Chicken has not disappointed ever. A great casual feed..."

The restaurant is new and its huge! When you walk in you have an area to view the menu, after that you go to the counter and place your order, then they bring your good to your table. 
The young man who took our order was not very friendly. Never greeted us and made ordering kind of awkward. 
I got a kabob meal with rice, my son got a brisket sandwich and my boyfriend got the ribs. My food was just ok, nothing out of the ordinary, my son enjoyed his sandwich but my boyfriend did not like his ribs at all. They were very dry and did not look good at all.

The BBQ is ok. We&#39;ve tried various things, chicken, ribs, pulled pork, brisket, etc.

Most of it is just ok. Kind of bland on seasoning and sauces. The only really memorable things were the grade school cafeteria-style seating and serving-ware, and how the fries kept coming to us cold, even after we complained.

He seemed irritated that I didn&#39;t spit my order out at him like I had memorized their gigantic menu. We were only seated for a short time and our food appeared, which was why I found it odd that my beef brisket and mashed potatoes were stone cold. If that wasn&#39;t bad enough the brisket was tough and had no flavor. But it got worse, as I found a black hair in my food. Needless to say I lost my already diminishing appetite.

The sandwiches were actually really good. I had the beef brisket and enjoyed it thoroughly, the meat was really tender and blended well with the sauce. The bun was fresh, and added to the flavor. 

The fries are incredibly bland and could really use a new recipe because eating through them was an actual struggle. 

The wait time was really slow, took 25 minutes from the purchase to getting food on the table which seems long for a fast casual restaurant. 

Overall great sandwiches, but the shortcomings of this restaurant will most likely make me not return to eat inside, but rather a place to stop and just pickup a sandwich"

I had the barbeque chicken breast with a baked potato and veggies. I really liked that it tasted homemade, no frills. The chicken was cooked well and the barbeque sauce was yummy. The veggies were tasty (no doubt soaked in butter, and came in a huge portion. My baked potato was, well, a baked potato, but it made me happy.

We went on opening day at lunch time and it was surprisingly not very busy.  I assume this is because they did not have a ton of advertising about what day they were opening.  
They have a large illuminated menu when you first walk in so you can decide what you want before getting in line to order.  Their best known for their BBQ but they also have several American and Greek choices.
I got the beef brisket sandwich which was tasty but not as good as their pulled pork.  I got a side of fries and dipped them in their BBQ sauce which is a MUST!  My boyfriend got an Italian sandwich that came with Italian sausage, beef, cheese, hot &amp; sweet peppers on it.  Both were hearty portions which gave us leftovers. Total was about $18 with my Clipper Magazine coupon. (front cover, this weeks issue)
I also got a fresh-brewed Peach tea to drink which was scrumptious :)

The environment here is awesome!  Very clean and modern looking.  They have a fireplace and a full bar with seating.

But their food is just not my thing. I had pulled pork taccos, which was good, not great. I had quite a few big chunks of meat in the pulled pork, that I didn´t like. The dish I picked was BBQ Taccos and they come with either chicken and pulled pork. You get three taccos. I wanted to try 1 chicken and 2 pulled pork, but apparently that is not possible. It´s either the one or the other. That was a little irritating. Come on, they are taccos, can´t be that hard to put one thing on one and the other on the other two.

The worst were the fries. To me they have a very bad flavor, a weird sour taste. I couldn´t tell if it was the potatoe flavor or if they are using old/bad oil. I just know that flavor wise they were the worst I´ve ever had.

The Mac and cheese stunk IMO. It was made with penne and not elbow macaroni and the sauce--might as well have been jarred Ragu. Was definitely not homemade.

CUSTOMER SERVICE IS EVERYTHING. ITS 2015  and if you think that you can just do a crappy job and it wont catch up to you, think again. 20 years ago if I wanted to complain, I had to drive back there. Its 2015, and Now I get to write a bad review while eating my chili, sans sour cream."

One person in our party ordered 1/2 ribs with chicken    It came without the ribs. One ordered meatloaf.  It was lukewarm.  I had a beef brisket sandwich.  The meat was tough and cut too thick.  I realize others rave about the food and we are willing to try a second time. Wasn&#39;t impressed with our first visit. Could be us .....or just one of those days.

I had a manager that enjoyed going to The Patio because it was so close so I had the unfortunate experience of trying many things on their menu. Literally nothing here is above average. Maybe the hot dog? The food here is on par with what I got in the High School cafeteria. Im giving it one more star because of the atmosphere. Its stylish. Defiantly overpriced for what you get and the quality.

Three out of 4 of us will not return.   Food was mediocre at best mainly due to the use of poor quality ingredients  and certainly over priced for those ingedients.  The grilled cheese consisted of nothing more than Kraft single knock offs on soggy bread and they forgot the fries on kids meal even after confirming our selection.  The fries we did receive were crispy on the outside and  tender on the inside but expensive.   The Julian salad had loads of lunch meat and veggies, however,  the raspberry vinegrette beared closer resemblance to pancake syrup.

We ordered three appetizers (mushrooms, bbq nachos, rib basket), two bbq bacon burgers, and one chili dog. The ribs (dry rub) were pretty good, as were the mushrooms. The way the nachos were made basically created a single layer of &#34;nacho&#34; chips followed my lots of dry, plain tortilla chips. I don&#39;t know how you can make a burger with cheese, bbq sauce, bacon, and grilled onions taste dry, but they managed. The burgers were very &#34;well done&#34; and a bit crunchy, and the bacon was overcooked with a burnt flavor. The french fries were dry and bland as well.

To top it all off, my son had a chili dog, which he said was ok. He started to eat his pickle spear and noticed it had a couple of bugs on it. I pointed it out to one of the servers walking around the floor. He looked at it and took it to the manager. Then he returned with three new pickles, with no comment from either the server or the manager.

Aside from the buggy pickle, the food was just OK with nothing really standing out.

On the plus side, the decor was spacious, cleanly, and the people were friendly"

This will be my new go-to spot for casual dining. My wife and two kids went here last weekend and shared a number of menu items. The pulled pork was tasty. My kids loved their fries and mac and cheese. They also split the chicken tenders and enjoyed them as well. We also split an order of mushroom and zucchini for an appetizer and the charbroiled chicken kabobs. 

When we stopped in the place was busy. The service and staff were friendly and efficient. Food came out piping hot and savory and the ambiance was probably our favorite part. It&#39;s very family friendly if you&#39;re thinking about bringing kids."

This place is amazing!!!!

I was apprehensive to even try this place out... 
3 stars?! Hmmm

BUT my BF and I wanted to try out a different restaurant with a patio...

So... Here we are, Saturday night around 7:45pm... Valet guy was nice...

I thought to myself... I love this kinda restaurant... It&#39;s huge ... It&#39;s not a strip mall kinda restaurant... It&#39;s on butterfield road... You really want to swing by and check it out....

My initial impression when I walked in... Wow!!!

I love the grande entrance... Like a restaurant inside a 5 star hotel

Intimate, inviting and romantic

We opted to go to the patio and sat at the bar 

Jen, the bartender was extremely nice, attentive even though she was so busy... 

We ordered the following:

Burrata $9.59 - 5 stars

Misto di mare $25 - seafood - oh so fresh shrimp, calamari and scallops - 5 stars

Costollete di maiale $25 16 oz bone in porkchop, grilled polenta -- cooked to perfect medium - 5 stars 

Carlucci coffee $10 -- with a presentation -- 10 stars 

Torta di cioccolato $8 - 5 stars

Patio Setting is so romantic

Everything about this place is perfect tonight...

Friday night.. As long as you order an entree, you get 2 glasses of wine for a penny...

That&#39;s a sweet deal... We ended up paying only $85 plus 20% tip

We will be back... I love this place!!!"

So, instead of going downtown for an anniversary date night, we decided we&#39;d try Carlucci&#39;s instead. We&#39;ve been to a Yelp event here &amp; loved it so, why not, right? Wrong. So, so wrong. 

We had reservations but because the Sox game was coming on we decided to sit in the bar to watch the game. That was probably the worst decision we made. There was literally five people in the bar so we sat right away. 

We were greeted &amp; given menus... Shortly after that we were given a wine list. It&#39;s Friday and penny wine night so you&#39;d think she would&#39;ve prefaced the conversation with.. &#34;Penny wine night is house wine only&#34;. Nope that wasn&#39;t the case here. I ordered a glass and was surprised at the $9 charge.. whatever I should&#39;ve asked I guess. 

We ordered oysters &amp; it came with some type of tomato sauce on them.. not on the side, on them. Who does that?! I had a pasta dish which was okay but nothing great. 

Service people, the service was awkward, slightly rude and I was left with the feeling that I won&#39;t go back. The only reason they&#39;re getting three stars is because of the pasta dish. 

Sorry Carlucci, I don&#39;t plan on returning.."

Had such a great time during a prior Yelp event that apparently we expected too much. No mention of the &#34;Penny Wine&#34; Friday special from our preoccupied bartender (cell phone) until after we placed an order for two glasses of Pinot Grigio. Only then ($15 later) were we informed of the special for which was so loudly applauded. 

Apps - A half dozen of the Blue Point Oysters sounded well enough, until the morbidly paired &#34;sundried tomato puree&#34; came into the picture. To make things worse, they were served sans lemon and cocktail sauce. WTF?! Weeks later, I have absolutely no recollection of what I ordered for dinner. I do recall a mish-mosh of bland seafood prompting our immediate desire for an overpriced check.

Instant fail at Carlucci. After reading some other Yelp reviews, it appears that they&#39;re caught in an unfortunate downward spiral..."

You know I met them once. Twice actually, but they won&#39;t remember if you ask them. And they didn&#39;t actually tell me they ate here, it was on an episode of their show. Unless they just pulled one of those random stunts of showing an exterior of a different place to fool you like how the Kardashians use fake house exteriors for their homes. Wow, you&#39;d think I watch a lot of these celebreality shows, but I really don&#39;t. Also, this has to be one of my biggest distracted reviews in awhile. 

But again, it&#39;s my 400th, so I get to be fancy, which brings me back to Carlucci.

The interior is just beautiful with wood trim everywhere. We were seated at the loveliest table in the restaurant with a perfect view of the courtyard and fountain. Sidenote: I came here during a private event in the summer and got to experience sipping cocktails in the courtyard. That is something not to be missed. If you can come back during the warmer months I highly recommend sitting outside.

The service was very friendly and kind. And the food was marvelous. I don&#39;t bring that word out all that often so enjoy it. 

We had a round of drinks. I had some kind of ginger whiskey bourbon cocktail. Y&#39;know, because I&#39;m a ginger and I have to. It was so strong I&#39;m still buzzing from it three days later. TBH I don&#39;t recommend it because all you could taste was alcohol and nothing else.

We had a couple of caesar salads that were the best I&#39;d ever had. No joke. They grill up the prosciutto and wrap the romaine in it which is just lovely. They also throw on a few grape tomatoes and croutons, and drizzle a (I&#39;m guessing) housemade dressing and shaved parm over the top. I would eat this as a meal it was so good.

Next, my wife and I shared a couple of pasta dishes that were both delicious. I&#39;m not going to go on about them because you should choose what you like. I&#39;ll just say this. Everything I&#39;ve ever eaten at Carlucci has been good, and I&#39;d definitely return for a special occasion or fancy evening out. It&#39;s on the easier side of pricey, but that&#39;s to be expected. This is not the Olive Garden. I would definitely recommend you try it, and if you come visit me I&#39;ll take you here for a fun night out."

Lucky for me I came on Wednesday ($5 Martini) during happy hour (4pm-7pm) I set at the bar. After ordering a Mango Martini I end up picking up one of the Happy Hour apps while at the bar but moved to be seated at a table.

Cast Iron Shrimp/Jumbo Shrimp -  Jumbo Shrimp Sautéed with Garlic, EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil), Parsley, Capers and Lemon Juice with Toasted Ciabatta Bread. These were AMAZIG. Loved this. The EVOO and Lemon Juice was a tad salty on the Ciabatta. However they worked great on the shrimp. The Ciabatta were toasted but had a nice Smokey flavor on them. Although I started at the bar. It was a little bit depressing watching the bartender working so hard...also he was a over worked which meant slow to come to me and quick to leave without chatting. So opted to be seated in the regular dining area. 

Bread - I basically had two baskets worth of bread by myself. I basically blame the EVOO and Parmesan cheese. I believe there is three different versions of bread they serve you. Plan, onion/garlic and one with tomato on top. All of them are great.

Peach Bellini - Picked up my second drink however despite being buzz and could care less the grade of alcohol at this point. I did enjoy the mango much more then this. one despite noticing a stronger poor in the Peach.

Linguini Bobonato Con Parmigiano - Spooled Tableside Inside a Fresh Wheel of Parmesan Cheese with Prosciutto di Parma and Fresh Basil. I tend to not really like red sauce pasta as much so this is basically how I ended up ordering this. I was able to get a side of Parmesan  crusted chicken added to accompany this dish. Although I wouldn&#39;t do back flips for the pasta. I want mind coming here again to try them more from the menu.

For some odd reason the place a mix of busy and empty at the same time. (two private parties that were section off but only about 3 tables out of 20 filled in the dinning area.)"

It is a very upscale place -great for a &#34;date night.&#34; -Or drinking with coworkers. But I digress. The waitstaff was super cool and friendly and we ordered a variety of drinks and appetizers. Also, a few of my coworkers ordered entrees. I tried one -an alfredo pasta dish that was very good.

It was always a question in passing, as to how our meal was, but not really stopping to check.  He was quick to point out at the end of the meal that if we had to pay for the salad and the wine which we had a certificate for the actual cost of the meal.

The restaurant was not really too busy, which I might have taken as a reason that our service was so poor.

While the quality is still there, it feels a bit different.  We went there on Monday, expecting some of that delicious and very attractively priced $5 pasta. Unfortunately we were told there was a new chef and the $5 pasta went away.  Of course they still have the same pastas on the menu, so that couldn&#39;t be the reason.  Hmmm?

We opted for the pizzas.  The portion of these is much too large for one person to eat.  Had we been told in advance, we might have ordered differently.  However they were good.

They have a great outdoor space.  It&#39;s an extremely nice place to go for a nice meal.  The food is very good - the pasta is perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  I had the gnocchi dish, which was awesome.  My husband had something that was similar to carbonara - it was well cooked and rich, but on the bland side... It definitely needed lemon or something.  We also had the calamari, which was delish!  On Thursday nights, you can bring your own wine without a cork fee, which we are very excited about because the markup on wine is so high at restaurants.  I come from a place where BYOB Italian places are a dime a dozen, so it also makes me feel like I&#39;m home.  They also have a some really nice spaces for private parties.

On the other hand, I think that the service is pretty slow, though, and the prices are pretty high.  If I&#39;m going to drop that kind of cash on a restaurant, I expect a certain level of service.  If it were 25% less and/or the service was 30% better, my rating would be higher.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll go back, and I don&#39;t think I would tell people they should definitely go, but it&#39;s a decent choice for the area."

From our appetizers to the desserts, everything was full of flavor and the presentation was beautiful. First time ever having seen pasta being served table side in a hollowed out block of cheese!  I highly recommend this dish and at a price point of 16.95, its spectacular.

Our server Brian answered all our questions and had some great recommendations. Wanted to order everything , but there was only 3 of us.

My first impression of the restaurant was elegance. This is absolutely a spot that I can see myself coming to for a fancy meal with my hub or a fun patio and drinks evening with my pals. The indoor seating is divine, very richly decorated and sophisticated, but the outside patio is beautiful! A large fountain and bistro tables give it a European cafe feel, and there is a bar set up right outside for close access to drinks.

During our event we were served a plethora of appetizer options, all of which I tried and all of which were amazing! If you&#39;re in the mood for some rich and authentic Italian, this is a great spot to hit. My favorite dish was the pizza, and the red sauce was also delicious.

Tuesday night party of 3
All three entrees were just ok.
My business partner ordered the 3 pasta sampler. He said one was ok. The other 2 were inedible. His plate was cleared and all that was asked was &#34; would you like a to go box&#34;

I ordered &#39;Radiatori&#39; which on the menu it is described as: garlic cream, grilled chicken, roasted red peppers, broccoli.
This pasta is overwhelmingly cheesy, I could see the bottom of my plate was full of creamy cheese sauce which was very muddy. 
Every single bite of this pasta tasted very bad, it was a mix of bitterness (maybe because of the garlic) and super cheesy taste. My mouth was full of cream and I could not enjoy the grilled chickens and the broccoli because of how overwhelmingly the cream and the cheesy taste was.
The service was good. On that day the chef actually ran an experiment of  a new dessert and the server serve me a complimentary dessert to try.
I really appreciated the complimentary dessert but unfortunately I could not give a good review for the dessert. This dessert is similar to panna cotta with a taste of goat cheese, with figs and (maybe) a bit walnuts on the top. The taste of the dessert was extremely extremely sweet.
Both the pasta and dessert was not enjoyable at all. 
Sadly, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."

Went with a group of 4, all in our mid 20s-- very impressed. 

Live music/dancing was a surprise and so much better than DJ and sloppy drunks.

Buffet was on point. Great food all night.

Champagne toast, party favors.

Had drinks and an app on Saturday at 8 pm

We ate at the bar which had a nice live band. They were loud but that&#39;s to be expected with a live band. 

We ordered a french martini and Bellini which were both very nice. The hummingbird martini was not good. It tasted like licorice.

We ordered the burratta -it was solid. It needed more of the pesto it came with or salt and pepper on top. We were at a bar table and didn&#39;t have any salt and pepper. I had a flavor crisis lol. The bread it came with was so good!! Buttered lightly and obviously made fresh. Loved it. The tomatoes had a nice vinegar flavor. The dish was a solid 3.5 stars. 

Service was very nice and we were attended to not too much but not too little.

We loved the ambience.

The building is easy to find but kind of hard to get to. They have vallet but also plenty of parking. 

They also have plenty of rooms for private parties."

Our server took our wine order to only card me after he brought it and rudely asked if I was 21. We were greeted after 7 mins of other severs walking by,and the hostess was rude as well. I wanted 25 mins for a refill. 
Our salad was not split when we asked it to be. I had to get up myself to receive the olive oil I asked for. I wanted again for lemons with our fried calamari, like why wouldn&#39;t that just come with it? We waited another 25 min for our entree when the restaurant was dead.

We started with calamari, which was really good. The pasta we had as entrees wasnt really anything special though. Everything was well prepared and tasted good, but it just didn&#39;t have much wow factor.

We were told they have a new chef. Outstanding. The seared scallops were perfect, and though I was a little hesitant at first of the fungi with honey and pasta that came with the scallops, it was delicious. Recommended. 

Also had the Pasta Bonato Parmagiano. Another winner. Rich and creamy and excellent. 

The flight of gelato flavors is also highly recommended. I loved them all, and the portions definitely require sharing. Reminded me of Florence. 

Our server Juan did an impeccable job. He recommended the scallop dish (with fungi and honey) and it was spot-on. Great service overall. 

The only reason I am not giving Carlucci&#39;s a full five-star rating is for loudness. When the band started in the bar, the restaurant was not unaffected. It didn&#39;t bother us all that much, but a romantic and quiet dinner would have been difficult with the music so loud. We were told it was a special Halloween event. Fair enough. And I&#39;ll mention, the five-piece band was VERY good!

Food: The food was great as well. We started with the meatballs for an appetizer.  My son ordered a caesar salad, but he did not enjoy it, because it was roasted.

I had my daughters bridal shower here 8 years ago and I had my sons rehearsal dinner here 3 years ago. I have lunch and dinner here. I have been to a yearly fundraiser banquet as well. It used to be my favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant. 

About two weeks ago we decided to have a nice holiday dinner with friends. The atmosphere is so pretty here during The Christmas season. They decorate so tasteful it compliments their rich wood decor. 

After being seated we were given new menus. Unfortunately finding only a couple meals that were familiar. The manager was a making his rounds checking on tables we pointed out that we noticed a lot of new menu items. He said they have a new chef so they changed up the menu.  He said they were getting mixed reviews and had not updated their online menu. We all were happy to try new menu meals. The appetizers were also different. We were told there would be 4 risotto balls in our order. There were three. Another appetizer had the same issue. Luckily with friends it doesn&#39;t matter we just shared. The meal was ok. Not our typical experience we enjoyed over the years. The food was ok I think they tried to be more upscale serving rabbit and quail. Not really what we were looking for. The pastas we ordered were on the cool side not much flavor. It was more like they were throwing ingredients together to create something different that didn&#39;t blend well. They also changed their bread basket. Just plain French bread.  Not even warmed up. 

The manager said he would be back to see how we liked everything but he never did come back. We just would have told him that the wait staff needs to know the menu better. Also we would like more of their main pastas back. 

We will give Carlucci&#39;s another chance in a couple months. We are not in a hurry to go back. Please bring back at least more of the old pasta dishes. 

As for a previous reviewer the Rancic family did dine here. They were friends with the previous manager."

Update: I went back not too long ago and had one of the salads. The salads are definitely where it is at.

POSITIVE: FOOD! The food here is delicious. I&#39;ve been twice for lunch and it&#39;s been great. We ordered nearly every appetizer, and all are flavorful and a great start to the meal. The salads are a great portion for lunch, and the pasta always smells delicious. It&#39;s hard not to stuff myself during lunch!

NEGATIVE: SERVICE! My goodness - don&#39;t come here if you want prompt service! The first time I came here, I had to state my order two times before finally pointing out what I wanted to a very puzzled man who could not understand me (I&#39;m born and raised in the area, folks. No accent here.). What felt like hours...actually were. It took us TWO HOURS to get through lunch the first time I was here. The second time, 1.5 hours. For a restaurant in a prime location for businesses, they need to firm up that 1.5 to .75 to allow for commute time, otherwise they&#39;ll be losing business.

I hope to be able to provide improved reviews in the future - working within walking distance ensures I&#39;ll be back for business."

We sat out on the patio because the weather was perfect, however, the service and food did not match the ambiance. I ordered the scallops and my daughters ordered pasta. The scallops came with a very small amount of green beans that looked like they sat under a heat lamp for an hour because they had the appearance of being dehydrated. Every single scallop had some grit with every bite as if they weren&#39;t properly cleaned before cooking and they were lacking in flavor. We had to continuously wait for wine and water and silverware. They served bread and oil before we had plates or silverware and we sat there for a long time. Then later - after dinner I was still hungry because of the dried up and small amount of veggies served, that I ordered an appetizer pizza and once again it was served on a table that had no plates and it took several minutes for the manager, Brandon to return with the plates. Oh - I had to send the pizza back the first time because it was under cooked and doughy. 

On a good note - my daughters&#39; pasta was delicious but the service, scallops, and pizza were below average at best. I have been there several times and I have received  outstanding service and delicious food so it was quite shocking that yesterday was such a disappointment. The worst part - when I asked the manager if he was short handed he said he wasn&#39;t and when I told him all the issues we had (he knew of many of them because he had to serve our pizza and get someone two times to fill our waters and bring us plates and silverware) he did not apologize. I&#39;m not sure if we will go back - hopefully it was just an off isolated situation because they have an excellent reputation within my group of friends but I will think twice before revisiting."

We ordered the cast iron shrimp which were mediocre, the burrata and prosciutto which were tasteless and just not very good. The waiter was very nice and attentive. He offered to switch out one of the three appetizers. We chose to try the meatballs which my boyfriend said were just okay. We decided to give it one more shot and ordered the homemade gnocchi and the lobster ravioli. We had two bites each and just asked to get it wrapped. I have to say that the service was great, but the food needs work. We will not be returning."

My car and another were broken into while attending a wedding party at Carlucci in Downers Grove. Meanwhile two valets were standing around inside talking to the hostesses.  The responding officer said that he&#39;d covered three break-ins there himself in six weeks, who knows how many other break-ins have been handled by other officers. When I told the restaurant staff that they have a security problem, the valet told me it wasn&#39;t his job to watch the parking lot.  There&#39;s clearly a pattern of break-ins at Carlucci and the restaurant is at best unresponsive or indifferent.  Why not have idle staff walk the lot when you know your patrons&#39; cars have been broken into?  The manager on duty did his best to handle the situation, but there&#39;s clearly a lack of communication at the management level across shifts and the &#34;not my problem&#34; attitude of the valet only served to further deteriorate the incident.

In fairness, the party was quite enjoyable until the police showed up.  The food was good and the waitstaff was professional and clearly enjoyed their work.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s not nearly worth the risk.  If you go, do not park on the side or in the back.  If the front lot is full, just keep on going, even Olive Garden is preferable to a break-in."

Not only did the great staff work with us from the beginning to end, but throughout the night they were wonderful to our guest. I received so many complements about the food and the drinks. I can&#39;t believe how much food we got at such a great price. 

I believe the name of the room we were in was called the Fountain room and it was gorgeous. The staff was great with helping my wedding party get the place together for the big moment. I wanted a small, intimate wedding and that&#39;s what we got. 

The food was impeccable and my guest got to take home leftovers. The kids loved the pizza. My nephew said that was his favorite part. The linguini pasta dish severed in a wheel of parmesan cheese was outstanding.  I couldn&#39;t finish it so I was happy to take it home. I recommend this place to everyone for any major event.

We arrived and were seated by the hostess with a see-thru skirt and she was clearly wearing a black thong. It was a beautiful night out and we asked to be seated on the patio - she informed us no tables for 5 were set up and didn&#39;t offer to set one. The restaurant was empty. We were given the menu - we had to ask for a wine list and cocktail menu. The waitress was horrible - we had to ask what the specials were and for bread and for parmesan cheese, salt and pepper for the olive oil. It took about about 15 mins to get our drinks, after we asked someone to check on them. The food we ordered was good for the most part. One order of pasta came dry with no sauce on it, so we had to track down someone to bring some sauce.  The desserts were not good at all. We ordered 3 - all of them were mediocre at best - chocolate cake was very dry. Our waitress was non-existent we had to ask anyone we could find for the bill and then again to pay the bill. The manager was walking around filling water glasses. Another table of 5 were seated next to us and unfortunately had the same terrible service, they still hadn&#39;t ordered or received their drinks for about 30 minutes, they requested to speak to the manager.

I suggested having a birthday party here for a dear friend. Three of the people drove in from the city for this affair. It was a Saturday night and the dining room was mysteriously only half full? Our waiter must have just come out of plastic surgery to cover up his lobotomy scar! It&#39;s hard to remember the last time I had someone this ignorant! We ordered our drinks and they came in 10 minutes time. That was all well as we were waiting for the bday girl to show. We ordered a round of appetizers at that time. One of our guests asked if the corciofi fritti were the hearts. He told her they were fried. Right! The apps came 20 minutes later and we chowed down. We had to ask for the waiter to order more as the plates were clearly not going to be enough. That is where the shit started to stick to the fan. They cleared the table and brought the second round. But no one had a dish or silverware. At that point I had already asked for a drink and bread for the second time. So I turned around and took what I needed from the empty table behind me. As we were enjoying each others company I thought that it was about time for our waiter to show his face at our table. I knew what he looked like because for the last half hour he was licking everyone&#39;s ass at the next table. Never wanted get up and punch someone, but this was the time to do it. I asked for a drink for the third time and he told me he put it in already. Is that supposed to mean something to me? I at the same time asked where the bread was. Guess what. It was in as well. He took my order and the two ladies next to me, but was stretching his neck looking over at the next table. He stopped taking our orders and went to that table. WTF people! I got up and he saw me, so he came back to take the rest of our orders. Now I get the same thing every time I come here. Porchetta. Don&#39;t know who was in the kitchen that night, but was soon as they put it in front of me I knew something was wrong. The pork was hard. I even gave some to my friends just to make sure I wasn&#39;t crazy. The were 2 onions, 3 carrots and a plop of mashed that looked like they couldn&#39;t spare it. Now I would be well on my way to happyville by now but I was still on my first drink!!!! So yes, I was alert and annoyed! When we were finished eating, they cleared the table like we had never been there. Then Lino decides to make another appearance. Doesn&#39;t ask if we needed anything or if the meal was ok. He asked if we wanted the check. (So much for the birthday cake) I told he I would love the check and how about that drink. It was brought out by him and was not on the check. I would have paid for twenty of them if I could have drank them with my fucking meal. Not to be rude! But there are about 40 restaurants that I have to pass to come here that I have had zero problems with. That&#39;s for everything C! it&#39;s been nice. 

Note: There was a band playing in the bar. We parked it there for a while. The bartender was excellent and she even brought out a piece of cake for my friend. hats off to her!!!"

First I want to say I&#39;m not that person nor are my husband and I that couple.. We dine out frequently.  Let me also preface it wasn&#39;t the server or the foh fault at all... However we started off with the bocci ball appetizer and it was cold in the center... Got another one and again if was cold in the center... The manager came over and apologized and offered to buy us drinks which we accepted.. We decided to try our luck on a salad... We chose the pear salad... If was tasty but the lettuce was brown... So we sent out back and decided to leave to go somewhere else.. We were hoping for a much better experience and may try it again in the future but needless to say we were sadly disappointed

He treated us rudely, wasn&#39;t willing to compromise at all, and lost 7 customers, all within 10 minutes.

I strongly suggest you think twice about spending your money here when the foods is so/so, the service is slow, and the management is inconsiderate and rude."

Staff-  Good.  4 Stars

Ambiance 3.5 Stars.  Not the best, not the worst, not romantic but nice.

I ordered butternut squash ravioli...sounded really good with crushed amaretto cookies sprinkled on top.  Only problem was when the ravioli came (it looked delicious) it turned out they forgot the filling.  I got a bunch of empty pasta that looked like butternut squash ravioli.  How does a cook not notice the ravioli is empty and send it out of the kitchen???

The staff was very appologetic and nice.  I have to say I would try this place again and hope for a correct dish based purely on the proffesionalism of the staff.

No, I did not opt for a replacement meal...I have seen the movie &#34;Waiting&#34; so I know what happens to food that is sent back.  Not that these guys would do that but it grosses me out."

They offer a few different wines at a penny a glass up to three glasses with the purchase of an entree excluding pizza. Okay, sounds good. Got there and they poured our first glass then took about a year to come back for a second pour and to take our orders. At one point I realized I didn&#39;t have a water glass and the bus person was all kinds of huffy about getting me one. Also, my friend next to me never got a second pour or refill on her water glass. I was also missing a place setting but never attempted to flag down a set and just used a friend&#39;s fork. What. Why. A place with cloth napkins and mood lighting should notice these things.

We had about sixteen people there and they placed bread on the table once. We sat forever after placing our orders to actually get the food. Oh, and it&#39;s ala carte. I was never even asked if I wanted a salad or soup which for the price of their pasta should be included. 

At one point I looked at my friend and said &#34;I&#39;m writing my yelp review in my head and we&#39;re slowly losing stars as the night wears on&#34;. That&#39;s pretty sad but at that point I was at three stars. Then the food came and my pasta was bland, blah, uninspired. I asked my friends how they liked their food and one had the gluten free pizza and said it was terrible. The calamari was chewy. The chicken pasta was rubbery. All this for roughly 18.00 a plate. Then it went down to two stars.

Three hours later it was time to pay and leave and the waiter said he wouldn&#39;t split up our checks. I realize it&#39;s a pain for them, especially with that many people but please. I guess he changed his mind and split them. He stood at the head of the table and called out what people had having no organization to the orders. That&#39;s also how the food came out which sounded something like this, &#34;who had the eggplant pasta&#34;, etc. More on par with a fast food place than fine dining.
Needless to say I won&#39;t be coming back Carlucci. I&#39;m afraid your penny wine idea didn&#39;t work. It got us in the door but I know several that will never come back due to poor follow up."

The servers were extremely friendly and helpful...However the food is where we had an issue. 3 people got the French toast. One persons was burnt to a crisp, another person&#39;s was basically toast with apples on top, and luckily the third persons was great. 3 of us also ordered the chicken parm. All 3 of us agree that it was basically noodles and chicken with tomato paste. No seasoning AT ALL. Another person ordered meatballs, another a chicken dish, and another veal. 3 of us originally wanted the crapes,  which unfortunately they were out of. Oh yes, and the bread before the meal...we got enough bread for each of us to have 1/2 a piece. When we were ready to pay the bill it took our server 4 tries to get our bill correct. We had random stuff on the bill such as a beet salad and a kiddie cocktail, both of which none of us ordered. Make sure to check your receipt before you pay!! Feels like a scam is going on!  I was also kind of concerned about the way some of the staff was dressed...I felt like I was in a strip club. The one bartender was wearing a white lace dress that came JUST below her butt cheeks, and was completely see threw. I mean if she hadn&#39;t been wearing underwear and a bra (which was clearly visible) it would have been x-rated.

Fast forward to now............

I often have girls night dinners out to give everyone a break from life.  I wanted a place that offered a selection and had a nice atmosphere but was affordable so I picked Carlucci&#39;s.

There were only 5 of us.  Two of us are pregnant so not much liquor was going to be ordered.  We were seated at a huge, half circle booth that kept us pretty spaced apart and therefore we had to talk pretty loud to have a conversation which I&#39;m sure annoyed the other customers sitting within ear range.

Bread was brought to the table with no butter, no oil, no cheese, no plates.  We had to ask.

Appetizer was ordered (fried calamari) and took quite some time to get out.  It was good.  Cooked well and good size portion.

Dinner was ordered by everyone.  Couple pasta dishes, a salmon, and I had the 
Pesce al Cartoccio which is the tilapia, shrimp, finfish and veggies baked in parchment paper.

The gals that had pasta (2 with Bolgnesa - 1 with the Sunday Gravy) said they were &#34;ok&#34;.  Nothing special about them at all.

The gal that had the Salmon and I both had the same opinion about our meals..... Bland!!!!!  Nothing at all that I would order again and seeing as how we are both the pregnant ones, a nice meal would of been the highlight of our day!  Instead I ate about 6 bites and packed up the rest for my not so picky husband.

As for the service, there was the server, and then the busser/backup server.  Too many times we were left with empty glasses of water and soda.  Too many requests were left unfulfilled like a couple missed pop orders and lemon for our meals.  It become comical how many things we went without or how long it would take the server to realize &#34;Oh hey didn&#39;t you ask me for such &amp; such like 10 minutes ago?&#34;

It was not the night I had hoped for and I left apologizing to everyone for choosing such a disappointing dinner spot.  I will never go there again nor will any of my friends as it was a very dissatisfying experience."

The atmosphere and lovely Christmas decor makes me want to love this place, but the service and the food quality has me think twice. We went here saturday night for dinner. Our reservations were for 6 at 7:30. The restaurant wasn&#39;t all that crowded upon arrival, but we arrived early and sat in the bar to have a drink while waiting for our table. The bar decor and service was the best of the night-- really put me in the holiday spirit! Too bad it was followed up with the dinning room experience!

Although our waiter was friendly, he was slooooooooow. My boyfriends drinks were constantly empty as we&#39;re others at our table. We ordered a bottle of white wine, no chiller was brought to the table to keep it cold :( We then ordered several appetizers- the calmari was good, the rest were just ok(cheese balls and mushroom app). However, It was a bit aggravating that the one app we were all enjoying was bussed away before we were given the chance to finish it.. Another strike Carlucci!

Then came dinner... Many at our table were eying up a special entree-but to their disappoint our waiter informed us the restaurant was out of that dish and many others. I ended up settling on a pasta dish that I could have made at home. It was extremely bland and for $16.95 came with no meat, shrimp, etc-- was just penne, white wine, spinach and mushrooms. 

When it came to dessert--huge disappointment. Being a group of chocolate lovers, we were all looking forward to the chocolate dessert on special. Surprise surprise, they were out. So we asked for the chocolate lava cake--a carlucci staple on their dessert menu- also out! Really out? On a Saturday at 730 during the holiday season? You would think better preparations would be made. 

Needless to say our group ended up spending over $400. We still left a 20% tip even though the service wasn&#39;t up to par, but hey, tis&#39; the season. Just hopefully our next group outing will be to a more worthy establishment!"

The artichoke appetizer was amazing, but a bit overpriced for the two artichokes that are given.  We also had the zucchini fritti which was pretty bland.  We ordered the whitefish special and the house specialty linguini.  The whitefish was extremely sweet and the linguini was pretty good.  The linguini comes with a fun presentation in a parmesan cheese wheel.  That was the best part!  Overall it wasn&#39;t bad, but wasn&#39;t great either."

We sat outside on the patio and had a great time.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful, and service was attentive - we never had to wait to have wine, water or bread refilled.  The penny wine night is a great promotion - when you purchase an entree you receive up to three glasses of house wine for only a penny each.  We both enjoyed our pastas.  I tried the seafood ravioli (could have been larger) and my husband had the eggplant parm (huge portion!)  We would recommend Carlucci!"

We were disappointed they didn&#39;t have paella available on the night that we visited. It is worth nothing that they only serve that on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Perhaps I missed out on something that would have made my visit better. I probably won&#39;t find out any time soon.

We ordered a couple of appetizers to share at our table, and they were probably the best part of the meal. I ordered several different kinds of tacos for my main meal. Some were better than others, but there were those I didn&#39;t care for at all as well. None of them were your typical tacos. They had choices like lamb, duck, lobster, and other interesting options. You can imagine why some of the tacos didn&#39;t really work. Overall, the food was pretty good though.

It was something different, but not a place I would frequent."

The decor is absolutely darling and looks like something worthy of downtown Chicago. The chips and salsa they serve initially were very good, with a variety of salsa and tricolored chips that were tasty and fresh. The waitress we had was very knowledgeable and peppy, which I appreciated! Our table ordered the chilaquiles, pancakes, tacos, and chicken and waffles. The tacos were really the only thing anyone liked, as the potatoes and beans were heavy, as were the chilaquiles, pancakes, and waffles. The waitress recommended churros, which were yummy, and I think we ought to have taken her advice when we ordered entrees!

The decor is super cute (big animal heads) and the bar looks very capable (we were there for brunch). It might be better at night. Our waitress was great - friendly, spirited, capable. The food... ugh. I ordered chilaquiles, which usually is some variant of corn tortillas cooked up nicely with eggs and chile. This was a pile of fried corn tortillas (greasy) holding up 2 over medium eggs covered with red and green vinegar sauces. Maybe that sauce was supposed to be some kind of salsa but it basically made everything inedible. The potatoes on the side were the frozen, mealy variety. On the advice of the waitress, we ordered churros for dessert. Super sweet cinnamon sugar fried dough (well, I was expecting that) with yucky chocolate and caramel dipping sauces. Stay away from that. Overall a disappointment because the food isn&#39;t great and the decor can&#39;t compensate."

I would highly suggest getting the Sangria, the mango flavor was delicious! 

For dinner, I had 4 tacos for about $13, with no sides. This restaurant is a little pricey but not outrageous. I would probably come back on a week night when they have specials. 

I had short rib, pastor, pollo, and ground beef tacos. The pastor was really spicy! The pollo was definitely the most mild. The meat in the short rib taco was my favorite! All of the meat was high quality and wasn&#39;t fatty. 

I&#39;ve driven past the place many times, I&#39;m glad I finally stopped in!

The place was almost empty but there are several big rooms/areas which swallow up diners. That&#39;s OK.  There are large tables, smaller cozy table as well as outdoor seating.  Also it looks like you can dine at the bar if you wish.

Big menu- lots of tacos, appy sized dished and well as some entrees.  My group mostly chose the tortas. I had the beef short rib which was tasty but messy.  It was dressed with delicious guacamole but also quite a bit of beef fat ( I guess?).  It came with fries with chimichurri which was a nice touch.  Portion was huge for $12.

One of my dining partners had one of the taco samplers. Next time I go I will order that- much lighter but according to her very tasty.

Looks like they have daily drink specials so this might be a great evening spot to go.  Fast courteous service. 

Bill for 5 with just a few soft drinks- $100.

The second you walk in the door you feel like you are on vacation. The food will take your taste buds on the trip you are craving.

I recommend Chef Dudley&#39;s Shared Tasting Menu. The tasting menu gives you the chance to taste a little bit of everything on the menu and gives you options to choose how much you want to try. 

For just $24/person (must have at least two people) we sampled two guacamoles, two salsas, four different types of tacos (each person gets four tacos) and one chef&#39;s dessert. We enjoyed everything we tried but the different types of guacamole were my favorite. 

The tropical drink selection was great. I got the Pomegranate Ginger Habanero Mojito and my husband enjoyed the Clooney Margarita (comes with a taste of celebrity tequila on the side).

I would go back and try more of the tacos as that was the original reason why I went there.  I got lured in to get the lunch special which was good but I should have gotten the tacos so I could try a few of them.  I got the short-rib taco special which included guacamole, salad and beans.  All very good but I want to go back and try some of the other tacos.

The only reason why I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because of 3 reasons.
1.  The food was a bit too salty, gave me a salty after taste for a while afterwards (now I am over sensitive to this because I do not eat a lot of salt)
2.  The tacos fell apart, they should be double wrapped to prevent this
3.  The tacos tasted good but not amazing.  Look at my other reviews to see some of the taco places that I have been to as I love tacos and I am always looking for a great taco place.

I would check them out again as the food was good enough to try again.  Plus they have a great outdoor space"

I arrived with my brother and our friend around 10:30 on a Friday night. The place closes at 11, so we kind of felt bad coming in so late, but my brother, who had been there before, prepped us on what this place was about.

Our waiter was a nice guy. We were ready to order right after being seated, but he disappeared for about 10 minutes... I guess they wanted us to stay past closing?

Anyways, we all wanted tacos, and that&#39;s what we got. I ordered the pollo (which I said like a gringo), short rib, and hongos (mushrooms, cheese, and poblano peppers. I also ordered a side of the wood-grilled vegetables, which were topped with fresco cheese and a balsamic reductions.

My dining companions ordered different types of tacos, so I can&#39;t really comment on them. I will say that my brother ordered the carne asada tacos, which looked amazing!

That being said, my tacos were excellent! If I were to rank them, I would say that the chicken was my favorite, followed by the hongos and short rib.

The tacos are priced from 2.50-4 dollars for a single taco, or 9-15 dollars for four, depending on which meat/seafood you choose.

Everything was so good. I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant, as well as the food. The food came out quickly, and was enjoyed in the same manner. Our waiter was impressed that my brother and I each downed 12 tacos, as well as my side of vegetables. That&#39;s not a lot of food for me... I probably could have ordered 8 more and still not be completely full. I like being not fat, so I stopped.

All in all, an excellent establishment. The waiter came back at 11:05, when we were about done, and apologized that the kitchen was closed and that we wouldn&#39;t be able to have dessert. That wasn&#39;t a problem; I felt bad because we came in so late, but we got out of there as soon as possible.

I can&#39;t wait to go back. I love how such a simple food like tacos can be so good. The prices are a bit high, but since this is a once in a while place, I&#39;ll pay a bit extra."

The ambiance is chic and relaxing and the food is delicious. Plus, they have awesome specials every day of the week!

Barbakoa&#39;s chef is very knowledgeable and does a great job pairing together different unique flavors. These are all the amazing offerings I&#39;ve tried (so far)...

- Empanadas
- Lobster taco
- Shrimp taco
- Carne asada taco
- Slow roasted pork taco
- Guacamole trio
- Mushroom taco
- Ahi tuna ceviche
- Shrimp ceviche
- Four different types of salsa
- Churros with chocolate and caramel
- House margaritas
- White and red sangria

While everything I tried was tasty, my standout favorites by far is the shrimp ceviche, guacamole, carne asada taco, the churros and the house margaritas. You seriously can&#39;t go wrong with those options!

Service has been stellar each time I have dined. Prices are fair and their specials are hard to pass up. Off the top of my head I know they have half off wine on Tuesdays and fish bowl cocktails on Fridays!

Their locations is super convenient being right by the highway. They have a couple different private rooms, high top tables, lower tables, half booths, a full bar, and a beautiful patio with a fireplace. Definitely give Barbakoa a try!

Eat the tacos, yes, but they also make homemade tamales which are also out of this world.

We ordered to share and it was awesome. We shared every plate except I had the shrimp since I ordered those on my own. Skip the shrimp, but I have to say the carne asada was my favorite!

Others we ordered: Pork pibil, al pastor, short rib, rajas con queso and we even started with guacamole!

This place advertises itself as Latin cuisine but I&#39;m not sure what they mean and I&#39;m pretty sure they don&#39;t either. Menu items were heavy on taco variations. They did have a couple menu items. (Empanadas) but it is heavy on tacos.
Upon entering, it was pretty early and only a few were dining. The &#34;Host&#34; decides that he wants to place us in an almost empty restaurant in an open booth right next to a couple of girls. There must have been at least 25 open tables and he decided that this would be a good spot? Only if we knew the other people because we would have been rubbing elbows. Stunod!
OK, that&#39;s out of the way.

 Our server was nice and he was knowledgeable about the menu. I had to order salsa with chips which is always complimentary in Mexican restaurants but here they charge you for a small basket of chips with two shot glass amounts of different salsas. That is called a money grab. It&#39;s also 9 bucks for a small house margarita.

We ordered various tacos. Their tacos are about 70% size wise of a normal taco. I don&#39;t know where they get their tortilla&#39;s, but they were the smallest I&#39;VE EVER SEEN. A three bite taco.

As for the taste of the tacos themselves.........yawn. Nothing special at all. I have had better, much better at a much more reasonable cost. This place is not inexpensive.

It is a nicely decorated place inside, just wish it was better on the food + pricing.

Others may like it more than me. I can&#39;t recommend it. I live in an area where I can get this type food much better at a better price.

Cheers to All"

I&#39;m a sucker for upscale Latin fare  so needless to say I HAD to try this place out. I knew right away when my friends suggested a girls night that I&#39;d have them come here. Now for the review:
Everything from service to atmosphere and drinks is 5 stars. The margs are made fresh and to order; I was pleasantly surprised when I asked for a half sweet marg and they didn&#39;t blink an eye. Love the music they have playing and all of the decorations. That&#39;s probably why I&#39;ll be back. Only reason I gave them a 3 star review was due to the food. The portions were small and bland. I ordered the short rib, chicken and al pastor taco and none of them were delicious. There where no salsas that came with them or even anything out on the table. My friends ordered the donuts for desert and sent them back due to them being hard and flavorless. The server rocked it though because he took them back and suggested the churros which the girls liked. 
Overall come for the comfy, fun atmosphere, decent drinks and good service but don&#39;t get too excited about the food."

And as a beautiful gesture they brought a churros desert for my friend&#39;s birthday!!!"

Only place ever that has a chicken taco I don&#39;t like.

Steak torta is mostly bread. Steak tacos are better than torta but still wouldn&#39;t go back.

No sauce offered...sauce is a must.

Tacos from fire it up restraint make these taste like nothing...guarantee you&#39;ll agree if compare."

I made a reservation on open table and we were seated right away. The food and drink menus were a little overwhelming. I think everyone could find something they would enjoy. 

I ordered a beer to go with the appetizer. The BBQ pork rib bites or &#34;pig wings&#34; are a must have! The portion was a reasonable size and the meat was full of flavor. I will defiantly order this again next time. 

They have a wide variety of tacos and other entrees. I ordered three different tacos--had to save room for dessert! 
Camaron- This was my favorite taco...plenty of sauce and filled with flavor. 
Short Rib- This taco had plenty of meat but I thought it was a little salty. 
Baja- This taco was ok but needed a little sauce or salsa. 

I look forward to trying some of their other tacos and entrees. I ended the meal with the chocolate cake with ice cream. It was a little rich but very good! 

I was happy with our overall visit. The service and speed of dinner seemed right on point. I think I will go back but only during their happy hour."

My friend had a surprise 30th birthday party for his wife here. We were told to get there by 3 pm sharp and we were all there on time. We were escorted to a back room that was beautifully decorated, had a fire place and it was very private  for our group. My friend had ordered our menu for the night which was printed out for us. It consisted of chips with 2 different kinds of guac and 2 different kids of salsa for appetizer. Our entree was tacos, 4 different kinds. We got carne asada, hongos (mushrooms) vegetarian rajas and al pastor. Our side was beans and rice and for dessert we got to sample different kinds of sweets. 
I tried one of the guacs which was delicious! The carne asada tacos were my favorite and my Casa Margarita was deliciousness in a glass. 
My only complaint would be that the service was not so great. We had to keep going out of our room to grab our waitress. The service was slow and they weren&#39;t very attentive. 
Overall this was a great place to have a Sunday afternoon party at. The restaurant is very nice and the food and cocktails were good. My boyfriend and I can&#39;t wait to return and try the rest if the menu."

The customer service at the door was excellent and accommodating. Once we sat down being that it was a Monday night there weren&#39;t many customers in the seated area. However, the waiter never showed up to give water, chips or take our order for the first 15 minutes. 

We then decided to go to the bar. There we sat and ordered the $5 Margarita special. 
Talk about a drink! That drink was a very potent margarita. There we received our food in a short time and had excellent service AT THE BAR. Taco&#39;s were $2.50 - $4 depending on the meat. I especially enjoyed the steak and pollo tacos with the corn. Shrimp tacos were awful! 

When we got the check, the bartender took off our drinks for the inconvenience and the bill was $35 bucks for two with drinks. I will be returning to the BAR ONLY."

The atmosphere was bright, bold, clean, and chic. The colors certainly stood out. Funny they had colored deers head on the restroom doors. I thought the food was pretty good. We had the tasting uno which consisted of 2 salsas, 2 guacamoles, 2 tacos each, and one dessert.  The salsas were ok we had the tomatillo Serrano and the red one. For the guacamoles we had the traditional and chicharron which the chicharron was my fav out of the two. As for tacos we tired: pollo (nice and tender), pastor (kinda dry and pineapple piece was to big), falafel (ok), and shrimp (small pieces cut in half and sauce was too sweet). The dessert we had churros with dulce du leche and chocolate dip nice ending.  The cocktails here are good I had the pomegranate ginger habanero mojito (highly recommended it was delicious) and Caramelized pineapple mojito (too sweet for me), my date had the house margarita (good) and the classic mojito (yummy).

I asked the hostess if there was a special bar menu, and she said no, all the same menu. So we sat in the restaurant, where we read on the menu that there were happy hour specials until 7:00. Our waitress told us those were only in the bar area.  We stayed in the restaurant but we were irked because it seemed to us that the hostess should have acknowledged the happy hour specials in the bar, when I asked.

Luckily by the time we walked home, we sobered up enough to grab the other car, drive back and get the SUV. 

Damn that was a lot of sangria. Those things should come with a warning label. BTW: We got the pineapple and it was seriously tasty. And it didn&#39;t taste like cheap bathtub liquor that burns more than it tastes good. So it went down smooth and we didn&#39;t even realize we were getting lit till oops, surprise, we were.

As far as the food? Eh. I&#39;ve been here twice, once for a yelp event where we got to sample a little bit of everything, and neither time was I very impressed with the food. Last night I tried the short rib tacos and the duck tacos. The latter which were pretty good. The short rib? They were just dry and not very flavorful. We also shared the tres leches cake for dessert. It was good, but not the best I&#39;ve had. We also grabbed the pineapple guacamole, which sounds (and costs) a lot more than it&#39;s worth. You get a small glob of the stuff with some diced pineapple on top. I remembered liking that a lot more when we came here for the Yelp event a year ago. 

Kelly, the hostess was super polite, helpful and friendly when I called to inquire about available outdoor seating. Unfortunately they didn&#39;t have the real patio open for the season yet (which she didn&#39;t actually tell me) but they have kind of a screened porch thing on the opposite side, which is where we sat. And truthfully, after that Fishbowl, I don&#39;t think I could tell the difference anyway.

Great service, great drinks. Mediocre food. I think I&#39;d come back for some patio drinking and maybe a snack, but other than that I&#39;d skip it."

Yay! This is not your traditional Latin cuisine, they had some variations on traditional dishes and I thought the worked very well.  I love the set up of the place, the decor is really great and the service was friendly without being intrusive. 

We started with drinks and an appetizer. I ordered a margarita Fuerte, and the alcohol amount was just right. He ordered a Moscow Mule and really like it. They also had &#39;Nojitos&#39; which is their Mojitos but without the spirits. (Great idea!) 

The piña guacamole was amazing! I don&#39;t know why I never thought about putting pineapple in the guac, but it is delicious. We ended up doing a tasting tray, and it was more than enough food for both of us! It was really fun trying out the different dishes :)

I also had the churros for dessert, and they are heavenly. Chrunchy but not burned and just soft enough. You can put as much caramel or/and chocolate on them as you want. As a churro lover, I approve! :D

We are going back for brunch this week and I&#39;m looking forward to updating this review!"

I did just that! I ate here Tuesday night. partly inspired by the $1.50 taco&#39;s (and by partly I mean 99%) and the $3 select draft&#39;s (Stella Artois Cidre  was the pick for that night....apple cider and no I didn&#39;t spell it wrong CIDRE lol) which I thought was pretty good as it was my first time trying it) Tried 6 different tacos they were overall good and each one had its own flavor. One was a little dry. The decor is pretty chick, It kind of feels like Will Smith &#34;Welcome to Miami&#34; music video. So grab a shot of tequila and enjoy your stay.

I ordered the $12 lunch special in which you get to choose from either 2 tacos, 2 tortitos (not sure what this is) or tamales. Tacos come in four different available fillings which are chicken, short rib, shrimp or fish, I chose the 2 short rib tacos. It also comes with a choice of one side (I chose the white rice w/poblano peppers) and tortilla soup or salad (I chose the tortilla soup) and a side of guacamole. Everything was really good except the short rib needed more seasoning, something a little salt took care of and the tacos need to be doubled up because they fell apart really quick which was annoying. The white rice was great and  the tortilla soup was even better. Great filling lunch for $12. They give you chips and salsa as well. We ordered the churro dessert which came with 2 different dipping sauces. Nice ending to a pretty darn good lunch with my daughter."

I loved my food the first time here I really did. But the fish hook just was unacceptable. Anyhow, I called at 9:45 very late and talked to Xavier and referenced the fishhook he immediately apologized and was profusely sorry for no one reaching out to me. Thank you Xavier for your kind and professional service. 

I ordered the trilobites bites which were grilled calamari loops, jumbo scallops ++, U-60 shrimp eh, and a sort of orange chicken style breaded cod. If they rid the breeding and focused on the  scallops this dish would be top notch. It had guacamole as a dipping sauce. The lobster tacos had a nice style minced lobster meat. You could definitely see the lobster cuts and taste the freshness.

The churros were not too greasy just perfect with the chocolate dipping sauce. I&#39;ll gladly return."

It&#39;s been a while since we visited Barbakoa and the experience was less than pleasant. We were seated by what appeared to be a MIT, who wore jeans and a white button up, while donning diamond studs in each ear. He truly meant well, but needs a serious polish to fit the restaurant vibe.  

My bestie and I ordered a mixture of tacos, corn, brussel sprouts and a tamale - all which should have taken 12 mins to prepare and get out the kitchen. Our tacos took 37 minutes. Mind you the restaurant was half full at this time. 

Our server, who was inundated with a 20something top and several other tables checked in randomly but walked past us several times when we tried to flag her down. We stupidly ordered desert after the lengthy wait for dinner and Barbakoa kept their promise again - 19 minutes for churros. When we asked our server about desert she said I&#39;m going to comp that for your long wait, which at this point was a low ball gesture. 

Not sure if this place changed ownership but your current quality of management, service and efficiency output is beyond horrendous. 

Hopefully you can get it together because your food is decent."

Starting off with the hostess, 10 minute wait. Ok, she tried sitting me and my friend in the back. Next time she should ask if we have a preference. We chose the bar area instead. She said ok, ill have to check in with the server. We ended up seating ourself in that area.

Atmosphere, very pretty inside. Bar like. Neon animals hanging on wall. Velvet booths/high stools. Cute. 

Anyways, let&#39;s get to the tacos. Pricey. Small. Lots of options. No sides come with.

Ordered the falafel, ground beef, and chicken. You can&#39;t do the 4 for $9 if you wanna mix your tacos. That was pretty lame. Even the sever said that was a downfall.
Very small tacos, but pretty ingredients in side. Definitely with they were bigger or they served chips and salsa. Was hungry a few hours after. Slammed 3 tacos.

Charged me for seltzer water too, without mentioning it. Downfall. 

Wouldn&#39;t come again for the small tacos. Maybe for a weekend night with friends. But can get pricey!



Update: Came here on my birthday and server served me free churro a with chocolate and Carmel dip. Churro were so sugary though. Awesome free treat to try!"
barbakoa-tacos-and-tequila-downers-grove,Shaheen R.,lvfQ-j_lAXJxW93la3Tn_Q,"Villa Park, IL",0,1,1,18,4,i_h2Ou4jvBbevp21YHWrcg,5.0,2015-08-30,"While I&#39;m not one to normally repeat restaurants, this one is an exception. I&#39;ve been here twice prior in the previous year but decided to lay low for a while so I wouldn&#39;t get sick of it. Smart choice. Because when I came back today with a friend I noticed there was quite a bit of additions to the menu!

Background: Barbakoa is the lovechild concept restaurant brought to you by makers of Buona Beef-- which coincidently is what Barbakoa used to be!

Decor: Eclectic, colorful, yet refined and bright. Lots of windows, and lots of Birds of Paradise plants. Deep cherry wood tables, and comfortable, colorful leather chairs. Porcelain molds of antler heads dipped dyed in wonderful neon hues. 

Food: If you&#39;re going to go here, don&#39;t order ala carte! Go for one of the tasting menus. We opted for the &#34;Tasting Dos&#34; which for $29 gave us the choice of 2 guacamoles, 2 salsas, 2 ceviches, 4 tacos, 2 sides, and a dessert platter. In actuality its less than $29 because if you check into yelp you get 10% off!

A) Guacamoles: We opted for Traditional and Pina. Traditional hit all the right notes. Pina on the other hand, was a disloyal mistress that tantalized your taste buds with the pineapple, teased with overtones of and lime. left you in blissful habanero agony, and swore to never to do this to you again with after notes of cucumber. Yet for some reason, Pina was addictive and despite KNOWING what she did to you, you did it again and again with each bite. 9/10, 9/10.

B) Salsas: Morita and Arbol. Morita, despite being a &#39;mild&#39; salsa, is much more than your &#34;girl next door&#34;. Morita is smoky, and alluring to any palate. Her flavors smoldered together with the fire roasted tomatoes, and keep you wanting more. On the other hand is Arbol. If Arbol was a zodiac sign, Arbol would be a Scorpio. Arbol is spicy-- nay, Arbol is the definition of spicy. Arbol is hot, but curbs the fiery dance on your palate with notes of sweet pineapple. Luring your tastebuds into a false sense of security, before igniting the fire and heat that comes from the roasted tomatillos. 10/10, 10/10

C) Ceviches: Shrimp and Amarillo Mixito: Shrimp Ceviche was exquisite. Mexican gulf shrimp bathed in passion fruit-rocoto ají leche de tigre, tied together with choclo, red onions and cilantro. It&#39;s said if you close your eyes as you let the passion fruit rococo aji wash over your tongue you&#39;ll hear angels sing. Try it. Amarillo Mixito; the controversial union of octopus, shrimp, yellow aji leche con tigre and toasted cancha, with beckon with a &#34;come hither&#34; to only the most daring taste buds. Amarillo&#39;s spice palate is not for the weak. 10/10, 9/10.

D) Tacos: Pollo, Lamb, Cameron, Rajas con Queso. All tacos on in house made corn torillas, or sub for bibb lettuce. Pollo was juicy, yet kept your taste buds guessing with the contrast of the clean fresco to the smoky tinga sauce. Lamb; slow cooked and marinated, with complex red curry. Cameron; a favorite. Asian slaw, tamarind-morita salsa on top of tempura fried shrimp. EXCELLENT. Rajas con Queso; it could easily turn be vegan in a heart beat. Fire roasted Poblanos, cubed potatoes under a respectable portion of manchego. A beam of light from the heavens spotlighted on this taco as I ate it. 7/10, 8/10, 9/10, 10/10.

E) Sides: Elote, White Rice: Beautiful, clean, modern presentations. Piping hot with the perfect amount of spices and cheese. 9/10, 8/10.

F) Dessert: Fresh churros with chocolate and tres leches dipping sauce, a scoop of dulce de leche ice cream atop candied peptias. The chocolate sauce I did not like. Tasted straight of out a hershey&#39;s syrup bottle. The churros while fresh, were coated with WAY too much sugar (spent a lot of time brushing sugar off; our table looked like a sugar factory explosion). But the ice cream atop the pepitas was the STAR. For the ice cream alone the dish gets a 10/10!

Service: Our glasses were never empty, and the service was always timely. But nothing above and beyond that stands apart from the crowd. 4/5

Notes: (1) Tons of excellent Vegan options! (2) Baby changing station in the bathroom is AMAZING (See pics). Not the ridiculous plastic fold down table. 

TL;DR: Get the tasting menu or DON&#39;T BOTHER. Get the full experience! Tasting Dos is $29 pp (minimum 2 people) + Get 10% off with yelp check in. Spicy means 911 is on speed dial; proceed with caution. Get: Shrimp Ceviche, Pineapple guac, Rajas con Queso and Cameron tacos. Tacos can be made with bibb lettuce to low carb. Menu constantly changing, come back every year-ish."

Service: very sweet but VERY VERY VERY slow. Had to wait 15 minutes to order our drinks. Got our apps before our drinks. Never checked on us after entrees were delivered.

Food: YAWN. We got the four different salsas which each were pretty one-dimensional. Not much depth or flavor to each. For example, the habanero salsa was just hot and had no other flavor. I was super excited for the guajillo chicken but it had zero flavor - add some salt or pepper at the least?

Drinks: read creatively but they all seemed to pack WAY TOO MUCH sugar into each. My smokey margarita was more sweet than smokey."

I called ahead and made a reservation for four women and a high chair. When I talked to the girl on the phone she told me they had a $1.50 taco special. I asked if it was only good at the bar and she told me no, you would do it throughout the restaurant. Sounded like it was going to be the perfect night. 

Fast forward to that Monday night and we get the the fairly empty restaurant for our reservation. The table isn&#39;t ready and there is no high chair. They seemed confused by my second request for a high chair.

When we asked about the specials for the night we were told there was a special on mojitos, which we all jumped right in and ordered. When I asked about the taco special, I was told it was a &#34;bar only deal&#34;. I told our waitress that the girl on the phone told me that it was throughout the restaurant. That was partially why we chose the restaurant. She kind of shrugged it off.

Some of the tacos here are pre prepared, so you cannot ask for ingredients to be removed for dietary reasons.   Most of the tacos we at were yummy. The lobster taco fell short. For $6 a small taco, you get mostly cabbage.the bill adds up quickly since tacos are $3-$6 each and the average person eats about four (and an appetizer like guacamole, salsa or ceviche). 

They did bring out a free birds u dessert, so that was a plus. 

Don&#39;t think I will be back for a while."

However, the worst part of our party&#39;s experience was the service. We had called in advance to see if the party&#39;s checks could be split. We were told this would be possible. When asking our server of this possibility at the end of our meal, however, our server instructed us to write our what we ordered on the back of the total check for everyone. After doing this, we were then informed they could not take more than 6 cards for one order and we would have to figure out another way of paying for the food.

This entire process took about an hour to complete after receiving the check and the wait staff was of extraordinarily little support. If we took the effort to see if splitting the check would be possible in advance and are then told this is not possible, the restaurant should at the very least be slightly more helpful. 

An overall disappointing experience and I do not attend to ever go back to Barbakoa."

In the end I decided to try the tacos because this seems to be one of their main specialties. 

I ordered the 4 piece taco meal which alone was $13, however I thought Tuesday&#39;s were $1.50 tacos but our waiter failed to mention that. Maybe it&#39;s just for the bar area. Anyways, I just wanted three tacos (chicken, pastor, and baja), but he said I can only get the 4 taco meal with one or two kinds of meats so was a bit disappointed. So I ended up getting the 4 taco meal with chicken and baja (fish) tacos for my choices. 

The tacos are small, but they do fill you up. The Baja fish tacos reminded me of the Cheesecake&#39;s Factory&#39;s fish tacos. They tasted very similar - they put a bit too much cream sauce on them though. I really liked the chicken, they were really moist, juicy, and had a nice flavor to it. The tacos were topped with cilantro. I wanted a side of beans and rice, but thought that would be too much so I just got the side of rice which was fine. It came with cheese on it. I noticed a lot of things on the menu have cheese on it. I wanted a veggie to balance my meal and those even had cheese on it! 

My friend and I also got the pitcher of Sangria - pomegranate and blood orange which is made in-house. It was pretty good, tasted like regular sangria. It wasn&#39;t that strong but didn&#39;t really need it that strong with a whole pitcher. Maybe if you wanted a glass though. 

Overall, it&#39;s a little &#34;americanized&#34; which I expected to begin with but I wanted to try it. Would I come back often, no - not for those high prices. The total bill was $60 something for 4 tacos and rice we each ordered and a pitcher of sangria. It just isn&#39;t worth it when I can get better tacos for $1.50 somewhere else! It&#39;s mostly a hip place for people to hang out after work or on the weekend. It has a nice lounge vibe to it. However, compared to other &#34;americanized&#34; Latin restaurants in the area (ehemm Uncle Julio&#39;s), I would recommend this one. The food was pretty good, but you just pay a little more. 

Another note - the parking lot is very small. Some people parked in the other lot, but you risk being towed."

It is such a cool vibe at night and has delicious tacos!  They have a $2 taco night (Tuesdays in the bar area).  They also make some delicious cocktails and margaritas.  We have also dined outside.  We have hosted large parties (my husband&#39;s birthday was at least 15-20 people), which they were happy to accommodate with a reservation.  Then, we also came for brunch which was awesome!  I will say that it does seem pretty overpriced, but we&#39;ve come back enough times that we obviously think it&#39;s worth it.  If you&#39;re in the mood for a Latin vibe in the western suburbs, I&#39;d highly recommend it!"

With hopes of trying it again I rounded up to 4 stars. It was the kind of place my hubby and I immediately agreed to try again. Why? One reason is location, the other is quality of menu items we did try. We popped in tonight after furniture shopping (because who doesn&#39;t need a margarita after that?). We sat at the bar because it&#39;s where I decide on the caliber of bar tenders and atmosphere. We consider ourselves margarita lovers. Favs in the burbs are Oak Parks Maya del Sol and Geneva or Glen Ellyn Toda Madre. Their margarita menu was interesting. We tried three-the Casa Maragarita, the Aphrodesiac, and the Barbakoa. All use an agave hector sweeter that left a very earthy honey flavor aftertaste. The Aphrodesiac was too tart and we didn&#39;t enjoy it though our bartender did offer to adjust it for me. They do score points for quality and presentation. If I could get same drink with simple sugar I think it would be a winner. Hubby tried the tuna ceviche which was very nice. I tried the chips n salsa-very nice. Fresh and hot and salsa as described in menu. I had to try the churros and they were outstanding!! We will go back for one of the nightly specials. Service was excellent and ambience casual and well done. Looking forward to eating our way through the menu!"

Definitely a breath of fresh air in the suburbs, and a great departure from your standard chain restaurant.

Food: B+
Great Latin fare. We had two vegetarians in the group so it was nice to see that there were several options for them on the menu. they started with the spinach and cheese empanadas were perfectly fried and came with a delicious chimmichurri sauce. They also shared a variety of the vegetarian tacos which were good, but nothing special. 

Between the meat-eaters, we tried the pozole soup and the cubano sandwich. The pozole was a special for Mother&#39;s Day Brunch and had a great flavor, but there was very little pork in it. I did appreciate that it came with a bunch of fresh garnish on the side. The Cubano was delicious and came with crispy chimmichurri fries which were a highlight.

The presentation of the food was wonderful as well- everything looked great.

Service: B+
Our server was not particularly engaging, but the pace of service was appropriate and there were no major issues.

Atmosphere: A
Beautiful, colorful restaurant. We especially liked the natural wood tables.

We would definitely come back here- this I a great place for a big group as well!"

Their house made margaritas are amazing, when they remember the tequila. Go on Thursdays when they are only $5! I&#39;ve been 3 times, and have had the awesome, friendly waiter, the over-seller waiter, and the waitress who had more important things to do than help us. 
Their tacos are great, and I love their half roasted chicken and chimichurri fries! Their steak was a bit bland. 
Atmosphere is really great- very urban, hip, cool. 
Oh, and their chips and salsa are below par. You also only get like 2 tablespoons of smooth salsa (I&#39;m guessing from a jar). 
I haven&#39;t given up on this place yet, but I&#39;m not clammering to go back either..."

We had reservations and were seated right away. Our waitress greeted us just seconds after we sat down with water and a little introduction to the menu and specials since we were newbies. She was very, very nice and knowledgeable about all of the food! 

Within minutes, we ordered our margaritas (of course!) and selections for the small plates. Since everything on the menu is meant to be shared, we decided to get the traditional guacamole, crab ceviche (a V-Day special), two empanadas (though we ordered one veggie empanada and one meat empanada, and received two meat empanadas instead), and pork in verde tamales (but in a red sauce, not verde sauce? Still good, though). After we finished these dishes, we ordered the carne asada tacos. We did not order dessert, but received two complimentary chocolate covered strawberries after receiving our check. 

Everything tasted very good, though we were a little taken aback by how small the portions truly were! The tamale order included &#34;4&#34; tamales, however it was more like &#34;2&#34; tamales cut in half, and the order of 4 tacos was actually 4 taquitos - really tiny little tacos on tiny little corn tortillas. For the cost of each plate, we expected to get a little more... Which is why we had to order the tacos in the end, because we weren&#39;t full from the previous shared dishes.  

Overall, it was a good experience, but this restaurant was way pricier than somewhere we would normally go. Maybe we&#39;d go back for a special occasion if we happened to be in the area, but I can&#39;t see us returning on just any Saturday evening unless it was just for quick appetizers and drinks."

Decided to check it out on a whim without reading through the reviews. First thing I noticed.... The parking lot was empty so I had to check their hours to see if they were open. They were... Which means either this place sucks or its super expensive. My boyfriend and I sat outside. A good runner served us water. Waitress comes up- let&#39;s call her mumbles. Honestly, we couldn&#39;t even understand her name because she was so quiet and depressing (which is worse because the music is loud).  Her service wasn&#39;t necessarily bad, but it just got awkward. No smiles. No enthusiasm. But then- my tortilla soup sucked, not my favorite, and she didn&#39;t come back to check on us until my boyfriend was completely done with dinner. Our tacos were super soggy as if they sat out for a while so they ripped apart wen we tried to eat it. We would have ordered another drink but our waitress never checked on us (which remember the restaurant was empty).

Just totally awkward experience and way too pricey for that type of service."

We sat at the bar.... So we can watch the Bulls game.... We were seated at the very end corner which was fine.... We can watch the game which was perfect.... 

Our female bartender was kinda slow.... Not getting us water when we asked or not checking in on us not unless we call her.... Grrr.... 

She gave us a check not checking first if we want dessert.... Hellooooo? 
Isn&#39;t that a given? to ask? Clearly not customer friendly....

Another drawback is this guy.... I&#39;m assuming he is the owner... Short skinny Caucasian guy...

Two feet away from us.... Like we have plague or something.... Duh.... Just talked.... Not even said HI... Just said and I quote.... &#34;When we built this restaurant.... We wanted the ladies to have space to put their purses... So they have actual space at the bar to eat....So we put these hooks right under the bar close to your knee..... &#34;

I was looking at him in disbelief like.... 
Do you think we are deaf? 
Or do you think we are stupid? 
I mean, why was he like emphasizing words like we are retarded?! Ohmygod!!!

First off.... My purse was not bothering any other guest and clearly not bothering me since it&#39;s right in front of me....

Second of all.... The nicest way that he could&#39;ve done it.... Is to just tapped my shoulders.... Maybe apologize for disturbing our dinner... Maybe say... &#34;Miss... I&#39;m sorry to bother you guys, I&#39;m not sure if you have been here before but we have a purse hook under the bar if you want to use it &#34;

That would&#39;ve have NOT offended me at all....

Clearly his theatrics was just annoying and definitely buzz kill.... Gaaaaaaaaah!!!!

Sooooo after his stupid spiel .... I told him.... &#34;So is that a hint hint wink wink.... You should&#39;ve not wasted so much of your time..... &#34;

As I put my not so common expensive Louis Vuitton bag on the purse hook... My BF accidentally knee-d it and it fell on the dirty floor.... Shit... Those hooks don&#39;t work Mister!!!!

The only salvation of this place last night.... Is this super friendly African American tall guy... I&#39;m not sure if he is a bartender or a bar back..., he is super friendly .... Showed us a display of the desserts ... 
That&#39;s the kind of customer service they need .... Friendly and sincere... These other girls at the bar looks so phony.... Ugh

Never again .... I will miss you Tamarind Glazed Short Ribs.... But you alone will not be enough to bring me back here....."

It&#39;s a fun place and the different Latin flavors/influences means the food is fun too.

We went with our BFF&#39;s, sat on the enclosed patio (all the windows open) and enjoyed the beautiful night. Adam was having some Five Rabbits and the ladies loved the Imperial Margaritas!

We had the Trio Guacamole to get started, they were all good, The Pina (with Habanero) was my favorite, really liked the Chicharon too (with crispy pork is what the menu says.. I say PORK RINDS will give you a better understanding of the flavor/texture) .. after those two,  the traditional seemed a touch bland.. but still good.

We skipped over all of the appetizers because we were hot for tacos and a couple of the larger plated servings (Platos) to share.

We ordered a big ass plate of tacos.. four types, 16 in all. Lisa was full before she tasted them all.. I, however, was just getting warmed up.

So, for the tacos... we had the specials; Cactus and Lobster along with the Pastor (pork) and Camaron (shrimp). The waitress said that the Cactus was her favorite (so did the server) but we thought they were just OK. the lobster only comes with three, so we had to add an extra just to keep things fair (I am NOT sharing) and the lobster was tasty but a bit lacking in the lobster department... I liked them better than some of the others. The pastor tacos were excellent, the pineapple really added to the flavor. The shrimp tacos were a big surprise, the tamarind flavoring gave these awesome tacos a flavor that had us all thinking about some Chinese orange chicken... but in a really good way. They were the favorite at the table.. and I&#39;m not a big fan of shrimp. Go figure.

For our main dishes (shared): 

We had the Entraña Asada. Skirt Steak prepared Mexican style.. the sauces and sides were excellent, the steak was done perfectly.

We also had the Paella Valenciana which had pork, chicken and artichokes. My friends mixed the almost raw egg up into it after I took a portion. This was good, not inspiring, but good. We all particularly liked what the chokes brought to the table.. flavor and texture wise.

Everybody was stuffed and groaning.... so we ordered dessert. We couldn&#39;t decide on what to get, so we got the sampler. That was a good move. Everything was delicious. Strangely, the one thing that we weren&#39;t excited about surprised us.. the passion fruit cheesecake... it was very good and we all had a bad attitude about it going in.

The ladies both had the (After Hours?) cocktail.. this is basically an espresso martini using tequila... they liked them although Janet thought they were a little strong (is that a bad thing?) Adam also ordered an aged tequila that was meant to be sipped.. so he did. He&#39;s sophisticated like that.

One of the really positive things that I take away from our experience, is that we were often surprised and sometimes delighted. The service was very good, we liked the waitress and the server&#39;s... we were well cared for. It&#39;s not quite a five star experience, but it was an excellent one and we would all go back again in a heartbeat."

Nice dining room and lighting highlights the artsy decor. We went on a Taco Tuesday night and ordered one of all of them, also tried the tamale and the guac. The flavors were very fresh. I liked the thai inspired fish taco and the carne asada is their recommended one. Pretty good.  Lobster was unique too. The tamale left much to be desired--too much masa and I&#39;n not even a latina but I know too much masa when I see it. The side of guac was good topped with chicharones. I have to say even thought they try to be out of the box --nothing really jumped out and shocked me as a wow taco. Also a mexican inspired place with salsas that were forgettable is unfortunate.  I love the look and the idea of a twist on Mexican and the bar is cool and hip looking---but it&#39;s almost like too many flavors hit you all at once and everything tastes the same. A+ for the effort for having a unique menu and A+ for service---our servers were wonderful ---really nice guys. . Plenty of parking.  I&#39;d go back for the atmosphere but because of the pretty pricey menu which made every effort but was short on wow factor I give it ,apologetically, 3 stars.

The place was packed, but we did see some empty tables outside.  I asked the hostess if we could sit outside, and she said no.  Not that they were reserved or anything...just &#34;No&#34;.  I thought that was kind of weird and rude, but oh well.

Once seated at our table inside, we decided to go with the Tasting Dos menu and red sangria.  I hated the sangria.  I felt bad about hating it, because all the other tables around us seemed to be enjoying the sangria, but I hated it.  It tasted way too sweet, and we didn&#39;t get much fruit in ours.  Outside of that, the food was extraordinary.  We went with the traditional guacamole, the morita and serano salsas, the shrimp and tuna seviches, pork pibil and pastor tacos.  Everything was so delicious and fresh!  The meat for the tacos was so flavorful, and the marriage of ingredients in the seviches was tantalizing.  We even had a tres leches cake at the end.  There was so much food, but I ate it all because it was so good!

Parking is tight but they do have a valet. Restaurant ambiance is dim lit and the bar area has  Tv&#39;s incase you want to catch a game. Personally I feel as if the drinks are on point but the food is average. I do recommend the skirt steak or going in on 1.50 taco Tuesdays. They do have a side bar with a lot of windows to give you an outdoor feel while still enjoying heat or ac in the summer. Wait staff was incredible and offered sufficient advice.

First, this is a cook place to have a drink for the least.  Very nice bar, a lounge area and two separate outside sitting area.

We got the Pina Guac, Fish tacos, and Paella. And definitely a pint of passion-ginger Sangira for sharing. High recommend the Pina Guac which is rich and fresh with the perfect combination of sweetness of Pineapple dices and spicy kicks from the jalapeno. This time I tried different unbreaded fish tacos still didn&#39;t meet my expectation. The Paella was a real treat.  Fresh meaty seafood with the just right seasoning. The rice could be a bit more cooked since I like the golden brown crust on the bottom. It was delicious anyway. We finished every bit of it.

The desert is one of my all-time favorites: flourless chocolate cake which was 3 mini ones just for three of us. Heavy, sweet, and unavoidably guilt taste.
 
We were really happy with our waitress who was happy and seemed enjoying her job very much. Definitely a nice place to hang out with a glass of Sangria. Don&#39;t forget to checked in on Yelp to unlock 10% discount!"

I made our reservation on Open Table for 5:45. We were sat as soon as we arrived. I initially found out about this place when we came to look at it for a potential shower venue. I loved the decor, but ultimately we decided that the room was too small for our group. However, I definitely wanted to come back to eat! We had a great experience!! We sat in the bar area at one of the high-tops, perfect atmosphere for a Saturday night! The music was at a good volume level and everything was very lively! 

For dinner, we decided to do the tasting menu - which I highly recommend! We did the Tasting Tres menu. There was plenty of food, and we got to taste a ton of different stuff!

Guacs: Traditional, Pina, Chicaron- All were very good! My fave was the Pina and Chicaron! 

Salsa: Morita (mild), Serrano (medium), &amp; Arbol Pineapple Salsa (spicy). I actually thought the Serrano was hotter than the Arbol, but they were all tasty!! The Arbol Pineapple had just the right amount of sweetness to balance the heat. 

Ceviches: Shrimp and Tuna - they were both very good, but the Tuna was fabulous!! Such great flavors!!

Tacos: Short Rib, Carne Asada, Baja, and Pollo. All of these choices were amazing. IF I had to rank them as my favorites, I would say Short Rib, Baja, Carne Asada, and Pollo. The first three are are a very close tie, as they all had soooooo much flavor!! You probably cannot go wrong with any of their choices!!

Sides: Sautéed brussel sprouts with Manchego cheese and pequillo sauce, White rice, fresco cheese with epazote, Wood-grilled vegetables with a balsamic reduction and shaved Manchego cheese - all three were amazing! Even the rice, I was like, how flavorful could this rice actually be? Well, it was really really good. The brussel sprouts were ta-die-for. 

Dessert: Not sure of it&#39;s actual name, but it was a little piece of heaven. I am the pregnant one of the group, and I definitely at the majority of it- it was an amaretto soaked cake of sorts. WOW! 

This is one of the best meals that I have had in the burbs in a while!! The drinks were also beautiful - my friends got mojitos and margaritas - beautifully done! Our server (Juan) was great!

I came here after hearing rave reviews from friends.  We were here on a Saturday around 7 and it wasn&#39;t too busy.  There were more people here when we left.

We had a reservation and were seated promptly but it took awhile for a server to stop by and that was the way it went the rest of the night.  We ordered drinks and waited, food and waited, asked for the check and waited.

The food was good.  We got the guacamole and salsa with pineapple and it was tasty!  We got tacos and the chimichurri fries and had some dessert too.  I had the flourless cake and hubby had the cheesecake.  Everything was good and just the right size.

The music was loud and the bass was booming and it seemed like it got turned up around 7:30.  At first it was ok for talking but towards the end it was just too loud.  So waiting for the checking, dealing with the music wasn&#39;t the best way to end our meal."

Oh and what they fail to tell you when you walk in on Mondays or Tuesdays that if you sit in the dining room tacos aren&#39;t $1.50. They try to scam you by putting it in really tiny print on the chalk board. So make sure you sit in the bar area on Mondays or Tuesdays if you want $1.50 tacos! This place is just OK.

1, the menu is way too confusing. Actually it is all pretty mis-leading. I don&#39;t think people want to try or think THAT hard just to order some tacos. People want to come relax and chat with their party, not decode the menu or listen to a long spiel from the waitress on how to order, which ultimately made no sense anyway lol. It was very difficult to order because of the layout of the menu, the different combos make no sense, and we had no clue as to the portion sizes (maybe they should put some images of the food/portions on their menu and simplify it a bit).  I just ordered tacos and a margarita because I didn&#39;t know what was going on and my boyfriend ordered a mixed bag and hoped for the best!
2, more on the waitress, she rambled off the menu spiel super fast. She was really unhelpful and unfriendly. Totally not what you would expect, even for a tapas type of place.
3, the margaritas are tiny and over priced. Tapa margaritas? You can get a bigger, better tasting/less expensive margarita at Pepe&#39;s! 
4, the tacos were very bland! Apparently they don&#39;t use any salsa? Not sure where the cheese was. And they were super soggy with chicken juice. Had to eat them with a knife and fork because they fell apart. The taco consists of a thin mini tortilla with bland pulled chicken smacked on top. Can&#39;t say it wasn&#39;t moist, though lol! They charged me like a dollar for a small cup of sour cream which is bogus considering the prices and ended up not needing it because the food tasted heat-less/spice-less.
My boyfriend&#39;s Tamales were pretty big (strange, considering the size of the taco) and also bland except for this bbq-like salsa? that they poured on top which had a bitter flavor (ew). He and I agree his was just not tasty either.  Can&#39;t remember what else he got, but I assure you, we were not impressed. I think we just ate everything because we were really hungry and figured we had to pay for it anyway so we might as well finish eating it. No joke.  
5, Over-Priced!
On a positive note, the atmosphere was neat and the host (manager?) was pleasant."

Started off with drinks. My wife had the sangria flight which alone on presentation is nice. Tasted good. Being a craft beer snob I had to have their exclusive Two Brothers BPA (Barbakoa Pale Ale). Very smooth pale ale not found anywhere but here at restaurant...not even at Binnys or Brewery! 

We began our meal with trio guacamole...pineapple guacamole was my favorite. Tortilla soup was spot on. Wife had tacos Al pastor and I indulged in a combo of fish and shrimp tacos. Tacos are small but stacked! You get 4 little tacos so I had 4 more lol of short rib aka barbacoa...very succulent!  Potato side was good too! 

We had no room BUT I was not leaving until I tried the homemade stuff your own donuts dessert. You literally get 4 small tubes of fudge, caramel, guava, and raspberry to stuff your warm fresh donut. I loved this! Skip lunch and indulge on all the small plates they offer!!! Enjoy!"

Sangria Trio - It was okay, but I&#39;ll try other flavors next time.

Guacamole Trio - This was good, bit not rave worthy.
 
Steak and Eggs - My guy asked for medium, but it was more medium well, but it was still tender.

Baja Tacos - First time having fish tacos and they were pretty good. Just a bit bland.

Pork Tamale - good flavor, but I&#39;m not a big fan of tamales.

Our server was laid back and nice.

Overall, not a bad place to go to try or just to have drinks and some appetizers with a group of friends or for date night."

I would stick with the Margaritas though... I tried a Mojito and it was way too sweet.  The food is just meh.  Tacos were disappointing, small and lacking in flavor/texture.

The food for the price is just alright, over priced in my opinion. The reason I gave it two stars is due to the lack service. 

Last time a few of my friends went there for dinner and advised the waiter prior to ordering that we would like our checks separate. Usually this is never a problem at any other restaurant. The waiter said that he will be right back before saying anything else. 

After about 10 minutes a waitress came and notified us that they cannot split the check due to their policy. I would think a manager would come out and notify us about their policy. 

We orders some appetizers and a few drinks and skipped on dinner.

A friend and I stopped in to visit her boyfriend, who had just started working there, and to grab a few drinks. We ordered house margaritas and some chips and salsa. We got four different kinds of salsa with the chips, my favorite....the habanero one. Duh. 

A few margaritas in, we decided to order an order of tacos to share. We ordered the Barbakoa carne asada tacos. Skirt steak, chorizo, asadero cheese, onions and their green salsa called guacasalsa. The guacasalsa didn&#39;t do much for me, I poured some habanero on them. They were so GOOD! The combination of chorizo and carne asada is always on point, this definitely hit the spot that night.  What didn&#39;t hit the spot is that my amiga and I went home and headed directly to the bathroom. I don&#39;t know if we got food poisoning or if it was the agave nectar in the margaritas (she researched that and found out that a lot of people cannot process it correctly). She had gone back a second time and had the same problem. 

That didn&#39;t keep me away though, usually it does, but not me, you know...me and second chances. I&#39;m a sucker for them. Anyways...the second time I went back for lunch, we had the tacos, a pork tamale, and the chopped Barbakoa salad. All were so delicious and I wanted more! The waiter had told me that it would be one of the best tamales I&#39;ve ever had. I wouldn&#39;t say that but it was very tasty. I had forewarned my co-worker before we went there so we were both just waiting to see if we needed to use the bathroom. Nope....no bathroom visit needed that time.

Since then, I have gone back multiple times. I haven&#39;t had a margarita since and I&#39;ve had no problems....so I&#39;m guessing it IS the margaritas. Bummer. I love margaritas. 

If anything, I would definitely recommend the Paella Valenciana. It&#39;s full of flavor and they add a ton of chicken and pork. Perfect sharing plate if you&#39;re willing. ;)

Minus one star for the service, pricing and parking. I just think, for the portions you get, it should be a tad less expensive. As far as the service, I would NOT sit in the bar area. Our &#34;waitress&#34; took our order and then we never saw her again. We had to keep asking for water refills and to top it off, we even had to ask for the f&#39;n check after waiting 30 minutes for someone to come around. And by ask, I mean, me going up to the bar and asking the bartender for it. The &#34;waitress&#34; was too busy chit chatting. BS. When she finally noticed that I was over by the bar paying the bartender, she came over, gave me attitude and handed me my card. HA! Woosah ran through my mind a million times at that moment.  Parking? During a busy time....Good luck. 

Anywayysss....see for yourselves and let me know. ;)"

Where to start? Everything was amazing! I got a cup of their cheddar ale soup with bacon, my goodness I was actually sad when I took the last bite {I&#39;m such a foodie}. The flavor was excellent and the bacon was the perfect complement. I also got the Jack cheese covered pretzel- yuuuuuum. It was huge, and smothered in cheese. I got the apricot habanero dipping sauce. It wasn&#39;t my favorite (disclaimer I&#39;m not normally a sweet/spicy combination), but if you like apricot and spice I&#39;m sure it was perfect. My hubby ordered the salted and cinnamon pretzels, he devoured them both. 

Overall, we will absolutely be back. The location itself is very small, don&#39;t plan on eating there (although there is a cute little bar top area with about 4 seats). But it&#39;s clean, organized, and super cute. I did read on the sign that they close early if they sell out, so plan to get there early. We went around 2pm and the pickings were running out. I can see why! To top off this perfect rating, everything we ordered was only $12. Such a reasonable price for all of the food we received."

Firstly, you want to get here as early in the day as possible, for two reasons:  one, they will sell out of the special of the day if you get there after 2pm, and two, the pretzles get dried out the longer they sit under those heat lamps, so by 2 or 3pm, they are hardly worth eating. Dunking them in the soup doesn&#39;t help even.  Honestly, I don&#39;t think I ever had a fresh pretzel that wasn&#39;t sitting around all day there.
Ok, next, the soups are very good. I would go there for those alone, but its a better value to purchase pretzel and soup combo.  Just now I won&#39;t go there unless its early in the day so the pretzel isn&#39;t dried out, I hope.  Think Aunt Annies pretzels, they are hardly worth eating after they have sat around too. 
So there you have it, a typical suburban cafe that&#39;s sort of good."

I just wish their selection was a teeny bit larger, but I get it. They are a super small joint that specialize in a few amazing things. 

Came here one afternoon with the family (my hubs and toddler) for a quick lunch. I&#39;d been wanting to try this place for a while so we decided to trek on over. They had garlic and cheese pretzel for the Daily Special. I wasn&#39;t too excited about it but my husband and I each got one plus a cup of soup. We split the pretzels and soup between us and our daughter. The soup was extremely hot. Like, this was going to give me 3rd degree burns if I even got a little splash on me. Give the soup a few minutes to cool down because it is worth it! It wasn&#39;t excessively salty like most restaurant soups. It tasted homemade - delicious!

On to our pretzels. They were scrumptious and every bite was a perfect ratio of pretzel to cheese. It came with a marinara dipping sauce that was unique and fit the pretzel perfectly.

It was a crisp &amp; sunny afternoon so we grabbed a spot on one of their picnic tables in the back. I think there are maybe 3-4 tables so not a lot of seating - and only outdoors FYI.

Overall this is a great little spot! I am going to be back in here whenever I&#39;m in the vicinity."

Hahaha--Who were we kidding.  The aroma of fresh baked pretzels made us dig into the paper bag as we were driving away. And my four year old son proclaimed &#34;These are the best pretzels ever!&#34;  

The space is small--like a pop up store small. But on nice days you can have a seat outside on some of their deck chairs and enjoy them.  

The day we visited there was a small line--about 5 people but it moved quickly.  I got the stuffed pretzel fo the day--Monterrey Jack Cheese and a plain salted.  The dough has that nice pretty brown crust and very soft chew.  The stuffed pretzel was stuffed with really good mild cheese and an automatic fave.  They offer dipping sauces but since we were on the go we will have to try the sauces next time. The Apricot Habanero sauce and Creamy Mustard sounded really good. 

They also offer soft drinks in their cooler (and my favorite Pelligrino!), pretzel chips, soups, and you can pre-order mini pretzels and giant pretzels too.  So cool that so much goodness comes out of a small shop.  Super friendly service.  Reasonable prices."

To round out our meal, and potentially entice the little one to eat a bit, we ordered cups of the broccoli cheddar soup and tomato bisque.

The pretzels were really delicious. The stuffed one was awesome. The other two lacked a little flavor, but were tender and moist- obviously freshly made. Soups were too thick and not blended down quite enough, but I appreciated having it to round out the meal. We sat outside on the deck on a gorgeous day, and that made it all the nicer. Looking forward to coming back for one of those Nutella stuffed ones. Uh, yes please!"

Good size large enough to share. Today I am waiting for the gyro stuffed and cheesecake stuffed.  They both sound delish.  Limit s quantities so need to get there early. And there is always a line.

I quickly changed my mind as I&#39;ve been wanting to check this place out.  I knew it was in Winfield, though never seen the place.  It&#39;s right in downtown Winfield near the train station, hospital, etc.  It&#39;s a cute little place for sure!  Simple menu here...pretzels &amp; soup.

They have a &#34;pretzel of the day&#34; and &#34;soup of the day&#34; ...the day I was there, it was Italian Beef.  I have to say this thing was AMAZING!  It&#39;s a large pretzel stuffed with Italian Beef and very filling! That&#39;s all I needed for lunch!  There are also regular &#34;daily&#34; pretzels for sale, my friend ordered the hot dog pretzel, also day old pretzels on clearance, pretzel bread, pretzel chips, etc.  There is even an interesting dessert menu...which I need to try one of these days when I&#39;m allowing myself a &#34;cheat day&#34;!!!  Oh wait...they sell cookies too, which looked very appealing and I was very tempted, but declined.

As others have mentioned, there are only two seats indoors, we ate in the car...which was totally fine, but this is definitely a &#34;to-go&#34; place."

What&#39;s not to love about this fabulous little shack o&#39; deliciousness? It&#39;s small, it&#39;s local, it&#39;s fresh, it&#39;s active on social media, it&#39;s owned by people who have the cuuuuutest French bulldog, and most importantly: they do one thing, and they do it really, really well. 

I had first heard of Gnarly Knots through Facebook, where they advise eagerly awaiting fans of their weekly specials and up and coming offers. Maybe I&#39;m a giant nerd but I LOVE this idea. It&#39;s what roped me in. Every week I watched the Facebook page for a flavor I couldn&#39;t live without, which was when I wanted to dive in and try one of these famed pretzels. Unfortunately, the hype is real, and so are the lines to wait for these special pretzels. So I went with a backup plan, and when I was on vacation in a weekday, scurried over to try the deliciousness with no wait!

It really is kind of a shack - a teensy tiny shack that would be pretty easy to miss if I hadn&#39;t been stalking it for weeks. I parked, climbed the stairs, and walked in to the smell of fresh made pretzel heaven. I ordered a Monterey Jack stuffed pretzel and a cinnamon sugar with cinnamon creme dipping sauce. My order was ready in .000034 seconds and I jumped in the car to head home and eat.

Typically, pretzels aren&#39;t my favorite foods, but I tell you these are pretzels done RIGHT. Soft, fresh, warm, chewy... They&#39;re perfect. The cheese stuffed pretzel was loaded with gooey melted cheese and was a salty, decadent delight. The cinnamon sugar pretzel was a perfect sweet ending to my meal, and I could have eaten about four of the cinnamon creme sauces. So good.

I came back this past weekend just to ensure I was appropriately in love with this place and tried their Italian sausage stuffed pretzel dog with provolone cheese and a side of marinara. AMAZING. But the most amazing?! Their PRETZEL bread pudding loaded with apples and creme anglaise! Brilliant, innovative, decadent, and addicting. Who knew pretzels could be so much fun?! 

If all you know of soft pretzels is movie theaters and baseball games, do yourself a favor and get over to Gnarly Knots. Let them elevate pretzels for you and change your mind for good. And also try to spy their adorable pooch while you&#39;re there, because the only thing in my world that can make a 5-star establishment better is a love of cute canines!"

There are tables and seats outside and u can eat inside to but there are only 2 seats. Never had a bad experience just think they need to work on making the special pretzels taste better  
All in all good nice cute spot to come with the family 

Buffalo chicken pretzel: the pretzel texturally is really good not soggy not to hard. The filling was really good there was alot of chicken but since they fried it it became really soggy like mush like u know when u eat can vegetables and u can squish them  in ur hand and they completely  disintegrate. So they should have grilled it or panfried it The dipping sauce was also really good i ate all of it its that cant believe its not butter with buffalo sauce. I just wish they would fill the whole pretzel up cUse when u finish ur left with alot of pretzel

Cookie doe pretzel :this was really could i was skeptical because alot of people use cheap chocolate thats not that good but it was really good. It was really like eating cookie doe from a bowl. Again they need to fill the whole thing up with the ingredient because u end up with alot of pretzel left over n a dipping sauce would have been perfect.

Italian pretzel provolone cheese with marinara sauce: picture a gormea pretzel dog. It was really good the spices on top were really delicious wish there was some on the bottom or more on top. The actual sausage was really tender. It was a plain sausage i wish it would have been a spicy one. They needed to grill it because i think it tastes better if they cant grill it then panfry it for some texture. Regarding the marinara sauce it was cold they should have warmed it up it was a really plain sauce nothing special alot of oregano 

Pretzel bread pudding: the texture of it was good not to dry could be a lil more moist though. when i was eating it i didnt see alot of apples in it. The sauce is like a cinnamon bun with cinnamon in it though i didnt really care for the sauce on it wasnt my favorite i was expecting something really amaizin and different wouldnt order again."

Fresh made pretzels daily, when the sell out, they close.  Each day they have a different &#34;stuffed pretzel&#34; among their normal rotation.  On Saturday they have one sweet special and one savory.

We missed out on the daily special (they go quick) so we ordered the garlic Parmesan.  That&#39;s a good pretzel!  We also tried the sweet option, which was a pretzel bread pudding.  I don&#39;t recall the exact flavor, but it was great!

1. The pretzels are absolutely fabulous and are very unique! They even offer sweet AND savory pretzels. My personal favorites include the Cookie Dough stuffed pretzel and the Bacon Mac and Cheese stuffed pretzel. 
2. The only problems with this place are that there are limited amounts of their &#34;specials&#34; for the day, so we have to wait in line for about forty minutes to insure that we receive those specific pretzels. In addition, it is very small with limited space to wait indoors, so if the weather is not cooperating that day, it might not be the best time to get a pretzel.
Overall, I would definitely recommend Gnarly Knots. The pretzels are delicious and they will indeed satisfy one&#39;s sweet tooth!"

Do you love pretzels?  Do you love dipping sauces?  Do you love meats stuffed inside pretzels?  Then this is the place for you!

For the same price as a pretzel at the nationwide chains, you can get a hearty and delicious pretzel plain, or with several toppings.  They do daily specials of pretzels and soup.  All in a quaint location.  If you&#39;re craving a pretzel, this is the place to go."

I had the Pepperoni Pizza for lunch.  The regular pretzels are thick, maybe 2-3 times the size of those mall pretzels, so the stuffed pretzels are even more monstrous.  It came with a side of marinara sauce for dipping.

I also tried the Cinnamon Sugar pretzel, which wasn&#39;t anything special.  It needed more cinnamon and sugar!  The savory stuffed pretzels are the star of the show here.  

They also give out free mini pretzels on National Pretzel Day - who knew there was such a thing?

Bonus points for stocking Blood Orange Pellegrino in the cooler.

I feel like this place is sort of in the middle of nowhere, but it&#39;s not.  The business is located in an old, charming white house, near Central DuPage Hospital.  Their hours are really limited, so you have to go during the day or on the weekend.  So if you have your heart set on the day&#39;s special, get there early in case they sell out.

So it&#39;s a tiny joint in Winfield that has some out door seating and two bar stools inside.  But from what I have seen and experienced, it&#39;s hard to even make it back to your car once you have to goods in your hand.

They have your regular slated pretzel, which, if you know anything about pretzels...t requires yellow mustard!  These pretzels are tasty and just the right amount of salt and chew on the &#39;skin&#39; of the pretzel.  You can purchase cheese dip and other dips.  The cheese dip is good.

They have a few other pretzels that have some cheese on the outside of them, great as well.

Now the &#39;stuffed&#39; pretzels....they serve a fixed stuffed pretzel menu every day...one kind of stuffed pretzel each day of the week.  The bottom part of the pretzel is what is stuffed.  The Porker is lick your lips delicious, Jack cheese stuffed is amazing....

On Saturdays they have a &#39;wild card&#39; stuffed pretzel that you can get hints about what it will be on Facebook.

The first day we went here, it was a &#34;pretzel dog&#34; with an italian sausage. He got an oreo cheesecake stuffed pretzel. We have been back a handful of times, but that visit remains our favorite. The italian dog was just the right amount of juicy and delicious.

Other pretzels we have enjoyed include: tuxedo white chocolate cake, bacon/tator tot, italian beef, gyro, meatball/mozzarella, and caramel apple stuffed. They were all delicious.

Apparently the line started to form at 10:30 but our group didn&#39;t make it until 11:30 and weren&#39;t too far back in line. 

Once the doors opened, things seemed to move pretty fast. My only complaint is because the shop is so small, crowds had little room to move while waiting for their food.

These specialty pretzels are totally worth their $6 price tag. Considering these were my first stuffed pretzel, I was surprised to see only the bottom was stuffed. But I can&#39;t blame them, stuffing the entire thing would be a major pain in the ass. 

The beef brisket was phenomenal. I seriously want their brisket recipe. This thing was stuffed full too, no skimping on the meat. 

The Oreo cheesecake was really good, not sure if I&#39;d get it again. I love cheesecake and maybe it was because it was warm, the cheesecake had a different texture but the taste was definitely there. 

I also tried their original pretzel chips. They were average. Less salty than the ones you get in the grocery store but I&#39;m happy to support local businesses."

This might actually be my definition of heaven. As soon as I saw this place come across my Yelp feed, I bookmarked it for a visit. Yes, I actually drove about an hour round-trip to eat a pretzel, and it was totally worth it.

First let me say that I love the whole idea of this place. I checked out their website shortly after seeing it here, and their story is great. A true little community support success story. It is nice to see, and I feel even better to help support that too.

A little about the place - I see that it often gets quite crowded, though we didn&#39;t have that issue during our visit (around 12:30 on a Saturday). There were other people there, but we didn&#39;t have to wait in line and they had plenty of hot fresh pretzels ready. They have two parking lots available, so plenty of space, though the restaurant itself is very tiny. It is a walk-up establishment with a tiny indoor waiting area and a counter for eating that only seats about 2-3 people. It is a converted house, so most of the space is in the back for cooking the food. They do have a few tables outside though, if the weather is nice and you want to &#34;dine in.&#34; I think they probably get much of their business from CDH, which is right across the intersection.

They have a variety of tasty pretzels (obviously) but also soup, cookies, and pretzel buns to go. Check out their menu or their Facebook page for their daily specials, since the pretzels available rotate each day. They also have special stuffed pretzels on Saturday. My husband and I both tried the classic salted pretzel, with jalapeno cheese dip. It was great! The size is generous, and it is served warm. It isn&#39;t overly salted, and tastes delicious. I&#39;d definitely like to go back to try their other types, especially the stuffed, but wanted to stay traditional for our first visit. If you love pretzels, you&#39;ve got to try these guys out!"

It&#39;s a very quaint place in downtown Winfield. Walking in I can see how tight it can be on a busy Saturday with a line around the building. It&#39;s great to see them having such great business from local entrepreneurs. Plus, they are looking to expand so I look forward to that. Now let&#39;s get to the good stuff.

Their pretzels are enormous. Very soft, fluffy,  crispy. Just the way you want them to be. I had the cinnamon sugar which I was really impressed with. Plus I had a side of Nutella, so how does it get much better. My girlfriend got the salted pretzel with a side of nacho cheese. I was impressed with how good the cheese was and both sides were only 50 cents each. I also thought the prices on the pretzels are reasonable considering how much you get.

I know I&#39;ll be back again to try their specialities like the cinnamon roll, caramel apple and their other daily specials. It&#39;s like having a pretzel party in my mouth."

After seeing Heidi K&#39;s review on the 3rd, I knew that I&#39;d need to make a visit stat. I talked to one of my friends whom, much like me, is always down for a good road trip. We decided to head here this past Tuesday. 

I was already aware of the mnimal seating from prior reviews but it was a nice day out, so at the very least- I knew we could just bask in the sun and hang out on the curb.  We were fortunate enough to grab the one and only patio table right as someone else was heading out. Woohoo!

I ordered the french onion soup and the POTD (pretzel of the day.. I just made that up) which was salami and provolone. I asked the girl working what her recommendation was on sauce and she said the mustard. My friend ordered the cheese topped with nacho cheese, as well as a soup. Our total was around $18 which I thought was a good price. Also, the girl working was really friendly. 

My pretzel was heaven on earth. The dough itself was perfect and the salami inside was sooo good. The mustard really complemented the pretzel well and I ended up using all of it. I honestly could have ordered two mustards that&#39;s how good they were. 

They list their daily pretzels and soups on the website, so make sure to check it out. I also found out from perusing their site that they will be on Chicago&#39;s Best soon. 

The only docked star is they REALLY need a bigger place soon. We came in around 1 PM and there wasn&#39;t much room to stand to wait for our pretzel. Hopefully they&#39;re so successful that they expand to a 2nd location soon!"

Due to their hours, I was only able to check them out on Saturday (and that goes for repeat visits in the future as well), which was a bit of a headache.

You see, unlike the size of their pretzels, GN and its lot are small. It took me a few attempts to park. I first pulled in to find no parking. So I left and came back about an hour later and managed to snag the last open spot. 
Then there&#39;s the shop itself. Folks, there&#39;s no dining in here. There&#39;s a picnic table out back, a small bistro table near the door, and a tiny bar with two stools right when you walk in, but that&#39;s it. Grab your pretzel n&#39; move along. The line was out the door but luckily it moved fairly quickly. 

Once inside, I noticed today&#39;s specials were the oreo and cheesecake pretzel, and the tator tot, bacon, and cheese pretzel. Say what?!?! Oreo and cheesecake in a pretzel? Bacon, tator tots AND cheese?! Sweet mother of jesus... why have I NOT attempted to visit here sooner? I knew immediately the tator tot version would be my choice (the cheesecake wouldn&#39;t have sat well with me. *sigh).

After a few minutes of standing in line, it was finally my turn to order. I ordered the above mentioned special and a bottle of water. The total came out to a little over $8. Quite the sticker shock, but I quickly got over it and paid. I received my pretzel (hot and fresh from the oven, nonetheless) and made my way back to my car.

I opened the bag and once I saw the size of the pretzel, the price tag justified the product. Fans of Auntie Anne&#39;s, take note- those &#34;pretzel perfect pretzels everytime&#34; don&#39;t stand a chance to Gnarly Knots. First of all these pretzels are HUGE. They are stuffed with delicious goodies. They are thick, soft, chewy, and bursting with flavor (depending on what you get, of course). Secondly, if you neglected to eat the pretzel the day you purchased it (blasphemy!), its rock hard structure could easily be used days later to ward off a carjacker or rabid animal attack. Okay, maybe not, but I wouldn&#39;t rule it out completely.

Gnarly Knots has won me over; hands down they have the best pretzels ever. It&#39;s too bad I&#39;m not in the immediate neighborhood anymore; although a hop, skip, and a jump better suits my waistline and wallet, anyway."

The lines moves fast, the menu is simple with 4-6 kinds of pretzels to choose from. It was perfect for a day you crave a hot soft pretzel and even better that the pretzels are excellent quality. They also have a soup menu so you can make a proper meal out of your stop. If they add homemade lemonade for the summer (hint) I&#39;d become a regular pretty quickly.

Well the stars aligned and I took my chance. I ordered the Italian beef and the cinnamon sugar with a side of the cinnamon creme dipping sauce. 

Italian beef - this thing was delicious, loaded with very tasty Italian beef, it came with a side of hot gardinera and au jus. I would highly recommend this pretzel to anyone. 8/10

Cinnamon sugar - this one on the other hand was quite bland, even with the cinnamon creme dip. I am a huge fan of cinnamon raisin bagels. I wanted this to be the cinnamon crunch bagel from panera, lots of flavor on the top and tiny pockets of cinnamon goo throughout the pretzel. What it seemed like was a standard pretzel that someone dropped in a bucket of cinnamon sugar topping. I would give this a 4/10 

Would I go back? Yes, but only for the daily specials and to try the soups."

I spent 24 years in the Philadelphia area, at least 23 of which were pretzel-eating years. These Gnarly Knots pretzels are something that would be appreciated back East, and not just here in the Midwest where we are pretzel-deprived.

The way the shop works is, there are everyday offerings and one special, stuffed offering each day of the week. I had scoured the website to learn the schedule, as well as that the shop produces only a limited batch of pretzels each day. I now understand that Gnarly Knots has a Facebook page as well, so that&#39;s another good source for updates. 

We made it on brisket day, and before the shop ran out, so we enjoyed one stuffed pretzel and two Bavarian (regular) style. Perfectly crisped on the outside, perfectly fluffy and doughy on the inside...these pretzels are something to write home about. 

The space is quite small, but I appreciate that I could at least get in and out with my babe in her stroller. I don&#39;t think they have a restroom, so of course I had to take my son out to pee in the nearby woods while we were there.

My sister says four stars for the lack of an eat-in area (there&#39;s just a tiny bar with two stools). But in fairness, their website clearly tries to dissuade customers from lingering in the tiny space, so I can&#39;t really blame the place. It is what it is, so I say five stars, but it would be nice if they could someday expand to include at least a small dining area. I look forward to going back on pepperoni day and cheeseburger day to enjoy the other stuffed pretzel masterpieces."

All I have to say is UH-MAY-ZING. Truly.

Our first visit was the pork burrito stuffed pretzel. I have to admit, when I read that day&#39;s special I was not impressed. In fact, it didn&#39;t sound appealing to me at all. But, we were dying to give this place a try and we weren&#39;t sure when we&#39;d get another opportunity to get there (it&#39;s probably about a 35-40 minute drive) so we went.

And I am SO GLAD we did. I tried that pork burrito stuffed and it was .... no words. Just fantastic. The flavor was excellent. Everything about it was great.

This past weekend we stopped in for the chicken parmesan stuffed. It, too, was delicious, but so far that pork burrito remains the #1 choice (but, I&#39;ve only been lucky enough to try 2 of the many kinds they make...).

We&#39;ve also tried the chocolate croissant pretzel as well as the lemon cookie. Both were also very, very good. But, for the price -- I&#39;d almost rather buy another stuffed and forgo the dessert.

Can&#39;t wait to go again -- I&#39;ve got my eyes on the gyro, italian beef, bbq brisket and reuben stuffed!!"

We were out that way for something else and I decided to check what was nearby on yelp. Gnarly Knots came up and after seeing the pictures of the gigantic pretzels I knew we had to go. Omg. So good. I got the Black Forrest cake pretzel. There was a big chunk of chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and cherries. My son got the regular salted pretzel and my husband got the pretzel dog. The pretzel dog was really really good too. It&#39;s almost an hour from home for us but I think we will probably try to make it out here more often to try the others.

I love small, local businesses that do what they do, well!  It&#39;s near downtown Winfield, in a small house that is buzzing with people.  I can see why.

It is tiny, with no indoor seating, but really cute.  You get what you want and go.  They do have a picnic table, maybe 2 outside, but I&#39;m sure most people eat it in their cars or take it to go.  

They have a limited menu and a special stuffed pretzel of the day.  They say get there early, because you might not get one if you get there too late.  We got there in time to get one of the special Monterey Jack cheese stuffed.  OMG was it good!  That little bit chewy on the outside, tender on the inside and it seemed like there was a pound of beautiful, gooey cheese inside.  It really was perfection!

We also got a couple Pretzel Dogs.  They put the jumbo beef hot dogs in there.  I just loved it.  I bet they have dipping sauces for these, but when you&#39;re a newbie and overly excited about everything, we forgot to ask or look, but even if there are sauces, they were delicious without anything at all!  I just looked at their website.  They have sauces.  Big dummy here. 

We shared one of the cinnamon sugar pretzels.  This was my least favorite and only because I felt like it was missing some icing or something.  And again.. probably my fault for not looking around.. cause I&#39;m a spaz like that.

It&#39;s obvious they use quality ingredients and put a lot of care into their product.  If it wasn&#39;t hot, today, I would love to try some of their soup, sometime.  I bet it&#39;s just as good as their pretzels!

Will come back, for sure!"

Today&#39;s (Tuesday) special wasn&#39;t something that appealed so I went with the cinnamon sugar instead..a can&#39;t miss.  I also had a bite of my sons standard salt pretzel.  
The dough in both was very good.  Fresh, soft and warm..a trio that every pretzel should have.  The cinnamon sugar cover was a tad lacking.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it tasted fine, but there wasn&#39;t enough cinnamon or sugar for my liking.
We also got one of the big monster cookies.  That was pretty awesome.  Chocolate chip with pretzel chips..you get the sweet and sour..the best of both worlds.
Gnarly has a lot of interesting daily specials that I&#39;d like to give a whirl.  I&#39;m thinking once I do, my rating goes up.  Cheers."

They&#39;ve expanded their menu so their daily pretzel of the day changes more frequently and that is a good thing.  Pulled pork stuffed pretzel?  Yep!  Cheese stuffed pretzel?  Yep!  Italian Sausage stuffed pretzel?  Yep!  A Vienna beef dog wrapped in pretzel dough?  Yep! You get the picture.

They also do a variety of soups.  I hear they are quite good but for me it is all about the carb laden stuffed wonderment of a pretzel that gets me every time.  Don&#39;t forget to get a side of mustard sauce made with creme fraiche.  Delicious!

I love seeing the line outside the door on Saturday mornings.  During nice weather, it takes on a carnival like atmosphere with folks tossing footballs and frisbees.  You cannot help but smile when you see that!

As others have noted, this is a little house and the kitchen takes up pretty much all the space.  So grab your pretzel to go and thank the pretzel God for creating this wonderful little indie place."

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever eaten a pretzel that hasn&#39;t been from a chain store and I&#39;m loving it! I wasn&#39;t feeling a stuffed pretzel so this review will be for their unstuffed ones.

I got the cheese topped and cinnamon pretzels. The pretzel itself it as good as it gets. Huge pretzel so you get what you pay for and texture is perfect. My only wish is that the cinnamon one had more cinnamon-sugar on it.

Along with the pretzels, I ordered the nacho cheese sauce and cinnamon creme sauce. I wasn&#39;t a fan of these. I don&#39;t know if they make it themselves or not. Nacho cheese was pretty typical but the cinnamon creme tasted like sour horchata to me. It wasn&#39;t a bad sour, like they added lemon juice, but it was just kind of odd in that sort of dipping sauce. I think the pretzels taste the best without the sauces.

I&#39;m definitely curious about their stuffed pretzels. I&#39;ll visit sometime again and try those out. Also, I heard that they sometimes serve pretzel croissants! Oh, I need to try that one.

Side note: I think it&#39;s funny that people complain about how many pretzels they make and their odd hours. Yeah, it&#39;s weird, but they aren&#39;t a chain. I also think it makes them more popular to only have a limited amount of stuffed pretzels. It&#39;s smart of them. Not saying I know how businesses are run, but I can see why they do it. So how about we stop complaining about it and keep supporting this local business? Maybe they&#39;ll have better hours if they had more money for a bigger location."

I&#39;m partial to the stuffed pretzels, and the rest of the family seems to prefer the more traditional ones.  The soups have been very good too, as have the pretzel dogs.

The way this place works is a bit &#34;different&#34; though:
1) Expect a bit of a wait when they first open.  They are popular, and since they have been known to run out, sometimes there is a line out the door and into the parking lot.  Even when it is 10 degrees out...
2) This is a small house with a &#34;pretzel kitchen&#34; inside.  Don&#39;t expect a dine-in experience.  While there is a bathroom (our 4yr-old had an &#34;emergency,&#34;) it is clearly not intended for public use.  The design is, quite simply, &#34;Get your pretzel and head on out!&#34;
3) The menu is simple.  The specialty pretzels and soups rotate - check the Facebook page for details.  Basic pretzels are always available.
4) Shockingly tasty!"

You can only order a minimum of 6 of their daily special, even paying 3 days in advance.

My first visit was just at closing time (as they suggest on phone), to get 4 of the daily special since I couldn&#39;t pre order that morning.  It was the pepperoni stuffed one, which was really good.  They did have a small number of (daily) stock left.  Not sure if they are banking on the exclusivity and word-of-mouth of short supply, but that certainly doesn&#39;t keep them at the top of my food choice since there&#39;s no certainty of getting any product.  

The service is decent and I feel the prices are in line with the uniqueness of the product.  My 3 visits must have been off peak hours as I&#39;ve never waited in line or seen more that one other customer there.  I have heard of the lines but have not experienced it myself.

Ive been back twice since and the food is very good.  The italian beef as well as the gyros stuffed are great and really filling.  Had the cheddar soup with the italian beef...too much food but a great dip for the non-stuffed part of the pretzel.  Some day I&#39;ll get there for the brisket."

After a day of surviving on ice chips, water, and then jello, I was phening for some real food.  And not of the hospital variety.  Enter Gnarly Knots.  And a sister-in-law willing to pick it up and bring it in (thanks, Jess!).  As soon as she walked in the door I was handing over the baby and mangia&#39;ing on some HUGE delicious pretzels.  The daily special was the stuffed cheese one and it was amazing.  The stuffing ends up being in one section of the pretzel and doesn&#39;t go throughout the whole thing, but the pretzel by itself is awesome too so it works out.  The cheese dipping sauce (because apparently I like to dip my cheese in more cheese) was kind of spicy but it was also really good.  Next time I&#39;m in the area (hopefully not because I&#39;m at the hospital) I will certainly be stopping by for another try.  I NEED to have an Italian Beef stuffed pretzel and a cinnamon sugar one too.  Though hopefully I&#39;d do it in two trips...guess we&#39;ll see how rational I am next time I&#39;m there."

I feel like there is much room to improve, and that&#39;s a good thing! I was impressed with how friendly the people were in the shop and with the overall presentation of the food.

The pretzels are fresh and hot. We tried the Bavarian, cheese and pretzel dog. The pretzel dog was AWESOME! I had a mustard cream dipping sauce with it which was light flavor and went well with the dog. The cheese pretzel tasted just like the Bavarian pretzel, just with crunchy cheese on top, which didn&#39;t affect the flavor. And the Bavarian was a good size, good flavor and just enough salt.

I have worked in food service and think both, that this is disgusting, and it seems to have been either be part of a hair net or part of what was holding ingredients before they went into the pretzel. yuck. 

That said, the pretzel was good enough that I will try again. I hope they also pick up production (not an easy task, I&#39;m sure) so they can accommodate customers rather than restricting how many pretzels we can buy.

Also there really is almost no seating so I would plan on carry out, especially if it&#39;s not a nice day.

Driven here by a Yelp email, I drove by after work to see if they had any pretzels left. As it turns out, they did, but none of the pork-flavored specialty pretzels that I was hoping for. Instead they had three standard pretzels and two pretzels roughly the size of a large pizza at Lou Malnati&#39;s.

I&#39;m a rational guy, so I got two regular pretzels. Auntie Anne&#39;s is nice, but in the end they&#39;re little better than something you might get in a can; these pretzels might have had beer in their batter, for all I know; that&#39;s how much yeast was in them. And the outsides were perfectly leathery, while the insides weren&#39;t tough at all; soft, warm and awesomeness in a knot.

I had two toppings; a hot cheese topping that was nice and spicy, and a mustard-creme fraiche cold topping, which stepped around my dislike of mustard by being both mustardy and sour.

If their stuffed pretzels are anywhere near as good as their standard pretzels, the 5-star rating will stand."

First off the chips and salsa were just okay.  The salsa was a more &#34;liquidy&#34; style, not chunky... Which I&#39;ve had before, but the flavor was... Different.  Not inedible, but it didn&#39;t WOW me at all. 

For the appetizer we ordered the Queso Fundido with chorizo on top.  When it was brought to the table I immediately had reservations.  It looked like plain melted cheese with some Chorizo on top.  Went to take the spoon to put some in a tortilla, and the cheese was barely melted.  Like the spoon cut through it.  I figured it would be more gooey.  

On to the meals.  I ordered the chimichanga dinner and my partner ordered the enchiladas suizas.  Both of them had their Adelita sauce on top.  This sauce was super confusing.  It was a tomato based sauce which is fine, but it didn&#39;t have any seasoning typically found in Mexican cuisine.  I had assumed this was cuisine from a specific region in Mexico (if you&#39;ve had traditional Mayan cuisine, it&#39;s SO different from your typical Mexican fare). We asked the waitress what region this food is from and she had no idea and then commented that she&#39;d never seen these dishes prepared this way either.  Anyways, the sauce ruined the chimichanga for me.  My partner didn&#39;t like it on the enchiladas either.  

The rice was okay.  There was a flavor in it that had an almost licorice type flavor.  Wonder if they used anise... Strange thing to put in Mexican rice IMO.

Only thing on the plate that was decent was the refried beans. You can taste the lard in them which was good.

Overall, it was a blah experience and I don&#39;t intend to return here."

One of our go to favorites had been &#34;Uncle Julio&#39;s&#34; in Lombard (besides driving to Pilsen - &#39;Nuevo Leon&#39; or Little Village in the city).

After suggestions from a few neighbors, my family and I tried two of them in Downtown Plainfield -- what a huge disappointment!

Another neighbor suggested &#34;La Adelita&#34; so one day while running errands out that way, we decided to try it.

As I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised. Although the floor plan is like a previous fast food place, the owner did a nice job with decorating the restaurant. White linened tables (makes it look a little fancy) beautiful Mexican murals on the wall, and there is a small bar.

My only feedback and constructive critism would be to the owner?/host -- when people walk in, greet them with a smile and the show them the typical Mexican warmth that the culture is. Don&#39;t look so serious!  Life is short!  Show a little happiness and be friendlier.

At any rate, I ordered the &#34;Chiles Rellenos&#34; (Poblano stuffed peppers), which is my favorite Mexican dish. We also ordered steak tacos and steak tortas. Everything was great!!! The food, rice, beans -- the salsa? Eh...it&#39;s good but could be better. Maybe you should fire roast chiles, garlic &amp; tomatoes and make authentic Mexican salsa/chilito? :)

We also ordered &#34;Horchata&#34; (rice water) to drink and after one sip, and by the taste of it and making it from scratch myself, I knew it was authentically home made! I asked the host/waiter and he confirmed.  It was delicious and a must have!!

To wrap it up, I would definitely recommend this place if you&#39;re in the area.  It is very good.

However, my nearest favorite place is still &#34;Uncle Julios&#34; in Lombard -- their &#34;Carne Asada&#34; dinner dish is out of this world!!! As well as their chips and salsa which i always buy extra to go."

This restaurant, being in the middle of Plainfield, makes it really close to home and far surpasses my other favorite Mexican spots in the area.

The chips and salsa kept coming; although I&#39;ll admit that the salsa was very watery and they could&#39;ve done better.  It wouldn&#39;t keep me away from this place though, because my chimichanga was so good!  It was served with refried beans and rice, and I ordered mine without beans.  I was impressed that the waitress came back to our table to check whether or not I wanted beans in the chimichanga as well.  I didn&#39;t, I forgot to ask for it without, and I was very grateful she came back.  It was perfectly fried and stuffed with shredded chicken.  The only thing that could&#39;ve made it better would be more cheese.

We were warned about the enchiladas my husband ordered that they were &#34;spicier than hot sauce,&#34; and the waitress hesitated as my gringo husband ordered.  Nope, he wanted them anyway.  Results?  Not that spicy.  We were puzzled about why the spice level was made known to us prior to ordering.  The chicken soup was a big portion with large chunks of chicken and veggies.

We ordered a pitcher of the house margaritas, although we didn&#39;t finish it.  The margaritas were just okay.  The food is the star of the show at La Adelita.

Our total for 2 entrees, 1 soup, and a pitcher of margaritas was $45 before tip.  Most entrees were around $10-14.  Without the margaritas we could&#39;ve had a delicious, filling meal for cheap.

It wasn&#39;t busy at all on a Friday night, only one other group was seated in the restaurant when we walked in around 6:00 p.m.  By the time we left, there were 3 more tables full.  It isn&#39;t intimate or cozy at all in here, there aren&#39;t any booths, so it&#39;s definitely not recommended for a proposal, date night, or something else where you might want to impress someone (unless it&#39;s with a chimichanga).  Good for locals who love Mexican food or families looking for a casual dinner."

This is what Friaco&#39;s wants to be, and hopes you think it is. If you&#39;re reading Yelp reviews trying to find a sit-down restaraunt to eat good Mexican food YOU SHOULDN&#39;T LOOK ANYWHERE ELSE. 

That being said, I don&#39;t eat here enough. I have a young son so taking him here is a disservice to THEM. Or you, if you&#39;re eating there. This place is too good (in a good way) to bring my tornado of a family. 

Everything I&#39;ve had here has been good. Ownership and wait staff is SO friendly and helpful. Margaritas - not a drink I always enjoy out because of the markup - is worth it here. Fresh, BIG, and strong!"

The food was not bad, although it seems like an Americanized version of Mexican. They have a full bar and 2 tvs that make it seem more like a basement bar than a restaurant.

We went in on a Saturday afternoon and we were the only ones in there which made it a little bit awkward, but we managed to enjoy our lunch without being bothered.

We&#39;re getting closer to the mark, and La Adelita was a strong addition to the &#34;plus&#34; listing. 

Tucked inside what was clearly once a Wendy&#39;s is a nice little restaurant with exuberant murals (and a TV turned up to an exuberant volume -- at one point we asked our waiter to turn it down a bit, and even after he did it was still quite loud...). The menu is so large that it takes some studying. Drinks included horchata (my favorite, a bit on the sweet side here) and sangria for my mother, which she enjoyed. 

We ordered queso fundido with poblanos as an appetizer; usually queso is more melted (as in liquidy) cheese, but this was sort of stretchy white cheese with the roasted peppers on top, served with tortilla chips, rather hard to wrangle. My dad and boyfriend took charge of chopping it up while the other held the rest at bay (as stated, it was a kind of stretchy and funky texture), then doling it out onto chips. It tasted really good, just awkward to eat!

The food was really quite excellent. I ordered a combo that ended up including beef, chicken, chorizo and a serving of crab legs splayed on top, all resting on a nest of tortilla chips in what looked like the traditional stone bowl. A LOT of food, two people could have handled this (though it looks like more since it is piled atop the chips, which get soggy from the heat/moisture).

It&#39;s not a huge place, so I would try to arrive early for dinner on week-ends. Definitely a place to return to!"

I go here for lunch during the work week, but for the past year, the construction traffic has really hampered business.  I really hope they&#39;re able to stay in business because the food is really fantastic.  

The chicken soup is spicy and really quite filling.  The burrito suizo (my favorite) will cure what ails you.  Like other Plainfield restaurants, I hope that solid restaurants like this will survive the construction.  

If you&#39;re in the area, I would recommend."

Sadly this was true for me as well.  The other ones are way worse then this place but that still does not mean this place was any good. 
Lets start, I ordered a steak burrito and a pastor taco (i always get a pastor taco).  The burrito first, i asked what comes on it she stated beans, lettuce, tomato and cheese.  I asked for a Steak Burrito no beans. What i got was with no beans but had sour cream loaded on it which i can deal with but the steak was cold and unseasoned no flavor.  The amount of lettuce in the burrito was enormous I could only think that its used as a filler. The burrito as a whole was cold and needed to be drowned in salsa for me to put it out of its misery.  The Pastor Taco now, pork was dry onions were over cooked and way to much pineapple(really overwhelming)."

My wife order steak tacos - the steak was very tender and flavorful.  I had the fish tacos which were absolutely wonderful.

Again- the wait staff was super fast and polite.  Drinks never went empty, food was delivered in under 10 minutes,

The salsa verde is spicy for those that need to know and do not want to be surprised by the Verde Enchiladas- spicy but good flavor.  We have had a few different items from the menu and all were good but unremarkable. The nachos are messy but good, the enchiladas are passable,and the fajitas have good quality meat/veggies (the veggies are a little undercooked for my taste but still good).

Hello... we just ordered 20 wings and 2 drinks.  And the coupon was for a charity fundraiser.  Then the guy behind the counter took the coupon without giving us the 10 wings.

The wings were TINY, about 2 bites each.  The fries were cold, over-salted and tasted like they had been sprinkled with sugar.  We would have complained about the guy taking the coupon, but since we won&#39;t be going back, it doesn&#39;t matter."

However,  when my husband arrived for pickup he was told that the order had not been placed, and wasn&#39;t provided a clear explanation of why not. My husband called to tell me what happened and put me on the phone with a worker who just told me that the order had not been placed because they could not honor the price advertised on the website. 

He also told me that they called me about this and I just didn&#39;t answer.  I checked my call log, and I had only one missed call and no voice mail about this (Seriously?).  I told him that it was simply unacceptable to not leave a message about this, and was not offered any sort of apology whatsoever.  Since  I wasn&#39;t  interested in fighting with this worker over the phone, I just told my husband to leave and that we would figure something else out. 

Nonetheless, we were absolutely furious because we were left scrambling at the last minute to get food for our party. Thankfully, we were able to get pizzas from Lou Malnatis down the street right away.  However, poor service like this is unacceptable. There is so much competition with so many great food places in the Naperville/Aurora area, so we will NEVER be returning to Wingstop."

My only complaint is that the wings are relatively expensive and at the location that I was at, the staff was incredibly rude. I ordered online and when I went in the staff informed me that the coupon that I intended to use was not valid at that location. Luckily I threw enough of a fit that they gave me a discount anyway but I felt very offended. I work at MOD Pizza and at MOD we do everything in our power to make the customer happy, even if they have a coupon that we don&#39;t think is valid. The customer is always right and if you are completely unable to give the discount then it is important to give the most sincere apology.

I can barely hear this kid, and then he turned around and screamed in Spanish to his co worker that was 6 feet away, just fine.

Be warned this location doesn&#39;t close at midnight like all the other wingstops. Sunday thru Thursday they close at 11, weekends at midnight. Bs total bs.

A regular order of cheese fries and two sides of ranch dressing.  The confirmation email said that my wings would be ready in 25 minutes, so I waited a few before heading to the store to pick up my food.  I got there promptly at the time they said my order would be ready.  I walked up to the cashier and we made our transaction, and she reached over and grabbed my bag from the counter.  She was a very nice lady and everything went well, she seemed overly excited and told me she was just eating ice cream.....um....ok, hope you washed your hands before handling my food though.  I got home and opened my wings and they were cold and swimming in grease.  The fries were cold and the seasoning on there was caked on.  The cheese sauce was cold.  Maybe this is my fault for placing an online order and showing up on time rather than early.  Maybe they should invest in some sort of heat lamp for to go orders so that they stay warm.  I have visited other wingstops and love the louisiana rub but I have never experienced cold food, the only reason that I wanted to eat here tonight was because I was really craving their delicious fantastic ranch dressing.  That was cold too!  Hooray!  I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ll be back.

I had the boneless &#34;wings&#34; (chicken strips) meal with fries and a drink.  When I see boneless wings, I usually think of chicken nuggets in wing sauce, these were chicken strips in wing sauce, no big deal but it was different than what I expected.  I ordered the wings hot, but they weren&#39;t that hot, more like medium.  I didn&#39;t like the sauce that much, it was just ok, but it tasted more like a pepper sauce than wing sauce.  The fries were fine, but a little undercooked.  I definitely like the boneless wings at Buffalo Wild Wings better and they don&#39;t cost much more.

This seemed a little high, but I figured I would check it out when I went to pick up the pizzas. After I paid for the pizzas they handed me a receipt. Sure enough, I had paid $20 for the two pizzas before the toppings instead of $16.99. I explain to to the man at the register that the coupon was for $16.99 and asked why I was not informed I would not get the entire discount. He claimed that the coupon was 3 years old.  However, there was no expiration date on the coupon so it should have been honored no matter how old it was. And to top it off the pizza was average at best. I worked at a pizza place for 6 years and know how to deal with customers and these people have no clue.

Warning: Do not order on line, it apparently doesn&#39;t work
Warning 2: Don&#39;t trust the Order taker who tells you the pizza will be there in a couple minuets when you have already been waiting an hour
Warning 3: Don&#39;t try to talk to the Manager, who tries to play stupid about your order, which for him, probably wasn&#39;t too much of a streatch!

Placed order online at 7:04 with email confirmation.  Called at 7:58 to find out what was going on with the order, the girl who answered said she &#34;just checked and it will be there any minute&#34; .....apparently not any minute in the near future.

Called back at 8:15 Spoke to the manager who said they never received my order, I stated why was I then lied to about 15 minutes ago...silence.....silence. 

At that point I hung up and will NEVER order from this place again.  Fortunately there are a lot options and Rosati&#39;s will never be one of them.

Minutes later Nick of Rosati&#39;s Pizza on 95th has resolved my issue.  Driver will come, cash in hand, with the funds to reimburse me.  Sweet.  Problem solved and now that we are suburban yuppies I will rely on Rosati&#39;s to get me out of these spur of the moment sleepover nights/starving children problem in a jif.  

Thank you Nick!"

Seems like there has been a management change or something- they just shut down one fine day, no warnings or no communication- at least that&#39;s what most people I talked to, said. Then they reopened one fine day and viola, what a change in the appearance. 

The food remains good even now. The veg biryani is wife&#39;s fav! My kid likes the set dosas and chole bhature. We have tried their pastries and they are really good. I really liked the paneer chilly I had yesterday.. 

On the flip side, the front desk can be managed so much better. The guy is doing a good job, but needs to build a connection with the customers so they ll wanna come back and feel they are getting personalized service. Friday evening was a mess..

It&#39;s possible I missed a memo somewhere along the line, but the last I&#39;d heard, styrofoam was a real negative point against the planet. Not that I&#39;m reviewing Hot Breads&#39; conservation efforts or anything, but just in case that&#39;s a thing that&#39;s important to you, you should know that regardless of your order being dine-in or carry out, your food and drinks will come in about a million different little styrofoam take-out containers.

Anyway, I would love to be reviewing Hot Breads with a higher rating, as the food was good, but I can&#39;t ignore the almost flagrantly filthy interior. When I&#39;d first walked in I guess I didn&#39;t really look around. I saw a table already eating, there was someone walking out with take-out and I&#39;d made a bee line for the menu board and pastry counter. It wasn&#39;t until after the rather difficult ordering process where I needed to find a table for myself and saw that every table was egregiously full of filth. The floors. The seats. The tables. All wet with large puddles, heaps of trays, food chunks everywhere -- it was unforgivably gross. 

I can understand getting busy, but for the level of dirty that everything was, there&#39;s no way it could have gone unnoticed by the people working as their counter and kitchen overlook the dining area and it was fairly obvious that the mess had likely been piling up all day. We tried to ask for a rag, but both workers walked away, so we grabbed some napkins, wet them with water from the soda fountain and tried to wipe what truly was a repulsive mess off the table (I honestly think the last table to sit there had a baby that spit up on the table and just left it, and the still pulled up high-chair soaked in rice and another runny, milk-like substance that had been dripping onto the floor could be used as evidence). Truthfully, I kind of wanted to cancel the order right there, but my partner would have been crushed as he&#39;d already fallen in love with the heavenly aroma of delicious Indian food in the air and the pastries looked unlike anything we&#39;d had in an Indian dining establishment before. 

I feel bad to even have to detail this part of the experience, but it&#39;s something that I would&#39;ve appreciated knowing about prior to going in and something I can&#39;t in good conscience not mention. I worked in restaurants for 15 years and never saw this level of destruction in a dining room and I don&#39;t mean to sound high-and-mighty, but this was a dining experience that could have been a great one, yet was marred by an uncanny level of mess and blind-eye on the employees part. I felt disrespected as a customer that they would allow anyone eat in that environment. //endrant//

The ordering process was extremely difficult and much was lost in translation. My partner and I are pretty familiar with Indian food - he&#39;s eaten it several times a week for the past decade and I get a few doses of dosa a month, but the menu was confusing, the man behind the counter spoke extremely fast and with a very thick accent to the point that 60% of what he said couldn&#39;t be deciphered. He mentioned a few things and after each of them we just said, &#39;yes, we&#39;d like an order of that,&#39; and specified that we definitely wanted the veggie uttappam, but he just nodded and didn&#39;t write anything down. I didn&#39;t feel confident that he actually got our order or listened at all, so I did a repeat of what I thought we ordered, this time he actually did write something, but he didn&#39;t write down any of the food I was saying - at that point I just gave up, tacked on a Chai Tea and a mango lassi and sat our asses down (after we wiped our table and chairs). 

Or food came up, and besides the drinks only one thing was recognizable as something we ordered and that was the masala dosa, which was good, but a bit skimpy on filling and while the dosa was made fresh, the filling was hardly even lukewarm. We&#39;d ordered two Indian puff pastries but they gave us two slices of cake instead. At this point I had to interject since the whole reason we&#39;d come in was for a pastry and not what looked like slices of old wedding cake. They took the cake back after a few odd looks and let us order a pastry with a bit of hesitation. It was all very strange. 

The pastry itself was buttery and delicious, but the filling wasn&#39;t fresh tasting at all. Our &#39;poori with chole&#39; was good, although I know that never in any of our ordering conversations was &#39;poori&#39; an item mentioned or ordered. I did actually really like this dish, but I still think I would&#39;ve preferred the uttappam that we originally ordered. 

I would consider going back if I&#39;d heard there was a major change in the overall state of the facility because the food was something I&#39;d have again, but otherwise..."

Your telling me to relax. As he is making it, he requests me to, pay first, so in case he gets busy, I can just grab the food and go. I said, &#39;no&#39;! His response, &#34;you don&#39;t trust me?&#34; So I proceed to pay via credit card and he tells me his machine is down &amp; demands, CASH ONLY. I stated, make me my food, I will inspect it and I will pay you. Ok my food is done and he tells me, $18.50. I was puzzled, everything I ordered adds up to $14 plus add some tax. He stated, food plus tax plus tip is $18.50.  I stated you earn tips. I paid $16.

Bakery - The pineapple pastry is just too good and other pastries are also always fresh and good. Their biscuits and cakes are also worth trying. 

Restaurant - As far as the Indian restaurant is concerned, this is your classic biryani takeaway joint that can be trusted for that ultra-spicy Hyderabadi biryani taste and a fast-food version of chicken 65. The other stuff is fine too but I&#39;d only try the other things if I am too lazy to go elsewhere for them and would rather get my entire fix of Indian takeaway from one joint.

The reason why I still go here is the fact that&#39;s its an all-day place and though the seating is pretty limited, it does the job when you&#39;re late for lunch and too early for dinner after catching that afternoon flick at the theater close by."

Very spicy and fresh.  Generous portions - we could have ordered half what we did and it would have been enough.  Very small and quirky - piles of stuff around the walls and tables and the floor not very clean.  But good for a quick South Indian fix.

I asked for some Chilli Chicken or some of the other Chicken dishes -- Chicken 65, etc. 

And at 4:30pm on a Wednesday afternoon, they had none. They weren&#39;t planning on cooking any either &amp; they close at 10p. 

They had some lamb dishes @ $6.99. So instead of trying the lamb, I just picked a few pastry items with veggies &amp; curry chicken for $2.00 a piece &amp; left.

I believe this may be a Bakery (as stated). They cater to orders &amp; have fresh curries, etc for lunch, but rarely for dinner or late afternoon.

Have any of you folks seen the same experience or dishes running out?"

If you are a card-carrying member of the clean plate club like myself, you&#39;ll pay for it later.  If you finish this dish, you may as well just go home and pass out, you&#39;re useless.

Especially when I&#39;m hungover.I don&#39;t know what it is about Chinese food, but it is my instant hangover cure. Seriously. I&#39;ve eaten everything under the sun sworn to &#34;cure&#34; a hangover to no avail. Enter China Star. All I need is an order of their chicken fried rice and an hour later, I&#39;m golden. But, I do love this place no matter how I&#39;m feeling.

This isn&#39;t a fancy sit-down-and-eat place. They do have a few tables but one of them seems to serve as a &#34;desk&#34; for the owners&#39; young children, who are adorable by the way. Sometimes they will even assist customers, grabbing a can of pop or extra sauces. Speaking of which, if you love fiery flavor, ask them for a side of the hot pepper oil. Seriously. That stuff is incredible, and a little bit goes a long way.

One of my favorite dishes here is the Pepper Tomato Chicken (or maybe it&#39;s Tomato Pepper Chicken- I tend to be dyslexic at times). It&#39;s exactly like Beef Pepper Steak at most Chinese joints, only with chicken. 

As Dan B. mentioned, the steamed dumplings are quite fantastic. The sauce served with them really brings out the flavor of the meat inside. Another favorite are the fried scallops (I&#39;m not sure if they still have them or not- I didn&#39;t order any on my last visit). They also have a few sushi items on their menu, however I haven&#39;t given those a try and most likely won&#39;t, as I&#39;m particular about my sushi. 

The best part about China Star is the food portions are enormous, and it&#39;s cheap. They will charge you a small fee though if you use a credit/debit card for purchases under $10, or thereabouts. 

I no longer live in the immediate area, so I don&#39;t get to enjoy China Star as much as I&#39;d like. I&#39;ve tried multiple Chinese food restaurants in the area, and nothing compares to China Star. Hands down, it&#39;s the best Chinese Food in Wheaton."

I must have looked tired. Anyway, the food was delicious. I love Chinese food, and I tend to judge Chinese restaurants not only by the main dish, but by things like good broccoli, good fried rice, and good egg rolls. And they were all great!

They do have a couple of tables, but it&#39;s primarily a takeout place.

My two qualms: I&#39;ve noticed that their shrimp is not usually clean (you know what I&#39;m talking about here, right?), so I&#39;ve stopped ordering it. Also, with some of the breaded and fried chicken dishes like sesame or general&#39;s, there is too much crusty breading and not enough meat. However, the chicken in the sweet and sour chicken always seems fresh and delicious, so I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s up with that. I don&#39;t know enough about the preparation to know if these dishes call for different types of chicken.

Their fried rice is great, especially veggie. My son loves their bean curd (tofu) and veggies, and we like their noddles a lot too. Potstickers are decent, crab rangoon is okay but not the best. 

Portions are generous and prices are reasonable. Whoever answers the phone can always understand me on the first try, a nice bonus. We go there a lot and they often throw a free soda or egg role into our bag. Also, how can you not adore the lady who calls customers &#34;my friend&#34;?"

I suggest you carry out since they only have two tables and it&#39;s pretty crowded in the main room with supplies and a bunch of other random stuff that looks like it needs a home some place else.

That said, this is a fantastic option for Americanized Chinese food in the Western burbs.  Large portions and the quality is above what I&#39;ve found elsewhere.  They use all white meat chicken (I dissected a couple of pieces, yep I did too) and they aren&#39;t stingy with the other ingredients.

The combo fried rice was fresh tasting and and sported large pieces of chicken and shrimp, etc.  I also tried the Spring rolls. The orange chicken my daughter had some of the largest and juciest pieces of chicken I&#39;ve ever seen in this dish (hate this dish by the way, who thought up this bizzaro concotion of flavors?!)  The spring rolls were good but I&#39;ve had better yet still for the price and freshness, I give them a thumbs up.

This is a family run place so cherish it for what it is.  Yes, children of the owners were there but I found it endearing.

Bottom line, place could use a good clearing out and cleaning but the food was an incredible value, was hot and fresh and did I say huge portions.  And, Dan the hot dog man loves it too so you can&#39;t wrong!"

And with China Star located off of Roosevelt Road in Wheaton this is definitely the case. China Star is a tiny little take-out place with a few tables set up for dining in if you&#39;re so inclined.

I&#39;ve had a fairly diverse set of offerings from China Star over the years and I figured I&#39;d cover the basics. They have both regular menu items, and if you order around lunch time less expensive &#34;lunch specials&#34; that include various entrees, rice, an egg roll and a fortune cookie. If it&#39;s lunchtime and you&#39;re not planning to bring food home and share it with others then the lunch special is definitely the way to go as it provides plenty of food for any one individual to eat. The lunch specials are generally inexpensive (around 6.00) so the value here is tremendous.  

 First off is the General Tso&#39;s chicken served here. It usually comes with broccoli and rice. The chicken they use is well cooked pre-breaded chicken with a very thick and decadent general tso sauce. While others have expressed their complaint that this is a bit too spicy for their tastes, I find it to be the perfect blend of sweet and hot having just the ring tangy flavor in the sauce to even out the flavor.

Next off are the pot stickers also known as steamed dumplings. The one&#39;s served here at China Star are the best I&#39;ve come across. A tasty sausage like meat is inside of a soft breading. These are absolutely fantastic and are as good as the entree itself. I&#39;ve also had a variety of other dishes and appetizers including crab rangoon, and other chicken dishes all of which I&#39;ve enjoyed but the General Tso&#39;s and pot stickers are definitely my two favorite dishes here.

Overall China Star is my favorite &#34;hole in the wall&#34; Chinese restaurant. The quality of the food here is excellent and the prices are low. If you&#39;re in the mood for Chinese takeout I highly recommend it."

This place makes me almost as happy as seeing LeBron and all his championship rings!!  This is my go to place when it comes to take out, quick Chinese, casual meals, and even some catering needs.

The food here is pretty good, but let&#39;s not go in with the expectation of some sit down restaurant.  It&#39;s Chinese take out and so long as you keep that in mind you&#39;ll get what you want, and it&#39;s pretty darn good.  So the food... it&#39;s Americanized Chinese, and it&#39;s take out, so stick to the main dishes and I&#39;d steer away from the sushi.  A dinner portion (about 9 bucks) can probably feed two.  It&#39;s sometimes a bit heavy on the sauce, but it&#39;s expected.  When it comes to soups, I&#39;d go wonton here over the hot and sour.  All in all, it&#39;s good stuff and you can&#39;t find anything close when it comes to value.

The venue and service.  It&#39;s a take out place so unless absolutely necessary, there&#39;s no need to eat in there.  There&#39;s two tables, and I don&#39;t think more than 5 people ever eat in there.  The service is good and they always watch out for the customer.

Overall, I already go here a lot and I&#39;ll keep going here so long as the food is good."

It has a couple of tables inside but it seems like nobody eats there. They typically order out. They are your typical grungy cheap Chinese food restaurant. I have had orders of beef with various types of vegetable. The beef came out very tender and the vegetables were decent. You&#39;ll pay somewhere between $5-10 per dish depending on the size you order. As long as you keep your expectations low to medium, the food is decent. They do give you a lot of food for the amount you pay for. The shrimp fried rice is so-so. The shrimp they serve is good but it doesn&#39;t come seasoned and the rice is kind of bland."

We were happy with Jasmine Cafe, the food was delicious, although it did not have delivery. We were sad to see the last time we went that they are closed. 

We ordered China Star II at a work function recently and I was not disappointed. The egg rolls were big and crispy. We ordered the Sesame Chicken and Beef and Broccoli, along with an order of Fried Rice to share among a group of five of us. The portions were great for group sharing and we even had some leftovers (which were just as delicious reheated!)

The only reason I do not give this a five star rating is because of the crab rangoon. It was way too sweet and not crispy enough for my taste. It may have been suitable as a dessert, but too overpowering to eat more than one.

My husband and I are ordering tonight and I am anxious to see if he likes it. i myself am looking forward to some more of that sesame chicken!"

I come here often enough when I want fast Chinese take-out.  The portions are large, the food is decent, and it&#39;s pretty darn cheap.  They make it very quickly.

The owner&#39;s two children are usually helping, and they&#39;re relatively entertaining tykes who will beat each other up if one wants to give you the receipt and the other one thinks he should be the one doing the job.  I&#39;m talking kicks and everything.

The dining room is not really that.  It&#39;s got two tables, and the waiting area is small and rather grubby.  But most people get the take-out.

There&#39;s a good lunch menu with smaller, cheaper portions.

All in all, it has good food in low-price, large-portions.  Worth going to just for that."

Our orders were taken shortly after we were seated, and we got water almost immediately. This place is not interested in helping you count calories, they pile food in front of you. This place has the most moist and buttery biscuits in their biscuits and gravy, it is a must try. Their crepes were really good too, I got the dessert crepes. The waitress warned me that it was a lot of toppings, and she was right(see picture) but everything went together nicely. Just wish it was fresh fruit instead of processed. No real complaints, we got 4 large plates of food for under $30. Will be back. :)"

Place seemed busy when passing it on the way to work, so figured I&#39;d try it on a day off. Very cramped inside. Couldn&#39;t fit my party of three and 2 other small families in front of the register/checkin without completely blocking waitresses and the front entrance. While waiting, staff showed familiarity with other people coming in, which was nice, but then proceeded to seat them before us and another family, who showed up earlier. Booths were really small, as in a skinny person noticed how close the fixed table was to them. Our polite waitress noticed this, and moved us to the window, where the tables can adjust. Food was nice, but the booth seats were solid wood, and not ideal to have a relaxing breakfast."

I was heading to Gray&#39;s Mill for lunch and noticed $6.95 lunch specials and $6.45 qts of homemade soup. Unfortunately or perhaps fortunately South Moon at Gray&#39;s Mill was closed until tomorrow. 

So heading back home took me here for a gyro, fries and soup just $7.95. I upgraded to onion rings for $1 more, worth it too. They put red onions on their gyros, which were a little over powering... I&#39;ll need a tic-tac or three.

Tana was my server and was very fun hearted. I look forward to another breakfast soon too. Can&#39;t believe how long it&#39;s been between my visits. 

I got soup to go and might need to go to a 5 star, if it&#39;s as good as they claim. Homemade Split Pea and Cream of Chicken on the same day... don&#39;t see that often. Also they have Chicken Noodle daily."

We were all hungry, and Maxfields looked like it would hit the spot with some comfort food. 

I&#39;ll start off with the positives:

- It had a cozy atmosphere. This restaurant reminded me of your neighborhood diner people congregate at on Sunday mornings.

- The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.

- The prices were extremely reasonable and the portions decent. You&#39;re not going to break the bank eating at Maxfields.

Now the bad part:

I ordered a roast beef wrap with french fries. The roast beef just didn&#39;t taste right (I can&#39;t put my finger on it). Further, it was soggy. I ate about 3/4 of the first wrap and called it a day. I ate the rest of my french fries - which were good.

I also ordered cream of chicken soup. Normally, the soup comes out before the main course. Maxfields wasn&#39;t any different. The problem was that about a minute after the soup came out, my roast beef wrap was served. On the plus side, the soup was good. I just wish I had more time to eat it.

My family and friends who were with me seemed to enjoy their food. I don&#39;t remember them complaining about anything.

I really wish Yelp offered a 2.5 star option. I&#39;d happily give Maxfields 2.5 stars. 

If I ever go back to Maxfields I will order something else and update this review accordingly. I&#39;m always willing to give a business a second chance."

And the shlup that complained about his hash browns, all you have to do is tell them what kind of cheese you wanted! They are not mind readers!!!! So stop by today and tell your friends...."

The menu is small and there is typically only one man taking orders and cooking, but the wait is worth it as your food is cooked fresh and is delicious every time! Everything my friends and family have tried has been very good. The steak burritos are a favorite. I am a chips and salsa snob and these are crave worthy; fresh, hot, salty, perfection! The guacamole is incredible too; made fresh and with the inclusion of sour cream which is sort of unique. These guys know how to cook and deliver a quality meal every time."

My one complaint is that for place which has a definite low-budget vibe and is in an aging strip mall, the prices seem high.

I decided to get a burrito, which I figured was their specialty. The man who took my order (the owner?), quickly began preparing my food. The order of layers in the burrito was pretty standard... refried beans, steak, cheese, tomato and lettuce. I was supremely grateful that they didn&#39;t include any rice, ala Chipotle. I consider it a waste of valuable burrito real estate. 

I must say that the burrito was tasty, but at $6.50 was about a dollar more expensive than similar counter service Mexican restaurants in the area with nicer decor. Maybe they could drum up more business if they sold their food at below-market rates. I know I&#39;d come back more often. Still, that burrito was pretty darn good."

I will admit for a small taco shop these 2 guys kill it in the fresh game. I have not had a bad meal here. I have not had a cold or overcooked meal here. I usually dine in cause I enjoy watching the fellas work their kitchen magic. If you speak spanish the cook has some great stories while he is on the grill. I love their food but the stories are just as good too...LOL! 
Their red salsa has a slight garlic kick to it but no big deal once you drizzle it over the tacos.

My suggestions
-3 Steak Tacos with Fries
-Steak Torta with a side of jalapenos and carrots
-Chips &amp; Guacamole
-Burritos

Their milkshakes are REALLY REALLY BIG and one size!!! So you better drink that last. Its delicious!"

There was only one guy doing it all and only worked 1 order at a time. There were a few in line, so I took a seat and waited to place my order. Owner had no personality and not certain he even speaks english. He brushed off any conversation that wasn&#39;t related to my order.

I got a couple tacos to go. When I got home the tacos had been rolled up like a burrito and honestly didn&#39;t blow me away. Should have held off on the lettuce. Salsa had no heat and was blah. Perhaps I&#39;ll try dining in and get a burrito next time. Certainly not much to their menu and there are better mexican restaurants nearby that are a better value."

The cook was very efficient and had no problem with our special requests. Just the right amount of cilantro was used in the sauces. Small sides of pickled veggies were included at no extra cost.

Warning- their salsa is HOT; beware if you are not a spicy food person. If you like your salsa tangy- then you will be very happy.

My favorite is the avocado torta but the vegetable burrito is a close second. The burrito has lots of vegetables like zucchini and broccoli. My boyfriend has had steak tacos and steak burritos and loves them. 

The chips are fantastic. They are fresh, literally right out of the fryer into a paper bag. Like other reviewers mentioned, the salsa is pretty spicy, but I like it. And the horchata is really good. I get it at least once a week. I&#39;m slightly addicted. 

I changed my review from 4 to 5 stars because of how friendly and helpful the guy in there is. He remembers us and even noticed that we walk there, so he packs up the food extra secure for our walk home."

Big mistake!! When I walked in I was encouraged because even though it&#39;s a small place there were people sitting down eating, but that&#39;s where the positives end.

First let me say the steak tacos were decent, but the taco sauce (red) tasted like it was out of a can, the rice tasted like the kind that come in the bag that you just add water to and microwave. But the worst part were the refried beans.... They were the driest, thickest and most bland beans I&#39;ve ever had. Maybe they were having an off day when I went but I won&#39;t be back to try it again, there&#39;s too many other Mexican joints in the area."

The family that owns it are really nice people. From what I can tell, the father cooks and the brother and sister help run the front of the restaurant. They are always polite and I enjoy seeing a family that works so well together for so many years.

Instead, most of their menu is heavily slanted to American tastes: Sweet n Sour pork, Mongolian beef, Szechwan shrimp, Hot and Sour soup, egg rolls, etc. Judging them along these lines I think it&#39;s a great little restaurant.  It&#39;s very inexpensive, the food is above average, the décor good enough and clean. On the down side, the service can be a little manic since the waitress, Chi, rushes terribly as she tries to cover too many bases at once. When they&#39;re busy I think this is a real snag.

The food was on point and fulfilled the cravings that I had for this style of cuisine. The tangsuyuk (sweet and sour beef) was crispy and held quality flavors. The overall taste of the jajangmyeon (black bean noodles) that I ordered was a bit bland, but very satisfying. I cleaned out all of my plates and bowls, and felt good about it.

The trip was well worth it. Obviously I didn&#39;t come to Chicago just for Fu Yuan... but I&#39;m glad I came. 

My table ordered jajjangmyun, jahm-pong, and kahm-puungi. I personally had the jajjangmyun. It was very good. But what I really remember from the past was the kahm-puungi. This is a &#34;sesame chicken&#34; style of chicken that is spicy. It&#39;s kind of like General Tso&#39;s but so much better. 

I don&#39;t know if they still have it but if they do, ask for it &#34;bone-in&#34; style. I remember that being amazing.

Tip - if you&#39;re looking for the authentic stuff, only order off the back of the menu (which is written in Chinese and Korean with some rudimentary, sometimes unhelpful transliterations and translations.

I heard our waiter speaking both Korean and Mandarin to customers -- very good sign!

Tang su yuk (sweet and sour beef) - very good (had the beef though they also offered pork)
Seafood jajyangmyun - very good
pork jajyangmyun - OK.  i ate some leftovers later and they were tastier... maybe the sauce needed to simmer longer?
ro ji something (spicy chicken) - delicious
pork fried rice - excellent. absolutely delicious, tasty, juicy pork in between well separated, fluffy kernels of fried rice.
kimchi - meh. maybe i&#39;m just not a fan of this style of shredded (western) cabbage smothered in chili sauce. but it was free so i shouldn&#39;t complain. Again, I think we were given this because we ordered the real stuff.
free rice cake dessert - pretty tasty. and free! by this point we were pretty full!

service - slow but very friendly and helpful. the one server refilled tea as needed and was great at suggesting things once he figured out we were there for the authentic stuff.

ambience - not bad. seemed very clean. plain and simple. combination of booths and table seating.

price and portions - i don&#39;t know what others are talking about. entrees and noodle dishes are mostly under $10 with some of the nicer meat entrees running up to $12-16.  if you go family style, you can easily get away with less than one dish per person (e.g., 4 dishes between 5 people) and still have plenty to eat and end up spending right around $10-$12 per person incl. tax and tip. 

A fantastic find in the heart of downtown Wheaton for those looking for authentic Korean-style Chinese food. Thanks Yelp!

Reviewers who complain that it is Americanized Chinese  - must not have bothered to look at the back of the menu which is all authentic.  Those who complain it is neither Korean nor Chinese - Korean-style Chinese food is a real authentic cuisine style (really a variant of Shandong style Chinese cuisine)...  folks who actually know about Chinese food OR Korean food would both know this."

Before my time, they used to be a smaller hole in the wall with strictly take out, which has since been expanded to the sit-in it is today. 

This is a review for their Korean-Chinese food. The owners are Chinese, yes, but they grew up in Korea and so they speak perfect Korean and cook the most fantastic Korean-Chinese food. 

Great jja jang myun and jjambbong, which are the only two dishes we eat here anyways. The kkampoongi is not too fantastic, so don&#39;t expect too much when you order that. 

I can&#39;t really speak for the Chinese food. It&#39;s all very standard American-Chinese food. Mushu pork is good as is the Mongolian beef."

I got it to-go, so I can&#39;t comment too much on the service. We didn&#39;t call ahead since we wanted to get a good look at the menu, so we waited 30 minutes for our food at the restaurant...

Generally, it is one of the places I prefer to go to when I am craving Chinese in this area. In fact, it&#39;s probably my top choice. I&#39;m not saying there isn&#39;t better Chinese out there...I am saying that I get Chinese food in the Wheaton/Glen Ellyn area about two-three times per year, know what I like here, and just don&#39;t venture out to a potentially questionable new place when I know I can get what I like here.

Long intro over, lets continue.

My favorite thing here is the Twice Cooked Pork. It is always really delicious...really, really delicious. If you like spicy, you will need to order it extra spicy. A few other dishes I have had here are fine, especially ones containing pork or beef.

The vegetable based dishes, even ones like beef and broccoli, can be disappointing. It has long been accepted by me that most green vegetables here will be overcooked and on the soggy side. Now, I love my veggies raw and crunchy, so maybe it&#39;s just my personal opinion that they tend to be soggy...but to me, they do. 

Egg rolls aren&#39;t terribly good, but the fried rice is. Hot and Sour soup is average - not great, not bad."

When it&#39;s good, it&#39;s great - I&#39;d give it a five. When it&#39;s not so good? Let&#39;s just say we&#39;ve actually thrown it out mid-meal, and I hate wasting food. I&#39;ve almost always liked the sesame chicken and beef and broccoli. When we&#39;ve ventured to some of our other go to&#39;s when it comes to Asian cuisine, not always a hit. One that comes to mind was we got a lo mein that was soupy. Not just moist, but literally floating. Not that it&#39;s a huge deal, but they are closed on Sundays. Everyone deserves a break, but when Monday is looming and cooking seems like a pain, they&#39;d get more business if they were open. They also don&#39;t deliver. Again, not a big deal, but for the lazy days they get out voted by places that do. I really wish I could give them a higher rating, or if I knew the secret to when the food would be good versus the alternative. We&#39;ve tried them a number of times and can&#39;t seem to figure out the right equation. Not totally writing them off indefinitely, but not the top of the list to revisit either.

I&#39;ve been a fan for a long, long time...over 10 years! My little sister is also a fan &amp; when we have a slumber party we usually treat ourselves to some take out from this little diamond in the rough. 

The place is on the small side which is the complete opposite of the portions they dish out. We often have leftovers and this yelper loves that. Our favs are the sesame chicken, fried rice, schezuan chicken, potstickers &amp; crab rangoon....or pretty much anything fried (obviously...duh). They also have lunch specials Mon-Fri which are very reasonable and not skimpy. Specials are served with fried rice &amp; and eggroll and in the $6 range if I remember correctly. Sadly, I do not work close enough to take advantage of these specials anymore...

I compare all Chinese food to what they serve at Fu Yuan and nothing seems to hold a candle to them. No joke. 
We just moved out to Lombard and while that isn&#39;t too far from Wheaton..we are on the search for some great Chinese food in our area and everything we have tried is terrible....because of course I am expecting the deliciousness that I grew up on!

I avoided it for the longest time because it seemed like just a hole in the wall restaurant (even though those are usually the best). I was really skeptical, the place is small and old it looks like it&#39;s the same size as the Dairy Queen from the outside. But the food is amazing, seriously. I&#39;ve never gotten anything from here I didn&#39;t like. The vegetables are always fresh and the tea is always hot. The prices are very reasonable and you get a lot of food. They seem to get a lot of take out orders here too, and there are always at least a handful of patrons inside. My favorite dish would have to be the vegetable fried rice. Always good never waivers on quality. And you can always ask for no MSG in meat dishes which is a good thing right? 

The only downside is service is a little slow so don&#39;t eat in and be in a hurry. Its a tag team duo in the restaurant which I am guessing are the owners. They are as nice as can be and really try their best to make you happy! It&#39;s worth it though I promise!

Yes it&#39;s Chinese food and yes it&#39;s Korean food.  As far as I could tell most everyone seemed Korean, not Chinese.  It doesn&#39;t hurt the quality of the food, but... what&#39;s the point?  If I want sit down Chinese food I&#39;d like some more authentic style Chinese.  If I want Korean food I&#39;d rather go somewhere with a full Korean menu.  It just doesn&#39;t seem to satisfy when it comes down to any cravings.

The venue and service.  The interior is getting a bit aged, but it&#39;s well maintained and it&#39;s not always well lit.  The service isn&#39;t great either, but the last two visits I&#39;ve stuck to take out only to avoid this.

It&#39;s a long/narrow structure (with the entrance being the short side) and a dining area that runs 2/3rds of the way back.  It&#39;s clean and nicely decorated.

I came in with a friend on a saturday night.  Service was a tad slow but It wasn&#39;t anything to worry about.  Seems like the service staff is just the owners, husband and wife.  (This is a guess on my part).

Anyways, the menu isn&#39;t overwhelming but covers all the standard dishes.

The lunch/dinner meal combos are a great value.  For under $10, price varies among dishes, you get your entree + rice + soup.  We ordered crab rangoon as an appetizer and each of us had an entree. All in we got out of there just over $30 including tip.  Awesome deal.

Now the info you&#39;re wonering about the most: the food.  It was excellent.  It must be noted the food (mongolian beef and shrimp+veg) was flavorful and fresh!  No excessive oils or sauces like you find in other chinese restaurants.  I was pleasantly surprised since oily/greasy chinese food is typically the norm.

You won&#39;t find a rare dish or crazy awesome service.... just tasty food with good service at a great price.

Highly recommended."

No online menu so just had to guess what to order and prices. Brought food home..probably worse Chinese I have ever had, fried rice reminds me of Panda Express, sweet and sour chicken, smallest chicken breast ever, and not 100% but pretty sure egg rolls are frozen and fried.

By far the worst Chinese food I&#39;ve ever had, and I will not be coming back. I&#39;m not even Chinese and I could make better Mongolian beef and orange chicken than them.

Our buddy Vince was coming over to watch some movies and hang out. He lives in Wheaton, us in Lisle so he was going to grab the grub from this Fu Yuan place nearby. Skeptically, and rightfully so, I assumed it would be more of the same. Weak, cookie-cutter food trying to pass itself off as Chinese. 7pm arrives, as does Vince, and we&#39;re ready to watch &#34;Love At Stake&#34; and eat. 

I ordered the Mongolian Beef, my wife the Lemon Chicken. I was expecting, at best, something edible. So I open the box and take a bite. And another. And a third. And dear baby Buddha was I happy. I wept, fell to the floor and violently shook from happiness. The Mongolian Beef, while not spicy, was sweet and succulent. Delicious, fragrant, had those crispy rice noodles... not too many scallions. My god, everything I could want from a Mongolian Beef. I ate it slowly, purposefully. I wanted to savor every bite. I even left a little bit to finish late that night... it was that good.

My wife&#39;s Lemon Chicken was alright as well. I&#39;m not a huge lemon guy so I can&#39;t say it was great. But overall I love this place. I&#39;m ordering again for sure. With Mongo Beef like that I have to."

My in-laws took my husband and I there to celebrate my husband&#39;s birthday. My in-laws had dined here before, many times, but my husband and I were newbies.

I picked up the menu and while trying to decide what entree to order, my father-in-law suggested that we order a bunch of small plates to share, to try as many different dishes as possible. He said that&#39;s what he typically does when he goes, and I was happy to comply.

I can&#39;t tell you how many plates I tried (probably too many), but I can tell you that every single one was simply delicious. The stand outs in my mind are the portobello fries, risotto of the day (yes, they have a different kind of risotto they feature nightly), and the bacon wrapped scallops.

Our server was very nice and was extremely well-trained/familiar wit hthe menu and wine pairings to complement the food. She checked on us often, always making sure we had what we needed, and updating us on when our next plate would be ready.

It started almost right away when we pulled up.  We saw the sign, pulled into a lot, and didn&#39;t see Adelle&#39;s.  We were coming from the west, so the &#34;walk around to the other side of the building&#34; sign at the east end of the parking lot wasn&#39;t terribly obvious - even if we were being oblivious.  Parking was not a problem in this lot (or the lot we later discovered to the east which is probably Adelle&#39;s actual lot) and there was plenty of street parking on a later weekday night.  Parking could potentially be a problem during a weekday due to the train station and nearby apartment complex, but existing signage seems like it would relieve that and I can&#39;t speak from direct experience in the area for other times of day.

So - around the building and in - we were greeted by a friendly smile.  We were immediately led to our seat in the dining area and may have been only 1 of 3-4 tables overall.  One thing that was absolutely impeccable and consistent was the service.  The greeter was nice and efficient, the waiter was extremely knowledgable and professional, the busboy was prompt and accommodating, and the manager stopped by to check on us.  If my review was based on the employees and service it would be an easy 5 stars.

More strange-ness in the building though.  I don&#39;t totally understand the decor.  it is semi upscale modern industrial minimalist with nice points, but seems to have a little bit of a confusion of styles.  It works, but in some ways it feels a bit &#34;pop-up&#34;.  At our table in the dining room there was an &#34;interesting&#34; music selection for a more fine-dining type restaurant being mostly overpowered by the admittedly better lounge music from the bar area.  The two tracks were distracting at times, but music preference can obviously be a little nit-picky.

Adelle&#39;s did have a nice beer selection (and it looked like a nice wine selection as well).

The menu is very creative with smaller plates, tasty appetizers, and full entrees.  Everything looks to have prime ingredients and preparation on a carefully thought out menu of creative dishes.

-We started with crab deviled eggs.  The deviled recipe was a little heavy on the mayo, but I&#39;ll call that preference and give a pass.  The flavor and texture was otherwise great, but they could have used a little zing that was surprisingly not provided by the roasted capers.
-We also had the pork belly fried rice.  This was tasty, but lacked something as well.  I think a runny / over-easy egg would compliment much better than the fried egg the dish had mixed in.  Though tasty, the fried rice portion came off more like your average chinese restaurant pork fried rice.  The pork belly was good, but didn&#39;t do much to &#34;wow&#34; me.  Presentation was good, but eating might have been better if the pork was pre-cut into strips.
-Next we had the chicken and waffles - typically a favorite of mine this was only OK and a bit strange.  The waffles and chicken were both prepared perfectly, but the combination of sauces provided for kind of a strange flavor.  I&#39;d have preferred to be able to select the sauce and quantity myself, but mainly the hot sauce portion was a little strange.  I liked the heat, but the flavor made for a strange palate with the syrup and white sauce.
-Finally we finished our meal with a lobster risotto with a couple of fried shrimp on top.  The risotto was cooked perfectly and the dish was presented well, but the dish mostly just tasted like cheese.  Yes, this was rich and tasty - but it could have had anything in it and I wouldn&#39;t be able to taste much of a difference.
We saw a tasty bread pudding and flourless chocolate cake on the menu and had to limit ourselves so we stuck with the flourless chocolate cake.  It had an amazing ganache and a bit of creme and fruit to dip in, but the actual cake itself was more dry than most that I&#39;ve had.  It was worth eating, but mostly just OK.

Adelle&#39;s mentions that they are a &#34;from scratch&#34; kitchen - they make just about everything on your plate in-house and I can definitely dig that!  The ingredients were all fresh and everything was prepared nicely - there was just a missing &#34;pop&#34; of flavor or anything to make the dishes stand out.

In the end dining at Adelle&#39;s was a pleasant experience.  The staff wowed us, but the food didn&#39;t.  We did eat well (read: a good quantity of food) and had leftovers, but at roughly $50 per person I expect to be a little more impressed.  Things like the conflicting music or the dry cake aren&#39;t really worth complaining over - they should just be taken care of already at that price point.  This may be a bit spoiled, but with the bar set relatively high by other nice/fine dining in the western burbs I can&#39;t quite make it to 4 stars, but to be fair it was very close.  I wouldn&#39;t mind giving Adelle&#39;s a shot again, but it may be a while before we make the rounds."

Over the years, I&#39;ve  enjoyed the atmosphere, the food and the great service. The restaurant is large with a nice bar area and outdoor patio.  The parking lot is small but there&#39;s street parking as well.  Tonight we were seated in a little alcove room off the main dining room. It was perfect for our party of six. There was a lazy susan in the middle of the large table so everyone was able to reach the shared plates.  Adelle&#39;s has a nice wine list and tasty cocktails, but tonight we brought two bottles of wine and paid the $20 corkage fee. They will decant the wine for you, too. Two of the six of us did order cocktails and beers from the bar.  Miguel was our server, and although he didn&#39;t introduce himself upon greeting us, I made sure to ask his name.  Better than &#34;hey, you&#34;!  Our group started with four small plates.  The portabello mushroom fries had a crispy coating with a smoked sea salt while maintaining their juiciness and the truffle aioli was amazing. The meatloaf sliders are grilled and served on mini brioche buns with a tomato jam and crispy potatoes on the side. This is always a winning dish. The fish tacos were tempura battered fish served with a crispy slaw and a jalapeño aioli. Yum!  My favorite, though, was the hot chicken and waffles. This was perfection...light and fluffy Belgium waffles topped with crispy and juicy chicken tenders with a blue cheese aioli, sriracha cream and a hot honey drizzle.  I could have eaten the whole plate. The chef gave us a complimentary order of the gnocchi with chorizo tomato sauce and parmesan. Such a nice touch!  For dinner the two guys ordered the meatloaf with a bordelaise sauce and garlic potatoes.  One gal ordered the salmon special and the other the panko herbed whitefish. My husband had the ribeye and gave me a large piece to taste. It had great flavor, but had a lot of gristle and was chewy because of it. This is the reason I didn&#39;t give Adelle&#39;s 5 stars this time...for the meat left behind on my plate that was not digestible.  I had the grilled romaine with boursin cheese, pancetta, cranberries and a buttermilk vinaigrette and the tuna sliders, one of the small plates, for dinner. The grilled romaine salad had flavor and texture going on and was very good. The two tuna sliders were seared rare and served on mini brioche buns with a ginger wasabi mayo and crispy slaw.  So tasty. We ended the meal with lattes and cappuccinos and a few gelatos. I had the pistachio gelato served with a chocolate sauce and toasted pistachios and two little chocolate chips cookies on the side. The gelato was so creamy and the chocolate sauce rich and velvety.  It was another wonderful dining experience at Adelle&#39;s, and Miguel and the other staff provided attentive service."

For appetizers I ate like a king:
-Meatloaf Sliders
-Chicken &amp; Waffles

I recommend both of these very highly!  For dinner I had the Scallops with Andouille sausage and sweet potatoes.  I could not find the Andouille so my guess it was probably crushed.  We sat outside on a saturday night which was probably a mistake because of the mosquitoes and the slow service.  It was packed!  Next time we will probably sit inside!  The hostess was very friendly and the parking is pretty easy.  There is a parking garage down the street which is safe to park in, the machine is confusing since no parking spots show up.  Everyone just parks here anyways.

I&#39;m willing to give it another try since the food was really good and the waiter did bring out a free dessert for my wife&#39;s birthday.  Always a nice touch!"

1)the bar is nice, live music and decent selection.
2) dinner-two salads, two entrees, three drinks, one dessert =$133. Normal bill for us. Salads were ok-nice portions but nothing popped for us. I had filet with mashed garlic and veggies-the vegetables were so overlooked my husband didn&#39;t want me to take any leftovers home. Hubby had fish tacos and tuna tartar, nicely done. We split the Red Velvet cheesecake-we were very disappointed. The sangria was also not our favorite-tasted like plain red wine, lots of ice with sliced fruit thrown in.

The menu is excellent, The food was 5 star quality.. service a touch sketchy, I was -thisclose- to 5 stars... I&#39;ll go back and try again

**A &#34;small plate&#34; is an appetizer, right?

Well in my world it is. There were four of us and about 7 different small plates that we wanted to start with... we negotiated and whittled the list down to four:

Duck Confit Gnocchi - OMG light and delicious!
Grilled Meatloaf Sliders - Loved them, I traded a little Risotto for a little more of this
Chilled Thai Lobster Spring Roll - Just the right touch of thai and you can still taste the lobster.
Risotto (I think it was shrimp) Light and creamy, consensus was that this was some of the best Risotto that we have had.

For dinner I ordered the Filet.. Boring you say? Well let me just say this: Pesto Mashed Potatoes. The steak was delicious, cooked perfectly and I loved, loved the potatoes. 

My wife, Lisa ordered the Andouille Crusted Scallops, she loved them.. but got to love them the next day too... **because apparently the small plates are more than just appetizers.

Janet ordered the Pork Tenderloin Schnitzel, loved it! She said the braised red cabbage and lemon butter sauce set the whole thing off just right.

And Adam got the Grilled Blue Cheese Crusted Flat Iron Steak, came with fries. and he thought it was delicious.

We eat out together a lot and this was one of the best all around meals that we&#39;ve had in a while.

My companions shared the Turley Howell Mountain Zinfandel

Service slipped on my initial beverage (he forgot my diet coke.. no biggie) but then I sat empty for most of the meal and had to ask for more.

We ordered coffee and a couple of cold desserts (pecan pie and some sort of mousse thingee, see pic) The desserts were excellent, it was too bad that by the time they finally showed up, our coffee was long gone. 

I remember when they opened at the old location.. I was bummed that Cochon Sauvage was gone (a little french bistro) but we were pleased with Adelle&#39;s and felt it a worthy replacement. They were very good and we visited several times, somehow they got lost in the shuffle as we kept trying new places.

Adelle&#39;s, we&#39;ve been missing out. You are back in the rotation."

This is a favorite date night place for us. The mood of the room sets it up for a nice quiet place to enjoy. An added benefit, we can talk and not have to shout.  
Twice we have been seated in the extra area overlooking the fire place. Romantic touch we loved! The service on our visits has always been attentive, but doesn&#39;t interrupt and keeps a nice pace.  All the servers are always well informed of the menu and what works best with what.  

Our most recent visit we took all the server&#39;s recommendations and we were not disappointed.  We started with the portobello fries that were fresh, hot, and very tasty!  I choose the clam chowder that was warm, buttery, and hit the spot.  My partner ended up finishing it because we like to share but it was tough handing over. The special was the risotto with lamb chops.  You can get a large portion w 5 chops and a very large portion of the creamy cheese filled risotto.  We both decided we wanted this and decided to split the huge portion. The risotto had plenty of cheese and butter plus mushroom and peas. Amazing! It also was caramelized on top with blue berries. The sweet fruit was an interesting compliment to this.  The chops were cooked perfectly and generous.  
Use the warm bread to sop up extras! This will not be leftover for later! 

After this, we could not say no to a lengthy dessert menu and split the key lime pie. Home made w a graham cracker crust. 

Wine list and choice of beers both in bottle and on tap are plentiful.  I went with their unsweetened iced tea that was refilled as needed. But my partner was able to find an IPA on tap to enjoy.  

Looking forward to visiting their patio soon!"

We called ahead to see if they had the baseball game on so we could come in before our reservation to watch a few innings at the bar. We were told no problem. When we showed up it turned out they couldn&#39;t get the game after all grrr. 
     Once seated on the nice patio outside I noticed the wine list is fairly limited for the by-the-glass options. They do however have $200 plus Joseph phelps full bottles on the tiny menu?  
     The cheese plate was ok. Nothing very exotic or aged. Just standard cheddar, non aged manchego and Gouda. My other app, bacon wrapped scallop had undercooked bacon and an unseasoned scallop on top a purée of cauliflower with a sauce so sweet it shoulda been a dessert.
     One of the entree specials was a Monchong fish from Hawaii.  I never heard of it but was told it was a translucent very white fish. I&#39;m fairly certain I was served swordfish. My fish was not white and had the texture of tuna fish. I asked a friend of mine who lives in Hawaii if she had ever tried this fish before and was told she never heard of it. Now I know why. 
     Other entrees were the chicken breast; fairly standard with a potent lemon caper sauce. And the sliders which looked ok but I didn&#39;t try em. 
     I had heard nothing but good reviews from Adelle&#39;s so I was surprised at our less than average experience. Add to that the 1 hr plus wait from app to entree. Overall pretty disappointing."

I&#39;ve been eyeing it for date night ever since we moved to town, but we love movies so much, that often nice dinners are forgone in favor of spending time at the movies. 

We sat on the patio, and it was such a perfect night for it. Our server (Colleen, I think?) was friendly and attentive. 

I had the Parmesan breaded chicken breast, which was the tastiest thing I&#39;ve had in a long time. I will be dreaming about tomato butter sauce for many nights to come. My husband had the bleu cheese crusted flat iron steak with sweet potato mash subbed for the fries, and he enjoyed it very much. For dessert, it was tough to choose between so many tempting options. We ended up trying the peach mango crisp, and I&#39;m glad we did. I wouldn&#39;t mind going back just to try other desserts sometime. We also had cappuccino and espresso, and the espresso was especially impressive.

My only complaints are: 1. The music was a little loud at our table. Toward the end of our meal, there was some nice romantic music like I&#39;d expect to hear, but in the early part of our dinner, I heard more twangy country than I&#39;d like (unless I&#39;m at a ribfest or something!) and 2. a couple of the servers (not ours, thankfully) were wearing fragrance, and it bothered me every single time they passed by. Yes, I have a very sensitive sense of smell, but they should definitely be trained to be fragrance free while serving food.

Knowledge when asked, laughed and smiled with us but not intrusively, timing down to perfection. A few of us ordered entrees while the rest shared small bites. All were delicious but the standouts were the portabella mushroom truffle fries, the bacon wrapped scallop ( but found odd only one served but was able to add additional at a less pricey cost) tuna steak sliders and the fish tacos!

Our good friends are weekly visitors to this Wheaton gem and they raved about the food and staff everytime we got together so we made plans to meet there for a weeknight dinner.  This night happened to be 1/2 price wine so we indulged in a few bottles of a delicious and light Pinot Noir.  

Our server, Johnny was so knowledgeable, very attentive without hovering and gave us some great recommendations on the vast menu.  We started with Wasbi Green Beans - one of my favorites and something i have ordered at several other locations but I have to say, Adelle&#39;s does the green bean so well - right down to the delightful sauce with a nice amount of heat.  And the order was HUGE!

For dinner, I ordered the Short Rib accompanied by brussel sprouts and a sweet potato gratin.  I&#39;m not a fan of sweet potatoes so Johnny suggested a replacement of mashed fingerling potatoes and they were fabulous with hints of bacon, cheese and sour cream.  The ribs were delicious, tender, juicy and generous - I could only eat one of them because I was savoring the brussel sprounts and potatoes.  My husband ordered a soup of the day and appetizer risotto that he thoroughly enjoyed.  Our friends encouraged us to save room for dessert and we decided on the bread pudding which was excellent.  

The restaurant is beautifully decorated with ecclectic touches of whimsy throughout - I especially loved the garnet red glass lamps and lampshades in the main dining room - a perfect example of the wonderful suprises that Adelle&#39;s has in store for you."

We choose to be seated on the patio because it was a lovely day (around 6pm). We sat there for a good 15 minutes before our waiter finally greeted us &amp; asked what we wanted to drink. Flash forward another 10 minutes &amp; he brings us our iced teas yet I noticed him tending to other customers that arrived after us because they ordered more profitable drinks (alcohol). Anyways, he doesn&#39;t return until another 10 minutes to get our dinner orders. We ordered the bacon wrapped scallop appetizer, gnocchi, the parmesan chicken &amp; the pistachio crusted salmon. 
Let me warn you right off the bat that the bacon wrapped scallop is probably the most horrific thing my guests &amp; I have ever received at a restaurant... The scallop was not fresh &amp; the &#39;almond sherry&#39; sauce it came with was sickly-sweet like a dessert that my entire table was absolutely disgusted with. 
The gnocchi was pretty nice, nothing really wrong there.
My company thought that the parm chicken was ok, but WAY overworked &amp; smothered in sauce. 
My salmon was not fresh (seems to be a theme here), and again sickly sweet (seems to also be a theme here) with barely any seasoning.
It&#39;s pretty clear to me &amp; everyone that I was with that this restaurant is hiding the ingredients by almost everything having a crust or being topped with sauce. Uninspired, lazy &amp; a real lack of culinary taste. 

If the food wasn&#39;t bad enough, after we received our entrees we never saw our waiter again. After 20 minutes of being done with our entrees, I had finally had enough. I went inside to get the check because all we wanted was for the experience to be over. I explained at the hostess station what a terrible service we endured &amp; to just be given the check. The male owner apologized &amp; said he would be comping the bill..not necessary I told him but he insisted. While that was appreciated, we absolutely will never return. I gave an extra star for them taking care of the bill but based on food &amp; service alone it&#39;s 1 star."

Service was excellent, she talked with us and made sure everything was to our liking. We did small plates so we could share and try a little bit of everything. The risotto was excellent! We are happy to have found this place in our search and will return.... Tuesday night no cork fee. Only thing we could say if maybe the portobello fries had different sauces to dip in instead of the one..... Probably our fault for ordering it last"

We were so pleased! 

Ambiance: Dim candlelight and white tablecloths, cozy fireplace, and overall relaxing and intimate atmosphere.

Service: Our waiter was on top of everything; the host stopped by to make sure we were good; our food came out fairly quickly as well as our drinks. No complaints at all.

Food: Delish! I had the daily special pasta, and my husband had the bleu cheese steak entree. We also enjoyed some great fresh margaritas. 

Prices: It was the perfect in-between for us since we didn&#39;t want cheap, but we couldn&#39;t break the bank, especially if we wanted a few drinks. For two entrees, three margaritas, and one dessert, it was just shy of $100 including tips.

* Bonus: they brought out a special dessert for me for my birthday, and the waiter was kind enough to get a photo of us before we left. 

Highly recommend Adelle&#39;s and will be returning in the future!"

The food has been consistently good in the past, and the service uneven. Unfortunately we had a bad experience yesterday and that is what&#39;s driving this review.

My wife and I went to Adelle&#39;s last night for dinner. I checked opentable and there were reservations available all evening. I decided not to make a reservation and we arrived at the restaurant at 7PM. The sun was setting, temperatures were cooling off, so we requested a table in the main dining room. A quick scan showed at least 4-5 tables open in the main dining room. The Maitre d said that we could have a table in the bar or on the patio. Well, that&#39;s not what we requested, but we decided to take a table on the patio.

After being seated on the patio we waited 10 minutes for waitstaff to greet us and offer menus/drinks. When our waitress arrived I asked about beers on tap, and she said she would have to get a beer menu from the bar. That took another five minutes. She then took our drink order and disappeared. Another 10 minutes passed and our waitress was nowhere in sight. After 25 minutes of waiting for drinks - we had not placed a meal order - we decided to leave. 

On our way out I did another quick scan and saw more open tables in the main dining room. We explained to the Maitre d what had transpired and he asked to &#34;make it right&#34; by seating us in the dining room and personally serving us. No thanks. While the food is good at Adelle&#39;s there are far too many options to tolerate that kind of service."

We live nearby, therefore would love to support this business, however, after the fifth time of disappointing service, we will not be back. Let me be clear, the food is good, definitely has that homemade factor, but not great. It seems they don&#39;t change their menu that much. The desserts are my favorite since they do change seasonally. However, I don&#39;t understand why the service is so bad. There&#39;s a college down the street with smart kids who I&#39;m sure would do a spectacular job with service! Why hire incompetent people who lack the persona and knowledge of the menu? Or is it just Adelle&#39;s not training their staff properly? I don&#39;t know. All I know that if they improved, it would probably be one of the best restaurants in the suburbs. Instead, Fire and Wine is the way to go!"

Okay, maybe make sure they are open first...or just camp out on their patio with a lawn chair &amp; sleeping bag as I intend to from now on.  Oh, and homemade soups...if you like those, then this place is simply WOW.  And bread pudding...one of my fave desserts &amp; the chef here hits it out of the ballpark!  And, and, and...!!!

The ambience &amp; decor is beautiful (more on that later).  We&#39;ve been quite lucky to visit a number of restaurants lately which look fancy, taste fancy, give incredible service, but don&#39;t have that stuck-up attitude - and I&#39;m happy to report Adelle&#39;s fits that description.

The hubs had the risotto of the day &amp; I kid you not, I wanted to shout, &#34;Hey! What&#39;s that over there?&#34; so he&#39;d be distracted long enough to switch plates.  It&#39;s not that my pistachio/honey/shallot crusted salmon wasn&#39;t good...it&#39;s just that I think anything else pales in comparison to their risottos.  We&#39;ve also tried 2 of their soups at some foodie fests (the corn chowder &amp; the cream of mushroom were both swoon-worthy).  The only disappointment in the food category was our calamari appetizer - it wasn&#39;t in the fryer long enough so the breading was a bit soft &amp; came off very easily.  It came with a tasty dipping sauce &amp; a little salad which were both good.   We finished off the night with two desserts, the Pistachio White Chocolate Bread Pudding &amp; the Salted Caramel Gelato.  The gelato was darned good but the bread pudding was the definite winner in the dessert death match.  It was even damn good cold this morning for breakfast.  Yes, I actually managed to NOT devour the whole thing the night before. ;-)


Yes, they do have wine by the glass, it&#39;s just listed on the specials menu your server will give you &amp; not on the big regular menu which does have all the bottles of wine they have.  I like how they have a variety of wine &amp; food price points as well.  The glasses of wine ranged from $4 - $12.  I tried an $8 Chenin Blanc from South Africa that was wonderfully crisp with nice fruit notes (sorry, that&#39;s about as descriptive as my limited wine knowledge goes...I just know what I like!).  

It was a bit too humid to dine out on their lovely patio so we sat inside &amp; were pleased to see a whole wall of large windows so we had a perfect view of the patio.  Once it became dark outside the little twinkle lights outside on the shrubs &amp; trees looked so romantic.  They do a fine job with perfect mood lighting inside, too, and I saw a few fireplaces as well.  They have a room off to the side for larger groups and parties (there was a wine tasting dinner going on in that room while we were there) and they also have one big inset booth with screens that close for even more privacy.

Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE here was genuinely friendly.  The hostess, the gentleman who filled our water (and those water glasses were never down more than a 1/2 cup before he was refilling them again), the busser, our server, all the other servers, &amp; the chef - they all said hello, answered questions, when they saw we had the check and/or as we were walking out some would said thanks for coming in or have a nice evening, etc. - it was just a fabulously pleasant experience."

I&#39;m shocked by some of these negative reviews, we go to Adelle&#39;s regularly, and it is consistently very good. The risotto is something to behold. I like risotto, but here, it&#39;s the highlight of my meal. Told my wife next time I want a double helping and salad, and in good. I am presupposing  that some of these poor reviews have more to do with some individual not liking a particular dish, not on the quality,more preparation, or taste. Adelle&#39;s is great for a nice meal, I suggest trying it because in five years I&#39;ve never really had anything I did not really enjoy. One of our favorite places,Mary it, and try the risotto!

The portobello mushroom fries and the duck confit gnocchi were what saved this dinner. The service and the rest of the menu items are nothing of note. It&#39;s really too bad, we wanted to like this place. Had a cute little courtyard and the ambiance of the restaurant was lovely. I had the short ribs, my brother had the grilled bleu cheese crusted flat iron steak, and my husband had the grilled beef tenderloin filet. The short ribs and filet were insipid and the steak was overdone. Our server&#39;s service started off as promising but he didn&#39;t bother to check on us to see if we liked our selections and then pretty much ignored us until the end. Will not return!"

This was our first trip to Adelle&#39;s in Wheaton. It was our anniversary and had a nice evening planned so we were looking for the perfect restaurant to compliment our evening. WE FOUND IT!!!

I read the great reviews on Yelp before choosing Adelle&#39;s, and was a bit nervous that the restaurant wouldn&#39;t live up to the hype. Boy did it ever. 

As soon as you walk in you notice the beautiful decor and the serene atmosphere. We were seated promptly and then greeted by our waiter, John, who should be in the hall of fame for perfect waiters. He was friendly without being fake and was sincere about making our evening as perfect as can be, He was very helpful with the selections and knowledgeable about the entire menu. His tastes and descriptions of the food were spot on.

Now for the food. We started with the small plate risotto of the day which was a duck confit, sweet corn, goat cheese and a blueberry butter sauce. OH MY GOODNESS! John was right- this plate is to die for! I was so sad when the plate was empty. It was as perfect as could be. The chef changes the risotto daily so I can not wait to go back an try another. This risotto is equal to Gordon Ramsay&#39;s quality. The tastes were perfect together. Now I&#39;m sure you want to hear more- 

In addition to the risotto we had a house salad, a beet salad and a gazpacho that was out of this world. The gazpacho was honey dew melon, watermelon rind (for a crunch) lemon and a hint of jalapeno for a touch of heat at the end-all served cold of course. fabulous!

The plates were a good size but not heavy of too much. Perfect. John had recommended a blend for a wine which was light and fruity with a hint of dryness at the end.  I wish I would have written it down, but I will the next time I go back which will be very soon.

The entrees that we had were the flat iron steak with blue cheese (cooked to perfection) and finger potatoes, which my wife could not stop eating even though she was getting full. I choose the pistachio crusted salmon (light and flaky) with a spinach salad which was again, out of this world and sweet potato mash.

The night was perfect we are still talking about the food and experience the next day, so a sure sign of a great time both food and atmosphere!

Don&#39;t hesitate--GO NOW!"

The menu was a mix of buffet and entree.  The buffet included staples like cheese and fruit, a soup, veggie quesadilla&#39;s, deviled eggs, and rolls.   It would have been acceptable for a hotel but not Adelle&#39;s.  It just had a feel of &#34;let&#39;s see if this works&#34;.  As we were halfway through our buffet appetizer course, our entrees arrived.  Were we being rushed or was the staff and kitchen just not used to working on a buffet schedule?  The waiter couldn&#39;t have been less concerned about our comment on the timing.  On the plus side, the entree&#39;s were excellent as usual.  The pot roast was fork tender and was all meat (no fat).   Everyone else seemed to enjoy their entrees as well.  Sadly, our appetizer plates remained on the table throughout the meal. Again, the staff seemed to be unaccustomed to working with a buffet.  The dessert table was straight out of a Costco warehouse.  The cream puffs lacked any taste and the little pastry cups needed a knife to cut.  

So we&#39;ll look elsewhere to celebrate Mother&#39;s Day and visit when they offer their standard menu.  That way we know we won&#39;t be disappointed."

We went to hear my guitar teacher (Kevin Brown) who was playing live jazz (every Thursday night, 7-10 pm). We weren&#39;t able to swing a fancy dinner tonight so just went for dessert and the live music. 

What a great date night! We loved the music and got a great table and could just chill and relax. We were treated SO well by Miguel- what a great waiter. We appreciated the attentiveness of Miguel and the hostess too. 

The desserts were truly top notch. The bittersweet chocolate mousse was the best I have ever had- I loved the combination of the mousse, fresh whipped cream, raspberries, and raspberry sauce. It was delectable. You really need to try it. My husband couldn&#39;t pass up the warm rhubarb crisp with the vanilla bean gelato- he loved it and thought it tasted very fresh. We also ordered the warm blueberry buttermilk white chocolate brioche bread pudding that had caramel sauce, whipped cream, and creme anglaise, at the recommendation of Miguel. (Yes, if you&#39;re doing the math, we ordered three desserts for two people!) We shared that and really couldn&#39;t finish it even though it was very tasty with so many rich flavors. The size of these desserts are generous which isn&#39;t usually common at places like this. But all three desserts were truly delicious but in the future we will only order two. :) 

I&#39;ve not tried the dinner menu yet but definitely I give Adelle&#39;s five stars for the excellent live music, great service, and awesome desserts."

We tried two of the small plate specials - a perfect summer, spinach salad and the risotto special. We were pretty sure this was too much food for two people but had a hard time restraining ourselves from licking the plates. For main entrees, we had the hoisin glazed duck breast with cherry sauce that was very nice and the fat was well-rendered. The leek and peapod salad was imaginative and delicious. We also tried the meatloaf and my husband enjoyed it with the spicy ketchup.

Our waitress was lovely, kind, and offered good suggestions without lingering too long. We both agreed that the neutral, contemporary ambience makes for a nice mix of business, casual, but can be romantic as well. This would be a great place for a business or political luncheon.

We started out saying it&#39;s probably one of the best meals we&#39;ve had since moving to the suburbs, but quickly decided that statement doesn&#39;t do Adelle&#39;s justice -- it was a great meal, city or suburbs!

My favorite spot is the cozy and pretty patio - love it! In the winter time enjoy the fireplaces!  All the main dishes my husband and I had were well prepared and tasty; however I think Adelle&#39;s excels with their beautifully presented and extremely delicious small plates. My absolute favorites are the Chilled Thai Lobster Spring Roll and the Tuna Tartar.

Sometimes we just go there for an impromptu bite to eat in the beautiful bar sharing several of the small plates and having a glass (or two!!) of wine which makes for a very fulfilling experience."

While we requested to sit outside, they could not accommodate our request on a Saturday night. However, after dinner we asked our waiter, Nick, if we could move to the patio area (by this time the crowd had died down) and he gladly obliged. I had the red sangria, and, while the bartender said it was &#34;sweet&#34;, it was more dry...exactly what I wanted! 

We came as our dining club, Dining Divas, so we all ordered appetizers to share. We had the tuna steak sliders, regular sliders, calamari, and gnocchi. Everything was awesome! As my entree, I ordered the andouille topped scallops over a sweet potato hash, and it was so delicious. The scallops were cooked to perfection, and the hash had just the right amount of heat.

To start, our waiter, JP, was excellent.  He was helpful with the menu and suggested a great bottle of wine.  Throughout the course of the meal he was attentive, funny, and easy to talk to.  We really appreciated the level of service and professionalism displayed by the Adelle&#39;s staff.

The food was also delicious!  We split the charcuterie plate and portobello mushroom fries to start, both good.  I had the Andouille crusted scallops for my entree.  To.  Die.  For.  Seriously!!  I&#39;m pretty sure I will be dreaming about it for weeks to come.  Dessert was also wonderful, we split a truffle brownie and some dark chocolate mousse and cleaned the plates.  Do not leave here without dessert!

We were dining out for our anniversary when we visited Adelle&#39;s.  We didn&#39;t mention it to our server but after we ordered cocktails and a bottle of wine on a Wednesday, he asked us if we were celebrating, and we shared our special occasion.  Adelle&#39;s gave us each a glass of champagne on the house, yum!!  We weren&#39;t expecting it, but it was a wonderful gesture.

And it was an ok meal but it wasn&#39;t what I was expecting.  We started with the portobello fries, which were very good.  Our entrees fell a bit short.  The short ribs themselves were very good but the sides were flat.  I was disappointed that the brussel sprouts seemed to be just steamed or boiled without a lot of seasoning.  I was underwhelmed with the andoille crusted scallops and the &#34;hash&#34; underneath.  I wonder if we had an off night or if we ordered wrong.  

That being said, we&#39;ve come back already to enjoy the bar.  I really like the atmosphere and the bartenders are always friendly.

My family has come here for holidays, family parties, and just a night out.  In all those times I&#39;ve been to Adelle&#39;s, their food, service, and atmosphere have never disappointed. 

They have many delicious choices on their menu, and they have specials that change daily.  I am not usually big on &#34;fancy food&#34;, but there are many items on Adelle&#39;s menu that I love. They have a great bar too. 

The best part of Adelle&#39;s is that even on a budget, you can have a really nice meal.  Recently, I took my mom out to Adelle&#39;s to celebrate Mother&#39;s Day.  We sat in the bar and ordered 3 appetizers and we both got a drink. Our bill was only $50, but we got the fine dining experience. I would have spent the same amount if we had gone to dinner at some crappy chain.

 The appetizers were very filling!  We got the meatloaf sliders, pear date bruschetta, and a salad.  They had a decent list of craft beers, and you can make your own flight!  I got to try 3 different appetizers and beers all in one night.  Perfect for someone who can never decide what to order because too many things sound good!

The atmosphere is great too. This place has something for everyone.  They had live music in the bar, and they had the Hawks game on.

Whether you are just going out for a drink, or you want a really nice dinner, Adelle&#39;s is your place."

From then on our server (Maryanne) took wonderful care of us....paying attention, not intrusive, helpful suggestions and professional.  The meals are outstanding.

Our server was rude, inattentive-leaving us with empty drinks,never once asked us how our meal was,and took forever to even come around to our table-and the restaurant was not very busy so it wasnt like he didn&#39;t have time. I&#39;ll spare him by not saying his name, maybe he had a bad night, but he certainly payed more attention to the other tables around us and we were more than nice to the guy.
 
I read good reviews about the meatloaf so I decided to try it, not my cup of tea and I would not order it again.

My girlfriend had the Parmesan Breaded Chicken Breast, which was very good, 

 I was disappointed that the poor service ruined what should of been a special dinner."

I would go back for the portabello fries.  Dipped in light crunchy breading and not greasy but moist on the inside, they reminded me of the old days when we used to pick and pan-fry fresh morels.  So good.  The garlic-mayo dipping sauce though was too thick and garlicky for me.  I&#39;d have preferred something lighter, maybe a marinara, something with a bit of acid.

My green salad was very good, especially with the optional chevre cheese added.  My salmon entree was good too, but the fish was nearly raw in the middle.  I don&#39;t like fish overcooked, but wasn&#39;t prepared for sushi either, so I saved it and microwaved it for lunch the next day.  That turned out just fine.

Although it was too hot to sit outside on this visit, we have enjoyed the patio other times.  I&#39;m always ready to return to Adelle&#39;s and I love that it has a solid menu that pleases a variety of people.

Anyway the food was very good,  the menu had some very interesting choices along with some typical american fare. We had salads and small plates which were all good.

First we had to wait 10 mins for the waiter to show up and say hi and get our drinks. She gave us the menus and then another 20 mins went by , until she came to take out order.
We waited over an hour for the food!!!!! That is totally unacceptable. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever waiter this long to get the food. The waiter only came by once to apologize and said the food should be right out. .... 30 mins later and it&#39;s still not there.

We went the other night again - pretty good service, good drinks (waiter suggested a beer flight to my husband - which he appreciated)
We had appetizers - one shrimp dish was toooo spicy.  then we split an entree of pasta - great taste - chicken and shrimp.  They should have left out the shrimp - too dry.
I think that is my general experience at Adelles - they raise your expectations with one item and then mildly disappoint with another.  Too bad they can&#39;t be consistent with the &#34;great&#34; experience."

I would give this place 6 stars if I could. Their menu changes based on foods in season. It is one of the only places I know that tries to serve local, in season food, or at least sustainable if not. For example, hey so not buy endangered fish not do they buy from the big fisheries, but real fisherman instead. As a vegetarian this means a lot to me. The other three eaters at the table are meat eaters and all loved their meals. We all agreed it is one of he best restaurants we have tried in years, and they eat out all the time in Chicago and Naples, FL. I was excited by how many vegetarian options were available, and almost everything on the menu was very creative and original. I loved the portabella fries and the two salads I tried. Cannot overstate how much I loved it. Oh and the beer, wine and cocktails menus are very well thought out. I love beer and the options they have here are fantastic and creative as well. Way to go Adelles. Thank you for offering something different and tasty. And thank you for putting options on your menu at all price points. A &#34;small plate&#34; is $7-10, and could easily be a meal at least for me. We did not go cheap on our meal here, but a $15/person bill could be achieved here if you wanted.

Very nice and quiet and not too much.  The cuisine was absolutely incredible as well.  My dad ordered a pork tenderloin that was to die for and I ordered a salmon dish with postacchio crumbled on top and a delicious coconut-curry sauce underneath that was perfectly subtle.  Not only was our dining experience fantastic, but we had the great fortune of talking with the chef himself!  Boy, what a treat!  It was amazing to see how passionate the chef was about making delicious food..  I would recommend this restaurant to everyone and anyone interested in an amazing dining experience!"
adelles-fine-american-fare-wheaton,Dave S.,viNNiVtWSSBCbNPwuNV65A,"Lombard, IL",0,1,0,30,9,MHuajdsB3MkMp9P4-y3TIg,3.0,2012-07-18,"&#34;Pork and beans.&#34; That&#39;s what they call it. 99% of the contents of the can consists of beans. You&#39;ll be lucky to find one tiny morsel of pig in there, and yet &#34;pork&#39; gets top billing. 

Adelle&#39;s fare is certainly more upscale than pork and beans, and the three small dishes we ate last night were certainly pleasant, but they weren&#39;t what we expected them to be. 

The Adelle&#39;s sign itself smacks of prairie style architecture, and while the inside was pleasant, it wasn&#39;t prairie style. They also couldn&#39;t decide the level of lighting in the room. Once you got used to the low level, they&#39;d lower it again. Either have good lighting or turn it off, please. Besides, the three small plates we ordered deserved to be seen clearly as works of art.

First small plate: the baby spinach salad. What little spinach we received was fine, mixed with spring greens and a orange-thyme vinaigrette. But there was much more: &#34;trio of fresh berries, oranges, toasted almonds, oven-dried goat cheese.&#34; The first plate seemed more about the berries than the greens. Not much goat cheese and the thinnest-sliced almonds I&#39;ve ever experienced. Pretty nice, though I wish some more baby spinach would&#39;ve been included in the baby spinach salad. 

Second small plate: cheese and fruit plate. The daily menu lists each of three cheeses, along with a final line about candied nuts, crackers, and toast points with blueberry and honey dipping sauces. What arrives is a gorgeous plate of food, with a few problems. There was little actual cheese. It was decent, though mostly lacking in bite, but the amount itself was very small, especially since cheese got top billing. Two, there was fruit. In addition to what was listed, two slices of watermelon came, and guess what else? More berries! Lots of &#39;em! Along with many, many grapes. 

It was an impressive-looking plate, but it was way too busy. Imagine an artist-in-training painting a still life. The teacher wouldn&#39;t want so many different types of food as the object, as it can distract from the theme. And the theme was supposed to be cheese. But again, it was fruit. I got a full week&#39;s supply of vitamin C and a big helping of antioxidants with all of the blackberries, raspberries and grapes. 

Third small plate: &#34;Moroccan lamb chops, saffron-preserved lemon couscous, golden raisins, spiced almonds, arugula, Harissa sauce.&#34; As you can guess, this plate wasn&#39;t about the lamb chops. Though they were delicate and tasty, both of them were small. But there sure was a lot of couscous on my plate, and I can&#39;t say that I liked it. It had a different mouth-feel than the couscous I&#39;ve had before, and had little flavor to it. The few almonds had no spice; the concentrated Harissa sauce packed a major punch. At least there were no more berries. 

So what I ordered was a salad, cheese and lamb chops, and what I got was berries, a few greens, berries, a little cheese, couscous and a little lamb. Adelle&#39;s should either re-think the proportions in their small plates or change the names of them. 

That&#39;s my big complaint. But we&#39;ll be back. Why? Because most of what we tasted was quite good. Because they have a large selection of plates. Because we had fun trying to find the one person that was using a black napkin instead of white. (Black cloth napkins are an option, and when asked, our server told me that one person in attendance uses black. So if you were at Adelle&#39;s and saw two people glancing at your crotch, nice to meet you.) 

Why else? Because we received swift service, especially early on. Because the bar looks pleasant and they offer jazz twice a week. And because our small plates were actually reasonable in price. (We chose not to drink, but on Tuesdays, you can bring your own wine without a corking fee.)

I look forward to raising the number of stars to four next time, if Adelle&#39;s puts the pork before the beans. Or call just it &#34;beans and pork&#34; already."

 FIELD GREENS, fresh strawberries, goat cheese crumbles, toasted almonds, raspberry vinaigrette and

I don&#39;t know how we have lived in the suburbs for this long without ever hearing about this place!

They offered a prix fixed menu for the evening and everything we had was absolutely delicious.  We kept eating off of each other&#39;s plates and couldn&#39;t decide what we liked better.  The risotto, as other reviewers have mentioned, is absolutely divine.  For entrees we had the seared Hawaiian Tuna and the Skate, both of which were tender and flavorful.  Even the salad was extraordinary  - a delicious combination of berries and citrus fruits wth a lime-cilantro vinagrette.

Dessert was a trio, and I could have eaten two plates full of that bread pudding.  I didn&#39;t even think I liked bread pudding until I tried this.  I am still thinking about it and probably will be dreaming about it until we can get back there and have it again.  Hope it&#39;s still on the menu!

Our server was very nice and attentive.  I&#39;m glad I asked what is in their Meat Loaf as it turns out it has pork and neither of us eat pork. So we both ended up having Pan Seared Chicken Breast which was quite tasty.

Soup was served - was tasty, but different amounts in each bowl some more-some less than others. 
Then the finger sandwiches were served. They served family style the same quantity of finger sandwiches on each plate (4 egg salad, 4 cucumber and chicken salad cherry tomatoes) , regardless of number of people at table(table of 6-8 rec&#39;d same amount as tables for 4-5). I over heard the larger table ask for additional sandwiches and they only brought cucumber sandwiches and egg salad. I overheard the server tell them he will bring the &#34;warm sandwich&#34; - ham and cheese as soon as it is ready. (He passed that request along to person in charge and they said those are gone)..The larger table didn&#39;t even receive one of every selection each- that is very poor planning! The tables were set up even some empty seats, so why the shortage of food??! Plus this is a restaurant, why couldn&#39;t they accomodate? 
Ok, it was a &#34;Tea&#34; it was a bite to eat, not meal. 
The worst part was when the restaurant opened at 4pm and Hostess started to seat people and they were escorted THRU the middle of the room where the shower was going on or out to the patio so the door was opening and closing(not softly either) along with clanging of water glasses(the shower was until 5pm)! How unprofessional was that, people were trying to hear what the bride-to-be was saying, who the gifts were from, etc!
Let me say, that I can overlook most things, but this was just ignorant and unprofessional and people from our two tables nor I will NOT be visiting this place ever again! It was first and only time!

Great atmosphere, great and very knowledgable staff, very accommodating if you need a change to a meal due to allergies or dislikes. They always want you to enjoy the time there.
Live music several times a week/month.
Great wine list with some great specials (1/2 bottles and/ or no corkage) on weekdays.
A must &#34;go to&#34; place!!!"

The ambiance sent mixed signals.  Quite clearly, the intention of the dining room was high-style.  However, the music, the service, and the menu left much to be desired.  We began with two martinis under the blaring speaker which developed sounds from Big Band music to baby cries and crowds cheering.The service was lacklustre.  The specials were pre-printed but the server mumbled through them anyway.

I chose the lamb shank.  Honestly, lamb is one of the hardest meats to ruin, but you can over-cook and then microwave it.  Congratulations Adelle&#39;s, you screwed it up.  The lamb was moist but stringy. ($25)  Although plated well, the sides were uninspired with plain mash potates, oyster mushrooms, and steamed brussel sprouts.  The greatest advantage was the sprig of fresh rosemary, which had the only pleasant aroma on the plate.  (No rosemary was detectable in the lamb.)

My dining partner had the Adelle&#39;s trio of mini-burgers appetizer for his entree. ($14!) They came with fries, which were horribly over-salty, chewy, and soggy.  Clearly, they had not been fried at the right temperature since they were incredibly oily.  The mini-burgers were fine, but I&#39;ve had better in a pub.(at $7)  They were topped with noxious mini-gherkins (weird flavor).  They came in three varieties.  In deference to the high class decor and pricing, they were served with piquant and inventive dipping sauce. Wait, no they weren&#39;t. They were served with ketchup. Just ketchup. From a bottle. 

In short, the menu of Adelle&#39;s is totally uninspiring, poorly executed, and not worth the price.  The martinis were good. ($10.50/ea)"

It&#39;s always an embarrassment when you bring other people to a place you thought was good and it turns out otherwise.  On this trip we decided to skip appetizers so we would have room for dessert.  At our table of four, no one was happy with their entree.  We had:

Wiener Schnitzel ($23) - This consisted of two smallish pieces of meat.  The meat was tough and the breading was greasy.

Parmesan Crusted Chicken Breast ($21) - The chicken itself and the mashed potatoes were OK.  The onion rings were greasy and VERY SALTY.  The menu said &#34;grainy Dijon mustard cream sauce&#34;.  We could find none of this on the plate.

Fennel Crusted Pork Tenderloin ($23) -  There was a strong horseradish taste to the dish.  The menu did not say anything about horseradish in the dish.

Osso bucco ($26) - This was the smallest portion of osso bucco I have ever seen.  The meat was dry and tough.  There was a layer of tough fat around the outside.  After trimming this off, there wasn&#39;t much actual meat left.  This came with a small apple bratwurst and risotto.  Why would you put bratwurst on an osso bucco dish?

Oh, well.  We were looking forward to our desserts to save the meal.  For dessert we had:

Key lime pie ($6) - This was good and the best of what we had.

Warm fruit crisp ($8) - It wasn&#39;t warm. The person that had this commented that the fruit crisp at Cracker Barrel was better.

Warm bread pudding ($8) - This was warm and was OK.

Turtle brownie sundae ($8) - The brownie was more of a piece of very hard fudge.  It was so hard it was almost inedible.  I left 80% of it on the plate.  After finishing I noticed a HAIR on the side of the bowl! Yuck.

Adelle&#39;s was a huge disappointment for all at our table of four.  It was a combination of poor food, food that did not match the menu description,  confused dishes (osso bucco and bratwurst on the same plate.  Risotto with pineapple. Cinnamon with scallops.)  Adelle&#39;s also feels like it is overpriced for what you get.  $32 for flat iron steak!  I don&#39;t think so.

Our server was good as was the food runner.  The busser was OK but water glasses were not refilled.

Bottom line: We probably won&#39;t be back."

Kind of a random selection on a Sunday afternoon, based on one diner&#39;s previous visit, I am looking forward to a return trip for more of the same. 

We started with a couple appetizers - portobello french fries and a cinnamon scallop dish. I requested the fries...like a fool, I read &#34;french fries&#34; and assumed it would be just that, but with a little mushroom. As if portobellos are shavable like truffles. Instead it was delicious &#34;sticks&#34; of mushroom fried in almost a tempura batter, and served with a heavily garlic aioli. The aioli wasn&#39;t needed, but the mushrooms were very good. The scallops were...fine, but honestly, the cinnamon thing wasn&#39;t quite needed. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d do this again, but they were fine. 

We each had salads - I had an arugula salad with shaved fennel, pine nuts, radish slivers, and some baked feta. Really nice and refreshing, with a light vinaigrette and some mandarin orange garnish. The feta especially was interesting, a little browned and shrunken down by the baking, first time I&#39;ve had it that way. 

After agonizing over entrees (I was in the mood for beef, having been unable to get a reservation recently at Gene and Georgetti&#39;s), I was swayed to the risotto of the day by the waitress, and I was really happy about it. Perfect risotto, topped with a mountain of crab and lobster, garnished with two nicely cooked, non-gritty scallops, and drizzled with lemon dill sauce. Only two, minor complaints - one, more lemon dill sauce. It was awesome. And two, the dish included just a couple sun dried tomatoes, which I didn&#39;t think really fit. I ended up picking the out pretty easily. I didn&#39;t try them, but others enjoyed a pecan crusted salmon, which was reportedly good, but a undercooked in the middle (nothing the microwave couldn&#39;t fix for lunch the next day, apparently), and a steak, which was also reportedly good (and the pooch appreciated the small leftover portion). But man, the risotto...I made the right choice. 

Desserts were also good. I split a blueberry bread pudding with caramel and creme anglaise. The bread pudding was solid, not runny and the caramel was really thick and &#34;caramelly tasting&#34; (which, not all is, unfortunately). Just tasty all around, and a generous helping. 

My entree was available in both entree and appetizer portions - I had the entree portion, but I would return for an appetizer serving of the day&#39;s special and those mushrooms and be pretty happy about it."

If you&#39;re on a date, come here. 
If you&#39;re making up after a fight, come here. 
If you&#39;re trying to impress a client, come here. 
If you just want a quiet and interesting meal where you and your significant other can simply reconnect, come here. 

That&#39;s what we did tonight and we weren&#39;t sorry. This is not a particularly fancy place. But I think it&#39;s the entire package that gives it panache. On Tuesday, you bring your own bottle. 

As to the food, please remove your calorie counters from your computer area, close your eyes, and get into this food! We each had an opener: a mushroom risotto with cilantro, scallops and a warm lime butter (drool); the other was spring rolls with a super sweet lobster. Both were great. 

We nixed the salad and evilly plotted a shared dessert. There are nightly specials here, but they have a pretty nice standard offering too. I loved the &#39;am I seeing red hot&#39; seared scallops that came with a sweet corn and yam hash and grilled fennel. My guy had pork that glazed with Bourbon and with a melted cheese pot and swiss chard. 

Okay, right about then, we were groaning inaudibly. It&#39;s not that we downed both dinners, but the food was great enough to savor it nice and slow. Thank God, the coffee came-eth. 

We nibbled on dessert: blueberry bread pudding; with whipped creme, a little bit of fresh coconut, and pineapple. 

I&#39;m surprised the suspension in the car didn&#39;t give way when we got in. But we have a super care package for tomorrow. This was out first time here; it was lovely and mellow. Our waiter was most excellent. 

Isn&#39;t it also lovely that there are Tread-climbers for nights such as this!"

Maybe like fresh paint? It was strange and off putting. It was 3pm on a Saturday, so not busy. Yet it took about 30 minutes to get drinks. Food came out relatively quickly. It looked great, but didn&#39;t have a ton of flavor. Buffalo chicken dip didn&#39;t taste much like buffalo, more like sour cream. Pour House burger didn&#39;t have a lot of flavor either. The fries were good though. And they have a large drink selection.

It&#39;s very appealing inside, with cozy curved booths, banks of TVs over the bar (not too loud, a plus!) and a delightful looking patio. The beer selection is really outstanding of course, the lunch menu less so. I had a Thai chicken wrap and side of salad: $13. Pretty pricey! And I was sadly surprised that it was not in a rice wrapper as I expected, but a tortilla. I will never get used to the midwest definition of a wrap - that tortilla bit surprises me every time. And not in a good way. Anyway, this tortilla assemblage was tasty, with marinated chicken and veggies, fortunately not soaked in dressing. I like that the beers can be had in a smaller size as well as the pint. Just right with lunch. Our granddaughter (2 years old) had a wonderful lunch! A nice bowl of macaroni and cheese with a large side of fruit. She was very content with that, for which we were grateful. My dining companion had a huge burger with (okay) fries - she couldn&#39;t eat it all, so if anyone has a large carnivorous appetite it looks to be easily satisfied here. I wished for more meatless options, myself. I think I&#39;ll come back for dinner - this place seems to me to be better suited for that, atmospherically. Also, it would be a great place to come and watch a game. Oh, one other point - there&#39;s a large round table near the patio door and a tiny space to squeeze through to get to the booths. It made me uncomfortable to squeeze through there and I would have hated sitting at that table in the awkward traffic pattern. Really noticeable and should be changed."

It was a nice day so we sat outside on the patio. The place is brand new and has a nice modern design. The patio was nice but there wasn&#39;t enough shade from the umbrellas and there were also a lot of flying insects everywhere. Our server was prompt and courteous and made a few suggestions on drinks and food. I went with a local brew. They do have an extensive beer list. Was bummed that they ran out of GumballHead. Food wise we had the buffalo chicken dip for an appetizer and I went with the meat loaf. The buffalo dip was good. I found the meat loaf underwhelming. The carrots and peas looked like they came straight out of a freezer bag. Service was good. Not sure I would return for the food. Maybe just to have some drinks sometimes.

Lots of ingredients make it too chunky. The clams weren&#39;t fresh. My friend had ribs. She found them too smoky. They were rubbed with something and had very little sauce.  It wasn&#39;t hard to get a table at 7pm on a Saturday night.  I found the interior very cold and industrial.

She gave me a menu and took my order but that was the last I saw her until I flagged her down for the check.  I was able to get the attention of another bartender to order the second flight and a couple others for questions I had.

I am giving 4 stars instead of 5, because I was surprised at our bill. We had a total of 6 beers and 1 appetizer and our bill was $67 before tip.  The beers were under 9%, so I was surprised at the $8/$8.50 price point.

Bad, slow service with an unfriendly server, limited menu choices, overpriced food.  Our meals were not even good.  they advertise their fries as these special fries with parsley and olive oil, but they were just regular ol&#39; fries.  I don&#39;t even drink beer so I don&#39;t care about the beer.  We just tried this place since it&#39;s new in our neighborhood.

Also, the only kind of soup they have is clam chowder; they should consider offering something more common that most people like, like french onion or minestrone.  Only about 3 appetizer choices, all overpriced.  

Very disappointing.  We will not be back and will not recommend it to friends.  Come here if you really love beer.  Otherwise, skip it."

The beer selection was okay, however, compared to competitors such as Yard House, which also offers a extensive selection of craft beer, the beer selection could improve. The sours and Imperial IPA offering was very limited.  Regarding the food, I can only speak to the Duck Confit Nachos. The duck was rather plain, however, it was accompanied by a variety of fresh complimentary ingredients. I have to rave about the house pickled jalapeños, which in my opinion was &#34;the&#34; accent to the dish. The cheese sauce fell far from expectations and resembled a simple roux. It needs more character.  If a second visit is merited I&#39;d probably stick with their signature burger per the description. Let&#39;s only hope it executes well. Cheers!"

Although serving staff seem friendly enough they simply are not attentive- twice we sat at bar and had to flag down other servers and in one case the front door girl in order to get the check/ service. Once when sat at a table it was 10minutes without a server coming by so we ditched. Could be much better if some effort went into customer service

The Positives
- Beautiful indoor and outdoor space
- Attentive servers
- The meatloaf is some of the best around, flavorful and cooked very well, and great red eye gravy

The NOT-so Positives
- Incredibly slow bar service - us, as well as several tables we could hear around us had issues with beverages arriving.  One table had their 2nd drink arriving after they finished meal and obviously no longer wanted it, with server suggesting it could be &#34;dessert&#34;.
- Drink inconsistency - ordered signature Cucumber melon martini - first 2 arrived green, last arrived red with server stating &#34;it was a different bartender&#34;.  If it&#39;s one of their signature cocktails on the menu, shouldn&#39;t *all* the bartenders know how to make the same signature drink?
- Fried Pickles - too salty, especially w/ salty ranch dressing and very greasy - soaked up the extra grease of one piece that saturated a cocktail napkin
- Short-rib Dinner - $24 dinner which is one of the most expensive on the menu, mine arrived as literally 95% gristle, side of grits were incredibly bland and tasteless and gritty (not in the good way), shrimps were straight out of a grocery store pre-cooked fish department, with zero seasoning or flavor.
- Meatloaf side dishes - supposed to be Yukon Gold, but clearly russets as they were as white as rice, dry and a bit musty in flavor, carrot/pea side had way undercooked carrots to the point they were almost raw.
- Portions - seem to be the right size unless you need to take home leftovers, but their plating eludes to the fact you are getting appetizer sized portions on enormous plates.

In the end, I am not one to want to send food back and this was probably only the 2nd time I&#39;ve done so, but the shortrib dinner was just incredibly awful.  The manager was nice enough to comp the shortrib meal in looking at it and realizing it was &#34;not their standard&#34;, but assured us the &#34;Executive Chef and two sous chefs&#34; hold the highest of standards - may have been easier to believe had he tucked in his dress shirt and wore big boy shoes and not gym shoes.

Time of my visit: Very, very late dinner

Full disclosure, I have been a regular here for a few years, so I will be a bit bias, as I know what&#39;s good, what&#39;s not, who is a good server and who is not.

Right of the bet, stay away from fish fries, not the best thing on the menu.  Chicken fingers on the other hand is the best thing on the menu (I promise, I will review them at a later date).

My girlfriend and I came here after a movie.  We decided to have something other than chicken fingers.  We ordered an appetizer (half an order of stake nachos, see the picture attached).  Even at half and order, it was hard for two people to finish them.  It was loaded with stake (I must say, pretty generously), cheese, salsa and topped of with sour cream and guacamole.

I ended up ordering full slab.  I opted out for fries (but if you have never had their garlic mash potato, that&#39;s a must!).  The ribs were outstanding, not the best I have ever had, but the taste wise up there.  The way I judge ribs is by bbq sauce, how it&#39;s prepared (smoked, baked, etc.), how the meat falls off the bone, chewiness of the meat, overall quality of the meat.  And yes, not being a food critic, I can tell.  The bbq sauce was good, the meat did not have any fat on it, it was not falling of the bone at a first touch, but was not hard enough to where it was hard to bit into it, it was just firm enough.

On to the service, as I always say, it&#39;s a big part of the restaurant experience.  Today, our server was awesome!  She was very attentive, very nice, checked up on us, refilled our water and got a very nice tip because of that.

Overall, reasonably priced for the area.  If you are in Wheaton, IL, definitely a must try.  A sold A+ in my book!"

It&#39;s a family style restaurant and bar with lots of TVs, music, and outside seating. They have a large drink selection and a very full menu.

The nachos are amazing and huge. Definitely don&#39;t order them unless you are hungry.

The best thing on the menu and what is talked about the most are the chicken tenders. They come with honey mustard sauce on the side and it&#39;s a perfect combination. The platter comes with fries and a starter (either salad or soup). It&#39;s a lot of food.

They also have amazing burgers, sandwiches and salads. Definitely a good place to go with family or friends."

I really wanted to like this place but was quite disappointed with BOTH meals i had there. Ordered what they call pork medallions but turned out to be nothing more than a VERY dry butterflied pork chop covered in sauce. It was so dry had to send it back. I then decided to order the prime rib. That was probably the worst piece of prime rib i have ever had. It was very dry and extremely tuff. Really couldn&#39;t even eat it, but didn&#39;t have the nerve to send back a second dish. My friend had the pot roast sandwich and said it was just &#39;ok.&#39; Nothing special. On a side note, our waitress couldn&#39;t have been nicer. She was very nice and pleasant. I&#39;m really sorry to say, i probably won&#39;t be returning any time soon."

&#34;But this is the SUBURBS,&#34; I moaned.

This isn&#39;t Schaumburg, Geneva, or some other upscale downtown suburban spot.  But Village Tavern is a local favorite, and the secret&#39;s out.  I met some friends here who live nearby, and they were not surprised by the wait at all.  20 minutes was bearable, but I&#39;m still shocked that this casual Carol Stream spot had a wait at all.

Yes, it was worth it.  The Chicken Tenders are massive, but looking around the restaurant, supersize me portions are the norm at Village Tavern.  I only ate two chicken tenders and had a lot leftover for lunch the next day.  If you&#39;re a fan of Chili&#39;s chicken crispers, these taste exactly the same.

The rest of the menu has a little bit of everything - burgers, pork chops, salads, soups, sandwiches, there&#39;s even a fish fry.  It&#39;s all top notch comfort/diner food.

The interior isn&#39;t anything special, but it is a comfortable environment for families, to watch a game, and it was fine to grab dinner and catch up with friends.  The service was OK, we tried to order drinks but they never came.  Our food came up pretty fast and by then we were fine with the missing drinks.  This is one busy restaurant and, aside from the missing drinks, the waitress we had was pretty attentive and split up our checks without us asking.

Probably one of the best options in Carol Stream!"

After reading the reviews on here, we decided to give VT a try.

We got there around 6:30pm and it was really crowded. The wait was about 45min for a table, however we were able to snag two bar spots right away. We actually prefer to sit in the bar area, so this was a major win. 

Our bartender was super friendly and considering how busy she seemed, she was very attentive and was happy to serve us. We both ordered drinks and took a few minutes before dinner. The place was getting more and more crowded, but it seemed like they were handling it well. I noticed back by the kitchen, the cooks put the food up on a ledge where the food runners grab it. Well what I noticed was that it seemed like food was sitting there for a very long time. I&#39;m not sure what the reason was, but it was concerning. None the less, we decided to order dinner.

She went with the &#34;world famous&#34; chicken tenders and I went with the dinner special, which was the prime rib. I&#39;m a huge prime rib fan, and even though it&#39;s not a steakhouse, this place seemed to me like the type of place that would have phenomenal prime rib, it just had that feeling. Unfortunately I was WAY wrong.

Our food came out after about 20-25min, which was to be expected. EVERYTHING was cold. Her chicken fingers, her fries, my prime rib, and mashed potatoes. EVERYTHING. Also, I had ordered my prime rib medium, which is typically a pink center, and it came out well-done. There wasn&#39;t an ounce of pink, it was completely dark, dry, and honestly terrible. We didn&#39;t want to be a pain in the butt, so we just ate a few bites each and decided we were done. 

The bill came and with tip it ended up being around $70. I must say, I haven&#39;t been that disappointed in a long time. We had read such great reviews on this place and came in with such high expectations, and they completely disappointed. The only reason it&#39;s getting two stars is because the waitress was friendly, and because they had a couple slot machines in the corner which was some fun (even though we lost). 

I&#39;m not sure if we just caught this place on a bad night or what, but I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ll be back. The food was terrible, mostly because it wasn&#39;t even close to warm, and my prime rib was as dry as can be. Disappointing to say the least."

70% of the current 170 reviews talk about chicken...and I will too!

I was in the area for an event and got out kind of late. Being that this was only two blocks up the street from where I was. I figure I&#39;ll try it out. Came in after 10 pm. Notice the all you can eat fish fry. I hadn&#39;t ate at all that day. So my attention when I ordered the fish was to put them out of business.

Fish comes with a salad or soup. I asked for the Caesar salad. Was told it was an extra $1 (call it being cheap but was a little irked by this) Salad was kind of big but I guess with all you can eat pushing something out this size is to slow a few people down. I ate about half my salad before the fish came out.  LARGE size portions so much I had to take one fillet home and didn&#39;t even ask for a 2nd round. (hit&#39;s imaginary table in defeat)  So kudos to them. Due to not being that satisfied I decided to check out the yelp and notice the mention of chicken tenders in all the reviews so got an order to go. 

Service was nice and fast overall. So no complaints there.

Food wise I didn&#39;t care for it. The battered breading for both the fish and chicken were okay, but both items had the same problem to me. The meat part was to chunky. I wouldn&#39;t say tasteless just didn&#39;t have a great taste that made me want to order it again. I had to keep dipping my fish in the tartar sauce. (I usually just eat the fish without) Not to be mean but Gortons frozen beer battered fish had better flavor to me. I didn&#39;t try the chicken right away. So having to reheat them the next day they became soggy. Due the large chunk size I ended up putting in the microwave probably a few seconds longer than normal to make sure they were hot all the way through but might have dried them out. (it&#39;s white meat so it was already dry) I will say I would love to try out the nachos something I also didn&#39;t know they were famous for until after."

Our server Gabrielle was very friendly. The Diablo shrimp, endorsed by Gabrielle,  was fantastic. The sauce was reminiscent of a light alfredo in texture but in flavor there was hint of sweet with a nice spicy kick swirling in a beautiful Orange color. The shrimp was very fresh, plump, and flavorful. The chicken fingers are made Halal chicken breast. I  could taste the difference. They had a lot of flavor, very tender, and  fried to a perfect golden better. The loaded baked potato that came with it I was just as good.

We&#39;ve went on Saturday for lunch and although there were a lot of people, the space is pretty roomy and there were plenty of places to eat.  I haven&#39;t checked out the bar area, but it looks roomy as well.
I tried the fish and chips platter and wow, it was pretty hefty.  Huge pieces of fish in a beer batter of some sort.  Delicious and very filling.  I couldn&#39;t finish the plate which doesn&#39;t happen often, unfortunately.  It was still good the next day with a little nuke.
I also tried the shrimp diablo.  Nice big pieces of shrimp in a fairly mild/medium sauce.  It was pretty yummy.
They have a little kids menu with some crayons.  There is a connect the dots and some other kid activities.  Plenty of tv&#39;s, although certain seats don&#39;t have the greatest viewing angles.  The servers and staff are all very nice from what I&#39;ve seen.  Both times I&#39;ve went, we brought in our stroller, and everyone was very accommodating.
This has turned into a nice family lunch spot for us.  I&#39;m glad I checked it out, you should too!"

Their chicken fingers are particularly tasty, cooked and battered to perfection. Great family and comfortable atmosphere. My 3 year old and 1 year old girls love going here for lunch. The bathrooms are nice and easily accessible. The staff is is pretty friendly. However, I did ask for a side of BBQ sauce and was charged 75 cents for it. Not a big deal but it would have been nice if the waitress had mentioned it when I asked. It&#39;s always been packed when we went, which I always view as a good sign."

Other than that, it doesn&#39;t stand out. Servers are usually pleasant but sometimes you get the complete opposite. Every food item is consistently mediocre. One huge bonus is the multitude of tvs playing every sport you could ever want to see. Great place to meet friends or take the kids and still be able to watch your team live. They do have daily specials from apps, entrees, drinks, and desserts. I can appreciate that. Beware you will wait up to 45 min on a weekend night. Friday is fish fry and Saturday is prime rib."

Went there tonight for the first time, as it is near my husband&#39;s business. We were seated immediately (GOOD). Our waitress recommended the burgers, so I ordered a cheeseburger cooked well-done. My husband ordered the pork chop meal. Our food was served in a timely fashion (GOOD). I only ate half the burger--it was charred crispy on the outside and rare, under-cooked on the inside (BAD); served on a fluffy sesame seed bun that immediately fell apart into many pieces as soon as the burger was picked up (BAD); and they serve the burger dry, no mayo, no mustard, no ketchup, nothing (BAD). The fries were blah--what you get at a cheapo hot dog stand. My husband enjoyed his pork chop and au gratin potatoes (GOOD), but the carrots were very mushy, over-cooked and tasted the same as canned candied yams from Thanksgiving (BAD).

In the meantime, our waitress only came by once (BAD), right after our food was served, before I even noticed how raw my burger was. After that, she forgot about us (BAD), never came back to re-fill our soda (THE WORST!!!) until after we had completely finished our meal and were sitting there awkwardly waiting for the bill. Once we got the bill, we had to sit there awkwardly again for another 15 minutes, waiting for the waitress to process our payment. 

Terrible service and cooks that failed the How To Cook Burgers 101 class. Will NOT go to Village Tavern again."

I was first introduced as a tween; then I spent a couple of nights a week here in my mid twenties, and enjoyed the food on all of my visits.  I just recently visited after a long hiatus and I can see that not much has changed about VTG.  It&#39;s still dark, crowded, and smells of old grease. 

I tried the new Nacho Burger (cooked medium).  Much like the rest of their menu items, this burger was dripping with so much grease, it caused the bottom half of the pretzel bun to fall apart. So I had to go the fork and knife route.  I will say it was a tasty burger and cooked to my liking, but eating it with utensils was a bit of a turn off. 

The Chicken Fingers are alright, I&#39;m not a huge fan.  I&#39;ve enjoyed the Chicken Diablo, many of the soups, BLT, hotdog (yes a hotdog), wraps, fajitas, etc.  Pretty much everything except fish, ribs, or bbq. There&#39;s a little something for everyone, and it&#39;s all good stuff if you have an iron stomach and a short ride back to your destination.

My favorite? Honestly a full order of the nachos, with ALL of the meats, and all of the fixin&#39;s.  It can be expensive with all of the additional meat add-ons, but trust me it&#39;s the only way to go.

Maybe I&#39;m spoiled from growing up in the area, but VTG is just an average spot with average food.  It can be a fun place to come, have drinks and watch a sports game if you&#39;re bored with B-Dubs.  It&#39;s worth a try if you&#39;re in the area."

Of course the Chicken Fingers are wonderful...as most people remark on. The portions are big! Sometimes I just get the soup of the day and the Chicken and I end up taking home some.

Wait staff is attentive and service is fast. And this place is always busy...it amazes. me. 

Another great service of the Tavern is that they are great at posting their specials on Social Media. So you may have Facebook on, it&#39;s getting close to lunch and THERE is the soup of the day. Makes you hungry.

I highly recommend Village Tavern for food, service, pricing, and atmosphere."

That&#39;s pretty much all I would get whenever my parents would take us out to a restaurant. I could tell you which place had the best breading, which place had the stringiest meat, and whose honey mustard sauce was the most disgusting. So trust me when I say that Village Tavern has some of the best chicken fingers that I&#39;ve ever had in my life. 

For $10 you get a platter of huge pieces of chicken breast, coated in a fluffy batter and fried to a golden brown. I often asked for my chicken well done, so I could get my crunch on. The fingers come with a side of their famous honey mustard, which is good. But not great.

I&#39;ll tell you what: these always gave me a wicked case of heartburn after I ate them and more than once almost triggered a gallbladder attack. #worthit

Batter was complementary to the fish and not overwhelming like in some places where you hunt to find the fish hidden in all the breading. We had a birthday in our party of 4 adults plus 5 kids ages 4 mo. to 13.  They brought out what looked like a quarter of a chocolate cake! Enough for at least 4 people, lol! It was moist and flavorful with tasty frosting. Our service was great and patient with the kids usual antics.

I had the lobster roll, which was the special for the month. There&#39;s some mention about the owners of Village Tavern and Grill being from Boston in the restaurant, and so I sort of imagine the recipe is from that part of the country. It was more creamy than lobster-y, if that makes any sense. 

My wife had a chicken sandwich, which I vaguely remember being good, and we shared potato skins. These were quite large and very greasy, but a good deal.

Why? I don&#39;t know, I guess we&#39;re change averse. I have no good reason. We got there at 4:30 on a Saturday because... we were STARVING and had decided it was late enough for dinner. Thank goodness we were there so early, because by 5:30 when we left, there was a relatively long wait. 
Our waitress was great. I wish I did things like...remember peoples&#39; names...because she deserves to be recognized for being a good waitress, but ...alas... I don&#39;t. So anyhow, service was great.We were told their tenders were great, so we ordered the sampler platter to try everything. Of the sampler we liked everything except the quesadilla, but I think that&#39;s because we don&#39;t really love quesadillas... so...there&#39;s that. The tenders are amazing. So, it&#39;s probably what I&#39;ll order next time. Onion straws? Yum. Potato skins were good as well. 
 We both ordered the chicken dinner, which was on special for $9.99. It included soup or salad, but with beer cheese soup we both got the soup... It was very good but very heavy... so if it&#39;s beer cheese soup day, just a forewarning, it will fill you up. The chicken was extremely good. It was fried in their tender batter...and covered in gravy. It came with asparagus and mashed potatoes. All in all, we thought everything we got was good. 
The only thing that disappointed us about the place was the fact that we hadn&#39;t tried it earlier! We&#39;ll be back, and we&#39;ll try other things... and I&#39;m hopeful we&#39;ll continue to have such wonderful experiences!"

The food took a long while to arrive but was worth it once they did.   The steak was perfectly seasoned and mostly melted in my mouth as I chewed.

I go to ask the bartender if this is going to be a full set or what, because we are leaving if it is.  &#34;Oh no.. they only play one song.&#34;  That was bs, next thing you know, the full parade band from the fire department joins in and 10 people are blasting this crap throughout the dining room, at sound levels that were way above the legal limit that - yes - the fire department is supposed to enforce.

A word of caution:  The nachos are not as good as they once were (sadly).  We&#39;ve had them and watched them decline over the last 12+ years even though the price has kept going up and up.  Lesson learned, we don&#39;t get the nachos anymore (even though my hungrier half always talks fondly about them).

My hubs got his stand-by, the Juanita wrap &amp; fries, which he devoured in the blink of an eye, so I&#39;m guessing it was alright.  Everyone else at the table got some form or another of the oh so delicious chicken fingers.  Our friend got the classic platter with fries, his wife got the chicken finger salad (and rightfully ordered them tossed in buffalo sauce and drowned in ranch), and I got the ceasar salad with chicken fingers (also tossed in buffalo sauce because, let&#39;s face it, everything tastes better in buffalo).

Judging by the overall silence during chow time, I&#39;d say everyone was pretty darn satisfied with the chicken fingers.  Even our kiddos, who barely eat human food, devoured the delectable chicken, one tiny piece at a time (sans fried goodness - for their health&#39;s sake).

Dining at the Village Tavern is like coming home.  It&#39;s warm, comfy, slightly drunk &amp; just feels so damn good."

I&#39;ve been a few times, most recently for lunch on a Tuesday, and even then it was packed.  I still don&#39;t see the attraction so maybe it&#39;s just me.  They DO offer a monster nacho plate that&#39;s a lot of fun.  Otherwise, eh...  Other than the nachos there&#39;s nothing memorable for me here.  On my most recent visit I had the BLT and it was pretty dull.  

They add an 18% tip on for parties over 8.  While I understand the impulse to do this I find it to be offensive and a deterrent."

We took it off our &#34;night out&#34; list due to the poor service. Saw their ad recently and was tempted by the Sat. night $15.95 rib special. They do serve good ribs!!! So back we went and it was crowded at 8:00 p.m. While the service wasn&#39;t great, it was much improved from before. 

We both ordered the rib special, and had to wait an extra 10 minutes for napkins and the bone basket. Vegetable of the day was broccoli, which arrived limp and overcooked. Ribs were awesome, but the cooks on staff need an au gratin potato recipe. What was plated was hot, potato chunks covered with melted cheddar and some chives. No seasoning, nothing au gratin about it. What happened to the au gratin recipe of years past?

We might go back, but not any time soon. And next time I&#39;ll order french fries."

Good thing we went on a rainy day, or I might have found the lack of sunlight downright depressing. But I went here for one thing and one thing only...

I&#39;ve heard of their magical chicken fingers time and time again, most notably from respected Yelper Heidi K. So try them, I had to. And I wasn&#39;t disappointed! Just the right amount of crunch, just the right amount of grease, and obviously tasty chicken. I may actually be salivating just typing this. And the &#34;finger sauce&#34; that accompanies an order? Yum!

I also sampled my sister&#39;s cheese burger. It was okay, but paled so much in comparison to the chicken that I&#39;d say, don&#39;t bother with it. What IS definitely worth mentioning is that their chicken tortilla soup is THE BEST SOUP I&#39;VE EVER HAD! I wouldn&#39;t have minded a ten gallon jug of it to take home.

Service was just okay. We had to ask for water refills, which is never good.

I&#39;ve since made two catering orders, one large and one small, both consisting entirely of chicken fingers. Ordering and pickup were smooth. For my baby&#39;s birthday, everyone raved about the chicken (of course!) Glad to have a go-to crowd pleaser."

My absolute favorites always involve the chicken crispers. Whether its a caesar wrap, salad, or fingers alone, they are amazing. The honey mustard dipping sauce is my favorite sauce for chicken fingers/nuggets/strips. Id really love to watch some Bulls games there. I work a few minutes from it, so I usually take out. I would appreciate it a ton more if they had better beers. I could really enjoy some fingers with a Lagunitas. I will always make an effort to stop here if Im nearby."

If last night&#39;s fried pickle spears, which came crisped up in batter that&#39;s typically reserved for fish &#39;n&#39; chips, were any indication, I do believe that the tenders will rock.

This is the kind of fun, casual, mildly boisterous hangout that every town needs (it feels like Carol Stream&#39;s answer to Anyway&#39;s), and the free WiFi encourages a certain subset of diners and drinkers to linger. Hell, if I had a frickin&#39; car, I&#39;d study here, or at least attempt to. No promises, because beer.

We started with the aforementioned fried pickles, which took rather long to arrive, but we came at peak dinnertime so I won&#39;t be too hard on them for that. I was expecting the usual coins of pickle chips but loved the full-on spears, and even though I don&#39;t dig ranch, it served as a nice, cooling contrast to the blisteringly hot pickles. 

French onion soup needed a more restrained hand with the salt and had a generic beef broth-y flavor, but this isn&#39;t a Parisian brasserie--my hopes weren&#39;t high to begin with. I hardly needed a knife to cut through Swedish meatballs, plush and juicy as they were, yet I still used one because I can&#39;t stand to cut food with a fork. And although otherwise delicious, my patty melt required a couple of cranks of the salt grinder to bring it up to par, and a ubiquitous but nonetheless agreeable Sierra Nevada Pale helped it go down easily. 

Our server was friendly but not particularly attentive aside from knowing when to ask whether I needed another beer, which is all that really matters, right?"

On my  most recent visit, I ordered the Chicken Finger Platter with Chili as my soup, the vegetable of the day (sicilian blend) without butter (they cook their veggies in butter or oil FYI but you can request to have them not cooked in either), and I also ordered one of their new sides: Sauteed Spinach and Mushrooms (cooked in oil).

I will say that the VTG has added a few items, including san marzano chicken and salmon, as well as the already mentioned sauteed spinach and shrooms. I love the effort!

Back to my meal... Chili was very good as usual. They use a ground beef base with blend of hearty beans. You can request onions, cheese, sour cream, and jalepenos if you&#39;d like as well. As for the main dish... amazing as usual! 6 crispy, unbelievably yummy fingers with ranch and their honey  mustard sauce! I ended up dousing my potato with the mustard too! Their ranch is out of this world, too! I just actually tried the  mustard for the first time in December, and now I&#39;m hooked! I absolutely despise mustard in all its forms... except this one! Maybe I should give others a try? Naaa... I&#39;m sticking with VTG.

In conclusion, the Village is a really cool neighborhood place that has remained consistently consistent ever since I&#39;ve been going there. Their prices are very fair and haven&#39;t changed, which is much appreciated. It can get very crowded during peak times (like all good restaurants) so expect a wait if you go during these times (Friday Fish Fry, Saturday Night). 

The staff also tends to be female, and very good looking. The service is sometimes subpar, but that is not enough to take it from the upper echelon of fantastic restaurants in the Greater DuPage Area!"

We said we were in a rush and just ordered fried food but it took over 15 min to come out. They were busy, but I wish they told us because I would have gone somewhere else before ordering.
I got fried chicken Caesar wrap with sweet potato fries and cole slaw. Chicken pieces were too large and the breading tasted so greasy and fell off. The cole slaw tasted sour. French fries were good. My table ordered burgers and chicken tortilla (creamy) soup which they enjoyed. 
Place was cheap and casual. People were nice but not good quality food. Probably good place to stop by and grab a drink after work and hang out. Very greasy."

That is until today. 

Probably the main reason I haven&#39;t gone here is that I&#39;m just not a big fan of chicken fingers and I know if I come here I&#39;d have to order the &#34;world famous chicken fingers and secret mustard&#34;  at least once. Well that day has finally arrived so here we go:

Chicken Finger Platter (Around $12): Six gigantic chicken fingers each the size of a jumbo hotdog. The batter is light and crispy like a fried fish batter. The chicken itself is where the magic is at. It is unusually juicy and tender as if they brine it or something.  I have to say as someone who doesn&#39;t really care for chicken fingers that much, these are by far the best I&#39;ve ever had. (See picture)

Secret Mustard Sauce: Tastes like honey mustard to me. Not sure what makes it so special. 

Potatoes Au Gratin: came with the platter, was cheesy and good. 

Vegetable beef stew: Pretty generic tasting  except they use ground beef. (See picture)

Overall I&#39;d say this is a more than decent local eatery, it always seems to be pretty packed at night and the service was fast and friendly. If you like chicken fingers or have kids that do, I&#39;d definitely give this place a try. 

BTW: They also have video poker and some slots here which I apparently suck at. Good bye 20 dollars :(."

First, lets get down to the nitty gritty, their chicken fingers. I agree with everyone else, they definitely did change my life. There are absolutely no words that can describe the juicy, tender, full, amazing chicken inside this crunchy, savory, deep fried shell. (That was my failed attempt at describing it BTW.) All these adjectives, and it still does them no justice. Not to mention their secret recipe for their honey mustard sauce that I would probably buy by the pint if I could.

I was first introduced to this place about 6 or 7 years ago, and I&#39;ve been a regular ever since. I don&#39;t think I have ever actually gone there and not gotten the chicken finger platter with a side of their different potatoes. I&#39;ve tried all their potatoes, and my favorite by far are the loaded french fries. 

Another favorite on the menu is their loaded monster nachos...seriously....monster is an understatement for these bad boys. And they&#39;re delicious-ness matches their size. 

My only warning would be that their portions are pretty large. If you&#39;re a first timer and are going with a party of two or three, I STRONGLY recommend you start off with the nachos, then share the chicken fingers. And I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you end up taking some of it home.  

As far as prices are concerned, they make me love this place even more. They have gotten TONS of recognition for their chicken fingers over the years, and they have stayed true to themselves and kept amazing prices. My hat comes off to a LOCAL business that can pride themselves in that.

The atmosphere is the perfect cup of tea. It&#39;s so relaxed and laid back. They have televisions with the game on, memorabilia of the town&#39;s history on the walls, a gorgeous patio for beautiful weather, and a HUGE bar that makes you feel like you&#39;re surrounded by friends the minute you walk in. 

As I&#39;m writing this review, I&#39;m seriously realizing this is probably my favorite restaurant ever. It definitely doesn&#39;t get any better than this, guys.....seriously."

She stated that she thought I ordered the chicken platter. Maybe change the name of the platters to defuse confusion? While the rest of my party was eating, I had to wait for my correct order. What really triggered me was not the mess up. It was the fact that the server said she will charge me for the chicken since it was cheaper. Really???? You screw up my order, now I have to take it to go and you are charging me for something I never ordered? After telling her that&#39;s in acceptable, her manager took it off.

6 pieces of the juiciest chicken you have ever had, coated in a batter that&#39;s light, fluffy, and crunchy all at the same time.  Honey mustard sauce so good that, even as someone who doesn&#39;t like mustard, you&#39;ll want to dip yourself in it.  A heaping plate of fries so golden you&#39;ll be ba da da da da lovin&#39; it.  

Do not even think of ordering anything else.

village-tavern-and-grill-carol-stream,Dan B.,3JEwItoTcx_gWjuFAn2TMg,"Bloomingdale, IL",0,1,1,459,6,G5E4pMCzAi0kAXGyOXCKrg,5.0,2013-03-22,"When friends of mine come in from out of town one of the most popular destinations to have a nice lunch or dinner at isn&#39;t a place that serves traditional Chicago style food. It&#39;s not a place serving deep dish pizzas, it&#39;s not a place serving Italian Beef sandwiches, it&#39;s not even a place serving Chicago style hot dogs. It&#39;s Village Tavern which is what I would describe as the ultimate bar food. 

Some time ago one of my very first reviews here on Yelp was of this particular establishment, as quite frankly it&#39;s one of my favorites. However, as time has gone on and I&#39;ve sampled more of their menu I figured now was as good of a time as any to update my review here. The first thing to note about Village Tavern is that it&#39;s both loud and busy. There are lots of TVs set up, generally airing sports in just about every conceivable direction. There&#39;s a large bar with a jukebox and a Golden Tee machine set up nearby for those who want to play it. 

They have a diverse menu including a wide variety of items such as burgers, chicken, soups salads,steak,  and even ribs.  Village Tavern is particularly well known for their chicken fingers. What makes the Village Tavern chicken fingers great is three things, firstly delicious white meat chicken. The second this is a really cripsy batter that is the perfect compliment to the chicken itself and finally a special honey mustard sauce that has just the right amount of sweetness and sourness to be one of the best &#34;dippin&#34; sauces ever tasted by mankind. 

The burgers served here at Village Tavern are excellent as well. The beef has a great flavor to it, and they never overcook it so the juices stay right in the burger. There&#39;s a decent variety of burgers as well as a slider appetizer. I&#39;m a big fan of the burgers here and recommend them.

Being the hot dog critic, it would be silly of me to leave out that they serve something called a Fenway Dog. The Fenway Dog is served on a sweet tasting rolll with mustard, onions and relish. There&#39;s a pickle spear that can be added to it as well. The dog itself is a skinless and jumbo style hot dog. For roughly 5.00, it&#39;s a little pricey but certainly a decent hot dog.

They also have a giant tower of nacho&#39;s as an appetizer called the nachorama containing a variety of toppings. This is another great choice as it will feed a whole table full of hungry people by itself. 

My overall opinion of Village Tavern is quite high. My only complaints are that it can be very loud inside to where if you&#39;re having conversations with people you&#39;re dining with it can be difficult to hear, and that at times it&#39;s so busy there is a long wait and sometimes you have to park quite a ways from the restaurant as parking nearby can be impossible. Overall, I highly recommend Village Tavern in Carol Stream and give it five stars."

Ordered the chicken tender meals to go.  They threw the mashed potatoes over the chicken,  making them extremely soggy.  Chicken was very chewy.  The waitress/hostess seemed more concerned with talking with her friends than taking care of customers.  Over all fail.
Update * two hours later * boyfriend has been hunched over the toilet several times.  At least the Diablo chicken lived up to its name.... I only had the strips so I&#39;m not in as bad of shape."

It&#39;s the &#34;local joint&#34; that my sister has always been obsessed with! She LOVES the &#34;World Famous&#34; Chicken Fingers as it is what they are known for as well as the Nachorama which is way too much NACHO for anyone to intake at one time! They also have specials each night plus a Friday Night Fish Fry which I probably won&#39;t try ever, but just a little FYI!

You will find that this is the typical Carol Stream watering hole. They have holiday specials like on St. Patrick&#39;s Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Halloween, and other holidays. The wait staff are pretty attractive, too!

They do carry out, but dining in is awesome! I&#39;ve had their chicken fingers (awesome), chili (GREAT), fajitas (another good one), burritos, steak, burgers, and even their salmon when I tried to stay nutritious. That was dumb. I should have gotten the chicken that time.

This is a bar with really great bar food. I would take this for dinner over any place in the area. We used to go here in high school ALL the time and get milkshakes too. Slowly over time, those milkshakes turn into alcohol. I guess that&#39;s just part of growing up. Really good prizes plus eating outside in the summer is AWESOME!!!

I highly recommend VTG for some chicken fingers, burgers, and beer if you&#39;re in the area!!!"

The service is always exemplary, fast and very friendly, and when they make a mistake (one time the waitress brought me a chicken burrito instead of chili, I think) they fix it right away.

The mixed drinks are a little inconsistent -- sometimes they&#39;re very strong, other times not so much. Usually we just get beer, so it&#39;s not something we pay much attention to. 

The real reason we come to the Village Tavern is the food! everything on their menu qualifies as comfort food. Their chili cheeseburger is outstanding. The fish fry is also fantastic. Last time I was there I tried the Swedish meatballs and was very pleased. But I have to admit that I usually get the nachos. It&#39;s HUGE. Even when I start out starving, I can&#39;t manage more than a third (...maybe more like a quarter?) of the full order. Which is fine, since I don&#39;t mind taking the leftovers home and snacking on them for the next two days."

The sandwiches are good, the chicken tenders are good, salads are okay, but the fried fish is great. Good hush puppies and fries as well.

The one important thing to note is that they do their tenders and fried fish in a batter, not dredged, so it has more breading that other places. Still - the meat is always moist and tender and the food is consistently good.

Service is usually good, too."

But I&#39;d also like to report that the fish fry isn&#39;t something to disregard either. 

I&#39;ve only come here for lunch and we usually get seated right away.  But the wait here on Friday night was 45 minutes.  45 minutes! I don&#39;t know if it was because it&#39;s Lent or because that&#39;s their usual wait time on Fridays. But our group had their mind set on Fish Fry so we waited it out.  They have enclosed the front overhang so there&#39;s more room to wait. it&#39;s still cold, but the makeshift walls did help block out the wind. 

The fish fry was delicious. It&#39;s AYCE battered cod. The cold is still pretty mild tasting but the batter adds the wonderful crispy coating.  Now I&#39;ve waxed poetic about their honey mustard so it&#39;s no surprise that their tartar sauce is pretty good too.  I hate tartar sauce so I usually use Malt Vinegar but VT&#39;s tartar sauce isn&#39;t that bad, much milder and creamier than store bought. 

Fries and salad are pretty average.  But service is always friendly and the price is totally reasonable.  Family friendly. Lots of TVs so you don&#39;t miss any important sports games. My favorite is still the chicken tenders but if you&#39;re looking for a fish fry, VT doesn&#39;t disappoint."

I remember reading all of the Yelp reviews that raved about their chicken fingers.  Our meal was terrific.  Our server, Ashley, did a great job serving us.  I was impressed with all of the menu options.  I ordered the chicken fingers with au gratin potatoes as my side dish.  The entree came with soup or salad.  I ordered salad because I love creamy garlic dressing.  This was the only part of the meal I was disappointed with.  I was hoping to get a nice, thick, very garlicy dressing.  The dressing was thin and not very flavorful.  The salad itself was really cold and had great croutons on it so that made up for it.

The chicken fingers were really good.  I don&#39;t think I&#34;ve ever had chicken fingers where the actual chicken meat was as tender as these were.  The pieces themselves were huge.  I had lots leftover to bring home.

We&#39;ll come back to this restaurant.  I thought their prices were very reasonable.  It seemed like a nice family restaurant, too."

The macadamia nut  crusted chicken is so good I could probably eat it every day for the rest of my life and I would die a happy man. It&#39;s incredibly full of flavor and just an over all balanced dish. I tried a few other items that my friends ordered but nothing else was memorable. 

The service was good enough, the level expected for a place like this. My water was always full which is a big deal for me. We were greeted when we came in and when we left. The decor is great and provides a great feeling once you walk into the door. The wait for the food was not long and the food came out piping hot. 

A lot of the typical Thai dishes fill the menu so anyone can find something familiar. I would love to try a few other things but I would probably just order that macadamia nut chicken again. It&#39;s SOOOOOOOO good! I will be back for sure :)"

This last time I ordered off their seasonal special menu and got the Ri Roll (Brown rice, avocado, jalapeno, asparagus, carrot, mango, with crispy crumb around outside). Usually I don&#39;t opt for vegetarian rolls when getting sushi but this was fantastic! I loved the crunchy-ness and the veggies on the inside were very flavorful and a tad spicy!

The sushi is amazing I will only come back for the sushi. The St. Charles roll is to die for, they give you a nice portion size for sushi. As far as the main course meals they were....okay. The alcoholic beverages were okay. The banana fritter was very good. 

The service was really good at first then it just started going down hill from there. The entire restaurant probably had 10 tables filled the bar was empty and yet it took forever to get food, and the check. The servers were just standing around talking. We were there a lot longer then we wanted to be. 

If I do come back to this restaurant I will just get sushi to go. The money I spent here was not worth it."

the venue had a very nice ambiance but we felt like our waiter was really busy though the place was half empty. service seemed slow, but he eventually got around to getting us. usually a waiter would repeat back an order or request, but he&#39;d just turn around and walk away as you&#39;re still talking. really offsetting.

1. The food is not fresh. I had St.Charles rolls during happy hour and it tasted like it had sat under the heat lamp for over an hour.

2. The food is not fresh. I ordered a mango cheesecake and the mangos were spoiled.

3. Another visit I ordered the mango cheesecake and it was FROZEN.

4.  The food is not fresh. I ordered vanilla ice cream w some fruit on the side. It was during June 2015 so you would think they would have some sort of fresh fruit. Nope, their fruit selection was spoiled and the presentation was disgusting to look at. I wish they simply said &#34;Sorry, we don&#39;t have fruit&#34;.

5. The drinks are not consistent. I ordered the fresh ginger ale and EVERY time it tastes different. Too watery, too sweet, not enough ginger, too much ginger. Geesh! 

6.  The food is not consistent. It&#39;s very salty at times but at other branches it taste perfect.

Chef goes crazy when u do that and adds ridiculous amount of &#34;hotness&#34; to the dish. Staff is very friendly and hospitable. Highly recommended!"

We had our reservation and got seated quickly. I liked the decor and ambiance. The tables were very close together. The waitstaff couldn&#39;t even walk through without me having to move my chair. The food was very good. The sushi (Mamma&#39;s roll) was AMAZING. I am from a small town, so good sushi is hard to come by there. Our waiter was very nice, and on top of everything. Since it was so busy and so squished, it was quite loud. It was a bit pricey."

It&#39;s from 4-7 Mon/Tues/Thurs/Fri nights on the lounge side, which is prime dinner time, so it most always works... half off appetizers and standard sushi rolls leaves me with a full and happy belly! I LOVE raw fish but I avoid it here- I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to order raw fish at a place that does mostly other (cooked) entrees. Their cooked rolls, though, are delicious. The coconut shrimp appetizer is the perfect crunchy/sweet/fried combination, and their lettuce wraps rival PF Chang&#39;s (or Pei Wei), and the half-off deal makes them a necessity.

This isn&#39;t fine dining, but it&#39;s the perfect place if you&#39;re craving delicious flavors and don&#39;t want to spend much (from 4-7 on the above days, that is!)"

The food is bland and forgettable. Everything I&#39;ve had feels like a sad imitation of what it claims to be. I have yet to order anything I didn&#39;t find disappointing. And I&#39;ve been more times than I would like just because it&#39;s a popular lunch/after work destination for my office. And that is where Wok n&#39; Fire does alright. The restaurant is clean and spacious, it has plenty of seating for groups, they offer economical lunch and happy hour specials, the service is usually fine, and most of the time they will do split checks for large groups. And thanks to the extensive but bland pan-asian menu, some of my picky colleagues who would never go to a decent Thai place or sushi restaurant always seem totally happy to eat at Wok N&#39; Fire. 

I realize I am not this restaurant&#39;s target demographic, but this place still makes me a little sad."

Although I enjoy that they have a happy hour with reduced prices, it is SO SO crowded. Not only that but it is very loud and the service is slow.

We ordered the pad thai with chicken and the Mongolian with scallops. The pad Thai was swimming in a sauce that was more like a brown stir fry sauce and nothing like a pad Thai. The noodles were permeated with it-ick. I had more than half left and had no desire to take the leftovers home, and I love pad Thai.  My husband thought his Mongolian was just ok-but again, too much sauce.

I went here with my Mom on a Monday night, and it was a pretty good crowd. A huge place, when you walk in, to the left is the bar, and then the to the right is the sushi bar and the restaurant area. Now onto the most important part, the food. It is really nice to have a nice place in Wheaton like this. Of course you have the old staples of Asian food, such as Pad Thai, Fu Yuan, Luong Lui/Loi (spelling). We wanted to party, so WOK N FIRE ASIAN FUSION WAS MY MOM&#39;S SELECTION, and since she was paying, and I was heading out of town the next day I wanted to stick it to her with the bill (just kidding, love you Mommy).

Anyway we walked in and we seated by our waiter, James. First off, my mom thought I had a crush on this guy because I addressed him by name several times. I don&#39;t love him, I just like being personable. Anyway, the staff was great. James brought us water, answered a question about a sauce I had, and was always roaming. I got my food from a different waitress and a different man (the host) took our bill. A GREAT TEAM EFFORT AT WOK N FIRE...nice job.

The food: I started with Spinach Egg Drop Soup. Since I like trying new things, I highly recommend. It was so light, with corn, white pepper, and sesame oil. Think of this as the Juan Pierre of my meal. The table setter. Up next, the 2 spot (MY MOM)

She got Pad Thai, and could not even finish it (loser). She wanted me to finish it, but I had my hands and mouth full from my food. This is why I grew up obese, but instead of pad thai, she would give me fries; my dad was way worse though. I am not obese anymore. Karma is a b*tch, because he struggles big time with his weight now. That is mean to say, but then again, I grew up being called fatty thanks to him....hahah HARSH (laughing right now, outloud).

What did I order? Well, after James told me the sauce that I wanted did not have heavy gravy, I ordered the Spicy Shanghai, sauce on the side with scallops. The scallops came breaded, which I wasn&#39;t expecting, It was panko, so it was ok. This was wheat noodles with a good amount of veggies. Really glad I got sauce on the side, because it was very sugary and I only dipped occassionally. THESE SCALLOPS KNOCKED MY SOCKS OFF (and I was wearing tube socks). I also got a side order of spinach with garlic....sorry who ever sits next to me on the plane tomorrow, I am not brushing my teeth until we have a 4 hour convo about capitalism vs. communism, or some other subject that requires a lot of emphasis...haha..

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. As previously mentioned, if I were cheating on my wife, I would take her here because of the decor, darkness, and mystery of Asian FUSION! This place &#34;WOKS&#34;....ahhahahaha....anybody?"

My favorite dish and one I would recommend is the Szechwan. The best thing about the entrees too is the fact that you choose what to include with the entree. I always go with chicken and brown rice to include in my plate but they also have steak, tofu, shrimp, noodles, fried rice you name it! Their pad thai entree as well as their sushi is extremely flavorful too. 

Service has always been on point and they get your order in, and food out to the table quickly. I&#39;ve never once had a bad experience at this restaurant and I&#39;ve gone over a dozen times. If you want some great food and a great price, I would strongly recommend Wok n&#39; Fire."

Since both my husband and I worked late, we hadn&#39;t made any plans to go out for a Valentines dinner.  I had a craving for Asian and Sushi, so we drove around Wheaton, trying to find a spot we could get into on the busy night.  We finally came upon Wok n Fire and decided to give it a try.  Since it was a busy night, they didn&#39;t have any tables available in the main dining room, but said we could sit anywhere we wanted on the bar side.  It was almost 9 pm and Happy Hour was starting with 1/2 price appetizers and Martini specials.  We looked over the menu and were immediately enticed by the large menu.  We started with the Maki Roll Sampler.  It was delicious.  Our favorite was the Spicy Tuna Maki Roll.  For dinner I ordered the Crispy Crunchy Roll.  So delicious!  My husband ordered the Cantonese Orange Peel with Chicken and he loved it.  For dessert we shared the Sesame Banana Fritters and Chocolate Martinis.  Amazing!  We went back last night with my husband&#39;s parents for his birthday and it was delicious again.  Although a little pricey, I highly recommend Wok n Fire.  Great atmosphere, good service, and delicious food.

Update...we have been back twice now since our original Feb 2014 visit.  The 2nd time was still good and then we went back in April 2015...it was not very good.  The dining areas are looking in need of some refreshing and repair (tears in the upholstery) and the sushi was good, but wok dishes we ordered were just okay.  I am revising my 5 star review to a 4.

They were very hospitable and definitely strive to make sure their guest is happy. For example, I told them to order whatever their most popular roll was, which was the Saint Charles roll, turns out there was absolutely no raw fish in it. I told them I was not a fan, so the waiter brought me the salmon sushi roll and voided the first one, without me asking :) and it was definitely delicious! My sister had the Shanghai noodles (which she devoured) and my dad had cashew wok tossed dish.

I&#39;ll start with the crab ragoons: They are delicious! One of the best I&#39;ve had. The downside(s): They are tiny and very expensive. Your average take-out place will give you the same amount of ragoons (or even more), but larger and cheaper. Also, the dipping sauce for the crab ragoons is basically just Mae Ploy (sweet chili sauce). It comes in a bottle and you can buy this at any international food store. If you want to save money, this is not a good choice.

Now, I&#39;m gonna warn you before your read ahead: some items on the menu are listed at a certain price, but they are not the same price when you get the check. I pointed this out to a server once, and he seemed to get annoyed with me, as though I discovered his evil plan. Honestly, I&#39;m not even sure if it was a typing mistake or not (no one is perfect, right?), but the attitude he had was extremely rude and unnecessary.

On to the entree dishes. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re very special. They&#39;re good, but they sort of miss the authentic home-made flavor that I absolutely love in Asian cuisine. I&#39;ve had the Cantonese Orange Peel, Governers, Chap Chae, and Lar Nar. They&#39;re extremely sweet (to the point to where they messed up my blood sugar), but not particularly bad; they&#39;re just not the best place in the Wheaton area. They also charge more than its worth. $13 for just tofu, $14 for chicken (and you can imagine how much steak, shrimp, and scallops cost at this rate). I think the tastiest thing I have ordered there (aside from the crab ragoons) is the Chap Chae (which does not even have the most authentic Korean flavor). When I think of Asian cuisine, I think of authentic-tasting food with a warm home-made aroma. Here I get sweet and modern. Again, the food is not bad, but not the most authentic, and definitely not the best (especially not for the price).

I&#39;ve had the sushi. It&#39;s alright. That&#39;s pretty much all I have to say about it. I&#39;ve had much better sushi, but I&#39;ve had worse as well.

The ambiance is modern and &#34;trendy&#34;. Actually, it reminds me of the fire nation from Avatar: The Last Airbender. It&#39;s dark, the walls are a dark grey (almost black) color, the lighting is mostly reddish, except for the lights that change color. The decor sets the vibe that this is a place for people to drink, or for people who act like they&#39;re the coolest thing ever for eating sushi with chopsticks (which isn&#39;t always actually authentic). It doesn&#39;t have the best atmosphere for eating, unless you go there in the daytime. Also, the music is a bit too loud. Think of Chili&#39;s on a Saturday night. It&#39;s loud and I swear they even played Nickelback. They play mostly pop music, which is also annoying. I want to enjoy my meal and then there&#39;s Chad Kroeger telling me what a photograph is. It would be nice if they could at least play more neutral music at a lower volume.

This is not a very family-friendly restaurant. It&#39;s dark, the bathrooms are actually a bit of a walk away from the dining area, and it has a very bar/sushi lounge type of vibe (that seems quite strange for Wheaton. It is also not a very relaxing environment, unless you like nightclubs, then I guess this is right up your alley (except there is no awful dancing nor sweaty people).

The service is good, though I didn&#39;t like that one rude server I mentioned earlier. Sometimes they are understaffed for such a huge restaurant. Having to wait while there are unreserved tables is a little annoying, but at least the servers did not come to work sick (which matters more than waiting 5 minutes)."

I ordered the St Charles Roll as well as a lychee pear martini. The drink was good and the roll was excellent! The roll was a large portion that left me feeling full by the end of the meal. My husband ordered a stir-fry dish and he had to keep swatting my fork away from his plate; it was that good!. I like that they offer the option of either white rice or brown rice with the entrees.

The service was attentive on both visits, although we visited when the restaurant was quite empty. We can&#39;t wait for our next visit!"

However, the last three evening dinners we ate there fell short. Two of the times the miso soup arrived at just over room temperature. Bleah. Two times the main course was very late and the waiter apologized and said &#34;the kitchen is really backed up.&#34; And this last time, we order a large Pho soup, and there were TWO TEASPOONS in the bottom of the soup bowl, under the vegetables!

The only reason we would come back several times was because we had a Groupon.  I will never be back!!!! Or any of my friends that have come with me!!!!

My last visit we had hamachi carpaccio,  salmon carpaccio, Mexican roll, tiger roll and the seaweed salad. Both carpaccio dishes had ok quality pieces mixed with some pieces of fish that were fishy tasting, not fresh. The salmon carpaccio sauce wasn&#39;t mixed well enough and huge clumps of mayo. The Mexican roll was 5 pieces for $13 with about 1/2 ounce of tuna throughout the whole roll. Really. It was more like a rice roll. And $7 for a small seaweed salad is ridiculous. The cooked dishes are super small portions. When I eat out I don&#39;t want the feeling that I need to order another whole entry to feel full. I eat like that at home! Barely any meat in the Pad Thai or any of the noodle dishes we had ordered in the past. 

Food - poor. Ambience - cool and hip. Service - poor (every time we went, as soon as you receive your food they forget about you)

There are way better quality sushi places worth the drive!!"

We were seated at a table significantly too small for our party size (9) and left alone without menus or a drink order for a solid 20 minutes before our waitress greeted us. We watched an adjacent table have two different servers visit them 4 times before we were visited once. Aside from our food being mediocre and cold (yes, I know sushi is cold but many of our plates should have been hot) the entire atmosphere seemed to be lacking. 

Our water glasses stood empty our entire meal, our waitress tool our orders (finally) with disdain, and when the check finally came it already includes a 20% gratuity for our completely ignorant and incompetent server. 

Had this been any other night I would ignore the entire dinner, but I specifically made the reservation for my sisters 30th birthday and made that clear to them that it was a special occasion. Needless to say after many previous visits none in our party will be returning."

We didn&#39;t have any sushi but I&#39;d definitely eat it here and not shy away. I&#39;m from the west just blocks from the Pacific, so I&#39;m a bit of a skeptic with raw fish in the middle of the country... but this place seemed to use high quality seafood from what I observed.

They have fresh ginger ale and it&#39;s delicious! They use fresh ginger to make it. Definitely worth a try.

We had vegetable eggrolls to start and they were excellent with a sweet rice vinegar dipping sauce. I liked it a lot better than the traditional sweet and sour sauces that accompany most eggrolls.

My husband had the Kung Pao chicken with brown rice and I had a Spicy Schezwan with whole wheat noodles and veggies. We both enjoyed our meals but did not feel they were amazing. I would order something different next time. My plate was sweeter with a thicker sauce I didn&#39;t enjoy so much. I prefer a spicier dish but found it to be sweeter than expected with a &#34;spicy&#34; indicator on the menu. I&#39;d stick with our favorite, Pei Wei for the dishes at a fraction of the price. The presentation of every meal we saw was fantastic.

The ambiance was fantastic. It&#39;s located just south of the train tracks in Wheaton and the interior is upscale, classy, and inviting. 

Overall we enjoyed the visit and look forward to trying their sushi next time we visit and possibly some different entrees. They also have an extensive, creative cocktail list and a large, separate bar-- it&#39;s in an entirely different room which makes it even more attractive as the bar was considerably louder. You can order full menu in the bar as well and it&#39;s quite spacious!

Sign up for emails and get a $10 off $25 for your next meal (if used within 14 days!). Not bad!!"

Our server (both times) was Katie and she was super helpful in suggesting dishes/ variations and in checking with the kitchen and bar to answer any requests. We are vegetarian and we were stuffed by the time we left - lots of great options.  Asked for an idea for a drink by just telling her what I like in general and she brought out a drink that was awesome. Great combo by the bar of ginger and rum.  Reasonably priced - maki rolls/ entree/ dessert/ drinks  for under 50$.  The decor and atmosphere are great as well. Beautiful restaurant. Thanks for a great evening celebrating our anniversary!

I wouldn&#39;t mention the pork being dry if it were a wok&#39;ed dish for 7-12$.  A special commanding 18$ on a menu should be executed well each time.  

All in all, I liked the decor and the service was indeed friendly.  Their Japanese draft beer was a huge portion and cut the sodium quite a bit.  Our kids loved the dragon and the sushi bar light/art installation.

The sushi offerings are all very, very strange.  it&#39;s difficult to describe, but the combinations of flavors and ingredients are just plain WEIRD.

The Schezuan chicken dish was SO SPICY I could not eat it.  And I love spicy pan-Asian cuisine.  But this dish was unbearably spicy. Also, the chicken and veggies tasted OLD.

It&#39;s nice to see that DT Wheaton is gaining new restaurants, but I&#39;m not too sure what Wok n&#39; Fire brings to the table. Our food was typical chain-restaurant Chinese..seaseme chicken, orange chicken, white rice, and an order of edamame.

Atmosphere: I hate to be too critical, but I don&#39;t think the &#39;scene&#39; really fits with conservative downtown Wheaton. I&#39;m all for elaborate decor, but I think this place was a little overdone. 

Service: Our service was nothing special - first, we walk in and are half-ass greeted by a young hostess. Then, were seated at our table only to receive another half-ass greeting by our server. He was very forgetful, and we had to ask for our drinks a couple of times. 

Maybe he was inexperienced- but my assumption, by the persona he projected, was that he&#39;d been smokin&#39; a little somethin&#39; prior to his shift.."

Their service was ok, nothing spectacular, and it wasn&#39;t necessarily bad.

Their sushi is literally JUST A-OK. Absolutely nothing special about it. It&#39;s a chain and the name makes you think Chinese food, but they add sushi in their just because that&#39;s where the money&#39;s at. 

Their sushi was actually better than what I had expected. The nigiri pieces were of decent size and the cut wasn&#39;t super thin like most ridiculous places. They have a lot of random crazy rolls like any other place, but they definitely did have their basics down. Unfortunately they don&#39;t carry uni, but I guess that&#39;s expected out of a place like this.

Their best dish was their side dish, the stir fry spinach with garlic. That was mouth watering good! Something I would expect at a 5 star steak house."

Hostesses - not so much.  We called ahead on a Friday night, and when we got there the girl told us we were next in line.  After about 8 or so tables left, and 45 minutes later - we were finally seated.  Not cool.

So - on to the food.  We ordered the crab hand rolls as an appetizer.  These were awesome, but pretty small.  The Asian slaw that accompanies them is equally awesome.  I ordered the sesame chicken for my entree.  It was very good!  It could have used just a tad more sauce, but the chicken was nice and crispy, just like me like!  My partner had the salmon salad.  She said it was excellent and had big chunks of fresh mango.  They were also quite generous with the salmon.  It was fresh, and very tasty.  We then ordered the crispy crunchy maki roll.  Ick!  Skip this one.  The quality was good, but the texture was mushy.  They use Panko bread crumbs around the outside, and the inside is very creamy.  Have you ever had homemade peanut butter balls?  They are terrific, but that&#39;s what the texture of these reminded me of. We told the waiter we weren&#39;t crazy about them.  He apologized but didn&#39;t seem to care much, probably because we used a Groupon.

Anyway, this is a good place overall.  I would definitely return, especially for the atmosphere.  I am dying to try their Ginger Ale and vodka as well as their desserts!"

GREAT decor and music which combined for a nice vibe.  Sushi was very good especially the Godzilla roll.  Could have passed on the Jalapeno Popper roll- it was on special but should be killed off the menu - rather tasteless.

Took awhile to get our food and waitress forgot my miso soup but all in all a very good time.

Could have been that it was a long week and the couple of large Asahi beers hit the spot but I think this is a good place and I will definitely be back.  Need a little hip in the burbs and this place delivered on that and the sushi - with the exception of the Jalapeno Roll - KILL IT!"

You walk in, are greeted, your name is remembered, even the next time you come in she still knows your name (I don&#39;t know how, I wish I had this superpower because it makes people smile), and the food is filling for right after a workout. I already ordered by the time I saw their seasonal protein smoothie advertisement: pumpkin (I will never stop loving you - until the last piece of pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving reaches my stomach), but I&#39;ll have to give that a try next time I come in. They also do meal plans if you want healthy, protein packed food delivered to your home, and pickup if you&#39;re on the way back from a workout and your muscles don&#39;t want to wait to repair."

Time of my visit: Early dinner

This was my first time at Muscle Maker Grill...  I should note, I did not realize that it was a chain until after I started writing this review.  However, I will make an exception, because of the uniqueness of the chain (it&#39;s mostly located on the east coast NY/NJ area).

Off to the experience, I paced my order for pickup.  It was easy to place it, however, we wanted Warrior Nachos, but sadly they were out of chips/nachos.  I ordered Premier Burger and my girlfriend ordered Penne Romano.  When I arrived the order was ready.  I liked that!

I was a bit surprised by the portions, I guess being too long in this country, I got used to large portions.  The portion was probably right size.  My total was $17 and change, which was a bit pricey, even for this area.

Off to our food.  I could not speak to my girlfriend&#39;s food as she only let me try a little bit, but I would say, I was a bit disappointed...  The side I chose was cucumber salad.  The salad was decent, it was well seasoned.  The burger was interesting...  It seemed that the topics and the cheese over powered the taste of the meat.  The bun was good.

I would give this place a C-.  For the price I was expecting more value for the price.  Service was very good!  I would like to come back and try Warrior Nachos."

I was excited when I found this place offering tons of high protein/low carb options, plus nutrition information that&#39;s posted online. I ended up being pretty disappointed with my meal... I ordered the turkey taco salad, no cheese, and sour cream on the side. The turkey was broken up so fine it was almost like a meat sauce on top of lettuce, and it was lukewarm. The salsa that came on it was like jar salsa. It tasted like there was a lot of sodium in it too (and verified by their online nutrition facts). It was far from wow-ing me, that&#39;s for sure. There are healthier, more flavorful ways to punch up ground turkey to make it fantastic, and sadly, I was wishing for my own cooking as I ate this. I was only able to eat half, and the rest will be in the trash shortly. My guy got their chicken entree dinner- a grilled chicken breast, potato and steamed broccoli. Everything came out piping hot, but we never saw a piece of chicken go on their grill. He said even though the potato was steaming the entire time, it didn&#39;t taste hot, which was strange. He suspected some microwave action in play.

The only saving grace was the staff who made sure we had a clean table to sit at, fresh cups for water, and checked on us once while eating. This place has potential, but we were far from impressed and won&#39;t be back."

I stopped in to grab something light and ended up getting a cheeseburger salad and a chocolate 16 ounce protein shake. Overall, I love the concept since I eat basically a modified paleo. They have a lot of healthy choices for most diets your on. Looking at the menu I didn&#39;t see too many organic options or gluten free however I understand a lot of the foods are inherently gluten free. Great concept, okay price point, pretty good flavor profile."

Since I work in Wheaton, I thought this might be a good place to grab a healthy lunch from.  Yes, I was right.  My first visit here was after a boxing class at the gym, I just wanted a protein shake...they have em! They taste great and are of decent size for the cost, and most importantly, convenient.  
The night I stopped in to pick up a shake, the woman asked me if I wanted food to go along with it, and I said no, because that was big enough for a meal, plus I watch my carb intake.  She pointed out their low carb options which brought me back here last week for lunch. I called ahead for the &#34;Texas&#34; one of their low carb solutions.  It was just perfect (and filling) for lunch.  It was still hot when I brought it back from work, plus the container is great for food prepping at home.  

This place is also a heaven sent as I&#39;m currently participating in a weight loss challenge at my gym.  I will continue to stop in at this place.  All of their nutrition information is posted online... all healthy stuff!!!!

This place caters, they deliver, they have take out and have meal plans...how cool is that?!?!  They need to open more of these, because every suburb should have one!"

You see, I&#39;ve always carried around a bit of extra weight since late childhood, but I have taken steps to combat that, to get rid of bad eating habits, and to stay physically active. And so Muscle Maker Grill helps make Review 200, and it helps me in my quest for 200, because they offer well-portioned and well-PROportioned meals. You want high protein/low-carb? Balanced lean protein, veggie, and starch? Veggie options? It&#39;s all there. You can tell certain food items come pre-cooked, or pre-prepared in some fashion. But the price is right, and at the end of the day, someone else is doing all the food prep for you! Most meals can be split into two sensibly sized portions. Eat half now, save the rest for later.

If you&#39;re reeeeeeally not into the whole cooking/meal prep thing, they also offer meal plans that run about $7 per meal, with no weekly commitment whatsoever. I also get a 10% discount thanks to my association with the Cardinal Fitness in Glen Ellyn. With mostly healthy, and mostly guilt-free options, there&#39;s a little room to feel like you&#39;re cheating, but also plenty to make sure you stay true to your nutritional goals. The quest for 200 (and beyond) continues!"

They have a nice selection that is healthier than 95% of the other offerings around town.  I had a chicken breast that was served over steamed broccoli, what a treat instead of fries.  Lots of different choices, good food, hot, cooked fresh. 
On the flip side, I have had the chicken breast sandwich and it was pretty small, about the same size bun as a Mcdonalds regular burger, and the smallest chicken breast I have seen. I think it was $9, and that came with a side. Was a little underwhelmed.
I had the godfather last time, which the menu lists as Griled chicken and Portabella mushrooms. Since I love the earthy taste of portabellas, I tried it.  Well, the vast majority of mushrooms on my dish were regular button mushrooms.  The person at the counter said they mix up both kinds.  So why doesn&#39;t it say Portabella and Button mushrooms?  If I saw an offering that said &#34;Kobe beef burger&#34;, I would expect 100% Kobe beef, not a mixture of 90% ground chuck, and 10% Kobe, right? I felt like I was a little mislead, and that makes me wonder what else is &#34;mixed&#34; on the menu."

There food is simple, portioned and good. I am excited to try the other four meals I have in the fridge. You don&#39;t have to do the meal plans but it does save you time and money.

We&#39;ve been talking about going for months and we finally found ourselves nearby so we decided to go for a late lunch. Upon entering, there was a weird, bad grill smell- strike 1. The place was completely empty- strike 2. We ordered the Texas Chicken Nuggets, Rocky Balboa Wrap, and Arizona. Our food came out 2 minutes after we ordered it- strike 3!!!! I thought it was going to be great that it was empty, they&#39;d have plenty of time to cook our food, but no....they clearly took pre-cooked food and microwaved it. Every part of me did NOT want to eat this chicken and turkey bacon... And alas, I had an excuse not to- there was a hair or fuzz in it. My boyfriend said the Texas Chicken Nuggets tasted like &#34;canned chicken&#34;.

My friends and I really, really liked this place.  The food tasted great, which I wasn&#39;t expecting because I thought it was going to be bland health food. I was totally wrong!  This place is great!  

What I learned is that most of their food is made fresh, not frozen.  That&#39;s one of the things that makes it such a healthy option.  

First thing I noticed is our food arrived to our table steaming hot!  Sweet!  I ordered the El Mexicana from their entree menu.  It had seasoned chicken, black beans, rice, bell peppers, cheese, and salsa.  Mmmm!  It was more than I could eat.  I took some home.  They have these really cute take-home containers that are microwavable, dishwasher safe, and reusable!  I&#39;m totally saving this for future uses.  

One of my friends ordered the Rocky Balboa wrap.  The Rocky Balboa had a blend of chicken and meatballs with mozzarella cheese and a tasty sauce.  I was lucky to get a taste before my friend ate it all.  After one taste, I knew why he ate it so fast.  It was SO good!!  I think I&#39;ll order that next time.  The wrap came with a side dish.  My friend chose the spicy chunks of potato and loved them too!  

My other friend ordered the grass-fed beef burger and had a side of the greenest, brightest, most flavorful broccoli she had ever seen or tasted.  I don&#39;t know what their secret is, but this was beautiful broccoli!  The burger was incredible, so tender and juicy!

We will DEFINITELY be back!  Looking at their menu, Muscle Maker Grill delivers and also offers meal plans. That&#39;s cool.   There are lots of options to explore at this place.  They will certainly see us again."

A friend had a chicken and broccoli dish, the broccoli was very green and fresh and had a wonderful balsamic vinegar sauce. 
The steak wrap had a great deal of steak and the side of spicy potatoes hit the spot for another friend.

I&#39;m really surprised at all of the positive reviews on here, because my experience was anything but. The service is absolutely deplorable. I left a $1 tip on a $31 check. The food is ok but nothing spectacular. The kitchen, which is right in front in plain sight looks dirty and unkept. I didn&#39;t see either one of the people cooking (who I assumed are also the owners) using gloves or hairnets. They brought no water. They brought no silverware. Table was not clean and had a thin layer of grease on it. The two owners seemed like they had no idea how to run a restaurant and were constantly bickering with each other. 

What a terrible experience. I won&#39;t be back ever again. Don&#39;t waste your time."

But I&#39;ve never gone anywhere to eat just because it looks pretty. I kind of dig suspect looking places. It&#39;s dim inside. Wood paneling on the walls. The TVs are either playing whatever Comcast music channel plays Deep Purple or some movie on TNT. 

The menu is simple. I always get the Dan Dan Noodles and add chicken or shrimp. It&#39;s spicy but flavorful. The pot stickers are delicious. This is not usual Chinese food (think: egg rolls and egg foo young type). Every dish is made after you order, noodles are handmade, food is flavorful. Portions are great- if I&#39;m not wearing fat pants I have left overs.

Ask what fruit they have on hand for a freshly made, delicious smoothie. They have Coke in glass bottles.There&#39;s also a sizable craft beer menu and video poker type machines in there.

The service/mood is hit or miss. It&#39;s not uncommon to hear bickering behind the counter. It&#39;s seems like they&#39;ve toned it down although it&#39;s never really bothered me. The husband and wife are very nice and helpful. If they get busy sometimes the times between table visits can get a little long. I&#39;ve tried the pick up option and had delivery. Not enough regular staff to make those dependable options but it&#39;s nice to know they exist. I prefer my food there anyway- almost like it tastes better. No clue why. But the food is good and the service/mood isn&#39;t enough to turn me off. My dad who is notoriously picky and will hold a grudge when it comes to bad service isn&#39;t bothered enough to not enjoy coming here.

My 15 month old loves this place. Shouldn&#39;t be surprising since I craved them a lot through my pregnancy and he&#39;s come here since he was an infant. He grabs pieces of veggies out of his veggie fried rice and eats them on his own. I can&#39;t feed him fast enough because he&#39;s sticking his hand into the plate to grab a handful (he doesn&#39;t do this anywhere else). He loves the pot stickers. They don&#39;t have sippy cups but if your kid can manage a regular straw or cup you&#39;ll be fine.

A little pricey but for fresh and hand made food it is worth it.

I love this place- don&#39;t ever change."

I asked specifically if we could order for delivery even though he was out, but she insisted we try to call back later because she didn&#39;t know when he would be back.

First off, customer service is a 1 star. Person on the phone could really care less as well as the lady charging your order. No smile, don&#39;t expect friendliness. Which I don&#39;t even care for as long as the food is GOOD. 

Nope, mediocre food. You would think a place that only sells noodles and dumplings would specialize in those two things. But the taste of everything can be described as WAY salty and greasy. I don&#39;t care if they cook with MSG or not but the saltiness is out of control. The home cooked noodles are much better than the gummy Lo Mein. Frozen small shrimp for the sea food order, their &#34;amazing&#34; dumplings taste average and are super hard/ old on the edges (the sauce that comes with it is knock your knees out salty). Over all average. 

 Also, don&#39;t expect utensils, napkins, soy sauce, chili flakes or ANYTHING on your to-go order. I was super excited to order from this place being 4 stars and all but honestly, don&#39;t see myself coming back. Gonna stick with my original place, China Cook."

I felt like the dumplings and dipping sauce were on the bland side and didn&#39;t have much character. This is coming from a person who has eaten dumplings of all kinds all of her life. The noodles, however, were very flavorful. It&#39;s unique in the sense that their broth is made with fermented black beans  and lots of garlic which was good but it was just not for me.

I bookmarked Hot Pan because of a mention on the Smokin&#39; Chokin&#39; Chowing with the King blog (https://www.blogger.com/profile/05368411195212070782).  This is a hole in the wall in a strip center, and as long as that&#39;s what you&#39;re expecting - and great noodles and dumplings - you&#39;ll be good.  One surprise I wasn&#39;t expecting - they have an excellent bottled craft beer selection for such a small restaurant.  To the food....

We ordered a mix of dumplings/potstickers (2 each of beef, pork, chicken and shrimp), seafood combo handmade noodles and seafood combo fried noodles (lo-mein, essentially) and jasmine iced tea.  The iced tea was great.  The dumplings were very good and the shrimp ones were excellent, but the sauce they&#39;re served with?  It was exceptional.  I wish I could buy it to take home.  The noodles were extremely good.  The handmade noodles themselves were better than the not-handmade pan-fried ones, but the pan-fried dish had more intense flavor.  Even so, the handmade noodles were my favorite, especially with some leftover dumpling sauce added.  I wish this place were near where I live, because it would be a regular stop for certain.  It was a very nice experience."

The interior of this place is cramped:  about four or five booths with a small aisle separating the booths from the bar/take-out counter.  Then there are a few video poker machines jammed into the corner.  It&#39;s dark in here, as if there&#39;s really something seedy and suspicious going on.  Despite the claustrophobic interior, the kitchen is visible to diners and everything looked cluttered, but clean.  

Their menu is limited:  noodle dishes, rice, dumplings/potstickers, and smoothies only.  The man who took my order was friendly, but the woman who appeared to do most of the cooking had an expression on her face as if she were being held hostage.  And whenever he asked her a question, she ignored him.  It&#39;s a weird dynamic here.

There is nowhere to wait for your order, so I recommend calling it in.  I just waited in my car for 10 minutes until my food was ready.

Anyway, I ordered a few things:

Dan Dan Noodles with chicken
Fried Noodles with shrimp
Pork Potstickers
2 smoothies (not tapioca) 
Total cost = $37

We are used to ordering from other Chinese places in our neighborhood, and we get a lot more food for a few bucks less.  We did get a lot of food, but $37 for Chinese (okay, $30 without the smoothies) is a little overpriced.

However, the food was very good.  I loved the Dan Dan Noodles - a little bit oily, but very spicy.  The potstickers were much better than Katy&#39;s, somewhat crisp on the outside and very well seasoned pork on the inside.  

The smoothies don&#39;t have tapioca, but they are damn good.  We had a mango pineapple, and a blueberry raspberry, and both were almost a meal in themselves.  They&#39;re huge (only one size) and made with real fruit and yogurt.  No ice chunks or random juice here.

For Chinese food, I feel it&#39;s a bit overpriced.  For something a little different than your typical General Tso-such-and-such, it&#39;s worth making your way here.  It&#39;s not a 3-star, and it&#39;s not 4-stars.  It&#39;s somewhere in-between."

I&#39;ve driven past hundreds of time and it&#39;s outward appearance is more like a hole in the wall bar than a five star restaurant.  If it hadn&#39;t been for its high marks on Yelp I would&#39;ve never even given it a first try.  

Soooo I did give it a try, for lunch, and I brought some business associates along for the experiment.  

First impression, empty, hodge podge restaurant with nine inch nails on the cable music channel on the TV directly above three video poker machines.  Odd smell that I can&#39;t quite identify but will return to later.  Middle aged Asian lady tells us to sit anywhere than disappears.  One page laminated menu that is so sticky that I do not touch it again after the realization of how filthy it is.  

The lady finally returns to take our order after 5 minutes and she recommends the dumplings and the fried noodles.  We order what she recommends and she proceeds into the kitchen to prepare our meal.

What we ordered:
Iced tea:  Aka brown water in a dirty pitcher.  F-
Beef dumplings: potstickers. Taste good but SUPER Greasy! B

Fried noodles with beef: very little beef but ample soy sauce and SUPER Greasy! C-

So that smell I couldn&#39;t identify.... Oil, lots and lots of oil.  :(

So, given the high marks others have given this place I will try it one more time.  But I don&#39;t hold out much hope.  

For those that gave five stars.... You need to get out more!"

So the lady starts to SHOUT at him like he was a 5 year old! He just wanted to correct it so everything was correct &amp; then she still berates him in front of patrons! Then she thinks she is in the right and makes a mockery of him to another patron! I was so uncomfortable and felt horrible for the man!

I stopped in last Friday night for dinner with my fiance. It maybe a small place but bring a big appetite. Everything there is made from skratch. Handmade dumplings and noodles made everyday. Who else does this? Hot Pan does! Their food is so good it&#39;s like Chinese comfort food. I will definitely be a regular at this establishment. The owners are friendly and the prices are affordable.

Initially, I was very excited about this type of restaurant in the area, but the food was a let down. Not much flavor at all, just lots of oil and very salty. We gave it a try twice, but both times were the same.  Also, I could not get past the uncleanliness of the place. Everything I touched was sticky. All of their condiment bottles on the tables had dried stuff dripping down them. The table tops were even sticky.  This place needs improving."

It has a dingy outward appearance, and whoever decorated the interior is very confused on what they were decorating. You can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re in a bar, 1-star casino, arcade, or dive.

The owner isn&#39;t the friendliest of hosts, but he gets the job done in a timely manner. The flavoring of the food is mediocre; a lot of oils and soy sauces. If you order a meal that contains meat, be prepared to have it packed with much more vegetables than meat. 

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m glad that Joliet has an oriental place for cuisine other than your typical Chinese-American take out, but after eating at many authentic oriental restaurants and take-outs around Chicagoland, I&#39;m just not impressed.

Advice: 
1) Redecorate
2) Be friendlier to your customers ( i know foreign restaurant owners that barely speak english that know how to great customers)
3) Use less oils and sauces in the food, and incorporate more authentic spices to bring out the natural flavors of the meats and veggies
4) The texture of your noodles are on point! I just wish you had more variety in your menu that used different types of noodles"

I need to order from here at least once a week. The dumplings, both fried and boiled, are amazing! The dumpling sauce is, by far the best I ever had. The spice level in the Dan Dan noodles always satisfies my spicy palate. I also order the handmade noodles with chicken, or beef, and vegetables YUM. I&#39;m drooling right now just thinking about it! I like to go in every once and awhile too because their beer selection is great. I love that it&#39;s not all shiny and new, I come here for the food not the surroundings.

I knew it had to be better than mall food.  Almost anything is (except for Cinnabons and Mrs. Fields Cookies).

It was late afternoon, I&#39;m guessing between the lunch rush and the dinner rush, because this place was empty which was okay by me.  It looked like I was disturbing the manager/host who was trying to work on his laptop in the front, but he explained the menu nicely enough and suggested some items.  I went with the homemade beef noodles and some pork &#34;pot sticker&#34; dumplings along with a strawberry ale.  The noodles were great.  The dumplings were good, but (being asian and having had many, many dumplings in life thus far) were not as good as some of the home cooked ones I&#39;ve had.  Close.  Definitely worth another try.

But, the service.  *sigh*  Now admittedly, I was there between rushes, but I felt like I was in the dining room while &#34;Mom&#34; and &#34;Dad&#34; were fighting in the kitchen.  After my food arrived, &#34;mom&#34; and &#34;dad&#34; must have taken their conversation to the back, because I didn&#39;t see anyone for a while.  When the host returned, it wasn&#39;t a cordial &#34;how do you like the food?&#34;, but a more hostile &#34;need anything?&#34;  So, nope.  Don&#39;t need another ale.  Don&#39;t need another order to take home.  Just the check and I&#39;ll get out of your way.

I hope this place can work out whatever it is that is killing the mood, because I can easily see this place as being *the* go to noodle place.  Just like you&#39;d have your favorite hot dog/hamburger spot or your favorite pizza place, this would be the place for noodles or dumplings... if it were more inviting."

Yes, it&#39;s anonymous from the outside and dark on the inside.  I&#39;ve only ever seen two employees -- the husband and wife owners -- but the food is really good and like others have said, there&#39;s an impressively large craft beer menu that seems completely out-of-place in both the area and for the type of food being served (not that I&#39;m complaining).

The menu is pretty small but the good thing is that everything they make is really good.  I&#39;ve (twice) had the dan dan noodles and the dumplings.  The dumplings are probably the best I&#39;ve ever had.  It&#39;s not even on the same level as typical potstickers, no matter what fillings you get.  The noodles themselves (without sauce) have the perfect texture and you can tell they make them there.  The sauce is REALLY spicy, and this is coming from someone who really likes spice.  They weren&#39;t so bad that I couldn&#39;t eat it but I did have to take frequent breaks.  It&#39;s also a mess so don&#39;t eat this stuff in dress clothes.

Overall I like the place a lot and it&#39;s one of those cool small restaurants with a ton of character that every city should want."

I went here on a Saturday night at 7 with my wife.  The owner seemed like she could care less that we were there due to her being more concerned and occupied with the couple playing video poker. When we were finally able to attempt to place a drink order, the owner walked away before my wife could say she wanted some hot tea.  In that time, I decided we were not going to eat here.  I paid for my beer and we left.  Maybe I&#39;m being too critical...you can have the most amazing food in the world, but if you can&#39;t make your customers feel like you want them there then you don&#39;t deserve my money.  

What made this place for me the first time was the atmosphere. Laid back, good music, inviting...now, it was gone.  The difference? The first time I went here the owner wasn&#39;t there....

I don&#39;t think the excuse of &#34;having a bad night&#34; can apply here because my wife told me she was treated the same way by the owner when she picked up some take out a couple weeks ago. 

As we left, the guy that made our first trip so nice was sitting outside on the curb. Too bad...we won&#39;t roll the dice and go back just for the chance the owner won&#39;t be there. The food is good, but not good enough to make me go to a place where the owner doesn&#39;t seem to appreciate your business."

the outward appearance is... well... confusing. you can&#39;t see anything from the outside in (we initially thought they might be closed). it had a strong bar/takeout-only look to it. when we walked in we were surprised by the cozy interior. 

we were pleasantly greeted by a man who&#39;s name I can&#39;t remember. we chose I big U shaped booth and started scrolling through a massive book (which wasn&#39;t the menu but instead a beer list). 70 beers?! holy cow!! I loved the beers listed and was impressed. I also enjoyed the bottled soft drinks (we made sure to save our bottle caps). 

the beer list was in this extravagent leather-like book but the menu was a small take-out pamphlet. I would advice show casing your food along with your beers, especially if you work so hard to make delicious handmade noodles!

we ordered stirfry, fried rice, and dumplings. the man held conversation, took our orders, and proceeded to make our food himself in plain sight (which I loved, no secrets just good food). the food came quickly. 

Best Chinese food I&#39;ve had in a very very long time. the food was in short delicious and refreshing. instead of weighing you down and filling you up like most Chinese food restaurants, we felt energized and comfortable after eating so much!! 

hands down a new favorite of mine!! Excellent job, I can&#39;t wait to come back!!"

From the outside, it looks like a dive bar.... Tinted windows with neon signs.  On the inside there is a mix between booths, and one or two tables.  It is very small and has the feel of being in a friends basement.  There are two large TVs in which they had music videos playing.  Not exactly the type of music I would choose for a relaxing dinner, Nine Inch Nails, etc.  There is a long hallway with a series of little doors.  One was an office that was a cluttered mess.  It is right off of the kitchen and had no business with the door open.  There were two closets/pantries I believe, yet there were pineapples stored in an open box in the hallway.  The bathroom needed cleaning.  
We were seated in a booth with menus on the table.  The menus were all sticky! Both of them!  Our order was taken by Daisy, the cook.  She waited, bussed and cooked.  No hand washing was done!  
The food was good.  I don&#39;t have any complaints about the food minus the hand washing.  Daisy is a good cook and could do so much better than this place.  
There was a man sitting in the front of the restaurant when we arrived, the owner maybe?  He was on his laptop and would jump up every now and then to answer the phone or check on what Daisy was doing.  I have to point out again that he helps without take out orders but does not wash his hands.  
There are also two slot machines that seem completely out of place.  The place makes you feel like the owner wished he owned a bar but got stuck with a Chinese restaurant.  Very strange.
I would not return first because of the lack of proper hygiene and food sanitation, secondly because of the lack of customer service.  
Tip for the owner, greet your customers, ask them how their food was, thank them for coming and work in the office... Not at a table next to where your customers are trying to dine."

Homemade noodles and dumplings all with assorted meats and vegetables, either steamed or pan fried.  I had the fried noodle with pork and vegetables which was outstanding!

Found this place on Yelp. Ordered the Dan Dan Noodles and pork dumpling. The noodle is good. She definitely knows how to make noodle from scratch... Unfortunately not the flavoring. The dumpling doesnt have too much meat in it and somewhat greasy. Dipping sauce? Ummm.... Not my fave. Not impressed at all and wouldn&#39;t come back. Service was OK. I give 3 stars for the noodle only.

WHERE ELSE IN JOLIET ARE YOU GOING TO FIND A PLACE THAT MAKES AND SPECIALIZES IN FRESH HAND MADE NOODLES!!!!! 

Try: Anything noodle based, the dumplings. Basically anything on her limited, but delicious menu. 

I&#39;ve been frequenting Hot Pan since Daisy (Owner/Chef) since she opened. I should have Yelped sooner. Daisy takes so much pride in her food. I&#39;ve seen her out shopping for fresh ingredients, she is consistent about the flavor of her food. There are not that many restaurants in Joliet or the area for that matter that take that kind of pride in their food. 

Are there things that she could improve, yes. Get rid of the video machines, lighten up the atmosphere, and brighten up the room. But none of that has anything to do with her food. 

Look.. The food will be the best you&#39;ve eaten hands down. There are no other Chinese restaurants in the area that will ever give you this kind of quality food."

Large selection of different beers.  We had the shrimp pot stickers and the shrimp noodles and the spare ribs noodles.  Everything was cooked to order and it didn&#39;t take too long.

The stove is in direct sight of where you sit, and where you order, but has layers of grime on it.

Once in a while for the beautiful old greenhouse at Pilcher Park and once in a while for Vietnamese food at Hue Palace, but that&#39;s about it.  Now I have another reason.   I actually found out about this place on Yelp and it sounded interesting because they have homemade noodles.  So we came here so I could try the noodles.  I didn&#39;t realize that the owner, who cooks, is from Szechuan province or that they served Szechuan style hotpot and dan dan noodles and my favorite, Szechuan style cold noodles.  The hot pot is $16.99 for all you can eat and it was a really great meal.  You get a big pot of hot spicy broth and a tabletop heater and you cook your own meat, vegetables, and other stuff in it.  Since we made the long drive, I had to order some noodles too, so I had the dan dan noodles.  The noodles and spicy sauce were both incredible.  I didn&#39;t get to try the cold noodles but it sounds like they may be even better than the others.  I will definitely be making another trip for that reason alone.  Otherwise, this is kind of an unusual place in an unlikely location and not like any Chinese restaurant I&#39;ve gone to before, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, we enjoyed talking to the owners, and the food was delicious.

1st Time: food was tasty (Dan Dan Noodles) but we were not warned that the noodles would be EXTREMELY spicy, the owner said, &#34;they aren&#39;t that spicy,&#34; and don&#39;t get me wrong, I love spicy food... this heat was unbearable.

2nd time: My boyfriend got sick (he had the Dan Dan Noodles)

3rd time: (My first meal of the day) My boyfriend and I ordered the &#34;Hot Pot.&#34; I got soo sick (nausea, vomit, chills) I will not return; all that I once thought good of this place is now gone. I&#39;m cannot ever bring myself to eat there again.

Other things I observed: The service is quite terrible (your server is also the cook and a buser) and I never see anyone wash their hands between cooking and servicing other customers. Also, what I found awkward was that they do their business in the dining room...very weird. It&#39;s almost as if the owners treat the place as their home, only I&#39;m a paying customer, I prefer not to watch people conduct business on a laptop on a table cluttered with papers, and ask if I want a refill on my Jasmine tea while still sitting... This is one disorganized business and they aren&#39;t very polite. The three times I have been there, the place has been pretty empty, probably for the same reason I will not be going back."

A friend brought me because he was freaking out about how good it was, and I truly had no idea. My first time I ate Hot Pan, I was addicted. Truly. And now I have to limit myself to going or getting takeout only once a week. Every time I go, I order the Dan Dan noodles, because they&#39;re just completely amazing (if you like spicy, definitely order this one), but my boyfriend orders other things each time, and his are consistently fantastic, too. 

The people there are exceedingly friendly, the lighting is good, the beer list is great, and the high-backed booths make dinner feel like an intimate experience, which you wouldn&#39;t expect from most strip mall restaurants. I cannot recommend this place enough. In fact, I&#39;ve sent at least 8 friends there, and every one of them go almost as often as I do now.

This location however  leaves a lot to be desired in terms of food quality. I went here on a Sunday afternoon with a to-go order. I knew it would be busy, and I think they do a really good job keeping the lines moving.

However, when I got home I realized why they were able to achieve such speed. Our burgers tasted much different than usual. The patties had been microwaved, boiled, or pre-cooked somehow. Like they have a guy who just zaps tons of burger patties when they get busy and throw em on the bun. They definitely, 100%, were not flame grilled. Did they stop flame grilling burgers? Maybe I am just out of the loop.

Either way, it changes the whole taste of the burger. Used to be one of my favorites, now it is average at best. Not sure what is going on at this location, but the food quality is suffering."

Many ppl have been recommending this place for their Italian beef sandwich.
The inside is really nice, so much decor everywhere! A very retro style restaurant. 
We had ordered the Italian beef sandwich, Chicago dog, classic ceasar salad and the chocolate cake shake. 

The only good things were the Italian beef and the chocolate cake shake. Italian beef was an overall good sandwich and very tasty.  The chocolate cake shake is good - they literally blend the cake in ice cream!!! It tastes exactly like choco cake that you drink!
However, the ceasar salad and the hotdog were not that great. The salad was drenched in so much dressing I couldn&#39;t even eat it.  The hot dog was not impressive and not that tasty compared to other ones I&#39;ve eaten in San Antonio or elsewhere.

The self-serve cafeteria-style always results in quick service and fast food prep. I always get a chuckle of the funny quips the staff uses when they call your number. Entertaining.

On both visits, I ordered their burger: charbroiled 1/3 pound of juicy beef with mayo, lettuce, a tomato slice, sliced red onion, pickles, and ketchup on their freshly toasted old fashioned style bun. I really love the simplicity of their burger and yet being able to taste the freshness of the everything from the beef to the toppings. I tried my boyfriend&#39;s Italian Beef, the signature sandwich Portillo&#39;s prides itself on, and it too was warm, hot, and with the peppers, a perfect combination of meaty with a zing. 

I also had to order their fries--so delicious! On my first visit, I tried a strawberry milkshake as well and it was also super yummy. I&#39;m not sure you can go wrong with anything here. They also have their ordering system down pact. We arrived during the lunch crowd on a busy Friday afternoon, but the friendly staff takes your order in abbreviations on a paper bag before you reach the counter to speed up the process.

As my hunger level was rising, I have lost my capability to generate other alternatives.  

I had a little bit too much coffee this morning, so I decided to order a bowl of chili to for &#34;detoxification&#34; purposes.  Well, a bowl of chili wouldn&#39;t be enough, how about an order of Chicago style dog to tag along?  

I wish I had another stomach to scuff down an Italian beef sandwich with hot peppers.  My mind was willing but my flesh was so weak.  

That bowl of chili was quite alright, but hubby&#39;s tuna sandwich was delicious and well-crafted.  Portillo&#39;s offers many meatless options, so bring your vegetarian friends!  

I was trying to log onto their free wifi, yet it constantly flagged so 4G on my cell was the way to go.

I recommend the beefs hot and wet. Even though it&#39;s not the #1 best that I&#39;ve tried, it&#39;s a really great option. Their char-grilled burgers are also on point. And don&#39;t forget the chopped salad either..  you really can&#39;t go wrong at Portillos."

This location is the closest to my home.  I&#39;ve dined in and taken my food to go via drive thru.

Orders are always accurate here.  If the drive thru is backed up, they will have you pull over to a spot and will deliver your food on foot.

Today I was waiting on a cup of coffee. And waiting. And waiting. After almost ten minutes, I asked a man behind the counter if he could check on it for me. It took three people to finally figure out how to get me a cup of coffee. 

It was only after I made my way to the condiment station that I realized they don&#39;t stock the cream and sugar there, which resulted in another trip and another wait at the counter, trying to get someone&#39;s attention. Really ... isn&#39;t that something the server just asks, especially if they KNOW it&#39;s not offered in the self serve condiment area? 

Too much work for a simple cup of coffee, but well in line with the slightly out-of-control vibe of this place."

Who comes to Chicago without trying their food anyway? 

I got the italian beef with sweet peppers (I should have gotten hot peppers!!) and it was delicious. Definitely a favorite and I can see why everyone loves it. It&#39;s so simple yet so full of flavor. It goes really well with the cheese fries. I don&#39;t usually finish my fries, but this time around I did because they were soooo good. 

I also got a hot dog, which included mustard, relish, freshly chopped onions, sliced red ripe tomatoes, kosher pickles, and sport peppers that was piled onto a perfectly steamed poppy seed bun (yes I stole that from somewhere) with the recommendation of my bf. However, I&#39;m no fan of hot dogs and sadly, Portillo&#39;s hot dog tasted like a regular hot dog to me. I also got the chocolate cake shake and wasn&#39;t a fan either. It was like someone chewed up lil bits of cake and spit it back out into a milkshake. I didn&#39;t like the consistency of how it felt going down my throat...SORRY CHICAGO!! But I do LOVE your italian beef. 

We came here for dinner on a weekday night and although there wasn&#39;t a long line when we ordered, it did take a while for our food to be ready. No complaints though, with such a popular spot serving great food - it&#39;s bound to be packed. We were going to get chocolate cakes to take home, but the line grew longer and we were just like &#39;screw it...next time&#39;. I will be back for that cake!"

Oh screw it, fries with cheese on the side.

I LOVE portillos! I get it at least once a month. Even when I&#39;m not even hungry and I pass it on my way home, I will order a side of onion rings with cheese. Best fries hands down in suburb area, but on the other hand I have a huge bias towards crinkle fries. It is a perfect combination of slightly crispy but with just enough potato in the center. Why don&#39;t more chains have crinkle fries?! 

Personally, I think Nicky&#39;s has SLIGHTLY better hot dogs and Tom &amp; Eddies has SLIGHTLY better burgers, but I love the fact that you can&#39;t go wrong here- there is something on the menu that pleases everyone and for a great price! The salads are also delicious, especially the chopped salad or Caesar, which are my go-to. The food is hot and smells delicious, and forever a staple for the Chicago area. I get so excited when I get Portillos, that I can&#39;t even stop for a moment to take a picture.

This is the first time I&#39;ve seen a Portillo&#39;s where they have a separate counter area just for the salads.  So if all you are ordering is a salad, you can step up to that cash register and order and receive your salad there.  No need to get in the long line where everyone else is ordering their meals.  If you are ordering non salad items AND a salad, then you order at the regular counter and wait for your number to be called for the non-salad items.  And then through the magic of technology, the salad makers will receive your salad order and they will make it up and call your number at the salad counter.

The food we had was delicious, as it is at all of the Portillo&#39;s I have eaten at.  All of the employees were very friendly. This restaurant has a nice mix of booths and tables."

Service was great and super prompt.  I ordered a hot dog, burger, onion rings and a shake.  The dog didn&#39;t speak to me too much this time around.

The ones in Elmhurst, Downers Grove, basically all around the area are top notch. The food is always incredible. Bacon cheeseburgers, beef and cheddar croissants, chocolate cake shakes... The food is the best. And the drive thru experience at Portillo&#39;s is typically a marvel of fast food buying. Two lines, employees outside taking your order, checking your order, taking your money - in all types of weather - it&#39;s incredible.

Everywhere but this Portillo&#39;s.

Our order is seriously wrong every single time. Sometimes there&#39;s no cheese sauce, sometimes a whole sandwich is missing, sometimes an ingredient we didn&#39;t want on a salad is there in droves. And while some of the employees are incredibly awesome, some are so rude I want to scream. My favorite is when I ordered my husband&#39;s drink (he hates ice, so I always ask for no ice) and it came to me with ice. I handed it back to the guy and said &#34;oh actually I&#39;m really sorry but no ice in this one, please. And actually it was a large not a medium.&#34; He hands it back to the girl inside the window and says &#34;she ordered with no ice and you got the wrong size.&#34; The girl looks at him and says &#34;what does she WANT?&#34; And he replied (still trying to be polite as I&#39;m literally sitting 3 feet from her) &#34;she needs a large Coke, no ice.&#34; The girl responds, in the nastiest voice ever: &#34;well, I don&#39;t care, because she&#39;s NOT gonna get it.&#34; And proceeds to give me a large Coke, still with ice. I just left, to avoid reaching through my car to slap her. I called corporate later but because I didn&#39;t know her name, they blew me off. 

In short, I love Portillo&#39;s and will continue to eat there... Just never when I&#39;m in Naperville."

This is an OK place if you&#39;re in the neighborhood and want hot dogs, Italian beef sandwiches,and the like.

Note that this was a family business but was sold to a venture capital firm (Berkshire Properties) in 2014.  Mr. Portillo bought back the real estate and leases it to Berkshire.  Berkshire is in charge of all operations.

Lately, the portions (fries, noticeably) are smaller than before.  Service is still OK.  The salad ordering area has much less business than previously.  I&#39;ve gotten sick twice eating the salad with the cold chicken on top so I&#39;d skip that.  Prices have also increased substantially.

The parking lot can be be problematic as it&#39;s a bit too small during peak times."

This review is a mix of the food and the delivery service I tried tonight, Takeout Taxi. I&#39;ve been good about bringing my lunch to work all week, but tonight my inner fat kid was screaming for &#34;bad&#34; food.  Nevermind that I have a wedding dress to fit into... sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.

I placed an order for a hot dog with everything, an Italian beef dry with sweet peppers on the side, and a small order of fries. I&#39;m a tiny lil&#39; thing but it&#39;s amazing all of the food I can eat. I guess my metabolism hasn&#39;t given up on me yet. *knock on wood* Anywho- so I place my order online, and was given an estimated time of 75 minutes. It didn&#39;t take even close to that amount of time. No sooner than I clicked &#34;submit&#34;, my phone rang with a Takeout Taxi rep, who was confirming that I just placed my first order. She said delivery would be $1 cheaper; I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because it was my first order or my proximity to the location I ordered from. Nonetheless, a buck&#39;s a buck. I&#39;ll take it.

My food arrived 15 minutes before the promised time. The driver was super nice and friendly, despite turning into the wrong parking lot. He joked and said I have to promise to order more often so he doesn&#39;t get rusty. I assured him I would (I&#39;m so tired of grubhub - plus there&#39;s lots of great options). 

The fries were still a decent temperature, despite the delivery involved. The hot dog was made perfectly. I was disappointed that there wasn&#39;t any celery salt, but I don&#39;t remember Portillo&#39;s ever using it. Otherwise, it was a good hot dog. The beef was dry as I had ordered it. I&#39;m not a fan of dipped or juicy beef; by the time you try to eat it, it&#39;s falling apart everywhere. And in my OCD world, that&#39;s no bueno my friends. The side of sweet peppers was abundant; it was certainly more than I needed. Overall, I was a happy camper. 

While I don&#39;t eat Portillo&#39;s often, I&#39;ve never had a bad experience with them. The only downfall is no matter what time you visit, it&#39;s always busy. I guess that&#39;s a good thing from a business standpoint. But to the consumer, it can be quite aggrivating."

The food is fantastic.  You can&#39;t go wrong with an Italian beef (with hot peppers, of course), the beef &amp; cheddar croissant, hot dogs, cheese fries, etc.

Like most locations, this Portillo&#39;s is a madhouse during lunch time.  I made the mistake of coming here around 12-12:30 during the week.  Parking wasn&#39;t too bad, aside from the crazies trying to park and get out of the lot.  There were spots available, but nobody drives through this lot with any concern for others&#39; safety.

Once inside, it&#39;s packed again.  It doesn&#39;t take too long for orders though, and the employees working behind the counter are fast, accurate, and friendly.

I&#39;ve gotten in and out with more ease during the crazy lunch hour at other locations.  It could just be me, but the inside of this place seems significantly smaller than others."

I usually visit about once a month, and I&#39;ve never felt compelled to write a review - until today. I will start off by saying that the food is always fantastic. Never had a problem with the food. Then again, I usually stick to the Chicago basics when I order (hot dogs, beef sandwich, occasionally a chopped salad) so I really can&#39;t say much about the other items on the menu. So I give them 5 stars on the food - that&#39;s a given. However, the service there is less than desirable. Today was national hot dog day, and so I figured that there would be a bit of a wait. So I actually delayed my lunch hour until 115pm, hoping that some of the lunch crowd would be gone by the time I got there. I walked in, and there were 3 lines for each cashier. Each line was abot 4 or 5 deep - no big deal. A guy came around and took my order while I waited in line (which is SOP for Portillo&#39;s), I went up to the cashier and paid. My reciept was stamped 116pm. I ordered 2 hotdogs and a small fry to go. Simple order, shouldn&#39;t have taken long. I waited and waited. Watched as other people got their food, many of which were behind me in line. Asked the girl at the window how much longer, she said another minute. Then 5 minutes went by. Finally, my food comes across the window. The time: 128pm. Unacceptable. There is no reason why my simple order whould have taken so long. No apology from the girl at the window either. I gotta say, for as much as I love Portillo&#39;s, not sure if I&#39;ll be back to this location. 5 stars for food, 1 star for service = 3 stars overall."

This place almost makes the cut though. A pretty famous local chain that is definitely worth going to for Chicago favorites that are difficult to find elsewhere. Things like the Italian beef and Chicago hot dog. The latter, particularly the jumbo dog, is just flat out better than other hot dogs. I&#39;m not sure what they do to it or what meat they use but I loved it. And that&#39;s not even talking about the toppings which are not overwhelming but perfectly complement the dog. 

The fries are also great and crispy but also nicely warm and soggy in there too, in a good way. The large is only twenty cents more and worth it. 

Parking is plentiful here even though the place is huge and always busy. They do a great job with the drive through with multiple poor folks outside taking your order, taking your payment even with a credit card, even in the dead of winter."

Well, I gotta say, there&#39;s a reason they&#39;re a chain right?  Everything taste the same as it does in California =P   I got Italian beef with hot pepper in a french roll with extra dipping on the side. If you like gray, get extra gravy to dip in.  If you&#39;re getting to-go, I would suggest not get it dipped; otherwise it&#39;ll be extremely soggy by the time you bring it home. 

The maxwell hotdog is the way to go.  Charred hot dog with mustard and grill onion on a toasted buns.  Ahhh, it&#39;s making me drill just thinking about it.  The hotdog is made out of beef and it&#39;s extremely juicy when you bite into the crunch exterior.  Be careful thought, can those juices can burn you hard. 

Service... well... they got 2 lines to move the line fast, but the people at the front are not very helpful at all.  I asked for 2 sides of gravy, only got 1.  When I asked for extra gravy, she rolled her eyes at me and I waited extra minute just got it.  I&#39;m not sure why an extra gravy would take so long, but I guess it did.

One person took our order on paper, a second repeated our order on a headphone microphone,  a third put a pink tag on our car, a fourth collected our money. The fourth person apparently did not look at the tag. Charged us $20.26. I said, that can&#39;t be and handed her $40. To which she RUDELY replied &#34;you don&#39;t have 26 cents?!?!&#34;. I gave her 26 cents, she gave me $20 back. No receipt.

We get to the window, the staff asks about our drinks. We say large Coke and a vanilla shake. They give it to us and ask us to pull to spot 2.

Another staff member brings us all of the correct food we order then snatches it out of my husband&#39;s hands as the staff at the window is screaming &#34;bring that back!!!!&#34;.

10 minutes goes by and the fourth lady from earlier comes to the vehicle questioning us &#34;did you pay me already? How much?&#34;

However, getting the correct order through the drive-thru is a major ordeal, and frankly, not worth it.  We have had our order wrong on multiple occasions through the drive-thru over the years, but today was especially bad.  We ordered 2 Italian beefs with hot peppers, a Caesar salad, a grilled vegetable sandwich, and a large order of fries. One person took the order, the other relayed the order back to the cashier, another took our money, and another told us to wait in parking spot 1.  Each person confirmed our order each step of the way, and each time, it was right.  

After waiting 10 minutes, we got our food, and the guy who delivered it asked, &#34;did you get a salad?&#34;  We answered &#34;yes&#34; since we indeed got a salad.  He took off, but when we checked the bag, it contained only one salad with chicken, and nothing else.  It took us another 5 minutes to hail back the delivery guy, and after another few minutes of him running back and forth, he finally took our order again, and we got our food 10 minutes later.  We quickly checked the bag and went home since we were starving.

When we got home, we noticed several big problems:
1. The Italian beefs were correct, with hot peppers, but one of them was dipped, and the other, inexplicably, was not dipped, and was very dry.
2. The salad was not a Caesar salad.  It was something with romaine lettuce, 2 cherry tomatoes, and a hard boiled egg, and nothing else.
3.  There was no salad dressing provided with the salad.
4.  The large order of fries was, in fact, a small order of fries
5.  The grilled vegetable sandwich did not contain any grilled vegetables.  It was a croissant filled with some lettuce, a few slices of tomato, onions, and mayo.  Since this was our first time ordering this, we didn&#39;t know if this was supposed to be the &#34;grilled vegetable sandwich,&#34; but whatever it was, nothing was grilled about it. It did not taste good at all.

Given years of experience going to this Portillo&#39;s, these are a few tips when going to this branch&#39;s drive-thru: do not go while it&#39;s raining since it seems to be create havoc with the drive-thru, do not go during the lunch or dinner rush since they will get something wrong with the order, and really carefully check every single item in the bag before leaving.  It can get kind of hectic, but park after getting your order and take the time to open each package and check that everything is there.  Or, just go to the other branch of Jefferson to avoid frustration."

Portillo&#39;s sandwiches have become our standard for judging all other restaurants.  Order a burger  somewhere. If it&#39;s better than Portillo&#39;s it&#39;s a very good burger.

Portillos drive-throughs often are slow but sometimes I just can&#39;t help myself--I need a hotdog. This time I thought I&#39;d lucked out because there was hardly any line. I placed a simple order -- hotdog with no onions and a small fry.  The person taking money couldn&#39;t get her change machine to function. I smiled and told her to keep the change since I was in a hurry.

Then the person leaning nonchalantly against the takeout window said, &#34;Do me a favor; go park in spot 2.&#34; Uh oh. Portillos has tried to speed up drive-through service by creating parking/waiting spaces. If your jet has ever gotten stuck in the &#34;penalty box&#34; after landing at O&#39;Hare (usually when you have a narrow window to make a connection)--you know what I mean. So I parked in the penalty box, umm waiting spot. And waited. It was 20 minutes before my order was delivered with a perfunctory &#34;sorry for the wait.&#34; And after all that the fries were mushy and underdone."

Bradley, the cashier, was exceptionally pleasant and friendly. Having worked food service myself, it is my biggest pet peeve when cashiers/servers are rude (ie yawning while greeting the customer, texting in plain site, or just blatantly agitated). On second thought, the only thing worse than a rude cashier/server is a rude customer (which everyone in the food industry knows there are plenty of them) so kudos to Bradley for maintaining a positive attitude; it goes a long way.

Right when I got my sandwich, I sat down and when I opened my sandwich bag, my entire bag was soaked because the sandwich was dripping like a shower.  My sandwich bread was entirely soaked through so much so that I was grabbing meat to eat, and the bread was falling off.  The meat itself was OK, and the cheese and peppers added some flavor but overall not very good.

Overstuffed and soggy, it was like a poor imitation of a Philly cheesesteak.  Next time (if I ever come back) I will get the dip sauce on the side.  They should allow you to order it &#34;skinny&#34; like Potbelly&#39;s so it&#39;s not so overstuffed and difficult to eat.

The fries with cheese sauce were good though!"

For the second time in less than a week I have had a horrible experience with the drive-through. I didn&#39;t post anything after the first incident because hey, I&#39;ve been to this location over 100 times without a bad incident. However after tonight&#39;s incident it&#39;s time to bring it to their attention.  The first incident was on July 7th at 11am, there was none of the order takers standing outside you just ordered at the menu and pulled around to pay.  It literally took 10-15 minutes to go from the order menu to the payment window.  Two cars in front of me left before paying (this locations drive-through doesn&#39;t have a cement barrier that prevents people from leaving the drive-through), I stayed in line as I had a friend from out of town that wanted a beef sandwich.

Tonight&#39;s incident was similar except they had a crew of five people standing outside working the drive-through line (an order taker who writes your order on paper, a second person who takes the paper and calls in the order, a third person who takes payment, and two people to bring food out to the cars in line).  I placed my order and again waited almost 10 minutes to get to the payment lady (mind you there were only six cars in line which normally is nothing for this location).  Finally, I get up to the second window and am told I need to park in a waiting area.  I ordered a simple hot dog and a polish, no drinks, no fries, nothing but two basic menu items.  That&#39;s ridiculous.  If anyone from Portillos wants to look into this my order number is 68, order date was 7/11/2015, and the five digit number was 40377."

I like the location because they can handle big orders with no mix ups. Plus they&#39;re pretty fast.

First off, they weren&#39;t even playing Jazz music, but some horrible Jack Johnson crap that doesn&#39;t belong on the Portillo&#39;s airwaves. PUT ON SOME JAZZ AND LET ME SCARF DOWN MY BEEF, PLEASE!

The service here is GREAT. The guy inside taking my order was high energy and willing to throw around some fun conversation. Who wouldn&#39;t be excited being surrounded by scrumptious food ALL DAY LONG?! The woman handing out the bags of deliciousness was also really friendly-given, I was one excited Portillo&#39;s receiver. NUMERO UNO FAN!

I get a slew of things; this last particular visit, I did Gravy bread w/ hot peppers, a large fry and a chocolate milkshake. I always pour my fries on my beef/bread/or dog because it just feels right. I am dying to try the beef and cheese croissant. I have heard amazing things about it and after my eyes fell upon it, I knew it had to be mine as soon as the opportunity presents itself next!

Check it out if you&#39;re jonesin&#39; for some amazing food and are in the &#39;ville."

Every time I pass this location or the one on 59 (or any other), I see the line of cars snaking around the building and think, &#34;Are those people nuts? They&#39;re sandwiches!&#34;

Well, my boyfriend and I were in that line just the other day. I was convinced to try Portillo&#39;s once more (first time at this location). I wasn&#39;t especially impressed by their burgers before, so I decided to go with their beef sandwich, and onion rings. 

This was the best choice I&#39;ve made so far. I ordered it dry, which made it a little too dry I guess, but who wants a sopping wet sandwich, especially to go? I don&#39;t get it. I guess it&#39;s a cultural thing. Ahem. Anyway, still tasty enough, and the onion rings were excellent.

The &#34;man on the street&#34; ordering system does get things moving, though I felt bad for the person standing out there in the heat wave (likewise when it&#39;s zero degrees in the winter and they&#39;re outside). 

Overall, still don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be rushing back, but at least I can give it a little more hometown respect."

I had a  Chicago dog w/ everything and a chili dog w/ cheese and onions.  Only things I disliked were the 1)pickle spear because it was off-tasting and not crunchy 2)onions, which I wish were more finely diced because they were a bit overpowering.  
My bf had the italian sausage and a chocolate milkshake.  The milkshake was awesomely cold and thick.  It was a great way to end the night after the Chicago Auto Show."

I ordered a Hot Dog with all the dressings! The Celery Salt really stuck out and enhanced the flavor. The pickle, the relish, sport peppers, mustard, etc etc ~ Mmmm! I just want to eat these everyday!

The Cheesefries... I don&#39;t even like cheese... they were sooo goood! I just kept eating them. And the fries! Crispy, potato-ey, perfect!

I sampled my friend&#39;s Big Beef sandwch, now there&#39;s some good beef!

The only thing I didn&#39;t love was the fact that my poppyseed bun was soggy, only about half of it was still bread so it didn&#39;t hold together great. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;ll still eat it, given the chance, any day! But soggy bun, a no no for me."

After having my hot dog, I was incorrect in this assumption.

The hot dog I received came on a standard poppy seed bun, what made this bun a little different than most was the fact that it was soggy having been steamed for too long or incorrectly. The condiment application was uneven, there was very little relish or mustard but lots and lots of onions. The pickle was the standard thick cut one used by other Portillo&#39;s locations. They applied sport peppers, but this was not long enough to have pepper in every bite.

Overall, this was a very sloppy hot dog. The uneven amount of onions, combined with the soggy bun. What makes a Chicago hot dog great is tasting every single component of the hot dog and properly complimenting the sausage without one flavor overpowering the rest. The pickle and onions completely dominated the taste of this hot dog .As with anywhere that you eat at a variety of factors such as when you go, who prepares your food, and other variables can all be significant factors in the quality of your food. However, as it stands this is my worst experience with a Portillo&#39;s hot dog yet.  Portillo&#39;s can definitely do better than this."

The food is great like all portillos. However the people who work here are just the worst. We came in and ordered 3 beefs, and a fry to share. Paid and walked over to the other counter to pick it up. They had roughly 8 people in the restaurant. We waited and waited. After 15 minutes it was ready. The fries had sat, finished for all 15 minutes.

Their food is amazing, and is ceremoniously the first thing I eat whenever I return to the Chicago area from traveling.

It&#39;s both hard to turn in to, and hard to turn out of. I&#39;m not sure you can really blame the restaurant for traffic, but, just be aware that if you go during rush hour and need to either turn left in or turn left out you&#39;ll be in for a wait."

If you get your food to go, you should expect that the dipped IB and the hot dog are going to be fairly soggy, but that&#39;s just the price you pay for ordering it to go.

First, I went into a line around 6, I knew it was going to be good but darn it I wanted my chopped salad.  I went over there asked for 1 chopped salad, a diet coke no ice, and a small fry (for on the long ride I had to go home).  So I am in line for 10 minutes, which is fine because it&#39;s PEAK dinner time on a Friday night.  So I went through and finally got to the window where they tell you either to park or give you your food.  I kid you not, they asked me to get out of my car and get my food.  At first I was hesitant because I thought they were joking but she was holding out the food so I throw my car into park and get out of my car walk three steps to get my food.  I shook it off, but was a little miffed because I had to pick up my food out of my car in a drive through.  What ever its not the end of the world we live in a first world country where some people are lucky to have a meal. I went to go grab some of my fries because I hadn&#39;t eaten much because of a busy work day.  They forgot my fries. I was upset, yes but not that upset because I knew it was peak hours and having worked in a cafeteria I know how hard it is to get orders right.  Thinking they didn&#39;t charge me I shrugged it off and ate my yummy lemon poppy seed muffin which they did not forget and it was nice and warm.  As I got to my destination I quick looked at the receipt and saw they did charge me.  I am not going to make a fuss over 2 dollars guys but I am a little disappointed this is the first time I have had any issues with my favorite fast food restaurant.  I went to the location on Jefferson literally right next door to my work during same hours same busy day and they got my order right, same order.  Portillo&#39;s is amazing and I won&#39;t let this experience keep me from eating here.  Just a little disappointed that this happened."

I am reaching out to my Kababayans. Please read the other reviews and start evaluating the service you are providing your customers.

1) Slow service 2) Food is ok. 3) the man didn&#39;t know how to make change.

There were 4 of us and we ordered a side of lumpia (filipino egg rolls), 2 orders of the bbq sampler (bbq chicken, shrimp, and pork on a bamboo stick )with a side of rice. Since this was a food court type setting, I tried to pay for the food and was told to pay later on after we eat. Ok? I could easily just meander over to HMart after I chowed. Oh well. The man came out with two little stryrofoam cups of chicken arroz caldo, and two kutsintas topped with toasted coconut ,and 3 sets of plastic utensils rolled together in a napkin.  Remember that there were 4 of us.  The arroz caldo and kutsinta tasted as it should have, nothing special.  He then disappeared into the curtain. Meanwhile, there were two other customers who waited.  15 to 20 minutes later, he came out with the bbq sticks. We asked for another set of utensils.  He took the orders of the two customers and disappeared again.  We finished eating our dinner, no lumpia, and no extra utensils. It must&#39;ve been 35 minutes since we put that order in.  We cleared our table and no lumpia! When that lumpia finally showed up on our table, it was dripping oil.  I didn&#39;t even bother to eat it. 
So I go to pay for the food and this man forgot what I ordered. He wrote the order down as I talked.  He fidgeted with the cash register and his phone for a couple of minutes.  The situation turned awkward as I waited there.  I pretended to be interested in reading their menu to let him know that he can take his time.  The man looked at me and smiled, &#34; So you ordered 2 bbq samplers and a side of lumpia?&#34;  &#34;Yes,&#34; I said. He answered, &#34;So how much change do I give you?&#34; I stood there and tried to do the math in my head. I had to tell him how much change to give me? whoa? Do the owners not realize that the restaurant business is cut throat? So why hire a guy who has never worked with money and customer service.  

I won&#39;t be coming back. Best of luck Mabuhay."

I&#39;m a traveling consultant home on Thursday and on Friday we have made a habit of a day date on Friday while kids are in school.  This place is legit. Very fresh seafood and prepared with care to please the customer. We always split the lunch sushi special and an order of the ramen with CHICKEN (best IMHO).  Honestly never had a bad meal... every roll has been delicious.  
Staff is very nice and welcoming (despite us getting there 30 min before afternoon siesta) and the sushi chefs always yell out as we leave ty for coming.
We trust this place so much that I ordered a mass amount of Cali rolls for the last super bowl party 2016 and asked for them to be cut thinner for a party of that size. They couldn&#39;t be anymore accommodating and the rolls were a hit to guests normally used to fried whatever.  
If you are in the area hit this place up you won&#39;t regret it. Solid western suburbs sushi."

I was really excited to try this place out after seeing how many Yelpers enjoyed their experience, but mine was completely different! I am going to start by saying that the service here was excellent and I would hate to undermine any of the waitstaff because they all did a great job. Where my 2 stars come from is the food. 

I tried the combination tempura appetizer, 2 sushi rolls, and the spicy chicken ramen. The tempura starter was extremely disappointing- it literally had zero flavor...not even a pinch of salt. The sushi rolls that we ordered were ok in regards to flavor and quality of ingredients but they were rolled so loosely that they were impossible to eat without having them fall completely apart. This seems like an amateur mistake. Lastly, the spicy ramen brought the heat-but that was it. It was another exceedingly bland dish with an over-cooked egg and very little chicken to be found."

Very clean Japanese styled place with staff being very attentive, suggestive and fun. You can see the owners putting a lot of love into and by the reviews so far, it&#39;s paying off. 

Starter was Ox Tail Gyoza suggested by the owners wife. Perfectly cooked, just enough sear  and not what I was expecting.  
Main course was another special suggested by owner; Crunchy Spicy Crab. This was a lightly fried tuna with shredded crab topped with fish eggs over pressed steamed rice. Very spicy indeed and was forewarned it was and should be prepared. 

At the end I wanted something for lunch tomorrow and ordered Chicken fried rice, very large portion for the price.  Sampled some before I left and enjoyed it.

Service, water was always topped off without asking, a very limited beer selection but the crafted cocktail list was solid. 

For demographics; a nice variety of people in the place. Good for a date night but also good for a group of folks. A solid take out business too as I notice a steady stream of people coming and going.

Next time I&#39;ll sit at the sushi bar and give a few items a go."

Beautiful presentation and incredibly tasty.  I also ordered the Chicken, which I assumed would come out in the typical cubed Hibachi style.  Instead, it came out as whole chicken breasts with sautéed veggies and fried rice.  It had a teriyaki flavor which was great and came with Miso soup and salad with ginger dressing.  

I recommend checking this place out!"

Our server(whose name we didn&#39;t catch), was the most attentive and friendly woman. She checked up on us and gave us some help in choosing our entree since it was our first time. The sushi was EXQUISITE. All the rolls tasted like they were fished in the back room. It was THAT fresh!

When another group arrived and was served right away we had enough.  Waiting for 15-20 minutes when you are famished is not a good time.

As you walk in the door the sushi chefs, waitstaff, and bartender all greet you hello! The decor is very sushi modern with exposed beams and hanging lights, a huge departure from the previous tenants of the space (sillypots lol). Fresh &amp; clean, this place is perfect for sushi. 

We tried the Maki Moto, a basic collection of their Maki Rolls with miso soup and a huge salad, and was very happy with it. The salad was fresh, big enough to share. The miso soup was simple, salty, and good. Some local sushi restaurants can have that fishy, old taste, but here at Shu&#39;s, it was fresh, light flavors all around in their rolls.   He had the Blue Lagoon that has little scallops resting atop, basically, a spicy crab roll, and it was awesome. The scallops were light, perfectly cooked, delicious.  

Only complaints:

1) We had very attentive service, albeit a bit novice. The waitstaff seems very young and inexperienced (read as awkward), though I can&#39;t complain. I was a terrible waitress once, so who am I to judge.

2) The booth tables are too low and the booth seats are too high. This makes for a posture perfect dinner. 

**Otherwise, my new sushi joint.**"

I always have issues with new restaurants poorly put together that open. This place was on point the entire time. Very classy yet comfortable even for my children. The staff was very friendly and knowledgable but not over bearing. There cocktails looked amazing and were flying out of the bar.
Food
If you do not like sushi, this place has a ton of really good options from ramen noodles to chicken teriyaki. By no means is this just another sushi rest. But if you do like Sushi your in luck! Its incredible. Everything we had from the Volcano, crunchy Muffy, special spicy tuna (all cooked) specialty rolls, to the sashimi dinner were fantastic. The menu copies Sword Fish which is my favorite but now closer to home! I highly, highly recommend this restaurant!

We wanted to try a new place &amp; thought we&#39;d give this place a try based on the Yelp reviews.  We&#39;re so glad we did. 

The place is kinda smaller and you&#39;d probably drive right past it as it&#39;s in a strip mall with Ace Hardware and a bunch of other stores.  We had reservations at 7 and arrived just before it.  We were greeted warmly and seated immediately.  Every employee we passed on the way to our table was very warm, friendly, genuinely saying hi.  Nice start and touch! The place has a good overall decor and we were seated in a corner booth.  The only thing I&#39;d change is make the place a little darker to add to the ambience &amp; give the booths padded.  The booth we were sitting in was all hard wood but we had some black leather seat backs and cushions to aid our comfort.  

Our waitress for the evening was Rebecca and she was the best!  Extremely warm, genuine, friendly, telling us what the best rolls were, what to stay away from, etc.  We were seated &amp; she took our drink order after a few minutes.  Kelly had a mango martini which she loved.  I had a Cap&#39;n &amp; Diet and it was very good.  We perused the menu, though I had an idea of what I had wanted by looking at the reviews, pics and online menu.   

We ordered the poke tuna appetizer &amp; then had 4 different maki rolls:  the Kiss of Fire (I&#39;m a man.  Sushi.  Flames.  How do I NOT order this?), the Green Dragon, a Caterpillar roll &amp; the Lobster Mountain (a VD special).  Rebecca said we chose excellently!  Always good to hear. We waited maybe 5 minutes before the appetizer came out.  It lasted maybe all of 5 seconds.  The rest of the rolls came out about 10 minutes later.   Everything was extremely fresh, tasty, bigger than we normally see at a sushi place and priced about the same as most everywhere else.  We loved every bite of all of them.  The Kiss of Fire had some hot spice in it, which this gringo isn&#39;t a huge fan of, but its wasn&#39;t enough to really deter me or not have a few more pieces.   For us, Swordfish in Batavia is usually the bar for our sushi.  We had mentioned this to Rebecca as she had asked what we thought. &amp; she said that the chef actually came from there!  How awesome, yet funny!  We ordered just the right amount of food as it was almost a struggle to finish it all.  We asked for the check and it came within a minute or 2.  I gave her the credit card &amp; we were good to go.  As we left, Rebecca smiled at us, waving while the rest of the staff all smiled and said thanks for coming, have a great night, etc. 

All in all, some very minor decor dings for me but we loved this place &amp; will gladly go back for more!  Decor was nice &amp; clean.  Service, both from our waitress &amp; others, was warm, friendly, prompt, etc.  Our glasses were never empty, nor close to it.  Food was excellent, right up there with the best we&#39;ve had in Illinois!    We&#39;ll definitely be back &amp; hopefully have Rebecca as our waitress again!"

Kind and attentive wait staff.  And they had a couple of interesting grill items, like grilled octopus balls and oxtail pot stickers.  The gyoza dumplings were fresh, not frozen.  All in all, I&#39;ll be back.  And I can&#39;t say that about most suburban sushi."

Spicy Tuna roll is amazing - love the wrap on the outside - wish more places would do it this way. California Roll is also best of the best on quality. I haven&#39;t gotten much into the specialty rolls yet but they sound good.

Price is a little higher but not outrageous considering the rolls are easily twice the size of other area sushi places. Lunch is a fantastic deal - 2 rolls, salad and soup for $10.

Decor is great - completely re-done from Silly Pots. It&#39;s very chic and easily outclasses the strip mall it&#39;s located in.

Please support this restaurant and keep it open. I&#39;ve tried all of the other places in Oswego and down Rt. 59 and this blows them all out of the water."

The design of this place is really modern (once you step inside......the outside doesn&#39;t do it justice) . Clean lines. Very tidy. Its kept very meticulously clean. 

Its location WILL fool you into thinking &#34;uh-oh.....strip mall sushi&#34; to anyone who is used to going to nice places........ but I assure you the chefs and their knives are quite skilled and the fish and other ingredients are extremelty fresh. 


The presentations are very skillfully displayed, and therre is a variety of eating styles catered to with their menu. American-ized dishes that involve tempura/frying and sauces are available, but more &#34;home style&#34; seaweeed/fish/rice combos are also there.  

The service is very good.  Greeted with well wishes....coming and leaving from the staff/gang there. The wine/beer list is &#34;OK&#34; but don&#39;t expect anything really fancy or a miracle.

 If one of the serving ladies reads this, I was a little embarassed to say anything, cause you&#39;re so very helpful in guiding/explaining...... I will tip you even betterr if you chew some minty gum.........she had a little bit of bad breath.......but  NOT a big deal. Again......Your service is still great, informative, prompt, thoughtful. friendly !!!!!!!

The photos that are here for you to see are extremely accurate!! !!!!The food is lovely on the eyes. it looks just like what you see. Exactly. I love that about this place.

Im a little worried that they might struggle because I haven&#39;t seen it crowded yet...........and they REALLY deserve to get people who know or appreciate high quality sushi without paying downtown prices.  Its not &#34;cheap&#34; sushi, but it isn&#39;t over the top, either, But VERY good people working there, as mentioned. Please support this local small business and pass the word on facebook!"

Long Story:
We apparently went on a busy night, but that&#39;s not really an excuse. Three times the waitstaff said &#34;Oh sorry, we forgot about you.&#34;  That&#39;s not so good, but for a new place it might have been okay.  Food-wise, is was soooo slow to arrive and overall it was meh. Not as fresh as I would have expected, and flavors were over-stated. For example,  I started with the tuna flight and some of the pieces tasted fishy and had that slivery slime when the fish is starting to turn.

We ended up leaving after almost 2 hours without having received our main course.  We called Sakamoto from the car for pick up (less than a 5 minute drive) and it was ready when we arrived.

Bottom line:  this place has a long way to go.  I&#34;m not sure if all the 5-star reviews are from relatives or from those who don&#39;t know better, but if you&#39;re looking for a legit sushi place in Oswego, go to Sakamoto on Rt. 34."

While we have favorites in Batavia, Wheaton and Naperville it&#39;s nice to not have to travel when you want sushi. Sakamoto is not bad but it&#39;s small and cramped and the manager is less than friendly. We&#39;ve been to Shu&#39;s twice now. I agree about the table height vs bench height but it&#39;s doable. 

Love being greeted as you walk in the door. All staff is very attentive. Both times we&#39;ve been in a woman, I assume to be the owner/manager, stops by the table to see how things are. Our first visit there we were served by Rea. She has a wonderful sense of humor and is attentive. The second visit we requested her and she remembered us. Great service. 

Now for the food we&#39;ve experienced:

Sake flights. They have two to choose from. They are $12 a flight that include three generous portions. The flight will last throughout the meal and pairs nicely with the sushi.

Appetizer: Ahi poki tuna. Hands down one of the best things I&#39;ve ever tasted. Tuna tartar sitting on a bed of lightly salted sliced cucumbers. It is then encased in the thinnest slices of avocado I&#39;ve ever seen and drizzled with sesame oil. I&#39;m talking &#34;last meal&#34; good.

The rolls I&#39;ve tried so far are wonderful. One favorite is the Crispy Spicy Tuna. Tuna served on a crunchy pad of deep fried sushi rice. Something I must order each time in addition to something different so that I can try them all.

My husband prefers the regular sushi. His &#34;sampler&#34; has included: Toro, Red Snapper, Scallop, Scottish Salmon, Sea Urchin, Tuna, Unagi, Yellow Tail and Sweet Shrimp served with the deep fried shrimp head by request. It is not inexpensive but worth every penny knowing that it is fresh.

If you like sushi, do yourself a favor and try Shu&#39;s."

First - I have been to this location when it used to be Silly Pots, and you would never ever know when entering. The restaurant has a great modern feel to is, with a wonderful atmosphere. We sat in the booth and the only complaint we would have is that the space between the bench and the table (height-wise) was too narrow. I know that this is a typical arrangement for an asian style restaurant - just a heads up for people who need a bit more space for their legs. They do have regular tables as well.
Their menu right now is quite extensive, and the servers are good at helping you choose.
There were a few very minor glitches. I had to wait for a wine glass and a soy sauce dish when they only brought two to the table after we were seated - I guess they don&#39;t get a party of 3 very often ;-)  The staff is young and likely new, but absolutely polite and friendly. With more experience they will continue to do a phenomenal job. Our waitress came to our table after we already ordered our drinks, and asked if there was one wine we&#39;d choose from the menu, which one would it be. I was thinking they were doing research in order to improve their menu. Little did we know, that one of my friend&#39;s boyfriend called in and ordered an appetizer and a bottle of wine for us! The staff handled it great and it was such a pleasant surprise for us.
The food was simply amazing. Unfortunately we came for a very late dinner, not realizing that the restaurant closes at 9:30 on weeknights. We didn&#39;t get a chance to try out a dessert and were unable to place a to-go order for our significant others as the kitchen was already closed when we asked.
That only means that next time we will be there extra early and allow plenty of time to try out all of the things we didn&#39;t get a chance to taste during this visit.
It is great to have a restaurant of such quality in Oswego, and especially on this side of town, away from the major shopping areas. I really hope more people will give this place a try and ensure that Shu&#39;s will stay in this location for the long run!"

I have never eaten in the restaurant so I can not comment on table service however the to go service and timing needs work.  The first time we ordered to go they gave us a 25 minute pick up time and upon my husband getting there he had to wait an additional 30 minutes.  Last night we ordered with another couple for to go and same thing happened.  I called and ordered, she said 25 minutes and my husband had to wait an additional 30 minutes?!?

I read the reviews here, and decided to give it a go for lunch. We will definitely be back. We have been loyal to Wild Tuna in Naperville for many years, but wanted to try local. We have been to Sakamoto in Oswego several times, and it was ok. This place is fabulous! Fresh seafood, great rolls, and excellent service. So many places don&#39;t make it in our town, unless they are chain restaurants. Please visit Shu&#39;s and help keep it in business!!"

Stopped in for dinner on a weekday night around 7 and place was empty, which is never a great sign. Three in our group, we ordered 6 assorted rolls based on our server&#39;s suggestions to try out as well as dinner salads. Salad was delicious, with just the right amount of ginger dressing and very fresh lettuce and other add-ins. The rolls were....well, very, very delicious and expertly prepared. We enjoyed all 6 &amp; I wish I could remember the names but I leave it to my daughter to do the sushi ordering when we head out to eat sushi since I&#39;m kind of a novice at it. The decor is very comfortable and everything in there just felt clean &amp; that great care was put into designing the place. One other very appreciated touch is that there is good spacing between the tables so that, unlike Sakamoto, you&#39;re not sitting directly next to other patrons as if they were in your dinner party. Server was terrific &amp; very attentive (yeah, I know--- I said the place was empty so maybe she was just trying to keep busy...)  :)   I&#39;ll give her the benefit of the doubt as she was very pleasant &amp; her service seemed very genuine.

Highly recommend it and while we still like Sakamoto for the food, I believe we&#39;ll be stopping in at Shu&#39;s a LOT more frequently when we look for sushi!"

Our whole dinning experience was wonderful. They had a wide variety of nigiri&#39;s and Maki selections along with specialty appetizers. We started off with tuna flight appetizer and it was very fresh and presentation was amazing. Move on to main dish I picked nine pieces of chefs choice nigiri along with the rainbow roll. The nigiri was one of the best I ever had. It contained perfect balance of rice and fish altogether. Rain bow roll was very delicious as well. My friend ordered ribeye steak dish and spicy tuna roll. He also was satisfied with his food and we both had a great time catching up with great food and drinks. Btw they had a full bar with wide range of wine choices. It was nice to find such authentic Japanese restaurant out in the burbs with great food and ambience. Definitely will be back when I&#39;m up there again. Looking forward to try many of their other specialty rolls next time!

We try to eat something new every time we go to Twin Peaks and we have yet to be disappointed. They have a ton of TVs so it doesn&#39;t really matter where you sit because you will always see one. The manager is cool and we requested a game to be played on the big tv in front of us and he played it! 

I would rather go here for a game than anywhere else. Beer is the same price as any other place but it stays cold and it seems to taste better when it&#39;s 29 degrees lol."

We had someone take our drinks and had them right away. But we were pretty hungry and we had to wait for more than 40 minutes before our waitress could even notice our existence. She was serving people right next to us but never asked us what we wanted to eat, if we were doing fine, NOTHING!!!

The worst part is we had to stand up and literally wave at her to get her attention and we asked for the check because we did not like the service and mentioned to her that we waited for so long and no one asked us what we want to eat. She was totally unapologetic and she got our checks and just left. WORST SERVICE EVER!!! We walked into the Buffalo wild wings right across which turned out to be great."

Only complaint I really have is the service is very slow and they forget orders all the time. Not sure if they&#39;re overwhelmed or just not component, but it&#39;s rather obnoxious when I order a basic burger with a beer, and the burger gets over cooked or comes out a sandwich. If you do go in, ask for Emily. She&#39;s the best!

Atmosphere is really cool tho. I enjoy coming here for sports and a quick drink after a movie at the theatre. Plenty of TV&#39;s and usually always have all Chicago teams on, even the Cubs for some reason.

Food is average. Menu is plain and not a lot of variety. My favorite it the Hangover burger and onion rings! Their beer is always below 32 degrees and served in a tall frozen glass. 

P.S. If you take your girlfriend here, she will hate you after. Lol"

At a co-workers suggestion, a group of us came here during the week for some drinks and food.

Two people in our group commented about the small food menu.  The menu is typical bar food:  fried appetizers, burgers and sandwiches, salads, etc.  But overall the variety was far less than similar restaurants nearby.  You really can&#39;t go wrong with chicken tenders, mozzarella cubes, and fried pickles though.  There&#39;s cold beer and a full bar too.

I had to laugh at the &#34;man&#34; and &#34;girl&#34; sized beers.  It&#39;s smart marketing, as only the most confident of man would dare order the &#34;girl&#34; size.  Yes, it&#39;s sexist, blah blah blah...but seriously, you know what kind of place this is by the name &#34;Twin Peaks.&#34;  Despite that, families can safely come here.  The waitresses wear short shorts and crop tops, but it&#39;s actually less revealing than what most women wear to the local pool.

We had a great server who returned to our table frequently to check on us and handled our drunk co-worker with a good sense of humor.

Twin Peaks is OK.  I wasn&#39;t impressed by the food or drinks, but it&#39;s an alright place and a decent watering hole after work hours."

I haven&#39;t gotten terrible service in a LONG time. Even if you look at my past reviews most have had nothing to say about terrible service. Reading my previous review from this place ...IT WAS ALL FOR SHOW. These hoes do not give a flying fuck about you unless you have a dick. A girlfriend and I came here for drinks since I&#39;m right around the corner from work.

We only had 1 order of man sized dirty blondes which were great per usual but our waitress sucked. Katelynn walked past us not once not twice not even three times but a fourth time when I had my credit card ready to be billed 20 minutes ago. To add insult to injury it was going on a 5th time but my friend threw the bill
In her face as she attempted to walk by.

Unbelievable, and of course tending to the male population first. I am always a great tipper and it was going to be 20% till this occurred. Totally ruined my perspective of this place. Over it."

Place was about half full when we arrived, and we were seated promptly. We took a few minutes to decide; there&#39;s nothing special about the menu. They have  typical bar fare, including sandwiches, burgers, and hot dishes (i.e. pot roast, fish, chicken, etc.) If you aren&#39;t aware, Twin Peaks offers eats, drinks, and scenic views. The latter refers to their scantily clad dressed waitresses, a la Hooters or Tilted Kilt.

My friend ordered the blackened tacos with a side of broccoli. I ordered the grilled chicken and shrimp combo, also with a side of broccoli. He enjoyed his dish, as did I.

Our service was a bit slow; not sure why it took so long to make some simple dishes. Waitress was nice; I kind of feel bad for the waitresses who work there, but I&#39;m guessing they make decent money, and they choose to work there. I guess I could never wear what they wear and be comfortable. Although I don&#39;t know when I would ever be comfortable in short shorts and a shift that shows my stomach. I guess that&#39;s a #guyproblem.

Total was 26 and change. A bit pricey in my opinion for the amount and the quality of the food. I don&#39;t really have anything negative to say about the place, but there&#39;s nothing that great about it either. Very cookie cutter. Would I go back? Possibly, if I had a coupon or something.

Clientele was heavily male, as expected. Lots of golfers were dining in when I went there. I guess going to Twin Peaks after golf is a thing.

Extra 1/2 star for them holding onto my credit card and not losing/using it. Always good to know I can be stupid and trust strangers."
twin-peaks-restaurant-warrenville-2,Rod C.,GeTWFhlcT2OOsORxA2vUtQ,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,118,393,jxB4mZ6TZdzWkU_D635u1w,4.0,2016-01-08,"Not sure I agree with many of the negative reviews for this place.  For my first time at TP&#39;s I met a buddy at the Warrenville location.  Almost Immediately I was impressed with all of the TV&#39;s, there must be AT LEAST 100 here, at least inside as there are a handful of TV&#39;s outside as well!

Right away I was greeted by 3 easy on the eyes hostesses upon my entry.  I sat over at a high table section for 2.  There isn&#39;t a bad view because every direction is a sports highlight on TV or a TP waitress which isn&#39;t bad at all!  My waitress, Keirsten, was great!  I never had to ask for refills as she replaced my drinks when they were low, even during the busy Friday lunch hour.  You will want to ask for Keirsten&#39;s section if you want good service!  I never had to wait for anything, and she always made sure we didn&#39;t have any issues.  Again, I&#39;m not sure why this place got any negative reviews about the service.  Maybe it was former employees?

Now let&#39;s get to the food......surprisingly really good!  Maybe they worked out their kinks now as this place has been operating for a year now.  I ordered the Buttermilk chicken sliders for appetizers which were phenomenal!  Batter Fried Chicken and thick cut bacon seasoned with brown sugar, red chili flakes and smoked paprika served on honey butter/jalapeno gravy buttermilk biscuit?  These 3 sliders were ridiculously awesome!  Who wouldn&#39;t want to eat chicken like this?  Probably people who frequent KFC and Popeyes!

Next came the house salad with Honey mustard dressing.  Damn, its better than your average house salad!  I can eat a salad everyday if its this good!  For my main meal, I ordered the B.E.L.T sandwich and fries.  Bacon, Fried Egg, Pepper Jack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato and Cilantro Pesto Mayo! Yes, Yes and Yes!  This is a really good sandwich!  Only thing is that I wish it was triple layered!

The Fire Fries that came on the side.....OUTSTANDING!  I&#39;m not sure what spices are in the fries but they are one of the best tasting set of fries I&#39;ve ever had!  Believe me if you know me, I&#39;ve had a lot of fries :)

Why you should come here: The Service, the Atmosphere with the 100 TV&#39;s and the Quality of Food at reasonable prices.  Forget Buffalo Wild Wings, this is the Ultimate Sports Bar!

If you are undecided about coming here, give the place a try you wont regret it, especially if you are coming for a sporting event.  You will be surprised how good the food is and the beer which is served at below freezing temperatures!"

We were seated immediately. We were asked as we were seated if we had been there before. I had, however my wife had not.

As we looked through the menu, we were about to order some chips and queso when the manager appeared and said he heard my wife had not been here before, he wanted to welcome us and had brought over a plate of chips and queso. Nice move!

We decide to get a flavor for their specialties. For another app, we ordered the Billionaire Bacon. It was good, not as exceptional as the description would indicate, but good.

We both got the Bacon Burger. Contrary to what some others have written here, we found it excellent. I prefer mine medium rare, she prefers hers burnt beyond what a good forensic scientist could identify. Both cam out prepared exactly as ordered and were great.

While we didn&#39;t have any beer this time around, we did take note that the have a thermometer hooked up to their draft beer that consistently displays on a large sign the current beer temperature which the sign brags is always below freezing (it was).

Service was excellent and the server explained things very well and was very attentive. We generally don&#39;t do desserts, but our server suggested trying the sundae. After about 2 maybe 3 seconds of arm twisting, we spilt one before leaving.

Both my wife and I will be recommending this to friends."

I&#39;ve been here a few times and it&#39;s usually too crowded to sit at the bar. I was able to sit at the bar today because I walked in shortly after they opened. 

I love the welcome by all the servers when anyone walks in. It&#39;s nice to know the staff appreciates everyone coming in. The team at the bar was awesome!!! They wrote the girls name down and had it in the cup with the tab. I usually forget names so it was nice to have the names there. Ayanna, Ashley, Emily were a fantastic team! All the girls came by an introduced themselves. They kept our beers full and were available when we wanted to order food. 

Loved the food!! I&#39;ve always had something different but the food today was my favorite. We shared the blackened chicken quesadilla and the ranch chicken sandwich. The food was delivered hot and quickly.

Each time we&#39;ve come, the servers have been extremely helpful and personable, always giving great suggestions when I can&#39;t figure out what to order! Last time we were there, we had the kiddo (good variety of kids menu!) and a random waitress came up and started talking to us. Although our waitress was awesome, this other server asked if it was ok to give kiddo ice cream...just because :) I seriously can&#39;t say enough about the service we&#39;ve had here ;)

Typically we&#39;ll start with the mozzarella cheese bites. I think they&#39;re coated in panko, and they&#39;re absolutely delish! The quality of cheese they use is very stringy and a great melting cheese. Usually this is a burger place for me....they don&#39;t have an extensive menu, but the things we&#39;ve had are good! The hangover burger is nice and juicy and has great flavor. One time I did opt for the BLT (was a special....I don&#39;t think they currently have it on the menu) which was again delish! Both have always been paired with their mac and cheese, which has a good balance of cheese. 

For the beer lovers, it seems like this is a total beer place. They have a temperature gauge of the current on-tap drinks. They have an extensive drink menu....maybe we&#39;ll try that another day :)

I hope their reviews increase, because they&#39;ve treated us well each time we&#39;ve come out!"

Hey..don&#39;t judge me, it was my wife&#39;s decision.  Anyways, I like the place.  They don&#39;t have much of a food menu here...the majority are app&#39;s and hamburgers.  Their drink menu isn&#39;t overly extensive either but they have a respectable number of beers representing all of the different styles.  Most come here because it&#39;s a decent place to have a beer and catch a game.  Yeah, there&#39;s also the obvious reason why guys enjoy it, but aside from the Peaks you&#39;ve got a million large tv&#39;s  and they open the garage styled doors when temps condone it.  The outside terrace offers extended seating and a large firepit.  Cheers."

Before continuing, in the defense of this place - we happened to come here on a night a very important Blackhawks game was on tv.  Now that practically the entire state of Illinois has hopped on the Hockey Bandwagon, every eating/drinking establishment is packed full for these games!  I didn&#39;t go there FOR the game, though I was down to watch since I was there catching up with a friend over food and drinks before catching a movie at the Cantera 30 across the parking lot.

We got here probably before the game started, we didn&#39;t know what time it started but the girl at the hostess desk said 55 minutes for a wait, took my name &amp; number and said they would text me when our table was ready.  I really like that text feature places have adopted.  She suggested waiting at the bar which was 99% full already but we decided to make our way over for a drink...this is when things started to go wrong.  I&#39;m pretty sure we were the only two girls AT the bar...totally crashing that sausage party going on, and clearly we were invisible to them as they served males coming up to the bar AFTER us as we stood there forever waiting... then we decided to move to the corner of the bar, waited a little longer till finally we got waited on.  

Just a tip here for the ladies who work at these kinds of places...I totally get that your tips are made off these guys who come in and drool over you, but put yourself in our place and give us the service we would like to receive too because we also tip!  I tip on service, and clearly the bartenders weren&#39;t up to par.

After getting seated we literally waited another half hour with our empty beer glasses for our waitress...I knew this because the text came in at 7:30 and by 8:00 we still didn&#39;t get help.  I walked back to the hostess stand as I experienced something similar a few weeks ago at another place in Oak Brook and said nicely &#34;I get this place is super busy, but we have been sitting at our table for a half hour now and no one has come up to our table&#34;  The staff member was super nice about it and said...I know we&#39;re busy but it&#39;s still unacceptable and got our server over to us immediately.  She apologized and thought we already had a server because we had our beers (which were at the bar) and something about table reassignment... after that she was super sweet the rest of the time and very attentive.  We ordered a few more beers, a few honey badger shots and three appetizers, one which was free for signing up on their email list.

Again, not the BEST experience, but I didn&#39;t walk out of there with a bad taste in my mouth since those big mugs of beer (man-sized) were reasonable, the food was decent, and the service got better after a rapid decline...they were busy and since they are fairly new, maybe they just don&#39;t know how to handle this crowd.  I&#39;m not sure...I&#39;d probably come in here again, just not on a big sports game night! :)"

I had pretty high hopes for this place that touts itself as a lumberjack (sorry, lumber-&#39;jill&#39;) version of places like Hooters and Tilted Kilt.  Because honestly, how can you not compare them?  The plaid flannel and khaki short-shorts uniform is a fun [read: hot] idea, but I visited on a night when the entire waitstaff was wearing--get this--bunny outfits.  As in, Playboy.  Normally, this would send over-sexed dudes like me into a frenzy, but the rabbit ears, poofy bunny tails and other mismatched apparel seemed wildly out of place.  One server even had an ammo belt (?) as part of her get-up.  Dining here felt more like a trip to a Lovers Lane lingerie store and less like an outing for beer and food.

Despite being seated quickly, our server took forever to welcome us and was generally slow to act in getting our orders placed.  Other tables were getting talked up quite a bit, whereas our waitress had no time for such trivial chit-chat.  A teensy bit of innocuous pseudo-flirting wouldn&#39;t hurt your gratuity, just saying.  Also, the menu is tiny!  Not physically small in your hands, but my easy-to-please friend and I were appalled at the limited selection.  Bar apps, sandwiches, burgers.....and not much else.  Vegetarians, you&#39;re on your own.  Want something besides a salad?  Good luck.

Perhaps this location is undergoing some growing pains, but given that they&#39;re a chain, these issues shouldn&#39;t exist in all honesty.  That said.....

The venison chili was incredible.  Very hearty, peppery, and plenty of meat.  All it needed was some cheese &amp; onions, and it&#39;d be damn near the BEST cup of chili I&#39;ve ever had, no foolin&#39;.  I ordered the Twin Peaks sampler, which came with buffalo chix strips, breaded pickle chips, and mozzarella nuggets.  Pretty standard fair, although it was nice to see mozza bites in something other than extruded &#39;stick&#39; form.  It also came with ranch, blue cheese, and marinara; being a fancier of sauces, I appreciated the abundance of dipping choices.

My buddy got the chicken and shrimp, which he proclaimed good.  The steak fries that came with it were notably great, as they were dusted with some sort of southwestern seasoning.  The beer was cold, and reasonably priced, I thought ($5.75 for a 20oz mug of their weissbier).

Mediocre menu selection and subpar service doesn&#39;t leave me aching to return.  In my opinion, Twin Peaks falls somewhere in between Hooters and Tilted Kilt as far as &#39;breastaurants&#39; are concerned.  In ascending order (from bad to good), it looks something like this: TK -- TP -- Hooters -- Brickhouse.  Tilted Kilt is far-and-away the worst of the bunch, and Brickhouse still reigns supreme.  So essentially, Twin Peaks runs in the middle of the pack.

Would return, I guess, with some hesitation."

It&#39;s basic, it&#39;s worst then basic bar food. 

Because I like breast, I&#39;ve come back here to try it again. I REALLY wanted to like it but the main entrees suck. Even simple things like a burger w/ fries. =( 

If this place had great wings like hooters or even decent food, it would be awesome. It looks the part but just doesn&#39;t cut it with the food."

My buddy and I went to a local wing joint on Saturday but they were packed and there was zero chance to get any food. We decided to drive down the road and give Twin Peaks a shot. The idea of scandalously clad woman was the main driver but we were also hungry. We were greeted relatively quick and taken to our booth. There were tvs everywhere you looked which made watching the packers cardinals game enjoyable. Our server arrived and that&#39;s where everything took a turn for the worse. She was sweet but her acting felt forced. We ordered a few beers, a man size and a lady size...poor marketing in my opinion. 

She recommended the billionaires bacon for an appetizer. It was decent. It was cold and greasy which was ok because it&#39;s bacon, but the presentation was piss poor and the portion was pathetic. We finished our beers and our bacon and continued to wait for our server to place our entree order. We waited and waited some more. We noticed a good amount of standing around on the line by the service staff. It seemed they were there more for the social aspect than to actually do any type of work. Once our server finally realized we were still in her section, she graced us with her presence! 

We ordered chicken wings(green chili Parmesan and ghost pepper for sauces) and the Chicken Ranch sandwich. The food showed up remarkably fast. The lack luster presentation was to be expected but I had higher hopes for the flavor. The wing sauces were decent but the wings were almost under cooked. There was zero crisp to them and somewhat slimy. The chicken ranch sandwich was bland and disappointing. Our server decided to grace our presence roughly eight minutes into our meal. She never once asked about the wings(of which I had only eaten three of the twelve), but she did ask about the sandwich. She mentioned that she had it once and it was not good and she would never order it again....thanks for the heads up!

I did notice what looked to be a manager wandering between three different points in the bar; the host stand, the well area, and the kitchen line. Not once did I see him stop by any tables or speak to any guests at the bar. I decided he needed to know about our experience and approached him at one of three places, the service well. I explained to him that I didn&#39;t want anything for free, I just needed him to know about our poor experience. After a brief conversation, I returned to my table and waited for our server to bring the check. The manager stopped by and apologized for the service and food and took the entrees off the check. As generous as that was of him, it&#39;s not enough to make me return. 

If you don&#39;t care about food or service quality and you are going for the &#34;entertainment&#34; than this is the place for you. There are similar concepts that at able to do it all well, this isn&#39;t one of them."

I really wish that yelp had a font in the voice of Tim Allen from Tool Time doing his caveman voice, because this place celebrates your inner caveman. Is it a place I would take my mom? Well yes, but that is only because my mom and dad used to take my brother and I to the Playboy Club as kids. Is Twin Peaks as classy as the old Playboy Cub? No, but times have changed and the Club was 60&#39;s to 70&#39;s chic and Twin Peaks hits a vibe that appeals to today&#39;s youth that isn&#39;t offended with young ladies dressed as &#34; Lumberjills&#34;. Heck, Victoria Secrets even has a nationally televised underwear....I mean &#34;fashion show&#34;.
The food is comfort food with a risqué theme. The beverages follow the same theme, and all seems rather tongue in cheek and in good fun. Is it a 5 Star gourmet restaurant, no; but it&#39;s a great place to watch a game with the guys (and girls not put off by the costumes). The decor is a mountain or cabin theme, beer is colder than ice cold (29 degrees) and they have theme nights that follow holidays and even sporting themed events. 
So, if your a fan of &#34;Hooters&#34; or &#34;Tilted Kilt&#34; types of &#34;breasturants&#34;give them a try. Easily offended, my recommendation would be to avoid Twin Peaks."

The place was absolutely packed with people, so it took about an hour to get a table.  Once we got our table everything was much improved.  Our server was absolutely awesome, she was attentive and quick with the food and drinks.  The place is new, so I was expecting some hiccups with the service, but everything was great.  If you don&#39;t know, the place is sort of like Tilted Kilt or Hooters, except with Northwoods lodge feel to it.  Young, attractive women serving cold beer in short shorts and revealing tops.  If this is your thing, check it out.

The food.... Several of us got the cheese cube appetizer and I would highly recommend it.  You get a huge serving and the cubes are really good.  I got the chicken fingers with fries and they are very good, although pretty standard fair.  The only item on the menu that really needs help is the burger.  No one at our table liked the burger and I&#39;ve had the Twin Peaks burger at another location and it was the same.  It&#39;s a very thin, grey, frozen patty and it definitely needs some work.  If you are going to cater to males in their 20-30&#39;s you should have a killer burger and this one is below average.  Everything else on the menu is great, just avoid the burger. 

The bathroom... In all my years writing Yelp reviews I&#39;ve never once mentioned the bathroom, but here it goes.  There is a 3&#34; gap around the stall doors in the bathroom, so you better not be shy if you are going to use a bathroom stall.  I checked with some of the females in our group and the women&#39;s bathroom is the same way.  They literally might as well just remove the stall doors and have you do your business in front of everyone.  Hopefully this is something that is being fixed.

Anyhow... in summary.  Great service, cool atmosphere, great food (except for the burgers) and odd bathrooms that need some work.  I will definitely be back here."

Very nice place lots of TVs good drinks.  Tried a Tom Collins for the first time.  It was excellent!!!  Ordered the Hangover Burger it was great but had one big complaint.  The burger patty is extremely to thin and small for the bun size.  It explains why they never asked how I wanted it cooked. 

I would also say it&#39;s a little over priced for what you get that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t get 4 stars."

The service is always fantastic.  The staff is always courteous and friendly, frequently checking in on their patrons to make certain they have a fantastic dine in experience. The entire staff is great, but if you ever get a chance to be waited on by Ayanna, or served by her at the bar,  take full advantage of that opportunity, you won&#39;t be disappointed. She always goes above and beyond to ensure that the customer is having the best possible experience. She is very sociable, outgoing and will likely put many smiles on your face.

The decor is nice and new and there are TVs EVERYWHERE which makes it perfect to watch sporting events.
Drinks: i ordered a mint julep since it was derby day and was told they didn&#39;t have the ingredients to make one. I settled on beer but the bf got a Bloody Mary that looked nothing like the picture in that it lacked all the fixins (no bacon, no pickle, etc.) his second mixed drink had little to no booze in it and when he ordered a Makers Mark Manhattan the server returned with a shot of Makers Mark. TRAIN YOUR BAR STAFF BECAUSE THEY SUCK! Beer selection was mediocre and they didn&#39;t even have a beer menu so you had to just look at the taps and try to pick one (if you could see them from where you were seated). 
Food/service: I asked our server if they had boneless wings and she told me they did but then came back after I ordered them to tell me that they do not but could toss chicken strips in wing sauce. It seemed like she really didn&#39;t know what was going on. Anyway, I got the chicken strip basket tosses in green chile Parmesan sauce which was decent. It came with steak fries that were REALLY good! The bf got mozzarella cubes which were also tasty but the marinara was weird and gross. After lunch our server left and we got a new server Paige who was bubbly and friendly, unlike our original server who was an airhead who got uncomfortably close when she spoke to you. We stayed for hours so we ordered a steak salad later in the evening that was disappointing. The dressing was sour and the steak was tough. After drinking and eating all day we only dropped about $80 for both of us so I&#39;d say it&#39;s very reasonably priced!"

The girls were friendly and the food was what I expected. I brought my son back to celebrate his 15th birthday Sunday, Waited 15 minutes for a waitress to come up to tell us that she didn&#39;t know who was serving the booth we were seated. The music was  too LOUD, I HAD TO YELL TO THE WAITRESS. 
All in all, the girls were pretty, pretty unfriendly, but pretty non the less, and my son enjoyed himself. Definitely the tale of two experiences, weekday versus the weekend."

The staff in general is friendly and upbeat.  My most recent visit here was specifically to order the blackened chicken quesadilla.  The last time I ordered it I was impressed.  The flavors were great, the mixture of chicken, beans, corn, and cheese was spot on.  The salsa that came with also paired well.  The most recent time I had the chicken quesadilla, that was not the case.  I felt like I was eating a tortilla stuffed with nacho cheese.  It was just overwhelming and not enjoyable.  The salsa was also missing.  The price point on the food is reasonable.  The portions are larger so I share with my wife.  The burgers, chicken sandwiches, and fire fries are pretty good.  There are tv&#39;s all over, they are in the booths, outside, and cover wall to wall.  Definitely a great place to catch a game.  I like the cold beers, but occasionally I get a dirty glass which is hard to see until the ice thaws and the beer is pretty much gone.  The mugs are brought to the bar already frozen, so not even the bartender would know if the glass is dirty.  Maybe a little attention to cleanliness by the dish washers could help.  I will return for other items, but not for the quesadilla."

The food was ok, but the girls need better training, and way less makeup. It was like they were trying so hard, it came across as fake! 
For the prices, the portions weren&#39;t very big. Ie: 10 chips with the queso dip? Not much on the menu either.
The place is really cute, decor fun and many TV&#39;s. What I couldn&#39;t stand, were the way the waitstaff would come over and sit down with us. Excuse me, my spouse and I enjoying our conversation...we didn&#39;t need a 19 year old bimbo, boobs smashed up to her neck, draped in cheap jewelry, to sit down with us and ask us if the beer was cold enough. And I wasn&#39;t even drinking beer. 
I hope they make it because I never like to see a business fail...but we won&#39;t be back again."

There was more than enough room at the table for the 5 of us so great job hostess. Gotta say the talent here is top notch...10 times better than hooters or tilted kilt nearby. Truthfully I didn&#39;t know this restaurant was this type of bar but I didn&#39;t mind :)  I don&#39;t drink much and when I do, it&#39;s usually a Foo Foo drink. I got the Stout Colada  beer and it was delicious.  We all liked our food. We got double cheeseburger, Philly cheese steak, and skirt steak. Klaudia was a good waitress although she missed our drink orders a couple times but no biggie. It was kinda funny though...she asked one of my friends if he wanted a refill on his Angry Orchard and he said yes. 10 minutes after he still didn&#39;t get a refill and she came by and and asked him if he wanted a refill again...oh well she was nice so we weren&#39;t complaining but we made a joke about it.  If you get fries, make sure you ask for ketchup and look at the bottle :)  ton of tvs so definitely good for watching the NCAA tourney.  Prices weren&#39;t bad.  Nice place and we&#39;ll be back.

Been here a few times and enjoy watching them bring out the shot ski...SHOT SKI SHOT SKI!!!  The servers are fun especially if certain songs come on then you might experience a cool line dance!!  Plenty of seating and great outdoor patio seating!!!

Only issue is if you come in a small group.  Twice we&#39;ve had a group of 2-3 and the servers tend to gravitate toward the larger groups/tables to work their tips, which is understandable, but don&#39;t forget your other groups.  Had two trips where it took 25 minutes to get a drink for someone in our group who arrived late and then 20 minutes to get our check because we couldn&#39;t get any service.  Another trip was on a slower night and the server forgot to put in a food order...just something you can&#39;t overlook.

Hopefully they have a talk with the servers and get them straightened out."

I&#39;m going to preface this by saying that I was not expecting a fine dining service experience. That being said...I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO Twin Peaks in Warrenville, IL. The only good thing there was the cold beer and decent food. So...It is Saturday afternoon, not too busy at all (7 tables sat and 3/4 full bar). First, they were out of the 2 draft beers that I wanted, nice job GM. Second, it took 10 minutes to get us 3 beer...again, not busy at all. Third, it took 20+ minutes for the waitress, Breanna i think, to take our order. Fourth, multiple times the manager, and waitress were in the kitchen f&#39;in around and texting on their phones and there were 2 waitress sitting on the expo area. Fifth, we were waiting 15 minutes for our waitress to come take our payment and I finally had to ask the host to tell our server to stop texting and come get our payment. Sixth, I asked to speak to the manager, he came over and we were talking and the waitress comes over and starts arguing with me at the table. Finally, after talking to the manager and GM, we were walking out and the waitress is waiting at the host stand and gives us bitchy and condescending goodbyes and remarks. I am so tired of shitty service...why is it widely acceptable to be on your cell phone as a server or bartender and not attend to your customer. Why is it so hard to be able to go out and get good service at a restaurant in the burbs. Utterly Ridiculous!!!"

I had the trout and it was good with the fresh mashed potatoes and some really good veggies.  My husband had the fish tacos and said they were really good.  The best thing my husband said was the COLDEST of beers in a frosted glass.  Jason was the Manager and was very attentive towards our needs.

If I ever decided to go back it would only be for her service. My suggestion is to clean house and have her manage the training.

The signs on restroom doors &#34; sit to P&#34; and &#34;stand to P&#34; made me chuckle. One note on restrooms---why aren&#39;t the stall doors flush to the frame? Not a comfortable sight when you walk in restroom. 

Food tasted good but was over priced for what you got, not a value. Beer was $4.75 for Miller Lite, not a value. The beer temp meter is great, it&#39;s fun to see it getting colder. We actually ordered our rounds based on temp--&#34;we will buy when it gets under 27 degrees&#34;. I was surprised for all the marketing around 29 degree beer how often the temp was over 31 degrees.

The kicker was over hearing the conversation she had with the table next to us about taking oxy and how she has a birth control implant in her arm---how does that come up while waiting on the table? It was enough to get us to pay and go. Maybe if we saw a manger at anytime of our visit, the staff would have been more attentive. 

Overall it&#39;s average, if in the area, I might go back but wouldn&#39;t make any more special trips to go there."

The temperature dropped and my friends asked if they would turn on outside heaters. If they couldn&#39;t no big deal but the manager came out to us with an attitude. Pretty much called us liars when we said they hadn&#39;t been turned on all night and left us with a bad taste in our mouth...other than the food. The women seem bullied by male staff and are forced to be rated before each shift(according to our waitress) the drink list was short compared to other breastraunts...if you want to see hot girls without the uncomfortable staff and crappy food go to tilted or hooters...twin peaks is a downward slope of nastiness...

We arrived around 5pm when the pub was not very busy. None of us were carded at the table even though we were all 21+. We ordered a sampler appetizer platter and received dirty app plates. Had to ask for new ones from a server that was not ours and by the time we got new CLEAN plates we were done with the platter. One of my friends with me ordered the fried steak and the server asked how he wanted his steak cooked and he replied medium. About ten mins later another server (not ours) let us know that our server messed up and the steak could only be made well done. He said he would try it anyways because he was hungry. He received the fried well done steak and didn&#39;t like it so sent it back immediately, he ordered something else instead. All four of us were done eating by the time he received his new order. The new order he loved but ate alone. The manager came over to talk to us because we asked (the sever never asked if would like to speak to a manager after the issue and the manager didn&#39;t take the initiative to come on his own when he realized he had to make a comp at our table) he was not friendly by any means with no professional manner. He did try to fix the situation by comping some items. He never once came back to check on us later throughout our visit to see if everything else was fine but instead pulled the originally server that we started with (that had no menu knowledge) and just gave us a new server who knew what she was doing, The manager never even came over to tell us he was switching out our server either.  The new server I believe her name was Bambi, she was the server that our original server kept pulling over to answer our menu questions in the first place, she completely turned out experience around! It was my birthday and all I wanted to do was have a good time and Bambi definitely made that happen for the second part of our visit. I would suggest her as your server if you want to get the best experience, She was very knowledgeable about the entire menu and picked up the slack of the manager that was on duty last night. Overall the food was decent but the cheese bites were DELICIOUS! The girl that was running our drinks to the table was also very rude to us and it didn&#39;t help that it took 10-20mins per drink to get delivered. I know that it is a new restaurant but the first server and our second server, Bambi, gave us two completely different vibes for my birthday celebration. Our plan was to stay longer there and drink but with the delay on actually getting the drinks to our table was kind of a buzz kill so we decided to go else where to finish celebrating. I think the servers should be tested on their menu knowledge before actually taking tables on the floor so other tables do not experience what we did. There was a party that walked in with children under the age of 10 years old while we were leaving and the staff dances &#34;twerks&#34; every hour in the middle of the floor, kid friendly environment??? I would use your best judgement when bringing your younger children into this establishment. 

I was going to rate this place a &#34;1 Star&#34; based on our experience but the only reason that I gave this place &#34;2 stars&#34; is because the amount of effort our second server put into our table to make sure she turned our visit around. 

Probably not returning and if we do maybe a year from now so that all staff knows what is going on."

In fairness, I would much rather come here than a Tilted Kilt. The TV selection and overall restaurant atmosphere is superior. The food is also better. 
I would like to see some form of beer special. 5 bucks for a miller lite is a bit pricey compared to Hooters, BDubs, and The Kilt. 
Unfortunately, my worst experience came in my last visit when my waitress was complaining about her tips from previous tables. She sat down and told my table, &#34;if you tipping less than 20% you ain&#39;t never worked in the service industry or you just plain cheap.&#34; I thought that was a but inappropriate for a waitress to tell her customers...this was in the first 10 min that we were there. 
So overall, great TVs, please get a beer special at some point, decent food, and teach your waitresses that this is a restaurant and not some strip club in N/W Indiana. 
Thank you."

Young women in provocative outfits fawning over the customers with no shame.  It is like a glorified strip club disguised as a sports bar &amp; grille.  There were literally 25 young women making their rounds around the restaurant sidling up to the customers for various small talk, every time I turned around there was a woman in my face!  It&#39;s too bad because it looked like a nice place with several big screens for sports and decent food, but I don&#39;t go to sports bars to be continuously confronted by scantily-clad young women for conversation.

We arrived around 8:45. Karaoke was due to start around 10:00pm when the Hawks game was over.  Mullens is an official Blackhawk bar so don&#39;t come in here to cheer for the Dallas Stars lol.
TONS of TV&#39;s with multiple games showing. 
We sat ourselves in the bar area. Greeted promptly and served quickly, with a great attitude. 
When we arrived it was not too crowded but as it got closer to 10 filled up quickly. Once the DJ set up, the line formed and the list grew to about 20+ singers.  If your looking to sing multiple times forget it. Not a bad thing though. The DJ Wayne &#34;The Wayniac Show&#34; was excellent at being fair and not allowing sign ups under friends to sing more frequently.
The crowd age average seemed to be &#39;22-25&#39; or college age with some of us older folks sprinkled in.
We ordered food later which was good.  The brisket nachos were huge and good. The cheese curds were typical as well as the pretzel with cheese. We also got the Reuben and it was good as well. 
Overall it was a good fun night, good service, good food, fun crowd and atmosphere.
Food - typical bar food average. 
Service - slightly above average.

It&#39;s popular because it&#39;s right off Warrenville Rd by a bunch of major offices like Navistar. I wouldn&#39;t come back here unless my coworkers wanted to go again. 

The inside is pretty spacious. They have a big open space for late night dancing, and a small stage for a band. I can see how the night life might be fun.

However, the food is really NOT GOOD. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been to a restaurant where I&#39;ve had food that&#39;s more bland. I had the corned beef and cabbage plate. Seriously; couldn&#39;t you at least add some salt and pepper to the meals? 

Also, service was pretty awful. We were there for an hour and a half for lunch, which is wayyyyy too long for a lunch hour. The waitress rarely came by, and we all had empty water glasses for a while.

Had the pulled pork sliders. Very good. A little coleslaw, ala memphis style, would have put it over the top. Wings were good as well. Well done with combo buffalo sauce and terriyake.  Nice touch.

First off, the place was dead so that should have been a hint. The whole restaurant smelled like mold. It was sticky and cold and just felt so gross. We were hungry so we stayed. It wasn&#39;t until I went into the bathroom that I literally threw up from the smell. It smells like someone took a dump and rubbed it on the walls.. and what do I see when I walk in the first stall? CRAP smeared on the walls! I was disgusted and I immediately told the hostess and her lack of caring made me want to run out of that place ASAP. I will NEVER step foot back in this place again.

The atmosphere overall is really good. The servers are decent and the management overall is O.K., nothing too stellar. I&#39;ve tried a variety of their foods here and overall, I think their wings are pretty good which are half off on Weds during trivia night (you can try the bourbon sriracha flavor which is not listed on the menu), their pretzel app is pretty standard, the meatball app is pretty good too, the quesadillas are well made, but the killer is that their nachos are not that good. Wide selection of beers as well.

However, I do have one terrible memory at this place. This happened when they advertised a Two Brothers Brewing event at Mullens for a specific date (listed on all posters). And it was listed for a Monday, which I thought was weird. So I ended up calling Mullens the next day to confirm the event, which they did and said the date was correct. So I gathered a group of friends to come out and take part, but upon arriving, I was informed that the event had already happened on a previous Friday... Even though the posters said it was Monday and I had called to confirm. Heart breaking. I ended up speaking to the manager who ultimately offered me and my friends free Two Brothers Bumper Stickers that they passed out during the free event anyway. 

Overall, nothing to die for here. Food is decent and all and its a nice atmosphere and a unique location. But due to the occasional subpar service, I have to get it 3/5."

We came here on a Sunday night because we heard of their patio and the great $1.50 burger special. 

Our first clue into how this was going to turn out was the fact that all the guests on the patio only had drinks and no food! It was not crowded nor did it seem to be understaffed. Yet it took ONE HOUR to be served 3 burgers, 1 salad and 1 wrap. When we asked where our food was, the only answer we heard was &#34;I had a big party before you, it&#39;s coming!&#34; Never, an &#34;I&#39;m sorry can I get you anything while you wait.&#34; At the 45 minute mark, we approached the &#34;manager&#34;, who was less than concerned and had zero sense of urgency.
 
Food finally arrived. The burgers were good. The wrap was plentiful, but the MULLEN&#39;S BLEU CANDIED WALNUT salad was pitiful... only anemic iceberg lettuce, and barely a tsp of walnuts and cranberries. Not too mention the order of the famous &#34;Mullen&#39;s applesauce&#34; never appeared.

As were we leaving the manager, (literally) dropped a bag of the applesauce on our table as an attempt to make right. It was a very poor and half-hearted attempt. To top it all off the applesauce was EXPIRED.

We all have restaurant experience so we understand things happen, but there was never a genuine attempt to make things right or give us a reason to come back.

I wonder if Jim Mullen even know&#39;s this place uses his name. If he did, I would hope he would have a much better sense of quality control."

First of all, we walked in and picked out a booth to sit at. It was well over five minutes before a waitress finally approached our table. She was nice (I&#39;ve forgotten her name) and was quick to bring us our drinks and take our order. 

The Bloody Mary&#39;s were good but you can get bigger ones for much cheaper elsewhere. They do come with a shot of Miller Lite; they call it the &#34;Hangover Helper.&#34; However, I was not hungover so I didn&#39;t drink the Miller Lite. Miller Lite is foul, anyway.

I ordered the &#34;Big Jim&#39;s Reuben&#34; and chose fries as my side. The bf got a &#34;Mullen&#39;s Wrap&#34; with tator tots. While it sounded good in theory, we were both disappointed with our choices. The bf took two bites of his wrap and refused to eat more. He said it was terrible, especially the chicken. I tasted a piece of chicken and agreed; it was dry and flavorless. He said it tasted like dog food. 

As far as the reuben goes, I was very disappointed. I&#39;ve had a better Reuben at Arby&#39;s. The corned beef tasted off and the sandwich was entirely too greasy for my liking. I only ate a quarter of it. The fries were lukewarm at best. Some were burnt and others were soggy and undercooked.

We managed to have our waitress take the bf&#39;s meal off our check. Now I wish we would have done the same with mine. I brought home leftovers but I honestly doubt I&#39;ll eat them, as my stomach is unbearably upset right now. The only decent food we had was the Spinach Artichoke Dip appetizer, but it wasn&#39;t the greatest Spinach Artichoke dip we&#39;ve ever had and was almost $10 alone. No thanks.

As we left, the bf said &#34;Well, this place is off my list.&#34; I couldn&#39;t agree more. Obviously after living in the area for almost 18 years, there&#39;s a clear reason why I&#39;ve never been here up until recently. We won&#39;t be back."

We decided to try Mullen&#39;s due to Trivia night. Three of us ventured in and had to wait for our fourth so we ordered drinks and an app. The nachos were head scratchingly covered with TONS of iceberg finely shredded. Seriously, the biggest mound of shredded lettuce I have EVER seen. My husband loves all things nacho and on the way home he was actually listing ways Mullen&#39;s could have &#34;Irished&#34; it up and made some really killer nachos. While they tasted OK, there just wasn&#39;t much to it beside some soggy chips and lots and lots of lettuce. 

Our fourth arrived just as Trivia was starting, at this point we had only seen our waitress maybe 2 times. She didn&#39;t seem terribly busy, just very distracted. She was perfectly pleasant when we did see her but it was so far and few that we actually wondered if she left at one point, or at least I did because I kind of notice these things. AND, to be fair, it doesn&#39;t really take much to please me when I am dining out. I don&#39;t need a ton of attention, so I really can&#39;t complain because she was nice but she did screw up our bill. We didn&#39;t say anything because we were amongst friends and we just worked it out...but still....

WE all ordered pretty straightforward stuff: Steak Sandwich, O Patty Melt, and two of us ordered the Beef Short Rib Sandwich. I usually like to copy the descriptions straight from the website, but I can only see the apps.....strange.

Not one of us mentioned our food as we were eating it, except to say that we loved the tater tots. Guys....the tater tots were awesome! Crisp on the outside and perfectly cooked in the middle with just the right amount of salt and pepper.

Our craft beer enthusiast friend seemed ok with the choices of beer, but I know other places have a better selection. The rest of us ordered soft drinks and or Arnold Palmer&#39;s so.....those were fine.

I wouldn&#39;t dissuade you from going to Mullens, truly, it is a nice place with ok food. BUT....but...with Warren&#39;s Ale House just a hop skip and a jump away I struggled with what to share. Mullens Trivia night was fun but the food was just ok. I would go back for Trivia and maybe for another app but I think I will eat at Warren&#39;s ahead of time.

We were at a wedding ceremony up the road and had almost 4 hours to kill before the reception at Danada House.  We walked into Mullen&#39;s at 3pm on a Saturday to find a very friendly and accommodating woman at the front desk.  I told her we may be having lots of people showing up to kill time and she suggested we reserve a few tables, but then realized the entire back Pool Room was unoccupied and a party wasn&#39;t supposed to arrive until 8pm, so it could be all ours til 6pm!  I texted the Bride and MoB and let them know we had plenty of space, EVERYONE can come!  

The girl who helped me got a hold of our very own waiter, JoHn.  JoHn was AWESOME.  So nice and ready to serve, he came with suggestions on food, took separate CC for all tables and handled our group of about 40 or so with no problem!  He was super attentive and professional and personable.  We really appreciated his service and wanted him to know it.  I told JoHn he&#39;d be all bells and whistles on YELP.  Hi JoHn!

This was really great of them and I appreciate it! The customer service outreach really was fantastic and made me feel appreciated as a customer.

We went for dinner and things went really well. The food was made well and quite tasty. The service was really friendly and on-top of everything. It was fairly busy but our refills were timely and our server was pretty much constantly available. The staff as a whole were friendly and made faces at our 2 year old to make her laugh.

My wife and I were both very impressed!

Based on the dinner and the customer outreach I would have re-rated Mullen&#39;s from a two-star review up to a four-star review but I thought we would wait until after also doing lunch just to give it a good and well-rounded review.

We went on a slow day for lunch, with very few other people in the restaurant, which was surprising since it was right around lunch time and with all the businesses in the area we expected it to be pretty full.

Well, the food was good and I definitely suggest giving the wings a try for lunch; they&#39;re really tasty! My wife enjoyed her burger and my daughter ate most of her cheese quesadilla with tater tots, which is a true endorsement from a two year old!

But again, it was slow. Surprisingly so since it was so empty. The wait staff was all friendly and willing to help us out if we needed it. They weren&#39;t rude so much as they weren&#39;t really available. Refills didn&#39;t show up, check-backs on the food weren&#39;t done, and I had to ask for our check 10 minutes after we&#39;d finished (my wife had even taken my daughter out for a walk at that point since the little one had gotten a bit restless by then).

We&#39;ll definitely be going back. The customer service was great and when you order the right thing (not the fish and chips, essentially) the food is decent. With this being so accessible (we live just down the street) I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll go grab dinner there again some time!

For lunch, though, we&#39;d rather drive a little farther away and save a little time.

I think, too, that our family isn&#39;t exactly what the restaurant is looking for. It&#39;s probably a great sports bar if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for, whereas we were looking for a great restaurant. It&#39;s a good restaurant. Just not great."

As for the ambiance, it&#39;s a great place to watch a game, there are plenty of TV&#39;s everywhere.  It&#39;s in a convenient location where there are not a whole lot of other restaurants, and during the summer their outdoor area is a good size (if not set up a bit awkwardly).

I would (and do) come here again, and would suggest it to others as well."

The drinks are okay, but unpredictable. Sometimes a little weak, sometimes they&#39;ll knock you over. I don&#39;t often drink when I&#39;m here, because I&#39;m usually here with coworkers and alas, I like being employed, but the times I have, it&#39;s been underwhelming.

Last time I was there, I got a Mediterranean salad that was ok, but my colleague got potato skins that looked like little brown grease boats.

The food was all around bad. Tough pork chops, bad fish and chips, and the menu was limited to anything that you can make from Sysco truck ingredients. No malt vinegar for the fish and chips. A bar with an Irish name that serves fish and chips with no malt vinegar. That makes sense.

Being we are both musicians, he thought it might be a great idea to try out several of our songs from our new project, in front of an audience.  Wow, what a mistake.
First of all, I&#39;m not crazy about &#34;Open Mic Nights&#34;.  Truth is, there is no audience.  It is mostly musicians just waiting to get up on stage to play.  And they are really not interested in what you&#39;re playing, they are just interested in their own music.
And, there is always a clique, always.  There are always a group of regulars there, who think they&#39;re the best, and they really don&#39;t want anyone else to show them up.  Believe me, Mullen&#39;s was no exception.
Don&#39;t get me wrong, Mullen&#39;s has a really nice stage, and a great, great, sound guy.  He was probably the most experienced and accommodating.  
We sat and listened, (and suffered ), through several acts.  Even though some of the acts were downright terrible, everyone had ample respect for the musicians; listening and clapping.  That is, until we got on stage.  Once we got on stage, the clique decided to talk as loud as possible, obviously not treating us with the same respect they did everyone else.  It was completely horrible.  They even got louder as the music progressed and escalated, obviously trying to undermine us, and the music.  It was absolutely the most rude and disrespectful behavior I have ever seen at an &#34;Open Mic&#34;. 
Needless to say, if you are a musician, DO NOT EVEN BOTHER WITH MULLEN&#34;S.  What a complete waste of time, unless of course, you are part of the Mullen&#39;s clique of Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, and American Idol wannabes!
And trust me, you would be much better off with a drive in the country, setting up in a cornfield, and playing your music out there.  It would be much more liberating, and definitely much more appreciated!"

Let&#39;s rewind this a few clicks and get to the real source of our nacho infatuation. Mullen&#39;s. A friend and I met up for a casual drink to catch up and drink up. The oh so typical standard. When she picked Mullen&#39;s, I honestly had no clue where it was. Mistake Numero Uno.

Parked right off of I-88, it&#39;s a perfect hub for a relaxed pint or a full on after-hour cocktail. It&#39;s sort of a bar where anything goes. From the wooden booths to the plentiful bar tables scattered throughout, there&#39;s an assortment of places to set your pretty booty down and get comfortable with the likes of everyone else in the neighborhood. From suits to jeans, beers to shots...are you ready?

We stuck it out for the night and had beer, but what sold me...was the Pot Roast Nachos. Did that come out right? Nachos with pot roast meat instead of chicken? Oh yes, that is very right. 

A hugely different take on a bar staple, this is a serious MUST if you are planning on getting pub grub while filling your neighbor in on a work schedule or bitching about your floor smelling like cat pee. 

In all fairness, the menu had a whole long list of foodies that sounded pretty great and filling but I&#39;m going to come right on out and say that this will forever be my local hub for getting nachos in Naperville. Okay, technically it&#39;s Lisle...but whatever.

All.Of.Naperville.

Well done, Mullen&#39;s. You scored big-time with the pot roast nachos and uber relaxed place to slink away for a cheap drink."

Obviously not a seasoned bartender! Then later shift came on about 4:30pm and I got a decent drink in the correct glass. Had wings that were OK..typical bar wings. Prices high for the food. Artichoke dip app is $10?? Waiter was very attentive but no personality and don&#39;t think he spoke much English either.

After unsuccessfully trying to go elsewhere and finding it closed at 10pm on a Saturday we came to Mullen&#39;s due to it&#39;s proximity to our hotel.

We sat at the bar and got some drinks which were either flat (the Shiner Bock on special) or in my opinion over priced (I&#39;m at a dive in the suburbs, come-on!)

The food was below average bar food.  I got a burger with mushrooms, onions and blue cheese.  Way to much blue cheese on the there.  Also I am not a fan of frozen, pre-made burger patties but I was super hunger and it was food.  The bbq chips did not taste fresh and were over loaded with spice.

The service was just ok, we had to wait a bit and ask for the check and also had to flag someone down to ask for waters.

There was a man with a guitar playing all of my favorite songs with a decent voice, so that was a plus.

Sadly if you are in the area, you just might not have any other options!  Not the worst, I just would go in with low expectations and maybe you will be surprised!"

We went on Saturday night to catch an eagles cover band. I had reserved a table over the phone with Steve. Super nice. He was super helpful too. I had asked him about the view, the crowd, if there was dancing, etc. I think I probably talked to him about three separate times regarding our reservation.  

The beer was really really cheap. My husband could not believe the bill when it came. They were having specials on Dos Equis and the Blue Moon girls were there.  I had a couple of the pom margaritas.  Those were awesome. We also ordered 2 dozen wings.  Oddly enough though the cheesy garlic wings were a heck of a lot spicier than the &#34;shock and awe&#34; ones were.

What upsets me about people complaining about bad service is that there is a trick. I have never had bad service here and I never will. When the waitress comes to your table and asks what you would like to drink. After giving your order, ask what there name is. Strike up a bit of a conversation. I guarantee the service will be much better.

So about the place. Drinks are a bit expensive. Food is really pretty good for the average sports bar. Burgers are very good but the best sandwich is the Pittsburgh Cheesesteak. Granted I have not had an original Philly cheesesteak sandwich but if it better than this it must be fantastic.

They have a huge room where you can have parties. They do a pretty good job in that area.

There is also a separate area for families to sit.

They have bands on the weekends."

The reason I go to Mullen&#39;s is because a group I belong to meets there on occasion for dinner meetings. We usually have a group of 15 to 25 people and have the back room reserved. The room has a projection screen and PC Projector that can be connected to a laptop for presentations. The room also has two folding doors that can be closed to block out the noise from the restaurant / bar area. And believe me, it seems to get very loud at times.

The service has always been good for our group. Serving a group of 15 to 25 people is a task in itself. Kudos to the servers who have to keep everything straight. Sometimes we only have one server.

For our last group meeting, our organizer said in order to reserve the meeting room we had to had to commit to a menu and a room charge (instead of ordering individually like we use to do). No real biggie with the change, just good info to know for future reference.

So, Mullen&#39;s may be an okay place to go for a group meet up, but not so much for the food."

The food is standard bar food, but not my favorite. Really, the only reason I come here is to meet up with a group of friends who frequent the place.

On my most recent visit, the first guy at the bar (looked like a manager) had NO clue what the specials were, even though he offered to get my drink. The female bartender relieved him  and took my order. I paid my tab right away, as I was meeting up with friends. 

We were placed in the back room, where there was (sort of?) a private party going on. They were clearing the buffet, but a meeting was still going on. I felt intrusive to say the least. But we persevered. 

The server was slow, and MIA when she was needed. She was nice enough, but disappeared after half our table had departed, so we waited for 10 minutes after asking a busser to send her out(10 minutes more than when we started looking for her). 

As far as food, it&#39;s ok. I had the app sampler and it came out mostly cold. The mozz sticks were not gooey at all; the onion rings were caked in cooled oil (bleck); the buff chicken tenders were pretty good albeit tiny; the southwest egg rolls were (actually quite decent) the best thing on the platter. Some of my pals had tater tots, which were overcooked for sure.

I&#39;ll tell you how:

Went in there last night after driving all the way down there to eat at Mapo, which you should check out. Just to down a few beers and then make my way back east. The waiter was kind of weird, he seemed pretty nice but the females in our party thought he was a little too touchy feely. Sure, that&#39;s a little weird but also they&#39;re a little FOBby so they might just be overly sensitive. 

It took 10 minutes for me to get my first beer. The place wasn&#39;t busy since Sunday Night Football was winding down, maybe 3 other tables besides ours. Granted there was a martini order but 10 minutes? I shook my head at a missed field goal kick and the waiter apologized for being so late with the drinks. Also, there were some fans there and they were just way too loud for a suburban crowd, why do they yell loudly when there are 25 people in a bar? It just makes you look like an a-hole, especially when you&#39;re by yourself and no one is cheering with you."

This place has a surprisingly broad menu; in addition to the standard pub/grill food, they have choices like hummus, individual pizzas, and a veggie wrap that includes rice, wild rice, and some spices I couldn&#39;t identify.  If you have a vegetarian in your group, they&#39;ll dance a jig and not having to order the nachos or the quesadilla!

Lots of parking, large outdoor seating area.  Standard pub-type decor, stained glass (but no &#34;flair,&#34; so there aren&#39;t bizarre things stapled to the walls), flat TVs mounted to the walls.  Darkish.  

It&#39;s hard to hear your dinner companions, and we were a group.  Which is where the trouble started.  Our waitress had been working there two weeks and was totally unprepared for a group of 12 (which mushroomed to 17).  We&#39;d been told separate checks was OK; she seemed unclear on the concept, and insisted on actually collecting credit cards to be sure no one walked out on her.  And of course she confused our orders (couldn&#39;t remember how many beers people had; may have added one extra; missed an onion rings for fries substitution after verbally confirming it).  One guy never got his beer and ended up drinking someone else&#39;s.

She then had to have us rewrite our order, and then completely recalculate our ticket.  At which point she needed to ask everyone whose was whose as she hadn&#39;t written down names and couldn&#39;t match the orders to the credit cards.

The guy who ordered one beer had to argue with her to pay his $2.50 and leave.  The rest of us waited 20 minutes while she did the math, then came back with our tickets.

For groups, the restaurant adds an automatic gratuity, and while we paid it, I&#39;d be very surprised if any of us added to it.  It&#39;s a shame; it was a nice place and it could have been a good experience."

Although the &#34;Shock and Awe&#34; were my personal favorite, I found all varieties to be FABULOUS.  The Bloody Marys were nothing to sneeze at - ALMOST as good as Murphy&#39;s (but not quite).  I was super impressed.  For my meal?  I went with the Italian Beef sandwich (please note:  I did a long marathon training run the day before so I am not a complete fatty-boom-batty).

Now it wasn&#39;t a cover charge, because initially I just walked in and the guy checked my ID - and i didn&#39;t get a wrist band.  The group I was with asked what I was getting for my &#34;free&#34; drink, and that&#39;s when I went back.... should of never listened to them.

I have visited several other Mullen&#39;s in Chicago (and it&#39;s strange how every one has a different personality dependng on where it sits.!) This was a relaxed, chill vibe like you might expect being out in the sticks, with a handful of people taking advantage of the bags on the patio. 

I was very happy to learn that Monday is half-price pint night and I proceeded to take a tour of an impressive number of the 20 brews they have on tap. 

I always order wings, no matter what Mullen&#39;s I go to because that&#39;s what you do. If you want variety, that&#39;s what the umpteen sauce choices are for. And of course TOTS. I want to see them work those tots a little more. What about some nacho tots?

When a server makes a mistake or the food is mediocre, I&#39;ll shrug it off and assume maybe an off night. This was, hands down, the worst dining experience I&#39;ve ever had. Just God awful and I&#39;m embarrassed I brought my in-laws to this place.

First - the service was terrible. Our two servers  were more concerned with making sure the table behind us had working controllers for the bar game then providing accurate drink orders which we&#39;re served in very slow intervals and often delivered to the wrong person. We were there for 2/2:30 hours - we literally saw the opening pitch of the White Sox game and saw the game concluded before the check was dropped. We weren&#39;t even greeted for 20 minutes after sitting down - 40 minutes to bring out 2 appetizers - buffalo wings. Drink orders were late and wrong and entrees came out after 1:30 of sitting there. 

Second - the quality of food was awful. Martinis were small and again, paaaainfully long to get. We order 312&#39;s, the special, she shows up with Miller Lights and gives us an explanation about how she can discern which beer it is by the look and those were definitely 312&#39;s. They weren&#39;t. My sister&#39;s burger was raw, my other sister&#39;s meatloaf was inedible and the mashed potatoes that came with had the taste of powdered mashed potatoes. Fiance&#39;s burger was burned and the fries - yikes. 

The front desk sat us in the bar - which wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing - if not for the blaring 90&#39;s rock played and birthday party behind us. Not at all what I had in mind for entertaining the in-laws and I&#39;m sorely embarrassed I made them sit through that exercise in patience. 

My biggest regret was not leaving after waiting 20 minutes after the first round - we would have gone to any other restaurant in Naperville. My second regret was not getting the manager - I didn&#39;t want to make a scene in front of my family but I&#39;ll never be back. Never. 

If you like this place - more power to you. If anyone ever asks me where to eat in Naperville - I shall always end my recommendation with &#39;whatever you do, do not go to Mullen&#39;s&#39;. 

To the staff at Mullen&#39;s - man - you guys have ways to go espcially judging by the other reviews (which also cite the slow service). You need to better educate your servers and run your restaurant much faster. And honestly, tell your hostess to not flirt with the bouncer as paying customers leave instead of saying &#39;thanks!&#39; or &#39;have a good night&#39;."

Mullen&#39;s (named after Jim Mullen&#39;s, the Rogers Park cop who was injured in the line of duty back in 1996- I think he is a family friend of the owner) serves some typical bar food along with the likes of pasta, meatloaf and steaks.

We were in the private party room which was really something.  For $50 you can rent a room with two pool tables, two dartboards and a fireplace and have food served to you at the tables or in a buffet line.  It would be a great place for a work outing or other private event.

The service was great- they had easily 4 of the nicest servers waiting on us- running to get our drinks from the main bar area and alerting us to when new food was out (appetizers, entrees and dessert).  There was also an attentive bus boy  who seemed to be invisible until you put your plate down and then it was quickly whisked away.

In addition to the room we were in, they have a number of other dining rooms, an outside patio area for al fresco dining as well as a spacious bar that has live music on Saturday&#39;s.

In reading some of the other reviews- it looks like this place has found it&#39;s service legs and the problems that others have mentioned have gone away.

For those of you city dwellers- Mullen&#39;s has two other locations that will save you from packing an overnight bag to visit them- the original Rogers Park location on Western, and the Wrigleyville location on Clark."

We don&#39;t often go out of our way to provide positive comments to management but we found the manager that night and talked about the great service.

I&#39;ve been here plenty of times for lunch and dinner. The interior is typical &#34;Irish&#34; sports pub (considering it was a Mexican restaurant long, long ago, that&#39;s no small task), but clean. They have a gas fireplace going during the winter, which is a nice touch. There&#39;s also a dining patio with a dozen tables.

Food is above average for a sports bar, both in taste and quality. I&#39;m partial to the bbq pork, buffalo chicken, ruben, and Mullen&#39;s club. The fish and chips is usually good, and the pizzas, surprisingly, have been uniformly good. Side salad is definitely above average and a decent size. Beer selection is ok, and the monthly beer special is usually something above average (i.e., not Bud Light) at a small discount. 

Most of the service staff seems to turn over with some frequency. However, there are some who have been there for a number of years, and it&#39;s common to see the manager out on the floor checking on guests. Service is usually good, dipping to average once in awhile, but always friendly."

That expectation was not reached. 

The party had sat down at the bar and got one of the best bartenders we&#39;ve had in ages. I can not speak any ill to her at all. Katrinia, the Russian pianist and all, was fabulous. Quipping back to us as well as adding delightful insight to general ridiculousness that we were discussing. And a looker. 

At the bar, after you&#39;ve sat there long enough, you notice little things. Like waitstaff coming by you and making the effort to introduce themselves to you and nodding even afterwards and making eye contact with you. The other bar&#39;ers are rad as well. From an enthusiastic saracstic dick named Dave to an owner of a logistics firm that will goad you about why the White Sox suck (I guess this area is a Cubs hotbed?) to making comments about how bad your unwashed body smells and your overall appearance.

Katrinia, the doll face, helped this guy out. We started off with some stellar Goose Island Matilda that packed a punch that knocked out your shoes and 8 bucks from your wallet. Bbbbut! She&#39;ll help you out by asking her manager if you can snaggle some Stella glasses and other freebies. I guess that&#39;s what you get when you sit at the bar for a solid 7 hours. 

I would go to this bar every weekend if it was closer. And I had more money. But, Sundays are fundays. 25 cent wings, no matter how horrible they may be, are a solid pick up.

First, this restaurant is located in the food court area of the International Mall.  Even though I live quite near this area, I hadn&#39;t ever gone in, but surprised to see it&#39;s quite popular among the East Asian population, especially on the weekends.

We went on a weekend for lunch.  Service was very friendly and despite being cafeteria style seating, our food was delivered to our table.  Food was placed in nice china and the presentation and plating was beautiful.  We ordered bulgogi, vegetable pancake, and sides of kimchi.  The food can be described as modern, clean, and traditional with a twist.  The bulgogi was beef and was very tender and marinated to perfection.  It was topped by apple, sesame seeds, and watercress (I believe).  Just a lovely combination of flavors and very sophisticated.  The vegetable scallion pancake was also tasty, served with a soy sauce mixture.  Kimchi was great, and we were served both traditional cabbage kimchi as well as the daikon kimchi.   

The prices for these dishes was a very good value.  You&#39;d be paying double for not even that great food at other Korean establishments in the city.  

The food is actually too good for the venue it is in, in my opinion.  Hopefully, with continued success they can expand and maybe even establish a bigger niche for their delicious creations.  Unfortunately, it seems many people in the suburbs don&#39;t like trying new things (i.e. old white people) and that&#39;s why the restaurants suck so much in the suburbs versus only a few miles away in Chicago.  Hanbun is definitely the exception!

Great job!  I&#39;ll be back to try some new dishes and definitely will be carrying out for lunch too."

The two in the know parked up in the longest queue which serves up authentic Taiwanese breakfast so I let them do their thing knowing I would be the lucky beneficiary of their reliable decisions.

I chose Hanbun looking for Bibimbap and Vegetable pancake both which delivered to great tummy success.  The bibimbap came with chicken and was good but not all that hot, still quite tasty.  The vegetable pancake was outstanding as was the accompanying tangy soy dipping sauce!

Check it out, will not disappoint."

They are 4 or 5 other restaurants in this development.  They are similar to the restaurants in Assi &amp; Super H.  Hanbun is a tiny little restaurant smack dab in the middle.  They have 9 dishes to select from so it shouldn&#39;t be too hard to select an item, 

They have very limited hours from 11-3 (lunch time).  Evidently they do other food services in the evening, but don&#39;t have the hours listed so I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s open to the public.

I had the jjajangmyun which is a Korean &amp; Chinese style noodle with black beans, pork belly (pork fat? Not much meat) and seasoned vegetables.  The flavoring was some type of soy sauce.  I later added a spicy sauce to the dish and mixed it in.  This made the food much tastier.  

I wanted to try the bulgogi but they were all out.  Hanbun is a very small restaurant.  Jennifer was very friendly and very helpful telling us about the different dishes available.  I can&#39;t wait to go back and try some of their other dishes"

Here&#39;s what you should know:

-  it&#39;s inside the international mall.  It was hard to find, so park in front of the mall and it&#39;s on the first floor.

-  it&#39;s like a cafeteria inside.  The first floor of the mall is mainly just food and reflexology. May not make a difference, but it is surrounded by about 4 other food places.  

-  compared to the other food places, Hanbun looks the nicest.  The others don&#39;t really stand out as much

-  the menu is really easy, as they only have about 6 items.  Easy to see what they ha e and what you want

-  they are super nice.  The 2 ladies that were working were very helpful and both spoke very good English.  That helps because some of the other places aren&#39;t as helpful and don&#39;t speak great English

With limited Korean selections nearby, my lunch mates and I were excited to learn of this new addition. Four of us gathered and paid a visit on a random Wednesday afternoon for jjajjangmyun, pork buns, roasted rice cake with sweet chili sauce, and bibimbap. 

I had the jjajjangmyun which is a bowl of rod-shaped noodles with black bean sauce, pork belly, chives, and cucumber. Unlike the other jjajjangmyun that I&#39;ve had before, Hanbun&#39;s black bean sauce was much lighter in color and I wasn&#39;t sure if mine actually had black beans in them. The contents had a stronger soy sauce flavor instead. Also, the pork belly was mostly minced fat. Normally, I am a huge fan of pork fat but this one left me wondering if there were any lean meat at all.

With that said, this is a good start but I do anticipate some slight tweaks."

In this day and age where every new restaurant is all about the &#34;create your own&#34; phenomenon, and you have to concoct something with given ingredients, It&#39;s refreshing to run across a place that knows what they make well and your only job is to let your mouth savor the taste and for your stomach to rejoice. 

We started with the Toasted Rice Cake skewer: the texture was perfect, a slight crisp on the outside and perfectly chewy underneath.  The sweet chili glaze and puffed amaranth complement this to perfection.

The Korean pork bun with coffee scented pork was so tender and the steamed buns were perfectly made.  Usually with these types of pork buns, I just care about the meat is, but the white kimchi and scallions make the flavor profile really something else.

To top it off, we had the Korean Ramyun: the broth was very well flavored without being too watery or salty, a very nice balance and perfect texture to the noodles.

The owners were so nice and service was excellent.

We will definitely back to try every item on the menu and repeat the ones mentioned above.  Definitely a hidden gem and I&#39;m sure this place will be getting glowing press soon.

Also, the broth was smooth and full of flavor.  

As an addition, I ordered the pork belly bun and it was great.  They asked if I wanted a side of their personally created habanero sauce as an accompaniment.  I thought that would taste weird with pork belly, but accepted since the sauce was on the house.  It turned out to be just the right combination.  The owner/chef clearly has a progressive vision to his cuisine and it works.

Also, A+ for service.  The young woman at the counter was friendly, helpful and smiling.  Also, despite being a food court, she delivered my order to my table and came back later to see how I liked my meal.  Good restaurant service at food court prices.

I was traveling in the area with some friends and family. They all wanted to check out this new Asian cuisine place. I personally am not a big fan of Asian food. However, I always enjoy trying new things so I figured I&#39;d give it a shot. The location is warm, inviting and features thoughtfully crafted Korean food staples. A stand-out dish was their vegetable pancakes (vegan and gluten-free!). I&#39;m not even vegan but this dish was both surprising and delectable! The location has intriguing raymun and noodle combinations and boldly stands out against its competitors as artful. The other locations around them cater a bit more towards fast-food palettes. Each item I tasted at Hanbun had savory flavor and engaging texture. Service was hospitable and inviting. The location is casual and relaxing. When I am in the area again I&#39;m excited to return and try additional items. They just might make me a fan of Asian cuisine and push this up to an exemplary five star review. (Definitely getting more of those veggie pancakes)! 

The Food: (Score 4.5/5)
I got the Veggie Pancakes ($5.15) and Toasted Rice Cake Skewer ($2.25). The vegetable pancakes have a criss-cross mix of crunch and smooth veggie flavor. Spritz it with the soy sauce and this was a great winner in my book. The toasted rice skewer had a crisp texture on the outside along with a tangy sauce. Meanwhile the inside was chewy and full of flavor. I also tried a couple of other items such as the Black Bean Noodles from my family and they were delicious, but less memorable. Ultimately great food possibilities and I look forward to trying other dishes/sides when I return.

The Service: (Score 5/5)
The woman at the counter was smiling, engaging, and conversational. She went out of her way to provide for her customers. She walked out from behind the counter to each customer with a bright demeanor. The positive attitude and attention to detail were appreciated. 

The Location: (Score 4/5)
Tucked into the International Mall, Hanbun is smack dab in the center. You may not see it at first because you have to circle around the elevator. The stand is nestled in between many other Asian food stops. It&#39;s hard to rate the location of this Korean eatery because the dining area is the mall&#39;s responsibility rather than Hanbun&#39;s. The food stand itself stands out, but the mall&#39;s dining area is nothing fancy. All in all it&#39;s a fine casual place to relax and eat with friends or family. Clean tables, TVs are mounted on the walls, and bathrooms are kept up to standard. 

Conclusion: (Final Score 4.5/5)
Food with great texture and surprising flavors, service that goes above and beyond, and a casual family/friendly location. Right now they are only open until 3:00pm, but I hope that changes to include dinner in the near future. I look forward to returning when I am in the area. Wouldn&#39;t mind seeing experimentation with more vegetable options (my preferred taste), but for a place that is fresh and new they have some great &#34;modern&#34; ideas that pit them as worthwhile stop against the surrounding fast-food Asian kitchens. Check it out, definitely recommended."

Example: the Pork in the Korean pork buns  have a mild coffee scent and is paired with white kimchi and scallions which take it to a different level. The ramyun has a perfect poached egg which when broken adds an unctuous richness to the noodles and broth.

hanbun-westmont-2,Keenan C.,m0ABrqHNps5FrngNe8H-HA,"Highland, IN",0,1,0,0,6,U_w4d0jhdYYMRwyBiaIESw,5.0,2016-07-06,"As a disclaimer, I have very little experience with Korean food. I had some previous obligations that brought me to the Oak Brook area, and thought I might stop for lunch on the way. Based off of the previous reviews I had read on Yelp, I thought that I would give Hanbun a try. For individual dishes, other reviews may be more in tune with what you may be seeking. 

Service: I am not one to usually mention service, as I care far more about the food I am being served as to the manor in which it is presented to me. The only time I will usually make an exception to this, is if the service is above and beyond what is expected. I will say that the service there was incredible. The two individuals I spoke with were friendly and cordial. Those I worked with really gave me the feeling that they wanted me to enjoy their food. It felt as if I was dining at someone&#39;s home, and they were genuinely excited for me to enjoy their food. 

Food: I had ordered the vegetable pancake, 2 of the pork buns, and a rice skewer, all of which were fantastic. The value was absolutely insane. What I ordered could have fed both my wife and I, and I had spent a little over $15. The quality/freshness of ingredients were fantastic. Something that I would not commonly remark on is leftovers. I had an appointment and had to leave before I could finish, but the food was still fantastic when I had reheated it when I got home. While that may sound trivial, I find think is important to note because they do offer carryout services. 

Overall: This is one of those restaurants I want to keep as a secret, because I can bring people who have never been, and they can have that same sense of surprise that I had. If I would work close to the vicinity of this restaurant, my wife would soon divorce me as I would rapidly become obese, and she would find remnants of the rice skewers in my folds. Places like this become destinations, not just pass-by stop ins. Hanbun will quickly become a place I recommend to others."

I tried the crispy rice cakes, pork bun, vegetable pancakes, and jajangmyun. The crispy rice cakes were simple, but good. The pork bun was ok, the pork was a bit flavorless. The vegetable pancake was bland. The jajangmyun was a little bland with a slight sweetness. While none of the food was bad, it also was not as good as I was expecting after reading a rave review of them in the news paper. If you want good Korean food, there are many other places to go for much better flavor. The lady who took my order was very kind. The owner and his wife were busy fraternizing with a friend to even acknowledge anybody else around them. While I don&#39;t expect them to have a full conversation with me, a nice smile or hi would go a long way when you see somebody in line to order your food, instead of a blank stare right thru the person. Oh well... It was worth a try Han bun (one time)... I won&#39;t be trying to schedule the dinner that I tried to schedule last week anymore.

The only gripe might be menu is a bit limited but food far above the surrounding food court competition and on par with a restaurant though not that traditional Korean.  Or at least what I find in most Korean places ... To be clear really good food.  And don&#39;t be put off by the dead strip mall vibe from the entrance!

So to the food short rib Kalbi plate awesome and pairs well with salad and their rice/barley mixture.

Pork buns outstanding ... Just get it.

Like the veggie pancake though a bit indifferent to the rice &#34;tubes&#34; with chili sauce.  

 Soup/stew yummy though like most dishes might be a bit more heat than you might anticipate. 

The bimbibap (I can&#39;t spell it) very nice mix and like everything you can taste the fresh ingredients and thoght a spent on texture.

Also big fan of black bean noodle dish but I usually end up with Kalbi which I hear might be replaced by a Bulgogi ... But if good no problem!"

Disregard all the shill posts by the the owners&#39; friends.  All false.  The claims of &#39;authentic korean food&#39; this place most definitely is not.

I tried out their jjajangmyun (black bean sauce noodles) because I felt it would be a good judge of the stall&#39;s food.  
When I picked it up, I was a bit taken aback because: 
1. the bowl and amount of food was tiny for the price paid ($9) and 
2. I saw instant ramen noodles and
3. there was no banchan (sidedish).  Not even danmuji (yellow pickled radish; large pack costs few $) which is always paired with jjajangmyun.  I won&#39;t even go into the other paired sidedish of sliced raw onions in vinegar with dipping black bean sauce. 

I gave them the benefit of the doubt and proceeded to take my first bite.  
First thought that entered my mind.  This is not fresh, made from scratch jjajang sauce, and it oddly tastes very familiar.  Second bite, and it hit me.  I was eating my favorite instant jjajangmyun noodles that I buy all the time from H-Mart for ~$1.25.  Unlike other instant jjajangmyun packages which come with a dry powered packet, this particular instant jjajangmyun package used by hanbun comes with a sauce pouch that just needs to be warmed in hot water.  This is the reason why the little vegetable cubes in the sauce are perfectly cut, soft, and processed consistency.  

I don&#39;t know if this is hanbun&#39;s food concept to resell ~$1.25 packages of instant noodles for $9 and call it fusion korean food?  Either way it&#39;s beyond overpriced.  Did they really expect no one to figure that out?  That&#39;s their prerogative I guess.  
What boggles the mind is that they would choose to go this route with a food stall that they obviously spent a good chunk of money on.  
Korean food is so easy to make.  Jjajang sauce is so easy to make from scratch.  It takes at most 30 minutes, including prep and clean.  Traditional jjajang sauce needs meat for that flavor, usually cubed pork or seafood.  The traditional jjajangmyun noodles can be bought at H-Mart dry in a box.  The least that could be done to the instant noodles was add some slices of seasoned pork belly to the top and call it fusion.  I see hanbun&#39;s vegetarian jjajangmyun claim because the sauce pouch doesn&#39;t contain any meat.

I saw some of hanbun&#39;s other offerings being eaten by people.  The jun (pancake), are you serious?  The food portion size was so small especially for something so inexpensive and easy to make, I felt bad for those people.  Again jun is so easy to make.  Mix a flour batter, mix in veggies, add meat and/or seafood, and fry up on the griddle.  Material costs easily under $2 for a huge meat or seafood/veggie jun, more like $1 for a veggie jun.
In the posted picture of the jun, it&#39;s painfully lacking ingredients.  It&#39;s mostly fried flour batter.  Vegetables are cheap.  Be a little more generous adding to the mix.

It&#39;s not my business, obviously just voicing my opinions, but this business model is not sustainable.  Hanbun will get the first time customers who are curious to taste a new food stall&#39;s food.  The key is to retain those customers and make them regular customers.  I really don&#39;t see that happening because the prices are slightly steep and customers just don&#39;t get much quality food for the money paid.  The food portion size to price ratio is horrendously skewed in favor of the business.  People want to feel like they got their money&#39;s worth.  
The cost of food materials is mostly cheap.  Adjust the profit margin down a bit and give more food. 

To a non-Korean, the concept of banchan (sidedish) is an oddity and a treat. With all the trays, throw in a dish or two of something simple and inexpensive to make (there are tons to choose from).  Make your customers happy, and they&#39;ll be back.  Spend some time researching authentic recipes and offer real made from scratch dishes.

Maybe hanbun&#39;s concept is serving tiny portions at high prices or boiling up some instant noodles and calling it fusion.  In that case I apologize and take back what I said.  But also realize you are not in the middle of Michigan Ave or somewhere in the Loop.  You are in a chinese food court so cater to your customers."

Just to give some background, I lived in Japan for a while and became a bit of a ramen eater (ramen snob?). I know authentic Japanese ramen fairly well, but not Ramyun. I tend to run my mouth off about ramen, so I&#39;m going to do the same thing for the ramyun! 

Korean Ramyun - holy hell was this delicious. Super thick, beautifully salty and spicy broth, which I was surprised wasn&#39;t pork broth, but actually chicken. The noodles were great, perfectly cooked, which were right in line from what I&#39;d expect from a good Japanese ramen place, all the other ingredients were great as well, especially the chicken, and I was glad to see that ramyun likes the egg in the bowl trick as much as ramen does. Those bites and slurps with the runny egg yolk are so decadent. Glad I now know how good ramyun can compare with ramen.

Everything else we had was amazing too. I used to have black been noodles every so often when I lived in the city, at places like Cho Sun Ok. Usually they struck me as kind of plain before, but this version is fantastic. I enjoyed it just as much as the ramyun, which surprised me. The toasted rice cakes were wonderful. Texture was great, the sauce and the little bits on top of it were delicious. Spicy rice cakes were delicious, with a great chili sauce and fish cake balls (I love those things). And the pork bun was awesome - I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had a version with kimchi in a pork bun, and it went really well with the tender, delicious pork. 

My wife and I live fairly close (well worth the 20 minute or so drive) so we&#39;ll be heading back soon. Looking forward to trying the kalbi plate - there&#39;s no way you could possibly hope to find short ribs at a Korean place in Chicago for the 12ish bucks here. Cho Sun Ok, which was my go to place that I thought was cheaper than most (like Chicago Kalbi) is expensive in comparison.

Go here. You&#39;ll be thankful you did."

First of all, as a Korean, I can honestly say I appreciated the chef&#39;s take/style on his version of Korean food.  The vegetable pancakes, the BBQ spare ribs, and the black bean noodles were superb. The dishes were incredibly savory and cooked just right which was extremely important especially since some other Korean eateries tend to overcook their food. I was tremendously impressed with the chef&#39;s style/technique in his cooking.  You can tell that a lot of heart and skillful preparation was put into his art.  Lastly, the prices were extremely affordable (average dish $8) and definitely worth the money.

Great first experience firehouse. You are well on your way to shitty service. I doubt there is any way I&#39;ll enjoy this sandwich.

Update:

The sandwich was a sloppy soggy mess. Bread was not toasted ( I was under the impression the meat gets steam heated and the bread gets toasted. If I&#39;m incorrect they should consider it, because I could barely pick it up). Good amount of food for the price so they get credit for value, but about a quarter of the sandwich had no meat, clearly the one making sandwiches cared about it as much as the girl working cashier. There are just too many other good choices to bother with them again. It&#39;s a sad day in your business when the Subway a half block away gives you better customer service."

My normal sub from almost anywhere is the Italian,  or some variation of it. Today I thought a meatball sub would be appropriate,  given the damp, dreary weather and my inability to warm up. I places my order: a medium meatball sub on wheat. The cashier asked if I wanted a regular meatball sub, or sweet and spicy.  Guess which one I chose. I also grabbed a bottle of water, naturally. 

While waiting for my food, I inspected my surroundings.  It has your typical firehouse theme going on, and there&#39;s a large selection of hot sauces to top your sandwich with. For those who desire a side of diabetes, obesity,  or cavaties with their meal, a Coca Cola Freestyle machine is available to satisfy your sweet tooth or spike your insulin levels. The tables looked clean, even during the lunch rush.

Once my order was ready, an employee called my name. He was rather quiet and had to repeat it before I hear him, even though I was at the pick up counter. I opened the container and was pleased.  The sandwich looked good- the cheese evenly melted,  and a healthy dash of red pepper flakes on top of the cheese. The first bite? Holy hell, where&#39;s the firehose? This baby was spicy! And I loved it. The sweetness of the sauce was equally pleasing. I was also glad to see I received a pickle on the side.

I&#39;m glad I decided to give this place another shot. The prices are fair and the food was delicious. It&#39;s close to both work and home, so there&#39;s no doubt I may become a regular here."

They need much quicker ovens, excited employees and sandwiches that are unique. If you&#39;re going to survive in Naperville.... you better step up.

I was surprised it&#39;s a chain, as I&#39;d never heard of Firehouse Subs til they started building this one at 59 &amp; McDowell. 

Subs come in medium or large, most being hot subs, and available on white or wheat bread. There are 2 cold subs available, tuna and white chicken salad. I got the white chicken salad, which was really good. It came with lettuce, onion, and tomato. 

Their kids&#39; combos are less than $4 and come w/ a drink, dessert, and a cute little fire hat. They have Hot Grilled Cheddar Cheese available on the kids&#39; menu, but can also be ordered by adults for $2.79. Gotta remember to ask them to butter it next time. You shouldn&#39;t have to ask for grilled cheese to be buttered, but this was very plain and dry.

My fav part of this place (besides being founded by firemen - I have firemen in my family) is their non-profit. They have the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation which provides much needed funds to fire, police, and EMS departments to assist with life-saving equipment and training their departments might not otherwise be able to afford."

After eating a Firehouse sub, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever return to Subway or Jimmy John&#39;s. (Though I have never been to Jersey Mike&#39;s, so I can&#39;t compare it to that...yet.)

First off, I&#39;ll say I&#39;m really picky about my sub bread. A common problem I find with other places is that their bread either gets really stale or flaky pretty quickly (especially since I&#39;m a slow eater, by the time I get to the end of the sandwich I usually end up picking the meat out and just leaving the rest of the bread), or it&#39;s like a french bread kinda roll that&#39;s hard to tear with your teeth. But the Firehouse bread? PERFECT! They toast it, which I usually don&#39;t prefer at other sub places, but since it&#39;s very lightly toasted I don&#39;t mind here. And then the meat is prepared in these steamer things, so it comes out nice and warm--a great treat for when it&#39;s like 35 degrees outside!

The employees are all pretty friendly, they yell &#34;WELCOME TO FIREHOUSE!&#34; when people walk in the door which is hilarious. I love it. And they also took the time to describe their subs and menu, which I appreciated.

I got the Italian sub and I don&#39;t know what it was about that one, but....wow. Just wow. I&#39;ve never had an Italian that good. I know it sounds so cheesy, but just thinking about it is making my mouth water...it&#39;s too bad there&#39;s not a Firehouse closer to me :-/ Will definitely be back if I&#39;m in the area!"

I had the hero, which for the price was not very good.  It was like a toasted Subway sandwich, but for more money.  The space is cramped and a little confusing on ordering.  It gets busy and people don&#39;t know where to stand in line.  Also, they have the flavored coke machine, but it only has one dispenser.  There were up to 6 people waiting at lunch to fill their drink. Not a smart choice for a busy place.  The wait after ordering was about 10 mins, which can be long if you have a short lunch.

It was so good and one of the best subs I&#39;ve had in a long time.  There was a great portion of meat, cheeses, lettuce, and veggies on it.  Normally sandwiches get the shaft on their portion of meat but I didn&#39;t see that lack here.  While I was there a family with two small children came and sat near me.

Saw an ad for this place in our homeowner&#39;s association newsletter, saw the good reviews here on Yelp, and decided to give it a try after picking up our daughter from preschool.

Yes. This place rocks. We were here around 11:45 on a Friday, and the place was packed. The line snaked back from the register, through the tables, but it moved very quickly. The best part about the ordering experience is that, as soon as you are done, you get to sit down and they bring your food out to you.

Also, like the Wendy&#39;s across the street, they have one of those super-fancy coke machines that dispenses something like 3,000 different varieties of Coke and Coke products. Diet Vanilla Barqs? Yes please. And for the kids, as the other reviewers noted, they have plastic fireman helmets to wear.

As for the subs, I ordered the Turkey Bacon Ranch and loved it. The bread was nice and toasty but not overly crunchy, and the meat, cheese, bacon, and peppercorn ranch came together in a heap of yummy deliciousness in between. My wife got a plain old roasted turkey breast sub (she really liked it), and our daughter got the grilled cheese. My only gripe with the kid&#39;s menu is that they don&#39;t have any &#34;healthy&#34; options for drinks other than water. Apple juice or milk would have been nice. The closest thing to juice they have is Hi-C. No thanks.

Finally, they have a huge selection of chips. Whereas Subway seems to have cut back on their selection of chips so that now you can choose between a flavor or two of baked lays or a bag of cool ranch Doritos, the selection at this place spans almost the entire length of the counter. Color me impressed.

I will definitely come back here when I&#39;m in the mood for a sub."

I had the 12&#34; chicken on wheat bread with Provolone, lettuce, and BBQ sauce and it was very tasty and filling.  The meat was plentiful, the cheese was just right and melted perfectly, and the bbq sauce added the extra flavor that the sandwich needed.  I also had a bag of chips and made a million trips to the soda fountain so that I could mix and match my soda flavors.  Being able to create and try various flavors was a blast and I felt like a kid again.

My mom had the 12&#34; beef brisket sandwich which looked good as well.  She really enjoyed it.  The brisket was flavorful with a bit of a smokey taste and was tender.  The beef wasn&#39;t at all fatty which was very nice as well.    

For dessert, I tried the brownie which was very dense and chocolaty, not dry at all.  I think I would get it again for sure.  I also tried a bite of the lemon cookie which wasn&#39;t my favorite, but was a nice change compared to the usual sugar or macadamia nut cookie offerings.

The prices are a bit high when compared to similar sandwich places, but the quality and service really is better.  I have a hard time spending a bit more usually and I think it&#39;s worth the investment here."

Boy was I disappointed.  I ordered a steak and cheese sub.  It was the worst sub I ever had.  It was bland, the bread wasn&#39;t toasted, and it left a terrible after taste.  The meat was low quality.  There was a lot of fatty parts I kept pulling out of my mouth.  My husband ordered the corn beef brisket and said he would never order it again.  Also, the customer service was not the best.  I will remain a customer with Subway or Jimmy Johns.  If you want a great tasting sub, don&#39;t go to Firehouse.  You will come out better making your own or going someplace else.  We had to wait fifteen to twenty minutes on subs that tasted horrible.  I want my money back...  If you like horrible, low-quality tasting subs, go to Fireshouse.  You will get what you paid for.  I also believe some of their reviews are posted by people who own and work for the company."

You pay too much for what you get. In particular, the Steak &amp; Cheese was a joke. I understand most sandwiches don&#39;t look like they do in ads, but this was so far from the picture on their menu it was funny. The peppers and onion were lifeless (no color / texture) and the sandwich itself was small. I was really looking forward to the fancy coke machine, but that too was a disappointment. Their signature cherry limeade did not taste anything like lime and was like a very very strong cherry kool aid."

Ask to try their salsas but make sure to have tissue on hand because they come with a kick! Super flavorful nonetheless! I tried their churros, tamales and even a Mexican ice popsicle! Yes I went overboard haha but it was so worth it!

Every single person who has every served me here has been extremely nice and goes out of their way to make sure that I am satisfied and taken care of. 

The margaritas are larger than you&#39;d expect and pretty cheap too. That&#39;s how I like my margaritas.  I drink a dew of those babies and before I know it I&#39;m dancing to the Mexican music that&#39;s playing overhead. Just kidding there isn&#39;t enough room to dance."

Right in downtown Westmont, very easy to get to, and they have there own parking lot.  I came here in a Friday evening with my little guy. We planned on eating here and bringing home some for my husband. We also told the lady we would be dining in but wanted it &#34;to-go&#34; since we wouldn&#39;t be eating everything that we ordered. 
First we walked in and it was clean, smelled amazing (if you like BBQ) and very inviting. They had a pretty good variety of food/meals to choose from. We ordered the burnt ends dinner-meal and full slab of ribs-meal, both came with two sides. We choose fried mac and cheese, French fries, broccoli salad (mix), and corn bread for our sides. The French fries seemed a bit of a joke, very little amount and looked like it was the end of the batch, very greasy, and I ended up throwing them away. The other sides were pretty tasty. 
The burnt ends were very delicious, not dry, just enough bbq sauce. The ribs were a bit dry but if you put enough BBQ sauce on them they were decent. 
I would love to come back here while I&#39;m in the area for lunch or a little earlier in the day. 
The employees here were very nice. I could tell they have a lot of regulars that come in here by the way they talk to customers. That made me happy and to see older people come in here and be greeted/talked to like family. It makes you feel warm and good inside to see that people love their job and treat people so good."

 The problem with most bbq sauce is the sugar. Sugar doesn&#39;t usually make bbq sauce better but rather masks the true taste/quality. it can mute the spicy sauces and I think it is what happened here. In this instance, it is not necessarily a negative. you can still taste and second punch delivery is in the after-taste of the spicy. it works! nice move.

brown paper towels on the wooden spool stand at tables says &#34;you want to eat, and we are serious about it, too!&#34;

I ordered the pulled pork bbq sandwhich (some bbq sauce already on it but I gotsta drench every time in sauce after first bite at any bbq joint..it&#39;s just my thing)  5oz. of bbq..and it comes with 2 sides..I chose the corn on the cob (they are the short ones) and the fried mac n cheese balls. the mac n cheese inside was ok and the fried balls were crispy and tasty and overpowered the mac n cheese taste a bit. hard if not impossible to make fried mac n cheese balls that don&#39;t taste this way.

the mild sauce tastes smokier than the spicy. the bbq seemes smoked taste but I did drench it with the mild bbq sauce prematurely. good! POUR DAT SAUCE LIKE PANCAKE SYRUP.

But, I&#39;d love Uncle Bubs to tell me the ribs they win contests with are the same ribs the serve at their restaurant.  They serve babybacks at Uncle Bubs, who wins contests with babybacks?  The ribs pull right off the bone and they do have good flavor,  but they should be better.  If you&#39;re going to put up your credentials, serve the same damn thing that won you those credentials.  It&#39;s like McDonald&#39;s winning a hamburger competition serving USDA PRIME Angus beef.  

I do love their cornbread - it is very very good.  Their mac-n-cheese ball is plain and bland.  The Brunswick stew is personally, too sweet, but I appreciate their effort. 

Now, the Burnt ends are a joke.  They need to get their ass down to Austin, TX to see what a burnt end is (or even St Louis).  What they serve are cubes of dry brisket slobbered in sauce.  Look at the enclosed picture, how many ends do you see burnt?  More so, you can tell by the burnt ends the brisket isn&#39;t worth trying. It is too dry, it should taste like meat candy, not hardened steak.

This might be a good place to take kids, because when we settled in to wait for our food a guy came over to do magic tricks. Which is fine if you have a five year old with you, but for two adults decompressing after work it was a little weird. He did decamp when our food arrived, though.

Managers went past us without once asking about our experience and we were dissatisfied with the entire experience.  Some tables had servers and others did not?  What are the expectations for this?  Thank goodness for carry out as this is the only way I will ever be back."

The three meats we tried: pulled pork, sliced brisket, BBQ chicken, were over cooked and very dry. My brisket slices were black on the ends and I could not chew them. I left over half the meat on the plate it was so undesirable. The sides were tasty. 

On other occasions we&#39;ve eaten here and been thrilled with the food. The 3 stars are an average of a 1 and a 5."

We usually have over 500 customers that attend. This year, we were recommended to use Uncle Bub&#39;s from one of our employees who had tried their food at a family get together.

I&#39;m so glad we took his advice because I can not even express how thrilled we were with the service and the food from the on-site pig roast they provided.  

In prior years, we had done all the serving of the food and busing of the tables ourselves.This year, Uncle Bub&#39;s took care of all of it.

 We received so many compliments from employees and customers regarding the service that we were given and how great the food was.

For the first time ever, I actually received e-mails from customers thanking us for the wonderful food.

One customer said &#34;I just wanted to thank you for such a wonderful night. I still can&#39;t stop bragging  about your awesome spread&#34;

We will definitely be utilizing them again next year!"

The savory tender deliciousness of Uncle Bub&#39;s Award winning BBQ, the craft beers on tap, the fried mac and cheese.

Sunday they sometimes have Beef Short rib, a hidden gem menu item. Think a perfectly seasoned pot roast just falling off the bone... yeah, it&#39;s that good.

Hate the green beans though, nothing wrong with them, just not a big fan of green beans. lol 

Family friendly atmosphere and they do catering for large events, weddings and gatherings. I plan on using them at some point for an event. 

Beyond the outstanding bbq food experience,  the owner Mark and his staff are so friendly and personable, no wonder there is such a huge loyal following including my loved ones and I.

I know what dinner is going to be tonight!"

This place was probably the worst restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to. Walking in, we weren&#39;t greeted or given any direction as to where to sit. We walked around and asked an employee if we should seat ourselves and he said &#34;sure&#34;. After sitting, we waited at the table for a few minutes, expecting a server to come with menus/water, and after nobody came, my husband got up to look for a server and found &#34;the front&#34; of the restaurant where we discovered a walk-up counter. Still, no welcome, how may I help you, anything. We stared at the menu while the cashier stood there like a statue. After making our selections, we got our drinks from the self-serve fountain machine, which tasted moldy and sat down at our table again. After a few minutes, assuming we had to pick-up our own food, my husband walked to the cashier only to be scolded by the statue that we didn&#39;t take the wooden pig shaped table topper with the order number. Well, we were never given any instructions so how would we know? Sat back down, and food came shortly after. 
I had ordered the beef brisket, which I knew would be a disaster just by looking at it. Meat was cold and dry, very evident that it had been sitting for awhile. Clearly it was not freshly cut  for my order. Cornbread - cold. Deep-fried mac &amp; cheese nuggets: only 2 and were cold, tasteless and lifeless. The broccoli salad literally looked like something you&#39;d find on the street in front of a grocery store in New York City at the end of the night...and it tasted like chemicals. My husband also mentioned his mashed potatoes tasted like it was from a box.
Not once did a server come by to check on us, which infuriated me even more because the place was pretty much empty. It appeared that maybe 2, 3 tables at best were occupied by other patrons. The rest were EMPLOYEES eating among the other tables. 
Finally, the server asked if I wanted a box, I just told him to take it away. He got a manager, and she asked what was wrong. I expressed the horrible service and food we received and she apologized but didn&#39;t seem surprised about my comment - as if this were a common thing. Either that or she didn&#39;t care, but perhaps a combination of both. She was nice enough to refund a portion of the meal, and the cashier statue came by our table with cash. BTW, her nails were FILTHY, like a mechanic&#39;s. 
It was really disappointing, especially since Uncle Bub&#39;s was allegedly known for their awards and have been featured on a few TV shows. Next time we&#39;ll go to Chuck&#39;s. That&#39;s always a sure thing!"

What I did like is that there are 3 doors you pass through to get into the restaurant.  I like that, no one gets blasted by frigid air on a cold winter&#39;s day.  There are markings on the floor to direct you to place you order and then find a seat.  There are daily specials.

Now the reality.  We ordered 2 pulled pork sandwiches and one beef stew special, served on noodles.  The stew was very thin, likened to Lipton soup by the person who had ordered it.  She took most of it home.  She did like the corn bread.  I found the pulled pork was not served hot and there was just too much bun for the amount of meat placed on it causing it to taste dry.  I did add BBQ sauce, didn&#39;t help much.  The other person who had ordered the pulled pork tried to eat the meat, but couldn&#39;t even do that.  She tried 1 French fry, and passed on the cole slaw.  She ended up just wrapping the meal in the paper that it is served on and had nothing to eat.  The 2 fried mac and cheese balls that I had were the best part of these 3 meals, but again, I thought they would be hot.

This was a big fail.  In reviewing the other reviews, it appears that this is a hit or miss type of place.  BIG MISS today.

However, if you are so inclined, try it for yourself, you may get lucky."

Grant it, it&#39;s not in Chicago, where there is some world class bbq, but it&#39;s close enough that the q should be better. We went with a group of 8 peeps and no one was impressed.

The chicken was relatively flavorless. The brisket was good, but very dry. Pulled pork was ok, kinda meh. The ribs....bad. They were dry and meatless. I&#39;m sad to post a negative review for this place because I really wanted to like it! And by the way, don&#39;t bother getting the mac and cheese balls...that is, unless you like fake tasting Kraft mac and cheese. If that&#39;s the case, you&#39;re gonna LOVE IT! The green beans, again, totally flavorless.

On a better note, the hubs got the pecan crusted catfish. He thought it was A Ok. Not spectacular, but certainly not bad. I think someone thought the cornbread was decent, but others, not so much. And the bbq sauce....can anyone tell me what the difference is between the mild and spicy?? I couldn&#39;t tell one bit. I kept using different bottles on the tables to see if there was something wrong with me....well, that is definitely questionable, but not the point. Ha! I still could not distinguish between the two bbq sauces."

Walking up, you can smell the hickory smoke emanating from the Southern Pride smokers inside.  This makes me go from hungry for lunch to a crazed man who needs a BBQ fix.

The building is great, you feel like you are outside with shacks around you.  The staff was some of the best I have had the pleasure to order from.  They instantly knew that we were new to Uncle Bub&#39;s and were quick to answer any of our goofy questions such as &#34;why kind of smoker do you guys use?&#34;.   The atmosphere and vibe you get here is very welcoming and fun.  It makes you comfortable, wanting to kick back and stay for the entire day.

The food is amazing, but the first place trophies from competitions around the US can explain that better than I can.  They have tons of them scattered about the building.  I would suggest you try a little.. or alot.. of everything on the menu, i really enjoyed the fried mac and cheese as a side though."

An obvious disregard of the ideal &#34;low and slow&#34; technique, the excessive connective tissue made the ribs extremely difficult to enjoy. While the rub and house BBQ sauce were a well-paired accompaniment, it was just too hard to surmount the major deficiencies in the $20 plate. A side of Burnt Ends disappointed much the same...fatty, with a texture similar to cow tongue, and NOT f***ing BURNT! Another obvious rush job at this local smokehouse. If there were any positives, the creamy vinegar-based Cole Slaw was on point, the fried Mac n&#39; Cheese balls lived up to the hype. In keeping with the sides, the cornbread was dry, but a sweet and buttery finish kept them afloat. Mashed potatoes were boring, something I&#39;d steer away from with other more appealing options. All in all, Q in LaGrange is looking to be the odds on BBQ favorite. More bang for your buck, and worth every cent."

My TOP 5 recommendations:
1. PULLED PORK NACHOS - oh boy, need I say more? An appetizer fit for a mass feeding. It has a layer of crispy crunchy tortilla chippies, with a generous heaping of their slow roasted pulled pork, topped with refried beans and jalapeños and drenched with cheese.  Not the gooey cheese but like the dipping stuff.  Liquid gold! 
2. BURNT ENDS -perfectly charred and super moist.  Topped with a bit of their BBQ sauce.  Order this as a sandwich or on it&#39;s own.  It won&#39;t disappoint.
3. CHICKEN WINGS -deep fried paradise.  Their wings are spot on. Cooked crisped on the outside but then you bite into them and the meat is moist and tender.  Probably the BEST wings I&#39;ve had ever.
4. BRISKET - it just  melts in your mouth.  You don&#39;t even spend time chewing it up.  It&#39;s that good.
5. DEEP FRIED MAC AND CHEESE- it&#39;s not an entree but it certainly is one of the reasons I love Uncle Bubs.  Breaded mac and cheese deep fried and served hot to you so when you bite into it, it just pops with good flavor and hot cheese....hawt.

I can&#39;t write about this place anymore because it just makes my mouth water.  Come check out this place.  They cater too!!! Great for summer parties or just parties in general!"

My husband and I were so pleased with our wedding day because of the hard work and efforts of Bub&#39;s staff members. Mark and Marie, who coordinate many aspects of the day, were so kind and helpful. We were on a budget, and they did their very best to ensure that our wedding budget was kept in check. Also, Uncle Bub&#39;s worked with us to help make sure every detail was in place from start of our cocktail hour all the way through our reception. Marie is a fantastic event coordinator and planner; she is organized, attentive, helpful, and enthusiastic. We felt very secure on our wedding day knowing that we need not worry about any minor details. 

On top of amazing catering logistics, Uncle Bub&#39;s delivered on its quality BBQ for our wedding. We chose to do a buffet with Pulled Pork, BBQ Chicken, Mac &amp; Cheese, Salad, and other items. The pulled pork was delicious with great buns; I was also akin to the delicious potato bread rolls. I highly recommend you eat these and then sneak some to take home! :-) Our guests said they loved the food! The food was prepared and served well. Jerry, the captain, was attentive to us and made sure we were happy with the entire night. The staff was excellent, and we can&#39;t say one negative aspect of the night! 

The entire experience of planning our wedding was wonderful because of the tireless efforts of Uncle Bub&#39;s. We cannot say thank you enough! They truly did a fabulous job, and we HIGHLY recommend them. Go for unique food at your wedding and choose Bub&#39;s because they are amazing."

I&#39;ve been here quite a few times in the past decade or so. You might be asking, what is Uncle Bub&#39;s? Well, Uncle Bub&#39;s is a barbeque joint in an old wooden building in downtown Westmont off of Cass avenue just a little bit South of the train tracks.

Immediately noticeable with a cartoon pig on the sign Uncle Bubs is well known to almost everyone who has passed down Cass avenue in the last decade or so. Many years ago I stopped in the first time and have been back well over a dozen times since. 

Uncle Bub&#39;s is an old wooden building and as soon as you pull up you&#39;ll smell the food coming from within. Once you enter the building it&#39;s really more like an old house with a front door and then several halls where the seating is located with an order counter hiding in the Southwest corner. I&#39;ll go over the good and the bad with Uncle Bub&#39;s and allow you to decide for yourself whether it&#39;s worth stopping here.

We&#39;ll start with the positives. Uncle Bub&#39;s has some pretty excellent sides, the fried mac and cheese balls are one of my favorites. Originally you got one huge ball of fried mac and cheese, now it comes in several smaller fried balls. The BBQ sauces at the table are tasty. They have Green River in their soda fountain, compared to some other local BBQ places they have adequate parking and quite a few places to sit. And their food can be excellent with a nice smokey flavor.

Now let&#39;s go on to the down sides of Uncle Bubs, first off the consistency. I&#39;ve had chicken, pulled pork and many other things here. Sometimes there&#39;s a great smokey flavor grilled into the food, but more often than not it&#39;s lacking. Sure, you can cover it up with BBQ sauce and have that overpower the flavor, but then you&#39;re missing something. It seems like sometimes stuff is left to smoke a lot longer than others.While there&#39;s lots of seats, they can be uncomfortable to sit in with wooden hard booths. This isn&#39;t a problem for a short time, but I&#39;ve had orders take a while and it&#39;s just not a place you want to be spending 40 minutes sitting at.

This eatery with a cartoonish pig for a mascot is a place you can go hog wild with excellent appetizers and competent barbeque. When busy, the long wait can turn your visit into a bit of a boar and the due to the hard booths it&#39;s not a comfortable place to wallow around and wait. However, this shouldn&#39;t HAM-per you from visiting. My feelings on Uncle Bub&#39;s are mixed and I don&#39;t mean to swine about the place. It&#39;s always clean, well maintained and never a pig-pen like other restaurants in the area. The quality appetizers will make you squeal and that&#39;s no hogwash. It&#39;s a good place to stop whether you&#39;re a dude or a babe, the prices are reasonable so whether you&#39;re rich or pork you should be able to afford the food here without breaking your piggy bank. So I&#39;ll give Uncle Bub&#39;s three stars, it&#39;s snout the best BBQ joint in the area, but it&#39;s worth visiting. Oink you very much for reading."

Haven&#39;t been here in many years because last time the bbq was not good enough. This time we went in because the sign outside said corned beef special on Fridays. The corned beef was so disappointing and extremely dry I&#39;d be surprised if they even made the corned beef. It tasted like store bought deli. My husband had the catfish that was not tender or flaky. The only part of our dinner that was any good was the ranch sauce for our onion blossom and the corn bread muffin. The beans seemed semi homemade and the potato salad was homemade but so bland. The cream of mushroom soup was very good. Wish it was a better dining experience. We didn&#39;t even take home our leftovers.

As for the homemade mashed potatoes you could tell they were made from a potato flake powder.  I could of overlooked all of that but the service was a disaster.  I was there with my boyfriend and another couple.  Our food came out while we waited about ten more minutes for the other couple&#39;s.

Every time I looked forward to having Bub&#39;s BBQ and it was always a treat.

Then one day the possibility of having lunch here presented itself while on the way to Aurora for some outlet shopping.  My dreams of a five star barbeque meal were shattered.  I&#39;ll refrain from the play by play.  We ordered a bit of everything.  Really.  Four dined and shared everything together.  Everything was pretty average, as good as stuff purchased from your corner char house.  I was bummed.  I also thought for an afternoon meal, an afternoon with steady business, the table should not have been so sticky.  But this observation has more to do with how or what they use to clean off tables.

With a family, the place can be a fun time and a point of interest for photos sake.  But if seeking serious barbeque, I have to admit you&#39;ll have to keep looking.  Or as I shared earlier, seek them out at festivals.  It&#39;s where their A game is presented."

So off we went to give Uncle Bub&#39;s a try.  We had several sides along with the brisket.  We almost always order pulled pork but decided to give the brisket a try.  The brisket was okay but we both felt it lacked some seasoning and could have been tenderer.  The bbq beans were nothing special and the mac and cheese needed to be more cheesy and creamier.  I know everyone has their own criteria of what is good BBQ but there are definitely better BBQ joints in the suburbs.

We were there on a Thursday evening around 6 pm. Although there were no customers we had to wait for them to take our order. We sat at a booth but as my wife sat on her side her feet kept sliding. There was margarine all over the floor under the table! Her shoes were covered in margarine. She had to clean up and sat on my side with me. Our food came after 10 minutes. My sandwich was barely warm and the meat was dry. I had the broasted potatoes and they were just blah. The corn on the cob had been cooked too long in water and was bland and mushy. My wife felt the same about her sandwich but enjoyed the fried macaroni and cheese. The decor in here has a down south feel but the food fell short again. We will probably not return again.

I ended up ordering the pulled pork, brisket, green beans, fried mac n cheese, and cornbread.  The best part of the meal definitely was the fried mac n cheese balls.  Some parts of the pulled pork and brisket were tender while others were more dried and burnt.  I was satisfied with the green beans since they had a nice smoky flavor.  The cornbread was pretty good except I wish my piece had corn kernels in it.  Overall the food was mediocre but nothing exceptional about it."

It&#39;s nearby, has plentiful parking and has a fair amount of positive buzz from the usual outlets. The problem is simply that the food is decent, but not great. I&#39;ve enjoyed a few pulled pork sandwiches here, but the rib tips were somewhat disappointing (not enough smokey flavor for my taste). The fries are pretty good, though the potato salad could have used some more zip via seasoning. Of the sides I&#39;ve tried, the fried mac and cheese was my favorite (two hush puppy-sized balls of deep fried deliciousness).

I&#39;m not crazy about the table BBQ sauces here, but that is obviously a matter of personal taste. I think the portions are reasonable for the price. The restaurant has a very strange layout, making the path to the counter less than obvious from the door. To their credit, Uncle Bub&#39;s has done its best with signage (on the floor and wall) to make the best of the unusual floorplan.

I really like to support local independent restaurants like Uncle Bub&#39;s. I just wish they would step up their game a little bit."

There was a little confusion with the order when I picked it up but the manager took it as an opportunity to make a bad situation good.

I would not suggest that it is the best BBQ I have ever had, but is certainly good and stands out among the fray.  The building has that classic BBQ vibe but is not over done or cliche. 

For the food, I would always recommend that people select the Pulled Pork or Chicken over the Brisket at Uncle Bubs.  I feel like the Brisket is slightly less flavorful than those other options.  The ribs are always good and I enjoy the racks as opposed to the rib tips.  Fried Mac and Cheese is a must, mainly because it is fried mac and cheese.

In terms of service, Uncle Bubs is hands down amazing. A few years back I utilized them to cater a corporate event with 40 people.  We did not do the pig roast, but simply ordered a bunch of different food.  The staff member I spoke with at Uncle Bubs was more than willing to help me determine how much food I needed. Upon arrival, I asked the man who delivered it if it looked like it would be enough food as it didn&#39;t look like as much I was expecting.  He reassured me that it was and left.  While the event was going on, we were running quite low on a few of the options, but it did indeed look like we had enough.  To my surprise, in the middle of eating another driver showed up and dropped off more food to quell my concern. They always seem to be willing to go above and beyond to make their customers happy.

I will be a customer for life!"

Plenty of brisket with the meal no doubt, but as a huge brisket fan, I can tell you this was likely the least enjoyable brisket that I&#39;ve ever had. It seemed way over cooked and very dry. It was actually pretty flavorless and I doused it in spicy BBQ sauce to liven it up. That didn&#39;t help as the BBQ sauce was not spicy and was also pretty flavorless.

Brisket was miserable. No char, no flavor. Looked like it was cut on the slicer, kinda gray in color. Very off putting. Cold and fatty too. 

I&#39;m not sure what happened. Uncle Bubs used to be good. Always came for family get-togethers, birthdays and graduations. Sadly I&#39;ll not return. It&#39;s like they just gave up and don&#39;t care about their product. Nothing tastes homemade or fresh. Canned and bland.

The last time I went the service was perfect and the waitress even asked if she wanted her to refill my drink wanted. when your supposed to get up and get it yourself. So the service is perfect. Now on to the food I had a pulled pork sandwich with French fries, and Mac and cheese balls. They all had a very good flavor overall and their food doesn&#39;t taste like other restaurants food so if your looking for a place to eat go directly to Uncle Bubs you will definitely get your money&#39;s worth."

There is a lot of BBQ available in the Chicagoland area and Uncle Bub&#39;s always is near the top of my list to suggest. The way they cook their meat, the love they pour into their BBQ. It all shines through!  

The interior is very roadhouse inspired and is great to go with friends or family. Plenty of room means there&#39;s usually easy seating to be had unless they are running a special (when they do run them - look out! There&#39;s going to be a line.)"

Our food wasnt hot when it arrived, it warm at best. I feel like a good judge at a bbq place is how the brisket is so i ordered that. The brisket was lean but it was also tuff. I also feel that if a meat is smoked good you should see a nice deep pink/purple smoke ring which gives it a great smoked flavor that you dont even need to put sauce on. However, both mine and my friends briskets lacked this. It tasted like a beef roast that you cooked in the oven then sliced and poured on some sauce. Also their mashed potatoes tasted like boxed potatoes. No restaurant should serve boxed potatoes in my opinion. Overall very disappointed and doubt well go back seeing that there are much better bbq places nearby."

After reading the reviews I was hesitant to try it but I&#39;m glad I did. I got the rib tips and they were very good; my director got the wings,BBQ and buffalo and she liked them both. I tried one of her buffalo wings and it was good; loved the buffalo sauce! I am definitely going to come here again for lunch!!"

The food was amazing, the service was outstanding, and the planning was a breeze thanks to Mark &amp; Marie.  From the menu, the staff, the linen&#39;s on the tables, setting up and taking down, Uncle Bub&#39;s took care of everything we needed. (They even suggested the venue we used since it is very difficult to find a venue that allows you to bring in BBQ and cook onsite.. Oak Brook Bath &amp; Tennis Club )  Mark &amp; Marie were both so easy to work with and our Event Capt. Jerry kept everything running on schedule and smoothly the day of the wedding.  Our servers and bartenders were great too - they made sure our guests ( about 150+) had everything they needed at all times.  They even put together to-go boxes and wine for the bridal party to take back to the hotel for some late night snacking after the reception.  Honestly, from the planning to the actual event, it couldn&#39;t have gone any better.  We had Ferrara Bakery ( from Taylor Street ) cater the cocktail hour and sweet table and Uncle Bub&#39;s staff took care of setting everything up beautifully.  At the end of the evening, their staff packed up everything ( including the decorations ) so neatly we didn&#39;t have to do a thing.  What a wonderful and professional group of people! 

Our daughter and her fiancé&#39; didn&#39;t want the usual &#34;plated hours ahead of time-over cooked-over-priced-chicken-steak wedding food&#34; that 99% of wedding receptions serve. They also didn&#39;t want their guests leaving at the end of the reception searching for a fast food drive thru because they were hungry. We have all been served that fare at a wedding - watery soup, bland green salad, chicken that is cold and rubbery or a steak that is bloody and tough thrown on a plate with a few lukewarm vegetables. This was not the case with Uncle Bub&#39;s.  The food was grilled on site and basically went from grill/smoker to plate.  The roasted chicken was AMAZING, the pulled pork was so delish, and the burgers were hot &amp; fresh. Baked mac &amp; cheese like you&#39;d make in your own kitchen, two kinds of cole slaw, corn bread, and baked beans rounded out the offerings.  Everyone was raving on how good everything was, how much they enjoyed being able to pick as much or as little as they wanted, and the ability to go up for seconds! It&#39;s been almost 3 weeks since the reception and we are still getting compliments on how nice it was to go to a wedding reception that you didn&#39;t leave hungry, wasn&#39;t the typical wedding reception meal and where you actually enjoyed the food.  I would recommend Uncle Bub&#39;s for anyone having any type of event, small or large.  They make everything stress free so you can actually enjoy yourself with your guests and their staff can&#39;t be beat.
Thank you Uncle Bub&#39;s!"

The prices were cheap and the food was excellent.  The manager was on the ball and the staff was good.  A total five star place.  Then they started winning the Naperville Ribfest and then they moved all of their prices up and reduced their portions.  Food was the same - excellent; but they started getting a little greedy.  I&#39;ll be honest, I still go there and speak very highly of it; but you have to realize, I was on board with these guys back when they were just a little hole-in-the-wall place across the street from Holy Trinity."

The restaurant has a reputation for outstanding BBQ, so I stopped in to see what the hype is all about. 
 If this is award winning BBQ, I&#39;m afraid the judges had less than enough experience to derermine that conclusion. I ordered the BBQ&#39;ed half chicken which was served as if it was cooked the night before and the BBQ sauce did not look any fresher or tastier. The table had two dispensers of Mild and Spicy BBQ sauce, but neither made the chicken any better. The sauce that was cooked on the chicken was almost hard laminated on the meat. One of my sides was the fried Mac and Cheese, which were two 1  1/2&#34; balls that looked like fritters but were ok at best. But only two? Com&#39;on? The other side was mashed potato&#39;s which were just ok. 
My wife and one son had the bacon burger which also were ok at best. 
 The real disapointment was what my youngest teenage son ordered, the bowl of chili which tasted bland and and needed all the BBQ sauce it could take to make it have a appetizing flavor. It was far from good. 
 I took my family to the restaurant really wanting to enjoy a good meal, from what was said to be a great restaurant. I left there pretty disapointed and hope that this wouldn&#39;t be what others think is a great meal. It&#39;s not. 
On the bright side the wait staff is friendly and service is good. But that&#39;s just a small part of what makes a restaurant good. What&#39;s on the end of the fork is what makes me want to come back for more. This place didn&#39;t satisfy that need for me or my family."

When someone says a barbeque place isn&#39;t &#34;authentic,&#34; what do they mean by that? I think all it means is that place doesn&#39;t happen to serve the type of barbeque that you&#39;ve learned to like. There&#39;s so many regional variations on the meat and sauce - Memphis-style, Carolina-style, Kansas City-style, Texas-style - that you can pretty much take your pick. 

Uncle Bub&#39;s is probably closest to Kansas City-style BBQ in that they slow-smoke a variety of meats with a dry rub seasoning, with sauce served on the table. Is it authentic? Who knows, unless you&#39;ve actually eaten BBQ in Kansas City? Is it good? If you define good BBQ as being moist and falling-off-the-bone-tender yet still flavorful, then hell yes, it&#39;s good! The barbeque place right by my house is decent enough, but if Uncle Bub&#39;s opened up next door to it, it would be no contest! 

I&#39;ve only had the pulled pork here, but it was so good that I&#39;m dying to go back and try some of their other smoked meats. Uncle Bub&#39;s BBQ sauce tastes like it uses a combination of vinegar and ketchup for its base, so that probably makes it closest to the Carolina-style sauce, if we have to put a label on it. All I know is I liked it, and others obviously do too, since their sauce has won first place at the Naperville Rib Fest and the Nuggets BBQ cook-off in Nevada. The sides are just OK - I had the corn bread and baked beans. Definitely try the pumpkin bread pudding with brown sugar butter sauce for dessert!

The décor is very casual and &#34;countrified&#34; - wooden picnic tables with plastic gingham tablecloths and rolls of brown paper towels for napkins. The ordering system is kind of confusing - first they told me to wait after I&#39;d ordered, then someone handed us a number and said they&#39;d bring our order to our table.  Having someone to explain the system would have been nice.

I&#39;ll definitely visit this place again when I&#39;m in the area!"

Took them 10 minutes to realize I intended this to be a to-go order, then proceeded to make me feel bad about it AND walk back to the window to make fun of me to coworkers... Whoa. Hey. I can see you. HUGE pet peeve of mine. I realized after leaving that they have a small side door for carry out orders, so I caused my own confusion, but there&#39;s no need to be rude... Ick.

Also, $47 dollars for two meals and an appetizer is INTENSE for BBQ. At Q in Naperville, you can get that for much less, and a myriad of fun sauces, and it&#39;s to die for. 

Uncle Bub&#39;s has just one sauce but it is really, really good. The fries were super soggy (takeout order, so they may be really good in house) and the fried Mac and cheese I got was a tiny portion and very flavorless - I think a different reviewer said it best when he noted that the fried breading on the outside shouldn&#39;t have more flavor than the Mac and cheese inside - but it did.

The rib tips we got to share were a huge order and incredibly delicious. We each got sliced brisket in our meals, and it was dry and tough, definitely required a lot of extra sauce to enjoy it. My fiancé enjoyed his baked beans, but we both would skip this place again unless we were in the area and craving BBQ."

As it relates to the western burbs, Uncle Bub&#39;s is hard to top. I&#39;ve been eating here since 1998, although there was a period when I was unable to go there. However, I&#39;ve made my way back a couple times of recent and here are two key improvements:

1. RIP TIPS!!!!!!  They are now on the menu. I gave them a try &amp; was VERY satisfied. If rip tips are your thing, you&#39;re safe ordering them here. They do serve them dry so you can take their house sauce or add your own should you decide to do so. So many places can&#39;t do them properly

2. Smoked Prime Rib is a once in a while special. When I got mine recent, it was outstanding. No bone and around 12 oz.. Mashed potatoes &amp; gravy and green beans went well with it. Too bad it&#39;s not a weekly special although I probably wouldn&#39;t be able to eat it weekly. Like the whole hog on Thursdays, the Prime Rib also sells out when it&#39;s on the menu. It&#39;s fit for a King (or Queen for that matter)!!!"

Like other Yelpers have stated, the look of the bar/restaurant itself makes you anticipate a hearty comforting Irish meal with accompanying beverages. In reality, it&#39;s a pretty typical pub. Average beers, full bar, and standard food.

They have a bunch of TVs and are apparently an Iowa bar, so I met up with some friends there recently to watch the game. At 11:30 am we were pretty much the only people in there, but it did pick up as we creeped into the afternoon.

Service was great and they had some sort of bud light special. Like the ladies we are, we all ordered a Bloody Mary and a side beer to go with it. It&#39;s a personal habit of mine to order cheese curds whenever they&#39;re on the menu, so I got some for the table. Accompanied with ranch (as they should be), these curds were really good! Most of us also got a bowl of their French onion soup which was very tasty. Lots of cheese and very flavorful.

Again, there&#39;s nothing bad about TN&#39;s, I just kind of want more out of such a good lookin&#39; establishment. A-OK place to grab a drink because of the atmosphere, but not my first choice in the area."

We selected this restaurant instead of a handful of others in the area because of the vast amount of private space provided, the great food, excellent service, and their endless flexibility/openness to our big ideas for the special day! Jared, the events manager was SO helpful and let us go to town on decorating and fulfilling our every idea! Jenny and Karl were our servers and they couldn&#39;t have been better! So sweet and attentive for the entire 6hrs we were there! They let us come hours in advance to set up and decorate everything. They allowed us to hang signs, banners, and even use the TV to play music along with a photo slideshow. I swear, anything we requested, Jared and the rest of the staff were on it! No restrictions about decor, staying in a certain area of the restaurant, special requests, etc. - Unheard of!!

We had a mimosa bar with different juices and fruits, which was wonderful! We really wanted private indoor/outdoor space, so we went with the library room and adjacent terrace, which ended up being perfect! We did presents outside, which allowed for everyone to spread out. The outdoor bar was great for the dads/fiancé to hang out during the party, too. All of the guests raved about the food, which was excellent and endless!!! Everyone went home with to-go boxes, which our servers graciously brought to each table without us even asking! 

I could go on and on, the bottom line is that if you&#39;re considering this place for your event, then definitely book it!! Out of everywhere we researched, Tommy Nevins was by far the best! They will assist you in having the event of your dreams!"

A very drab and unenthusiastic and frankly dishelved waitress served us. She was gone for very long periods of time and was clearly not in the right profession as she appeared to care very little for her customers. The restaurant was empty at 630pm and stayed that way. 
The food was drab as well. We ordered the loaded nachos, cheese curds and calamari. The chicken on the nachos was so extremely dry it was embarrassing. It was a basically disppointing dish but the waitress never came back anyway.... I wouldnt have served it. 
The calamari was old and kind of freezer burnt. Tasteless and thrown on the dish.  
The whole place gave me the feeling of being dirty, not clean. I didnt go to the bathroom but Ill bet it wasnt the cleanest either......"

New menu at Tommy Nevins now includes a customize your own Bloody Mary with a list of available options including pickles, two kinds of cheese, sausage, salami, buffalo wing, hard boiled egg, a cheeseburger, celery, carrots, olives, and bacon.    I decided to add ALL items.  Glad I did.   

Our server did grumble about my fully decked out Bloody being a PITA and that it would take 10 minutes.   Easy solution...I just ordered a beer in the meantime.   Excited for a social media worthy Bloody Mary I enjoyed a light Pilsner anxiously waiting my creation to arrive...

When it did, I was admittedly a bit disappointed.  All of the glorious accoutrements were skewered but served on a plate next to my beverage, left to some self assembly.    I get that such a concoction may be difficult to carry but come on Tommy Nevins, take pride in your Bloody Mary&#39;s.   You have something on the menu that will cause Bloody Mary enthusiasts to drive to your restaurant.   Make the experience special.   Be proud of the Bloody Mary you serve!   

The drink itself was above average, I do prefer a bit more spice in mine.   I did not dare ask for a spicy version after I ordered all of the toppings.   

The toppings were mostly excellent.   The mini cheeseburger was juicy and delicious.  My egg was a bit over cooked - had the greenish ring inside but no biggie.   The chicken wing was great.   The only disappointing topping was the sausage wheels... A bit tough and hard to chew.    

A manager came to our table half way through my Bloody experience and congratulated me on being the first person to order one of everything for the bloody.   I couldn&#39;t tell if he was being sincere and wanted to see the creation or if it was a &#34;hey guy, we made it for you this time but I&#39;m letting you know you&#39;re the ONLY person to do this so far and it&#39;s a PITA for our staff&#34;.   

Again I say Tommy Nevins: embrace your fully loaded Bloody Mary.   It&#39;s special.   Two suggestions...

1. Serve it with a snit.   A shot of lite beer on the side.  
2.  Give the fully loaded beast a name on your menu.   I dunno something like &#34;The Tony&#34; has a charming ring.  ;-)"

We went here on a Friday night, we were driving by and were in a rush and the parking lot wasn&#39;t very full so we decided to give it a try. As other posters here have said the interior of the place makes you expect a great experience, it feels very English pub like with the dark wood etc. 

But then it gets to be a basic pub experience with the service and food. Our waitress was nice, friendly but not very knowledgeable about the menu. I had one of their NBC beers, ahh not so good. They did have a special on Grey Goose vodka which my lady really appreciated. I had the nachos to eat, they use that cheese sauce like Cheese Whiz, not real cheese. It was ok at best. My lady had a chicken wrap which she said was dry.

Overall it&#39;s just ok,"

My best friend was in from out of town so I was really excited to try somewhere new for lunch. When we got there nobody even acknowledged the fact that we were there. No one sat us at a table or told us what to do. Finally we decided we would just sit at the bar. 
After waiting about 10 minutes the waiter/bar tender came over and asked what we wanted and we both ordered drinks. After drinking my beverage for a few minutes, which took 10 minutes to receive in the first place, I turned my cup around and noticed that there was lipstick on the glass and I wasn&#39;t wearing lipstick. I told the waiter and he threw down his order pad and grabbed my cup, dumped it out, then walked away to make me a new one. It wasn&#39;t until I got my new drink that he apologized but he had an attitude. 
Once we got our appetizer we asked him for some marinara sauce. It took another 15 minutes for him to bring us the marinara sauce but we were so hungry we had finished the entire appetizer by then. The food all tasted really good which is the only reason I&#39;m giving them any stars at all. 
 
Another thing I noticed while there: 
There was a couple sitting at a table next to the bar having lunch. The wife of the couple had to keep coming up to the bar to order food or drinks and to even ask for the check because the waiter wasn&#39;t doing his job. 

I would really like to come back to try the food again because the menu looks really awesome but they need to train their staff better or something because I have never felt so unwanted at a restaurant before. And make sure your dishes are actually being washed... Lipstick. Ew."

Got the pint - cheap a** small pint for $6. Ordered onion straws which were tasty - breaded, deep fried &amp; served w spicy sauce. Then ordered the flat bread - queue the scary music - which looked OK when it arrived. Lots of chunks of veggies including cubes of fresh mozzarella. Was looking for melted cheese. Sauce was balsamic vinegar. This is key because that&#39;s what wound up on my shirt on the first bite
 The g*ddamn chunks fell right off the flatbread because there was nothing to hold them on. Whatever it was, vegetable chunk or mozzarella cube, absorbed just enough balsamic vinegar then followed the law of gravity to make a nice big stain on my shirt.  On the first bite! The only way to eat it without stuff falling was to hold the flat bread perfectly level. Even then a bite sent chunks everywhere. After 2nd bite i quit and ordered the steak chunks. I couldnt take another stain on my shirt! The steak chunks came with guess what? More onion strings except no sauce this time. The blackened steak chunks were tasty but the whole dish was so dry! Plus bare - steak chunks &amp; onion strings. Could use at least some garnish - maybe a leaf of lettuce? So overall OK but for the cheap a** pints and the ninja flatbread. If management reads this i challenge them to eat the flatbread wearing a dress shirt and a tie.  And no bib! Good luck."

We got there and it was completely empty, that should have been a big hint.  My wife and I both ordered the $5 burgers.  My wife also ordered the French onion soup.  That came out fine.  Her burger came out cold, and mine was not made I ordered.  In addition there was an extremely long wait time for the food.  These were burgers it shouldn&#39;t take longer than 8 minutes!  When my burger finally came correct it was about 30 minutes later.  I was never even asked if I wanted a second beer.  Bad service in the kitchen they are extremely slow, and even let people walk through to go to the bathroom.  We will never be back.  Naperville is a community where people make great money and the majority of restaurants and bars get that.  Tommy Nevins does not and it appears it won&#39;t be open much longer due to lack of customers we saw on a Saturday night 


Perhaps the most concerning aspect of this review is the lack of any response from Tommy Nevins.   I have seen an individual from Tommy Nevins respond to several reviews but not this one.   Evidently they think this type of poor service is acceptable"

We came at lunch time, seating was quick. The service was fair, although the complimentary bread came after our main meal was served. It was nice and quiet. The menu is huge and has a good size &#34;Irish&#34; type offerings. I tried the boxty - but it was not what I had imagined it to be. It was definitely filling. The beef stroganoff was decent. Will have to visit again to try the other choices."

This was my third try at Tommy Nevin&#39;s, after two previous visits that I would have rated 1 or 2 stars, but this was the worst of the three.

Today, we were seated in a booth along the back wall. In the 15 minutes or so that went by without anyone coming to at least take a drink order, we saw one table (that was seated after us) order their food, and another table get served. So after we saw the waiter come onto the floor twice without acknowledging us, then disappearing for another 6-7 minutes, we moved ourselves to the bar so that we could actually receive some service. We told the lady at the front who seated us, and she apologized. After reading all of the other reviews on here, that seems to be a common theme.

At the bar, we ordered a water and a Diet Coke. The Diet Coke that came out of the bar soda gun looked nothing like Diet Coke - it was light brown and flat, almost like iced tea. The bartender tried a sip, made a face, and dumped it. He just laughed and asked, &#34;Do you want something else?&#34; During our meal, we saw a staff member come in with 12-packs of different sodas that I assume they just ran out to buy, because something was wrong. The other times I was here, someone I was with was served a different beer than he ordered, and the second time I went, they were out of two beers on tap I wanted. So unfortunately, drink issues have been a problem every time here.

Finally, the Chicken Spinach Melt I ordered was good, at least the half that had chicken on it. I had to take two full bites into both halves of my sandwich before there was any chicken. Four full bites of just bread and cheese. At least the fried cream cheese balls we got for an appetizer were good, because that&#39;s the reason we went.

So, yeah, not coming back."

I really like their &#39;meat &amp; potatoes&#39; style menu.  They also have a huge starters (app&#39;s) section.  From their regular menu I&#39;d recommend the Ballybunion Club or Bourbon BBQ Salmon.  Both are hearty plates, decent serving sizes and fresh food.  Price-wise I&#39;d say they&#39;re very comparable to most restaurants in their genre.  Based on at least ten visits I would also vouch for good service on the restaurant side.  Or as my dad would tell you, this is one of the few places where the waitress remembers to put the slice of lime in his Diet Coke.  I&#39;m at 3.5 stars here.  You can&#39;t go wrong with the food.

The tables were set up very nice last night as well which we&#39;ve never seen before. Only reason I give Tommy Nevin&#39;s 4 stars is because their food is inconsistent.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, the food is pretty tasty, drinks are good, and I&#39;ve experienced some ok service as well. However, nothing really stands out here...except for my first experience here.

St Patrick&#39;s Day, 2011. We were new to the area, and our friends all wanted to come here. On a whim, I called two weeks before St. Patty&#39;s Day and asked if they&#39;d take reservations. I was told yes, even after questioning several times, and was told to rest assured that our spot would be saved. I made reservations for 15 people...yes one-five...and happily exclaimed my plans to all of my friends. We arrived ten minutes early and were told - nope. No reservations are taken on St. Patrick&#39;s Day. I calmly said, surely there is a mistake, I made reservations weeks ago. &#34;Nope.&#34; I was rudely, no, rude isn&#39;t even a strong enough word - HORRIBLY turned down. And the place was packed (re: why I reserved tables). I was shaking I was so mad. I told them I had  15 people, but they clearly didn&#39;t care, so we took our business elsewhere.

This experience, and the multiple rude people (hostess, manager, etc) that I dealt with that night left a taste so bad in my mouth, my husband was shocked when I agreed to go back with a Groupon. Again - everything is good here. Just good. If you have a deal, definitely go. Otherwise, there&#39;s better English food in the area!"

Arrived at about 12:30 and, seeing all the empty tables, I knew this would be a bad experience.  And they did not prove me wrong.

For 34.95, the selection was sparse. Scrambled eggs were hard.  Ham was dried out as it had been sitting in the serving station too long.  There were two empty bowls of cocktail sauce near the shrimp and I had to suggest they add product.  Croissant rolls were hard.

I have to say the prime rib was good!

But the service was bad, too.  Rarely came to refill coffee. We had piles of dirty plates on our table.  And maybe I am being too picky but servers in T-shirts?  On Mother&#39;s Day?  When they are charging $34.95?  And then they add 20% gratuity!  At a substandard buffet brunch.  Drury Lane is $40.  And a far better value.  I will never go back.  Neither should you."

We came here for an early dinner after the Naperville Winter Ale Fest.  I&#39;m assuming they didn&#39;t expect to get a crowd in from there after the fest or something because it seemed like they were short handed or we just had a slow waitress.
We ordered the cream cheese balls for an appetizer and they were awesome cream cheese balls filled with bacon.

I had the amazing &#34;Royale With Cheese&#34; Pulp-Fiction Style...it was SO good!!!  And for a side I got tater tots.  My friend ordered the corned beef and that too was super tasty! There was no fat on it at all...I would definitely go back for that alone.

That should have been a warning but we didn&#39;t think about it at the time. What a mistake.  From items listed on the website that are no longer served to incompetent servers this place needs to either replace their management team or just close and put it out of its misery. We ordered the nachos to start off with. No flavor, cheese that looked and tasted like cheese wiz not the &#34;beer cheese&#34; that the server said it would be. Chips were not fresh and the jalapeños weren&#39;t even spicy, like they sat around for a few days. Next up was fish and chips which, at an English Pub, you would think would be outstanding. Not so much. No seasoning, no flavor. Really disappointing. Also had the buffalo burger with bacon. Again no seasoning, no flavor.

My friend had cheese curds. Nice warm food for cold night! 4 stars for great service,  refills and great food. I ate here before few years ago and had great experience with server and great food. Seems they changed the menu since last time I was here. Next time I am in burger mood I will definely try their different protein burger selections from chicken, beef, bison and what others I forgot. Alot customization is possible even offers gluten free bun or even pretzel bun which I always like with my burger. Thumbs up for that ability to customize unlike some places!

Tried the cream cheese balls, didn&#39;t have much flavor to it.

The Irish dip was not bad. Roast beef sandwich with aujus.. The best part of the meal was the potato chips..fried and sprinkled with Lawry&#39;s seasoning. You can&#39;t really mess that up.

Beef and lamb stew was ok, meat was a little tough.

Irish coffee = disappointing. Apparently Chili&#39;s has a better one.

Our server took our order. As I guess he forgot about us, cuz 10 mins later he asked if we were ready to order..so I guess he forgot to tell the kitchen.. so we waited a much longer time for our food, and we were sitting in the booth closest to the kitchen too.

In the recent months (not sure exactly when) they&#39;ve changed the menu to be &#34;simpler&#34;, yet the quality of the food as degraded quiet a bit. 

The last 2 occasions, they were out of some Irish staples like Lamb Stew- you&#39;d think an Irish pub would not be consistently &#34;out&#34; of Irish food. Last time, I got the Shepard&#39;s pie and noticed it was very dry. I asked the waitress to bring me a side of the gravy which is suppose to be in the pie. She came back and said they were out of it. I then realized that the &#34;chef&#34; made my Shepard&#39;s pie without an essential ingredient and just hoped I&#39;d be too stupid to notice. The poor waitress realized what had happened, and tried to help me but there wasn&#39;t much she could do. On another occasion, my order was messed up twice before I finally got my entree. No one offered even a 10% discount for the unacceptable wait. I could have made the argument that my meal should have been paid for, but I was happier to not waste another minute and move on with my life.

Full story: Ordered a veggie burger.  Was delivered a turkey burger.  When I pointed out the difference, our server checked with the chef who assured her it was a veggie burger. 

So I was presented with the bill -- paid in full and tipped as customary.  Then asked for the manager -- told me it was a veggie burger.  From where I asked -- and was told US Foods.  I also told the manager it was terrible.  He offered to take it off the bill (already paid) and I declined.  Mostly because he wasn&#39;t listening.

So I checked from home -- US Foods web site -- it was not a veggie burger (they have a 3 grain veggie burger -- with visible corn and beans -- not the same as was delivered to me).  Rather, the burger I was presented was a turkey burger -- off white/ slightly brown in appearance.  

So moral of the story -- will never, ever eat here again."

We ordered the pretzels.  I like my pretzels a little denser and not so light and fluffy.  Actually they were more like bread sticks than pretzels. The were okay but I&#39;ve had better.  The spicy whiskey mustard dipping sauce for the pretzels was really good.  I ordered the pub salad.  It&#39;s a generous sized salad served with warm bread.  It was missing the asparagus and had way too much red onion otherwise a good salad.  My dining companion order the Blarney Bacon Burger which he really enjoyed.  His only complaint was the french fries were greasy, soggy and disappointing.  We both like fries that are crispy.  

The beer menu is decent.  We had IPA&#39;s with the pretzels and then switched to $4.00 Guinness pints that were on special.  The service was okay.  I was expecting it to be more of an Irish Pub and not so much regular pub food."

Whenever we needed another beer, the bartender was no where to be found because he was standing talking with his friends or flirting with the waitresses.  The only upside is that the side we were on had a private birthday party going on and I think they added some of our beers to their bill.  I guess it makes up for the numerous times they have overcharged me for beers at Nevin&#39;s Brewing Company.   Plus, they had one side of the bar closed down for a birthday party.  They wanted to show some dumb video of old TV shows and commercials (REALLY?!?!) while the NCAA Basketball Final Four was playing.  They shut all the TV&#39;s off except one so they can sit there and watch old sitcoms and commercials.  

Another time my son went in with his teammates and coaches.  He waited an hour and a half for his food and it never came out.  Got up and left.  

If you&#39;re coming in for a beer, don&#39;t expect good service, let alone any service.  It is a shame because this used to be our go to place, but the service has gone downhill so bad, it is tough to go in there."

I knew I&#39;d be passing by Tommy Nevin&#39;s on my way home so made a mental picture of how good a pint would taste. And I mean I could feel it as I motored into the parking lot, which was packed as always though it was only 3 pm on a Friday. 

I go in to the bar which is only 40% full as the patio area was packed, grab a seat at the bar, make eye contact with the bartender and then pffffttt....nothing. For one, two, three, four and more than five minutes. Nothing. The bartender vanished to the other side of the bar where he did not serve anyone but put glasses away and chatted with the other bartender who was off shift. Not cool. 

Finally he saunters over and takes my order. The beer was fine. But the service horrible. 

As for the food, I ordered the smoked salmon flatbread. Mixed review on this one. The flatbread was cooked but not crispy; kind of like a Boboli out of the bag but not run through the oven. It shoud have been toasty and crispy but it was neither. The topping of smoked salmon, cilantro and tomatoes with a drizzle of something that tasted like it may have been sour cream was good but it required more flavor. I added some Tabasco and it was okay. If the flatbread had been grilled over a flame and crisped up the dish may have rocked. 

I&#39;ll give Nevin&#39;s another shot because the bartender getting off shift when I arrived was fine to look at and seemed like she might know what she was doing."

As soon as we sat down the server told us they were out of CO2 and could not serve pop until  we waited for them to get back from the store with cans!  We put our order in and it took far to long.  This was odd to me given the place was empty! Anyway, they brought our food and the buffalo wrap I had was good, but the fries were these little tiny pieces that looked like they were left over from another meal. My daughter had the chicken BLT, which she liked, but the same issue with the fries! I also ordered a red sangria that had way to much ice and had very little fruit. My fault for ordering a Spanish drink in an Irish pub I guess? Overall I gave it two stars instead of one because the main meal was ok.  I have been there before and it was better then.  I do not plan on going back and do not recommend this place anymore.  Too bad as it was a nice place at one time!"

The first visit was delicious and the service was terrific but after coming in last night, I won&#39;t be coming back because of our rude server. She acted as if she had to leave and kept bothering us when we were going to sign our bill. Everyone that knows me by now knows how service is the one of the most important components of eating out. 

I hate to give this place only two stars because of our rude server but the food was quite delicious I have to say. My friend and I ordered their cream cheese balls which was heaven to my mouth; it  consisted of cream cheese with bacon bits fried in little balls... Then as my main entree, I ordered their chicken spinach melt and honestly, I didn&#39;t even finish it because I was already so full from those savory cream cheese balls!"
tommy-nevins-pub-naperville-2,Christa F.,VVyIz8Z73MU9RbZA_JoyRA,"Wheaton, IL",1,1,0,46,185,Kjd4yuNHYQx6XlSsG5nE_w,2.0,2012-03-27,"Wow Tommy... WTF happened to you?!  I realize that it&#39;s been a few years since we&#39;ve seen each other and maybe I haven&#39;t exactly missed you... But... WOW!!!!  Just wow...

My entire life has consisted of finding the best Irish Pubs, the perfect pour, the tastiest cider, the most delectable Celtic fare, a place where people don&#39;t necessarily remember me, but always treat me like one of their own even if I haven&#39;t been there in a while.  Someday I&#39;ll open my own place... 

I moved here in 2005.  A couple years later I found Tommy when he was still new, pretty, and exciting.  The service came with a smile and the food was even good!  I took friends there a few times and he was even a stop on my First Annual St. Patrick&#39;s Day Pub Crawl!

Tommy quickly fell off my lineup though... The service and clientele has gone downhill.  Everyone is in such a hurry to do something or go somewhere that service is no longer personalized to you.  Refills get forgotten and orders are frequently confused.  It used to be nice that the bar and family dining are separated.  Now, no matter where you go, it&#39;s loud, rowdy, and you can&#39;t hear the person next to you trying to talk to you.  The &#34;new&#34; clientele seems to be douchey!  They won&#39;t hesitate to bump into you or push you out of the way when just walking by or to get a bar seat or table even though you&#39;ve clearly been waiting longer. 

The boy wanted to take me to meet some friends of his recently.  We thought this was a good central location and I figured that some of the issues they had the last time I had been there would&#39;ve been cleared up.  Boy, was I wrong!

We sat in the family dining area purposely this time so we could hear the conversation between the 4 of us, but that didn&#39;t work like we had planned!  We had to talk pretty loud to hear each other and we had a long conversation before our waitress finally came over to take our drink orders.  We went ahead and gave her our appetizer order while she was there since it seemed as though it might be a slow night!

We received our drinks we got our appetizer and when she came back to take our dinner orders... Eh, ok whatever.  The Spinach &amp; Artichoke Dip wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve ever had.  It was pretty oily and liquidy.  There weren&#39;t nearly enough Garlic Toast Points to finish off the dip with.  Maybe it was because the dip was so thin... I dunno, but it&#39;s not something I&#39;ll get here again!

The boy ordered a Classic Pub Burger with Cheddar Cheese and added Bacon and a side of Hand Cut Fries.  He asked that there be nothing else on the burger.  Of course, it came complete with a salad on top!  He just tossed it aside as usual when people don&#39;t listen to him.  He said that all in all it was just ok, nothing to write home about, but not terrible.  He is a burger junky and seriously tries to order them wherever we go!  If it&#39;s nothing special... It&#39;s REALLY nothing special...

I had the Corned Beef &amp; Swiss sandwich with a side of Seasoned Fries... Tommy&#39;s secret recipe should really just be kept secret!  The corned beef was fatty and stringy!  This was the worst representation of an American Irish tradition I&#39;ve ever eaten!  At this point we&#39;ve seen the waitress twice though... It&#39;s been a while and we wanted a second adult beverage (or 5!), but we knew we weren&#39;t getting one!  I didn&#39;t bother sending the sandwich back.  I just ate the fries and waited until I found the right moment to flag her down for our checks.  

It&#39;s really a good thing we were there for the company more than anything else.  The atmosphere, the food, and the service have gone so far downhill over the years that Tommy has become a major disappointment!  Tommy, you&#39;ve been removed from my little black book!"

The atmosphere definitely has a good &#34;buzz&#34; going on, so don&#39;t be fooled by the full parking -- the restaurant is pretty spacious and is ideal for groups.

I recommend the Jalapeño Cheddar stuffed burger with fresh cut fries.

For a bite, or a Lite, give it a try."

Pleasant surprise when we walked in, the place is warm and inviting, not like other pubs. Half lit and half dim. The bar is pretty big and they have plenty of seating. 

Anyways, the friends decided to check this place out for their gluten free menu. That&#39;s always a plus! Not to mention their regular menu, very extensive. I&#39;ll have to make the drive to check out some pub grub.

I tried their chocolate chip cookie with vanilla bean ice cream....downerrrrr. The cookie was too hard that I got tired of stabbing it and left it. The ice cream was good though, that didn&#39;t need to be stabbed. ;)"

They have a good beer selection, although I have yet to try any of the Nevins beers. We have sat at the bar each time and have always had great service.

But I wasn&#39;t prepared to be let down like I was.

The beer menu is nothing to write home about, so we just went with a Guiness. They&#39;ll have your standard Shock Top, Smithwicks, Heineken, Blue Moon, and Harp, like every bar has. They did have Two Brothers and a Stone IPA, for the craft enthusiasts, but nothing that you felt incredibly compelled to order because of its uniqueness.

We ordered the sampler platter to start, which had some &#34;steak bites&#34; (literally pieces of steak cooked well), some time of corned beef taquito, wings, cheese balls (cream cheese and bacon, breaded and fried...not as incredible as you&#39;d think), and onion straws. The food wasn&#39;t bad, but it just tasted bland. I&#39;m glad it came with four dipping sauces.

I ordered a fish sandwich w/steamed veggies and my husband ordered a bowl of french onion soup with a side of tater tots. The fish sandwich was very large and plentiful, served on a ciabatta roll with tarter sauce, lettuce, tomato (standard). It was so large that I did not finish it. Partially because I was full on the Guiness and appetizer, but also because it was just ok. Definitely not the worst, but certainly not the best. It had a spongey texture. But it was huge, so I&#39;ll give them props for that, because there&#39;s nothing I hate more than ordering a fish sandwich and getting something that is fast-food sized. The steamed veggies had nothing on them...no butter, no salt, no pepper, nothing. If I wanted to have microwaved plain veggies, I could go buy a bag at the grocery store and accomplish the literal exact same flavor. My husband&#39;s soup tasted pretty good for a few bites....TONS of cheese, which may have contributed to its oily flavor/texture. He commented on the oiliness after a few bites, and I thought he was crazy. But he pushed it away from his place setting after eating half and said he couldn&#39;t eat anymore without feeling like garbage. I attempted to eat more of it and quickly realized after a few bites what he was getting at. It was a bit heavy. It didn&#39;t taste bad, but something needs to be scaled back. Oh, and the tots were good. 

After three beers, an appetizer, a sandwich, soup, and side, the meal was about $53. Not bad for a dinner out with drinks. We didn&#39;t take any of our leftovers home, because we decided that we had no desire to continue eating our food. The dream was over. We were full, but not very satisfied. Truthfully, everything tasted like it was frozen and not fresh, like chain restaurant food but slightly worse. This spawned a heated debate between my husband and I in the car ride home, about what constitutes as a chain restaurant (more than 1 location? 3 locations? 10 locations? What is the true definition?). It was the meatiest part of our night.

There was ample room for people...there was no wait for 7:30pm on a Wednesday night, in fact there was plenty of room. Our server was attentive and friendly, the noise was fine, so no complaints on service or ambiance. Truthfully, the bar next-door looked very happening. In the future, I could remember this for a get-together. They did have a decent whiskey selection...I guess I would hope so, for an Irish pub."

We went there last week, our table was approximately 6-8 people, so you&#39;d think there&#39;d be some attention to the needs of such a big table.......... well if you did, YOU THOUGHT WRONG. We ordered as many rounds of drinks directly from the bar as we did from our extremely overwhelmed waitress.  We had to, when you wait over 10 minutes for your waitress to come around and she never does.............

One person at the table was drinking their special beer on tap, I think it was Stella.  Well, after about 3 of them he was informed they ran out and he had to order something else.  

My wife is pregnant and called ahead to see if they had non alcoholic beer, such as Sharps or the like.  They informed her they did and with that, we made the plans to go out.  She ordered one and on the next round was informed they were out and she would have to order something else.  She said no problem....&#34;what other non alcoholic beer do you carry&#34;?......... to the response of &#34;NONE&#34;,....... did i mention the we called ahead and my wife is pregnant and that we chose this place because they informed us over the phone they had non alcoholic beer for my wife??!!!!!!!!!!

If i didn&#39;t know better, I would say they place was having financial hardship; they were running out of things left and right and it didn&#39;t seem they had adequate staff scheduled to handle the customers and it wasn&#39;t super busy.  It just seemed like a business that was completely out of sorts and really made no attempts throughout the night to fix it.  In my opinion, when a table is consistently ordering from the bar, it&#39;s a big indication our server needed help and it never came.

Every single person at our table all vowed to never come back here, it was that ridiculous."

I haven&#39;t really had anything bad from this place (except the soups aren&#39;t anything to rave about). Everything i order is great. Fish sandwich is good, Pot roast Boxty is amazing. Calamari is amazing, not too chewy, just right (it includes some tentacle pieces so if you are squeamish stay away!). I haven&#39;t anything bad to say about this place. 

I have read a lot of reviews that complain about terrible service but I have never ever had an issue with that. I used to work in a restaurant and I understand things get busy. I feel like the majority of people who leave Yelp reviews end up complaining about the service while they haven&#39;t an understanding of how things operate in a restaurant. I do give more leniency to places especially when I notice that they are slammed. If they are busy, just understand that it is probably for a good reason. 

Drinks are very nice, and made well. Especially the long islands! They have some decent drink specials throughout the week and also food specials. 

Go forth and give Tommy Nevins a shot. Unless you&#39;re a babbling baby and then go to some other location that you can complain about."

We had to park in the neighboring parking lot, no big deal for us, but just to draw an image of how busy they get.

We were told 45 minutes of waiting or we can eat at the bar, we opted to wait, and had drinks in the waiting area.  When we were seated (about 20 min), our waitress was polite and was eager to share what she liked on the menu.  My husband had a Reuben and I went for the prime rib (yummm) and were were happy with the service and price.

Some cons: The route to the bathroom is a bit intrusive in my opinion. You have to trek through the kitchen if you are seating on the left side of the dining room.  Also the table layout looks as though my 2 year old was in charge of that.  Usually larger booth tables are against the wall and then smaller tables, it was opposite of that.  

Some other points: It gets LOUD!  I was sitting next to my hubs and felt like I was screaming.

We won&#39;t be back for dinner unless we go with a large group but we might go for a lunch or mid day meal!"

This place has never really been exceptional but now it has really reached a new low. The food is ok but the part that really gets me is that it is a pig sty. Booths are filthy , seats full of old food, walls in the booths are dusty food splashed on them - no telling how long since they were washed. And then the flying critters - gnats, mosquito or something. And the service is a second thought and not very friendly , no personality. It could be so much better if any one who runs it had a clue. Felt like the inmates were running the asylum. Who&#39;s in charge ? Replace them"

A gaudy, large and loud looking establishment right off of the ever busy Rte 59 sits a fine little Irish pub. This fine little pub casts no judgment and is home to a full dining room, a bar and a back bar room where if you want to play darts like you&#39;re an international pro...key words to remember...there&#39;s no judging. 

I made the journey in on a weekend afternoon looking for something small for lunch and a drink. The more important piece was the drink, but food always is a friendly companion. Inside you are immediately greeted by the host (ess) and given the availability can choose on which side of the joint you want to dine and drink. For this visit, we sat in a big, dark booth that was comfortable and in perfect view of the many flat screens. Welcome to football season where golf and nascar get the big eff you.

The staff came round quickly to drop off the menus which are quite full and unexpected for such a place. Expect to find pub grub but also themed pub grub. Bangers and Mash...it&#39;s on the menu. Bread Pudding...on the menu. Others include large and filling sandwiches and a wide variety of salads.

Kind of glad it took ages to pop the Tommy Nevins cherry. When we came it was quiet, but there is definite potential that this would be a fun place to rock a beer or a jack d shot on a night out. Prices are reasonable but what sold me is the overall vibe inside.

Chilled to the max. Sit down, shut up and have a pint."

It wasn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve been there and it defiantly won&#39;t be the last. I love the ambience of this place. It&#39;s a home away from home. I love the decor!

We have been there plenty of times and have never had a problem with the service. Every server we have had is always really friendly. 
Since I have been there many times I do try to change what I get to keep it fresh. I have never been disappointed with my selections.  They do have pretty good drink specials durning the week, I lately have been getting the long islands they are really tasty!

There were only like 3 groups of people in the restaurant when we arrived at prime lunchtime.  That should of been our clue to run for the hills!  You would have thought that the service would have been faster due to the lack of customers and more attentive, but it was like a ghost town in there!

We ordered the cheese balls which sounded like they should be delicious, but they were nasty and came with some unidentifiable dipping sauce....marinara? cocktail sauce? ketchup?  The balls were basically all cream cheese and lacked the other ingredients as stated in the menu description.  I ordered the corned beef and Swiss cheese on marble rye.  The bread was super greasy like it was sitting on the griddle in a  pile of grease.  The cheese was a giant glob on the sandwich and the corned beef was cold!  Not really sure how they heated my warm sandwich and the corned beef was neither shaved or thin as stated on the menu.  I also ordered the seasoned fries with my meal and they were soggy.  Some of the fries were hot and some were cold!  They were also kind of greasy and the seasoning was nasty!  It was like someone dropped a shaker full of seasoned salt on them.  The other sandwiches that my family had were just as bad....my husband had the steak sandwich which did not impress him as even being steak!  My son tried the American favorite macaroni and cheese.  Whatever the one cheese was in the dish had bite and had a strange aftertaste.....it also had a glob of melted cheese across the top of the dish!  Maybe if you are coming for traditional Irish beer and you are super intoxicated the food is worth the trip.  Otherwise the bar area and dining area were cool looking, but the food is terrible....don&#39;t let the cute exterior lure you in!"

The service at the Frankfort location is better, but this one is closer to my house so I come here more.

Brought my kids in for lunch on a weekend after soccer games.  The place was pretty empty, so we got seated right away.  Our waiter was a real nice guy. I always appreciate when a waiter is nice to my kids and won&#39;t show disdain for two young kids with Dad :)  The ordering process was fine, but when it came to get our appetizer, things went downhill.  I ordered the loaded potato soup, and the kids wanted the basket of chips.  The soup never came out and the chips ended up being a basket of french fries.

I ordered the french dip, and we had one order of mac and cheese and one hot dog.  Of course, order envy set in and the kid with the hot dog wanted the mac and cheese.  So I ordered a second mac and cheese, and waited.  And waited some more.  In fact, we waited about 20 minutes for the 2nd order of mac and cheese.  We did finally get it, but it was awfully long in coming out. 

I guess my frustration was that when the check came, there was a charge for the soup, along with charges for the 3 kids meals.  I mean, you&#39;d think since I never got my soup I wouldn&#39;t be charged.  Even better, since I ended up having to order a 3rd kids meal, maybe they could have comped me for either missing the soup or for the wait on the 2nd order of mac and cheese.  I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m just being picky but I think it would have been a nice gesture on their part.  After all, what&#39;s an order of kids mac and cheese cost?  Maybe .50?  They charge $5 for it, so the margin is healthy.

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back as I like the food and the bar is fun, I just wish they could get the kitchen act together."

My husband was the first to say how bad his food was and I quickly agreed along with the same from the kids.  We are not picky people and genuinely just enjoy not having to make dinner.  I actually thought the food was so bad I had to write a review.  We will not be back.

Cheese balls definitely had cream cheese, not enough of anything else. The corned beef on the Reuben was very good but all balled up in the center of the bread (not spread out evenly), the rye wasn&#39;t toasted enough either. I would have liked Dijon mustard with it but I didn&#39;t see the bartender again until I was done. Seasoned fries were soggy and not hot. 

Over all disappointing, we won&#39;t be back."

Finally tried them out on a Friday night last week a little after 6pm for dinner with the boyfriend. Not too bad on the wait I think it was about a 15-20 minute wait. Sat at the bar and had a drink while we waited. A LITTLE high on the drinks we had if you ask me but MAYBE that is Naperville? We got seated in a both against the wall which was a bit private. That was nice. I just had to have them wipe down the table though because it was a bit sticky. 

Looked at the menu to see what I could actually eat. Decided to have a burger with the peppered bacon (no bun) and a side Caesar salad. Not too bad. I actually liked it. Now not sure yet if I would take the drive back out again to try something else.

I think I was just too hung up on the layout and a bit too many loud kids that night. I think since the building is SO pretty I thought the inside would be just as nice but it was a typical restaurant/bar TO ME. 

Maybe I need to try them on a Saturday night when they have music. I hear they do. Do they??

My food is never what I order or cooked to what I ask for. They&#39;re completely understaffed; last time I ate there (dec. 20) it took 4 of us an hour and a half to eat lunch at 2:00 in the afternoon! The drinks were wrong, the food orders were wrong and it took about 20 minutes to ask for our check and pay it. The server was busy running around with other tables so it was understandable but extremely frustrating. Probably wont be returning for the food anytime soon.

We ordered the $15.99 mixed platter of appetizer.  OK.  Not great.  The cheese balls were delicious.  The beef pieces were awful - too much garlic and tough.

I ordered corned beef and cabbage; husband ordered fish and chips; other lady ordered grilled chicken and rice; other man ordered the Irish sampler plate.

My corned beef and cabbage was TERRIBLE!  The meat was good.  However, the vegetables tasted like my husband&#39;s mother (terrible Irish cook) boiled them for 4 hours in about a tub of water.  There was no spice or salt added.  I didn&#39;t even eat the veggies.

My husband&#39;s fish and chips looked awful - fries were limp and cool.  Culver&#39;s serves much better fish and chips for 1/2 the cost!

The other lady in our group thought our waiter was surly.  When we were leaving we saw that EVERY OTHER TABLE HAD BREAD and we did not get any, despite spending about $100.00.  We didn&#39;t ask for it, but we should have gotten it.

Atmosphere is alcohol-centered, punky-yuppie sports bar with below average pub food.  It is about as Irish as McDonald&#39;s is Scottish.  Irish in name only.

DO NOT GO!

The noise level was VERY VERY LOUD.  This was at 5pm.  Wondered what it was like on St. Patrick&#39;s evening."

As Irish as this place seems, there are some food items that do not seem so Irish, such as BBQ Ribs and BLT Sandwiches. However, if you stick to the comfort food section of the menu, that is where you are going to find the most Irish-esque food. I recommend the Shepherd&#39;s Pie and the Bangers and Colcannon items. The Bangers and Colcannon consists of Irish sausages and colcannon potatoes, both of which are loaded with flavor. Honestly, the rest of the menu does not seem that Irish, but given I am not Irish, I may not be the best judge of authenticity at this establishment. REGARDLESS, the food they make here is awesome. 

It is a great place to chill. They have a pretty solid beer selection, and for those who need gluten-free food, they have a section in their menu that adheres to your needs. 

Overall not a bad place, but the place seems REALLY Irish without having a full-blown Irish food selection."

3 Husband liked burger. I got corn beef sandwich very dry, Pickle best of meal. 
4 Last straw /bill $2.60 had nothing smaller than $20. Waitress says do you want any change back? No I want to give you  almost a $20  tip. for lousy service.

This place is huge. It looks big from the outside, but even bigger in. The setting is very standard and very Americanized quasi Irish pub, hardly authentic.

For a place that advertises itself as an Irish pub, there are surprisingly few options for Irish fare. There were the standard bangers &amp; mash and of course shepards pie, but it didn&#39;t go much farther. I did have a non-deep fried monte christo type sandwich which was amazing and the other girls seemed pretty happy with their choices as well. The seasoned fries weren&#39;t all that impressive. They were all short and a little over done. 

The server was nice, but extremely slow. We shared a few jokes about what she could be doing as she walked right past us without stopping but two or three times. The prices are ok, 7.99 for the sandwich and reasonable drink prices. It&#39;s a nice place to hang out, but for authentic Irish and good service, go elsewhere."

They have a nice outdoor seating section too. They have a section where bands play but as I said it&#39;s big enough that you dont have to be drowned out in conversation by bad cover versions of songs you wish you never loved if you dont want to.

My wife and I had been here a few times before but had only ever stayed on the bar side. So beyond a few appetizers we hadn&#39;t really explored the menu. This time we went specifically for a nice, sit down dinner. We weren&#39;t disappointed.

STARTER: We started off with the &#34;Warm Artisan Pretzels&#34; which were done differently than we had expected. They weren&#39;t overly seasoned and they weren&#39;t at all salted. It was just good-tasting bread with beer cheese and spicy brown mustard dipping sauces.

MAIN COURSE: The presentation of the food is as enticing as the food is good.  You almost don&#39;t want to eat it at first, as you will destroy the layout.  My wife indulged in the &#34;Guinness Beef Tips&#34; which she really enjoyed.  I was waffling between a few items and finally settled on the &#34;Mum&#39;s Best Toasty&#34;. The title says it all and the moniker &#34;Grilled Cheese on Steroids&#34; might not be as appetizing. Creamy guyere and parmesan cheeses oozed out from between thickly sliced sourdough bread not only toasted but with cheddar, gouda, and provolone cheeses baked into the outer faces. Tomato bisque was included for dipping and is definetly needed to break the sometimes overpowering flavor of the sandwich. The idea of grilled cheese and tomato soup has been done a hundred times before but not quite like this.

ATMOSPHERE: No matter how contrived the exterior looks, the interior is much more tastefully done. The layout is simple but effective and allows those not into watching sports and schmoozing with fellow patrons to enjoy a nice, peaceful meal.

SERVICE: Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and accomodating.  What more do you need to know?

Now that I know what I was missing with the dinner menu, rest assured that I won&#39;t miss it ever again."

It&#39;s located in a faux-victorian strip mall in the far flung reaches of southwestern Naperville on Route 59. Sure they serve some drinks and stereotypically Irish/UK fare, but if it is authenticity you are after, do yourself a favor and get the heck off of Route 59!

#2 This place DOES have some great food. I&#39;m a sucker for appetizers, and this place has a couple of delicious ones. We ordered the harp strings (beer battered onion rings, sliced into quarters so you get little inch-long fried onion goodness) and the cream cheese balls (cream cheese rolled into balls with bacon and scallions, and deep fried). If I wanted authentic Irish, I would have been pissed, but because I wanted good food regardless of where it came from, I was happy.

For dinner I had the very un-Irish BBQ Rib and Popcorn Shrimp platter. Delicious. The ribs were tasty, sweet, and fall-off-the-bone tender. The shrimp were nice and plump, and crunchy without being overly breaded.

My daughter (almost 3) had the chicken fingers and loved them (she&#39;s a very finicky eater), my wife had the fish and chips and enjoyed it, and my mom had some sort of corned beef and swiss sandwich I think. There were no complaints.

Desert was good, but seemed better on paper than in the execution. I had the Bailey&#39;s creme brulee, and my wife had the cookie sundae (which was big enough for about 4 people... seriously). Both were good, but not great. We attributed this to the fact that there was a little too much Bailey&#39;s going on in the sundae (could have benefited from a scoop or two of vanilla in addition to all the Bailey&#39;s ice cream), and the creme brulee as also lacking a little something. 

So there you have it. If  you&#39;ve ever been to the Claim Jumper, it&#39;s a bit like that, but with an Irish theme instead of a western theme. Seeing as how this place is smack dab in between our house and my mom&#39;s house, we&#39;re probably going to be meeting here often... which won&#39;t be such a bad thing."

There extensive menu is one to see. They have your normal Irish/comfort food along with other unique sandwiches and appetizers.
 
    The BBQ Gouda melt is a must. Grilled chicken, melted Gouda cheese, BBQ sauce(fantastic) on a pretzel bun with your choice of Fries, Season fries, veggies, fruit, coleslaw,or baked beans. 
 My favorite appetizers would be the spring rolls, bruschetta, dublin publettes and the steak bites. I&#39;ve yet to find a place that serves tiny pieces of steak, perfectly seasoned as an app. 

  The staff are amazing. The waitresses in the bar have kilt skirts with black socks and black shirts. Everyone matches and is in uniform. It is very easy to spot those working. The dining room side is an all black uniform. The bartenders are in all black as well. Very friendly staff. I noticed a lot of customers come back as often as I do. That must say something about the place.
  
   They also have a private room which they call the Library. The library is a great place to hold parties. (Birthdays, wedding showers or even business meetings)
   
   The patio is a great place to hang out during the summer.  One night out there is was a little cold but our waitress turned on their heaters and it was perfect. 
  
   I also noticed many golfers come over because it is right next to the Tamarack course. They hold a TOMMY NEVINS golf outing every year.
I have also participated in their bag tournaments ( held during the summer) 

   They have drink specials everyday. Also, they have food specials over the weekend. They are not your normal food specials. They really seem to take their time when choosing them. You can&#39;t go wrong with ordering a special.( They have great wines to pair with their meals as well) :)

   The parking lot is a little small but you can always find parking in the strip mall next door.

   One thing that really impressed me is that they have no problem calling a cab to take you home. I&#39;ve seen people leave their cars in the lot and the bar tender called a cab company and they were safely brought home. 

   If you are looking for a place to have drinks, dinner, watch UFC, watch sports, make new friends or celebrate a birthday I definitely recommend Tommy Nevins."

I&#39;ve had the fried egg burger on a prior visit and really enjoyed it, but this time my friends tried their wings with bbq sauce which they felt were the average run of the mill frozen wings covered and cooked in the sauce of choice.

One of the waitresses actually spent 90% of the time we were there sitting in a booth talking to her visiting friends (only occasionally coming out to clear a table of glasses).  The female bartenders seemed more interested in texting and/or talking with only one young male customer than even noticing the rest of us. I was so put off by the rude service that  I spoke with Mark the General Manager several days later (after leaving a voice mail about the horrible service).  He asked that I send him the pictures that I took showing the server in the booth visiting friends all night.  I sent them as requested, and he never ever bothered to call or write me back in spite of me asking several times if he received me correspondence.  The bottom line, when this place first opened it was fantastic...one of me and my friend;s favorite places to go.  It has gone completely downhill in service, and none of us ever want to go there anymore (and I haven&#39;t since). It is clear no one is at the helm or holding any workers accountable for anything.

We won&#39;t go all year, then we will go 2 weekends in a row during the Oscar movie fest at the AMC theater down the street.  We usually have about 3 hours to kill in the middle of each day of the movie fest (5 movies in one day is a little much so we skip the 3rd movie of each day).  Tommy Nevins is the perfect place to kill that time.  We usually get several drinks, appetizers,and a sandwich or burger to split. We get one of the cozy curtained booths near the back.

Last night we were seated and it took the waiter at least 15 minutes to get our order for dinner. We had to ask for bread to be brought to our table. The waiter said &#34;I need to put an order in.&#34; For bread. That&#39;s supposed to be brought to every table. 

The majority of the food was not great. The fries were cold. My cheeseburger which I asked to be prepared medium was so badly burnt and charred on the bottom it was inedible - I only ate the top of the burger . Politely told the server about the burnt food who said he&#39;d remove it from the bill - apparently his version of removing from the bill was to discount the burger 50%. 

Every single table around us was complaining about their service and quality of their food. If this was my first time, I would never go back. I&#39;ll still probably never go back. Too bad, it&#39;s a great location, but there are too many other places to go."

I have an out of state ID (I was home in IL visiting my folks).The blonde haired manager condescendingly told  to me I had a fake ID and that he was kind enough to return it to me though if I went anywhere else in Naperville it would surely be taken. I tried offering my 3 credit cards, my military ID, my graduate school ID and my insurance ID but he was too cool to listen. He told me &#34;It doesn&#39;t matter, I will never serve you a drink here&#34;. I was too upset at this point to argue with his attitude.

The pot pie was salty, watery and the chicken was over cooked. The mac n cheese was gritty and way over priced and the wedge salad was as pricey as a meal. The fish and chips portions have shrunk by half the portion size as in the past and is of far lesser quality then they used to serve. The two best items I used to order (like the fried chicken and the bangers and mash) are no longer available. 

The service was incredibly subpar due to the fact that we started out with one waitress and then had a new one all of a sudden that had no clue what we ordered from the first waitress.

I haven&#39;t heard anything good about the new place either, and will not be dining at either establishment!"

Margaritas were phenomenal, food was acceptable, and the atmosphere was on point. The tacos were good but nothing special. The service was acceptable. The chorizo stuffed jalapeños were amazing and enough to make me come back.

We had a 7pm reservation for 6. We were sat promptly outside on a prefect evening. It was not crowded or too noisy. 

It took about 25 minutes to get the first round of great margaritas.  They were worth the wait!

Fast forward to 8:45. We are finally eating our food. Thank goodness they didn&#39;t bring out the tortillas for the fajitas because there was no place to put them. The table was still filled with empty chip basked and unfilled glasses. 

The best looking dish on the table was the red snapper, which takes 45 minutes to cook. (They won&#39;t tell you this, so I&#39;m offering it up.)  At least I believe it was the best looking. It was hard to tell because they failed to replace some burned out lights, so you couldn&#39;t see anything.  My now over cooked steak would have been much better had I been given a steak knife. I didn&#39;t dare ask. It wouldn&#39;t have showed up anyway. 

This place has potential. They just need better service."

I have only had a few things i really enjoy. However, my boyfriend is. So I picked this restaurant due to curiosity. I started the meal by ordering an horchata colada. I love horchata. But this drink..not too much. We ordered the queso dip (a thicker melted cheese) with chorizo. It was very good. And for our entree we went with the carne asada. The meat was cooked perfectly! And I am particularly picky when it comes to how my meat is cooked. They give you rice, beans, tortillas, peppers, lettuce, guac., and a cooked whole green onion on top of skirt steak. Overall the food was delicious!! I finally have a Mexican dish I really enjoy. The only negative thing I have to say was that I wished our server was a little bit more speedy with getting drink replenishments and our check.

The food is fantastic and beats any &#34;traditional&#34; Mexican places around. The moment you taste the chips and salsa you sense the meticulous care the chef puts into everything. The salsa is made on site by roasting the various vegetables and blending them together. The flavor that creates is out of this world or maybe from Mexico ;) They are always so nice to give use some salsa to take home! 

We love the portions and not so big that you&#39;ll need to take bags home. The tamales are my favorite and have the perfect masa harina to meat ratio. So many place dry them out while Volar keeps them moist and flavorful. You must try the mole&#39; even if you dislike. Theirs is very approachable and is so smooth you&#39;ll want to dip everything into it. Other great dishes are the Carnitas, empanadas, fluatas and tacos. I wish they had lenga tacos ... they would nail them if they did. 

The staff always has a warm welcome and take pride in what they do. The restaurant itself is pretty large and the wait, if there is one, is minimal, so go today or this weekend and enjoy so great Mexican fair. In the summer they have a patio soooo margaritas in the sun! Keep it up Volar!"

My husband ordered the enchiladas and they were $14, I got the appetizer chicken quesadila for $10 and shared that and a &#34;side&#34; of rice with my daughter for $4. Yes, a side of rice for $4 and honestly it was no more than the size of a deck of cards in a small dish. We also ordered the queso dip which was tasty, but in no way worth the $8 price tag (maybe worth $5). We also ordered a margarita and one beer and our total was $60. I had looked up their menu online before we went and there were no prices, I should have known.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I am all for paying for good food and good service, but I can go up 59 to Burrito and get more food for half the price. And, I think Burrito has better food.

I run a large food instagram account with over 600k followers and I would have been happy to take a picture of my meal and share my comments like I do with so many other restaurants, but instead I came home hungry and upset about paying $15 for nothing.

The second time we came was during a car show in the summer. We brought a group to get drinks and some appetizers. I went in and told the hostess we would like a table outside, and was told those were first come first serve. So some of our party went outside to wait and I went to the bar to order drinks, I waited over 25 minutes for the drinks because they didn&#39;t have enough glasses and kept having to wash them as they came back from other tables in order to complete our order. We didn&#39;t complain, waited patiently and paid close to $70 for just drinks. The rest of our party had waited for an outside table, and we finally were able to sit down with our drinks and discuss getting some food. 5 minutes later, a  hostess or manager comes over to ask us to leave because another party complained that we had a table with just drinks and they (the other customers) didn&#39;t think we were waiting as long as they were! ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? WHAT KIND OF HOSTESS/MANAGER ARE YOU??? WHY ARE YOU EVEN BOTHERING US WITH SOME OTHER PERSON&#39;S DRIVEL? 

I explained that the hostess had told us these tables were first come, first serve AND that we had waited over 25 minutes for the table. She said the girl had made a mistake. You know what?

The food was pretty good, but it took a half hour to get our drinks and to even get our orders taken. Mind you, the place was not that busy; many other restaurants on Lockport were much busier. After we ordered our food, it took roughly 45-50 minutes for it to arrive. When it came, the waiter handed my friend&#39;s husband a scorching hot plate without warning and burned his hand. 

At this point, we had been at the restaurant for almost 2 hours and just wanted our bills so we could leave. Waiting for the bills was another fifteen minutes, and even getting our bills paid took long.

The good news is there were lots of people  trying the new eatery. It&#39;s a tough market in the downtown Plainfield area,  so it&#39;s nice to see the response...I never got the chance to review the seafood place the building housed a few months ago! 
Great overall experience. They have done a nice job of remodeling. Exceptional  service, We never had a water glass get more than a few sips out of it and it was refilled. The chips were served warm and had lots of good corn flavor, the salsa was good and had just enough heat for Illinoisans! We &#34;Calie Girls&#34; prefer it a bit hotter! They had a nice selection of Margaritas... We tried a few...and then  a few more!
The food is good, the refried beans are made in-house and delicious!  There were a few food issues that I&#39;m chalking up to being new, such as the enchiladas, although delicious, they either had too much or not enough sauce. The overall food quality and taste was good with generous portions. During our meal they gave us complimentary items to try, some chicken soup that had great flavor,  a Chile Relleno that had good flavor and consistency, but was a bit oily, and dessert, a cheesecake that was yummy with perfect texture. I&#39;m cheering for them to succeed! I&#39;m going back, I think they have the chance to get the 5th star on my next visit."

The margarita I ordered I had to send back as it was very bland and tasted like just a mix. After they added a shot of grand mariner, it looked like a margarita and tasted like one. And my husband had 2 Modelo beers. 

The waiter brought us some complimentary Mexican vegetable and rice soup which was the best I&#39;ve ever had.

We ordered the 3 homemade tamales for an appetizer which were bland and lacked seasoning. However the mole sauce was delish!

Our entries were the steak fajitas and the shrimp with Diablo sauce. Both of which were very good. 

That being said and all we had to eat and drink, the bill was $100.

It&#39;s obvious the owners and chef take pride in the food - thoughtful touches and great presentation.  It might be a little expensive for family diners, but they have other equally tasty options in the area.   

We sat outside, and it was well appointed.  The live palms are a nice touch..  The front steps could use some lighting, for safety and ambience.   if there were outdoor heaters, a MUST in the midwest in my opinion, I would have given it a &#34;6&#34;!  

Hostess, server and busser were all very attentive.  The decor inside is tasteful, sophisticated but playful.  Lighting is great.  I can&#39;t comment on the noise or temp, as we ate outside, but it seemed comfortable.  

My final assessment was in the restroom.  Yes, I am one of those people who judge the &#34;cleanliness&#34; of the restaurant (and in theory, the kitchen) by the care taken in the bathroom.  A+!"

Once a server was assigned, we found her to be fantastic!
We ordered the grilled squid appetizer which was pricey but good. 
The drinks were good but way over priced for what you got. 
For dinner my husband got chili rellenos (his favorite) and asked for them to add beef. They came with the beef added but very little cheese. He was disappointed. 
I ordered enchiladas with mole sauce (my favorite) and was shocked at the very tiny &#34;enchiladas&#34; made with small corn tortillas. You get 3 in all and each one was about 3 bites and barely any sauce along with 1/2 T of sour cream. For the price we paid I was expecting something of higher quality and taste. I wouldn&#39;t mind the smaller portion if each bite were amazing. 
The chips and salsa were really good though. And the surprise dessert was a nice treat. 
Not sure we will return. We were hoping for much better."

The appetizer queso fundido a volar was a joke.  A bowl of melted cheese with some weird meat on top.  I think it was supposed to be chorizo.  Had the five dollar special margarita. Not sure it had alcohol in it.  If it did then well made,  it tasted great.  If not,  that explains why I didn&#39;t feel even a little buzzed.  Service was pretty slow.  No refills.  Some owner looking lady asked me if I was done with my drink.  When I said yes she took the glass and left without asking if I wanted another.  Ummm ok.  I over heard her say &#34;well it&#39;s 9 o&#39;clock&#34; when a bus boy asked her something while he had a handful of glasses.  Felt like it was time to leave.

They did a wonderful job with the decor, both inside and out. I was scared to see if we would be paying them for that in the prices, but was surprised to see they are pretty reasonably priced, although I will only be enjoying one of there delicious margaritas on nights when it&#39;s the special.. 

 The chips were the best I&#39;ve probably ever had at a Mexican restaurant. They were warm and crisp and perfectly salted, served with fresh salsa and spicy vegetable salsa- both wonderful. Our entrees were even better. The meat was very tender. Our service was very impressive. It was truly a team effort. I don&#39;t know if it was just because it was Cinco de Mayo, or if we will be getting that much attention regularly, but let&#39;s just say my water was always full and the salsa and chips kept coming.

 I really hope this one makes it. I can&#39;t wait for it to me my summer spot on the patio with hopefully lots of margarita happy hours to come!"

However I do not agree with the other reviewers saying the food was great. The salsa had a weird consistency. I ordered fish tacos which were pricier than nearby competitors. I asked for them to be spicy, given the salsa not living up to usual standards. When they came out, I was highly disappointed. Not only was there no seasoning whatsoever, but I could definitely tell they were not fresh. They tasted watery like they had been thawed too long and almost going bad. The margaritas were pure mix, no tequila. I will definitely not be returning."

Out of all the Mexican restaurants in the area it was the best we have eaten yet. I would absolutely return. The only negative thing I have to say is the prices are a little high.

Menu is not what I would describe as &#34;authentic&#34; Mexican, but I was in the mood for anything. Started out with ceviche as an appetizer. It was very tasty, but was served in a tortilla-like shell that was difficult to serve from. I ordered a burrito suizo and my fiancee ordered chicken enchiladas. The waiter got her order mixed up, She received the enchiladas rojas instead (supposed to be a &#34;special&#34; red sauce). Neither one of us was impressed with the food.

Atmosphere:  Really nice.  This place has seen several restaurants and I&#39;m glad someone finally made it look like an actual restaurant as opposed to someone&#39;s house.  Diego Rivera artwork is a bit cliche, but whatevs.  At least there wasn&#39;t the one where the Aztec warrior is holding his fallen lady friend while kneeling.

Service:  Average, although I wasn&#39;t expecting anything too stellar with them only being open for just over a week.  Staff is friendly and professional.  Our food did take a touch longer than I would have liked, especially since they weren&#39;t too busy.

Food quality:  Standard comp. chips with salsa.  They were ok.  I won&#39;t claim some were stale, but let&#39;s just say some were crispier than others.

Drinks were ok.  I had a classic lime margarita on the rocks and wifey had a pina colada.  I&#39;m not sure if the mix was house made or from a bottle.  With this type of supposed higher-end gourmet Mexican restaurant, you do expect the drinks to be kick-ass!  There was no drink menu, which I guess is ok, but it&#39;s nice to give the customer something to go off of.  Even if certain types of tequila upgrades were mentioned, that would have been a step in the right direction.  Their base tequila is Cabo Wabo.  I upgraded to Don Julio, which did enhance the drink somewhat.  Pina colada was ok too.  A bit creamer and more coconuty, which we like.

The soup, &#34;sopa de fideo,&#34; was tasty. Wifey ordered the tampiquena/carne asada which came with rice, beans and guacamole.  I had the taco trio which also came with rice and beans.  Little one ordered chicken fingers.  Carne asada on its own was above average.  Well cooked and seasoned.  As far as caliber, it reminded me of Lalo&#39;s.  Another good comparison would be La Quebrada or even Don Rafa&#39;s.  My tacos were good too, slightly above average.  I liked that I could mix/match my trio, so I ordered 1 &#34;Al Pastor&#34; and 2 carne asada.  Again, from a quality perspective, think of the aforementioned places....even think of burrito parrila in Plainfield, just to give you a local comparison.  Same type of quality and delivery.  

It&#39;s kind of a shame, because when I think of super gourmet, over the top tacos, there&#39;s a few things that has to make them special.  Every bit of that taco needs to be outstanding.  It all starts with the meat, which here was above average.  That&#39;s where it ended though.  Tortillas were standard corn that you can get at Meijer and the only other toppings were onion and cilantro.  Some of the best gourmet tacos I&#39;ve had (think Bien Trucha, Barbakoa, XOCO, Frontera Grill, etc.) take it to a whole other level with unique sauces, cheeses, meat blends, homemade tortillas, or other unique toppings like a special fruit or slaw.  

The sides were below average.  Rice was meh and the beans did not seem fresh.  They were either made from scratch a while ago and left to sit or from a can.  Not sure, but they seemed pretty dry/sad.  Again, so much opportunity with making unique sides.  We didn&#39;t order a dessert off the menu, so I can&#39;t comment on that.  Chicken fingers were ok. 

Value:  This really is the main reason why my review is on the lower side.  I keep calling Volar &#34;gourmet&#34; and my expectations are such, because that&#39;s how they&#39;re priced.  For the type of quality that they put out, it&#39;s over-priced.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with charging as much as they do, but when you charge $3-$4 for a taco, you better bring it!  Same thing with the tampiquena.  That entree was over $16, which again, not ridiculous if it&#39;s delish overall, but I can get the same thing at those other places for significantly less.  Honestly, if they want to last more than a year, prices have to go down and their identity as a standard, fairly good Mexican restaurant will be valid; or they have to REALLY step up the quality, variety and delivery of their food.  We only had 2 dishes, so I want to be fair, but I really doubt that the other items are on that higher-end gourmet level and our two choices were the exception.

Miscellaneous:  I always appreciate places that can pull off quality and be kid-friendly.  Aside from the chicken fingers, they had quesadillas.  A couple more kid options would be nice.  
The owners appear to be the same that own Capri (also in downtown Plainfield).  Not saying that&#39;s that good or bad, but just an fyi.  

Recap:  We&#39;re celebrating 10 years this month as being Plainfield residents and we want nothing more than success for the businesses that open up, especially restaurants and especially downtown.  Unfortunately, Volar just missed the mark with a big disconnect between what they charge and the quality of the food/drinks (I didn&#39;t mention earlier that they have a 24 oz margarita for $18.  This is the bigger version of what I ordered and again, definitely not worth that price.).  We&#39;ll see what the future holds for them and if they evolve.  I hope so, but we probably won&#39;t return."

Me and my friend decided to check this place out yesterday. After reading the yelp reviews, we were a little bit skeptical based on other&#39;s comments on the poor service, because my friend did have some place to be later--but we decided to give it a shot anyway.

We were greeted by the host who asked us if we wanted to sit outside or inside. We saw outside had a few empty tables so we thought we would be seated right away. Nope, the hostess told us it would be 5-10 minutes before our table was ready. I thought that was a bit odd as we waited outside with literally 3-4 empty tables staring us in the face. Kind of annoying, but whatever.

Once we were finally seated, it took quite a bit before someone came up to us and took our drink orders. It took even longer for him to come back with our drink orders and our chips and salsa. The chips and salsa were very good. The chips nice and salty and the salsa was unique..not sure how to describe it. We then ordered the empanadas for an appetizer (2 of each), the cheese and pepper tamales, and the enchilada dinner (red and white sauce). Side note: the enchiladas dinner and the enchiladas rojas were both 14 dollars even though the dinner comes with 1 more enchilada? I was confused about that.

The time it took for them to bring out the empanadas seemed like forever. Both types were tasty. They come with sour cream and guac which was nice. We devoured them quickly and were ready for our entrees. 

It took what seemed like forever for our entrees to come out. We kept seeing food being brought out thinking &#34;this HAS to be ours&#34; but we were disappointed when they took it to a different table. I didn&#39;t keep track of time but it must have been over 30 minutes. I understand that you might be busy, but at least have your staff communicate to the tables that the kitchen is backed up or something. Hire more people in the kitchen, or more servers. This was unacceptable and really kind of ruined the mood as my friend knew she needed to leave at a certain time. 

By the time our food came we had to ask for the check and boxes right away because we didn&#39;t want to wait another 20 minutes for that. I must say the food was very good, but I had to scarf it all down within 5 minutes so I really didn&#39;t get to enjoy it. My favorite was the enchiladas verdes. My friends tamales were also very good. Surprisingly, the rice and beans served with it were also pretty good--and I don&#39;t usually like refried beans.

I would be open to giving Volar another chance because I know that they are still new and working out the kinks. Hopefully, they figure out their issues because I do see potential in this restaurant and I would hate to lose another downtown Plainfield business."

Lets start with the drinks.  My beer was served to me warm and the margarita my wife ordered was basically crushed ice with tequila and salt.  Moving on to the service. We asked to sit outside and there were 3 open tables, but they tried to shove us in the corner next to a blaring speaker and a bus boy table.  After moving tables, we waited for 12 minutes before anyone even came to the table to take our drink order.  We had to ask the manager 2 separate times for the waitress to come take our order, and we ended up placing the order with the waiter in a different section after our original waitress quit and that order still came out wrong.  Then the overpriced food came out and we ate it as fast as possible because we wanted to get out of there.  We had to ask the manager a 3rd time to get the bill.  After paying much more than we should have for the meal, we enjoyed the rest of our night down the street.

I was super excited to see signs for Volar when they were getting ready to open, and wasn&#39;t disappointed.

My husband and I came on a Saturday night about a week after they opened.  There were plenty of tables full, but we didn&#39;t have to wait to be seated.  Our waitress was very attentive and was able to answer all questions we had about the drinks and menu items.  The chips and salsa were great.  We both got margaritas.  They were good and as far as alcohol content goes, they will creep up on you so watch out.  They don&#39;t taste like there&#39;s much alcohol in them but we definitely felt it midway through our second round.  I ordered the chimichanga with chicken and my husband got the burrito suiza with chicken.  Both were amazing.  The beans and rice were on point..beans tasted very fresh and rice was perfect.  Neither of us was able to finish our massive burritos.

They didn&#39;t have a drink menu, so we had to ask what the prices were before we ordered.  Menu items were reasonably priced..not super cheap, but reasonable for the amount and quality of the food.  For both our meals and 4 margaritas, the bill was about $65.  We will definitely be back to Volar."

Bad food, bad service, bad drinks.  I asked the waiter for a margarita that wasn&#39;t too sour, he had no clue.  Said ummmmm the house one??  I stupidly took his advice.  All sour.  The bartender was drinking behind the bar- unprofessional.  The high chair was covered in filth.  The food was not good, like a take out joint.  Taco Bell is better for the money.

Street tacos, fish tacos, tamales and enchiladas were all very good and we are picky when it comes to Mexican food. Saw comments from others on the service  and agree on it being a bit slow and unorganized but not bad. Biggest issue was the prices. They are fine for dinner but they really need a lunch menu.  Quite pricey for four of us for lunch and we only had water to drink and one soft drink. I&#39;ll be back... But not for lunch."

The entrance is very misleading when walking inside; the white walls and floors made me think it was carry out only. Then when I turned the corner, that&#39;s when it looked like an actual restaurant. 
The service we received tonight was very good. The waiter was really nice and humorous. The manager even stopped by our table and wished my parents a happy anniversary! 
The food was not what I expected. I was expecting larger portion sizes. The chicken saltimbocca for example was WAY TO SMALL of an entree. We were a table of 6 people sharing a 6 inch sized piece of chicken. It got very awkward very fast. If you&#39;re planning to sell a tapas style restaurant , make sure to have enough food for tables 6 or more. Or at least offer to cut it up for sharing. 
Throughout the dinner, refills were never an issue. Our waiter was always prompt with coming by and doing things for us without asking.
Near the end of the night, the manager was nice enough to give us complimentary dessert, completely surprising our parents. 
Overall, I do reccomend this place to others, but please make sure that if you bring more than 4 people with you, good luck sharing the food without people compromising."

I wanted to like this place, I really did. I am a long time fan of La Briola and have been wanting to try this place forever and unfortunately I was disappointed. I think they have a lot to work on and it could be a really great place but it&#39;s just not there yet. 

Initially after we sat down, a server did not come by for about 10 min. Too long in the restaurant world. My husband and I both selected our beverages and what we would eat and had several conversations before anyone even greeted us. As the meal progressed he also never asked us if we wanted a second beverage though our glasses were empty for quite some time. 

I ordered 2 small plates for myself and my husband ordered the burger. Now I understand quite well that when you order small plates, the food comes when it&#39;s ready. However, the server did not deliver that message at the time of placing our orders like he should have. Any other small plates restaurant I&#39;ve been to always does!! He also should have taken into consideration that though I ordered small plates, this was all I was eating so why wouldn&#39;t my husband and I want to eat together....?  My first dish came out quickly and I was done with it, and beginning to digest before we saw anymore food. Awkward. 

Our server seemed like a nice guy. Generally, I felt bad for him cause it was clear he wasn&#39;t getting the training he needed from management. 

Food: 
Mediterranean Muscles (w/ red sauce): They were decent. However, NO BREAD. I mean come on, that&#39;s just muscles 101!! If you are serving muscles, you have to include some nice crusty grilled bread to soak up all the delicious sauce at the bottom of the bowl. Nope. I ate it with my fork. Or tried to. 

Asparagus with fried egg: horribly under seasoned. It was bland and lacked any sort of seasoning or finishing. It needed to be hit with some salt, cracked black pepper, maybe even a little chili flake and finished with a good quality olive oil.

America Burger: my husband said it was no different then any other similar restaurant - nothing special."

We ate family style, so we ordered a bunch of appetizers (we treated them like small plates.... there&#39;s a difference..right?) a couple of pasta&#39;s, a sandwich and a pizza. 

There were 5 of us and the restaurant was super accommodating. We hung out for almost 3 hours.. the servers were all over the refills, the service was very good and friendly

La Barra is owned by Labriola.. and the pizza doesn&#39;t disappoint. All of the food was top notch and the pricing reasonable.

Our favorite is Danny and Batina. Based on food and service they should have a 5 star rating. My problem with this place is their inconsistent hours. We live close by and half of the time we come here they are closed before their scheduled hours. I understand that some nights are slow but it&#39;s not good for business. One night me and 2 other people tried coming in on a Saturday night and there was another group of 4-5 also attempting to come here and we were turned away. We stopped coming here spontaneously because of this. We now call to make sure they are open before we go.

That&#39;s what you got with Pizza Barra now LaBarra and I simply had to find out after hearing about this place and my affinity for Stan&#39;s donuts!

But I&#39;m left perplexed by this place after two visits. 

First Visit
After arriving back in Chicago, I spun into this place on my way home. It was late and though my energy was high, I thought takeout was a better option so I called in a takeout. Upon arriving 25 minutes or soafter the call, I was met with absolute coldness. No hi, no how can we help you, nothing. After a few minutes of standing there, I asked the pizza maker &#34;if this is where I go for a takeout&#34;. Annoyed, he went to get the hostess. After a few minutes, she emerged and took my name. I spent the next 20 minutes feeling like an intrusive burden to the entire team: distant employees that showed little interest in services, friendliness, or just basic human interest.

Taking my deep dish pizza, I lost my appetite for how I was treated. Not angry but disheartened. The next day, my kids snacked on a piece and said it was really good.

Second Trip
We returned to LaBarra after my kids said they really wanted to try it. Given my first trip was late in the evening plus a take out, I reluctantly agreed.

This time, the service was better. Not exceptional but nowhere near the first trip. In fact, Mike the pizza maker made the trip worth it from a service level.

As for the pizza, we did a margarita pizza and a deep dish. The margarita pizza was not good at all. I&#39;ve had better fast food wood fire than this pizza. The deep dish, on the other hand, was good. The crust is that of Pequod&#39;s and is exceptional especially mixed with a strong cheese and sauce, but then things get a bit off. The dough has an odd flavor and works in an odd way of crossing out of the traditional Chicago deep dish crust into an artisan bread in a way that I think focaccia meets deep dish.

My mind went back and forth between I Love It to I Hate It. With one bite, yum. With the next, yuck. After going back and forth, I am leaning more toward the latter. And that is the tale of two cities with this place: service and food.

Will I return? Doubtful. There are too many great places out there when it comes to pizza in Chicago."
la-barra-oak-brook,Kate J.,lSItLiP7XXl6uAy6R6XDSA,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,189,67,Hv4oQcVFnwlPKhreG7w-RA,2.0,2016-08-28,"So I came here on a Saturday night with my family.  To be fair, a good portion of our party arrived late, so that might account for a bit of the confusion, but the restaurant wasn&#39;t too crowded, so I&#39;m not sure.  Anyway, my sister had requested within our reservation that we not be seated at a high-top table, because my grandma could not sit in one of those chairs.  Prior to being seated, the hostess asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside.  We opted to sit outside, but when we were led to our table, it was a high-top.  This led to an uncomfortable situation that we had tried to prevent, but we were quickly relocated to an indoor table.

In terms of food, I really enjoyed the Margherita Pizza, and my wine was tasty too.  The service was kind, and the atmosphere was modern and cool, especially when they had live music playing.  However, the music played after the live music was SO loud!  I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re going for a club sort of vibe, but judging from how not crowded the bar was when we left around 10:30, I don&#39;t think the loud music was necessary.  It certainly hindered our conversation, and I&#39;m not sure I can recommend this spot for a meal where the customers want to actually chat comfortably with one another."

The waiter informed us that they made these changes less than a week ago. We met up some friends who claimed the loved pizza barra and that we had to try it. Needless to say we were a bit taken back and hoped it was as good. Right off the bat we were a bit disappointed because the new chef didnt like the chick pea fries and they were no longer available. However the food we got was not bad. For apps we got some fried risotto balls. The waiter said there would be 4, but only 3 came. We also got the burrata which was also a small portion. Most ppl share appetizers. For the price, they should include more. Enough so that 2 order would suffice 4 people. And to top it off, they weren&#39;t anything great. 

We patiently waited 40 minutes for our deep dish pizza. Now those of you who follow me...all 3 of you...know that i love pizza. And this place met my expectations. This was some seriously good deep dish. We got the Popeye and added goat cheese. Crust was good. Heavy, but not gross. Caramelized crust. All good. However it was $33. Not bad for the portion I suppose. 4 of are 1/2 of a large. 

Bottom line. Yes. Go. It&#39;s good. Appetizers aren&#39;t that great. Order early for the deep dish and indulge in it. 

Enjoy."

I LOVE this style pizza it&#39;s NOT so greasy and the crust was crispy on the outside with a little bit of chew on the inside! I want to come back and try their other pizzas!
I docked them 1 star because we asked for a side of marinara to dip the delicious pizza crust in and it was sub par. HEY LE BARRA!...MELTED GARLIC BUTTER IS DELICIOUS ON EVERYTHING! 
More importantly, my favorite dish the clams and linguine was just meh... It needed some lemon or a zing of something."

I&#39;ll start with the pros, the drinks were great but took kind of a while to get. Again the patio is beautiful and the bar has a really cool vibe. Atmosphere and crowd was very mixed but we went for an early dinner on Saturday so I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s why. Service was okay, nothing I would go crazy over but then again not terrible either. 

As for the cons, our table was uneven which is my biggest pet peeve. The table wasn&#39;t set and we had to request plates, ect. We started with Bruschetta and it was good but a little bland. Then we had pizza which just didn&#39;t amaze me to be honest. Since I live closer to the city I&#39;m used to some seriously amazing pizza, this place just couldn&#39;t compete. Thin crust was pretty boring and so thin that the toppings just poured off. 

At the end of our meal our server gave us coupons I think because we sat on the patio and they never turned the heat on (it was pretty chilly) so that was nice. We will most likely come back just to the bar for drinks and appetizers."

The only issue was with our server who was *laying it on pretty thick* if you know what I mean. He made comments about how we should drink more and try and joke with us while we were trying to still decide on food, order or catch up together. If he could take it down a notch that would be great. 

Food: The calamari was just ok and the brussels sprouts were good! I&#39;d definitely come back to try more of their pizza, though."

The first time was on the outdoor patio. It was nice but I am only 4&#39;11&#34; and do not like sitting on a bar stool. We were quickly moved to a lucky empty table. Most people would prefer to sit on the terrace patio, which is quite nice, but do not want to sit at a bar stool. Really! 

Second, I was there on a Sunday afternoon, with my cousin after a  concert. I ordered two different items, the braciole and the chicken small plates and they were &#34;out of them.&#34; Really? On a Sunday at 5 pm? We were disappointed.

The third time, we tried to come for small plates and a glass of wine, after a concert on a Saturday night, around 10:15pm. We were told, &#34;After 10pm, we only serve pizza.&#34; Really?  I have had their meat sausage pizza and it is very, very salty. Not good pizza, in my repertoire. Probably left over and not purchased?

My daughter and I tried La Barra one more time and when we checked in for Open Table, the two young women at the front were giggling and totally ignoring us. I told her we were 10 minutes late and I had an Open Table reservation.  

We ordered several small plates and they were decent. The arrancini, the chicken sambucca, the charred parmesan salad and the green salad were great. We both had glasses of red wine. We left by 8:00. When I arrived home, Open Table wanted to know why we missed the reservation? Those hostesses did NOT check me into Open Table.  I called the manager and complained. He told me to make another reservation for this evening and he would take care of it. Really?

Most restaurant managers are more than gracious and would offer a free drink, appetizer, dessert for my trouble. I usually turn it down, anyway. However, this manager was not very friendly or accommodating over the phone.  I told him that he needs to keep tabs on the front end for a courteous welcoming staff for people coming into the restaurant.

Too many issues in my five visits. I predict this restaurant won&#39;t make it. High priced, too much trouble. Very loud music so conversations are impossible  I&#39;m done."

It was a Saturday evening around 8PM and it was gorgeous outside. When we arrived there was a wait, however, we asked the hostess if we could see if there were any seats available at the bar and we told her it was our first time here. She immediately told us to go check it out since they have 2 bars and an outdoor patio. 

We decided to sit at the bar on their outdoor patio. We ordered a beer and a mule. Which took about 5 minutes to get. Granted, I got my beer first and my bf had to wait another 5 minutes to get his mule. Being a bartender myself, I can understand when the patio is busy including the bar, your drinks can take a little bit to make. However, it just seemed like the bartender had forgotten about my bf&#39;s drink...

The bar outside can seat about 10 people and there were 8 sitting there. Bf &amp; I wanted some apps but we didn&#39;t get serviced from the bartender for about 20ish minutes after we had received our drinks. So by the time the bartender asked if we needed anything, we ordered our apps and dinner right away.

We ordered one of their meat apps and eggplant with mozz. Both were yummy. When the pizza arrived I wasn&#39;t impressed. I didn&#39;t really care for their sauce that they use or how much cheese they put on the pizza (the don&#39;t put that much cheese on their pizza, some spots on the pizza weren&#39;t covered by cheese, kind of like a flatbread style almost) the bf and I actually prefer Aurellios pizza way better! 

After finally checking out this place, we most likely wont be back..."

This was the FIRST time I have ever eaten or ordered food from this place. Food delivered with no difficulty, but the pasta dish we ordered arrived looking like leftovers. I had a couple people over and was embarrassed by this dish. Luckily, I made a joke to my guests about the situation and they surmised that the restaurant must have sent a doggy bag accidentally. When I called and spoke with the manager Brad, he reassured me that these five measly raviolis were not leftovers but in fact what I had ordered. &#34;That&#39;s how it&#39;s supposed to be.

I had made a reservation over a month ago and we were seated right away. My only real issue is that our server, while super friendly, was very overwhelmed which caused him to be somewhat slow. Also, we were all in agreement that they should have bread on the table, but alas, they did not. 

Pretty much everyone I was with ordered their own 10 inch pizza since everyone wanted their own thing. Even being the smallest pizza, they were pretty big and most people didn&#39;t finish. My one friend got pasta and liked it but thought the prosciutto made it a bit salty. 2 of our party had the tomato bread soup and loved it, but beware, the portion is quite large!

I had wanted to try a few different things so I skipped the pizza. I had their vegetable tray with the brussel sprouts, cauliflower and artichokes. Some were served hot while one was served cold which was a strange choice. The portions were bigger than I thought and I couldn&#39;t finish. I also had the arugula and cheese salad, which was really good but it almost had TOO much arugula. Maybe add another type of lettuce or some veggies in there. 

The highlight for me was their bruschetta of the day. I love bruschetta and always order it and on Saturday it was burrata, pesto, peppers and FRIED CAPERS. I am obsessed with capers and never knew such a thing existed. My friend and I shared this as it was 2 large pieces, but I could have eaten it all myself. The capers were the perfect addition! 

My friends liked their drinks. They gave my one friend an option to &#34;upgrade&#34; her glass of wine which brought it to a hefty $17 per glass. They let my other friend try samples of beer before she ordered which was nice too and they split the checks for us. Our waiter seemed hesitant when I asked because he had gone through his schpiel about it being a shared plates place, but we knew we weren&#39;t sharing to a split check was best.

By the time we left, the place was packed. They do offer $5 valet but we parked ourselves. I can&#39;t wait to go back in the summer and eat on their gorgeous patio!"

The fact that they&#39;re open late in middle of suburbia alone is a reason to check them out.

It&#39;s in the same shopping center.  We have stopped in here before for a company outing - but more recently for a simple lunch with a couple buddies.  The pizza is fantastic.  Everything is from scratch - so its about 20 minutes for a regular pie and a full 40+ for their version of the stuffed pizza (not sure what they call it).  We got the regular pizza - but I&#39;m already looking forward to trying their stuffed pie.  

The only recommendation is to call ahead if you&#39;re in a hurry and you want to have the stuffed pizza."

Our appetizers were good - many unique choices as well as small plate offerings.  Our party of four also ordered a pizza, which was well-made and flavorful.  We were definitely satisfied with the food, as well as the many drink options.  

Where I dock this place a few stars is the service.  Our waitress was inattentive throughout the evening.  It took forever to even get a server to take our drink order.  Then we wondered if she was ever going to return for our food order.  We had to track her down for water refills, and we all probably would&#39;ve ordered another round of drinks as well as dessert if she ever came back.  After waiting and waiting and waiting (and watching the clock tick), we decided it was time to go and requested our check when we finally spotted our waitress in the vicinity.

I recommend starting with the Antipasti tasting- we like the burrata, sopresatta, roasted brussel sprouts, cauliflower, and celery with dates! Yum!

We were seated right away and the server was quick to greet our table. He was knowledgeable about the menu and gave us his recommendations. Since it wasn&#39;t very crowded at that time, he recommended getting the pizzas which he mentioned would take 15 to 20 minutes to cook. I decided to go with the Garganelli pasta and my dad decided to order the Pizza Barra Supreme thin crust.

The service was great, the waiter kept asking if we wanted our waters refilled even though the glasses were full. The pizza was done within 20 to 30 minutes and came out first. My Garganelli pasta came out 5 minutes after the pizza. I am giving 3 stars because the food wasn&#39;t up to my expectations. The pasta was disappointing. It wasn&#39;t cooked enough and it felt chewy and hard. The sauce wasn&#39;t memorable and I&#39;ve had better pasta elsewhere. My dad&#39;s supreme pizza was good except the pizza was so thin that the toppings kept falling off and it just made it super messy to eat. I have had better pizza at other places such as Pizzeria Uno in Chicago or Schaumburg which are worth the drive. Is it worth $30 for a 16&#34; thin crust pizza? No because I can go to Giordano&#39;s in Oak Brook to get a deep dish for the same price. I just wish the pasta tasted better and that the pizza crust would be thicker then I would come back and try their food again."

I like the idea of small plates for sharing as appetizers.  I love the patio. The only negative about the ambiance is that is a little too loud inside.

However, I have now been here 4 times and twice have had mishaps with the pizza.

The deep dish was burned to a crisp on one occasion and the another time the dough was not risen and resulted in an inedible pizza. I am not sure if they ran out of dough and made some extra dough because they were busy, but I would not recommend the deep dish because you never know what you are going to get.  When you wait 45 minutes for a pizza offering to make another is not an acceptable solution.

Hopefully they step it up."

We came here on a Thursday night to celebrate my husband&#39;s birthday, so he got to do the deciding. We&#39;re big fans of the Labriola cafe so hearing that there was a new full-service pizza/small plates oriented restaurant sounded pretty awesome, and Pizza Barra did not disappoint.

I dig the decor and atmosphere - a little old school pizza joint, a little cozy industrial bar, a little steakhouse ... hard to explain but it works.

We started with the fried provolone thingies (they were kind of like little empanadas) and the bruschetta of the day - fava beans, burrata and heirloom tomato. It&#39;s hard to go wrong with fried cheese pockets, but man, that bruschetta was amazing. Two crispy pieces of bread with ooey-gooey-super-creamy burrata and the freshest most perfect tomato. The fava beans were tasty but kind of an afterthought.

We also ordered a double dough pepperoni pizza. It was delicious. High quality ingredients, perfectly spiced sauce, awesome cheese, great pepperoni, all on a delicious crust. 

The menu all looks really good and someday I will come back and eat everything -- because from the veggie small plates to the desserts I want all of it except the olives, sorry olives. The drink menu - including classic cocktails, lots of wine and a good beer selection - also looks stellar.

Our waiter was on top of things, friendly, explanatory, a little jokey and on top of refills and any other needs we might have. 

All around an excellent restaurant and an excellent experience I want to repeat over and over."

I went on opening night and have been back already. I think the truly standout items are the pasta... I&#39;ve had the rigatoni with meat sauce and garganelli with peas/prosciutto and they were probably the best pasta I&#39;ve had in the suburbs.... Perfectly cooked and so much more flavor, better sauce and texture than Volare across the way. 

I&#39;ve tried two of their signature coal fired pizzas and wasn&#39;t the most impressed... I&#39;ve had better coal fire before, but the crust was amazing. I haven&#39;t tried the thin or Chicago style yet. 

The small plates they offer all look pretty good as well, I liked the flank steak/polenta plate. Meat was fork tender!

I think this is a fun place to get a drink after work, or get a nice meal. The music was rather loud even during dinner time, but was noticeably not as loud the second time I went... The wait staff is very nice, but a little slow (likely just getting to know process, menu..), but I think these small things will work themselves out ultimately."

First, the decor. You are greeted by a modern, yet old school vibe at the bar. When you walk to the back of the restaurant, you notice a beautiful patio on the water perfect for those summer nights. 

We started with a variety of cheeses and meats that were a very large portion for the 6 of us. We ordered 2 of the artesian pizzas, the buratta and the salsiccia. The salsiccia had this yummy savory cream sauce that I am still dreaming about. Both pizzas had the best crust I&#39;ve ever had. Doughy but crispy at the same time. We ended by trying a variety of desserts that were all outstanding.

We ordered the Rigatoni Pasta to share and it was amazing! Delicious and great for sharing. We also wanted to compare the pan pizza to our favorite local place in Oakbrook Terrace and we were really impressed on how good the pizza was. It was loaded with tomatoes, but they tasted great on the pan pizza. The crust was thicker but very crunchy and full of flavor.
I cannot wait to go back and try out some appetizers and some of the veggies options that they have on their menu. I ordered to drink the Moscow Mule and it was very delicious!

I&#39;ve dined at Pizza Barra twice now (never carry-out). 

Similarities 
Service: Both times, I dined here with a group of four, and had spotty service. The first time, we waited and waited for food. We ordered an appetizer that came out with three servings (a big pet peeve - if the app doesn&#39;t say the servings, and there are four people, I believe it should be recommended that we either order another, or add another piece to the order). For lunch, the service was far too slow. The second time, we waited several minutes at the front desk before finally just walking in, to find the hostess chatting at the bar and unaware she had a line waiting for tables. In this time, the others ate half of their pizza before my salad arrived - but - our server DID recommend adding a fourth serving to the same appetizer.
Pizza: It was fantastic both times. There&#39;s something to be said about that chewy, wood fire grilled dough that makes you feel less guilty, and not overly stuffed. It&#39;s not easy to pick up (the middle is a bit doughy) but overall it&#39;s delish.

Differences
Salad: Both times, I ordered the Baby Arugula salad. The first time, I literally cleaned the plate. I actually went to the grocery store that night and bought the ingredients, because it was so delicious. The second time I ordered, it didn&#39;t get brought out until well after the pizzas arrived, and it didn&#39;t taste nearly as good - less ingredients, more arugula. Bummer!

We&#39;re close to this location for work, so hopefully the third time is the charm when it comes to service. There isn&#39;t anything comparable around the area - but should the service fall short a third time, we&#39;ll skip on Pizza Barra and just stick to LaBriola."

I made reservations on Open Table and they were ready for us when we arrived. The hostess asked us if we wanted to sit outside, unsure because it was a bit chilly out, we decided to check it out anyway. So glad we did! The outdoor patio is heated (keeps you VERY warm) and is decorated so cute! Streams of little lights on the ceiling, overlooks the pond with the fountain in it, and great ambiance. The bar area is huge with a large flat screen TV and there are a lot of high table tops as well as regular tables to sit at. The waiter was very friendly, a little slow but we didn&#39;t mind because we were all taking, catching up, and having a great time. We ordered the eight finger cavatelli, braciole (both recommendations from our waiter and they were both DELICIOUS!), we also got the beets (love beets but these were average), Brussels sprouts which were yummy, and a Margherita pizza that was so good that even my friends husband who is from Italy (just moved to the US a few months ago) even said it was really good and wants to eat there again! 

Also, the server brought out a chocolate piece of cake with a candle in it for my birthday for free. That too was delish! 

I am so impressed with LaBarra and glad I didn&#39;t listen to the negative reviews. Perfect for a little date night. girls night, or any night!

From start to finish, the service was so bad it was comical. Arrival: 4 adults, 7:45 reservation, on-time arrival, beautiful night out, outdoor seating requested. Hostess: &#34;Do you still want an outdoor table?&#34; Me: &#34;Yes.&#34; Hostess: &#34;That will be an hour wait.&#34; Me: &#34;We have a reservation. What are our options?&#34; Hostess: &#34;We have a table ready for you inside. We can move you outside when a table opens up in an hour.&#34; Me: &#34;Ok.&#34; The host stand then proceeds to ignore us for the next 10 minutes despite no other parties waiting. They finally seat us inside without acknowledging the delay. As they seat us, I remind them we would like to be moved outside as soon as something opens up.

After they finally seat us, our waiter comes over, and I let him know we would like to be seated outside as soon as a table opens up. He tells us about the pasta special, a tortellini with chicken. I ask if it can be served without chicken as one of our party is vegetarian. The waiter is unsure. Here is a partial list of other things the waiter doesn&#39;t know and doesn&#39;t find out for us:  what is the bruschetta of the day, anything about the preparation of any of the verdure (vegetable antipasti), the preparation of and accompaniments for the Whole Roasted Red Snapper Livornese, what the &#34;meatball pie&#34; is.

Example 1: Me: &#34;What is the bruschetta of the day?&#34; Waiter: &#34;I missed the tasting session today, so I&#39;m not sure.&#34; Me: &#34;Uh, ok.&#34;

Example 2: Me: &#34;Can you tell me what the whole red snapper is served with?&#34; Waiter: &#34;I have never seen it before, so I don&#39;t know.&#34; Me: &#34;So should I order something else?&#34; Waiter: &#34;Yes.&#34;

Example 3: Wife: &#34;I&#39;ll have a small deep dish meatball pie***.&#34; Waiter: &#34;You want a deep dish pizza with meat balls?&#34; Wife: &#34;The deep dish pizza on the menu called &#39;Meat Ball Pie.&#39;&#34; Waiter: &#34;Show me which one.&#34; Wife [pointing]: &#34;The one right there.&#34; Waiter: &#34;Okay. Do you want 14-inch, 12-inch, or 10-inch?&#34; Wife: &#34;The small one.&#34; Waiter: &#34;So, the 10-inch?&#34; Wife: &#34;Yes. That is the smallest one.&#34;

***  SIDE NOTE: The menu has only five deep dish pizza offerings, each with a specific name. One of them is called &#34;Meat Ball Pie.&#34; There are three sizes. Seems just about as straightforward as it could be.

We remind the waiter we would like to be seated outside as soon as a table opens up and ask him to check periodically. No further word from the waiter on this until we remind him an hour after we arrived. (In the meantime, we have seen two other tables move outside.) We ask him how much longer the wait will be, and he tells us &#34;it will be about an hour.&#34; I remind him that is what they told us an hour ago. No other word about this from anyone at the restaurant.

About 20 minutes after we are seated, the waiter takes our antipasti order. The food arrives with reasonable promptness. As the server is sitting plates on the table, he bangs down the marinara sauce so it splashes all over the table and splatters the white shirt of one of our party. The server doesn&#39;t notice. By the time we figure out what happened, he is gone. When the waiter returns, we tell him what happened and ask for club soda. The waiter doesn&#39;t apologize, but disappears and returns with club soda -- and black paper napkins. Seriously? Black paper napkins to rub onto a white shirt? Still no apologies or any offer to make anything right. Ever.

About 10-15 minutes after we are done with our antipasti, we finally get our waiter&#39;s attention so we can place our dinner order. This is about an hour or so after we are seated. When the waiter can tell me nothing about the red snapper and doesn&#39;t offer to check, I order the I order the Paccheri with clams. The other three members of the party order pizza.

Our party is now sitting at an empty table chatting away. About 20 minutes later (around 9:00 or 9:05), a server comes over and plops the Paccheri with clams down onto the table. No explanation. No comment about the other orders. No offer of parmesan or pepper. After about 10 minutes, we are able to flag down the waiter to see when the pizzas might arrive and find out whether I can get some parmesan. He doesn&#39;t seem to know how long the pizzas will be. Rather than entrust the waiter with my dinner to take it back to the warmer, I decide to go ahead and eat it. But no bowl for the clam shells. I steal a plate from a neighboring table. The food is fine, but certainly not memorable. I am done eating around 9:20 or so. The pizzas finally arrive 20 minutes later - 40 minutes after my dinner was served.

No apologies, nothing taken off the bill, no acknowledgment that they never got us outside, bland meatballs, average food.  One star.  At best."

We got there kind of late, maybe 9PM (after a movie across the street) and it took a while for the Bartenders to decide it they wanted to wait on us. I explained it was our first time there and before I could ask what they recommend she said, well here are the menus, let me know if you have questions. When she came back to see what we wanted we were asking about the deep dish pizza, they made a huge effort to try to talk us into the thin crust. It seemed strange so I asked if they were closing??? We ordered the grilled Cesar Salad and a Pizza Bara Supreme Pizza. 

The Salad was horrible. I have had Grilled Cesar Salads before and in fact even make them at home, this was the &#34;very middle&#34; of the romaine heart, this thing could not have been more than an inch in diameter and it was sooo soaked in dressing that it was completely limp. There were three pieces on the plate and where about as crisp as a cooked noodle. I asked if this was normal and they said yes. 

The pizza arrived after about an hour and it was good, basically the pizza recipe if a knock off from Pequod&#39;s Pizza in Chicago. Kind of a cornmeal crunchy crust (not doughy) and they let the cheese and sauce run over the side of the crust and caramelize on the top. The pizza was very juicy (more tomatoes than sauce) We really liked the pizza so we thought we would let the iffy service go and give it another try. 

The next time we came back we with a larger group. There were three adults and three children. We ordered Calamari (very small pieces mostly breading) and asked if we could get a regular Cesar Salad (not grilled). The brought out a big bowl of sliced romaine lettuce with almost no dressing.  We ordered three deep dish pizzas. It took a little over an hour to see the pizzas come up and we could see the waitress just staring at them in the window by the kitchen. We had a good view of the kitchen as they sat us at the first table in the dining area, right by the Bus Area and the Bathrooms, so we saw when the waitress called over a manager to decide if they should serve our pizzas. They brought them over and sure enough, they were burnt, not caramelized burnt. We had to accept the pizzas because it was late, we had been waiting for an hour and we had three hungry 9 and 10 years old kids to feed. It would have been ok it is was just a little extra burnt around the edge of the crust, but because the pizza was overcooked it was really dry. 

After we paid the bill and were walking out, we asked the waitress why they served those pizzas, she said it was the managers decision. (this is why after dropping off the pizzas we never saw her again, someone else brought the check and we had to ask bus people for refills on drinks) When we asked the manager for some consideration, maybe a coupon to come back, and he actually said...&#34;We get complaints about the pizza being burnt all the time, this is how they are supposed to be cooked&#34;. 

We won&#39;t be back!!!!!!!!!! We have had similar experiences at their sister restaurant - Labriola Café. They are both Beautiful Restaurants with really bad execution."

I will give them that, they just need to really work on service. Wow. Our server spent the whole time explaining how slammed he was and complaining about the kitchen. I admit my friends are a little high maintenance, they&#39;ve served at high-end restaurants, so they have a certain expectation when it comes to service, and this guy was not delivering. He didn&#39;t know any of the ingredients in the food, what is saba that is listed in this pasta? &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; How many small plates is a good amount for a small group? &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; This pasta is spicy, do you know what&#39;s in it? &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; Alrighty then. 

Also the bar does not have ginger ale, and committed the sin of mixing sprite and coke together, this is not ginger ale. I know this is what bartenders do in a pinch, but when we ask specifically if you have ginger ale, don&#39;t say yes if you&#39;re just going to mix up some strange concoction and call it ginger ale. If I had wanted jameson with sprite and a splash of coke I would have ordered it that way."

Fortunately, we had a reservation. Large restaurant but nice atmosphere and bar area. Pizza is priced in the high side but very good, and not greasy. Recommend getting a large and sharing. We ordered a 10, 12 and 16 inch for four people. Way too much, but everybody got they wanted. Get one of the artesian pizzas which are unique and you can&#39;t readily find elsewhere. Service is where they need to work out the kinks. Table wasn&#39;t ready for our reservation. Pizza (thin crust) took 35 minutes and the wrong order was initially brought out. If you&#39;re going to the movies like we were, allow enough time. Service was friendly so  given time they should hopefully figure it out.

They tell us an hour. We give them the phone number we called from (caller id shows the same number). We show up an hour later. THEY RAN OUT OF DOUGH!!!!!!!!  A pizza place at 6:00 pm on a Sunday ran out of dough. They say they tried to call us but had the wrong number written down. So rather than making two thin crust pizzas with the same ingredients.... I guess there was plenty of thin crust dough...they did nothing. 

So why would I give them 4 stars.  It&#39;s because of what happened next. 

The manager was completely sincere and apologetic. She admitted they screwed up. They offered to make us pizzas (the same pizzas we ordered just on thin crust) immediately. It would take 30 minutes and if we waited at the bar our drinks and an appetizer was on the house. Oh and they comped the pizzas. That was a classy move for any place, but especially a pizza place. 

The polenta and braciole appetizer was outstanding. It&#39;s the best braciole and sauce I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s my favorite beef dish and they nailed it. Sorry mom.  

The pizzas were great. Try the Italian beef pizza. It&#39;s really really good.

Wrong food delivered after a 75 min wait after placing order... 2 forks for 4 diners and no response to first two requests for more... Dirty dishes never bussed...) it will likely improve when they have more experience and work out the kinks. Tons of people walking around with ear pieces eyeballing the diners - not enough workers actually doing anything. We were in a large dining room with about 20 tables and only one busboy who clearly took a 30 min break while we were there because he disappeared for a long time. 

One can suffer less than mediocre service for a good slice of pie, and this is why I gave it 3 stars. The Arancini was delicious - everything else was just OK, but not worth the wait.  The pizza was less than average.  My family of 4 dropped $200 and my kids wanted to eat when we got home. 

To be fair, we always thought LaBriola was just OK - very beautiful place to be and presentation outstanding, but the end product is blah to our taste. If you like them, then perhaps Pizza Barra will be to your taste too. (same owner, I believe)."

First off, the bruschetta changes daily. Our server told us the daily one was a yellow tomato with arugula. They delivered a mushroom and cheddar cheese one. My boyfriend is allergic to mushrooms. I told the waiter, he said oh they changed it. I had to insist they remake what we ordered.

Then, the specialty pizza arrives. It was so-so. 2nd piece in- and there was a little squiggly black hair on the pizza. 

Called the waiter, he offered to remake it. I said ok, I couldn&#39;t eat the one we had. And then he didn&#39;t remake it. Brought our check about 10-15 mins later. Didn&#39;t charge us for the pizza, but charged for the wrong bruschetta (they did bring correct one... After the gross hair pizza).

The problem is pizza, service, and common sense. 

There are an indoor and out door bar; my friend asked me, &#34;Why does it take a half hour to get a beer?&#34; 

We ordered a 10&#34; pizza, too much sauce and when the host brought the thin crust it looked like char coal. The kicker was no napkins.

Pizza Barra offers the excellence you would expect from Labriola (who owns them) in a new, and very cool, format. The pizzas are gourmet in many ways except price.

The outdoor patio is a perfect fit. You can hang out for a long time enjoying the food and drink without that sluggish / heavy feeling some Italian / pizza places tend to have.

Try the squid ink with mussels pasta dish, get a pizza or two to share and you won&#39;t be disappointed.

We wanted to possibly have our rehearsal dinner here for our wedding. We asked to speak to the manager, who was very helpful, though I almost fell out of my chair when I saw the pricing!!!

We were finally seated at a table and put our orders in at 7:15. We each ordered a 10 inch pizza, hoping to share with one another. Two of us had ordered thin crust, while the other two ordered the pan pizza. The waiter warned us that it would be at least a half hour wait since the pan pizzas take longer to cook.

From that point on, we waited, and waited, and waited.........It was 8:30 and still no pizza. The waiter came by maybe a couple times apologizing and letting us know that he kept asking for our pizzas. He continued to explain that Saturday nights are &#34;very busy.&#34; We ended up waiting over an hour and a half. We finally asked for the check so we could leave. A different manager spoke to us, apologizing for the inconvenience. She did give us a gift card and the &#34;dinner&#34; was on the house. 

I&#39;m normally not one to write reviews, but I had to for Pizza Barra. Not only did we not get our food, but other people were complaining about waiting a long time for theirs. On the way out, I overheard one waiter complaining to a waitress about how nothing makes sense, and a manager telling the cook, &#34;That has mushrooms all over it!&#34; in an angry tone.

The pizzas and everything I have tried are excellent. Love the zucchini strips small plate. That is big enough to share with 4 people. 
Since Connie&#39;s left the area, I feel we have not had a good deep dish pizza place around that has a convenient way to pick up for carry out. 
That being said, my only complaints are that there is not an area that is close to the restaurant that is reserved for carry out pick up parking and that the deep dish I ordered for pick up was not very warm. I was not late picking it up either. That left me a little disappointed. I have had two great experiences eating at the restaurant so why would pick up be different? 
Both times we dined in we had excellent service. Our wait staff was knowledgable and offered tastes of beers if we weren&#39;t sure. 
This is a good place for families so if you are looking for a quiet Italian restaurant this is not it. The times that I was there the dining room was filled with young kids and the bar had a lot of loud TVs blasting sports. Pick your poison. What do they call this, an &#34;energized&#34; atmosphere?

Steve doesn&#39;t know what he is talking about. This is the worst deep dish I have eaten in the last 30 years.  We ordered the 12&#34; inch supreme. The vegetables were undercooked, the pie was smothered in stewed tomatoes, the edges were supposed to be Carmelized cheese but we&#39;re burnt to a crisp and unchewable.

Unfortunately we placed an order for delivery, live .5 miles away from the place (delivery in convenience of life and my family&#39;s schedule) was promised a 30-45 minute deliver time for my thin crust pizza on a Monday night. Has been an hour and 15 mins and still no signs of a delivery guy, called 3 times and was told the pizza would be here in seconds, and still have nothing. 

Such a bummer for a place we have enjoyed every week since it has been opened.

I&#39;m quite surprised by this since this is a Labriola owned restaurant.  Stopped in for lunch during the week and it was busy but it was mostly groups of people out with co-workers.  We didn&#39;t get any silverware, waited for ever with refills &amp; the wait staff was no where to be found. You would think they were bringing out the food right?  Nope....the  kitchen does that so I&#39;m not even sure what the waitresses were doing the whole time. It was so bizarre. But the pizza was excellent (tried a thin crust) and we also got calamari. Which was also pretty good. Thank god the manager was walking around because he is the one who pretty much waited on us."

The Chicago thin is a good pizza that compares well with the gold standard: Q&#39;s.  The sauce is flavorful and the crust crispy.  The deep dish is also good and the sausage is great to have.  The build your own is nice and they have a good selection of toppings.  The coal-fired offerings are an odd lot.  I really didn&#39;t find any of them to my liking.  That being the case I ordered a simple cheese version.  The pie was good, but not spectacular."

Then when a server arrived, I requested a hockey game to be played on one of the 3 tv&#39;s I saw. The game never came on so I inquired. The waitress said that the carry out guy was too busy!

Agree with others that the interior is nice and the food was good, but it&#39;s just not worth the frustration of &#34;worst in class&#34; service and feeling ripped off from paying too much (including having to pay full price for soft drink refills which is pretty much unheard of).

We walked in, didn&#39;t see anyone, and waited to be greeted. Eventually a girl came out of the side kitchen and told us she&#39;d be with us in a minute, so we waited some more time. 

Finally we sit down and before we can even settle in, our server Debbie rushes towards and nearly screaming asked us what we would like to drink. She brings back the drinks and still screaming rushes us to order. We were not ready so we asked for a few more minutes so she disappeared for 10 minutes. She eventually came back and we ordered our food. I asked her about the potato pancakes they have as a side and she said, &#34;DON&#39;T ORDER THOSE,&#34; still screaming obviously. Apparently, they were supposed to be discontinued- which I understand but telling a guest NOT TO ORDER THOSE, is not as nice as saying unfortunately, those were discontinued. 

We finally order as Debbie is itching to get away from the table, mind you, there were only a few tables in the whole place, and she again disappears. The food was decent but took forever, even though the place was practically empty. And when the food arrived she slammed it onto the table. A little while into our dinner, another table is sat right next to ours and here comes Debbie shouting at them as well. She is shouting to the point that we had to pause conversation until she walked away from the table next to ours! 

We finish our food and wait for her to come back to see if we needed anything else, but instead, she drops the check off. We asked to pay separately and for a slice of pie to go and she looked peeved! She comes back, two checks and a pie slice in hand, and slams it on the table. 

Baker&#39;s Square is good, I love the food and pies but the service there is outrageous. As we were sitting, we saw people come in and stand their confused as they waited to be greeted. Debbie inattentive, not very friendly, and way too loud. You can really tell that none of the staff cares at all. Management really needs to retrain their staff and pay attention to the reviews on here."

There was a huge group of employees talking in a circle by a shabby looking lunch counter, and the ginger-haired manager with an earpiece was one of them. They looked like they were too busy talking about their divorces or other life disappointments. Some blonde lady and her small child were in the circle of fun, too. I am not sure if these managers and employees were confused as to where they were, but they definitely were not in the mood to work. There were a bunch of other customers standing up front who also hadn&#39;t been helped. We decided to cut our losses and go to Colonial.

The worst part was multiple employees made eye contact with us, but they just went back to picking their wedge or talking amongst themselves. There were less than ten people seated and more than ten employees, so I can&#39;t imagine how this place makes any money-especially when a huge percentage of their sales just walked out the door.

Baker&#39;s Square-just close down if you don&#39;t want to be bothered with customers."

This was a last minute decision as me and wifey went to bed bath and beyond and the bakers square is across the street. I must admit I was excited to try something different..
Ill start off by saying the place is very clean, and the menu has ALOT of selections..I asked the waitres if the coffee was good,, she said ohh yea very good,, considering we are from costa rica which carries top of the line coffee, I thought wed try it..This coffee was WELL BELOW  the 2.50 /person they charge,, one thing I will say is bakers square  is VERY pricey  and although the food was tasty, the portions are VERY SMALL...AND ANOTHER company nickel and dimming you for each item you put on , I asked for the order of  hasbrowns , and I kid you not I was gone in 4 spoons charged me 49 cents for onions.

The order: I felt like breakfast I had the 7.89 4 pick  3 eggs  hashbrowns, chocolate pancakes, and  strawberry crepes.  Wifey had for 9.79 3 chicken tenders ,fries ,and veggies  all real small portions ,, and my wife doesn&#39;t eat a lot.., add 3.99 for a small house salad and pie..

The outcome:  my breakfast was similar to what I ordered at nikkarys see review below, and wanted to compare.  The eggs were good, and even DECENT amount , the hashbrowns  were SMALL, the crepes  were SMALLER, and the beef patty was good...clocking my 7.79 advertised order to over 13 bucks with the add ons..still SMALL...

Wifey, said hers was good  but just small...we had 2 slices of pie I had the French silk, I was NOT impressed I thought they made the pies fresh  .. they do not they have them ordered from popin fresh...The waitress asked me how the meal was, the service was just OK, felt like we wernt very welcomed. 

The verdict:  This place is good taste  waaay overpriced for SMALL portions...I received the bill I spotted an error,, the waitress said the computer just charges 29 cents more for the extra egg, when the menu says completely different , the waitress should not of asked me what I thought because as she did I was honest ,, and that almost started an argument about how THEIR pies are the best and they sell to other companies,  my wife back in the day worked for CoCos who made their own pies  FRESH  ...people these pies are NOT fresh...my pie was not at all presented  well.. So I get to the register and explained to the assistant manager,, and she credited the 20 cents....they don&#39;t have good customer service at all.....

Final THOUGHT:   we will not be going here again.. I don&#39;t care if this place has award winning pies they are not fresh, and the service and also management are not humble...I will spend my money elsewhere and get better value...can anyone say  Shinto..??  lol"

I think the host can try to acknowledge people as they stand there waiting for a table which took too long! It seems like one of the biggest and rudest gestures. But then, it doesnt end there. 
The waitress was friendly but slow. Not sure if the kitchen means to make a table order half way through and leave other items pending. So while my daughter happily ate her pancake, my son sat there watching her enjoy it while he waited for his. My husband waited a while for his whip cream too. 
The whole visit was long and dreadful. I feared asking for ketchup or anything. I thought it would just take too long to get.

HORRIBLE IDEA. Service was absolutely TERRIBLE. I was appalled.
We were sitting for about 30-40 mins before our order was even taken. Our waitress was unfriendly and cool, until the very end, when I&#39;m sure she was sensing my irritation. 
We did not get our food until an hour and a half after we arrived at the restaurant. The food was slightly warm at best, as if it had been sitting for awhile, and when it was FINALLY delivered, the waitress attempted to make a joke that it had taken so long because I had gone to the pie counter...!!! 
Speaking of the pie counter--On top of all of this, I tried to go up to the counter to get a slice of pie (from a pie I had ALREADY preordered and purchased) to be delivered to our table for the Birthday we were trying to celebrate, and they were so unorganized they were completely incompetent of doing this.  Not able or willing to understand. It was unbelievable. 
Nearing the two hour mark, and after eating the food that was worse than my college&#39;s cafeteria, we asked to have the pie to go, and left.  
This was my first and most definitely LAST time ever going to Baker&#39;s Square.

I asked her split the check down the middle, so she called up another employee and this woman gave me an elaborate response about how it&#39;s not possible to split down the middle because she would need to use the calculator on her phone and then her manager will see her on the phone and she will get in trouble so the only way she can split it is to charge us per the seat.

When we came in it was hard to figure out where to go. There was a check out counter with several people in line, a large table displaying pies right in the middle of the waiting area, two large parties who looked like they were leaving on the booths, and on the other side of this large assembly, an unmanned hostess stand. We didn&#39;t spot said hostess stand until a few people cleared out, and then it was hard to navigate to it because of the displays and people. 

Once we got to the hostess stand we waited a couple of minutes before a supervisor came and seated us. She handed us menus and took our drink orders, which seemed odd, but we played along. When she came back with our drinks we ordered our pie slices with her, and I was just assuming she was both supervisor and waiter on top of hostessing. I found out I was wrong when our actual waiter came over and threw our plates on the table and walked away. I&#39;d love to tell you this gentleman&#39;s name, but he never gave it to me. 

We were then ignored for the next 40 minutes when he finally came back and asked if we&#39;d like our check. We&#39;d planned on purchasing a pie to go, but I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to interact with this man any longer than we had to, so we just told him yes. 

Now it was our turn to clutter up the entranceway, while we waited several minutes for someone to come to the register so we could pay. Everyone in the building seemed to be doing several jobs at once and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because they were short staffed or if it was bad management. 

The pie was great though. Normally we buy whole pies for the holidays and I think from now on we&#39;re going to stick to that pattern and get our date night pie elsewhere."

Most recently they actually stopped offering oat bran bread as a choice of bread for sandwiches.  Seriously how hard is it to buy a loaf of oat bran bread and stick it on a shelf with the other bread?!  The other bread options (wheat, rye, white) just don&#39;t do it for me, so won&#39;t be coming back here for sandwiches anymore.

They also discontinued the apple walnut salad sandwich which was always a favorite of my mom&#39;s, and prior to these last two bad decisions they also discontinued the Shrimp Feast where you used to be able to get 13 fried shrimp.

Although the interior of the restaurant is generally clean and comfortable, service is usually below average, and the menu.... Well it used to be good but now I just have a hard time finding anything worth eating here anymore other than the pies!  From what I can tell corporate management ignores feedback so not expecting improvement in the menu anytime soon.  Vote with your wallet, as they say!"

Honestly I&#39;m not a Pie guy, but i love the food they serve whether it&#39;s breakfast or lunch or dinner. The best thing in the menu in my opinion is the homemade Mac and cheese. It has bacon, bread crumbs , different kinds of cheese sauces and for a little extra you can add a fried chicken breast. It&#39;s never packed so you&#39;ll get your food quickly and if you check the paper you&#39;ll find coupons occasionally."

With that said, I&#39;m an expert at this place - because I&#39;ve been going here for about 10-20 years - even prior to the remodel.  I&#39;ve been going solid  - for the last five years.  I had quit going prior to that because of a bad server.   No matter what time of day it&#39;s a good place for food!  The breakfast is amazing, not a bad dish on the menu...and don&#39;t get me started about the pie - it&#39;s to DIE for!!!  I&#39;m a big fan of the pot pie, which is my all time favorite.  I LOVE the flakey top crust and the Turkey Pot Pie is my favorite comfort food.  I generally go on the weekend and our server for about five years is Terry!!  She is by FAR the best in the place.  When she is serving our table  - your experience is top notch!  They have an awesome 8oz steak for about $11 bucks and it&#39;s always cooked to your order.  They are little light on the serving for the fries, but can you ever have enough fries - so if they short you just tell them about it and they will bring you out some more. I don&#39;t really ever remember having to send anything back...It&#39;s that good.  I&#39;ve given this place a five stars because overall the food is great, service is superb and it&#39;s consistent and always clean.  They have great sourdough toast and the country fried steak and gravy are to die for.  The salad and fruit is always super fresh.  They have reasonable combo meals with the PIE - the strawberry rhubarb is my favorite - alamode - heated just a little with the ice cream on the side.  I&#39;ve eaten here at Thanksgiving too - and It&#39;s pretty AWESOME!!!   

The only down side however is the manager always seems to have an attitude - and he&#39;s a complete jerk - but I just try to avoid him.  Keep him away from the customers and away from the register  - and you will be fine.  That&#39;s always been my only complaint.  I don&#39;t have to give you his name - because if you go there  - you will be able to tell right away who he is.  Be particular too about the server - because they are not created equal.  Ask for Terry first, then Jennifer and you should be fine for breakfast  - in the evening it&#39;s a crap shoot, but the food is always good."

There are all kinds of varieties so I dunno if it&#39;s possible! The service at this Bakers Square has been excellent. The waitresses have always been very polite and very attentive. Both attributes I can appreciate!

The food on the otherhand, it&#39;s not bad... Not the best but not bad. I feel like they have changed the menu every time I go back in and it&#39;s stuff that is not too intersting. But, that&#39;s a small price to pay for the pie. And yes, I know I can just purchase the pie to go but, the Limeade is pretty good. So I can live with alright food, good limeaid and fantastic pie each time the mood strikes for Bakers Square!"

Nothing outstanding, but nothing awful, either. The problem with this restaurant is the service. It is always hit or miss. They should change the name of this restaurant to &#34;Las Vegas&#34;, since you will always gamble on the service. Some of the wait staff are excellent. The Latino gentleman (Marcellino?) is an example of a great waitperson. It&#39;s unfortunate Baker&#39;s Square can&#39;t clone him. Other waitpersons here act as if they are doing you a favor waiting on you. That attitude can extend to the hosts as well. Today, I asked the host (the guy who looks like he has a dead animal growing out of the top of his head) for some assistance paying our bill, and he told me I had to wait in line for the cashier rather than offer assistance himself. There were ten people in line in front of me, but the host couldn&#39;t be bothered. Instead, he stood there the entire time twirling flowers in his hands (it is Mother&#39;s Day today) watching the counter staff be overwhelmed. Quite a bad overall image. Inconsistent service is a sign of apathetic management and reflects poorly on the overall image of the restaurant.  This is an issue that can be easily solved if management teaches employees to be motivated to assist customers. That&#39;s the difference between a successful restaurant, and the restaurant you patronize only as a last resort, if at all."

It was my favorite place to meet friends over my lunch hour and I felt kind of lost when they closed the Wheaton, Villa Park and Downers Grove locations.

Last weekend I was at a class in Aurora and on my way I passed this Baker&#39;s Square. I daydreamed about their stir fry salad throughout the class and decided to stop on my way home, even though I was by myself.

I was nicely greeted, asked if I preferred a booth or a table (booth!) and was seated right away. The restaurant was pretty crowded at 1:30 on a Saturday. It was bright and sunny inside, clean and looked much nicer than the locations I used to go to. My waitress was very pleasant, was patient with my excitement that they still have my stir fry chicken salad, and even was willing to ask the cook to prepare it like I used to ask the Wheaton location to prepare it for me (no mushrooms, light on the sauce, no dressing). She was very kind and accomodating. It came out very quickly, with tons of chicken and colorful vegetables over the lettuce and was even better than I remembered it. I was in heaven! They now serve foccacia bread on the side and that was good too. 

They had changed their menu quite a bit in the past couple of years but still had my standby choices- the stir fry chicken salad and the chicken caesar salad. I think that little pie flip thing with pictures is genious- I wonder if people ever leave without ordering some kind of pie after looking through all those pictures and descriptions! 

I ordered a piece of triple berry pie for me and a slice of strawberry rhubarb for my husband to go and they were nice sized pieces.

My server brought me my pie and check quickly. 

I was certainly not disappointed. I know it&#39;s a chain and so maybe I&#39;m lame for thinking it&#39;s so awesome, but I am not ashamed!  :)"

Favorite Pies:
When picking up pies for parties, we usually get banana cream pie or strawberry pie (huge berries!).  If we have a craving for sweet, nothing beats the oh-so-yummy french silk.

Atmosphere and Service:
This weekend I dined in for an afternoon catch up session with a friend.  We were intrigued by some of the new menu items, but in the end enjoyed sodas and pie slices.  (I had a pomegranate limeade and a peanut butter cream pie.  Odd pair, but still tasty!). The waitress was friendly and patient. Overall, it was the perfect casual place to relax and chat.

Why Not 5 Stars?
I gave a rating of 4 stars instead 5 because the place felt a little worn down and could benefit from some newer furniture or/and decor."

So with out hesitating we came here again for another delicious breakfast. Well, it turns out that we were wrong! The service was awful. The lady who waited us was grouchy and seemed like didn&#39;t care at all of what she was doing. Anyway, I could care less if she gave us good service or not because it&#39;s her reputation after all, but what I was looking forward was some delicious food. She comes takes our order and for this one I order the egg white veggie omelet(something supposedly healthy) so I wait and the food comes out, then I see my omelet and it&#39;s draining oil by the gallon! Then I grab a napkin and try to take some oil out of it by pressing down on it and letting the napkin absorb all the oil. So when I do that, I see a big puddle of oil forming on the plate of how much oil was coming out of it! And did I mention it was a &#34;healthy&#34; egg white omelet? Well I think she must of got the wrong order cause I did not order eggs and veggies soaked in oil! Never coming back to this place again!

 The four square breakfast is a GREAT deal, where you can pick 4 menu items for $6.95 - which is amazing for someone as indecisive as me.  So I can have an omelette AND crepes without having to spend big for 2 meals and end up with leftovers I&#39;d probably have to throw away.

- They don&#39;t take reservations
- Call 30 minutes before you arrive to put your name on the list. I do this every time and wait about 5 minutes before our table for 4 is ready
- They have complimentary coffee for people waiting
- There is a good amount of seats while you wait but there are almost always people standing also

The food is always yummy. They give you great portion sizes. Sometimes the service is a little slow, but with a packed house I think they do just fine.

After having one breakfast at the Marriott I decided that I would venture out going forward.  This restaurant came up on my Yelp search for breakfast in the area.  This place is easily seen from Butterfield but is on an interior road.

I entered the restaurant and really liked the décor.  It was large but quaint and cozy without being hot.  Someone really put the time and effort into this place.  I was greeted and seated immediately. I opened the menu and observed what looks to be a typical breakfast menu but I did notice that they had several poached egg dishes.

I was greeted by my server and was given a coffee pot just for my table.  I placed my order and a short while later my food arrived.  The food looked good and tasted good also.  I had eggs, hash browns, bacon, Canadian Bacon and pancakes. I even got a to-go cup for my coffee.  I know breakfast is hard to screw up so I wish I could have had the chance to eat lunch here.

With the choice of 3 ingredients, I chose pepper jack cheese, spinach, and bacon. The very dry mixture was fairly tasteless with the cheese poured on top.

Our food came out almost immediately after ordering which makes me a bit skeptical of how fresh it is.  My skillet was alright but was definitely lacking flavor, it was mostly made up of onions and peppers and little bits of thinly sliced beef.  I think he was satisfied with his dish since you really can&#39;t screw up scrambled eggs and sausages.  

Honey Jam is a step up from IHOP but can&#39;t compare to my favorite Egg Harbor Cafe."

Ordered the strawberries and cream cheese french toast with the Philly skillet. The presentation was poor and the meat tasted very cheap.

My wife and I have each ordered a different thing each of our 3 times here, which means we have combined to have 6 different entrees, the commonality between them is that all were expertly prepared and presented.

I would highly recommend the Banana-Blueberry Crunch Cakes or the Breakfast Burrito.

Service is fast and friendly."

I honestly don&#39;t remember why I liked this place. 

Don&#39;t get me wrong: the ambiance of the restaurant itself is cozy. It feels like you&#39;re in a really large cottage dining with a large family with the way the place is designed inside and their decoration choice. When it comes to the food itself, I just wasn&#39;t impressed at all. 

My friend got the potatoe pancakes which ended up looking exactly like hash brown patties served with sour cream and applesauce. I felt so bad because she was super excited to have potatoe pancakes since she hadn&#39;t had them in a long time. I just couldn&#39;t believe the small portion compared to the price. I was embarrassed that I even suggested the place when I saw her plate. 

I got an omelette which was just bland and mediocre at best. There was just nothing exciting about this experience at all. Maybe we caught them on an off day, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever give them a second try. Especially since we dropped a pretty penny for food that just wasn&#39;t very good at all. 

I&#39;ve been to way better breakfast places - I would recommend going somewhere else if you&#39;re craving a good breakfast."

For how cute it is inside, the service could be better and same goes with the food. I would say it is more inconsistent than anything. 

I&#39;ve been here about 4 or 5 times, and each time I leave feeling underwhelmed with what I ate. Especially my most recent experience. Our waitress was kind and friendly but forgot about us a lot, and that isn&#39;t the first time this has happened here. 

The sweet foods are way better than their savory dishes. I made the mistake of ordering a skillet the last time; it was NOT good at all. The potatoes were overcooked, dry and bland, and the toppings were not mixed well in the skillet. All the spinach was shoved to one side, like a mini salad on the left of the skillet. There was hardly any cheese and the tomatoes were not fresh and did not compliment the skillet like you would expect. I was severely disappointed with the dish. I dowsed it with hot sauce and ketchup to try to get more flavor and salvage the skillet.  The crepes my friend ordered were actually very tasty and I would definitely order those again. 

I&#39;ve also ordered french toast and the cinnamon roll french toast in the past and thoroughly enjoyed those dishes in the past. 

I haven&#39;t tried their lunch items and maybe I will. It&#39;s a good spot to meet with people, the decor is nice, and the ambiance is chill."

Went out of my way to come here and well... it wasn&#39;t very good.

We eat at a different breakfast spot at least 6x/month and as you all know I either review a spot when I&#39;m exceptionally pleased or disappointed.   

Son ordered off the children&#39;s menu and had a better plate than mine.  I&#39;m shocked there&#39;s more than one location.  

I ordered the country fried steak and hash browns with eggs... just... not great.

The eggs were requested fried / over-hard and they came out slimey, &#34;plasticy&#34; and undercooked (the yolk especially).

The chai tea latte was the best thing I had the opportunity to taste... as little as it was for the price. 

Not a good experience, but it looks as if I&#39;m not alone on how it went. 

The quantity in high ratings are here, but if you look at the reviews of those who are disappointed you will see how it all ties together. There&#39;s nothing here for a true Foodie, buy if you enjoy saying you ate at the place owned by Portillos... do you."

It serves breakfast and lunch with a brisk takeout service.  If you ordered coffee with your meal, they offer a &#34;to go&#34; cup which our server, Lauren ( who I noticed was mentioned in another review), says makes a great hand warmer.  My family and I usually go for breakfast.  However diners do have the option of ordering off the lunch menu even as early as 8:00 am.  I can vouch for this as sometimes a BLT with soup and onion rings does the trick for me.  The quality of the food is excellent and prices are comparable to other neighborhood places.  What puts it over the top is the service. Ask for Lauren  she is efficient, professional, and her smile will definitely have you smiling too.  She is a &#34;people person&#34; and you can tell she enjoys what she is doing!

Today on November 14th, at 12:15 pm was my first time dining in at Honey Jam and I had one of the worst experiences of my life. Our server rolled his eyes at us ( my boyfriend and I) when we repeated the order to him and still brought us the wrong order ( which was repeated twice). We let that go. He then brought us our check. As first time diners here we left the money on the table and exited the restaurant. As we were pulling out of the restaurant, Susan the manager ran after us and loudly in front of two other customers outside stated &#34; YOU DID NOT PAY THE BILL.&#34; I stated right away that we did pay the bill and the money was on the table. There was no apology on her end a nothing else was said. She went back inside. I own my own business and can tell you that CUSTOMER SERVICE is huge. One, we received bad service from the server who made us feel uncomfortable anytime we asked for any additions. Two, not one person told us that the bill was to be paid up front. Three, before the general manager of a restaurant made such a huge assumption to tell us &#34;we didn&#39;t pay our bill&#34;, should have checked the table first. Four, when I did call back to tell her how I felt, I received a very dry not so genuine apology."

You can easily expect to wait 30 minutes to an hour.  Lots of families and lots of kids.  Not a bad thing, but be prepared.

Service is okay.  Considering their typically swamped, it&#39;s not a surprise that they&#39;re running around like crazy, but again, be prepared to wait on simple things like refills on water and other beverages.

The food is on par with IHOP or Denny&#39;s.  You get better options, but the quality of the food is practically the same.  The only bonus is you get bigger portions, but you&#39;re also paying for them, so that definitely evens out.

Solid time out, good with families.  I have yet to try the lunch menu, but I&#39;d imagine that it falls in line around the same quantity and quality."

My daughter and I both wanted breakfast, so we were focused on the breakfast options. The menu has a lot of choices, so there should be something for everyone. My daughter got an eggs benedict, and I got an omelet. My daughter loved her eggs benedict. She also got a side of chocolate chips pancakes. She really loved what she got. My omelet was decent. It was a little heavy on the ham and needed more cheese. All in all in was good. My hash browns were cold, but my pancakes were nice and fluffy. The prices are pretty standard for the area.

I&#39;m going to gush about their waffles and french toast.  My favorite waffle has to be their Belgium Sundae waffle.  They serve a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream on top with chocolate sauce.

However, I have yet to visit Honey Jam and have every meal at the table arrive as what was ordered. On one occasion, they had to make my fiancee&#39;s meal three times before he received what he asked for. They kept putting bacon where he had asked for broccoli, and he doesn&#39;t eat pork. If you order your food to-go, make sure you check it while you&#39;re still in the restaurant!

The service is friendly and prompt like 80% of the time. Unfortunately, on our last visit, we were seated by the hostess, and waited over ten minutes before we were acknowledged by a server. Even then, she wasn&#39;t ready to even take drink orders (for our table of three) and had to return to the table several minutes later. She did not apologize for our wait, and behaved as if we hadn&#39;t been waiting ten minutes to order coffee. I understand that she may have been busy, but a manager also passed our table several times while we were waiting and he neglected to acknowledge us as well. A table adjacent to ours (with a different server) had ordered their meals before we had even been greeted.

If it hadn&#39;t been for our intense hunger and faith in the actual food, we probably would have left. We all felt better after receiving our food (and having one meal re-made into what was ordered), but the next time I chose a brunch spot, it wasn&#39;t Honey Jam. I will probably return eventually, but there is plenty to choose from out here."

Fast forward to this past Sunday and the oatmeal portion of the menu was completely ignored.

Can you blame us?

With decadent things like strawberry cheesecake french toast, amazing egg skillets, and banana bread baked goods, we ignored the doctors&#39; prescribed diets in favor of delicious expanding waistlines.

Okay, that was dramatic, no? Maybe a little overly-so? 

In a nutshell, the food is amazing, and if you can&#39;t find something you like, you&#39;re probably too picky. 

The service was excellent. Prices are pretty fair. Glasses were refilled often.  
The food came out quickly, and we did not have to wait for our table. Why? Well, I called ahead. They don&#39;t do reservations, but if you call ahead and put your name on the list, when you get there they happily seat you almost as soon as you walk in.

Maybe I shouldn&#39;t tell you that. 

Damnit."

When I expressed by disappointment to the manager about the 2 separate increases in price over a 2 month span, she shrugged her shoulders and said &#34;I don&#39;t make the prices&#34;.

We finally got a chance to and were not disappointed in the food at all!  Maybe a little in the pricy range for a breakfast place, however...

My dad got 2 Eggs any style w/ sausage links and hash browns and toast for $7.75.  Of course, this was a fine breakfast meal that my dad enjoyed; however, he agreed that we&#39;ve never paid this much for such a simple dish with such simple ingredients.  

My mom ordered the Spinach Scrambler - homemade crepes filled w/ scrambled eggs, sautéed spinach, bacon and cream cheese which was served with a side of hollandaise sauce for $8.45.  Mom enjoyed the dish so much that she actually finished both crepes!  

The boy ordered Steak &amp; Eggs which consisted of Black Angus Ranch Cut steak cooked to order and served with two eggs any style for $13.95.  Of course, the meal was very good and he enjoyed it.  Though he has had the same cut of steak at other breakfast places for much less.

I asked for a half order of the Biscuits &amp; Gravy (Flaky biscuits topped with a creamy
country sausage gravy with two eggs any style - Hash browns not included - $7.45).  Instead of getting a half order everything was priced out at ala carte.  This made it even more expensive.  If I had known this, I would have just taken the full order!  

They were really busy and though they told us it would be an hour wait it was only 20 minutes.  It seemed like the front of the house was having a hard time managing who was attempting to pay their bills and check in for a table.  The food was good; don&#39;t get me wrong.  We were really disappointed in the prices!  In comparison to other breakfast places for the cost of this type of food it just shouldn&#39;t cost as much to the consumer!"

The ham does not taste the same. The service got slow and they look confused and always seem to be apologizing for the new owner.

The exterior parking lot, building site and inside restaurant interior was very welcoming-we were initially excited and really impressed. We were greeted right away and our waitress Debbie was very prompt, friendly, knowledgeable, and &#39;Johnny on the spot&#39;. She gave us a few minutes to peruse the menu as there were lots of breakfast entre&#39; choices. All the while, there was this woman standing at the booth behind us who was talking in a normal to loud voice to 2 customers seated behind us. Sounded like she knew them as she was talking, and talking, and talking, and talking...(not whispering)..about a family wedding??? As our waitress Debbie came back, we were ready to order. We placed our breakfast order and whew, the lady finally left. As we were waiting for our food and conversing, the lady came back and began talking, and talking and talking some more. She apparently had no clue how RUUD it was to disturb our dining experience. Our waitress was wonderful, and our food came in a timely manner BUT, I&#39;m sorry to say, the food was not hot at all. The coffee was good, my pancake was light and fluffy but the main entre&#39; was average to below average portion for the price we paid. My friends eggs were not cooked as ordered and the hash browns we both had were WAY over crisp. The meals were just OK at best but there are so many other dining options in the area, I would not recommend this place-we were truly disappointed and will not be back when visiting the area again. We were told Portello&#39;s (across the road) sold this business to the current owners. *******As we left disappointed but ready to pay our bill, I asked one of the employees if the lady (who was still at the table there and just wouldn&#39;t shut up) was an employee and (lo&#39; and behold) I was told she was the GENERAL MANAGER!!!

This place is really adorable. I ordered the countryside skillet which was really tasty. Love all the ingredients. It also came with a side of pancakes. That is a lot of food! I also ordered their home-squeezed orange juice. I ordered a large but the cup was pretty small so imagine how small a small cup of OJ is. My husband ordered one of their croissants sandwiches. He thought his was okay.

Overall, decent experience and enjoyed the food. Would come back again.

But my last trip there was pretty disappointing, I&#39;m not sure if it was just a bad day or if Honey Jam has slipped in quality.

Our meal didn&#39;t start off that well.. the &#34;host&#34; lead us to our table, but he didn&#39;t even make eye contact or say follow me or anything. He just walked off, when he noticed we weren&#39;t following he waved our menus over to follow him, he lead us to our booth and tossed the menus down on the table and walked off. He didn&#39;t say a word to us.  It was a Sunday morning, I get it.. I was tired too... But I just I thought it was more odd than rude and it just started our meal off on a sour tone.

Our Server comes, and she was great. Very polite and nice. We ordered, I had the Greek Frittata and my girlfriend had the Tuscan omelette and we split a side of bacon.....Our food was then served to us quickly.... too quickly. After we ordered less than 5 minutes passed before we got our food. We both commented on how quick it was... we soon found out why.
The hash brown sides that we both had with our orders were completely under cooked.. parts were just raw hashed potatoes.  Just looking at them you could tell they were under cooked, only a few parts of the top of the hash brown were even slightly browned. The rest was just a white mush of under cooked potatoes.   Our Frittata and Omelette were lukewarm, mushy and bland.. with the way they tasted and the quick turnaround for our order I&#39;m assuming they were premade and kept warm and not made to order. Another small thing that bothered us is that we had pancakes for our side, and while most tables were getting fresh warm syrup from the kitchen our waitress grabbed an already used, sticky syrup from another table that was less than a quarter full... she wiped it down right in front our table before setting it down

I give one star for the pancakes we had as a side... they are pretty good.

And I give one star for always being able to get a quick table here. The times I&#39;ve been here have been during busy Sunday mornings and there has never been a wait. 

Bottom line is that when there are so many other great breakfast places around, with better quality and cheaper prices, there&#39;s no real reason to go out of your way to go to Honey Jam."

The menu has good breakfast options with a few twists but nothing to write home about. Coffee is kept warm and service with a smile isn&#39;t enough to forget about jazz elevator music playing in the background.

Nothing too exciting with the dish presentation on poorly executed egg benedict. Homemade hash browns would probably bring a much better signature to most items on the menu."

I think it&#39;s more about the management of the chain, than the food or service. On the menu, substitutions are discouraged and stated in a way that makes me feel like they have a &#34;take it or leave it&#34; attitude to my meal. 

Also, getting any information about what I&#39;m eating is more difficult than hacking into the CIA databases. Once, I asked our server if she could tell me the portions of the ingredients in my breakfast skillet. She was suspicious that I was some sort of spy for the owners, and she told me that she was risking her job to give me the list. All I wanted to know was how many calories the dish had so that I could make a responsible choice in the portion of food that I ate.  She did smuggle the information to us (Cold War style), and we gave her a 40% tip. 

We don&#39;t come here as often as we once did, but what does tip the scale in their favor is the ability to call ahead to add our name to the wait before we arrive. 

It&#39;s a good place, but the owner&#39;s attitude toward their customers could be better."

Verdict:  They didn&#39;t have anything that was close to the crack that is the dipped beef, BUT they were pretty good.  

I realized walking in to the place that I LOVE corporate (or REALLY TINY) breakfast places.  I know those are opposites, but hear me out.  I either need it to be big and bold and clean or tiny and cozy and clean.  Either way, I need it to be clean.  I&#39;m not used to that in a breakfast place (maybe this leads to my hatred of breakfast?) because they are usually the same old things in a different dirty location.  Not Honey Jam, my friends.  They are big, and fancy, and clean.  And they have plenty of seating, lots of servers (Who are actually nice! Imagine that!), and good food.      

We tried the regular everyday breakfast (you know...eggs, bacon, hash browns, toast, etc.) and the breakfast burrito.  Both were pretty decent.  Everything was fresh and tasty...the only real gripes were the bacon (meh...it was good, but not AWESOME) and the burrito needed some more oomph of some sort (not sure what...just SOMETHING).  I&#39;m honestly happy that they had a Mexican section at all (on the menu, not in the restaurant.) because that&#39;s the only breakfast food I will eat, and that they also had a lunch menu (which had some Portillo&#39;s goods on it!).

Overall, I&#39;m still on the search for the breakfast place that WOWs me, but this&#39;ll do in the meantime."

Even though she had a full section, she was attentive. She even bought a to go coffee for us when we were cashing out. Food which I had the Denver omelette was awesome. The wait time was not bad for the food considering the place was at capacity."

The restaurant was pretty full for a Friday morning. The atmosphere is very homey. The waitress was  friendly. There was two of us who ordered coffee and the waitress brought us an insulated carafe filled with hot coffee. Easy access. 
I ordered the corn beef hash skillet with pancakes and they were delicious. The menu has breakfast and lunch options. I like that they have specialty pancakes and French toast. One of my friends ordered tiramisu pancakes.  Definitely going to go back for those!
After we packaged up left overs (portions are pretty big) the waitress asked us of any of us wanted a coffee to go! How nice and thoughtful! What a great nice gesture."

We had an amazing server (Christina) who really was able to balance how busy she was with great and courteous service. She was friendly, fast, and very accommodating. Even though the place was packed (and I heard that it was actually considered &#39;slow&#39;) she was able to have a bit of small chat with us and engage in a bit of our conversation without sacrificing service or being considered rude. Her performance alone will make us return again. We sat for what was probably considered &#34;longer&#34; than typical for the restaurant since it was a very high and quick turnover but we never felt rushed in the least bit. I&#39;m not sure if they tip pool at this restaurant or not but she truly made us have a great morning and she deserves the recognition for it. 

I&#39;ve always seen the place absolutely packed, so if you&#39;re looking for a &#39;quiet&#39; breakfast experience for your 90 year old grandma, that&#39;s just not going to happen. But if you do want good food with a twist and fast, then you&#39;re in the right place.  

As for the food...it was delicious as to be expected. We had a morning with no kids so we completely wanted to enjoy ourselves and holy crap did we gorge. I&#39;m almost positive I gave myself diabetes after this trip (no offense to anyone who does struggle with that ailment). I had a latte with caramel (it&#39;s caramel sauce, not syrup-which I completely prefer), the old man had a freakin&#39; pot of coffee-which initially didn&#39;t taste right and Christina was more than happy to bring us a new one. 

We started with monkey bread...yeah, that&#39;s right, they have monkey bread. And it was our breakfast &#39;appetizer&#39;. It. Was. Delicious. Get it. Eat some of it, take the rest home and have it the next day (which is what I&#39;m doing right now, it reheats great). 

Also, please don&#39;t judge me...I ordered the banana bread french toast, a side order of biscuits/gravy AND had half of the old man&#39;s hash browns. To be honest I ate the biscuits/gravy and then took most of the banana bread french toast home since it was sooooo absolutely rich and delicious and would freeze great for my kid&#39;s breakfast Monday morning (besides, I have monkey bread! woot). Two people who had walked by asked what I had ordered...I suggest you order it too. It was very VERY rich and covered with bananas. 

The old man ordered a regular order of french toast which he completely enjoyed as well, the shredded hash browns were cooked perfectly (not greasy, and amazingly crispy). 

Our total bill was $39.99 which we didn&#39;t think was horrible given the fact that we did order two &#34;special&#34; items, but I do completely agree with some of the items on the menu being overpriced- the regular order of biscuits &amp; gravy with two eggs was like $8 which I mean, I can make for $2 at home but it&#39;s not necessarily about the &#39;price&#39;, you eat out for the experience. 

When we went their electrical system had basically gone down and they had to manually do credit card slips, which wasn&#39;t that big of a deal and they seemed to handle it all very well. (A lot of places completely lose their minds when they have to do anything &#34;manually&#34; because they have no clue how to use the machines to do it) 

All in all we were extremely happy with our experience and would definitely go back and hopefully be able to request her the next time we are able. Oh and be prepared to park in some ridiculous spot, the lot fills up very quick!"

Fortunately, I am extremely happy to say I truly enjoyed my experience at Honey Jame Cafe!

The service was not bad. The food came really fast and tasted good, so I definitely think the kitchen deserves 5 stars. I had the Monkey Waffle. It was delicious and I 100% recommend it. The atmosphere was cozy and warm. The reason I did not give 5 stars is because other aspects of the service (waiter, cashier) left something to be desired. They were quite slow, and there were several errors. Overall, I would recommend this place to a friend. I fully intend to return next time I am in the area nad hungry."

The place is really cozy with a big fireplace in the middle and a really nice atmosphere. Our server was super friendly and on top on everything! I love how they set a pot of coffee and water on your table so your coffee never gets empty. I can only imagine it&#39;s much easier for the servers too. I think every breakfast place should do this!

I opted for the english muffin with veggies and poached egg on top. I subbed hash brown for fruit because the menu said you could do that, but I was charged 75 cents. O_0   I love me some strong coffee but I found the coffee to be a little bitter but the food was really delicious!"

I had the &#34;strawberry cheesecake french toast&#34;. $9 a pop.

It&#39;s 3 pieces of thick bread- with crusty crust. Honestly, a little too crusty as it didn&#39;t get wet enough with the sauce.It annoyed me to work my way past the hardness of the crust. 
There was maybe 3 strawberries on it- ok, I would have liked more strawberry flavor.  I am a big fan of the strawbery. Red fruit is the best.

Each piece has a layer of the &#34;cheesecake&#34; sauce on it- making the inside of the bread nice and wet with tasty flavor.  Once i got to the inside, the moistness was great and I enjoyed it.

I don&#39;t think it was much of a cheesecake flavor - more sugary - but it was good anyway."

Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and since my sister got married last night, I decided I need a veggie filled omelet to soak up the hang over that I had. I haven&#39;t had a hang over since Operation Iraqi Freedom. Not really, but I don&#39;t drink that much and I was starving.

The coffee was mediocre...but since it was just myself and my dining companion we were seated after about a ten minute wait.  I knew I wanted a veggie omelet so I went with the aforementioned sans cheese adding jalapeno!

 My first problem was having gourmet pancakes but no whole grain/buckwheat/pumpkin? COME ON HJC! If you want this Elite Yelpers&#39; approval you&#39;ve got to get everyone&#39;s tastes covered! What if I wanted pancakes and had a gluten allergy? I went with the buttermilk cakes and blueberries? $2 for an antixoxidant boost? C&#39;mon HJC!

There are many options around Yorktown Mall for breakfast and this area as well. Red Apple Pancake House in Carol Stream is my favorite by far, but Jam N Jelly in Darien, Juicy-0 (which is adjacent to this place almost), and Blueberry Hill would be better options! 

I won&#39;t be back here. Not saying I don&#39;t love the restaurant group, but my non fluffy omelet, mediocre buttermilk pancakes, and coffee for the high price? And the lack of options! 

I feel terrible posting this review that is so negative, but I only want quality in my breakfast, not quantity which I feel is the focus at HJC!"

They had these little stands to hold the infant car seats which I thought was very nice.   It&#39;s the first &#34;infant friendly&#34; place I&#39;ve been to, or at least been to since I&#39;ve become a father... I probably never noticed before lol.  That said, they don&#39;t have a changing table in the mens&#39; room.  Although this made it easier to ask my wife to change the diaper instead :)

But enough about that, let&#39;s get to the food.  I noticed some Portillo&#39;s mainstays on the menu (like the chopped salad, and poppyseed muffin).  But of course I went for the breakfast.  I always say I want to get crepes but then I feel like it&#39;s not gonna fill me up.  So today I tried the banana fosters crepes.  They were so sweet, basically a dessert.  But,  that is what I ordered, so what can I say.  They were good, but I think next time I will have to try one of those gourmet pancakes.

My wife wasn&#39;t in the mood for brunch, so she ordered the chicken salad.  It was pretty tasty.

Anyway, I&#39;ll probably go back.  The service was pretty good and we were in and out fairly quickliy"

It can be painful to watch delicious looking items flash on the screen like bananas foster crepes, skillets a plenty, Belgian waffles overflowing with fresh fruit and whipped cream, all while waiting for your table. But then your buzzer goes off and you get over it. 

So, yeah, if you want breakfast on Saturday or Sunday morning, prepare to wait a bit. Our party of four waited about 30 minutes this past Sunday at 9:30 am. Once we were seated by the ever-so-friendly host, we read the details of many of the menu items we just saw on the aforementioned screen. Our server Sabrina was really great - very efficient and offered a recommendation for (almost) every category of breakfast eat.

I chose the very berry Belgian waffle - a perfectly formed circle of carb topped with light and airy whipped cream and a boatload of berries: strawberries, blackberries and blueberries. Pair this crave worthy meal with a glass of freshly squeezed OJ and I left one full and happy camper. 

Other points to note: Prices are reasonable, tables are set close together and the parking lot can be a hot mess. Wear your patient pants if you&#39;re heading to breakfast on Saturday or Sunday!"

I&#39;ve always ordered an English muffin until the other day when I had the fluffy, flavorful pancakes. I&#39;m more of a Starbucks espresso drinker, but I could drink Honey Jam&#39;s coffee until I&#39;m floating west on Butterfield Road. While their prices are definitely not low, the $8.75 for the omelet meal is similar to nearby places for a similar breakfast meal, and I think Honey Jam trumps all the neighboring others."

We visited for a late supper and had a burger and a whitefish special along with the Brussels sprouts salad.  The salad may have been the most flavorful dish, and it was tasty and filling.  The whitefish was good, the burger was OK, but the Cheddar and bacon flavors were drowned out by other ingredients.   Fries were excellent, and the coffee was top-notch.   

No service issues whatsoever.  Our server was friendly, skillful, informative, and prompt.  We were well taken care of.   

Their desktop Web site clearly shows US Route 66, which they have re-labeled as US Route 89.  There is a US Route 89 which goes north and south just east of the Rockies.  Seems like kind of a clueless renumbering."

Place wasn&#39;t that busy and service was pretty slow. Took a long time before I even got a bowl of soup. The inside of the restaurant was very nice and casual. Was a bit loud though and imagine it would be even worse on a Friday/Saturday night. 

I will start by saying that I compete in BBQ competitions and was interested in trying their recommended items from the &#34;Smokehouse&#34; section of the menu. I ordered the Trio (Pulled Pork, Ribs, Brisket). First was the Pulled Pork.... The meat itself was very tender and had a great taste. The bark on the pork was horrible. Burnt/bitter taste. I imagine it may be the wood they use or the fact that it was simply just not smoked properly. Let a very bad aftertaste. The brisket had a great taste as well as the bark on it however it was very dry. Probably sat on the warmers too long. The ribs were also a tad on the dry side and the tops were burnt from being in the heat too long. Another bad aftertaste.

My wife ordered the 89 Burger. She loved it and said it was very juicy and tasty. The fries are also very good. I guess I should have gone the burger route instead.

Now I get that the place borders Hinsdale and is close to Oak Brook but Westmont and Clarendon Hills are middle working class neighborhoods. The pricing is a bit outrageous and I imagine that comes from being a &#34;Ditka Restaurant Group&#34; company. I did not expect the &#34;house and/or well&#34; vodka to be Stoli and cost $8 per drink. Most restaurants charge between $4-6 for a well drink. My wife and I usually order just two drinks each with dinner when we go out and between the alcohol and food, the bill was $88.00. For that price I could go to a steak house and get bread, soup, salad and steak for the same price per person. I don&#39;t think any place that has been in this location has lasted more than 3-4 years and I do not expect this one to last either in my opinion. Not the right neighborhood for this type of $$$ and sorry to say but if anyone knows good BBQ, this is NOT the place to go."

Let me start out by saying service was top notch, from the hostess to one server, who we then asked to switch tables, to a different server. They were knowledgable and polite and I&#39;m a pretty hard critic. For starters we had the salad and the chicken wings. The Sonoma coast chicken salad was pretty good, just enough dressing, chicken cut from the whole breast, and good ratios of bacon, corn, and avocado. The chicken wing rub was on the spicy side, which I like.

For an entree I had the pork chop which came with steamed spinach and some sort of apple mango chutney and bourbon glaze sauce which was very well executed. My girl got the ribs which honestly were not good at all. Tasted like sulfur and you have to love a very deep smoked flavor to think they are good. 

For dessert I had a cup of the vanilla bean ice cream and a coffee. Typical but good whole cream and flavorful ice cream. 

If the ribs were better I would have given 5 star but they were pretty below average. I still highly recommend. They also have a full bar and flat screens everywhere to watch the game. Ps our server &#34;V&#34; is the man."

Normally, I don&#39;t review a place unless I&#39;ve eaten there more than once.  And I don&#39;t usually do a breakfast-specific review for a restaurant that specializes in lunch/dinner.  BUT, brunch was so freakin&#39; awesome.  While the brunch menu is limited, I think the options are sufficient.  It would be nice to see a takeoff or version of eggs benedict, but they have personalized omelettes!

Started out with bloody marys, mine being a virgin.  I think it&#39;s the Ditka bloody Mary mix, but it works for me and the Hub!  Just the perfect blend of spicy and flavorful, not too sweet and just enough kick to start the day.  The Hub an original and it came with h&#39;ordeuvres!

So, when I go somewhere for brunch for the first time, I try to keep it simple...so I got the steak &amp; eggs.  The Hub got the Pot Roast Hash.  Our meals came with toast.  But our waitress brought out fresh syrup with  jellies.  We were confused because neither of us ordered pancakes, but our waitress said that&#39;s just the way they do their setup.  I took it as a sign and ordered a side of buttermilk pancakes.

OK, so where do I begin?  How about kitchen, fantastic, front of the house needs work?  The kitchen alone still makes the experience worthwhile!   My eggs were over easy, my steak wasn&#39;t a leather-looking shoe sole but a real skirt steak cooked perfectly.  The potatoes were well-done, as requested, mixed with colorful peppers and seasoned perfectly!  The Hub&#39;s pot roast hash was equally delicious.  The roast tasted like it was braised in wine and was tender and juicy!  And the pancakes were huge and tasted like the pancakes from the olden days...light and fluffy, sweet but not too much.

Now, this place has only been open a few monthes (Memorial Day, 2016), so I think they&#39;re still working out the bugs in the service department.  But the kitchen is so right on, the lack of quality service can easily be overlooked.  What I do find surprising is the staff.  For a Ditka-related venture, they&#39;re awfully young and inexperienced, even though they&#39;ve only been open a few monthes.  But that must be because of the location.  But I guess time will tell!  I just hope this doesn&#39;t ruin the chances of this potential awesome kitchen sticking around!!

FYI, the prices MAY sound a bit high when you look at the menu for the first time, BUT in comparison to other breakfast places in the area, I think they are extremely reasonable!!  We will ABSOLUTELY be back for lunch and/or dinner AND definitely breakfast again!  We will see how they handle the front next time!"

I decided to go for the burger of the week, the pulled pork nacho&#39;s on a burger with no bun.
The presentation and flavor of this burger was impeccable. I would go back here any time for  dinner or lunch. As well as trying the Saturday or Sunday Brunch, I want to go back. They also have outdoor seating with patio umbrella&#39;s and it&#39;s just a cute nice place right off of route 83."

But given my recent visit here, while it&#39;s not exactly my kind of place, the food was quite good and given it&#39;s Ditka heritage, it has some very strong points going for it.

When you pull open the door, the smell of BBQ greets you.  The space is a bit sparse for my liking.  Lots of wood and brick, but there is nothing warm about it.  It reminded me of a lunchroom or a college bar, loud and functional but not particularly inviting.  But the smell . . .oh that smell got me to thinking ribs right away even though I ended up with the fish tacos.

My friend is a devout Ditka fan so when she saw the Ditka shortrib nachos on the menu, you can bet that is what we started with.  Those things could have been our entire meal and we ordered a small.  Piled high with cheese and other nacho like things, this plate was devoured by the two of us (did I say the food was quite good?)

Next up were our entrees.  I had the fish tacos (two to an order with a nice piece of fish in each) and my friend had one of their entree salads that was so big that she had enough to take home for another meal.  Everything was quite tasty.

Service was just okay but very friendly.  I suspect our server was new as he hadn&#39;t really found his cadence for the right balance of when to approach the table but that will come with time.  And I think we had a manager acting as food runner on the night we were there which worked out great as the food came up quickly and was properly prepared.

Plenty of TV&#39;s for you to catch your favorite game on and if I were to go again, I think I might order the BBQ as the table next to us had two full racks and they smelled and looked great.  

Plenty of parking and they even have a small patio area which was full on the night we were there.  All in all, a nice addition to the area."

Nice selection of local craft beers. Service was excellent--thanks to Victor for his Recs. Only disappointment was no sighting of &#34;the coach.&#34;  Guess we will have to return and try again!

Your Need To Knows: Ample bar room. Imagine it would be fun for a group of people coming to watch a game (nice TV location/diversity). Bar food was great. If there&#39;s a hot game going on I imagine it could get loud, but in slower times, noise level is manageable. There&#39;s pretty decent parking options. 

Call ahead about handicap accessibility. In the front room, all the tables seemed to be elevated. Not good for wheelchair users. There was a back room that I would assume would have more normal tables - but if this is a concern of yours, definitely ask ahead. 

Pricing is average. It&#39;s expensive, but you get decent portions, and it&#39;s pretty in line with the area. Same goes for drinks - there&#39;s a nice drink selection and some fun, clever mixed drinks but the prices won&#39;t wow you. 

The pot roast nachos are delicious. The fries were spectacular. Pulled pork was great. Brisket was also quite good. Our party found the ribs to be rather &#34;eh&#34; - they seemed dry and overdone. This may be something of the style they&#39;re prepared in, but I would look at other options.

Waitstaff were sweet and pleasant, but not prompt. It was very quiet when we were there and it took quite a bit of time to get an order in, and food also took a while. I wasn&#39;t impressed.

All in all: good burgers. Great pulled pork. The bar food/apps are diverse and interesting, and probably worth checking out. But it&#39;s decidedly average, all things considered. It&#39;s spendy for a casual place (especially a sports bar, even if you&#39;re billing yourself as some sort of grill house) and when your premiere items are only average (ribs, I&#39;m looking at you) it&#39;s not really a place I would want to visit regularly. Maybe fun for an event or a game for the atmosphere, but as a regular dinner spot: not a hit."

This is not the place for that. When this was Jimmy&#39;s Island Grill you could carry on and discourse with verbosity and clarity of aural transmission through the atmosphere to your partner across  the table. No more. To communicate here you should plan on text messaging your table mates. Or may I suggest sign language ? Semaphore? Morse Code? Smoke Signals? For myself I use mental telepathy. I just saw a couple using charades. 

Enough dwelling on the yelling. 5 stars because of the food and the service staff. The staff here moves with military precision and are attentive and even funny. Extremely knowledgeable of the food and drink menus. We have Nancy tonight and she&#39;s no better than the others. Which is to say she is outstanding and proof that in procedural uniformity excellence can be the result. 

Tonight I&#39;m having nachos, cornbread, platter sized chocolate chip cookie with ice cream and strawberry smash cocktail. 

Parking is good. They have a iPhone app for easy  take out convenience.  

You will be eating mighty fine when you get your chow at Grill 89. 

Take that to the bank."

Everything was advertised as &#34;amazing&#34; and nothing I had there for that classification. The pork nachos were really good, but not better than I have had at other places.  The fish tacos were good. I would certainly order them again, but I can get as good tacos anywhere. The Burger of the month was ordered by my boss and that was easily the best meal of all of ours. Cooked to perfection with great flavor. But again, something that I could get pretty much anywhere. The two other people I was with loved their food so maybe I&#39;m Just a tad more critical. I would probably return and recommend that you try this place for sure. I hope they add more menu items. Not an incredibly exciting menu. Needs more variety."

When we arrived our server was off to the side dancing by himself while my guests sat and waited for our drink and app order to be taken.  

The service continued to be non-existent...waited for the appetizer...waited for the server to take our dinner orders...waited for the food...waited for the desserts...waited for the bill.  I would like to say that it was very busy and they were understaffed, but we were there at 4pm and there was one other table of customers.  There were staff members just standing around in the &#34;open kitchen&#34; work area.  Not a good thing.  

The food is extraordinarily mediocre at best.  We have had the nachos at Ditka&#39;s in Oakbrook and expected them to be the same quality here.  Didn&#39;t happen.  The fish tacos were o.k. The salmon was fatty and greasy (how does that happen?)  The pork chop plate has a spinach side that was so salty and garlic-y that it tasted like it was soaked in brine. The chicken plate was typical with the same mashed potatoes that everyone else got and poultry gravy.  The filet meals were fine.

The &#34;Our Coconut Cake&#34; was such a disappointment.  Tough crust, very little custard filling and lots and lots and lots and lots of oily whipped cream.  

The location is the kiss of death.  Most of the restaurants that have come and gone there lasted on average for two-three years.  I don&#39;t even think Ditka (#89) can pull this one off.

Dropped some serious $$$ there.  The experience was embarrassing.  And yet, the guy kept on dancing...."

But after stopping in for a late lunch today, I was pretty underwhelmed. I think the menu has potential to be a really good restaurant, but poor execution makes it fall short. 

My boyfriend ordered the steakhouse burger, cooked medium. It was more rare than medium; the burger, mushrooms and onions were bland. The accompanying French fries were a bit mushy. Certainly not what you&#39;d expect from a $12 burger.

I had the fish tacos, and our friendly server offered options to the rice and beans side, so I opted for the Brussels sprouts. The tacos were unremarkable - the fish was properly cooked, but the jalapeño slaw had virtually no jalapeño taste at all. The tacos were coated with oil, which made for messy eating. I don&#39;t quite understand the point of putting oil on the outside of a taco. But the Brussels sprouts were disgusting. They were burnt - literally black on the outside - and drowning in olive oil, and no evidence of the Parmesan that was promised in the menu. To add insult to injury, we were up charged an extra $2 for bitter, burnt veg. Had I realized this before my boyfriend paid the check I would have spoken up. Don&#39;t get me wrong - I have no problem paying extra to go &#34;off the menu,&#34; but paying $15 for two small, bland tacos and burnt veggie makes me feel like a schmuck. 

Service was adequate, but we finished our beers before we finished eating and the server never came back to see if we wanted more beer or a glass of water. Like I said, the service was nothing special. Definitely not what we would expect for a $45 lunch. 

We are starting to think this restaurant space has a curse - it has opened and closed under different names and styles more times than we can count. Hopefully &#34;da coach&#34; hasn&#39;t fallen victim to a jinxed location. 

We&#39;ll stick with Ditka&#39;s in the future. The locations in the city and the burbs never disappoint."

We were a party of 10; restaurant was not crowded. One in our party came in late. She had to wait 20 minutes for her drink and a glass of water.

This building is the kiss of death to all food establishments, but let&#39;s face it if Ditka&#39;s can&#39;t make it work who can...... But still some attention to detail needed

We went recently and thankfully there was a decent wait, sign of good things.

Menu looks good, kind of in the same vein as Bakersfield who must be a bit put out.

We love places with a vibe and this place has got energy of a weekend.

Servers (after a wait longer than estimated) were great

We visit the main Ditkas often and would say that the pulled pork nachos were not as good as in the main restaurant up the street and not sure why.  The Nachos seemed different and end product was not as sloppy as the other place.

The real shock was that my teen meat eating daughter ordered a medium RARE steak.  It came out well done... Yes, Ditkas steak house produced a steak about three temperatures north of requirement.  That&#39;s a big first for us who sped every Christmas Eve at the main restaurant who never put a foot wrong in our experience.

My daughter was starving but we sent it back and after we had all finished they brought out her second steak Cooked medium WELL 

She couldn&#39;t wait any longer so she ate it.

Having said all that and yes it is a surprise for a Ditka brand, the staff handled it very well.  The waitress was suitably apologetic and the manager did the same, comped her meal and gave us a desert for free.

So, of course we will be back and we&#39;ll will enjoy watching this place shine.  Want to try the place adjoining it which is also Ditkasb


So we are here July 31 for second visit

I have to say it hasn&#39;t upped our star rating the opposite.

Beer great, service great, ingredients great, ambience lively

This time tonight I ordered pork chop, medium 

It is amazing to think we are talking about Ditkas but it was massively over cooked again  and dry to the bone as George Thorogood almost sang !  I think my granny was less cremated than my chop. 

I did not even complain this time, worst complaints are the one you don&#39;t get .

I hope it does well, I really do !"

So we walk in last night around 7:00.  It wasn&#39;t that crowded.  The hostess told us that a lot of the seating was reserved but we could have full service at the bar.
YEAH... RIGHT!
We sat at the bar, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited.....
I was amazed that all the bar staff apparently went to the same school of, &#34;Completely and Totally IGNORE all customers, at All Costs&#34;.  They wouldn&#39;t even acknowledge your presence!  It was as if you didn&#39;t even exist!!!!
UNBELIEVABLE!
WE WERE INVISIBLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We finally received a beer and a glass of wine after about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, no one EVER came back to take our food order....
THEY DIDN&#39;T CARE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And of course, there were apparently the bar regulars that came after us, and got food and drinks served to them instantaneously. 
AND... I&#39;M SURE... THEY&#39;RE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT POSTED POSITIVE REVIEWS !!!! 
We scraped up enough money for the two drinks to slam on the bar and walked out.  
The best part was when someone asked how our service was as we walked out.  &#34;You&#39;re kidding me, I said&#34;.  &#34;We could barely get served drinks, and no one will even wait on us&#34;.  &#34;We&#39;re out of here, have a nice night&#34;.

No problem for us, but the nice manager comped our dessert anyway (skillet cookie is the bomb).

More casual than Ditkas Restaurants, they have a large bar area with plenty of screens for your favorite sports. The restaurant area is casual and friendly. We started off with chili and Brussels Sprout Salad, both were flavorful. I hate Brussels Sprouts but liked the salad. My wife had the Grill burger which is  half pound cheese burger with the usual topping. It was done just like she likes. I had the Smokehouse combo. Half a rack of ribs, 4 slices of beef brisket and pulled pork. You can also add pork belly or chicken. The West Texas 18 hour Beef Brisket was slightly dried out but the dryness was more than made up with its excellent smoke taste. The ribs were excellent, tender, not dried out with an excellent rub adding to the  flavor. The pulled pork also had a good smoke taste at the ends of the strings of pork. Grill 89 smoked offerings are better than most of the BBQ and Smoke Houses in Chicago. Fries are fresh cut and are excellent, crispy on the outside and tender in the inside. We finished of our dinner with the Sugar Cookie Skillet. Cookie is chewy with topped with ice cream and thick, stiff, freshly made whipped cream.

I am not one to give 5 stars out easily. This restaurant earned it, from the food to the service. As for the service thank you Kelly for a delightful time as you serviced us.

Unfortunately, the combo made my daughter Ill and she vomited before we even left the restaurant. It was very difficult to get anyone&#39;s attention or even an apology for this. The staff are so green. It&#39;s unclear who is in charge although the place seems to be crawling with employees. Nobody there could appreciate a mistake like that could actually result in a serious health event for some people and it was basically shrugged off by everyone. I feel that if someone vomits because of a kitchen mistake that&#39;s an epic fail (we are eating in Westmont and not the Third World, after all!). I went again months later, under protest, with a friend who told me it had gotten better. This time I ate half a salad wondering what the chewy white stuff was. I ended up pulling out pieces and constructed part of a white paper cone. My waitress brought over a colleague who announced it was some packaging from the vegetables. Nobody apologized but they did offer me another salad and I wasn&#39;t charged extra for extra ingredients at least. I&#39;m not planning another visit. A prerequisite for working in a full-service restaurant should be that you have at least eaten at a full-service restaurant. I&#39;m not even sure if these people have been to a Burger King drive thru."

He walks away. 2 wines sat at the bar for 15 more minutes while  the server dissappeared. Granted the distance is about 10 feet to deliver our drinks. Finally another server strolled t o the bar and saw the drinks and receipt sitting there and brought them over laughing. Not very appealing when the wine now has sweat on our glasses from sitting there.

The line to get food was long, and our wait was even longer. From entering the restaurant to getting out food took about 40 minutes! 

Quesabroso is clearly short staffed. They had only four people working there total on a Friday during lunch hour. One at the register, two in the kitchen, and one running food. 

The food itself was just okay. The portion of rice &amp; beans was small, and I felt the whole meal was overpriced for what it was. There&#39;s definitely better Mexican joints for lunch."

One street taco  with carné asada, one with El Pastor, rice and homemade refried beans made up my taco platter. 
El Pastor has just the right marinade and spicy juiciness. 
The beef was good, but the El Pastor was better!
I ate in, so I received chips (home fried) and salsa (made here too) 
Horchata with a little is was a GREAT accompaniment. Lots of rich cinnamony flavor.

Whether it&#39;s lunch, dinner, or maybe sitting in traffic on 290 one more second will make you explode, go to Quesabroso.

The Tortilla Soup is practically a meal in itself.  It&#39;s very flavorful and topped with chunks of avocado, tortilla strips, and melty, stringy cheese.

The Street Taco (steak with cilantro and onion) was good, but honestly I&#39;d come back for more tortilla soup and the delicious, complimentary chips and salsa.  It seems most Mexican restaurants only get one right, chips OR salsa.  Quesabroso does both well.  The chips were super fresh, and I couldn&#39;t get enough of the green salsa.  I washed it all down with a horchata and headed back out into the rain.

Quesabroso is a casual restaurant, it isn&#39;t a divey tacqueria, or is it an upscale restaurant serving Latin cuisine.  It&#39;s the Goldilocks of Mexican food, it&#39;s juuuuust right!  The interior, done mostly in greens, gray and brown, and the rock en Espanol playing softly, sets the stage for a casual, comfortable, an authentic, dining experience."

My only issue is consistency. 
Sometimes I get a steak taco and its fully seasoned. Its fantastic! 
Sometimes, its like they forgot to add even salt and pepper. :(

Same with the guacamole. 
Sometimes, its mainly avocado with some onions, cilantro and tomatoes. Yay!
Sometimes its ALL onions and barely any avocado. :(

The food is good enough to be worth the gamble. So, if you go on a night where they happen not to be on their &#34;A&#34; game, give it another try before you dismiss them."

It&#39;s been about 2 years since I&#39;ve been frequenting this place with Heather H. I&#39;ve always known it was here since I used to go to the Greek Deli that used to be next door. Well, now, the Greek Deli closed and Quesabroso got that space as well so they&#39;ve expanded.

I love their chips and salsa, with about 3 orders of their salsa. I just can&#39;t get enough. Their entrees are really good too, I rarely get tacos here. To be hones, the tacos could be a little bit better. 

For entrees I&#39;ve tried their chicken with mole, enchiladas, flautas or the carne asada which is my favorite. I mean, who doesn&#39;t love a big piece of meat! 

Last time I was there it was lunch time, Angela P, her son and I, I&#39;ve only been there during dinner. We got sat and then we were able to grab baskets of chips and salsas on our own. I had to ask the lady for a bigger cup than the 2 oz. plastic containers she had out. She didn&#39;t mind and grabbed one for me. 

I ordered the pollo con mole, I remember it being very sweet but I also ordered two grilled jalapenos on the side. Well the flavor of the mole, chicken and grilled jalapenos combined is like no other! Sweet, savory and spicy. I finished the whole plate and didn&#39;t feel guilty at all. They even took the bone out of the chicken. How nice.

We got up throughout our lunch and got two more basket of chips, you know, since we had my friends son with and he really really loved them. ;)

I think I&#39;ll be going for lunch more. H? :)"

When I first started coming here I was very content with the food. I didn&#39;t mind paying a little extra for better quality food; however, my most recent visits have been consistently under portioned. Which is very disappointing considering the food is delicious. This is why I would&#39;ve initially given it 4 or 5 stars, but I don&#39;t think restaurants should compromise downsizing portions. All the while,  they&#39;re charging customers full prices( in comparison, to all the other local Mexican restaurants). The only reason I&#39;ve continued to come back, is because of the taste and quality in their food. However, I really wish they&#39;d add more meat/ steak to their tacos and Tortas. To give you a better idea, the street tacos have 2 corn tortillas with 2 ounces of steak. Then, they load it with garnishes to compensate for the small portion of meat. Which is notable, when your getting a lot more tortilla than meat in every bite. I mean at the very least, an equal ratio of meat to tortilla would be appropriate. As a consumer, if I&#39;m paying $2.75 per Taco at least serve 3-3.5 ounces of meat that&#39;s reasonable. But only 2 ounces, that&#39;s pretty ridiculous, a rip off and disappointing. I&#39;ve worked in the culinary/ hospitality industry for over a decade. I know the business and that&#39;s why I can assure you that it&#39;s 2 ounces. 
Also, I&#39;ve ordered their steak torta&#39;s a few times. Again very good in taste, but a very tiny portion of meat to bread ration. They use about 2 ounces of steak/ meat in the torta&#39;s. Which should usually have about 4 ounces of meat. This is my primary complaint and dislike about Quesabroso. I&#39;m surprised no other reviewers have had the same compliant. I&#39;ve considered calling their management to bring it to their attention. Because, the overall experience and consistency in quality and taste is there. The only element missing is the reasonable portions. 
By the way, the chips and salsa are fantastic! They&#39;re complimentary which is a plus; along with, the freshness and crispy texture! 
Hopefully, in the near future I can update my review and add another star or two. Fingers crossed."

You know the places I mean - Taco Grill and Salsa Bar, Taqueria el Pulpo, Los Burritos Tapatios, Taco Express.

 This place serves up tasty authentic Mexican fare, but steers clear of ingredients that may scare off its non-Hispanic clientele (such as lengua, tripa and cabeza). That doesn&#39;t affect me much, as I&#39;m one of the aforementioned scared eaters. Still, when I see those items on the menu, I do feel like the rest of the food might be a little more authentic. But hey, that&#39;s just my theory.

I was greeted upon sitting down with a place of still-warm from the fryer tortilla chipas and a bowl of salsa verde. The salsa was good, but mild. For an extra kick, they offer Cholula with lime table side. A carry-out order was offered a choice of salsas (hot or mild). I&#39;m not sure why I didn&#39;t get a choice. Not a big deal, though.

I ordered a-la-carte: one taco, one tostada and one sope with a variety of ingredients (pollo, steak and al pastor). The tostada and sope came with sour cream, refried beans, lettuce and tomato, while the soft corn tacos were dressed more typically Mexican, with cilantro and onion. My favorite of the bunch was the pollo tostada. The taco al pastor was also excellent, though I saw no evidence of a vertical spit. The sope was less successful -- a little doughey for my taste. Still, the steak on top was plentiful and well-flavored. Next time I&#39;ll get it on a tostada instead.

I think this is my new favorite non-regional Mexican outside of the city. The food is solid, the portions are large and the bill is small. It&#39;s a winning combination."

Yes I am currently obsessed. I&#39;m in the middle of a move and have no food at my apartment or my house. The owner already remembers me and we&#39;ll probably be on a first name basis by the end of the month. The second time my friend and I showed up, he gave us tortilla soup on the house and it was excellent! I&#39;ve never had avocado in it before and now I won&#39;t be able to go without it again.

The chips and salsa are awesome; both the red and the green. My friends and I keep finishing both containers. I would honestly get chips and salsa takeout on its own. 

I&#39;ve had the carne asada, cheese enchiladas with mole and the steak enchiladas with red salsa. All were fantastico! The mole was sweeter than others I&#39;ve had, but I loved it. 

This has definitely become my go-to Mexican joint and it should be yours, too. If you live or work near Wolf and 22nd Street, check out Quesabroso!"

Very casual, you place your order at the counter and they deliver it to your table. Very nice service and will go out of their way to make you feel comfortable.

I do like the couple that run the place (literally only a nice man and woman) and they work very hard.

You get a lot of food for the price you are paying which is great.  The chips are more gourmet than just chips you buy from the store, which are out of a bag; there light and fluffy, however, some of them are a little too greasy for my liking.  The only other negative aspect about the place would be it isn&#39;t the cleanest place in the world, the tables and chars are sticky and I almost didn&#39;t want to sit down and eat just because of that.  I&#39;m glad I did stay and ate though because it was very good, I would go back just wish it was a little cleaner.

Also, free chips and salsa!"

That couldn&#39;t have been any further from the truth.  

Decided to patronize Quesabroso from all the positive reviews as that many yelpers can&#39;t be wrong.  Inside was absolutely immaculate!  Probably the most upscale taqueria interior I&#39;ve ever seen.  Place looked as it was run by a husband-wife team which is always a good sign.  They have the kitchen visible enough to where you can see the guy cook the food and all the food near him look quite fresh.  They had aluminum foil pans of tortilla chips, which might suggest that they make their own chips.  

I got the Milanesa (breaded steak) torta and they really packed in a lot of ingredients for $5.49, especially the guacamole.  Very delicious!  Also got the al pastor burrito and again, top notch!  The hot sauces were perfect as they weren&#39;t too hot or too mild, just right.  My uncle couldn&#39;t believe how big of a steak they give you for the $9.99 carne asada dinner and that it was a ribeye and not a thin piece of flank steak.  

Excellent place!!!"

This place has pretty tasty tortilla soup which is served with fresh sliced avocado and giant strips of crunchy fried tortillas.  I sort of expected the consistency to be thicker, but realized later that if you let it sit long enough, the tortillas in the bottom will soak up soup and give it that nice chunky chili-ish consistency that I&#39;ve grown to love in tortilla soup.

The chips and salsa (free and self serve?) were quite tasty and seem to be real tortillas fried up in the back. 

The only disappointing thing was the dessert.  I was really looking forward to the tres leches cake (that was on special today) but it almost seemed like the cake part was dry... which is really surprising considering it&#39;s literally soaked with sweetened milk. I mean, I know it&#39;s usually tough to keep it from getting overly soggy, but this cake had a very dry consistency despite the milk and in my opinion needed an extra dollop of whipped cream on top.

Cake mishap aside, I&#39;ll totally try this place again... and next time order something with more substantial!"

We had steak tacos which were decent.  My son had a burrito and he said all he could taste was the steak (which was tasty), but he&#39;d like more to taste in his burrito.

quesabroso-hillside,R M.,an9Enz-poVekvLrD2TICxg,"Carol Stream, IL",0,1,0,0,29,64fcxvBB3upZmO_dJkDPJQ,4.0,2012-08-12,"I went here a few days ago as I was coming back from Oak Brook Mall and at first I was pushed away because of the curb appeal.  The restaurant sign is nice and big but they should&#39;ve used a bolder design/style.  The strip mall it is located in looks bland and old, but that&#39;s not the restaurant&#39;s fault.  In fact, that&#39;s the only tiny strip mall you will see if you stopped and looked around.  Opposite of it is a gated golf course and all around it are residential areas.  STILL, don&#39;t be put off by the bland and walk on in, you will like it!

Actually I turned around because I was turned off, but then I thought that the surroundings should not be a judge of what&#39;s inside and what they have to offer.

I walked in and the decor was actually pretty modern.  It&#39;s like night and day when you walk in, I was taken back.  There are little annoyances like being able to see into the kitchen which did not match the rest of the place, the mismatched bulbs, that cheap, plastic cactus that should be thrown into the trash, etc.  But overall it&#39;s a good design.

Once you sit down (you pick your own seat) you will be greeted by a lady who is probably the owner of the place.  She isn&#39;t actually dressed professionally but she&#39;s got an apron so I guess that counts for something.  But what really matters is that she&#39;s nice.  Not that &#34;Super attentive waiter who wants a tip&#34; nice but the &#34;I&#39;m here to serve you food like your mom or friendly aunt&#34; nice.

So she asked me if I wanted mild or hot sauce and I chose hot.  Two minutes later she gave me a menu, some nachos, and hot sauce in a professional white tea cup and saucer.  (I can&#39;t call it hot sauce because it wasn&#39;t sauce, it was more of a watery type, but still good)  So their tools are professional, but their service style is that of an average Mexican restaurant, you know, the ones that don&#39;t stand out.  But hey, as long as the service is good, then I&#39;m fine with it.  I was satisfied with the service for what it offered.  If you are looking for the &#34;tip waiter&#34; experience, then go somewhere else.  There ain&#39;t no sweet talkin&#39; here :D

BTW, the nachos were a bit too oily but the &#34;sauce&#34; was good. 

I ordered the Mixed Fajitas with flour tortillas.  There is also choice of corn.  I typically substitute the guacamole for sour cream but I wasn&#39;t asked for that option.  Maybe next time.  I got my food after a 10 minute wait, so that was good.  It was served on the sizzling pan and for the most part mirrored professional restaurant tools.  The food tasted great.  The chicken had the right amount of seasoning, the steak was cooked well done even though I didn&#39;t ask.  That&#39;s the way I like it though :D  The veggies were cooked just right as the tomatoes tasted like tomatoes, which is usually a miss at most places.  The tortillas were cooked right, but nothing spectacular. 

So overall the food was good, above average, but nothing spectacular.  For a restaurant in that location it was great.  If I go by that area I will stop in again.

BTW they serve canned or bottled drinks, no fountain machines."

I&#39;ve only had the tacos when here, the steak is grade a quality meat, the Al Pastor (marinated pork) tacos are also good, the only down fall of this place which I have to agree with the April C. the portions are huge, the tacos are super packed with meat, they sometimes almost over do it with seasoning.  

I&#39;ve worked in Mexican restaurant for 10 years, so I think I could tell which places are good and authentic and which ones are not.  This place is authentic and decent, if they were to tweak a couple of things here and there, this place would probably be the best Mexican place around this area.  

Final thought, if you want quality food for a good price and you like huge portions this is the place to go.  Have nothing bad to say about the place, it&#39;s clean and service is good, food is served nice and hot.  But can&#39;t give it a 5 star yet, hope this place makes it in the long run.  

Gotta be honest, you can tell this is probably the first place these people have owed by the popcorn machine in the corner, but I think they can make it.  If Quesabroso is reading this, get rid of the popcorn machine it sticks out like a sore thumb, and if you ever want anymore suggestion on how to make your place better send me a message."

We also had a bowl of the tortilla soup - which was great! This had great flavor and homemade crispy tortilla chips on top. The mole sauce was definitely homemade, which I probably wouldn&#39;t order again because it was very sweet, but the chimichanga was great. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. The fajitas were also great!

I typically get their Quesa Broso Carne Asada or their Bistec a la Mexicana- both are so juice and flavorful for a cut of meat that can be notoriously hard to cook with any precision. I&#39;ve also had their Pollo con Mole, which is outstanding. The mole (negro) is made per order and is just fantastic! The portion size is large and their chips are made fresh every day.

Refried beans, cheese, avocado.  The bread was freshly baked, soft and delicious.  The meat was a little on the thin side and seemed over cooked.  My husband had the tortilla soup.  It chocked full of tortilla strips, had a smoker tasting broth, had cheese, avocado and sour cream.  He said it was really good.  Service was a little on the slow side, for being the only customers in the store.  However, they seemed to have several &#39;to go&#39; orders they were working on.  We also tried their churros.  I asked for them after my dinner, but I don&#39;t think they heard me.  So I got them with my dinner.

Half of the building is the pizza place and the other half is a bar. Both are separate businesses but you could get your pizza served to you at the bar.

Als pizza sells only pizzas, which kind of makes it great that way. Ingredients in the pizza taste original and fresh. They don&#39;t carry and sides, but the bar next door sells food too.

I can honestly say this is a 4 star pizza establishment for the area but would have some tough competition it they were on the south side of Chicago. We ordered a 10&#34; sausage and a 16&#34; sausage, mushroom &amp; black olive and the smaller pizza was cooked perfect and the large pizza was a bit soggy. I am willing to bet the 16&#34; was soggy due to the mushrooms but obviously the crust cannot hold up to many toppings. I will say i kept eating the pizza because the cheese/sauce were good and the toppings were fresh. If i was to critique anything about the pizza, i would say the crust was my least favorite part since it was lacking flavor and couldn&#39;t withstand 3 toppings. I would like to see a crisper crust and maybe not as bendable at the bottom. 

If you plan to dine in make sure you ask the prices on the cans of pop as i didn&#39;t realize it was $1.50 otherwise, i wouldn&#39;t have ordered so many. Other than that, my experience was pretty good and would recommend this place if you pass by."

My sausage/mushroom was good. The cheese was a little too thick for me. Sausage &amp; mushrooms were tasty. The crust &amp; sauce were good too. I enjoyed it. But I think the pizza was more of a 3.5 to me.

1. Get a cheese, sausage, pepperoni. They do it right! 2. I&#39;m a cheese only fan for my first adventure at pizza places

Tip: call and ensure they are open. Because they are a true mom and pap place, closing hours vary
Tip: Order a 14&#34; or more. I noticed the 10&#34; to be a different, less fulfilling exprience in terms of crust 
Tip: if you dive in as soon as it hits your table, you&#39;ll burn the roof of your mouth. It comes out of the oven and right to your table in less than a minute. However, it is best HOT so pull a couple of pieces to your plate and wait roughly 60-90seconds. Separate a couple more piEces on the pizza sheet while waiting. You&#39;ll then be good to go the rest of the way. Trust me!"

Al&#39;s Pizza left, Towne Tap right.  

6;15 on a Saturday evening.. Al&#39;s was busy so we went right,  we got a table for 6 at the Towne Tap, ordered three pizza&#39;s from Al&#39;s and they brought them to our table. Lot&#39;s of folks do that.

Best thin crust pizza? I don&#39;t know.. but it&#39;s in the team picture. (love Vito and Nicks)

We ordered three 16 incher&#39;s, a sausage, a pepperoni and and Canadian bacon. Strangely, it was an all meat night *shrug*.... that works for the carnivore in me. We asked for them all &#34;well done&#34;

Did I mention? Bring Cash! They don&#39;t take no stinkin&#39; plastic (there is an ATM machine.. just in case)

So we had plenty of space and great pizza (well done in more than one sense!) It was a toss up for me between the sausage and pepperoni as my favorites, they pile on the pepperoni, but the sausage has great flavor. I ate a ton of both.. and also, to be fair; a bunch of Canadian bacon.. (No one can say that I don&#39;t lead a balanced life, can they?) We almost finished all three pizza&#39;s

Oh! and they have a great new parking lot n the back! That&#39;s a relief."

This place reminds me of the pizza place I used to go to in New York.  The staff is cool and the food is good. The vibe is very laid back, which I like.  The suburbs have enough pretentious restaurants trying to impress basic people in to paying too much for crummy food.... this place is the real deal and that makes me very happy.  
Crispy crusts with enough substance to not feel like cheese and crackers. Generous toppings and good cheese.

I get it now.

Much like I judge a Thai spot by its ability to nail Tom Yum, jalapeno (I prefer hot banana peppers but that doesn&#39;t seem to be a thing in the Midwest) and pepperoni are my barometer for pizza.  Get that simple yet difficult combo right and the sky&#39;s the limit.  Al&#39;s not only got it right, they killed it.  Juggling knives, on fire while walking a balance beam kind of killed it.  With one visit, we have a new pizza place. (FULL DISCLOSURE: We carried out but our cash out service was pleasant and obviously the food was incredible.  Bring cash because you&#39;re going home hungry if you don&#39;t, jerk.)

It is nice that they have the traditional sausage and pepperoni, however there are some people who cannot have that.  I don&#39;t want to have to pay the cost of toppings to get a veggie pizza.  Can you put something like ground beef or regular beef as a topping?  

This is the kind of pizza that my mother made.  The crust is traditional, plain.  That is because the sauce is the thing which should shine, along with the fresh toppings.  That crust is just a vehicle to get to your mouth, so don&#39;t fancy it up.  If I wanted a grilled cheese on my pizza, I know were to go.  Besides that is not pizza anyways.  

There is one thing that I am not a fan of is the Cash Only.  Many times I am running around on Saturday and want to stop by to pick up a pizza for dinner.  If I don&#39;t make a stop at the bank&#39;s ATM, I forget.  Then I end up at the grilled cheese pizza place or playing dominos.  If they would just give us working mothers a break and put a credit card sales in there, our day would be awesome.  Besides it makes me wonder when a business is all cash.  Their pizza&#39;s are not that cheap so the extra 3.2% for a credit card sale bank charge.  Why not?"

He&#39;s definitely pickier, didn&#39;t seem to like most of the options, and downright hated the one I liked the most.  Well, thanks to Al&#39;s, we&#39;re finally on the same page in the pizza department.  Definitely one of the best thin crust pizzas around. When my parents come to visit, they&#39;re always asking if we can order a pizza from there.  

They are a cash or local check only establishment and they do not deliver.  Depending on who answers, the person on the phone can be pretty abrupt, sometimes sounds downright annoyed. I don&#39;t mind, it&#39;s nothing but friendliness when I walk in. You can call to pick it up or call to have it ready for you to eat in their building.  I find that when I show up at the time they say the pizza will be ready, it&#39;s usually not ready. Sometimes I even get these perplexed looks like I&#39;m showing up right after I hang up the phone.  I usually tack another 10 minutes on to the time estimate, and unless there&#39;s some sort of issue going on, it&#39;s good to go.

There are not a lot of meat options for people who can&#39;t eat pork. I have a friend who gets really sick when she eats pork, and their menu doesn&#39;t have options I&#39;ve seen her get at some other places (chicken, ground beef - which I&#39;ve personally never had on a pizza, etc).  One time she was over and they did put chicken on the pizza for her though, which she really appreciated.  Of course, a pizza doesn&#39;t have to have meat anyway... or so I&#39;ve heard."

You would be well advised to call in your order - wait times on Saturday were pushing an hour, and even though the place may not seem full, they&#39;re doing a brisk carry out business which extends those wait times. The pizza itself comes out nicely well done, which I like, and with tons of toppings and nice crispy crust. I would liken this to my personal favorite for pizza, Amato&#39;s, maybe slightly crispier crust, and slightly less cheese. I probably like Amato&#39;s a little better, but it&#39;s awfully close, honestly. They kind of have table service, in that they bring the pizza out to you, but you order at the counter and otherwise are kind of on your own. Which is fine, it&#39;s just a no-frills kind of place. And prices are pretty reasonable too, for what you get. I&#39;d definitely come back, but like I said, I&#39;ll definitely call in my order ahead of time.

I think one of the reason the pizza is so good here is the freshness of the ingredients, and their skill at getting the sauce all the way to the edge, and then folding a little crust over it- never a dry bite.

I saw the amazing reviews and was intrigued. It didn&#39;t event bother me that the place is cash only and mildly resembles a shanty. I wanted good pizza, and I wanted it now. So we ordered a large cheese and sausage and headed over to pick it up. The pizza smelled amazing and the whole ride home was a struggle not to tear into the box.

When we opened up the pizza, I was impressed. Sure, it&#39;s cut into squares (WHYYYY) and maybe not as cheesy as I&#39;d like, but it looked good. When we sampled it, I was even more impressed! The sausage is high quality and plentiful, and the crust had a nice crispness. The sauce is extraordinarily robustly flavored and sort of drowns out the cheese and toppings, but it, too, tasted fresh. Husband devoured his share, and we had definitely some left over.

Is it the best pizza I&#39;ve ever had? Nah. Is it probably the best pizza I&#39;ve had to date in this area? Sure is. And until I can find a place that makes enormous, cheesy, triangular, foldable slices of delicious, perfect, pizza, I&#39;m going to return to Al&#39;s for more."

I grew up in the Chicagoland area and feel personally obligated to spread the gospel of the better, lesser known style of Chicago pizza-  tavern style thin crust, square cut. Listen up New Yorkers and other haters! Al&#39;s serves up one of the best in class. For me, this pie is up there with the greats- Vito &amp; Nick&#39;s and Well&#39;s Brothers in Racine. The thin, flavorful crust has a crunch from edge to center, always a golden brown on the bottom. The tasty toppings are judiciously applied.

Seating area is small but it seems that a lot of people order and then bring it to the bar (they will even come over and call you to say it&#39;s ready). I did like in Al&#39;s seating space that there&#39;s a sign saying that children must be seated and supervised by a parent. The space is not big enough to bear hyper, ill-restrained kids.

1.  The thin crust pizza is very good.  Did you grow up on Totino&#39;s?  It&#39;s like a gourmet crust version of Totino&#39;s!  Crispy thin, but better flavor!

2.  The toppings are fresh and delicious.  From the tasty and generous cheese, to the mushrooms, to the rolled sausage... it was all given in generous portions and tasted great!

3.  The staff were amazingly friendly, even in the midst of a rush of pizza orders.  After reading a few Yelp reviews about bad service, we prepared for a &#34;pizza nazi&#34; kind of moment... but they joked around with us, talked about how long they&#39;ve been open, and were just good down to earth neighborly folks.

The dudes working here were pretty cool, and really care about their establishment.  They only accept cash, so you&#39;ll have to use an atm machine in the bar it&#39;s connected to if you only brought plastic.

Now on to the pizza.  The biggest stand out from the ingredients was the sauce.  The acidity level was perfect for this type of pizza and is really what separated it from others.  The taste and texture of this pizza resembles a good homemade pie, but other than that I expected a bit more considering the other high ratings and somewhat pricy pizzas for the size.  A few have claimed it&#39;s the best pizza in Chicago, I&#39;d have to disagree with that bold statement.  I thought the toppings were pretty average, although the green olives were a good choice and the rolled sausage wasn&#39;t bad.

We were taking it all in when a guy walks in with his young daughter.  We told them to go ahead of us.  Leo called the little girl by name and she gave him a high five.  Leo said &#34;You guys want the 12&#34; cheese?&#34;  The guy said that they did indeed.

Another guy comes in to pick up an order and sure enough Leo called him by name.  The guy picked up his order and we were ready to place our order. We got the Al special 12&#34; for the two of us.  The pop and bottled water are self serve and on the honor system.  You keep track of what you drink and pay when you leave.  

The pizza was piping hot when it arrived to us by Leo.  He advised us to be careful that it was very hot.  The toppings were fresh and plentiful.  When we left we were given a coupon for a free 12&#34; cheese pizza with the purchase of a 14&#34;.  We were leaving town the next day so we passed it along to the hotel staff.

Order your pizza at the bar at the front.  They don&#39;t have a million toppings but they have the things you need - pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and onion.  That is really all you need.  Go sit down and then wait.  If you&#39;re smart, you can call ahead so you can skip the waiting part.  

Anyway, the crust on this pizza is thin but not too thin and just right crispy.  An excellent amount of cheese and the right amount of toppings.  The sauce is tomato-y without being too acidic or too sweet - it&#39;s probably my favorite pizza sauce pretty much anywhere.

It&#39;s not a high service place - you grab your own drink and then the server will just bring your pizza out and if you need something else, you go back to the bar for it.  But it works well.  It&#39;s cash only so keep that in mind.  It&#39;s also pretty small and the hours can be kind of odd but it is well, well worth it."

I would compare this place to Rosati&#39;s.  Similar in concept and look to their thin crust.  But better in every way.  I love me some Rosati&#39;s, but Al&#39;s is the winner!  I typically eat 5-6 of their small cut pieces on my way home with take-out.  It&#39;s too good to wait.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out.

As far as best in the area, it depends on what you consider the area to be.  Ach n Lous in Aurora has the same taste with a more crisp crust.

We&#39;ve dined here several times, and each time it&#39;s better than I remember it being the last time.  I highly recommend the sausage topping.  The location is a bit odd and kind of makes you forget that you&#39;re actually in Chicagoland, but that only adds to the charm of this place.  I almost prefer getting takeout because I kind of have a tendency to burn my mouth when dining in because I can&#39;t resist taking a bite as soon as the pizza comes out of the oven.  Don&#39;t forget to bring cash!"

There is nothing like down home great pizza.   The &#34;rural&#39; feel is a great escape from chain-restaurants.   If you could close your eyes and open them up at Al&#39;s...you&#39;d swear you&#39;re somewhere else.   Mom and the boys - treat you well - with respect and make you feel at home.   The get your own place settings and pick from the fridge beverages are old school - this even includes the cash only policy!  I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.

The pizza is consistently amazing and is the best thin crust pizza around, period  We fancy ourselves as thin crust pizza connoisseurs and have found that if you ask for them to cook it well done, it gives it that extra bit of crispiness without burning it.

They always get it right, and pie cut on request which I love.  Sausage and mushroom pizza with extra sauce is a must!  Plus, the bar next door sells beer so you can grab a beer while you wait (if you don&#39;t pick up), grab a six pack to go, and take your pizza and have a fantastic night!

They accept cash or checks so don&#39;t forget your checkbook. The staff was really friendly in this humble mom and pop restaurant. I remember that this place was there 25 years ago, so they have some history to them. But I hope they don&#39;t change a thing. In this day and age of nationwide bland pizza places and California Pizza&#39;s overpriced, undersized fare, it is so refreshing to find a place like Al&#39;s.

I like their wings... it&#39;s a nicer atmosphere, and pretty much a sports bar, but on the nicer end.  I&#39;ve tried both kinds of wings, and I believe they have a wing special on Sundays, at least they used to.

A few friends from the gym and I planned on getting together so I called the week of our outing asking if we could reserve a table for 10 people.  I spoke with the manager and she said it was fine.  Our table for 10 was on a Friday night at 7:30.  The place was somewhat crowded, no wait to get seated though for the others.  Our table was all ready for us when I walked in.  Samantha was our server, she provided great service and gave us all separate checks with no problem.  I scored 10% checking in on yelp here so that always makes me happy as it&#39;s a nice surprise when I haven&#39;t checked in on yelp previously.

We stayed a few hours, the place kinda cleared out the later it got, which was odd being a Friday night in Naperville, but this place isn&#39;t downtown and in a strip mall.  This place also brings an older crowd rather than young and rowdy so we really appreciated that for our group too.

My Yelp family didn&#39;t recommend Bottoms Up, so I was fearful to visit. Though, it was a close restaurant and suggestion from a friend, so tried it we did.

I loved the set-up. Lots and lots of TV&#39;s, decent-sized patio, long bar. 

For appetizers we started with the nacho&#39;s and onion rings. The nacho&#39;s tasted like you&#39;d get them from a ballpark. Baseball vendor cheese, canned toppings, etc etc. Though, the quantity was huge for the price. The onion ring&#39;s were fantastic, but the sauce on the side was quite odd.

Trying to play it safe, I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. It was just fine, though hard to mess up. The french fries were awesome! Hubby thought the burger was just ok. Trying to get a box for leftovers was quite the ordeal; we asked 3 different servers and waited 10 minutes for the box.

I have to agree with a previous reviewer though (Tom C.). They totally charge for extra sauce! We requested ranch with our onion rings and didn&#39;t get it, and I also requested a side for my wrap. At the end, we were charged for 3 ranch sides, when we only used one! Based on the incredibly slow service, it wasn&#39;t worth the complaint, but what an odd thing to overcharge!

Drinks were priced fairly well. If you check in on Yelp you&#39;ll get 10% off your bill, but reader beware: it&#39;s on a VERY limited amount of items. I always check the fine print - there was none - but the 10% off was only for the food. Quite sketchy if you ask me.

All in all, this seems like a lovely place for a drink on the patio. Skip the food though!"

The drinks are just your usual suspects, but they have deals for every night of the week. Most recently I was there on a Wednesday and they had $3 coronas...not bad if you ask me!

My family raves about the dry rub wings at Bottoms Up and I have to agree...they are de-lish! Other than that I&#39;ve only tried their chips and salsa, but the salsa has a nice bite to it which is always welcome :)

So, when we went it was pretty empty, so we were seated immediately. We really enjoyed the decor. It is perfect for a sports bar and there are plenty of TVs. Our server was very efficient and knowledgable about the menu. We ended up ordering wings for my husband and I and grilled cheeses for our boys. Our food was served pretty fast. 

We really liked the wings. They were seasoned and cooked really well, I would say they are in the upper echelon of sports bar wings. The wings came with fries, which were decent. Our boys loved the grilled cheeses, but it&#39;s hard to mess up a grilled cheese : )

The ladies are nice and attentive, the atmosphere is great with numerous TVs. But the food and the bar. Sigh. Appetizers are below average. Queso dip tasted like a can of Hormel and melted Velveeta . Other nacho items are to stay away from as well. For a 8$ price tag Id rather make my Velveeta at home.  I could not finish my on the rocks margarita, they only serve lime as I was told by my server and it tasted like pure tequila. I had told the server it was too strong and she must of added a very watered down margarita mix. 3/4 still full on the table when we left for a hefty  $7 price tag, in a high ball glass no less. Beers were 7.25

However, it is nice for those that are looking to stay AWAY from the foot traffic of DTN and have a quieter sports bar to check out. 

Our waiter recommended the Chicken Philly Cheese which was delicious. It comes with a different kind of sauce, rather than the au jus that the Philly cheese steak comes with. 

Sweet potato fries: YES.

We came here around 10 on a Saturday night and they still served us dinner! It wasn&#39;t crowded to the point that the experience was unpleasant - everything was just right. I will be back next time I&#39;m in Naperville!"

It was slow but I believe our total bill was $115 before tip. The atmosphere was clean and plenty of TVs to go around. Chicken Philly and sweet tots were actually really good and I would recommend both to anyone going for the first time.

They took care of our birthday guest with two pieces of cake to share around. Very nice of them even. Only knock was drink specials. $2.50 for domestics is decent but no specials on tap or specialty drinks besides shots. 

Will go here again when in the area and I know if this place was downtown Nville it would be packed."

Try the wings they are really good. Only problem is, no matter how many wings you order 6, 12,18 or 24 you get 1 cup of sauce. If you want more because you ordered more than just 6 wings (which I would recommend because they are really good) you have to pay another 50 cents!!  Stupid!!!  I would definitely suggest eating here but if you order the wings, order them in increments if 6 so you get enough sauce, Stupid!!!  I just decided to not order another drink which they would have made more on than a little cup of dressing/sauce!!  Stupid!!!

I would recommend the restaurant, they get most things right. If you do visit, just tell the owner he is insulting his patrons with trying to cut corners on the wing sauce!"

While the service could have been better, it is something that can easily be improved in the future. My biggest knock was lack of a main viewing screen. This would have been nice to enjoy the Packers-Giants game to go along with my beer and wings.

The bar has a good selection but the wings are the saving grace. The dry rub hot wings were delicious and salvaged my experience. All in all it is an ok bar that gets the job done, but until it gets some of the service issues, best to just order the wings for takeout."

Showed up this past Saturday at 530 PM for the final game of the playoffs for the Blackhawks.  730 start time for the game.  I showed up as we were having a big party (10+ people) to watch and cheer on the hawks, so I wanted to ensure that we had a table big enough to handle our group.  I arrived and the young ladies at the front were more than accommodating and helped assemble the tables to host my group.  While waiting for my group, I had a few drinks and something to eat.  At about 700 PM, I was still waiting for everyone to arrive.  The place was getting crowded and more and more patrons showed up to watch the game.  The owner comes over and asks if the rest of my group was showing up.  I explained yes, they would be there any minute.  Then proceeds to tell me that if they didn&#39;t show up soon, he would have to take the tables and give them to other people.  I was very taken back by this statement.  First, I find it a bit offensive that people show up to a place for a big game for the Hawks a half an hour before a huge game and expect to be seated.  This is a bar, not a restaurant, maybe plan ahead as I did?  Second, after this was stated to me (as he never identified himself as the owner) I asked out extremely slow and disorganized server who he was.  She stated he was the owner.  I then asked is it his nature to turn business away, since I am about to leave since he was so rude and threatened to take the tables I reserved by showing up two hours before the game?  She of course didn&#39;t have a response and never saw him again, because I would have like to explained to him what had transpired and worked under better terms.  Turns out that we had 20 people there eating and drinking, double the original group. If you want to go somewhere with extremely disorganized and lack of detailed servers and an owner who hassles the patrons and hides in the back, this is your place.  Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you!"

Maybe the reviews are older and the place has improved.  I went there last week with a group of 12 (6 adults, 6 young teenagers). We went to watch the UFC fights and the staff quickly combined tables so our group could sit together.

Our waitress was pleasant and responded to all of our needs. The food was delivered quickly.  I had a hamburger and although I don&#39;t like when burgers are well-done, they were still able to keep the burger juicy.  The waitress said they do not use frozen patties and use fresh beef (always a plus).  The people around me stated they enjoyed their food as I noticed one person had a wrap.

I will say that the waitress was sometimes forgetful about bringing out certain things like mustard, Equal for unsweetened tea; but rather than get bent out of shape about it, I reminded her and it was brought out.

I went there again last night and sat at the bar to watch the college football games.  The bartenders werre responsive and freindly.

I need to go back on a Sunday to try the wings.  I&#39;m a big fan of the wings at Crosstown Pub in Naperville so I want to see how these stack up."

The atmosphere is good and they usually have seats, which is great. There&#39;s always the appropriate game on and the staff is attentive.

The only negatives I have are that some of the TV resolutions are messed up that the games can look a little funny (first world problem, I know.)

And I got $3.00 domestic drafts as well... It is a little loud, not bad.  Certainly not as bad as other people would lead you to believe.

The decor is a little odd for a sports bar.  It feels like the owners were going for a upscale-lounge type of feel, then at the last moment a sports-crazed uncle bought in and demanded they spring for like 25 plasma screens.

The lack of a central viewing screen isn&#39;t ideal, for a sports bar.  You need a projector or some gigantic screen for premier games to be shown to pull off the proper sports venue.

Try the spicy garlic wings.  They were the most similar to traditional Buffalo-style flavor, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for."

Today, a Sunday, we got in and out less than 30 minutes. We  ordered 18 boneless wings of mixed variety plus drinks. As advertised, this is a sports bar, so there are people talking and TVs playing loudly. 

I don&#39;t write yelp reviews too often but have used yelp reviews all over the country while traveling for work. The one-star rating this place currently has is misleading; there are much worse places to go in the area. 

The weekly specials are great and one of the main reasons we go there. Sunday is $.50 wings, $4.50 Bloody Mary&#39;s and a beer special I can&#39;t remember. The staff has been willing to change up TV channels for different games and races and there was an enthusiastic crowd for the most recent Bears game. Every booth has a TV over it so you never have a bad view of the game.

Both boneless and bone-in wings are great. Though they don&#39;t have many flavors, the BBQ and spicy garlic are excellent in both styles. The outside of the boneless are crispy while the inside is fluffy and delicious. I would take these over BWW any day, and if they had more flavors they could better rival Cross Town; the taste of BU&#39;s wings already do. 

It would be nice if the crowd were larger and more youthful on Saturday nights, but on game day it&#39;s a great spot to post up, have a beer and eat wings."

They are very anti- family and have now put a sign on their Golden Tee game that it is for adults only.  Really??

Went to watch Thursday night football. The TV at the bar showing the football game did not work the entire second half.  To top it off, they had the MLB network on although no baseball games on and would not switch to football. They also had the USC game on 2 sets.   

The &#34;manager&#34; said same thing happened last week and had something to do with the karokee machine they were setting up....  well, at least they understand the problem.

I suggested changing one of the TV&#39;s to the game and she said it was bascially over anyway.  I commented that this is suppose to be a sportsbar.   I also told her I wanted nothing (no free beers, no comps, nothing) but to improve the experience for future visits and she just walked away.  

I really did want to like this place,  I had been here weekly for the past few months and really like their wings.  But every visit, it something else.  No chairs at the table one week (and they would not let us get the on our own), the lights in front on the TV in the bar area (which everyone complains about), slow service (not horrible, but slow) and of course, most importantly, a manager that does not realize that the restaurant is a sports-oriented restaurant.

Bottom line for Bottoms Up, this is no Crosstown Pub, which is better in almost every facet (except parking).  I wish is was, but it is not....."

This visit was a Saturday afternoon, around 4:00pm, so the crowd was light, and the noise level was low.  Tracy, our server, was very prompt and attentive. NO service issues today!
My burger with bacon and hot peppers was excellent. Their seasoned fries are thin and hot.  Wife&#39;s chicken ceasar wrap was good, as well.

17 televisions!
All new remodel in 2011.

The Con&#39;s:

Yes, we have been here before when the noise was very overbearing, but it was during Notre Dame v Michigan and we EXPECTED it loud!  The place does have a lot of hard surfaces, but I cannot see them changing it much.

If you are on the older end of the scale, eat early and get home, as the place does become a younger-crowd sports bar after about 10pm, and the DJ starts the music.

We will continue to go there, and the haters can stay away."

1.  Surrounded by neighborhoods but not family friendly.  Kids are not allowed to play the games as it upsets the &#34;regulars.&#34; I have gone there enough to be a regular.

2.  Service is consistently slow and awful.  You will wait forever to get more drinks, get your food, etc.  just not sure what the waitresses are doing.  We waited over an hour to get burgers.  If something is wrong they will charge you for the replacement.  Poor management.

Also ordered a combo plate of mushrooms, onion rings, loaded potato skins and mini-tacos. The plate came with a variety of sauces and had more than enough for two people to share.

We both had the Country Fried Steak and Eggs. &#34;Very good&#34; It&#39;s the best I have had in the suburbs. Everything was fresh and we were served pretty fast being that the restaurant was very busy. Price was fair compared to other breakfast restaurant in the area that are much higher. I would have given 5 stars but I didn&#39;t like that you have to pay at the front entrance. When its very busy the line to leave will back up. I hope they chance this process. Overall I will go back. 

Ask for Diana Q she was amazing and so friendly. :)"

To be fair, many kids were off school today, and perhaps they were not expecting this, but it took the waitress over 20 minutes to take our order, then 30 more minutes to get our food.  When our food finally came, only three of the four meals were prepared.  My daughter&#39;s breakfast was clearly never submitted to the kitchen because it took another 10 minutes to get hers.  It would have been nice if the manager had come to apologize or offer a discount, but that never happened.  We will not be back.

On a regular day, should you come here, it looks as if they have many egg dishes, but the pancake and waffle selections are pretty limited."

The service was very slow. From initially waiting to be seated, when there was no one else even there, to waiting over 20 minutes for our order to be taken. It was not a speedy breakfast.  we actually had to go find our waitress to ask how long it would be for our breakfast to come because the service was so poor.

our order was not served correctly, the eggs were inedibly undercooked the pancakes tasted like cardboard, and the bacon appeared to have been microwaved.  portions of our orders were not served at all, and had to be brought out in a to go box as we left.

there are many breakfast choices in Plainfield, skip this one."

My husband and I both ordered omelettes. It was pretty clear they used a boxed liquid egg. They were so thin, flat, rubbery, and tasteless. 

My omelette had mushroom, onion, and green peppers in it. They were diced into tiny little pieces and there was nothing to hold them into the eggs. It was a tasteless explosion all over my dish. I&#39;m not joking when I say it was like they made an egg pancake (only hard and thin), cooked it on both sides, then added the veggies once it was done, and sandwiched it all together. They topped it with completely bland &#34;salsa&#34; - which was actually pico de gallo, and added sour cream. It was the only flavorful part of the dish.

Our kids ordered pancakes, and my oldest son asked if we could go back to our normal breakfast place because his pancakes were thin and hard, and didn&#39;t have much flavor. I was expecting so much more from a nice looking, newly opened breakfast joint. I was so, so disappointed.

I would have given it one star, but the fruit that came with my order was large, delicious, and it seemed pretty fresh. That was the only good thing about this place."

Apparently it&#39;s a chain from California and a lot of the food has a Mexican aspect. Pricing was comparable to other restaurants and service was decent. I like that you can order a half or full carafe of juice instead of only by the glass. I had a meal that was toast, eggs, bacon and hashbrowns. The toast and bacon were ok and the hashbrowns were really good. I didn&#39;t care for the eggs. I got them scrambled and they just tasted a little off. They also have a reward card you can sign up for. My friend had a credit loaded on for her birthday month so that was nice!"

The first time I came I had the  Golden State Benedict,  a toasted English muffin with sliced grilled tomato, avocado, Applewood-smoked bacon which I swapped for Canadian bacon and two poached eggs topped with Hollandaise sauce and Sriracha. 
The  second time I had the  Border Benedict with poblano sauce and carne asada over corn cakes. Both were very good but the Border Benedict was delicious!!! There was plenty of steak, the salsa was flavorful and the combination of the sweet corn cakes was perfect. I had home fries both times and those great also. 
My son had the good morning burger, beef patties with 2 over easy eggs, bacon, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. It was a huge monster and he devoured the entire thing and said it was great! My girls had pancakes from the kids menu. 
Overall this is a great breakfast place, there are so many things on their menu that I want to try. The service is ok and the restaurant is bright and airy. 
This is a must try if you live in the area."

Going in on the first day can be kind of a crap shoot, but The Broken Yolk Cafe had their act together for us! We were greeted quickly, and shown to a booth right away. 

Broken Yolk moved into a former Bob Evans, and there is no trace of country left in this place. They renovated the space into a clean, modern, but still warm and friendly restaurant. And they were playing solid 70s rock. Thumbs up all around for the ambiance. 

Their menu has a lot of good options, especially if you&#39;re a fan of Mexican-inspired breakfasts.They have an entire section dedicated to South of the Border offerings, and some of those flavors seep into other areas of the menu as well. My kid ordered their breakfast tacos, which come with rice and black beans. I opted for the chicken and waffles. 

The food came out quickly, but not so quick that you wonder if they have all of the components for every meal sitting under a heating lamp in the back. The portions were generous, but not obscene. 

And what about that food? My chicken and waffles were as good or better than any I&#39;ve had anywhere. And I (shamefully?) order chicken and waffles whenever it&#39;s presented to me as an option.

I have to admit, I was skeptical of breakfast tacos. I&#39;ve had breakfast burritos and breakfast quesadillas before, but never breakfast tacos. The kid offered me a bite, and I went for it. WOW. The flavors of the tacos were fresh and bright; it&#39;s like this is how eggs were always supposed to be served. Everything just came together perfectly in a magical bite. think the Mexican breakfast options are where this place may shine the brightest (and remember what I just said up there about the chicken and waffles). 

Oh, and on top of all of that? Their coffee&#39;s really good. And they have an espresso bar that I didn&#39;t try, but the signage they have on the tables makes it look very appealing. Also looking awesome, but untried is lunch. They have myriad sandwiches, wraps and burgers that look like they would be outstanding for a noontime repast. OH, and they also offer boozy drinks for grown ups who need some liquid relaxation with their first meals.

I&#39;ll for sure be back for some Mexicanesque breakfast the next day I can. And I&#39;ll have a 13-year-old who is willing to wake up at 6:30 to join me. That should tell you all you need to know about the wonder of Broken Yolk."

I ordered an omelette and my wife order the ham scramble.  The ham looked and taste like shaved deli ham.  Even though was expecting ham of the bone, it still tasted good.  Food overall was pretty decent.  The service was pretty good.

Where they get knocked down is the food handling.   I ordered a biscuit with my breakfast.  I was sitting in a both facing the line.  When my food came up, one lady grab the ticket and my plate and asked for the biscuit.   I watched as the passed the biscuit down the line by 4 different waitresses, all handling the biscuit with their bare hands.   Based on this and the better options in the area, I will probably not be back."

I have read a couple of other reviews and the ones that took time to write the review in some detail are spot on. The decor is contemporary and updated. Nicely lit for a cozy atmosphere. Music was playing and where one review said 70&#39;s Rock was playing, I enjoyed 80&#39;s classics like David Bowe, Duran Duran, and First Order (spoiler on my age). 

I was greeted right away and seated in my choice of table or booth. There are TV&#39;s in your line of site. My waitress was attentive and prompt. I usually order a pancake combo but I assume they know how to make that. I ordered the Stuffed French Toast as I was intrigued about the taste. I wasn&#39;t disappointed. I enjoyed the splash of caramel and bananas were fresh. I also order eggs and bacon (an additional $2 for making it a combo). The eggs were as expected, the bacon seemed a tad over cooked.  

Another review I read mentioned the Mexican inspired dishes so out of curiosity I checked to see who was cooking and it appeared to be a few Mexican men. That should bode well when ordering the Mexican style breakfast or lunch. 

On exit, the cashier was AWOL and the hostess was busy sitting new customers so I waited several minutes to pay. One customer noticed I was standing there longer than usual and told the Hostess to take my money before they were to be seated. So for that reason I couldn&#39;t give 5 stars. If the cashier had to leave the station for a length of time they should made sure someone was there to step in."

The decor was nice and modern.  There is alot of seating.  The tables seemed small to me or maybe the menus were big or maybe too much stuff on the table but  it was very awkward for my husband and i to look at our menus sitting across from eachother.  The waitress was pleasant and attentive.  There drink cups are huge.  The food was nothing special especially for the price.  I had a turkey wrap and it was just not impressive.  The veggies didnt seem super fresh or flavorful all i really tasted was the mayonnaise.  The sweet potatoe fries were pretty good.  My husband got the tomatoe soup which was good but did have a kick and the chicken fried steak.  The chicken fried steak tasted kinda soggy and like something out of the freezer not freshly prepared.  The gravy in it was good.  It tasted alot like Bob Evans gravy.  The scrambled eggs were eggs nothing stood out about them.  The fruit was a nice size and pretty good.  The home fried potatoes looked to be freshly cut and good.  The blueberry muffins were probably the best thing there.  They were very good.  There was a couple things on the menu I think I will come back and try and hopefully update my review with more stars.  I would say 2 1/2 stars if it was an option.

I think the omelets are pre made then whatever ingredients you choose are tossed on then folded over. Consistency of rubber.
How do you mess up coffee? Bitter and way too strong. 
French toast was barely battered...so basically it was sautéed bread.

From the minute we walked in the door and the staff were smiling and happy to the moment we left we were very pleased. 

I usually get omelets so I figured let&#39;s see how they do. Green peppers were diced, onions were as well. The bacon was crispy and not burnt at all. Hash browns and English muffin were just right too. Also the orange juice was ice cold and very refreshing. 

My wife had the winning dish however and I will be ordering it next time as well.  The Tiki Toast, three pie slice sized pieces of Hawaiian bread drizzled in caramel sauce and powdered sugar with strawberries and blueberries.  

As I said, everyone there was friendly and the service was excellent. For being open only three weeks they have certainly started off on the right foot.

It is clean and staff is efficient, and our food took about 15 - 20 min from order to table on a busy Sunday morning (3 adults).

They have a wonderful variety including huge fluffy omlettes (I recommend the Mom), standard eggs &amp; bacon, Nutella crepes, french toast, biscuits. Many dishes have a mexican flair, with just the right amount of kick.

Side choices including mexican rice or refried beans, hash browns, homefries or fresh fruit.

I had an absolute Horrific Experience! 

My pancakes were overcooked, cooked so tough, that I needed a Steak knife in order to cut them. 

Had to send those back! So while waiting for those to come back out redone, my entire plate of hash browns along with my bacon became all cold! Then had to request those two be reheated again!

They yolked around with me a bit as I was being seated telling me I was sitting in the VIP booth, but it was just that funky little booth right in front of the seating area. 

They are very customer friendly here and really want you to enjoy your dining experiences. At my last visit the wait was getting a bit long so they came out with muffins and water for all of us who were waiting. They also started performing a few acts for Cirque du Yolkie which was nice. They kept trying to involve me in the show but I had to tell them no because I cannot take part in any other showcases because I&#39;m a Blue Man from the act downtown called Blue Man Troupe.

Ok, I ordered an omelet. Cheese omelette. It was the flattest omelette I&#39;ve ever seen. Onions must have been cooked on the grill prior to making the omelette, because all I tasted was onions. 
The cheese wasn&#39;t hot either, like it was at some point, but not anymore. Now it was luke warm and congealed. 
The English muffin was good.  And my mom LOVED her Cobb salad!
My husband had the chicken fried steak, he said it was decent. Unfortunately he didn&#39;t stop burping up the hash browns until eight hours later! 
Now, I rarely say anything about the &#34;ambiance &#34;. Of restaurants, I mean who really gives a crap as long as the food is good!
They play all 80&#39;s music. Not a mix of 80&#39;s music. The kind of 80&#39;s music I listened to at parties.  Like Van Hagar and Guns N Roses. Now, I didn&#39;t see a lot of 80&#39;s lounge lizards here. You know who was here?? OLD people. Hell, I was with my 82 year old mom.   Ever try to have a nice quiet breakfast with your little 82 year old mom while listening to Sweet Child O&#39; Mine??? IT SUCKS!! I&#39;m certain her hearing aids were dead, because she never once complained about the music, and trust me, this is the woman that complains about any music that isn&#39;t from the big band era. And the music is pretty loud. 
Look, I grew up in the 80&#39;s, i get it, but seriously if I had  to endure one more freaking hair ballad while I ate my flat omelette I was going to shove the fork in my ears and deafen myself!!
I just can&#39;t imagine the other blue hairs were digging the music either.

I must say I was impressed mainly because of the service.  Being brand new you might expect the staff to be a bit disorganized but that wasn&#39;t the case at all.  Great service and took no time at all to get,a really fresh breakfast.  The Nutella Crepes and Eggs Benedict were both great.  Perfectly cooked.  The only negative was perhaps the presentation and serving of their biscuits and gravy.  They put bacon on the biscuits under the gravy which made the bacon mushy and undesireable.  I will not let that stop me from returning because everything else was great, and good value for the money as well."

The Tiki French Toast (Hawaiian bread dipped in egg batter, griddled to a golden brown color, topped with strawberries, blueberries, caramel drizzle and shredded coconut) was crazy good and likely to be a fan favorite of Broken Yolk Cafe diners. 

As a world renowned connoisseur of Corned Beef Hash, the CBH I had today was the best I have ever eaten. Perfectly cooked, everything was crispy and not the standard soft &amp; mushy version you get at most places.   The CBH was done correctly. Get it. 

The Broken Yolk Cafe in Plainfield has elevated the breakfast and lunch experience of us foodies in Plainfield and South Naperville. The staff is great. The food is excellent. The prices are more than excellent for the quality and quantity of food you received.

I didn&#39;t completely adhere to this ritual trial however, I ordered the &#34;border benedict&#34; which features carne asada instead of Canadian bacon, a cornbread muffin(?) Instead of an English muffin and a poblano sauce (more on this later). 

The eggs, perfectly poached and I emphasize perfectly. This alone is a very promising sign because you would be surprised how often poached eggs miss the mark. The carne asada was good! I was a little skeptical when I saw it on the menu but it had good flavor, the meat is seasoned but not overbearingly, you still taste delicious meat. It&#39;s cut up into smaller pieces than I expected but there was a good amount of it. 

The cornbread muffin was a little too sweet for me but cornbread is always subject to opinion. It was still an interesting sub for the standard English muffin and arguably did a better job soaking up sauce, yolk and meat juice. 

The sauce, while by no means bad, was not what I was expecting. I may had misread the description but I was expecting a hollandaise with pureed poblano mixed in. I&#39;m pretty sure that the base of the sauce was not hollandaise, it was more of a creamy, smooth salsa but... it didn&#39;t taste as boldly &#39;pablano&#39; as I was hoping it would. The peppers could be roasted before being added which would up thier presence but with the sauce not fulfilling my desire for hollandaise or pablano left the dish tasting like it was missing something. On its own the sauce is good but I feel for this dish it could be improved.

For sides I got the home fries, thin sliced potatoes fried in butter, which were very good and the Spanish rice which was also good, maybe could use a touch more spice (there are hot sauces on the table) but still tasty. 

Coffee was a good temperature, not too strong but not weak, good flavor, pretty much what you would expect from a breakfast place. They have flavored creamers if that&#39;s your thing.

Over all it was a eggcellent meal, fair portion size and well prepared, and warrants a return visit. Round 2 of review can be expected in a week or two."

I read the fine print that can&#39;t use coupons on the weekend. That didn&#39;t stop us as we were kid free and determined thro eat an adult meal without cutting up anyone else&#39;s food.


Glad we made it. Nice place. Cute decor. Friendly staff. Menu was expansive and diverse. We didn&#39;t get too creative and opted for some Benedicts. One traditional and another with Carne asada. Both were very good. Sauce on both was excellent.

Only reasons not 5 stars were that my coffee went dry a few times and I asked for grilled tomato on my Benedict and it came out just raw."

Patio seating is nice but waiting times and prices are unreal for eggs. Perhaps having some breakfast mimosas could ease the pain for the prices. Although for restaurants flipping tables is a most, it looks that they want you out before you have the first bite. I don&#39;t think on repeating soon."

The staff is friendly &amp; we were seated immediately. They were playing rock music such as Bon Jovi &amp; Def Leppard, which made me very happy. :)  I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately I don&#39;t think we will be going back. We had a party of 3 - my mother, my 8 yr old son &amp; myself. I ordered the Border Benedict but was not thrilled with it, as it hardly had any taste even after I tried adding salt, pepper &amp; finally hot sauce - definitely not a normal condiment for me at breakfast.  Maybe it is just me, but the pablano sauce does NOT go with the sweet corn cakes at all.  My son&#39;s order was incorrect when we received it but the waiter quickly fixed it - he ordered kids scrambled eggs, fries &amp; bacon but ended up with a mickey mouse pancake, eggs &amp; fries. He didn&#39;t like it &amp; said the eggs didn&#39;t taste like anything, the whipped cream made his fries soggy &amp; the bacon was cold. He is usually not picky, so I was pretty surprised by this.  My mom ordered an omelette with cheese &amp; corned beef, again it was virtually tasteless. 
I was excited about the menu because it had some different items listed, many with a southwestern flair, however everything we tried was mediocre at best. I cannot recommend. :("

I have an aversion to eggs so I opted for the chicken with verde sauce. They were great. You could tell that they were made fresh, not scooped out of a casserole pan. Beans and rice were great too.

(Thanks for the heads up Courtney C.) It&#39;s good to see the old Bob Evans breakfast counter crew has some place to go once again. I had the privilege of meeting the brain child and franchisee developer John out of San Diego. This is their 19th location and only has this one location in Chicagoland for now. Expanding in Cincinnati and Florida currently. This is a scratch made kitchen and they have a heavy influence of Mexican dishes. Some unique items are available. I may have had a little hick up with some medium rare bacon being served, but they promptly suggested they would be happy to replace it. It wasn&#39;t necessary, as I was taking it home and will be heating it up again anyway. You may want to request the sausage or bacon be served on the side, as they smother it with gravy atop the large fluffy biscuit. They were generous and offered 3 on the house gift cards for a smoothie, waffle and pancakes. I gave the pancake card to a friend at the counter, who I hadn&#39;t seen in awhile from the Bob Evans morning crew. Power outlets with USB for charging your cell phone at the counter is a great idea. Free Wi-Fi means I&#39;ll be hanging out here charging my phone and doing business in the morning. Get here early if you want a counter seat during the week. Be sure to give a call if you&#39;re coming on the weekends for breakfast, as they&#39;ll be happy to put your name on the list. I love what they&#39;ve done with the inside, the place really needed a makeover."

Please don&#39;t review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you&#39;re connected in any way to the owner or employees.Their chicken vegetable soup was good and contained more chicken than I have ever had in a restaurant.  The tomato basil was another story.  It is my favorite soup but it was so spicy that I could not eat it.  I am leery of restaurants that use excessive spice.  Maybe Californians like it but here in the Midwest,  let the customers add hot sauce if they want it.  It is on the table.  I am just plain tired of spicy foods so I have to think twice about going here again."

We had 6 ppl and only had to wait 5 minutes. Coffee was served up right away and our server Diana was friendly and cheerful. This place is relatively new and nice, bright and clean inside.
The reason for only 3 stars was disappointed by some of our food. I got the mom omlet which sounded and looked amazing. However...it was served up cold. It was like they took the eggs and just folded in icey cold ingredients front the fridge :(
The same happened with the Machaca my dad ordered. 
The kids menu french toast came out great and so did the biscuits and gravy.
We will have to try and give this place another try and maybe chalk it up to being busy for a Sunday holiday."

There was a decent wait, but not unexpected on a Sunday morning.  After sitting, our server came pretty promptly to see if we would like something to drink.  Then it took a good 10 minutes to get the 2 chocolate milks and a coffee.  Both of my kids, who are chocolate milk connoisseurs, said the milk did not taste like chocolate milk, but rather plain old white.  I had a &#34;make your own omelette&#34;.  It was horrible.  I agree with other reviewers it was crazy thin, like a crepe, folded over the ingredients I requested inside my omelette.  And it was rubbery.  Something smelled and tasted really weird.  I wasn&#39;t sure which ingredient it was, but think it was the bacon.  Worst omelette I have ever had.  Thought it was pretty hard to mess up breakfast.

I really wanted to like this place, but I&#39;ve had as many bad meals as good ones. We haven&#39;t gone for lunch so this review is just based on breakfast. These are the things I&#39;ve ordered. Border Benedict was really good, very nice contrast between the spicy flavor of the sauce and the sweet corn of the muffin. Baja Breakfast Tacos were tasty, but they were served on a single tortilla which simply fell apart and they were unable to eat as a taco. Biscuits and gravy were really creamy sauce poured over a biscuit. The biscuit itself was OK but the &#34;gravy&#34; was not the typical sausage gravy you would find in the south. It was just some tasteless creamy sauce. The Sun Up Breakfast Sandwich was disgusting. The eggs were fried to death, and there was maybe one piece of bacon on the entire sandwich. There was one square of American cheese in the middle of the sandwich-the rest of the bread was plain. The Machaca was very tasty but how hard can you mess up scrambled eggs with chorizo? Today I ordered the BLT. Don&#39;t expect your traditional triple decker club, it&#39;s just two pieces of bread with lettuce, tomato, and barely more than one piece of bacon. I didn&#39;t even eat it, just sent it back. I like hash browns very crispy. My usual ordering instructions are &#34;cook &#39;em till you think they&#39;re burnt then cook them again&#34; FAIL! Got a little brown on the top and mushy potato. So turned me off. Unable to get really well cooked home fries either. Fresh fruit is good, but they just serve REALLY big chunks of fruit that almost need their own plate. The wait staff is really nice and accomodating - they took off meals I didn&#39;t like and gave us coupons to use in the future, but we haven&#39;t used any of them (they&#39;re only good during the week) and I&#39;m finding fewer things on the menu I want to try or go back to. Very disappointed and I guess I&#39;m going back to cooking breakfast at home."

The Broken Yolk is a refreshing change to the other so called &#34;breakfast places&#34; in the Plainfield/ Naperville area. 
Why is it a refreshing change?  Awesome wait staff. Friendly professional hostess, an owner that by all accounts, is committed to customer satisfaction. I did not find that in some of the other places  I used to go to.
 I have to the yolk three time since they opened and each time the food seems to get even better.
I had the chicken fired steak the first day. I have had  it many times at other places, but this place knows what fresh really means. The meat was tender, the homestyle fries were perfection.The eggs were perfectly done, not greasy as in some other places. Even the iced tea was perfect.
The second time I tried the waffles and chicken. Once again fresh, Huge portions of chicken and the waffle was just right.
Today I had the Corned beef hash and eggs. This was some of the best corned beef hash I have ever had. You can really taste the corned beef, not like some places that drown it in salt and grease. The eggs were once again scrambled just the way I like them. I can&#39;t say enough about the home style potatoes. 
I have to mention that they have a rewards program which is nice. 
This will be my go to restaurant. This is one place where you can truly get &#34;excited&#34; about."

We were saddened when the doors closed but was pleasantly surprised when Broken Yolk popped up to replace it.  I&#39;m happy to say that the food was excellent.  The Tiki french toast is highly recommended and will quickly become a staple. The food is fresh and very tasty.  The decor is a huge improvement.  Everyone greets you wherever you turn. With this much positive reviews you would think I would of rated higher but the only draw back, which is often the case, was the server.  Our particular server was not on point at all.  She hardly brought us refills.  When we tried to order a single item as takeout for our oldest who opted to wait at home, her reaction was one of annoyance.  The tables she was serving wasn&#39;t even full so it unfortunately isn&#39;t much of an excuse about things being too busy.  Most establishments realize that it comes down to the server that can make or break your experience. If this wasn&#39;t the case then at least my family would frequent the local China buffet.   Return visits are based on food, price and the experience.  We are hoping Broken Yolk will succeed but it will depend if they throw out some bad eggs in the process. No pun intended."

As you wait your turn, everyone rubs elbows, shoulders, bellies and butts. No one is afraid to step in front of you, let alone stamp on your foot.

Why? Because this is a typical Polish Deli...the interior is a little bigger than a matchbox and a tad smaller than a box of animal crackers. Szela&#39;s attracts a crowd of customers and your patience will be tested. The store only has two small isles, one of which is the congested deli counter.

However the food quality is not typical...&#34;it&#39;s better&#34; than most Polish Delis I&#39;ve encountered, and blows away the popular &#34;wanna-be&#34; and scam &#34;chain delis&#34; in Naperville.

They have a section of prepackaged goods that are all Polish. Lots of pickles and stuff like that. They also have a good selection of bread from a local Polish bakery.

The best part is the deli. Towards the back of the store there is a hot food section that usually features about 10 different items such as: hunter&#39;s stew, pierogies, stuffed cabbage, polish sausage, etc. There is some really good stuff there and you can get a 3-entree plate for a pretty reasonable price.

The second part of the deli is cold stuff behind the counter. There are cold salads and relishes, deli meat, and a wide variety of sausages.

Then you have the sandwich makers. On the wall behind the deli counter is a board with a great selection of sandwiches, both hot and cold. I usually get the Italian and it is amazing.

On top of the deli counters there is usually a bunch of different pastries that look incredible.

Obviously, I&#39;m not going to go here for all of my shopping needs, but this is my favorite lunch spot in town!"

So when Michelle L. suggested this new place, I was over there in a heartbeat!  Of course they had head cheese, and a full deli chock full of good polish imports!  Not only that, the baked goodies they had came from my favorite bakery in my old neighborhood!  They also had a heated selection of lunch-on-the go items, such as some very tasty cheese perogi, and cabbage rolls.  Also, agreeing with Michelle, their prices for non-import items were extravagantly high."

That being said, I&#39;m happy to say that my wife and I LOVED our visit!  We were able to brave the small swarm of bees outside this Saturday afternoon and started with a couple of cocktails and the Brussel sprout appetizer which was really well executed.  My wife ordered the breaded chicken and I had the Widowmaker sandwich.  She loved her perfectly cooked chicken breasts and the smashed potatoes were spot on. The sage cream sauce was an awesome way to tie the dish together.  My sandwich was nice in size and super tasty, but if I order again I will request more of the jalapeño and onion mixture as it really added great flavor. 

The food was great, our server (sorry I&#39;m HORRIBLE with names) did a really nice job. She was fast, informative (explained every special and where the products were sourced from) and attentive.  

Thanks for a great experience and we look forward to coming back again. Kudos to the kitchen for nicely thought out plates and great execution, and to the service as well."

The fries were stick-like, a bit overdone on the outside yet still a bit mushy on the inside. The Iced-tea was wonderful. The price was a bit high for a small veggie sandwich and fries ($15.19 with tax) plus tip of $3.25. For Lunch. I picked one of the most economical items on the menu. I actually thought there would be a more &#34;reasonably priced&#34; lunch menu but there was not. 

Here&#39;s why I didn&#39;t rate 5 stars... When we walked in we noticed that it was VERY loud. It was the music. It was just loud and hit us when we walked in the door. I said to the hostess &#34;is there a quiet place to sit&#34;, she said &#34;it&#39;s a small place this is the seating we have&#34;. Okay... We&#39;ll try it. My friend I was with was having a hard time hearing me and by the time we left, her ears felt as if she was at a concert... It was just soooo loud. I have a health issue that keeps me from talking loudly so I asked the waitress again about the noise (explained my health issue) and she said she&#39;d talk to the bartender about turning the music down (but it for some reason it seemed unlikely he&#39;d turn it down - I&#39;m not sure as she didn&#39;t get that far...) She walked away then came back quickly and suggested we sit at the booth in the back which may be more quiet. I checked it out and sure enough, it WAS more quiet. Just this one booth straight back from the entrance. We thought about sitting outside but it was chilly and breezy... So we moved and sat at the booth... 

Sadly this booth was TIGHT on both sides of the table... I&#39;m not a little person (5&#39;10&#34;) and my legs struggled to find a comfortable spot. Food came out rather slowly but we weren&#39;t in a rush (except for to get out of the booth) so that was fine. Again, I thought my sandwich was really good! I might get it again but just carry out or go when it&#39;s warmer so I can sit outside instead. Glad to have this restaurant in town but I think it&#39;d be nice if the calmed it down with the noise just a bit."

The high point here is service.  My waiter was welcoming, friendly, and responsive, and took my order quickly.  My food came out VERY fast so obviously the kitchen/wait staff are working closely together and doing a good job of it.  The food was still piping hot so I knew it was fresh out of the kitchen the instant it was ready.  As soon as I was done eating, my plate was whisked away, I was offered dessert (declined) and my check was promptly brought out.

Where this place missed the mark was the quality of food compared to the price paid.  I got the salmon and for $24 for a plate, I would have either expected a lot more food or much better final product.  The salmon fillet was overcooked and slightly chewy.  The pieces of bacon that were in it were also chewy - neither crispy nor soft, but in that awful middle region that no one likes.  The sauce and flavoring was good, as was the butternut squash puree under it, also I loved the caramelized onions, there just wasn&#39;t enough of this other stuff.

The ambiance is also not bad; it can get a bit noisy in there due to the all-wood finishes.  Not necessarily a great date spot but good for small groups or double-dates.

I&#39;ve only been to Joliet on business so I would say Sovereign is targeting an otherwise underserved market by going for the more high-end dining, because I&#39;m here on business expensing my meals and this is more than double what I&#39;ve paid for any other meal while in the Joliet area without driving closer in to Chicago.  I think they need to pick up the food quality if they want to earn more business."

We were finally in the area and I&#39;ve had Sovereign on my bookmark list for a while. The outside of the place looks like you may have made a wrong turned and pulled up to your great-grandmother&#39;s house. This is a good thing. 

Walking in, I already felt comfortable because it does feel like you are dining in someone&#39;s home. The mismatched plates and other charming decor add to the feeling that you are having a dinner party with friends. We stopped for lunch so we ordered from the lunch menu, naturally. 

Both the pork sandwich and the chicken and artichoke sandwich were absolutely delicious. We also tried a small plate of their wings and the spice was so good on them. I loved that I could choose my side, and opted for green beans, instead of the usual fries. Everything that we ordered tasted so fresh and just tasty. Oh, and I can&#39;t forget their impressive drink menu-they will definitely have a beer or cocktail that you will love. I had a cider that was so good.

This bar restaurant makes visiting Plainfield worthwhile, as dining here is sure to be a memorable experience. 

Starting with the interior they must have brought in an urban architect. The creative space and bar layout can be social while staying intimate. The acoustics keep the background music at a reasonable level, allowing patrons to have conversations unlike the few loud, lackluster  bars on the street.

Food is amazing any they now source their own cows from a local farm. I enjoyed the Widowmaker pork belly sandwich, which lives up to its name with super-hot jalapenos. The eclectic mix of craft beers and creative cocktails cannot be beat within a 20 mile radius surrounding the restaurant. Vegetarians will also love this place. I have never had a better side of kale in my life. Green beans were also super fresh. 
The mixologist bartender was super knowledgeable mentioning booze trends, and schooling our party on various of vodka ingredients. 

The unisex bathrooms will make you look twice, and the black restroom fixtures simulate peeing into the abyss....

Trendy place in Plainfield, this town has grown up!
Started out with the fried Brussels for the group, and they disappeared quickly... Not too greasy and with a good sprouty flavor.
Ordered the Caesar salad and it was a bit dry and average on flavor. The highlight for me was the featured tacos...pulled pork on corn tortillas with crema and cilantro as well as a mole topping...very tasty!
25 beers on draft and a large offering of &#34;craft&#34; cocktails.... Beware everything &#34;craft&#34; is pricey!
Ambiance is medieval bario and prices are above expectation.
Ok place, but nothing on the menu that would make me come back...this joint does not make the list."

What you can also appreciate is that sovereign gives you a large choice of sides for your meals, other than just &#39;fries&#39;. Those brussel sprouts were nothing short than amazing. The pork belly sandwich was also pretty decent.

Negatives would be that my wife&#39;s mushroom gyro sandwich really makes a vegetarian regret their life choices. Truly off putting is the loudness factor. My wife and I were sat at a table in the front room of the house and there is zero sound insulation. Sitting next to us was a table of 8 chatty trixies out for a birthday. My wife and I nearly had to scream at each other to get two words across in conversation. 

If I was to return, I&#39;d make sure to simply order the sprouts appetizer non-stop and garner a spot at the bar."

I brought a friend here late at night after arriving from a flight and arrived shortly after 11 pm. The second I pulled into the restaurant, we saw two staff members smoking outside and we got out of the car. The staff members said nothing to us and rushed in to close and lock the door. They didn&#39;t speak to us or even mention that they were closing early.

I am not an unreasonable person. If a restaurant decides to close early because it is empty, that is totally acceptable. But to close and lock the door without saying one word to the potential patrons who simply came during opening hours? Completely disrespectful. I visit outer Chicago often and I will not be returning, despite having positive experiences in the past."

I have sat at the bar and in the dining section and have received excellent customer service in both areas.  The bartenders and wait staff really make you feel welcomed and want you to come back and visit again.  I also noticed that in the dining section a manager walks around and casually asks if your dining experience is going well.  It is not instrusive at all and shows that they truly care about how you feel about their restaurant. 

Oh and the food and drink...well lets just say that it is AWESOME! I highly recommend building your own burger or the Widowmaker sandwich, both are mouthwatering.  Their tap list is quite impressive for they have craft beers that are hard to come by...someone has a good connection here :)  My only wish is that I lived closer and can frequent this place more often.  Whenever I am in the area I will be sure to stop in! Keep up the great work Sovereign!

Special tip: You can order a flight here...They will serve you 4 oz. pours of whatever you want.  I chose three when I went.  Also the ground brisket that is used to make their burgers is infused with BACON!"

It never feels too busy, and the service is great.

If I had to choose a negative, it would be that sometimes that items we try to order are not available because they didn&#39;t get the produce shipments in for it, but due to the farm-to-table nature of the restaurant, that it to be expected. 

Anyways, when that happens it forces us to branch out from the tried and true favorites and experience something new. 

I love the small plates and the flavorful vegetarian options they offer.

Next came the desserts...key lime pie and Oreo pie...OH MY!!

Our server Ryan was very knowledgeable and had a great attitude. He recommended some of his favorites on the menu.

We started with the Brussels sprouts appetizer which was a standout, along with the Caesar salad. We then got the dig on swine which was by far the best pork shank any of us have ever eaten. Next was the Wiccan chicken which was also very good, the mashed potatos on the side were very flavorful.

When my husband bit into his burger he went &#34;Oh my God....... that is GOOD.&#34; The meat itself just had incredible flavor. For sides we got the garlic broccoli, which was just ok, kind of cold. It wasn&#39;t bad but wouldn&#39;t order to again. 

I also ordered a Bloody Mary.  I will admit, after reading all the awesome reviews for them on here I was super excited and had high expectations. I was a little disappointed once I got it.. I prefer a spicy bloody Mary and this was rather sweet and had a different flavor to it than I am used to. The side car was delicious, but not worth the extra money.

You&#39;re not hitting this place up for a &#34;lite&#34; meal! Now, we&#39;re not trendy people by any means, but we didn&#39;t feel out of place in this somewhat trendy place either!

We all opted for items off of the specials menu. We were not disappointed by any means. We also tried a variety of strange and unusual mixed drinks too (we shared them all so we could try a bunch lol!). Some of them were ok, others (one with egg in it!) we won&#39;t likely order again, but we were adventurous enough to try them! The boys also had a variety of the craft beers that they have on hand.

A couple of us ordered the Hawaiian Opa (Moon fish) with pan seared green beans (I&#39;m not fancy enough to call them haricot vert). The fish was perfectly seared on the outside and cooked with this mouth watering sauce. I wish I could remember what it was! Then I could continue to make you drool by describing it!

The boy got  the Pork Destroyer... Don&#39;t even ask how many ways they were able to put pork on this sandwich! It was ridiculous! There was bacon jam, pulled pork, pork loin?, and some other things I am failing to remember! Let&#39;s just say that when we left we were food drunk! You might think that I&#39;m lying and that we were wasted on above mentioned drinks (which we may have been if we hadn&#39;t eaten), but it was the food that sent us overboard!

This place has a nouveau country diner style and a comfort food theme.  

We did their brussel sprouts appetizer which was fantastic as was their beer list.  I ordered the market ribeye sourced from a few miles down the road and my wife had the market fish. I have to say both were unimpressive.  I like salt as much as the next guy but I have never tasted a steak as salty as that ribeye(and I love cured meats).  What a shame.  The fish was better but still did not impress.

Our server was great and very knowledgable about drinks and food on the menu.

We started with the Brussels and Flow and sausage plate. I haven&#39;t had Brussels sprouts since I was a child and my mom made me eat them. These were perfectly roasted and the red chili sauce was the perfect dipper. I have a whole new mindset on sprouts! Sausage plate was amazing- three types of sausage links served with a Dijon and red cabbage. 

I ordered the Dig on Swine. Probably the best pork I&#39;ve ever had. Ever. Sweet potatoes may have had a tad too much butter (Sounds silly, I know). The kale had lots of garlic on it so I forgot I was eating kale. Thank goodness.

Two people in my party ordered the stew and enjoyed it. It was tomato based. And my father in law enjoyed his steak.

This is the best restaurant in the southwest suburbs. If you have never been here, you are missing out.
(Not sure why I would tell you this, because now getting a table on a weekend evening will get even harder.)
I have now eaten here more than 40 times, and it has never once disappointed. Never once.
All of the ingredients are amazingly fresh. They don&#39;t even have a freezer or a microwave on the premises. How many restaurants can say that?
Today I had the Chicken Wings, which I get pretty much every time I eat here. They are the best I&#39;ve ever had anywhere...every time. Perfectly cooked, succulent, sweet, tangy, with just a bit of spice. Amazing!
I also get the small plate tacos almost every time, because DAMN!, they are also amazing. Unlike the wings, they change the ingredients periodically. This time they were chorizo beef with cilantro, onion, and a special sauce. Delicious! 
I do miss the pork tacos with pineapple and radish, but they&#39;ll be back. Can&#39;t wait. I&#39;ve just finished eating and my mouth is watering just thinking about them.
And lastly, I had the pork belly. The pork belly. All I can say is that it rivals the pork belly from Publican in Chicago, and that is high praise. It was ridiculously tender, juicy, with just the right amount of fat. Perfect pork belly is a thing of beauty. (...more mouth watering going on here) 

I can&#39;t wait to go back and try the new hanger steak and hash that they just added to the menu. It sounds amazing."

Been there 3 times including my anniversary special dinner. The Fried Brussel Sprouts with sweet chili sauce is the best thing here. Ordered the blue fish special 10/24/15 and the fish was fishy and putrid while the wife had the burger which was delicious (the one bite I had). Went back twice since then to have the burger for myself and was very disappointed. The meat came thin in 2 patties both cooked into oblivion both times and my Brussels were never put in until I asked right before the burgers came out (easily comped us a small plate for free)
Conclusion:
Servers are nice...place is way cleaner than previous owner (bin #8 something)...beer selection is decent (better 1st two trips then the last one on 8/27/16)...consistency seems to be an issue reading how everyone gushes about the burger (if a software consultant can cook a burger better than a chef)...a bit overpriced to be disappointed 3 times in a row...probably won&#39;t be back"

It&#39;s really nice inside- dark, dimly lit, lots of wood, pretty view of downtown Plainfield. We had reservations so we were seated quickly. Our server was very nice and informative and patient answering questions and making recommendations. He seemed to really enjoy what he was doing. When we got there (around 4pm) it was quiet with regular restaurant level noise and murmur. By the time we left (630pm-ish) the restaurant had gotten busier and the volume had gone up. The crowd went from older people, people on dates, and families to younger groups. Not a bad thing, just plan your arrival time accordingly.
I&#39;m going to be honest- I cannot remember if there was specifically a kids&#39; menu. I double checked online and I didn&#39;t see one on the site. But I do remember I ordered my son a grilled cheese sandwich with fries. He gobbled as much as his tiny tummy could take (he was only 13 months old at this point) but I will say I took a bite and it was delicious. We were seated in a corner by the windows up front. My son had a view of the bar and he was completely entertained watching the bartender the whole time. 
My mom and I ordered a drink that the server described as their take on the Moscow Mule and it was DELICIOUS. My brother asked if they had anything along the lines of Dos Equis and not only could the server make a recommendation but my brother enjoyed it.
We ordered the Sausage Fest and the Brussel &amp; Flow to start. It was all delicious. I loved the Sausage Fest (that&#39;s what she said) and I&#39;m pretty hesitant about sausages (that&#39;s what she said...ok I promise I&#39;m done). The Brussels sprouts were amazing. I didn&#39;t even use the chili sauce they came with because standalone they were great.
I got the Wiccan chicken. The portion was HUGE. The breading was perfect, the mashed potatoes were on point. I was happy to take left overs because I basically went straight fat kid and smashed it later that night. 
Overall very pleased. Even my dad and brother who are pretty standoffish with anything slightly out of the norm enjoyed it."

I came later on a Saturday evening, and it was still packed.  First good sign.  Thankfully I didn&#39;t have to wait long for a table.  When we say we were served room temp purified water in a nifty bottle.  Cool idea!  

For a drink I ended up ordering this cocktail (can&#39;t remember the name) it was a cream based with lime juice and smokey tequila.  Yes, it had a smoky flavor.  It was so odd... But yet really good!  And it was served with a cucumber slice!  It all came together nicely. 

For dinner my partner and I ordered the Wiccan Chicken.  This meal was amazing!!  The chicken was perfectly breaded and fried.  It was just right.  Nice and light, not greasy.  The mashed potatoes was smooth as butter and the Dijon sage cream sauce on top sealed the deal. 

For dessert, I had a dreamsicle pie and my partner had a cookies and cream pie.  Both were awesome!  Only thing that slightly annoyed me was the price of the pie slice was high for what it was. 

I will definitely return to this establishment and hopefully they won&#39;t be out of the meatloaf everyone raves about!!!"

I have visited a couple of times. The menu changes seasonally and is full of lovely surprises. They serve decent portion sizes which allows you to order a couple of things instead of just getting stuck with one huge entrée! The wings are great and so are their bloodymarys!! They call it the Bloody Selena and that is  phenomenal- right from the presentation to the flavor and taste. They serve a Habanero beer to chase it down. My bloody Selena experience is one to remember. Their drinks menu also has a great variety. Although this place may lack vegetarian variety. The have their own parking and have very friendly staff.

A rotating beer tap that changes frequently keeps bringing the beer snob in me back pretty frequently. The food is very good too. It is a farm to table restaurant so the food is local and fresh. I have not had a bad item there. The brussel sprouts are to die for (and u don&#39;t like brussel sprouts). Some other favorites are the tacos, risotto and the wings.

He came back shocked how fast I ate them...I was like I&#39;m they were smaller then the palm of my hand haha.

We came here to try something new not really knowing what to expect, we were not disappointed! The building from The outside does not really give off the look of a restaurant so make sure you don&#39;t miss it! The parking lot is nice and big so no need to worry about finding a spot!

We were greeted by the hostess at the door and promptly sat at what seemed like the furtherest table in the restaurant. But it was actually a really nice spot! Lots of fun decorations to look at and not to much noise around us, and we were not forgotten about ;) 

The speciality drinks were awesome! I tried a few and liked them, also many many different beers to try...the food menu is not super big but it does not need to be! They have specials from each section that change all the time! I got the enchiladas and they were to die for!!! I am craving them now thinking about it!

A new, holier-than-thou list of rules, condescending wait staff and laughable price points. Hey, I get it. We all want to be cool kids. But refusing to make my wife a grilled cheese sandwich as a vegetarian option shows you where their head is at (mainly up their ass). 

I&#39;ll resist the urge to go into their portion sizes, lack of any real atmosphere, and poor interpretation of farm - to-table concepts. Save yourself the trouble, go to Whole Foods, buy $50 worth of fancy food, light a $20 on fire, and you&#39;ll still be ahead both taste - wise and financially.

Go across the street to TCC Wine and Cheese or down to Moe Joe&#39;s. #neveragain"

I never enjoyed Sprouts that much before now. The beer selection is pretty da-weet! 

It is loud, but get over it. Don&#39;t be a Chauncey and enjoy a lively bar with better than average acoustics. The placement is good for people watching because Plainfield is full of freaks. I saw two people walking together holding hands, I&#39;m pretty sure they were conjoined twins....or married and in love. There was also a bearded lady, or maybe just a hipster with a beard. You can&#39;t really tell these days. Oh, wait, there was also a Benjamin Button type thing going on, but instead the child being old but young looking this child was young but young looking. The freaks owners insisted it was a &#34;child&#34; but we all know what&#39;s going on in Plainfield.

We got wings as an appetizer and even though I&#39;m not a fan of bone in wings I loved these! Spicy and not at all creepy looking like bone in wings tend to be. I also had a few of these AMAZING pear drinks served with a pear and brie cheese (can&#39;t tell you what it is but more on that later)! I ordered the Wiccan Chicken which came out with a HUGE portion and I bit in and was in heaven. Like it was beyond words the best chicken and mashed potatoes of my life. Our server was a total doll, sweet, accommodating and a fantastic server. He explained the farm to fork experience if you are into it then this is for you. I don&#39;t understand the significance of it. I live in the country it just seems obvious to me.

What I didn&#39;t like. There were hornets outside. My dining companion is allergic and there were so many we had to move inside even though it was a beautiful day. The vegetable sides! I hated the green beans my server graciously offered something else. I was told to try the Kale which I hated. I didn&#39;t want to complain again so I gave both to my dining companion who happily gobbled them down. 

Now for the last bad point. I have been raving about my experience here and was very disappointed to learn that the drink menu is not online! All things considered I could look aside my grumbles and give the place a five star rating if they included the drink menu on their website and made it a little more user friendly! Wink wink ;)"

With the menu always changing and them having different things at lunch and dinner, I&#39;ve yet to find my &#34;favorite&#34; dish here. However, we stopped in Saturday night for a friend&#39;s birthday and I definitely think it was my best experience so far. We did have an hour wait for a group of 5 which sucked, especially because we didn&#39;t end up being seated til after 9 but what can you do. 

I started with the house salad, which is always good here. The soup was a spicy chicken and it was AMAZING. I could have eaten 3 bowls of it. So good. We also had the frites with egg on top which was very delicious. My friend and I split the banana cream pie for dessert which was the perfect ending. Service was good and they split our check which was awesome.

Only complaint this visit: my friend wanted the fruit salad and was told they only serve it at lunch even though online it is on their dinner menu. I&#39;ve noticed their online menu and the in person menu are often different. Also, I am missing their delicious sourdough bread! I hope it comes back."

When I tried ordering brussel sprouts as an appetizer they weren&#39;t ready yet because they were shipped in that morning. I appreciate the freshness but it cuts back on an already-small menu.  I ordered the Klinger Wants Home with a side of salted green beans. Overall, it was very delicious and the spicy mayo gave it its kick. My favorite part of my lunch was the bloody mary. It comes garnished with a hot wing, celery, pickle, cheese and meat. It burns in the best way possible. Only 3/5 stars for the price as well. For three eating lunch it was $75.

I am always nervous that my expectations will leave me disappointed with a new restaurant.... Not a chance at Sovereign!!

My buddy and I met for lunch on a Monday so it was relatively empty which is fine with me.  We sat near the bar and were immediately met by our server.  I couldn&#39;t drink but my friend (who is as close to a beer sommelier as I know) studied the beer menu and was very pleased with the selections and uniqueness of their offerings.
I ordered a cream soda....

The lunch menu is a sandwich heavy sampling of the dinner menu (I know this cuz I&#39;ve had a copy of the dinner menu on my desk for weeks!!!). 

We chose to both start with the SOD (soup of the day for those that never worked in the industry) which was cream of mushroom.  The soup flavor was outstanding.... However, it was served Luke warm.  I found this small screw up odd given the previous reviews commenting this problem.  Cmon guys, turn up the crock pot!!!!  B-

We then split the wings A++.  The risotto (hen of the woods mushroom and pecorino) A+++++++.  And the tacos A.  We both were extremely pleased with the service, food and  the ambiance.   We are now eager to try the dinner selections very very soon!!

This restaurant is an oasis in will county.  Anyone who considers themselves a foodie must give Sovereign a spin, and be prepared to give your tastebuds a ride!

Mom had some small batch vodka and was happy. 

Mom ordered a Pork shank with puréed sweet potatoes and kale. She described it as &#34;outrageous&#34; and had enough leftovers for a second meal. I had a pork sandwich which was cooked to perfection and served on an artisan bun. Good flavor combo and great size. I&#39;ll have the other half for lunch tomorrow and I will be happy.

We ate there around mid-late afternoon on a Saturday and given how bustling it was then, I could definitely see it filling pretty well during dinner hour.  

We ordered off the lunch menu, which was probably a little more than the average we pay, but not out of range of what we&#39;d expect for a place that has something a little more interesting or unconventional to offer.  I loved the seasonally shifting menu and many locally sourced items.  I had the &#34;Bird and the Bee&#34; wings and a side of asparagus - both were good, and it probably sounds weird, but I especially loved the asparagus.  I have mad love for asparagus, order it whenever I see it in a restaurant, and theirs just had the perfect tenderness and flavor.  Husband had the Paradise by Dashboard Light which was a meatloaf with elk, bison and boar, and loved it all.  I ordered my drink off the seasonal drink menu, with the server&#39;s recommendation, and was a big fan of that as well.

Not only does Sovereign have killer food and drinks, a great vibe and friendly wait staff, they go out of their way to help  their customers. I couldn&#39;t be more appreciative of Dale&#39;s help.

Food was delicious. Got fried brussel sprouts and they were very good; add just a little longer in the fryer for crisper inside. My hubby had Porky&#39;s revenge and loved it. Plenty flavorful. I had the Widowmaker and it was the most amazing sandwich ever. Every little detail was perfect: gooey cheese, fresh, crispy bread, and tender meat. Mashed potatoes were to die for as well. 

Beer selection is very good, and our waiter (Walter I think) was phenomenal and accommodating.

Once again a solid 5 stars!!!!"

My only regret is that we don&#39;t often have a babysitter and don&#39;t get to come here as much as we would like. (I suppose I could bring my child, but what fun would that be?!)

The food is always delicious and the service has always been excellent. I love that the menu changes often, as it should when fresh, local ingredients are being offered. I love that the setting is not too stuffy. I like when places really focus on the food and not on the silverware and place settings, because I don&#39;t care as much about that. The drink list is also great. I love all the whiskey cocktails and the draft beer selection is great!"

I have had lunch 3 times so far and everytime I received excellent service.  Solid find in downtown Plainfield. The wait staff is very polite and know the menu very well.  The food was amazing. I enjoyed the unique takes on standard grub. I have had there famous tacos, and Widow Maker sandwich.  No complaints except tacos are very small. If they added another taco and charge an extra $2.00 it would be worth it. (Its just my personal opinion)
Prices are fairly high for lunch time but I don&#39;t mind paying. Good food, fresh, healthy,  and good service, worth the extra coin. 
Beer is great, many to choose from with detailed descriptions.  Finally a place that dosent sell garbage beer!!!! No Corona,  MGD, Miller you know what I&#39;m talking about. 
They have there own parking lot, so far I have not had any issues parking. 
Very clean bathrooms.......
I&#39;m looking forward to trying many of there other items on menu, including beers. 
Great place weather you eat alone; with a friend or group."

Our server was awesome in recommending some of his favorite entrees and appetizers. I started off with their &#39;Repentless&#39; cocktail infused with strawberry koval bourbon and basil - one of my favorite drinks I&#39;ve ever had! My boyfriend and I then split the small plate tacos with chorizo and potatoes (SO DELICIOUS), risotto (flavor changes daily and I highly recommend) and brussel sprouts. I got the Wiccan Chicken that I ate every bite of - so tasty! My boyfriend got the Widow Maker and loved it.

If you&#39;re in the Plainfield area or a nearby suburb, I highly recommend. They even have a cute patio outside for the warmer weather months."

The beer listvery expansive and though I&#39;ve had a couple of visits here, I have yet to try a cocktail because the beer list is so big.

The food is good.  Though be fairly warned that if you order anything involving peppers, it will be near overwhelming as terms of spice content goes.  I have a fairly high tolerance for spice and here have been a few dishes I&#39;ve tried (Bahn mi and Pork Belly Sandwich) that have pushed me to the limits of what I find acceptable heat level in a dish.

That aside, I haven&#39;t been disappointed with any of my meals here.  The price points on the menu are near the high end of reasonable, but you don&#39;t get disappointed on the downside because relative to anything that is in the area this place does food and beer the best."

We decided to give it a try after getting a late start on Saturday night (8:00pm).  We were able to get seated right away outside on their deck.  Our server was very attentive the whole night and gave excellent recommendations.  The menu was somewhat limited, but considering the seasonality and local suppliers of the ingredients, still found a few alternatives that sounded good.  With a hearty appetite, she suggested one of the main entrees instead of the small plates.  I went with the Shank and it was delicious.  We were told that it would take 20 minutes which was fine considering the specialty drink menu.  The meat literally fell off the bone.  And the kale and sweet potato purée complimented the meal perfectly.  My wife had the chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.  Great comfort food.  This is the first time in a while that there was nothing left on either of the plates except for the bones from the shank.  It&#39;s a little pricey but worth it.  The atmosphere was good as well, filled but not overly crowded.  Definitely will be back."

But I left Sovereign with the feeling that there isn&#39;t much to brag about.

Sovereign took the old Bin 48 space, so if you are familiar with that old restaurant, you know it&#39;s beautiful in here.  It&#39;s dimly lit, with wood floors and a dark wood bar and tables.  The bar is at the center of the restaurant, and surrounded by several tables.  The restaurant is small though.  By the time we left on Friday night around 7:00 p.m., there was a good amount of people waiting for a table.

We received great service at Sovereign.  There&#39;s a strange misconception that Sovereign is a &#34;hipster&#34; joint.  Just because a restaurant has a farm-to-table menu concept, hosts a great craft beer menu, and some employees may have beards, mustaches, or unique hairstyles does NOT make it &#34;hipster.&#34;  Sovereign is trendy and modern.  From what I could tell, the patrons were locals in their 40s-50s.  We were definitely the younger ones here.  It&#39;s also family friendly - they have kid&#39;s cups with lids.

Anyway, our server was patient with us when ordering and also was able to describe and suggest beers to us.

The chocolate caramelized churro stout caught my eye, but I wasn&#39;t sure I would enjoy a whole glass.  I asked for a sample, which they will provide, but samples are a fraction of the cost of the whole beer.  I&#39;m not being a cheap ass, but I&#39;m used to several establishments allowing you to try a shot glass-size of beer free of charge.  Sovereign&#39;s samples are 5 oz., and my one sample was $4.  It was worth trying, and it&#39;s actually an excellent beer, but I would steer clear of ordering anything you&#39;re hesitant about.  Sovereign isn&#39;t about sampling beer.  Luckily, I would trust our server to make recommendations if needed.

The farm-to-table menu concept seems new to some suburbanites, especially Plainfieldians who likely flock to the local Red Robin for their burgers on the weekends.  We both had the burger, for the reason that it is made with brisket and bacon, but I didn&#39;t really like it.  The patty was dry, the BBQ sauce with it was watery, the cheese was kind of melted off of the burger, so I didn&#39;t see the &#34;wow&#34; factor here.  They also nickle and dime you for each topping.  

We also shared an order of the truffle fries.  They were delicious, but for $10 I would have expected more.  I know this is a gastropub serving items with quality ingredients, but I couldn&#39;t really get past the price on the fries.

When the bill came, it was paperclipped to a paper &#34;mission statement,&#34; which stated that Sovereign supports all people, races, etc.  Then I saw something curious:

&#34;Things We Do Not Support;  Yelp.&#34;

No further explanation on that one.  For a new establishment, I find this really awkward and kind of defensive.  Was it meant to be funny?  My knee jerk reaction was that it was condescending.  This isn&#39;t downtown Chicago - most of the reviews of Sovereign - most of the FIVE STAR reviews - are from Yelpers in &amp; around the Plainfield area.  Is that not like looking a gift horse in the mouth?  Most of the reviews here are positive, which had convinced me to try Sovereign instead of leaving it hidden in my &#34;bookmarks&#34; list forever.

I get it though, kind of.  Some of the negative reviews about the food and price point are from people who probably haven&#39;t frequented many restaurants of a similar concept/price point.  To that I say, read the menu online before you go!  However, owners should have thick enough skin that they don&#39;t need a silly little mission statement.  One of them fought back against an admittedly psychotic sounding review, but they ended up sounding just as arrogant and childish.

A friend of mine was here recently and had the pork belly sandwich.  He raved about it.  So, if you&#39;re still intrigued by Sovereign I would say skip the burger and give that a try instead.  And while you&#39;re at it, trust your server to make a great beer recommendation.

I do kind of want to go back and try the cocktails...we&#39;ll see."

Seriously, Plainfield was thirsty for a little hipster place such as this. Throw some craft beers, some local fare, and a nice modern design to the menu and room, and the thirst has been quenched. 

They give no shits about Yelp, though, as mentioned on their menu. They take their restaurant seriously, a labor of love. Crazy right? They actually give a s*$% about their craft. I watch these guys on Facebook and they even closed down to restock. Refreshing. 

Once again we ate too much and rolled home. Pork belly, burgers, truffle fries with an egg on top, scallops. You guys are fatasses. They don&#39;t really have a website and the menu varies as the supply changes. This shouldn&#39;t stop you though.

Red onion and tomato were cut much too thick making it difficult to keep the burger together. I had the staff favorite widow maker sandwich. Sounds good on paper but the pork belly is flavorless and tough to chew.  Overall the food was very bland.

Food: Menu is pretty small, but there is nothing inherently wrong with that. I ordered a burger, hubs ordered a spicy pork sandwich, &#34;The Widow Maker&#34;. The burger was was billed as a house-ground bacon and brisket blend; I just didn&#39;t care for it much. It tasted kind of pork-y, but not in a good way, and it was actually 2 smallish patties stacked on top of one another so they slid all over the place. The ground pork also means you can&#39;t get this cooked below &#34;done.&#34; I had fries with it, and they were clearly house-made, but not well executed. They were dark brown, greasy, and limp, and had a bitter taste to them. I think their fry oil was old and/or not hot enough. Hubby said his sandwich was OK, it was a little light on the filling compared to the amount of bread, and the jalapenos were just thrown in a pile on each half so there was one or two spicy bites and the rest didn&#39;t have heat. The pork itself was pretty good, he liked the kale side he ordered (I was tried the kale and thought it was pretty plain).

Drink: This was one of the most disappointing aspects. My husband was really, really looking forward to a large craft brew list, but we were a little confounded by their choices. The day  we dined, there were 25 drafts, and 15(!!) of them were stouts or porter. That&#39;s a lot of dark, heavy beer! And not what either of us usually drinks with a meal. Most of the other 10 were sours, with some really high-alcohol barleywine types mixed in. And one rye flavored with pepper. Almost every beer they offered was being served in a 10oz snifter because they were all that heavy. I really respect that they choose mainly local and all craft, but within those parameters there are still lots of great red or amber ales, pilsners, pale ales, IPAs, etc to be had. I ended up trying a Blood Orange Gose, which was interesting but really tart, and hubs had one stout and something else in a snifter that he wasn&#39;t super happy with.

Ambiance: They did a great job with the building, it&#39;s and old house with a cool feel. Loved the music they had playing in the background. Unfortunately, we were seated in a long, narrow room (converted sunroom, maybe? Lots of pretty windows) with a screaming toddler at either end of the room. Now, I can&#39;t really fault the restaurant for that- it&#39;s just bad luck- but it totally killed the vibe. 

Service: The gentleman that served us was nice enough, but he never told us about any specials even though several items on their menu are rotating market price options, and there seemed to be big gaps between his visits to our table. He just didn&#39;t seem to be very enthusiastic about... anything. Sigh...

TL;DR Food was lackluster, beer list was way too specific. About $50 for 3 beers and 2 sandwiches, before tip. We won&#39;t return."

They are absolutely fantastic. The salsa is so flavorful and the chips are actually CRUNCHY while covered in sauce. Combined with the rich egg yolk, it has become my favorite thing to eat.  My mouth is watering because I am waiting for my takeout while I write this review.


Oh also the horchata is some of the best I have ever had. Very spice rich. I still don&#39;t love the burrito, but I just think it&#39;s just not the right thing to order."

One order, for example, was for their Enchilada for $8.95 which included rice, beans, and a tortilla. What we received was only 3 enchiladas.

Reading the positive reviews on this place baffles me. I live in Saint Charles, but work in Naperville. After a lackluster experience and food at the St Charles location, I thought I&#39;d give the Naperville location a shot for lunch.....I should have trusted my instincts and avoided it.

Generally, reviews for restaurants are either really good or really bad. I almost never write reviews (if that gives you any indication). I ordered a pork burrito for takeout. After nearly 30 minutes, I got my to go order (there were 2 people in front of me). Upon opening my burrito, I was shocked at the size--about twice that of a Chipotle burrito. First bite? Gagtastic. The pork was sautéed in onion (good)--a bit salty--however, there was literally about a pound of:

-cold refried beans
-cold and raw onions
-cold lettuce
-liquid sour cream

To salvage this damn thing, I had to squeeze out the cold fixin&#39;s like a tube of toothpaste.

This is so odd because the place appeared to be run my Latinos! I guess I was spoiled in California with authentic Mexican food. This was simply atrocious and I would highly not recommend. 

The only saving grace was that I only lost $7 bucks out of the arrangement. I ate about 1/4 of what I paid for--terrible flavor, bad service, and a trash can in my cubicle filled with food that could have fed a small village....what&#39;s not to love?

Avoid."

Yeah, it&#39;s a little pricier compared to what I would expect to pay in a Mexican restaurant---- but the higher price is reflected on the quality of the food. Plus their prices is comparable to other restaurants in the area. 

I had an obsession with their fish taco--- so amazing!!-- it was fried fish (cod or tilapia?) and some sort of slaw that was just--- addictive. For some reason, the last time I had it--- it didn&#39;t agree with me--- probably getting old or whatever. Luckily, my bff ordered their shrimp taco which I got to try and now that&#39;s my go to taco. I haven&#39;t tried any of their other tacos... so I can&#39;t speak for  them. 

Their guacamole 2.5/5 is okay. Not amazing.. but hits the spot if I&#39;m craving it. It doesn&#39;t have a lot of flavor or kick to it... and I don&#39;t like the quasi pureed texture. Their horchata is pretty good 4/5. Their flan is amazing but inconsistent 4/5... you have a 75% chance of it being amazing... and 25% chance of it being okay.

I arrived 15 minutes later, and they told me they had no phone orders but they can have it ready in 5 minutes.  10 minutes later, they gave me the wrong burrito, ground beef, instead of steak.

So since my husband got ham enchiladas and I got something that looked like american cheese on my taco salad...I steered clear for over a year. I gave it several attempts and always ended up with a weird texture or the wrong type of food.

However...my husband started going back to this place in the last few months and was singing a different tune. &#34;This place got it together.&#34; He would come here when I was at class, knowing that I didn&#39;t want to go there ever. It was always his Jen-is-out-of-town-meal (or out-at-class meal, whatever). He kept raving about how it&#39;s finally good and now he prefers it.

So FINALLY about a week ago, we were craving some Mexican. He instantly popped out &#34;Jalapeño Grill!&#34;and I finally gave in, despite the ghosts of my prior experiences telling me not to. I simply allowed my husband to order something for me, and we both went home with the pastor enchiladas dinner.

WOW. Talk about a turnaround. These enchiladas were large, filling, and above all, flavorful! The food wasn&#39;t bland. The shells were tough. The meat wasn&#39;t cold. And the pork was actually pork (not ham)! This meal was huge, and yet I plowed through it and ate the entire thing, simply because I couldn&#39;t stop. Delicious!

Ok, so do I take back my previous reviews? No. Those experiences were not favorable and the reviews were truthful. However, I think that places make mistakes and maybe they were still training their staff/getting their bearings in their new location. I&#39;m glad they&#39;ve learned from their mistakes, because now there are some damn good enchiladas less than a mile from my house!"

Not going to lie, I&#39;m an idiot when it comes to knowing the difference between different Mexican dishes. I barely know what the difference between an enchilada versus  tostada versus burrito. So. When I wasn&#39;t exactly sure what I wanted, and there was no one in line, the lady at the counter was pretty annoyed with me. Which I found ridiculous. 

Prices are a little high for what you get. Tacos are about 2 dollars per taco. Guacamole is pretty reasonably priced. The plates are a touch high in my opinion in regards to price versus proportion. 

Otherwise the food was good. I enjoyed my enchilada, tacos, and guacamole. The chips were fresh out of the oven which was amazing. Their food was pretty good considering its a walk in place where you can take out food within minutes."

Growing up in Texas, everyone knows what it takes to make a good Tex-Mex meal. For starters, cheese! In addition, they serve Barbaco. Barbacoa is a slow cooked meat somewhat similar to pot roast, but very tender and very juicy. It&#39;s the Mexican way of BBQ, which is slow cooked to produce mouth watering heaven. In the Midwest, restaurants serving barbacoa are few and far between. In my conclusion, Jalapeño Grille offers a good menu and a great first experience sure to delight most foodies that can appreciate great Tex-Mex from the South.

Nonetheless, I&#39;m a fan of Mexican food, so I thought I&#39;d give this place a shot.

The first time I went, I got my standard two taco platter with the rice and beans. The tacos were al pastor with onion and cilantro only. The al pastor was awful. Very terrible tasting quality and bland. The rice had corn in it and the refried beans clearly came from a can and were warmed in a microwave. It was edible, but I wasn&#39;t very impressed.

I ended up here a second time, this time getting my usual but swapping the al pastor for chicken. ACK! Chewy, chewy chicken... it was so gross. The beans were barely warm, and again... corn in my rice. I managed to choke most of it down, as I was famished but had a terrible stomachache later that evening.

I&#39;ve been here twice and don&#39;t know why I wasn&#39;t here before. It&#39;s a hidden gem. Their chips and guacamole are very good. Chips are nice and warm. I ordered same platter both times because it was so good...the enchilada platter. Comes with plenty of food. 

Both times we have been here, someone comes around to see how the food was. Overall pretty good service. 

Haven&#39;t tried their margaritas. Will have to try soon. They have drink specials and I think weds is their margarita special for $4 per margarita I believe. 

Also serves breakfast all day! Always a plus for me! 

I will be back!"

First time I went, my order was incorrect. I wanted a grilled chicken sandwich and they gave me a fried chicken breast was originally a fried chicken breast. It was if they tried to peel off the fried portion and put it on a bun trying to pass it off as grilled. They also gave both of my orders fries when I had wanted chips and salsa. So I got some greasy and sleazy fries and no chips &amp; salsa. I normally like fries so I tried to eat them, but neither myself nor my husband could stomach them since they were so greasy. Unfortunately I was already home before I noticed this flawed order. This was within the first couple weeks they opened so I decided to try them again...

Second time I went in I decided on a couple tacos with chips and salsa. The tacos are nothing to write home about and maybe on the bland side. The salsa is really horrible though, its very watery and almost sweet. 

Overall, I don&#39;t think I will be back anytime soon, if at all."

This is another new Mexican restaurant that&#39;s popped up in the Fox Valley area. VERY tasty as the other reviews have already stated. I went on a couple of Saturdays ago since I saw a review here. It&#39;s in a mall that basically is a ghost town. This place just opened not long ago. I&#39;ve been twice and I can say that this place has the following:

- Good value for what you pay for. I&#39;ve ordered the regular burrito and let me tell you, you get your money&#39;s worth (the picture I posted is a regular chicken burrito). I looked at some other plates coming out (discretly I might add) and the servings looked like a very solid value.

- VERY friendly people. It has a &#34;neighborhood Mexican Diner&#34; type of feel to it. Not too big or small. My order was served pretty quickly and fresh. These people didn&#39;t know me from Adam yet they treated me as if they knew me. 

- While there weren&#39;t many people in during my visits, I noticed MANY empty plates. History has taught me that dining establishments and empty plates are a good sign. So they must be doing something right. 

Stay tuned. So far, so good. I think I have anoter Mountain King in the making. They&#39;re circling the wagons and the &#34;Famous One&#34; is about to go the route of General Custer and Lieutenant General Cornwallis. I&#39;d only say leave the Italian beef and the like alone. I never tried theirs, but when I go to a Mexican restaurant, I&#39;m not think about those foods."

Horrendous service even though it&#39;s not a full-service type of restaurant.  I survey their website prior to visiting the restaurant noting that they have a lunch special (not really as I later found out) in regards to a Torta w/ fries.  I wanted to confirm that their torta came with avocado as their site suggested.  The girl behind the counter gave me an accusatory look of &#34;no, you&#39;re full of crap trying to weasel free avocado.&#34;  Really!!! How can that be your attitude toward a first time customer!!!

Whatever, nbd, I guess.  So I asked for the Torta &#34;Lunch Special&#34; with avocado (1$ charge) clearly stating LUNCH SPECIAL.  She was obviously not aware of the lunch special and assume platter (beans and rice) and overcharged me.  I assumed that they do a torta lunch special to include fries instead of rice/beans because...the torta already contain beans.

Hopefully, their chicken tortas are not as bad as their other items.  Stringy bad tasting chicken on a torta that falls apart oh too easily.  Beans and rice were somehow disappointingly old tasting/bad as well.

I pulled up the site on my phone and showed it to the girl regarding both the special/avocada...of which instead of honestly owning up to her mistake, she gave me a BS spiel of store policy to change without notice.  Thanks, lying biznitch.  And no, this was not miscommunication.  She was perfectly fluent in english."

I made this aware to the waitress/cashier she reiterated to me that I ordered with extra beef and then after she at first didnt believe me I showed her that im eating chicken on my place which then. I waited another 30 min while to remade it. I didnt get some chips and salsa while a wait as a courtesy and after nearly an hour I finally got my food, and this time it was cut with a massive amount of cheese not extra beef. so if you go here just expect corner nowadays will be cut here and they make sure to nothing to make you visit welcoming when they make you wait forever for them to fix their mistakes.

The Chips and Guac was very good. We were excited that everything was going to follow suit. We were wrong. 

I actually enjoy hole in the wall Mexican food. I love a good late night run to El Burrito Mexicano in Lisle.  In my opinion, this is a step below that.
The fish taco was a product of the microwave. The chicken taco was full of brown meat. The steak was even a step below El Burrito&#39;s. The tamale was okay compared the the rest of our order.

One of us ordered a steak burrito....evidently ground sirloin is steak....we also ordered the combo platter....tostado, taco and tamale.   The tostado and taco were dumped on top of each other and as a result melded into one unappitizing lump....you couldn&#39;t tell one thing from the other.  The tamale was quite cooked enough.  The entire thing was blah.  We should have gone to Taco Bell...as bad as that is...its better than this stuff."

I have not had fish tacos since i was in Cabo San Lucas in May, 2011.I walked into the Jalapeno Grill not expecting to have fish tacos, but they were on the menu. I asked if I could get the fish tacos with the meal (rice and beans), and the cashier said yes. She then asked what type of fish would I like, tilapia or cod? I almost fell over. I  get my choice of fish??? I chose tilapia and they were the best fish tacos I have had in a very long time."

I normally do not like guacamole from restaurants, however, the guacamole from this place is amazing!  I actually think it is better then my homemade guacamole.  It is made fresh for each customer.  The chips are also fresh and hot!  The tacos are amazing, I love the cilantro on them.  The flan is also homemade by the owner and is delicious.  It&#39;s a great family owned restaurant! Very friendly service!"

They have only been open a week and half.  Cashier was friendly and helpful.  You can order your food for dine-in or to go.  Nice cafe type dining room but I took my food to go. My food was made fresh...I waited maybe 10 minutes tops.  They have a great menu, from breakfast to dinners....I wanted to order everything.  We settled on Burritos, Tamales, steak Tacos, beans, rice, Quesadillas and of course we HAD to have Guacamole &amp; chips.  The food was fresh, hot and delicious.  Portions were large enough for leftovers (lunch for work tomorrow)!  Can&#39;t wait to eat there again!!"

My expectation of having a great celebration had failed on very beginning. That day no one met us and welcomed to our table. I had 45 people waiting behind without a knowing where to invite my guests. As fact, no waiters that would know that as well. I went to office, bar and kitchen to find out where is our table, but unfortunately there was no person who would help. They kind of dissapeared. So I started to invite people for a our daughter pictures. I hoped that was first and last mistake and they took my request seriously to fix situation. NO WAY, IT DID NOT HAPPEN.
Additional cons:  
- no understading how to serve a rectangular tables for 18 people - we had 3 tables  ( middle part of the table was missing a 50% of all meals , they just filled left and right sides - unacceptable ) 
- no one served alcohol beverages except my HUSBAND ( I must ask for a tip for him, but about that later)
- hot food was given in very small amount. I did not get my potato and holubci because it was nothing on that plate. I asked for additional. They brought meal to wrong table. 



Last thing , PAYMENT !!!!!!!!!
You will BE FORCED to pay everything including GRATUITY of 19% (that was never discussed with us). 
Would anyone pay $931 gratuity for all above service? We tried to negotiate that  to 10% of gratuity, but NO WAY. OWNER SAID &#34; If you don&#39;t know how restaurant business work and you never been to any restaurant before, I want to let you know that , AUTOMATIC SERVICE FEE is NOT NEGOTIABLE&#34;. 
They call police and said we do not want to pay our bill, despite we refuse to pay only 9% of gratuity. 

 VERY BED EXPERIENCE."

It wasn&#39;t a typical pickled beet. It must have been baked then chilled and shredded. It was mild in flavor. All other food was great. I ordered the cabbage rolls and they were very good. Everyone else enjoyed their meal.
However... The service was slow and our server was absent for long periods of time when we needed something. I think their business is slow due to the fact they are new and the service is slow.
I would give them another chance
Because the food was so good."

We sat in the bar area for both lunch and dinner. Upscale potato pancakes are awesome. Stew with puff pastry and stuffed cabbage also excellent. We had prompt service from cheerful servers and enjoyed speaking with owner. Wished signage was mentioned Ukrainian cuisine/lunch/dinner for greater appeal. Try it!

The potato pancakes are served with sautéed mushrooms in between. The pancakes are very crisp and delicious. The pierogis are amazing as well and served with sour cream. I also ordered a cappuccino which is served with latte foam art on top. It is presented nicely, but it is not strong enough. As a vegetarian, I was glad to see that good vegetarian options are offered."
