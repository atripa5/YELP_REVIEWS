Employees are upbeat and friendly. This is a perfect lunch spot if you&#39;re out on the weekend or if you work downtown Naperville. My only suggestion would be to add some sound proofing to the ceiling or walls because the restaurant can get surprisingly loud despite its small size.

This popped up in my &#34;review this&#34; section and the question was &#34;what makes you keep coming back&#34;... The answer... VANILLA SHAKES.  The hands down, best shake I&#39;ve ever had and the only reason this place gets 2 stars. The best part about the shakes is that they are not overly sweet.  It has a pretty mild sweetness and the taste is unbelievable.

As for the subs.. yuck!"

My mom needed to use the bathroom.  I was thirsty, so I grabbed a Pellegrino out of the cooler and headed to the register.  There was a man in front of me paying for his order as I walked up.  He paid employee #1 and stood at the counter.  And waited.

And I waited.

Meanwhile, a lady walks up behind me and asks employee #2, at the other end of the counter, a question about peppers.  I don&#39;t know what happened, but she walked away.  Employees #1 and #2 then proceed to stand behind the counter.

The man continued to stand at the register, meal paid for.

Employees #1 and #2 look right at me.  Neither walk to the register.

I cock my head wondering when I&#39;ll get to pay for my water.

Employees #1 and #2 didn&#39;t make any sandwiches.  Looked around.

I put my water back in the cooler, met my mom back by the bathroom, and walked out.

The guy in front of me still didn&#39;t have his food when I left either.

Lame."

And yes, while it just a sandwich shop, the prices are fair--especially for the rich folk of downtown Naperville. Don&#39;t like the prices? Make your own sandwich. That&#39;s your solution.

So, yep, it&#39;s a sandwich shop. Personally, I&#39;ve never been disappointed with the quality of the food, and I eat here as much as 3 times a week. However, I&#39;ve pretty much only ever ordered the same thing: Italian on wheat with everything, cup of potato soup (or the next best thing if they don&#39;t have it), dream bar, and a Dr. Pepper. It&#39;s amazing I&#39;m not obese. Again, the food always hits the spot. I find the soft drink selection very odd, as they carry Coke, Pepsi, Dr. Pepper, and the diet versions of those drinks. Oh, and Mountain Dew. Perhaps consider replacing the fountain machine lemonade with a caffeine-free option like sprite, and then offering fresh-squeezed lemonade. If we&#39;re trying to please everyone, that is. 

My other suggestion would be to get some bags with handles for Christ&#39;s sake. It&#39;s a struggle trying to take my order to go, as I hold my sandwich bag between my teeth and my dream bar becoming mush in my pocket. I think it should be common sense to offer me a bag if I&#39;m balancing soup on my head because I didn&#39;t bring enough hands. And even when I ask for a bag, it doesn&#39;t have handles! What kind of dumb bag doesn&#39;t have handles? And just forget about ordering to-go for multiple people. &#34;Nose goes!&#34;

All minor details, but one thing I will say is that my experience is determined by the staff. Most often, these sandwich artistes are very pleasant and friendly. But every once in a while, I have to deal with some super rude employee who is having side conversations instead of taking my order, finishing text messages before ringing me up for my food, and just generally being not helpful, not polite, and not fun to deal with. It&#39;s the same girl that I have a problem with every time; she needs to learn some basic customer service skills, like how to greet guests and the like. I know she&#39;s not new, so there is no excuse. It&#39;s a pretty lax atmosphere, and hopefully she doesn&#39;t ruin that for the rest of the awesome employees because she can&#39;t follow simple customer service guidelines.

Other than that, the live music is a huge bonus. There was some older gentleman performing a couple weeks ago who I just adored. All of the musicians I&#39;ve heard here have been very talented. The live music is a nice touch for sure."

Delicious and fast sandwiches. Great soup options (though they never have the tomato soup often enough IMO). Great ice cream treats if you feel up to a great dessert, but I always get the mint green tea from the cooler.

I get the veggie sandwich... a normally succulent and tasty sandwich but not at this location. Burn my bread, get more cheese on the outside of the sandwich than inside, and give me 2 slices of canned mushrooms. Will that be all? Sure, since you already wrapped up my sandwich... I wouldn&#39;t want you to have to go through the trouble of opening the wax paper that&#39;s covered in the cheese that&#39;s not actually on my sandwich to put an extra ingredient on there. Forget it. I&#39;ll choke it down. 

Really, I can&#39;t blame the staff. They all appear to be 15 and I don&#39;t mean that in a bad way, it&#39;s just that everyone is VERY young. Possibly there on their work permit for high school credit. They are nice and attractive kids but they are kids. I respect them going out and getting jobs but there needs to be an adult figure there... at least to manage. If there is an adult manager there, I would recommend them making their presence known. Right now, this location has a severe issue with punk ass Jr high and high school kids slumming around, not buying anything, just being loud and obnoxious and quite obviously making customers and the young staff uncomfortable and I understand how the young staff would not be so quick to scold people their own age in a large group of friends. 

Someone please help this location! It needs some more management and an authority figure."

Extremely disappointed and disgusted with the service. What started out as a nice quick lunch with my husband and baby quickly turned into a terrible day out thanks to Brittany the unfriendly cashier/manager. He simply asked for a pickle as he was paying for his lunch and Brittany automatically gave him attitude saying he should have ordered it with his sandwhich and then proceeded with hand gestures to show that its obvious not here with her and now he needs to step aside and wait for it. Are you freaking kidding me?! If you&#39;ve been to Potbellies you&#39;d know that the sandwich station is an arms length away and a quick holler for the damn pickle would have solved the issue but miss Brittany wanted to make it more of an issue than it was. There is no need for hand gestures, attitude or for my husband to step aside since there were no customers waiting in line behind him to pay!! My husband is a very low key guy but was really affected by Brittany&#39;s attitude that he was shaken with anger. No one deserves that kind of treatment ever. We were so upset that we couldn&#39;t even finish our sandwich there. I contacted corporate. Their response was quick. Offered a gift card. Sure. A month later, nothing.

Our subs were good... not the best ever, but decent. I would still say that Quiznos reigns in the sandwich department for a chain restaurant.

My only complaints are they do not have avocado (but no one seems to have avocado in Chicago).  I found the peppers too hot, but easy to pick off  (I turned into weakling with spices after having the toddler) and the potato salad is very mayo based (my sister claims that is how Midwestern potato salad is made).

Later on we noticed the buddy&#39;s of the bouncer showed up after about two hours of us enjoying our food, drink and seats.  One of his Buddy&#39;s was past holding his head up (drunk) but both of them decided to sit at our table which had a few extra chairs just like many other tables in the bar!  So while we were dancing and we came back and he was laying his head on our table. Geeze!

After a few songs he did not move his head and I asked his friend to find a different table and he was upset but polite and moved right away!  His friend was not drunk but told the bouncer something!  I then was asked by their friend (the bouncer) to what was up with them being asked to move from my table and i explained the situation.  He then began to push me toward the door and asked me to leave and I said why?

He said I was being rude all night to others and suggested I leave and said to whom but said I will leave when my girl gets back from the bathroom as I have no desire for this behavior.  yep he was backing them (his friends whom did a shot with him) then allows them to sit at my table and was kicking me out!  WOW

I guess being there to long maybe ( after our (88.00 tab) and a good tip and then while waiting for my girl he tried to head lock me and move me out on the building, (really)  
I moved out of this bouncers attempted head lock, but my glasses were ripped off from his grasping of my head and are now gone and my girlfriend was still inside. I tried to wait and to video his crap (available to mgmt.) as he grabbed at my phone.  The food was ok here, music ok,  but this bouncer has no right!  $300.00 glasses!

What an A and WHAT a D! He also ran out front of the building when I was forced out and he was yelling get out of here you Faggot!  

I expect more racial slurs by mr. no class to others and know how he really feels.  Also, a neighboring tenant observed this from the bar and outside as I met him and he was asking what happened along with his girl.  I have his name and number too.

 NEVER GO HERE IS ON MY LIST, What an asshole.  I&#39;d say try Emmett&#39;s , Another round or Mia&#39;s for good food and the cellar for ambiance and NO bullshit from a bouncer with attitude.

Came to see friends band play and have dinner.  These people have never been to a real pub in Ireland cause this is not what one&#39;s like.

Started off with a draught beer that was so flat the keg must have been tapped months ago.

Next came a truly disgusting deep fried corned beef and creamed cheese appetizer called a corned beef bite.  Looked like hush puppies but tasted like sweet creamed cheese mixed with completely tasteless corned beef. Yuck!

Wow,  I didn&#39;t think you could manage to screw up fish and chips but this place did.  The small portion of frozen cod came in square chunks instead of the traditional slabs you normally see.  Super oily tasteless breading combined with a bizarre overly sweet tartar sauce completed the disaster.  The fries were not chips but American fries coated in something sweet.  Must everything here be sweet?  I used mustard to eat the stuff.

Finally the stage for the band is in the middle of the bar room and faces the bar. For some reason it&#39;s 3 feet or better off the floor (too high) and only 10 feet from the bar making it impossible to enjoy anyone performing unless they are sitting down.

The whole place is divided up into little rooms with hard seating that&#39;s falling apart and two-top tables that are literally 15&#34; wide by 24&#34; long.  Too loud, too flat, too sweet, too expensive....  avoid this place like the plague."

We shared the reuben.  The sandwich itself was great, but I was a little disappointed that the fries were not traditional Irish chips, but were smaller instead.  We also shared a cup of seafood chowder, which had a lovely seafood-y broth reminiscent of Galway chowder (but of course not quite that good).  

The band that night took FOREVER to start, they were noodling for a good hour, which was annoying.  I&#39;ll have to come back and actually plan to see a band."

My husband and I went here because we were in the mood for chicken pot pies and we figured that a place that priced theirs at $15.99 would be really good. WRONG! We walked in on a Sunday and it said seat yourself. After walking through the sea of people and closely placed tables we sat at one of the tall tables close to the bar. The table looked like it was made out of a wooden barrel which made it very uncomfortable to sit because there was no place to put your legs. It took the waiter a while to approach us with menus and take our drinks. I ordered a peach iced tea which was just iced tea with warm peach syrup in it. My husband received a flat Coke.  When he came back to our section he took the order of the people who came in after us. The waiter didn&#39;t check up on us until it was time for the check then it took 10 minutes for him to come pick up the check. I am usually a very good tipper but this waiter got one of the worst tips I have ever given. 

We ordered the mac and cheese bites and two chicken pot pies. The mac and cheese bites were decent but they were clearly just fried Kraft mac and cheese balls with Kraft ranch dressing. Definitely not worth the $8.99. Now onto the chicken pot pies. It was not anything like a pot pie. A true pot pie has a bottom crust and a top crust. There was no crust just a puff of fillo dough that was tasteless. The chicken had these weird brown &#34;grill&#34; marks on it reminiscent of the packaged chicken from Aldi. The veggies were obviously from frozen and the sauce canned. So basically they just heated everything up and put it in a bowl then threw the fillo dough on top. I know this because it only took them less then 10 minutes to cook it  when a traditional pot pie would take at least twice that much time. 

Overall we paid $50 for this crappy meal and was out in a half hour. If I am paying that much for a meal I want a enjoyable experience which we did not get. 
I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had eating out. I am so disappointed I wasted my date night with my husband on this place."

This place hasn&#39;t seen one renovation since opening other than a 5ft bar extension to house more whiskey. The person who designed the bar top should be taken out back and beat. There is a barrier every foot and a half on the bar top so you have to lean back to talk to people, dumbest thing I&#39;ve ever seen. The food is basic bar food, deep fried and not fresh, and for an Irish place the corn beef is bad. This place stays in business because it books local bands on weekends. 

It&#39;s an Irish themed college band bar. You&#39;re better off next door at the sports bar."

It&#39;s also the night before Christmas Eve.  This isn&#39;t a library.  This is a BAR.  Seriously.  Who the fuck SHUSHES people?  I get it, you like trivia, and you want to hear the host.  Your expectations get flushed down the toilet the evening prior to a holiday.  Don&#39;t shush people in a BAR.  EVER.

For several years, a group of my friends has done a bar crawl the eve of Christmas Eve.  I knew it would happen gradually:  we got married.  we had children.  The children are the perfect scapegoat for introverted personalities, a lack of desire to &#34;party,&#34; and a desire to be in bed before midnight.  So, we all decided to hang out at Ballydoyle&#39;s instead of the typical bar crawl.

I love the hot drinks like the Peppermint Patty and Nutty Irishman.  I wasn&#39;t feeling 100%, had a nasty cough, but still wanted to hang out.  These drinks helped me make it through the night.  The waitress also kept the water flowing, which I desperately needed in-between drinks.

My friends ordered the Irish Nachos, which were powdered with some mystic, delicious, mouthwatering substance.  The chips were house made potato chips, cut thick and fried to crispy, crunchy perfection.  The blue cheese dipping sauce was equally tasty.

I had the fish &amp; chips for dinner.  It was okay, but the fish was definitely bland.  The batter was nice and crunchy though.

It was definitely a busy night, we had some trouble securing tables for our group as it got later.  It did take awhile to get drinks, but our server did a great job splitting up checks, remembering people&#39;s drink orders, and getting the right things to the right people.

Ballydoyle&#39;s is just okay for me.  Nothing stands out about it, but it&#39;s a nice place to get a group together to chat, drink, and catch up before the holidays.

Avoid on Tuesdays."

The Hubs said his sandwich was &#34;eh, okay, I guess.&#34; My flatbread pizza had a crust so soft it was like eating pizza toppings over a soft pita - not flatbread pizza quality at all with not even a hint of crispness.  They certainly piled on the toppings to my flatbread but because of the crust condition I ended up either knife &amp; forking it or folding over each slice to eat it like a little pita sandwich."

She was just as horrified as we were and very understanding. She comped our drinks, sent the food back and continuously apologized.

DG&#39;s Ballydoyle&#39;s has an odd layout.  The architect isn&#39;t going to win any awards for his work here, but let&#39;s get to what matters..food and drinks.

I like BD&#39;s menu even though I stray from the Irish favorites.  I&#39;m a sandwich guy and their menu has 6-8 really nice selections including an avocado chicken sandwich that I prefer.  Very tasty.

You&#39;re not going to be slighted here no matter what you like to drink.  They have an extensive beer menu (around 100 choices) plus a full whiskey menu to put the starch in your linen.  I&#39;m usually down for whiskey but I had to drive work colleagues, so I went with a few cans of Revolution Eugene instead.  It&#39;s one of Chicagoland&#39;s finest home brewed porters in my opinion. 

To wrap it up our table of ten ordered a few &#39;bags of donuts&#39;.  These suckers are enough to pop a button on your dress shirt, and awfully damn good.  

We had great service despite the fact that they don&#39;t really take reservations.  
I&#39;m at 3 1/2 stars here....but not quite 4.

This place is the BEST that I have discovered in over two freakin&#39; years!!! Hands down has the best corned beef sandwich Ive had in my LIFE. If it was a woman I would marry it. 
The Guinness stew is the BEST Ive ever had. If I was married to the corned beef then this would be my mistress. 

When people come from out of town this is where Im taking them, not a pizza place and that says a whole hell of a lot. The atmosphere I dont think could be better. Its a TRUE Irish pub from the decor to the music to the bartender to the red headed waitress. (with plaid skirt.... giggity) 

The whiskey and whisky selections are HUGE. The beer selection is enormous and what a great selection it is! 

The pricing? For Lunch the value is EXCELLENT! $6 for a choice of two dishes out of 12!  For dinner the value is still great for the food. Add a few drinks and they will vacuum the money out of your wallet (just like any other pub)  BUT the drinks are quality. Youre really getting the best here. 

Bottom line is if you dont try this place at least once youre not getting into heaven. Dont even bother going to church anymore."

I didn&#39;t stay for the entire duration of Trivia Night, but what I saw was entertaining.

Food wasn&#39;t too impressive.

The bartender and servers were arguing because servers were screwing up bringing drinks to the wrong people. Fortunately, I was seated at the bar and so the bartender knew exactly what to give me."

The service has generally been the issue. Short staffed generally.
Tonight by far was the worst experience. We got there around 5:45pm. Thursday night. Gorgeous outside. Many people walking about. And it was Dinner time! There was 4 of us.
Our server who appeared to be on her own managing tables inside AND out was polite and took our drink requests. They came in within 10 minutes. Then to save on time we placed an appetizer when we placed our entrees. Our chips with blue cheese came and they were delicious. But then this is where it spirals out of control.
We wait. And wait. And wait. Finally around 1 hour from the time we placed the order a very overworked and apologizing server tells us the kitchen LOST our order!!!! WHAT!?!?!?!
She takes our order... Again. And we have to wait. We should have left. Our server then tells us they will take 2 of the entrees off our bill. What???? We did not lose our order. Why should anyone have to pay for meals that were lost by staff? And make people now wait nearly 1.5 hrs for their meals?
As we are waiting and waiting tables around us are also looking around looking for our server. One table had been waiting for nearly 20 minutes when finally another server came over and took their order.
As we were leaving we noticed on the front door that they are looking for servers, dishwashers... Looks like this place needs help. When we left the place was packed. And under staffed. Our server handled this as best she could. But this is not how to treat paying customers.
The bill that was presented, after 2 entrees were taken off was still $50!!! For 4 beers, chips and 2 $8 entrees we will not be coming back after the service and finally after another order was taken  a total of 2 hours to get our food.
Please Ballydoyle address this. Please staff accordingly for a dinner night. A band was appearing as well to play. Yikes!!!"

Flash back a week and a half ago - I called and asked if they took dinner reservations, the guy who answered was NOT at all friendly...even after I told him I was bringing in a large party for my birthday.  Then I asked what time they start charging cover for the band - he said around 8pm.  I had a group coming out for my birthday party so I needed to know these things.  I&#39;m also friends with the band, so I was coming to celebrate w/ them as well.

I&#39;ve been here a few times before and they NEVER charged a cover to see this band so ok, I get it...they bring in a crowd, let&#39;s charge them but we arrived at 7pm and they were ALREADY charging.  Most places don&#39;t charge if you&#39;re coming in for dinner that early - double, the cover and your meal but I guess this place does now.  The guy at the door was nice enough to let me in free as I was the birthday girl.  We were told that if we left before the band started we&#39;d get our cover back.  Lame.

The place was jammed packed but kudos to our waitress Claudia who did her best to accomodate us all night, this included separate bills for everyone which was extremely helpful!!! She gets the rave review here...

A friend of mine stepped outside the bar at some point (it was quite hot in there) and saw that the door guy was letting people in for FREE saying, just keep going... without charging.

At the end of the night as the place was pretty much cleared out we noticed one minute the leftover birthday cake we brought in was at our table, the next minute it was gone...no one seemed to know where it went.  It ended up on the ground outside the door.  Not to say the bar is to blame here but really????

The food is good here, the service is great but I was not impressed by the rest of this place.  I&#39;ll probably come back to support my friend&#39;s band, but not for this place because I&#39;m a fan of it."

I&#39;d heard all the raves over the corned beef, but tonight we were only there to enjoy the beautiful weather and celebrate hubby&#39;s birthday.  (He&#39;d already accommodated me with a sangria from across the street...now it was beer time!)
We found a table outside and waited...and waited and waited.  After 15 minutes of no one coming by, even to say &#34;I&#39;ll be with you in a few minutes&#34; we decided to try Emmett&#39;s...knowing that they had a patio.   Well their patio was filled, so we came back to Ballydoyle to give it another try.  Hubby went straight to the bar this timewhileiwent  back to the same table we had previously occupied.  At this point, a busy waitress in a leg brace apologized as she went by.  The next time she came by, she asked if we wanted menus, but I explained that he was just going to order from the bar.   
Little did I know what was taking place at the bar!   
Apparently, my husband had asked a waitress if it was always this slow on a Tues. night.  They had a bit of a conversation and she then directed him to order from the bartender- who was at the other end of the bar during their conversation...CLUELESS as to what they discussed.  
Then the bartender proceeded to rush over to him and ask, in a pissed off voice, if my husband had an &#34;issue&#34; with the service.   He became extremely rude and antagonizing toward my husband.  When my husband replied that it was no way to treat his customers, the bartender then replied that he didn&#39;t &#34;need to be a customer&#34;.  
So we left.  Nothing like being a douche bag!"

We came on a Friday night around 8 and were charged cover (weird since music didn&#39;t start til 10 BUT we did get our cover back since we only ate!!)

The ambiance is neat with the curtains and old-fashion vibe it has going on. We sat at a high top table overlooking the band stage area. The only weird part is that the people behind us (which were behind a half wall) felt very close. But we didn&#39;t seem to be bothered by each other&#39;s conversations.

I ordered the bangers &#39;n mash- a personal fav. I liked it. It wasn&#39;t anything special but it was good since I was starving. I tried some of the corned beef and rye which was very tasty and the fish &#39;n chips looked good bu I don&#39;t like fish. My only issue was the brew. They have loads of draft and bottled, but only one cider. And not even an English or Irish cider. Kinda bummed me out since I love me some cider.

I want to come back on a night where they have the Irish step dancers and enjoy some Irish music and try something different.."

We were seated in a fairly empty room. I noticed that as more people were seated for the rest of the night, we were the last of everyone there to get served, even though we were first to arrive. It took over half an hour for us to get drinks, another half hour to get our orders in, and about forty minutes after we finished eating before our waitress came back with our bills. My boyfriend and I were there with our three friends for a nostalgic night out as we used to go to the Ballydoyle&#39;s in Stratford before they closed down. The service there was slow as well, but this was excruciatingly painful. I tried to flag my waitress down plenty of times, but she&#39;d never make eye contact with me. It was hard to see a party of ten get in their orders and food before we even got our orders in. Never returning, no matter how cheap wings are on Thursdays."

I&#39;m sorry the Irish have great brogues, fun dances and tragic poets but food?  Please!  

I was actually surprised, I liked my food quite a bit.  I had the Irishman burger which had bacon, cream cheese, lettuce, tomato, and was topped with a fried egg.  I love it when something has an egg plopped on top of it.  I particularly like it on sandwiches and pizza.  It&#39;s great!  I had the homemade chips instead of fries and they were really loud, like embarrassingly loud to crunch into and the taste, meh.  

For dessert we split the Profiteroles, I know, French dessert in an Irish pub.  Pretty darn good pastry shell and awesome molten chocolate on top.  Paired with coffee, we were satisfied and ready for our library adventure.

The service was very slow to start, my friend had to go looking for them, and it was slow and spotty but very nice and friendly.

I would come back but hey, I love eggs plopped on things!"

We walked in, the sign said seat yourself.  We grabbed a couple of menus and did just that ... seated ourselves.  Now, if you want to sit for about 10 minutes in a restaurant without anyone &#34;working&#34; and with only a few other customers at tables, show up shortly before 5:00 on a Wednesday.  You will find a bartender or two (I think they were bartenders since they hung out behind the bar) and maybe a waitress or two flying by in the distance going from there to elsewhere, but nowhere near your table.  Ahhhh ... the tables. 

If you are tall, there is no way to sit at a table comfortably.  Your only other choice is to sit at the tall &#34;sports bar&#34;  tables.  All the chairs and tables seem a bit rickety, and uncomfortable  for the tall person.  Getting a good drunk on would ease the pain and that would be easy to do with the vast number of drink choices which includes a very good beer selection.  The atmosphere is beat up furnishings, sports bar, pub ... good for a drinking party.  No live  music playing when we were there.

After 10 minutes or so, a bartender(?) was walking through the restaurant.  I waved my arms hoping to get noticed in this nearly empty restaurant.  I did.  The nice man came over, took our drink orders and said he would find us a waitress.  A few minutes later, the waitress, with our beers, made it to the table.  Fantastic.  Before she was able to run off, we placed our food orders, the Shepherd&#39;s Pie for my wife and the Beef and Guinness Stew for me.

It wasn&#39;t long before the food arrived.  My wife gives the pie 3 1/2 stars.  My stew was closer to 2 1/2 stars.  The stew, while tasting good  wasn&#39;t as warm as it could have been.  I wonder if it&#39;s been kept warm in a pot that has been sitting around all day.  A little extra heat  before serving would have been nice. Still, I liked it.

The service was friendly and good once we had a waitress.  The prices are good.   Yet,  I will not be rushing to get back here, mainly because of the uncomfortable seating."

We were seated outside (weather was nice) and the waitress took forever to just take a drink order.  When she finally decided to pry herself away from her friends at another table; we asked her for a menu since we were so hungry.  We waited, and waited, and waited.......  Probably fifteen minutes later she returned with the beers and waters but forgot the menus!!!!  What an airhead.  So rather than apologize and return with menus swiftly; she disappeared again....  Next we find her yacking it up with her friends at the same table as before.  She acted as if we were inconveniencing the most important person in the world.  Sorry dotsy, serving the customer is your friggin&#39; job!!  So she throws the menus down on the table and she disappears again.  That was it.  We see her again hanging out with her friends at the same table so when she finally decides to come over; we just asked for our check so we could leave and go to a place that actually wants to move with a sense of urgency on anything.....  We ended up going across the street to Emmett&#39;s who actually has decent customer service.  I hate going to restaurants where servers have bad attitudes and after being a loyal customer for years; I have to accept the fact that Ballydoyle&#39;s servers have no idea on good customer service; only sh*t service which dovetails into their ambiance of a mildewed, black molded bar scent."

 The atmosphere of this pub is very &#39;Irish&#39; (just like the name says), so is the interior of the place. I love it. The beer they offer is Irish as well but they have different options for everyone. The prices are normal, nothing too expensive or nothing very cheap that is extraordinary. One thing I must say is that the people who come here are very polite and have manners. I have never experienced a brawl here and that is what I like. 
The staff is very welcoming and nice as well.  For a pub I think it meets all the suburban standards and is considered one of the best on my list at least. They also have an outside area which is pretty nice."

With that said, the pot roast boxty really is like you can make at home... I expected a little more from it after eating the steak boxty (which is so yummy!).  We also went to eat fried fish one day, and it was super oily (not sure if it was a one-time thing, but totally do not recommend the fried fish).  Oh well, not everything can be a surprise adventure. Other than the steak boxty I&#39;d really recommend the sweet potato tots and the Brat Duo (oh man... the chipotle lime brat and the blue cheese brat are surprisingly amaze-balls good!). 

Service has always been really good every time we visit.  The variety of beers are nice, and the mixed drinks are yummy (do try the fruity thing with blueberries... can&#39;t remember what it was called, but that was pretty good).  If you&#39;re looking for fancy pants food, don&#39;t come here. If you&#39;re looking for homey Irish food and a good drink and good vibes, totally come here.

One shining star was the Irish chips with bleu cheese sauce. When I heard there was a location in Aurora, I was thrilled. But that location always lacked something in the atmosphere and the food. It never lived up to this location.

So Friday I decided to come back and I&#39;m so glad I did. Of course, I ordered the chips. So simple, yet so perfect. With a side of bleu cheese, the chips were as good as I remember them. Along with a Guinness and Guinness BBQ sandwich, it made for a perfect way to cap off a hard work week.

I love the atmosphere in here as well. Patrons are laughing, the staff is friendly and even a guy on stage playing a guitar. What&#39;s not to love about that? 

And did I mention a Jameson whiskey flight for $18??? Hmmm.

I&#39;m so happy I gave this place another try and I will be back in the future.

It&#39;s located a few minutes walk south of the Main St. Metra station, so it&#39;s an easy haul if you&#39;re arriving via that route. If you&#39;re driving there, your best bet is the parking garage which is pretty much located behind the place and free during evening hours.

The food and drink here are OK -- nothing to rave about but not bad at all, either. I had dinner here with a friend shortly before moving out of the area and had a Reuben sandwich with a side salad, washed down with a couple of Harps. The service here was A-OK as well.

Outdoor seating (which we had) is available when the weather favors it, although it&#39;s located alongside a busy walkway and can be annoying when you have a bunch of out of control kids running around, as was the case when we were there.

I learned I should have stuck with the expected because this type of cuisine is not the strong suit of this restaurant.

In the past times I&#39;ve visited, I&#39;ve had a burger-beer + house made chips for lunch or dinner because this casual joint has one of the largest outdoor patios in downtown Downers Grove that is fitting for lounging and snacking on traditional bar food. However, in the past year, I&#39;ve noticed a redesigned menu with an upgraded selection, so I wanted to give these new choices a chance. 

Unfortunately, the tuna was very dry and overcooked with way too much salt and not enough depth of flavor or spice in the crust. Not to mention, the menu description alluded to more of sandwich, which ended up being cooked chunks of tuna on top of lettuce leafs and tomato with a lackluster cashew coleslaw. 

The coleslaw was the most disappointing part of the meal with the whole cashews that should have been chopped to blend better textually with the lettuce. The lettuce was a bit wilted and not at all green. There was  bit of color from the carrot matchsticks, but no purple from radicchio or lettuce that would have added more bright pops in flat mix."

Most of the places you go only care about the beer, booze, and bands.  This place of course cares about that, but they also have some excellent chefs on board.  

Favorites of mine are the &#34;Dinny&#39;s Irish Fry&#34; which is probably the best breakfast I have ever had.  Bacon, eggs, black and white &#34;pudding&#34; and bangers.  The sausages are perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of spice... heaven.

Next would be their &#34;Corned Beef and Cabbage&#34; .  It&#39;s a meal I love to eat.  Comfort food at it&#39;s best.  Being a standard for most Irish pubs, the ballydoyle&#39;s owner explained to me that they differentiate themselves by roasting the meat for 9 hours instead of boiling the beef.  Hi grandma&#39;s recipe.  The result?  The most tender, succulent  wedge of corned beef that you will ever eat.  My one criticism, is that it could use a little more spiciness, especially in the cabbage.  Otherwise it is perfect!

If neither of those meals appeals to you try the many boxtys (stuffed potato pancakes) or the fish and chips.  They are all excellent.

Finally, I should mention the pub&#39;s support to local Irish Dancing.  If your children wish to learn the art, they can receive lessons at the pub from the McNulty school and I think from Trinity Academy.  They also open their stage to Irish Dance performances from these schools during their St Patrick&#39;s celebrations.  We were lucky enough to see one March 12th where children from 6 to 17 were dancing in their glittering costumes to the great applause of a very crowded and lively pub."

Good food, good Guiness but I&#39;m not crazy about the layout.  It gets way too packed on the weekends and if your not there early you&#39;ll have to stand all night and it gets stuffy too.

First of all, the place is HUGE and pretty rad on the inside.  The decor is very homey and lovely.  The beer list is pretty dece and they have some yummy irish whiskeys.. and irish whiskey is delish!!

I&#39;ve always had really good service here and there are always good bands to watch while you&#39;re drinking away.  I also love the fact that they have team trivia and outdoor dining.. two of my favorite things ever.

Now, for the food. FINALLY, I had something to eat.  They had fried pickles on their special menu, and they were grrrrreat! Fried pickle spears are better than the chips and Ballydoyle didn&#39;t let me down.  I also ordered a burger which, maybe wasn&#39;t the best option.  I probably should have went more irish and I probably would have been more satisfied.. it was just ok.  My boyfriend had the Boxty though, and loved it! He loves is tato pancakes so much.  I had a few bites.. it was pretty damn good.

Overall, I like the place.. good vibes, dece drinks, dece foodies, dece entertainment.. And at a reasonable price."

I love this place.  Not only do they have a pretty decent selection of beers, they have GLUTEN FREE beer as well! They have 2 different New Planets plus Original Sin Cider.  I was a very happy girl!  I also noticed a couple Two Bros, Stone &amp; Lagunitas. I&#39;d probably be all over that if I wasn&#39;t in a love/hate relationship with wheat. Oh, and when I was there they had hop juice.  HELLLOOO!!! I&#39;m a fan of anywhere with hop juice. 

The food at this place is also pretty awesome!  Now, I know I just was uber excited about the wheat free beer, but I cheat with wheat for the right reasons.  One of those reasons being fried pickles! Love them! And they&#39;re great here.  I&#39;ve never had this, but my friends rave about the chicken pot pie. It looks good! Comes in a bowl, with puff pastry on top.  

I&#39;m also a fan of their outdoor area.  It&#39;s small, but I&#39;ve never seen it crazy busy outside before.  I&#39;m usually inside near the stage when I&#39;m there, and I will say it&#39;s pretty hard to get a table or bar stool right there.  So if you want to sit and watch a band, I suggest getting there early! 

This place is great to take the fam for dinner, as that was my first experience there.  But also a great time to hang out with friends and have a few good drinks &amp; food!"

Food was good (I had the beef stroganoff) but our waiter had no clue what an IPA or hoppy beer was. He suggested several and brought tastes that were not IPAs, not hoppy, and just lame.

They failed again. How can you have no hostess, with a sign up asking guests to seat themselves, during the holiday madness, at prime dinner time? 

There were families &amp; people just hovering over tables that were trying to eat. There are multiple rooms, so people waiting the longest might miss a table that opened up because they were in the wrong spot at the wrong time. This is where a host station would come in handy to help organize &amp; seat the restaurant efficiently. 

The service was all rushed &amp; flustered as well. My friend ordered chicken &amp; was served corned beef instead. I had almost finished my meal by the time she got what she had actually ordered. Not a single apology offered about the mix-up either. 

The only reason I am giving 2 stars is: one for the decor &amp; the other for the nostalgia. I have a lot of great memories here from when it used to be great!"

Part of our group had been in Ireland and so were really excited about the food choices. Most of the group are beer connoisseurs and they loved the options and the temperature and taste of all the different beers everyone tried.

The decor is TOTALLY cool. Tons of wood and character- so much to look at. It is worth coming here just for the atmosphere.

Our server was great- she handled our large group very well and was friendly and timely. 

The food was very good- everyone was happy with what they ordered and I think every bite was finished! 

I&#39;ve heard awesome things about the music but have yet to experience it myself. Next time we&#39;ll come on a night they have a band, and I&#39;ll try dessert- they sound great!"

There is a lot of space around the bar, so it was easy for our group to keep growing.

The waitress and bartender both seemed nice.

One of the guys got nachos, and they are a massive plate of nachos!  Great for sharing!

I had a grilled chicken sandwich for dinner, and it was great.  The fries were decent, so no complaints for me.  A couple of us split the brownie volcano Sunday, and I was a little disappointed with it.  (Not too disappointed though, since it was still good).  It just seemed like there was way more whipped cream than anything else.  But the brownie underneath all of the whipped cream was delicious!  This would be an incredible desert if there was a little more brownie and/or a little less whipped cream."

Recently spent an afternoon here and loved it.  I say afternoon, because it was more than just lunch.   We lingered here for a while, tasting all the beers and comparing our food babies after the giant meal. 

First off, I have to say I was really surprised.  I expected regular bar food with an Irish twist.  Like Irish burgers, whatever the heck that is.  But this place has some really interesting stuff. 

Take the Corned Beef Bites for example.  It&#39;s as unhealthy as sucking down fat with a straw but it tastes so damn good you&#39;ll forget about the damage to your arteries in a single bite!   I&#39;m also a fan of the Boxty.  The Steak Boxty to be precise.  It was huge, filling and tasted great.  Steak, cheese, potatoes, green onions are all good things to have, especially when you have &#39;em all at once.

Drinks...well that&#39;s basically what you make of it.  But I&#39;m glad they had some of my favorites - Summer Shandy and Hoegaarden.  Loved it!   We sat outside, the weather was perfect and the service here was good.

Overall I&#39;m a fan!"

The DG location is no exception!  I love April when she is our server, so I can&#39;t complain that I don&#39;t get service with a smile when she&#39;s around!  My problem is usually with the tab and the food.  The food is just ok.  It has gone downhill significantly over the years along with the clientele (we&#39;ll get back to them).  When Phil began focusing on the new locations he lost focus here.  The prices went up and the quality went way down!  I&#39;d really rather spend my money somewhere else for better quality food.

I&#39;m friends with a couple of bands.  A few of us end up assisting with set up most of the time.  We&#39;ve been to BD in DG countless times for their gigs.  We&#39;ve had issues with the clientele that is coming off the trains over the past few years.  I&#39;m not talking about the DG townies so much as the pub crawlers that creep off the trains and make BD their last stop for the night.  In past incidents, drunkards have attempted to pick up and toss both band and bar equipment.  They&#39;ve also attempted to climb on stage and grab the band members.  Luckily, we always bring our own &#34;bouncers.&#34;  They&#39;ve saved every piece of equipment and prevented harm from coming to our friends on stage.  The unfortunate part is that the bar&#39;s bouncers have not done their part to assist.  On one occasion BD&#39;s bouncers kicked out a couple of girls only after they picked up the bar&#39;s subwoofer and tried to throw it into the dancing crowd.  We were the ones to take the said subwoofer out of their hands and ask them to back away from the stage.  Ten minutes later the bouncers let them back into the bar.  They were in no condition to walk let alone be in a bar being served more drinks!

There are definitely other places to go if you&#39;re looking for quality Irish food at a reasonable price!"

Also, Tuesday night is Trivia Night.

We sat ourselves at a high top just outside the bar area. The stools were seriously uncomfortable. They were uneven (kept rocking back and forth throughout dinner), and there wasn&#39;t a bar for me to rest my feet on, so my legs kept falling asleep!

Our server was nice; not too attentive, not a stranger. Food came out hot and quickly. She refilled my water and my boyfriends beer at comfortable times.

You really can&#39;t go wrong with a $9.75 bill for splitting 4 burgers, 2 baskets of fries, one beer and two waters! Seriously! That&#39;s a steal!

I wish Trivia started earlier (she said it gets started around 9:30 or so, which is a little late for a work night).

Decent atmosphere.

We will go back just for the decent prices and location."

I never got sick eating there so that is a very good sign. Even though I&#39;m a vegetarian, I was able to find good things to eat. The hard apple cider they sell is first rate. I definitely recommend getting it. They only sell one brand so don&#39;t ask me which one. I love their decor and I&#39;m always looking around as if I&#39;m at a museum. The waitresses wear super short skirts so if you&#39;re lucky guys you might get a glimpse of their poo poo undies. None the less they still look good. Their over all customer service is OK. I have a feeling they may be over worked. I&#39;m not sure but that is my hunch. The last waiter who served us was very laid back. He smelled really good, like burning leaves in the fall. And every time he came by I felt a slight buzz and extremely hungry when he left.  Was I in love you ask? No, but I certainly had this overwhelming urge to roll him up in paper and smoke him. 
They have really good bands playing every now and then. I definitely recommend this place for drinks and light entertainment. Especially if that nice smelling waiter is serving."

The place is split into a restaurant side and a bar side; the bar side was full of people for a Halloween event, and since I wanted to dine I went the other way. It appears that there is a hostess stand, so I was waiting to be seated, but an exasperated-seeming waitress had difficulty communicating that it&#39;s a seat-yourself situation. (Seriously, why not a sign?)

Tables of all sizes and heights are strewn about the room. The one i chose unfortunately had a drop under the tabletop so it made it very hard to jam my knees underneath; maybe someone shorter would not have the same problem. The dining room was pretty busy for a weeknight. 

My waitress was nicer than the initial one I&#39;d encountered, and I placed my order quickly. Wasn&#39;t too thrilled with the food, though. The cream of potato soup came with some super-salty croutons on top that tainted the rest even when I fished them out. I find it wrong that an Irish pub should screw up potato soup. 

The Prince Edward Island mussels that I got for my main course swam in a thin sauce of cream and a LOT of herbs (could have done with less of the latter), though the mussels themselves were alright in texture and degree of doneness. 

Overall, just a &#34;meh&#34; meal, and nothing stood out about the atmosphere to make me want to return. A pub is a pub, unless there&#39;s something special about it, y&#39;know? 

Won&#39;t hurry back to Ballydoyle. Pubs are a dime a dozen in the Chicago area; I&#39;ll keep looking for a favorite."

We worked closely with Linda, the event coordinator.  Everything went off without a hitch.  Linda was the best to work with and made sure the night was perfect.  So many of our guests commented that they had never been to Ballydoyle but loved the place and would definitely be back.

Waited 14 minutes at our table before anyone acknowledged us and that was only because I stopped someone and asked if we could have a server.  I had a horrible headache and just wanted someone to at least bring me a glass of water and say hello, ANYTHING.  So after I said something, one of the servers came over and apologized for making us wait, but &#34;the guy that is our server is...retarded.&#34;  Holly inappropriateness.  Ok, so I let it slide and we ordered drinks.  All I wanted at that point was a water b/c there were 2 screaming babies seated at tables around us.  So when I said to her &#34;I would just like a water right now&#34; this same server said, &#34;You guys said you have been waiting all this time and don&#39;t even know what you want to drink yet?&#34;  I want a damn water, that&#39;s what I want!  Is what I would have liked to scream, but I refrained.  Ok, so we have ordered drinks, now maybe our real server will come talk to us...

Another 15 minutes passes.  So we have now been seated for 29 minutes and our actual server has not even said hello, or I&#39;m sorry for making you wait.  NOTHING.  However, there is a male server in the area that has been to a table nearby a total of 3 times since we got here.  Hmmm, I wonder if that is our guy.  Too bad we&#39;ll never get to find out, as we picked up our things and let them know we were out.  

Waiting a while for food because it&#39;s busy, is one thing.  But not even getting a hello, or an apology for making us wait, or ever waters for 29 minutes is completely unacceptable.  Goodbye and never again."

Tuesday Night Quiz Night with Shannon is one of the greatest quiz nights ever.  We went here several Christmas breaks/summers in a row to hang out with this guy to do quiz night.  It&#39;s always a fun time, especially when the drinks are flowing (and believe me - they are!).  Normally the drink prices are a bit expensive (like no pint is under $5) but on quiz night there are $3 Stellas.  Awesome!  I could drink myself stupid with those $3 Stellas... oh, wait, I have.  You just go in, tell him you want to play, form a team and answer the questions.  There&#39;s several rounds (it&#39;s starts at 8 p.m.) and you probably won&#39;t get home till midnight.   Prize?  Gift certificate to Ballydoyle.  It&#39;s a pretty good deal.   

The food is pretty good, too.  I actually rave about their Goat Cheese Salad because I&#39;ve never found a restaurant outside of France that actually serves this salad the exact same way that a French bistro does.  The dressing is a fabulous vinagrette and the salad is actually served with two yummy, melty medallions of goat cheese on crusty baguette. Yum!!  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had anything else from here - that salad is just too damn good to pass up.  Oh, wait, once I got a Reuben and it wasn&#39;t the best ever.  Just get the salad, you&#39;ll thank me.

Also, Ballydoyle isn&#39;t just a bar.  It&#39;s a good family restaurant before 9 p.m. on any night of the week and there&#39;s always restaurant seating in the back of the place (away from the bar) in case you&#39;re up for a later dinner but don&#39;t want to sit with the drunkos at the bar.

Only downsides:
On Tuesdays, the place fills up quickly so get a table early if you want to do the quiz!
On the rest of the nights there&#39;s a lot of open mic stuff so the place is annoyingly packed.  
The drinks are quite expensive (Guinness for $7?!  I can get that on special in Chicago any night of the week!) and the cocktails are not heavily poured."
ballydoyle-irish-pub-and-restaurant-downers-grove,Phil F.,mZIA4y3OTKalNgsoTiK5bw,"West Lafayette, IN",0,1,1,0,214,v4EokJsjRp9vmBqaoSyzVg,3.0,2012-06-21,"So it was a Thursday night and we needed a place to watch Game 5 of the NBA finals. I always like eating wings while watching sports: they take a while to eat and I love eating them (check my other reviews if you don&#39;t believe me)! So I consulted my spreadsheet that I made with a list of places close to me and when they had a special. Bally Doyle was on the list and I decided to pick it. I had walked by it when I went to Emmett&#39;s across the road and it looked like a happening place.

Bally doyle has very unique architecture and a nice atmosphere. There weren&#39;t that many TVs and they weren&#39;t HD, but they were sufficient. They had a nice beer selection and quite a few flavors of wings (I had done my homework!). Our waitress was nice and attractive. Ultimately, our service wasn&#39;t that great, but I think it was benevolent neglect: we were watching the game and didn&#39;t really want to be bothered and she obliged, primarily coming whenever we craned our necks or during quarter breaks. 

Wings on Sunday and Thursday are $2.40/ set of 6 and you are required to buy sauces in increments of 6, which is fairly standard. I ordered bourbon BBQ, spicy BBQ, and spicy asian (picture attached). They don&#39;t require you to buy a drink in order to get the special, which is nice. They do have a nice beer selection, though. The wings come with ranch, celery, and carrots free of charge (big props for that). Some of the wings were very meaty while others were not. I&#39;ve definitely had crisper wings, but these were fine. They gave an ample amount of sauce without leaving a puddle behind. The sauces were very hit and miss: the BBQ bourbon had no bourbon taste, but was good. The spicy BBQ was not very hot, but was still great. The spicy asian was not spicy and was honestly not good. My advice to any fellow wing-thusiasts out there is exactly what I tell people that want to go to Wing&#39;s Etc.: you can get decent bang for your buck and enjoy your time if you try standard, easy sauces. Don&#39;t get overly creative.

The atmosphere was a plus overall. They had the game showing, which is why we came. About midway through, there was live music, which was actually fairly good. There were mostly older patrons that were content to stare and keep to themselves. We did have one creepy old guy who kept chatting at us and was really, really into the chick that was providing the live music. He was mostly friendly and probably well meaning, but he was very, very awkward. 

Final Verdict: 3.5/5. The wings on wing night are $0.40/wing, which matches B-dub&#39;s special in my college town on Tuesdays. B-dubs has better unique sauces, but BD&#39;s is still a good deal. Ultimately, this place is great to try because of the atmosphere and local flair. The music was good and the wings were slightly above standard pub fair. I can&#39;t vouch for the quality or price of the beer, but this is definitely a bar for an older crowd. This is good, though, if you are just here for the bar food and music. I still think Emmett&#39;s is better, but if its a Thursday or Sunday and you crave wings, you could do a whole lot worse than Bally Doyles (like Stone City Saloon). Overall positive experience, sans one creepy dude."

But I dig this location. It definitely gives you the old Irish pub vibe. They have a ton of whiskeys and scotches to choose from. Their beer selection is pretty good for the beer connoisseur, but it&#39;s sorta pricey, in my opinion. I wish they had more WHISKEY DRINKS. They had a lot of whiskey to choose from, but no suggestions on how to drink it, other than straight or with ginger ale. That was disappointing. But they did have many other concoctions to choose from (wine, beer, mixed drinks, etc), so if you are looking to booze it up, this place will take care of you.

I would not call this place kid-friendly. They seemed really frazzled when our friends brought their baby. It was during normal dinner hours (6pm), and the hostess was running back and forth, talking with servers, talking to the manager...there were a lot of &#34;frustrated arms&#34;, where they were waving them wildly and saying things like &#34;I&#39;m working on it!&#34; &#34;Just hold on, I&#39;ll figure it out!&#34; We ended up being put into a side room, that was originally closed off for the night. I think its typically used for small parties and happy hours. All the tables were high-tops, and they brought in a high chair for the baby. The baby was basically halfway to the ground, compared to our high table. It created more of a problem for the parents. I personally don&#39;t have kids so I never run into this problem, but I could tell our friends were not enjoying themselves through dinner, because the baby wasn&#39;t on their physical level and they could barely feed her or pay attention to her without getting out of their chairs. It was nice of the place to make accommodations for us, but it seemed like this was the first time they&#39;d ever had a child in the restaurant. We would have preferred to sit at a low, normal table, not bar tables. 

There were two choices of fish n chips. The server recommended the Lunchbox, because it was crispier. It was one hell of a filet of fish! It had a thick crispy batter on the outside, and the fish was flakey on the inside. The fries were not &#34;chips&#34; style (thick), but they were AWESOME. I would go back from this meal in a heartbeat.

Our friends ordered the fried pickles for an appetizer...I had one, and holy moley does this place know how to make a fried pickle! If you are a fan of fried pickles, head over yonder.

All in all, I like this place. But they need to expand. The place was very crowded and cramped, and there was little-to-no room for people to wait for a table. So from waiting to eating, the place was extremely cozy. But the delicious food and beer made up for it."

There was a band called the Neverly Brothers getting ready to play. Because of this it cost me $5 to get in the door and I had to wear some stupid paper bracelet. I normally would have walked away from this silliness, but I was there with a bunch of people.

The place was filling up fast, but somehow my party managed to secure a few seats at the end of the bar.

The bartender was prompt and cute to boot. It doesn&#39;t hurt to have your beer served by a pretty face.

Ballydoyle has the usual selection of beers that you would expect to find at an Irish pub. There was Guinness, Boddington&#39;s, Hoegaerten, Beamish, etc. I started out with a Boddington&#39;s, which was served at a good temperature and in the proper glass. After I finished that off, I tried a Beamish, which I had never had before. It was very good and I would drink it again if I were to encounter it. Unfortunately I have really fallen in love with local microbrews, so I am not as excited about these imports.

We didn&#39;t eat anything so I cannot comment on the food.

Once the band started playing things got loud and the crowd continued to fill the place. It was a nice atmosphere and a good place to enjoy a few beers. The noise made it hard to carry on a conversation though.

Overall, my experience at Ballydoyle was enjoyable. I might stop in again if I were in the area, but I wouldn&#39;t necessarily go out of my way to go there, because it is pretty far from where I live."

It probably helps that it&#39;s an Irish bar and I am Irish, but the food is also good and they have a pretty decent beer list.  I didn&#39;t really like the pot pie; it had some spice in it that I found off-putting, and the &#34;topped with puff pastry&#34; really just means there is a puff pastry roll plopped on top.  It was ok, but I&#39;d never order it again.  My husband and I both have been please with the fish and chips as well as the chicken tenders.  I don&#39;t normally like french fries very much, but theirs are SO good!  We&#39;ve also like the pulled pork sandwich, the philly cheesesteak sandwich, and I most recently tried the vegetarian boxty.  I&#39;m officially a boxty fan!!!
We also frequent the DG location when Send in the Clones play.  They&#39;re a great cover band, and are really entertaining!  We&#39;ve gone to the Aurora Ballydoyles to see them play as well.  I very much recommend checking them out at Ballydoyles!
Also, the service at the DG location has been great!  I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve had a bad server there.  I don&#39;t have any complaints on the service at the Aurora location either.  The one in Bloomingdale, however, has awful service!  They were always nice, but VERY slow."

This really shows you how we have no life. We get on yelp and act like we are an actual food critic. Then we really think everyone really cares at what we say. Nope! just to much time on our hand. 
Now to the review:
Pizza Mia is a food establishment in Illinois. Since I am not from their, my last visit was my first time of hearing about them. They recently opened up a location in Bolingbrook. Since my company has a location in the area, we used them for lunch one day. 
We ordered food for about ten people. The females loved this place since they were able to get on line and see the status of our food? Yes, you can get online and check. Pretty neat. Next time I&#39;m down there, I will want to try the pizza. Most of us had sandwiches and salad. Food was very good, serving size was perfect. Workers there were very nice. I had the Italian beef sandwich with hot peppers. It was good, plenty of meat and not to much bread. 
Overall this was a good place to try, will do it again. They have four locations in Illinois, and guess they have been in business for 25 years."

I love the thin cracker like crispy crust.  The cheese and toppings are always on point.  I just wish this location would offer the 18 inch pizza.  The employee did point out though that they offer a free small cheese pizza with purchase of 14 or 16 inch pizza with coupon.  They also have a program that you can earn points for every dollar you spend and redeem points for free food.  I cant wait to try the chub pizza next time!  We will definitely be back!

Not a good experience, first off the crust was a little under cooked and it was supposed to have beef and giardiniera but it hardly had any as the picture shows. It was also supposed to have a garlic crust, didn&#39;t taste any garlic what so ever. So far Pizza Mia has proved to be one of these places that doesn&#39;t get it right as ordered off the menu and one must tweak the pizza to get it right. Very disappointed."

I stopped in for a quick slice or 2 and ended up trying the Chub. It was $6 and some change for 1 slice and a bottle of Coke, so I only got 1. 

1 slice of this was plenty. The Chub is basically a roast beef sandwich in the form of pizza. There isn&#39;t any sauce on it, and not a ton of beef, but this isn&#39;t a bad thing. It has beef, cheese and giardinara, and it isn&#39;t as spicy as I thought it would be, but it IS very good.  I&#39;m not sure it satisfied my craving for pizza though. That&#39;s obviously not their fault.  

I will definitely be back."

Most people I talk to who have tried it say it&#39;s not that great. My husband doesn&#39;t care for it either. I prefer pizza with a thin crust. I love cracker thin and theirs is decent. It&#39;s crispy when you bite into it. Love that. The only issue is the price. I just don&#39;t feel that it&#39;s as good as the price you pay for it. I know may pizzerias are like this but I hate that toppings cost so much. I&#39;ll have to try it again to reassure my four star rating.

Based on the other reviews I was hoping for a more crispy crust. Meh. Not so much. It was almost a little soggy. As if it was done for a while. My husband picked it up as it was ready so it&#39;s not like it was sitting there. Taste was ok. Better than Papa&#39;s on Schmidt Rd but not as good as Traversos. Breadsticks were nice and fresh but kind of bland. Gave it 3 stars because I&#39;d like to try the double crust or speciality pizzas before totally knocking it.

After assuring him that we were happy and that it was our first visit, he wanted us to know that he would much rather get a customer and new sandwich than allow them to leave unsatisfied.

I usually end up getting something from the Italian bag and I love that you can add basically any topping you&#39;d like. They also have specialty sandwiches that I&#39;ve tried before like the monte cristo and Elvis. Those are worth giving a shot. Their house chips are delicious which was surprising because they are on the vinegary side. They usually have a sample out so give them a try first.

My only complaint is that it is a little pricey. I guess I have to get use to the fact that a 7 inch sandwich costs $7 these days. They did have a grub hub coupon for your first order that I will use next time."

My super tasty sandwich consisted of roast beef on wheat with tomato, red onion, lettuce and thousand island dressing (with a side of jalepeno chips for a little kick of course). All very yummy!

Which Wich is not your typical sandwich joint. When you walk in there is a huge menu on the wall. It lays out all of their meat options, salad, and specialty items. Then, below that are little cubby holes with paper bag menus for each meat option. You grab a marker and the bag that corresponds with your meat option and mark off your sandwich details! Everything from cold or warm, to sauces, cheeses, extra meat, bread - you name it. Then just take your bag up to the register and they&#39;ll whip your which right up!

The staff is super helpful and jumped to explain how the restaurant works. Which Wich also caters and now delivers - yay!

He wasted the ten minutes we were waiting sweeping up nothing. Meanwhile, both trash cans were overflowing. We did sit down and eat and by the time we left about 35 minutes later, the trash was still overflowing. I would not eat there again nor could I recommend this place to anyone.

No thanks, I don&#39;t want to pay for water, but would instead like a larger glass. I was then rudely informed by the rotund manager that&#39;s why they have bottled water. 

Maybe an employee thing at this store, yet will say it was completely empty at 12:30 pm, making me believe others are loosing interest in this chain.

I&#39;ve driven by the Oakbrook location a couple times but other than that I&#39;ve never seen or heard of this place.  We were in the area furniture shopping and decided to stop by for lunch.  There was a good amount of people there.  I was a little confused as to what to do when I walked in.  Luckily there were some customers that followed us inside, grabbed a bag and started marking it.  We eventually figured it out.

There are so many choices.  I have a love/hate relationship with restaurants with huge menus and endless options.  I love that I have a million things to choose from but I hate it at the same time because I just want to eat everything.  I went with the chicken pesto.  I initially wanted turkey when I walked in thinking of what kind of sandwich I was in the mood for, but they didn&#39;t have any more bags left for it.  I wasn&#39;t sure if it&#39;s because they ran out or they failed to refill it but I was too hungry for the hassle of asking.

The sandwich was pretty good.  Fairly filling for a 7 in.  They don&#39;t skimp out on ingredients like Subways tend to do.  I left satisfied but not guilty that I just ate something unhealthy.

The bad reviews don&#39;t really pertain to me as I&#39;ve seen the pattern being very low workers.  When I went on a Sunday afternoon there were 3-4 people making sandwiches and one person manning the register/cleaning.  So it might be a hit or miss.  This place left me with a good impression."

I am really picky when it comes to cleanliness and this location was not very clean. The tables were pretty gross as was the floor. I observed the guy making sandwiches use the same gloves for at least 15 customers. He used the same gloves to make sandwiches and touch things that were not clean. It grossed me out.  I had no choice but to eat my sandwich at that point.

I got a meatball sandwich from the Italian options, which I thought was quite tasty.  My wife got the black bean patty from the Veggie options, and she was somewhat disappointed.  She thought it might have been a morningstar bean patty or some such, she wasn&#39;t impressed, but she felt she would try it again.  My biggest concern is they have a ton of different options, and sometimes I feel things suffer for that.  The upside to that is they have a lot of interesting looking sandwich options to try out.

Ordering is kind of weird but positive overall, you pick out from a bunch of bags and mark them with checkmarks on the various things you want.  Then you bring that up to the cashier and he passes that along to the workers.  We were the only ones in the restaurant when we went and things were a bit slow for them to prepare, but not tragically so.

This is a sandwich shop.  It isn&#39;t Morton&#39;s.  There&#39;s no coat check, no hostess, and no valet parking.  Get over it.

Next up ... the people who complain about how small the sandwiches are.  If you routinely consume 10,000 calories per day and can power down six large pizzas without thinking twice, then yea, the sandwiches probably do seem somewhat small.  For any normal person with a normal appetite, however, it&#39;s plenty.  But don&#39;t worry ... be happy ... they&#39;ve introduced Mongo and King Kong sizes as well.  So now there&#39;s a size for every appetite.

The cost is appropriate for what you get.  I get the Wicked with double meat, extra cheese, and a variety of toppings, and while it may be a buck or two more expensive than other places, it&#39;s well worth it.  Let&#39;s get something straight.  These sandwiches are friggin delicious.  If you don&#39;t like the sandwiches here, you most likely have a brain tumor.  This place is genius.

This place reminded me a lot of Potbelly with infinitely more choices and personality.

Which Which? is located in a small strip center across the highway from Whole Foods in Naperville.  The lot is small but adequate, and it seems as though there is a pretty good turnover of patrons so just wait a minute and a spot should open up if the lot is full.

Seating inside is fairly limited, but staff stayed on top of cleaning tables and encouraging turn over without being pushy.

This is a great place to take kids, although it is a little pricey for what you get. 4 sandwiches, 4 drinks and 4 cookies set me back $31. When you walk in, you grab a brown bag and a sharpie.  There are 9 different types of bags for adult sandwiches, and one for kids.  The kids meal includes a drink choice and a mini rice crispy treat.

The choices are almost overwhelming, but start by choosing which category (bag 1 for turkey, bag 2 for beef etc) There is a counter before the register where you can take your time and debate on your choices, or just fill it out at your table.  Next you choose the size sandwich, type of bread, and any condiments, cheeses, extras that you would like. Just check them off with your sharpie. You write your name at the bottom of the bag, turn it in and pay at the register, and then they call you by name when your order is done.

The food is solid, just what you would expect from a sandwich shop. I took a walk on the adventurous side and got the Elvis, toasted peanut butter,banana,honey and bacon. It was surprisingly good, but not necessarily something I would order twice. The other sandwiches in the group included the mediterranean, kids pizzalicious w/o crust, and a muffaleta, all satisfied customers. And oh yeah, if you order cookies, they give them to you warm out of the oven, every time!

You also have the option to flip over your bag, and be artistic. Draw a picture, make a comment, whatever, then hang it up on one of several lines strung across the walls with cute little yellow clips. The wall is full of previous patrons &#34;art.&#34; Pretty fun.  I would go back if I were in the area again."

The concept is pure genius. You walk in, select a paper bag from different sandwich categories (italian, chicken, veggie, etc), then check off boxes to select your toppings. You hand your bag to the cashier and voila. Brilliant. 

I&#39;ve been going here since it opened and have never had a bad sandwich. I tend to stick to the Italian category, but I&#39;ve also tried the Chicken Cordon Bleu, WIcked, Cuban and the Pastrami. All supremely delicious in their own ways.

Price? Sure, it&#39;s more expensive than Subway, but c&#39;mon. Subway is the low-end &#34;Chevy Aveo&#34; of sandwich shops while Which Wich is the Rolls Royce! You can&#39;t even compare the two. And you don&#39;t get that funky Subway odor jammed up your nostrils. Bonus!

Size? I think a big problem these days is that America is used to eating portions fit for a 800lb morbidy obese man.  The 7&#34; is more than enough to fill me up. But if you&#39;re super hungry, or you just like to stuff your face, they now have 10.5&#34; (large) and a 14&#34; (super) sizes.

I find the decor to be very cool. Yes, industrial, but very modern. If you want lace doilies and Victorian charm, this is not the place.

I went with &#34;The Wicked&#34; sandwich which is a combination of five different meats (turkey, ham, roast beef, pepperoni, and bacon) and three different cheeses (your choice from seven options). Sure it was $1 more for the 7&#34; sandwich bringing it to $6.20, but I had to fulfill my curiosity of what a sandwich would be like with that many different kinds of meat. And let me tell you... it was great. :)

Amazingly the sandwich wasn&#39;t as packed as I thought it was going to be since they just put thin layers of each kind of meat on it, but it was still very filling. Having the options for spicy mayo and spicy Ranch was pretty awesome, and I&#39;d say those really helped bring the sandwich up to the quality I was expecting.

If you&#39;re looking for an alternative to the classic sandwich place you&#39;re always visiting this is worth the time and money. Just try not to get overwhelmed by the options they have available."

I went with the Italian Grinder which had Salami, Pepperoni, and Capicola. Then I added some provolone cheese and a TON of delicious toppings. All for $5.20.

I see some people complaining that this is expensive compared to Subway, however, I don&#39;t feel like that is an Apples to Apples comparison. Which Wich offers way more sandwich options than Subway, and an insane amount of toppings and sauces to go with it. Combine that with the unique way you get to order, and I&#39;m pretty happy paying $5 bucks for a 7&#34; sandwich that tastes fresh.

There are days when I want a cheap-o Subway sandwich and days when I want a little something different, which is when I&#39;ll go to Which Wich and happily pay a little more."

Took the wife and kids to this sandwich shop for lunch over the weekend and I&#39;m glad we went.  You get to build your own sandwich from the ground up essentially, so I think the concept is pretty cool.  The options are almost a little overwhelming though.  I had the corned beef with swiss and the sandwich was awesome.  Also, for a small, it was plenty of food.  The kids loved the shakes and make sure you get the home made chips.  Would definitely go back here again when I&#39;m in the area."

I keep waivering between 3 and 4 stars, because the service was friendly and helpful. And the sandwich wasn&#39;t that bad. But price and seating and temperature... eh.

When we arrived, the cashier immediately came out from behind the register and asked if we&#39;d been there before, and saying no, she gave us instructions. 

Choose what # sandwich you want and take the coordinating bag. Take a sharpie and write what you want on the sandwich on the bag. Give the bag to the cashier, pay and wait. 

I had a Triple Cheese and my fiance had a Buffalo Chicken, both non-toasted 10&#34;. No chips, but I had a Sprite Zero in a can and he had a bottle of water. Total was $18+change.  Really?!  That&#39;s kind of expensive! Yep. Really.

We sat down with our drinks to wait for our sandwiches. Probably wouldn&#39;t have felt as long if we waited at the counter and watched them being made. 

For tables, there are high table tops with no-back bar stools and regular short tables with regular hard wood chairs. Not comfy. 

The cashier brought our sandwhiches out to us, which was nice. But didn&#39;t bring napkins and we couldn&#39;t find them. Turns out there are rolls of paper towels at either end of the restaurant. 

It was also very cold inside the place. I tried to find a short table that wasn&#39;t under a vent, because the air conditioning seemed to be on when it was only 23* outside. I don&#39;t like eating while wearing a bulky coat, but didn&#39;t have a choice here. It was COLD.

The sandwiches themselves were good, but not good enough to go out of our way to come back. I&#39;m used to sandwiches being so packed that you have the innards sliding out of the back of the bread. Not here. Also, our GPS couldn&#39;t find the address. So if you&#39;re looking, it&#39;s around the corner from Costco at 75th and 59 on the 75th side."

You can literally choose everything from the type of bread, the spread, to the toppings. The few times that I have been there, the place was kept pretty clean and the staff were friendly.
 
Try the Buffalo Chicken or the Italian Grinder for the sandwiches. Their cookies are also delicious! They give them to you right out of the oven. But the shakes are just average and over-priced. The sandwiches themselves are also a little expensive compared to other sandwich places but the regular size should be more than enough for most people..."

Don&#39;t get me wrong, their sandwiches are great and I will continue visiting this place but at other location. The only thing that makes me think twice before making a trip there is that this place remains closed without any notice and this place does not even show up on which wich official website. Long story short I drove 10 miles from my office to get a sandwich for lunch and when I reached there I found out that the place was closed (so no lunch today). I met an old couple there who were also disappointed as the place was closed and they also mentioned that a similar thing had happened just 5-6 days ago. So my only advice would be to call and go there and if open do enjoy a strawberry banana milkshake with your sandwich and you would be happy."

That&#39;s what gives this place an edge over the other sandwich joints.  Pork, ham, chicken, shrimp, beef, meatloaf, egg salad, breakfast sandwiches - holy shit, it&#39;s all here.  You choose a meat, a cheese, toppings and sauces, mark it on a paper bag, hand it to the cashier, and pay $5.10 for the sandwich (minus tax).  I prefer to order this way, as opposed to going down the line, Subway-style, and telling the dead-eyed employee what you want.  Nope, just hand &#39;em the paper bag, pay, then take a seat and wait for your name to be called.  Yes, please.

I went for a Crab Salad sandwich with lettuce and fat-free mayo - not the most exciting choice, but a good one nonetheless.  The bread was lovely and warm and very similar to what they serve you at Potbelly.  My brothers got the Barbecued Pork sandwich (it smelled so good) and the &#34;Wicked Wich,&#34; which had a bunch of meats, cheeses, and sauces.  I don&#39;t remember exactly what my bro put in it, just that it sounded like a strange combo, but he assured me that it was delicious.

I don&#39;t really get the griping about the portion size, as it looks to be about the same as at Subway or Potbelly.  After my sandwich, I was satisfied without being stuffed - and isn&#39;t that how we should be eating, anyway?"

The junior Jeffrey Steingarten&#39;s who reviewed it prior to me seem hold a chain-sandwich shop up to some pretty impossible standards. 

The concept, first off, is very cool. You come in, look at the menu, and then fill out a bag telling the sandwich maker exactly what you desire on your meal. That eliminates the tedious reparte that exists at other sandwich places that often results in wrong orders. They offer a ton of choices- if they wont make it, then you probably do not need it. 

I thought the bread was good, and as for the much maligned portion size, I applaud a place that is not blatantly contributing to the severe obesity problem in this nation. I found the portion no smaller than potbelly&#39;s anyway. I had a tomato and avocado and it was delicious.

I found that the standard 7&#34; is very filling relative to its size, and I usually order a footlong sub at Subway. Being vegetarian, I also get plenty of options, and I particularly like their variety of sauces and onions. Also, the bag-artwork of past customers on the walls is simply charming, and I love to contribute. Oh and the house chips are yummy.

I ate it. Not bad. Not great. Still felt hungry, so I had to walk over to Whole Foods and gobble down a muffin.

I found the size of the sandwich to be quite satisfying and the ordering system was kind of fun if not a little overwhelming at first but nonetheless it definitely worked for me.

Overall the price wasn&#39;t bad and I was definitely full after my Wich.

I had a roast beef with tons of veggies, no condiments.

I think it blows Potbelly, Quiznos, Jersey Mike&#39;s, and any other chain I can think of away for reasons too many to list.

I love they only charge $5.10 for one of their regular sandwiches. You really can&#39;t go wrong with that price especially when you consider the options and the higher end ingredients that are available.

I think the portions are practically perfect. I don&#39;t know about the other reviewers, but I don&#39;t like to feel like my stomach is going to burst after a meal. It gives me the hiccup/burps and then I get sleepy. After having a sandwich and some chips from Which Wich I am happily satisfied. My stomach still feels like it has something substantial and I don&#39;t get sleepy. I also only need to expel stomach gas once and I am done.  For a comparison, I have always finished a sandwich from Potbelly and wished I had another half of a sandwich. I am not thinking this way because I think the sandwich was epic. There just isn&#39;t enough food in their servings.

I don&#39;t know why people are knocking the bread either. I am a big bread fan and I found the stuff tasty. I have to issue a bit of a disclaimer though because when it comes to bread, as long as it is mold-free, I am eating it, but I still thought this place had good bread. If I could only live off of bread, I would.

The biggest reason to go to this place is for the options. There are actually too many to comprehend. On your first trip you will need to either spend several minutes in front of the sandwich board or resign yourself to the fact that you will need to make another trip.

I have been here a few times and I have never had a bad impression of the employees either. They have been attentive, polite, and helpful every time I have visited.

I would have given this place 5-stars, but I couldn&#39;t do it since it is a chain, but  the fact that I CONSIDERED giving it a 5-star rating means a whole heck of a lot."

There were only two people working when I decided to give this place a shot, and it kind of felt like we were inconveniencing them by eating there.  Service was slow and the two workers didn&#39;t seem like they could keep up with the few people in there.  Tables were kind of dirty as was the floor.  It looked like no one had touched the seating area in quite awhile.  On top of all that, the sandwiches weren&#39;t even that great.  Granted I wasn&#39;t expecting to be blown away by the food, but at least give me something to work with that may make me want to come back.

Here is the catch.  Which Wich is selling 7&#34; sandwiches for the same price as Subway&#39;s $5 foot long.  Even a 6&#34; subway sandwich is larger than this 7&#34; sandwich.  So, where I think this place has good ideas, they either need to make a larger sandwich or drop their prices.  You can get the same choices, more food and spend less money at Subway and Quiznos and not have to drive out of your way to get there.....

I noticed Which Wich after a trip to Whole Foods, checked their website, thought it sounded like an interesting concept and took the spouse there for dinner one Saturday night.

You walk in to a wall of bags with sandwiches grouped together by type, take a bag and choose how you would like your sandwich built by marking up the bag with a red Sharpie:  bread, cheese, sauces, veggies, condiments, etc.  They also toast your sandwich.

My husband has tried a different sandwich combo each time we have gone and he has yet to be disappointed.   He wanted me to mention that they are very generous with their portions; Mr. Carnivore usually orders double meat on his sandwich and says that it&#39;s more like quadruple meat.

I have tried a few different combinations but am stuck on their chicken salad.  The thing I like about Which Wich is the variety of condiments that you can choose from, they are different from your basic lettuce, tomato, pickle selections (who else has olive salad as a regular topping choice???, normally on a muffaletta), and all of it is real food.  In other sandwich shops, the condiments look like they came in a giant plastic bag or maybe a big can, and have no flavor.  On my chicken salad (that has real chunks of chicken in it), I get red onions, avocado and olive salad and a tiny bit of lettuce for a little extra crunch.  I do not like ordering a sandwich and getting a pound of white tasteless iceberg lettuce on it.  I write &#34;lite&#34; next to lettuce on my order bag and the people who build the sandwiches actually READ the bag and my sandwich has a little bit of lettuce on it.  This may not sound like a big deal but on the customer service scale, the fact that they cater to their customer&#39;s specific requests means a lot to me.  The staff has always been friendly and prompt.  

We have Potbelly&#39;s, Jimmy John&#39;s, Panera and Subway right in Bolingbrook but we will drive the 1/2 hour to go to Which Wich in Naperville if we are in a sandwich mood.  When I looked on their website the day I noticed them in Naperville, that was their first store in the area and it looks like they are opening a location in Chicago soon.

The servers were quick and kind. Our daughter enjoyed the free popcorn and the cheeseburger off of the kid&#39;s menu...I took a bite of the burger and it was tasty.

I ordered the steak bites and my mother had the prime rib both were AMAZING at medium rare and HUGE portion sizes.  Overall great ambiance, food, service and I&#39;ll be happy to return in March for the baby shower.

The order-taking  service could best be described as indifferent to my presence at the counter, as the person manning the register was talking on the phone for about two minutes before acknowledging that he had a customer ready to order. Not a good start.

I ordered a baby barbacoa burrito and an order of refried beans. It took quite a while for the food to be prepared, but it was pretty much in the middle of lunch rush, so that&#39;s OK.

The burrito was quite good - the meat was juicy and plentiful and in no way did it seem baby-sized. The beans were bland and forgettable, though the portion size was good.

Unlimited communal chips and salsa are available for no charge to dine-in customers, which is pretty cool. I was carrying out, so I can&#39;t comment on the quality.

If it wasn&#39;t for the guy at the counter ignoring me, the quality of the barbacoa might have pushed it towards a 4 star rating, but you can only play the cards you&#39;re dealt. I certainly would try it again, but there are numerous Mexican joints like this in the area (Taco Grill and Salsa Bar, for one) which I prefer."

Just so you can eat and get back to work.

I was pleasantly impressed with how good the food here is. On a past visit I had tried the Burrito de Lengua (they have to have good tongue to be legit) and immediately made a mental note that if I were to ever come back to ANL, that I would make it a point to at least eat one more meal here. The most recent visit, I went with a lighter option, tacos de barbacoa and chicharron, on corn tortillas. So good. The barbacoa was stringy in the best sense of the word, and the chicharron were spiced, crunchy nuggets or pork&#39;splosion. 

On top of reasonably priced tacos, they have complementary fresh chips and salsa while you wait, or dine in. It&#39;s in that big communal bowl to the left of the counter. And they are perfect way to start a meal, or just a something to pass the time while you&#39;re waiting for your food.

Another perk. Endless Horchata. That&#39;s right, think about that for a moment. While it may not be the world&#39;s most high class horchata (I&#39;m sure at least part of it comes from a mix) you can keep going back up to the machine and filling up your cup. And while it may not be 100% authentic, it sure does a good job of at least reminding you how great good Mexican food can be.

If I&#39;m ever dragged back to ANL again. One word.

Menudo."

I&#39;ve taken several people to this restaurant. Tried the baby burrito with steak, it was good.   The staff is friendly.  Here&#39;s the issue - there were flying ants all over the inside of the windows and on the table. The table, chairs and doors are sticky. The place needs a good cleaning and a pest control company. The chips were stale and the salsa like water - but, free.  Once we noticed all the bugs, we couldn&#39;t eat any more. Don&#39;t plan on returning."

I have always loved their tacos and burritos.  However, my husband and I have been extremely disappointed in our last three visits.  The consistency and quality of the food is greatly lacking.  

In the past, I would order a Giant Veggie Burrito with Mexican potatoes, extra cilantro, and extra onion.  It would come with sour cream as well as jalapenos in addition to your typical trimmings.  Lately, the burrito has not had that extra kick of jalapenos or the cool of the sour cream.  In addition, it seems as though the burrito is heavy on the rice and lettuce rather than a perfect equilibrium of all fillings.  I am not sure what is to account for this change, but we are going to start looking for a new burrito place."

Note that the location listed as being in Bensenville is no longer an El Burrito Loco location if you&#39;re looking to go there.  

Anyway, this is a tiny place in a strip mall on the side of Cass Avenue.  It was being run by a couple of young women and we had our orders taken in a fairly friendly fashion and quickly enough.  The girl who helped us was kind enough to tell us that sour cream was extra on a burrito - I liked knowing that in advance since some places don&#39;t tell you that ahead of time.

I ordered a baby veg burrito and the thing...  ok, it was bigger than a regular burrito at most other places.  Huge, in fact.  The veg comes with rice, beans, avocado and either regular or &#34;Mexican&#34; potatoes, which are spicy and have peppers mixed in.  I skipped the avocado and had the Mexican potatoes instead of the regular ones and I have to say it was a big carbfest, what with the tortilla, beans, rice and potatoes all nice and neatly wrapped together.   It was a darn tasty burrito, to say the least.  I also liked the carrots and peppers - nice and spicy. The red sauce is hot, by the way, and the green is mild.  The red sauce does the job, to be sure.  

Other diners at my table also enjoyed an egg and chorizo taco (enormous), a pork burrito (pretty good) and steak tacos, which were not bad.  The guacamole needed a bit of seasoning but seemed to be really fresh, which is a good thing.

There is a table on the side of the register with a big container of chips and a sign that says &#34;free chips for eat-in diners,&#34; so that is a nice touch.  

The place was clean enough and service was fine.

If we&#39;re in the neighborhood, we will likely go back but it&#39;s a bit out of the way for regular visits."

The chorizo is a tad greasy, but it is delicious.

The store has a fairly extensive menu with selections that come close to matching a sit down Mexican restaurant&#39;s menu. Posole and menudo are always available. Chuletas are on the menu. You get the idea.

Food quality is pretty good for a fast food outlet.

The storefront is in a strip mall that faces Cass near 75th Street. It has a large window looking out towards Cass. Ambiance is typical of a hamburger place.

Service is very good.

The Darien Burrito Loco has an extensive menu, prepares decent food, has good service, and mediocre ambience. It is inexpensive. I recommend it for Mexican carry out or for occasions when ambiance is unimportant."

I usually always order the Baby Burrito steak dinner. It&#39;s reasonably priced and more than enough food. (In fact, the baby burrito isn&#39;t much smaller than a regular burrito) Beans and rice are very good and you get an ample amount with the &#34;dinners&#34;. Salsa is very good.

I like the small burritos and the graucamole, which is still more expensive than it should be.  Seriously, can&#39;t we clone avocados by now?  Why is guacamole the most expensive thing in any Mexican restaurant?  I&#39;m paying $1.50 for a Coke in a glass bottle from Mexico, and $2 apiece for avocados from California.  And they don&#39;t even COME in bottles!  Something ain&#39;t right in this country.

Anyway, the tacos are good, although the steak can be salty.  I love the roasted pork and the chorizo.  Great refried beans.  There are free chips &amp; salsa in the restaurant.  The salsa is weak, but hey, it&#39;s free.  The chips can range in quality, I&#39;m guessing depending on how recently they made them.

Open late, nice people, very extensive menu.  Lots of regular customers, which I think is the sign of a reliable burrito joint.  Plenty of seating available.  Also, it&#39;s not &#34;the only game in town,&#34; as there are several burrito places along the same street.  I&#39;ve tried the others, this one is the best."

It is NOT your run-of-the-mill fast food place like Burrito Beach. In my mind they should be a restaurant with carry out but appear to be the opposite. Looks are deceiving.

The menu offers awesome Mexican soups like caldo de pollo that comes with tortillas, chilis, cilantro and onions to add if you like. They offer traditional Mexican breakfast items like huevos rancheros and huevos con  bistek. 

The only draw backs are the menu is huge and can be daunting and they take their time preparing it - more like a sit down restaurant and not really fast food.

The friendliness of staff? I could sum it all up by just saying &#34;Great!&#34;, but I&#39;ll continue. 
I&#39;ve been here a few times now, and overtime I was greeted warmly and almost like a long time customer. In fact, last time I was there the (owner?) even recognized me after I had posted a couple of pictures from a previous visit. This tells you that he does take the time to look at his reviews and cares what his customers are saying, something not found nearly often enough. 
Let&#39;s move on the the food. It&#39;s all very fresh and made however you want it. I ask for cilantro instead of lettuce? Boom! Not a shred of lettuce and wonderful green cilantro in its place. Some extra jalapeños? Do you want whole, diced, fresh, or pickled? The prices are as perfect as the food and the service. All on point. The pastor stands out, especially when mixed with the chorizo in one of their &#34;special&#34; burritos.

Tonight is my third time here this week, and I don&#39;t do that with almost any restaurant. The owners are super friendly and the ingredients in every dish are among the freshest I have ever tasted. The location may seem discouraging for some (located near the corner of Route 31/Lake Street and Route 56/Butterfield Road/the bridge connecting Aurora and North Aurora), but DO NOT BE DECEIVED. There&#39;s ample parking adjacent on the south side of the bridge (same side of the street as the restaurant) so that&#39;s not an issue. The location is super cozy and has a warm decor, but lacks central air conditioning so summer visits can be a bit on the warm side for some. The servers I&#39;ve had, I believe, are both the owners&#39; children and do a fine job. The young man is particularly funny as well as dutiful in his job.

The table salsa can range from &#34;delightfully spicy&#34; to &#34;oh my gosh my mouth is on fire but this is too tasty to miss;&#34; the horchata is authentic (not a mix like too many taquerias in the area); the guacamole is creamy and cooling with the right amount of lime; the chicken burritos have more chicken in them than most chicken dinners you get at any given restaurant, and the pastor tacos are the most delicious I&#39;ve had in the United States. Do yourself a favor and stop in.

One warning: when ordering takeout at a dinner rush hour you may be waiting upwards of 40 minutes for 6 tacos and 2 tortas, which would be fine if the girl taking the order on the phone didn&#39;t quote a time of 20-25 minutes.

Side note: the owner told me last night bag they offer catering services for weddings/parties/any night you don&#39;t want to make your own meal. Their cook will literally make everything on the spot for everyone fresh, not simply buffet-style. How cool is that?"

The reason it isn&#39;t a 4 is because it took 20 minutes to make 8 tacos and some guac for a take out order. I&#39;ve waited less time at a sit down Mexican restaurant. There were two people waiting for take out orders in front of me. Both ended up going up to the counter to ask how much longer their wait would be. that&#39;s a fairly embarrassing situation.

I will give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe a kitchen guy called out on a Friday night and they were down some hands. No one else has mentioned slow service, so maybe it was a fluke. I would have liked to have the option of calling ahead - that would have been much better, but they didn&#39;t have anything online and there were surprisingly no paper take out menus at the counter for next time. So if the owners read this, my recommendation is to go to kinkos and print a bunch of menus so you don&#39;t have the stress of a bunch of people waiting in the small restaurant.

So the food. The guac was really good. My husband loved it slightly more. I love salty guac and this was not that, so I would have preferred a tiny more salt but then again, that&#39;s me so in no way is there a complaint on the guac. We ordered tacos and a torta. The steak torta was messy, but the meat was well seasoned. The reviews on the el pastor tacos were so high, but I weirdly preferred the chicken. The pastor had almost a grisly texture that I didn&#39;t love. All in all, the tacos were good, and even though they look small, they were very filling.

I will go back because I got a glimpse of their burritos and I need that next - with the guac."

Steak, Chicken, Pork......all Excellent.  The kicker is that this was just their &#39;remote&#39; stand at an outside festival.  The guy that served us said the restaurant is &#39;much better&#39; because they can take their time and of course have a full menu.

They use El Milagro tortillas and double it with each taco. So glad I decided to try it.

Update: Just tried two tortas al pastor and breaded steak. These are without a doubt the best tortas I have ever had. I kid you not. Very generous portions of meat and perfectly made.

I have driven past many times and wanted to stop in (after all, the sign in the window says &#34;The Best Tacos in Town&#34;), but the timing wasn&#39;t right.

I was initially unsure about where to park. I believe it is alright to park at the food and liquor store on the corner, but space is limited there, so it&#39;s probably best to go to the lot east of the restaurant.

Vanessa mentioned Tandoori chicken, but I didn&#39;t see that on the menu. It must have been a remnant from the previous management, and has since been eliminated. That really has no place in a Mexican restaurant anyway.

One thing I really like about the place is that it&#39;s quite authentic. It doesn&#39;t have the &#34;touristy&#34; feel of many Americanized Mexican restaurants, but is a bit rough around the edges, you know, the sort where the locals would eat (that&#39;s a plus in my book). It&#39;s a tiny restaurant (my living room is larger than the dining area), and I agree with Tina&#39;s review that there is a fair amount of spillover of supplies that would typically be stored in back, but I suspect that&#39;s due to the small size of the building. It didn&#39;t bother me though, it just gave it a kind of &#34;welcome to my kitchen&#34; feel (as did the clovers decorating the walls for Saint Patrick&#39;s Day), all of which is appropriate for what I believe is a mom-and-pop operation.

I opted for takeout, which was a decision I had made earlier, and ordered the chile rellenos dinner (includes rice, refried beans, and corn tortillas) and a chorizo burrito. It did take about 15 minutes or so before the food was ready, which isn&#39;t too long considering it was made from scratch, as opposed to sitting around all day or frozen, and then nuked when ordered. I could hear the chef whipping up the batter for the chile rellenos and the sizzle as they were fried. It all smelled so good, and I was sooo ready to eat when the food came out of the kitchen, I wished I had chosen to dine in! If you want fast, go to Taco Bell. If you want authentic, come here.

Another reason I wish I had dined in is that by the time I got home, the food had cooled somewhat, but it was still delicious and the portions were large. I will definitely be returning, and will dine in next time."

the staff is very friendly and accommodating, but could probably use a little more experience. they can sometimes forget to refill your water and it can also take a while to get your food, depending on what you order. despite those two negatives the prices, food, and friendliness of the staff make up for it.

its kind of hard to find, its about a minute walk from harner&#39;s bakery, by the river. there is ample parking. its small, seats about 20 people. this is the type of place that you DON&#39;T go to for the decor and ambiance. 

the menu is extensive, typical mexican cuisine, but they also have tindori chicken and some veggie items on the menu. i think this is so cuz a co-owner of the place is from the middle east. also have burgers, dogs, and fries.

my husband and i went tonight and had the nachos (which could easily feed 3-4 people), the diablo shrimp dinner, fish tacos, and chicken tacos. all this for $24 and some change! the food never disappoints, always very good...and cheap! oh yeah, when you sit down they give you freshly fried tortilla chips and salsa to munch on.

i recommend you try it here. its a great go to place for lunch and weeknight dinners when you don&#39;t feel like cooking or spending too much money.

p.s. will soon be serving alcohol."

Waiter service good, but not their fault it takes forever for food. 
Rolls mediocre only. And asked for spicy, oops they left that off.

Finally ordered a Vietnamese spring roll. Came fried, apparently they changed their offering without changing the description. Mgr said they are Pan Asian, so they are flexible in their offerings. I think they should do a google search. 

Didnt even like the miso soup, and  thats difficult for me."

This time the waitress was less than thrilled to be waiting on us. The server never introduced herself and was providing the minimal service...take order and drop off food.

Made a reservation at 7 and was seated immediately. 

We picked out the Inky and Papa&#39;s Choice Makis but wasn&#39;t sure which to pick for the third roll. The waitress suggested the St. Charles since it&#39;s one of their most popular rolls and it was a great recommendation since it was my favorite out of the three! It was fried on the outside with shrimp and other stuff in the center and it tasted like fried shrimp with a twist. 

The rice was soft and came out fresh. I asked for extra ginger and they gladly added a large portion for me. Although the waitress checked on us a few times in the beginning of the meal, she lacked attention towards the end, hence minus one star. I had to ask another server for water and the check.

I don&#39;t know maybe I&#39;m a service snob because I was a waitress for so long but she just was very inattentive.  While eating she never cleared our bowls from our soup or the plates from our appetizers.  She brought me a refill of my diet coke but not one for my friend.  When she brought out our meals she just put them on the table and walked away.  I don&#39;t know but you think a job where you are paid by your service you think you&#39;d try a little harder!

This restaurant is tucked away in the outdoor mall area in Burr Ridge.  If it wasn&#39;t for Groupon, I probably wouldn&#39;t have found this hidden gem.

I love the inside of this place - it is very peaceful and beautifully decorated.   Service has always been top-notch when I&#39;ve been here (3rd visit).   Friendly, helpful, but not all-up-in-your-face.  

This last visit, I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, crazy roll, and spicy tuna roll.   The lettuce wraps were a huge portion.  Seriously, to be split between 2-3 people - or as a meal in itself.   I had $30 to use up on my Groupon, so I thought I would try something other than sushi.  I would highly recommend the lettuce wraps - great flavor!

Both rolls were solid and fresh.  The rice wasn&#39;t as tightly packed as it could have been, but still above average.

Ate chap chae with scallops.

They seem like such completely different places. The Burr Ridge one is so overdecorated with its giant bells, dragons and changing neon colors. The decor is completely distracting when you&#39;re trying to enjoy a meal. I feel more like I&#39;m in some tacky nightclub than a restaurant.

The food is similar, but somehow the chefs in Elmhurst make things better. I&#39;ve had the noodle dishes, and while good, they aren&#39;t blow-me-away good like in Elmhurst.

But this past weekend was the first time we tried their sushi. It&#39;s expensive, so you expect to either get really high quality or a lot. I got neither. What I ended up with were basically wagon-wheels of rice with just a tiny bit of filling in the middle. And the quantity of pieces was on the smaller side of what I&#39;m used to as well. 

Disappointing. My wife and I ordered 4 rolls total, and one of them was just a dessert roll and our bill was over $40. I will NOT be going back here next time the sushi craving hits. Too overpriced for what you get."

We asked to be seated outdoors (there were others eating outside) and were told we could not sit outside because a storm was about to roll in (however, the apple weather app showed no storm for the next few hours). Our food tasted like it was precooked and just reheated and was VERY salty (except for the curry which barely had any sauce). We needed many refills of water and mints after to compensate.

Dumplings tasted like the frozen supermarket kind. Spider roll was very average and the soft shell crab itself wasn&#39;t the best. Kinda spongy texture. The double pan fried noodles dish was just okay. Sauce was very thick and not very flavorful. Overcooked shrimp. Lame vegetables, were those broccoli stems or what? In short, there are much better places to get this kind of food. It&#39;s also pricey for the food quality and portion size."

The lighting was dim and the bar area changed colors throughout the evening. I wasn&#39;t expecting such a nice spot in an outdoor mall. 

We both went with sushi. I love that they offer a brown rice option. I was pleased with the menu selection. It was actually difficult for me to decide. I ended up being really happy with my choices. I would rate the maki rolls a solid 4-4.5 star. 

We didn&#39;t make it during happy hour. I can&#39;t recall the exact deals but it seemed they always had some special going on. The waitress kept trying to up-sell me on everything. That&#39;s the only area they lost me. 

I&#39;ll definitely return for some sushi and cocktails. I&#39;m hoping to save room for dessert next time. That menu looked great as well. I just hope the waitress gives me an honest opinion next time instead of trying to squeeze extra cash out of me."

A mysteriously large portion of cabbage salad was a bit strange, and not terribly good, but who orders Satay to sample the side of slaw? Also really appreciated the Sake Flight for $10.00. Nice sampling of a wide variety of the product.

Despite being a chain restaurant, it didn&#39;t real feel, or taste like one. 

Also wasn&#39;t terribly expensive. Our appetizer &amp; sushi rolls were all on our table within ~15 minutes of ordering, even though it was a busy Friday night.

She explained that you call in or reserve online and that there would always be a table available for us. Really? I then asked why she failed to seat us when we had been there 30 minutes.

The decor was perfect for sushi.  Very authentic and tasteful...And very clean!!  We walked right in and were seated immediately.

Went here a few times after discovering this place right off I55 and County Line Rd. Really easy to get to and in a really nice outdoor shopping mall. 

Enough about the logistics....lets get to the good part. 

You will never find a better deal than the HAPPY HOUR specials(4-7) You have to eat in the really nice and modern bar to get it. Every app and regular maki rolls are 1/2 price, and there are cheap drinks for guys and girls. I had the Hong Kong Calamari app a few times and it is the best thing there, and its even big enough to have as a meal. The sushi and other apps (Tuna Poke, Coconut Shrimp) are really good too, not just because they were half price. 

Date Night tab should be around $30 if you play it right, that&#39;s a great deal for the quality of the food in expensive Burr Ridge."

Cannot get enough of this place! I went in for Happy Hour for a table of 8 recently and service could not get any better, so, I had to write this review!

Atmosphere = Modern, Cool, Clean - Some may not like the changing colors but I love it!

Server = Excellent! Our server&#39;s name is Riki. He did not get frustrated with taking our orders. I felt kind of bad since we kept ordering more food! No hiccups! Very Pleasant! No complaints here!

Food = Awesomeness! I have never been disappointed with their food. I&#39;ve had most of their appetizers if not all. Some of my favorites are: Yakitori Beef, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Tuna Poke, &amp; Crab Cake Hand Roll. (Definitely worth it during their Appetizer Happy Hour!)

I must also rave about their sushi Hotategai (Scallops). So FRESH! The best of all the sushi places that I&#39;ve been to. Speaking of FRESH, I LOVE basil and their Thai Kick Specialty Maki Rolls were so refreshing!

As for their entrees, I&#39;ve had their noodle dishes and I ask for EXTRA EXTRA spicy and they&#39;re so GOOD! I usually get the Pad Thai, Pad Siew, Basil Chow Fun &amp; their Thai Curry dishes.

I&#39;ve been to their Elmhurst &amp; Wheaton locations but the Burr Ridge location is my favorite!"

For one, there&#39;s a huge white Buddha when you first walk in that kind of scared the crap out of me. There&#39;s a lot of pretty cool modern decor, which I liked. For lunch, I had the Szechwan chicken on brown rice. It was decent, but not as spicy as I had hoped. If the dish has the spicy symbol next to it, I expect spicy! But I didn&#39;t care enough to flag down the server for some chili sauce. However, they were very accommodating when I wanted to add some pineapple to the dish. Hey, I like a little bit of sweet with my &#34;spicy.&#34;

My date and I also ordered edamame: it was SOAKING in oil. Our hands were so oily after eating them, and I refused to finish them. Edamame should never, ever be oily!

Great value. 

Best happy hour specials. Food is A-ok...price is reasonable.

Not sure  why they put apples in the wasabi salad and don&#39;t write it in the menu description.   Not typical, so a complete shock/surprise. What else do they leave out? My husband ordered a martini up and got it with ice.  After he flagged down the waitress-many minutes later-They just drained it - not sure they understand about martini&#39;s   -

We have been going here since they opened-the food used to be bad.  After three tries and ordering different things we stopped for awhile.  Friends invite us -we oblige .  My adult children refuse to go back. The food has improved in the last year and a half, so if you didn&#39;t like it when it first open- try again, they have improved.

We got a roll to start with, I believe the tequila jalapeño, which was recommended by our waiter.

I would not order sushi or rolls here. Dao across the street is significantly better or the same price.

The entrees are expensive, and &#34;decent&#34;. Would I eat it again? Probably. Would I pay 15 dollars again? Hell no. Too much sauce on all the food. Rice on both the roll and the meals was old and dry.

I still can&#39;t get over the corny feel to the entire place. The giant Buddha upon entrance felt like something straight out of a theme park.

While I enjoyed the food, the prices were a bit to high for my liking. On a Saturday evening the place was basically empty so were were able to sit outside immediately. Win.

The server was nice and prompt. The menu is a little limited, but we weren&#39;t disappointed with anything. The noodle dishes are all priced on a scale though. There is a basic price for the dish and then you add a dollar for tofu a dollar for chicken and so on. I have never actually paid extra for tofu so I was not really a fan of that. The drinks were pricey too, but good.

For two of us to have noodles, split an appetizer and a drink for each was a little over 50. So not too bad, but not cheap enough to come all the time."

When you first walk in you are greeted by a giant Buddha statue.  At first you&#39;ll be taken aback by the rich decor, but once you sit down and really take in your surroundings everything starts to look a bit gaudy.  But that&#39;s just my taste.

Everything on the menu sounds so appetizing.  I was really excited while waiting for my food, but once it got there I can&#39;t say I was completely impressed.  I ordered the Grilled Wasabi Salmon, and while it was good it wasn&#39;t anything out of this world.  For $17, I would have expected a little more.  Everything on the menu is priced pretty steep for what it is.  We ordered the sesame banana fritters for dessert and that was just okay, too.  The Banana wontons at Stir Crazy are definitely better.

Overall, the service was good.  Our waiter checked up on us and was attentive and it didn&#39;t take too terribly long for our food to arrive.  I&#39;ll probably come back to try out their sushi because from what I saw, their sushi looked pretty good.  I was just a little annoyed while watching the people at the table next to us eat their sushi with their forks.  That is a huge sushi no-no.  For an Asian Fusion restaurant, you would think they&#39;d have chopsticks sitting at the table with the forks and knives, but we had to ask for ours."

A week or so after they opened, I called to place a phone order. I pride myself on being very clear when I give an order, to make everything easier for all involved. The hostess was having a very difficult time. When I came to pick up my food, the THREE young, pretty hostesses could not figure out how to take my bill and split it between two credit cards. Right down the middle. As a former server and bartender, this is not difficult on most POS systems. Finally a bartender or manager came over and showed them how to do it. 

When I got home, while the food was good, they had messed up my dad&#39;s order. I called the manager and was very polite and told him what happened. I acknowledged that they had just opened and told him I assumed he would want to know as a manager and as they work out their opening kinks. He was very apologetic, took down my address, and said he was going to get some gift cards out to me tomorrow or the next day. 4 or so months later....nothing. BAD MOVE. 

I was pretty miffed, but decided to give them another shot. A few of my co-workers at Eddie Bauer down a few stores at the mall told me they also experienced poor service. Two co-workers went there after work for a drink and light apps, but no one greeted them at the front for almost five minutes. So they left.

My sister and I went the other night for dinner and it was dead. It took our server almost ten minutes to bring our drinks - an iced tea and a lemonade, not complicated. Our food did come quickly, but our server never checked in on us and asked how our food was. By the time he came, we were done. 

With so many good places to eat in the area, I probably will not be returning. For great Thai, check out Cida Thai in LaGrange."

It was not busy, but a pretty decent crowd for a Monday!  We were greeted by a GIANT buddha when we walked in.  Really cool atmosphere with great music (think top 40s) and different colored lights changing throughout the restaurant.  

We started with sushi.  I am not a big sushi eater, so I opted for a veggie option.  They didn&#39;t offer a veggie roll, but the chef was willing to customize one for me!  My husband ordered the the spicy California rolls...they were delicious and not too spicy! I actually ended up liking them even better than mine, thus expanding my sushi palate! Our entrees were good as well; I ordered the orange peel chicken and my husband the Spicy Shanghai.  The Spicy Shanghai came out though and was not even as spicy as my orange peel chicken.  It was as if they had forgotten the spicy sauce.  We asked the waitress and she offered to get more of the sauce for us, which she did, but it took awhile and by the time we got it I was done with my meal.  

They have happy hour specials in the bar/lounge area from 4-7 Monday through Friday.  Half price maki rolls and drink specials.  I would definitely go back for that!  Overall I thought the prices were a tad bit high, $50 for dinner for us before tip, but the food was good!"

I was worried they were only doing it to be trendy, but they knew how to do it properly for those of us who can get seriously sick from it.  They put in my order with &#34;gluten free&#34; written in capital letters, brought me a separate and gf labeled container of soy sauce, prepared my food on a clean cutting board with a clean knife, and when I asked about spicy mayo they let me know theirs had gluten so I couldn&#39;t have it.

Overall positive experience.  Very happy they took gf seriously so I can have sushi without worrying about getting sick.

Only other comments would be for them to have a gluten free spicy mayo and more exciting gf maki on the menu.  Again, though, I had a good time with no real complaints."

Many of the items on the menu are exactly the same or some old menu items. Yah my girlfriend manages a Stir Crazy as you could have guessed. The entrees are decent but the sushi is usually really good. Its a bit on the pricey side but they do some very reasonable happy hour specials.

As far as the rolls go all of the signature rolls are consistently some of the better ones Ive had outside of a traditional sushi place. The inky and the mamma&#39;s roll are worth checking out. The downside is the entrees are just average and it feels like a nightclub more than a restaurant inside. There is color changing lighting that just doesn&#39;t fit the cuisine.

Basically this place is almost trying to hard to fit in. Get some good sushi at a traditional place and go to Stir Crazy to get the original dishes. You will be happier in end."

It&#39;s like a no-cover lounge with food! I came a few minutes before happy hour but thankfully the drink specials were going on all day. I began my experience with a mango margarita. It was yummmmmy! Next we were seated in a large booth in the main dinning room. This place is decorated so nicely. Everything was clean, neat, and modern. I ordered the sesame chicken w/ brown rice. It was cooked to perfection (not too crispy, not soggy, just enough sauce, rice was cooked perfectly not mushy like some Chinese places cook it). It did not taste like the sesame chicken I&#39;m used to, but it was still delicious, and it tasted like they pre-toasted my sesame seeds which gave my chicken an interesting flavor. My bf got the sushi sampler which he seemed to&#39;ve enjoyed. Those of you who are familiar with my reviews know I love a restaurant with a clean bathroom, and this place took the cake. The bathroom was a little small but it was lofty with a midnight blue theme.  It was dark in there but lovely, when you first walk in there&#39;s a huge mirror so you can see your whole outfit, which ladies love! The stalls were a little tiny but I didn&#39;t feel claustrophobic because of the lofty open ceiling above. To make a long story short this seems like the perfect place to come for a double date! The ONLY thing I really didn&#39;t care for was the music in the bar area. I thought there&#39;d be a DJ or just lounge music playing in the background. Instead there was a guy on keyboard just singing random songs very loudly. I wasn&#39;t really a huge fan of him... Other than that, this is THE place to go for Chinese food in the area."

Then, both my husband and I had upset stomachs when we got home.  Even with the kids eat free,  wasn&#39;t worth the money.  Only reason for 2 stars is the nice waitress."

Live nearby and my husband thought it would be good to try as he heard good things about it.  Would you think that they would be more attentive?  The server was a younger man who didn&#39;t greet you with anything like Happy St. Pat&#39;s Day, we have a special of corn beef &amp; cabbage or just anything relating to St. Pattys Day.  Actually he didn&#39;t know if they had the special or not ready that early - after 11am on St. Patty&#39;s Day????  Really????  They did.  I had the Shepherd&#39;s pie.  Nothing at all special about anything.  The service was not great.  4 groups of people in the dining room.  Never seen him go to anyone to see about drinks.  Finally came around after both are drinks were down to the bare minimum.  Noticed only 1 server and before we left around noon another came in.  People were standing in the door and waited for 5 minutes or more before anyone noticed them.  Very dark and antiquated looking place.  Again, it&#39;s St. Patty&#39;s Day.  No cheerful greetings, no personality and the food not good quality.  
If you look at all my reviews, there are hardly any 1 stars.  So you know it has to be pretty bad.  Telling it like is, I will not be back and will not recommend."

Today, my son and his friend went to Katie&#39;s for lunch to enjoy the all you can eat wings special as they frequently do.  Today&#39;s visit was different.  They were seated and served as usual but today the management decided they looked suspicious.  The two boys were asked repeatedly if anything was wrong to which they replied &#34;no&#34;.  The management then called the police.  When the police arrived, the management asked them to lift their hoodies to check for weapons and they were told there is a No Hoodie policy the restaurant.  The boys were then asked to leave and they did without incident.  I need to mention the boys were dropped off and had no vehicle to drive home in the storm.  So the attire was Ok enough to seat and serve them, but used as an excuse to make them leave?  And its Ok to embarrass to teenage boys in front of a restaurant full of patrons from our community?  I later spoke with the management and they confirmed that they recognized the boys as regulars and that no particular incident occurred that prompted them to harass the boys other than they felt they looked suspicious.  I will no longer be frequenting Katie O&#39;Connors  and I highly recommend avoiding this establishment and spending your money somewhere else that appreciates the local community support."

We arrived at 4pm to an empty restaurant and put in our appetizer and meal orders as well as our drink orders. Our drinks arrived and that was the last we saw of our server. 30 minutes passed.... We sat there with no appetizer and no one checking on how we were doing. The restaurant was nearly empty so it was hardly a case of being busy. Finally someone arrived (not our server) and asked if we needed drinks. My husband ordered another beer. We noticed the man (who was not our server) went over and watched the TV not putting in our beer order. 

Suddenly our elusive server showed up and we asked about our appetizer. He said it was being put in along with our entrees. It was already 30 minutes, how much longer were we to wait for our appetizer or were we expected to eat it with our entrees? At this point my husband&#39;s second beer arrived. Neither of us were willing to wait another 30-45 minutes for our appetizer and /or entrée. We requested out bill for our drinks and left. At no time was an apology for the delay expressed to us, instead we were made to feel ignored, unwelcomed and a burden.  Considering the restaurant was almost completely empty, we were surprised at the lack of service. We left and went only about a mile down the road to another restaurant where we had good service and were able to enjoy our appetizer and main meal within a normal time period. 

NEVER ever going back. We ate there once before and the service was sketchy but passible and the food was good. This time, the food wasn&#39;t worth the crappy service. Sorry but if you don&#39;t want me there, I won&#39;t be there."

We hadn&#39;t eaten lunch, knew Katie O&#39;Connor&#39;s was close and decided to head over. 

The inside looked nice while we were walking through, but our action was on the outside. We went out to the beer garden and sat. The beer garden  half-full of tables and chairs, and a bar was up against one wall. We went in mid-May and they may have still been setting up -- this could be an outstanding beer garden.

Our waitress was a high point -- she was nice and courteous. She also paid attention when my gentleman companion said he liked olives, by finding him the serving of pasta salad that had the most visible olives. 

The food, however, was a bit of a disappointment. I had a bbq chicken wrap and caught some untrimmed chicken that I had to spit out. My lunchmate had a forgettable burger. Fries were pretty solid, but that was offset by the fact that the pasta salad comes in cafeteria-style plastic containers with the tops on. 

I would go back for beer and may try their appetizers. I definitely want to see their beer garden in the summer!"

We were excited to try a new place though... and on a search for some good fish and chips. 

the waitress could care less... she never filled up our drinks on her own, she stomped around back and forth with hardly an acknowledgment of our table when she would pass by. no bedside manner whatsoever. but i think she was saving that for her patio tables that were drinking up a storm. whatever. 

we started with the Irish Nachos. they were good, except that it seemed like the bacon only made it to one side of the plate. it was a good thing that i filled up on these. 

The BF had the fish n chips and his only complaint was that it seemed like they tried to piece smaller pieces together into one and fried it. but he said they were good, the batter was good, they tasted good. 

i had the bangers and mash. the mash was pretty good, the gravy was pretty good. the green beans were tasteless and the bangers tasted like frozen jimmy deans sausages. not good. not good at all. 

i wasn&#39;t going to make a big deal out of it, but i just couldn&#39;t stomach the sausage at all. the waitress asked, and i said i didn&#39;t like them. she barely said sorry and handed us the bill. the BF asked if she could remove my dinner since i had only eaten one sausage and hardly any of the potatoes or greens. she said she&#39;d go ask. she came back and handed us a new bill that only had the groupon taken off and a balance of $2. she didn&#39;t include the original bill (listing the entrees)... i knew she was being shady. we did the math, she hadn&#39;t had my entree removed and wasn&#39;t going to say a thing about it. whatever. it was a groupon, i won&#39;t be going back. 

i don&#39;t think i would go back here at all. i&#39;ll have to look into some of the other places nearby. and for bangers and mash, i am sticking with Ballydoyle."

Wings and Blue Cheese are so easy to do right, the lack of effort was not inspiring. The main course was &#34;The Pounder&#34; burger for me and ribs and chicken for my wife. Both were good, but again not remarkable. The worst part of the whole dinner was the hastily poured Guinness. C&#39;mon guys, any place that calls themselves an Irish pub shouldn&#39;t be pouring a Guinness in 28 seconds.  The menu was a mish-mash of assorted fare, ranging from Irish to BBQ to Mexican. A clear lack of focus here, only 2 stars because the burger was pretty good and the service was right on.  My advice: skip it."

My parents, a neighbor friend and myself go almost every Friday after 5 pm for the Fish &amp; Chips special. OMG, it is the best deal around. All-you-can-eat Cod in a great tempura type batter, super tasting fries and a cup of coleslaw, all for $8.45. That&#39;s a good 2-3 bucks less than the VFW/ church fish fries that are popular especially this time of year during lent. My mom always gets the Philly steak Boxty, it&#39;s like a Philly steak sandwich but wrapped in a potato pancake instead of bread, she says they are the best potato pancakes she&#39;s ever had. The burgers and the O&#39;Paddy melt are great too. We haven&#39;t tried the fajitas yet, but the next table over had ordered them and man, they looked and smelled awesome. I would recommend this place to anyone, big groups or just a date night. They have a neat little corner booth that would be great for a nice dinner without the kids
  They have some drink specials and different promos every day, check their website for a list of specials."

Started out fine, decent prices and beer selection. However, everyone in the bar seems to be over 35, we are 23. A couple of regulars came in and sat close to us at the bar, and they were clearly drunk. The manager proceeded to fill her glass after glass of wine, and the regulars became more and more obnoxious. The lady began verbally harassing my friend, calling him and myself gay lovers. This went on for a good half an hour, at which point she came up to me and demanded to see pictures of my girlfriend. I had enough, and asked her to leave us alone. Being as drunk as she was, she immediately started yelling and swearing at us. Caused a whole scene at the bar. She and her husband (about 50 years old) threatened to beat me up. This is all while I am sitting in the same seat I have been for 2 hours. Worst part? The manager tried to split us up, making my friends and I feel like we were partially to blame for the scene. At no point did he ask the drunk patrons to leave, nor did he stop serving them alcohol. Classless regulars, and a manager that can&#39;t control his bar. Never going back."

In this day and age, making sure my drink gets a refill is, to me, an expectation, but obviously more than I could expect from this place. Another person commented that the service was lousy, I too had to wait an abnormal amount of time for each stage of the dinner. Definitely not an enjoyable dining experience.

Food was delicious, we all liked what we had. We had Irish Nachos for an appetizer and I had the BBQ Chicken Wrap with fries for dinner. All the food was very good and affordably priced. Appetizers to entrees flowed well and there wasn&#39;t a long wait time for food or drinks to arrive. 

Perfect atmosphere for a family friendly dinner if you go early. We got there at 5:30pm and were there until almost 7pm. There were several kids in the eatery side and it was very nice. They had boosters seats as well which is good when we have my nephew in toe. 

Waitress was very nice and accommodating. My cup was never empty and she checked in on us often. 

Only drawback was that there weren&#39;t many microbrew beer options on the menu.

My first trip there was to have a drink at the bar. My drink was $6.50. I put a ten dollar bill down and never received the change. A  2nd trip there several months later, the same bartender charged me $6.50 for my 1st drink, and $5.50 for my 2nd drink which was the exact same drink. I think this is a way for them to control the tip you give them. They have good food and it is a great atmosphere of friendly people, but ask for a  receipt for everything including if your just stopping in for a drink. Your tip is your decision, not the bartenders or waiters. If any waiter or bartender at any restaurant or bar asks me, &#34;do you want your change&#34;, I leave no tip because it&#39;s my decision what they deserve for a tip not their decision and that question should never be asked of a customer.

As we were heading to another restaurant, we found this one. It is across from Willowbrook Ford if you&#39;re having trouble finding it. I&#39;m glad we did find it.
My husband always orders sides because he didn&#39;t eat eggs. We always pay more this way. Kathy, our wonderful server, put the order in as a one of the breakfast dishes so that it saved us money. That never happens when we go out for breakfast. Thank you Kathy for being so wonderful! My husband&#39;s food was plentiful and great. I got the strawberry crepes. Again, plentiful and very yummy. The lady next to us got the corned beef hash omelette-it would easily make two meals. I would want to try that next time. It looked great. Her husband&#39;s skillet also looked delicious and plentiful. I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll ever be in Willowbrook again, but I would come here again."

But from there, the plot thickens *cue mystery music*: substituted red velvet for regular pancakes, then added a side of sausage in gravy because I have to check to see if northerners know anything about gravy..but this is a chain store..further complicating identifying what people know about breakfast if the menu is formulaic like a chain store. Eva suggested the gravy here won&#39;t taste flourly without sausage taste....she was right! I do feel a little immoral since I didn&#39;t get anything blueberry, given the name of this restaurant. But this means a second visit (and review) is warranted.

The sausage and gravy is meaty and almost too salty. Chocolate chips melting in middle of pancake and boojah!, the cream cheese side topping is the bees knees. Egg consistently is good/firm. Next I polished my teeth on German crepes with lemon sauce..slices of cantaloupe and lemon. Not bad but I doubt the Germans really go all out for lemon crepes.

Give Eva a nice tip before you leave."

It was buy $15 for $30 coupon but you get two $15 coupon where you have to go twice to get your money&#39;s worth. But we decided to try anyway. 

The place looked like a nice diner type of restaurant. I didn&#39;t really like the water pitcher already filled and out in the open before I sat down. Maybe I&#39;m picky but all the ice was melted and I had no clue how long it&#39;s been sitting there so we didn&#39;t drink any of the water. We ordered a lemonade mixed with Sierra mist to share instead and that&#39;s ok. I don&#39;t care for water either way.

My son ordered the chunky monkey which was a huge waffle with fresh bananas, pecans, chocolate syrup, powdered sugar and whipped cream. We shared that and it was excellent! Not too sweet and it came together very nicely. Whoever thought of this combination was a genius. 

I ordered the King of the hills omelet but we took out the onions and potatoes because well....my son didn&#39;t like the ideas of having potatoes inside his omelet and he hates onions of course. So it ended up being sausage, ham, bacon, green peppers and cheddar cheese on top. It was very tasty. It came with a side of pancakes with powdered sugar and I don&#39;t get pancakes often but it fell apart so I&#39;m not sure if that means it&#39;s fresh? I took it home for my little one instead and he inhaled it in two minutes so it was very good I take it haha 

My waitress was very nice and friendly. She cracked jokes with my son and he was laughing left and right. But the service desk where we paid, those girls was not very friendly. No smiles and too busy counting their cash register to even look up. I waited with my son until they decided to acknowledge us. After we paid, no thank you, please come again, no eye contact. Is it because I paid with a local flavor deal? Not sure. I have to come back to use the coupon again so we will see. I would have given a 4 star or even a 5 star because the food was excellent and our waitress was nice. But until the minute I walked up to pay...the great experience was over. Oh well. We will see the next time we go again to use the coupon before I can recommend this place to my fellow foodies."

If all breakfasts turned out like the one I had this past Saturday, then I&#39;d never want to wake up before noon again.

In an effort to be a shining example of a good grandson, I took my grandma--Sonja B--here for a nice little morning meal because Blueberry Hill is one of her favorite places.  No problem, it&#39;s been at least a decade since I last ate here so I figured I was due for a visit &amp; review.

Although the menu offers lunch items as well, BH is the type of place at which you&#39;d want to order some type of waffle/pancake/blintz.  Sure enough, my grandma went for the strawberry crepes and I chose the banana nut french toast combo (half order) that came with eggs done sunny-side and bacon.  I&#39;ll start with the good: her crepes tasted great and the portion size was ample.  My bacon was extra crispy (per my request), and there were enough eggs to appease me.

Since hash browns weren&#39;t included, I asked for a side order and received a HUGE portion of their breakfast potatoes which was a decent value for something like $2.49.  Each of our plates came with fruit wedges, but they were all tough and rind-y (the ass end of the cantaloupe) and frankly inedible.  So those got a hard pass.

Everything up until this point was &#39;meh&#39;, not awful nor noteworthy.  Then things took a turn for the worse as I dug into my french toast.  It came topped with fresh banana wheels and syrup on the side........but to my shock and horror, it was one of the weakest efforts that I&#39;ve ever come across.  What they marketed as a half order of banana nut &#39;french toast&#39; was in reality two slices of banana nut bread dusted with powdered sugar.  Uncooked.  Just raw banana nut bread passed off as something vaguely resembling french toast.

It wasn&#39;t light or fluffy.  It wasn&#39;t flavorful.  It wasn&#39;t good in the slightest.  France would be embarrassed to have this labeled as their country&#39;s toast.  It was painfully evident that somebody in the kitchen was cutting corners, &#34;eh, who&#39;s gonna notice anyway?  Just throw some slices of our banana bread loaf on a plate.  Not like we got some blogger out there with a hard-on for french toast.&#34;

Bread = 2.5
Circuses = 2

Our waitress said maybe a dozen words to us, if that.  Outside of the very basic greeting, she spent almost no time attending to us and even pulled a very sly check slide (you know the move, when they don&#39;t want to interrupt your conversation so they casually slip the bill face-down on your table).  Except that I wasn&#39;t in mid-convo, she just didn&#39;t want to exert any more effort than absolutely necessary.  It honestly felt like she was trying to avoid us.

The giant decorative utensils on the wall were cool and the dining area relatively clean, but there seemed to be a constant cacophony of sounds coming from the kitchen (dropped plates, yelling, clanging pots and pans).  Regardless, that doesn&#39;t excuse them from serving cut-rate french toast and grody fruit garnishes.

Sorry Blueberry Hill, but you can take your deplorable attempt at banana nut french toast......
........and go fork yourself."

I think the owner has bitten off more than he can chew, continually opening up new restaurants.  Pay attention to the quality of food and service at this location.

The hostess was cute in her little black medium-high heels and black dress. The &#34;uniform&#34; there was relaxed yet intentional, which was a relief because my crew and I were dressed the exact same. 

I loved the fact that every table had blue water cups, congruent with the name. Gave me joy! 

The food... I had the Philly Steak (86 the steak, sub chicken) Skillet with pepper jack cheese with blueberry pancakes.  The skillet was fresh, hot, and juicy. The pancakes were awesome, plus I had &#34;extra&#34; blueberries on the side so you know I was on my way to Heaven! 

Oh! Another cool point was the fact that they had HOT water in the restroom!  For some, this may not be a big deal; for me, though, there&#39;s nothing worse than a restaurant with cold, cold water and cold, hot water.  

Now... The area of improvement... Though my crew&#39;s veggies were fresh, they were LIGHTLY seasoned. I&#39;m sure their blood sugars appreciated that but their taste buds didn&#39;t!

All in all, my crew agreed that we would stop through upon visiting Chicago again.

Was sat right next to the bathrooms (a table shouldn&#39;t be that close) and our waitress was very slow with everything! Took her 20 mins to bring our drinks when we were the table closest to them (and the bathroom) my biscuits and gravy were cold. Not impressed!

Blueberry Hill is great because it&#39;s open till 3PM, has a pretty reliable menu of breakfast and lunch standards, cooks the world&#39;s fastest food, and the servers are quick, no-nonsense, and polite. The food isn&#39;t the best i&#39;ve ever had, but it definitely isn&#39;t the worst. 

I love any of their pancakes that come with a cream cheese dipping sauce - that sauce is sent STRAIGHT from heaven and I think I could drink it with a straw if they provided one. I usually ask for extra, I love it so much. When in season, their pumpkin pancakes + cream cheese sauce = OHMYGAWD. The BEST. My mom really likes their lunch options, but admittedly I&#39;ve only ever gotten breakfast. Today I got the chicken fried steak with biscuit and gravy and it was the single largest plate of food EVER. They give you FOUR eggs, an entire chicken fried steak, an order of hashbrowns, two biscuits, and cover the entire thing with country gravy. I ate about half before throwing in the towel, and I was starving. It&#39;s THAT much food. 

The coffee is meh, but they have those fun flavored creamers that can make any coffee taste like a sugary delight. The servers are quick to refill, which also helps. ALSO, the prices at Blueberry Hill are usually a buck or two less than the other major players in the area, like Moondance Diner or Egg Harbor. And I love that some of the hostesses and waitresses have been working there for YEARS, because it makes me feel like they treat their employees well and are able to retain great staff.

It&#39;s probably not a &#34;go out of your way&#34; type of spot, but for a solid, reliable, quick breakfast, Blueberry Hill does not disappoint."

The Nutella crepes hardly had any Nutella except for what was drizzled on the top. It was mostly just crepes and banana slices thrown on top.

I love that there are never any lines for restaurants in the suburbs :)

FOOD:
+Walnut, Chocolate Chip, Blueberry Waffle- I thought they would put the stuff in the batter, but they just tossed it on top of the waffle. Too many choc. chips and it was a gooey mess
+Veggie Omelet- so BLAND- i think they forgot the salt
+Biscuits &amp; Gravy- soggy biscuits with nasty gravy
+Potato Pancakes- they didn&#39;t accomodate my mother in law&#39;s request to put the jalapenos and onions INSIDE the pancake. Why is this so difficult for a place that claims to make everything fresh?

SERVICE:
We were seated right away although the food did take a while to come out

Came with a party of 6 and we were seated immediately at 2 on a Sunday. This place has an old diner feel and the wooden booths and tables add character. The menu here is pretty extensive as I had a hard time picking between a breakfast or a lunch item. I decided to settle on a vegetable skillet after a recommendation from my friend stating the skillets there were the best thing he&#39;s had there.

The food came out in about 10 minutes and my skillet was cooked very well. The sunny side up eggs here are some of the best I have ever had- they were slightly chewy and full of flavor. My skillet came with cheddar cheese mushroom, broccoli, and tomtaoes and it was a hearty meal that, when combined with ketchup and salt, delivered very satisfying feelings to my tastebuds and stomach. I was slightly saddened that either they do not offer chalula here or that they ran out. Sometimes I feel that breakfast is just not complete without it and hope that they can stock up because that louisiana hot sauce they carried did not cut it. After my meal, my friend let me try his waffle that he replaced for his toast. They were hot and had a soft, spongy texture. Pretty delicious and satisfied my sweet tooth.

Overall, Blueberry Hill definitely delivers the goods!"

This place can be hard to miss, situated at the end of an unassuming older strip mall.  Usually, I find these types of places are rather quaint, with decent prices and good food.  This place nails the quaint part, but I was rather disappointed with my food.

Perhaps it was my fault for not ordering some type of pancakes at this very pancake-centric place.  I instead went for the Farmhouse Skillet, and my smarter than I am husband ordered the potato pancakes.  The food came out quickly, only about seven minutes lapsed between ordering and food delivery.  My skillet was a very dry mix of tiny cubed potatoes (which half of were severely burnt) overly crisp bacon crumbles and small cubes of ham (which were the only things in the dish not dried out) topped with two over easy eggs.  The egg yolks, and liberal doses of catsup and hot sauce could not revive this poor breakfast dish.  My husband saved the day by sharing his potato pancakes with me.  Now these were excellent!  The kind my Mom used to make, but I&#39;m just too damned lazy to make.  Shredded, fried, and served with applesauce and sour cream.

I will come back, just for the potato pancakes, since it is hard to find a place that can get them just right!  I&#39;ll pass on the rest of the breakfast dishes, though."

Maybe it&#39;s called Blueberry Hill because you feel as heavy as Fats Domino when you leave. I definitely could have adopted the nickname &#34;Fats&#34; after eating here. 

My first attempt to have breakfast at Blueberry Hill was dashed. We came Sunday morning around 11 a.m. and there was no getting in. Crowds stood outside the place in the cold, waiting for a table. Since I had sniffles that day from a cold bug, getting pneumonia from standing outside wasn&#39;t worth it. I decided to return at 10 a.m. Tuesday morning for another try. Sure enough, a table was available immediately with plenty more to spare. 

We were seated and ordered coffee to start. One of my breakfast companions remarked that coffee is often weak at restaurants. However, we both thought the coffee here was above average--it was strong and not watery. For my meal, I ordered  the Oreo Smore Pancakes off the specials menu. I thought about being good and ordering something with fruit--since I haven&#39;t eaten a fruit in ages. When it came down to it, the chocolate devil whispered in my ear and convinced me to order chocolate death on a plate--the Oreo Smore Pancakes. It looked like a chocolate bomb, for real. The meal consisted of three large pancakes stacked on top of each other. Plopped in the middle of the top pancake was a bomb of marshmallow cream, chocolate, Oreo pieces, and chocolate chips. It was over the top rich, more a decadent dessert than a breakfast item. I ambitiously dug in but halted when I reached the center--where all the thick chocolate goo was. I was overpowered by the huge amount of food on the plate and the richness. I couldn&#39;t even eat half of the pancakes in one sitting. The rest I took home and warmed up the next day, and they were still quite good. 

My breakfast companions mentioned truly enjoying their meals as well. I think we all will return for another round at some point. Better have a forklift on hand to lift me out of here next time."

On Blueberry Hill where I found you.

I mean, don&#39;t you really just want to sing that song to the hostess and your wait person?

So, keep your eyes open, because if you are traveling south on Route 83, there is no signage and the entrance is hidden by trees, but trust me, that&#39;s where you will find this place, right on the corner.

Never having been here previously, I found the hostess desk hidden to the left of the front door, even with the booths.  If there is a crowd, you would never see it.  Ah, the crowd, mostly seniors, which is fine with me, and then young families.  I can understand that ~ the prices are very reasonable and the food is tasty.  Servings are generous and ours arrived very quickly and very hot, just like it should.  Carafe of ice water left on the table and coffee refills frequently.

However, I found it interesting that despite open tables spread throughout the restaurant, when someone left, the table was quickly cleaned and the next party seated, that means a little nudge to vacate your table and get on with your day.

It was a truly impressive amount of food (four eggs!), so I won&#39;t judge them too harshly for this minor misstep.

The restaurant was about 40% full.  We were seated quickly and our server came right away.  Service was efficient and courteous.
Our breakfasts included the Eggs Benedict Florentine with hash browns, the seafood omelet with hash browns,  and two Blue Plate specials, one with poached eggs, ham and potato pancakes and one with poached eggs, bacon and potato pancakes.  
The coffee was excellent and the food was good. We wish that the hash browns were crispier and the potato pancakes were just OK.  I would go back again but go to several other places first."

It was nearby, served breakfast, and seemed like it wouldn&#39;t be bad. On this past trip, eating there was built into the plans long before we even landed.

It was just something that you have to do if you are around. The pancakes are that good. I even got the same thing as I did the first time. And it was just as good as I remembered it being the first time.

We  stopped on a Thursday morning, around 10 and had no problem getting a table. I definitely remember on the previous visit, a Saturday, there being a wait of about 30min. But the staff is so organized and on top of things that they seat you, feed you and charge you with almost no wasted time in between. And they do it in a way that doesn&#39;t make you feel rushed either.

The coffee was good and constantly being refilled, and the food is solid breakfast fare. The Blue Moon Pancakes (Whole Wheat with Pecans and Walnuts and Blueberries) come with the highest recommendation. They manage to be as light as traditional pancakes, but have this nutty, earthy flavor because of the whole wheat. And they don&#39;t skimp on the pecans, which is a plus in my book.

And the best part is you can eat a whole order and not feel (as) weighed down. It even comes with a side of fresh fruit. Some reviews talk about the price point being a little on the high side, but I don&#39;t think the bill came to more than $15 with tax and tip. So it may not be affordable on an every-day-of-the-week scale, but it&#39;s by no means inherently expensive.

I&#39;m already looking forward to Blue Moon Pancakes Round 3."

You can&#39;t make reservations only for large parties. Weekends are busy, especially on Sunday AM. The wait can be long, but worth it!

Seating is cozy. Staff is friendly. Service is efficient. I love that they say &#34;do you want another shot of coffee?&#34;. Price is good. 

The portions are large, so I usually share with my BF. If you don&#39;t share, expect leftovers. Our usual is the fiesta skillet without the cheese. Lots of potatoes and mexican chorizo sausage! Comes with 2 buttermilk pancakes or Greek toast. Yum! 

Perfect way to start the day!"

I was in town for my cousin&#39;s wedding and we were looking for a place to have brunch near the hotel in Burr Ridge. We tried to have the brunch at Cooper&#39;s Hawk or whatever it&#39;s called but they just started doing brunch and they couldn&#39;t accommodate a group of 60.  We settled on having the brunch catered at a conference room at the hotel and it turned out to be a GREAT idea. ( PS - Springhill Suites are very accommodating for a large group)

Blueberry Hill was absolutely fantastic from taking the original order to following up with us to letting us change the order the day before to delivery and set-up.  I&#39;m really impressed with how well they did everything. 

Also, their food was FANTASTIC.  Everyone really enjoyed their breakfast.  All of the meats were flavorful and the eggs and pancakes were nice and fluffy.  

Their price was very affordable. I would have expected mediocre quality of food and service for the price we paid. I was thoroughly pleased with the combination of high quality food and service for an affordable price. 

I strongly recommend Blueberry Hill for catering."

During the week it is busy, but you can usually walk in and get a table. On the weekends, you are going to wait. We usually order take out on the weekends rather than wait, as their waiting area is small."

Crowd: Typical suburban crowd, families, friends, old, young, caucasian

Food: Huge variety on the menu!!! We had the french toast sampler and veggie skillet.  Hefty portions, make sure you have plenty of room in your tummy!  Great presentation especially on the french toast!  The texas toast french bread with strawberries was my favorite!  Savory!  I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the banana bread and cinnamon raisin bread being &#34;french-toast-ed&#34;; it ruined the natural flavors of the bread :/ But, I do admit, that is an interesting &amp; creative idea.  The veggie skillet was delicious!  However, now that I compare all diners with my all time fave diner, Kappy&#39;s (Villa Park, IL), I&#39;m pretty critical when reviewing diners.

Service: Good! Friendly servers.

This is a great breakfast place if you&#39;re in the area.  The food was fantastic and the service was very fast and friendly.

I had the Pumpkin Spice French Toast with Cream Cheese and Apples.  The flavors were fantastic and the food was served fast. But, I worry that it may have been a little too fast.  The warm apples were slightly under-cooked, so the insides were a bit cold.  Perhaps this is by design, but if it is, I&#39;m not sure why that would be the case.  I think they would tasted a little better if they spend a little more time baking.  

The french toast could have spend a little more time in the skillet as well, but it&#39;s not enough to down grade the rating.  

In all, I would recommend Blueberry Hill to anyone in the area that&#39;s looking for a good, fast sit-down breakfast."

The standard for breakfast in the Western Suburbs is Red Apple in Carol Stream. This definitely stacks up to it.

Service: Our Waitress was very attentive with coffee, water, and soda. She took our order, and our food was there in less than 10 mins! 

Food: I ordered an omelette with broccoli, spinach, mushroom and mozzarella cheese. I also got salsa and a side of fruit. The omelette was awesome, very fluffy and tasty. I also ordered a side of whole wheatpancakes. These put me over the top! They were so fluffyand moist! I put jam on them, but you could eat these plain!

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn&#39;t experience any horrible customer service, but, most of my orders have been carry out.  The few times I did dine there, the service was fantastic.  Now the important stuff, the food.  The biscuits and gravy are really good.  Thick gravy and lots of sausage in the gravy.  My favorite is a cheddar cheese omelet with mushrooms.  I either get toast or pancakes and it comes with hash browns. All are really good.  I get a side of gravy from the biscuits and gravy to put on my omelet.  The service is quick.  Even on a very busy weekend morning, my food is still ready in 15 minutes for pick up.

The menu was large with many breakfast selections.  I found it hard to decide what to get.  I ordered the blue plate special for $7, which consisted of 2 eggs, choice of meat, and choice of half order of assortment of pancakes, french toast, or crepes.  I got 2 eggs over med, ham off the bone, and potato pancakes.  My friend got the blue plate as well with same eggs, bacon, and french toast banana foster.  We also both ordered a side of hash browns o&#39;brien, which are hash browns with green pepper and onions.  I also got coffee and a large oj which was fresh squeezed.

When the food was delivered both of us got 4 eggs!!  My ham off the bone was a little dry and the potato pancakes were horrible.  DONT ORDER POTATO PANCAKES FROM HERE.  I almost sent them back.  They were a grayish color which was odd and they tasted a lil strange.  The hash brown o&#39;brien were delish tho, i get them cooked crispy.  My friend really enjoyed his food.

Service-  Waiter was prompt.  Food came out as ordered.   Asked if everything was ok?  There was my chance to let him know about the potato pancakes, but i opted to not say anything.  The only thing I would say that could have been a lil better, we asked how big a side of hash o&#39;brien was?  Big enough to share?  He said if depended on how hungry you are.  Well if you get a blue plate special it would take a huge appetite to finish this side.  Both of us threw away half our hash browns.  Plenty big to share a side of them.

For the suburbs this place is better than most.  The city has better places, I highly recommend Lula&#39;s in Logan Square.  If I could I would give this place 3 and a half.  they need half stars"

The milk shakes and the fresh orange juice are to die for and the food exceptional!

Sadly, i don&#39;t live in the area anymore, so it&#39;s been a very long time since I&#39;ve been here, but I did go for the first time in ages about a month ago. it is much larger than it used to be which is really nice, because it used to get kind of cramped. I can&#39;t really comment about the staff because a lot of them have changed. HOWEVER, the food is still amazing!

Lines are always long here on Sundays, but it is so quick of a wait, yet I have never felt rushed to leave either. I have been to the Aurora and LaGrange locations as well, but this Darien location is still by far the best.

I got a great parking spot and there was no line at the door.    By the time we left, the lines were long and people were waiting.  They were waiting for a good breakfast, which is what was served to the wife and I.

My wife ordered a veggie omelet and I got the buttermilk pancakes.  Her dish had a good-sized omelet and very generous portion of potatoes.  I wasn&#39;t expecting to get 4 good-sized and fluffy pancakes.  We had 3 orders of link sausage between us,.  

The only complaint with the food was that my pancakes crumbled a bit too much.  They weren&#39;t dry; they were moist.  They did taste good however.

Service was good.  The place was crowded and it was very noisy.  The temperature of the restaurant when we first arrived was too warm.  Fortunately the fans/blowers started cooling things down after about 10 minutes.  That seemed to get things to a normal eating temperature.  There is nothing worse than sweating onto your food or shivering while eating.

The unisex restroom I used ( I do  not know if there are more restrooms) was clean.   There was a small rug on top of the carpeted floor next to the chair that I sat in.  When I got up, the leg of my chair caught the corner of the rug and it started to fold over.  When I stood up, my foot went underneath the corner.  One of the bus boys noticed this and warned me before I tripped over the rug.  I would say that rug was not in a good place.

Overall, we were quite satisfied and will come back occasionally."

I would go back in the future but would probably try the blueberry pancakes.That should be there specialty!"

But I noticed others people gave them decent comments and I was looking for a good Chinese food. I tried the Wonton Noodle soup with beef. Omg, it was the best soup I had in Chicago. This is a food court joint like in Asia guys. It is very common to serve food in a market. Groupon people, you guys are buying coupons at cheap prices and asking for luxury place. Your comments should be more reasonable to this boutique place. Anyway, I loved this little place, the old lady is very nice. Yes, She can&#39;t speak english well, but she was good enough to communicate with me. I also ordered a beef chow mein, it was very delicious too."

Wonton Deli showed up one time as the new business on yelp&#39;s home page for me. So I checked out the great reviews and thought about giving it a try as it looked very close to me. I was not feeling cooking today so I promised my kids with pizza if they want to go try this place with me. 

It was not easy to find. The address list on Yelp and Groupon App were correct but all pinpointed to the wrong place. Google Map is correct. And even I saw the Unimart, I  still didn&#39;t see the restaurant. 

The food counter is actual at the back of the Unimart. The sitting area is however close to the front of the store. It was not overwhelming menu to choose. I have been craving a Cantonese style noodle soup for quite a while. So I got the wonton beef noodle soup, fried smelt fish, and a medium egg drop soup. Kids and husband got a large pizza. I also bought a Thai tea drink and some strawberry milk from Unimart&#39;s shelve. 

The noodle soup was perfect. The broth was light and flavorful. The beef was tender, seasoned just right, and very good portion. The Wonton was the best part. It is plump, meaty, and with chucks of shrimp. 

The fried smelt fish was great too. Lightly breaded and fried with some chili pepper toppings. My son loved his egg drop soup. I bought a medium size soup and I got a quarter sized container. 

With that, we also got a few items to-go on the next day. The BBQ pork was excellent with the perfect sweetness and dense texture. The Yangzhou Fried rice was welcome with kids. I asked them to pack wonton soup separately. It tasted still great when I mixed them at home.

So far I have not had any bad items. With such a reasonable price list, this could be my kitchen when I need any thing. And being in a Filipino market, you could pick some cold drinks or dessert from frig to go with your meal. 

The only thing I&#39;d like they to improve is the disposable plates or bowls. Hope they will have some regular plates or bowls so eating there is more comfortable and environmental friendly."

--- Beef stew wonton soup:
Eh. The broth was kind of oily and flavorless to me. The meat was juicy, tender, and delicious though! The wontons were okay, but didn&#39;t taste like anything special. I particularly enjoyed the cabbage in this, just because I love cabbage. The noodles were clumped together and didn&#39;t seem to be cooked well, which was sad since I love noodles. Overall, I probably wouldn&#39;t order this again. 

--- BBQ pork buns:
These were okay. The bun part was soft and sweet, while the meat was savory and flavorful. However, the buns seemed a bit dry. I had a tough time chewing and swallowing this without wanting to drink water to help it go down.

--- ShaoMai:
I haven&#39;t really had this before, so I&#39;m not sure how this compares. However, when I got this, it wasn&#39;t very hot and tasted fairly bland. It wasn&#39;t the savory delicious dim sum I expected and hoped it would be.

Value: I bought and used the $6 for $10 deal. The prices were already quite cheap, so overall this was a cheap meal for a lot of food. 

Atmosphere: Eh. This is located as part of Unimart, so there are some strange smells. The seating area isn&#39;t particularly nice."

The deli is located in Uni-Mart, just south of Walgreen&#39;s.  Walking in brought me back to my undergraduate days at Loyola&#39;s north shore campus ~ overwhelming smell of fish.  I am not a fan of fish.  It cannot taste like fish or look like a fish when it enters my mouth.

Deli section is confusing, there is food on display to the right, a cash register and counter to the left.  The menu online cannot be read, so I had to spend time looking at the food that was on display and then finding the menu and reading it.  Other people ordered in the food area, but I was able to order at the cash register.  I asked about ordering a combo meal, but I did not want a beverage, since it was for carry-out, and wanted to substitute an egg roll.  Cost difference between an egg roll and beverage  equals $0.25.  Nope, I was charged for the combo and the egg roll.  There was an entire shrimp in the egg roll, beady eyes looking at me, that put an end to the egg roll for me.

Wonton soup, good stuff, but I refused chop sticks for soup.  I don&#39;t think I want to know how that works.  Gentleman at the register was very friendly and asked how I had heard about the deli (Yelp, of course), and hoped I would return.  We&#39;ll see about that.

Oh yeah, can someone please tell me how to check in.. I could not find it on my yelp app."

It&#39;s also a bit of a shame that the Wonton Deli &#34;stand&#34; is stationed across from a seafood (fish on ice) stand. Takes a bit of the romance out of the wontons.

wonton-deli-woodridge,Phuong T.,XsLwzkEdV4royQOJXe946Q,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,7,21,GtZZ96XmtSp1HWzDWHyOlA,4.0,2014-03-06,"Brought me back to hometown Argyle or Chinatown in Chicago! 

I have been looking for authentic noodle soups, wonton, and dim sum in the Naperville area. When I saw their photo of their Beef Stew Wonton Noodle Soup, I had to, had to try! I&#39;ve been so disappointed with so many restaurant quoting their soups &#34;Authentic&#34; and when you come from an Asian Community like Argyle or Chinatown, you can understand why I hold such standards when it comes to foods like this. There are not many restaurant in the Naperville area that make the wonderful, flavorful broth that is essential to a good noodle soup. Like Pho! But Wonton Deli did a fantastic job bringing my taste buds back home.

The deli is located inside a mini mart called Uni-Mart. So look for the Uni Mart sign when you look for this. Parking was easy as it is located inside a strip plaza. 

When you walk in, the deli is on your left hand side and the mart is on your right. The layout of the place is very strange and really did remind me of the marts in Argyle. Fish smelling, bakery goods smelling, the buzzing of the freezers, the sound of the cook chopping things in the back, the shouts of the chinese lady to the cook, the buzz if the fluorescent lights above, the phone ringing, it was just a mini mart nothing fancy at all so don&#39;t expect a lot. There are several tables and chairs to pair with them by the deli area so if you were to order and eat there, you can.

The people there were very, very nice and even the cook came to the front and said hi. The lady took my order and the cook went to the back to prepare my food. I ordered the Beef Stew Wonton Noodle Soup, BBQ Pork Wonton Noodle Soup, pork Shumai, shrimp dumplings and Shrimp and scallions dim sum. I took all this food to go and it took about 15 to 20 minutes to prepare. The prices were very reasonable and again, brought me back to my old days. The big bowl of soup was $4.50 each, maybe $5 and the dim sum was about $2 to $3 for 3 or 4 dumplings.  

The containers to go are a bit flimsy so make sure they are put on tight and have extra bags tied tightly. Be easy on your turns when driving! I opened the soup bowls I immediately smelled the wonderful aromas of the stew and soups, yes! It was full of flavor and was indeed &#34;authentic&#34;! The beef brisket inside the beef stew was so tender, it was almost melting in my mouth.  You can tell the BBQ pork was slowly roasted and took a lot of time because of the tenderness and the flavor of it. I felt like I didn&#39;t have enough. Wontons were really good, had shrimp, pork, veggies, not a thing I can complain about except not having enough! The dim sum was just like the ones you would get when you go to Chinatown with the little carts being pushed around. They didn&#39;t have a lot of variety there but the two kinds I ordered was great!

I gave this place 4 stars because their food is authentic like they say. You can tell the broth took a long time to simmer and soak up the flavor. If I could give 3.5 it would be more accurate to my rating because their food was very good but there could have been more meat in the soups and the place is not very attractive. But when it comes to food, unless the place was dirty, the design shouldn&#39;t matter, especially when the food is good and the staff is good too.

So, needless to say, I will be returning to order more food. I also saw they have roast duck and chicken I can order by the pound. I&#39;m thinking 2 pounds of BBQ pork and soy sauce chicken. This over steamed rice, fry an egg and a little soy sauce. Yum!"

Beef stew wonton noodle soup wasn&#39;t as great as I thought. Broth was bland, meat came with lots of cartilage, noodles were clumped together and the wontons were tasteless.

Also tried their BBQ Pork Chow Fun (a kind of pan fried noodle) and I like it.  It&#39;s not too salty and a good portion that&#39;d last me two meals (for me).

 - use real bowls rather than disposable plastic bowls, unless it is for carry-out
 - be generous with noodles, as I am a bit starved after one bowl of wonton noodles

Out of all the items I&#39;ve tried, I&#39;d say this is the only one I wouldn&#39;t likely try again. It wasn&#39;t bad, it just wasn&#39;t as good as many of their other items. My wife had a very good Rueben sandwich, and I got an order of biscuits and gravy. That&#39;s a must every time. The clientel is generally the older crowd that keeps coming back. There&#39;s something to be said for that! George&#39;s has been in the same location for over 40 years, and I hope it&#39;s around another 40!"

It puts everyone in a good mood, especially when we leave with a belly full of delicious food and some tasty coffee to get our day going. George&#39;s definitely has it all for anyone who loves breakfast as much as I do. I happen to love skillets, so if you are a fan of those then you will be pleased with the variety they have! Not only that, but they also have all of the classics and some delicious takes on french toast (try the banana nut) as well as potato pancakes and many other great choices. 
Aside from the delicious food, what sets George&#39;s apart is their extremely courteous and attentive staff. I never was low on coffee, and we were always treated with a smile. 
The atmosphere there is great too, it&#39;s so clean and welcoming, it feels like you are eating at someone&#39;s house, and we saw lots of people either with their families or meeting up with friends for coffee. As a resident of Montgomery I am proud to support a local business who genuinely puts their best foot forward in order to give great service to their customers. There is a reason why this place has such a loyal customer base!

If you like to be recognized by your waitress and looking for your coffee cup to be refilled to the point of insanity... George&#39;s may be for you!

However, if you actually care about the quality and taste of your breakfast and prefer bacon that&#39;s not overcooked, brittle and tasteless with the consistency of cardboard, then think again.

It took a little time to order and our waitress was frazzled by the crowd but none-the-less she was friendly all the way through. Food choices are great and it is difficult to spend $10 plus here on any option. Our group had a bit of everything all all of the plates were cleared. Corned beef skillet was great, banana pancakes awesome, smoked kielbasa done to perfection all for about $40.

It must hurt to have to live in the shadows of the hipster paradise always hoping for the day when someone will notice that you have some good traits, though hard to find.  That&#39;s where George&#39;s Restaurant comes in.  George&#39;s is a classic small town diner that&#39;s been around for 40+ years in the dingy, sad area wistfully referred to as &#34;Downtown Montgomery&#34;.

After having driven by the place in search of a short cut to the coolness that is Oswego my wife and I decided to try it out.  First the place is busy for its location but spotlessly clean.  Your first hint that you may have struck it rich are the tables of senior citizens.  This group won&#39;t pass up good food reasonably priced!

I noticed  that the big screen TV was set to CNN.  Not that FOX would have affected the overall experience, but I like that George chose a less controversial channel for the breakfast crowd. 

The service was immediate and friendly with an excellent cup of diner coffee that would put Starbucks to shame. Add to that the fact that your cup never goes empty (did I mention they were busy?) and we have an excellent first impression.  The next thing that hits you is the price.  We were there for breakfast but every single option was a good dollar or two below what you&#39;d expect to pay in fancy-schmancy Oswego. 

I asked for a sample of their country gravy and it was immediately bought out with a smile.  Now I wish I could recommend the gravy but I can&#39;t, too plain tasting and while I could see chunks of meat I could not get a sausage taste (sorry George, that cost you the fifth star!).  I opted instead for a basic eggs and sausage entree while my wife ordered the rIb-eye steak and eggs.  Here is where George&#39;s shines.

Our order was on the table in a matter of minutes, seriously, this place redefines &#34;freaky fast&#34;.  everything was cooked to order.  Now when you order steak and eggs you almost have to expect that they will over cook your steak if you like things on the rare side.  Not George!  My wife&#39;s steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was huge.  I mean hanging over the sides of the plate huge!  Now this is a breakfast steak so it&#39;s not going to have the quality you&#39;d expect in a dinner steak...but you&#39;d be wrong in this case.  As is the norm in a diner it was grilled on a flat top and imbued with great flavor.  Yes, it was fatty but it was a rib-eye - not a lean piece of meat to begin with.  The flavor was great.

Oh.  Did I mention that the rib-eye steak and eggs was $8.95 - with hash browns and toast?  &#34;Great value&#34; is an understatement.

And have a nice healthy day on your own time, the toast came out hot and buttered from a pot of melted butter-like substance.  Freakin&#39; diner heaven!

Two full, made to order breakfasts with beverage came to just $19.00. Add to that the knowledge that you are supporting a local, long time, independent business and everything tastes just that much better.  I will definitely be back to try the lunch and dinner entrees but I am pretty sure I just found my favorite local diner.

Be proud Montgomery, Oswego doesn&#39;t have a place like George&#39;s Restaurant."

The food is really delicious.  The wait for a table was quite reasonable - Ten minutes was actually only five minutes or so.  The restaurant is clean, and the service has been good.  They were short-staffed tonight, so the owner waited on us and was just as nice as can be.  

This restaurant has a good selection of dishes, and everything we have tried has been exceptionally good.  The ingredients are really fresh.  Even the strawberries on the cheesecake were fresh.  This is definitely our new favorite!!

******

We tried the Tuscan Tavern in Oswego for the first time tonight and LOVED it!  The food was delicious!!  I&#39;m not a big fan of Italian food, so that&#39;s saying a lot.  My lemon chicken was excellent!  My husband had the Sausage Giambatta and said it was delicious.  

The service was prompt and attentive - just the right level of friendliness.  The music wasn&#39;t too loud.  I thought that the lighting was perfect, and our bread service came promptly with olive oil and parmesan cheese.  The meal service was timed perfectly.  (These facts make me think that they are paying attention to the Yelp reviews and responding.)  

Although the Tuscan Tavern has a fairly large bar, it doesn&#39;t dominate the room, and it is adequately separated from the dining area.  The restaurant is more upscale than it&#39;s strip mall location would make you think.  Even though it&#39;s a nice restaurant, I felt comfortable wearing jeans and a blouse.  The other tables had children present, but they were well behaved and quiet.  We went on a Sunday, and we had no difficulty getting a table.  Parking was readily available, and the location is very convenient.

In sum, we very much enjoyed the Tuscan Tavern and definitely will be going back again."

Place wasn&#39;t packed but hostess said since we didn&#39;t&#39; have reservations we could sit at a high top table by the bar. Ok, fine with us.  Took forever to get drinks! Something about bartender being in an accident and they were short on servers. So, when this happens, do you have the servers you do have pull together to make it work? Didn&#39;t&#39;t seem like it. Our server was very frazzled. Chef came out and griped at her-something about vodka. But, very unprofessional to 1. Interrupt her while she&#39;s waiting on us 2. Gripe at her in front of us! Seriously?? Our food was really good. That&#39;s the saving grace here. Took forever to get it, but it was really good. 
One of the servers seemed to be just making circles around the restaurant. She could have gotten refills for other tables. Hostess could help out as well to make things run smoother. Also tell hostess if she drops menu on floor, don&#39;t give same one to customer! Ugh.

The place is nicely decorated in dark wood. The dining area has about 20 tables and the bar area has stools along the bar and about 10 tables. Upon walking in just before 7:30pm, there were four tables occupied. We waited for a few minutes and no one greeted us. I actually walked in the dining area to flag down a bus boy who got a server.  There were two servers and a busboy for four tables...keep that in mind when you read the rest of my review. We finally sat in a booth and again...waited.  Our server, Deb, was nice and did greet us with her name.  I ordered a glass of wine and it took a little long to get.  The busboy brought bread. No butter, no olive oil, but we had bread. When Deb came back with my wine I asked for olive oil and cheese. (That should be on the table in an Italian restaurant.). We placed our order...and waited.  Finally, I flagged down the busboy again and asked him for the olive oil and cheese, which Db didn&#39;t bring us and it was brought to us on a small plate.  Deb came back to the table and said the asparagus salad was not going to happen as they were out of asparagus. So I ordered a different salad. The busboy came by and asked if he could clear our plates and I said no, we wanted more bread. I left the empty basket at the edge of the table with the napkin open thinking that would be a hint. After a 35 minute wait, the food showed up.  My husband had the meatball and ricotta pizza.  The crust was perfectly cooked, crispy and thin. The toppings were tasty with a kick from the peppers. I had the caprese salad which was two slices of locally grown heirloom tomatoes with mozzarella and basil. It was fresh and full of flavor. I also had the eggplant appetizer for my meal. It was thinly sliced eggplant with melted cheese and a good marinara. Although it was salted a little too much, this was another good dish. The food was excellent and we really enjoyed our meal. Deb came back once after food service to check on us which is good, but never asked if we wanted grated cheese on our dishes. The lower rating is for our frustration in wait times and my having to ask, re-ask and get up to flag someone down. The waiting and lack of training and lack of attentiveness of the staff was disappointing. We were the only table left and the staff I felt were busy with their tasks for closing and getting out on time that I actually had to get up and flag the busboy to ask for a to-go container. Deb then made an appearance and asked if she could wrap our food and she did. We felt that the staff needs to be more mindful of their customers and to check on them. The restaurant should consider serving olive oil and cheese when they bring out the bread or keep some on the table.  The food was spot on, very tasty and full of flavor. With that said, I don&#39;t know if I would come back because of the service...or lack thereof. It&#39;s a shame because we liked the food. Unfortunately, we only left 15% instead of our usual larger tip due to the service. Maybe Tuscan Tavern can redeem themselves if we gave them a second chance?"

A few kinks still need to be worked out. Our table never received a bread basket (kind of a given in an Italian joint) and I was never served my side of asparagus. But, I digress.

The service was decent. Our waiter put on a brave face with our (slightly) obnoxious table. I didn&#39;t realize the place closes at 10 and we were there until almost 11... He never said anything and kept bringing drinks. Smart kid.

As for the food- delicious! My husband thoroughly enjoyed the mussels and salmon (and he&#39;s kind of a seafood snob). I stuck with the porkchop and mashed potatoes- yummm. No dry pork here! The wedge salad that someone in our group ordered did not look that great, but it is a salad... So there&#39;s that.

Great decor, an extensive wine and beer list. A menu that&#39;s not overbearing and well thought out. However, all this doesn&#39;t mean a thing unless the service and food are measure up and I&#39;m glad to say it does. 

Warm bread delivered to the table in a loaf pan, (one nitpick; frozen butter on a ice cold plate doesn&#39;t work well) I order Rigatoni Carbonara, a simple dish I actually make at home and this was just outstanding. A very good size portion that could probably be shared if you wanted too. 

Since Oswego has been clamoring for a non chain restaurant, the key to this place long term success will be how they respond to service issues and the ability to put out a consistent and quality product.

While I would love to say this would be great place for a family with younger kids, I believe the price points will scare a few away.

We dined here tonight with another couple. None of us had been here yet and we wanted to give it a try as we aren&#39;t fans of the other &#34;popular&#34; Italian restaurant in the neighborhood. We were seated right away in the bar area as the hostess said that the dining area was loud. We sat for a bit and then someone who appeared to be a busboy brought us bread. Just bread. No butter, no olive oil, nothing else. Okay. A server stopped by briefly and said that she&#39;d be right back to get our drink orders.  The young hostess showed up and asked us if our server came by. We said yes and she asked which server spoke to us. We described her and she seemed okay with that and left. Then we sat and waited. Finally she showed up and apologized for the wait. She explained that the bartender didn&#39;t show up so things were backed up. Okay? Three of us ordered wine (she seemed knowledgeable of the wine list) and the other a beer. Again we waited. She finally appeared with the wines and said she&#39;d be back with the beer. Again we waited. The beer arrived and she asked if we wanted to order appetizers. We ordered crab stuffed mushrooms and the beef carpaccio with arugula off the &#34;Specials&#34; menu. The &#34;busboy&#34; showed up after some time with stuffed mushrooms and bruschetta. He looked confused and asked if that was what we ordered and we said no. It was for the table next to us. Our server showed up a bit after that with our stuffed mushrooms and a caprese salad. She dropped them off and immediately went to the hostess stand and was chatting with her. My husband called to her several times but she didn&#39;t respond. Finally he went over to her and explained that we ordered carpaccio not a caprese salad. She apologized and put the order in for the correct item. At this point we ordered our entrees and another round of the same drinks. The carpaccio arrived with the second round of drinks. My wine wasn&#39;t the same as my first order. It took some doing but we flagged her down and told her that my wine wasn&#39;t what I ordered. She insisted that it was the same brand but a different year so maybe that was why it tasted different. Huh? She came back with another glass and it still wasn&#39;t like my first glass but I said nothing. The entrees came and everything was wonderful. The food is wonderful but the service sucks. After reading other reviews that state &#34;they were short staffed&#34; I have to wonder how often this happens. It was a Saturday night and the place was busy as you&#39;d expect. There was a hostess, two servers, a busboy and a guy in a cap that I assumed was the cook. I saw no one that might be a manager or owner.  The owner needs to know that their food is excellent but the service is just awful. No one was really professional about it. They kind of had the attitude that this was the norm. We got there at 7:00 and left at 10:00. Three hours to eat appetizers, two drinks and eat a meal. I might try carry out the next time because the food is that good."

The second time was what we needed to win  us over as a fan of this local spot. The first time was right after they opened and long story short I got the wrong food even after asking the server whether I was given the right dish. Fast forward a few months to last night.  First off its a great looking place and a welcome change for local fare with upscale casual atmosphere.. Both times we were here the attention to service and always paying attention to the table was totally on point.  Last night we had a server named Dominick who was awesome.  Knew a lot about the food and how it was prepared which made it a great experience.  We brought our 5yr old son and Dominick was nice enough to bring his food out early so he could get started eating.  

We had the brushetta which was one of the best we have ever eaten.  He explained to us how they roast garlic and rub the toast prior to salting and topping. He told us about the whole process which was cool.  They seem to take the approach of not trying to overkill the ingredients that they top it with. He mentioned that his dad the owner made it for us. Not sure if this is their typical version or not but I hope so.  It was brilliant. . 

I had the rigatoni carbonara with panchetta and shaved cheese...it was awesome. Really great flavor from the pancetta.  My only question is the menu says it&#39;s home made rigatoni,  but I frankly could not tell. I have house made rigatoni at another place we go to and the texture it much different.  Regardless it was very tasty here. 

My wife had the chicken asparagus with garlic mashed potatoes...... The sauce they use on it was incredible...... Talk about wanting to lick the plate..... Very very good. We also had their chicken vegetable soup..... Yeah it was also Incredible.. 

Long story short,  they have won us over after a rocky first visit..... Very happy they are here and take their customer experience so seriously. Service is key...... They got it."

The atmosphere was warm and cozy with the perfect mix of swingers, and classic background music. It&#39;s a great place for a nice dinner out. Friendly staff, wonderful prompt service. The Rigatoni Carbonara was creamy and balanced with delicious pancetta and made me want to lick the plate. The Rustic Meatball Ricotta pizza was wonderfully handcrafted and had a delicious spice thanks to house made pecorino peppers. A party of four with drinks and app can enjoy dinner for under $100. The bar made a delicious dirty martini for $6. A must visit when looking for a fine dining establishment that&#39;s not a chain!"

Right when you walk in your amazed that this place is in a strip mall and decorated perfectly. Once you sit down Rocco will make you feel like you are at home. He&#39;s very passionate about his business, food and customers more importantly. 

We started with the baked eggplant. They make their with thin slices of eggplant about 10 layers thick, covered in their tasty homemade gravy and topped with motz. Very tasty. 

Next we had the Cesar salad. Fresh, clean and very tasty. It&#39;s your basic Cesar but like all the dishes we had seasoned perfect. 

Last we shared the Meatball pie. Crust was cooked perfect, crunchy with the chew Neapolitan pizza&#39;s are known for. 

If you are looking for fresh Italian food, with great service and wonderfully decorated ambiance, this a great place to try."

The menu had some great options which made it hard to choose just one.  I went with the Sausage Giambatta.  It was so packed with flavor!  My wife got the Gnocchi with marinara sauce.  Midway through the meal, our server suggested that she try the meat sauce too.  He talked it up and brought out a bowl of their meat sauce to try at no extra charge.   It did not disappoint.  This place had great drinks, bread, entrees, and customer service.  I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

However, being a seasoned restaurant goer on all levels, they made huge errors.  First, I&#39;m not picky but I had the worst cut of NY strip in my entire life.  Too much rubbery fat in every slice. In the end, half my steak was left over because it was to tough. The sauce it was served with was great, though. Second, no bread on the table or offered. Every Italian joint has it on the table with olive oil and cheese for free.  Thirdly, with their prices you&#39;d think a soup or salad would accompany a $34 steak. Wasn&#39;t even offered.  Overall, over priced!  Love that a new place is in town, but they aren&#39;t worth the money you&#39;ll spend.  Tribella&#39;s in Batavia could teach them a few things.  Huge disappointment!"

First of all, it was NOT crowded so there&#39;s no explanation for the poor service we received. Our waiter, Daniel, took 15 min to get us our drinks. (The ONLY drink we would have bc he never came back &amp; asked us if we wanted another) He was almost invisible for the rest of the night. 

After we finished our appetizer (which was tasty) the empty dirty plate sat at our table with the menus that he never took for the rest of our meal. My boyfriend spilled his drink and the drink and ice stayed on the chair and floor for the duration of our dinner.  

I ordered carbonara with no bacon but made sure I told him I still wanted the pancetta. The carbonara came without bacon or pancetta. I couldn&#39;t find Daniel to tell him the mistake, and by the time I did find him or anyone else they took it back cold and brought it back almost immediately (cold) with a pile of pancetta thrown on the top. Luckily, my boyfriend&#39;s entrée was quite good so we shared that. 

Bottom line, the wait staff needs some more training and if an entrée is made incorrectly they shouldn&#39;t bring it back cold."

I have been there three times. All of the food was AMAZING all three times. The calamari is hands down the best I have ever had. Very light breading and VERY tender, cooked to perfection.  We have tried three pizza&#39;s and each one was delicious. The portions are large so there is plenty to take home. A friend we took said the clam and bacon pizza was the closest she has had here to authentic (she is 100% Italian) You can tell everything is fresh and put together with thought. The only slightly negative thing I have to say is the drink selection is on the pricy side.

For starters, my wife ordered an alcoholic drink and asked for no soda in the drink. She does it at every restaurant we go to and never had a problem. At this restaurant, they made the drink but decided to replace the soda with additional alcohol, and then once we are half way through our meal they come over and say we need to charge you an additional $2 for the extra alcohol we put in the drink. We never asked for extra alcohol so why put extra alcohol in there and then charge us for it? There was also lemonade in the drink they could have used more of to replace the soda. Just a tacky move on their part. It would have been different if they would have came over and asked if we wanted additional alcohol and if we are okay with the additional $2 charge. Don&#39;t wait till 20 min later and then inform us of the up charge. Secondly, our food was way over cooked. My wife got spaghetti and meatballs and I got a NY Strip. My wife&#39;s meatballs were burnt to a crisp on the outside and my steak, which was supposed to be medium, was absolutely charred and beyond well done. Bad part is we took the food to go so we didn&#39;t realize the horrible meal until we got home to eat. I&#39;m now kind of annoyed and jaded by this whole situation so it will probably be a while before we come back, if ever."

The updated decor is very nicely done so that was a good start. Very good beer selection and an interesting cocktail list was also a plus. The execution on the cocktails could use some improvement and they were overpriced.  The service was good but our waiter got a bit too friendly and crossed the line from professional to awkward as he began treating us like his buddies instead of his customers. His recommendations for entrees though were on point. The appetizer we had was bacon wrapped dates which was poorly presented with the bacon way overdone but the spicy sauce it was served with was quite good. Now the important part the entrees. All four entrees were excellent. My wifes grouper albeit quite tasty was a bit small but the other three entrees were all good portions. Considering this place is new if they iron out some of these kinks Tuscan Tavern looks set to break the curse and provide Oswego with another sorely needed independent restaurant that hits the mark on all counts. We will definitely be returning.

Usually when I eat Italian I am thinking of what I would have added to get a better flavor. I could not think of a single thing at Tuscan Tavern.
Update:We have eaten here several times now, and we have had great service all except once, when it was good service. I noticed they have an extra person helping out the servers, bringing bread, etc, so they have addressed some concerns. Folks, if ya like Italian, ya gotta try this place.

When our server brought us some bread, there was a loooong strand of hair right on top of the napkin the bread was wrapped in.  Server tried to explain the napkins are laundered externally. Someone had to pick up the napkin to put the bread into it. No one saw that very long strand? A huge factor restaurant&#39;s are judged on is cleanliness. When was the last time the windows were cleaned? The dead bugs had been there some time. I can&#39;t imagine 6-7 bugs just died at the same time just before we got there. The sewer smell at the door didn&#39;t do anything to help the matter. Just trying to figure out how clean a restaurant can be if the public areas are as described. What does the kitchen look like? Wanted to like it because the interior looks much nicer than previous restaurants and positive feedback about the food from friends. May be a while before we try again, if we do at all. Generally hope Oswego businesses succeed, but they have to do their part and keep it clean so you want to come back."

The price may look scary but this place gives more than a full serving. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were huge and there was about 3 or 4 of them. I was only able to eat a little bit over half the bowl even though I wanted to eat the whole bowl since it was so good. Also the waitor was great and the service was good.

Inside was nicely decorated and had a variety menus (food, drink, and daily specials). Our waitress was attentive and helpful in providing recommendations to us since this was our first time. We were pleased to have bread at the table when we had heard from others that they charged for it (not any more : ) ). We ordered the calimari and although the sauce was good, the calimari itself was extremely bland. My wife ordered the linguine pesce di mare which she said it was just ok. I ordered the ribeye which was one of the daily specials and itt came on a big plate with potatoes and broccoli. Although they didn&#39;t offer any soup or salad as previously mentioned in a review - they did give nice portions. Both of the sides were good - the steak was good for the most part but it was unevenly cooked and wasn&#39;t the best cut (I suppose I shouldn&#39;t have ordered steak at an italian restaurant). We were looking forward to the homemade taramisu (spelling?) as a recommendation and were shocked when it came out covered in blueberries and raspberries which completely overtook the taramisu taste. Maybe it was an off night, but we didn&#39;t experience what the others have. I&#39;d like to give it at least 3 stars based off of what others have had but our visit was more like a 2 star."

For dessert we each had the cannoli and the tiramisu.  They both were fantastic and would definitely recommend it.  Had a nice wine list also.  It&#39;s nice to have a restaurant that isn&#39;t a chain. Well worth going to.

OMG

Okay so we came in for a casual meal on my hubbys bday... It was a Tuesday and apparently Tuesday is burger night... You need to be here on a Tuesday...... It&#39;s kind of a must. 

They have special burgers of the night and I ordered one that had peanut butter, pickled green apples, and some other awesome stuff on it.  It was one of the best burgers I have had in a very long time.  Hubs and I were in love.  The young chef came out and asked me how I liked his newest creation... maybe I was the first to order it because I like trying weird things.  But his creativity is freakin amazing and I can&#39;t wait to try what he cooks up next time. Fries are deliciousssss also. 

Forget normal burgers with cheese and onions- go crazy and try something out of your comfort zone.  Then message me and tell me I&#39;m the best lol.  One day I&#39;ll try their other stuff, but for now, burger goin up.... on a Tuesday ;)"

I used to visit this location when it was Tango and thought to try out the new concept here - Latin Fusion. We were disappointed with Delirio. Our friendly server brought us to the table, came to get our order a bit later, but never inquired if we wanted something to drink. While initially friendly, our server never came back to check on us and seemed disconnected. We never even got a refill on our water until the very end of the meal. Two people had their plates cleared while the third person was halfway through their meal - when will servers be taught not to do that?

We ordered salads and one in our party also got a steak taco. Mine was the Citrus and Quinoa Salad. It was a mound of frisee. Hunting around, I found 4 small pieces of orange. It was scattered with pomegranate seeds and was dressed with a slightly creamy, slightly sweet dressing, not overwhelmingly drenched, fortunately, since I neglected to order that on the side. I kept feeling crunches as I ate and then I recalled that this salad was supposed to contain quinoa - which it did - but instead of fluffy cooked quinoa, it was a sprinkling of (probably) toasted quinoa, hard and gritty. They weren&#39;t popped open as they would be if pan toasted, so I don&#39;t know how they were prepared, but they detracted from the dish. There were a few pieces of pickled red onion. $10. For an extra $8, I could have had steak, shrimp, chicken, or salmon. Sure glad I didn&#39;t! I am used to paying high prices for simple salads, but I&#39;d recommend you steer away from this one.

Combining the poor service with the lunch I consumed, I&#39;m reluctant to try this place again."

Had the cheese fondue for an appetizer which was good, a little pricy, but good flavor. For our main course we split three tacos:
- chicken was flavorful and had a lot of meat 
- flank steak was quality meat and K&#39;s favorite 
- fish was cooked perfectly and the mango salsa was paired well

Overall enjoyed our meal and time at Delirio. Will have to try this place for dinner sometime."

It has a mix of avocado, kale, spinach, goji berries, spirulina, chia seeds and a vinaigrette. It was filling, tasty and healthy! I didn&#39;t have any protein in mine but you do have the option of adding chicken. This was my first time here and I was pleased they had a healthy option! I will come back to try other food on the menu and will keep you posted. 

The outside of the restaurant is a bit bland. I saw a couple walk up to the door but stopped and turned around and left not knowing if it was a restaurant or bar. (I overheard them) I wasn&#39;t sure either but I went inside and it looked very nice. The outside needs more decor and maybe some signs with the menu or specials. Make it more attractive for the lunch crowd. 

Other than that the place was nice my food was good and the service was friendly. Can&#39;t wait to try something else!"

We came for dinner and decided to give this place a try since it&#39;s new. The food has a farm to table concept with a Latin twist. Our waitress was very informative and kind. For an appetizer we had fried calamari with a black garlic aoli and sun roasted tomato. I really liked the black garlic aoli. It was good. For entrees, I had the pork chop and garbanzo beans very delicious. And my friend had the white fish with fried garbanzo beans and forbidden rice. It was good as well. And lastly for dessert fried churros, not bad but ok. Oh and they have an upstairs I wonder if that&#39;s for staff only, live band, or something else.

The staff was so helpful and when we told them my wife was vegan the chef made her a special plate.  She said it was better than many of the top restaurants she has been to in Chicago.  Everything we ordered was unique and memorable, the food is more decadent than anywhere else  we have been in Downtown Naperville and will go toe-to-toe with many of the top rated restaurants in the city.

We made a reservation for a Saturday night and were surprised to get there and be one of two tables on the upper floor.  In hindsight, we should have eaten at the bar as it was busier and more lively.  
So we got a bottle of wine that was good and reasonably priced.  Then we had the crab cake empanadas and the calamari to start.  The crab cake empanadas were just really bready and didn&#39;t have a good ratio of crab.  The calamari was just fine, nothing particularly special.  Then we got the charcuterie plate and I guess my feedback would be that it seemed like they tried to get too fancy with the meats by preparing them all.  I would have liked just a prosciutto, jamon or sopressata, all they have to do is slice it, but they made all the meats like pate and terrine and I just don&#39;t prefer the texture.  
Our server was great and my favorite part of the restaurant was the amazing murals on the walls.
I will probably go back sometime and sit in the bar area. If I&#39;m more impressed, I will update the review."

Nice change up from typical mango. Also with shredded kale and avocado, a chipotle Aoli, it was fantastic. My mother in law got a side garden salad which she loved! And I ordered the &#34;potato chip skins?&#34; By recommendation from the waitress. As much as I loved the fish tacos, that&#39;s how much I hated these potato skin chips, they were horrible, I felt like I was eating someone&#39;s deep fried garbage. Not good.

Decided to come here purely because it was the only place in Downtown Naperville that I&#39;d never heard of, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why - everything was fantastic! The menu was very modern, which is not at all what I expected from a place described only as Latin American. My girlfriend and I are not particularly well-versed in food terminology, and our waiter Wes was very helpful in explaining the menu items to us. The food here is not cheap and it does take some time to arrive, but it is well worth it. The chimichurri calamari came out first, perfectly crunchy and marvelously seasoned, and the black garlic aoli that came with it was divine. Next was the soft shell crab, which was a special and definitely the best dish of the night. The crab and the brown butter were complemented brilliantly by the arugula and citrus, best thing I&#39;ve eaten in some time. The whitefish was perfectly cooked, but the portion size was very small for the price. Tasted lovely though. The chickpeas had a wonderful quasi-crunchy texture and the &#39;forbidden rice&#39; (not sure exactly what that is) was really warm and rich (think homemade chili meets risotto). 

tl;dr delicious modern Latin cuisine, great service, a bit pricey but definitely worthwhile. Can&#39;t wait till my next visit!"

Except it didn&#39;t come. Until 15 mins after my husband finished his dinner because the order didn&#39;t go through. When it arrived the quinoa was gritty and under cooked - the seasonal vegetables being potatoes... So basically potatoes in quinoa. 

The manager apologized. And they gave me my meal free - which is good since it was inedible.

We made our reservations on Open Table and we were seated as soon as we came in. The hostess who sat us was also our server.  We started with the Manchego Cheese Fondue which was a white cheese fondue with chorizo, jalapeño peppers served with blue corn chips.  The favors were blended well, and it was not too spicy.  The four of use shared the appetizer and when our server noticed we only had a couple of chips left and more than enough fondue she brought over another plate of chips so we could finish.  Excellent customer service.

We than shared the Farm Salad (there was plenty to share between 2 people). The salad was fresh and loaded with squash, beets, fresh greens and pomegranates, the dressing was light and tasty.

For our main dish we had the 8oz Skirt Steak &amp; Frites.  The steak was done to perfection, med/rare with chimichurri butter. And the Frites, I am not a big French Fry eater but I couldn&#39;t stop eating them...the seasoning they were tossed in was outstanding.  A must try!

We ended our dining experience with the Deconstructed Cheesecake, and oh my goodness...it was the perfect end to a wonderful meal.  The crust was a dehydrated Twinkie and the cheesecake filling was infused with lemon rind.  It was wonderful!

I would recommend trying Delirio.  Can&#39;t wait until the summer when they have the rooftop patio open which will also have a garden to supply fresh herbs and vegetables for the chef&#39;s dishes."

I had eaten here a bunch back when it was Tango. Delirio has different owners and a different chef so while it remains to have a menu with a latin flair it is a completely different concept than Tango was. There are still a number of small plate offerings but there are just as many if not more entrée offerings on the menu. Our appetites were not huge as we went for an early dinner so we kept with several of the small plate items and a cheese board. My favorite thing on the menu was the crab cake empanada&#39;s, they were so good we ordered them as our first course and again as our last course..so we skipped dessert lol. The coffee rubbed fillet sliders are also worth mentioning, the fillet was seasoned and cooked perfectly. Our servers name was Dylan and he was great, he offered some great suggestions and he was on the ball and definitely an asset to the restaurant. We dined on the rooftop and that is my only slight complaint about Delirio, they need badly to remodel the rooftop. I love rooftop dining(who doesn&#39;t?), the rooftop at Deliro has so much potential but it is simply blah up there. If they update the rooftop I would give this place 5 stars in a heartbeat. They need to hire a designer to make their rooftop great."

He grew up in Naperville and currently lives with his family here, and has a locally-sourced menu with a lot of healthy options.  Vegetables are grown right on the South end of town.  My salad was fresh, and contained lots of unique and healthy ingredients straight from a Naperville greenhouse.  My steak (medium rare) was tender and perfectly seasoned and cooked.  I highly recommend this restaurant and its commitment to the Naperville community!"

This place has blown me away and what a fantastic addition to downtown Naperville.  I came with a group of friends on a Friday night, decently busy there wasn&#39;t a table ready for our large group at the time (seeing we didn&#39;t have reservations I wasn&#39;t surprised) so we decided to sit at the bar for a round of drinks.  The bartender-Nikki was phenomenal and was very knowledgeable about the drink menu she suggested that I try a drink titled &#34;the other woman&#34; and man was it good! Ironically named it was just the right amount of sweet with a mysterious twist leaving me thirsty for more!!! Not even 15 min later our table was ready.  We were seated and greeted by our server Kristen she was so bubbly and energetic, she described various dishes so eloquently and made everything sound so enticing! We tried just about everything but I have to rave about a few things the first is the Roasted Marrow it was so delicious and melted Like butter on the mini baguettes it was served with. The second dish that is a must try is the Ribeye with the optional queso fresco lime crust.  The steak was so tender it practically melted in my mouth! And last but definitely not least is the most unique &#34;food&#34; dish I&#39;ve ever tried... The Margarita Compressed Watermelon this is a MUST try just beware or the tequila balls they will sneak up on you! Unfortunately I did not get to try any of the desserts but I will be back that&#39;s for sure!"

So we checked out the Delrio menu and figured it was in the same kinda vein as tapas and worth a shot.  Since we wanted the small plate experience, we only ordered from the small plate menu so I can&#39;t comment on the actual entrees.
The two plates we had that are on the menu were the Chimicurri fried calamari and the compressed watermelon.  The watermelon was much better in concept that in actuality, but it&#39;s not too pricey and the ball of tequila thing was....interesting.  The Watermelon seemed watermelony and they had some interesting dustings (like tachini I believe) that I wouldn&#39;t have thought to mix that went well together.
The calamari was nothing special but, my god, the two aioli sauces were unbelievable.  I mean, probably good enough where I&#39;d go back there just for that aioli if everything else was nothing special.
The  other plates were a scallop ceviche in lime sauce with fish skin bits that was very good, and they also had their take on poutin that was ok.  But really good dipped in that dang aioli I mentioned above!
We finished it off with a dessert of churros covered in chocolate and served on an amazing Meyer lemon sauce which was the perfect combination of sweet and sour.  
Our server was very nice, helpful, and attentive.  So combining that with the overall food and price, definitely a place we&#39;ll go in the future."

I love Steak Frites $28 and two of us ordered that with the skirt steak as that&#39;s the way it&#39;s normally served.  It was tough and not juicy.  Our waitress than said if your not happy with it, let me get you something else and I guessed the option was another steak.  Filets came and we&#39;re very good..  When I got the bill $257.79 w/o tip, I peruse it as I normally do as there were 4 of us and saw 1 filet at $39, 1 at $41 and another at $44 , veggies @ $5 etc.  I didn&#39;t want to raise a scene by questioning the waitress, but I will never go back!!"

I have to say this is the cleanest, most organized fast-food restaurant I have ever visited! It is sparkling clean. Even the condiment packets are arranged nicely in the trays. For me, that shows a major dedication to detail. 
And the staff... what can I say.... overall outstanding! I felt like I was in a full-service place and not a fast food place. 
The food is good, hot and fast. I am a beef guy, but the chicken sandwiches are good. The price reflects the quality. You will not get super cheap prices here like Burger King or Mc&#39;D&#39;s.. and that is because the food is quality.

My most recent idiot brought me through the drive-thru. There are two ordering lanes, so this keeps everything moving for the most part. I redeemed my free sandwich (from the mobile app) with no issues. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich because I had never gotten that before. Although the sandwich comes with no cheese or sauce, I was pleasantly surprised to find that none of that was needed. It was definitely one of the best, if not the best, fast food chicken sandwich I&#39;ve ever had. The bread was very tasty, the chicken was moist and seasoned perfectly with a slight hint of lemon, and the lettuce and tomato were fresh.

But when coming through the drive-thru around 8:00pm I was not so impressed with the service here. I waited in line for a good amount of time. Once I got to the window I wasn&#39;t greeted very nicely, which was weird because it was a manager who greeted me....they read my order very fast, in a way I couldn&#39;t understand and felt I was being harassed and disrespected. When the manager gave me my food, my bag almost spilled everywhere in my car. Because of the disappointing service I checked my bag to make sure everything was in there. When I noticed there was only one ranch sauce in the bag I asked for another one and the manager took a second to give me a dirty look and turned around, grabbed a ranch packet, and basically threw into through my car window. I am extremely disappointed in the service here and surprised that a manager would treat me in such an un-kind way.

Yes, the chicken is moist and tasty, but the waffle fries were not cooked completely.  I hate mushy fries.

Also, it was the dinner hour rush and there was only one person behind the counter taking orders.  There were plenty of people filling the orders because before I could even put my change away, my order was ready.  I guess that explains the under cooked fries.

No one was out in the dining room area cleaning and asking patrons if they needed anything, like in Wheaton.  So, I will just have to visit another Chick-fil-A to average it all out."

Sometimes, it seems like the people here are TOO nice. 

As for the food, the spicy chicken sandwich is delicious (albeit not that spicy). Their hand-spun milkshakes (especially cookies and cream) are to die for! Overall, this Chick-fil-a has delicious food and top-notch service.

It&#39;s their gimmick, and they do a great job with it.  Such a pleasant service alternative to being verbally berated at the McDonald&#39;s down the street.  I&#39;ve only been through the drive-through here, probably more often than I should.  

For breakfast, I&#39;ve had their spicy chicken biscuit. Can&#39;t say I&#39;m a huge fan, just too dry, even with some honey.  I do like their spicy chicken burrito.  Always made fresh, and comes with eggs, chopped spicy breaded chicken, and mix of roasted peppers and onions.  Make sure to get a packet of the smokey flavored salsa to top it off with. The hash browns are nothing that great, possibly on par with Burger King&#39;s.  Same with their coffee, I am more partial to the stuff an McDonald&#39;s.

For luch/dinner, I&#39;ve partaken in the spicy chicken sandwich.  Not much, just spicy breaded chicken on a bun with pickles.  I do love their chicken nuggets though.  Unlike other places, they use whole chunks of chicken, not a mystery chicken part mince.  The breading may be a bit soggy, but it tastes good all the same.  The waffle fries are usually a little too soft for my liking, but if you dip them in the special Chick-fil-A sauce, it is all good.  Their sweet tea is the best , and their fresh lemonade is a close second, (If you don&#39;t like pulp in your drink, you will not like their lemonade.)

It&#39;s fast food with a happy twist to it.  A nice addition to the fast food family in Bolingbrook."

You should also try the spicy chicken sandwich if you like such food. I really don&#39;t have complaints. I&#39;ve experienced a long wait in drive thru before though.

It has some things I haven&#39;t experienced at a fast food joint in a long time. The staff are genuinely polite,and I felt like I was in a Church of Chicken. Ordering was painless, getting it was quick and they walk it out to you. Then they will pass by every 5 mins to see if you need a refill or anything you need. I thought Ned Flanders was in the kitchen pumping everyone up. 

The Chicken sandwich is mighty good, and the waffle fries take me back to elementary school. This place is like a Culvers, except chicken is their thang. The decor and the layout is a little different, Hell, even the parking lot is different.

The drive through took over 10 minutes, and not because they were insanely busy, there were 3 cars ahead of mine. Their customer service is among the worst I&#39;ve seen. Again, not an indictment against the entire chain, only this one. Once I finally got to the window, I had already said I had a coupon for a free Grilled Chicken when I&#39;d ordered, only to get charged full price once I got to the window. When I showed them the coupon, the window person got visibly upset, but did bring his manager over to refund my money. It wouldn&#39;t have happened if you&#39;d taken 3 seconds to LOOK at what I&#39;d ordered, especially since I was quoted the price after the coupon. Once I finally get past the drive through, no ketchup in the bag, no salt on the waffle fries. Come on. Every Chick-fil-a I&#39;ve been to does that, and on top of not being able to correctly price my order, you couldn&#39;t&#39;ve put a couple ketchups in there??

But I took the family there for dinner (6 of us) and ordered.  Meals for 5 of us came out in a normal period of time.  I waited fo the last one for about 8 minutes before engaging the manager or owner.  I told him to give me a refund for the last meal as my family was almost done with their dinner (we were rushing to get to a soccer game).  He went to the back and got me my meal which took another few minutes.  I told him I did not want to eat alone, the &#34;experience&#34; was unacceptable and to just refund my money for the ONE meal.  To be honest, if he gave me my $5 I would have just grabbed something later and not be here writing this.  But instead, he gave me a coupon for a free sandwich.  No refund.  I had to eat very quickly alone while my family waited.  

My kids like Chick-fil- but we will travel the extra few miles to the Naperville store next time if they want it that much.  But to be honest, with all the fastfood choices, I see no need to go back."

I will say the service here is fantastic.  All of the guys behind the bar are friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.  The food has some hits and some misses and nothing really will blow you away.  People rave about the fritters, which I don&#39;t really understand.  The texture of them is actually on point.  Light and crispy but they have virtually no flavor.  But there is arugula with it so that&#39;s a plus.  I tried the scallops and mine were actually undercooked.  I realize how difficult it is to cook a scallop perfectly but still.  The filet bites were pretty solid.  Definitely the standout to me is the buffalo shrimp.  I will get these every time I am in there.  They also have a good wine list."

This was 3 scallops (not fresh) served over cold corn risotto.  Inedible - I had to send it back.   It&#39;s an expensive entree though, just 3 scallops.   Instead, I had the pork &#34;wings&#34; which are bone-in pork shanks that are trimmed to look like chicken drummettes, served with a sweet Asian chili glaze.  Those were pretty good.

I was so excited to try a few of their items on the menu &amp; hoped it was going to be amazing.  Because it was my birthday,  the hubs made me choose for him too... man, there was so much pressure to make sure I was  choosing right! 

We started with stuffed dates &amp; steak bites. 
The dates were good,  but average &amp; the price was a bit steep for the size of appetizer.
The steak bites on the other hand were amazing! So full of flavor &amp; perfectly cooked!

So moving on to the entrees... they were okay. Nothing special like I was hoping for.  

We ordered the halibut with risotto special &amp; scallops with pork belly &amp; risotto.  

The halibut &amp; scallops were good (they were both just a little under done but not worth complaining about), but the risotto on both dishes were so bland,  even salt &amp; pepper wouldn&#39;t fix it. Oh &amp; the &#34;pork belly&#34; was very small, overcooked, diced pieces scattered around the plate. A total let down! Next time I&#39;ll ask what their definition of pork belly is before ordering.  

Will I go back? Eh, not sure.  The price of the bill did not match our experience.  I guess they may be worth another shot,  we&#39;ll see."

The service was standard - nothing special to note. The food was simply amazing. We started with the twice baked fritters which were out of this world. I had the panko crusted chicken and the bf had beer can chicken. Both were great choices but the panko definitely won the battle. Would definitely go back.

We enjoy the steak bites in the appetizer (my daughter&#39;s favorite), the custom cocktails are tasty and stiff, and the desserts are delicious, especially the croissant bread pudding, bananas foster style.  Plus, as early bird eaters with our little kids, the wait staff is very accommodating and understanding.  After that, though, the prices are pretty high and the salads and entrees can be hit or miss, sometimes just as a matter of execution.

Take, for example, the grilled romaine salad.  In concept, this could be really good, but instead of char to the greens, it is more wilted.  The rest of the salad is good, with the shaved parmesan and the dressing, but the last thing I want in a salad is wilted greens.  

The burger is OK, but the bun is not hearty enough to stand up to the meat, and by the time you are halfway through eating it, the bun is a disintegrated mess ( and I generally eat fast, which means yours might disintegrate a few bites into it).  So, while the flavor is really good, it can be lost in the experience of holding a soggy mess.  DMK does a good job of avoiding this even though their burgers are far more elaborate and prone to become a fork and knife endeavor.  So, if you don&#39;t mind eating a burger with a fork and knife (and if you don&#39;t, you probably also eat your candy with a fork and knife, George Costanza), it won&#39;t bother you, but I can&#39;t fathom that at all.

Finally, I want to highlight their soups.  They have a baked french onion as a regular on the menu, and then a soup titled &#34;yesterday&#39;s soup.&#34;  On most visits, I get the French onion.  It is very good, well above average, with good cheese and onion ratios.  However, be warned that the soup&#39;s flavor profile is on the onion sweet side, as opposed to the cheese savory side.  Last visit, I got &#34;yesterday&#39;s soup;&#34; it was black bean and bacon, and wow was this good.  I would put this soup right up with Neat&#39;s beer and cheese soup (which also has bacon . . . hmmm).  I guess I like bacon.

Anyway, all in all, we really enjoy Tally&#39;s for their appetizers, soups, drinks and desserts, and for those alone, it is above average.

Grades:  Food - B; Cocktails - B-plus; Service - B; Desserts - A-Minus.

Overall - B-Plus."

It&#39;s a frustrating experience spending your entire meal trying to find a waiter who is nowhere to be found. 

Food: Food is good though if you&#39;re willing to deal with very mediocre service. It would be even better if it was warmer for not sitting around getting cold because no one can bring it to the table.

We decided to try it since we were in the neighborhood. Although I did enjoy the ambiance there were many things lacking for a place at this price point. It wasn&#39;t super expensive but priced well enough that you expect a certain level of service. We were relieved to arrive before the dinner rush thinking that would mean we wouldn&#39;t have to wait too long for our food. We waited about 10 minutes for our flat-bread appetizer which isn&#39;t bad at all. But we did wait 40 minutes to get our actual entrees after that. I&#39;m convinced the waiter forgot about us because two tables that arrived after us, with larger parties, got served before us. I ordered the salmon which came with a pesto risotto. The risotto literally had a thick film over it from &#34;sitting&#34; and the salmon was barely warm. My boyfriend&#39;s steak was barely warm and the fries that came with it were cold and hard. When asked how everything was by the waiter, I stated that the food was pretty cold and all he stated was &#34;Really? That&#39;s strange. Can I get you a refill on your drinks?&#34; I thought that was funny- The old &#39;let me change the subject&#39; tactic.

Tim Robbins - or the manager/owner (not sure which) who looks like him - makes me feel like he is doing us a favor by having us eat at Tally&#39;s. He doesn&#39;t smile, no welcoming attitude.

I always drove by this place and finally decided to try it. There&#39;s lots of free parking around the restaurant. The place is small and I went on a weeknight and got a table right away. I would make reservation on weekend to be safe. You can do it through yelp. The place has a modern and classy look to it.

There&#39;s lots of healthy options and you can exchange fries for veggie of the day for a $2 fee. They have a large and unique menu. We ordered the talleys salad which was delicious- wish it had more avocado though. The wheat bread at the table is curly and fun looking like a stick but was sort of hard. I ordered the tea with vodka and it was good but too much orange flavor. We split the steak and chicken- my friend liked it but I thought it was kind of crunchy. Mashed potatoes and green beans were creamy and amazing.

Given our discontent you&#39;d think they would let it fly, afterall do buttered noodles set them back that much.  We ordered plenty of overpriced food and drinks. For our neighbors they did not honor what was written on their website.  When it was shown to them they just said, &#39;we are not doing that anymore&#39;.  Terrible! We will not return out of principle.  False advertising is shady.
Overall the food was sort of your upscale bar fare.  Overpriced, for what you are getting but I thought it was good. Cute decor."

As of last night, we are done dining there.  We invited our friends who have two kids to meet us at Talley&#39;s for dinner last night (Sunday).  Based on their website and menu at the restaurant, Sunday is SUPPOSED to be a night where kids eat free.  Well, this certainly was not the case last night.  There were four adults and four kids at our table.  The food/meal was good accept for when the bill came.  We noticed the waitress charged us for two kids.  We questioned this and her answer was that their POS system could not split up tables and she cannot delete the two kids meals from our bill.  We did not want to argue with her.  I called the manager after we left the restaurant.  He gave me the same answer that the waitress gave me.  

The bottom line is that this has nothing to with the money.  The website and menu both state:           
SUNDAYS - KIDS EAT FREE!
Come join use every Sunday for family night where kids eat free!
* limit 2 kids/adult and 1 kids meal/child

WE WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE."

Talley&#39;s completely saved the day! They seated us right away despite not having a reservation. We had great drinks in cute copper mugs that we&#39;re totally going to buy on Amazon. Our entrees were amazing. I recommend the rib-eye and my husband ate every bite of his salmon and spinach risotto (which I stole a few bites of). Service was excellent as well. Our waitress was helpful and friendly and made us feel completely welcome. There was even live music towards the end of the night which we really enjoyed.

The staff is very friendly and makes you feel comfortable during your dining experience.  Same goes for the owner who is always willing to resolve any issues, which I personally have never experienced any, aside being stuffed from the generous portions! 
The food is always excellent; I&#39;ve never had a bad dish here!  My personal favorite, and recommendation, would be to start with the buffalo shrimp for an appetizer and have the panko crusted chicken for an entrée.  Also their variation on the classic French onion soup is a must-have!  
Overall it is a great place to stop in for a quick meal at the bar but also for a relaxed sit-down meal.  I have and will keep on going back, even if just to have a drink and chat with the wonderful staff!"

We could,&#39;t even slide into our table without asking the man behind us to stand up and move his chair, (so we could slide our chair out to get into it). After we both sat back down, our chairs, heads and shoulders were all bumping into each other. There was no relief in space at all.  6 inches literally separated the bar chairs from the dining chairs. We got up and asked to be moved. We were then offered a table right at the front door and reception area. Why would anyone sit there? Why would you even put a seat there, unless you wanted us to answer the phone and help seat people? Next, offered a seat in a dark corner surrounded by walls, very dimly lit. We said not for us and left. At no time were we offered any one of the three tables set for 4. May have great food, but ambiance is also part of the experience.

Hands down the best restaurant I have eaten at in Clarendon Hills.  The place has very warm decor, with seductively comfortable atmosphere, steeped in romance. My girlfriend was instantly impressed.  Like any good &#34;Date Night&#34; we started off with cocktails.  She got the watermelon margarita with jalapeno salt and I started off with &#34;El Burro&#34;, a play on the Moscow Mule... Tito&#39;s Vodka and Ginger Beer.  All I can say is WOW!  My girlfriend and I instantly began swapping cocktails which we both absolutely loved!!!  They were well-thought-out and masterfully mixed allowing you to taste every component while dazzling the entire palette.

We started off with the grilled Caesar salad and the chilled avocado soup.  It was LOVE at first spoonful.  The chilled avocado soup was smooth and silky and a perfect choice for the hot summer night.  Arguably the most genius soup I have ever had... the maker of the soup needs an award!!!  Of course I was not going to let my girlfriend have the salad all to herself.  The grilled Caesar was &#34;Cage-fight Over The Salad Good&#34;!  Fortunately, my girlfriend was in a sharing mood which helped me avoid getting beaten up in public by her.  The light-char on the romaine leaves provided a unique taste and the dressing was another over-the-top concoction... they should bottle that dressing and sell it!

Needless to say, we were excited about our entrees.  I decided on the Lobster roll... being a Bostonian, when I see lobster my mouth begins to order before my brain can ever stop it... which I am fine with.  My better half got the scallops.  All good dates require a bottle of wine and my girlfriends mouth dropped and eyes went &#34;deer-in-the-headlights-wide&#34; as she perused the list.  She declared &#34;If we open a restaurant we are stealing this list!&#34;.  The list is well-thought-out with classic bottles as well as some harder finds, and some very impressive &#34;Celebratory Bottles&#34; perfect for the anniversary or the closing of the &#34;Business Deal&#34; with partners.  We decided on the Domaine Serene... an impeccable Pinot Noir.

Our entrees arrives and I instantly became nostalgic... the lobster roll was nearly an identical replica of the East Coast staple, but taken to the next level.  First of all, it is HUGE!  The bun was perfectly buttered and toasted on the sides and they even put the sprinkle of paprika to make the roll pop in color.  It was &#34;Love at First Bite&#34; for me.  Honestly, if I didn&#39;t think my man-boobs would explode out of my shirt, I would have ordered two more of them.  My girlfriend&#39;s scallops were drop-dead gorgeous.  They had the perfect golden sear and were laid atop a bed of corn risotto and sprinkled with bacon lardons and garnished with celery leaves.  Watching her face, I saw her bite, close her eyes, and and sigh with satisfaction.  I instantly snagged half of a scallop and an spoonful of the risotto before she could reopen her eyes.  Simply the best food I have ever stolen off of her plate.  The scallop was sweet, the risotto was creamy, and the bacon lardons added a well-balanced flavor.  PERFECTION ON A PLATE!!!

I was almost sad as we neared the end of our entrees.  This was truly one of the best dates we have had in our 6 years together... how could it get better??? CHERRY PEACH COBBLER, that&#39;s how!!!  I am not even a &#34;Cobbler Guy&#34;, but this was the most impeccable way to end the night.  This is a cobbler Martha Stewart would steal and call her own.

Needless to say we will be back!  if they served breakfast, we would have slept in the cars so we could have been the first in line.  Talley&#39;s is the perfect place for... ANYONE!!!  Families, dates, night-caps, special events.... really any excuse to get back there will work for me!"

They only had a high table available at the &#34;bar&#34; area. I use quotes because the bar has 3 maybe 4 chairs and there are a few high top tables.  The place is sort of cramped but we didn&#39;t mind.  Note:  It&#39;s hard to hang at the bar if you had to wait for a table--there is really no room to stand if you don&#39;t have a seat---but onto the food....
Food:
Dish #1--the special of the day --Bone in dry aged Rib Eye with Chimichuri sauce (made with bacon and I can&#39;t remember what else) price $35-45 ( I don&#39;t remember exactly but my husband thought it was expensive--I didn&#39;t for the amount of meat and the excellent preparation) Note: price was not disclosed when &#34;specials&#34; were read. It was the most expensive dish they offered. 
Comments:  It was excellent!! How many times do you have steak that is either good or bad?  This is the first I&#39;ve had in awhile that was also extremely flavorful.  There was no bacon taste at all to the Chimichuri sauce, but it was possibly the best sauce I&#39;ve ever had with a steak.  It was just drizzled over the top but so so so good.  I noticed that their regular menu has the exact same dish with a pork tenderloin---I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be disappointed with it.
Dish #2--Gnocci Caprese w/ garlic--excellent, not too hard or soft--great consistency.  Comment: Just enough on my plate.  Not enough for leftovers but enough for dinner.  I appreciated this because Gnocci is a heavy dish and I don&#39;t like to have too much of it.  Perfect portion and great cost $16
Dish#3  Bruschetta tray with 3 choices--we picked--traditional w/ tomatoes, a spinach and artichoke, and the special of the day which was strawberry and goat cheese.  
Comments:  Another excellent flavorful dish--my only complaint with this was that it was a little pricey at $12 and they were all warm.  I am not used to having warm bruschetta especially the one with the strawberries.  I would have enjoyed them more if they were cold.
Comment #4--our Waitress--I think her name was Sybil--she was exceptional too!  I have pretty high standards for calling a waitress exceptional and she was.  She did an excellent job, knew the menu, knew the flavors and was very attentive.
Comment#5--Margarita rocks was excellent--not too tangy, not too much alcohol.  Could be a little bit larger. It was finished in about 4 sips.

I really hope this restaurant is around for awhile.  It was one of the few  places I&#39;ve added to my &#34;go to&#34; place"

My family ate there this last Friday (first one you were open).  The food all tasted very good, we had the red pepper bruschetta, the beet salad with shrimp, the whitefish and the children&#39;s cheese burger.

The service was very good, which honestly was a surprise for the second day the restaurant was officially open, and also an improvement upon Redd Herring (Not sure why, never got great service there, even though I recognize a lot of faces in the current staff.  It was never unfriendly, just slow and a bit unattentive).

In general the food was very good.  The bruschetta was very good.  The whitefish was good, cooked well and the jicama slaw was great.  The kids cheeseburger tasted great.  I&#39;m usually a huge fan of beet salad, but this one was just ok and the shrimp was not great (not bad, just not good). 

I think a few things would need to change for Talley&#39;s to be really successful in the area.  Obviously, just my opinion, but this is what would keep me coming back.  I think the food is very good, but everything is just a little over-priced, and there needs to be a bigger selection of child friendly and/or lower priced entrees.

Getting two pieces of bruschetta (basically just bread and some kind of simple topping) for $8 seemed like quite a mark-up.  I would be happy paying $8 for the starter, but would expect about twice the bruschetta that I got.  

The beet salad with shrimp was priced like an entree salad ($15) but was the size of a side salad.  My wife got this for her meal, and had to eat as soon as we got home.  If the other salads are similar, there are no true entre salads, which is dissapointing.  In my opinion, there should be at least 2 or 3 salads that you could order for a meal and be satisfied.  

The whitefish was very good, and fairly well priced, although for a cheap species of fish, I would expect about $16 instead of $18.  There was a good amount of fish though, and I would still order it again at $18.

The Kids cheesburger was probably the best value.  It was very good, a decent size and well priced.

There are many young families in town.  I think to attract the families looking for a nice, but casual dinner with children (which I think you need to do to be successful in CH), you need more of a sandwich section and more lower-cost, kid friendly entres.  Something like the pizzas from Redd Herring would be really good too, we will definitley miss those and it was nice to have a simple, filling menu choice around $12.

I think the new layout of the bar area is great.  It would be a great place to stop in for a few beers with friends.  To come frequently though, I would look for some daily specials and/or a slightly bigger selection.  The beer selection was good, but small.  The prices were ok, but if I was going to come frequently I would look for some specials so I wasn&#39;t always paying $6 - $8 a beer."

We made a reservation for 7:30 weeks in advance. When we arrived we were told it was going to be a &#34;little while&#34; when my fiancé (holding our 2yr old daughter) asked how long a &#34;little while&#34; was the hostess, or whoever she was, replied with &#34;a half hour or so&#34; she then pointed to one of the many other couples and said they all had 7:15 reservations! I&#39;ve worked in and ran multiple restaurants and I know this is a result of poor management, poor planning and sheer lack of experience. Considering it was freezing and there was no room to even stand around and wait for our table, we left. Our daughter wouldn&#39;t take too kindly waiting OUTSIDE for over a half hour in 30 degree weather. We will not come back and it is a shame because we live walking distance from downtown Clarendon hills and we love to dine out. I think we&#39;ll stick to Scappa. Too bad Town Kitchen is not there anymore, I used to love that place as a kid. Talleys, please, please, please, pay attention to your reservation book, or become one of the many restaurants that did not make it in that location."

My boyfriend and I were visiting a friend in Schaumburg while checking out neighborhoods for a possible move to the Chicago area.  Since she knew our village here in Seattle, she thought Clarendon Hills was enough like Magnolia to send us to a restaurant there.  As a thank you, I wanted to take her to Talley&#39;s since we like it so much!

We started off with the TKB 75. I love gin and St. Germaine is all the rage so needless to say, this bubbly concoction was so good I had two.  My friend is pregnant so the bartender made her some virgin drink and put it in martini glass and she appreciated the gesture.  

We started with the shrimp fritters with remoulade, corny, shrimpy, spicy sauce.  They really hit the spot. For our salad course we got the beets and the baby blue.  I like the warm goat cheese with the cold beets and cress has to be one of my favorite greens, so I loved it.  J got the blue cheese salad said it was great, I didn&#39;t try it since blue cheese isn&#39;t for me, but the touch of the balsamic on the plate made for a beautiful presentation.

I so wanted to go for the scallops again but opted for something different, the pork tenderloin. Sweet spicy sauce, rich polenta cake, juicy pork, and charred asparagus, yum! J had the chicken sandwich, she was craving fries. HUGE!! Arugula, aioli, delightful with crisp had cut fries.  They don&#39;t have a half bottle selection so I opted for the Matilda on tap.  The had a nice bottled beer selection as well.  

For dessert we went for the chocolate cake. All I can say about this is I bought a second one to go because my boyfriend, the choco-holic, had to try it.  

If we do decide to move to the area, we will be Talley&#39;s new regulars!!"

The food was good- I ordered the scallops which were perfectly done but needed some seasoning.  There were a few small chunks of pork belly (bacon)&#39; but not enough to give the scallops any punch.  however, they were perfectly seared and very buttery in flavor.  The accompanying risotto was excellent but it was all a little bland.  Our party was 8 women and I think that we were all happy but not &#34;wowed&#34; with the food.  Our server seemed to want to be anywhere else but serving us- no refills on iced tea, no offers of coffee, irritation at having to prepare 8 separate checks even though he added a 20% gratuity to each check and had known before we even sat down that this was our request.  He was completely unwilling to do any substitutions even if we offered to pay or them.  Tried the bread pudding for dessert which was tasty but should have been a little warmer.  The restaurant was not busy so his attitude was very odd.  

I doubt that I&#39;ll be back even though I was hopeful for a fun new place in Clarendon Hills."

I have tried Talley&#39;s twice now and unfortunately haven&#39;t found it to be worth the expense.  The first time I tried the lobster roll (one of my favorite dishes so I was excited to see it on the menu).  It was incredibly small and I think they put crab meat in it vs. lobster (both of which were minimal) to try and fill it out. It said on the menu it was an &#34;authentic new england lobster roll&#34; but it really didn&#39;t even come close (as someone who has eaten MANY new england lobster rolls).  There was more filler (celery) than meat.  I would prefer that they just charged me more for it but actually put some lobster meat in it!  I also asked it they could substitute something other than fries for the side but they really didn&#39;t have any other option!
On my second trip I tried the scallops.  Decent but the portions once again were incredibly small (3 scallops total).  One of my scallops was undercooked.  We left hungry after spending quite a bit.
Overall I don&#39;t really see how this restaurant will succeed vs. the previous concept? (Red Herring)  There really isn&#39;t a noticeable change other than some menu tweaks.
The kids menu is fine although it would be great if they could serve a side dish like fruit or veggie?"

First of all, each time I walk in, the woman (manager or owner) always greets us promptly. If it isn&#39;t crowded, then they tell you to sit wherever you like. Of the six times I have dined there, all but once we were seated in Isabelle&#39;s section. She is so friendly and nice, and always prompt to get our drink order and dinner order. She always checks up on how our dinner is just the right amount of times--never too much, never too little.

My husband and I like Bucho&#39;s because it is authentic Mexican food done simply. I mean no offense to anyone, but when the portion of restaurant&#39;s diners are 50% - 80% Hispanic, then you know it is good authentic food. 

Portions are always generous--bring your appetite. Dinners are usually served with complimentary chips and salsa, plus complimentary soup and pickled vegetables. And the margaritas are huge!

The only slight negative... this was the first time trying the Tamales and it was 3/4 masa and 1/4 meat, and a bit dry, but I remedied that by plopping a spoonful of salsa on it :)  I am used to Tamales with a 50%-50% ratio of meat and masa."

First let me start by saying the food wasn&#39;t horrible, but it also wasn&#39;t great. I&#39;m suprised this is supposedly related to Lalo&#39;s because Lalo&#39;s is much, much, much better! The food came out literally 2 minutes after ordering and was cold. Salsa was extremely spicy. If I could give no stars, I would. Customer service is the worst I&#39;ve ever seen. &#34;Alisha&#34; the big, tall, blonde was our waitress. I asked politely if I could get an extra soup and I would pay extra. I got a great big eye roll and was told &#34;I guess.&#34; My daughter had asked for a water right away because the salsa was so spicy. My daughter had asked for ice. The guy brought two more waters (both with ice) but apparently Alisha thought we had too much water and snatched  it up and said &#34;You don&#39;t need all these waters.&#34; After I complained &#34;Maria&#34; the supposed owner/manager (who never even apologized) gave us another waitress and that girl they sent to our table to take over for Alisha was wonderful. Great waitress! That&#39;s the only good part. As I was leaving I was told by Alisha that I was a Bitch. The owner/manager was informed and just shrugged her shoulders. Never once apologized. Oh, the place was also filthy, especially the bathroom. I will never return, I&#39;ll drive the extra way to go to Lalo&#39;s any day. These people should be ashamed of themselves."

So I head in to this small Mexican restaurant and there is about a 15 minute wait on a Friday night at 6pm...not bad I think. I strike up a conversation with a couple waiting in front of me and they say this is the best Tex-Mex in the area... Nice praise, can&#39;t wait to try it. I ordered a medium classic margarita, love them....but, while there was quite a lot of alcohol in it, I have had better. The salsa with chips is some of the best I have ever had! The chicken veggie soup was ok, nothing outstanding, but the chicken mole burrito was yummy. The retried beans and Spanish rice were just ok. I also had sopapillas for dessert and while not to the standards of New Mexico, they were fine and also yummy. The waitress was AWESOME! I highly recommend dining here, but maybe I will try a different margarita than the classic."

We ordered kids meals which give you the option of fries or rice as a side but they didn&#39;t have any fries and like I said the rice very plain tasting so my kids wouldn&#39;t eat it .

I will safely assume that this used to be a part of the local Lalo&#39;s chain, since a Google search still lists the menu for Lalo&#39;s here.  With only a few changes, the menu is still the same.

When you walk in the foyer you first see a dusty window display of collectibles and crafts for sale, and it looks to me like the merchandise is not exactly flying off the shelves.  I came for dinner though, not shopping.

The food was pretty darned good! I had the most tender carne asada dinner here that I can recall.  Cooked perfectly, and tender enough to be sliced with a fork.  The enchilada served on the side was kind of a tasteless gloppy mess in comparison.  You are also given chips, salsa, and a cup of soup with each meal.  The soup may be the biggest reason to return here.  Clearly homemade with shreds of chicken and lots of vegetables!"

I&#39;ve never had a better Margarita. The complimentary consommé should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and simply walking through the door puts me in a better mood. 
Unfortunately, I don&#39;t get to Lalo&#39;s nearly as often as I used to, and when I do, Wife must be driving, &#39;cos I have NO self control when it comes to asking for a second Huge Margarita. Plus, Lalo&#39;s is a hefty drive from Stately Breakwind Manor.
Back in the day, I was good friends with Don Lalo Castaneda and all his Brothers. When the resto decided to expand, each Brother was put in charge of a branch, with Bucho helming the one in Bolingbrook.
It was a Lalo&#39;s in all its glory. In fact, it was rumored the Bolingbrook joint had the best quality food of all the Lalo&#39;s everywhere. Sure was pretty good to me
I&#39;m sure there was some sound business logic to strip the Lalo&#39;s name from the store, but it hit me with some irrational voodoo. What if Bucho went rogue? God-forbid, Change the Margarita recipe? Stayed away for many years. Like an idiot.
Wife unit had come down with a hellish Cold. &#34;Some Lalo&#39;s soup would hit the spot&#34;, but a long-ass drive to deepest Berwyn was out of the question. I peeked over here at Yelp, and saw many menchens of the complimentary Consommé. and The Margaritas.
So here we are at Bucho&#39;s. 
If Lalo&#39;s is the Rolls-Royce, Bucho&#39;s is the Bentley.
It&#39;s basically Lalo&#39;s, with all the attendant glory. 
The Consommé is divine, The Margaritas are right, and the rest of the Menu looks proper.
Maybe not the kicky party atmosphere that has informed Lalo&#39;s in the past, but when I think about it, I haven&#39;t run amok in Lalo&#39;s for many many years. I think the carnival atmosphere was courtesy of the erstwhile MaitreD&#39;s Alex and Ulises, plus our never-ending youthful predilection to raise hell. Now we come to dine and enjoy a gentle cocktail.
Bucho&#39;s is back on the list, near the very top, as I sit back and smile..."

Sure the Margaritas were sizable, but the food was overpriced and sub-par. 

Before your meal is served you are treated to chips and salsa, spicy carrots and Cauliflower, and a bowl of chicken soup. All of this was AMAZING! So, you would expect the food to follow suit, but that is where you would be wrong fellow traveler. The burrito was small and bland, especially for the price.

What was bad: I ordered the nachos with chicken, which is a fairly safe order when you&#39;re checking out a Mexican restaurant that&#39;s new to you.  I was profoundly disappointed. They cook their nachos with the cheese right on top of the chips, with all other toppings going on top of the cheese. By the time I received my order, the cheese had completely cooled, so I had to fight with solid cheese to even pull out a chip. Because the cheese had congealed, all of the chips were too soggy to hold toppings and were impossible to eat. I had to use the chips that were in the basket on the table in order to create a nacho.

If that weren&#39;t enough, my husband&#39;s pork burrito lacked flavor; there were fruit flies that I was having to constantly shoo away from my food; and we both were fighting with nausea the rest of the day. :(

I did take the time to show the waitress the state of my nachos, and, thankfully, she took them off the tab, which is part of why I&#39;m giving 2 stars and not 1."

We enjoyed coming here every Friday or Saturday night. Our usual dining experience consisted of at least 3 margaritas apiece, an appetizer, usually Queso Fundido followed by a couple of tacos and maybe a tamale or cheese enchilada. A couple of weeks ago we ordered the usual Queso Fundido appetizer and when it arrived the cheese had separated into a curdled mess sitting in a pool of grease, the beans had no taste but the margaritas were still outstanding. When it came time to order dinner we ordered our usual two tacos, two tamales and a cheese enchilada. At that point the waitress informed us Buchos had a new policy they no longer offered ala carte portions. So we ordered a taco dinner and a enchilada dinner, we did not eat the appetizer. When the taco dinner arrived the tacos had  raw green peppers and onions inside them. The chicken enchiladas had no Verde sauce or sour cream and were very dry. Not wanting to send everything back we asked to go containers to take home and throw out.  I went to pay the bill and complain about the meal but had to wait while another customer was complaining about the service and the quality of their food. When it came my turn I asked why they had started putting green peppers and onions on their tacos. She told  me they did not put green peppers or onions on their tacos. She called the waitress over to verify what we had ordered. The waitress  verified we had ordered the taco and enchilada dinner. She apologized and said she could not understand why that had happened because they have had the same kitchen help there for years. Needless to say they didn&#39;t offer to take anything off the bill and she said the no ala carte policy would stand so we left with take out in hand to dispose of in their dumpster outside.
 They only thing I can figure out is they want the full price of a complete dinner not the price of an ala carte portion. Personally I wouldn&#39;t care if they charged us more its not about saving money, we just won&#39;t finish the rice and beans and don&#39;t like wasting the food. Its really to bad when a restaurant decides customers that have been going there for 15 -16 years are not important.  We usually spend between 55 and 75 dollars every time but I guess that&#39;s not enough money for them. Then there&#39;s the recent decline in the food quality, I would try again but they don&#39;t offer ala carte portions

Its just as well we discovered another place called the Taco dinner that will sell us ala carte tacos that are outstanding

The salsa was fantastic, as I like it a little spicy. My family raved about the chicken soup they brought out as an appetizer (I&#39;m veg so I didn&#39;t try), but I just filled up on chips and that great salsa washing it down with a yummy guava margarita on the rocks. 

I was so full from the chips I barely had room for the combination I ordered vegetarian prepared. Only tried the enchilada, beans and rice. They were great and my mom enjoyed the leftovers of a torta and taco with the rice the next day.

Nothing extraordinary, but they seem to do just about everything right. Just wish the food matched the price tag. $10 for a torta with beans and rice runs well above market. $14 for an enchilada dinner just doesn&#39;t seem right; especially when it&#39;s overcooked and the sauce is baked into the tortilla. I&#39;d just as well pass on the &#34;complimentary&#34; pickled vegetables and chicken soup; save a few bucks on the main course. $4.35 Coronas didn&#39;t tickle my fancy either. Rice and beans were cooked properly but under seasoned. Torta bread was fresh but lettuce, tomato, and cheese were lacking; very minimalistic. Gorditas weren&#39;t on the menu, but are sold. Service was hospitable, and checked in frequently. Tables needed some cleaning. Check my pics for the avocado torta and cheese enchiladas. Worth a stop if in the area, but wouldn&#39;t come close to my top ten list..."

Wish I had some of Mom&#39;s homemade chicken soup (which she&#39;d gladly make if I asked, but it&#39;s lunchtime and I need something NOW). I&#39;ve been working in Romeoville for 6-7 years, and nothing I know of here can compare (and I&#39;ve been just about everywhere this town has to offer). Still, I&#39;m hopeful of a hidden gem I&#39;ve not discovered yet.

So I Google &#34;Best chicken soup in Romeoville&#34; and (no surprise) the first place that comes up is NOT in Romeoville. Who wants to drive 18 minutes (one way) with a queasy stomach for a bowl of soup? But since all other options that come to mind just makes me feel queasier, I decide to go for it.

And a wonderful choice it was!! Though I wonder if it&#39;s fair to rate a place 5 stars on just one bowl of soup, I&#39;ll have to go back soon and see (and update my review). But for now, the 5 stars will stick because that was absolutely the best chicken soup I&#39;ve had in a long, long time (sorry, Mom)."

We decided to meet in the middle, and Buchos was the first thing to pop up with positive reviews. I was pleased. It is a little more dining room than I was looking for. For example, there was no bar seating. But they do serve alcohol. So I had a XX. I was about 20 minutes ahead of my friend, so I helped myself to the chips and some better-than-average complimentary salsa. 

I ordered some enchiladas. They were delicious, and plenty of food for me. If I had eaten just a few more chips before hand, I could have saved enough for lunch the next day.

This isn&#39;t someplace I would go out of my way for. But I liked it fine and next time I am in a similar situation I will probably propose the same deal. Plus it is right next to some big mall and IKEA, so I can come up with an excuse to come home with some pants or another bookshelf."

The space itself is not fancy at all, but was clean and friendly.

Service was good, waitress was attentive. Food was good as well. And let me tell you, there was plenty of it. Chips, salsa, a bowl of pickled vegetables, and a cup of chicken soup all served before your entree.  AND Entrees come with a salad in addition to refried beans and rice.

And the &#34;small&#34; margarita (frozen, mango) was HUGE. Tasty, too.

Enchiladas suizas were  fantastic, cheesy and the sauce had a nice kick. Tried a bit of the boyfriend&#39;s Carne asada and it was excellent, too.

Hey, I like good food and good booze, especially when there is plenty of it, and I love a good value, but the sheer amount of peripheral food in addition to your entree  was kinda nuts and a little bit unnecessary but hey, if that&#39;s the only complaint to have then life is pretty good.

If you&#39;re heading to the Promenade for shopping or a movie, go a little bit off the beaten path, avoid the regular old chain restaurants and try Bucho&#39;s. It&#39;s worth it."

By the looks of the outside, you&#39;d be really put-off.  It looks like a small fast food restaurant on the outside, but don&#39;t let that put you off!   All of the waitstaff seemed extremely friendly and helpful!  Good refills on water, amazzzing margaritas(HUGE!), and yummy chips and salsa. The salsa is quite flavorful with a nice kick to it, and the chips warm.

I got the Taco Dinner platter- steak.  The steak was tender and the tacos flavorful.  My fiance got some platter with a stuffed poblano pepper, steak taco, and tamale and he was in love! 

All in all, we will definitely be back for the food and margaritas on a regular basis.

The only downfall is the pricing is a bit higher than most Mexican places in the area.  However, I think the amount of food you get makes up for the price.  Big portions for the money.  I think our total bill was $40 for two of us for our two meals, plus margaritas.  Worth the money though!"

When I come in I almost always order the same thing, the burrito lunch with a XX or a Margareta. Right away they bring out chips and home made salsa and some strange pickled vegetable plate. They also bring out home made chicken soup.  The soup is wonderful! The salsa is great but I have never touched the vegetables.  They kind of creep me out for some reason.

From the outside, the looks aren&#39;t appealing. But grab a hold of that steering wheel and pull your vehicle into the Bucho&#39;s parking lot. You won&#39;t be disappointed.

Walking into Bucho&#39;s is like walking into a random, little hacienda down in Mexico. The restaurant is decorated with traditional Mexican decor. Yes, it&#39;s a little on the dive-y side, but look past it and move on to the menu. 

I&#39;ve only been to Bucho&#39;s for lunch, so I&#39;ve only indulged in their food - since having some (or even one) margs on a lunch break are a big no-no in my company. The lunch menu offers a wide variety of combination plates, which all come with rice and beans ((or rice and Mexican potatoes)). A lunch combo will cost you about 7 or 8 bucks. That&#39;s it. So you can have your tacos, enchiladas, burrito, chile rellenos, tortas, or whatnot, and your rice and beans. For cheap. And you&#39;ll be stuffed to the gills. If you&#39;re appetite isn&#39;t that large, you can purchase items a la carte. A taco will cost you a couple bucks, while an enchilada will cost you 3. The steak tacos and cheese enchiladas are a couple of faves... 

Since my transition into vegetarianism, I was sad to recently learn the only vegetarian taco option was avocado, lettuce and tomato. Meh. It was okay. It did the trick...especially since cheese filled chile rellenos or cheese filled enchiladas didn&#39;t seem appealing at that moment. So vegetarians beware - you won&#39;t find your fancy tofu tacos here.

Service is almost always fantastic. Upon being seated you&#39;re brought a basket of chips and salsa, a cup of chicken noodle soup, and some pickled veggies. ((So. freaking. good.)) The servers are very friendly and make sure your tiny glasses of water are filled at all times. When dining in groups, I&#39;ve almost always had the check split for us - without asking. However, I&#39;ve made the mistake of ordering a small side of sour cream and ended up getting charged $1.50 for about a cup of it. Literally - one measurable cup. Yikes. That would have been nice to tell me. 

Good food, good service, and super affordable prices. What more could you ask for?? Vamos a Bucho&#39;s!"

Food comes in good sized portions and features all of the Mexican standards you come to expect at places like this.  Nice sized portions and you also get homemade salsa and chips at your table along with pickled vegetables. Be sure to order a (small) Margarita, they are excellent. 

There is nothing fancy happening inside but the decor has a nice Mexican flair and every time I have been there TV&#39;s have had Mexican soap operas playing.  Overall just a great local restaurant for Mexican food. 

Most dishes hover around the $9-14 range, but if you get something with steak or a bit higher end preparation you are looking at the $14-18 range. I don&#39;t believe there is anything on the menu more than $25. 

You can also do take out and most meals are ready within 15-20 minutes."

Positives: our server was super attentive, we always got refills without asking and the portion sizes were huge. Negatives: the place is a dive, no bones about it. It is a redone Wendy&#39;s that has seen better days and just looked rough. Our food took a solid 45 minutes to arrive after ordering, which may not seem like long but we only ordered one kid&#39;s meal, one main course and an ala carte item. Plenty of other diners arrived after us and received their food long before we got ours. I thought overall the food was ok (good spicy salsa and chips, my husband like his chili rellenos and my ala carte chicken quesadilla was packed with well seasoned chicken) but the margarita was marginal (the mix was exactly that...a mix) and for $10.95/drink, I&#39;ve definitely had better. My biggest complaint was the price--we spent more here ($65 for the three of us and I only had an ala carte item) than we do at Mago, which has a far better atmosphere and more complex menu items and Mago&#39;s margaritas are to die for....we&#39;d go back to Bucho&#39;s but only if Mago were closed or if we were just looking for a change.

Revised: I just revised my rating from a 3 to a 1. My husband and I both got seriously ill about 6 hours after we ate at Bucho&#39;s. Definite case of food poisoning. We will not be returning."

Their interior still has plenty of space. The staff is very friendly. They make pretty damn good margaritas, plus their HUUUUUUGE!

Their total service is superb. I love that they give you salsa (actually spicy), some pickled vegetables, and a bowl of chicken noodle soup on the house. It&#39;s great when a place goes above and beyond to give you a little something extra. Truly makes you feel appreciated, taken care of, and almost like your distant family. 

I get something different every time. Their guacamole is very good, as is the queso fundido. Go ahead, go all out and put all the ingredients in it. That can practically be your meal. The enchiladas, tampiquena, variety of tacos, and just about everything else is good.

Unlike some of the other places I&#39;ve reviewed, this is more a restaurant versus a carry out place. That&#39;s not a big deal. 

Once I step in, I take a look around the place. The first thing I noticed was it&#39;s pretty tight in spacing. The place was clean. People seemed to enjoy their meals (based on seeing them eat or empty plates on a table). So far, so good. Knowing I was going the takeout route, the woman at the counter placed no hurry on me. Even though the place wasn&#39;t that busy when I went, some places will still try to rush you out the door. Not here. 

I asked a few basic questions and the woman answered them with no complaints. She, in fact was, very friendly. So as good as the other items like the fajitas, enchiladas and tacos looked good (based on what I saw being brought out to customers), I went with the old reliable chicken burrito. The prices are almost in step with most (food-wise). The burrito was a little more expensive than other places ($6.50-plus tax) but you did get sour cream as a standard filling (and no complaints to add onions). I had to say I&#39;m glad I stopped here because this was one solid burrito. Properly seasoned and the perfect balance of all the fillings. 

My only complaint (if you want to call it that) is the sauce. Not so much the sauce. Let me explain. I asked the woman at the counter for the hottest sauce they had. Now when I ask for the hottest sauce at a Mexican place, I assume they understood it as wanting the spiciest. What I got was a hot sauce- literally. A hot (as in temperature but nice tasting) adobo sauce. I could make myself more clear next time I visit because there WILL be a next time for me.  Another hidden gem!!"

For starters:  They serve chips and salsa with every meal.  The chips have a smoky flavor, which is a nice twist to the usual.  The salsa is hot, so skip it if you don&#39;t like spicy salsas.  I thought it was great.  They also bring out a small bowl of chicken vegetable soup before your meal.  It&#39;s damn good!  The unexpected free starter is the sampling of carrots, onions and other vegetables that are marinated in a vinegar base of some kind.  I&#39;ve never had this before and really liked it.

The meal: I ordered a beef combination meal of one taco, tostada and enchilada.  All three are good, but nothing too exciting.  The taco might have been the best since it was served with a soft corn shell, my favorite for tacos.  I don&#39;t get the &#34;tostada&#34; and should have skipped ordering it since I am not a huge fan of these any way.  It came with the combo, so there you go.  The enchilada was good, but dry like many I&#39;ve had before at other places.  All in all, still a good and very good portion size.

Margarita:  I ordered a traditional &#34;medium&#34; margarita on the rocks with salt.  My favorite local Mexican restaurant makes a home-made version, so this didn&#39;t stand-up against it very well at all.  I don&#39;t like pre-mixed margaritas now and this clearly was one.  However, if pre-mix is o.k. in your book, then this will do just fine.  Nice size and a decent mix.

Summary:  Good casual Mexican food with great service. Thanks!"

We entered the restaurant at a time between lunch and dinner.  The restaurant was pretty empty and the décor was pretty dated.  The server brought salsa/chips and water.  My hubby loves salsa but this was way too hot to eat.  He didn&#39;t touch it after the first try and neither did I.  The chicken soup came out and it was tasty.  He ordered a burrito from the lunch menu and I ordered fish tacos with a side of guacamole.  He said the burrito was just okay...not a whole lot of seasoning as he put it.  My tacos were just OK as well....the fish was cooked well but had no flavoring.  The cup of hot sauce that accompanied it was the only thing that gave it a kick.  I don&#39;t like hot sauce so I didn&#39;t use very much.  We ordered margaritas on the rocks and they were just OK as well.  All in all I was hoping for a little more for my $50.  He was somewhat disappointed and so was I.  I am taking him somewhere else to make up for his just OK birthday dinner.

If you want to stay in the burbs, this is workable, but don&#39;t get too excited. I read all the other reviews, and thought maybe I was missing something. No. Personally, it is not the best Mexican place I have been too. If you want Mexican, you need to really go where it makes sense - not Bollingbrook. 

In terms of my meal - the enchiladas were very dry and bland. The guacamole had way too many onions for guacamole. The margaritas were good, which was helpful. But overall, the atmosphere is a tough one - you felt like you were in a refab taco bell...they did do a good job with what they had, but again, I have to defer to my staple - Les Reyes in Aurora....sorry..."

We were hungry and in the area and saw positive reviews on yelp. We ordered two &#34;medium&#34; sangrias. They were huge! Not to mention delicious. We also got the quest fundido with poblanos which was also really good. It was a big melty blob of cheese with poblanos and beans. It could be a dish in itself. It came with fresh tortillas. It was a lot of cheese, which is always a good thing.
 After eating the appetizer our waitress brought us each a cup of chicken soup which smelled really good with lime. I&#39;m a vegetarian so I didn&#39;t eat it but my boyfriend ate both his and mine. I got the cheese enchiladas and the mole sauce on top was addicting.  I could go for more right now. My boyfriend got the steak tacos but it had a fancy name I can&#39;t remember.  He really liked them. Everything here was pretty good.  And the service was really friendly. I liked our waitress. She kept suggesting we drink more sangria! Always a good thing :)"

We have had much success with all of your recommendations.  But we have NO idea how this place got a four star rating.  It was horrible and we can&#39;t get enough of Mexican food.  The only reason this place didn&#39;t get a one was b/c we liked the salsa and the carrots.  The queso fundito was a greasy mess of cheese.  It was impossible to eat with chips.  You had to cut it with a knife.  The carne asada  ($16.95)  can best be described as salty shoe leather (See photo) and my husband&#39;s pork fajitas were cut up so tiny and salted to try and cover up the cheat mean (if it even was pork).  I&#39;ve never had guac quite like this either where the onions were in slices instead of chopped up;  the taste was alright, but we were fed up and still hungry.  We paid the bill and tip and walked out on our full plates of food.  Don&#39;t waste your time or your appetite on this joint."

So far this is the most authentic place I&#39;ve come across in the Western Burbs. The atmosphere is pretty typical, nothing too much to  hype about.  You are greeted with friendly staff, warm chips, and some pretty spicy salsa!  They also bring out vegetables in some sort of sweet sauce. 
The margaritas were great! We got a pitcher of strawberry margaritas - no complaints! They also have the following flavors: mango, guava, peach, lime, and raspberry! 
Everything tasted fresh and well prepared. I ordered the chicken fajitas because I didn&#39;t feel like anything deep fried. It came with corn and flour tortillas, guacamole, and melted chihuahua cheese.  The cheese was fantastic!!! I just wished the fajitas came with a few more topping choices (sour cream for example).  My husband ordered a Chimichanga with steak and loved it! It wasn&#39;t on the menu, but the waitress said that they would be able to make one with no problem.

Angelo&#39;s thin crust is simply awesome. It&#39;s a cracker crust so it&#39;s very light and crispy. The ingredients they use are always very good. Fresh garlic, great sauce and cheese. Canned mushrooms? Nope. Not at this place.

My group and I ordered two pizzas for pickup: a simple cheese topping and an Angelo&#39;s special (sausage, green pepper, onion, mushroom). The Angelo&#39;s special quite honestly tasted indistinguishable to the cheese pizza because the toppings were so sparse. If you were lucky enough to encounter a piece of sausage on your slice, it didn&#39;t have any spice to it and was flavorless.

Strangely they are rather more expensive to comparables in the area. Their higher than average prices and skimpy applied toppings means their profit margins must be large."

I have a skeptical mind, but I generally tend to be a believer in the wisdom of crowds. Well, in this case, I think the crowds are absolutely right. This is excellent thin crust pizza.

This casual establishment has much nicer decor than you would normally find at a place in which you order at the counter. The metal chairs are really unique and the variety of hats festooning most surfaces seven feet off of the floor are whimsical. There&#39;s a nice patio on the east side of the building if you like it al fresco.

The employees we dealt with were friendly and gracious, especially the young women working the counter - they were all smiles and very helpful.

On to the food... The pizza (we got an XL thin crust - half pepperoni and half ground beef) was really great. The crust had a nice crunch, the cheese was plentiful, and the sauce was just right. I can&#39;t really think of a way they could have improved on this style of pizza, but I&#39;ll keep checking out other places to see how they stack up with Angelo&#39;s.

Getting beyond the pizza itself, they have a good selection of beer and wine and love to help people choose something they&#39;ll enjoy.  One of my favorite aspects and part of what keeps me coming back is the ownership.

Indoor seating is limited and you have to seat yourself, so be sure to grab the first table that opens up!  There is an outdoor patio that would be great for those warm summer nights, but it is obviously closed in the winter."

We ordered an extra-large pizza with two different toppings, half/half: one side just cheese, the other JUST tomato, garlic, and minced basil. The reason we ordered the tomato/garlic/basil combo was because I was really craving a pizza marinara, which by definition has only those three ingredients.

Pizza comes in an hour, and not only is my half of the pizza swimming in cheese, but there is also no basil.  Call to express our concerns, and the manager/owner makes it OUR fault for not saying &#34;no cheese,&#34; because &#34;any pizza place will automatically add cheese.&#34; Funny, cuz Labriola in Oak Brook was more than happy to create a pizza marinara for me with no cheese when I asked for it. Thanks for the excellent attempts at making things better; we certainly won&#39;t be bringing our business back to this bogus establishment ever again.

Furthermore -- the existing pizza we received was subpar in taste, regardless of the order being correct or not."

Shame on me for decades of unattended appearances. I will bluntly put it out there that I grew up on Papa&#39;s Pizza Place and Dan&#39;s Pizza my whole life. I decided to branch off and try what my buddy tells me is one awesome thin crust pizza.

After mailing some letters at the post office, I walked over to Angelo&#39;s Pizza with the intent to try a medium pepperoni and mushroom pizza. Upon walking in I quickly figured out that you place all orders at the counter, and if you dine in a food runner will bring you your paid meal.

Obviously pizza is made fresh and takes about 12-15 minutes to arrive to your table. I love how the staff checks up on you asking if you need anything. I believe the owner was the gentleman that approached me asking how my meal was. That was awesome and glad to spend my money where it is appreciated.

My pizza was cracker crust thin and the sauce was not sweet. Pepperoni was where the magic happens on every bite. I was very happy with my pizza choice and brought some home for later.

Today was a rainy day so I couldn&#39;t sit outside but I bet on a hot day a nice cold beer would be heaven!!

On a side note I notice they serve their pizzas on the perfect crust pizza liners. For those not understanding that is a liner used to eliminate soggy crusts. That goes to show Angelo&#39;s has taken measures to ensure a quality pizza product."

Fortunately, I really enjoyed the pizza.

The 20&#39;, as you can guess, is gigantic, and it&#39;s well worth the price.
5 stars for the price to size ratio (most places have only 16&#39; or 18&#39; max, and they charge around the same price for a smaller size).

As for the taste, the pizza is pretty good. Unfortunately, the crust wasn&#39;t as crispy as I wanted. Luckily for me, I ordered for pickup, so I was able to toast the crust to near perfection.

If your pizza isn&#39;t as crispy as you would like, I highly recommend the extra couple minutes to toast it, as it makes a world of a difference."

I&#39;d like to consider myself an aspiring pizza connoisseur and I can honestly admit this spot serves up the nicest thin crust on this side of Chicago! This is one of my all time favorite pizzas and my toppings of choice are pineapples and jalapenos. First off, the welcoming smell once you pop open the box of deliciousness lets you know you&#39;re in for something special. The crispiness of the crust, savory sauce, and tangy cheese are the basic components that make this pizza great. The fresh jalapenos and pineapples will leave your taste buds in a symphony that&#39;s spicy, sweet, and impossible to beat. The ambiance is friendly, spacious, clean and uniquely decorated. Choice of drink is of course a Coke or Pepsi, which makes for a perfect combination with pizza. Overall, my experiences here have been nothing short of exceptional. The pizza is consistently on point and it stems from using fresh and quality ingredients each and every time. Bravo Angelos, it&#39;s an honor to have you in Downers Grove."

This is by far our favorite &#34;thin crust&#34; pizza!  The toppings are spot-on perfect in both amounts and taste (you can tell they use quality ingredients!).  For me, the cheese and especially the sauce are the stars in this show.  I am forever ordering pizza &#34;easy on the sauce&#34; because other pizza joints usually add way too much, but Angelo&#39;s puts the perfect amount on, every time, and for me their sauce tastes the best and is my #1 favorite.
We have also tried their spaghetti and lasagna.  Without sounding like a broken record, their lasagna is the best I&#39;ve had delivered to my door ;)

An hour and 15 minutes later, we called to find out the status of the delivery and were told that if it had not arrived in another 15 minutes, to call back again. So, 15 minutes after that, our pizza had STILL not yet arrived, so we called back again. The girl who answered the phone didn&#39;t put us on hold, but instead placed the phone on the counter, so we could hear them arguing about how they couldn&#39;t find the delivery driver&#39;s phone number, or even our ticket for our order. At this point, we were starving and fed up and did not want to pay a ridiculous amount of money for cold pizza, so we told them we wanted to cancel our order and we were just going to go out to eat somewhere else. They tried to offer us a free pizza on our next order, but that did not help as we never wanted to order from this location again. We told them to please cancel our order. 10 minutes after THAT, the delivery driver shows up at our door. We apologized to him and told him that we had cancelled our order, and that the restaurant had apparently failed to relay that message to him. THEN, someone (I assume a manager) had the audacity to call us back and berate us for cancelling the order. He told us to &#34;go back to Pizza Hut&#34; and then hung up on us. I am absolutely astounded in the lack of customer service, and even basic decency, displayed on their part.

I love their new dining room. You take your menu to the table, decide what you want,  place your order at the counter, then fill your own drinks. This was just fine with us; added to the casual atmosphere, and we don&#39;t need &#34;full service&#34; to order pizza.

Often the crust can be too thick, soggy-like after a short time, and just no good. Don&#39;t get me wrong, we do like the other Chicago institution (here&#39;s looking at you LM&#39;s), but sometimes you want a change and sometimes you just want to sit down rather than carry-out. My husband found Angelo&#39;s through the interwebs, and finally I gave in to try something new on a whim. 

The dining area is unassuming... small to medium sized, and very welcoming. We were instantly greeted by a young lady who explained the process to us.  Grab a menu, grab a seat, order at the counter at your own leisure, get a number, have food brought to your table. Simple enough.  We ordered toasted ravioli, a small Angelo&#39;s Special, and a small White Pizza. The ravioli came out nice and crunchy on the outside and warm and cheesy on the inside.  The pizza followed shortly. Both pizza&#39;s were really good (I really want more of that White Pizza RIGHT NOW just thinking about it). There was no shortage of ingredients, the crust was deliciously thin and crispy, and you could taste the individual ingredients (read: fresh and not drenched in greasiness).  

We were checked on a few times by our waitress and another lady wearing an apron. They were both really nice and not over-bearing. There was a guy with his two small kids also, and the lady in the apron engaged the kids as well, not just talking to the dad. As I said, they make you feel very welcome and comfortable. 

If I had to fault them for something it would be for having pepsi products. Sorry, I&#39;m a coke girl (the drink that is).  Other than that we are totally open to trying them out again. Would love to try the patio when it&#39;s warmer! It looked really nice, and I do wonder if we can bring the dog (though keep her outside the fence of the patio of course)."

They deliver, which is super convenient, and the delivery charge is very reasonable. They also offer a 20 inch &#34;Jumbo&#34; pizza, and I absolutely love that because most places in this area only offer up to 16. Don&#39;t get me wrong, a 16 inch pizza is reasonable, but when you have two grown men to feed, 20 is definitely a better choice. We ordered a jumbo with 3 toppings, so our total came out to $25.97 plus tax. That&#39;s a great price considering that&#39;s what we pay for the 16 at other places! The only negative with our experience was that we were told for delivery it would be to our house within the hour, but it was a bit over an hour by the time it actually arrived. I can understand the wait because it was a Saturday night, and they&#39;re doing construction on one of the main streets, so that probably delayed them. It was definitely worth the wait, though! Their pizza is magnificent, and as I&#39;ve previously mentioned, extremely reasonable price wise. I would absolutely recommend giving this cute little place a shot!

Food is always hot and promptly served although wait times during can be long when the &#39;lamo&#39; Cruisin&#39; Nite is in the downtown area.  Beer is fairly priced as well as extras like wings.  Oh, and by the way, I don&#39;t know how they do it; but their wings are outstanding.  Pizza is well made with a good, thin crust and plenty of fresh cheese (not the imitation oily crap) and their sauce actually has a unique flavor that is pleasant to the palette.  I cannot speak on their delivery service because I always just pick up.  Keep up the good work guys - I&#39;ve never been disappointed yet!"

angelos-pizza-downers-grove,Bob G.,ngLoCfsIznBzPFh6I6-Tsw,"Villa Park, IL",0,1,0,0,263,nYt6rBklYrkmA6GQPWd5Uw,3.0,2013-11-24,"Meeting a friend at Angelo&#39;s Pizza, we had a half sausage, half cheese extra large (16&#34;) thin crust (actually an extra thin crust as requested - which turned out very nicely) with extra sauce on one side.  Though I had no serious issues with the pizza and thought the sausage was extra-tasty, my friend said the sauce wasn&#39;t tangy enough for his taste; probably true though all-in-all it was pretty good for the average local pizza joint.

He had ordered before I got there - the pizza, a side of onion rings &amp; a couple MGDs (not much of a beer selection) so when I sat down I asked the server if they had a green salad.  She listed the salads for me so I got a regular sized green salad with ranch dressing on the side. Then she said &#34;when you&#39;re ready just come up to the counter and I can ring the salad for you.&#34;

I then asked my friend, &#34;Oh you have to prepay everything?&#34; and he said &#34;Yeah&#34; which was strange because they have more than adequate layout for table service. So we talked about that a bit, means that perhaps they can&#39;t (or won&#39;t) keep a check open and add to it (think of a time before most restaurants accepted credit cards - what are they afraid of - dine and dash?), and when I went up to pay for the salad I saw that was true.  She swiped my credit card for the salad and typed in the amount on an old-school keypad connected to a phone line.  I think this adds an overtone of insult to the dine-in customers.

The onion rings were decent, obviously a frozen pre-breaded variety so it&#39;s not like you&#39;re here to enjoy some exclusive original recipe - but adequate.  The salad was  very generous and had a variety of ingredients besides lettuce - tomatoes, mozzarella, black olives and was very good. So the hilarious Family Guy gag (complete with vignette of a salad being ruined) about all Italian carry-out pizza joints being the only places that could destroy a green salad is still pretty much true, but this one was above average for pizza place.  The dressing was pretty horrible, tasted like some bottled foodservice brand with a strong overtone of Miracle Whip. So I asked for the Italian which, though also prefab, was much more toned down.  I alternated bites between the two. 

 I was thinking what if somebody wanted to add something else like more drinks, another beer, another appetizer or whatever - what a pain to have to whip out the card every time.  The server,  who was very nice, came to check on us after the pizza was down and I asked her that question and she says, &#34;Funny thing you would ask, the guys at the next table asked for more beers and I had to re-ring them,&#34; and that they had commented as well.

So again, it&#39;s not that the service was bad at all, it&#39;s that the service MODEL was bad and it must cost a fortune in Merchant Services charges (which are usually higher when they swipe smaller orders on a keypad over a dedicated phone line) vs. authorizing over the internet using a proper POS system (which in addition would allow them to keep tickets open giving customers the convenience of adding to their orders without a cash payment or credit card swipe every time) - so to be honest in this day and age that was actually pretty ridiculous, and fixing this would likely increase sales.  It would definitely smooth out the dining experience.

Since neither of us brought cash, we decided to go back up to the counter to add a tip to the first ticket with a credit card, as the server told us that is the only portion that isn&#39;t closed out with the authorization (when she rang the salad she speared the receipt before I had a chance to fill in any tip).  As someone who appreciates and has used business technology in a wide range of situations including a foodservice environment,  working there would drive me crazy (and owning a place where I saw money walking out the door every day wouldn&#39;t make me feel so great, either!) - and knowing that customers have to work that hard to tip means some might just give up and leave without tipping.

Though I will definitely be back for another pizza (as the one we had was tasty and a good value) and for sure the servers were attentive - the place needs some major work.

With the wide open floor plan, decent décor (though freezing inside on a day when it was raining and in the 40s outside - diners at the other two tables seated kept their jackets on while eating) and prime location in the continually rehabbed and remodeled section of Downers Grove right near the commuter garage and Metra station - Angelo&#39;s is totally missing out by not offering full table service, completely improving their transaction model, notching the menu up, improving the beer selection and learning how to make a few decent salad dressings.  Right now they are just leaving money on the table, definitely not on their side of the table (and not in the way that benefits their servers!)."

For 5 weeks, we had to take the Metra into the city and always passed by this restaurant.

I didn&#39;t realize this was the same restaurant I gave bad reviews two years ago.

Walking in, the first scent we smelled was bleach.  I guess they just opened and just got their mopping done.  The woman in the front was very very sweet.  My classmates ordered a simple cheese pizza and salads so I can&#39;t really gauge on their toppings but their cheese looked good. 

Their salads were great!  FRESH vegetables as they can be and they looked so clean.  Grated parmesan cheese was delicious in the salad.

Every 5 minutes, someone would ask us how everything was and if there was anything we needed to please let them know.  I think Angelo greeted us too when he came in and the woman to took our order was his wife.  She is amazingly adorable.

So... thank you for a great experience!  I&#39;m sure whatever happened two years ago was probably a fluke and I&#39;m proud to update my review :)"

Ordered a 16 inch with sausage, pepperoni and Italian beef and an order of cheezy garlic bread. 

Angelo&#39;s uses the right amount of cheese, sauce and ingrediants and it shows because nothing falls off the crust when you pick up a slice.

Angelo&#39;s also has friendly customer service and excellent prices. I am glad they understand that quality pizza doesn&#39;t have to be expensive. A lot of places try to justify their prices claiming everything they use is fresh and quality, but very few places are up there with this place"

I&#39;m not from around this area but was in town for work and I have a tendency to scope out gluten free offerings on yelp wherever I am. Their gluten free pizza caught my eye and I decided to make a pick up order before I headed back home on a 35 minute drive. 
Service was impeccably kind for someone ordering takeout 30minutes before their posted close time. This seems like a long time family run operation if my assumptions are correct. 
I ordered the 12in gluten free pizza with spinach and garlic. The smell was amazing! 
Upon returning home, my boyfriend and I did reheat the pizza in the oven but it was still just as fantastic as it smelled :) 
It doesn&#39;t quite measure up to my standard of gluten free pizza which happens to be from Lou Malnatis - they seem to have the market cornered as far as their one of a kind taste in the way they season their spinach and sauce - but it was nonetheless a worthwhile expense. I&#39;d get it again and with such top notch service from the moment I called to place my order, I can definitely recommend this place."

However, I digress.  Angelo&#39;s had everything I like--a thin crust, tasty toppings, a nice thick mozzarella blanket and a reasonable price.  I went to pick it up and had a beer while I waited and it was definitely worth the trip.  Also, to the sweet 45-ish  Italian-looking gentleman who handed me my pizza with the words: &#34;Here you go beautiful.&#34; thank you.  You made my night and that was BEFORE I tasted the OUTSTANDING sausage and pepperoni pie you made for me.

A small, unassuming family shop serves up a great thin crust pizza to be enjoyed.

We were in the area checking out a specialty grocery shop, and Yelp led us to try this wonderful gem.

Ordered up one small side salad (to start as an appetizer) which seems to have been made fresh.  Nice simple ingredients, but I was a bit surprised by the packet dressing.  Then again, very few restaurants make their own dressing anymore, so at least this place is honest and not refilling it into a fancy container claiming it&#39;s housemade.

Our main course, a thin crust Angelo pizza, was excellent.  The crust was crackly crisp on the sides, with a little soggy chew in the middle.  Sausage had excellent flavor, sauce was lightly tangy and sweet, mushrooms tasted fresh, onions were perfectly tender... This is a delicious pizza.

The owner came out to introduce himself and learn a little bit about his customers, and it was always nice to chat a bit mid meal to let him know they&#39;re turning out great food.  

Verdict:  A very well made thin crust pizza, excellent and friendly customer service... I can only hope they deliver as far we live, and if not, we&#39;ll just have to make our way into Downers Grove a little more regularly."

 I do carry out because the dining room is pretty  small and tables are close together, so I don&#39;t find it a comfortable dining experience. 
The food is solid, pizza crust is chewy and nicely crisped from oven, the toppings are high quality, but I find they can be skimpy on them. 
I actually prefer the sandwiches and salads better and think they are a better deal. My favorite is the Italian Grinder, 4 kinds of Boar&#39;s Head meat and cheese on a nice hearty french roll baked in oven until bread is crispy and cheese is gooey then topped with lettuce, tomato, and peppers. It is big enough to split.

The few times I&#39;ve been to Bricks, the pizza was pretty good. Ingredients were fresh, and the pizza was prepared well - though I would say I felt the prices were slightly high for the product. The price really isn&#39;t a major complaint. Decent pizza is worth the price. Fresh, well-prepared pizza is a good thing.

The downside, really, is that it just feels impersonal. It feels almost robotic to eat there. I&#39;m not sure, outside of the order, that we had any human interaction. Our food was dropped off and that was that. There&#39;s really no &#34;experience&#34; to speak of beyond eating pizza. Decor is ok. Eating space is small.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, eating pizza is awesome, but when you go out, it&#39;s nice to have an experience beyond the food. I think an emphasis on customer service and personalizing the process/ adding interest would take Bricks to the next level.

Décor: There really is not much to say about the look and feel of this place. It is a pretty typical small-and-in-a-strip-mall restaurant with a and handful of tables and a single dining room. The menu is huge and on the wall when you walk in, you can&#39;t miss it, and the lighting is decent (not dark, but not blaring). It didn&#39;t seem to be too crowded while we were there, although every table was filled (there just wasn&#39;t a line out the door).
Bathroom: clean and well looked after

Staff: The cashier and food delivery guys were all nice and kept this straight business. Our food came out relatively quickly although not everything came at the same time (wasn&#39;t a huge deal though).

Food: We had an assortment of times ranging from the Chicken Salad Sandwich and the Tuna Sandwich to a salad. I also had the Bruschetta appetizer with my sandwich. The bruschetta was just so-so... there were only four small pieces of bread buried under a huge mound of semi-diced tomatoes that were over oiled with balsamic. Normally I&#39;m a big fan of bruschetta but this wasn&#39;t to my liking. My sandwich, however, was very tasty - they (thankfully) only put the bread in the wood-fired oven and nothing else. That&#39;s what made it great: hot bread w/ cold chicken salad. The tuna was the same and the salad was pretty standard. Overall, we enjoyed the food and the sandwiches are good sized.

Value: The prices are not terrible here, you&#39;ll leave feeling like you paid just enough.

We&#39;ll keep this place in mind for the future as we did not try their (assumed) specialty: the pizza."

The place seems to skimp on the toppings as you have about two inches of crust around the whole pizza.  Our food was not brought out at the same time.  My vegetarian daughter does not have meat on her pizza - so they had to remake that.  The garlic bread was brought out immediately before the pizzas arrived.  So, I guess the term appetizer is lost in this locale.  

Will not return."

My husband and I went to the restaurant on a Tuesday evening around 6 p.m. We ordered our pizzas, a caprese salad, and two craft beers. The caprese was quite large, so I will give Bricks credit for not skimping on its portion sizes. About two minutes after the salad arrived, our pizzas showed up as well. While I understand many Americans eat a side salad, ours was meant to be an appetizer, so we would have preferred more time in between the salad&#39;s arrival and the pizzas&#39; appearance.

I know this is a fast casual restaurant, but we did have to call someone over to clean our table initially, and no one came to check on us after the meal had been served. I think a little more customer service was in order.

What made the dining experienced particularly horrendous, though, was a group of teenagers seated out front on the sidewalk (as this was summertime, the restaurant&#39;s window was open). They had a dog with them who did not stop yipping the entire time we were there. They also apparently could not remain in their seats, as the moment one would sit down, another would get up. The teenagers spent over an hour screaming, literally, about absolute nonsense while splitting a small pizza between 10 of them. In other words, they were more interested in using the table than actually eating at the restaurant. I teach high school students, and I cannot recall the last time I have encountered such a rude and oblivious children at a restaurant. 

I really wondered why the restaurant never approached the teens to control their behavior, or even ask them to leave, as it was quite clear they were not there to eat. The restaurant&#39;s response to these teenagers is a very large part of the reason why we will not go back. And no, we did not lodge a formal complaint with the manager, but we did mention the noise level to our server, who shrugged it off nonchalantly. Even without a complaint, I would think that the restaurant could clearly see the children were obnoxious, as the entire restaurant was repeatedly subjected to their loud screams and shrieks."

We don&#39;t eat meat or dairy, but we&#39;re enthused to hear that they had a &#34;build your own&#34; pizza option. Typically, the pizza comes with sauce and cheese. Any additional toppings cost extra. However, we opted out of the cheese and just got EVOO in replace of the red sauce. Thought that since we were removing the most expensive part that they may not charge us extra for the 2 vegetable toppings we chose. Wrong! So we paid MORE for a pizza with LESS since we got no cheese. Not necessarily about the extra $2 or whatever. Just disappointing that they don&#39;t really have any options for people with dietary restrictions, unless you want to pay more for less food. I&#39;ve even called trying to get soup before but they always have meat in it. Too bad that I can&#39;t eat here too because I live and work just a block away! My reccomendation is to either add menu options that are friendly to those with food allergies, or to not charge extra when someone asks you to &#34;hold&#34; something."

I was to attend a Yelp Elite Event a few blocks down at Peet&#39;s Coffee and was told we were getting samples and to eat in advance...I figured I&#39;d eat after but since the event ended at 8pm, I didn&#39;t want a huge dinner and didn&#39;t want to waste time driving so I did my research in advance on dinner.  I&#39;ve been to downtown Wheaton a few times, but I couldn&#39;t name one restaurant in the area so I looked on Yelp and found this place.

After the event last night at Peet&#39;s my sister came here - we both got a side salad, split the quattro formaggio pizza and got drinks.  Splitting the bill we paid $11 and some change.

The pizza was amazing!!! I always love a pizza from a wood burning oven, but this was sooooo tasty!!!!  It was just the proper amount of food, and we were very satisfied!  This is the type of place where you order, sit down, and they bring you your food.  We got in around 7:30ish and were in and out with minimal wait time...super fast, actually to get our food.

There are other locations - Naperville and Downers Grove so I&#39;m resided pretty much in the middle among these places, I WILL be back for more!!!"

It&#39;s fast casual... The service/set-up is similar to a Culver&#39;s, Noodles, etc. You order at the counter, get a number and the food gets delivered to your table. No table service. The only downfall I could see is they have appetizers listed and my guess (I can&#39;t comment off of experience) is everything will be delivered at once. To me, that kind of defeats the purpose of an appetizer. 

I was originally going to order a build your own pizza, but the girl at the counter was nice enough to inform me that I was better off going with the White Arugula since my order was so similar. And I could swap a few of the ingredients for a better price. My husband ordered the buffalo chicken pizza with gouda cheese. Both were excellent! They also had two good craft beers on draft. I&#39;ll definitely be back to try more pizzas and their sandwiches."

We enjoyed the meatballs with california raisins as an appetizer but overall, I would rather go to Nancy&#39;s Pizza down the road.  Our most recent time eating at Brick&#39;s, we ordered a pepperoni pizza with spinach.  It was awful. The crust was super thin and soggy,  the sauce has a terrible sugary after taste.

There were three of us and we got three different pizzas.. Sausage and peppers (me, yay!) The Brick&#39;s Pizza (Sausage and Mushrooms) and a Veggie.

Since I despise mushrooms and love meat.. I was only interested in one of those pizza&#39;s... I had a fork in my hand and anybody caught reaching was placing themselves at considerable potential risk.

Really, my pizza was excellent, great sauce good amount of cheese... just really, really good. I&#39;ll get exactly the same thing next time.

I also ordered a Caesar salad and it was big enough for all of us to share, it was very good and everyone was glad that I wasn&#39;t selfish about that too.  :)

Couple of things.. prices are good, it&#39;s super casual.. you walk in order your pizza at the counter and then take a seat. You also help yourself to the soda machine and the soda is in paper cups. they serve wine and beer, the wine is served in cute little water glasses.

The hot sauce is super wimpy and the hot pepper flakes don&#39;t come out of the container very well... I might bring my own stuff with me next time.

One thing that put a damper on the evening was the girl at the end. She asked if we needed boxes (I was a pig and finished mine, the ladies still had half a pizza each) and then brought out one small one, we asked if we could have a second.. she said sure and then literally tossed the box on top of my sister in laws pizza. We were baffled by why she would do that.

The wood fired pizza places are popping up all over the place. I thought this pizza was superior to La Fiamme in Naperville and much, much better than the stuff Mariano&#39;s put&#39;s out.

Overall a good experience and we will definitely go back again."

It was overall a very good experience. The only complaint I had was about a customer who was giving me the death stare, I can only assume because we had a three year old and baby with us... at a fast casual restaurant I believe it&#39;s appropriate to bring children...and it&#39;s not my problem you want a kid free dining experience.

Thinner crust style in a wood fire oven produces nice flavor. My only complaints would be the price for a rather small pizza and the abundance of burnt flour and crust underneath.

We&#39;ve enjoyed dining indoors and out, except for when we get the table next to the Starbucks bench where a man who is smelly often likes to sit.   It&#39;s a bustling restaurant with a fun feel to it, definitely family friendly but we&#39;ve also seen people (not us!) enjoying a sophisticated, adult meal.

I love everything I&#39;ve eaten here. Well, that might be an exaggeration. I tried a bite of arugula pizza once and did not care for it, but that&#39;s just cause a salad pizza is so far from my thing. Here is some of what I&#39;ve loved:

BBQ chicken pizza
Veggie pizza 
Plain old cheese pizza
Create your own pizza with evoo sauce and goat cheese
Spinach artichoke appetizer
Meatballs
BBQ chicken sandwich
Pesto sandwich
Mozzarella tomato basil sandwich

The pizza is delicious, of course. But the sandwiches are the real standout for me. I enjoy the crusty rolls and the way each half is wrapped in paper because the contents are so gooey. I just ate, and now I&#39;m making myself hungry again.

Finally, the cookies are not to be overlooked. When we talk about what downtown Wheaton needs, it&#39;s always &#34;more places like Bricks.&#34;"

Son #1 is crazy for a good Italian sub and heard this place had some great ones.  He could yelp about all the places in the western suburbs and the Italian subs, but that would require some effort and alas, that is not him.  He&#39;ll drive and get the food and IF YOU ASK, he will tell you about it, but that&#39;s it.

Ok, sorry for the Motherly digression.  I walked in around 1 on a weekday and there was no line and I ordered an Italian sub and a salad.  They have several salads to pick from and I chose one with bacon in it (food of the Gods).

I had to wait 3-5 minutes while they made it up fresh and I was on my way.  I stopped next door and picked up a Starbucks and headed home.

Son #1 enjoyed his sub sandwich, but I just got a &#34;meh&#34; from him about it.  He said the bread was great, but it could have had more meat.  I REALLY liked my salad.  It was pretty big and I only ate half of it and saved the rest for later.

I&#39;ll start by saying that the 12&#34; pizza has about 1.5&#34; of just crust on the outside before you see the cheese. The ingredients are SUPER scarce. They ration their condiments as though their condiments are rare and hard to come by...SUPER SCARCE!. 

 Let me pre-face my review by mentioning that I have owned a business for 10 years, was a retail senior manager for 4 year and  store manager for 2 years. 

On Friday (June 19, 2015), I called in an order of about $48 before tip, for carry out (two 12&#34; pizzas and 3 salads). I drove from Itasca, down to North Wheaton on a Friday evening just before Classic Car Night to pick up my order. When I got everything home, I opened my salad. After taking a few bites, I found a bug in my salad. I don&#39;t know about you, but that just grossed me out! 

I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager. I explained what I found. He told me that the lettuce they use is &#34;pre-packaged and pre-washed&#34; and that they take it from the bag and put it in the bowl. He offered to make the salad again and I could come back to pick it up. I&#39;m sorry, but I really don&#39;t care the way one&#39;s ingredients come, I care about the quality of the product the establishment puts out. Now living in Itasca, and during Classic Car Night in Wheaton, returning was a HUGE inconvenience, I asked if he would deliver it and and he told me that he doesn&#39;t do that. I explained how much of an inconvenience it was to return to pick up a salad that was screwed up in the first place and he told me that the only way I could get my salad is if I come to pick it up, or he&#39;ll give me a credit. I was hungry and opted to go back and pick it up. After explaining everything and saying that he wouldn&#39;t deliver, he said sorry but he sounded more annoyed than anything. 

I got there (parked 3 blocks away due to classic car night) with the salad with the bug in the dressing container to exchange for the new salad. The manager recognized me and pointed me out to an associate and ignored me as though he had no idea I was there. 

As I prefaced this review with my qualifications, when it comes to customer service, as a manager your job is &#34;customer service&#34; aka &#34;customer retainment&#34;. When a customer has an issue, as a manager, you do all you can to keep their business. Sometimes you don&#39;t want to but it&#39;s your job to keep their business. When your establishment messes up, your script is, &#34;Oh my goodness, I am SOO sorry!! That is absolutely unacceptable!! I promise I will PERSONALLY correct this situation. For your inconvenience, I&#39;ll give you ________.&#34; You sound as sincere as possible, apologize, promise the situation will get fixed and offer the customer an incentive to return (so as to not lose their business.)

When a customer comes in to exchange something, a GOOD manager comes from behind the counter, apologizes again, conducts the exchange and offers the incentive. This guy did nothing. The associate (NOT THE MANAGER) gave me the replacement salad and the associate apologized. The manager (who was about 5&#39;9&#34;, caucasion, stocky build, short black hair, wearing a white short sleeved polo shirt) never even acknowledged me, never apologized, never even made eye contact. REALLY? That&#39;s how you want to run a business? Fine! I will NEVER be back. I will GLADLY pay more money and go ANYWHERE else other than Bricks and get better and more ingredients on my pizzas!!!! What&#39;s funny, I&#39;ve received better customer service from a Pizza Hut and Papa Johns (CHAIN STORES) than I did at Bricks.

Customer service is EVERYTHING to me and my family. Not only did he lose me as a customer, he lost my entire family (who lives in Wheaton)."

Do you know Noodles? It&#39;s exactlty the same concept except it&#39;s pizza and not pasta.  You walk in, look at a menu board and order.  You can have one of their standard pizzas or create your own.  They also have sammies and salads and a few (few) craft beers.  You pay, they give you a number and you get your own drink (not beer), put your plastic number thingie in the holder and wait for your pizza.

The pizza comes out super fast.  Duh, it&#39;s in a friggin inferno of a wood burning oven.  The concept is great but the pizza was underwhelming.  I had the no red sauce version with olive oil, cheese, proscuitto and arugla. It looked AMAZING!  It tasted...well average.   Daughter had the spinach and feta and that was better than my choice.  Hubs had
 the quattro (4 cheese) and added hot peppers.  His was limp (hello!  his pizza not his... you know).  

The restaurant is clean but it&#39;s really cramped, seating wise.

I don&#39;t know, I expected it to be much better but nothing really stood out.  I think it&#39;s a great choice for Moms on the run with little ones or teenagers to get their pizza on but the vibe and actual pizza didn&#39;t do it for me.  I think they use quality ingredients but for some reason I was underwhelmed.

I don&#39;t think we will be back.  Too many other choice for pizza with a better vibe in Chicago and the suburbs."

Thankfully they were successful enough to branch out near me to accommodate lazy asses like myself. 

Located next to a Starbucks this place is a small quaint little pizza shop in downtown Wheaton. What stands out as you enter is the gigantic wood burning oven.(See picture)  Its huge and takes up like 1/4 of the space inside. Being a bit of a pizza snob, this was a good sign.  Now lets talk about food, I had the:

Side Salad: pretty big for a side salad, it comes with a sweet balsamic dressing that I really like. (3.50)

Mild Sausage Pizza with roasted Garlic: All the pizza&#39;s here are personal 12 inch pizza&#39;s which I like and mine came the way I like it. The crust is very thin and chewy. When you pick up a slice the front sort of flops around so its best to eat it folded NY style. Cheese was good and doesn&#39;t drag off the slice. The sausage is clearly not run of the mill sausage, and the sauce was semisweet which I really like on thin crust. (around 12 bucks)

Overall this is as good as it gets in the burbs in terms of thin crust pizza. Normally I would find some flaw to take a star away but this place actually pleasantly surprised me with its staff. You walk in and you see what looks like a bunch of teens in the kitchen. Normally I expect sh*tty service with a side of equally sh!tty attitude with people this young but these guys and gals were great. They were quick, knowledgeable and polite. 

Can&#39;t get much better than this. GO CHECK IT OUT!!"

Stopped by one weekend to check them out after some rave reviews and ordered up a magherita to go (more errands to run on the weekends!)  Friendly service, HUGE woodfired oven that can easily put 12+ pizzas in, it&#39;s a neat operation with a variety of pizzas, sandwiches, and salads for all.

Here&#39;s my thoughts:

Toppings:  basil had good flavor, mozzarella was really creamy.  Toppings were strong and tasty!  Sauce didn&#39;t stand out much, but was okay.

Crust:  While fresh, the crust has a nice texture - crisp outside giving way to a soft interior... but the crust itself lacks flavor.  It&#39;s lacking salt perhaps?  It just isn&#39;t very complex...

Verdict:  A tasty brick oven pizza place that serves up a decent pizza at reasonable prices, but the crust is lacking in depth of flavor.  Would I come back?  There are some interesting flavor combinations and mostly reasonable prices, so I&#39;d likely ome back to check it out!"

Its a good quality product, and consistent (I&#39;ve been to the lombard location a couple of times).
I had the standard &#34;Bricks&#34; pizza, and none of the ingredients really did much for me.  My taste buds didn&#39;t get excited over any of the toppings either. No real flavor from the mild or hot italian sausage, nor red onions, which I love.

Service was quick. We arrived around 11:30 but by noon there was a line of business professional types standing in a line that reached the door.

I was surprised that this restaurant came up through yelp as &#34;kid friendly&#34; since there was no kids meal options, no small drinks, no boosters and the water cups didn&#39;t have lids. 

The pizza was just ok. I love brick oven pizza and I hoped to find some funky combinations to try. Ive been to two amazing brick oven pizza places in New Orleans and Memphis this summer and was hoping I could find a similar treasure near home. No such luck.

More than half of the crusts were black on the bottom. The crust wasn&#39;t quite doughy but I would describe it as soggy - even the blackened parts. I ended up buying a $6 PB&amp;J next door to feed my little guy since he couldn&#39;t get over the black on the bottom of the pizza.

The quatro frommage pizzas barely had any cheese on it. The kids complained about the amount of onion in the tomato sauce - and they eat onions, just not that many. 
The BBQ chicken pizza said it came with smoked Gouda but didn&#39;t taste like it. At first glance I thought the chicken was tofu cubes. It tasted like a sponge, completely unseasoned and was eventually picked off. BBQ sauce was fine.
The mild sausage was standard. 
The veggie pizza + bacon - mushrooms was decent. It was the only pizza that was eaten entirely onsite. 
The $3.50 side salad was the best part. Good dressing, not a good value.

Overall, not worth the price. Won&#39;t revisit.

My personal favorites were the Meatball Pizza and White Arugula - the flavor on both were amazing! Definitely try their house made wine, the red has a wonderful fruity flavor. Their salads and sandwiches are also great, perfect for sharing! Plan to leave some room for dessert as well...their &#34;everything but the kitchen sink&#34; cookie is to die for and they also have gelato and cakes!!! Will definitely become a regular at this restaurant - it&#39;s great for a quick lunch or dinner date with friends and family!"

The crust was soggy, and there was way too much cheese but skimpy on the toppings.  Good wood-fired pizza has a crispy crust on the bottom, with the inside perfectly cooked and chewy.  The slices were droopy and overwhelmed with sauce and grease from the cheese.  We got the Simply Spinach that was supposed to have spinach, feta, and a hint of garlic.  There was almost no feta, and there was a small piece of baby spinach for each slice (six total).  There wasn&#39;t even a hint of garlic - not even in the sauce.  We shared some bread sticks, which were served with cold marinara sauce (really?!) and the bruschetta, which was supposed to be served with bread (didn&#39;t get any).  The bruschetta was also supposed to have Parmesan - it was five slices (each) of THICKLY-sliced tomato and mozzarella and a bit of basil and a balsamic &#34;reduction.&#34; They know about as much about a balsamic reduction as they do about wood-fired pizzas.  It was balsamic dressing, not a reduction.  We each got a beer, and they were small and expensive.  The atmosphere was OK for a small pizza joint - nothing fantastic but no real downside.  

We will not be back."

Four of us visited on a Thursday evening. It was a positive experience. We ate three pizzas - the Quattro Formaggi (four cheese pizza), Artichoke Pesto &amp; Roasted Peppers, and the White Arugula (garlic, prosciutto, mozzarella, topped with fresh arugula). All were good...nothing spectacular...but good pizza.

You place your order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. As a pizza joint, it is a little pricey. A pizza can feed two diners with average-size appetites and pizzas are generally about $12. Our group of four adults ordered three pizzas and an appetizer (Caprese). We brought about 2/3 of a pizza home."

I have been going to the one in Lombard here and there but now that the shop in Wheaton opened, I&#39;ve been twice in three days. I had the BBQ Chicken and Gouda pizza and I can&#39;t wait to go back and have a salad. They have their own craft wine and beer which is awesome. The crust is PERFECT. They have gelato and it&#39;s cafe style which is something that&#39;s been sorely missing in Wheaton at this quality. Great for an affordable dinner out or, if you feel like indulging, for adding the wine and chocolate cake. Someone complained about the music but I was too distracted by the wonderful flavor to even notice. The price thing isn&#39;t working for me right now but their pizzas are I think around 12&#34; and generally cost around $10 (a little more if you get specialty pizzas)."

The wait for our pizza was longer than they told us it would be - they said 10 minutes, and it was closer to 40 minutes - but because we ate there only 2 days after they opened, we expected a few hiccups like that. The dining area is quite small, so be prepared to either order to-go or hunt for a table that opens up.

The meatballs were absolutely terrible, one bite and done.

I like that they have a very good variety of types of pizza.  The unique flavors are very satisfying.  Although, there are a few really good sure bets on the menu, there are a couple of misses.
Taco Pizza is really tasty and is good when you want a bit of Mexican flare added on to your meal.
Buffalo Chicken Pizza, tastes just as advertised like buffalo chicken with mozzarella on top.
Firestarter is probably one of my favorites.  It is a little spicy because of the jalapeno and you have the saltiness of the bacon combined with the sweetness of the barbecue sauce.  It&#39;s probably their best pie.
The Spinach Artichoke pizza is not one that I am a fan of,  it is pretty dry and needs a bit more of the sauce.
As far as wings go, their seemingly very fattening Parmesan Garlic are my favorite.  I&#39;ve only tried the spicy BBQ other than that and it just tastes like a spicy version of a bottled BBQ sauce.  Seems very much like something you can easily make at home.

We walked in and we saw that we had to place our order at the counter., they call our number and we pick it up. 
We both went with the brisket plate. It came with a choice of potato, a piece of garlic bread and coleslaw. 
The restaurant is very spacious and it&#39;s decorated western style. Kinda tacky but it goes with their theme. They have tvs mounted on the wall. 
While choosing a place to sit we noticed a lot of the tables had not been wiped down after people&#39;s meals. 
We didn&#39;t have to wait long. Our number was called about 5 min later. My food... Oh my! It was a joke! There was nothing BBQ about this brisket other than the BBQ sauce. The meat did not taste like it had been cooked on any sort of grill, certainly not smoked in any wood, which is what their sign says. 
The brisket was drenched in BBQ sauce and I think it&#39;s to mask the fact that their meat is not smoked. It made me think that it&#39;s just microwaved in back and doused in smokey flavored sauce. 
I could not eat my meal. The &#34;Greek&#34; potatoes were decent but not good enough for me to ever set foot in this establishment. 
Stay away!!! This place is advertising something they don&#39;t offer, real BBQ. What a joke!

The exterior and the interior of the building are inviting and clean.  From the outside, you can tell this place is a BBQ place.

Hospitality:  I have to say that everyone in this place does have great customer service.  They were very friendly while maintaining quickness and accuracy.  They smile and are very friendly.

Upon entering the location, it was very easy to navigate and was marked clearly &#34;order here&#34;, &#34;pick up here&#34;.  I wish that clarity had made it&#39;s way to the menu.  The menu looks like a greek gyro shop with BBQ slammed in the middle.  The sides don&#39;t seem to compliment bbq at all.  I didn&#39;t see Potato Salad, Cole Slaw, String Beans, etc.  I did see Mac n&#39; Cheese but given the potentially overly frozen nature of all the other sides, I wasn&#39;t going to risk it.  Link to their menu: http://www.gematoswoodpitbbq.com/menu_naperville.php

Getting past the initial confusion around Gyro or BBQ, I ordered my normal BBQ taste test item:  Burnt Ends no sawce.  (If you are unfamiliar with Burnt Ends, make yourself familiar.)  I could taste smoke on this meat (unlike at Q-BBQ in naperville) and I&#39;m guessing that they are using hickory wood (which is good).  It appears that they finish the meat on a well-seasoned wood grill which gives the meat a bit of the char (which I love).  So on BBQ alone, I think they do a pretty good job.

SAWCE:  I normally don&#39;t like bbq sawce, but I saw some of the other reviews and I thought I&#39;d give my opinion on the matter.  Tasted store bought and wasn&#39;t good.  They might make it in house, but something is off.

Location:  They really need to move.  This location is just about the worse place ever.  It&#39;s in a run down parking lot of a closed super store.  To top it off, the building is surrounded by overflow vehicles from the car dealerships.

I think if they made some of the following changes, it would improve their restaurant:
1. Drop the Greek stuff off the menu
2. Focus on making fresh sides that compliment BBQ
3. Make their own bbq sauce
4. Change Locations"

The ribs, brisket and pork were all very good. Very tender and moist. The ribs pulled right off the bone.
Ordering to go you can&#39;t expect much from fries but they were actually still crispy. 
The side of bread is just meh. Nothing exciting, its a piece of hoagie bun. 
The baked potato was decent, but could have been cooked a little longer, it was an al dente potato. 
The coleslaw doesn&#39;t look like much but it was actually really good, on the sweeter side. I was just disappointed because i wanted baked beans instead.

They aren&#39;t overly pricey, about what you expect for bbq. 2 people is around $30. 

They have a lot of other great food. I love to come with my mom and split the 2 hot dogs special. We&#39;ve been coming here for years.
They have good sandwiches and some greek options. Good hefty portions for your money.  You won&#39;t be hungry for a long time after you eat here.

Out back there&#39;s a huge stack of oak wood, so you know you&#39;re going to get authentically smoked meats. Service at the center was quick and friendly. They gave me a couple extra sauces when I asked. 

Tried the pulled pork and sliced brisket, both were tender and smoky without falling apart. Pulled pork was noticeably smokier. Quality meat. Sauce was ok, i&#39;d prefer it without to be honest. Fries are fries, who cares. What matters is the meat, and Gemato&#39;s does it right. 

I&#39;ve been to barbecue places across the US, Kansas City, Texas, etc. and this is real deal stuff. 

Don&#39;t listen to the whiners, this is a good place for families, lunch, dinner, to-go orders, whatever the case may be. Prices were very fair considering the large portions. Check it out if you&#39;re a BBQ fan."

Hubs got the &#34;triple pleasure&#34; (which consisted of 1/4 rack of ribs, 1/4 of a chicken, gyro meat-with pita, fries and a drink) while I got a Italian beef and cheese fries. Overall I wasn&#39;t impressed. Italian beef was fairly typical, as were the fries. Hubs, however, thought it was good, bbq sauce was sweet, a plus. All better than average, but not the best he&#39;s had.

The fries were mediocre at best. Won&#39;t be returning.
All good BBQ places have 3 things: 
-a smokey smell upon entering the joint, 
-a roll of paper towels on each table, and 
-at least 2 versions of their own homemade sauce available as well because the meat should be good enough to stand-alone &amp; they should be creative enough to create a more flavorful sauce. 

Any of those things are missing, you&#39;re eating at a half-assed BBQ place. Why settle for mediocrity? The laziness in the food here is not worth the price -it wasn&#39;t cheap!"

This is the first time I&#39;ve been in the restaurant even thought I&#39;ve driven past it for years. 

My first experience of the restaurant was not that good.  Since I had never been there before I asked the person behind the counter about size of a sandwich said it was about 6 ounces.  I asked about how about a dinner he was its larger and was you keep switching your mine kind of rudely.   Being able to give your customers information about your product should be done friends and with detail when asked and it was not.


I did order a bbq brisket sandwich.  Size was good.  However, unlike most bbq places they drenched the sandwich in sauce.  I am more use to having bbq sauce at the table were one can put it on to there own desire.  The bbq sauce was a commercially bought one: some thing like a cattle man style sauce.   It was extra sweet with a hint of spice at the end.  
The meat did pull apart fine.  But with all the sauce could not get a taste of brisket it self.

It may be years before I go back.  For the price I can get better service and a more traditional bbq."

It has a counter to order your food and a window where you pick up your food. Behind the order Connor are two gentlemen with long beards that both look to be Greek. The menu is not your typical barbecue but contains great barbecue dishes such as brisket and ribs. The difference is it also includes all kinds of Greek dishes including Greek potatoes Greek chicken ,gyros  and more. I ordered a combo platter which included Greek chicken gyros and Greek potatoes and Greek chicken but also barbecue ribs. The food was great and the price was low.

After debating where to go eat Friday night, I decided upon Gemato&#39;s, as I figured it wouldn&#39;t be super crowded due to Good Friday. Eager to get my meat fix (&#39;cause I don&#39;t participate in that &#34;no meat on Fridays&#34; biz), I trucked on over.

I entered a bit backwards (came in the door closest to the pickup area), but I found my way to the ordering register. The two gentlemen working were very friendly and patient as I contemplated my order. I decided on the chicken fajita sandwich with a side of rice. The sandwich has fresh grilled onion, green bell peppers, tomato, and white meat chicken served in a pita. I paid and went and sat in a booth.

The decor, while dated, certainly holds a true western vibe. The booth seating was annoying, as the benches are connected but separated by the backrest. I had an Elitest Naperville family sit behind me and their two tweens decided to bounce around and shift the bench (and god forbid the parents tell them to behave or settle down).

Finally my number was called. I went up and grabbed my meal. The first thing I noticed is all of the veggies and chicken were on top of the flat pita bread. Not a big deal, but I thought as a &#34;sandwich&#34;, the meat and veggies would have been stuffed inside the bread in a cozy cocoon. Nonetheless, due to the amount of food, there was simply no way of folding it up &#34;taco style&#34; to eat so I had to go the fork and knife route. 

The chicken was excellent, as were the onions and bell peppers. I didn&#39;t try the tomatoes, as my GERD was acting up and I really didn&#39;t need additional heartburn. The pita was soft and fresh.
The rice was.... just okay. Rather bland, with tiny bits of carrot scattered about. I know rice isn&#39;t the star attraction here but I could only manage a handful of bites before giving up on it entirely.

My fiance has said their gyros are amazing, which I can believe because the cook was nice enough to incorporate a few slices of gyro meat with my order. Not sure if it was accidental or intentional (&#34;Eat this and love it! Then get gyros to go!&#34;) but either way I was able to get a taste. Despite their limited menu (according to my palate) I&#39;ll certainly be back to try the gyros, hot dog, Italian beef, and Patty Melt."

Much to my suprise we pull up the restaurant and see a large pile of hardwood just outside the backdoor. The aroma coming from the burning wood was enough to wet the appetite for what was on the menu.

I ordered the Brisket and links. The brisket melted in my mouth, it was the most tender brisket I have ever had. The barbecue sauce is a slightly tangy sauce that complimented the brisket.

The kids had pulled pork sandwiches and finished evry bite. They loved it.

We eat in mostly, but have become fans of carrying out recently. The #4 and #5 combos easily fill up 6 people. And since you can substitute items, it&#39;s always exactly how we want the food.

So it&#39;s dinner time...Saturday PM, and every place is crowded, right?!  My Mom and I settled for BBQ, and I thought of Q BBQ in downtown Naperville, then thought...oh that&#39;s going to be crowded so we thought maybe Texas Roadhouse would be a good option...not.  We couldn&#39;t even find a parking spot.  I was ok with not being at a sit down/get waited on place if I could get some good grub.  Then this place popped up in my mind!  

This isn&#39;t the sit down and get waited on place, but it was exactly what I needed at the time, and I was fine with it.
We both got the half slab rib dinner... and some appetizers for starters (fried cauliflower and zucchini).  I will say, the ribs were awesome!!! Like fall of the bone meat...not the itty bitty amount of beef you have to naw off with your teeth.  I was very impressed by the food at this place.  It was quick too!  If I&#39;m in the mood for some BBQ, I will go back!!!"

I ordered a rib tip and brisket combo for lunch, with fries and drink. The total bill was $18.00. For that amount of money I was expecting an incredible meal. The food came up fast, as it seems to be prepared and ready to order. The rib tips were awful and the brisket tasted like it was cooked in an oven, not over a wood pit. Their meat is over sauced as well, there was a puddle of sauce over the meat. You get very little flavor from the meat, as the sauce is so overpowering. Why can&#39;t a bottle of sauce be put on the table, or given with your order? If you want good BBQ, go to Q in downtown Naperville. I will not visit Gematos again as it is to pricey, and to much sauce. Very one dimensional BBQ"

The bad:  Apparently there is a stupid and silly setup here in terms of tipping.  I placed my order at the order counter and put a standard tip on the order.   But, when you get to the pickup window the guys who prepare your food have their own tip jar.  One of them was so bold as to speak to me about  a tip.  I explained that I had placed it on the ticket and he informed me that  they get none of that.   This is BS.   Now, I don&#39;t go there unless I have cash in my pocket (read: never) so that I can tip he guys in the back.  The fact that I am pressured to carry cash ticks me off.  But what doubly ticks me off is that the owners at the counter are quite happy to take your 15-20% tip and never say a word about how they are not sharing it.

Sad to say, I have stopped going there for just this reason.  I gave this place 3 stars because, if you regularly carry cash, then you&#39;ll be fine.  Just know not to give the guy who took your order very much, if anything, tip-wise and to save your tip funds for the pickup counter.

If you only carry plastic like me - my rating for this place is 1 star because of this issue.  Stupid silly deceptive and depressing setup by the owners.  Fix it.  (but sadly I&#39;ll never know if you do)"

It&#39;s hard to believe that Naperville has some food with a soul.  It&#39;s also one of the best values for barbecue in town.  A lunch combo for around $10 is not bad at all.

It&#39;s a combination of a Chicago style gyro joint and a barbecue joint.  So you can get a gyro or rib tips and you can replace the fries for soup.

I&#39;ve tried the gyros once and they were ok.  The only reason I had them at all is because I started going their regularly and on occasion I thought of trying something else.  The reality is you have to get barbecue here.  That&#39;s why you&#39;re there.  The meat is smoked on site.  They only use one sauce and they apply it.  But it&#39;s damn good.  Everything is cooked just right.  I did notice that the chicken comes precooked and then is heated on their cooker - I never ordered it so I can&#39;t say if it&#39;s good or not.

The room is a bit hokey with their old west decor.  But the recent expansion offers plenty of places to sit.  Those hoping for a quieter outing may prefer to sit furthest away from the kitchen since the staff will boom order numbers when they become ready.  My friends and I consider this part of the appeal, but I know that may not be for everyone."

Kitchen staff seems arrogant and they are a bit rude.

Sides are not worth mentioning.

If you want a taste of real Southern BBQ (and I&#39;m a Southerner so I should know) head into downtown Naperville and try Q, or head south on 59 and give Sharkos  a try."

I had the chicken gyro. I asked for cucumber sauce (instead of honey mustard) and asked to add onions (see picture). It was tasty, and very filling. I also had a chef salad as my side. The homemade greek vinaigrette was very tasty, but I wished the lettuce pieces would&#39;ve been smaller, and that the other veggies were chopped, rather than presented in large pieces (see picture).

Dad had the ribs and fries, and pretty much licked his plate clean. Mom had the pulled pork plate with fries. She enjoyed it, but thought the pork was a little salty/over-seasoned today. She also wasn&#39;t a fan of the oil/butter they soaked the toasted bread in."

Comfortable atmosphere. (We were there for early dinner, around 5:15 on a Wednesday, so it was largely empty, though they seemed to have a steady stream of to-go orders.)

I had Gemato&#39;s Wood Pit Combo. A very good deal for the money ($15.50); I came away quite satiated. Brisket was delicious, tender, perfectly cooked. Ditto for ribs. Chicken was good except for my taste it was much too salty. (The cook asked how things were and seemed genuinely interested to know about this.) Baked potato was good; baked beans were good (sauce a little on the watery side).

My nephew had the burger and fries, which he enjoyed; they looked great, and again, a good deal for a sizable burger ($5.80 for a grilled burger that looked larger than the advertised quarter-pound), with a generous order of fries ($2.50).

NOTE: Gemato&#39;s uses Chicago-style BBQ sauce (red, sweeter), which is my preference. If you prefer southern style (Louisiana or stout, orange, more vinegary), you might try Q-BBQ: I haven&#39;t been there, but other reviewers report Q offers a variety of sauces including Louisiana style."

I enjoy the brisket as well.   I have also tried the pulled pork, ribs, chicken, rib tips, pork kebabs, and gyros.   They are all prepared very nicely, and all have a suitable amount of snow flavor; not to much, not to little.  Their sauce packs a punch of sweet vinegary flavor. 
They have two brothers beer to go along with some popular domestics and imports.   I have never tried any desserts, because I usually stuff myself with too much BBQ!  The service is fine-it&#39;s a walk up place, so no servers.   I like it for this type of place.   The restaurant is always clean, including the washrooms from what I&#39;ve experienced. 

They are expanding their dining room currently, but they are remaining open during the construction, so don&#39;t be turned off by the current appearance!   The food is still top-notch.

We decided to meet up here with some family that&#39;s visiting out of town. We got there a bit early so we decided we would get a platter and some fries to get us going. The total came out just shy of $15 so I gave the old man behind the counter a $20 and a $5 this way I would end up with just a single $10 bill ( I carry cash most of the time, so less bills works better ). Anyway the old man must have miscounted because I just got a few coins back. When I mentioned that to him, he seemed a bit puzzled but decided to show me the open register and then went on some tirade about coming over to his house...?!?  I&#39;m not exactly sure what was his deal but I decided not to make a scene over ten bucks, but it definitively could have been handled better...

Fantastic sauce, very good ribs, pretty good chicken, pretty good brisket, good fries.  Really if you order a wood pit combo you will have 2 meals.  If you order a double with your petite girlfriend you&#39;ll have 3 large meals.  The double is seriously the size of a jewel bag tied by just the tips of the handles.

Everything is pretty good here.  The only thing I wish is that there was a bit more BBQ included with the takeout orders.

This is your standard grilled food cooked over wood instead of charcoal.  Don&#39;t expect that slow smoked flavor to which you&#39;re accustomed. 

The ribs and brisket were typically tender although the chicken was borderline dry.  Pulled pork was overcooked and hard. 

There are no choices of sauce. You can only use their extremely sweet and sugary sauce that will send a diabetic to the ER.

I came here based on the great reviews on Yelp.  The menu looked promising, and seemed like a good bang for the buck.  This should&#39;ve been my first sign of what was to come later.   

I ordered the combo: BBQ Chicken, Ribs and Brisket.  When I picked up the food I was in awe at the amount of food and I started salivating.  I was ready to chow down.  I first went for the brisket (my favorite), and immediately lost my appetite as I chewed.  The brisket is not smoked at ALL.  It tastes like they lightly seasoned it and then slow roasted it in an oven.  Followed by slopping it with their mediocre sauce.  The ribs were just okay.  I felt they were overcooked, and the meat&#39;s flavor was again, somewhat bland.  The chicken was the best part of the meal, but yet it was still just okay.  The dark meat was moist (as expected), but the white meat was BONE DRY and bland.  For my sides, I had fries (typical frozen crinkle cut fries - boring) and the baked beans (tasted like Bush&#39;s baked beans with a crapload of black pepper - yuck).  

Also, they had no wet naps anywhere.  What BBQ place doesn&#39;t offer wet naps?  Lame. 

I honestly would expect food of this caliber from the cafeteria at my office.  I really don&#39;t plan on coming back."

I got the ribs and brisket combo. They slab on a lot of BBQ sauce which is fine. However the meat seems slightly overcooked. There isn&#39;t much fat in the meat which makes it relatively healthy. However, due to the lack of fat, especially on the brisket, there is a bland taste of BBQ masked by the sauce.

I never have really had much positive experience with Vietnamese food as I sometimes found that it was too salty for my liking. While visiting family in the city, they suggested this as one of their favorite places for great Pho. The quaint little restaurant seats about 25 but while we were eating there were never less than ten people waiting for a seat.

Knowing that I didn&#39;t particularly like beef broth, I tried the Pho listed with chicken instead. That was the moment I realized I could get behind all the Pho game. The portions were delicious and very filling.

I was lucky to be able to also try the fried shrimp egg rolls which were delicious, crunchy, and moist. Everything you want from an egg roll without having to drown it in sauce.

They are legit, authentic, the real deal! I had the Bánh mì and the Pho with all the different types of meats (had to try them all to see which I would order exclusively next time) but after trying them all I would order this exact style again (it had steak, brisket, meatball, and other delicious cuts of meat) 

But don&#39;t let me forget about that sandwich!! Now I&#39;m Mexican and we have legendary sandwiches called tortas but these rank just as high! They are absolutely delicious,i had the house specialty with all the trimmings and it was the highlight of the visit. 

Only bad part was that the sprite I ordered tasted funny, I initially thought it was the Sprite but after sipping some straight from the can as opposed to from the iced cup they gave me i realized it was either the cup or ice (most likely the ice) that had an off taste to it. Either way I hardly noticed, I&#39;m coming back here without a doubt (might turn into a regular)"

I always get excited when I introduce my people&#39;s food to others because I honestly believe Vietnamese food is one of the best out there. 

Because we got there at 12:15, there was a wait for the table. The restaurant is pretty small so we were consistently in the way. When we were seated, we waited a little for someone to take our order.

I got the grilled marinated pork banh mi. It was amazing. You have a warm toasty french roll stuffed with pickled dichon radish and carrots. Then, chopped sweet pork layered in the bun. To top it off, I got sliced jalapeños and cilantro. This is a winning combination. It&#39;s light and healthy, and even the pickiest eaters would love a banh mi.

I have a few minor issues with the place. I think service was a little slow and the waiter must have had a bad day because he definitely write a stinky face. Also, the interior looked a bit old and dirty. This didn&#39;t negate the food though. The food was a total win for me."

We started off with shrimp egg rolls. They were perfectly crispy and delicious! You can tell they change the oil here which is always a good thing.

Banh mis are cheap &amp; also good, I just prefer more meat to bread ratio so next time I&#39;d order with extra meat. 

But I recently tried their avocado bubble tea, and it was the worst I&#39;ve ever had. The tapioca bubbles weren&#39;t cooked enough so the insides were hard and not chewy. Service was avg, not bad, but not good. Interior needs remodeling. For those reasons, I&#39;m not sure how often I&#39;d make the drive to eat here in 2016, but I think I would next time I get a craving for their cornish hen."

Inside looked like someone&#39;s old dirty living room; smelled like they were cooking dog food &amp; rotten vegetables.

Something told me to turn around &amp; walk out the door but I&#39;ve been in plenty of places that looked &amp; smelled terrible but had AWESOME food so I figured this could be another one, based on all the previous yelp reviews I looked at.

I got the seasoned pork with rice noodles. The pork had a very interesting &amp; hard to describe flavor (not good); the noodles were cold. The portion size of the pork was a bit skimpy so I had to stretch it. The pork and noodles were layed on a bed of lettuce. Part of the lettuce tasted like mint leaves which gave the meal a not to be desired taste. It came with a strange red sauce on the side. I was going to put it on the dish but fortunately I smelled it and it had a repugnant smell to it.

Maybe I just don&#39;t like Vietnamese food. I&#39;m willing to try it again if I find another spot because I&#39;ve tried and love food from tons of different cultures. The staff was nice but needless to say, I have no intentions on returning here."

I also ordered a banh mi (viet sandwich) to go so I can eat later and that was yummy, too. My total for the BBH &amp; banh mi was about $15 after tax and tip.

We passed by this place while driving down the street.  We weren&#39;t even sure if they were open.  Luckily my Yelp app changed my mind!

The food here is delicious and inexpensive.  The hubs had a mango smoothie and I had hot tea.  We started with spring rolls.  Excellent peanut sauce.  I could had a whole bowl of it.  The hubs ordered a meal that we could not pronounce even after asking the server.  It was lettuce, rice noodles, veggies, some little eggroll looking things.  He said it was fantastic.  I had the standard sliced beef pho.  So delicious and soothing for my hangover.

As with a lot of delicious Asian places, this is no frills dining.  There is a server who takes your order and brings food but it isn&#39;t a place that fills your glass after every sip of water.  The dining room is a room for dining.  A few pieces of art on the wall.  There is no bar or alcohol.  Just good food.

I would say this place is authentic; the dining room was packed and we were the only white people....besides one man who was dining with other Asian people.  I sometimes have my doubts about an Asian place if there are no Asian customers.

The food is relatively flavorful with simple flavor combinations. It&#39;s not the best Vietnamese I&#39;ve ever had (I love extremely fresh ingredients and meat that is a little on the fattier side if in a soup and with more char if it&#39;s in a noodle salad). But it&#39;s nice if you&#39;re passing by and want well prepared Vietnamese food. The portion sizes are respectable, mostly full bowl for a bun and pho, with a decent amount of meat.

Service is okay and the cleanliness of the place is not their  main focus. My 4 star rating was based purely on their food and nothing else, for those who are simply looking for &#34;good pho&#34; on a rainy day."

I&#39;ve been to a handful of places - especially in the Northwest suburbs (Schaumburg, Libertyville, and Hoffman Estates) of Chicago and I must say that Pho Ha is pretty good!

We ordered a Pho Dat Biet and Cum Bo Luc Lac. The broth and the over experience of the Pho dish was good - the broth seemed very clean and their portions of meats were generous (although there are other places that are more generous). The Cum Bo Lac Lac was a good sized plate - a lot of vegetables though. The amount of beef in that plate was less than what we had both anticipated. It wasn&#39;t too greasy or oily from the cooking. The wait time for sitting down and being served was a bit long - if we didn&#39;t have to wait so long I think our experience would have been better. 

For what it&#39;s worth, it&#39;s a good idea to stop by if you&#39;re in the area. Glendale Heights is a far drive for us but we were in the area and I had overheard a group of rock climbers talk about this place. The prices are cheaper than what you can find in Schuamburg area."

I couldn&#39;t drink it because I did not realize that it had condensed milk in it (and I am allergic to dairy). Since it was my mistake, I paid for it and didn&#39;t drink it.

My order came with vegetables (bean sprouts and basil) that were super fresh and aromatic. It was enough food that I ate it for another meal. Also, I used the extremely fresh vegetables to make smoothies at home.

My relatives placed an order and they did not have it that day. So, they had to pick something else. This is the reason I had to downgrade to a 4."

First thing first, the soup sucks here now. I dont know what they did or who is cooking but it went from flavorful to bland and tasteless. I kept coming in hopes or finding out something different but its been disappointing. 

Today was the last straw. I ordered some food. Couple pho, sandwiches and spring rolls. I specifically ordered veggie spring rolls, because my girlfriend is vegan, and having them mess this up before I said veggie only spring roll.. I get home and there is both pork and shrimp. I figure Id call and see maybe they wanna make it up, but no the girl tells me I ordered the wrong thing and its my fault.

My +1 and I arrived with about 1.5 hours before closing and it was pretty busy: there were two available tables.  Our table was a bit dirty, so I was left wiping it off with some of the napkins at the catch-all at the table.

We started with the Spring Rolls.  I was surprised to find strips of meat (pork?) in them, as I thought most spring rolls were vegetarian, or at least only had shrimp in them.  hrm.

It was my first time with pho, and I didn&#39;t realize that there is no regular vegetarian-type broth: just beef or chicken.  Really, EVERYTHING is pretty much beef or chicken, period.  I ordered the Rice Noodle Pho (beef broth) anyway with Shrimp egg rolls (one of the few seafood options). The egg rolls were probably the best part: steaming hot, crunchy, and with a delicious sauce.   I could have just eaten those to be honest!

My companion had the Pho with Beef Meatballs and Tendon, as well as Tamarind Chicken Wings (they were out of another kind he wanted).  I didn&#39;t try any of his, but the food was definitely plentiful. 

Service was really lacking and was a bit on the cold side.  Though it was busy and seemed like there were a lot of regulars/friends/family,  I didn&#39;t feel welcome at all.

It&#39;s funny because Yelp and it&#39;s infamous Yelpers rarely lead me astray, but I just must not get this place because I was so disappointed after my visit. 

I stopped in on a Friday evening with my sister after jealously watching check-in after check-in on my Yelp feed. Parking was next to impossible which I took as a good sign. I walked in and found that my sister had snagged a table. Awesome!

I am a pho newbie and I wasn&#39;t sure what to order. Our server was of absolutely no assistance so we had an appetizer of some egg rolls and I orderef a chicken banh mi. The pho made me nervous since I wasn&#39;t sure where to start. Kinda thinking I should have jumped in head first and tried it anyway. The egg rolls were awful. Old. Chewy. Lukewarm. Generally unacceptable. I got a little nervous about my sandwich.

The chicken banh mi was definitely better than the egg rolls but not something I would rush back for anytime soon. The chicken was fresh, but lacked any real seasoning. The roll was crusty and made a mess all over my shirt. 

The service was lackluster which would almost be okay in a casual place like this, but add on top of that that it was sticky and fairly dirty everywhere and I just can&#39;t get on this bandwagon. I&#39;m not a snob (I do love a good dive) and I&#39;ll try almost anything once. Pho Ha, you&#39;re just not for me."

Other dishes are wonderful and I highly recommend an avocado smoothy with black tapioca balls.  Sounds out there but a great way to finish it off.

There are a few down falls, one is that the staff is not very interested in their customers.

It is by far the best Pho restaurant I&#39;ve been to in a while.  I understand this to be a mom and pop&#39;s restaurant so there is nothing fancy or glitzy about it.  But, for me , that&#39;s okay.  I don&#39;t eat in the restaurant so I don&#39;t know the condition of the tables, chairs, etc.  However, I will judge it by the food and my interaction with the staff.  Here is what I came with:
*  If you&#39;re ok with mediocre customer service and provides awesome food, this is the place for you.  
*  If you&#39;re okay with straight forward, give your order with no fluff but the food comes out great, this is the place to go.  
*  If you&#39;re okay with the cashier not smiling at you, being nice and friendly, but provide food that feels like home then come on over.

From Pho to rice dish and to the noodles, I found the food very satisfying to my pallet and I would come here over and over again.  I just have to be more open minded when coming here and know that I&#39;m getting good food and to just ignore the poor customer service.  

My star rating consist of 4 stars for the food and 1 star for customer service.  Although, I feel very bad giving this restaurant this review because my last review for another restaurant that gave me inadequate customer service I did not give a pleasant review and was very harsh with my words.

My first visit I got the Pho tai bo vien (beef flanks and meet balls) and this time I got the mi/hu tieu (egg noodle/rice noodle soup). Both dishes did have a body of flavor and portion sizes were decent enough to fill you up. The pho was tastey on it&#39;s own without sirracha or hoisin sauce. From my experience, traditionally the Vietnamese version of hu tieu is tastier with fish sauce, lemon, and chili (all of which was accessible). Pho Ha would be recommended if you cannot get into the city to get your pho or Vietnamese food fix. 

This visit was during a huge rush for the New Year and I assume that the staff did not expect the volume of patrons towards the end of the night. There is no wait system, no reservation system, and you are to awlwardly stand and wait your turn without any aknowledgement from the staff. Even after our meal while paying, we received terrible attitude from one of the young employees.

Customer service here is nonexistent. Upon walking in, I felt like I was bothering them than a guest that was spending $50. What&#39;s up with the mean mugging?!? I don&#39;t get it. Did you not want us here? 

Asked if they had Thai tea and Muscle Head, snarky reply was, &#34;No, we&#39;re Vietnamese not Thai.&#34; Oooookkkkk. Ordered the Vietnamese coffee instead. He took our ordered and looked annoyed/pissed that we dare ask such question. Brought out the coffee in styrofoam cup. I felt like he intentionally didn&#39;t fill it up. It was all ice and 40% coffee. I didn&#39;t feel like asking for more coffee cause I KNEW I would get the eye roll and more attitude.  Went back to the counter and talked shit about us cause Glasses Guy was looking over at our table. 

None the less, the pho was aiiight and the Cornish hen was surprising crispy. But was it worth the horrible service and unwelcome atmosphere? No, I&#39;d rather give my business to those that appreciate it."

Bold words since Viet Town is 30 miles from this place but it&#39;s no joke. With pho, it&#39;s all about the broth and Pho Ha&#39;s is number one - pho real. 

To start, the broth is a true consommé which is clear and flavorful. It requires additional steps and takes a lot of time but at Pho Ha, it&#39;s done perfectly right. Once you taste it, you&#39;ll be taken away by the intensity of flavor. The broth has a clean flavor that isn&#39;t oily at all. At some places, you&#39;ll see oil on the surface of the broth which isn&#39;t appetizing. 

There are also other items on the menu that don&#39;t require broth and are my favorite dishes to order. My favorite is the egg noodle with shrimp, BBQ pork, and fish cake. I order this dry with soup on the side - it&#39;s similar to a traditional Thai bamee dish that I would eat in Thailand. 

Don&#39;t forget the spring rolls and bahn mi sandwiches. The spring rolls always taste fresh and come with a peanut sauce for dipping. There is a limited selection of bahn mi sandwiches but for only $3, I end up getting two anyways. 

The prices are inexpensive and for the quality, you will keep coming back for more - pho sure."

I wish I could separately rate the food with the service, as is the food is INCREDIBLE. The broth is flavorful, the meat is delicious. I had the... pho tai? The beef with the meatballs. Delicious. Although I can&#39;t remember the meatballs as good as the beef..

The reason why I knocked off two stars, the place is small (not the owners fault) where other hungry customers hover next to your table and make you feel rushed and uncomfortable. Back off. I was under the assumption when walking in initially that you are seated by a host, but that is not the case. You seat yourself. Also, The waitress never checked in with me once to see how my food was. My water was never filled, it was more than half empty, and the waiter never came around until the very end, and still not fill it. And getting the bill was a chore in itself. I sat about 10 minutes with an empty bowl on my table waiting for someone to come by. Only when a man had to clear a couple of tables for a large group that came in, then he saw me sitting there waiting.

I wish I could have rated it higher. I only tried one dish on the menu and found it to be superb. The service was awful though. But I&#39;d definitely go back for the food alone and try the other dishes my fellow yelpers recommended"

It&#39;s really small and tight, but the turnover was really fast. We waited about 10 minutes on a busy Sunday afternoon, around 1pm.

I got the Pho with sliced beef and brisket (25), and it was tender and savory. This place is one of the few that serve mint in addition to basil, sprouts, lime, jalapeños, and cabbage. All the great sauces are on the table.

My wife got the Special Vietnamese broth with pork, fish, shrimp, and eggplant (41). It had a flavor that I had never experienced before, yet seemed vaguely familiar. Delicious, but definitely meant for seafood lovers like my wife and me.

There was also a special menu and we ordered the tamarind chicken wings. These are a must try! They offered to make them spicy, but we opted to have the spice on the side so we could share with our son. Next time we&#39;ll do it with the spice full on!

Prices here are reasonable, but I would be happier if they went down by a dollar or two. Still the price is not going to stop me from coming back, and trying more of the menu!"

The people are great, it&#39;s a friendly family run restaurant.   I ordered the pork skin fresh rolls.  I didn&#39;t detect any meat in them but my major complaint was the texture and the lack of any flavor.  I didn&#39;t finish them.  They didn&#39;t come with anything but fish sauce either.  
I finished with a very solid bowl of chicken pho.  It came with all the usual condiments in good quantity.  It was aok.

Can&#39;t beat prices like that. I had the grilled pork bahn mi and it was excellent. The pork was a little too chewy at times but the amazing bread made up for it. It was warm and fresh and soft and everything you could ask for in terms of great bread. 

I topped it off with a watermelon bubble tea which was super refreshing and very sweet. One thing to be aware of is they have a minimum charge of $15 in order to use a credit card, so make sure to have some cash on hand before coming by!"

However, the husband loves the food.  We got spring rolls, which were quite delicious with the peanut sauce they provided. I got a 29, which I think was pho with steak.  It was tasty, if not a bit bland. I added sauce to mine, along with all the sides it came with.

Times are a little different now with a little one so I mostly take my Pho to go. Service is always nice, the orders are always prompt and the price is always right. 

My faves: 
Pho Tai--beef noodle soup with slice beef steak. The broth is always fragrant and flavorful, and the beef is always fresh. Accompanied by a lot of fresh bean sprouts, basil and jalepeno. Add the Siracha of course and it&#39;s even more magical.
Goi Cuon--fresh springrolls with shrimp, pork and veggies.  Very fresh, well-wrapped. totally delicious.They must know me now because whenever I order they always give me one small container of delicious peanut sauce PER springroll. I LOVE that sauce.

And a new fave: 
Com Tam Suon Nuong--Grilled marinated pork chop served with rice. I love their rice, it&#39;s totally home spun asian style, like how my relatives cook it in the Philippines. it&#39;s not fluffy Uncle Bens type or sticky rice. I can&#39;t really explain it, it just reminds me of visiting the Philippines. The pork is very tender and so tasty.

Let&#39;s be real though, I have a real thing for ethnic food of all kinds.  It just so happened, this week was my first encounter with Vietnamese.

So, Cristie B. and I have been *trying* to plan a dinner for, legit, months now, and it FINALLY happened at Pho Ha on Tuesday.  The weather was damn cold and shitty, so something warm and comforting sounded just perfect (without breaking the calorie budget.)  Cristie suggested Pho, and I was all over it.

As mentioned in previous reviews:
1) yes, its very small inside.  There were maybe six tables?  When I arrived at 5:15 a few were open, but when we left just after 7, they were packed.
2) sure, it&#39;s a little divey/dingey.  These places generally, in my experience, have the most authentic food.
3) yeah, the service wasn&#39;t terribly attentive, but, only *after* the food came.  We were offered beverages and to order right away, and the food came out hot and fast.

So, what did I eat?  #25 - Pho with sliced beef and brisket.  Also, #2, Vietnamese spring rolls with pork and shrimp.

Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING I shoveled into my pie hole that night was glorious.  The peanut sauce at this joint is TO DIE.  The spring rolls were fresh and stuffed with awesome, fresh flavors.  PHO?  OMG.  When Cristie told me that this was miracle soup, she wasn&#39;t kidding.  I jazzed mine up with a TON of beansprouts, thai basil, and let a slice of jalapeno sit in there for a bit... perfect.  The broth wasn&#39;t greasy, it was clean and deep with flavor.  The noodles were perfect for slurping, I make not excuses for the noises I made while eating.  I ordered a &#34;small&#34; bowl (a large is only 50 cents more, by the way) and had enough leftover to take for lunch the next day.

AAAND, to top it off... my dinner, including tip, cost thirteen dollars.  That&#39;s insane.

You can bet that I&#39;ll be back at Pho Ha soon, and looking for Pho closer to my house!"

Not having eaten Vietnamese food before visiting this restaurant, I went in to this experience with an open mind. I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. I had only read one or two of the reviews on Yelp and I had heard from people personally that this was a place to def try. 

I had seen some photos of their dishes on Yelp that looked delicious and my sister agreed to check this out with me on an evening we had some time for a quick meal. 

At first, I walked in and was invited to sit whereever I chose. My sis hadn&#39;t shown up yet, so I picked a table in the corner. The first thing I noticed was the table and the items on the table were dirty. Everything was on a food tray that had food, salt and pepper all settled on it. It was dirty and need to be cleaned. The floor had on it and not just a little crumb...I&#39;m talking about a full piece of lettuce and a cucumber and some noodles. It was gross. Why hasn&#39;t anyone cleaned this stuff up? But ok, so many people say this place is excellent, so I&#39;m thinking the food will be their saving grace. 

We ordered the egg rolls to start. They were chewy; almost as if they were not fresh. I think they may have been fried twice. Damn it! I wanted to like this place! But wait, let&#39;s see how our meals are.

I tried the cornish hen and I have to say the flavor WAS there. I can see the appeal. But it was greasy!

I tried my sister&#39;s sandwich and again it was good but there wasn&#39;t much meat. (disappointed sigh)

I couldn&#39;t wait to leave but I had to use the restroom before departing. Funnily enough, the bathroom was cleaner than the dining room.  Now I&#39;m just done. Let&#39;s roll!

Not returning."

Spring rolls - how can you mess these up?!

Beef and meatball pho (I like this combo but you&#39;ll have to ask for it because for whatever reason it isn&#39;t a listed option) - textbook perfect, with rich, spicy broth, lean shavings of beef, and fat, juicy slices of meatball.

Chicken pho - The simpler broth is so comforting, but I&#39;m knocking my rating down a star because of giant pieces of chicken with skin and gristle still clinging on. 

The bountiful veggies snap with freshness, and there&#39;s even that sawleaf coriander that I cannot get enough of. SCORE."

This is the place to go! They have a wide varieties of Pho (noodle soup), to Banh Mi (sandwiches), to Com Gia (rice dishes)!

The Pho is very tasty and flavorful, has a generous amount of noodles and meat (beef slices, beef flanks), among other things. I love getting it during the winter because its warms you up during those cold days.

The Com Ga (fried baby hen with white rice and a side of broth) is to die for! The baby hen is marinated overnight then its deep fried and all the seasoning is soaked into  the meat. This is one of my favorite dish because its extra crispy and flavorful.

The Com Ba Luc Lac (diced marinated beef with green and red peppers and onions, and side of broth with thinly sliced onions) is one of my friend&#39;s favorite because this also has a lot of flavor and the beef is cook to perfection.

Now on to the sandwiches, the bread is warm and crispy when it&#39;s served. The selection is vast. You can get chicken, grilled pork, or various meat. I highly recommend them.

Overall, I&#39;ve never had a bad experience and I haven&#39;t been there enough to try everything, but I greatly recommend this place and the price is cheap! You can get an entire meal for under $10!"

It&#39;s a small place in a strip mall - definitely not a place you would think would have great food. But my friend Crisitie B. swears by it. So we went. First off, their smoothies are amazing. The watermelon smoothie with tapioca is literally addicting. I have been craving it ever day since. Their spring rolls are pretty much to die for - the peanut sauce they serve is exceptional. And their Pho is great. I didn&#39;t really even know what Pho was, but they have a nice variety to choose from. Some on the safer side (some with tenderloin or meatbaslls), others with tendons. 

Whatever you feel comfortable with. the only bad part was I felt that the service was lacking. We had probably 4 different people serve us, and I felt like we waited a while sometimes to be served.

We started with spring rolls and egg rolls. They were both very good and fresh and well presented. My bf and I then got smoothies and those were really really good. Probably the best smoothie with tapioca I&#39;ve ever had! 

I can&#39;t recall the exact name if the dish I got but it was a noodle soup that was hot and spicy with beef and that was it. At first bite, I thought that I should have gotten something else because it was very got temperature wise which didn&#39;t help the already hot and and spicy flavor. 

After eating through it more, the beef was very good and tender and after it cooled down a bit, I couldn&#39;t stop eating it. So good!! 

I will definitely be coming back here!"

I go here for pho every time I&#39;m sick - and I swear this traditional breakfast soup is MAGIC! It can cure anything.

This place is a hidden gem. Really small, but it gives it a homey, cozy vibe. The service is great - really fast, friendly, and attentive.

The food is out of this world. My favorite is the beef pho with all the trimmings. The broth has a super rich flavor, and tastes like the real deal - not that sodium-laced crap you get at other places. The noodles are perfectly slurp-able and the meat is tender and VERY clean. A lot of times with organ meats people complain about the &#34;earthy&#34; flavor, but this stuff is as good as it gets. The add-ins are very fresh: bean sprouts, basil, hot peppers, and a great variety of sauces.

The bubble teas (more like smoothies or slushies, for those of you who aren&#39;t familiar) with tapioca beads are AWESOME.

Prices are fair, and the menu has a lot of other selections: appetizers, soups, noodle dishes, rice dishes, entrees, desserts, coffee and tea drinks.

I&#39;ve been going here for years now, and it&#39;s nothing less than I expect every time! I love this place. Definitely worth a try - even if it&#39;s a far hike for you. You won&#39;t be disappointed!"

I started to enjoy eating pho...I&#39;ve been to Pho Ha often with different friends/co-workers and we enjoy eating here every time...

I&#39;ve been here during lunch times during the week and weekends and although it is busy sometimes, the wait to get seated is usually not too long....

Pros: the Pho tastes good....the service is good....the price is very reasonable (I think it was around $7 for Pho and they give you a lot)...the bahn mi sandwiches costs around $5 (i think), but i&#39;ve never personally tried it myself so I can&#39;t tell you how it tastes, but my friend that has tried it said it tastes good...

Cons: it is a family owned business so it doesn&#39;t look the best in the inside and sometimes is not fully air conditioned? ...but it doesn&#39;t matter to me as long as the food tastes good..

Good to know:  you need to spend at least $10 (i think that was the amount) to use your credit card.. otherwise, just bring cash!"

It was my first Vietnamese food experience, and I was hooked.  The restaurant is small and family owned - it doesn&#39;t have any fancy decor, but that is NOT why you go to Pho Ha.  You go for the exceptional and hot pho, fresh spring rolls, tasty banh mi, and crispy delicious pork chops.  Or at least... that is why WE go.

Service is quick and although the waiters aren&#39;t super chatty, they get the job done.  The wait on the weekends can be pretty long, but we usually like getting it to-go (to enjoy sans pants and plus drinks at home) or enjoying it during the week.

I DEFINITELY recommend trying this little suburban jewel out -- it is honestly one of the only places the boyfriend and I go to regularly because I&#39;m so big on trying new places.. but when you find something good, you just need to keep going back!"

Argyle pho in the &#39;burbs. Since discovering this place it has become a frequent destination when craving pho. The price is comparable to Chicago for pho 8 dollars for large and 7.50 for small for the combo pho. Orders are quickly taken and the pho comes out pipping hot. The broth has a slight sweet taste that is balanced with all of the other flavors. A good healthy portion of noodles with proteins rounds out the dish. You also get a plate of the thai basil, lime, jalapeno, and bean sprouts as well. Amazing summer and winter. The only down side is that the place is small and sort of hole in the wall. For my pho craving, i&#39;ll be back!

Pro: fair price for pho, quick service

Cons: hole in the wall place, don&#39;t come for the ambiance

pho-ha-glendale-heights,Cristie F.,d-KWUwwt9jGmuIBG5pyP0w,"Roselle, IL",0,1,1,414,11,kuwLH8uHFdmrZVVKZ3zeJQ,5.0,2012-02-07,"&#34;Hi, my name is Cristie and I&#39;m a Pho-alholic.&#34; 

My very first experience with Vietnamese foods was at Pho Ha - a tiny, family owned and run restaurant hidden in a shady strip mall in Glendale Heights. Since then, I will admit, I have become somewhat of a pho junkie. I&#39;ve scoured the burbs for Vietnamese shops and sampled as many bowls of pho as I have been able to find. Hands down - Pho Ha is my absolute fave. I love pho like crack addict loves their crack - maybe worse. It&#39;s borderline embarrassing when I find myself there once (sometimes twice - sigh) a week. My bf and I have our regular &#34;Pho Friday&#34; date night....slurping up noodles, mounds of meat, tasty beef broth with lime, basil, jalapeno, and bean sprouts. If that isn&#39;t romantic, I don&#39;t know what is. 

Other than traditional pho, some other favorite dishes are...
*Goi Cuon (sans shrimp). Best in the area. Pho sho.
*Com Bo Luc Lac - Rice with sizzling, tender, diced beef. Swooooon.
*Bun Bo Xao - Rice noodles with marinated sliced beef, lettuce, cucumber, and a plethora of other veggies. I also recommend throwing on some peanut sauce for fun.
*Bahn Mi Ga - Shredded chicken sandwich. The banh mi is my most recent discovery - and quite possibly may become the newest addiction
*Bahn Mi Bo Kho - This the bf loves. Beef stew with a toasted baguette. The veggies and gravy are to die for. However, I can&#39;t get past the gelatinous chunks on the meat. My stomach can&#39;t handle it. 

The prices are phonomenal. A banh mi will cost you a whopping 3-4 bucks, and a monstrous bowl of pho will cost you about $7.00. The owners and staff are usually friendly and accommodating. It&#39;s not the best service I&#39;ve experienced, but they&#39;re always fast and always willing to help you.

There are a few downsides. 
*This is a carnivore haven. In my attempt to become primarily vegetarian, I would have had to give up Pho Ha (yeah, right). None of the dishes are vegetarian friendly. Bummer. 
*The place is pretty grimy. I just choose to look past it. 
*If you go during peak times, expect to wait - outside. The place is small and there&#39;s no room to wait inside unless you&#39;re planning on sitting on another patron&#39;s lap.
*Bizarre hours - They don&#39;t close on the hour...instead they close 15 minutes prior. And yes, they will turn you away if you show up at 8:45pm. 

If you&#39;re looking for stellar pho, hit up Pho Ha. You will find yourself wanting to order everything off the menu. Whatever you get, you won&#39;t be disappointed.  ((Hence the reason I find myself here so often. I find the need to have it all...true junkie style.))"

Their Pho is very flavorful, as are their &#34;Bun&#34; vermicelli noodle dishes.  I particularly like the flavored pork one.  Also, the spring roll appetizers are our usual fare as it&#39;s light and contains fresh ingredients.

Bad thing: they&#39;re closed on Mondays!!!!  :("

And/or bun. I&#39;d had this place bookmarked for awhile, since it&#39;s not far away and seemed promising. 

It&#39;s a nice, no-frills Vietnamese family restaurant. I had their pho dac biet, and my SO had a bun dish with marinated beef. The plate of herbs that came with my pho included culantro, to my delight -- not every restaurant does that. Yay. I really like the way their beef for the pho is so thinly sliced. It takes on the flavor of the broth beautifully. Next time, if I don&#39;t try the pho ga (chicken pho), I&#39;ll probably stick to that beef because it&#39;s lovely. Usually, I love the beef balls -- but their thinly sliced beef is better.

Nice, clear broth with good seasoning. Beautiful fresh herbs. Perfectly cooked noodles. Yep, that&#39;s a good bowl of pho. Like. 

I have to say, my SO was probably the winner, though. His bowl of bun was delightful -- especially after he snagged my lime and squeezed its juice all over his dish. The combination of beautifully marinated and flavorful beef, noodles, cilantro, crushed peanuts, fresh herbs, and lime was fantastic. So fantastic, in fact, that I&#39;mma have to make some at home -- if I can figure out that beef marinade. 

The new pork egg rolls on the menu are good, too. This isn&#39;t a fancy place, but it is a good place. I definitely need to try their bubble tea too at some point. You know, for science."

The jukebox at The Mood is second to none (it will even give Richard&#39;s a run for it&#39;s money!) and one of the many reasons I love this dive of a bar located seemingly in the middle of nowhere! 

We stopped back in on a Saturday night to learn that our favorite Saturday night bartender, John, was retiring from the &#34;suds&#34; business that very night and they were having a going away party for him. 

Well if this isn&#39;t the friendliest bar- I don&#39;t know what is. At least three people came up to us to tell us there was food for the taking (food that the patrons had made and brought to the bar for a smorgasbord of epic proportion!) I&#39;m not sure if we just looked lost or if everyone knew everyone else but to be invited to eat THREE times made me feel like I was at a family reunion. 

The new bartender was introduced (Cinnamon in her name . . .I&#39;m sure there is a story there somewhere!) and pleasantries exchanged. 

Somethings remain unchanged, though . . peanut shells everywhere, bar darts, table top bowling and $3 beers all night. 

And bring cash . . . . for plastic hasn&#39;t made it to this &#34;neck of the woods&#34; yet!"

Wanna know if &#39;The Mood&#39; is right for you?

If you like the show &#39;Roseanne&#39; you&#39;ll love The Mood. It&#39;s everything working class Midwestern folks could ask for in a bar. 

Need a few more measures to help you decide? Well, here goes...

You might be a lover of &#39;The Mood&#39; if:

You like blue collar workers who just want to down a few brews while venting about how their boss is a c*ck s*cker and how one day they&#39;re gonna give him a piece of their mind. 

You want to enjoy unlimited peanuts and exercise your all American right to throw those salty shells on the floor.

You appreciate vintage jukeboxes with oldies but goodies a plenty... and are fully prepared to sing along should the rest of the bar break out in song.

You want a friendly and gentlemanly bartender who *could* swear like a sailor... but wouldn&#39;t dream of doing so in front of a lady.

You want an atmosphere with more character than Meryl Streep... vintage games, saloon doored bathrooms, and a few bar stools that were once old 70s and 80s home office chairs and have since been sawed off and mounted higher to measure up to the &#39;belly up at the bar&#39; standards.

If any or all of these criterion appeal to you, I&#39;ll see you next time at The Mood!"

The Mood is textbook dive bar, and only has High Life on draft (awesome). The bartender was also awesome. She was an Irish lady who was more than willing to trade good stories. I&#39;ll likely never be around here again (it&#39;s right next to the middle of nowhere), but I surely won&#39;t forget my visit.

Well, what is behind is nothing short of magical. This bar is a dive in the best sense of the word. It is casual, fun and totally laid back. 

There are all the expected elements here like cheap alcohol paid by cash only of course, peanut shells on the floor and questionable bathroom situations. That being said, this place is a blast. The very strong pro-America 9-11 posters and US Marines memorabilia are also appreciated. 

While you are here, make sure to check out the vehicle graveyard behind the building. After our most recent trip here our group made sure to ride the bus in the back, complete with our own bus themed music. It&#39;s a little creepy, but you only live once right?"

When i tried to pay with my card, and learned that it was cash only, one of the regulars at the bar said simply &#34;It&#39;s the Mood&#34;.  And i love that.  This is our place and this is what it is, nothing more.

As newcomers my date and i were quite an attraction.  And from vocal support of our jukebox selections to a visit with a dirty joke, i couldn&#39;t have been better received by the regular clientele.

As an added bonus an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation was playing behind the bar.  Certainly not a place where one would be made to feel self-conscious."

My advice is, go with a couple good friends you haven&#39;t seen in a while and relax, watch some sports on the TV, catch up and have some drinks. 

Drinks are fairly priced, but knowing the bartender won&#39;t help here-hookups are verboten by bar management. All the bartenders are slightly older women and are hilarious, outgoing, and super-efficient and quick. This service, you won&#39;t get elbowing your way up to a packed bar in a trendy club. 

This is a bar for the blue-collar, those slumming it, and those who hate the sardines-in-Ed-Hardy feel of the Chicago or Napervile bars.

I had the Hofbräu Oktoberfest &amp; Weihenstefaner Hefeweisse beers. Absolutely fresh and great!

The Apple Strudel was B-grade, and they did not have the vanilla sauce, but the vanilla ice cream was a decent replacement.

The atmosphere is very German and appropriate; the dudes wear Lederhosen and the chicks Dirndl-esque dresses. 

I waited 10 minutes after being seated before anyone approached to take my order. The establishment was nowhere near even 20% full. It is a big place.

The waiter brought a bread basket without asking; it was delicious, and I believe the pretzel buns are made in-house; they were warm and spongy soft and the Glendale Farms butter was great on the pretzel buns.

I ordered the German Spätzle (egg noodles, German style, with bits of some garnish), and the German Pretzel (a little crunchy, but tasted good) to eat.

Do not charge extra for sharing. GET RID OF THIS, ILLINOIS! Good Lord!

I may investigate a platter at a later time."

Having had German food only a few times before, I didn&#39;t have super high expectations.  Everything on my plate was delicious and exceeded my expectations.  And I think others felt the same way.  The liver dumpling soup was also better than I expected, but there were a few in our party who didn&#39;t like it.

The service was good, but I wouldn&#39;t say it was super fast.  However, we were fine with that, as we were looking to spend a long time there and enjoy ourselves.  

They had live music that really added to the atmosphere.  

We will definitely return for our next festive outing.

Ich mochte das Essen :) For those who don&#39;t speak German, this is good lol. I have been coming here for about 7 years and have always had a good experience. I&#39;m not a beer and bratwurst fan and I don&#39;t eat pork so I can&#39;t comment on that. I usually get the sauerbraten. Some people just serve roast beef and throw gravy on it, calling it sauerbraten. Not here. This sauerbraten is for real. My daughter gets the chicken schnitzel with spätzle and kartoffln with a Sprecher root beer.

The pretzel rolls are great and I enjoyed the soup. I usually get the German salad plate. I always get the sauerbraten and it is always tender. I love the gravy. The rotkraut and dumpling were delicious. I took my apple strudel home (way too full to eat it there) and enjoyed every fattening moment. I can tell that a lot of work goes into the food prep.

Our service has always been prompt. Maybe it&#39;s the time we go? This isn&#39;t McDonald&#39;s or TGI Fridays - they take time to cook your food so it takes time. And yes, there is a lot of it. And yes, German food is a bit more expensive than Olive Garden, but it&#39;s better quality. You&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re at your German grandma&#39;s house due to all of the cuckoo clocks, cute dishes, and other decor. The only real complaint I have is that parking can be a pain. Otherwise, viel spass at Schnitzelplatz!"

We arrived early on a Saturday with no reservations, and the hostess was very nervous and said she might not be able to seat us despite the restaurant being empty. Instead she chose to seat us and just said we would need to be done by 6 pm because of reservations. I thought this was strange, but it worked for us- so we did it and made sure we were gone. The food was decent, nothing really to write home about, but good. I loved the salad plate, and then had a schnitzel platter. The Bavarian Lodge near here is definitely the higher end version of a German restaurant, but this is a nice substitution for a more casual and less crowded atmosphere."

Being Austrian, I am pretty familiar with German food, and have been disappointed with some of the newer German restaurants that have opened up.  The Hofbrauhaus in Rosemont, right around the corner from my office, is rather disappointing when coming to food, and I was sorry to see one of my old favorites, Mirabell, go down the tubes after the owner passed away.  Schnitzel Platz, however, was a very nice return to the kind of restaurants I remember from years ago.
First of all, the entire facility is immaculate.  Tables, floors, reception area, washrooms are all very clean.  The kitchen appears to be enormous, and you can clearly see into it when walking toward the back of the restaurant.  Also appears immaculate.  The menu was quite extensive, both in food and drinks, and the prices did not seem to be that high.  The food was freshly prepared, and very generous in portions.  It was also extremely good.  I was ready to call the news reporters, as I was able to convince my cousin to eat rotkohl for the first time, and he ate it all!
I was just a little disappointed, as I thought they would have both the Oktoberfest and regular menus available, but only the Oktoberfest menu was offered.  After checking out the menu on the website, I was kind of hoping for a paprika schnitzel like Oma used to make.  It really was no hardship, however, as the Jaegerschnitzel I ordered was great.  Also, special comments on the leberknodelsuppe, which was quite tasty and also well prepared.  Now I have a chance to go back to try the paprika schnitzel after the Oktoberfest is over for the year.
Our server, Rocky, was very polite, even though he was obviously running himself ragged answering the phone, taking care of other customers.  He refilled ice tea without having to be asked, and was very accommodating throughout the entire meal.  
Definitely going back here again."

Inside it&#39;s more German than you will ever see in Germany, haha. But it&#39;s somehow cozy.

Sadly, my excitement was over when the food arrived. We had a Wiener Schnitzel and the beer battered cod fish. Non of them was good. The fish was obviously frozen before. It was chewy and tasteless.  The potatoesalad which came with it was ok.
My husband had the Wiener Schnitzel and that was also very disappointing. Even if the meat was tender, it had no taste at all, no seasoning, no nothing. Very sad. 

The prices are like you are getting fresh, good food. We expected way more and won&#39;t be back."

We had a reservation and were seated without issue, but that&#39;s where the good service ended. 

We all ordered a drink plus a water, as our waiter was very knowledgeable about the beer and wine options. A separate server came back with the water tray. As he was handing the waters out, he spilled half a glass of ice water on one of my friends-- stared awkwardly at her for a second and then walked away. Ummm... really??? We were all shocked at that. 

When the waiter came back with our adult beverages, we were ready to order. A few people got an app with a meal, a few just got a meal, and two of us (me included) just got the German pretzels with bier cheese dip. The couple who ordered apps and a meal got their app within 15 minutes. The person who got a soup with his meal got that about 10 minutes after that. The rest of us sat and waited for AN HOUR or more for our food. Yes, the place was busy, but seriously?! The place was emptying out at that point too. Some of us were considering another drink and dessert but the wait for food scared us into thinking we might be trapped there all night if we ordered anything else!! They lost some good business that way. 

My pretzel was &#34;holy hell&#34; salty... I scraped off a ton of the salt and had a decent pile on the edge of my plate. The bier cheese sauce had no flavor besides also salt, and probably came from a can. I wouldn&#39;t order it again. I was totally unimpressed with my experience and wouldn&#39;t hesitate to go elsewhere for German food."

One of the spots was useless (except to us on a motorcycle) as the shrubbery was overgrown.  The interior was nice looking and much of what I expected.  We were seated promptly, and greeted by a nice gentlemen server.  The bread basket that arrived was very nice, but I would have preferred the butter to be (european style) room temperature.  The side &#34;salad&#34; was not what I had expected, it was a combination of beets, red cabbage, carrots, and beans.  I was expecting some sort of lettuce and dressing, we should have asked.  The soup was very good, but some other options would have been nice.  The food was excellent, well prepared, good temperature and taste.  The place was not that busy, but the server never came back from the time we got our food.  We never got an offer of a refill, or additional glass of wine.  We had to ask another server to find out waiter, after much time sitting around with napkins on our plates.  I believe we waited approximately 20 minutes once we were done eating without our server visiting our table.  We would have gotten dessert, but the portions were very big.  The prices were a bit higher than expected, and substitutions are not allowed so you have to pay for sides you may not want.  Every side option is approximately $5."

The food is as good as it can be on a Thursday morning when we are the only guests in the restaurant.

It was a quiet (business-wise) night at Schnitzel Platz on a Friday night when we showed up for our reservation.  Our server was mostly attentive and answered our questions (when we could hear her).  Between the three of us we had very different choices.  All were good.  Only problem (food-wise) was that our entrees took 30 minutes.  That&#39;s not 30 minutes of catching up and chatting, that&#39;s 30 minutes of brain-scrambling accordion music and the chicken dance.  When the food did arrive, mine was good, but so hot I couldn&#39;t eat it.  Although I didn&#39;t try anything else I believe they enjoyed it.  

Honestly, had I not been there with my brother and sis in law who kinda made a big deal about going there I&#39;m really not sure how I would&#39;ve handled the noise.  Something makes me think there would have been napkins in my ears though.  Or maybe just a very harsh &#34;we must leave now!&#34; to my date.  

The leftovers (most of my food) that I had today for lunch was great though.  The food is good, the music is horrifyingly loud.

My husband and I had the pleasure of dining here during their Oktoberfest celebration. Friday night and the place was packed. They accept reservations and with a group of 10 of us, reservations was certainly the way to go. 

The atmosphere was quite lively, there was live music, beer games and everyone was in a friendly mood. For Oktoberfest, they set up and indoor tent and line the tables up beer hall style. You&#39;re packed in elbow to elbow in seating but it&#39;s worth it. Pretty soon strangers become friends and are offering you some samples from their meals or hot peppers someone brought in. True story. Ask Osi V or Angela P, they were there and may or may not have been part of that pepper action. 

Anyway, we ordered a lot of appetizers to share around the table--soft pretzels, potato pancakes, bratwurst and other sausages and spatzle. The menu is traditional German and everything is hearty and large portioned. Everything we ordered was delicious. I can eat a whole stack of their potato pancakes--those were definitely my fave. Crispy soft, just perfect. 

Of course tons of German beer options but they also offer a full bar.  I haven&#39;t tried a lot of German beer so I appreciated the beer sampler--5 different small pours to sample.  Lots of Das Boots (2 litre boots) of beer at our table and around the restaurant. Lively atmosphere indeed!

As mentioned earlier, it was quite packed the evening we visited. Our food order got lost in the shuffle so we waited a LONG time to finally eat more than the complimentary bread. Our waiter had no idea our food wasn&#39;t brought out to us (he was the emcee for one of the games) so he quickly amended that error. They brought out sauerkraut balls on the house and provided dessert on the house too. I think they comped a bit of our meal as well. I know errors can happen in restaurants, especially when they are busy, but it&#39;s how they react to those mistakes that is important. And Schnitzel Platz was a class act about everything. This won&#39;t deter me from visiting in the future."

This time we tried the appetizer sampler and each got a bowl of soup. The sampler was so good and had a nice variety (potato pancakes, mini burgers with sautéed onions, sauerkraut balls and stuffed mushrooms). My husband is a fan of liver dumping soup so he ordered that and I got the goulash which had a nice spice to it. 

We ordered their apple strudel to go for dessert. Delish!

It seems they have raised their prices somewhat which I understand but I think they need to rethink their pricing structure (ie $5.99 for a cup of soup is a little too high in my opinion).

Other than that it&#39;s a great place for German food!

But you might as well make the trip to Rosemont for Hofbrauhaus House for better food, service, and dining experience- because this place is just as expensive and the food wasn&#39;t that good. Parking is HORRIBLE! There are about 45 spots and you get a spot when someone pulls out if you are lucky. Do not park in the other retail lots on either side-you will be towed! Inside has not been updated since 1950&#39;s, which is interesting. Service is slow, staff is not friendly except for the bartender Leo, he was great! HAVE A RESERVATION! You will wait in a small 5 seater bar area. We ate at the bar instead of waiting, we got to listen to all the wait staff complain about the people they were serving. Two stars-beer was great, Leo the bartender was great, appeatisers  of potato pancakes were great, soup and salad also great. Main dishes are $18.99-$25.99. Very dissatisfied with main meals. Blah, tasteless. Looks awesome, no taste. We won&#39;t be back and can not recommend it. Our bill was $72 for two beers, half order appeatiser, and two main dishes. Not worth the money."

Portions are generous and service very good. Really enjoyed the music...the two gentlemen playing were interacting with the guests and keeping it fun. 

I&#39;ve been here a few times now, and each time I hear from my guests how much they enjoyed the meal and how they wished they&#39;d have come here sooner. 

It isn&#39;t the cheapest option, but it is one of the better German restaurants around."

We all ordered beers and they were wonderful. Our dinner on the other hand was a huge disappointment. It tasted like they made everything in advance and just heated it up when we ordered. The spaetzl were hard as if they were frozen before and then just tossed in some butter. $5 for a side of them and it was a very small portion. My schnitzel was good but the dumplings were odd tasting. I&#39;ve been to Okotberfest in Munich and this was a far cry from the real thing. 

We had a restaurant.com gift certificate that we purchased back in March to use. When we turned it in to our waitress she said they are not accepting them during Oktoberfest. No where on the coupon does it state that. The first manager came over and basically did nothing. He said no and left when I was in the middle of speaking to him. The the owner came over(I am assuming it was the owner). Old guy, white hair and beard. He was equally as terrible as the first guy. He was rude, loud, unwilling to budge. He said there was a sign on the front door stating we couldn&#39;t use it. It took about ten minutes of arguing and him making me feel like the cheapest ass in the world before he finally threw his hands in the air and said fine. It was the worst experience with customer service I have ever dealt with. The place was way too expensive for the quality of the food and with managers and owners who treat their FIRST TIME CUSTOMERS like that, I don&#39;t want to go back. I have another gift certificate to use and I will give it away before I go back."

The liver and dumpling soup is one of the best around. Don&#39;t be fooled by the name, they have a wide selection of traditional German foods. Their sausage selection is quite good as are the house favorites. None of this is to mean that the schnitzel isn&#39;t very good, it is, it&#39;s just that there is much more. And of course, it wouldn&#39;t be a German restaurant if it didn&#39;t have a good beer selection as well as a vast desert menu.

I was searching for German restaurants in the Chicagoland area and found Schnitzel Platz. I went there with my husband and it is a lovely place. We ordered the baked Camembert, curry wurst and a Zigeuner Schnitzel. All the food we had was delicious. The red cabbage almost tasted like my grandma is making it back home in Germany. We had a great time and great food and we definitely are coming back to eat there again. It was one of the best German Restaurants in the Chicago area I went so far."

Once again we overindulged, ordering appetizers along with a hearty entree and big beer. It&#39;s not necessarily the best German food you&#39;ll find but there aren&#39;t an abundance of them to choose from.

They live music definitely puts you in the mood for German food and beer. The place was packed at 7 but dropped off by 8, it isn&#39;t open late as one might expect when everyone is singing and dancing. We split 2 orders of the hot sausage appetizers which came with mustard and horseradish, but two of us had some of the same sausage included in our entree and ended up being a bit much. I ordered the Deutsche Haus Platte which includes a breaded pork Schnitzel, Frikadelle, 3 sausages, home fries, red cabbage, sauerkraut, and I chose their black forest ham soup. Everything was pretty decent and I was full, but of course my bro ordered up a few desserts for everyone to share. 

If you&#39;re in the area come check this place out, you can&#39;t go wrong with sausage and das boot."

When we got there we discovered it was closed at 6 PM on a Saturday night.  Which baffled us.  As we were driving to it I noticed the Schnitzel Platz.  I had never eaten there before but I tossed it out there as a suggestion, and was a short drive away.  Which she was down for trying. 

When we walked in the place was packed, but there wasn&#39;t anyone waiting in line.  The hostess asked if we had reservations, and we told her we were walk in&#39;s.  I asked if we could sit at their bar and eat and she immediately sat us there.  The place has a lot of showmanship about it in my opinion.  It seems to be decorated as a German beer hall, at least that was my impression of it.  It&#39;s a large open space with huge ceilings. There are tons of cuckoo clocks and huge beer steins decorating a shelf along the walls.  The wait staff were also carrying beers out on these long paddle things, which seemed harder than it looked.  It was a little loud but that came off more as it being a festive place where everyone was having a good time to me, and something easily overlooked.

I ordered something called Thuringer Sausage that came with sauerkraut, and warm German potato salad and my friend ordered the Veal Loaf which came with the potato salad as well.  The horseradish and mustard that came with our meal was very good and I suspect was made in-house.  We both thought our meals were very good.  The way the menu said it, I think both our meals were smaller compared to the others.  Which was good because it was so much food I barely finished mine.  With tip our meal came out to be a little over $50.  Which was certainly worth it for the meal and experience we had.

At one point while we were eating our meal, I happened to notice some of the conversations going on with the employees and later between the wait staff and some of the customers at the bar.  Which were in German.  Now I&#39;ve never been to Germany, and I&#39;ve only eaten at a handful of German restaurants but it left a good impression about our foods authenticity.  

Towards the end of our meal I was looking around and checking the place out.  I noticed two older gentlemen sitting on a bench near the front door.  They were drinking a beer and wearing lederhosen (A traditional German men&#39;s outfit).  I spent a minute or two trying to figure out why they were dressed up when I decided to just ask the bartender about them.  He said they were musicians that played there but were taking a break at the moment.  The aspect of them having live polka music really perked up my interest in the place.

Just as we were finishing up, the gentlemen came off their break and started playing.  From where we were we couldn&#39;t see what they were doing, but we could see everyone watching them and recording them with their phones.  As we were leaving we could see they had pulled 6-7 people away from their tables and one of the waiters was leading them in some sort of polka dance.  It was all quite silly but in an awesome fun g-rated sort of way.

I would definitely give the place two thumbs up.  It looks like it would be great for birthday parties or anniversaries."

Neither is German beer. Am I German? Why yes, yes I am. I represent with the blonde hair but that&#39;s about all I got. 

For those looking for a good time - this is the place to go. While the menu is not my style, at least I can come here and be entertained. I&#39;ve been twice, both in December near Christmas in the evening on the weekend. The band plays the 12 Days of Christmas and each table has a part. It&#39;s fun, loud and totally different than any other restaurant I&#39;ve been to. 

The first time I came here, I had already eaten (we had late reservations) so I ordered the Gebackener Camenbert. I had never heard of it, but saw &#34;breaded&#34; and &#34;raspberry&#34; and thought, &#34;that&#39;s gotta be good!&#34; It was. It was also HUGE. If ordering as an appetizer, easily for 4-6 people. For me as something to munch on? Too much cheese! It was delicious though - gooey, creamy, crunchy and sweet. 

The second time I visited, I KNEW to eat beforehand and was completely full. I ordered a coffee, and had planned to order a drink, however our server was less than present. 

They offer beer in boots, which is AWESOME (for those that drink it!). Every person that I go with is always more than pleased with their plates of sausage so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s great!

All being said: it&#39;s a neat place. Fun and energetic with the band. But for those non-sausage-and-fried-potato-eating fans, there&#39;s not much to offer on the menu."

I moved to the southern suburbs a few years ago and decided to take my German Club to Schnitzel Platz Saturday 4/16/16.We arrived at 2:30 with a group of 6 people. Not many people in the restaurant so it was nice and quiet, but while we were wrapping up I could see the restaurant was preparing for a busy night as a lot of tables had &#34;reserved&#34; signs on them. I am a creature of habit and ordered my usual dish - Hawaiian Schnitzel with red cabbage and German fries. I love the cheese and pineapple on the schnitzel giving it a sweet and cheesy taste.

The house salad was pretty good.  Unfortunately the main course (pork shank) was cooked unevenly.  One side was tough and chewy.  I think it probably needed an hour or so more of cook time.  It should have fell off the bone and almost melted in my mouth.  However the toughness of one side really caused me to rate them lower.  The two old guys playing music were pretty cool.

I take everyone that I know there (when I&#39;m in town), I highly recommend ordering the &#39;Prince Leopold for Two&#39;, as long as there are ywo of you and you both have large appetites and do not mind taking home leftovers.

I will base the food judgements on his comments, as I am just not a big German food fan. 

DH was in LOVE with the beer menu, he is a home brewer and loved the obscure German imports. For dinner we had the chef&#39;s choice sausage platter for a starter, and he loved them. I thought they were very good, although again, not a big fan. The he had Wiener Schnitzel with red cabbage and spaetzel and he was in LOVE. He swears the German food is as good as he has had in this area. I had a whole Rainbow trout and although a bit salty, very good and nicely presented. Someone who knew what they were doing de-boned and fileted that fish. And of course, a warm apple strudel with ice cream to put the candle in.

It is a very family friendly place, they had a couple of musicians playing all the &#34;German&#34; favorites. Although cute, a bit cheesy for my taste. But we will definitely return, if it were up to hubby, it would be tomorrow..."

The waitress was short with us when I asked why it was charged. She said &#39; It states it on the menu.&#39;  But with all the reading you do on your first visit, who notices the splitting fee. Could she have mentioned it when we ordered?  I hate to say it, but feeling overcharged will keep me from returning. The bill was over $60 (after tip) for basically one meal and two drinks.

Translation: SP is one of the best German restaurants in the Chicago metro area, and has been for decades.

Chef Wolfgang knows what he&#39;s doing, which is good, because he&#39;s been doing it for a while now.  Dude is OLD.  Gets crazy (read: fun as hell) during Oktoberfest, which in true Bavarian fashion is in the month of September, not October.  Bob and Hank are the 2-man band that have been there every single time I&#39;ve visited and are supremely entertaining.  Order a 1-liter stein of Weißbier, or if you&#39;re not driving home, get DAS BOOT (a magnificent 2-liter glass boot filled with your choice of brew).

Food selection is varied and almost always delicious.  The meat &amp; cheese platter is served on a section of a tree trunk!  Potato pancakes are excellent.  Nearly a dozen cakes to pick from for dessert, if you have room, which you likely won&#39;t......so get an Apfelstrudel to take home!  You&#39;ll be glad you did.

Oh, and the schnitzel?  Best I&#39;ve had outside of Austria (yes, I&#39;ve actually been, and Schnitzel Platz&#39;s really IS that good).  This place is a landmark, a Bavarian institution for Chicagoans, and Schnitzel Platz gets my top marks.

Wrong! They have some delicious food too, it&#39;s not always about the beer. I mean beer is good, but it&#39;s even better with the right food!

I&#39;m not an expert on German food, but Schnitzel Platz is. Their menu is huge (http://www.yelp.com/menu/schnitzel-platz-glendale-heights), there is something for everyone. Upon entering we were greeted and sat immediately even though our party wasn&#39;t complete (we also had reservations on a Friday night). There was live entertainment which was fantastic! They did the chicken dance in German and sang many catchy tunes.

I started with the liver dumpling soup/Leberknodel Supper http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/schnitzel-platz-glendale-heights?select=nn1bIHbtpwE8KLMrIh6mdA#_UQ8_Te1NMJmd_dgBpDEsQ, which was a bit bland, but still good. My boyfriend tried their Russian Ham soup http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/schnitzel-platz-glendale-heights?select=nn1bIHbtpwE8KLMrIh6mdA#WwSan-EVkG0G1bF9D14spA, a special of the night, and it was full of flavor, yum. 
We opted to split the German Platter/Deutsche Haus Platte (pan fried breaded pork schnitzel, frikadelle (german chopped steak), assorted sausages, home fries, red cabbage, and sauerkraut) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/schnitzel-platz-glendale-heights?select=nn1bIHbtpwE8KLMrIh6mdA#o5-No0wrrTPxJ1tv2f8dkw, which I really enjoyed because I got to try a bit of everything. My favorite of the platter is the schnitzel and the darker red sausage (not sure what it&#39;s called). The frikadelle lacked flavor, but I love to eat the red cabbage or sauerkraut with it, which made it gave it some taste. I also split a side of German potato pancakes/Kartoffel Pfann Kuchen (home made potato pancakes with applesauce or sour cream) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/schnitzel-platz-glendale-heights?select=nn1bIHbtpwE8KLMrIh6mdA#w5ebM-EnmZ-A3fP1dIFGow, and this is a MUST try/eat/consumer/devour. This was my favorite part of the entire meal! Layer some sour cream and apple sauce on it and you&#39;re in heaven. I&#39;m drooling just thinking about these potato pancakes. Delicious!!!

Our service was fantastic! Jan was tentative and friendly, he also recommended the Russian ham soup! 

Can&#39;t wait to go back for some potato pancakes!

The bread and rolls that came before the meal were dry and tough and the butter that came with it was ice cold, so good luck spreading that. My husband did like his soup, that was about it. The lighting was insanely bright, unusual ambience for dinner crowd. We were overcharged for our beer, but once pointed out the waitress fixed the mistake. One positive, I thought the live music was nice and a little quirky. However, the family sitting next to us kept standing up and dancing with their kids practically right on top of our table. I know this isn&#39;t the restaurant&#39;s fault, but I guess these people never heard of personal space. I think this place may be more suited towards a family crowd with no taste buds.

Rubbery canned mushrooms on the Hunters and watered downed gravy on the Weiner.

Beers: Had the beer sampler which had a 5, 7oz sample of all their beers. They were OK, but might have been a bit better if the beers were cold.

If you&#39;ve never eaten in a German restaurant in Chicago, the first time you do, you will be astonished by the size of your bill. It&#39;s just not inexpensive cuisine (and never was).

However, if you&#39;ve not had German food in Germany, you will be very impressed. 

I enjoyed my meal. This was the better of my German-American dining experiences in Chicago. 

I had the broiled trout and it was done just right. (I&#39;m allergic to pork, and what with the veal boycott in the area, that&#39;s pretty much all you&#39;ll get these days in the Chicago Metro area.) The spetzele was good as well.   I thought the liver-dumpling soup was extremely good. No complaints on the red cabbage, either.

The beer is always good. The waiter was very cordial and (for a German place) very good at taking care of the table.

I totally recommend the pistachio cheesecake too!

As to the decor....well, since my family is from Bohemia going back few generations , it feels like home to me. However, it is NOT stylish. If you&#39;ve got family from that part of the world, you know how it is....TONS of knick-knacks over every square surface, a beer stein collection, several cukoo clocks, a few outrageously Rococo wooden grandfather clocks and of course, stuffed fish or animal heads hanging on the wall. I like it, but the style police would drop dead of shock if they ever made it in the door.

Oh yeah, this is the ONLY German restaurant I have ever seen that will do separate checks for the same table."

One person at our table ordered diet coke and another ordered regular coke. Each time the waitress brought refills she stuck her nose in the glasses to be able to tell which was which! It was really gross. (Maybe put  a straw in one next time to know the difference?!) Then the waitress took 2 dirty glasses for refills (of the same drink) and when she came back to the table said sorry ladies I&#39;m going to be honest with you but I dont know who&#39;s glass is whos.

Angie P made reservations for a Saturday night at 7:45 pm. As always, I rolled up late but we didn&#39;t even need a reservation, there was PLENTY of seating. We got a cozy booth and got down to business. 

We all got some delicious German beer. Ange and her hubby ordered Das Boot (2 liters of booze) Yea. The beer was good but strong, I&#39;m not complaining though. 

For appetizers we ordered the Heisse Wurstplatte (Chef&#39;s assorted sausages) and the potato pancakes. That my friends, would have been enough to feed the four of us. But no, like Ange P said, we split 2 meals, the veal and pork Schnitzel. Both were the Schnit =p The plates were huge and came with hefty sides. One of them being these delicious little noodles that left me wanting more. I also ordered the Frankfurters which was pretty unnecessary. 

Afterwards, our waiter came with a huge selection of cakes. We had to say no, we were too full. They looked amazing though.

I ordered the Jäger Schnitzel and potato pancakes which is breaded pork schnitzel on bread covered in a mushroom and bacon wine sauce. As it turned out there was precious little schnitzel and a LOT of mushrooms. Also, I don&#39;t know if the mushrooms were fresh or canned, but they sure looked and tasted canned. The bacon, assuming it was there, was lost in the morass of gravy and mushrooms. Needless to say, the whole meal came off looking and tasting like something I could have gotten at Denny&#39;s.

The potato pancakes were serviceable, but my wife, who is a potato pancake aficionado declared them &#34;hard, greasy and nearly tasteless.&#34; So there you go.

If not that it was a little bit on the sour side.  I appreciated that warning.  I do enjoy all types a food and this dish was fantastic.  I would definately order it again.  My dad ordered a type of sampler dish and I could not believe the amount of food.  My mom ordered the potato pancakes.  I was able to have a little bit of a taste and they were quite tasty!

The food was very good indeed. I had duck, which was prepared to perfection. Christopher had the rouladen special which he said was very good. I was a tad disappointed in the liver dumpling soup, because the dumpling tasted more like a regular old meatball, and the broth was very greasy. Christopher had the barley soup and proclaimed it very very good. 

We all shared the &#34;Russian eggs&#34; appetizer. It was several hard boiled eggs drizzled in a tasty white sauce served over a bed of strips of ham or something similar and then topped with strips of smoked salmon and anchovies. It was really yummy. If I go back, I will have that as my meal, even though it is an appetizer. 

Mom and my brother had the frikadeller special. It was good and the portion was huge. They have a large assortment of cakes and tortes for dessert, along with the requisite apple strudel. 

As much as I enjoyed the food, the German music, being played by a band, was way to loud. We could not converse at all. One literally had to yell across the table, which was not fun. The service was good, but they need to hire more waitstaff, as those poor people were being run ragged. 

Next time I will go on a weeknight. As much as I enjoyed the food, the music and hustle n&#39; bustle was too much for me. I felt like shouting &#34;serenity now!!!&#34; as the waitstaff literally ran past the tables."

It&#39;s our family&#39;s favorite place to celebrate special occasions and to bring out of town guests. We have tried a few other German restaurants and this place is the best!

Everything is absolutely delicious! We&#39;ve tried a number of items and our favorites are the Jaeger/Hunter Schnitzel (pork schnitzel with a yummy mushroom sauce) and the sausage sampler plate. Meals come with either a cup of the soup of the day or the German salad plate (a variety of cold German salads). And there is a nice big basket of pretzels rolls, rye bread and crackers brought to the table. The servings are very large and we always bring leftovers home. You can share a meal for a small fee. And they might seem pricey but they are in line with pricing at other German places and you do get ALOT of food. 

Now I&#39;m not a beer fan but my husband and father-in-law do enjoy their large beer selection. You can even have a litre of beer in a glass boot! They also have a number of wines and after dinner cordials which are quite good. 

And don&#39;t forget dessert! I believe the dessert menu might be smaller during Oktoberfest but normally they have a huge selection of tempting cakes and strudels. Your server might go over the tray of them pretty fast but don&#39;t worry, they are happy to repeat or answer any of your questions.

A few notes about their hours- they are closed on Tuesdays. They also are closed for a few weeks in Autumn each year to return to Germany (the owners and some of the staff are from there) so be sure to check. If you go during Oktoberfest(Sept-Oct) the center of the restaurant has rows of picnic tables with table cloths lined up to accommodate the crowds. They do have booths along the outer walls of the resturaunt though. And if you come on a Fri, Sat or Sun make reservations. They are typically packed on these nights year round.  

And I would be remiss if I didn&#39;t mention the two-man German band who entertains on the weekends. They are fabulous and will have the whole crowd singing along. Everyone has a little German in them at Schnitzel Platz!"

I got the schnitzel with Bavarian ham on top and husband had the chicken schnitzel sandwich.  Mine came with soup (liver dumpling) and spaetzle and he went with the oven fried potatoes.

The only reason I didn&#39;t give it five stars is that sometimes their quality control slips a little (like stale rolls).  Other than that, I like coming here.

The food is about as authentically German as you can get.  I&#39;ve tried several dishes and generally really enjoy what I&#39;m served.  I&#39;m a big fan of schnitzels and spätzle.

On the weekend they have a couple of fun old-timers playing live music and the beer and wine lists offer lots of authentic German choices as well.

If the service was just slow and relaxed like in Europe but with it, then I can say it is at least being &#34;authentic.&#34;  BUT, the wait staff is pathetic.  First, none of them speak any German nor have any cultural awareness of the German culture.  So asking any info about anything, food, beers, etc. is a waste of time.  You get that &#34;stupid look smile&#34; regardless what you say or ask.  Meaning, they really don&#39;t know what you said nor care.  Food is inconsistent.  Stale breads, either bland or too sharp kraut, so-so sausages, etc.  Very expensive for what it is.  For 3 of us it was near $100, 2 of the 3 had no alcohol, the other just one 12 oz. beer.  And one of us didn&#39;t even have a complete dinner, just a la carte appetizer and side.  It&#39;s just not worth repeating.  I gave them this return visit but no more.

Located just a little ways West of I-355 it&#39;s unique decor makes it immediately noticeable from North avenue. This distinctly German aesthetic is apparent in both inside and outside of the building.

Upon walking in you immediately notice old Cuckoo Clocks, German Signage and creepy looking dolls on the Walls and shelves. An Oom-pah band strangely plays a lot of American folk music (in German) and Rogers and Hammerstein covers.  

Once seated you&#39;re given both a regular menu along with a wine menu. As a German restaurant they not surprisingly have a large selection of beer, sometimes in comically sized and shaped glass containers such as a Paul Bunyon sized mug or a glass boot.

Their menu features a variety of German dishes and they also have a separate dessert cart. Schnitzel Platz also has a gift store where beer mugs and other items found around the restaurant can be purchased. 

 I sampled a fair number of appetizers and had a bratwurst entree, most of the food I was was very good, even if it wasn&#39;t exactly up my alley. If I based my review only on the quality of the food and not the price or service this would have been a four or five star review.

However, where Schnitzel Platz really falls flat is the service, it appears on a weekend evening they only had two waiters, refills on drinks were slow and nearly 45 minutes passed repeatedly between visits from the waiter. While the food was available quickly they seemed dreadfully understaffed. What should have been a 90 minute at most visit to order, eat and pay took nearly double that. The service here is terribly slow, based on this I am unlikely to visit again, even though the food itself was excellent."

The shrimp fried rice was pretty good,I asked her to make it extra spicy but it wasn&#39;t that spicy. The crab rangoons and vegetable rolls were not the best i had. It doesn&#39;t look like their vegetable rolls are fresh, because I saw a huge tray with about 50 of them just sitting there , and ours didn&#39;t taste too fresh either. The food tastes fine the next day, however i wouldn&#39;t keep it longer than that. Nothing against Golden Gate, this rule applies to all Chinese fried rice meals. 

This is not a dine in place, strictly take out. It really looks like carry out place you expect to see in Chicago."

As others have noted, Golden Gate is strictly take-out and delivery. They have a small waiting area with a few chairs, but no place to dine-in. 

I know of three Chinese take-out restaurants along the 1/2 mile stretch of Bolingbrook Drive (Route 53). We have found the food at Golden Gate to be the best amongst them. The food itself if slightly above average, but what is impressive is the LARGE serving portions. You get a lot of food for a reasonable price. 

We ordered the Sweet &amp; Sour Chicken; General Tso&#39;s Chicken; and vegetable egg rolls. The Sweet &amp; Sour Chicken was good, but had a minimal amount of green pepper and pineapple. We prefer more vegetables in the stir-fry. The General Tso&#39;s Chicken, which is marked &#34;spicy&#34;, was not at all spicy, just mostly sweet. Just those two entrees alone was enough for a large dinner, and leftovers the next day (lunch and dinner). Lots of food!

I have to say, the customer service on the phone and in-person was great. The internet mistakenly notes the closing time as 10pm, but it is actually 9:30pm. As we all know, restaurants close their kitchens 30 to 60 minutes before store closing time. I called in my order at 9:05pm, telling them I would pick it up at 9:20pm. They were so nice to make our food, and kindly reminded me that they close at 9:30pm.  

When I arrive at 9:20pm (10 minutes before closing), both the man and woman behind the counter were so pleasant and cheerful. 

I would definitely go back to try some of their other menu items."

The shrimp with lobster sauce does not seem to last very long refrigerated, you wind up with this goopy mess the day afterward that just doesn&#39;t look very appetizing, even after reheating. I&#39;m sure the beef with broccoli and other dishes not so dependent upon a sauce do not share this fate, but it was off putting nonetheless. 

That being said, the food is good, and plentiful, especially for the price. By all means come to this place for lunch or dinner but don&#39;t buy any more than you are willing to eat then and there, I would go somewhere else if you&#39;re thinking you&#39;ll eat the leftovers."

Their Customer Service sucks! I had place a order for delivery and it literally took them 2 hours to deliver my order!  I only live 10 MINUTES from the place. The man who took my order said it would be 40 minutes. After 2 hours of waiting and 5 calls to them, I finally received my food, which I declined. Every time I called to check on the order they seem like they didn&#39;t care and wasn&#39;t really trying to deal with the issue. The food isn&#39;t all that great to be dealing with such poor customer service.  I&#39;ll go and spend my hard working money some where else that&#39;s worthy of it."

For the price you are getting TONS of food, almost everytime we have food for like 2 days!! I&#39;ve has the egg foo young, orange chicken, and chicken cashew, all very good.  Most def great place to have fast chines food on the go.  One thing i will note is the place is so tiny and not quite appealing when you walk in.  Most importantly it looks very clean in the kitchen area!"

Overall Taste: Everything is made to order and you can watch them do it as well as they have nothing to hide. You can taste the effort. Joking aside, they give you a serving for two people in a single lunch special and a mediocre eggroll, but comes with a can of Pepsi. The taste is similar to most Chinese American food, but instead of heating their food using a heating lamp and waiting for the masses, they cook it as they hear it so the food (even the fried rice) is fresh and steaming hot.

Ambiance: Nothing but an ordering window and maybe 6 chairs against a folding table and a menu on the wall for lunch. They remember people and their orders. Don&#39;t be alarmed at all the chaos going on in the kitchen, they know what they&#39;re doing, but yelling it in Chinese.

Price: Competitive enough and good bang for buck which is why I gave 4 stars. Need to feed a family of 4? Order before 3pm pick up later and feed them 2 lunch specials for just over $11.

Assessment: True hole in the wall and diamond in the rough."

Their gravy isn&#39;t salty and mixes great with their fried rice (also very good)  I have a big appetite and the General Tso&#39;s lunch special filled me up.   It had just the right amount of heat.  I can&#39;t believe I have been passing this place for over a decade without having gone in and checked it out during my food scouting missions.  The temptation is to get an order and eat it fresh to see how much better it might be.  I really want to try their Singapore Rice Noodles on my next trip....and there will definitely be a next trip.

I have never been as satisfied with any chinese restaurant as much as I am with Golden Gate. I lovvvve BBQ pork fried rice. Veggie eggrolls are pretty damn good. Not the best eggroll Ive had but very good. I enjoy the Moo Goo Gai Pan. I often order Lo Mein noodles with varieties of meat or veggie to choose from. I have been loyal to them for about 8 or 9 years now. I have lived in Bolingbrook for 24 years and this is still my favorite Chinese in OR out of Bolingbrook.  Sometimes the woman on the phones seems to be short with you but dont be offended. They are simply prompt and efficient and well...get used to it because its worth it. I think one of the delivery guys , named Jack, may be the cook and owner. He does everything. Jack always remembers me by name , and most importantly he brings me piping hot beautiful BBQ pork fried rice. I promise I have never had a single bad order or poor quality food. ALWAYS FRESH!"

They are however flexible if you have any special dietary requests(i.e. no shrimp or MSG).

I got the burger which was not cooked well but it was still decent. The mac and cheese lacked excitement. The spinach was very good. They had no coke. They also had the manager? Run across the restaurant yelling &#34;the machine doesn&#39;t work&#34; followed by a waiter walking the opposite direction whispering &#34;and your not supposed to be yelling the machine doesn&#39;t work.&#34;

I hadn&#39;t been going out much lately because of the Cub playoff games and have been thirsting for a great meal and experience. This wasn&#39;t it. It was just ok. And just ok is a failure. 

It also has a weird set up to the tables. I just remembered. It&#39;s connected to a hallway that leads to a hotel so maybe my expectations should have been lowered. But I would never bring anyone I liked there."

Glen Prairie uses fresh,  organic ingredients sourced locally to create it&#39;s offerings so the menu is changing regularly.  When a friend suggested we go here for brunch, I said sure as I had heard many things about it but had never had the opportunity to check it out.

The interior is lovely.  Dark woods, with a modern feeling but I wondered where all the people were?  We had a choice of tables and chose to go on the bar side.  Our server, Kathleen, clearly knew my dining companion as she was super helpful and solicitous throughout our entire meal.

I ordered my standard omlette and it was great!  I was able to substitute fruit for the potatoes and that was nice as well (a big plate of fruit not just a fruit cup)

My coffee cup was always full, the food came out quickly, and the bill for the two of us was only $16.  A steal for the quality and quantity of food.

So the next time you find yourself heading down Roosevelt Road, squint to remove the Crowne Plaza from your view and pretend Glen Prairie is there on it&#39;s own.  Cuz it deserves it&#39;s own stand along shout out!"

The service seems inconsistent. On the weeknight it was busy and our waitress was either overloaded with tables or just downright inattentive. When you go an entire meal with no soft drink refill and no return visit to see how the food was, it can leave you questioning overall service. For the weekend lunch visit our waiter was fantastic. While he had a few tables to serve and preparations for dinner, Robert was on his game with automatic soft drink refills, hot water for tea, or just attentive to how full glasses of water were. Along with that came a nice dose of local friendliness.

The food all seemed well thought out and for the most part enjoyed everything. Our baked goat cheese appetizer with butter crustinis was too light on goat cheese for each person to get a quality taste. The buttermilk fried calamari was lightly crisp and flavorful and we enjoyed every bite. Multiple people had the split pea soup and said it was great. The caramelized onion soup was full of croutons and rich onions and with the baked Gruyere on top just a bit burnt, it was still a quality choice. The homemade meatloaf with bacon was delicious and the venison medallions with blueberry sauce and Brussel sprouts was a fine treat. The highly recommended macaroni and cheese seemed less-rich than expected and the cracker crumble on top simply overpowering to the milder cheesiness underneath. On one order of macaroni and cheese we added the pulled pork option on top and that became an entirely new and exciting dish. 

Prices here seemed reasonable for a well thought out menu and being a &#34;hotel restaurant&#34;. While some other local options may be less expensive, the modern clean decor with some uniquely thought out dishes makes it worth at least one try. 

The rest rooms are far away close to the hotel lobby, and for elderly people with a cane can just be too far. 

Cleanliness of the plates, flatware, glasses, and of the overall facility all seemed top notch."

We were put at a high top table for eight. I finally figured out that it was because our kids are old enough to sit in tall chairs.  Most of the other tables had small children.  Certainly was less formal! It would have been nice to have been told ahead of time or asked if that was okay. We likely would have said &#39;no problem&#39;, but being forced there was a little odd. Nothing like taking Mom out for brunch and being placed at the only table without a table cloth (and four empty seats).

The buffet was as expected and we had no issues. Nothing extraordinary but I&#39;d have to say the desserts were marginal. That is often the case at MDay brunch IMHO. The service was good and the price was appropriate. 

I doubt I&#39;d go back for the brunch but we do on occasion dine there and always have a good meal."

There is a full bar with a reasonable wine selection. I&#39;ll check that out later. The Cobb Salad was good, no surprises there. The staff was on the spot and courteous even though the restaurant was quite busy. 

Dinner: came in at about 8:00pm. The place was reasonably busy but there were two servers and a bartender working. I sat at the bar to have a drink and wait for my buddy to show up. It took the bartender about 10 minutes to get to me, she was at the other end of the bar messing with the TV and talking to other customers. I find this mildly annoying especially when I ordered my drink, Saphire &amp; Tonic with a lime and it came in a warm glass therefore melting the ice and watering down my drink that was missing the lime. Once my coworker arrived we decided a table to be better, the server who attended to us at lunch had an open table and she is awesome. I had the Ribeye medium rare and he had the grilled salmon. Both were excellent and the following drinks came served as ordered. Overall good experience except for the bartender but completely forgivable. 

I would recommend this place to anyone staying at the hotel or even close by. My compliments to the Chef!"

If you need a gluten free diet, this is the place for you.  They bring fresh GF bread to start you off, and the food selection is unbelievable.  I had GF Fish and Chips (for the first time in 15 years!) and everyone thought it was wonderful.  Even their dessert menu is extensive for GF diners - they have a GF chocolate chip cookie, brownie, creme brulee... 

I only wish it was a little closer!"

We had wonderful service both times for brunch and dinner. Our servers were very friendly and attentive and made us feel very comfortable. 

I would say our dinner was more enjoyable than brunch, but it was still great. For dinner I had the Turkey burger and my girlfriend had the bruseels sprouts salad. Both were awesome! We also had the firecracker shrimp as a starter and that was my favorite part for sure. 

In the morning I had the goat cheese benedict which was tasty, but a bit rich for me. My gal had the Mediterranean omelet, but it lacked some flavor. We split the blackberry french toast and that was amazing!

I would go back for dinner any time!"

The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous!  On the exterior, you&#39;re looking at a slightly dated and shabby Crowne Plaza hotel.  Inside, it&#39;s a chic, sophisticated dream.  It was a Friday night, and we had our choice of tables, so it&#39;s okay to go without a reservation.

We were served some bread and the best butter I&#39;ve ever eaten.  I think I consumed almost the entire bread basket by myself.  As I become more and more full, insisting I couldn&#39;t finish my entree - I still made room for one last slice of bread.

We shared a spinach salad with almonds, strawberries, and blueberries.  Call me a sucker, but all of the ingredients truly did have a more robust, clean flavor.  Glen Prairie serves locally sourced and organic foods.

The macaroni &amp; cheese with the shredded BBQ pork on top is one of the best things I&#39;ve ever eaten in any city, restaurant, you name it.  This stuff is legendary.  The macaroni was both creamy and still had tons of stringy cheese, topped with crushed crackers and that pork.  It is a very filling and savory dish, and worth every cent!  I&#39;d eat this every day if I could.

Our waitress was very friendly and a little quirky, trying to joke around with us and be a little more interactive than most servers usually are.

The highlight of the night was the drunk couple canoodling just a few seats down.  A man in his 60s, who probably reeked of cologne and scotch, was desperately clinging to a woman in her 20s - and she was loving every minute of it.  It might have been the real life incarnation of Ron Burgundy.  He bragged about his &#34;$80 a shot&#34; liquor, tried to woo her with talk of relationships and diamonds, then I heard something like, &#34;we had a deal!&#34;  I tried to eavesdrop, but the acoustics at Glen Prairie DO allow for semi-private conversations.

The woman drank one glass of wine after another while this paunch gentleman slowly moved closer, caressed her hair and neck and...whoa, this is starting to sound like a smut novel, isn&#39;t it?  While this might make one uncomfortable, I was highly amused and felt I got a GREAT deal on dinner and a show.  Lucky for us, we had that chatty waitress who was able to answer all of my questions including, &#34;when did this start?&#34; and &#34;do you all have a pool going?&#34;

Keep in mind, this restaurant is connected to a hotel, so there&#39;s a very high chance that he later caressed a lot more than her hair."

We went with friends who love this place and it is their go to. Mainly because they both follow a GF diet and of course their top shelf bar helped too! Great service and even on a busy Saturday evening you can have a conversation at the table which is a huge plus.  The waiter was excellent and also recognized our friends, so he knew to bring two bread baskets after asking if we wanted the GF bread they serve.  On advice of our friends, we ordered the fried calamari done GF which was excellent.  I had the short ribs with the mashed sweet potatoes and excellent brussel sprouts.  Fish n chips was the special so my partner had that which was also tasty. I am not sure if they did a GF version though.  

I am not a picky eater so unless I go in with a specific in mind, I always ask the server what is good.  He was very knowledgeable about the beer, wine, and whole menu and delivered what was promised.  The biggest expense was the drinks since we ordered our mixed cocktails with Jack or with Patron but had a nice pour with a price tag to match.  But the company joining us was excellent, the wine and drinks were exactly what we paid for as well as the service. Yes, you might spend a bit more for drinks and meal but great experience over all and I am looking forward to my return visit sooner than later."

There was a hostess when we walked in and we were the only 3rd table.  The bartender/waitress greater us right away and was friendly.  The menu had a lot of great items.  

I had the special steak tacos (ordered Medium Rare) and my mom ordered the Chicken avocado sandwich.  The look took longer than I expected but when the food arrived was told for the tacos normally the make all the meat at noon and cooked all one way (which was NOT listed on menu).  Was told my steak was medium rare but they were not....more like well done.  Told the server right away and said we did not have time to wait for something else and she took the meal off the bill and I didn&#39;t even have to ask.

The chicken avocado sandwich was AWESOME!!!

The restaurant was very cold...seemed like air was on and they did adjust temp for us.

Will give this place another try.  My rating is Ailey based that management did NOT state on menu specials that steak was not made to ordered and kitchen stating my meat was Medium Rare but was Rare."

We started with the fried calamari. It was delicious. It was nice for my non-gluten free husband and I to finally be able to enjoy fried food at a restaurant together! He noticed the breading flavor was different from typical fried calamari, but was still excellent. 

It is rare that I can order mac &#39;n&#39; cheese at a restaurant, so naturally I did. I had it with the pulled pork, which was delicious. I was not able to finish the whole entree, and it reheated well the next day.

We got there around 9:40 and were asked to sit in the waiting area - no problem.  When we had been waiting for about 15 minutes and saw several groups walk in and get seated immediately, my husband went to ask if we were next on the list.  This is when things got bad.  

Not only did the hostess actively avoid eye contact and skirt around the hostess desk so that she didn&#39;t have to talk to him, when he tried to get her attention, she practically ran back into the kitchen.  We then tried to get the attention of a waiter but the exact same result.  By now the group of people waiting for tables was growing. We also noticed that there were about four tables that had been empty for quite some time that hadn&#39;t been bussed, and other patrons were actually stealing things from those tables the extra silverware or creamer for their coffee because their waiters weren&#39;t around.

We finally called the restaurant while standing at the hostess desk to hopefully track down a manager but the hostess answered the phone in the kitchen and sheepishly came up front.  We asked to see the manager as it was now 30 minutes passed our reservation.  She told us that management had just recently changed hands and that neither the manager or assistant manager were on site and that she would get the head chef to talk to us.  We didn&#39;t wait around for that and quickly made another reservation at Holy Mackerel! (The Harry Carey restaurant over by Yorktown).  

This whole experience was very disappointing as my husband and I had such a great experience when we had come here for dinner about a year ago.  The situation would have even been made better if the hostess and wait staff had actually acted mature and acknowledged the growing crowd at the door.  I also would have even been more understanding if we hadn&#39;t made a reservation - they knew we were coming, but couldn&#39;t plan accordingly."

Extremely accomodating and very polite and friendly.  Five of us all ordered a different item off the brunch menu and every item was nicely presented and tasted great.

Starters of cocktails, fresh hot bread with a herbed butter...delicious.  I recommend the pear/ginger martini. 

The pickled peppers on the calamari were fantastic.   Borsin stuffed mushrooms were a new treat that was delicious.  Sister raved about the beet salad.  The summer veggie soup was very flavorful. 

Sister had the mac and cheese with Bbq pork...talk about generous portions!  The Bbq has a bit of a mustard tinge, so might not be great if you aren&#39;t a fan. 

Short ribs were fork tender, and the sweet potato mash with roasted brussel sprouts were a great compliment.

I came here with my family last week--we wanted a menu with variety, and still a comfortable/more casual dining atmosphere. Everyone enjoyed their food, and they had a pretty good selection of drinks to go off of as well. I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to come back (I don&#39;t live close to the location), but if I&#39;m in the area I would give it another try.

But the service was...awkward? Our server never introduced himself, and started the conversation by listing the specials (normally nice to at least know their name). They weren&#39;t crowded when we were here, and no one was waiting for a table. And yet everyone in my family had their plate cleared as we finished (my brother was even given a to-go box when he still had half a burger left). This was just odd to stay the least, given we had ordered multiple drinks and planned on enjoying each other&#39;s company. I&#39;ve never experienced this at a restaurant unless there is a line out the door, which in that case it is understandable. I mentioned something to the server and got a sarcastic &#34;Well, you were finished weren&#39;t you?&#34; Not the point, sir. It&#39;s bad etiquette.

I would have given a higher rating but the service was lousy.  I know, one person can ruin an otherwise we&#39;ll run place but if I&#39;m going to pay restaurant prices, I deserve ore than fast food service.

Took 10 minutes to acknowledge I was there.  Then she took my order.  Food can put relatively quickly and was tasty....but I never saw my waitress again, except when she was on her way to other tables.  the place wasn&#39;t even half full and they had plenty of help.  

She stopped back by my table 11 minutes after I finished my food to ask if I wanted something to drink!!!!! Are you serious??  

Again, I know &#34;bad night&#34;. One person spoils it for the rest...blah blah blah.  I hate when good restaurants hire bad help.

I come back to hotel at 9:50pm and decide to give them another shot. After all, the food was good, and one night&#39;s poor service was probably an aberration.   The kitchen closed at 9:30pm.

First I ever heard of it was when my uncle who lives in Glen Ellyn suggested we go here for my mom&#39;s birthday dinner (she was in town visiting from Virginia).  It&#39;s in kind of an odd location, part of the Crowne Plaza hotel is it (?) so I never even noticed it before and I always write off restaurants that are attached to hotels for some reason.  

I love how things are largely organic and locally sourced.  It makes me feel better when I consume it, for some reason.  

So on this first visit, I got a full order of the macaroni and cheese (which, like Amelia&#39;s here in Forest Park, was MUCH better than the kind at Uncommon Ground, pft!).  Oh, the bread and butter they give you was also deeeeeelicious, especially the butter.  It&#39;s almost sweet.  

We got desserts that night too, I&#39;m thinking I had some sort of chocolate cake.

I returned a second time with my husband shortly later where I&#39;m pretty sure I ordered the same thing but I can&#39;t remember what he ordered.  We got the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer which I surprisingly really liked, even the horseradish sauce.

As luck would have it, Yelp hosted an event there in December which we attended and... the stuffed mushrooms were there!  I also tried the beet bruschetta which was really good, and likely something I never would&#39;ve ordered on my own.  

We went back for dinner I think the very next weekend.  I had the butternut squash ravioli (so good) with a side of macaroni and cheese and the husband had one of the best meals of his life - the quacked out burger.  I was disgusted by it, but he raved (and raved and raved) about it as he was eating it, as we were driving home, and for a few days after.  That&#39;s how good it apparently is.  Meat grosses me out in general, but two different kinds of meat on a burger (one being duck) is just... ew I can&#39;t do it.  But if meat doesn&#39;t gross you out, I guess you should try it.  

We ordered two appetizers, sweet corn cakes AND (of course) our stuffed mushrooms.  I hope those always stay on the menu.

I didn&#39;t order any wine, I&#39;m trying to do more of that but it&#39;s hard to justify when one glass costs more than an entire bottle of my favorite variety (and that&#39;s anywhere I eat, not just here).

I check out the menu pretty often so when it does a seasonal change, if I see something that looks good to me, we&#39;ll definitely go try it."

We had the Shrimp &amp; Grits which was overwhelmed with garlic and not in a good way.  Vampires beware, you&#39;ve been warned. The grits were gloppy and thick and had puddles of grease on top either from the cheese or the butter.  A very poor representation of Shrimp &amp; Grits.  The bruschetta was excellent the best I&#39;ve ever had.  Usually when you get bruschetta it&#39;s not seasoned well and the bread gets soggy quickly.  Not the case here the bread had great crunch and beet and arugula topping had really a mouth full of flavor.  The stuffed mushrooms were also a hit.  The cheese was creamy and the amount of garlic was just right.  The pulled pork sandwich was just okay.  It was a bit dry and could have used some additional sauce which also would have improved the flavor.

I&#39;m knocking off 1 star because of the sub par beer list which was just the typical bad beer from the big beer companies.  I wish they would support some of the great local brewers especially since they want to market themselves as a local flavor restaurant. 
It fell a little short for a fine dining experience."

Six of us went there and everyone really enjoyed their food. Among the group we had the salmon benedict, the traditional benedict, the seasonal hash (duck right now), the mediterranean omelette, the cornflake crusted french toast, and the bacon blue cheese burger. Everyone was extremely satisfied with their order. I tried a few different things in addition to my burger and I really liked them all. It was a bonus that the portion sizes were quite large, definitely a good bang for your buck! 

My burger was cooked really well and I loved the pretzel bun it was served on. You can also definitely tell how quality their ingredients are here. The blue cheese and bacon were amazing and definitely upped the level of the burger. I also really enjoyed the french fries that came with the burger, they were really well seasoned and perfectly cooked.

The ambiance of Prairie Glen is pretty sweet. As a city dweller I felt like I was definitely not in the suburbs and it had an upscale but relaxed vibe to it. 

The only drawbacks for me were that they refused to serve us alcohol before noon on Sunday. I&#39;m pretty sure the law is 11 AM on Sundays in Illinois and I do not understand why they make you wait an extra hour here. I also thought the service could have been a little bit better. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it was not bad, but it is the little things that make for truly exceptional service. I do not think you should ever have to ask for a water refill at a restaurant, especially when you are not drinking anything else with your meal. That&#39;s just me though.

Overall, I&#39;d highly recommend Prairie Glen to anyone in the area. A great atmosphere and quality, delicious food make it a great spot."

The food was selection was great.  Narrowing down my selection was a challenge but i eventually settled on the Pike and Mac &amp; Cheese &amp;I loved every bite .  It was a healthy portion much bigger than the average side you get at a restaurant.  The Pike was outstanding, cooked perfectly and it was flaky enough to fulfill my desire for something naughty but healthy.   After spending all week in downtown and over paying for average food.  Glen Prairie was like a breath of fresh air.  This little Gem in the suburbs was worth every penny.

The apple crisp is so awesome, I&#39;m spending the rest of the week on the treadmill but its worth it."

I haven&#39;t eaten there often enough to know their menu, but I think it has changed since the last time we were there. Anyway, I had to read the whole thing, and it was tough to make a decision. I landed on the Alaskan halibut with pureed peas and cress. I looked at that and thought, &#34;That is either going to be gross or outstanding.&#34; (Sometimes you just can&#39;t imagine what food will be like when you&#39;ve never imagined it together.) It was $34 and seemed pricey for fish and peas, but I decided to give it a shot. We don&#39;t eat out nearly as much as we used to, so I can afford a $34 dinner now and then. 

Well, it was outstanding. Definitely the tastiest (and probably the most unusual) dinner I&#39;ve had in a few weeks. I was very pleased with it. My husband got a chervil-crusted pike with green beans and some sort of macaroni dish in a little crock. I wasn&#39;t interested in the macaroni, but the pike and the green beans were both good. My dinner was better, though.

The food is very good, and I don&#39;t have any complaints about the service -- my one complaint about it is that it&#39;s expensive. I am certainly willing to pay for well-prepared food that I enjoy this much, but... $34 for a halibut dinner seems pricey. Usually fish dishes in area restaurants of the semi-fancy variety are in the $25-30 range."

All of this on a hand made flatbread. Oh hot damn, you will kung-fu kick your mama at first bite!

This visit was everything I was hoping for.  Service was very good. Enjoyed the grits and shrimp appetizer.  Dinner of salmon and prime rib were both cooked to perfection and wonderful.  Dessert was a delicious piece of chocolate cake shared between the wife and I.  It was a literal 180 from my prior visit and this made me very happy as I&#39;m not that harsh of a critic (life is way too short to carry a negative disposition).

We ordered a cheeseburger, cobb salad, a hummus plate, and a bottle of wine. The food arrived super quick and everything was fresh and delicious. 

First, the salad. All the ingredients were very fresh and crisp, key to any salad. The grilled chicken was seasoned well and not dried out. Avocados were perfectly ripe. The best part though - THE BACON! Yum, I&#39;m not sure what these guys use, but it was thick cut and sorta maple-y. And the perfect amount of doneness - crisp, but still chewy. 

The GF says the burger was cooked perfectly, and the fries were well seasoned

Oh, but the hummus plate. I eat a lot of hummus and it&#39;s clear these guys make their own. It was warm with a great creamy texture. The pita was awesome too. Man, I gotta get back to making hummus again - there really is nothing like homemade. 

I&#39;m deducting one star only because the wine seemed overpriced. Obviously, there&#39;s gonna be a some serious markup, but 4X the store price seems excessive. Nothing special about the selection either. 

All in all, a great meal! If we&#39;re ever in the area again, we might come back just for the hummus alone!"

I tried to book a table for 7 on Open Table, but it wouldn&#39;t let me book for that many people, so I had to call the restaurant.  Well, although its a separate entity, the restaurant is actually in the Holiday Inn in Glen Ellyn.  I wasn&#39;t sure if I was calling the hotel or the restaurant, but I finally got a human who took my reservation for 7 people on December 17th.  However, when our party of 7 showed up for dinner, they had no record of my reservation.  Fortunately, they were not busy and they were able to seat us.  Last night I got a call from the restaurant confirming my reservation for a party of 7 on the 24th.  I was like um, no..we ate there last week?  Anyway on to the experience...

Let me start by saying, very nice looking restaurant, good ambiance.  Nice bar selections and menu.  Loved my wine, loved my food (I had the black and blue burger).  The service, however was a nightmare.  I think there may have been only one server for the whole place and although they were not busy, they did have a private party in the next room and the server appeared to be working that too.  And apparently they didn&#39;t know to expect our party of seven because someone there screwed up the reservation.  When part of our group arrived we were promptly seated and got a drink.  By the time the rest of our group arrived they had to wait 30-45 minutes to get their first drink.  Not cool.  The server screwed up one of the orders and two of the checks (they were separate).  And then to add insult to injury, because we were a party of 7 they added a 20% gratuity to our bills.  Really?  If it were up to me she would have got maybe 10.

So I was underwhelmed.  I might go back though, because I liked the ambiance and the food, but if we got the same waitress I would get up and leave."

I had a mini introduction at the Wine and Food event, then a full on meet with the Yelp event so I was really looking forward to going here with my husband.  We came here for a late lunch and were so darn happy that our initial pleasure with this restaurant turned into a LOVE experience.

Our meal started out just perfect - duck taco apps for free, just another wonderful reminder of the Yelp event, we had a coupon for a free taste to begin our lunch!  I followed that with a flavorful short rib sandwich which was delicious and then they put an egg on it.  Oh yes, this was perfection!  I adored this sandwich and paired with iced tea, I was lunch happy!

For dessert we got to try the mini desserts - I love that, less calories and less money but all the taste!

This being January, it was time for a visit to the restaurant.

Thanks to the generosity of Glen Prairie, we had a coupon for a free app from the Yelp event so we treated ourselves to the Duck Tacos with pineapple salsa.  So quacking good!  I followed that with a cup of tasty mushroom soup.  I was already pretty happy when my main event arrived, a reuben plus a side of mac n cheese.  The reuben was outstanding - great quality corned beef with just the right amount of cheese and kraut on marbled rye.  

But the mac n cheese was the star of the meal.  So gooey, so creamy, so cheesy with penne pasta that was still firm and intact.  I eat Mac n Cheese everywhere, hey don&#39;t judge me, I like comfort food, and unless my Mother were to return to earth this is the best there is.  I would come here just for a side of their Mac n Cheese - decadent and delicious.  

Lunch here was not only mouthwatering but reasonably priced, well paced and expertly served by Asha.  We will be back and not just because my wife still has her free app coupon.  It&#39;s an all around top notch place for great food."

Sadly, my entree, and the service that followed, fell short. I ordered the pappardelle pasta. For the price ($15), it was a small portion and the pasta was seriously overcooked. 

Also, it was missing the goat cheese. When I mentioned it, they took it back and added some. However, the manager then made a point of explaining to me that there had already been goat cheese in the dish, but &#34;they added more for me.&#34; Come on. I was just eating it.

They were featured on Chicago&#39;s Best, and then my Yelping buddy Andres D. had been checking in here like a maniac, as well as making me drool over some of his food porn.  Well a Saturday night arrived, with three hungry bellies, and all eyes on me to decide where to go.  It was technically the first day of fall and the weather agreed.  Thoughts of Mac &amp; Cheese began to fill my head.  Glen Prairie it is!

We arrived to Glen Prairie, on Roosevelt Road and attached to the Crowne Plaza Hotel, around 8 PM on a Saturday night.  There were about 4 other tables at most, and only one or two more tables and one bar guest joined throughout our meal, which lasted about 2 hours.  I know 8 PM is not prime dinner hours, but it was Saturday night after all!  Even though the restaurant was not full by any means, somehow the way the room is built makes the sound come across loud.

Now after seeing pictures of a flat bead with smoked bacon and egg, I was looking forward to ordering one for appetizer and being the first to cut my knife into that deliciously runny yolk.  Unfortunately it wasn&#39;t on the menu.  Sad face.  Instead, we went with the Duck Tacos ($10) and the Shrimp and Grits ($10).  Out of the two, the Shrimp and Grits was the winner.  The duck tacos were a bit bland.  Three corn tortillas topped off with duck confit and a grilled pineapple salsa.  Although there was a pineapple salsa, I still found it to be a bit dry and lacking flavor.  Maybe a sauce or cream drizzle of some sort would of helped.  The Shrimp and Grits on the other hand were loaded with flavor, with help from the grits.  The aged cheddar stood out, and the small bits of bacon added an extra element.  In addition to the two appetizers, we also added on a Baby Wedge Salad ($8).  The lettuce was plentiful, but the vegetables and bacon were scarce.  There were literally TWO tiny crumbs of bacon, about the size of my pinky finger nail.  Our server also brought over a small squared shape sample of a waffle topped with duck confit.  We all tried it and commented on how dry it tasted, at which point our server came back over with three more samples, apologizing that they forgot to add the syrup.

For dinner, my friend and I both went with the Mac n Locally Farmed Cheese, with the added option of BBQ Pork ($18), and the other fine gentleman dining with us ordered the Patty Melt ($12).  The Mac n Cheese, although good, was a bit overpriced at $18 and was a very heavy dish.  Well, comfort food is what I wanted, right?  It was packed with flavor and tasted great combined with the BBQ Pork, but this is not something you can eat all the time.  We both ate about half and could barely move afterwards.  I would recommend ordering some as a side, rather than your entree.  As for the Patty Melt with fries, both were satisfactory. 

I love the idea that Glen Prairie does its best to use only local ingredients from the Midwest area.  Nothing we had makes us want to run back for seconds, but I am interested in going back to try a few more things on their menu, in addition to giving their brunch a taste."

My date was a bust but the meal was not. And unlike my dinner date, I would welcome another visit with open arms! 

Glen Prairie is nestled right next to the Crown Plaza Hotel. It&#39;s an unexpected gem in the suburbs. They use organic produce and try to incorporate as many local ingredients as possible into their dishes. We started with the tempura green beans which were served with a cilantro lime soy sauce - quite tasty. 

There is a nasty rumor that when you go on a first date, you should order something light...like a salad. I ordered the braised short ribs. You don&#39;t win friends with salad, people! The short ribs were served with cheddar polenta, caramelized brussel sprouts, a fried egg and au jus. I thought this was a solid dish. The fried egg looked a little weird sitting atop the ribs but I&#39;ll admit the yolky goodness was delish. 

We skipped dessert, mostly because my extremely socially awkward date was ready to go. Note to all you single men out there: when you are ready to end the date say something like &#34;so this was fun but I need to get going&#34; or &#34;it&#39;s getting late, time to call it a night&#34;. Do not, I repeat DO NOT just spring up outta your chair, stand there without a word while you wait for your date to say &#34;so I guess you are ready to go, huh?&#34; Just my two cents. 

A couple of things: They have mini desserts here (which I will try next time). I see more places doing this and I&#39;m a fan. Sometimes you want just a bite and not a whole dessert. They also have &#34;skinny cocktails&#34; here - also a fan. Sometimes I actually want to eat my calories vs. drinking them. Our server was lovely. She had an English accent and I felt like I was being waited on by Mary Poppins. It was great. 

GP will pleasantly surprise you, give it a go."

Since this place opened my husband and I have always considered it for a date night, for some reason we just had not made it there. So on a Tuesday night when our son was at a 3 hour practice, we thought we would check out there Tuesday $10 burger and craft beer special. If we liked it we would come back. We arrived and a party of 3 where waiting for a table. No host in sight. They had been waiting for several minutes so approached a bus boy and bartender to find a host. Host finally arrived, seated the party of 3 and then us.
We were handed several menus, specials etc... None had their Tuesday night special. Waiter came after a few minutes I asked about the special - he pointed to the 4 beers on draft we could select from. My husband didn&#39;t know what he wanted in 20 seconds so the waiter left and said he would be back in a minute. I had also asked for a water and the waiter had stated they would bring water.
15 minutes later (it took less than a minute to decide the beer) - no waiter and no water. We left.
Other observations - pretty bright, very very loud with no music. The place needs something to absorb the sound of people talking.
Also for those interested in the $10 burger deal - it&#39;s there classic burger no cheese - cheese is $1 more. Not really an issue, but they have two burgers on their menu and classic with cheese included and a blue cheese burger - both are not included. I recommend they either up the price to include their menu offerings or have a Tuesday special menu they provide with ALL the details.

There are so many other great restaurants in the area - I recommend you avoid this one."

Drinks were expensive ($11 for a well scotch on the rocks?) It also took a long while for us to get service (three wedding parties were there, the place was busy!) The music was also pretty loud, which made it hard to hear anything.

Didn&#39;t order anything off of the menu, but there were mini burgers and a nacho bar prepared for our party.

Did I mention nacho bar? It was yummy! Guacamole, warm nacho sauce, salsa, sour cream....need I say more? We did a little late night pigging out. (After pigging out at the wedding...what a carb filled day!)"
glen-prairie-glen-ellyn,Dan P.,RxlIpJtnAF1YAear8alREA,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,2,295,6PLJlaEMB71eT9mLt-KnKQ,2.0,2014-06-15,"Glen Prairie, what happened? The last few months have led to some disappointing visits. I hope this is not a sign that you are going away, but I&#39;m seeing an awful lot of parallels with some other recent reviews about service. These recent visits are disappointing because I feel like Glen Prairie could be an absolute gem in the suburbs...if they could just get their act together.

Anyway, I&#39;ll start with the good, and that&#39;s the food. I&#39;ve eaten here a dozen times, give or take, and I always order something different. My guests are the same way and we have never been let down with the food. It&#39;s fresh, well-prepared, and balanced. Quality is excellent and everything is very satisfying, especially the brunch menu. My brother has ordered from the lunch menu a few times and remarked that it was very solid too. The size of the menu is just right, in my opinion: enough choices for everyone without getting that Cheesecake Factory vibe where there&#39;s ten pages of things to pick from. I&#39;m glad that Glen Prairie has decided to focus on preparing food well rather than just offering a million choices (quality over quantity, in other words).

Sadly, the last two visits have been BIG let downs in the service department, and both times it was different servers. One recent visit had our server deliver four of the five entrees, then totally forget there was a fifth person and act confused when we flagged her down to inquire about it. The missing food wasn&#39;t anything weird, either (chicken sandwich, I think), and somehow even after we flagged the server down it still took 20+ minutes to get the food out. This server just wasn&#39;t attentive to our needs and didn&#39;t seem to understand the cadence of serving people: greet them, take a drink order, bring the drinks out, take the food order, bring the food out. The worst part of this is that the place wasn&#39;t packed with people so it&#39;s clear she was just oblivious or poorly trained on how to wait on tables.

The most recent visit was on Father&#39;s Day, and the service was again very problematic, yet the place wasn&#39;t packed. Our server seemed to do okay with the few other tables near us that he was responsible for, but again the cadence was all wrong. He took a good 10-15 minutes to take our drink order, then kept disappearing and never emerging with the drinks. We had to ask him where the drinks were, but again he vanished and then started waiting his other tables. I kid you not, we sat for 30 minutes before any drinks showed up...not even water. I was flabbergasted. The drinks did eventually show up about 2 minutes before the food came. Once the food arrived, the server was against a ghost and only came back when we had finished eating. What if there was a mistake? What if we weren&#39;t happy with something? He did apologize for the service as we got the bill, saying things were a bit crazy today, but I was really confused by this since the restaurant was (A) not even close to full and (B) he was just plain-old forgetting about us.

I will give Glen Prairie one more chance to redeem itself. I really enjoy the food, but the service is sliding downhill VERY fast. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a training gap with staff, if the kitchen is having issues, or there is something else behind the scenes, but the problems are blatantly obvious. Some other reviewers suggested understaffing, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the problem here. There were plenty of other servers working both of these problematic visits but the ones we had at our table just didn&#39;t know what they were doing."

The restaurant is attached to this rather unattractive hotel, so one might get the idea that it&#39;s just a burger type of joint....but no.  The inside is modern and clean without looking sterile.  

My companion and I both went with the heirloom tomato salad, which was absolutely to die for.  I felt like my taste buds exploded from the flavorful tomatoes, while the balsamic vinegar and olive oil were definitely &#34;top shelf&#34;.  I went with the mac and cheese with pulled pork on top for dinner.  Even if it was a heart attack on a plate, it was creamy, decadent and exactly what I was looking for in comfort food.  My companion went with the chervil crusted pike, and was equally impressed.

The only downside to this place is the price.  Even with the coupon, we spent quite a bit.  It was worth every penny though, and I&#39;m definitely looking forward to going back with the hubs on a future &#34;date night&#34;."

I started with the Baby Wedge salad drizzled with a creamy dressing with crumbled blue cheese.  It was quite a hunk of iceberg and could be comfortably shared between two people.
We both ordered the Eggplant Involtini.  We both said &#34;Wow&#34;!  Breaded and baked eggplant wrap with roasted garlic ricotta and then topped with marinara sauce and fresh mozzarella cheese.  The marinara sauce was fresh and not too sweet or acidic.  All of the ingredients tasted so fresh.  The portion was ample and we were able to take one of our &#34;wraps&#34; home.
We ordered a side of creamy polenta to share.  This was sublime!  I love polenta and you don&#39;t see many restaurants offering it.  The Glen Prairie version was truly one of the best that I have had - very buttery and smooth.
We finished our meal with two mini desserts.  I had raspberry sorbet along with a cup of Lavazza coffee and my wife loved the mini Bananas Foster.
We had 2 martinis, 2 glasses wine, one Baby Wedge salad, two Eggplant Ivoltini, one polenta side, 2 mini desserts and one coffee.  Total bill with tax = $102.  I think that is a very good value.  Our server, Kella, was excellent.
All in all, we are glad we returned.  This was a memorable meal."

They have 100% (yes, 100%) grass fed meats and they use organic produce (when possible which you can ask if something is or not).

It was  the service that made me uphappy.

3 of us went on a weekend night and I was surprised to see we were the only ones there. Maybe the bloom is off the rose?

I had called ahead to check on the menu and they told me it had changed that week and read me some of the seafood offering over the phone - which was nice. 

When we got there , I was suprised again that the daily specials on the web were not offered cause of the &#34;new menu&#34;.
 I was told this at least 3 times. Ahh, fine. then SAY THAT on your webpage.
I finally got annoyed and replied &#34;looks like the same menu to me.. burgers, flatbread, mac and cheese..you should ahve updated the web.&#34;. The waitress then spent 5 min agruing w me that it was so different and look at all the new stuff.

 I was expecting $5 flatbread! and enedd up with a $10 burger. The burger was good- thank god I didnt get the $$ beef option. But it wasn&#39;t a $10 burger I think.

I would go again, but I definitely would not put this in top rotation anymore."

The service has always been really great,  very helpful and attentive and the hostesses are the same way. The thing that really stood out to be though was how accomadating, even excited, the waiter was to help me out with my gluten intolerance, and what a great selection and effort they put into having gluten free items. Most places, they just give you a burger on a plate, or MAYBE give you some gluten free toast to sub for a bun. Not here. they had a full-fledged and delicious gluten free hamburger bun to sub. that was great. And desert? I usually just content myself with ice cream. But here, they had warm gluten-free chocolate chip cookies! wow. You just don&#39;t come across that kind of offerings very often. Acutally, ever, in my experience. And the waiter was sure to confirm when he brought it out that it was, in fact, gluten free, he had made sure in the back. that&#39;s actually really helpful, because  a lot of times you wonder if they really remembered to put it on the tab or that the kitchen help remembered to sub, whatever. so he was really really great about it. They even have a dedicated GF fryer. plus, even if you&#39;re not gluten free, they have a really delicious menu, great burgers, steaks, seafood, awesome beer and cider assortment, delicious desert, and they really use top-notch ingredients, you can just tell. And they make an effort to source locally and ethically, which I think is awesome. I really love this place, and after my most recent experience, I will be pushing my fam to go there as often as possible, you can bet!"

The first evening we went to dinner at Glen Prairie with Aunt Sue and Uncle Mike.  Glen Prairie is located in a Crown Plaza but seems to have overcome the stigma of being a restaurant in a hotel.  It appears more like some entrepreneurs leased the space independent of the hotel.  They specialize in local products which is fine.  I lied about having been there before and was spared the local / organic sermon.

We started with some good warm bread.  It was crusty, slightly sweet on the outside and was very good.  We ordered a wild mushroom flatbread but the order was confused in the kitchen and we ended up accepting a Tomato and Goat Cheese version.  It was fine.

Ms T, Sue and Mike all had salads.  Mike&#39;s spinach salad looked good.  Ms T&#39;s Farmer Salad comprised mixed greens with vinaigrette and she liked it.  Sue&#39;s Wedge Salad had Bleu Cheese dressing that I must say I would have returned.  It was unpleasantly sweet which was not what I would have expected.  I had the soup of the day, vegetable, and it was a very plain half-hearted effort, nothing remarkable.

Ms T and Mike had Chervil Crusted Pike.  Both liked this plate, served with steamed green beans and mac &#39;n cheese.  The only issue was the mac &#39;n cheese.  The mac was penne with  a little cheese on top but no cheese in the dish.  It was dry and was also served without the benefit of salt.  Aunt Sue had lamb chops with whipped potatoes and cauliflower.  The chops were a larger serving that I typically see and she took half home.  The sample I had was good, but nothing particularly creative. 

I had braised short ribs with shipped sweet potatoes and caramelized Brussels sprouts.  The ribs were OK, but were overdone.  I am having a tough time getting really good braised short ribs.  The meat was very tender but was dried out.  I really liked the sweet potatoes, but the sprouts were not caramelized or seasoned or even done.  The sprouts were a very amateur effort and good sprouts are not hard to do.  I did not eat them.

This is a weak three stars for the price.  There are some bright spots but a lot of miscues.  Worth a try then make up your own mind."

We went with a group of nine people.  It took our waitress a good 15 minutes just to get the wine that we ordered.  The restaurant wasn&#39;t even packed so I have no idea what the delay was.  It took 30 minutes just to get salads and apps out ..the only thing cooked was the asparagus... WHY would it take so long to come out??   It took them about 15 minutes after we finished our salads and apps just to clean off the table and another 25 minutes for the food to come out.  A steak that was ordered rare came out medium.  The green beans were super buttery and salty.  We had to ask our waitress repeatedly to refill my fiance&#39;s ice tea ... I mean c&#39;mon .. they couldn&#39;t even make sure drinks were refilled?  You get better service at an Outback Steakhouse compared to this place and it&#39;s three times more expensive ...  

If the restaurant was completely filled, I would have more compassion for our waitress, but for a Friday night, there were only about 25 people inside dining.  If she was the only waitress/waiter working, they need to hire more people.

It&#39;s a shame that a restaurant with great ambiance and pretty good food has such terrible service ... such a waste."

The menu was creative and interesting. There were a number of brunch entrees that interested me. The food was good although the service was consistently slow. Very friendly staff but slow as molasses!!! Our server belatedly asked if we wanted more coffee and water rather than just refilling. Pretty lame for brunch when the restaurant is empty.

I have a gluten allergy and its very difficult to eat out. Yes I can order a salad anytime I go out to eat and not worry too much about getting sick, but let me tell you...you get sick of salads. This place is amazing as I never have to worry and I can order items just like anyone else. Their entire menu (minus about 5 items) can be made gluten free!!

Ive been here for breakfast and dinner. I would recommend the following things....

French onion soup, sweet corn cakes, shrimp n grits (a new favorite of mine),  crusted pike, scallops, shortribs (these are soooo good!), mac n cheese (my husband loves, smells good but not GF), mushroom risotto, GF patty melt, Signature burger, the bacon and blue burger, creme brulee, and bananas foster.

Their staff is so professional. I wish I could remember one of the servers name, but he always recognizes us and comes over to say hi even if he isnt our server. 

We have never had the brunch, as most of the items arent GF friendly.

Oddly enough, I&#39;ve now had it two times in the last two days. They had a booth at the Food &amp; Wine Tasting that I went to yesterday. They were serving braised short ribs &amp; sweet potatoes. I HATE sweet potatoes. Maybe it&#39;s because we never had them growing up but either way, I&#39;m not a fan. I didn&#39;t want to be rude though, so I just took the plate with the intent on eating the beef and pitching the rest. I decided to try the whole plate and I&#39;m glad I did. Everything on the plate was so good. The ribs were extremely tender and I&#39;m not quite sure what the juice or sauce was, but I wanted to lick my plate. My husband gets really embarrassed but I have been known to do that once or twice when the sauce is just that good. I resisted though because there were other Yelpers there and I didn&#39;t want to be the source of a new YT conversation. The sweet potatoes were very delicious too. They weren&#39;t overly sweet and were the perfect texture to be paired with the meat.

All weekend I knew I had the food &amp; wine tasting on Saturday and a bridal shower on Sunday. I threw the invite away so I really had no idea where this thing was. I just knew it was at the Crown Plaza in Lombard. When I pull up and see Glen Prairie, I was like oh no way, what are the odds? There was salad, bread and a pasta bar served. My friend and I just assumed it was going to be appetizers and not a full meal as a lot of showers are, so I ate before I left the house--yeah..the one day I decided to cook. I didn&#39;t want to be the only one not eating though, so I did try some of the tortellini and the marinara sauce. It was extremely tasty. The marinara sauce was homemade and had chunks of tomatoes and basil in it.  I&#39;m a fan. I haven&#39;t had a ton of food from Glen Prairie but what I&#39;ve had has been amazing so far, so it gives me high hopes.

The shower was in a semi-private room near the bar area.The service was really good and our water glasses were always filled. The only thing that made me scratch my head a little was when the host of the shower said that she had to take out insurance in order to have the restaurant allow them to bring a cake in. Not really sure if it&#39;s because they are scared of someone choking on a piece of cake and the restaurant being liable, but I probably wouldn&#39;t recommend bringing a cake if you&#39;re planning a party here.


i&#39;m a big fan of Glen Prairie and can&#39;t wait to make it back soon."

The stuffed mushrooms were great to share and uniquely prepared. We both got the pike and it came with the famous Mac N Cheese. We both had enough left overs for a second meal.

Our one and only visit was today for the &#34;area&#39;s best breakfast&#34;.  If the area is limited to the hotel lobby, this might be truthful advertising.

We ordered 8 separate meals.  Every meal was uninspired, weak flavors at best, prepared to a level unacceptable even at a cheap family restaurant, and presented poorly.  [One compliment, the poached eggs on my Eggs Benedict were prepared properly].

At a price point equal to approximately 11 times the cost of ingredients, we expected much better.  

The atmosphere was typical hotel lounge/restaurant (think Ashley Furniture art deco).

Honestly, even if the food was 1/3 the cost (where the value probably was) I wouldn&#39;t return because it was a truly forgettable meal for all of us. 

I gave Glen Prairie two stars because the meal was edible even though it was lackluster.

The food was well prepared, reasonable prices and portions were generous without being ridiculous.  it was a tad pricey but well worth it in my opinion.  Lots of organic locally grown products, and the service was a tad on the slow side but really nothing terribly unusual for a busy time.  Nice wine list, and the prix fix menu had some really great options for a great price. In some cases, the price of the prix fix was only $1 more than the entree price and included salad and dessert.  Really loved the mini desserts, so I could try 2 different things and NOT feel overstuffed since they were literally about 2-3 bites each.

Place seemed to be full of regulars who knew the waitstaff by name and ordered &#34;the usual&#34; so obviously it is a local hit.  My date was a scotch drinker ands was impressed by the wide array of scotches they had in-house too, if that matters to you :)

Why on earth did I wait so long?!  The decor is really cozy inside and the service was great.  The menu had so many delicious options to choose from that it was a hard decision.  I liked that it was locally farmed and there are a lot of gluten free options for those that need it.  

We Started off with the shrimp and grits  which was a spin off some southern cuisine.  I would never have thought to put cheesy grits, large bacon pieces, and shrimp all together in one dish, but man am I glad someone thought of it.  Amazing!  I was ready to lick the plate.  Did I mention they also serve you perfectly crispy bread with a really good herbed butter.  

For the main dish I had the pork tenderloin which came with a spicy peach chutney and whipped sweet potatoes.  The portion size was great and the meat was cooked perfectly.  It was delicious.  We also tried the seared scallops.  I thought the portion on this was skimpy, but it was good.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;d get it again if I had the choice; I&#39;d rather move on to something else that looked yummy on the menu.

We finished our glutinous night with the warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream and sea salt carmel.  perfect combination of sweet and salty.  All in all I left full and eager to come back and try out more glen prairie goodness.  They change their menu seasonally so I&#39;ll be interested to see what they come up with for spring/summer."

They have many different flavors, something for everyone! My favorites are apple and creamed corn.  My husband likes the traditional and chorizo and egg. They had a corned beef filled for &#34;half way to St Patrick&#39;s Day&#34;. We also get the beef, ham and cheese, spinach and ricotta, chicken pesto...they are all fantastic. As for their sauces, we have only purchased the chimichurri. We have tried store bought chimichurri and have attempted to make our own. Nothing has come close to the great flavor of the Grumpy Gaucho&#39;s. They are a great asset to the area and I know that anyone who tried them will like them!

Saltenas they do not have but great empanadas they do. I found them at Plainfield farmers market (Lockport &amp; 59, Sat 8am-1pm).  They don&#39;t have a store but run a commercial kitchen.

Empanadas are basically stuffed pastries, and they have quite a few variety here. Cost $2, they are not large. Favorites were spinach n ricotta and traditional beef. Beef empanada I think had ground beef, olives, and potato, very good. Others in the family also liked the BBQ pork.  Chicken pesto was ok, not as flavorful as others, never been a fan of shredded chicken.

They sell sauces too, $7 frozen. The price seemed too steep, but still ended up buying the chimichurri sauce. Sucker for that stuff! Chimichurri did not live up to my expectations, it was ok, prefer it less coarse. From the samples there, the Provencel and lime cilantro jalapeño were the best. Provencel was very tangy and lime cilantro had a great kick to it.

Search still continues for Saltenas in Chicagoland!"

If you decide to sit down, you&#39;re treated to complementary chips and salsa which is always nice.

The steak Burrito is consistent, and the portions are large. Most people could probably eat half, and save the other half for another meal. The flavor itself is alright. The meat isn&#39;t seasoned that well, but there is a jalapeño sauce on the side that adds a kick to the burrito. There are refried beans, cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce inside. It&#39;s not the best meal, but it gets the job done.

The tortas are basically sandwiches with the filling of the burritos sandwiched in-between a toasted bun. It&#39;s pretty solid if you aren&#39;t looking for something as filling as their burritos. 

If you&#39;re looking for a cheap, quick meal with big portions, Taps is a good place to fulfill those late night cravings."

The boyfriend, a devoted and long-time fan of the restaurant, highly recommended ordering a burrito. I chose one of their signature burritos, the Tex-Mex steak, stuffed with grilled steak, jack cheese, bell pepper, onions, lettuce, and guacamole. We also ordered some chips and salsa to go with our lunch.

First off, I think it&#39;s awesome to note this place has a drive through! Granted, it&#39;s on the far end of a complex and you have to drive around the back of the plaza to reach the intercom, we were still thankful it&#39;s there. Boy, were we feeling lazy that day! Although we were the only cars in the drive through, our food seemed to take a long time, but this isn&#39;t a big deal as you can watch the staff prepare your order while you&#39;re waiting in your car at the window. Did I mention this was a very lazy attempt to find food?

When we received our bag of food, it was stuffed and pretty heavy. This place really takes care of you! My special burrito, which turned out to be a meal with rice and beans, was one of the largest burritos I&#39;ve ever attempted to eat! I was only able to devour half of this thing, but it was absolutely delicious. One can easily tell it&#39;s packed with very fresh ingredients that work incredibly well together. My favorite? Tasting the crunchy freshness of the green bell pepper. The steak is generous but the pieces seemed a bit dry. The salsa is also delicious here. My boyfriend made a good pick to become a regular here and if he has any say in our future dining decisions, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back time and time again!"

I decided to have lunch here with a co-worker.  I had a chile relleno and regretted it.  The cheese inside the chile wasn&#39;t just melted, it was practically liquified, which is something I&#39;ve never had before.  The sauce on top of the chile was flavorless and the color was unappetizing as well.

The horchata was good.  Glad some things don&#39;t change!

My co-worker really liked the steak tacos.

Service is friendly.  If you order to dine-in, you get complimentary chips and salsa, and an employee checked up on us to see if we needed anything.  The chips and salsa are no bueno.  The chips tasted stale, and the salsa was watery.

As night falls, the lights flicker to life, illuminating the smiling yellow canopy that sits above the door, inviting students and weary travelers alike to come spend some time. Inside, the rustic diner feel creates an atmosphere ideal for reminiscent sighs, raucous laughter, and casual conversation. Explore the vast menu while you stand in line, considering every option. Then, when you arrive at the brushed metal counter, order a steak suizo burrito. The service is friendly and familiar, keeping your table well stocked with perfectly crispy chips and homemade salsa, on the house. Pass by the drinks as you ask yourself what horchata even is. You&#39;ll be back to try it at some point, but you don&#39;t know that yet. Take a seat and watch as the squeaky seats and Spanish-only television work their magic and you lose track of time amid inside jokes and tales of days past. Snap back to reality when the server brings in your order. Ascend to a new dimension of flavor as that first bite of suizo goodness ravishes your tastebuds, then relax and float back down, enlightened, as you take your second bite and realize who you have become, who your friends are, and how blessed you are to be here and now with them. At 2 am, in the parking lot, realize that you&#39;ve just spent several hours eating at a restaurant that serves food within five minutes of taking your order.

I&#39;ve been coming here for years and just noticed that this is a chain that is blowing up right now. They just built one in Bolingbrook and you can tell that the owner went all out. They recently remodeled this location and it looks pretty nice now. The food comes out quick and if you eat for here, they bring it to your table, but they don&#39;t really wait on you. You pay for the food first, and if you want anything else, you have to get up and pay for it.

I don&#39;t know why, but I love the french fries here. I think it&#39;s because they fry corn products in their grease all day and by the time I get there the fries drink up that corn stuff and taste super fine.

For lunch, I usually ordered the taco platter which comes with two tacos, rice and beans all for under $6. Honestly, try going to other taco places for that and getting a good amount of food.

Like I said, I love the tongue tacos. The simple ingredients of cilantro, onion and tender beef tongue just all blend so well together. Add some hot sauce and you&#39;re in heaven. I know it may sound scary, but do yourself a favor and try it.

It brought back all the good memories I had in Mexico. So I visit it regularly. In my opinion, the food is better than the Chipotle acrossed street. This place is clean and has some really authentic Mexican dishes. If they use better grade beef, I will give it five stars."

I&#39;m sure glad that I did though. They serve some of the best tacos I&#39;ve had. Incredible flavor in the chicken &amp; alpastor. Their chips were crisp as the air on a Fall morning and their salsa spicy hot as the Summer sun. $2 per taco, but they load each one up w/ meat squeezed between two corn tortillas. Perfection."

We love coming here for many reasons. We are late night owls and this place is open till 2am weekdays and 3am weeknights. The place is your typical carry out, fast food eat in Mexican place. The prices are always very reasonable. Their steak tacos are a couple bucks and I usually can make two separate tacos cause they are loaded with meats and veggies and always comes with 2 tortillas.  We always enjoy their chips and salsa which comes with your order when you sit down and eat in. You can tell the salsas are made with roasted peppers cause there&#39;s that smoked aroma when I eat. We love their horchata too. Never have their food without horchata!"

I&#39;d say I spent probably $50 a month here just for myself. I always get a horchata...always. And both me and my toddler share it while waiting for my food. It&#39;s never been an issue for me to drink half or more (don&#39;t judge me) of my horchata and fill it on the way out the door with my food.

Today, however, I put 4oz in my toddler&#39;s sippy cup and got my large drink and food and left. A creepy guy ran after me (seriously...there were 2 patrons in your restaurant sir) and acted as if I&#39;d just stolen something. He was saying I filled my baby&#39;s bottle and I had to pay. Uhm...ok I ask how much. $1.77.  Really?! Ok I paid and dropped the change in their tip jar because they clearly need it more than I do. He said there are in fact free refills, and I still don&#39;t get what&#39;s the difference between me drinking 20oz out of my styrofoam cup and refilling it while waiting vs 3-4oz in a separate cup. 

Anyway...I&#39;ll be blogging and posting about this on every social media site I&#39;m involved with and letting my 3k Facebook friends know.  You&#39;d rather lose my business (along with my entire family) over 3oz of horchata...for a baby.

I can find equally tasty tacos elsewhere. Meh. I&#39;m all about service and this was utter bullshit."

Food:  Topnotch and authentic!  Tacos are large and flavorful, especially the lengua (tongue).  Tortas are delicious and HUGE; the bread&#39;s even toasted which adds a nice crunch to the sandwich.  They use authentic chihuahua, queso fresco, and Mexican crema in all of their dishes. And, they have licuados (Mexican milkshakes) which aren&#39;t available at most Mexican taquerias in the burbs.  Love the free tortilla chips and better-than-usual salsa (do I taste Mexican oregano?).  My teen son says they have the best tasting orchata (rice milk dish) around.

Waitstaff:  There&#39;s a lady who brings chips, salsa, and your orders to your table.  She also cleans up so you don&#39;t have to bus your own table. Friendly but professional.

Facilities:  Clean dining room and womens bathroom.  Pretty mural on the wall.  Mexican soap operas and soccer games are usually on the TVs.  Crazy crush during weekday lunchtimes.  Quieter at night.  Open until the wee hours."

The menu isn&#39;t huge, but they have what I want. Horcahta was good. Chorizo taco with cheese onion cilantro was tasty. Never had tacos with red onion. Steak taco with cheese onion and cilantro was also good. Seemed a little greasy but there is a little bit of gristle in the steak. Maybe that&#39;s why. The only disappointment was Telemundo was not on the TV. Soap Operas in Spanish are way better than the English soap operas. I will still come here again.

OR

I want food.  Me too, but it&#39;s 1 in the morning.
Time for some Tapatios!

OR

Wow, I&#39;m drunk!  Time for some Tapatios!

If you&#39;re looking for amazing wonderful life changing food, this place is not for you.   This place does not have life alteringly great food.  It has great food.  The key though, is that it ALWAYS has good food.  Always.  Steak taco for lunch is great.   Carnitas burrito for dinner is great.  Chorizo anything after drinking is fantastic.  (Note:  Chroizo burrito hungover the next day is NOT delicious)  Flautas, Chimichangas, their rice, their chips and salsa.  It&#39;s all great.

What really gets me is that little things.  You go at 3 am on a Friday?  You are on your own bub.  They&#39;ll drop your food off, they&#39;ll give you chips and salsa, but beyond that it&#39;s up to you.   But if you go during normal people hours, things change a bit.  They&#39;ll grab salsas for you, they&#39;ll refill your drinks, they&#39;ll grab your plates as you finish with them.

You can get your food to go, you can dine in.  Men&#39;s bathrooms are clean, the tables are usually spotless, the decor is tacky, but festive enough to not drive you away.

But let&#39;s get down to the best part.  1 drink split between two people, 1 burrito, two tacos, side of rice.  $13.42  My philosophy is if two people can eat and be full for under $20 bucks, it&#39;s a good thing.  Two people can eat here and consistently be well under $15.

Chicken and pork is good.  I love the grilled steak, it&#39;s cooked really well every single time.  I only eat Chorizo when I&#39;m coming in from the bar though.  It&#39;s delicious, but good god is it greasy, especially if you leave it overnight.  Makes a good addition to your scrambled eggs the next day though, so I can&#39;t even be THAT mad.

BURRITO PRO TIP: Getting your burrito suizo isn&#39;t the best call.  Just ask for cheese and sour cream in your burrito, that way you can still eat it easily with your hands, and not deal with the melted cheese on top.
BURRITO PRO TIP: The burrito tortilla is more fluffy and delicious than the taco tortillas.  It&#39;s better to get a burrito and eat half, then get tacos.  Whenever possible, share, split, or save a burrito for later if you can&#39;t eat it all in one go.  If you have no other options, I&#39;ll give you my phone number and be right there."

I walk in, and the first thing I notice is people busy working. No one standing around or conversing like most quick service restaurants today. 

The menu is more extensive and cheaper than competitors like Chipotle. You can also see the grill from the counter which is always a plus. 

I place my order then stand a few feet behind the register to wait. The person who appears to be the manager approaches me and kindly asks &#34;Hello sir, is your order for here or to go?&#34; I tell him it&#39;s for here and he replies &#34;Excellent, I want you to sit down, relax, and we&#39;ll bring you some chips and salsa.&#34; I pay $6 for a full meal and I&#39;m treated like freaking royalty! I&#39;m sold already.

The food arrives and it&#39;s the best burrito I&#39;ve ever had - this is coming from a person with a multi-decade career of trying different Mexican cuisine. Fresh ingredients, perfectly wrapped burrito (not the amateur Chipotle garbage), and you can tell the meat came right off the grill (again, unlike Chipotle where they batch everything). Warm, delicious, perfect. Oh, and they bring hot sauce - a nice touch. 

Bottom line: You can come here, get a $6 burrito + unlimited free chips and salsa and feel like a king, or go to Chipotle and pay $7 or $8 and have some teenager slop some pre-made ingredients together and make jokes about you while you eat. It&#39;s really a no-brainer, guys."

My standard time to show up at this place is usually sometime after 1am in some form of drunken/exhausted stupor, with friends who are also, in some form of drunken stupor. I tried the chile relleno burrito last time, and that really hits the spot when you after a long night of making your rounds around the bars. I really need to go here when the sun is up and I am sober, and try some of their house specialties. The chorizo and lengua (of course) are both great. I would watch out for the chorizo though, the oil from the meat runs and it stained my shirt. Wash that out ASAP!

THE reason I return to this place is because of the chips and salsa. They definitely serve up a wicked salsa verde that should snap you out of hindered-judgment mode into less-hindered-judgment mode."

I have been eating LBT for many years, brought out-of-town friends there, and go at least 3-4 times per month.  I always went to the Glen Elly location because it is close to home.  Lately, I&#39;ve been going to the Lisle location because it is near where I work.  

My last visit on 04/09/2013 was my last ever to the Lisle location, and maybe all of them!!!  There was a lime wedge in my burrito.  I bit into it and everything tasted like lime.  I didn&#39;t order a wedge of lime with the skin still on it in my burrito.  I had already eaten over half of the burrito, but I stopped eating it because I was wondering what else was in there.

I brought my plate to the counter and explained what happened.  The guy, David, looked a little surprised and told me he was sorry.  He explained that the limes are next to where they make the burritos, and one must have gotten in my burrito.  He then gave me this look and acted like I was the one with the problem.  

I was really disappointed with the lack of an attempt to rectify the situation.  I wasn&#39;t looking for royal treatment, just offer to do something for me other than apologizing and turning it back on the customer!   There was no offer for a refund or to make me another burrito or other item of my choice.  It was left as &#39;stuff happens and we don&#39;t really care&#39;.  I put my plate of unfinished burrito and gnawed up lime wedge on the counter, looked him in the eye and told him I was &#34;never coming back again.&#34;  I walked out and haven&#39;t returned since.

By the way, I&#39;ve had a virus for the last 6 days and my throat started getting scratchy the night of this experience.  I&#39;m not saying they gave me the virus, but I did get it soon after eating the lime-rrito.  Maybe the grill guy was sick and carelessly let other stuff get in my food?  

It&#39;s too bad because I like the reasonable prices, fresh salsas and variety of meals and a la cart choices.  I will be going to Glen Ellyn from now on.  They know me as a regular and treat me well.  Glen Ellyn also has 3 kinds of salsa instead of only 2!   I&#39;ve never found a lime, or anything else not edible for that matter, where it doesn&#39;t belong at Glen Ellyn.   I will not be returning to the Lisle Los Burritos Tapatios because they don&#39;t know how to treat their customers if they make a mistake with customer orders."

BAD. This is almost as bad as Taco Bell. The food tastes like it was over cooked and it was dry. The chicken or steak burrito meat tastes like jerky. Nothing in this place tastes good.

My favorite menu items are the guacamole and the nachos, but they have awesome veggie burritos as well. Very reasonably priced and friendly service.

At 4:30 I could stand the hunger pains no longer.  I picked up my boy child and pulled into the nearby taco/burrito joint.  I had the most delicous, mouth-watering huevos con chorizo burrito...sinful, really, with rice, beans, lettuce and a lil cheese.  Boy child gobbled a teeny chicken taco.  It was a quiet meal.

It&#39;s popular with Hispanic and non-Hispanic people, and they cater to both the good old &#34;big burrito&#34; crowd, as well as folks after something akin to street cart food. The menu includes the usual tacos, burritos, tortas (and they offer unusual fillings like tongue, cecina, etc.), as well as soups like menudo and caldo de camarón.

You can order in or carryout, and orders can be phoned in ahead. Those dining in will order at the counter and have their food brought to their table when ready. There are a couple of picnic tables just off the parking lot for rustic outdoor dining, if you like watching traffic on Ogden.

Good, fresh ingredients, nicely prepared and offered at a decent value."

This is s small sit-n-go type restaurant.  Every meal order comes with complimentary chips and salsa, and a lady brings your soda out to you if you order one.

The food here is always good and pretty authentic Mexican cuisine as far as I&#39;ve tasted so far. I love their burritos and the chicken quesidillas are always good. The burritos are huge by the way and you can get melted cheese coated over the food as well. As it is commonly seen, there are complimentary chips and salsa, which is just &#39;meh&#39; for me. The chips can be stale sometimes and the salsa isn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had. 

The place in general is pretty roomy and relatively clean, but the bathrooms are a little on the dirtier side, not sure if they get cleaned often. The wait service is pretty good when it&#39;s there, otherwise it&#39;s mostly self service of getting your drinks and refills on chips and salsa.

Def could use a health inspection. Chicken comes frozen in plastic packages. The teenager doing to the cooking barehanded the frozen chicken pieces. The result is a greasy pile of chicken, moist fries and fritters. Chicken ends up tasting like powdered sugar from the fritters. Overall, was extra tough on the digestive system. 

Secondly, while I respect free speech and recognize that there are plenty of law enforcement in the local community, I don&#39;t need to be reminded that Blue Lives Matter. The stringent laws we have against assaulting police officers make it clear that that their lives are valued. A Chicago man got 32 years for assaulting an officer with a bottle- a year for each stitch that officer received. The man who shot officers in Dallas was executed by a robot with no due process.

If there is not a change of how they price their menu they will be forcing the next generation of patrons to go other places.  If not already.

$43 for two chicken entrees with an ice tea, tip and tax........please.  First step would be to blow up the current menu......offer some lower price options while keeping the staple chicken option.  You will get the business back by the over priced cocktails people order. You won&#39;t have a chance at the cocktails if you get dwindling guests to fill seats.

They say one comment speaks of 50-100 that would not have bothered to say something.
Hopefully, the management has the pride to read and understand that there is a changing demographic of patrons.  If they are satisfied that they have enough patrons driving in once every few months from an hour away, then read no more.
The Astor family has obviously done more right than wrong over the past 62 years.  Though I would bet they are as challenged as ever with competition to keep people coming back and maintain a profit margin to be happy about.

I want them to succeed.  Though I would bet the only way they are around in the next 20 years if if the next generation of Astor&#39;s understands that the next generation of patrons is holding them up against competition for their dollar."

The staff are formally dressed in black dresses, black slacks, black ties and even bow-ties. Everything about them is puritanical. Perhaps it&#39;s their formality coupled with the lack of ambient music that makes an oddly silent dining experience. Or maybe it was the marble chill (we remained snugly in our jackets). There were about five other groups of casually dressed guests that evening and we were all speaking in hushed tones.

The menu was simple. Exactly what you would expect from a place called White Fence Farm. Fried chicken. Fried fish. Pork chops and steaks. M got her fried chicken with a side of mac n cheese and with my fried fish came mashed potatoes.

To be brutally honest (and in such a church like atmosphere on a Sunday evening I feel compelled to lay myself bare), it was not the best food in the world. Their world&#39;s greatest chicken and even the fried fish certainly had a fine, delicate crisp to the fried batter protecting the succulent interior flesh. They were cooked beautifully. But like a communion wafer, neither of them had flavor. It wasn&#39;t marinated. It wasn&#39;t seasoned with salt or pepper. M borrowed my pale yellow, condensed-soup-like gravy and poured it over her chicken. I squeezed lemon and then dollops of tartar sauce on my fish.

The mac n cheese appeared as if it came from a box (although it might have been painstakingly made from scratch) and I swear that my mashed potatoes did too. They were too perfectly composed, eggshell white and grainy to be real.

What was truly amazing were the unlimited &#34;relishes&#34; served to us before our disappointing entrees: Bean Salad, Cole Slaw, Cottage Cheese, Pickled Beets and Corn Fritters. Our server informed us that a relish dish was a tray with several openings for small dishes. In each dish was served a little nibble of something (such as the relishes served to us and every guest at the White Fence Farm). Now the serving contraption from which the relishes got their name is gone but they continue to call those small nibbles relishes.

Anyway, each of the relishes were delicious. We had seconds of everything except for the corn fritters (which were also splendid but like dessert). We wanted to take them home with us but due to their free and unlimited nature, we could only take chicken and fish. In fact, we were given double paper sacks for our left-overs, restricting us to taking ONLY the chicken and the fish. Anything else would be an unattractive mess.

M admitted that for the price we could not have done better. M&#39;s chicken was $15 and my fish was $15.75. She also got two glasses of wine for $4 each. FOUR DOLLARS. And not to mention all of the splendid relishes. Aaah! Those relishes. Pure, wholesome goodness. Nothing fancy.

In the end, we were the last to leave soon after their closing time at 8:00 PM. They were crawling on their knees wiping the seats of the chairs and the legs of the tables. A matronly woman counted cash at a desk behind the host stand."

For $15 per person, we had the fried farm chicken dinner. In addition to unlimited portions of accompaniments, you are due four pieces of fried chicken and one side. The four pieces of fried chicken includes a wing, drumstick, thigh, and breast. Accompaniments include pickled beets, bean salad, cottage cheese, corn fritters, and cole slaw. If you finish these before your fried chicken arrives, don&#39;t fret! You can continue to order them as the meal progresses without any extra charge. As for the side, you have the choices of french fries, macaroni and cheese, baked potato, or mashed potato. Devour all four and I am certain you will fall asleep at the table. 

Generally, I am not a fan of white meat but I make an exception to White Fence Farm&#39;s. The chicken breast is well fried without drying up the meat. The juice is locked in and each bite leaves me wanting more. 

I would certainly frequent this place but I would also have to be sure to hit the gym afterwards."

My 2 piece chicken white dinner had the usual breast and wing combination.  I had to pick up the breast to confirm that it was in fact a breast.

I personally haven&#39;t been here in probably five-six years. We all had  the chicken dinner, except I had the chicken tenders (I&#39;m not a bone-in-meat type girl).

The food is great. I&#39;m a big fan of the relishes (beets, vinaigrette coleslaw, corn fritters, cottage cheese). I don&#39;t like mayonnaise so I opt out of the kidney bean salad. They serve them before the main meal, and during. However, it seemed like our second round of relishes was considerably smaller than the first round.

The chicken is consistently good, it was fresh and HOT out the oven last night. Crispy, juicy, and perfect. My tenders were awesome and were coated in the same breading as the actual fried chicken, so taste was identical, just no bone.

The mini-museum of vintage cars and items are always cool to look at. They also have vintage arcade games available for play which is also super cool. This place is definitely unique! They have also decorated for Christmas, and it&#39;s very pretty on the inside right now.

Service was okay. I think our server was switching between two different areas. He seemed like he was only serving our table in our area, then disappearing on the other side of the building. Can&#39;t blame him for being assigned two different sections, but it definitely affected service.

The crowd is mixed with families and older people. We went on a Sunday night and it totally had a Sunday &#34;Church-vibe&#34; going. 

Things that concerned me that makes WFF lose a star: My silverware was filthy. It looks like very old silverware too. They should definitely reconsider upgrading them or their dish machine that washes the silverware. Also, the floor around our table was filthy too. I&#39;m not sure if young children sat at our table before, but smashed french fries and crumbs were under and around our table which obviously wasn&#39;t very appealing."

We all ordered the fried chicken. Naturally, the usual cole slaw, fritters, etc. came as appetizers. I personally would have liked rolls over the fritters, but the fritters are what they are known for. 

My side was the fries, which were coated and awesome. Others in the party got the mashed potatoes, which I heard were a bit disappointing. The chicken, however, was outstanding...and this is coming from someone who lives near and frequents Del Rhea&#39;s Chicken Basket.

An experience in old, I answer.

Old. Old. Old! Old people for as far as the eye can see. I liken it to a field full of seedy dandelions....white puffs of fluffy spheres everywhere, each waiting to be gently blown for a secret wish. Just don&#39;t actually do it! They are our elders and I don&#39;t think they&#39;d like it if Johnny-Come-Lately saunters up and starts blowing his sweet breath into their freshly coiffed hair. Come on, have some respect!!!!

But seriously, going to White Fence Farm is a destination, an activity...an absolute joy! The museum is attached to the lobby/waiting room, so you don&#39;t mind if there is a wait! You have tons of old memorabilia to look at - from cars to a HUGE Raggedy Ann doll to a collection of nightmare-inducing old porcelain dolls. Gimme gimme! They also have a lot of old games you can play for a quarter - even a Zoltar-type fortune teller! I wished to be big and I woke up as Tom Hanks the next day. It was weird!

So old people, old stuff to look at...what else is old? The food it not old, but it&#39;s definitely the old style of &#34;supper club&#34; type dinners. They bring out these amazing relishes...red bean salad, corn fritters, cottage cheese, cole slaw, and dirt. No wait, pickled beets. I hate pickled beets bc they taste like dirt, but all of the other relishes are amazing! And you get refills on them before they bring your entree out! I could eat the red bean salad and cottage cheese all day...and the corn fritters, which are more like corn donuts from heaven. No jokes!

I&#39;ve only ordered the chicken there as my entree, and as chicken goes, it&#39;s very solid. The pieces aren&#39;t huge, but when you have like 2 gallons of red bean salad in your stomach, you don&#39;t mind so much.

I&#39;ve read some complaints about cost and what you get...but in my eyes what you get is a lot more than four pieces of chicken. You get to have a meal in a huge establishment consisting of crazy eclectic rooms filled with eccentric stuff from a long time ago. Not only this, but you get as much cottage cheese as you want, shoulder to shoulder with people who could potentially be friends with your grandma. 

This place is awesome. I didn&#39;t even talk about the animal pen with the llama and the baby goat. Take my money please."

White Farms can sit close to eleven hundred. They have many different rooms with themes. They love clocks, huge collection of wall, mantel, and grandfather clocks.
So I ended up eating in the red room. Went there for the chicken so I order me some fried chicken. Comes with corn fritters, coleslaw, and other garnishes. The server was really nice. Always came by to make sure things were well. My order came fast, and it was hot. It was good, but again I have had better. Gravy was OK, same with the mashed potatoes. Where ever I travel I am always looking for the best fried chicken in town. But have yet found a place that can compare to M &amp; M Soul Food in Gardena California.
Service:
It was great, everyone was really nice. Made sure I was fine ans asked if I needed anything.
Food:
Food was good, had better. But still worth your time.
Facility:
Again, it&#39;s crazy fun! Neat seeing all of the collection.
Had a great time, enjoyed it very much."

Not much has changed in that time except having a few more dining rooms and some refurbishing here and there.

The cost can be a little pricy for a half chicken and it varies per year between $14 and $16. Currently it&#39;s $15 per adult. The chicken is fantastic and with the chicken gravy they put on the table it&#39;s even better. The $15 includes all you can eat corn fritters, kidney bean salad, pickled beets, cole slaw, and cottage cheese. Drinks are extra. And be aware that they are on a well and the water, iced tea, and soda can taste a bit funny. Better to stick with a beer. 

They also have a good dessert selection. We usually get the brandy ice cream. 

New this year I see they offer soup and macaroni and cheese but none of us at the table tried any of those. 

Service is very attentive but they do employ a number of new waiters and waitresses so sometimes you need a bit more patience."

Took grandma there for her birthday ($5 off on day of birthday) and was pleasantly surprised.  Chicken had a really nice crispy skin.  I wasn&#39;t expecting much from the sides but they were surprisingly good.  Standouts were the corn fritters, nice vinegary cole slaw, and bean salad (never thought I would like it).  Don&#39;t worry about a reservation the place can fit like 1,500.  The waiter was fine when he was around but he was pretty busy and when my toddler spilled water on the table we had to get napkins ourselves.  The petting zoo outside only had goats and one small spot to put your hand through the fence.  As long as they&#39;re doing it how hard would it be to get some rabbits or llamas or something.  The baby goats were cute though."

Totally dated and is in need of a decorator!  The place is musty smelling and the &#34;museum&#34; .....what museum? 

Fried chicken has absolutely NO flavor. You don&#39;t even see any seasoning in the batter, not a speck of anything! Prices are outrageous for the cheapest items on the menu. First off, $15 for half a chicken (4 pieces). One chicken is bringing in $30, (4 chickens $120) and when there is a party of say... eight, that should be thirty-two pieces of chicken. What they do is they stack it all on platters, and nobody is going to sit there  and count to see if there ARE actually thirty-two pieces because everybody is hungry and grabbing pieces not realizing how many pieces the other person already ate. They don&#39;t serve each guest their own plate with four pieces. So,  are you really getting thirty-two pieces...... hmmmm????

Now for the cheap quality sides. Nothing is made from scratch other than the fritters probably. Kidney beans?.... out of a can. Beets?......out of a can, and cottage  cheese???? ......from plastic tubs!  

First, and last time!"

The property itself is big and has the country farmhouse feel.  There is a museum in the lobby that has antique cars, old photos, newspaper clipping and other odds and ends.  There are multiple dining rooms with different theme each holding up to 100 people.  

The menu has a variety items from steaks, shrimp, fish and their signature fried chicken.  Our group went with the fried chicken and everything was served family style which included corn fritters, coleslaw, bean salad and a side of potatoes.  

The food overall is good.  The corn fritters tasted more like doughnuts and the coleslaw had more a vinegar taste to it, which could be a hit or a miss depending on the person.  The bean salad was excellent.

When you order the fried chicken, you basically get a half a chicken, a leg, thigh, wing and a breast, so portions are generous.

There is also a small petting zoo at the back of the parking lot for the little kids."

We stumbled into White Fence Farm on our way down to Starved Rock.  (Obviously, we were insane if we thought there&#39;d be no traffic on 55 on a Friday. Yesssir.)  The menu literally has fried chicken, steak, fried shrimp and maybe a salad somewhere.  If you&#39;re looking for a healthy meal, just don&#39;t come here.  It&#39;s fine.  

All the dinners come with beet salad, cottage cheese, coleslaw, kidney bean salad and AMAZING corn fritters.  Besides the beets (as I&#39;m just not a fan in general), all the slides were actually really great!  The chicken comes out pretty fast, so you&#39;re not sitting and waiting for 20 minutes like at other places.  

This chicken is REALLY tasty and somehow not that greasy.  Crispy skin, juicy chicken - It was amazing. They gave us some Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s bbq sauce, too!  

Our waitress was VERY friendly and welcoming.  She even hooked us up with an extra order of corn fritters for the road!  Yum!  Oh, and this place is HUGE and the décor is really like a blast from the early1900&#39;s. There were tons of families and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Great start to our roadtrip!

FYI - If you&#39;re thinking about just splitting one of the entrees because you think the food is a little pricey, just don&#39;t do it.  They charge you a $7 plate splitting fee (because all the sides are served family style), so it&#39;s just worth it to pay $7 more to get an actual entrée for yourself."

White Fence Farm is so much more than dining. In fact, you could spend a day there. The layout consists of a museum, restaurant, and petting zoo. However, first and foremost it is a dining establishment, and the food didn&#39;t measure up. Thus, the two stars. 

Each diner orders an individual entree. With that comes a series of other items served family style. Standard fare is corn fritters, bean salad, cottage cheese, and beets. The corn fritters are definitely the highlight. They are sugary and soft, like a corn dessert item. In addition, diners get an unlimited amount. When one plate is gone, they bring another for the table. My dining companions remember corn fritters, sometimes called &#34;hush puppies&#34;, being crispy and these certainly were not. To a certain extent, I think that disappointed them. All the other items were average. It tasted a lot like buffet food. For my entree, I ordered the chicken strips. They tasted exactly like microwave chicken strips. Perhaps they were. The chicken was chewy and had no seasoning. The pieces were not very substantial. My family and I decided we would not return to White Fence Farm. We expected more out of the food, especially since the place was featured on &#34;Check Please!&#34;

After eating, we explored the museum and petting zoo. That was my favorite part. The museum contains vintage cars, appliances, knickknacks, and other oddities. My photographs show some of it. The petting zoo was disappointing. When I visited, all the animals were behind wired fence and we could not pet them. I&#39;m not a zoologist, but I think I saw a llama, sheep, and some chickens. It was no Brookfield Zoo."

What can I say; if you&#39;ve been paying any attention whatsoever to my reviews, you know I&#39;m an easy lay when it comes to fried chicken.

Our SB dinner adventures generally involve a place that under normal circumstances, would be very crowded, and or/far away. We took advantage of no traffic and no lines and headed to White Fence Farm in Romeoville. Despite its name, Romeoville will probably never be mistaken for a Shakespearean locale. Wherefore art thou Romeo(ville)?

Few tables were occupied, and those that were, were seated with cute little old ladies (likely who also didn&#39;t give a fig about the Super Bowl. Who am I kidding? That&#39;s probably Jennifer and me in 30 years.) in their sensible shoes and polyester double-knit pant suits. Positively adorable.

Meals start with retro dishes like canned beets, cottage cheese and kidney bean salad. I didn&#39;t want to fill up on that stuff so I can&#39;t comment on the taste, but I imagine they taste like you&#39;d presume. I did try the lauded corn fritters, which were decent, but I didn&#39;t figure they&#39;d be so sweet.

The fried chicken was respectable, if a wee bit pricey at $14.50 for half a chicken. Good breading-to-chicken ration, well-seasoned crust, and juicy interior; comes with choice of potato. I was mildly terrified at the highlighter-hued yellow gravy adorning the mashed potatoes so I skipped those in favor of good old-fashioned fries. Except they weren&#39;t. They were the nasty coated kind that I can&#39;t stand. Oh well.

Service was hospitable; mostly young adults who looked as if they&#39;d rather be anywhere than where they were.

WFF was pretty much exactly as I expected. Predictably hipster-free."

This is a classic, Midwestern, fried chicken supper club experience. Do you want to go back in time? Do you want to eat ridiculously tasty cornbread fritters, relishes from the past, and fried chicken? Do you want to have access to both an oddities museum AND a petting zoo before or after your meal? Then this is the place! 

White Fence Farm is an experience and a destination for the whole family. It&#39;s rare to be able to say that about a dining establishment these days. When I was a kid, I would get SO excited to drive down from the north burbs to have dinner here with my family. It never felt like going to regular old restaurant. It was so much more. Things haven&#39;t changed, and that is what makes this place awesome. No, I don&#39;t want them to update anything! No new menu! No new chef! No new ideas! What makes White Fence Farm White Fence Farm is that things haven&#39;t changed, and that it&#39;s a classic. 

Eat, have fun, have an adventure, step back a little in time, and appreciate a real family friendly establishment that is so different from the average restaurant. You can have fried chicken at a million places, but you can&#39;t get the same experience you&#39;re guaranteed to have at White Fence Farm.

A Chicago-area classic!"
white-fence-farm-romeoville,Jennifer S.,mYvZwQ3T5JzqwOyURQWA_w,"Bartlett, IL",1,1,1,344,2,L9B0xSNwlMERbqfTpdpV1g,3.0,2012-11-18,"So it&#39;s kinda funny to me that White Fence Farm is a restaurant that I&#39;ve been wanting to try for years and thought I had bookmarked. I hadn&#39;t. After today&#39;s dinner, I think its a sign as I must have unbookmarked it at some point. 

My son and I visited for dinner with three women after visiting the cathedral in Joliet. White Fence Farm was basically on our way home, so it made sense. They&#39;ve all been here before and we were the newbies, so they led the way. 

First, one of the women in our party got turned around, so we weren&#39;t a complete party. They wouldn&#39;t seat us without her. Thankfully, there is plenty of seating in the huge waiting lobby area. And, we entertained ourselves with the random things throughout. A vintage jukebox, fun house mirrors, old time cars, holiday decorations, etc. There is stuff ALL over to look at. 

Once our party was complete, we went to the Red Room. We received menus and we waited. And waited. And waited. It took forever for our server to wander over. The menu is kinda blah. I don&#39;t know exactly what I expected, but there were two chicken options, two fish options some steaks, a lettuce salad for $4, beverages and dessert.  It&#39;s one page of minimal options. Basically a quarter of the page is dedicated to their $15 per person chicken dinner. No, you cannot request all white meat (even for an up charge). I asked. They serve the chicken and the &#39;garnish&#39; family style. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this. 

So four of us ordered the chicken and my son ordered the fried shrimp. The server eventually brought our drinks and the aforementioned garnishes. I didn&#39;t get it. It seemed like the cole slaw, kidney bean salad, pickled beets, cottage cheese and corn fritters should have been served with the meal. The cole slaw was very vinegary, but good. I tried my first pickled beet. One of my dining companions referred to it as very earthy. I would have to agree. I skipped the kidney bean salad and cottage cheese. I don&#39;t think anyone tried the cottage cheese. We did eat the corn fritters. They were warm doughnut holes with powdered sugar and no corn flavor. I ate plenty of them and would eat them again without question. But I would never have called that a corn fritter. 

Empty glasses were the norm at our table as our server was moving in slow, disinterested motion. A platter of chicken arrived along with each potato option. My son tried the mashed potatoes with a neon side of chicken gravy, the ladies all had a baked potato with sour cream. I had the French fries. The fries were good. A frozen variety, but they were hot. This is more than I can say for the chicken. It was warm, but not hot outta the fryer fresh. I was disappointed. The breading was crisp which was nice, but the seasoning was lacking. 

When it was highly evident that we were done eating, you would expect the server to drop by. I don&#39;t know where he was or what he was doing, but I&#39;m guessing he was busy watching someone else&#39;s chicken get room temperature before he served it. (I was annoyed with him. Can you tell?). Eventually he brought carryout bags for our leftover chicken. Instead of handing us the bags, he stuffed his hand inside each one opening it up. Thanks for shoving your hand in my carryout container/bag. Not! 

My overall thought is that I would have enjoyed the whole chicken experience a whole lot more with a different server and hot chicken. And, I want to give White Fence Farm four stars. But I just can&#39;t do it. They have a fresh bathroom, plenty of parking and great doughnuts, so they get three stars for now."

Mere words cannot describe how awesome their broasted chicken is and the sides are to die for. When you order the corn fritters just make sure and order a dozen more because you won&#39;t be disappointed. You can eat inside or order takeout from the back. If you eat inside they have the mini museum of old cars which is a delight for the young and old. Inside eat in is a little bit pricey however the takeout is reasonable and well worth the money.

It looked nice, but rather flavorless. It seemed to me the breading had no seasonings at all. The mashed potatoes were clearly from a box, the gravy was glop, the cole slaw and bean salad bland. The corn fritters were okay. Iced tea was instant, and tasted like they used only half the suggested quantity of tea in the water.  One at our table requested a brand of beer, which the waitress said they had. After 15 minutes of no beer, he tracked her down. She simply told him they didn&#39;t have it, as though that meant he wouldn&#39;t ask for something else.

Here is the Not-So-Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.  I feel this is a very objective review based on my experiences. Here are the bullet points:

CHICKEN: Average at best, and that is stretching it.
CORN FRITTERS: Excellent.
COLE SLAW: Homemade and different.  Very good.
MAC &amp; CHEESE (had by my kids): Tasted like Kraft from a box.
MASHED POTATOES: Not homemade.  Appeared processed.  Nothing special.
LENGTH OF TIME TO GET SERVED: HORRIBLE!!!!!  Over an hour plus and THEN they ran out of chicken strips for my kids.  HOW do you run out of chicken strips at a chicken restaurant.  Really?  That is like going to Dunkin&#39; Donuts and them telling you that they don&#39;t have any coffee.  VERY upsetting, and my kids were upset, too.
WAIT STAFF:  They were pretty friendly actually.
ATMOSPHERE:  Mostly an older crowd and like visiting an episode of Antiques Roadshow.  However, it was pretty interesting to see all the stuff they had overall, so not too bad.
PARKING:  Boatloads of it.

Would I go back?:  Not if I am looking for a good, home-cooked meal.  The food was LESS than spectacular and the fact that they ran out of CHICKEN doesn&#39;t sit well.  I do plan to tell anyone that asks me as I live in the area and get asked about restaurants by me a lot.

Shame.  I was really hoping for something memorable."

I get the whole old fashioned vibe they&#39;re going for but you still need to upkeep your furnishings.  I thought the carpet, walls, tables and chairs could use a good scrubbing.  My daughter&#39;s crayon fell on the floor and as I picked it up I noticed a whole chicken&#39;s worth of  table scraps under the table.  gag.

The food came and I was ready to dig in but couldn&#39;t find a single clean utensil on the table.  All of the forks, knives and spoons and food crud dried on them.  gag.   My plate also had dried food crud on it.  gag.

The food was ok.  Chicken was a little dry, especially the chicken strips I ordered for my daughter.  Some of the relishes that come before the dinner were super vinegar-y.  I like sour/tangy foods and I could not eat several of the relishes.  The mac and cheese tasted like it came out of a box.  The chicken also was very underseasoned.

We have met here several times.  This was a childhood favorite restaurant of his family so they have a fuzzy warm feeling toward it. 

I really do like the side dishes here because I am stuck in the 1970&#39;s when it comes to things like pickled beets and kidney bean salad, I seriously love them.  

I also think the servers here are very patient with our table.  My husband is one of six kids so when they get together their old childhood habits of scoring more food than your siblings kicks in.  The waitress has barely put the food down and they are demanding more of everything and his brother is trying to talk her into giving him his chicken on an all you can eat basis.

I don&#39;t really like the chicken here or the bright yellow gravy, I was going to rate this restaurant three stars.  But while we were here I fished my wallet out of my purse and gave my husband an extra dollar to pay our share.  Then I apparently dropped it onto the floor instead of into my purse.  We got out, put on our coats and stopped at the washroom.  As I exited, I heard my name being called.

When I arrived at the hostess stand, I was handed my wallet with every bit of cash and every credit card still there.  I was flabbergasted and impressed.  What wonderfully honest people work here!

I had to give them an extra star for such integrity.  And my husband&#39;s family adores the chicken!"

It gives a chance to yell at each other and catch up.

We seem to meet at chicken restaurants or German restaurants.  Chicken is usually cheaper so we have been here a few times.  We eat too much, argue, talk and tell the same family stories, embellishing them a bit each time.

One of the family stories seems to be that they have really good chicken here or at least they did.  I like their sides but as it is all served family style and they start you out with small bowls it seems like it is the sibling Olympics to get a decent amount.  I wish they would just serve big bowls of it to start with.  They serve the chicken family style also and with my family, you&#39;ve got to stake out your four pieces and hope someone with swap me some dark meat.  This is why I bring my wife, she only eats white meat.

Too much work to get a decent meal and the chicken, it&#39;s better in my memory.  But the brother sister give and take, that&#39;s just like it has always been."

Not only a restaurant, but also a mini-museum dedicated to Midwest farming, plus tons of other random old shit.  Old car parts, farming implements, and other old relics in glass displays await diners waiting to be seated.  Plus a very photogenic giant fiberglass chicken in the outside entryway.

There are several dining rooms in this ramshackle old farm building.  Each room looks relatively the same, except for different types of hideous carpeting in each.  If you need to use the restroom, be sure to leave a breadcrumb trail back to your table, because this place is the dining version of Pan&#39;s Labyrinth.

The chicken and sides are all served family style.  It works out great for me, the dark meat lover.  While the rest of the group is fighting over the last breast, I am in thigh heaven!  The chicken is good, although not the greatest I&#39;ve ever had.  With your meal, you also get a choice of potato. My choice is fries, which I then cover in their unearthly colored yellow homemade chicken gravy.  The sides are my favorite part of the meal.  They will refill the sides free of charge, which is good, since I can put away a ton of their warm and tasty corn fritters.  The other sides consist of three bean salad, pickled beets, a vinegar based cole slaw, and cottage cheese.  Even though they have other things on the menu, like steak, chicken tenders, perch and shrimp, I  have never deviated from their fried chicken."

Nostalgic decor abounds, from antique registers, to grandfather clocks, to old timey hutches. There are several dining rooms, and what looked like an arcade. I believe there is a petting zoo on the lot as well. We were greeted by a very modestly dressed wait staff and seated almost immediately. Friendly people all around.

The food was decent. $15 per person for 1/2 a fried chicken (4 pieces) and several unlimited sides which include a bean salad (good), coleslaw (good), pickled beets (ok), corn fritters (AMAZING), and cottage cheese (umm, well, it&#39;s cottage cheese). The chicken was good, not overly breaded, crispy skin, juicy meat. The mashed potatoes were mediocre, at best, and the gravy was an interesting yellowish green. I was told it was a broth base. We ordered Mac n Cheese for the little ones and, while I did not taste it, it appeared somewhat liquidy. The fries were so good, though. Keep in mind that if you choose not to order for someone and instead share an order, you will still be charged a fee for the non-ordering party. A smaller fee is charged for children who do not order. 

Overall, it&#39;s not a bad place."

Everything looked the same to me, the old fashioned games and displays of trinkets to look while you wait for your table. We arrived at 5pm right when they first open for the day and ordered the fried half chicken which is $15 per person. That seems pricey, but you do get as much bean salad, cottage cheese, cole slaw, pickled beets and corn fritters as you want. I liked the corn fritters a lot but my wife thought they weren&#39;t hot and crispy enough. The chicken had a nice thin crispy breading and was piping hot. We had plenty to take home. We checked out their petting zoo after dinner which was one of the lamest ones I&#39;ve seen, actually pretty dirty and depressing."

I went to White Fence Farm a few times as a kid...the last time being around 1985. So many things change, and not always for the better, so when something stays exactly the same for decades, I can get down with that. I mean, unless it sucks.

Melanie S. and I diverted from our usual plan of Chinese food on Super Bowl Sunday to White Fence Farm, which has not changed at all (as far as my memory serves, anyway), and no, it certainly did not and does not suck. It was not the greatest meal we ever had, but it&#39;s a fun throwback to another era, and I think one can get a sense of that even on the first visit. Of course we had their specialty, fried chicken. We enjoyed it.  We got a good laugh out of the gravy that came with my mashed potatoes....it looks like lemon curd. Lemon curd likewise does not suck, but the bright yellow color just isn&#39;t too appetizing, although it tasted fine.  However, if I went back and they changed the gravy at all...I&#39;d be pretty disappointed. 

Anyway, we certainly had enough food (several sides are included) and left happy with our doggie bags. I think the best part of the ordeal was that White Fence Farm was not the least bit crowded, surely because of the game. I remember it being absolutely packed on my last visit...but maybe everyone&#39;s Big 80&#39;s Hair just made it seem that way. 

Obviously, Romeoville is not exactly convenient for us urban folks, but going back to White Fence Farm after all these years was pretty darn cool."

Yesterday was finally the day and I was psyched.

I knew from the get go that my childhood dreams could never be realistically met, but I was still a tad disappointed to pull up to the place and see that it is surrounded by warehouses with 18 wheelers pulling in and out at a steady clip. In my fantasy, it was smack dab in the middle of corn fields. Well, it probably was 40 - 50 years ago when my WFF dreams began. 

On the other hand, once we stepped inside, it really was like being transported back in time. The place is huge with one room leading into another, each with its own charm and style. We were seated in the &#34;Frontier Room&#34;. It was done up Old West style with western murals and mounted deer heads, etc. I am normally not overly fond of mounted anythings, but these deer were Bambi&#39;s great great grandparents.

I really loved the kitchy atmosphere from the chicken carpets to the museum and game room. I think the negative comments about the atmosphere come from folks who for the most part want the feel of nostalgia without the realities of age. As for me, I loved it, lock, stock and antique barrel.

The food was ok. I would not come back for just the food experience. There is too much good chicken closer to home. I did enjoy the relish dishes that come with the meal, but, that is what I grew up with. I agree that the fritters could have been more corny, but Christopher liked them just fine for what they were ... basically donut holes with a bit of corn in them.

The chicken dinner was good, but not great. I had it with a side of mashed taters that seemed not quite home made like I had dreamed of. The gravy was odd. It was like chicken broth thickened with cornstarch. It sure wasn&#39;t the country gravy of my fantasies. The chicken itself was moist and tender. That did not disappoint.

Christopher had the chicken tenders. They were also surprisingly moist and flavorful, but of the 4, two were much smaller and no dipping sauces were offered. When he asked, the only options were BBQ sauce, ketchup or ranch dressing.  I also had to ask for honey for my chicken. Usually in places like that it is provided. Add to that, they charge extra for those folks who want sour cream with their baked taters and one gets the feeling they are really watching the bottom line here.

Service was fine and friendly and the bathrooms clean and spacious. It is obvious that the place was built to accommodate a lot of people. In a huge place like that, when there are not too many patrons, it always feels a little low energy. I&#39;m sure a crowd were perk the joint up a whole lot.

The biggest disappointment was the &#34;petting zoo&#34;. As a retired zoo keeper, it always pains me to see animals living in shabby conditions. The sheep should have been sheared so they would be more comfortable in the heat and look better as well. The chickens should be presented in a much nicer surrounding, as &#34;all things chicken&#34; is the name of the game at WFF. A very small dollar investment could make a big difference in perception and quality of life for the petting zoo denizens.

So, in summary, the kitch factor is off the charts, the food is decent, if not great, but it needs a spark and some work to make it shine. Fix up the petting zoo, improve things like the gravy. Plate the food with a bit more enthusiasm ... even a sprig of parsley would help. It will make a world of difference. 

5 stars for kitch factor
3 stars for the food
3 stars for the service
1 star for the petting zoo
4 stars for the trip down memory lane."

You will see buses pulling in with customers coming from all locations far and near, your best bet is during the week.

She was kinda pissy and said my chicken was made to order so I figured I&#39;d just keep it and not change anything! This will be the last time I get White Fence Farm ever again!!

There is absolutely no way I would ever turn them down! Their fried chicken is the gold standard on my humble opinion, hands down. This fried chicken is what I judge all fried chicken against. The thing is that this has been true since I was young! The quality of their food has not diminished since I can remember. I have never left here feeling unsatisfied with the food or portions. 

The service here is usually relatively good considering they mostly have seasonal staff. The decor can best be described as vintage. The little museum area in the front of the restaurant has some pretty cool stuff and is worth a look. Meals here are more than just a meal.

This visit just WFF didn&#39;t seem  the same.  The coleslaw seemed like it had extra vinegar in it, they gave us our sides in the smallest possible dishes and then took a while to give refills.

Not overly fancy so casual wear is fine. They are known for their classic fried chicken which my family gets, but I like their steaks. They also have shrimp and fish which I haven&#39;t tried.  For appetizers they bring an abundance of old fashioned sides of corn fritters,  kidney bean salad, Cole slaw and beets. I usually end up filling up eating the corn fritters cause they are delicious. I eat so many fritters that I usually end up bringing half my meal home. At busy tmes, the wait can be a little long but they have a neat waiting area. They have antique items, cars and other things to make time go by quicker. Definitely a family favorite restaurant. Been going there for years with no major complaints."

White Fence Farm was a special occasion restaurant of my childhood. Funny looking back on it now, as there is nothing too special about WFF. But I must say the food is pretty damn good. 

The fried chicken is outstanding.  It is what fried chicken is supposed to be.  I&#39;m not much of a fried chicken eater, but WFF is the exception. It can be a bit greasy, but it&#39;s moist and perfectly seasoned. Sides are all delicious, with exception of the mashed potatoes.  Skip &#39;em.   My personal favorite item would be the corn fritters. Heavenly, if you like fried dough rolled in powdered sugar.  The Bean Salad and Beets are awesome, too.  It all goes great together!

The atmosphere is odd, but somehow charming. There are many rooms, and I always feel lost. Seems like a maze. If you&#39;re never been, be prepared for lots-o-old folks. There is an area by the front door that is pretty much a parking lot for walkers. Eating there is nothing special. I prefer the carryout, actually. The petting zoo out back rocks, though. 

Definitely a destination restaurant that is somewhat off the beaten path. Recommended for anybody who is in the area and likes fried chicken and fritters."

Lots to look at in take in... my girlfriend got a kick out of the clucking chicken machine that lays an egg when you feed it a quarter.  

But the focus is the food.  Why you would go to a place with a giant chicken out front and order a steak or fish is beyond me.  This place serves chicken, and it was great.  The pre-meal &#34;relishes&#34; were tasty... &#34;old-people&#34; food, as my girlfriend called them, but tasty nonetheless.  The corn fritters were tops, and we took plenty home.  Polished off the meal with a dish of soft-serve ice cream as well.  

The bill was reasonable, the service was great, though we were by far 20-30 years younger than the rest of the dining crowd this particular afternoon (and we&#39;re in our early 30&#39;s).

First, As my family of 7 and I sat at our table, there was a huge tray of someone else&#39;s dirty dishes piled up literally butting up to us at the table. GROSS!! It took us to ask someone, hello.. would you mind removing those dirty dishes with food, away from us and our table?! 
Second, our silver wear was so dirty with crusted old food on them! I asked for new and was told, oh I know... The dishwasher doesn&#39;t always work and said sometimes the people put to much in at once and it doesn&#39;t come clean! NICE!!! 
Third, our food was disgusting.  
Even when we asked the management, they admitted the food is made offsite and is canned. The mashed potatoes are instant! 
They profess that their food is supposed to be real?!! What a joke. 
The portions are horrible too. 
My small dog could eat more. 
Everything about this place was horrible. Extremely misleading. 
By far, the absolute worst restaurant my family and I have ever been to!! Ever !
Management was horrible.  
They refused to do anything and basically shrugged it off like oh well, to bad. 
Horrible!
I highly highly recommend thinking twice before going here. 
I will forever tell anyone and everyone what a bad place this actually is. 
Hard to believe this place stays in business. Especially when the original owners seemed to of cooked real homemade food , not fake canned, instant gross food.

I started going here a few years ago with my boyfriend and his family. I&#39;m not a big fan  of all the salads they bring out first. Boyfriend and I just went yesterday and we skipped most of it, I ate the cottage cheese and we got extra corn fritters.

The chicken comes out faster than you could say kentucky fried chicken. We had enough left over too that I had it for lunch today. Our waiter was also very nice and we got lots of corn fritters and some extra to take home, score!

It was a nice meal, especially after the loud annoying family across the way left. Not pleasant to eat to &#34;Do I push buttons? Am I annoying? Don&#39;t tell your son to be quiet&#34; &#34;Mom, he&#39;s being loud and it&#39;s rude!&#34; As she says this ten times LOUDER than her son was talking..

I had no idea that it was still open until last time on my visit I saw the billboard along the freeway on my way to the airport.  So that was the only request this trip - visit White Fence Farm not for the food, but the memories.  

However, I was happily surprised to find the food good.   Loved the kidney bean salad (that was something that I had forgotten).  The corn fritters were loved by others with me, but I found them a tad dry.  Having the unlimited &#34;relishes&#34; filled us before our meals and we enjoyed them all.  The chicken was really good and not tiny pieces like KFC or others.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were bad - stay away. My daughter&#39;s kids shrimp (3) were good, but I&#39;d return for the chicken.

Yes, the environment has changed - super old feeling, but for me that was perfect since it felt the same as during my childhood.  I plan to make it my part of my trip home."

This is the healthiest FRIED chicken you can ever eat. Why? Because the geniuses at WFF bake the chicken thoroughly before they flash fry it for only 3 minutes in a no-cholesterol vegetable oil. Voila--and that&#39;s how you get healthy fried chicken--sort of, not as healthy as grilled chicken, but whatever. And the chicken isn&#39;t the only thing that&#39;s good here--they have some amazing sides like pickled beets, kidney bean salad, cottage cheese, coleslaw, and not to mention my favorite corn fritters!!!

Why this place has less than a 4-star average rating is beyond me. I&#39;ve been dining here for years--ever since we were introduced to it by a friend in the restaurant biz.

Not that anything was falling apart but it definitely has an old-timey-country-farmhouse-comfy-Sunday-picnic kind of feel to it. Definitely a good place for family or big group dining. 

I love the fried chicken here. Very moist and tender. The pieces seem a little on the smallish side, but considering that lots of places have gone super-size-serving huge, perhaps this is what real serving sizes should look like. 

This is family-style dining so no matter if you get the fried chicken or other entrees, you get different sides to share with the table. The most popular side is probably the corn fritters--which I love as well. Small pieces of corn in fried dough dusted with powdered sugar. The other sides are the pickled beets, cole slaw, potato, and cottage cheese. Like Sunday country farmhouse picnics, right? 

Service has always been friendly and helpful. This seems like the place where the local high school kids work--like a rite of passage. 
Take some time to look around at the knick knacks and display cases with the old toys and antiques. Bring your camera so you can get your picture taken with the giant chicken outside."

You could have walked in there today or in 1981 and you wouldn&#39;t notice much difference at all. People go here because it reminds them of something.. I&#39;ll let you be the judge of that. 

Food - Steak was pretty good, sides were okay... In the days and times of the increase in popularity of farm to table type resturaunts.. You&#39;d think they were ahead of the curve here. Instead that is not the feeling you get in here. I wouldn&#39;t say my meal had fresh ingredience. My lady had the chicken. She liked it but didn&#39;t rant and rave about it. 

Service - You&#39;d think at a &#34;down home&#34; joint like this you&#39;d get some good service. Again, this is not the case. Don&#39;t forget this is a steakhouse. Check values are high. Tips are high for the staff. Service levels should be high. My constantly empty water and forgotten requests were not near the standard I&#39;d find at any other steak house. I&#39;m not talking Maestros either... think Outback.  Many of the service staff seemed young, unexperienced, etc. I really felt like this place did not emphasize service or the expereince here at all. Afterall if you&#39;re eating at a place like this, it&#39;s about the experience. 

This is a place that is dying slowly in my book. In a place that should deliver an experience, it falls short. As a young person, this is not a place I&#39;d like to take my family for memorable meals. Oh, and PS - get ready to shell out extra for sour cream on that baked potato. That was the icing on the cake that cheapened this place to a whole new level for me."

It helped keep the sandwich together as well. The meat serving in Tom&#39;s gyro was extremely generous...I can eat a lot and I had a tough time after half of the sandwich but it was delicious and hit the spot so i kept eating!

Service was fast and friendly, and the food prep area was clean. The man making the gyros washed his hands and wore gloves, another plus. 

I will definitely return for more gyros, as well as to try some other menu items."

Combo special galore. If you want burgers, gyros, or italian sausage etc this place has it all. This dining experience was a few months ago and they may have hired some new help as they seem to struggle with the menu. I had the gryo combo which was cooked well shaved from a large gyro spit. The fries are enormous almost to the point where I don&#39;t complain of getting too much fries but this is ridiculous. They should cut down on the size just a little bit. My wife had the chicken ceasar wrap which was not done well. It was breaking apart and the wrap was way too dry. Prices are slightly above average. They do have a crazy food challenge  which is a 2 lb burger with toppings, fries, and garlic bread you get your name and picture on the wall. 

Pro: large menu, gryos etc

Cons: average food quality

Hidden gem:
Lunch specials includes a very large fries and drink"

I live nearby and always said that I needed to try that place sometime. Glad I finally did! The woman who was working was friendly and welcoming. I had the chicken and bacon pita and it was really good. The ingredients were so fresh. I enjoyed Tom&#39;s and I&#39;ll be back. Looking forward to trying the gyros.

The worker even admitted it does when it rains. (Not normal)  As I ordered I seen the Gyro just laying out on the counter not covered or contained. The bread for the Gyro was so thin the entire sandwich broke! As I was eating, I notice a bunch of spider webs on the chairs. To make this experience even worse, I had ANTS in my drink!!! Good thing I didn&#39;t have a lid or else I would never notice. A bunch of ants on my cup, not just one or two. When I brought this to the workers attention, she was like &#34;oh they come from the pop machine because I forgot to clean it. It happens. &#34;  WHAT?? This was disgusting!  Then, after I stood there with disgust, the worker stated, &#34;oh, do you want a refund or sonething? Refund on the pop?&#34; Not the entire meal, just pop. This place needs a health and safety inspection!"

I have always be greeted in a very friendly fashion. Tonight was no exception even though they were a bit busy. I ordered the gyro plate and sat down to wait for it to be prepared. Very large and clean dining area. It didn&#39;t take long to get my meal. The gyro was wrapped in a thin pita and very large  the pita was great I didn&#39;t fill up on bread. It tasted great and the fries were the exact kind I like thicker   Loved them. This is a great place

When you first walk into the place it appears to be nicely maintained and clean. On the particular day I went, it was a weekday lunch.  The register was ran by an elderly lady whose mind was a little scattered and could not multi-task. It took her a couple minutes for her to realize she had to take an order and then she rang it up wrong. There were two other ladies preparing the food. One of the two seemed annoyed by the fact she was there and was snippy with her co-worker and even the customers. The wait for the food was long. It took about 20 minutes to get my gyros plate. They finally called a guy to come help who was sitting in the back office. I assume he&#39;s the owner. He didn&#39;t wash his hands before food prep but he did put on gloves which is still pretty disgusting. I told them it was for dine in which it didn&#39;t matter anyways because they packed it to go. This was a good thing because by the time the order was finally ready, I didn&#39;t have time to eat it. The food itself was average."

When will I ever learn but had such a craving for a polish (not a Maxwell Street style) I couldnt resist.  Not until after we placed our order did we notice the smell and after approaching the prep area did we notice how dirty. no, FILTHY, it was.  Not the busy after rush kind of FILTHY, but the I dont give a crap, I just want to go home without cleaning kind of FILTHY, filthy.

Coming from a food service background, I can tell you, I miss my grandparents and how clean they kept the food area.  It was seriously scrubbed down every single day and either Tom is a lazy Greek or the owner is neither Tom or Greek!

Regardless, the polish were charred and hard, the spicy feta fries smelled so sour, along with the feta fries, that we didnt want to take any chances, the giardiniera looked white and definitely old.  The other fries were overcooked and hard. Threw everything away after.  Nothing worse than spending so much to just throw it all away, but we werent going to take any chances.

I promise, I dont like being this rough with my reviews but you people need a serious intervention and makeover!  Needless to say, you can definitely tell no one has their heart in the place and until then, we wont be back."

There are a few ways you can get Kronos as your supplier.

1.  Is to have it brought in fully cooked by Kronos which is an abomination
2.  A restaurant can get the meat raw and cook it then freeze it which is also terrible
3.  the third option is you can buy the meat raw and cook it on the spot fresh

Tom&#39;s grill takes option 3, they simply buy the raw lamb from Kronos and cook it on the spot, they also have their own Gyro sauce and fresh homemade pitas, so they may buy Kronos, but Kronos is good if you cook and serve fresh like Tom&#39;s.  I still stick with 5 stars!"

Tonight was our first visit. It was hard to decide what to order, but my husband and I were both pleased with what we ordered.

I had the chicken bacon ranch wrap. I never order things like that but the person working sounded excited about it when I asked about it and described it well and it sounded good. It was awesome! There was bacon in every bite- yum! It tasted hot and fresh and I would definitely have it again. 

My husband got the two hotdog combo and I had to have a few bites- the hotdogs here are great too. The fries are fresh cut- not my favorite kind of fries but better than I expected. I didn&#39;t see salt anywhere in the restaurant (not on the tables or counter) but I know I could have asked for some. We also got some garlic bread which was so-so but they made it themselves- it wasn&#39;t frozen so that&#39;s good. They give good sized portions.

They serve Pepsi products and Dr. Pepper and there are free refills. 

I don&#39;t know if they always do this but tonight they had a bowl of homemade cinnamon sugar pita chips out- they were SO good! I bought a bag of them to take home. If they have them when you go you HAVE to try them- delicious! 

The floor of the restaurant was pretty dirty (lots of wrappers all over the floor) and the tables were kind of too. Maybe they had been really busy before we got there? One kind of strange thing- when I went to buy the pita chips, the young man (a different person than the man who served us for our meal) held a big bag of garbage in one hand the whole time he was ringing me up. It didn&#39;t quite seem restaurant-appropriate or particularly sanitary (though the pita chips were bagged and he wasn&#39;t touching our food), but he was a nice guy.

I like it when we leave a restaurant and we exchange goodbyes with the people working- it feels like a nice family-owned/community type thing. :) We are really happy we gave this place a try. We&#39;ll be back."

This morning, I had a craving for Gyros and decided to do a simple google search which brought me here. I have driving past this location for years without any clue about the delicious food inside. 

I walked in and was introduced to a lovely lady. In fact, there were 4 people working today. I placed my ordered of a gyro and waited. 

The food took about 15 minutes which was okay because at least I knew my food was being cooked fresh and it was not held warm for who knows how many minutes/hours. I saw someone cut the gyro meat from vertical cooker. And then he cooked it a little more on the flat top.

I got my food and went home. The bag was a little heavy which is always a good sign. I looked into my bag and I saw a football sized item which was wrapped in aluminum paper. Wow, I thought... this is my sandwich. I bit into it and it was divine. Everything was stuffed inside a pita bread, which is barely held together due to the amount of meat they used. I know I will be back to this location."

Heard great reviews on the Greek chicken pita wrap only to get a  burrito looking item filled with nothing but lettuce and a vinegar and oil type of dressing. Not even an ounce of chicken in this thing. There was a trace of tomato and they completely forgot the red onion and feta it supposedly has.  No thanks. Garbage. I&#39;m headed down the street to Main Street Greek Kitchen. My son ordered the gyro and it was sick good tho. Boo for me though!!

I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever paid more than $15 for the both of us and we&#39;ve left stuffed each and every visit. That&#39;s hard to do these days. We also appreciate the frequent customer punch cards.

Their Greek Chicken Wraps are to die for. The meat is well marinated and cooked to perfection. The wrap itself is like a cross between a pita pocket and a tortilla. It&#39;s not paper thin, so it holds all the ingredients in throughout the meal. It&#39;s also not so thick that it gets in the way of the other flavors or becomes a chore to consume.

Get the Feta Fries! Don&#39;t ask questions. Just do it! The diner fries are perfectly cooked to a nice, crispy, golden-brown outside. They would be good fries on their own, but adding crumbled feta cheese only enhances the experience."

I know this because John offered me a taste of their homemade and pretty good chili, and I got the seven-month-old scoop when I asked if he was Tom. 

Six people were working at Tom&#39;s when I arrived, but I only saw one other customer during my eat-in lunch at noon today. A Wednesday, yes, but still, that&#39;s not good. Any place that offers Roxette, Bobby Brown and REO Speedwagon at a pleasant level during my stay deserves more customers. 

It doesn&#39;t appear that much has changed since I&#39;d come a couple of years ago to celebrate the passing of actuarial exams. The quotes are still on the wall. The cinnamon chips are still offered to sample. The gyros special still comes in the flatter pita and wrapped, ready to neatly eat. The fries are still cut thick. 

This time, my gyros had the thinnest-cut lamb meat I&#39;ve ever had. I noticed that the one preparer was using an unusual powered-up device to cut the lamb meat. The onion was decent and the tomato wedges were good for tomatoes not grown in your own garden. I asked for tzatziki on the side and got a healthy portion. There was enough food that I couldn&#39;t finish my meal. Forgive me, Mom.

The gyros wasn&#39;t perfect, though, in that they need to work on their wrapping, or more accurately, the placement of toppings in the pita once it&#39;s wrapped. It took me a multitude of bites before I tasted any onion, and then suddenly it was Onion-palooza! Please allow each bite (or small group of bites) to be representative of the gyros as a whole. This is especially important when presenting the gyros wrapped in a paper-foil container. I&#39;m relying on you to give to give me the right experience, Tom (John). 

A ketchup upgrade is in order too. While the fries were good, I still like a little ketchup with them, and what was offered was poor in quality. I&#39;d rather deal with Heinz packets than the big community bottle of watery generic red.

And the phrase &#34;I prefer pink lemonade to the regular kind&#34; has been said by nobody, never. (Not above the age of 14, at least.) Get rid of the pink crud. It stood in my way of making an Arnold Palmer, a preferred drink for me while I&#39;m starting the back nine.

This place is pretty good. Not great. But pretty good, pretty friendly, pretty comfortable, pretty OK. I have yet to have a bad meal here. I&#39;ve seen bad hot dog reviews, but with new ownership, the dogs may deserve another walk around the park."

I typically stay with jimmy johns or some other chain where I know what im getting. A previous employee left a menu for toms in the drawer so I gave it a shot. That was about a month ago. I have ordered 5 times since.
The ribeye sandwich is my favorite although its not huge at 9 dollars with fries and a drink its a great bargin. The french roll is always toasted and the home cut fries are a more than generous portion.
When you call you get the old school home town resturant service. Although the phone conversations arent the most polite I have ever had. They are quick and to the point and my order is never wrong. They usually say 45 min for delivery and are here within 30. 
The chicago style hot dog has all the fixings and for 2.25 is a steal.

Tom&#39;s looked intriguing so we tried it for a family dinner. I tried the gyros and I am so glad I did.  You get to see the staff work and I was amazed when the server opened up a metal box and there was the gyros meat.  She cut off a huge, and I mean huge, portion, cooked it and wrapped in in a thin pita with sauce.  I must admit, I am not a huge fan of the thin pita, but it worked for this sandwich.  I thought that I would order a side salad with it with Greek dressing.  That was a mistake.  The salad was also Texas-sized with homemade Greek dressing and croutons.  It was great the next day for lunch!  My son ordered a hot dog and delicious home cut fries.  We are going back again for the fries.  One daughter ordered a Chicago dog which disappeared quickly and my hubby ordered a Italian sandwich which was also good.  We had two milkshakes which were very yummy.  Our only complaint was the grilled cheese sandwich for my third child.  I don&#39;t know if they use margarine or something else besides butter, but it gave the grilled cheese a funny taste.

Admittedly, I am not a huge fan of fresh-cut fries, but they were pretty soggy and bleh by the time we got home.

But....the best part of the meal was the &#34;Greek nachos&#34; featured on a specials board. The thin and crispy pita chips were topped with feta cheese, onions, tomatoes, and gyro meat. These were PHENOMENAL...I ate what was left for breakfast this morning!!

The restaurant itself lacks ambience - sticky chairs and poster paper listing menu items. Definitely more of a take-out joint.

Although we were intitally the only people who had an order in, the food preparation was not quick - it took about 25  minutes after ordering. There were two people behind the counter, and the manager(?) apologized for the wait. We weren&#39;t in a hurry, but factor this in if you are.

Tom&#39;s Grill: Just south of the Highland/Roosevelt intersection -- grabs my eye, I could go for a hot dog.

The inside is clean, cheery and simple. I was greeted immediately. The menu is hot dog stand meets gyro joint -- hot dogs, burgers, gyros, salads and pitas. While the whole menu sounded good, I went simple -- hot dog, no relish, and fries. The fries were skin-on, fresh-cut, piping hot and delicious. The dog was dressed just right, and while it wasn&#39;t exceptional, it was done well. It could only be improved via a quick char-grill, but that&#39;s my preference :)

Seeing a Red Hot Chicago neon sign from a distance I was enticed to go in and try their hot dog.

The hot dog I received came on a plain non-poppy seed bun. The bun was soft in the middle but was actually hard on the edges. The sausage itself was skinless and was steamed fairly well. Unfortunately, the pickle was cut at an unusual angle and was nearly as thick as the hot dog itself. The relish, mustard and onions (which were diced very thinly) were applied properly. I did not detect celery salt, there was a small cut of tomato on the hot dog as well. The bun definitely could have been softer and due to the thickness of the pickle I couldn&#39;t but feel like I was eating a pickle sandwich with a hot dog on it, not the other way around.

I can&#39;t comment on any of their other food, but I was not at all impressed with the hot dog here. Despite friendly service and a clean inside, based on my experience I wouldn&#39;t return."

One staff member in particular was complaining about the guy at the register loudly- using profanity regularly and when the other worker told her to shush she basically said it&#39;s so loud that no one could even hear her- except We did. They argued back and forth over who was getting what made. Orders went out randomly and 2 gentlemen waiting for food for quite a long time. I did not make out all that was said but some type of racial slur seemed to be made like &#34;I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t speak Spanish&#34; - in regard to asking them something about their order- yet when I heard them speak they were speaking English.

It&#39;s a real shame that the staff is so unprofessional when the food was so good, but the experience &#34;left a bad taste in my mouth&#34; so to speak because of the unnecessary chaotic loudness of employees and rude behavior."

Very good meat and for me just the right amount of sauce, onions and tomato. The pita was thinner and it came closer to being wrapped like a burrito than the traditional folded bread. I usually don&#39;t like fresh cut fries as they are always a soggy, greasy mess but these were fresh cut and crispy. He told me it&#39;s a two day process between the brine, baking and frying. A massive amount ( too many ) of very good fries. A great deal for the Monday special of $6.25. Very clean in there. Warm too. I don&#39;t know if they were an owner or manager or who but the two men working were very pleasant. If you can make it through the pot holes on Highland safely this is a great place to end up and I will definitely be back."

This place occupies the space formerly held by the short-lived Pockets.  Your standard Greek-owned/inspired fast food joint.  Also commonly referred to as a beef joint. gyros place, hot dog stand, etc.  They feature Greek-style Chicken, gyros, burgers, pitas, standard fried sides, salads fish, and a few unexpected items like hummus, homemade pita chips,  and baklava.  Tom himself was there to greet customers wearing a shirt that cleverly said &#34;My Grill&#34; while (I think) his son and another family member were there to serve!

I saw how they did a beef and sausage combo, and I was impressed.  They use Turano or Gonnella french bread.  You can tell it when you see it, these guys aren&#39;t skimping.  Beef was thin-sliced and flavorful, and the sausage was perfectly grilled.  Added mozzarella and it melted beautifully.

Apparently Tom also used to own the former Jolly&#39;s on Roosevelt Rd. (now Maxfield&#39;s).  Glad to see him back in the game!

Stop by and say hi to Tom, and make sure you ask him if it&#39;s his place.  Bets are he&#39;ll stop wearing that shirt pretty quickly."

you ever have that moment, right as you&#39;re about to launch some food in your mouth, and you think to yourself, &#34;Oh man.... this is going to be so good.&#34; and as you&#39;re chewing your food, and the flavors explode in your mouth, you think, &#34;Yes! All is right in the world.&#34;

Yes. That&#39;s how I felt the first time I tried a gyro at Tom&#39;s Grill. Look.. I can go on and on about how remarkable the yogurt sauce was, or how the meat is flavorful, and the thin pita is just the icing on the proverbial cake. 

If you love gyro&#39;s, go and try theirs. They also have other food on the menu, but I wouldn&#39;t know about that as I died and went to gyro heaven.."

This is not the same old kronos thrown on some old, thick pita with some store bought tziki sauce. Tom&#39;s gyros is a very flavorful gyro meat sliced off the spit, thrown on the griddle to render the fat, then stuffed in a thin pita with homemade sauce, onion, and tomato, served with homemade fries. They also have excellent side salads, and if you&#39;re up for it - the bellybuster challenge.

Turns out Sticks  and Stones is the brainchild of the owners of the Lucky Monk in south Barrington,  which Ive never been but explains why Sticks and Stones has some of their beers on tap.  Walking in the space is small and cozy a small patio in front and on a warm day a screen that opens to the outside.   

Pizza is the speciality,  I opted for the sausage and broccoli with evoo, my friend had the honey and something.   You&#39;re handed your drinks right away and my beer was full,  amazingly I walked all the way outside without any spillage,  but on a crowded day,  I&#39;m sure it would have been a different story.   Maybe there were ten other patrons inside and we were the only ones outside.   The staff was great, 2 girls and a guy came out throughout our meal to ask if we needed anything.   More on him later on.   We were brought a side of sauce which was homemade and very very good!  The pizza was excellent I&#39;m guessing made from scratch daily,  there was probably a sign that did that it was,  I&#39;m sure I missed it.   Back to the young man who asked us if we wanted water.   We had the option of either sparkling or filtered, being Disney aficionados we both burst out laughing.   Two of our favorite restaurants in Disney also ask the same about the water,  although there was a third water option in Disney that we couldn&#39;t recall at that moment.   Then we were asked if we wanted ice in the filtered water which then led to an even louder outburst of laughter.  

As a side note when we came back from Disney the first restaurant we went to gave us ice cold water,  I don&#39;t know about anyone else, but I don&#39;t want ice cold water,  water is cold enough right from the tap.  I want room temperature water,  and for us to be at a restaurant and have water options,  it was great.   Our experience was almost Disney like. 

There is Plush Horse ice cream available which we didn&#39;t have and only noticed the small sign on the sidewalk as we walked to our table.   

Very well done.   

Thank you!"

It is like the Australian cafes, almost self service. You order your pizza at the counter and one of the waitresses will bring the food to your table. The water is free and you get a glass from the front and ask your date to fill it up for you. They have choice of regular water and sparkling water. 

Now to the main event. These are California style ultra thin crust pizza as normally serve one. I don&#39;t remember customizing the pizza, as the given topping themselves are super delicious and exotic. My favor one is Arugula and Procuito. As I mentioned before its California styles topping as well. 

Over all I went back there again. Super cool atmosphere and delicious food."

The salad was AMAZING. Perfect combination of ingredients to make great flavors. The croutons were perfectly soft and the right size. The pizza was good. All of the ingredients were fresh.

Overall the food is what&#39;s important, so i&#39;m gonna go 4-stars, but they have some work to do. 

5 stars = Food
3 stars = Service
3 stars = Ambiance

When you walk in, there&#39;s a huge menu on the wall. The register is at the front, so you basically place your order at the register and then they give you a buzzer/# thing that you take to your table so they know where to bring the food. 

We both ordered soup as well as an individual pizza. Unfortunately our pizza came out like a minute after our soup. So it sat there getting cold while we ate our soup. It would&#39;ve been nice if it was spaced out a little bit more. 

At first, the employees seemed nice. There were two guys and a girl working. The two guys both seemed like they were in their twenties, the girl was a teenager. They all seemed to be working hard. Never just standing around. At one point, one of the guys came by and was nice enough to refill our drinks for us (you fill up your own drinks at the fountain machine after you order). 

The reason i knocked down the stars to 3 for Service was because there was a family in there who had a problem with their order, and one of the guys went to their table to find out what the issue was and then stood there and argued with them in front of everyone. From my perspective i was always taught that the customer is always right. So no matter what, you do what you need to do to make them happy. Myself and my friend were both horrified that he was arguing with them. Everything up until that point had been great, so hopefully this person learns that&#39;s NOT ok. 

The one thing i didnt like about the ambiance was the seating. There were only 2 booths, and the rest were hard chairs, and single tables (for 2) where 1 was a chair and one was on a long bench thing. I hate that kind of seating. I wish they&#39;d had normal tables and more booths. It&#39;s basically a &#34;get &#39;em in and out&#34; kinda feel to the seating.

Ok, I want to end on a positive, so let&#39;s discuss the food. The soup was quite delicious!! I had chicken tortilla and it was so good. My friend and I both had the Pepperoni pizza and it was REALLY good. I would totally go back for their food, most specifically that pizza!!! It&#39;s not your standard pizza. it&#39;s &#34;homemade&#34; and fresh and so so yummy. 

Definitely stop in and give it a try. Just know it&#39;s more of almost a fast-food type place rather than a restaurant where you&#39;d go and sit for a couple hours.  Enjoy!"

As a person who studies what it really means to make a VPN (Verace Pizza Napoletana) pizza, I&#39;m always open to the idea of trying a new pizza place.  I regularly make pizza at home, but lack the complexity that a wood fired oven can offer.  If I had the space, I&#39;d build a wood oven in my backyard.

We originally went to the Burr Ridge Mall to see what the farmers market had to offer, and we ended up here for dinner since this place looked new.  Walking in, the ambiance is warm, staff was friendly, welcoming &amp; explained the menu to us.

The menu offers some great choices that may be outside the comfort zone of most people who just want a pizza.  I thought they all looked great, and would try everything on the menu.  I&#39;ve read through the negative reviews here on Yelp and can conclude the people didn&#39;t understand what they were ordering, and thus gave a negative review, which is totally unfair.

We ordered Aiden (4) a kids sausage pizza meal that came with carrots &amp; ranch appetizer, smaller (8in) pizza, cookie, and drink for only $6.50.  This is an amazing deal!  Way more food than a 4yr old can eat, but he declared everything &#34;yummy&#34;

I ordered the Sausage and Broccolini, was pretty epic.  The roasted broccolini was a nice addition. Their condiments (parmesan, oregano &amp; chili flakes) all seemed very fresh and flavorful.  

Chrissy ordered the Mushroom and Arugula, and was happy with her choice.

For drinks they have craft beer and wine selection.  Chrissy got a Dale&#39;s Pale Ale and I ordered some of the wine they had on draft. (yes, draft wine!).

Qualms with our experience.  

1) All of our pizzas came out at a different time.  Roughly 10 minutes difference between pizza 1 and 3.  When the pizza oven can handle 5+ pizzas at the same time, they should try to keep tables orders together.  The owner did apologize that they had to remake one of our pies since they it did not come out right.  I appreciate the honesty, and concern with perfection.  But it was hard to stare at the other pizzas on the table and wait to eat the one I had ordered.

2) The cashier did not ring up the wine I had ordered correctly.  I ordered a 0.25 carafe of red wine, but I was charged for a 0.5 carafe.  On my way out, I tried to rectify the situation with the cashier.  She quickly acknowledged the mistake as her own issue with the register.  But it took 15 minutes for the owner to provide a solution.  Since the problem couldn&#39;t be resolved in the register with a voided / altered transaction, I ended up receiving a favorable sum in gift certificates.  The only problem is that it took 15 minutes to come to a resolution and finally receive them.

Overall we&#39;ll definitely be back (in part because we have to use the gift certificates!).  The pizzas were great, (better than all of the neapolitan places in the suburbs that we&#39;ve been to)."

If you&#39;ve had a pizza in Italy then you get why were happy that this Italian style wood fired pizza craze has hit the United States. I was getting frustrated having to go downtown to Parlor etc in order to get the style of pizza and now we have one in our neighborhood. You may need to make small variations to the menu like for instance I get the wild mushroom pizza but do not get the arugula. Solid decor and the owner Jason personally thanked me for my visit. Prices are probably where they should be. I approve!

We&#39;ve eaten here once a week since the third day they opened.  They make authentic, old world style pizza, giving you a taste and texture that&#39;s really hard to find.  The only other place we&#39;ve found that comes close is Fireside in La Grange (but we prefer Stix &amp; Stones for their higher quality ingredients and more unique specialty pizzas).

The service is also top-notch.  The first time we ordered the Sopressata (spicy pepperoni), it had too much oregano.  The manager gave us a free pizza on our next order.  If you&#39;re dining in, you order at the register, find a table, and they bring the food to you when it&#39;s ready.  White cloth napkins and upscale décor make you feel like you&#39;re at a nice sit-down restaurant.

Aside from the pizza, we recommend the homemade meatballs, the arugula and kale salads, and the honey &amp; ricotta appetizer.  We honestly have yet to try a dish we didn&#39;t like."

The girl said this was pizza for one so me and my friend ordered one for each of us. There&#39;s no way these are personal size pizzas. So the pizza came and we were disappointed when we saw it. Where a the cheese? On this 12&#34; pizza there&#39;s about 5 small circles of mozzarella cheese. I know they&#39;re supposed to be &#34;artisan&#34; pizzas but I expected a little more than just a bunch of tomato sauce on it. The ends were crisp but the middle was completely mushy. As soon as you picked a piece up everything just slid off from all the sauce. Terrible pizza. I was shocked when I saw all the good reviews. The positives??? Can&#39;t think of anything. Find somewhere else to eat and save yourself the money. Was not worth $26 for these two pizzas.

We have only had the pizzas because they are amazing.  The quality of the ingredients is what makes every bite of the pizzas taste amazing!  The crust is bubbly, charred (in a good way), and holds the wonderful ingredients very well.  The tomatoes are amazing...they even bring you out a little dish of sauce to dip your pizza in.  

This is not your average pizza...it is thin and a little floppy and seems like its wrong...but it is so right!  You have to fold your little piece and it works perfectly...no utensils needed!

I have tried most of the pizza flavors and I ALWAYS go back to the Honey Luv...something about that hint of honey makes my mouth water!

Service is TOP NOTCH and there is a really cool craft beer selection...you can have a drink while you wait for your pizza...it only takes like 6 minutes!"

I ordered the beef sandwich w broccolini and my friend had pizza.  My portion of broccolini was tiny - 3 thin stalks.  My beef sandwich was ok - meat was tender, no gravy so the bread was dry.  There were a couple pieces of red pepper and a little mozzarella. But, the food came within 10 minutes, a server visited the table several times, and overall, an average meal w nice service.

But after I left, it occurred to me that while you order and seat yourself, a server brings the food and attends to the table.  But, I left without tipping which made me feel awful. 

Today, I went back by myself and ordered the same thing.  I waited 20 minutes for my food. The beef sandwich was v dry and I swear, it had less meat than last time.  The server who brought my food didn&#39;t give me silverware/napkin. He promised to come back, but never did.  I went to counter and got them myself.  From that point on, nobody checked to see if my food tasted good, or if I needed anything. From where I was sitting, I could see that other tables were receiving poor service as well.  The men next to me never got their beer, and another table got the wrong pizzas delivered to them.
There was one server bussing tables, and serving food.  It looked like they were short-staffed, but not one person apologized for the delay, the lack of silverware, or attention. 

I tried to speak to a who appeared to be in charge, but he was v busy in the kitchen assembling food.

Maybe the summer employees are back at school and Stix/Stones didn&#39;t plan well from a staffing perspective. I live in Burr Ridge and like many other residents, want to spend my money here.  I&#39;d hoped that today&#39;s experience would make me a fan, but it didn&#39;t."

I went in to order carry out, since they were going to be closing in about 30 minutes. The staff is nice, but they did forget to give me a side that I had ordered, even though she had repeated it back to me to confirm. 
The food was ready a lot faster than I expected. The pizzas are good ( I ordered the Speck &amp; Egg and also a pepperoni pizza). I do wish there would be more cheese though. My dad was surprised at his, since there was barely any cheese on there at all, mainly uncovered sauce. I also got the chopped salad (I had asked for dressing on the side, but they also forgot to give that in addition to the other side dish, and I didn&#39;t realize it until I was already home). And the cauliflower cous cous was very tasty, although a bit too oily.

I thought it was a really poor pizza.  Thin crust was the best part- crispy enough, but the toppings were not much.  I had the speck pizza, and there was one small slice on each quarter of the pie.  They were so thin as to be literally transparent.  There could not have been more than 1/8 ounce of speck on the whole &#34;Speck&#34; pizza.  They don&#39;t even offer pepperoni, as far as I could tell.  They have a trendy decor but not much else to offer. I asked for hot giardinera and got a little dish of ground-up something unidentifiable which had no flavor at all.  Wouldn&#39;t even consider going again- and I live in Burr Ridge."

My daughter and I each ordered our own pizza, but we could have easily shared one. They are bigger than your average personal pizza size.  They were good, but keep in mind it&#39;s not your traditional Chicago style pizza. For starters it&#39;s wood fired, so it has the fire like taste and burnt edges. Also, it&#39;s not loaded with cheese. The crust is very thin, but the edges bubbly.  I ordered a build your own with mushrooms and sausage. The sausage was bland, but the overall taste was ok. My daughter ordered plain cheese. She was happy with it. The owner stopped by our table and chatted for a couple minutes, looking for feedback. That was a nice touch. He also offered to go get us some red sauce to dip our crust In. I didn&#39;t order a salad, but saw one at the table next to us and it looked really good.  The set up is that you order and pay up front at the register, then they bring you your food. You get the drinks yourself. We will def go again when we are at the mall shopping, but wouldn&#39;t go there otherwise."

The mushroom pizza had many different types of mushrooms and was loaded with them. The kids had cheese pizzas which were pretty standard, but they thoroughly enjoyed them. The dough for all of the pizzas is extraordinary!  The Hippie sandwich was full of veggies and huge!!  And we added chicken which was so tasty. All in all an excellent addition to the neighborhood"

The cheese curds were good, but nothing to write home about.

Overall,  I&#39;d have to rate this as a very positive experience.  Delivery time for food was typical to a little longer than expected,  although not bad.

I called to cancel it after an hour and a half of not showing up. The manager said to me they would bring to me for free for the inconvenience. An hour passed by and still nothing. I called again to advise I still hadn&#39;t received it. The manager said their employee told driver not to go. So she sent driver to drop off calzone and she sent a piece of cake and a can of soda. The manager was nice but I felt like the other employees there don&#39;t care. Another time I ordered pasta with chicken and they forgot to add chicken. On Mondays they have buy one get one free pasta. I ordered delivery and was happy with the special but then the following Monday the guy that answered to take my order said the bogo special was not valid for delivery only take out. I advise him that I had ordered it the week before. He didn&#39;t care and he sounded rude. They always put you on hold when you call to place an order. I&#39;m always tossed around and have to repeat my order. Their pizzas are just ok. I think this place is lucky they don&#39;t have a lot of competition in the area and that&#39;s probably why they get away with crappy service.

I purchased two pounds of beef and a loaf of bread in a pinch today. It was for my daughters 16th birthday and time got away from me and I thought this would solve my problem. Boy was I wrong.

Major disappointment. The meat was horrible and I don&#39;t think the way they packaged it was correct, The bread was stale and they only gave me 1 1/2 cups of au jus.

I have been eating the food from here for years.....since the days when they were in EP. I have to say I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the product.

I went in there once and got the special where you get 2 slices of pizza and a drink for $6. The pizza was actually really good so another day I came back and wanted to order a whole pizza to take home. So I get home with the pizza and it turns out it&#39;s not even the same thing. The pizza you get by the slice is New York style, the slices are large and the crust is thin and soft so you can fold it in half. The pizza you get if you order a whole pizza is cut up into squares and the crust is really crunchy and gross, it&#39;s like a saltine cracker with pizza toppings on it. The cheese and everything else on it was totally different too. The menu has SO many things on it that you can&#39;t even figure out what to order, it&#39;s a little ridiculous...there&#39;s like 30 different options just for pizza. Thin crust, old world, by the slice, deep dish...why do they need to have so many different types of the same thing? It&#39;s an italian pizza place that also has hamburgers, chicken fingers, hot dogs, rib tips, chicken, etc. Why can&#39;t they just concentrate on making a couple things really well instead of making 10 billion different things that aren&#39;t that great?  I could read War and Peace in it&#39;s entirety faster than I could read through this menu. The service is also terrible but I feel like there&#39;s not point even talking about that since pretty much every review here mentions the awful service and this place clearly doesn&#39;t care.

There was something fundamentally wrong with it, it left this weird sour after taste in my mouth after a bite.  My order also included a polish sausage and an Italian beef.  The polish sausage came in a hoagie/french bread, way too much bread! Rather than the grilled onion that are advertised on their sign, it came with raw diced onion and tomatoes.  The Italian beef was the most horrible item of all.  It was sour, stale, worst Italian beef I&#39;ve ever had.  I am pretty sure the beef had already gone bad.

The food is good depending on what you order. Thin crust pizza is decent, the hamburgers are tasty and you can get a good Chicago dog, fries leave much to be desired.They are like the crinkle cut fries you buy in the frozen food section at the grocery store. Po Boys are excellent but the bread is a bit chewy, so only buy if you got a good set of teeth. You just have to kind of bite and pull each bite but its tasty. Do not go there for the ribs, they are not smoked ribs. They are something they microwaved and slathered BBQ sauce on. Service is decent, I have been in there a couple of times, all young people that can sometimes forget they are at work in what they talk about in front of you as you wait at the counter.

Tonight, however, we almost walked out when the girl at the counter was too busy doing everything except waiting on customers. In hindsight, we should have walked when we had the chance...it would have been better than the half cooked burgers they served us. They did replace the burgers with fully cooked ones when we pointed out how red they were in the middle, but it took a good 20 minutes to get the new ones. 

All in all, a less than stellar experience. If we give Rick any more business, it will be for pizza delivery, so we don&#39;t have to put up with the incompetent staff in the store"

The deep dish pizza is indeed the most appalling thing on the menu.  We ordered it when they first, first opened and it was really good.  Then the stupid owner decided he wanted to save money on cheese and instead told everyone to pour tons of sauce on it, yuck!  A deep dish is supposed to have a light spead or moderate spread of chunky tomato sauce, not a heeping mess of slop!  
The thin crust pizza is edible and that is it.  The beef sandwiches is horrible!  Dry, long in length instead of width, unseasoned crap!  
The mushrooms are not bad.
I am trashing on this place due to Pizza and beef, but pizza is their supposed specialty!  Ugh, crap!  Maybe if they dipped their beefs in as much juice as they dip their nasty deep dishes in sauce, maybe the beef would be OK.  Do not order the deep dish or else you will drown in all the extra sauce.  Do not get the beef or you will need to wash every bite down with water, and the piece of crap is tastless anyway."

My brother invited me and a friend to lunch at Fat Ricky&#39;s because it was close to his workplace. Being away from my hometown for a long time, I was craving good Chicago style food and was thrilled to find it here. My friend Terrie ordered the Massimo sub, my brother Fred had the Italian sausage, and I had the Italian beef. My friend and I shared our sandwiches so that we both had half of each. The Italian beef was so tender it practically melted in my mouth! The Massimo sub&#39;s flavors were absolutely delicious! My brother enjoyed his sandwich too. The food was excellent! However, I can only give it a 4 star rating because the service needs improvement. The counter clerk was so busy taking orders at the drive through window that I was ignored for over 10 minutes. I gave up and just sat down. Later my brother placed our order at the counter. I&#39;m not sure if it was just a bad time or not enough staff. There were only about 2 other tables occupied at the time while there did seem to be a steady flow of vehicles at the drive through window. As a recommendation, I would suggest table service instead of counter service.  The tasty food made it all worthwhile and I will go again whenever I return to the area."

The majority of their orders are pick-up or delivery. There isn&#39;t much space to dine-in unless you&#39;re by yourself and want to down a quick slice at one of their small tables.

Since my first visit, I&#39;ve been hooked. The crust has such a fresh genuine taste to it and is perfectly crispy. The cheese is high quality and melted to stringy perfection with every bite. Toppings are tucked in between the cheese and the tomato sauce which is how it should be. Ingredients are always as fresh as can be and you certainly notice after just one bite.

I can&#39;t go back to eating pizza anywhere else in the area. This is hands down the best pizza you can get in the west suburbs. The only reason I&#39;m not giving 5 stars is because dining-in isn&#39;t an option. I would love to see Cassano&#39;s expand someday, to a full blown restaurant pizzeria."

On another occasion, I ordered my pizza what I thought was regular dough, but found out was thin crust.  I have a new favorite pizza place!!!  (sorry long time fav place).

We started off with the sushi tacos. Yum yum yum! There were only 4 mini tacos on the plate, we were hoping there&#39;d be a little more, but let me tell you; whoever came up with this concept is a genius! These were so crunchy and had a little kick with jalapeños on top. 
Next we had the sushi pizza. WOW. This is a must try if you visit. Absolutely delicious. 
We had the sumo roll, the philly roll, and the Boston roll. The fish tasted really fresh and the rolls were a decent size. 

We also had the fishbowl. Our waitress recommended it but said we should split it since one fishbowl would knock one person on their ass. The fishbowl was HUGE and sooooo good!

I would highly recommend OTOBO"

I have been introducing Bryan A. to sushi and figured a 40% off sushi night (Tuesday&#39;s) with friends was the perfect way to do it!  We started off with edamame and gyoza both were delicious. 
I also tried the peach sake which I really liked (this surprised me since sake usually isn&#39;t my thing). I also tried the hot strawberry sake. I ended up putting ice in it because I liked it better cold. 

We ordered the sweet potato tempura, Chicago Fire and Avalanche. It took about 20-30 minutes to get the first roll and an hour to get the other two. The avalanche was pretty good but I couldn&#39;t taste or see any of the eel that was supposed to be in it. I would have been disappointed if I paid full price for it. The Chicago Fire was pretty good. I didn&#39;t like the sweet potato tempura roll.  It didn&#39;t really taste like much since it was mostly rice and seaweed. I also sampled ceviche and the Mini me roll. I liked the ceviche. I did not like the mini me roll. The octopus was tender but I wasn&#39;t a fan of the flavor. Overall, the rolls were on the smaller side and the service was subpar. Our waitress was inattentive and it was hard to flag her down. I wanted to order a drink, but gave up on the idea after a while. She also brought us the wrong roll and tried to tell us it was what we ordered when we corrected her."

The staff was lovely and worked hard to ensure all our needs were met- and we were a decently large crew! We started out with edamame and gyoza, both of which were delicious. The edamame was steamed and salted perfectly, and the gyoza filling was tasty.

My husband and I split several rolls of sushi (40% off on Tuesdays!), which were decent and didn&#39;t take long to arrive. My personal test for a really great sushi restaurant is how they prepare the spicy tuna. I&#39;m always searching for the place that puts in beautiful cuts of raw tuna, not a mish mash of tuna-in-a-can shreds mixed with sauce. Sadly, Otobo falls in the latter category, but was pretty tasty none the less. 

We had various cocktails, but the plum martinis was delish. The restaurant also has a nice variety of hot and cold sake, as well as a list of wines- if that&#39;s your jam.

It was a lovely evening out and we would definitely come again."

The sign outside isn&#39;t very grand or carry a wow factor by any means. When you walk in through the front door, you are greeted by a beautiful wave mural to your right ( recently painted), and as you walk in, you will find an open space dining room/sushi bar. The decor is very minimalistic, but you will find little art gems in the restaurant. For example, there is a shamisen (Japanese guitar) tucked away in the corner of the sushi bar, geta (Japanese wooden flip flops) on the wall heading towards the restroom, and a  kazaridaru( decorative sake barrel). In the far left corner, there is a semi private dining area, which has an adorable anime style mural. 

I honestly would not have even known about this place if it wasn&#39;t for the upcoming Yelp event that is being hosted here. When I saw that it it had a ramen dish here, I knew I had to come pay this place a visit. A little bonus, when you check in on Yelp, you get a free Tokyo gyoza. It comes with six pieces and a vinegar mix with soy sauce for dipping. It is delicious. My Tantan Ramen was tasty. It was a spicy and hearty broth, that starts off as mild and acclimates to a slow constant burn. The description on the menu noted &#34;braised pork&#34;, I was expecting a chunk of meat, but instead, there were little crumbly pieces that sunk to the bottom of my bowl. It was a generous portion of meat, but note that it is not like charisu, where it is slices, but more in the form of ground pork because traditionally &#34;dan dan noodles are Sichuan noodle dish with spicy, red chili oil soup, ground pork, preserved vegetables and green onions&#34;.

The handcrafted cocktail, Blue wolf was absolutely refreshing. I mean, at $6 it was very reasonably priced.  In terms of sushi,  I wish we had gone on Tuesdays because it&#39;s 40% off sushi. I also wish I had read the reviews about their spiciness because I would have told Chef Bobby to make my Panther roll( spicy tuna with cilantro, topped with tobiko) the way it was meant to be made and not take into the consideration of the reviews on Yelp that it was too spicy. My Panther roll didn&#39;t have the spicy tuna kick that I was craving. Chef Bobby will need to work and find the right balance of spiciness in the sushi. The tuna sashimi was super fresh, had the melt in your mouth texture, and was reasonably priced. We also ordered smoked salmon nigiri, which I thought was amazing. Every had a really nicely smoked salmon where it is salty and smokey? I thought it was right on point, but my companions complained it was too salty. They don&#39;t know how to appreciate a good smoked salmon. Speaking of salt. The lightly salted edamame that was advertised on the menu came heavily salted. 

Overall experience, I am excited with this new addition to Bolingbrook. The prices are reasonable, the sushi is fresh and tasty, tan tan ramen is hearty, and it&#39;s in a small secluded location and is open til 10pm. The service is friendly and fast, and our server ( George) was very handsome. This place will definitely up the competition on Ko Sushi, Sushi Train, and Tamari."

The tuna, avocado, jalapeno and touch of cilantro stuffed into a fried wonton taco shell made for the perfect combination of creaminess and crunch.  The tuna roll had a nice bit of heat but the salmon roll lacked heat which was disappointing.  Neither of us cared for the crispy sweet potato crunch that topped both rolls.

Not wanting to pass on quite a deal, we were all onboard with this. I went with a large group of Yelpers. Mind you, we were all paying, but received service as if we went for free (as if that&#39;s a thing). There were no introductions nor did the waitresses talk to us about the restaurant. Even at non-events, waitresses/waiters usually ask if I&#39;ve been there before and if not, will explain their restaurant and/or menu.

The food was good. Thanks to the pricing, I ended up enjoying 2 rolls (crunchy and symphony) which came to a total of $13. Not bad. I tried the peach sake as well which was good, even though I&#39;m not a super fan of peach. Once we ordered, the waitress pretty much disappeared. I received my rolls probably 25 minutes later. Of the four of us at the table, two of us received our rolls at the same time. On a guess, I would say their rolls (for the other 2, and half of the order for the third person) came out an hour later, maybe a little longer. No explanations, no apologies, just a very long wait time. I guess no explanation is needed, because there were only 2 sushi chefs. The group we were with was probably 25 although there were 50-60 RSVP&#39;d. It&#39;s good that only a fraction arrived, I would hate to think of the wait times with more people. They should have prepared for a larger crowd. Yelpers are eager to give good reviews, and I hate giving bad ones (though it happens). 

Crunchy roll was good. Symphony roll was good though was lacking in mango. Based on ingredients, they could call the symphony roll the &#34;cilantro and salmon roll&#34;. Gyoza was delicious as well. Despite the check in offer for a free order of gyoza, they ended up just bringing one plate of gyoza per 4-5 people. Bummer. 

They are lacking in vegetarian options. One of my friends is a vegetarian and they just had sweet potato tempura and one other vegetarian option. Seems like something they should expand upon. 

Food was good, but there are good sushi places with excellent service closer to my house."

Love coming to dine in on Tuesdays for the 40% off sushi. It can get busy but it is worth the wait! Especially with all their creative sushi rolls that I havent seen elsewhere. Such as the sushi tacos. Yum. Def coming back when in town!
otobo-sushi-and-bar-bolingbrook,Bryan A.,mRj01KDqXwHuqMxu-bec4g,"Bloomingdale, IL",1,1,1,40,20,WKb3LdtYIoq187ft8b1dRQ,2.0,2016-03-25,"As I&#39;ve stated in previous posts, Taylor M. has made my introduction to Asian cuisine an ongoing pet project.  So, naturally, when we saw that Tuesday&#39;s was forty percent off sushi night at Otobo, we had to go.  In addition to being a newbie to sushi, I&#39;m also  a novice in the alcohol department (very sheltered, I know).  However, I did try a white wine and some peach and strawberry sakes.  The wine was pretty dry and bitter, but the sake was excellent.
     We ordered three rolls, the avalanche, the sweet potato tempura and the Chicago fire.  It took a long time to get our food, at least thirty minutes for our first roll, and over an hour for our second and third.  We got the avalanche first, and it was pretty good.  I was told by several other more practiced sushi aficionados that the eel was absent.  I personally can&#39;t comment on this, because I&#39;ve never actually had eel.  The Chicago fire and the sweet potato were both brought out at the same time.  I didn&#39;t mind the Chicago fire, but I had little interest in the sweet potato after the first bite.  It was very blah, and didn&#39;t have much taste.  
     Now, for the service.  Unfortunately, our waitress seemed very off her game.  After we had our first roll, she brought out a second, that was not what we had ordered.  She then attempted to argue with us that we had ordered that roll.  Second, we tried, in vain, to attempt to flag her down in order to place a drink order.  I really wanted to try the blue wolf!  Unfortunately, she was apparently unaware of us, and my thirst went unquenched :(  Sure, they were busy, and it&#39;s possible that they she was a little overwhelmed.  But when you have a 40% off sushi night, you should probably prepare for a pretty big crowd!  It seemed as though Otobo had some pretty good food, and some pretty good drinks.  But even with my limited experience, I can tell you that there are plenty of better options for sushi out there, especially given the sub par service."
otobo-sushi-and-bar-bolingbrook,MJ S.,Szh5mNLYj_JlRVejaYVvlg,"Bolingbrook, IL",0,1,1,7,6,ta5IoJNWQzUHDaSKw_lHxA,5.0,2016-03-15,"We&#39;ve been passing 111th and Weber and kept seeing this place. It is in a strip mall and so easy to miss. So I looked it up in Yelp and saw excellent reviews. Without a doubt, they were right. Ambience was cozy, well lit but not too bright. Not too loud either so you can still have great conversation.

Food was fresh and tasty. We had Godzilla and was very delicious. Shrimp on it was fresh and still warm. Spicy tuna was excellent with a little spicy mayo made it perfect. Avalanche roll was prepared a little longer but worth the wait. Eel sushi just had enough rice that made it melt in your mouth.

Our server was awesome, I think her name is kassie as stated on the receipt. She also gave us a little water pitcher that made it efficient that we didn&#39;t have to keep asking for water refill.

5 stars would be appropriate as we didn&#39;t mind waiting. For others, it might be an issue since there is a little bit of wait for our food when we were there.  Maybe bec the place was a little busy due to 40% off Tuesdays on signature rolls.  If you&#39;re in a hurry, you might want to consider calling in your order ( if they take it ).  Otherwise, this is a place to be if you are in the area for good Japanese food."

(They weren&#39;t that busy.. they were understaffed and one large party was taking up two servers&#39; time, making them forget the rest of their tables.)  

Service aside, it doesn&#39;t answer for my hot food coming out cold because it was obviously cooked too soon, then waited until my wife&#39;s tempura was ready. Then they served both, so mine was cold already by the time we got it.

Gave me the wrong sushi roll... I waited for the correct one while encouraging my wife to eat her tempura &#34;vegetables&#34; while they were hot. (Vegetables? One THICK onion ring and about 3 other &#34;pieces&#34; of other vegetables. Who serves an onion ring - those are for steakhouses!) 

Have had MUCH better at Aodake, KO Sushi, abd Sushi Train.

The bill came and the wrong roll (which was twice a much as the correct one) was still on our bill, so we had to deal with that (another longer than neccessary wait making our exit take longer than usual, too.

All in all, a very regrettable first time experience. If this is how bad it was on a Friday, I couldn&#39;t even imagine going on a Tuesday with their special... especially when others have already commented on the slow service then, as well.

C&#39;mon, OTOBO... we&#39;d love for you to be successful, but you seem to have a LOT of foresight and work ahead of you."

The crunchy was along the lines of the type we usually order and were of high quality and prepared beautifully.  The other 2 were slightly different the what we normally would order but we really enjoyed them.  All though the visit we were treated very well by the server.

The decor was very nice and and the music was awesome. We ordered gyoza, California, Godzilla, Spider? (I think that was the name. Whichever has the soft shell crab) and the Spicy Crab Rolls. The gyoza came pretty quickly, but the rolls took a while. I don&#39;t mind having a lengthier eating experience and sitting and talking with whomever I&#39;m with, but if you&#39;re in a rush, this will probably frustrate you.

It was a good decision.  Started our meal with a free order of Shrimp Shumai (thanks to an offer on yelp) and went into California Roll, the Sumo Roll and the Arashi Roll.  All the rolls were good.  The Wasabi was a bit weaker then we normally like and you will spend some money here (like any sushi place I suppose).  Service was really good, place was clean and nice.  Bathrooms clean.  Only disappointment was the spicy creature Roll.  Server indicated it would be the spiciest.  Would give it a 3 on a scale of 10 spicy wise.  Overall a good experience."

Now I just ordered some things for takeout, but the restaurant had a nice ambiance, nice looking bar, and very clean and friendly service. The Gyoza, which I always try - was very good. The kids liked it better than at KO Sushi or Tamari Sushi. Miso soup was very good! Yakisoba, which is also my fav non-sushi food, had very fresh ingredients, not drowning in sauce. My one suggestion to the restaurant though is to lighten up on the hot spice. I do love spicy food, but it was at the level where i lost all sensation on my tongue. Second suggestion - the presentation of the food was so nice! Until...the spork in the takeout bag. Cannot eat soup nor yakisoba with a spork. Please do not ever use sporks in your takeout bags.

Had to ask for my water to be refilled, a carafe for the table was given which I liked. Edamame came 5 minutes after sushi was on the table with an apology, we said it was too late and sent it back.  2nd round of drinks ordered, Sapporro on tap no longer an option, so I ordered a bottle of Kirin. It was served with a warm glass so I swapped glasses with my water glass which was cold.   They did take the edamame off the bill.  Overall experience was average, food was decent, service was poor.  I am not sure I will go back, but I may give it a 2nd chance.  Groupon made it a 50 night with a moderate tip...pretty reasonable."

That&#39;s what you get when visiting Benny&#39;s. The coffee is delicious here and it&#39;s one of the few breakfast places where I will actually have at least 3 cups because it is so good. The decor feels very homey and the menu is very extensive so you are sure to find something that you will like. Also they offer gluten free pancakes which are delicious.

I&#39;ve eaten at Benny&#39;s Place 3 or 4 times over the past 2 years and only because there nothing else close is the only reason I have gone back.  

The servers are great and and the decor is fine but the food is TERRIBLE.  

I spoke to a lady behind the counter there the other day decrying the quality of the food and telling her that she should go to Buttermilk or  Egg Harbor in Geneva and try to emulate what they offer.  Her response was that she liked her food just fine, I did point out that it was 9:00 am in the morning and the place was empty.  She might want to reconsider my advice."

We went on a Sunday around noon and did not have to wait for a table. Our server was polite and prompt and we all got coffees &amp; Bloody Mary&#39;s. The Bloody Mary&#39;s were delicious and we all ordered a mix of breakfast and lunch meals. They even had Nutella crepes on their menu!

I have only ever been here for breakfast but what started with a Groupon has become ritual.  As an architect, I love the visual presentation of the food which is almost as good as the taste of said food.  The large portions don&#39;t hurt either.  As a guy with broader than average shoulders the generous spacing of tables and chairs is a much welcomed change from most restaurants.  I can enjoy their offerings without feeling like a caged bull.

There is so much I still want to try here that I am hoping Benny&#39;s is around for years to come.  I might even get here for lunch or dinner one day in the near future."

Build your own skillet has cubed style potatoes. Ham was sliced very thin and watch out for upselling. If I knew the gravy was a buck more on the side biscuit, I probably would have still tried it, but since I didn&#39;t enjoy either, I brought it to her attention. They took the charge off my bill. The biscuits are a bit strange, too soft and their gravy isn&#39;t to my liking. 

Server was very attentive and I could see a return visit, if in the area. Real close to a 4 star, but not having awesome biscuits &amp; gravy is always a buzz kill."

The room was nice.. not cozy but OK and the bathroom clean. (Had the grandson with us and he managed to get &#34;sticky&#34; with syrup more than once)

Like the Papanicholas coffee, I would prefer if they used one of their more flavorful blends..

I had the Cinnamon Roll French Toast Combo. No big surprise as I&#39;ve had this at three different local places. This one was better than Egg Harbor and not as good as Egg&#39;lectic (which I crave) I forgot to order hash browns.. I must be losing my touch. I ate everything and was looking for more.. when Lisa offered me a bite of her potatoes!

Lisa had the Bacon and Egg Quesadilla, with a side of Pumpkin Pancakes (sans fruit, ick) It was way too much food for her, so she got a second meal out of the deal. The pumpkin pancakes were pretty good and she really enjoyed the quesadilla. Potatoes were ok, they come with a dollop of sour cream on top... but don&#39;t think for a second that makes &#39;em fancy!

I rarely write reviews on here, but felt compelled as soon as I left to write this. The servers are also great, very friendly and attentive without being pushy.

Update: We ended up leaving without having our meals because it was still going to be another 10 minutes--even though several groups seated after us already had their meals. We canceled our order and asked for our check. The server came back and I told her we weren&#39;t going to pay for meals that weren&#39;t even made, so she adjusted the check. When asked by the cashier how we were, we explained this is the only time we&#39;ve ever been to a restaurant and are walking out without having eaten. Marc asked me if I wanted to talk to the manager, and I responded, &#34;It doesn&#39;t even matter since we&#39;re never coming back again.&#34; The cashier merely shrugged her shoulders and let us walk out angry.

It&#39;s a nice, tastefully decorated breakfast spot in the corner of a strip mall.  We walked in about 9:30, 10:00 and  we were seated immediately.  While the place was very crowded, it really wasn&#39;t all that loud.  A waiter stopped by about 30 seconds after we sat down to take our drink orders &amp; provide menus.  

The menu was fairly big with alot of different breakfast &amp; lunch options that were slightly different than other places but in a good,&#34; hmmm that&#39;s different &amp; sounds really good&#34; way.  Having taken 10 minutes to peruse all the options &amp; narrowing our options down to a select 2 or 3, Kelly ordered pumpkin pancakes while I had ordered the cinnamon roll french toast combo with sausage &amp; scrambled eggs.  

We didn&#39;t have to wait long for our food, maybe 15-20 minutes but time flew by.  Kelly jumped right into her pumpkin pancakes &amp; loved them.  I believe &#34;best pumpkin pancakes ever&#34; may have been uttered. Suffice to say, the facial expressions she had while eating them were priceless.  I was somewhat jealous (&amp; I don&#39;t get too jealous from a vegetable based, flour oriented breakfast option often)  as sometimes even I don&#39;t get those type of reactions from her.     

My cinnamon roll french toast came out.  It appeared to be 2 Texas Toast with cinnamon swirls served French toast style with a top half of an iced cinnamon roll resting on top of them.   The french toast was very good, but  the cinnamon roll on top made it especially good.  I actually would&#39;ve enjoyed it more had it been all iced cinnamon roll instead of texas cinnamon swirl toast but perhaps that will happen some day.  The scrambled eggs were very good as were the big breakfast sausage links, though I&#39;d have liked them to be a bit hotter.

Service was good, but could&#39;ve been a bit better in our opinion.  We had to ask for silverware and stop our waiter for refills.  

All in all, an enjoyable experience.  We&#39;re fans &amp; will be back again!"

First time I came here if was maybe hag empty at best and it took about 10 minutes to be greeted, although our server had walked by our table and looked at us a few times prior to coming over. She then proceeded to greet a table that got day after we did so that was kind of annoying. Food is okay, nothing amazing, but I think the price for what it is is okay.i did end up comin here again and got much better service but food was will pretty average.

A party that arrived after us was seated before us even though we had reservations.

The scrambled eggs were bland and not cooked through as was the cinnamon roll french toast.

There was only glaze on 1 of 3 pieces of french toast. It took 10 minutes to even flag down a staff member to get more glaze or syrup. 

I was looking forward to ordering the freshly squeezed orange juice mentioned by others on yelp but was told they only had from concentrate.

This was unfamiliar territory as we parked the bikes on the south building exposure, soon to realize that we needed to hike to the north exposure if we actually wanted to enter the building! (South Doors Locked...Benny&#39;s Rule)

We chose to sit at the counters north end...&#34;Diner Style&#34;, soon to realize that we needed to hike to the southern end if we actually wanted too see into the kitchen. You need to strategically seat yourself if you prefer a glimpse of the action. I&#39;ll take that option anytime. Our waitress just smiled as she handed us the Benny&#39;s Place Breakfast Encyclopedia. This is not a Menu, but a list of eternal options that never end! Huge.

Long story short, Benny&#39;s is your typical Breakfast place that will focus on a visual color contrast food presentation of huge portions, and better yet, reasonably priced.

This is where Benny&#39;s is Magical! They will dazzle with footwork and hope to hell you feel you got your moneys worth, and taste is just an option!

We went here for Mothers Day breakfast, and we timed it very well.  We got seated immediately, and the waitress stopped by to check on drinks quickly.   The place was just about packed except for 2 big tables, which were reserved for a large group that showed up a bit later. By the time we left, there were twice as many cars in the lot, and several people were waiting to be seated. 

They were well staffed for the crowd, and service was friendly and very good, except for the end, when we had to wait a long time for our check. The waitress thought she&#39;d brought it, but had forgotten it. I&#39;ll forgive that, as things like that are going to happen on a crazy day like this. My wife could have had her coffee checked on a little more often, but again, we&#39;re more than willing to give them the benefit of the doubt on this minor issue.

This place is within walking distance of our house, but it&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve been here. We were never impressed with the previous restaurants in the space, so we&#39;re glad to see a good one here now. 

I ordered one of the specials- the fajita omelette. It was huge, and came with hash browns and a choice of biscuits, pancakes, or toast.  The omelette was not visually appealing, but it was appealing to me, because it looked just like something I&#39;d make at home and think, &#34;I love this, but it doesn&#39;t look good enough to be served to other people&#34;. Maybe I&#39;ve been too hard on myself. Anyway, it was good, but not great. I asked for jalapeños with it, and that was a good idea, but it needed something more to make it great. Maybe a little sour cream, I dunno.   

My wife ordered the cinnamon roll French toast, and said it was perfect - just what she was craving.  She also got a Bloody Mary, which was just a little spicy for her. 

The decor here is nice, and our booth was comfortable. The food arrived quickly, especially considering the crowd on this special day. As I mentioned, there were a couple of minor issues, but they are forgivable. 

They gave my wife a pretty rose with a very nice coupon at checkout, so that ended our experience on a positive note. This was not a cheap meal, but the value is good, with quality food and big portions. We&#39;re looking forward to visiting again very soon."

I always want a balance of savory/protein and sweet, and Benny&#39;s offers many combinations as well as accommodates custom requests!  Alex was a fantastic server, attentive and helpful; I asked for a version of the Popeye Crepe, substituting chicken sausage (delicious!) for the bacon, and substituting the Pumpkin Spice French Bread for the English muffin.  The crepe was truly amazing: savory and sweet at the same time, light and filling.  I should have checked on the French Bread: it was more of a cake bread than a loaf bread, which I would have preferred, but it was well-made, just a bit too sweet and cakey for my tastes.  The fruit bowl was a bit scarce and anemic, but I don&#39;t know what is available here at this time of year.  Overall, the ambience (lively colors, quality fabric in the booths, spacious and light interior, pleasant music) and food quality mark this as a true FAVORITE.  Wish I lived near here, or could visit more often.  I don&#39;t need TVs visible at all angles and would have preferred not to have the visual distraction, but they were muted.  Power outlets at the booths and free wi-fi, perfect for the business traveler like myself."

I have been to Benny&#39;s about 10 times now and I have to say this is the perfect chill Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner place. 

The food comes in rather large portions and is just done right, nothing fancy or over the top, just decent quality and good tasting. 

Huge omelets stuffed to the gills come with hash browns or an assortment of other sides. 

Now, I love Belgium Waffles, but almost every place I know screws them up! Benny&#39;s are crunchy on the outside, big and fluffy in the middle, Goldilocks would be proud...just right!!!

They also have this great Banana Bread French toast!!!! I feel dumb for never thinking of this before but wow!!! Make sure you get the large size or make it a side with your meal! This is what Awesome tastes like!

Lastly, the owner... You guessed it! Benny! He is what makes me love this place, he is a true small business owner that cares about his baby(the restaurant) with a lot of heart. He is always there, always friendly and makes you feel at home. I feel like I&#39;m rooting for his success just because you can see how much care and work he has put into making this place great!

We came in and were seated promptly by a young lady who didn&#39;t seem to want to be there. We also came in with our one year old daughter and wasn&#39;t even offered a high chair, so I had to take it upon myself to locate one and grab it. 

Once we were seated, I noticed about 7-8 staff loitering around the register, instead of approaching our table and I got to play the awesome guessing game of who is going to be our server. It turns out we won a nice, but clueless older man who is probably related to the owner(s).

Looking at the breakfast menu, I noticed there isn&#39;t a &#34;sides&#34; section (i.e. bacon, sausage, English Muffin). I explained that I wanted the cinnamon roll French toast with a side of sausage links. Turns out, I had to order some breakfast combo, which included eggs and I don&#39;t like eggs. He kindly left the eggs off my order, but I was still charged for the combo. Our waiter barely made trips to our table checking on us and even seemed to forget we were there. 

I will say that the food was above average and was reasonably priced. Far less expensive than Grandma&#39;s Table located down the street, but the service needs an upgrade/major fine tuning. 

I am sure I will be back at some point, but in the meantime, I will stick with the Riverview Diner for my breakfast/family restaurant needs."

I just tried the country fried steak with biscuits and gravy. He serves a generous portion with extremely super fluffy soft biscuits and a creamy gravy that&#39;s neither overly rich nor too salty.

We went at 8:30 on a Sunday morning and the place was nearly dead which didn&#39;t help our first impressions.

However, we were really happy with the food, service, and price.  We all went pretty run-of-the-mill with our orders (omelets, eggs, sausage, skillet, pancakes, etc.)  Everything was hot, cooked right, and tasty.

By the time we were leaving it had gotten a bit busier, but it was still very slow for that time and day of the week.

The good:
The menu now offers more healthy options including vegetarian choices. The eggs were done right. The bacon and sausage are excellent. You also have the option of whether you want onions cooked into your hashbrowns or american fries which is nice.

The bad:
1) The hollandaise sauce is horrible. I have had excellent sauce and even mediocre sauce but this is by far the worst I have ever tasted. It was more like mayonnaise with mustard mixed into it. Unfortunately, most of the items listed in the menu are served with the &#39;hollandaise&#39; sauce. Thank goodness my dish was served with it on the side so that I had the option of not using it and therefore ruining my meal. Please, revise your hollandaise sauce recipe! 
2) What happened to the biscuits? They are spongy. Nothing at all like homemade flaky doughy biscuits. They should not bounce back when you press on them. The biscuits reminded me of the pre-made canned biscuits you would find in the refrigerated section of the store. If I want pre-made/canned food then I will eat at home. If I am going to pay someone else to cook for me then I expect it to be made from scratch.

Conclusion: First impressions are everything and this place is off to a rough start. I will however give it another chance. Your best bet is to stick with the bacon and eggs meal with a side of  pancakes."

Nevertheless, my daughter had the Greek Salad (4 star), my son had the BBQ Bacon Cheddar Burger (4 star), and I had the Swiss Mountain Burger (4.5 star). In addition, we each got a cup of soup; either chicken noodle (4 star) or Cheddar Broccoli (5 star). The service was excellent; very attentive and quick to please their guests. Food was served in a reasonable time. The ambiance was quaint, yet informal, yet deceivingly romantic (if that&#39;s ur thing). Truthfully, not a single complaint.

The best part is....they are kind to our kids!! The first time we went in one of the TV&#39;s was on PBS so my son has asked during our subsequent times to watch something. They have always made that possible. But the thing that tops that are the Mickey Mouse pancakes and fresh fruit. He LOVES them!! This last time he asked for no pineapple to the waitress as she walked away. I said we would pick it out but when it came...no pineapple! In addition, my pancake side that I had mentioned I was giving to my daughter also came in a Mickey Mouse shape so she wouldn&#39;t feel left out. Now that is considerate!!

We always have the same great service! The same waitress actually.  Which now is probably good as my son would wonder where she is if she&#39;s not there.  I hope they stick around for a long time as we consider this a neighborhood gem!! 

FYI: they started serving dinner yesterday! Another smart business decision to help make them more lucrative!

Great job!!"

Have tried this place twice and both times were a disaster. Food is nothing but mediocre. Cinnamon roll my son ordered was clearly from a  frozen food supplier. Biscuits were gross, gravy was definitely not homemade, thick, pasty, and flavorless. Pancakes were not even hot enough to melt the butter. &#34;Handcrafted&#34; cocktails? Give me a break!  How do you handcraft a mimosa?  By pouring frozen orange juice over a couple ounces of cheap champagne? &#34;Handcrafted&#34;!  What a joke!  Each time we have been seated by a diminutive hostess who looks like she has been sipping on vinegar her whole life. What a miserable person. The server both times was the same dropout from personality school who speaks to her customers in the an annoying  baby voice one would use when talking to an infant in a crib. She was slow, messed up the order, never refilled our soft drinks but remembered to draw a big smiley face thank you on the bill. &#34;Benny&#34; collects the money at the register but doesn&#39;t have enough sense to say thank you and please come again. The guy is clueless and has as much personality as the mopes he hires. Save your money and come back for their going out of business sale. They will go the same way Biscuits went before them and good riddance!"

I approached with caution as all prior establishments were for the most part a complete train wreck. First off the service even though it was busy was good and the food came out very quickly. I had the Banana Bread French Toast + Eggs/Bacon Combo and it was amazing. Possibly the best BB French Toast I&#39;ve had. The eggs (scrambled) were cooked perfectly not too dry as often occurs. The bacon was also cooked perfectly but was just passable in terms of flavor. They could source better bacon and it would go a long way. My son had the Denver Omlette also cooked perfectly. Biscuits &amp; Gravy had good biscuits but the sausage gravy was just okay nothing special. Pancakes were excellent. Coffee was weak which seems to be the case at most breakfast places. Please make stronger coffee this isn&#39;t 1958. They also take Belly memberships here. I&#39;ll be back for sure.

After 6-8 lunches and breakfasts there, I have to say I was never disappointed with the quality of the food and the friendliness of the staff.

It&#39;s definitely worth seeking out, though!

I don&#39;t like deep-dish Chicago pizza (so sue me), but Aurelio&#39;s does a nice thin crust, with a sauce that&#39;s slightly sweet and offsets the spice of pepperoni nicely. 

We also indulged in a deep-dish cookie for dessert: a bit hard around the edges of the pan, but it softened up with some ice cream melted on top :)

Service was perfunctory but got the job done. 

The place is divided by a wall, and whether by accident or design the people who were whooping it up were on the other side, while we (and less strident diners like us) were on the opposite side. Works for me!

The place was a bit fancier looking than I would have expected, with dim lights and a cascade of glass bubbles suspended from the ceiling (though they did stick with the pizzeria formula by having checkered tablecloths).

Overall, a satisfying pizza experience in Naperville."

I was fortunate enough to live in Homewood for 20 years because that is where you will find true original Aurelio&#39;s pizza. Sadly you will not find it in Naperville. This franchise is no better than a grocery store pizza. Aurelio&#39;s is all about the sauce. My last two pizza&#39;s barely had any sauce.  certainly not a gourmet pizza. I see other reviewers share my sentiment. If the owners want to salvage their business they should take a ride to Homewood and remind themselves how quality Aurelio&#39;s pizza is made. Seriously considering contacting corporate office. Joe would roll over is his grave.

So fortunately, or unfortunately, my brother and I had to make a decision on an alternative pizza place. We narrowed it down to a few spots in the Aurora/Naperville area, but in the end, we decided on Aurelio&#39;s.

I had not had Aurelio&#39;s in about 8 years. I know they are a franchise, but they aren&#39;t your cookie cutter, on every other block, mass produced franchise. I grew up in Wheaton and there weren&#39;t too many of them in the area. From what I remembered, they had a very distinct and sweet sauce.

I&#39;m a huge knife and fork pizza guy. We decided to order their large stuffed pizza. It looked really good on the website, so we went with it.

The total was 27.04. A little pricey, but I have no problem paying 13 dollars for a meal. It was ready in 30 minutes, too.

I was pleasantly surprised by the pizza. The sauce was the best part; the franchise must all use a similar sauce because I had deja vu from 8 years ago (I had the thin crust back then but the sauce was a spot on match!). The crust was chewy as opposed to crunchy, which is how stuffed pizza should be (deep dish is more of a crunch for you pizza novices).

Overall, I was impressed. I usually order thin crust from places I&#39;m unfamiliar with, but we took a leap of faith, and were rewarded! 

I would order again, no doubt. Dining in might be a cool option in the future, too. The dining room had a few parties in it, and it had a nice vibe to it. Recommended!"

My work orders from the Aurelio&#39;s in oakbrook and it&#39;s amazing. When my family came over for dinner, I was ready to blow their minds with Delicious Aurelio&#39;s pizza but unfortunately, I got them to hate the franchise now. The pizza at this Naperville
Location is nowhere as tasty as the one in oakbrook. My family said Pizza Hut/rosaries/little Caesars/Costco pizza was even better than this. I completely agreed.  The cheese sticks tasted just like ones a that come out of the freezer and are heated up.

Good thing we ordered an appetizer (bostco sticks - soft breadsticks stuffed with mozzarella cheese served plain or with garlic seasoning) or we would have been starving.

I came here with the fam on a Saturday around 6:30. There were 7 of us and boy were we hungry after sitting through a a 3 1/2 hour movie down the street at Showplace. For a Saturday night, the restaurant was pretty dead which was surprising. It worked out well for us though because we got a large table right away and service was quick!

We started with an order of toasted ravioli which came with sweet marinara dipping sauce. The cheese was super gooey and it was a delicious little app. Next up we had to make a decision on pizza for all of us (easier said than done). 

We were workin with a lot of different taste buds, so luckily we were able to split the pizzas in half as far as toppings go. We had cheese &amp; onion, pepperoni, spinach and onion, and sausage and mushroom. I thought all of them were really good except for the sausage and mushroom pizza. It wasn&#39;t the mushrooms that were the issue, it was the sausage. Something just wasn&#39;t right. The meat was a little rubbery tasting to me.

They have a few different types of crust to choose from which is nice. After watching some of their pizzas come out to other tables my family decided on thin crust. Thin crust to me is like super super thin and crispy and it&#39;s not my fave. However, Aurelio&#39;s thin crust in my opinion, is like a regular crust should be. Their thick crust is a lot of dough, as is the stuffed crust. If you want a happy level of carbs I suggest the thin crust. I think the main factor that sets Aurelio&#39;s a part from other pizza joints is their sauce. It&#39;s different and sweet and I&#39;m a fan.

They had some pretty decent beers on tap. I enjoyed a Two Brothers Wobble and my mom had a Stella. I glanced at their wine list which wasn&#39;t half bad either.

All in all, not the best pizza place I&#39;ve ever been to, but it&#39;s A-Okay in my book!"

We ordered about 730 PM on a Sunday night. Guy took the particulars over the phone. Decided on the 15 inch stuffed. You must understand something about two 20 somethings who eat nutritious food 6/7 days a week. This is the one meal where we go at it. While &#34;normal&#34; people could probably be full with a slice of two of this stuffed behemoth, my brother and I were satisfied with the size. But we wish it was thicker!!!

Since we are moving out of the area, maybe we will try another location in Geneva (since I&#39;ve had this twice). Aurelio&#39;s is known for their AWESOME SAUCE (pun intended). I love how it is so sweet.

The pizza wasn&#39;t bad though the sauce was a bit sweet for my taste but that didn&#39;t make it horrible. I gave only 2 stars because of this... My fiancée dies not care for pizza but I talked him into trying this place because we had company over plus a $20 gift certificate (which was a very generous welcome to the neighborhood gesture from the franchise). He loves salad so said ok we can go I&#39;ll have salad. I ordered a family salad for 4. We ordered Italian dressing for my fiancée and ranch for the rest of us. The Italian dressing was the worst thing we&#39;ve ever tasted in our lives. It was no where close to tasting or even looking like Italian dressing. To top it off the waitress told the manager how disappointed we were in the dressing and he came over and was very defensive and rude to us asking why exactly we didn&#39;t like it. He didn&#39;t like the criticism. I hope he&#39;s reading this because I&#39;m going to say one thing. My grandparents owned a successful pizza place for over 25 years and my grandma always would say to customers please tell us the truth even if it&#39;s bad because we can&#39;t fix it if we don&#39;t know about it and if we don&#39;t know about it you just will never come back nor will you recommend us to others.

While the pizza is always good, the service was awful. Slow to show up, no refills on drinks, order messed up, no manager appeared or discount to the check. So, we decided it would be a while before we went back 

On 10.23.15 we decided to go back, and give them another shot. Ordered a salad and pizza, along with  kids Sprite, iced tea, and a after. Server was slow to bring drinks, but they came. 

Salad arrived, halfway through that the pizza came. I asked for another iced tea when the pizza came, but I never received that. Our kids were getting fussy, so it was best to pack up and go home. Problem was the server didn&#39;t come back to check in on us, nor did a manager come by. It took a long time to get the check, and a long time to come back with our credit card. 

The food is always great, but the service always stinks out loud. Either they do not have enough wait staff, or the managers sent the wait staff home too soon. Either way, don&#39;t waste the effort of dine-in. Get carry-out, or avoid this location all together."

We ordered a big variety of pizzas (pepperoni, sausage, cheese..etc), but the taco pizza was by far the winner amongst the families. Taco pizza = all of the yummy things you&#39;d find on a taco placed on thin crust pizza- a thin layer of a taco sauce, topped with taco meat, baked with cheese, covered in tomatoes, lettuce, and more shredded cheese.

I will start by saying that in 1983 I began my work experience at Aurelio&#39;s in Indiana. I worked in various positions until 1988. Clearly it was a engrained experience. I still dine at the original location in Homewood and the second in Schererville, In. where I worked. 
The &#34;pie&#34; is different at this location. Unfortunately the crust was disappointing. The other elements of perfect balance, sauce, cheese, and sausage seemed closed enough to resemble the original. 
I was sooooo looking forward to the Aurelio&#39;s experience I so fondly remember. I even turned a friend on to the location that was new to the area. Her opinion was it was &#34;pretty good&#34;. 
Was I totally disappointed? Not completely, but crust is a huge element. Perhaps this location could get an assist for the homemade crust the original locations used to make, from scratch. It really was a wonderful symphony. This crust seemed more like a frozen one. I cannot say I will be back."

It was really good), stuffed sausage (no 45 minute wait for theirs because it doesn&#39;t have the inch of cheese on it, which I do like at places like Giordano&#39;s, but I thought Aurelio&#39;s was really good as well with their own take on stuffed pizza, and it was ready with the other pizzas), and lastly a thin half mushroom / half pepperoni, also delicious with a nicely crispy crust. We also tried two of their salads and really enjoyed them as well. 
We did walk to the dining room and this Aurelios looks really sharp, nice styling, a nice sit-down restaurant that happens to specialize in pizza.

I&#39;m not sure what is wrong with the carryout staff and management but they are the worst in the food service industry. First they ask you to repeat your phone number over and over and if it doesn&#39;t come up in their system they will REFUSE to take your order. The manager (a guy) is a total jerk. If you are lucky enough to get an order placed you will be getting about a 90 minute delivery time. And you will need to repeat your address and credit card number multiple times. They like to blame your phone for the repeated questions however I have called from 3 different numbers (2 land lines) and have gotten the same poor service. 

After placing an order at a different Aurelio&#39;s and telling them about the problems I got &#34;I get so many complaints about that place. The manager is friends with the owners&#34; 

I would avoid this location and find another one. It&#39;s really too bad because the pizza is great.

EDIT: after giving the carry out another chance they seem to have fixed the issues."

Thin crust cheese pizza tasted ok, I&#39;m not really a fan of the cheese blend they use(maybe mozzarella &amp; cheddar?) but worth a try.   The stuffed cheese pizza tasted good, a little different from the usual Chicago-style stuffed, not as thick as most other places.  Decor of this location is more upscale than one might expect for a modestly priced pizza joint.  Overall, taste-wise, their pizzas are not one of my favorites, but still worth an occasional visit for a change of pace."

Pizza is goodish, if you like thin crust. Kind of expensive, so I would mostly go for the beer garden/patio because it is radical! 

In summary, I am glad this place is open because it&#39;s near to where I live and I like the building features. And the name makes me think of areolae."

I have eaten at the new Naperville location 3-4 times since it has been open. Great location, large dining room so there is never too terrible of a wait to get seated, even on weekends.

There was an Aurelio&#39;s where I grew up and it was really good, and after moving to Naperville I saw the good reviews and ratings (best in Naperville?) so we ordered a couple of pizzas.  One was extra cheese, sausage, onions mushrooms.  Lots of cheese, decent amount of onions, average of 1 piece of sausage per piece of pizza (by which I mean that some pieces of pizza had 2 pieces of sausage --none had more than 2--and some pieces of pizza had no sausage), and canned mushrooms.  Seriously, canned mushrooms.  Other pizza was spinach, tomatos and mushrooms, which would have been ok except that it was very salty, it as like they poured salt on the pizza.  I&#39;ve had much better pizza for much lower prices here (I&#39;ve never order papa johns but I bet that&#39;s better at half the price, it couldn&#39;t be any worse)"

I received an email that it had opened (I&#39;m on the email list because I order online from their 75th street location), so we decided to head here for dinner this past Friday night, June 1 (their second weekend in business). 

I gotta say, I wasn&#39;t expecting the inside of an Aurelio&#39;s to look like this. They had the obligatory red-checkered tablecloths, but that&#39;s about where the similarities to a regular pizzeria ended. The space had a very contemporary feeling to it. Blown-glass decorations hanging from the ceiling, some really cool cylindrical glass fireplace (fire tube, maybe?) with a 4-foot flame licking up the inside. The place just looks neat. 

For a Friday night, a week after opening, things were running amazingly smooth. Granted, this isn&#39;t the first Aurelio&#39;s ever, so they have some knowledge and experience to build on, but you would never have been able to tell from the service or the quality of the food that this place just opened. The only thing that gives away the newness is how sparkling clean this place is.

The food is Aurelio&#39;s. The sweet sauce, the thin crust, the slightly crispy pepperoni, the crumbled sausage... so good! And if you&#39;ve ever had Aurelio&#39;s delivered and liked it, you are in for a whole new world of Pizza bliss when you actually get to eat it IN an Aurelio&#39;s restaurant. I&#39;ve only ever had it delivered (or by the slice at the Aurelio&#39;s on Downer&#39;s Grove, near the Tivoli), so I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted the Pizza fresh out of the oven. Wow.

So yeah, it&#39;s probably a good thing we live on the opposite side of Naperville from this place, otherwise I could kiss off all those size 34 jeans I&#39;ve bought in the past couple years after giving up my McDonald&#39;s habit."

Me and my husband always order pizza from here for delivery.  We decided to dine in a couple months ago and it was good.  I thought it was weird though that the server told us that the only good things on the entire menu was the pizza or the lasagna.  The pizza is really good, but I don&#39;t think that you should adverstise that if you&#39;re not ordering pizza, then you basically shouldn&#39;t eat here.  

What I did like about it is the server told us that they don&#39;t get very many orders for delivery because there is an Aurelios on 75th street that gets all of the calls.  So if you are looking for delivery you will get your order faster than if you order from the 75th street location.  Overall, if you just want good pizza, order delivery and don&#39;t bother dining in."

I grew up a fan of the pizzeria and was thrilled to learn a new location was popping up close to my house! However, we visited for the first time last Friday and was not impressed. 

When you walk in the decor is beautiful. Asthetically, its beautiful! it is big and has a nice bar area as well. I give it an A+ for appearance. Our party (four adults, a child and a baby) were seated quickly. Sooner than our quoted wait time. So far so good.  

That was when things started to disappoint me. We waited for approximately 15 minutes before anyone realized that no one was helping us. Our server, a very sweet young lady, apologized and took our order. We had already had plenty of time to review the menu, so we ordered our drinks, appetizers and pizza all at once. 

The drinks and appetizers came out in a timely manner and were delicious. (We ordered the toasted ravioli and it was some of the best I have ever eaten!) 

Then we waited for our pizza. And waited. And waited. After at least 30 minutes our server came back to apologize. Our pizza had been made incorrectly and they were remaking it. We appreciated her honesty and that the problem was being corrected. But were hungry and getting frustrated with all of the waiting. Plus, our baby and 3 year old were losing patience and getting restless. 

Once the pizza finally arrived, it was fantastic. I have no complaints about the food! We loved it! 

Finally, we received our bill and left. We had a difficult time really enjoying our pizza, because after the long wait our children were no longer sitting patiently. Our check surprised me as well. After we added in a standard tip, the total we left was $90. This was for a pizza, one appetizer, and four drinks. (The three year old and baby did not have drinks.) While the food is excellent, I was surprised at how high the bill was for as little as we ordered.  We paid the bill in a hurry and left. 

While the experience was not awful, it did not meet my high expectations. I was a little disappointed when I left. I hope that the problems can be ironed out and maybe I will try again and be a little happier!


Pros: the food was delicious, the staff was very nice
Cons: we were not assigned a server, our order was made incorrectly, the waiting was long, the prices are high"

With that said, we have ordered the pizza for delivery a few times as well and it has been nothing to write home about.  This last time we order which was today around 5:30pm we were told that we would receive our pizza with in the hour and we received it at one hour and twenty minutes.  Usually, I  would not say anything but the pizza when we open the box was obviously sitting there for a long time... it has that hardened cheese and greased over look that  pizza gets when it sits too long.  Also, we ordered a lil&#39; 6 for my three year old and when we opened the box it was over cooked and had this weird brown coagulated spots of cheese on the top, very strange looking.  I would not even think about feeding this to my little girl.  

I called the delivery line and talked to a young man and he put me on hold for about 5 minutes or more, he told me he was getting me his manager.  I hung up and called back and I got the same guy, told him that I was put on hold for his manager and he said, &#34;You know, we are really busy here!&#34;  I explained that I really did not care that I wanted to talk to the manager.  The manager got on the phone right away, almost like he was standing right next to the kid... and I explained what happened and the manager proceeded to make excuse after excuse and said that wait times for pizza can be up to 2 hours on the weekends.  He said that he could my order out to me again with in the hour, I told him at this point i would like my money back and if he would like to come and get the pizza he is more than welcome.  He said that he would like to give me a credit towards another meal, told him again not interested, I just want my money back.  He said that I can keep the pizza and he will credit the bill.  I thanked him for that and he hung up.  He called back not 5 minutes later to say that he is going to send his driver to pick up the food and he would be here in twenty minutes.  We have been waiting for twenty minutes and he still has not showed for the pizza.

So, with that we are again, in search for a good pizza place.  :)  We will go back to the old stand by&#39;s but I am really disappointed at Aurelio&#39;s."

My first order, which was the week they opened, they forgot the peperoni, and were out of dough so they couldn&#39;t remake it. The pizza it&#39;s self was not bad.   My next order was great.   The third order the pizza was horrendously over cooked, they remade it and it was great.  So the food is great when they nail it but they are 1 for 3 in doing that on the first try.

BUT I am so mad... I can&#39;t contain my anger...

Ugh.... Phew... Breath girl..... 3... 2... 1....


So.... My BF and I decided to try this Capri restaurant... We tried the one in woodridge and we love love that place... In burr ridge though, we always go to Coopers Hawk...

But heck, why not....

So I drive to the front and it looks busy (6:30pm) Good sign right? Everyone was sitting outside and it&#39;s beautiful.

We decided... valet is available... 
Even better, and I see two open valet spots infront of the restaurant.

So I stopped and I see the valet guy approach me...

I asked him nicely... &#34;You&#39;re  parking my car here right?&#34; ( open two spaces, I only need a parking spot ) 

Valet guy, with an attitude says &#34; no I&#39;m not parking your car there, that&#39;s for regulars who give REALLY good tip&#34;

I say ... &#34; you got to be kidding right?&#34; 
( I mean, I drive a fairly new Benz, so why would he say that?! Doesn&#39;t he think I tip good?! )

My blood was boiling at this point... 

I mean come on now... 
He could&#39;ve been apologetic a bit, something like &#34;so sorry that&#39;s reserved or that&#39;s for the owners&#34;

Some lie or something... But don&#39;t give me an attitude and repeat three times that the front parking is for good tippers only... Ugh

Finally Valet guy says &#34; fine, I will park your car there&#34;
Again with an attitude...

Grrrrrrr......

So, dinner was lovely. 

We sat at the enclosed patio... Romantic yes

We ordered a bottle of wine, stuffed artichoke for appetizer, rigatoni vita Mia for me... Parpadelle Boscallola for my BF.... $105 plus 20% tip.
Not bad at all

Everything was sooo fresh and delicious ... Service could be a bit faster ... Thank god, we were not in a hurry ...

So after dinner, I went to the manager... Terry...
I asked her how much should I tip the valet guy.. I showed her a $20 bill... And she said, oh no $5 should be more than enough....That&#39;s up to you... Terry by the way was so nice...

I told her about my encounter with this valet guy and she was very apologetic... She said I shouldn&#39;t tip him for being mean to me...

So when I got to my car... I asked the valet guy...
I hope this is ok ( showing him the $20 bill )... 

Valet guy asked... &#34;Do you need change or something?!&#34; Arghhhhhhh...... 

I want to punch him in the face .... 
I composed myself thinking that there must be a reason why he is such an asshole.....

But my first time experience was awful... My review is for the entire experience.

Next time I will park my car and walk and I&#39;m hoping for a better experience... But not soon.

(I wish Yelp had added a &#34;half star&#34; option in its grading system) I would give this restaurant 4 and a half stars. (the one less star is for the reasoning described below).

FOOD: GREAT!!! SERVICE: GREAT to AVERAGE (depends on the night). VALET SEVICE: GREAT! 

I highly recommend trying the Linguini con Vongole and the Lobster Diavolo.

(Also be sure to check out Nick Pontarelli when he performs here at the restaurant).

I like to eat here whenever I am shopping at Burr Ridge Mall. I never have a problem with parking or accommodating extra seating for any additional friends that stop by. I will say some of the diners who come to dine here are really LOUD, use profanity and just RUINS the mood for the REST OF US who want a PLEASANT restaurant dining experience. I don&#39;t mind average to moderately loud talking. (What I don&#39;t appreciate are patrons that use racial slurs and F-words)! This upsets me so much!!!!! I am surprised that this occurs in such a LOVELY establishment. Am I the only one who is offended by other patrons inappropriate comments? Overall, Let&#39;s keep it CLASSY!!! and let&#39;s (ALL) ENJOY a lovely bottle of Vino and keep a mellow POSITIVE vibe flowing!"

My folks insisted I come out to dinner with them to try what I would describe as their most recent favorite Italian spot in the &#39;burbs.

Driving through Burr Ridge and pulling into their parking lot, I seen several BMWs, Cadillacs and an Aston Martin; I knew this was going to be good!

We had a reservation for 7:30 but came nearly 45 minutes early, hoping they would seat us beforehand, and they did!

The inside of the restaurant is very dark, but adequately fancy. We sat on the porch thing which is like a side room to the dining room. It was a breezy July evening, a little warm, but still a pleasant experience. Most of the patrons in Capri were a little older, but well-dressed and gave off the wealthy but not snobby vibe. Very interesting!

We got our soups and salads which were pretty good, but we especially liked the pepper/marinara relish type stuff they brought. It was like a free hot appetizer, which we suspected was made from leftover ingredients. I&#39;m not exactly sure how else to describe it, but it sure was tasty.

We did get wine to drink. A chianti for my mother, a merlot for my father, and a chardonnay for myself. We thought the wine by the glass was a little pricey for what it was, but overall a good sized pour. Their wine list is straightforward and not overly large.

Our food came out and we were so thrilled to dig in. My parents took advantage of our server who said that most dishes are made to order, so they changed theirs up a bit. My mother had the pappardalle, but with chicken instead of veal, while my father opted for a meat sauce on his tortellini. I got to try each of these and they were both delicious! The portion size of the pappardalle was gigantic! My mother has at least one other dinner in our fridge for leftovers. I also must comment on the meat sauce, it was unusually good. Perhaps I don&#39;t much care for meat sauce in general, but this was an absolutely unique and flavorful sauce I wish I could buy in a store. My dinner was the lobster ravioli in a cheese/cream sauce. This too was fantastic, I could taste the lobster was high quality and fresh, while the pasta was a nice al-dente and the sauce was scrumptiously rich.

Of course, it all comes at a comparably higher price, but you are definitely getting what you pay for here: quality. The food would give some of the city places a run for their money.

My mom is on a quest to find the best cannoli, and after asking her criteria of questions to our server, we couldn&#39;t pass it up for $5. We thought it was tasty, but the crust/shell was a little bit too crunchy.

The service was good, I believe our server&#39;s name was Gloria. She was a little quiet at first, but after my father&#39;s (overly unnecessary) comments, she was much more relaxed and talkative. It doesn&#39;t help when we can never decide what to get and ask a million questions.

Watch for &#34;GG&#34;, the owner (I think), he&#39;s kind of the stereotypical Italian guy wearing a low cut dress shirt, fancy jewelry and a presence like no other traipsing around the restaurant. He asked us how our dinner was and made our experience that much more authentic and charming. Classic.

A really solid Italian restaurant that has an upscale atmosphere in the very conveniently-located Burr Ridge area."

There is a large outdoor space as well as a bar area and formal dining room.  The bar has names at each seat of regulars, which is a cool idea.  The vibe of this reminds me of Cafe Bionda in South Loop in the same old school way.  The service was very good at the bar.  They bring you some warm bread to start, and it was decent.  This is no longer affiliated with the Downers Grove location although they still have many of the same menu items.  Their wine pours are generous as well and they have some decent options by the glass.  I tried the steak salad and it was a huge portion.  The woman that took my order warned me that the steak is going to be overcooked but I thought the rest of the components were good so it was okay.  However, she was accurate in that warning.  It was completely overcooked.  I did think it was dressed perfectly.  The tomatoes and peppers were a very welcomed addition but I think it lacked onions and carrots.  Overall decent option for Italian fare."

Never once being told we would be seated on the patio. When we arrived for our reservation they had us set up for the patio on a 100+ degree day. When my boss asked to speak to a manager she was told by the waitress that this is where they seat all large parties. Nobody ever even came to talk to us and they acted as though they didn&#39;t care that we were not going to stay. Instead we called Topaz down the street and they were extremely helpful in getting us seated and the food and service were amazing. Too bad Capri lost out on a $2000.00 check. I am extremely disappointed that they never even tried to accommodate us. We do many company dinners and will never go there again.

We sat on the covered patio which is more like a screened in porch without the screens and half walls. Anyways, we each had a glass of sangria. It was tasty and the serving is large. Everyone enjoyed their dishes (chicken parm, shrimp and linguini, and mussels/clams/squid over pasta). Our server was awesome and the complimentary chocolate bday cake was much appreciated. Some work was being done on the roof (it was loud at times) and the area where we sat could  use more ventilation. Regardless, I&#39;m looking forward to coming back."

I love Italian food and was excited to try the food here after reading all the rave reviews.  Alas, the reviews were not misleading.  Every single thing we ordered, either to share or for our entrees was executed to perfection. 

For starters, the ambiance is so warm, cozy and quaint.  It would be the perfect date night spot of even a place to celebrate a special occasion.  The servers are friendly and attentive and you can tell right away that they want you to have a wonderful time while dining at Capri. 

Our party decided to share appetizers for the table.  We chose:
1. Calamari alla Capri:  lightly breaded calamari, pan fried and flashed with olive oil, lemon, garlic and a touch of chili flake.  The calamari was cooked to perfection.  It was tender and well-seasoned.  Definitely a winner.

2. Baked Clams: a dozen baked clams with bread crumbs, garlic and parmesan cheese.  WOW!  These were SOOOOOOOOO GOOD! I think I could have eaten the entire dozen on my won.  

3.  Bruschetta Calabrese:  crostini bread topped with chopped tomato, basil and garlic.  It never amazes me that such simple ingredients can sing in your mouth at first bite.  But that&#39;s a testament to how fresh the ingredients are that Capri uses.  

For my entree, I chose:
8 Finger Cavatelli:  basil, parmesan cheese, with a rich romana sauce. I chose to add spinach and grilled chicken to my dish and it took the pasta to a whole new level.  The cavatelli was al dente and the romana sauce&#39;s heaviness was cut by the spinach and grilled chicken.  The dish was truly excellent and the portion ridiculously generous.  I&#39;m still thinking about it days later!

My husband ordered the:
Pollo Parmigiana:  chicken baked with mozzarella in a marinara sauce. He said that it was the best chicken parm he has had...no small compliment!

For dessert, the table opted to share the cannoli and the chocolate lava cake and both were EXCELLENT.  It was definitely the perfect way to end what was a great meal.  

Capri Ristorante is a a hidden gem and its close proximity to the city should make it a must visit for just about anyone!  Before I forget, you not only get a quality meal and fantastic service, but you get it all without your wallet hating you.  Not bad if I may say so myself!"

We started with a few shared apps.  One of which was the artichoke.  The sauce was nice but I would skip this unless you are a huge artichoke fan.  Wasn&#39;t for me.

I ordered the stuffed veal which was described as one of the specialty dishes.  I felt the veal might have been a touch over cooked but the flavor was nice.

One thing that was a bit of a turn off was that I tried to replace the sides that came with my veal with a small portion of pasta.  Most restaurants will easily accommodate this request.  I got an odd response back from our waiter that I could get pasta - just not any of the home made options.  If I&#39;m going to eat pasta out why would I get anything other than home made?  I can make pasta out of a box at home.  I said it really wanted a home made option but the server said he was not allowed.  I was a bit bummed - so I stuck with the original sides.

We shared a couple of deserts which were both great."

I like old school, home-style Italian food and man that is what Capri specializes in. What a great atmosphere this place has too with the enclosed patio and their decor. The service is top notch. My water barely made it below half full the entire meal. I ordered their rigatoni dish with their famous vodka sauce and had them add Italian sausage. My lord what a dish. I have to say this was perfect. They make most of their pasta in house and you can definitely tell a difference in their food. The sauce was incredible. Overall I loved Capri and will definitely be back."

I do agree with a previous reviewer about the loudness. I went here for my anniversary and chose to sit on the outdoor patio. There was also a private party that took about half of the outdoor patio at the same time. The party was constantly moving around and bumping into our table that was situated off to the side. I wish the hostess would have told us that there was also a private party on the outdoor patio that occupied many tables so that I could have chose to sit inside. Also, I could not have a conversation because it was so incredibly loud. We were not the only table that was not part of the private party and you could tell other patrons were bothered.

If I would have sat inside because a hostess would have told me about the private party, this review would most definitely have been a 5."

It&#39;s fine though, I ended up here again tonight and was equally impressed with the food and service. 

As I wrote in my other review, Capri is pretty much a staple for us when I come to town. Located just about a quarter mile from the hotel we stay at this little strip mall restaurant is always eager to serve some incredible Italian food.

What makes Capri a wonderful restaurant is that they are always willing to accept reservations for our large parties and manage the group professionally. They keep pace with the groups orders and requests and do it with a consistent smile. 

Tonight I had the Scampi Marinara Diavolo which was perfectly cooked shrimp over some tender linguine. I was again impressed with the lightness of the sauce that did not overpower the pasta and well complimented the delicious shrimp. The soup tonight had white beans and some sausage mixed in that was salty and flavorful.  Overall, Capri is a great place to try and I certainly recommend the shrimp dishes."

My lady and I arrived on a Friday night.  The place was very full and loud, but I liked the look of it.  Lots of small lights, providing a romantic mood.

You&#39;re started off with warm bread - a must for any Italian joint worth its stripes.

We ordered our wine.  It came to the table.  And then, it was a 30 minute wait until our waiter returned.  (Yes, we timed it.)  We actually had to flag down another employee to summon our waiter.

When the food arrived, it was great.  I had the Denis Savard - chicken parmesan with a spicy diavolo sauce and a side of capellini pasta.  I loved it.  The sauce had a great spicy kick and the chicken was *huge.*

During our meal, someone started smoking at the bar.  Such things are startling now, since Illinois has been smoke free for so long.  (Maybe it was our waiter lighting up.  He sure as hell wasn&#39;t doing his job.)

I&#39;m torn on the rating here because service was so terribly inattentive, but the look of the place and the awesome food nudge Capri Ristorante to four stars."

It came with a side of not homemade pasta with a red sauce that was super disappointing and didn&#39;t really even go with the dish. The meatball is average, but jumbo as advertised. Their vinaigrette salad dressing is really yummy and a nice starter course with the bread. We will definitely be returning for the homemade pastas and to hopefully one day try their bananas foster which we witnessed another table being served, but is not on the menu and has yet to be offered to us when the dessert tray is presented. They leave the serving table out constantly so it doesn&#39;t seem to be a secret....."

The restaurant has a small bar area upon entering, seating outside in front or on a patio and interior seating in a smaller dimly lit area or a natural lit glassed-in room.  The staff is always on top of everything and friendly. Our server, Elton, is my favorite guy. Always warm, friendly, sweet and very knowledgeable of the menu and wine.  I make reservations and ask to be seated in his area because he enhances my dining experience at Capri. Upon arriving at the table, Capri provides its guests with a little plate of cheese, olives and roasted red pepper tapenade, along with the best crusty bread.  Soup or salad comes with your entree and there are daily specials offered.  Everything I&#39;ve ordered over the years is delicious!  Their homemade rigatoni and cavatelli are great. I usually switch my pasta dish to include one of those pastas...and they are very accommodating to do that. Our table shared the stuffed artichoke, which was the biggest artichoke I&#39;ve ever had. Yummy!   My husband had the braciole and I had my favorite puttanesca sauce over cavatelli. My husband&#39;s dish was amazing. The braciole was flavorful and tender. There were two large pieces on the plate along with pasta.  My dish was fantastic!  No one does a puttanesca sauce like Capri...it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve come across. The tomato-based sauce has kalamata olives, anchovies and capers and is packed with flavor.  We were celebrating my parents&#39; 63rd anniversary and Elton surprised them with a complimentary dessert after our meal.  How sweet is that?  I really have nothing negative to say about this restaurant except that I feel the main room is cramped as the tables are in close proximity to each other.  I highly recommend making reservations as Capri is always busy, which is a testament to their food and service. I love this place!"

It was a Thursday evening and the place was &#34;weekend&#34; packed.  We made a reservation on Open Table and requested a table outside (which is &#34;first-come, first-served&#34;) and also asked for Elton, who is the best server at Capri.  We did get our table outside but Elton was already too busy with tables so we had to settle for another server.  

Gigi, the owner is always present and makes it a point to stop by your table to welcome you like a family member and make sure you know about the daily specials.  His mother does most of the menu planning and some of the cooking and the authentic flavors and high quality standards are evident in every item on the menu.  

Tonight we ordered the stuffed artichoke and a few pasta dishes and they were all fantastic.  The Melrose Pepper special appetizer was the best!!  The drinks, the food and our lovely table outside were all fantastic.  

My rating would have been five stars if not for the inattentive service we received on this evening - our waitress went long periods of time without checking in - it took almost an hour to place our order in the first place and as much as we love Capri, two hour dinners on a weeknight are unacceptable."

Capri is definitely in my top running for great Italian food, and really considering putting it in a top 5 over-all.  

First an explanation on the .5 star that I took off...  They were extremely busy on a Saturday night, which isn&#39;t really to blame for a popular place.  We were told the wait would be 45 minutes, and it was closer to the long side of an hour.  They do have a bar area, but it was jam packed so we waited outside.  It was a little chilly out, but they have an outdoor patio area where you can sit around these cool little fire tables to stay warm.  The other reasoning behind the .5 star off was the noise level.  It&#39;s super loud in there, almost to the point where its kind of hard to hear each other talk.  

The food was phenomenal though!  We started out with a calamari appetizer and asked for Vodka sauce instead of the typical marinara (highly recommend you try this) and it was great.  The Vodka sauce was some of the best I&#39;ve had.  For my meal I decided to go with 8 finger &#34;Gavadell&#34; (Cavatelli to the non Italian) and asked for Arabiatta sauce with it.  Just the right amount of spice, and the portion size was great, I couldn&#39;t come close to finishing it all.  I also got a side of Escarole because I haven&#39;t seen that option in too many places.  It was awesome, they saute it with garlic and prosciutto!  I will say it was an extra $5 for the side, and it was kind of a small portion on that.  

The service was pretty good, and the pricing was a little on the high side, but pretty much what you expect when going somewhere like Capri.  The ambiance of the restaurant is awesome and would be a really great date place if it wasn&#39;t quite so loud in there.  The parking situation is decent, and they do have a valet if your a baller like that."

The food is out of this world, you can&#39;t go wrong. Some of my favorites are baked clams, rigatoni vita Mia, and the turtle cheesecake. Also, the cocktails are really great too, my favorite being the pomegranate martini.  Great staff and great location. This restaurant has become a staple in my relationship :)"

The older male was seating people and asked if we would like to sit on the patio (enclosed).  So out we went but it was way to warm and stuffy and asked to be seated inside.  So he showed us a table for 2 ( as it was just two women eating together).  The table was right by the door to the patio so I said no please another table.  There were tons of 4 tops so I asked why not one of these.  &#34;Madam these are for 4 people and I can&#39;t seat 2 at at table for 4.  Ok so he sat us by the kitchen behind a curtain.  Must not let the women get a good table.  Especially older women.  Anyway by this time I was really upset.  If it was not for the fact that my sister loved this place I would have removed ourselves from the premises.
But it gets better.
I ordered their shrimp with mushrooms and artichokes in a WHITE sauce on linguini.  The dish came with 4 shrimp, ok there, mushrooms so diced up I wasn&#39;t sure if there was any in there and there were only 3 pulled apart artichokes.  Give me a break.  Oh the white sauce, that was a rose clearcolor.
To to off the evening, the same gentleman that sat us was seating 2 MEN at a 4 top right near us.  So I said in a louder voice so he could hear me...&#34; I thought 2 people could not sit at a table for 4&#34;
Needless to say this was the first and last time I will grace their doorstep."

We drove an hour and 45 to eat here tonight for our second time, taking our 2 teenage kids that are starting college next week and to celebrate my birthday.  

I agree with another Yelper that &#34;Capri envelops the quintessential Italian experience&#34;.  On the long drive home I actually told my husband that Capri is exactly one of the reasons why I love living in the Chicagoland area.

Our server Gloria was brilliant....she made plenty of suggestions and recommendations and knew the menu very well.  We took all of her advice.  Right out of the gate she noticed that we had a couple of small gift bags with us and asked if we were celebrating a special occasion.  We shared our good news with her and ordered our drinks and appetizers....their fabulous stuffed artichoke and Calamari.  Both were decadent (I may actually have to use that descriptor about 11 more times in this review).

We all ordered something different and everyone tasted everyone else&#39;s.....we were actually feeding each other across the table with lots of ooh&#39;s and ahh&#39;s around. I had one of their scampi&#39;s with large shrimp perfectly prepared, my husband had their house specialty, which is not on the menu but is a Bracciole....flank steak with neck bones and this incredible long tubular pasta.  The owner, Gigi stopped by and shook his hand and thanked him for ordering it.  That was by far the most incredible dish that hit the table tonight.  Daughter ordered the seafood platter appetizer as her meal and my son had the stuffed shells.  

At one point, my not so graceful teenage son accidentally spilled a glass of water.  Within about 10 seconds there were 4 or 5 busboys (?) at the table wiping everything off and completely replacing all of our flatware, napkins glasses......everything was spiffy and back to normal in about 2 seconds.  It was really like it had never happened.....

At the end of the meal, even though we could barely move and had them pack up enough food that I will not have to cook tomorrow (YAY!!!) we still managed to order a couple of coffees and cappuccinos and their house dessert, which was a spumoni from Milan with a hard chocolate ganache topping and it was decadent (there is that word again).  Quite simply the very best spumoni I have ever had in my life.  Gloria also brought me an apple cider donut with a candle and she and the helpful attendants/busboys sang to me :)  Once again, Gigi stopped by to wish me a Happy Birthday.

There is outside seating, which is simply gorgeous and the ambience and atmosphere are second to none.  The service was exceptional and our experience was brilliant.  The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food."

It is such a traditional Italian restaurant that I would not be surprised if it was run by the mob.  The place gets super packed around dinner time.

Seemed like there were quite a few regulars when we came. I had the rigatoni vita Mia, which was a bit too sauce heavy for my liking. However, the homemade rigatoni was very good, perfectly thick and chewy. The special pappardelle with flank steak and neck bones was a pretty good dish, and my table enjoyed the veal as well. Pasta entrees are huge portions though, make room in your fridge for leftovers! For appetizers, we had the grilled octopus and baked clams. The clams were alright--very small and too much breadcrumb topping in ratio with the clam. The grilled octopus was very good, flavorful and tender! Service went very smoothly. One problem we had was the lighting--it&#39;s very dark and hard to read the menu. Overall, good Italian food, and we will be back. Come hungry."

The thick, garlic roasted-red bruschetta with asiago cheese was tasty on the crusty bread. Side salad with house Italian is superb. For the entree, the polite young man suggested the Chilean sea bass. It was served on a bed of sautéed spinach in a lemon butter sauce and was excellent. The best fish I&#39;ve had in a long time. A side of penne pasta in a basic tomato sauce came with the meal and paired nicely with the fish, especially with some parmesan cheese (that is served in abundance in a dish on each table). Cappuccino gelato was the perfect exclamation to the meal. Highly recommended. Too bad I live so far away in Idaho."

Service was bit slow - the table next to us was in and out very fast - they seemed like regulars, and were treated as such.  Alas, this is Chicago isn&#39;t it?  Should&#39;ve slipped the hostess a fin.

We finally got our baked clams and grilled baby octopus.  The clams were meh - soggy, small, and couldn&#39;t really find much clam.  The baby octopus was quite good except there wasn&#39;t enough of it.

Home made pappardelle with rolled flank steak and neck bones was very tasty.  The neck bones especially, the flank steak not-so-much.  This was a HUGE dish and it made for great eating the next day at home.  The home made rigatoni was also good but there&#39;s way too much sauce.  The rigatoni with eggplant was pretty good though it was swimming in oil.  Veal francese was very tender but it was a smallish portion.

Pet peeve - I hate cheap parmesan cheese.

This place is a throwback to a simpler time, when no one counted carbs (what&#39;s a carb?) and if you said EVOO people would think you were talking about a large flightless bird.  That being said, take in the brat pack vibe, have a martini and enjoy a huge helping of pasta swimming in gravy!"

The moment you step through the door and hear the sounds of Sinatra, Sammy and Dean, you are hooked.  Sounds Cliche&#39; but Capri envelops the quintessential italian experience.  A great restaurant is more than just great food for me.  You could have the best food in the world but bad service or a lackluster ambiance and it kills it.  

Capri hits it on all 3.  The food is great, service is top notch and the atmosphere is cozy, romantic and fabulous.  I would say that their menu leans toward tuscan italian.  The choices are abundant, it&#39;s not loaded down with garlic and acidic red sauces.  I am a lover of great Veal dishes, they do it right.  The sausage melts in your mouth and the bread tastes like it&#39;s fresh out of a family owned bakery in Italy.  

If you are dining for lunch or dinner, there are options for everyone.  They have a great outdoor area that is used year round.

We can go here with friends, business associates, family or just ourselves for a intimate dinner and it always works.  Don&#39;t expect cozy private booths, this is a tables only place but yet they manage to keep it personal with the placement of seating.  

Love Capri!"

Had an 8pm reservation and got there a bit early for drinks. The place was packed!  Always a good sign at a restaurant. It was a little difficult to get a drink at the bar but not a big deal since the waitstaff that needed to get around us to serve food were all very friendly. Cut to getting seated at our table. Our waitress was very curt and seemed annoyed we didn&#39;t want appetizers so proceeded to not come back to check on us or get our dinner order for 20 minutes. That was frustrating. Dinner was eventually ordered. Everything was delicious. Then dessert. I guess another frustrating thing for our waitress. We got two of the desserts and then for the third, bananas foster, she mumbled something about it wasn&#39;t ready yet. What she meant was that she had to prepare it table side. Usually fun to watch but she was definitely not in the mood to prepare it. It was fine just not as fun as it could have been. Overall great food but beware of service on their busy nights."

I was willing to stick around and got seated in half an hour. While I was waiting for my whole party to show up, a waiter gave us a free appetizer while we were waiting. The bread was very good, it felt homemade. Our food was to die for. The stuffed shells and the 8 finger cavatelli were among my favorites, along with the Limone Veal (although the portions for the Limone Veal are on the smaller side). Excellent food and service. We plan on coming back again and again! Make sure to make reservations in advance if you don&#39;t want to wait!!"

Service is outstanding, food continues to be  THE BEST Italian around, and we traveled about 14 miles to enjoy this deliciousness (and we live less than 2 miles from Clara&#39;s ~ that says it all, don&#39;t you think?)

Expect to sit in tight proximity to your neighbor, but you cannot hear their conversation and you will not be bumping their elbows as in some restaurants.

Come hungry.  Portions are generous, plenty to share and have some to bring home.  We all ordered something different, a pasta dish, eggplant, chicken, and a veal dish and everyone proclaimed theirs to be the best. Tasting each others did nothing to change anyone&#39;s mind.  You cannot go wrong, and there are also daily specials.

My only complaint ~ the bread is just too crusty for my taste but perfect for slopping up every single last drop of whatever sauce you selected for your pasta side dish.

Make a reservation."

The service we received on a busy Wednesday dinner service was one of the best I&#39;ve ever received at a restaurant.  Everything was timed correctly. Wine was poured correctly.  Drinks replenished in a timely fashiion.  Plates removed properly, etc.

Food ratings
1. fried calamari with marinara sauce - Excellent. Very light and crisp batter.
2. Beef ravioli - Mom liked her entree.
3. Eggplant parmegiano - Excellent.  Just melted in your mouth. The serving filled 1/2 of a dinner plate and the pasta that came with it filled the other half of the plate.
4.Homemade rigatoni with vodka sauce - The rigatoni was really good.  My husband and I were not impressed with the vodka sauce. It had no real flavor to it.  It truly tasted like cream mixed in with marinara sauce.  Would have appreciated just a little bit of spice or flavor with it.  Even black pepper would have helped.  We rate Portillo&#39;s rigatoni with vodka sauce much better.

5.  House salad that came with the dinners - All were served with a vinegar and oil dressing, I guess.  Would have enjoyed a creamy garlic dressing. I did not ask if other dressings were available so that was my fault.
6. The crusty, warm bread - 5-stars. Wonderful, perfect.
7. Entree costs - Most pastas were in the $14.95 range.  A veal or chicken entree was about $19.95.  Fish was in the $24.95 range and the couple of steak entrees were a little above $30.00. 

The tables are close together and the restaurant is loud.  Serveral people in my party of 8 said they would return to this restaurant.  Even though most everything is good, I probably will not return.  There are other Italian restaurants of this quality closer to home and at a little bit better price point."

The food is a bit on the pricey side, but Capri is also located in a very elegant part of town. The bread they serve as a pre-appetizer was a bit hard the most recent time I ate here, but everything else was fresh and yummy! Highly recommend the tiramisu and a dish with the vodka sauce!"

They helped us choreograph an awesome birthday surprise for my mom and made arrangements for their crooner to serenade her during our dinner, which was mostly delish (the risotto was a bit plain and had overcooked shrimp). 

Capri is just fancy enough to be a special event location and casual enough to really enjoy.  It was a festive night with great food and good company.  My minor complaint is that they pack everyone in like sardines and the bar/entrance is mayhem during peak reservation check in.  But, a good time was had by all."

Service: I cannot remember a particular time when something would go wrong. The servers are knowledgeable, nice, and attentive. Yet, if you&#39;re looking for a quick dinner, this is not the place. People are not in a hurry here, therefore the pace is very slow. 

Food: love it. I&#39;m not a fan of pasta, but I can still find tasty options every time i come in. The food is not greasy like in some other Italian restaurants, which was a nice surprise. Personal recommendation: the grilled seafood plate. To die for!

Ambience: the restaurant is a bit small and cramped. When it gets a bit busy (6-7 other tables) it gets extremely noisy. Sometimes too noisy, in order to keep a conversation at your table."

capri-ristorante-burr-ridge,Lisa B.,2UDJpaTsYHu9CXmbUMO8Sg,"Willow Springs, IL",0,1,0,17,4,9q66XCAhmUeL1_HzhiLVxw,2.0,2013-01-11,"We live w/in 2 miles of Capri and until this evening, had never been.  My husband&#39;s not a big fan of Italian but finally apeased me and made a reservation on a Friday evening.  We are particular about our wine, love many CA reds, but don&#39;t love the Italian reds. , He asked when he made the reservation if we could bring our own wine. &#34;No problem, it&#39;s a $15 corking fee.&#34; We&#39;re used to this and are just pleased to be able to bring our own wine.  

We got there a few minutes before 7 on a Friday night, and I was genuinely surprised as we walked in at the noise level - I really didn&#39;t know what to expect, but the place is relatively small, tables are really close together and there&#39;s no noise canceling systems anywhere, so it is REALLY loud.  

We were seated within 5 minutes of arriving which we were excited by, but we shortly became disenchanted because the tables are so close together. On top of which we were right next to the entrance to the patio area which they&#39;ve transformed for winter into another room with lots of seating. Every time that door opened and closed, it pushed/bumped my husband&#39;s chair.  We tried to move the table out a bit, but then every person working at the restauant bumped my chair, ten minutes and twenty bumps later, we moved the table back in a bit.  Why is it I wondered that folks who were patrons were more respectful of the space than those who work there.  We weren&#39;t the only ones - almost every table in the place is w/in a foot and a half of the table next door and the isles are very unforgiving.

It took some time for Oscar, our server, to arrive at the table, 7, 8 minutes.  Thankfully the busers are extraordinarily attentitive and had bread and water on the table asap. On the table, we found olive oil and parm cheese to go w/ the bread -- the bread is outstanding, authentic Italian, just the right texture, chewy crusts, tender insides. Delicious. 

Unfortunately, those busers don&#39;t carry cork screws so we were made to wait to enjoy the wine we brought until Oscar arrived. My husband and I were there to enjoy dinner together, unfortunately we really couldn&#39;t hear each other at all.  The cielings are high and the noise level requires one to nearly yell to be heard by others at the table table.

Oscar was congenial but distracted.  Capri is a bit of an old boys club, everyone knows everyone (unless you&#39;re a rookie like we were in which case we were given significantly less than attentive service).  I won&#39;t belabor the timelines, because overall the restaurant and Oscar were efficient, Oscar simply lacked the &#39;warm and fuzzy&#39; factor. He came by to introduce himself and pour our wine, then a bit later to take our order, then again 5, 6 minutes after our order was delivered and that was it.  The table next to us, while I don&#39;t think necessarily regulars, was given far more attention - Oscar came by to see them a half a dozen times in the amount of time he was at our table 3 times.  Were we treated differently because we brought our own wine? 

The food was outstanding - we both ordered shrimp dishes, me shrimp w/ tomato and basil, hubby, shrimp w/  brocoli and wine sauce. Jumbo tender shrimp as promised.  Truly fantastic.

We may go back in the summer to see if their outdoor area is enjoyable, maybe slightly less LOUD, but we will certainly make sure Oscar&#39;s not our waiter. 

We had thought we&#39;d order some dessert, but decided to get it to it to go because it was simply too loud to enjoy time there on top of which, we just weren&#39;t made to feel welcome."

Thinking to myself &#34;that looks like a nice place, I must try it&#34; I decided to give it a go on my way home (Friday night about 9). Casual dining restaurant with ample parking and nice spacious dining area.

The decor is attractive with a solid menu. What I really liked was the following;
1. The staff were super friendly and I was very well looked after. They were all smiling too like they liked their work. Made for a great atmosphere.
2. The food was great. Huge burrito and the refried beans were very nice. The rice was a bit of a let down compared to the quality of the rest of the meal (I had the Ground Beef Burrito meal). 
3 . Did I mention the staff? From the point I walked in, I was greeted and though the restaurant wasn&#39;t overrun, they were constantly working. Either cleaning or preparing food. The kitchen is all open and you can see your food being made. Clean kitchen too. Love it.
4. The music in the restaurant was kind of modern and I liked it. Matched the place.
5. Reasonable prices too. Under twelve bucks for the the very tasty burrito,  with sour cream and guacamole  (which made the Burrito very tasty) with rice and beans.

I will be back and will give the other locations in Lombard, Naperville and Carol Stream a go if I am in the area."

Let me start by saying that I am a Mexican Food Snob(afterall I am Mexican) and think that no one can top my moms cooking.  

We walked in and immediately i noticed the cleanliness.  We promptly ordered our food and got our drinks. Very efficent ordering at the counter instead of having to wait for a waiter.  I went to try their pineapple drink as it is not something too common to have at Mexican Restaurants much less the ones in Lisle.  

I ordered the tampiquena(my go-to) and my friend ordered a chicken torta.  Well of course her food came out first delivered to us by a server named Memo(Guillermo).  He dropped it off and was very nice checking to see if we needed anything else.  He then noticed that we were waiting for my food to start eating.  He was kind enough to offer me an Al Pastor taco to try and so that my friend could start eating.   It came out and it looked delicious.   I of course started out with a squirt of fresh squeezed lime and took a bite out if.  Boy was I amazed.. it was so delicious very flavorful.  Point 1 given to them.  

I then got my tampiquena and was plated nicely.  I tried the rice... delicious.... tried the beans... also delicious...last was the meat... again the lime and then a bite.... omg it was soooo tender and delicious so juicy not dry like most places are... throughout the whole time we were there of course Memo one of the servers was very attentive and making sure that we were not needing anything further.. He even refilled my friends soda for her.  

Then came Dessert....... of course we love dessert and given the option between fried ice cream and churros we chose BOTH!! We were not dissapointed we devoured it all... 

Needless to say we were pleased with the service and the food.   We definitely will make this a place to go when craving REAL AUTHENTIC Mexican food. Hands down beats Yerbabuena!! 

And for those saying that they will put El Burrito Mexicano out of business or that El Burrito Mexicano is way better.... little known fact they are owned by the same guy. :) 

Toodles.... give this place a shot its amazinggggggg!!!!!

Oh and ask for MEMO hes an awesome Server. :)"

Service was uneventful. The person who took our order was about as interested in making us feel invited as the brick walls on the inside. From the moment we were ordering, it was clear this was not going to be a customer experience driven restaurant. Point made when we left and no one said a word to us even though we were only one of three people in there.

Despite that, we were hopeful of the food. Steak burrito was dry and tasteless. Three tacos were the same. Chips were less than fresh and not sure what the salsa identity is but it isn&#39;t working. 

Cheese quesadilla was the best thing at our table and our kids said, &#34;they are okay&#34;. 

Finally, the prices are way too high for below average Mexican.

Save your money and experience for a different place. We will not be back."

I have to say, too, that I&#39;ve only ordered to go. Perhaps eating there in their super clean restaurant (which I of course appreciate immensely), might up my opinion. But the togo order was messed up the first time, they made it right the second time and the food was just okay. Not great. Not horrible. 

Guacamole was good, salsa was too tomatoey for me, chips were cold, soup was tasty but super salty and the al pastor tacos were decent. 

So next time I stop in, I&#39;ll eat in and see what I think. 

The people that work there are friendly, the place is spotlessly clean and bright and the decor is appealing, too. I hope the place finds its groove because I love me some Mexican food!"

I had passed it severely times before it was open and was excited to try it. Tonight I got the three tacos with beef and chicken with refried beans and rice. I loved that they offered cilantro as an option for the tacos as well as cheese, lettuce and onions.

We sat down and were greeted by a woman with a warm smile that set down chips and salsa as well as two other bottle me of sauce. 

She checked on us often even though she wasn&#39;t a server just the person bringing the food (there&#39;s not servers just numbers for the tables).

The food was delicious and hot and the churros are literally TO DIE FOR. Delicious. You absolutely have to order some.

Also, sign up on their email list and they will automatically send you a coupon for a free dessert of your choice - I added on the chocolate cake!
We really enjoyed our food from this place, I have to say the steak tacos were pretty damn good, the guacamole too!  I prefer the chips made on site, but they were still fine to accompany the guacamole.  The service was quick and prices are good.  It was pretty hopping too around 8pm on a Wednesday night.

Which is eerie because this place is built where an old BK used to be. Is this how it&#39;s supposed to taste or is The King getting his revenge from beyond the grave? O.o

I ordered 2 steak tacos with rice and beans on the side. I can honestly say that their steak tacos are hands down the worst I&#39;ve ever had. The steak was cut into thick chunks and almost every piece was chewy and it also lacked any flavor whatsoever. The rice was also bad but the beans were ok. I&#39;m giving 1 star just for the staff because they were very nice and professional but believe me, the steak tacos are not good"

I&#39;m a very tough customer and I simply was impressed at every turn.  The decor is tasteful and smart.   The cleanliness is exceptional.  Bathrooms - impeccable.  Staff - as courteous as a human beings can be.  Now, lets get to the food.  EXCEPTIONAL. The real deal.  They prepare everything in front of you - because they have NOTHING to hide.  It&#39;s authentic and delicious.  I really don&#39;t know where to begin.  The sauces were all delightful.  I found out they made them all there home made.  That in and of itself was worth the trip.  Make sure you get all 3 sauces.   The canisters they put the sauces in are smart - because you can have as much as you want and other people can&#39;t put their spoon in it.  Clean. Smart. Everything is thought out.  The chips are free and I&#39;m surprised - because this place seems like it would cost more.  You order at register and they bring it to your table which is much faster than having a waiter.  Less money too.  They kindly kept asking us if we needed anything.  So nice.  The burrito was absolutely delicious.   They were not shy on the veggies either - and, frankly, I like that because I like lettuce, tomatoes, avacado , onions etc.   The pork was outstanding.  Repeat: Outstanding. Pork on a &#34;spit&#34; (think gyros) and get the pork plain (they call it pastor) because I personally think it&#39;s better natural than in the bbq sauce.  They put on a corn tortilla with cilantro - grilled onion and lime and my mouth was in la la land with joy.  The &#34;sauce&#34; they served with this was my favorite. Ask for it and they will bring you a bottle of it.  So cool.  Truly, it was the best corn tortilla I ever had.  Normally, I detest corn tortillas - but, not here.  i bet they make them as well.  I wouldn&#39;t doubt it.   The owner was kind and appreciative and I could tell he REALLY cared.  I asked to meet him.  Oh yeah, the fried churro is the GREATEST fried dough you will ever ever have.  Crazy delicious treat.  I&#39;m planning on going there weekly - it&#39;s that kind of place.  The entire bill for a family of 4 was only 29.50.  Whaaat??  Very reasonable.  They are not taking advantage of people and I plan on supporting this amazing establishment frequently.   So good. Trust me!!!  It&#39;s my new &#34;go to&#34; place.  They deserve it.  This is art my friends.

Tried to order inside, slowwwwww, so I thought well I&#39;m getting it to go why not try drive thru...
Big mistake, while waiting vehicle in front of me was passing there bags back, because of drive thru error.

Then after excruciating wait we got our food, unfortunately not correct, not hot, just passed out with utter contempt for customer. 

Girl at drive thru argued , despite me asking for manager 7times.

Yesterday, we ordered takeout and were very disappointed with the food. We totally understand that sometimes thing are off, and given their positive track record, we were fully prepared to let this bad experience go. All we wanted were replacement dishes. 

Despite numerous attempts to rectify the situation, we were given the run-around. It seems it was not possible to speak to a manager and Patrick the waiter was useless and evasive. Can&#39;t believe it was this hard to rectify a simple issue. Very sad Le Siam"

To set the scene: I was super exhausted from a day of work in the city, didn&#39;t feel like making dinner (or going grocery shopping), my husband was out of town, and I was craving Thai food. The second I hopped off the train I pulled out my trusty Yelp app and searched for the closest Thai food with carry out (and a great rating of course). Voila! Le Siam it is.

When I got there at about 6 pm the restaurant was completely empty. The decor didn&#39;t take me by surprise since I read previous reviews, but I can definitely agree that they have a lot of wall space and not a lot of design. A very simple, half elegant, half casual space. So kind of a confusing ambiance. Luckily, I was just popping in to place my order to go, but I&#39;ll touch more on the actual restaurant next time I dine in...because there will be a next time.

It was the owners&#39; 21 year old son working the register and he was very friendly. I placed an order for crab rangoon, pad khee mao with chicken, and pad thai with chicken. My total came to about $28. I was told it would be ready in 20 minutes, which sounded horrible because I was hungry and tired, but I was prepared to wait. Only 7 minutes later my food was ready! Applause for that!

Food was still hot when I got home. The crab rangoon was okay. They were a bit small and the crab filling was really good, I just wish there was more of it. My pad khee mao was awesome! Made to perfection. My only complaint (which is totally my fault) was that it was a little too spicy for me. Usually when I see pad khee mao listed on the menu at other places, it has a spicy symbol next to it. Le Siam&#39;s menu did not. I asked if the dish was spicy and was told they could make it that way. He asked me how spicy I wanted it and I said just a, so he said he would make it mild. Well sir, my taste buds could not live up to your &#34;mild&#34;. The dish was still excellent, I just needed a whole lot more water to get it down.

I can&#39;t comment on the pad thai, because I didn&#39;t try any of my husband&#39;s meal. Hopefully one of these days he will get around to writing his own review! Until then, thanks for a great dinner Le Siam. I&#39;m happy to have found a yummy thai place in my neck of the woods."

It&#39;s clearly time to rectify that. 

I came recently with a different friend, and I&#39;m happy to say that as always, no matter what I get, it&#39;s good. Panang curry with chicken is a frequent choice, a pleasant blend of mildly sweet and spicy tastes. I still love the cashew chicken from my first visit, and also enjoy the Pad Khee Mao (Crazy Noodles), and Tom Kha Gai coconut soup. 

Coming with a different friend afforded me a taste of someone else&#39;s choice: she picked the Limes Chicken, which was lightly battered and fried and served with a lime sauce...not something I would have noticed myself, but really tasty! I could consider ordering it the next time I go. 

This place is never super crowded when I visit but they seem to do a lot of takeout. Conveniently located near 59 and the mall, but the relaxing atmosphere takes you away from it all. Le Siam stands the test of time for me as a great choice for Thai food in the Naperville-Aurora area!"

Today, I asked why my carry out order was pushed back.  The kind gentlemen at the front said they got a mad rush and said sorry about the wait.  I watched nearly the entire dinning room fill up and only one customer was ahead of me with carry out.

The portion is small. the taste is good. A little overpriced. Nice environment. 

Our waiter is so funny. He reminds us the dry pepper could add three levels of hot in one scoop, by which I think he tries to warn us not to put too much of it. However, one of my friend craves for hot food and is great at eating hot food. After adding two scoops, she still think it is not spicy enough for her. by the time the waiter come by and check the table, he was shocked. He immediately add water to her cup and ask her if she is OK. He literally says, &#39;did you really add one scoop?&#39; It was so funny lol."

It&#39;s a sit down restaurant where reservations are taken. The room is a little dark and I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s for ambiance. I feel if the room was a little more lit it may give it a little more welcoming feeling. 

My first encounter were with two gentleman, one younger Asian and another older not Asian looking. The younger man immediately asked if I had a pick up and I said I&#39;d like a menu. He then just said it&#39;s over there without giving me direction to where it was.  So I asked, &#34;I&#39;m sorry?&#34;. He then repeated himself &#34;over there.&#34; But the older gentleman proceeded to hand me the menu.  The younger guy made one last comment, &#34;Do you not know where it is&#34; under his breath.  I should have said, &#34;No Jackbleep!  I haven&#39;t been here before.&#34;  Here are my expectations:
-  Greet me with a hello and Welcome to...&#34;
-  Do you have a reservation or are you here for a pick up?
-  You need a menu?  Here&#39;s one.  Please take your time.  If you have any questions please feel free to ask, I&#39;m here to help.
Luckily, the older man was there so I decided to focus my attention on him.  He was more pleasant and inviting.  I made sure to take my order from him.

I ordered the Tofu Panang Curry - not a big fan of it.  The sauce was good but the tofu was rubbery. I also ordered the Basil Fried Rice.  That one was better.  The flavors aren&#39;t one I havr really tasted.  I can&#39;t really describe it. The Pepper Steak was delicious.  The beef wasn&#39;t over cooked and the sauce was full of flavor.  I&#39;d order this again.

I went with a red curry with beef, and it hit the spot. I wouldn&#39;t say it was one of the best I&#39;ve had, but it was far from the worst, with lots of veggies and sauce. I almost wish it came with more rice though, since I usually make a pig of myself soaking up the leftover gravy with the rice. Service was very quick and prices reasonable. I can definitely see heading back here again some day to scratch the itch."

Pleasant relaxed atmosphere. Clean and presentable facilities.  Lime chicken and Pad See Ewe were good.

Wife and I had tried le Siam a few years ago, and had been underwhelmed. Then she suggested to give it another try, something we rarely do,  For us it&#39;s almost always a question of &#34;once bitten, forever shy.&#34; 

It may not be fair to judge the food on our small selection for the two of us, but what we had was mediocre, at best. The shrimp tom yum was extremely bland; a little kaffir lime aroma but the basic stock was off putting and there was no chili heat. This soup is supposed to be a dancing balance of chilies and herbs but le Siam&#39;s was &#34;duh.&#34; I may be picky because I love this soup done right and I&#39;ve eaten hundreds of them. I&#39;ve been in Bangkok countless times, lived in Southeast Asia for years and have eaten this soup all across the US. Le Siam&#39;s tom yum was in the bottom five percent, and only charity and an awareness that I may have forgotten some other poorer version keeps me from placing it in the absolute cellar.

Fish cakes were hard almost to the point of unchewable.

Our server was pleasant but untrained. The ordering phase was hesitant and out of synch. His real gaffe was when we not even near finished with the main course. He brought our check and plopped it down with the usual &#34; Whenever ready . . .&#34;  while we still had food in our serving platter. It wasn&#39;t that it was a brisk lunch hour courtesy, or the place was crowded and people waiting, or close to closing time. He just ended up being rude and giving us the impression he was hurrying us out.

We sat at a 2 place table along the window side. As we looked down the top of that decorative panel between our table and the wall we could see a significant collection of dust all the way down as well as a few places where other fingers had touched the top. I hope more attention is given to cleanliness in the kitchen than was evident in the dining room.

Looks to me that they have management issues in training and housekeeping.

Sorry to all you other reviewers who rave about the place but I just don&#39; t get it.

Too many other better (and not overpriced) Thai restaurants in the area for us to consider returning to le Siam."

About four bites in I felt something strange in my mouth.  It was a piece of metal! I called to speak to the owner of the business, I was very calm and polite. I was told the owner wasn&#39;t in that day and would I talk to the manager.  Fine.  When she came to the phone I wanted to speak to the owner of the business.  She told me three or four times that she was able to &#34;make decisions&#34;.  That was fine but I wanted to speak to the owner because this was a very serious issue.  THEN she said she was the owner...really? I decided to call this morning before they opened hopefully the owner would speak to me. My number has been blocked. This is a potentially serious problem, if I had swallowed the metal...
Anyway, I would like to speak to the owner so he can hear first hand what happened. I took pictures and have two witnesses. The owner needs to figure out how this happened and I don&#39;t want to speak to just anyone about this matter. 
Owner of Le S&#39;iam...please contact me directly. I&#39;m not interested in $ just how did this happen?!?!

My favorites include their Crab Rangoon, Chicken Satay, Pad Khee Mao, Pad Thai, Panang Curry, and both their Tom Kha and Tom Yum are phenomenal - I prefer the tangy Yum, to the rich and milky Kha, but either is a great choice! I also love the interior, and find it warm and inviting. My only complaints are that the staff tends to take a little while, and are slow with service. Also, that their portions are small, and keep getting smaller, which the prices keep climbing. Disappointing business strategy, but the food never disappoints!"

I honestly like Chopsticks food much better but they don&#39;t have a liquor license and on a Friday night we like to have a drink with dinner.
We also went here because we were going to Hollywood Palms for a movie right after dinner. (Go see Gone Girl).
Getting back to the review, the ambiance is nice although showing it&#39;s age a little bit. Service was great at first but took forever to get the check. (they got real busy as we were eating). Prices are reasonable. The food was good, I had sweet and sour chicken, she had stir friend broccoli and chicken.

It&#39;s close to work, and it&#39;s a reasonable distance for me to pick up food on the way home from work for dinner.  Sorry Thaiway, I have a new favorite!

They open at 11:00 a.m. for lunch during the week, so I stopped in for some Pad Thai.  I ordered it with chicken and asked for spicy.  I was then asked &#34;medium? or spicy?&#34; I went with medium, since I don&#39;t particularly consider eating lunch to be a Fear Factor event.  The lunch special also comes with soup or salad.  I chose the salad but didn&#39;t eat it since the pad thai was very filling.

My pad thai was really good!  The portion was a little smaller than I&#39;ve had elsewhere, but it was still a lot of food for one person.  The &#34;medium&#34; spice came from a little container of sauce they gave me, which I found odd, but it wasn&#39;t too bland or too spicy with the sauce.  It was just right for this Goldilocks.  The chicken was dry, so I&#39;d skip that next time.

The Crab Rangoon were the BEST I&#39;ve had at any Thai or Chinese place.  They were crispy and not too doughy with a lot of filling.  I&#39;d actually go back here during lunch time just for the Crab Rangoon.  Healthy?  Abso-f*cking-lutely not, but seriously delicious that I have to describe them in the most annoying way...addicting? Epic? Awesome? 

The interior of the place is semi-fancy.  But that&#39;s just looks - the staff, the menu, not really fancy.  I&#39;d come here for a &#34;date night&#34; for sure, but it&#39;s just as good for takeout too."

The ambiance and decor is rather fancy, but that&#39;s ok......it works. They have a nice menu with lunch combinations, which is always nice! 

So, on this occasion, I was with friends and we all tried each other&#39;s entrees. We also ordered the Crab Rangoon appetizer, which was very good. I tasted the Sweet Basil with beef, Pad Thai with chicken, and cashew chicken. All of them were very good. I have to admit that I have had better Pad Thai in Chicago, but this Pad Thai was very tasty. I loved the Cashew Chicken and would probably order it if I visit again. The lunch combination price is $6.95 for each dish, which is a great lunch price for me, especially with soup. I would definitely try Le Siam again."

Le Siam on 59th was the place to go. Great reviews and even greater food. But as with all great businesses they get on a high horse and forget their roots. LeSiam let the quality control go loose. Today I went to the restaurant and ordered my all time favorite, chicken pad thai. A fail safe, what I believe to be the best in town, how could anyone fail. But I was, bringing the food home to a starving family and finding the most bland tasting food ever. Chewy chicken, flavorless noodles, even after drowning it in soy sauce and suracha douce no help. Looks like if the chefs paid more attention to cooking rather than blasting &#34;la key&#34; radio, we could have had a better outcome.

There&#39;s defo not enough decor for the size of the place but they do okay for the location. I love the window treatments, it makes the place look MUCH fancier than it really is. 

I&#39;ve been here several times and like to enjoy a nice Thai beer. Most of the time the Thai beers have something to do with animals and I appreciate that. I believe this is a family business because the last time we went a child/tween boy brought our check and dessert out. 

I love their hot and sour soup and they&#39;re very willing to tailor it to your liking with veggies, or tofu, or seafood, or meat or however you like it. 

The thing about this place is that the appetizer, beer, and desserts are great; it&#39;s the dinners that are so-so. They seem very Americanized. I would still highly recommend for lunch. The lunch menu is similar to the dinner menu but more paired down. For the lunch price it&#39;s defo worth it.

The owner recently revamped/refreshed/redesigned the decor and it&#39;s never looked better.

The atmosphere is a modern one, versus the typical hole-in-the-wall Thai places that abound.

The food is spectacular: the flavors, the serving dishes, the colors, the fresh produce and meats. It&#39;s just amazing. And the food is served very quickly too, unless it&#39;s a full house and then you just wait a couple of minutes extra.

The curries COME WITH rice, it&#39;s not extra! There&#39;s some spectacular salads, soups (huge for sharing), main dishes, and even desserts (lychee on ice or coconut ice cream and fried bananas MMM to die for.

Most visits we get fortune cookies and ice cream on the house with our bill. Now THAT&#39;S customer service! Love it. The owner works hard to build a relationship with his returning customers.

The food at Le Siam is ok tasting. Nothing exceptional. And there is a strange, but ever-present (and unwanted) artifact of dining at Le Siam: I&#39;m running for the bathroom within 40min after eating there. I&#39;m no stranger to Asian cuisine, so it can&#39;t be said that i just can&#39;t handle the Asian palate. It&#39;s this place. In fairness, my dining companions are not effected the same way, but it hits me every time - without fail.

And the service... geez, the service..... So, start by flagging your server when you want tea (be prepared to make repeated requests for tea before they comply). Flag again when you&#39;re ready to order, again when you&#39;re ready for the check, and one more time when you&#39;re ready for them to retrieve credit card for processing (bring cash to eliminate this last speed bump). In general, be prepared to ask for everything at Le Siam because the staff has no capacity to anticipate the needs of their diners. Waitress has even taken our orders while engaged in personal cell phone call. 

So why do I return? Good question. The simple answer is that it&#39;s my boss&#39;s usual pick for lunch. She likes it because it&#39;s close to work. But If she factored in the time spent waiting, we&#39;d be enjoying lunch at better places that are just a bit farther away. In other words, I have no say"

the food is ALWAYS good. i started going here around 2003...and loved it EVER since. I introduced my husband to it back when we were dating (he had never really had thai food) and he fell in LOVE! he is absolutely SMITTEN with the limes chicken and i am absolutely SMITTEN with the coconut soup....i&#39;ve been to SEVERAL thai places with a friend (we like to try new places) and i&#39;ve NEVER EVER had good coconut soup as i did with le siam. Even the pad thai...i&#39;ve had at other places and i ALWAYS come back to le siam.

the service is always prompt and polite. The owner guy may not smile a lot or be personable like at some places where the waiter talks to you alot or asks how you are or makes conversation...but he makes up for it in good service and good food. 

it&#39;s just a very simple place with no frills. it&#39;s just a good place to get good food. and the prices are reasonable. I&#39;ve never had ANY issues or bowel issues as another user stated. last time i was there was about 9 months ago when i took my entire bridal party there after we tried on dresses. my sister, who is unfamiliar with thai food...said the food was spectacular. my mom...who is filipino and no stranger to asian flavors...LOVES IT and she ADORES the jasmine tea!

He&#39;s always been like this but he didn&#39;t take orders or serve so much in the past so that made going there more pleasant. 

The Thai iced tea is still good but they doubled the price (??? last time I went it was 2.50 or 3 tops, this time they charged $5). Sad that this place went down in quality."

If I could come here weekly I would. There are a few Thai items that I have fallen in love with.

1. Tom Kha Gai Soup

2. Pad See Ew w/Beef (I like to add crumbled peanuts and lime juice on top)

3. Crab Rangoon (is a food orgasm in my mouf)

A+ on the interior design. They clearly did not follow the traditional Asian restaurant design guide book. When you order hot tea they come in these cute elephant tea pots. Also you get free ice cream at the end of the meal and a fortune cooki... roll. It sounds weird but they are pretty cool, just difficult to break into. Another perk is you can choose brown rice over white rice which I&#39;ve never seen before. Now if I could only get that with my sushi..."

Do you ever go somewhere, really hoping that it will be great, only to be kind of disappointed?  And the whole night, your brain is arguing with itself over whether to keep rooting for the restaurant or to just say &#34;Fuck it, I&#39;m gonna start mentally ridiculing everything for the rest of the evening&#34;?

Yeah, I had one of those nights last Saturday at Le Siam.  Here is a transcript from the conversation in my brain:

&#34;Hey, this decor is pretty nice for a suburban strip mall place!&#34;
&#34;Yeah, but this pad thai is kind of bland.  And dry.  And why is it garnished with iceburg lettuce???&#34;
&#34;Ha, yeah that IS weird.  But our boyfriend&#39;s beef pad kee mao tastes awesome!  Let&#39;s just keep stealing little bits of his!&#34;
&#34;We didn&#39;t come here just to gank our boyfriend&#39;s food!  We wanted delicious pad thai, dammit!&#34;
&#34;Well, at least our waiter is nice and well-meaning...&#34;
&#34;He&#39;s doing his best, and he&#39;s obviously young, but he mumbles and forgot to bring us a couple things we asked for.  Also, why did half the table get our food like ten minutes before the other half did???  That kind of sucks.&#34;
&#34;I know, I know, but patience is a virtue...&#34;
&#34;Also, he&#39;s wearing sweatpants.  This place, while not fancy, is just fancy enough to make a sweatpants-bedecked waiter look REALLY unprofesh.&#34;
&#34;But he gave us complimentary spumoni ice cream and Thai fortune cookies for dessert!  I mean, that&#39;s pretty good!&#34;
(Grudgingly) &#34;Yeah, that was pretty good.  I GUESS.&#34;

Bottom line: this place gets 2.5 stars, and I left with a headache."

So my family and I went here last minute on a Sunday. Having a craving for Thai and its choices for both carnivores and vegans it was a good choice.

The pros: I got the red curry and it was delicious. Not too spicy but still flavorful. The restaurant itself is nice. Quaint. Not too fancy but still nice for a restaurant in a strip mall. The menu is extensive with alot of choices in noodle, curry and entree dishes. 

The cons: The service is laking. Our party of 6, one of only 4 tables in the place, waiting 15 mins before a waiter came to take our order. We hadn&#39;t ordered drinks or appetizers and the waiter was ready to take our meal orders. My gf ordered the Glass Noodle dish and it was eh. Lacking flavor and veggies it was pretty boring. Not bad just not great. The appetizer of fried tofu was pretty boring too. I could make it at home and the sweet and sour peanut sauce tasted like it came out of a bottle. 

Overall I will probably eat there again most likely for take out because I get a craving for curry from time to time and in the suburbs good Thai food isn&#39;t easy to come by."

I love the curry,and the Pad Thai and Pad Seeuw are always delicious.  The chicken satay with peanut sauce, the spring rolls, and the salads are excellent.  The Sing Ha is cold and reasonably priced.  The ambiance needs some work.  It&#39;s one large, bright  room with little to distract and/or interest you, and the location of the restrooms is ill-conceived.  Additionally, I would remind the owner that no man is an island-get some help!  The service  generally ranges from slow to painful."

They&#39;ll serve family-style so we all get to enjoy one another&#39;s dishes. If you plan on ordering dessert go easy on your entrees.

And they were right!

Their Italian beef sandwich is served with French bread drizzled with their au jus sauce, which gives the sandwich a crispy but soft &amp; juicy texture.. which made this Italian beef sandwich a winner in my opinion.
It&#39;s topped with sweet or hot peppers all for $5.45. I saw the size of the sandwich and at first I was thinking the portion is too small, but it was filling lol.

The cheese fries are crispy and delicious too! FYI, the cheese is separated from the fries lol.

Concept was great food, reasonable prices and take care of the customer. 
 Well fast forward many years. Dick wants to retire and sell his business. Ive been to several Portillos in the last year( after the sale) &amp; it seems they&#39;ve lost a piece of their great triad of business concepts. Yes customer service is still excellent and the food still tastes great but, prices are now higher while food sizings have shrunk. Very disappointing but the new CEO&#39;s seem to have decided to fill their pockets a bit deeper while reducing portions. Ive also heard expansion is going to be occuring everywhere.

I&#39;m not sure why even the crew chief on duty didn&#39;t say a word to us. 

So we stepped over into the regular line and ordered. It was after eight, not at all busy inside. I went back to the salad counter and got the crew chief&#39;s attention and told her it would have been kind of someone would have directed us to the other line. She said, &#34;Oh the register is supposed to do that.&#34;

No, ma&#39;am, employees are meant to. 

As always the hustle to serve those in their cars was more apparent than those of us who get out of cars. 

The salads were just okay. My chopped salad had little chicken and hardly any cheese. Not up to par."

I have grown up on Portillio&#39;s and they are just a staple here in Chicago. From their meaty Chicago style Vienna beef hot dogs, to their char-boiled chicken sandwich, cheese fries, and chopped salad, I have never been disappointed here! 

Any Portillio&#39;s you go to it is always busy. I have gone before at 8:30pm and there is still a line that wraps around the block. I don&#39;t know how they do it, but it&#39;s great to have one so close to me. Never let the lines fool you, Portillio&#39;s staffs a small army to make sure you&#39;re not waiting longer than 5 minutes."

From their excellent Italian beefs, Maxwell Street Polish, Ribs, Chopped salad and chocolate cake, it&#39;s no small wonder we visit here so often. Recently they have improved the drive through lane and it makes getting your order easier and faster. Our only minor complaint is on a couple of occasions when orders take longer, they have you park in one of their numbered parking spaces and sometimes they forget your order. On the plus side they have always compensated with chocolate cake for our inconvenience. To be honest,  I think my wife secretly hopes our order is misplaced because of the possibility of free chocolate cake."

She then said she would personally drive my correct order here to me at hospital, I could not believe it. Wow.... Considering they do not deliver, yet she wanted to personally fix my order. The manager I spoke with, she herself personally drove to the hospital with my correct order and kindly added a piece of their amazing chocolate cake and also said they reimbursed the cost to my husbands card.

It really says something about the place when the parking lot is so packed you have to park at the Chili&#39;s across the way, and the drive-thru line is wrapped around the building. It&#39;s absurd!

Great food, but the prices are a little expensive. Over five bucks for an italian beef...but it&#39;s so worth every penny. They also have hot dogs, tamales, cheeseburgers, ribs, chicken, and salads. Delicious.

When I lived in North Carolina, my husband and I had their food shipped to us. It&#39;s that good. They send you the beef, their bread, hot and sweet peppers. If you order the hot dogs, they will even mail you the tomatoes they use! It&#39;s the entire Portillo&#39;s experience.

At this specific location, the employees are nice, the restaurant itself is clean, and regardless of how busy it is, you can usually get your food pretty quick. Props on that, Portillo&#39;s.

We&#39;ve catered through them a few times as well. Beef, ribs, and mostaccoli....always a hit. The chicken parm over a bed of spaghetti...miss. Not so great."

She asked me if the guy outside taking the order said &#34;dipped&#34; I said no, he did not, we had to correct him. She then asked me if it was read back to me correctly at the window and I told her they did not say &#34;dipped&#34; at the window.

Stevie identified herself as the GM and proceeded to tell me that there was nothing they could do because I got what I paid for and since they don&#39;t charge for dipping they don&#39;t owe me anything.

Since the lot is right next to Chili&#39;s, Friday &amp; Saturday nights can make parking very difficult.

Another reason this portillos lost stars- fries were wayyyyyy overly salted. And the servers didn&#39;t do any of their &#34;#2 this order&#39;s for you!!&#34; rhymes. What the heck? That&#39;s a portillos staple!!

I may as well throw my hat in the ring on Portillo&#39;s being that each location has a ton of reviews already - easy target, I suppose. I may be anti-chain restaurant, but Portillo&#39;s is my &#39;no one cares&#39; card. I&#39;ll go to them until I die. Likely soon if I keep eating there. So why the 4 stars? 

This place has their drive through down to a science - just like 59. The Naperville location? Nope - a bunch of clowns run that one off of Ogden. Anyways. Drive through - check that &amp;*^% off the complaining list. 

Food - Damn good. E.v.e.r.y...t.i.m.e. Not once has my order been screwed up - missing some ingredient or terrible in quality. The quality is what I expect it to be - damn good crinkle cut fries, jumbo dogs, good beef and an awesome combo. Hell, even the burgers are good - go figure. 

So again, why the 4 stars? 

As a person of morbid proportions (screw off to the people thinking, &#34;you fat ass!&#34; - die already. Maybe I&#39;ll beat you to it.) this place is stingy on the fries. You want a large? Well, fine. Here&#39;s a large container and half your fries, fatty. Always. No ifs, ands or buts about this location. The GM here has trained his/her minions to be stingy asses to the customers on fries. The life giving food to my eventual cholesterol problem. 

A solution - check your order before you pull away and give em&#39; *&amp;^% if they short you on fries. I always call them out when they do and sadly that seems more frequent than not. 

You won&#39;t have this problem at the 59 location or even that pit on Ogden - but Oswego... Probably keep their money in their mattress too. Stingy."

We pull in Portillo&#39;s and since I am driving my Handicap friend we look for a handicap parking spot.... wait there&#39;s the front door where s the ramp where is the marked parking spot??? Oh wait there it is on the side of the building right next to (get this) the  employee entrance!  *picture attached*

I do not know if they hire many handicap employees but how about a few spots for customers by the &#34;customer&#34; walk in door not very classy Portillo&#39;s.

We find a spot close to the door (non handicap stall) and make our way through the maze that is Portillo&#39;s tables cramped and odd ordering and pick up locations neither handicap friendly either. WE place our orders, 2 huge beef sandwiches one with cheese the other (mine) with everything except sweet peppers.

He grabs a table &amp; I grab the food neither sandwich was marked but that is no big deal the big deal is that Mine had no cheese and it had sweet peppers WTH!

I just sit down and eat it anyway, it was alright but not my particular style of Italian beef I prefer but still better than most. They also did not have free fountain refills why is this it cost $0.25 to refill a large cup the cups often cost more than the soda in these places.

On the way out I was glad neither of us where in a wheel chair as the bathrooms where all the way on the other side of the restaurant in the most remote corner possible, I guess my biggest problem is that this is a huge chain and yet they have this poor lay out that is not only inconvenient for normal people but hell for the handicapped get your act together Portillo&#39;s"

You just need to learn how to order your food. My wife is gluten free and dairy free and she can order a good portion of what is on the menu. Salads you substitute the chicken that is on the  poppyseed fruit chicken salad. I do not remember if that chicken has no marinade or it is a different one that is used on it. The chicken used for the other salads has a marinade that contains wheat. For a sandwich order it without the bun. So you order the beef in a tub or the hot dog nude. My tip for you go inside to eat the line is smaller than the drive thru.

I ordered one Chicago-style hot dog and fries. Verdict? I kind of like a Chicago-style hot dog. I like the peppers, I like the onions and I like the condiments, but I could probably do without a pickle on top so I placed it to the side and ate it later. 

I really like the atmosphere inside Portillo&#39;s because it&#39;s homey and looks like a great spot for a family to get a reasonably priced meal.

After moving out of Chicago, which I&#39;ve done recently, you realize that it truly is the only city that does italian beef right, especially Portillo&#39;s.

See, in my mind I always thought my favorite Italian Beef in the city was Al&#39;s Beef, until I had Portillo&#39;s again.  I ordered a Beef and Cheddar crossaint, my staple order here, and I was in juicy beef bliss for 10 minutes--awesome, awesome sandwich.  

Anyone want to start a Portillo&#39;s franchise in Metro Detroit??!?!?"

I&#39;m not much of a fast food eater, but on those rare occasions I find myself craving for good, fast, and greasy food, I can always count on Portillos to deliver.  I&#39;ve never been to this Portillos location, but seeing the parking lot was full while other places were practically empty on this particular cold and rainy day, I new that this place delivered good food as my BF said.  Portillos is his number one choice for all things fast food...I would say he is a conneseur of fast food, especially pizza and burgers. So I knew we had come to the right place.

I ordered the Beef and sausage with an order of large fries and drink.    Upon the recommendation of one of the staff, I ordered the extra fried fries.  The fries were excellent, and seasoned with just the right amount of salt.  But I didn&#39;t really notice the difference between my extra fried fries and my BF&#39;s fries, but in all it was still really good fries, better then Mcdonald&#39;s.  My Beef and Sausage was pretty good too, and they packed it on with a ton of beef.  It was enough to fill my meat craving.  I didn&#39;t have a chance to order the chocolate cake as there was a long line, but from what I saw on their display cabinet, it looked really moist and delicious.  I will have to order that next time I am here.

Overall, I would definitely come back here again or any other Portillos locations.  The restaurants are always spot on clean, organized, and the staff is always friendly."

He made them in little donut-like pans and sprinkled them with sesame seeds when they were done: that&#39;s how they do them here.

I was expecting a mom &amp; pop pita shop but to me it looks more like Chipotle goes middle eastern, which I think is easy and welcoming for people who might be new to this type of cuisine.  There is a simple, bright menu at the front of the counter when you walk in that instructs you to pick your protein, then your &#34;container&#34; (wrap, bowl, etc.) and then toppings.  This couldn&#39;t be easier!  I ordered a Chicken Swarma wrap with hummus, arabic salad, pickles and garlic sauce and it was very good.  It took me about 15 minutes to get home so by that time the pita was a bit chewy but I won&#39;t judge...next time we&#39;ll dine in and try their food fresh off the grill. 

For the size of the wrap you get their prices are higher that other places I go to (about $1 more) but it was filled with a nice amount of chicken and other ingredients and I can&#39;t deny the convenience of this location.  It was an unexpected surprise to find Demascus Falafel."

Like I said simple. I was confused on their fountain beverage selection since I could not see the fountain drink machine nor the flavors posted. I do not drink soda, so I pretty much paid for a fountain drink with the hopes they served either Iced Tea, Lemonade or Fruit Punch. So yes indeed, they had Fruit Punch.

I have been a fan of Middle Eastern food for quite some time now and Damascus does not disappoint. My wrap was flavorful and a generous portion. I look forward to a return visit exploring the menu a bit more."

The setup is like a Subway or Chipotle, where you get to build your meal as you progress down the counter. The schwarmas and falafels are always hot and fresh, and taste of quality.

This kind of place seems to be popping up all over, and I&#39;ve been underwhelmed as often as not. Thankfully, when I tried Damascus Falafel, everything met or exceeded my expectations.

You&#39;re all familiar with the model - pick a protein and format, what toppings and sauces you like (within well defined limits) and pay at the end. On my visit, I found the service to be pleasant and helpful (I did mention that it was my first time there), particularly from the woman staffing the first station--she was fantastic. 

I had a good idea of what I wanted prior to entering the restaurant, but it was helpful to be able to see the toppings in person. I opted for the beef shawarma lettuce bowl with regular hummus, Arabic salad and cucumber yogurt, pickles, onions and cucumbers, topped with hot sauce. I got a couple of falafels (discs rather than balls) as well.

Let me tell you, this particular combination was absolutely delicious. The freshness and texture of the produce was fantastic and the meat had a great charred flavor. The only thing I might change next time is to get the purple cabbage as a topping. It looked great.

They smear the hummus (or baba ghanoush) at the bottom of the bowl, so don&#39;t get the idea it would be easy to use as a &#34;dip&#34; for your side order of falafel or pita. That may be true in the platter version - not sure.

It&#39;s not the cheapest meal option around. The parking lot is a wee bit tight (as in you might be backed into or vice versa). But wow, is the food great! 

Unreservedly recommended."

We live in Chicago they live in Plainfield.

We decided on Mediterranean food.  I spotted Damascus Falafel in Willowbrook on (where else) Yelp rated 5 stars.  When we got to the restaurant I was a little disappointed by the restaurant as it has a very limited menu.  The restaurant is going the route of providing a selection of items similar to chipotle letting you create your own dinner.  The choices they have are chicken or steak Shwarma wrap, bowls or plates.  With that being said we all got the steak Shwarma wrap.  

I was very pleasantly surprised by something as simple as a wrap.  Keeping in mind you can choose from a variety of ingredients to go inside.  I chose the wrap w/spicy red pepper humus as a base &amp; added a Mediterranean cucumber, onions &amp; tomato salad, red cabbage salad, pickles, tomatoes &amp; sautéed onions w/a garlic sauce. (I wasn&#39;t going to be kissing anyone later nor would they want me to with all the onion and garlic in my wrap). The lean steak meat is added &amp; the wrap is pressed &amp; toasted panini style.  This beef Shwarma wrap was absolutely delicious.  The beef was chopped fine and seasoned very good.  Adding the red cabbage salad added a little texture &amp; crunch.  The dill pickle slices also added a little crunch &amp; tartness that added to the flavor.  The wrap was toasted panini style which added further crunch.  Add the garlic sauce and you have a perfect blend of spices, crunch &amp; texture into an absolutely fabulous steak Shwarma wrap.  

The prices are very reasonable, but it&#39;s a little too far to frequent unless I&#39;m in the area, but I will absolutely be back again when I am in the area."

I&#39;m from the metro Detroit area and we have large Arabic populations and while the cafe style formula is popular here in Chicago it&#39;s relatively non existent in Detroit.  That being said I&#39;m very familiar with middle eastern food...the restaurants are everywhere in Detroit.  

Shortly after moving to Chicago...After months of not having middle eastern cuisine and missing home a little, I tried Damascus Falafel and I was surprised that I actually enjoyed it a bit.  I got the chicken shwarma plate with baba ghannoush, red cabbage, tabouli and falafel.  Did it remind me of the food back home?  No...this is as generic to Middle Eastern food as Chipotle is to Mexican.  

I clearly must&#39;ve forgotten what middle Eastern food tasted like because more recently I tried a  restaurant called Shwarma Express in Lombard and OMG!!  After eating there several times in the last 2 months I can say that there&#39;s really no way to compare the flavors and menu variety found in an authentic  restaurant to what they have at the cafes.   For around the same price, I&#39;d happily drive 30 minutes to for some fresh home cooked middle eastern food.  

Damascus falafel is ok for what it is, it&#39;s clean and the employees are friendly, but it&#39;s also bland and flavorless compared to a full fledged middle eastern restaurant.   Find ANY authentic spot and I guarantee you get better tasting food.  If cafe style middle eastern food is all you know then it&#39;s probably great, but if you&#39;re familiar with the flavors of authentic food you&#39;ll never be satisfied with this again.  In my opinion these chain cafe style restaurants aren&#39;t doing middle eastern food any justice."

First of all the service was terrible. The two people who served us were rude and so pushy. I know we were a little indecisive around what toppings to get, but only because there is a limit on the number of toppings you are allowed. Huh? I&#39;m sorry, if you set up your business model to mimic the subway/chipotle dining experience, I feel like you can&#39;t place a limit on the number of toppings? Am I crazy? IDK. Regardless, I expected the employees to be patient and kind and make my order with a smile and I got none of that. 

The food was also below average. I think what I needed in that moment was comfort food. But Damascus Falafel was just on my way home. And I got to say, it did not hit the spot. I think I was so disappointed in what I ordered because I felt like I picked toppings that didn&#39;t go well together (which wouldn&#39;t have been a problem if I was able to select more toppings that would have complemented my order). 

Maybe I need to give it another chance when I&#39;m in a better mood, but I dont see that happening any time soon."

My only issue is that sometimes the sandwich rolls are hastily made, which has led to them falling apart towards the end (especially if the vegetables were not drained well).

In the middle of my panic, the employee offered to let me pay for my meal next time. Luckily, I found my money, but I really appreciated the offer! 

Every inch if the restaurant was immaculate. It is obvious that cleanliness is a priority.

This is a breath of fresh air and fresh ingredients. I discovered this place and have been back 4 times now, I think its actually getting better. I usually get the wrap with any meat or falafel choice, they grill the wrap on the press. I have also learned to never leave without a couple falafel on the side absolutely delicious. So good, and so worth it, I&#39;m a Syrian food convert because of this place, support them they are a small business, if you like to try new flavors and step outside the fast food box you won&#39;t regret trying it. Also, the wraps are messy, but I discovered a trick. Eat it over your rice and all the juices and extras fall into the rice for a nice addition lol!"

You have the option of getting it on a segmented chinette type plate where all the portions have their own little place or getting it in a bowl, which I opted for. You get a choice of two different hummus, choice of white or brown rice and then a nice selection of veggies and salads to top it with. Then your meat and topped with a choice of different sauces. 

There&#39;s no way you even need the pita with this, as it was a meal in itself. This and a drink was like $12...for the amount of food you get it was well worth it.

India&#39;s a giant country with something like 1.25 billion people so it has its regional cuisines - that I know nothing about, to say nothing of Pakistani cuisine, which apparently this place may also have.

But I find all the stereotypical standbys like butter chicken, tikka, naan bread, biryani, samosas and the like delicious. Indian food is as vibrantly tasty as it is colorful. There are rich, spiced up, often buttery sauces, sumptuous meats that have been slow cooked in tandoors, and plenty of vegetarian options too.

I&#39;m probably romanticizing however this $8-with-a-drink spot prepares all this stuff but it tastes as good as many sit-down Indian joints. Today&#39;s lunch had a heap of saffron basmati rice that actually hid a tender chicken wing. Strange! Lettuce, tomato, and onion is a basic salad of sorts on the side. Then two chicken dishes, tikka and butter I believe. Both delicious.

Lets just say the inside or outside of this particular restaurant is not very attractive or inviting.  Its pretty much a hole in the wall Indian/Pakistani restaurant. If you are the type of person who judges a book by its cover, then, this place is definitely not for you. Although, if you are a risk taker and only care for some good authentic indian and/or pakistani food then I 100% recommend you come and try out Spicy Sizzler. 

The food is amazing. Anytime we are craving indian food (mainly butter chicken and butter paneer) this is the only place we love to come to. Not only is it more a fast food type of place, the taste of the food is great. We have tried quite of few of chicken dishes and vegetarian dishes. Butter chicken, spicy curry chicken, and chicken 65 are both great. Butter paneer is my favorite, and i can definitely say this is by far the best place i&#39;ve had it. The smoky tandoori taste makes it better then all the other restaurants. The nan is usual and you can&#39;t really go wrong with that. We recently tried the Chapati, which is like a 10-12inch wheat roti. It was great. One is more then enough for one person. The samosas are great, however, I was not a big fan of the puffs, especially the egg puff. (It is just 1 or 2 hard boiled egg stuffed into a pastry puff. Not very flavorful.) One of the best part of about this place is they offer Kati rolls. Pretty much an Indian burrito. They use the Chapati as the tortilla part and the stuffing is either chicken, vegetables, and/or paneer in different sauces. My husband and brother won&#39;t stop raving about it. The one thing we have not tried is the Biryani yet, however i wouldn&#39;t doubt it being anything me authentic and tasty. 

I&#39;m a huge foody and I love my indian punjabi food, so please do not judge this place by the way it looks outside or inside. The food is great and you won&#39;t be disappointed."

Usually they do say an hour for delivery, which is expected but, when my manager called about fifteen minutes after the order was made she was told it would only be twenty minutes for the to delivery to get here.

I placed my order at 1:17 meaning that give or take a few minutes we would receive it by 1:40/1:45. She called again at 1:55 asking where the food was etc. They proceeded to tell her the order confirmation states the order will be delivered by 2:20-2:30 okay then why tell us 20 minutes? So we wait for 1:30 to come around, still not food.

She calls back at 2:45 asking where the food is, at this point she tells them how ridiculous it is for us to have to wait over and hour and a half for food that we already tipped and paid delivery on... so they proceeded to say that we would have to wait another half an hour for the drive to get back then he would be on the way....

All in all we were hungry and had already paid so my manager ended up calling back and saying she would pick it up. WE had to ASK for a refund of the delivery charge and they weren&#39;t even going to refund the TIP! WE asked for that too! So all in all they gave us the $4.00 delivery plus the tip in cash. 

NEVER AGAIN will I order from here or go here. I wish I would&#39;ve read the review before going to order from this place. Pretty much EVERY post states that they are SLOWWWWW. They aren&#39;t exagerating! Manager just got back and there is NO CHICKEN PUFF in my order that I did not receive. DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!!"

However the 2nd time the biryani was extremely oily. Extremely! I think its because we ordered during the 5-6pm rush hour. Won&#39;t be doing that next time. I&#39;ll still give this place one more try. The taste is on point.

But this is not what this place is; unfortunately, Indian restaurant here (in the U.S.) seem to have gotten into the business with the wrong idea. They have no clue about who their demographic customer should be and so quality suffers.

Let me explain. These &#39;stores&#39; start out with the idea that they plan to serve authentic Indian food - a food that is succulent with spices and deliciously aromatic. The demographic for this type of food would most probably be Indians (who have grown up and can live with this spiciness) or a few other, but much rarer, type of customer (one who has an acquired taste and can handle spicy food).

Then somewhere along the way, these restaurants felt the need to sell to other demographics - probably locals - and had to water down the spiciness of this once good and palatable food; and make it grossly unhealthy by adding a load of oil and ghee.

Bottom line: We ordered the lamb biryani and the vegetable thali - the lamb was tough, the biryani oily and fat floating on everything in the thali...suffice it to say, we will not be going here again."

Not a fancy place at all.  Looks more like a gyro take-out place than anything.  But  defiantly worth going if all you want is good food."

Great!  The menu is a bit limited and can be difficult to order if you&#39;re unfamiliar with Indian/Pakistani foods.  An excellent solution though:  order the lamb biryani!  If based on food alone this place would be a 4/5.  However, one star less because...of...the...abysmal...wait...time.  Prices are a bit high versus what you can get a similar dish for in the city.

I got 2 veggie samosas (they were out of chicken) and an egg puff. All for about $3! I really liked the samosas, good texture, and good spice. Not *too* spicy, but enough to clear my sinuses.

We decided on the butter chicken and some kind of chicken rice, and were told that it would be plenty enough food for 2 people... it was not. :( They were teeny tiny portions for 8 or 9 bucks a pop, and the chicken rice had a ton of these tiny chicken bones throughout.

We know a lot about Pakistani/Indian food and it is exciting that they offer several dishes that can&#39;t be found at many of the Naperville Indian restaurants (because this one is Pakistani), such as halwa puri, pista lassi, and karahi chicken.  They also sell sweets from Tahoora (a sweet shop on Devon avenue in Chicago) which are difficult to find in this area.  This time we got vegetable biryani, chili chicken, pista lassi, falooda, and pani puri.  The food was authentic and delicious.  I was particularly impressed with the decor considering it presents itself as &#34;fast food.&#34;  Nice and cool on a hot day.  We look forward to going back and trying more Pakistani food.  

I feel bad that others have not had as good of an experience yet, but am optimistic for this company&#39;s success.  It is a challenge to find good Pakistani food in Naperville, so I hope the owners will take Yelpers feedback and improve their services! :)"

There is no consistency in food. I have tried &#34;Papdi Chat&#34; there three times and the first two times it was excellent, but the last time it sucked (for some reason I was also given a lot more quantity last time). They do serve halal food and have a lot of different items on the menu.

This place also sells &#34;Halwa Puri&#34; on weekends for $6.50. It&#39;s the worst &#34;Halwa Puri&#34; I have tried in Chicago area. It lacked both quantity and quality. You can get real &#34;Halwa Puri&#34; for no more than $4 on Devon avenue and on Shan restaurant in Chicago.

Bottom line is that there is no guarantee that the food here will be good. If you feel like taking a chance and want to try Indian/Pakistani food in Naperville area, you should give this place a shot."

The staff said that the frontier chicken was ready but the wrap would still be 10 minutes or so.  They suggested that we get the biriyani instead because it would be faster.  We agreed.  The biriyani consisted of rice and flavorless, dry lamb.  The froniter chicken was nothing special and very oily.

We didn&#39;t complain because we knew that the place was brand new.  When others complained, the staff was not apologetic, rather told people to bear with them because they were new.

Yes, the sandwiches are somewhat pricy, however, the quality of the food is spot on. Since we live in Versailles, my roommates and I come to this place all the time, which is only a five minutes walk. The BBQ chicken with bacon sandwich is delicious, my fav. It  contains coleslaw which makes it kinda sweet, but at the same time, the chicken/bacon give it a savory taste. I am not a big fan of coffee so my togo drink has to be the blueberry pomegranate fusion tea. So bomb. On top of that, all of the pastries look delicious. Noticed how I said &#34;look&#34; instead of &#34;taste&#34; because I have not had a chance to try them yet. Hopefully, on my next visit. 

I really like the entire design of this place, very spacious so plenty of room to sit and even study. The only negative thing I will say about this place is the hour of operation. They open from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M and close on the weekend. So limited. They also do catering which is perfect if anyone planning to have a get together. The staffs are always helpful and friendly.

I got the black tie drink since it sounded interesting (condensed milk, espresso, and something else). I loved it, a perfect balance of flavor and definitely kept me awake to study for my exam.

Since it is a cafe, they serve food, too; and all the items on the menu looked really yummy. They also do catering if you are interested.

There are lots of different styles of tables and chairs at this location and I really like it because it is good for solo studying, lunch dates, group projects, etc...

My only issue right now is that the hours are Monday-Friday from 6 AM to 6 PM. That is wayyy to early for a &#34;perfect study place&#34; to be closed.

Ordering online and picking up your food from a little shelf to avoid a wait, ordering from a kiosk to customize a sandwich with whatever crazy ingredients you want, or going up to the counter to hear about what&#39;s currently brewed and what other recommendations they might have. Specialty&#39;s has all of the options. This is a large and (as of 4/15/16) relatively uncrowded location with tons of natural light, fast internet (I&#39;ll try and get a speedtest next time I&#39;m in), and plenty of tables, couches, or chairs to work at. Noise levels are usually pretty quiet, but having a nice long boisterous conversation is never frowned upon. Really the best of both worlds in that sense. The employees are typically very friendly and do their best to accommodate  your needs.

In terms of quality, the coffee isn&#39;t anything amazing, but it&#39;s Peet&#39;s, so it&#39;s never bad. I usually get either straight dark roast, or go for an iced mocha. With their mochas and other iced lattes, they make the extra effort to add a little foam on top, which at most places is just on a hot drink. It&#39;s a nice touch and brings what might otherwise be a totally average mocha to a nice treat. For food, I usually stop in for breakfast and order my loaded customized breakfast sandwich with sausage, egg, cheese, mushrooms, red onions, cucumber, lemon thyme aioli, tomatoes, and pepperoncini all on toasted ciabatta. All these add-ons are free (sandwich is $4.99) and with their kiosks or online ordering, you can save custom favorites so it&#39;s a one click order. Super convenient! I&#39;ve had a few other things and have been a little let down. The salads are pretty plain jane and the pastries have never been anything special. Overall though, this is a super convenient, if a bit overly corporate-feeling, quick coffee/breakfast stop before work."

The big sign visible from the road is misleading.   This coffee shop only has three Peet&#39;s coffee on drip, and not a lot of product.   My wife and I visited recently to purchase coffee beans, and were surprised to find that of the five bags available, four were decaf.   

This review is incomplete because I haven&#39;t tried the restaurant yet.   Hard to tell what they serve, as the couple of times I&#39;ve visited I didn&#39;t see anyone eating.   I suspect most visitors stop in only for coffee.    

It&#39;s disappointing that Peet&#39;s closed down all of the Chicago-area Caribou Coffee locations, but has opened so very few of their own coffee houses.   Specialty&#39;s Cafe has the look and feel of an Au Bon Pain or Panera Bread, but without much indication of what they stand for.    This place feels like neither a coffee house nor a restaurant.

I even came one day a few weeks ago thinking they HAD to be open after many months of construction, but they weren&#39;t. Boo! I went in today to pick up coffee, breakfast and something for lunch.

Upon first arrival, it reminded me a lot like Panera. The set up is pretty similar-- with the pastries on one side and the lunch menu on the other. There were a bunch of employees offering to help, but I decided to peruse the iPads/self-checkout option so I could look at all the menu items. The good thing about the self-checkout vs ordering with a person is that you can see nutrition info and not feel rushed if you&#39;re indecisive. You can also see a picture of every menu item and it&#39;ll tell you what comes on it or what you can add. I ended up getting the ham quiche, a black tie (my favorite iced Peet&#39;s drink) and a chicken curry soup to go.

If you&#39;d like to chill out, feel free to stick around. They offer free wi-fi and ample seating. I can see them starting to get really busy once the word gets out.

My ham quiche was really tasty, but a little cold by the time I got to work. My drink was perfect and exactly as it tastes at the Peet&#39;s locations. The soup was also pretty tasty, but I wish they had more soup options. I guess I&#39;m just used to Panera! For 3 items, I spent $10 which seemed fair to me. 

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll end up here quite often and I hope they succeed."

When you walk in you are greeted by 2 woman -- one says her welcome greeting and the other greets you and asks how you are doing. Some might say that is too much, but not me. Having worked in customer svc for many years -- I know  that you need to be friendly and treat your customers with friendly service and they def. did.   The pastry section is rather large -- all different kinds of yummy looking muffins, cookies, sweet rolls, and quiche&#39;s.  I decided to go w/ the 3 Cheese quiche and it was very tasty. Pretty large too. I got a PSL cause I am all about that pumpkin spice life right now.  It&#39;s frothy and has a good pumpkin kick to it. Not too bold and not too sweet.  ALL of that for $6.00 -- where as another popular coffee store 2 min away - I would have paid close to $10. 

Overall this place is very clean, modern edge, a lot of light inside, plenty of seats and the outside area is very inviting.  I def. will be back here again.

On the plus side - they have a large variety of baked goods that look delicious. I did get one of their Valentine&#39;s cookies and it was pretty bomb. But again, seemed fairly overpriced to me."

I&#39;ve had their milk chocolate chip cookie and their black and white cookie. Some of the best cookies I&#39;ve ever had (and I know cookies). The only downside is that they are expensive. Almost $3 per cookie. But... They are amazing.

I&#39;ve also had their pastrami and swiss sandwich, which was delicious. The meat wasn&#39;t fatty at all, which in my experience is rare for pastrami. 

I&#39;d recommend this place for the cookies alone. The delicious sandwiches are an added bonus."

Even gotten to know Adriana, the head of HR of North America, as well as Phillip the Regional Manager.

The building is new construction. Very spacious. Tastefully designed. Offers outdoor seating, too.

Today marked their first day of business. I bought a croissant, a chocolate chip cookie, and veggie quiche. Everything tasted great! Better than Panera and possibly Corner Bakery.

Sidenote, had the opportunity to participate in a soft opening to run the crew through their paces earlier this week.

Looking forward to eventually trying everything on their menu."

1. Both times the food was very good. Portion sizes were good and well executed.  Prices weren&#39;t that bad. 

2. Staff friendly 

Minuses:

1. Only open M-F until 6PM. A bit odd. 

2. Everything is ala carte. Kind of a turn off. Wanted to do a 1/2 sandwich and soup and they did not offer that. A bit disappointing an odd as well seeing that they are mostly targeting breakfast/lunch crowd.

Food is good. Check the place out. Is much better option than its competitors. Just wish they were open for dinner and weekends and offered 1/2 soup sandwich salad combos. I would have at least tried a soup or salad had I had that option."

I typically order ahead for lunch, it typically takes 15-20 minutes to get the order ready, and bonus points for the gluten free options!
For dinner, I&#39;ve come a few times, and my biggest peeve is the wait. No matter what time I seem to come, there is a wait. And, 15 minutes always turns into longer. Once, I was able to snag a table in the bar area which is first come, first serve. A few times, however, I had to simply wait. The place is so busy, you can&#39;t even saunter up to the bar to have a drink. But that just means they have good food, right?
I&#39;ve tried their french onion soup which is my favorite appetizer, it is simply delicious and the onions are always made just like I like them, not too crunchy and not too soft. Plus the cheese, ohh the cheese is just ooey-gooey delicious.
The tuna tartare is also a good appetizer, the breads it comes with really make the dish pop. 
I&#39;ve had their salmon and the filet, both really delicious. I always worry that salmon will come out over cooked, but I&#39;ve not had an issue with this here. The filet was a little over medium, but was still moist, delicious, and flavorful. 
The one disappointment was the twice baked potato was so dry, I don&#39;t know if it was over cooked or just not enough cheese, but I was super excited to try, yet so disappointed. The mac and cheese however, always a delicious and filling choice. The au gratin potatoes were nicely done, and the creamed spinach is also a good choice. 
The service has been great every time. Especially when I sat in the bar area, the waitress was super sweet and always checking in on us. The bathroom is really nice and clean as well. If you come at dinner time, be prepared to wait, and hopefully not too long!!"

I wanted a nice restaurant to bring my out of town guest to.  Wildfire was recommended to me and based on Yelp reviews, I booked a reservation for noon on a Wednesday.

We had a delicious lunch.  Service was very good.  The lunch specials are reasonably priced at about $15.00 and they had a good variety to chose from.  I got the stuffed burger lunch special.  It was stuffed with cheddar cheese, bacon, and barbeque sauce. Fries were included.  My friend got the turkey burger on a wheat bun and said it was one of the best turkey burgers he has had.

From other reviewers, it seems like the restaurant is very crowded for dinner.  I will come back at lunch because my first impression was so good."

Mike was so attentive and took very good care of us. He remembered everything we asked for. If the plates were almost finished he asked if we wanted more. We didn&#39;t have to wait or look for him.
The bison meatballs for appetizer was delicious. They were a nice size and you could have 2 or more and it wasn&#39;t too filling. The other dishes that we chose was the Wildfire salad, pork chops with a mushroom crust, chicken and artichokes, roasted vegetables with balsamic glaze and mashed potatoes. 
The pork chop with the mushroom crust was moist and vary flavorful. My sister has ordered it from the menu before but didn&#39;t think the mushroom crust was so crumbly. It was more mushroom than breaking. It was still very good. The chicken was good but a bit dry. The other dishes are typical sides. No complaints. 
It&#39;s the 2nd party I&#39;ve given here and I&#39;ve had a good experience for both."

You can order the mini versions of their desserts if you&#39;re indecisive and want to be a fatty 

I love their prime rib and filet mignon. I also like their tenderloin tips. Their veggies are always fresh! Although I wish their side items had more variety, their selection of meats and great seafood makes up for it. 

I think they only serve cornbread for lunch. If you see it, HAVE IT! And have lots of it. They&#39;re so good!!!

On this last visit we had the wood roasted mussels. They are good here but small. Seems no one has nice meaty ones like we used to get years ago.  

I got the French Onion Soup. It was really good! A nice broth with a bit of salt and sweet coming through. This was the best I&#39;ve had in the last 4 spots I&#39;ve ordered from.

For dinner we had the coffee rubbed Bison filet cooked Rare plus, it was perfect! I was surprised how tender it was, the rub does not overpower the meat, very nice. Also got a lobster tail on the side. It was small but cooked perfectly. It came parmesan crusted which I think is too strong a topping.

I rarely comment on crummy service but our server seemed more ready to clean up and leave as opposed to serving. He rarely came by but when he did he asked if I needed another drink and simply left. Yes I did want another drink. 

Ordered:
the chopped salad which is supposed to come with avocado. Our entire salad had one tiny piece of avocado.  Asked for easy dressing. It was loaded.

The salmon was way over glazed with teriyaki sauce. It was like eating candy.

The wild rice was clearly old. Had several dried out pieces of rice and was overly greasy/oiled to possibly give new life to &#34;old were closing soon&#34; rice. 

The sautéed mushrooms were spot on.

We got there about 4:30ish with no reservation and they told us it would be over an hour. We grabbed a buzzer, a drink, and a stool and thought no way this would be an hour. Boy were we wrong. In all fairness they told us the time and we chose to wait but we didn&#39;t get seated until about 6pm. What bothered us most was that people walking in (also without reservations) were getting seated before us. 

Finally we get brought to our table and were admittedly hangry. The room they put us in was a sardine can with felt like hundreds of sardines squeezed in. I mean I understand you do a good business but Christ give your patrons some elbow room. Which brings me to service. It was meh. They were completely understaffed and it was obvious. Our server was rushing around acting as if we were one of her 50 tables, which we probably were. Drinks took long, bread took long. When she rushed back with the bread she ended up dropping it on our table, massacring one of the butters and left onion seeds everywhere. We didn&#39;t care, we ate it right off the table. Although at this point I think we would have eaten shoe leather.

Food was good when we finally got it. My sisters both tried the seafood platter which was delicious. I went with the filet which was cooked perfectly. Tip: get the bernaise sauce...it really adds to it. Lastly my mother got the lamb chops. She was most excited for the mint jelly that accompanied it, but upon arriving, was saddened to see it served with chimichurri. Wtf? That&#39;s an odd coupling. My sweet mother asked the waitress and she did in turn bring her the mint jelly she was originally promised. But guess what...that also took awhile.

All in all I give wildfire Oakbrook a big EHHH. Make reservations if you&#39;re dying to eat here, but be prepared to be sitting on top of strangers. My fav part of the experience was hanging with my awesome fam, which we could have done at home....with a pizza....and saved a lot of money. Live and learn."

Wildfire was a perfect choice; fantastic steaks with a mildly upscale setting.  The atmosphere was busy, but not rushed in the least, and the service was personal without being pushy.  The prices were reasonable for a steakhouse, as well; around $100 for two dinners and drinks.  This may be my go-to for a nice, celebratory meal.

Located directly next to Nieman Marcs in the sprawling complex of Oakbrook Court, Wildfire was a very welcoming spot, and popular as well.  We had reservations for a Monday night, and the place was packed.  It is sort of loud inside, but not so bad where you can&#39;t hold a conversation with your guests.  The ambiance is nice, reminiscent of a 1920s NY steakhouse,

The food and drink, for the most part was fantastic.  I started out with a Stormy Night martini, which was a mildly sweet and flowery concoction that was perfect for sipping while waiting for my French onion soup.  The soup was by far the best I&#39;ve ever had.  It was baked to a golden brown perfection, and was made with what I&#39;m guessing was veal stock.  I wish that bowl never had to come to an end!  For my entree, I had a horseradish crusted NY strip cooked rare, with an added grilled shrimp skewer, and rice pilaf as my side choice.  The steak was simply magical, the shrimp pretty standard, but the rice was not all that great (it has couscous, peas, and carrots mixed into it), and I sort of regretted not going for a double baked potato instead.  For dessert we shared a trio plate, which were small versions of three desserts, just enough to share. I know there was some sort of Snickers pie on the plate, but I was too smitten with the key lime pie to really care about anything else!"

It had that smokey test to it.  We had great service, our waiter was always around and took the time to explain everything.  I highly recommend a trip here"

I had the crusted filet trio and ate my entire plate. My husband had the New York strip and also loved it. The food is expensive, but it is worth every penny.

When our server asked if we wanted dessert I said we had to pass so we could eat nasty year old wedding cake. He came back with our bill and said our bottle of wine was on the house as an anniversary gift. It was so thoughtful and was a great finishing touch on a delicious meal."

I typically go to the one in Lincolnshire and absolutely love it! Yesterday, I happened to be in Oakbrook and stopped in at this wildfire for lunch. My party of 3 was seated fast in a nice, comfortable booth. Our server (wish I remembered his name) was very friendly and super professional though out the whole meal. He also had a great sense of humor. Also, he 100 percent understood our addiction to that cornbread and even gave us some to take home. Props to that excellent waiter. Aside from the service, the food was great too ( as usual). We all started with the Baked French onion soup. Let me just say, that was the best French onion soup I&#39;ve had. The Swiss and asiago cheese are melted perfectly on top and taste like heaven. For my entree, I shared the wildfire chopped salad. Seriously, if you&#39;ve been to wildfire and never ordered that salad, I&#39;m seriously judging you. That is the BEST salad. I dream about the salad...I mean cmon, who actually craves salads? The mixings are awesome- roasted chicken, avocado, tomatoes, blue cheese, bacon crumbles, scallions, corn, and tortilla strips. Whatever you do, always order that salad when you come dine here! Another plus to this restaurant is that it is pretty reasonable for a steakhouse. That being said, I love you Wildfire."

We were 15 minutes late to our reservation (this damn weather needs to quit!) but were still seated promptly. Waters appeared seconds later, as did our waitress. The place is a little crowded, a little loud, but the atmosphere is cheery and warm. It created a cozy vibe.

I ordered the white wine flight ($11.25) because  I was feeling fancy, and it actually ends up being a pretty good deal- by the end of it it&#39;s like having 2 glasses of wine over 4 samples, but no single glass of wine on the menu was less than $7. Score!! Their sauvignon blanc option was my fav!

Complementary bread was served, which was fresh and mostly warm. We kind of wanted to take the extra home, but they took it away at the end (should&#39;ve asked to wrap it up!)

I ordered the medallion trio, cooked medium. They have about 8 crust options to choose from, so I chose parmesan, double-baked potato and mushroom. My date swapped the mushroom for bernaise. The parmesan was cheesy and buttery, the potato one was bacon-y and delicious, and the mushroom tasted like delicious thanksgiving stuffing! Yummmmmm. I had a small forkful of my date&#39;s bernaise topping- bold spice flavor, but not a flavor I was familiar with. It was his fav, though. I was happy with my 3 choices, the potato topping being the best. The meat was cooked less than medium though, and a little rare for my taste. 

The meat came with a side so I opted for MORE potatoes- au gratin to be specific. Super cheesy, decadent, with a charred (in a good way) top. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t calorie check any of this food before I ate it... it was definitely as rich in calories as it was in flavor!

Their desserts looked as amazing as can be, but there was no room for dessert. Maybe next time. Can anyone tell me how they &#39;freeze dry&#39; or whatever it is they do to the desserts (dry ice, hair spray??)? They have to be real food, right? But the ice cream sits out all night and never melts. This was a hot topic of discussion over dinner. 

Service remained friendly and consistent throughout the entire meal. 

One tip, if taking home leftovers of something in a sauce- pay attention. They scooped a lot of the sauce into my leftover box, and my distracted self didn&#39;t realize. I ended up with a hole in the paper bag,  which the potatoes fell out of (they stayed in their container, thank goodness!) and a mess on my coat. That&#39;s my fault, not theirs though. 

Thanks for the fancy evening, wildfire!"

I had the filet medallion trio with the signature crusts parmesan, blue cheese, and béarnaise. I chose the mashed potatoes for my side and was an awesome experience, the best mashed potatoes I&#39;ve ever ordered. The atmosphere is very pleasant and inviting.

Now that they are bigger, they can get food from the kids&#39; menu.

I ordered a chicken club sandwhich, w/ fries.
Food was warm as expected, but I took a few bites in my sandwhich... The chicken was thick and super chewy. Almost like that rubbery feeling... WTF, if I&#39;m paying almost $15 for a burger, the meat should be high quality. It really grossed me out.

The side of fries was like nothing, for how much I payed. I&#39;d rather go to smash burger for something like this - and pay half the price. Really disappointed. Especially since the bag says &#34;anti biotic free&#34; chicken, when this tasted fake. Unbelievable how people spend so much money on food like this."

I ordered the half chicken (I think it was garlic and herb) with a side of mashed potatoes. They were both very tasty and cooked perfectly. The staff was great and quick. Hardly a wait on the food. We got cheesecake with berries and that was probably the worst cheesecake I&#39;ve ever had. I couldn&#39;t eat more than a few bites. Something tasted off about it and it was very dense.

Of the 6 or 7 times I&#39;ve been here, not once have I had a bad meal/dining experience.  The food is always impeccable and the service is typically top-notch.  TGIF dinner here on Good Friday (4/3/15) was no exception.

The interior has a decidedly warm feel to it, posh without being overtly snobbish.  I like the &#39;open kitchen&#39; design, and several of my favorite restaurants feature this (here&#39;s looking at you, Claim Jumper).  The low lighting environs set the mood perfectly for this upscale chophouse.  Our server wasn&#39;t particularly engaging, but he knew his stuff and took fine care of us.

On my most recent excursion here I went all-surf-no-turf: shrimp &amp; crab bisque to start, then the seafood sampler--which came with cedar-planked salmon in a bbq glaze, a jumbo lump crabcake, and two large coconut shrimp.  I got scalloped potatoes as my side, no complaints there.  The cocktail I ordered was made with jalapeno-infused tequila, ginger beer, fresh lime and a chipotle sugar rim (something reminiscent of a moscow mule, I think).

Other times I&#39;ve had the filet medallion trio with bernaise, hollandaise, and blue cheese crust, which was to-die for.  All their cuts of meat are USDA prime, I believe, so the quality is uncompromised.  Nothing here is cheap, but if you&#39;re considering a dinner date you probably already know this.  $$$ / $$$$ easily.

Highly recommended for special occasions, because let&#39;s face it--our budgets realistically allow exemplary meals like this only once in a great while."

Reservations were for 5:00 pm i was seated in less than a minute. The crowd was IMMENSE. Wildfire seats all the walk ins at the bar the wait was 2 hours on a Saturday. The clientele is affluent with kids galore thinking the place is a day care. Many soccer moms in sweats just coming in for a salad.
I ordered a porter house which was ok with a peppery taste. The side I picked was fries which were average. We also ordered steak 3 medallions which were encrusted with cheese also OK. The cream of spinach tasted microwaved.
I did love the onion bread at the start of the meal with actual butter.
ordered a Mojito BIG mistake a glass of Vodka with leaves sent it back ASAP.

The waiter was on point and pushed for the medallions also always filled up cup of water.

Over all if you want a special night I would go elsewhere in Oak Brook, unless you love crowds of kids being loud and moms not tending to their children on their IPHONES. 
Go to the listed.

He gets nervous with trying new places, fearing there&#39;s going to be a cross-contamination because he has such severe reactions to gluten. When we got there, he chickened out and decided to forgo eating entirely. He just feared they didn&#39;t take GF as seriously as he needs them to. 

We had 4 out of 5 from our party there. BIL is not from Chicago and arriving from Midway. --Google maps was not his friend last night. But because he was running late, they wouldn&#39;t seat our party. By 9 pm we were starving and forced to wait in the entrance. This BUGGED.  I would have been happy with just a freaking glass of water. 

What I tried and what I liked: Chopped salad. I liked the chopped salad. I didn&#39;t love it like Morton&#39;s or Ruth&#39;s Chris&#39;. But I did like it. The wontons were a different addition but they worked. 

Salmon. I nearly always order salmon. They didn&#39;t ask me how I wanted it prepared. I like my salmon on the slightly underside of medium. It was cooked more than I prefer but certainly not overcooked. 

BIL had the pork chop. He said it was one of the best he&#39;s had. Cooked perfectly. Great flavor. 

Daughter ordered coconut shrimp. It drives me nuts when she orders fried food, but I digress. She loved it. A lot. 

Husband ordered the 10 oz filet. It came sitting on a piece of toast. Very, very weird to me. 

Banana Coconut Cream Pie delivered. I don&#39;t normally eat things like that. --Gotta maintain the waistline! ;) It was worth the splurge. Gooey crust that was like a better version of a mounds candy bar, banana cream piled high and perfectly sweetened, generous amount of toasted coconut. Worth every calorie.  

If I&#39;m doing some shopping in the area, I&#39;d return but I would never go out of my way to eat here. Although, their banana cream pie might tempt me."

This past weekend we went for the husband&#39;s big three-six (holy crap he&#39;s old!) and the experience was as lovely as ever.

This past time, I had an amazing extraordinarily dirty gin martini (that&#39;s actually how I ordered it... Classy, I am not) and the french onion soup to begin. This french onion soup is out of this world. My mom has begged for the recipe for ages because I love it so much, to no avail. I know it must have sherry wine in it but the rest remains a mystery. Magic? Who knows, but I love it. 

For entrees we all chose the filet medallion trio, accompanied by three delicious crusts of your choosing (horseradish, parmesan, and bleu cheese for this gal) and a side (I went all out with the double stuffed baked potato for a little extra coin and a lot of extra gluttony). The steak is consistently melt in your mouth tender and cooked to perfection. The medallions are small, but the meat is very rich and I am consistently stuffed upon ordering this special. The baked potato doesn&#39;t exactly taste hand crafted and home cooked, but it&#39;s loaded with cheddar flavor and gets the job done.

I love that they bring out a small molten chocolate cake for the birthday boy or gal, but don&#39;t make a horrific show of singing aloud. I know a lot of the reviews here state that their air of class is all smoke and mirrors, and maybe I&#39;m fooled by it, but I do think they do chain restaurants in a more sophisticated manner than the standard chain establishments, and find that the Wildfire and Maggiano&#39;s of the world are sort of a nice middle ground between Chili&#39;s and Morton&#39;s - you can sure spend a lot, but it can be worthwhile, too."

I must say the atmosphere was hip and the entire restaurant was alive...filled with lots of happy faces and sounds on a Friday night! We had a reservation and got seated right away. The staff was very attentive, even though it was very busy that night. They even honored a special request and brought out the flourless chocolate cake with a candle on it to make the anniversary celebration more special!

All of the items on the menu were great, except for one, hence the 4 stars. We started with the spinach and artichoke fondue and 2 of the oven baked pizzas (all were very good). I ended up getting the scallops, which were delicious. Two of my family members did order the tavern fish sandwich, and this was a huge disappointment. The fish was not fresh, and it had a very unpleasant odor. I would describe it as the frozen battered fish you get a supermarket, but the taste and smell was about 10 times worse than that. Maybe it was just an odd day for the fish sandwich, but I would definitely stay away from that the next time we go.

Other than that, do visit Wildfire in Oak Brook for a very high quality dining experience.I will definitely be returning!"

They sit us in a booth with the air conditioner right above us!  It was pretty disappointing having cold air blown on you for 2.5 hours! 

So.. To start this has been one of the longest dinners I have ever had! I loved being with my friends but the service was incredibly slow! Not sure if they were short staffed but it was pretty ridiculous! 

It took 20 minutes to bring out 3 drinks. 2 of the 3 drinks were wine. It doesn&#39;t take too long to pour wine into a glass. 

Next.. We put in an appetizer for the chopped salad! It took about a half hour to receive that! The chopped salad was delicious though! No complaint on the food! Amazing salad! However.. By the time we have finished our salad our waitress still didn&#39;t take our dinner order! 

Finally... I ordered the filet trio! It was cooked medium just the way I like my meat! This is a great option for an entree! The Filets were tender and full of flavor. I also ordered the side of roasted vegetables which was a plus!  

Dessert.. Again took about 30 minutes to just order! We had the carrot cake which was fabulous! 

Overall.. Food was great.. Service was slow slow slow! 

I will be back.. But hopefully next time my 3 star review can change into 4 stars!"

Steak anywhere is not cheap and this place might be a little more expensive than a Long Horn steak but totally worth the $$$. The flavor is impeccable (which does not hold a light to a LH steak)  and that salad- yum-O! Couldn&#39;t resist. Had to mention the salad again.

0 star for the service!!! 
There was an Asian waitress who was rude and inpatient ONLY to us. She talked to tables next us with manners and look at them when talking. I think it is very important when u LOOK at others when talking other than LOOK up to the cling or LOOK outside windows! But she just looked around when talking all the time. 
Then, there are no foxes and knives in our table and we politely request once, however, it did not work, then we request twice. Fine, it did not work neither. Then we had to ask for those things from another waiter who was very nice and gentle.
We were very happy to have the dinner and try to forget the poor service.
What made us more angry is when we finished our dinner and checked. The waitress came and gave us the bill, saying&#34; guys, just select one of them( pointing three suggested gratuities below the bill)&#34;, well, even we have Asian appearance, we KNOW one should pay the gratuities in restaurant to thank for being well treated by the waiter or waitress! And why we are treated so differently with rudeness?!!!!! Although we were angry, we paid the gratuity and my friend said to me he felt sorry and would never come to this restaurant in oak brook mall again."

We started out with the Wood oven baked pretzels and oven roasted crab cakes as an appetizer. They were both very good and was excellent way to start our meal.

Now for the main course I had a petite NY Strip Steak. I agree it was petite compared to their regular cut but it was still rather hearty in and of itself and was a great size considering we had appetizers. It was very flavorful and cooked exactly the way I wanted it!

The service was great from the time we walked in to the time we left. Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable.

I fI had to find a negative and this is a stretch, but it just seemed that the dining room was very cramped but that was not a big deal to me at all as every table was full"

The service rushed did not even bother with a beverage order  The food was served sporadically I received my soup and salad five minutes before the other two people in my party were served. Then they brought the entrees to them instead of the French onion soup. The entrees set at the table and were cold by the time they were eaten.  I thought I asked for a new car when I inquired about dessert. I asked for Creme Brûlée and the waitress rolled her eyes up into her forehead like I had asked the dumbest question in the world. Wow Rude, lazy, distracted and no personality.  

The food was very disappointing. The Coconut shrimp were tasteless very limp and so small. I remember when they served Jumbo Butterfly shrimp these were small disgusting. The salad disappointed. Remember when hearts of Palm were included. The lettuce was wilted in the Caesar salad and the dressing was barely there. The server did not even offer fresh ground pepper. Poor food quality. Poor execution. No attention to serving no attention to temperature   And the decor is twenty years old needs updating. You are not number one anymore. You were the standard of excellence that other steakhouses looked up to, too bad you are just another disappointment .  Not coming back:("

Perhaps I need to stick with a restaurant&#39;s signature item when I order to truly enjoy the meal.  The porterhouse was certainly at the bottom of my Chicago area steak list.  That ranking is not due to my overcooked and re-fired steak either.  

Wildfire is simply not the place for the best steak.  It was a moist steak on the filet side and dry on the strip side.  The flavoring, however, was bland.  For a flavorful topping, you must pay extra for a sauce or crust.  

The service was great.  The management and servers work to ensure that the customer is satisfied.   Their attentiveness was worth the 19% tip.

My wife enjoyed the martini flight.  The flourless chocolate cake was decent, and acceptable as free.  I would never pay for it."

There were probably like 10-15 orders and this restaurant is literally across the street from our bldg. We did not get our food until 7:45pm. That&#39;s 2 hours and 15 minutes!!! Most of us had already finished our work by like 6 and were just sitting around waiting for the food! I heard one of the reasons things were held up was because we ordered garlic fries from probably an old menu and they spent a lot of time trying to figure out what to do since they didn&#39;t have any??? Anyway, that was TERRIBLE customer service!!!

As for the food, I ordered a prime rib dip with garlic fries. Of course, I just got regular fries because they do not know how to sprinkle garlic powder on them. The pickle that came with my dip was terrible! I bit into it and told my hubby it was disgusting. And he was like &#34;But that&#39;s always your favorite part!&#34; and it&#39;s true, it usually is! Then my coworker bit into his and said &#34;This pickle is terrible.&#34; ... so it wasn&#39;t just me, I didn&#39;t even tell him it was gross. We have never had a bad pickle from a restaurant before! Then my coworker said it was the worst prime rib dip he ever had and he didn&#39;t even want to finish it. He kept complaining about how bad it was and he rarely complains about food! I agree though, it was pretty bad. Also, they did not give us any au jus to DIP our prime rib DIP into! C&#39;mon!!

That was clearly terrible take out service. Now for dine in service...

I made a reservation for 6 people at 5pm on a Sunday evening. It was packed! We got seated within 10 minutes. But overall, the service was super slow because they were soooo busy. 

As for the food- the complementary bread is really good. There is a white onion bread and brown raisin bread. This was a hit with my family!

I got the Bison Burger with French Fries. I honestly really did not like this burger- the bread was really weak and kept breaking into little pieces- the bison was crumbly and tasteless- overall, I just did not like it. Lesson learned to not get a bison burger at a steakhouse! The fries were good though! My sister also got the Bison Burger and she said it was okay.

My husband got the Bison Trio with fries- he said it was OK.

My cousin got the Petite Filet Mignon with Au Gratin (Cheesy potato circle slices) Potatoes. He said it was really good!

My dad go the Filet Mignon with Au Gratin Potatoes. He also said it was really good. However, his Regular Filet Mignon was the exact same size as my cousin&#39;s Petite Filet Mignon. Very disappointing and not worth the extra $5!

My mom got the Steak Sandwich with French Fries and said it was good! Phew!

Side note- my sister and husband and I all agree that the pickles are completely tasteless- it taste like a weird cucumber instead of a salty delicious pickle! Note my complaint about the pickles in my take out experience too!"

Nobody greeted us. We had to ask for a menu. After getting our drink 15 minutes later, the server/bartender  didn&#39;t ask if we were ready to order our food. We asked for the manager. He apologized for the Bartender&#39;s lack of attentiveness &amp; he took our order. This place SUCKS! The bartender was rude to the servers.

John was our server and even though it was pretty crowded I felt like an important food critic. I was given star treatment. The French onion soup was so delicious and the prime rib
 with horseradish sauce was fatty but in a GOOD way. I also had the mushroom crusted pork chops, whoa they melted in my mouth. I definitely would return for a special occasion or &#34;just because&#34;."

You can tell just by the name it&#39;s going to have a western, wooden-beamed, fireplace look and feel, and it does.  Appetizers were fine, calamari and shrimp cocktails; plus their French onion soup is apparently memorable, although I didn&#39;t try it. 

Steaks for everyone were excellent, I had the bone-in 12 oz. filet and it was a stellar cut of beef; the sides were pretty good, no complaints here (creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin), but also definitely not on par with Ruth Chris or Jeff Ruby&#39;s sides.  

Desserts were really wonderful: fresh fruit, hot fudge sundaes, and the pie trio were all good (or at least looked good), no issues and really a treat.

The only missing component was the 3-star mediocre service; clearly not trained to dote on their clients, they&#39;d never have gotten more than 15% from me, but I wasn&#39;t paying the bill.  Overall somewhere between a 3 &amp; 4, but since the service was so mediocre I&#39;m giving it a 3.  Call me Mr. Miser but if a steak is 42 bucks I want better than Ponderosa-style service.  They need to step up their levels of dining service."

I don&#39;t recall us having ever said wow this is great we ought to get it next time.  It is never outright bad but is only occasionally good in a dish here or there.

My boyfriend usually brings us to steak houses because i like steaks and he doesn&#39;t. While i didn&#39;t enjoy the steak too much but loved the french onion soup and lobster tail. I was happy we were able to go to a restaurant that we both enjoyed.

Her friends said that this as normal at this restaurant in high demand.  Once we were seated, we ordered our dinner- I had the scallops and my fiancée had the seafood platter.  We thought the seafood platter was good except the crab cake was so-so.  My scallops were by far better than her bacon-wrapped scallops.  At the end, our waiter offered dessert but we were too full.  He did treat us since we were going to get married soon and our friends just got married.  So, we got a chocolate lava-cake which was really rich and good.  Nice way to end a fancy dinner:)  Price was kinda steep.  Plan to spend around $50 per person which included drinks."

I ordered the Avalon seafood platter that had salmon, coconut shrimp, crab cakes and bacon-wrapped scallops.  My friend had shrimp pasta newburg and the spinach salad but he had previously been to the restaurant and had their steak, which he absolutely loved.

Apparently steak is their specialty because the seafood was a fail.  First of all, every single item on the platter was garnished with some ridiculous sauce and each had a different type of sauce. I don&#39;t mind sauces but I don&#39;t want there to be so much that it takes away from the flavor of the seafood.  The crab cakes were horrible...they had all types of crap in them and way too much mayo. I mean who needs corn, peppers, mayo and green onions in a crab cake?! It&#39;s not crab salad!  Anyway, I was equally underwhelmed with the cedar plank salmon, the sauce on it just overpowered the flavors that you&#39;re supposed to get from the cedar plank salmon.  The best thing going on with this dish was the bacon wrapped scallops and the coconut shrimp, they were good and I&#39;d order those separately again. I ordered a side of grilled mixed vegetables and they were okay.

My friend was extremely underwhelmed with is Newburg...I tried it and we both swear it was like eating Chef Boyardee.  It was like canned pasta sauce.

The absolute best thing about the evening was dessert! Dinner, 2 stars, dessert 4 stars! We ordered the chocolate cake and the peanut butter pie...it was great, freshly prepared and not too heavy.

To sum it up, go there for the steak and dessert...skip the seafood!

UPDATE 11/20/15: So after I wrote my original review, I received a note from the Restaurant&#39;s Manager asking if I would be willing to speak to them on the phone about my experience.  WAY TO GO customer service! I write my reviews because I want to give an honest assessment of my experience in the most objective manner possible and I&#39;m never trying to be malicious so I really appreciate it when people actually make an attempt to use feedback!  Anyway after talking to them and sharing my detailed thoughts about everything, they were ultra receptive and willing to share my thoughts with their Chef. I&#39;m convinced my experience with the crab cake is a regional thing because I had similar sentiments about a crab cake I had the night before at another restaurant.  Anyway, I am also convinced this restaurant is serious about quality and service so I absolutely would go back when in Chicago to give them another try.  The icing on the cake is that they sent me a gift certificate, which is further incentive for me to go back!  Thank you for your commitment to service and satisfaction so I&#39;m upgrading my review from a 3 to 4 stars."

First off the young lady who sat us was unpleasant. When we thanked her for getting us a booth she looked at us like were crazy. Ok great start! Then our server was rude. Not attentive very short with us could not be bothered. When we asked another waitress for assistance she proceeded to be short with us. The kicker came at the end when one of my dining companions, who I should mention is an older lady in her 60s asked for a plastic to go cup for her drink and the served almost ripped her head off. Like he was offended that she asked for a plastic to go cup for her Shirley Temple and he proceed to be short and snap at her. Um who snaps at an old lady?!? It was such an unpleasant meal we rushed through our burgers and headed out. On my way out I spoke to the lady at the hostess stand about the servers. On top of all that the food was just mediocre."

Absolutely nothing special about it and will not order that again if I were to ever return.  Service could have been better. When I made reservations I had mentioned it was my bfs bday but did they care? Nopes. Most of the higher end restaurants would have at least acknowledged it. And where we were seated was horrible. I felt like I could see what everyone was doing. We sat in a booth in the bar area. It was super crowded and noisy. Definitely did not get that romantic dinner ambience I was going for.

They sat us in the bar; now, this has never happened to me before and I did  not like it. It was a cramped booth, way too loud and I feel like you don&#39;t get enough attention from the server.

I started with the house salad, which is always a good choice here. I then got the filet medallion trio, which is usually what  I get here. I got the horseradish crust, the parmasean crust and the bleu cheese crust. I also upgraded my side to the double baked potato. I asked that my steaks be very well done and it was still slightly pink, but I ate it anyway. The potato was HUGE! I could have shared with my whole table.

The only reason why I give it 2 stars is the fact that I cut my thumb on a piece of glass from their glass (which I showed the waitress) and they only offered me a band aid and a fresh drink. The manager didn&#39;t come over and talk to me and there was nothing comped on the check (they could have at least comped my diet coke). I as expecting more from Lettuce Entertain you.. maybe I will go to one of their many other places next time. 

Food was excellent.. Bison burger, halibut, bean burger, tomato soup... but dang the management"

It used to be great, but now very watery. I&#39;m sure someone upstairs was looking at short term profits on this one. I had the filet mignon that was cooked well and a lot more flavorful and tender than I remember! The decor is getting some wear to it. I&#39;m not sure there has been much updating in last 15 years. I get the feeling Wildfire has become a second tier steakhouse in all regards."

Apparently, to secure such a large table (which actually ended up being two tables and we couldn&#39;t all sit together) we had to pay an &#34;event&#34; fee of which I believe was 5% of our bill. My friend also had to pre-order some appetizers, which I thought was unnecessary because we all would have probably ordered more individually than the minimum that our contact told her we had to order.

We also only had one waiter for both tables. He did his best but we obviously needed a second person helping out. On one occasion my side salad came with the wrong dressing so he took the wrong one, leaving me with a plain salad, and never came back with the right dressing. I finally had to ask a bus boy after about 10 minutes. Another time, when our food arrived, a friend didn&#39;t have any utensils and again asked our waiter for a set. We ended up taking a set off another table but the waiter never did come back with utensils for her.

The food was good but because they wanted us served all at the same time none of our food was hot or even warm when we got it. Gross. It also took us 2  1/2 hours to have our entire meal, I think in large part because the service was so slow in only having one waiter and because the organization of appetizers, sides, entrees was off.

I definitely would not recommend this place for a large group, they don&#39;t seem able to handle it."

A completely burned entree was brought to our table.  A server (not ours) noticed this and said, &#34;this is not right&#34;.  He took it back to the kitchen.  After a short wait a new entree was brought by our original server.  He apologized and left.  When our bill arrived, it had TWO charges on it.  One for the burnt entree and another for the replacement.  Another apology and a new bill was delivered. I am a long term customer here and I will return sometime in the future.

Wildfire&#39;s thick prime angus burger on house made sesame bun. Oh man, for real, so good. It basically cost the same as a burger from Chili&#39;s, but just melts in your mouth like you paid it to. 

Also, the apple pie with vanilla bean ice cream drizzled with caramel... I would eat you for breakfast, lunch and dinner but, dang it, society would judge me.

As far as service, just stupendous. Our server was sarcastic and hilarious. He was straight up with us about the dishes he would and wouldn&#39;t recommend and was all around an entertaining server. I wish I remembered his name because he was an asset to Wildfire and deserved recognition.

Wildfire, I&#39;d be back but I&#39;m a city girl. The suburbs scare me as much as the minivans in them. Open a chain downtown and you&#39;ll have a hungry ginger at our doorstep."

Since they&#39;re from Austin and not familiar with the culinary adventures of Oak Brook, they left it up to us. I instantly suggested Wildfire because, as I wrote in my previous review, this is a fantastic place. 

I was in a pasta mood, so of the 4 lunch pastas I asked the waiter for his recommendation. I was honestly leaning toward the spaghetti and bison meatballs, but he steered me toward the shrimp penne. As he named off the soup options, my interest was piqued as he mentioned the shrimp and lobster bisque. Definitely my favorite soup ever, so my meal was destined to go into the &#39;seafood overload&#39; category. The bisque had corn, beans and nice chunks of seafood in it. Chunkier than I normally like my bisque but all of the flavors were coagulated and mixed together perfectly.

Although shrimp and penne seems like such a simple dish -- you know it&#39;s simple if I can make it at home -- it was very good in a simple and uncomplicated way. The sauce was delicious, as was the corn and peppers that added to the overall texture of the food.

My dining partners went with the lunch portion of prime rib, fish, coconut shrimp and a burger. You seriously can&#39;t go wrong with anything that you order. Everything really IS that good."

Unfortunately things at the restaurant have gone down hill. The martinis are still delicious, even though the bartender had to fish some debris (fruit not in the martinis) out of my glass with a straw... Um gross get me a new one. Service was slow and unfriendly. I excitedly announced we were there to celebrate or engagement and the server stared at me blankly- what can I say I was excited, can you fake some enthusiasm. The steaks came out luke warm and not cooked to our request. It was 90 degrees out and we were seated in a booth near the kitchen and my fiancée was sweating, I also was hot. I felt sad that a night of celebration ended with my fiancée saying I can&#39;t wait to get out of here. The best thing about the night was the goat cheese appetizer."

Table was sticky although it had been wiped. Waitress brought wrong wine but was pleasant. Noise level was incredibly unpleasant. Summing it up - rather than a nice and enjoyable lunch with two good friends who meet up a couple times a year - it was an awful experience. Surprising to me as Lettuce has so many other better restaurants (even 2 at least on this strip in OakBrook, which is a parking nightmare in this location. Will not return."

It was for BF&#39;s birthday. I am not a steak eater and he deserved a good steak to celebrate his birthday. In making the reservation, I requested a candle in a steak or a cake. NOTE: They will not candle up a steak. I am not sure. Maybe wax all over the steak is unappealing to some. Maybe it changes the cooking style. I am not sure. I was mildly disappointed. I had hoped for a candle in his steak and being able to take a picture to send to my mom who is as big of a steak fan as I.

We had the oven baked soft pretzels as an app. They were yummz. I was hoping for pretzel sticks but these were two soft pretzels. They were fairly salty and arrived with a beer cheddar sauce and honey mustard. I ate half of mine and enjoyed it thoroughly.

I ended up ordering the shrimp and penne sans corn. It was pretty fantastic. The weird thing is that it comes with a side. My experience with ordering pasta anywhere is that it doesn&#39;t come with a side. I went with the cottage fries which was an abnormal side to go with a pasta. In my defense, at least it wasn&#39;t a mashed potato! 

Because I informed them of BF&#39;s birthday, they brought him out a free cake with a candle. It was a nice follow-up to his steak and belvidere martini. He appreciated it. I had a bite and it was delicious.

It was dark and fairly loud. When we got out of there at 7:30, the place was packed with what looked like at least a 45 minute wait to be seated on a Thursday night. Try for a reservation. It has that old school steakhouse feel. I think I even saw martini flights on their menu!

Please note that this isn&#39;t a cheap meal. Granted, if you are eating in Oak Brook, there really aren&#39;t a whole lot of cheap eats. This, however, was especially nice and not the norm for us."

Everything you normally order in the AM is here from pancakes to skillets to chicken and waffles. Everything is reasonably priced and delicious. They serve fresh squeezed OJ and . Small courteous staff.

Despite the Blueberry Hill themed pancake house, I find the pancakes to be too mushy once you add syrup. They crumble with no structure and become baby food essentially. 

The servers are friendly and fairly attentive."

I&#39;ve been here about 5 times now and every time has been enjoyable. I&#39;ve tried their skillets, pancakes, sandwiches, coffee, fresh juice, you name it - all fabulous.

The staff is always super friendly and very on top of it. There&#39;s been a couple times we&#39;ve had to wait for a table because they were so busy, but never more than 10 minutes. You get a lot of food for the price which is nice (awkward, that rhymed). Another perk is that you can get breakfast or lunch at any time of the day! BOOM. This is great for people like me who may or may not crave French fries and iced coffee at 10 am (that&#39;s normal, right?).

My husband and I have also taken advantage of there carry out option. It&#39;s awesome for those busy work days when you wake up and maybe just have a taste for blueberry pancakes...

They open up super early so it&#39;s easy to place your order online. Typically food is ready in 15 minutes ish and then you can just pop on over to pick it up and start your day off right!

I highly recommend checking this place out. I most definitely will be adding to this review as I continue to explore their ginormous menu!"

It&#39;s ur basic small little breakfast and lunch diner. It was super quite when we walked in. We were seated and our waitress asked us for our order before I had even cracked open the menu. About 2 mins later she comes back and we&#39;re both clearly noses in our menus and said we needed a few more minutes. Well unfortunately she came back like every 2 minutes until we finally got annoyed and rushed with our order. (No joke she did this like 5 times, if my menu is in my face I&#39;m probably not finished) our food came out rather quickly and everything was super bland and Luke warm. The fruit was all dried out and discolored. The crepes tasted like they made them in bulk and just popped them in the microwave. My boyfriend ordered a skillet and the burnt the hell out of the potatoes and just threw and egg over it, like cool you know that&#39;s not hiding anything right. We were so ready to leave this place. I honestly don&#39;t understand the good reviews here. Glorified nursing home food. Yuk"

I have enjoyed various omelets, skillets, pancakes and other breakfast dishes. Blueberry Hill always delivers quality breakfast entrees. Portions are typically large and prices are about what you&#39;d expect. The breakfasts are so good I&#39;ve never even considered their other menu items, so I can&#39;t comment on those.

On my most recent visit I was also impressed by the quality of the coffee. I don&#39;t know if they have made changes to the coffee they serve since my last visit, but I thought it was definitely a cut above the coffee served in most diners. Highly recommended."

The service was GREAT, but the food was mediocre.....at best. I had blueberry french toast, hashbrowns, eggs, and thick sliced bacon ($2 upcharge). The bacon just wasn&#39;t good......maybe bad quality? The thick sliced bacon at Pancake Cafe could &#34;run circles&#34; around what Blueberry Hill dished out. 

The French toast was.......ok. There was ALOT of the blueberry topping........or &#34;glaze&#34; as our server called it. The blueberry &#34;glaze&#34; seemed to have MUCH more blueberry flavored goop than actual blueberries. The server assured me that fresh blueberries are part of the topping, but I didn&#39;t come across any. The hashbrowns and eggs were.......decent. Their hashbrowns are small chunks of potatoes, which I would have enjoyed had I not come across so many undercooked chunks. Their prices are competitive and they have lots of options on their menu. I don&#39;t know if I came on a bad day or what, but not sure I would try Blueberry Hill again."

We went in expecting typical Chicago suburbs greasy spoon breakfast food, and were blown away by the variety of the menu and just how good everything we ordered was. We had to wait a good 20 minutes for a table getting breakfast in the morning, which I always think is a good sign and never something to complain about- If it wasn&#39;t good, people wouldn&#39;t be waiting, right?

What I liked most about this place is they have whatever you call the style of hash browns that are actual slices of potato instead of the uniformly shredded obviously out of a deep freezer kind of hash browns. The side of pancakes actually tasted like they were freshly made instead of sitting under a heat lamp, and the wait staff was super nice and attentive.

It&#39;s hard to pick a favorite with so many fantastic breakfast places in the Aurora area, but if I had to maintain some kind of short list for the best places, Blueberry Hill Pancake House would definitely be on it."

In 2014, this is not an issue since Marc &#34;The QB Whisperer&#34; Trestman has lost his mind, his team, and as of now, four games on his way to five! 

I&#39;ve been to the Kingery location in Willowbrook/Darien/Downers Grove and had a simliar experience!

This is my neighborhood go-to from now on if I want breakfast or lunch. I love places that have other options besides buttermilk pancakes, so the whole wheat variety here hit the spot! 

As my Yelp friend Angus states, the seating is a bit crammed. I went with the &#34;Create your own&#34; omelette with sun dried tomatoes, onions, and peppers. Fluffy just how I like it! I also got two of the whole wheat pancakes which were standard and some fruit. Pretty solid in my book. 

As much as I would love to try the Oreo or Pumpkin variety of pancakes, I love trying whole wheat blends every where!

Our breakfast before heading to Six Flags Great America had to be filling and tasty since we were trying to minimize paying for overpriced food at the park. We were quickly seated and served by a very courteous server. My wife and I both opted to order the omelette, and according to prior yelp reviews of this place, I was expecting it to be huge (my wife had no idea). Well, it WAS huge for a 3 egg colorado omelette, well stuffed with ham, green peppers and onions. I should&#39;ve split this into 2 meals , leaving one to eat later, but it was really good!

What really impressed me with this place is they offered gluten-free options for pancakes and organic eggs to substitute for regular eggs. For our lifestyle, this was worth paying extra for. The price was no different than other breakfast places in the area (Juicy O, Eggsperience, Pomegranate Cafe, etc..), but knowing what ingredients were used to make your meal is important for those who value their nutrition while dining out.

My wish... restaurants start investing in serving real maple syrup. I&#39;m sure many other will pay extra to enjoy their pancakes with the REAL stuff!"

There was a little bit of a wait.. about 15 minutes, so... not bad. We hadn&#39;t been here in years and wanted to try it again.

There are great breakfast places all over the western suburbs and Blueberry Hill isn&#39;t one of them. It&#39;s a good place.

They food is good and the service is friendly. It lacks some atmosphere and the seating is a tad uncomfortable.

I had the Corned Beef Hash Omelette with cheddar cheese and Lisa had the Avocado, Bacon and Tomato Omelette with cheddar cheese.. We both had potatoes and pancakes (hers were the pumpkin pancakes) Not all of the omelette&#39;s come with cheese, it was an extra on both of ours.

My omelette was good, but not inspiring.. not as flavorful as I would like, but decent. The potatoes were pretty good and the pancakes were A-OK. Lisa was lukewarm on her omelette, thought the potatoes were good but really enjoyed the Pumpkin pancakes. They served them with a  sour cream (?) type sauce that Lisa enjoyed.

All in all, it was exactly what we expected and remembered. We are happy to eat there, but it&#39;s not special and we have a host of other places that we would place ahead of them to go to.

A small victory for this place: flavored creamers. At your table they always have Vanilla, Irish Creme and Hazelnut. HOLLA!

I usually get some sort of skillet. The potatoes they use are diced but are better than your typical diced potatoes. They let you make simple substitutions to your meals, I hate when you can&#39;t change stuff up. 

They also sell fresh baked goods by the front but I&#39;ve never tried anything although it looks tempting.

I had no idea it was so popular. Upon arriving my group and I had to wait for about 10-15 minutes which is completely understandable because for one it was crowded and we also had a group of ten. So I was fine with the waiting. Once our table was ready and we were seated  almost immediately after our waitress was asking what drinks we wanted to order. (Side note our waitress was nice, but she had a rude undertone if that makes any sense. She was passive aggressive. Lol) Anyways she went to get our drinks, I ordered the cranberry juice sense I don&#39;t like milk or orange juice, and it was pretty good! A downside though is that we had these little white mugs (which no one used) but I noticed mine had some black stuff at the bottom. (Um ew) I definitely wasn&#39;t drinking out of that. For breakfast I ordered their chocolate chip pancakes with a side of bacon and I was pretty satisfied with my meal. My cousin had their bacon waffles... Which was interesting. I think we were all satisfied with our meals, of course it wasn&#39;t a jaw- dropping delicious, but it was decent enough. So I can&#39;t complain, after that we talked for a bit, paid and left. It&#39;s funny how fast they get you in and out. I find it interesting on how fast they served our food (A group of 10) mind you, but hey that&#39;s a bonus for them.

Waitress took our order and we asked for napkins/wet wipes for my baby. She came back to bring our food out and the next time we saw her she dropped the check off (about 20 mins after we finished our food) and gave us a super fake &#34;Thank you so much, have a great day&#34;. Someone else offered a coffee refill about 20 minutes after I finished my coffee and just before we ended up leaving. Napkins/wet wipes never showed up, so we had sticky hands on our way home.

The other waitresses seemed to be around enough, but our waitress was hiding out back. I know this because I spent 20 minutes looking for her, first to ask for napkins, then to ask for the check. No manager making rounds, either.

My baby was melting down for the last 10-15 minutes of our visit, so the waitress was actively making my daughter more upset.

This was updated for some typos, and upon further consideration, I deducted a star. I had a miserable experience here. Decent food isn&#39;t good enough."

there is something just plain right about toasts generously topped with bananas, strawberries, and Cap&#39;n Crunch that mere words cannot express. coffee was hot, black, and in good supply; nothing special, but i was enjoying my Cap&#39;n Crunch, so there you go."

I would give 5 Stars for breakfast but only 3 stars for lunch.

Breakfast is 95% of the time very, very good. They make custom made omelettes that are not on the menue. I LOVE their gluten-free pancakes. Before I was gluten-free I thought the whole wheat ones are the best, but now even my friend, who is not gluten-free, prefers those over the whole wheat ones. 
 I eat there at least 2-3 times per week. 
And on sunday you better get up early, because it feels like the whole neighborhood wants to eat there.

Lunch is a little different story. Since I can´t eat their sandwiches, my options are limited. I like their salads, they are fresh and tasty. I had a turkey burger patty that one day, and that was very gross. It just looked like a bad frozen patty and it was not appetizing at all. I complained and they took it back and gave me something else I liked better, and I did not have to pay for the first meal. So that was good.


Amazing for breakfast and so-lala for lunch. I definitely recommend it for breakfast and they will always be my breakfast favorites."

Not this restaurant! I admit, yes, I am better than average at making pancakes, but still! These were single-handedly the worst blueberry pancakes I have ever had! When I received them, I rearranged them like I usually do in a single stack so that they could get equal butter/syrup distribution. As I did this, the pancake on the bottom&#39;s top came off--not a good sign! I went ahead to cut the pancakes and they fell apart. I couldn&#39;t even stick my fork through them. I had to scrape them together in a pile to put them on my fork. When I could finally put a fork full into my mouth, what I suspected was confirmed; they were too dry! I told the waitress and she had me order something else...at my expense. Bacon and eggs were decent...but who can mess that up? When I paid for my meal, the host cashier could really care less and he recited the regular script that he says to every customer. All in all, a big disappointment. I paid $9.90 for the worst pancakes I ever had in a restaurant. You would think that a restaurant called &#39;Blueberry Hill&#39; would have excellent blueberry pancakes!"

Get the king of the hill omelette, which is pretty much breakfast&#39;s version of a supreme pizza, frittata style. The potatoes were not starchy at all and flavors integrated very well. Throw on some hot sauce and you got yourself a breakfast feast. Great service, great coffee, great food.

As is the case every time I want to take my mom here a Saturday or Sunday. 

Fortunately, I did get my chance to check out the place on a weekday after a night of drunken shenanigans. It&#39;s a completely different atmosphere. Weekends are loud, energetic and packed with families. Weekdays are quiet and serene, with only a few customers about the place. I think I like the weekday peacefulness being I&#39;m really a crab-ass in the morning. 

The food here is pretty good. I wasn&#39;t blown away by it. I ordered the stuffed apple French toast, side of bacon and coffee. Once again, good but nothing to write home about. This may be partly my fault because I&#39;m not a &#34;sweets&#34; person in the morn, so ordering a sugary dish probably wasn&#39;t the best choice. Though it was good if you like apples, cream cheese and syrup.

The portions were big. I have a big appetite and I could hardly finish everything. The coffee is a little bit strong so extra cream might be in order. Service was really attentive (of course there were only three other customers in the place).

It&#39;s worth checking out, just probably not with that 40 minute wait on the weekend."

First off, there&#39;s a sign right when you walk in saying all their juice is fresh squeezed, and when we asked our waitress if that was true they said yes. Based on that we got a carafe of oj, but you could literally taste that it was store bought. You how all oj you buy at the store tastes? It definitely was not fresh squeezed at all. I got a breakfast platter (which I think is eggs, bacon and hash browns) and my mom got an omelet along with pancakes. Everything was way too salty, and my hash browns weren&#39;t even cooked all the way. Lastly, the pancakes were a huge disappointment. They fell apart as soon as you touched them and they were way too dry. The service wasn&#39;t bad at all, but we were both seriously unsatisfied with our food.

We have been going to this restaurant for years as a family! And whenever anyone comes from out of town, I don&#39;t let them go back home until they have eaten here! And they always wanna come back!

This cozy, family style, quick service restaurant is a place to have a friendly chat and truly enjoy your breakfast! Once they forgot to put us on a wait list and they felt so bad that we had a 20 minute wait, they gave us 50 percent off! I always add hazelnut creamer to my coffee and share an omelet (they are huge!) The cheese is melted so nicely in the omelet as well as the veges, and same goes with the pancakes! You find the rich fruit inside! YUM!!

The same people have been working there for years, meaning, great service and they are happy there! You won&#39;t take much out of your wallet, and you will leave happy! Not like Ihop or overly expensive breakfast places! :)"

I am kicking myself for walking right past this place so many times and never trying it until today. Luckily, my boyfriend nudged me out of my restaurant rut today and we came here for dinner. 

We started with the chicken satay - super tender and juicy chicken with just the right amount of flavor. However, there were multiple skewers in most of our kebabs (comes with 5 pieces of chicken but they&#39;re held up by like 10 skewers) which made it a little awkward to eat. 

Boyfriend got the spicy chicken paradise. The flavors were ON POINT and the veggies were perfectly cooked. No issue adding broccoli to the dish ($2 extra) for the weirdo broccoli fanatic across from me. I thought the chicken - which was fried - could&#39;ve been a little crispier on the outside, but he didn&#39;t seem to mind. 

I had the massaman curry with chicken and WOW. Sweet, spicy, crunchy, chewy... Amazing flavors from the mix of pineapple, peanut, and potatoes in this curry, and everything was cooked to perfection (I&#39;m so not a fan of things being over- or under-cooked in curries. That totally ruins it!)

We didn&#39;t try desert, but only because we were too full. We both had leftovers, so I&#39;m happy with the portion size. The ambiance was super chill (yay!) so I wouldn&#39;t say this is a first date kind of place but absolutely somewhere to go for a chill dinner that&#39;s still sweet. Service was also extremely kind and attentive. All in all, a wonderful dinner. I&#39;m already looking forward to coming back!!"

I&#39;ve been here several times and the food has always been very tasty.  The service has also been very good and the food comes out quick.  It never has been too busy which makes me think this is a very underrated restaurant.

My biggest complaint is portion size.  Portions are very small compared to other restaurants where an entree is usually enough for 2 good sized meals.  Many Asian restaurants often give you enough for 3 meals.  Considering that the prices are a bit higher than competitors at $10+ for most meals (similar eateries offer entrees at $8-9 and you get more food too), I&#39;m always disappointed when my food comes out and I have just enough to satisfy my appetite for a mere couple hours.  Any less and I would be left feeling hungry, but with the current size you really only get enough for one meal and that is it.  I would dine here (and get takeout too) much more often if I got more value for my dollar.  When I&#39;m spending $12 per entree, I expect at least two good sized servings, not just a tiny scoop of rice and a small serving of entree.  Increase the portion sizes (or decrease the prices...) and you got a 5 star rating!"

So even though usually Thai food is not my favorite genre, I go along. Well! Bangkok Village is the exception for me - sometimes I make hubby really happy by requesting to go for Thai - here. Like most Thai establishments, I can customize my dish so it&#39;s not so sweet, or get it extra spicy, etc. I have a couple of things here that I know I will love, but my current favorite is the Basil Leaf Tofu. The vegetables are fresh and toothsome, the sauce perfectly light and just a tiny bit sweet, and it&#39;s got just the right amount of that scrumptious Thai basil. Oh, and they&#39;ll make it really spicy for me. Yum yum! The presentation is lovely as well. I also enjoy the red curry (they&#39;ll happily cut down on the sweetness for me) and there are probably other things I would order if I could just get that Basil Leaf Tofu out of my head.

The server was not helpful. I asked if they had any noodle bowls, and he answered flatly &#34;no&#34;, with no explanation or suggestions. Even though there&#39;s a &#34;Noodles&#34; category on their online menu...?

It got worse when we complained about the fried tofu appetizer. The tofu was very dry, and the sauce was very very bland. We were polite, explained we&#39;ve happily had it at other Thai restaurants, even apologized. He immediately got defensive, blamed it on us for taking too long to eat it (which wasn&#39;t true because we tried it as soon as it hit the table) and did nothing to compensate, not even an apology. That alone affected my view on the restaurant, but then our dinner came. 

We shared a  Red Curry bowl with tofu, and the Ginger entree. The Ginger was good. But the curry (which was a very small portion for the price) had a very odd aftertaste. Like freezer burn, or just ...old. I soon realized it was the bamboo shoots. They tasted bad. I don&#39;t know what was wrong with them, but they normally have almost no flavor, mostly texture. These were soggy with a distinct bad taste. 

The best aspect of this restaurant for me was the decor. Maybe the meat dishes are good... but I&#39;m a vegetarian. So that door is closed. Overall I was not impressed and do not plan to return."

Maybe it&#39;s the unassuming storefront on Chicago Ave, maybe the fact it&#39;s north of the parking lot, or maybe it&#39;s the fact that nobody in Naperville is obsessed with Thai?  This place is never that busy, yet always manages to deliver consistently delicious Thai food.  I guess this is a good thing for me as I never need a reservation when I go, but I wanted to show them some Yelp love.

I&#39;ve never had a bad dish here.  The curries are all wonderful and completely different from one another.  The Larb salad is a standout- it&#39;s ground chicken with some serious spice served over a salad.  Try it.  They sell Singha Beer here- in 12 and 21 oz bottles.  They have a mediocre wine list but a full bar.

Service is always really friendly and attentive.  I really love this place, so I&#39;m giving 5 stars because they&#39;ve never steered me wrong."

Pad See Ew - I was really looking forward to this dish, but it came out SUPER SALTY, like they used soy sauce to make the noodles brown instead of the pad see ew dish.

Then, it was all new to us and we loved it.  Later as we start to see more places like that pop up all over the suburbs we started to try out those newer places and forgot about Bangkok Village.  So recently, we decided to give them another try.  Now the place is run by a new owner (for the past 10 years) and they have done a great job of maintaining and upgrading the interior.  They have also made the cuisine a lot more authentic Bangkok-style, with some very tasty and spicy dishes.  We were very pleasantly surprised about how fresh and tasty everything was.

I always get basil leaves with ground chicken and an egg roll. You have to make a special request for the ground chicken, but they will make it and it is yummy!! There&#39;s also a $1 up charge for it. I can rarely find a  suburban Thai restaurant that will make the basil leaves dish with ground chicken. My portions are always pretty large and I usually have enough leftover to take home. The food always comes out very quickly as well. 

I like the decor, but it can start getting a little cozy in there if you add a good 15 people to the dining room. So, for right now, this is my go-to Thai restaurant here in Naperville and I recommend them."

It&#39;s a quaint joint with only 13 tables, many just seating 2-tops. But man, oh man is the food delish. Left the toddler with his grandparents for the evening and wanted to try a place that I knew would not be toddler-friendly. While there were definitely children in there (with refined palates!), they weren&#39;t screeching hot-dog throwers like our son is known to be.

We had no reservation, but they do take them. With so few tables, I recommend it, especially if you want to come at a popular hour.

We started with their house salad because I was intrigued by the dressing she described to be made from beets and that is listed as an item to buy to-go on the menu (of which I don&#39;t like whole, but I&#39;ll sure try them in a dressing). It was sweet and delicious. I can see why people like to buy this one item to-go. The iceberg lettuce could be an improvement (greens?), but it was tasty. We love lemongrass soup, but weren&#39;t feeling the only option to be seafood lemongrass, so we didn&#39;t order any.

My husband had their October special and said it was quite possibly the best Thai dish he&#39;s ever had. I&#39;ll update the name if I can remember it... it needed a side of rice (upcharge) to soak in all the delicious Panang curry at the bottom.

I had the spicy basil noodles and they were so delicious. I loved the thickness of the noodles and how unique the flavors were together. I&#39;ve had MANY Thai noodle dishes and this one was right up there.

We tried a Thai beer as well and it was sweet like honey... mmm.

Just something about it, I didn&#39;t want to give it a fifth star, but it&#39;s very good, surprisingly good.

I eat a lot of Thai and I guess because I&#39;ve been disappointed with the Thai and other Asian food I&#39;ve had around Naperville I didn&#39;t have the highest expectations. But the food was very good and I would definitely go back.

We started with an order of satay which was certainly the worst part of the meal. It was very standard but not all that large and so I have to say very overpriced. The Thai place I normally go to has better satay for half the price.

Fortunately, our entrees more than made up for it. I had the yellow curry which was very good, had an interesting sweet flavor that I don&#39;t often get in a yellow curry but was very good. Could&#39;ve been a bit spicier, but I love spicy foods and that&#39;s certainly nit-picking. She had the red curry which was also very good. I&#39;m normally not a big fan of red curry but I really enjoyed this one and found myself stealing some of hers any chance I got. And while the prices may seem a bit much for a curry dish, there&#39;s quite a bit of food and plenty of sauce in there for the price. Enough to take half home and make it count for two meals.

I&#39;ll definitely be going back."

The food is okay, but it&#39;s just okay. Again, the noise got to us: the place is small, but we were right on top of a table with one big mouth whose commentary we were treated to throughout the meal. (Seriously, people, restrain yourselves.) 

Also, it would be nice to know BEFORE the check came that it&#39;s cash only under $10. Since the lunch special falls short of this cost, had I not been with my friend who could spot me a few bucks, I would have been SOL, because I did not have enough money on me.

+ Delicious food
+ $7.99 to $9.99 lunch specials (Monday to Friday 11AM to 2PM)

+ Parking can be horrible during peak hours.  There is a public parking lot across the street but it seems always full.  There is also street parking available.

The bad:
- If you go during weekends and dinner time, prices are too expensive for the portions they serve.  Most Thai restaurants we go to have entrees priced at least $2 lower than what Bangkok Village charges.

The bottom line:
Go for lunch specials (Mon to Fri from 11AM to 2PM).  Otherwise, you are better off at another Thai restaurant with larger portions and cheaper prices.

Simply excellent. I go to a number of thai places, and even worked as a busboy at a vietnamese place (Cuisine de Saigon off gartner) and I like to think I can appreciate good service when I see it. Theirs was awesome. Very attentive, sat us immediately, asked for drinks, and took orders promptly.

He didn&#39;t say &#34;Sorry, I&#39;m not your waiter,&#34; he just rolled with it, and it was awesome. I rarely see service as unified as that at other places. 

The food was stellar as well. My mom, dad, and I got the tom yum soup as well as the rice soup with chicken, and they were both excellent. Nothing weird or greasy here, just good quality food.  We got the Royal Seafood Salad, the Duck Curry, and my mom got their chicken Pad Thai. For each the presentation was excellent, the portion perfect, and the food seasoned and delicious. Rich flavors. The Duck curry had a sweet and creamy texture with a robust heat to it, and the duck was tender and flavorful. The Royal Seafood salad had a wonderful range of seafood and a delicious tangy Thai salad dressing. I didn&#39;t try the Pad Thai too much but it was nutty and sweet just how I like it.

When we were done, they promptly gave us the bill and we left. I don&#39;t know if people reviewing for bad service were there on a busy night, had different servers, or they&#39;ve simply responded to these reviews by upping their game, but regardless I was impressed.

Trust me that you shouldn&#39;t spend your money on Pad Thai at Noodles and Company when you can get real Pad Thai at Bangkok Village.  

I will say that being downtown, they are a bit more pricier than what you can normally find at most locals but the food quality is good and the ambience will really appeal.  It&#39;s a small place but they really make it work with their table settings. 

I give them an A for presentations.  The portions are a bit smaller than what I&#39;m used to but then again, I&#39;ve learned that I shouldn&#39;t divulge.  Too much of a good thing isn&#39;t always good.  I was here for dinner yesterday and for 2 people, the check came out to be about $33 before tip.  We had a soup, appetizer and 2 entres. 

The soup was Chicken Tom Yum at $6 and is enough for tasting of two.  But it&#39;s really meant for a 1 person meal.  I would say that it&#39;s somewhere around a medium-sized bowl.  It really was flavored right and really tasted like how Tom Yum should taste. 

The appetizer was Seafood dumplings for $7 but in reality, it&#39;s more like 6 little pieces of siu mai (pictures to come).  Though they claim to have shrimp and crabmeat in there, I couldn&#39;t really taste anything as it was all in paste.  My suggestion is to skip this one and try a more authentic appetizer. 

The entres  were Pad Thai w/ Shrimp at $11 and Pad See Eww with Chicken at $10. They flavored each really well.  The Pad Thai noodles was slightly undercooked to give it a more chewy texture which worked well for this dish. It was sweet.  The Pad See Eww were more flavored with soy sauce than I normally have tasted from other restaurants but it was good nonetheless though slightly more salty. 

I would recommend this place for anyone who enjoys a bit more of an upscale Thai place and it&#39;s really a great place to take a date if you want to have more somewhat of a romantic but cultural feel.  The service was really fantastic.  The servers were really helpful and they refilled our water constantly  :)  ."

I&#39;m not very adventurous when it comes to Thai food, not because I don&#39;t want to eat crazy stuff, but because what I assume is the gross gringo stuff (red/green/yellow/panang/masamun) curry is so reliably tasty, almost everywhere you go. 

Most recently, I had the red curry, which had lots of nice sweet bell peppers, some decent eggplant (and I don&#39;t really like eggplant) plus bamboo shoots and plenty of tasty beef. I would love to have more rice though - they server it to you in a lake of delicious sauce, and I can make myself sick just eating that stuff over rice. Also worth noting that my red curry had nice heat - not crazy, but noticeable. I also tried some pot stickers, which were good - crispy shell, nice savory sweet filling. 

I feel like it might be a tiny tiny bit expensive, but when you get down to it, it&#39;s not that bad. Solid Thai option, and close to a family member, so I&#39;m actually surprised I haven&#39;t visited more often."

I went for a meal on a a Saturday night.  Upon entering the restaurant there were quite a few tables empty and no one was really at the front of the restuarant to greet us.  We had made reservations, but they were definitely not needed.  We sat down and ordered drinks, but were disappointed when they told us they had run out of the Pina Colada ingredients.  Then we picked a Mojito and another drink which may have been a Blue Ocean or something, both were good.  The entrees we selected were the Grilled Chicken Teriyaki and the Jungle Curry.  The Grilled Chicken Teriyaki tasted like Beef.  We even asked if we were served the wrong dish!  We were told that it was marinated which is why it tasted like beef.  It was disappointing.  The Jungle Curry was quite good.  The service was hit or miss.  Sometimes they came to our table too fast, other times too slow.

I work in downtown Naperthrill and I remembered I have always wanted to try Bangkok VIllage so first I checked some of the reviews on my Yelp app, then I called for pick up.

It&#39;s a nice ambiance. They&#39;re smart to keep it a little swanky looking for the napervillans. Great menu! There were some things listed that I haven&#39;t seen on other menus, which made me feel like Bangkok village is more authentic than some of the others. 

I tried the pad thai, panang, and pad ped. All were good although I have had better pad thai and the portions were a tad on the smaller side (hence the four instead of five stars.) Since my friend introduced me to panang a couple of years ago I almost always order it and I have to say this was the best panang I have had. It was more on the soupy side and if you are a panang fanatic you know it can vary. At first I wasn&#39;t so sure i was going to like it since I&#39;ve tended to like the thicker ones, but the flavors were amazing! This is def my new after work panang pick up place!"

Very rare that a server greets you by name every single time you dine in or pick up an order. It&#39;s welcoming, and makes you feel as if you are a valued customer. The proportions are nicely sized. If you go during lunch you get an appetizer, soup/salad all included in your meal. The beet dressing  on the salad is outstanding (I was surprised not too big of a beet fan). The crab in a cup is a delicious choice for lunch appetizer. When we go for dinner the chicken satay is amazing. It comes with a cucumber and carrot salad and peanut sauce. Pad Thai sa ew with shrimp is my favorite. Brian gets chicken fried rice extra spicy. It&#39;s good. He says no fried rice compares. We like our food HOT so rose always brings us an extra dish of the spices to add heat. I&#39;ve referred many people here, everyone raves about the food and service.

I will try to review as fairly as I could.

This place is pretty small, no bigger then 10-15 tables. My girlfriend had their pad see ew and I had their penang curry. Their pad see ew was on the saltier side and didn&#39;t have much noodles. It was full of beef though...which is weird. The curry wasn&#39;t anything spectacular or great. It was just meh....the spicy flavor pretty much just took over the taste of everything. Meh....

Overall, I think this is pretty meh of a thai place.

* Pros

Small-cozy-nicely-decorated-Thai Restaurant

Excellent location in downtown Naperville directly across the street from the performing arts center and parking garage.

The presentation, quality and taste of the food are all very good.

Service is courteous and responsive.

The establishment appeared to be very clean to me.

Without drinks, the tab was about $20 per person. 

We ordered 1 appetizer platter and 4 meals and ate family style.

I really enjoyed the salad and the chicken w/ rice soup was uniquely Thai.  I chose the potstickers as my appetizer which were also great.  The Chicken Pad Thai was spicy and flavorful.   To finish things off, a Thai Iced Tea hit the spot.

I got the tofu with green curry. Delish! The pad thai had skinny noodles, not fat, which made me sad, but my friend liked it. To me, though, the chicken tasted kind of old, like it had been frozen and thawed a few times. Which is a flavor that scares me. 

They had a decent Asian beer selection, which is fun, but I was most excited about ordering an old-school MGD in the bottle. That beer is seriously underrated. Mmmm, flavor.

The main thing to remember about this restaurant is that some tables are on a platform. Do not move your chair around too much or one leg will find itself precariously dangling over the edge of the platform, possibly sending you toppling into the beautiful carved wooden screen below. This would be REALLY embarrassing. So watch out for that."

While I was a student at North Central College I would go to Bangkok Village at least once a week.  Really, it was to the point where no one would ask me what I wanted and would just bring it to me without asking - Red Curry w/ tofu lunch special, baby!

There are many great items on the menu, but I am seriously just in love with their red curry.  It&#39;s unlike any red curry I have tasted (note my other reviews were I declare myself a thaifood addict).  So don&#39;t expect Bangkok&#39;s food to be exactly like all the other restaurants you&#39;ve been to, its just different and better!  

With the lunch special you get the soup of the day, which is always really good - usually a chicken base with rice and vegetables, a salad and an appetizer.  I recommend the crab in the cup, it sounds adorable and tastes great too.  (i peench!)

Being in Downtown Naperville, parking can be tricky, but there are 3 options: the Parking garage next to B&amp;N/Tangerine, the parking lot across from that, and if you turn into what looks like an alleyway next to Bangkok Village, there&#39;s a back parking lot, which I didn&#39;t realize until about a year ago and has been a pretty safe bet so far.

I think the menu is straight up Thai.  Everything seems pretty authentic to me, but I have never been to Thailand or anything so, you know.  Honestly, everything here is delicious, and we usually get something different every time.  The curry is good, the fish is good, the noodle dishes are good, etc etc!  One dish that I have had cravings for is the Thai Sukiyaki, which is a really flavorful soup (not really like Japanese sukiyaki at all).  Portions are big like most Asian restaurants, but not huge.. usually I would say 2 dishes is enough for 3 people, but for this restaurant, if you order 2 dishes for 2 people, you&#39;ll end up in the clean plate club (while also feeling suitably stuffed).

The service is pretty good; someone&#39;s usually around to fill up water.  The decor is very nice too, everything is so pretty!  Lighting is kind of dark.  The seating options are interesting.. you can sit at a table in the middle of the room, up against the windows the tables are on a platform, and up against the wall the tables are also on a platform but the seats are more like benches with cushions... if you have been in a tatami room at a Japanese restaurant, it&#39;s like that."

I&#39;m glad they have a pan-Asian selection of beer accompaniments. 

Spicy Basil on the menu is good but man that shit is SPICY. And I&#39;m Indian. It&#39;s so spicy it almost drowns out everything else.

We came after seeing a rather long movie at Cantera, so it was towards the end of the night, but it was still a bit tough to find parking in the vicinity.  Once we were in, the restaurant was nearly empty (again, because of the lateish hour, I&#39;d presume) but that meant more service, and more importantly, QUICK service for us!

We started with some Gyoza, which were suitably delicious as any.  We then moved on to a trio of basil chicken, basil fried rice, and pad khee mow (basil noodles- yes, we like our basil).  The chicken and rice were definitely more to my taste than the noodles, but all three were quickly devoured by some of the most serious critics of thai food I have ever met- my family!

The pricing on all of this was very reasonable, and it also seemed that they had at least a semi-full service bar, judging by the bottles on the back counter, if that&#39;s your thing.  The only thing really holding me back from 5 stars here is the fact that I&#39;ve only been once, and not during peak hour, but I would not be surprised to find that this is indeed 5-star cuisine, no matter the situation."

Two noodle dishes were both unremarkable.  The Kee Mao was bathing in an oddly brown-colored sauce, and it was loaded with eggplant -- something I hadn&#39;t seen before in this dish, and which was probably done to serve less chicken.

If I were dying for Thai food, I&#39;d do it again.  But I won&#39;t yearn a return visit."

Good dishes, particularly the pad thai (can you ever go wrong with this timeless favorite?) and the thai iced tea. Dessert selections are also good.

This is a super delicious place to go...

But you have to know something important...

Many of their dishes automatically have FISH SAUCE or OYSTER SAUCE in them.

If you want your dish vegetarian/vegan, you have to ask for NO fish sauce and NO oyster sauce. 

They will happily make them for you without those items, but you have to ASK!

Enjoy!"

The owner was from Thailand and you can tell by his successful restaurant. On the wall are pictures of Thai royalty, and huge 5 or 6 seating booths that are built into U-shapes. Bangkok can be romantic or family friendly depending on the time and location of your table. I go here with my vegetarian and gluten-free family and we are always left satisfied.

I suggest starting with the spicy coconut soup, then getting Pad Si Ew with tofu and broccoli. There are no better noodles in the world! Though, my dad and grandpa swear by the curry dishes. It&#39;s a better location in the downtown area, because there is a hidden parking lot behind the restaurant. It is a solid 5 star restaurant!"

My meal here was fantastic - a delicious curry with chunks of butternut squash and other fresh vegetables. The heat was perfect and the taste was fantastic. My husband raved about his Pad Thai as well. 

I thought the service was pretty good, although our server was, as another reviewer observed, really crabby. It kind of suited her though and in a weird way, sort of added to the experience. 

Only down side of the evening was that I&#39;m pretty sure the sweet &amp; sour sauce that came with my spring rolls was really melted cherry Jolly Ranchers. No kidding. Problem was easily fixed by ordering a side of peanut sauce, which was really tasty. Overall, a great meal and this is now my go-to for Thai food cravings."

I ordered kra pao moo (holy basil and Thai chili with pork) and I was severely disappointed.

I got the excuse that because we are in the US the Thai ingredients cost too much, etc. I partly get that, but I cook Thai food at home, which is a billion times better, and it takes me 5 minutes (not counting how long it takes the rice to cook). They also use cuts of pork instead of ground pork, which is pretty odd. I can find that in some places in Thailand, but I never like it when they try to make this dish seem more luxurious than it is - and I am not dissing kra pao moo because it is my favorite Thai dish other than Rad Na (sometimes written Lad Nar and pronounced like rod naa). 

I can&#39;t speak much for the other menu items because I didn&#39;t try them, but the people I with had mixed feelings. I think they were enthusiastic about it, but again, along with the talkative staff this reminds me of &#39;wine is shtick&#39;."

I got the love tender duck with plum sauce, it was absolutely delicious. Tender, sweet, and tangy, just perfect and really not that expensive. Boyfriend got the panang curry; it wasn&#39;t anything special, but it wasn&#39;t bad either, very good.

I love Thai food, which works out well since I married a Thai woman that has no interest in cooking any other kind of food.  When we moved to the area, we had to go check out all the Thai restaurants in town.  Of the first several restaurants we tried, none wowed us including Bangkok Village.  However, among that selection Bangkok Village was probably the best (based on Pad Thai, my wife&#39;s litmus test), so we decided to go a second time.  That did not turn out well.  We had ordered mussamun curry with beef (one of my favorite dishes), and the beef was terrible.  It was hard, chewy and inedible.  We avoided eating the meat and just ate the curry with vegetables and it was rather lackluster.  For something that is listed as their house special, I was disappointed.  Maybe we caught them on a bad day, but I don&#39;t see how in the preparation of the meal that a quality of meat so terrible slips by.  If that had been my first trip, I&#39;d give the restaurant 1 star, but since we had a decent experience prior to this visit, 2 stars seems fair.  We haven&#39;t been back since there are a newer Thai restaurants in the Naperville area that are superior in both mine and my wife&#39;s opinion."

However, the food is horrible. I had the chicken pad-si-ew and it was the worst I&#39;ve ever had! The noodles were so over-sauced that it was soggy (I didn&#39;t know noodles can get soggy!) I didn&#39;t have to chew the noodles because it was so slippery I just swallowed them. And pad-si-ew noodles are the very basic of thai food so it makes me wonder what else they can&#39;t cook right. Keep searching for good thai food."

the seating is.. different, to say the least. i wasn&#39;t uncomfortable, but other people may be. though the service was good (not great/not bad), the food wasn&#39;t spectacular. prices are competitve, comparable to what i&#39;m used to seeing. so no foul there. they do need double doors."

I&#39;ve ordered this from many, many places and this one is one of the best.  We also ordered spring rolls on one occasion and they were also very good. On top of that, everything seems to be reasonably priced.

decor is cute. Old paintings of Thai mythology and of course pictures of the King and the royal family. Very authentic.

The food is great. My favorite is the Tom Yum with either chicken or tofu. It&#39;s beautiful and I order it medium spicy. Theywill not make it authentically spicy for you unless you really ask for it. Their medium is not that spicy.

Their lunch specials come with a little cup of soup, a side, and a little salad. How awesome is that? I like their salad dressing, it&#39;s light, and not very vinegar-ey. I usually get the pad thai with tofu, which is typical farang food, but hey, it&#39;s good so get your nose out of the air. I&#39;ve been to thailand and this food is comparable to the good Thai restaurants I have been to in Chiang Mai.  

My friends usually get the curry and love it. 

I wouldn&#39;t recommend the fresh spring rolls, I have a feeling it&#39;s not an authentic thai dish, maybe? They use wheat paper, not rice paper, and really, that wheat paper was meant to be cooked. Rice paper fresh spring rolls are more a Vietnamese tradition, so I was not surprised when they weren&#39;t that great.

In general, love it! thanks guys, Khab kun ka!"

I&#39;ve gotta say, there isn&#39;t much in this area in the way of decent food options.  But I looked up what options I had other than Cheddar&#39;s by my hotel.  I was in the mood for pizza and a good craft beer and this place came up on the list and I thought I&#39;d try it out.  I was greeted warmly by the delightful Margie who was my server.  Actually, she was everyone&#39;s server and was managing the room very well.  She talked up the specials for the day...Taco Tuesday and she told me how amazing the tacos were and what the best options were.  I told her I was in the mood for pizza and she emphatically affirmed that the pizza was awesome!  

I ordered a personal sized pizza and a nice IPA on draft.  They don&#39;t have many beers on draft but they had a solid selection of craft beer in bottles...if you&#39;re a beer snob like me!  It was a great place to spend time doing  work on my computer (free wifi!), watching a bit of the US Open, and enjoying my food.  I loved the pizza!  I have just come from New York where I tried to find a really good slice of pizza, but didn&#39;t find anything satisfying.  This pizza blew the NYC pizza out of the water!  I highly recommend the thin crust!  

I probably would have given the place a solid 4 stars for the establishment and the food, but Margie made the experience an outstanding 5 star experience!  I highly recommend this place and will definitely go back when I&#39;m in town again!"

One day I decided to finally give it a try by ordering some take-out. We ordered variety of things just to try out the place. 

Something that stood out were the beer nuggets-they are cheap and you get a ton of them. They come with marinara sauce and I thought they were quite good. They satisfy all of your carby needs. The fatty Magoo burger was decent. I wouldn&#39;t say it was amazing, but it was okay and had a decent flavor to it. Nothing spectacular stood out about it, in my own opinion. 

I think the prices are right and it is a decent place to get takeout if you want some standard American fare. There are always coupons in the mail and online too.

Atmosphere was a fun bar with a nice seating area. It wasn&#39;t too loud where you have to scream to be heard. It was busy for a Friday night and our server was friendly and wonderful. I&#39;m a huge fan of forearm tattoo and our server had this amazing tattoo on her forearm that she tattooed on herself so I was mesmerized by her talent!

Ok...onto the food! We ordered the fried calamari and it was ok. It wasn&#39;t the best. It was chewy so it wasn&#39;t the melt in your mouth kind where you get at a fancy restaurant but it was still good. We also ordered 1lb of wings and our waitress recommended the tequila lime flavor and I&#39;m glad we trusted her because that was delicious! Wings were crispy and I could have lick the sauce off the plate it was so good. It came with about 7 nice size wings for 1lb with 3 celery sticks and I had bleu cheese dressing so that was a great recommendation. My hubby ordered the Fatty Magoo cheeseburger and that came with bacon, American cheese and bleu cheese on top and he said it was good. That also came with a side salad with Italian dressing and that was also good. I had a turkey club with avocado on wheat and it was ok. Not the best but pretty good for $7!

We never dine in, we always order for delivery. It looks like a run down hole in the wall but dont let that sway you from trying it.

We have tried the pulled pork sandwiches with sweet potato frenchfries...oink oink...oh so yummy.  The salads are not bad, but I have had better.

Our current obsession and 3x a week order is the steak tacos, chicken tacos, and calamari. I don&#39;t like steak tacos but these are so good. Perfectly seasoned and so juicy. For $6 you get 3 fully stuffed tacos, nachos with salsa and a salad or soup. Trust me it&#39;s filling..I can never finish more than 2 tacos. The calamari is pretty damn good for such a place like this. Also the breaded fried mushrooms are oh so good!!

I will add pictures the next time we order. 

My only issue is the portion size for the price of the calamari ($9) is very very small!! Also sucks that they don&#39;t deliver until after 5pm. Overall a pretty decent place for reasonable priced dinners.

ADDING: 
So do to fasting we tried the Veggie quesadilla - BOMB, so big, cheesy and full of flavor!!
I love the minestrone soup and the Grilled Tuscan Panini sandwich is so delicious. Not a fan of the Panzerotti, that my have been the hubby&#39;s fault for adding tomatoes cause the bread was good, will try this again minus the tomatoes. Not a fan of the Tuna Melt wont order that again, Nacho fries are oh so good!! Caprese salad was tasty but not what I expected, was 4 slices of mozzarella cheese, basil, and a slice of tomato on each piece of cheese (hardly a salad more like an appetizer, definitely never had one like that before).

Then waitress wasnt so friendly anymore and try to tell me I did not meet my amount to redeem deal and walks away to take other tables orders. Deal says no taxes and no liquor included but waitress trys to tell me its all beverages. I told her it says liquor and tried to show her on app as she walked away again and said she would check on it. About 15 mins later she said I was correct and finally finishes out bill after taking orders and filling drinks instead of letting us pay our bill and leave. Not sure why she changed attitude just because of using a deal, made us feel like it was coming out of her pocket.......what a shame over the difference of 2 dollars, oh well really wanted to like the place."

My traditional beef was wonderful and huge which was great because I couldn&#39;t finish half of it. But my boyfriend was able to eat that since his food was horrible and not edible at all, which is sad because as a truck driver, that boy will eat most anything. He ordered the Chicago dog with no onions, it came drenched in more onions than he could even pick off  he also ordered the Irish nachos, on those he didn&#39;t want guacamole or salsa. And again it came smothered in it.  Not to mention, the smelled spoiled. These probably could have been avoided if we had dined in, but we did make our order to go. On top of the did being poor quality, the only polite person we encountered was the girl that brought our food from the kitchen. One waitress/bar girl was too concerned with getting her hair braided at the register to even acknowledge we walked in, the second girl that came up after a bit was the one who brought our food out. The their girl who came to while I was asking for peppers and blue cheese was the rudest worst server I&#39;ve ever encountered. (and again.... Truck stop waitresses make the devil look like a friendly face sometimes) you don&#39;t yell at a customer who is asking if you have sweet and spicy peppers. Simply because you don&#39;t know what they are asking for exactly. It&#39;s called customer service. Sad that it cost $25 to learn that we won&#39;t be back."

Apparently a ton of restaurants in the Winfield/Wheaton area are closed on Sunday afternoons. This place however, was open! It was me, a friend, her daughter, and my daughter. 

We walked in and the place seemed pretty quiet - only other people here was a large group from a baseball team. They sat us and gave us some crayons and a kid&#39;s menu for my little girl. I wasn&#39;t expecting a kid&#39;s menu from this place since it seemed more like a bar.

But the downgrade was in the service and food. Everything tasted OK. I got the pulled pork sandwich, sweet potato fries, and cup of the pizza soup. The sandwich would&#39;ve been better if they didn&#39;t drown it it BBQ sauce. 

The server gave my friend the wrong order. Now I don&#39;t know this for sure, but I&#39;m pretty certain she gave the wrong order right to the other table even though my friend picked at it before she realized it wasn&#39;t her meal.

It seems like they have a second bar area in the back? and also an outdoor patio.

I was surprised to see how many families were coming in to eat! It seems to have a loyal following for the food, and everything that went by me looked good. Might have to come back for that!

When we were done with our beer, the bartender was gone helping to serve food, so it took a little longer to close out and leave, but it&#39;s understandable.

I didn&#39;t mind the noise from the passing freight trains and metra trains. 
I ordered a burger and my boyfriend got the jerk chicken sandwich. My burger was ok, nice and juicy, but my boyfriend didn&#39;t like his sandwich, he felt there wasn&#39;t enough &#34;jerk&#34; to it. We are ordered a few more beers and then we decided on dessert, banana cream pie. Pie was delish.

Growing up in the area, my father would take us here a few times a month. Knowing it as &#34;John&#39;s Buffet&#34;, I will still continue to refer to it as such. Throughout the years, John&#39;s has remained consistent with both customer service and their food preparation, which is much appreciated in today&#39;s world of &#34;will this visit be as good as the last time?&#34; for many establishments. I can always count on John&#39;s to deliver great food, a comfortable atmosphere, and friendly servers.

As a tween and having a rather picky palate back then, I would only order their pizza soup. To this day, the pizza soup is as delicious as I remember it. It&#39;s a tomato soup with sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, and pepperoni, and topped with mozzarella cheese. (You&#39;ll have to pick around the mushrooms, as it&#39;s pre-made). I definitely recommend this soup!

Most recently, I tried a cheese quesadilla with Italian beef, roasted red peppers and pepperoncini. Yep, you heard me; Italian beef on a quesadilla. Sounds odd, but it&#39;s fabulous! The only thing I wish they did differently is use only mozzarella for this type of quesadilla instead of the cheddar/mozzarella blend. M had the bacon cheeseburger quesadilla, which is equally as good. 

The Johnny Nachos with everything (chicken, steak, and chorizo) and Bruchetta are fabulous as well. Definitely want to try a &#34;Stairway to Heaven&#34; burger (1/2 pound burger topped with cheddar cheese, bacon, fried egg, and finished with heavenly brown gravy) and the &#34;Burn Your Butt&#34; burger (1/2 pound burger topped with pepper cheese, a grilled jalapeno, and a dollop of salsa all on a garlic buttered bun, with chipotle mayo) someday. A friend ordered the Stairway to Heaven burger once and we jokingly asked him what he wanted his tombstone to say. It looked so good but it also made my arteries cry just from looking at it.

On nice days, it&#39;s enjoyable to eat out on the patio, if you don&#39;t mind all the train traffic. Growing up in Wheaton and living near the train tracks, it&#39;s something I&#39;ve grown used to and can easily tune them out. On the inside, there is ample seating and a cozy bar and a great beer menu. Their website lists an &#34;On Deck&#34; section of brews coming soon; make sure you follow them to receive notifications of when they are available. The Bloody Marys are good (make sure you ask for it spicy, if you prefer). I wish they came in a pint glass, though.

John&#39;s has been around for almost 100 years now, and I&#39;m glad to see this little gem still doing so well in downtown Winfield. If you&#39;re in the area, I definitely recommend you stop on by."

I like the ribs (meaty, the sauce is average), patty melts w/ grilled onions (my favorite), the Reubens, sweet potato fries and buffalo chicken salad. The small town feeling at the bar area in the restaurant can feel very clique-ish.

The dinner salad was puny, mostly white-ish iceberg lettuce, and served with a tiny cup of watered down blue cheese dressing. No bread was offered. 

My salmon was dreadfully overcooked. The outside was dry, the inside was on the verge of dry. The baked potato was puny and had black spots. The vegetables were overcooked and I think boiled. 

I told the waitress about the salmon, and she apologized but did nothing about it. My dinner companion went to the manager and asked for some consideration. They took half off the cost of the salmon dinner. I probably should&#39;ve gone up there myself, because I would not have settled for anything other than a free meal... Although I would hardly call it a meal because I took the potato and salmon home to feed my dog. 

To top it off I had ordered a piece of their supposedly special banana cream pie. It was also puny, the crust was soggy, the bananas were brown and it lacked flavor.

And if that wasn&#39;t enough the place is loud, noise reverberates, and it had a very musty smell last night. I think this will be my last visit. 

I will add a sidenote. Our waitress said she was not old enough to drink so could give me no advice regarding a choice of beer. I did ask for a particular brand on the menu, and she said &#34;oh we just ran out of that yesterday.&#34; However she was the one who brought our beverages to our table.

I love their outside patio.  Nicely done and I like hearing and seeing the freight and Metra trains pass through.

Great beer selection and their wine choices are not shabby either.  On certain nights they have 1/2 off their premium wines.  They also have live music some nights and beer and food pairing events too.

This is not a destination restaurant but for what it is, I like it.

We where seated right away. The waiter greeted us around 5 minutes later. We placed our order for an appetizer of fried mushrooms and our main corse of fried fish and a steak sandwich. We waited about 20 minutes for our appetizer , it was delivered with our main corse, not what we wanted. The appetizer  should come before the main corse is delivered. After we started eating my wife noticed a large lipstick smudge on my soft drink glass which means the cleaning of glasses is not up to par. I told the waiter who said he was sorry and brought me another drink. A few minutes later we noticed a man behind the bar, maybe the owner or manager, yelling at our waiter for some unknown reason. This could have been related to our table, not sure.
As far as the food goes, my fish was very dry. I think it was frozen and not fresh , three breaded squares. My wife&#39;s steak sandwich was tough .
This was our first time at John&#39;s and our last time."

I love burgers so both times I came here I decided I would try it, and give it a second try. The burger isn&#39;t seasoned at all or very well, and seemed kinda dry both times which is a huge bummer. The bun they choose to place this under seasoned and dry burger is way to big and doughy for that type of protein. The soup I had was decent and so were the fries, so at least I haven&#39;t left hungry."

It&#39;s comfortable, casual dining with a unique combination of families dining together as well as patrons in the visible bar dining area, and others sitting at the bar.  It seems there&#39;s not many choices in Winfield, so there&#39;s a diverse demographic customer mix.  There&#39;s also nice outdoor seating for nice evenings, with the restaurant located on a quiet, quaint street.

Prices are very reasonable, but you do get commensurate food quality (good, but not exceptional).  I had prime rib with sweet potato fires.  It was good, and only offered on Saturday nights, and they sometimes run out I&#39;m told.  The wife had the half slab of ribs.   It was so-so   - the usual boiled ribs smeared with BBQ sauce.

The banana cream pie was fresh.  The service was on slow side though, and water service was mediocre.

Overall - dinner here is a good value and you get comfortable, quaint dining.  We plan to be back."

Right away, I&#39;m going to tell you that they have a KILLER beer menu for such a small divey place. They get hard to find brews, legitimately. They post their beer menu online and it is updated daily online.

The first time I went there, we wanted to get the latest Goose Island beer but ended up getting a couple bowls of the white chicken chili. YUM they got this recipe right!

We decided to back for food a couple weeks later. The decor isn&#39;t much to look at, but it has a good menu with a mix of sandwiches, salads, dinners, soups, etc. I got a burger, my hubs got the meatloaf. The meatloaf was GREAT! The burger was too, very flavorful! And the portions were awesome. Good fries too, nice and crispy and plentiful!

We love to go here on a cold Sunday, order a few craft beers, and eat a hearty meal over the course of 2-3 hours. Very comfy and cozy. The waitstaff are friendly, and the owner will make his rounds and chat with you too!"

I met a friend here and it&#39;s kind of dark inside.  Someplace where you would have no problem tossing back a few, but at lunchtime it&#39;s not really an option for me!

I had a 1/2 a sandwich with a salad and a side of sweet potato fries.  I love those and these were great.  The 1/2 sandwich was plenty and the salad was a generous portion that came in it&#39;s own bowl, not thrown on the side of my sandwich plate.

The service was EXTREMELY helpful, almost crossing the line on hovering, but that was good."

The service was good but the bar was full of loud, old, drunk people and the food was mediocre at best.

We ordered the bruschetta and jalepeno poppers for appetizers.  After trying them, we did not order any more food and just drank enough so that we could fulfill our $50 quota to use our Restaurant.com gift certificate.  The bruschetta topping was okay, but it was covered with mozarella cheese so it was more like a pizza bread, but the bread was just plain old white bread that had been toasted.  The jalepeno popppers were very fully of cream cheese but they were just way to bready, you had to remove half of the breading just to eat the darn thing.

Not going back."

I had the fries, my guy had a sandwich, and we split some nachos. 

The sweet potato fries were good, but you really can&#39;t go wrong with them. They were seasoned with brown sugar, which I liked.

The nachos and sandwich were pretty average.  

The service was great, our waitress was very friendly. Though I was a little put off that they were putting the chairs up on the tables while we were still eating. So we got a take out box to take the rest of the food home. Our waitress assured us we were welcome to stay, but having the chairs up like we&#39;re keeping them there after closing made me really uncomfortable. She offered dessert, but we were pretty full, anyway.

What started for me as a&#39; total fluke&#39; coming and getting food here has turned into me coming here at least once a month and a regular!!

- FOOD IS EXCELLENT.  From the soups to the burgers and fries to the fish to the steaks.  I will admit I cannot comment on every single food item on their menu , as when I come here it is usually for the same items.

*** FOR THOSE NACHO LOVERS OUT THERE -- I will stake my life on this statement - this place has THEE BEST NACHOS of anywhere.  MILES BETTER THAN THE NACHOS YOU GET AT PLACES LIKE BENNIGANS, THE VILLAGE, DENNY&#39;S, FOX AND HOUND, FRIDAY&#39;S, HARD ROCK CAFE, etc, etc.

(In comparison to the nachos you get &#39;across the street&#39; at Caliendo&#39;s - night and day&#39;s difference.  Unless you like simple small Tostito chips covered with your basic tasteless Gehl&#39;s cheese sauce).

You will not be disappointed.  Great ingredients, salsa, cheeses, and beef.  Also is not some HUGE plate of &#34;mostly chips&#34; (like you get at Fox and Hound and The Village, where the plate looks huge, but its mainly just one layer at the top that appears loaded, but 80% of the plate is just bare chips underneath).

I love these things.  The only place that ever came close to having as good of nachos was Wag&#39;s restaurant, and all the Wag&#39;s closed down in like 1992.

As I stated above, while I cannot obviously comment on their entire menu, I can vouch that their soups are all VERY GOOD, their burgers are pretty good, as is their steak.

Also is a full bar with a summer outdoor seating area.  VERY COOL PLACE!

RECOMMENDED WITHOUT A DOUBT!!"

Food here is everything from American to Italian and all is great.  The reuben is the best I have ever tasted and most likely the best in Illinois.  Burgers are great and portions on all meals is are medium to large.  Many of the meals come with sides and the sweet potato fries are the best.

There are 20+ beers on tap between the two bars and they range from Miller to Goose Island.  There are even more selections of beers that are bottled and seasonal selections are always good.  Mixed drinks are always great and the bartenders do a great job.

The layout of the bar/restaurant splits into two different sections.  There is the classic tavern with a triple horseshoe bar and then there is a restaurant and higher end bar in the same building.

During the season, when it isn&#39;t freezing, there is an outdoor patio section that has multiple tables and is great place to eat.  Service is fast and many of the servers are very knowledgeable about the menu.

Overall, the restaurant has a great selection of food, beer and drinks.  Along with a great atmosphere."

As for dinner, I went half-zies with a co-worker and shared the Meatloaf Sandwich and Sliders. Everything was pretty much what you&#39;d expect for bar food. Good.

We had even raved about the place to my parents, and finally got them to accompany us there for a special dinner.  Jeez, were we embarrased!  Our waitress (Nikki sp?) was too busy for us.  She was rude when she came over to take our order.  Turns out she never even put our order into the kitchen!  About 45 minutes later we asked to host (an older man with dark rimmed glasses) when our apps would be out.  He said &#34;you ordered apps?&#34;.  He went to check on them, came back and said the waitress never put the order in.   Then he came back 15 minutes later to see how things were, we said how much longer are our kids going to have to wait for their dinner.  He went back, said the order wasnt put in. Again.  Minutes later he came back with the dinner for ONE of my sons.  This made my 4 year old cry as he had been starving for his mac &amp; cheese.  Again, the guy came back asked if the kids were happy now.  I said no, not when one gets to eat and the other gets to watch him!  Wheres the mac &amp; cheese?  It comes from a box for petes sakes?!  Of course he said the order (once again) hadnt been placed with the kitchen.  By this time half of us were so disgusted with the service they canceled their orders!  Is there really a need to go on?

I mean seriously what a tease... I came in here hungry with my coworkers expecting some sort of buffet... I ended up getting over my buffet crisis and ordered the big John burger. The burger is fresh and you can tell homemade. Mine was served nice and hot and covered in american cheese just the way i like it. The side of fries they give you here is sparse at best. I mean really cheap skate can you spare them. I feel like bringing my own fries every time I come here because it is like they are gold or something with the extremely small portion they give you here. Over all though the service here is good and the food is pretty good as well just don&#39;t expect large portions. Would be a 5 star restaurant if I didn&#39;t leave hungry every time I go here.

I have been a fan of ribs for years and have searched high and low for the best bbq in Chicago. I came across John&#39;s rib house 3-4 years ago and it has been my go to spot ever since. I still try new spots, always in search of the next best spot but so far no one has been able to outdo the rib house. 

Their bbq pulled pork, ribs, and the chicken wings are a few of my personal favorites. The wings are twice the size you get at a wing joint. If I had to choose the best item on the menu it would be the Catfish, hands down. If you like fish, this is a MUST try. It is an old family recipe that is absolutely delicious. The fries are just frozen and from a bag, it would be better if they were hand cut but I come here for the bbq not the fries. The owner is a class act, he takes time to treat each customer like they are family."

Tonight, my 10 year old told me he wanted ribs, so we ordered to go from John&#39;s.  This place is great!  If you watch House of Cards on Netflix, Frank Underwood used to eat at a hole-in-the-wall rib joint.  I think this place is probably comparable in ambience and quality.  Really, really freaking good ribs and the nicest proprietor you&#39;ll ever meet.

We ordered a slab of baby back ribs, and I admit I had to laugh when I asked how much they are- he said &#34;$22 to $24&#34;.  I liked the guy, so I figured they were weighed after cooking or something.  With a side order of fries and tip, I think I paid about $25. 

The ribs were pretty terrific.  These are real slow-smoked baby backs.  My son and I couldn&#39;t even finish the whole slab together, so the order size is pretty substantial. I would come back here again in a heartbeat. Sure, it&#39;s a little expensive and the ambience is laughable, but the food is damn good and the people are first rate.  Four stars."

Dry and flavorless pulled pork, but was hard to tell due to the ridiculous amount of sauce on the thing. Would&#39;ve liked to pick up the sandwich and eat it like a sandwich, but the bottom half of the bun seemed to dissolve under the sauce and pulled pork.

When I walked in I smelled fantastic hickory-like smokiness filling the air.  I had the ribs and they were A-OK.  They took a bit to prepare as expected and as they were coming out of the overhead grill box I noticed they were so fall off the bone tender that a couple did just that - fell off and were lost to the wind (so make sure you like them that tender).  No worry - I was hoping ribby bliss would soon meet my mouth.  Ribby goodness did hit.  It was A-OK, but not as smokey as I was expecting with the scents that were there when I walked in and not quite as delicious as I had hoped after making some great slow baked ribs at home the week before.  The fries were pretty good (but not anything crazy) and the coleslaw was nothing to write home about.

I do still want to head back and try their rib tips - but for now this is just a perfectly acceptable place to eat."

Pulled pork was mediocre at best.  The meat was tender at least.  Covered in some dressed up ketchup sauce, passed off as BBQ sauce.  That was the worst part.  Then it&#39;s placed on a store bought hamburger bun?!

Fries were standard frozen French fries you find at any diner.  They were tossed with some Italian seasoning, which at least gave them a somewhat decent flavor.

Fountain machine was down, so they hand out cans of pop.  No big deal, but also no free refills.

At least the workers were nice.  

Definitely not coming back.  Way over priced for the quality of food that goes out.  $10+ for my sub-par meal."

_________________________________________________________________

I stopped by John&#39;s during my lunch break on a recommendation from a colleague/coworker.  

Our order (RibTip lunch special: rib tips + fries)was taken by a gentleman that may have been the proprietor - friendly, old dude that seemed to have a few regulars.

I&#39;ll be frank.  The fries came from a box or package somewhere in an industrial freezer.

Covering meats with BBQ does not make it barbeque, folks.
The meats here taste like they were prepared in a residential oven.  Sauce is served on the meat?  No.

I got the pulled pork sandwich. I liked the sauce but the meat had no flavor besides the sauce and I wasnt planning on eating the bun, but it was so soggy that it just melted into the pork.  The sandwich was worth the money paid.

My fiance got the ribs and he too was not impressed.  They were dry and parts were even crunchy.

They also frequently run out of other items, so if you have your heart set on a particular dish you might want to call ahead.  The food is really good and you can&#39;t really go wrong with any of their menu items.  Even the dessert is homemade by mom - they have excellent peach cobbler.

The younger guy who works here is really friendly, quick and nice to talk to.  However there is an older gentleman who is much less pleasant to talk to and is slower than molasses, so if you happen to come when he is working you are going to be waiting at least 30-40 minutes for your order.  Again, it is always a good idea to call ahead at this place.  

You will probably want to get your food &#34;to go&#34; as this is a really small place with only a couple of tables not to mention that they have a huge TV that is always blaring a sports game uncomfortably loud.

The thing that threw me off was that the bbq sauce was served hot. Maybe a good idea to keep the meat warm, but I&#39;m not a fan.

We got a Groupon so ordered the rib tip meal with fries and beans. What would normally be a $30 meal was only $15.  Once we did get to eat the food we were very disappointed.  The serving of fries was extremely small, the fries were bland(unsalted) and tasted like they were just re-fried. The beans tasted like generic baked beans from a can. Now on to the rib tips. They were very fatty and boney. There was very little meat on them. After our meal we were still hungry.  The only positive that we can say is the BBQ sauce was ok.  We should have just ate at McDonalds.

One of my friends brought me into John&#39;s Rib House on 53 and Maple in Lisle a few months ago and from my first visit I knew he would be proud that I stumbled upon both at this one of kind restaurant. I knew I was in the right place the moment I walked in the door, the smell of the place had my mouth watering and I was hooked before my first bite. John&#39;s is a diamond in the rough, a hidden gem of Lisle/Naperville/Chicago/Illinois. 

I have a passion for home cooked food, I grew up in a generation consumed by dinners from a drivethru window or cardboard box you heat up in the microwave. And when i did go to a restaurant I paid over $25 for a meal I could have cooked better myself. At John&#39;s you do not pay for his advertisement, you do not pay for his high end seating and light fixtures, you don&#39;t pay for the fine china they serve their food on, because none of that will be found there! At John&#39;s you pay a reasonable price (multiple lunch specials under $10) , for some of the best food you will ever eat. Since my first trip to Johns I have been back on a near weekly basis, and they catered my family&#39;s Christmas Eve Dinner. I first had the Rib sandwich, which came with grilled onions and green peppers upon request, and the sweet and tangy sauce that wasn&#39;t too thick or remotely watery had me planning my next meal. I came back for a pulled pork, which is slow cooked for 13 hours, the pork is so tender you almost dont need to chew. My dad went to try it out after I gave him my initial review and the smell had him hooked. He ordered a full slab of baby backs, a rib sandwich, a catfish sandwich and a slice of peach cobbler. John bbq got my dads stamp of approval but he told me above everything, the catfish was by far the best he had ever had in his entire life. I had try it myself and I can attest, it is breaded and spiced to perfection, I have never tasted any catfish that is up to par with John&#39;s.

 On Christmas Eve my dad gave me $100 and told me to get as much food as I could from my friend John. John wrote up 4 different packages for me to choose from and sent me home with a slab of baby backs, a pound and a half of pulled pork, 4 catfish pieces, 2 pounds of rib tips, 5 hot links, and 2 slices of cobbler, and $20 left in my wallet! I could go on and on my friends. The cobbler is homemade by John&#39;s mom, it is to die for. The babybacks are better then any Ive had in Chicago or Nashville. Famous Daves, Gematos, The Patio, Portillos/Barnellis dont even belong in the same conversation as John&#39;s. All my life ive been under the impression rib tips are fatty, low quality pieces of meat. John showed me what a true rib tip is, 2 pounds of tips, not one piece of fat. I have never had a hot link before, but my mom grew up in Texas and said she hasnt had something like that since she was growing up. I highly recommend the Catfish, the hot links, the pulled pork, and the cobbler. For dinner go for the ribtips and babybacks. Their curly fries are hand cut, the slaw is homemade by mom and pop, the wings are triple the size of your average wing. I promise you will never be disappointed walking out of John&#39;s.

John&#39;s is family owned, it is John Sr who started the restaurant, and his son John Jr, with mom making desserts that they bring from home. You just dont find that these days. The second time ate at John&#39;s I saw a man sitting inside, but he wasnt eating he was just hanging out talking to John Jr.I thought that was very unique. There are letters on the wall from people that have written to John about their love of his food and the way he does business. If you come in odds are you will see me in there,not eating, but shooting the breeze with my friend John Jr. In a short time and a few visits he took the time to get to know me, and he has earned himself a customer for life.I have never written a review for a restaurant, but I took the time out for this because not only do John and his dad deserve for the world to know about their restaurant, but anyone who loves food deserves to know about John&#39;s.John Jr is one the nicest, most humble people you will ever meet. Every time I tell him how good his food is he says thank you like he has never heard it before. He is a man of principle, he knows how to run a business. He is going to be running a stand in Downtown Naperville right outside of Barnes and Noble this year, from 11am-3pm for lunch and 11pm-3am for the night crowd. If this restaurant was publicly traded I would buy stock TODAY.All you have to do is try John&#39;s and you will be a believer. I am so confident I would pay for your first meal because I know you will be back.  Go check out John&#39;s Rib House, get a business card, have them cater your next work luncheon, or graduation party, or anything.Tell him Palmer sent you, if Im there and you are unsatisfied the meal is on me."

John&#39;s sits in a strip mall at a busy intersection on Maple. The parking lot is terrible; make sure you drive slow. The joint is a store front with about four tables. There&#39;s a TV, but it doesn&#39;t work.

When you walk in, the smell of bbq smoke hits you and your mouth starts watering.  We ordered a half slab of ribs with a side of cole slaw and baked beans, a pulled pork sandwich and peach cobbler for dessert. The ribs were fall off the bone tender, but unfortunately, the smoke flavor you smelled in the air was not in the meat. Same for the pulled pork. Very tender, but very little smoke flavor. The sauce was decent, not the best I&#39;ve ever had. Cole slaw was good, but a pretty small serving. The beans were average. The cobbler was good, but the topping was more like sweetened pie dough rather than a biscuit topping. The owner asked if we wanted it cold or heated in the microwave. We wanted it warmed, but it was steaming when we got it. 

It seems like we lucked out and got the last of the pulled pork. A guy came in after us and wasn&#39;t able to get pulled pork or rib tips. The owner said they had a run on them at lunch and it would be another 30 minutes or so for more rib tips.  I would have like to have tried them.

The owner is a real sweetheart and he&#39;s been there for four years. He was very friendly and people who came in seemed to be regulars. I may give it another try some day, but won&#39;t go out of my way to eat there."

Many, many notches above The Patio, which seems to be the favorite of folks in my immediate area. The fries are definitely better than most.

Its location (in a strip mall near the southwest corner of IL-53 &amp; Maple Avenue with poor parking) is a little inconvenient, but well worth it in the end.

My only negative is that they seem to be a little stingy with the side items. The amount of fries that come with a &#34;dinner&#34; is half what you&#39;d get at most other places (but that never stops me from going there when I get the urge for ribs).

The catfish and peach-cobbler are both also excellent choices!!"

The owner? and or son of,  John Jr, was awesome, great guy with a super attitude and genuine nature.  He just chit chats with you while he is whipping up your chow....a very personal experience.

The place is small, looks like about 8 seats...but very clean, which is nice compared to some of the other establishments in that strip.

He will be at Woodridge-fest this Thurs-Sat, June 10th-13th with giant bbq turkey legs...always a favorite.

I am a regular fan of the burrito place next door, so I felt like I was cheating on them when I saw there was a line out the door for the burrito place and only one couple in this place.  I figured that there must be a reason for the lack of patronage so I got the 2 hot-dog special and my wife got the pulled pork sandwich.  After the meal arrived, I stole a piece of meat from her plate and WOW-it is how Uncle Bubs USED to taste 12 years ago.  I then stole a piece of the pork without sauce to see how it was in the natural un-sauced state and WOW!  It is a perfect smokey-but-not-tasting-like-charcoal.  I commented to the owner that I really screwed up ordering the hot dogs and complimented him on the pulled pork, and he proceeded to bring me out a plate of just pulled pork and sauce!  I made a strange pulled-pork/hot dog combo and gobbeled it down-delish.  We then followed it up again last week, and ran into a couple of regular patrons who suggested the brisket.  After the description given I was sold, but found out that they had ordered the last 2 so I &#34;settled&#34; for the pulled pork again.  I dont know, it was like heaven.

My husband and I have ventured to many, many Mexican places in the western suburbs, and they all are just ok (with the exception of Bien Trucha, which is stellar). So it may seem blasphemous to have El Famous Burrito be our go-to place for enchiladas and tacos, but it is what it is.

The al pastor tacos there are the bomb diggity. They are overflowing with meat and toppings (pork, cilantro, onions, the way it SHOULD BE), and if you get them with avocado, it is COMPLETELY worth your extra $.60 per taco for the avocado. They put about 1/4 of an avocado into a small taco...I actually end up taking some out and eating it separately, because its so much. I&#39;d rather pay for a substantial amount than for a piddly amount. I always get three tacos when I go there...two tacos, I&#39;m not totally full yet. But three tacos? I&#39;m so full, I&#39;m ready to die. 

Be prepared for a total cheese-fest if you get the enchiladas. These puppies are smothered in cheese! I&#39;m not talking sprinkled in a small amount of jack or chihuahua cheese. This is the real deal, a thick slick of white cheese covering the entire amount of enchiladas. I love it. 

I did come here one time and order a quesadilla and asked for beef in it, and they were extremely confused. Apparently, the only way to order a quesadilla from them is just with cheese. I wouldn&#39;t even bother, it ended up being really small and nothing special for the price.

And for your thirst needs, get the Horchata. They do it right here! Just don&#39;t get ice. I know that sounds crazy, but its cold enough on its own and you get more that way :)

This location just rules, ya&#39;ll. The tacos are $1.25 on Sundays, Tuesdays, and one other day of the week that I can&#39;t remember. We go at least once every two weeks, that&#39;s how much we love it! There are so many local places that don&#39;t have al pastor tacos, or they just don&#39;t do it right. If you love al pastor, hit this place up."

We were on a lunch break and one of my colleagues said we should go here for lunch. They have an excellent steak burrito. Even though I saw the yelp reviews for this place, I decided to give it a try as a recommendation from my coworker. I have no problems with hole in the wall establishments as long as the food is excellent. I must say I was extremely disappointed with this restaurant. When it comes to authentic Mexican food, I feel like this place was trying to compete with Chipotle and they missed the mark. I decided to order three taco dinner because I am a big fan of tacos and I have very high expectations. Whenever I order tacos, I like to get a variety of different meats to get a feel for the type of tacos that they offer. As I&#39;ve stated in my previous reviews, the key to a good taco is the flavor of the meat. I ordered a el pastor, steak, and a fish taco. The pork meat was extremely bland and not very tender. The steak was the best of the three meats, but I have been to other restaurants where the steak has been better. I am a big fan of fish tacos, but I have very high expectations for the fish. Every time I have gotten the face taco, the fish is grilled beee battered! The fish taco I had was the worst fish taco I have ever had. The fish had no flavor and it was fried but not beer battered. This place focuses on quantity over quality. The burritos are absolutely huge, but the quality of the food is lacking! I have been to many other Mexican restaurant in the area that really focus on quality over quantity If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, I would not come to this place! If you are looking for a quick fast food place that offers good food, I would go to chipotle!"

I also hit the Bloomingdale Rd location earlier in the week. So that said, It takes a lot for me to get to a point where I&#39;d bash a place but this location has it coming. 

I ventured in this past Thursday at about 3 in the afternoon. I ordered the usual stand-bye...burrito dinner everything with crème. I then took a seat, trying to find a relatively clean table.... The place had one other customer in at the time so I was eventually able to find a clean table. It was then that several flies started working the table area. 

There was maybe 4 people that ventured in during the half hour I was there and at no time did either the line cook or cashier venture forth to work the seating area.

My burrito arrived warm and palatable without the crème.

Sadly this location is now off the list. Hopefully management will take a look at this location, its staffing and work to make it as health and presentable as other locations"

The location in question I&#39;m reviewing is the Route 59 in Naperville location. I&#39;ve visited this location on a few occasions and I&#39;ll comment on a few things I&#39;ve tried here. El Famous Burrito has a fairly wide menu that expands beyond strictly cuisine from South of the border. 

First off let me comment on the taco&#39;s here. I&#39;ve had steak tacos here, they&#39;re inexpensive and while they&#39;re a bit over-seasoned and some sort of salsa or other seasoning is added to the meat. They&#39;re not terrible for around 1.50 but you can certainly do better at other places.

Next off is the burritos, the burritos here have similar over-flavoring due to added seasoning and salsa. I&#39;d say if the burritos are famous here, it&#39;s for the wrong reason. Finally in passing by El Famous Burrito recently I noticed a Vienna beef sign. They have hot dogs, so I decided to give one a try.

The hot dog I received came on a regular poppy seed bun. However, the texture and consistency of this bun was quite mysterious. It felt almost like a sponge, a wet sponge. I&#39;ve encountered a similarly strange poppy seed bun to this at Sonic in a previous hot dog review. The bun felt cold and wet, and was almost uncomfortable to hold. The hot dog I received was a skinless dog with ketchup on it, clearly they were not going for a Chicago style hot dog here. There was salsa like tomato on one half of the dog and onions on the other along with a pickle nearly as long and thick as the sausage itself. In doing this hot dog review I had a friend along with me who after the first bite proceeded immediately to dump his hot dog in the trash. I lasted one further bite than he did.  This is easily among the worst hot dogs I&#39;ve found. I can only think of two others that are in contention for being as bad. 

Now you might be asking yourself, why am I reviewing a hot dog at a Mexican restaurant. The better question is why are they serving it? Overall, I am not a fan of El Famous Burrito. I think a better name might be &#34;El Infamous Burrito&#34;. I&#39;d recommend your average Taco Bell over stopping here. They even charge for a cup of water! One star for this place."

Ok. So, I realize...this is, essentially, a &#34;cheap taco stand.&#34; But let&#39;s call a spade a spade here and acknowledge that this particular taco stand is no longer cheap. I can go to a Mexican restaurant and get a taco dinner for the same price and tack on the extra $5 for a tequila-full margarita. 

That being said...I&#39;ve had the $1.25 tacos. Not too shabby. Cooked to order and all that jazz. But it&#39;s not worth my return or purchase of anything else in the place. Sufficed to say, I tried to go for a non $1.25 taco day. I ordered some tamales. Tamales are kind of my thing. I love them. Heart. These were served cold. As in they couldn&#39;t even properly reheat them, even though there were no other customers in the location. So I returned them to be re-reheated. They made me fresh ones, which were appreciated, but they still didn&#39;t taste as delicious as some other local favorites of mine.  

The worst part about the entire experience was the staff. The guy in the kitchen looked miserable, and I was a little afraid he might spit in my re-reheated tamale. The cashier was just as unhappy, and didn&#39;t seem to know what to do when I came up to her with my cold tamales. When the new ones were made, she let them sit there for 5 minutes before putting them in reaching distance of me. 

Overall, a disappointment to the max. Boo to you El Famous. It makes me miss La Bamba from my college days."

I will stand by my prediction. This place will be gone sooner than later if they keep their business practices up. Tragic fail!!! Keep it up- Mene, Mene, Tekel (  ,, , )- your days are numbered, you have been weighed on the scales and found wanting.

How&#39;s this for a special touch. They now serve HOT DOGS!!!! Now I&#39;ve been to a few Mexican places over the years and I don&#39;t recall the hot dog being on the menu. That&#39;s just me. That might be since they can&#39;t hardly mess up a hot dog. Then again, don&#39;t be shocked if they do."

We seen other Mexican families eating, which was a first promising sign. It was packed and clean. While we waited I focused on the menu that covered the three walls. Once we received our order we sat down to eat. The food was hot, fresh and quite tasty. My husband and son had steak burritos and I had steak sopes. It was yummy. The salsa verde was good too. For a chain restaurant in the burbs, this is great and authentic. Although, the menu was pretty busy, I&#39;d eat there again with no qualms. I&#39;m glad because I thought I had to go to the city (Chicago) for a good, authentic Mexican, but fortunately I don&#39;t. :)"

Now, I love Bad Mexican. LOVE Bad Mexican. Unfortunately, El Famous Burrito is BAD Mexican. It&#39;s so bad, they have to serve it with a side of fries, most likely because the FDA wouldn&#39;t actually allow them to classify it as Mexican and serve it with chips. 

Good luck ordering it, though. The menu is so convoluted that it takes up 3 entire walls. It&#39;s Mexican fast food; you only have like 5 ingredients to work with, and there&#39;s only so many things you can make with them. The best part is you get to figure out what the heck the difference is between the &#34;Steak Torta Dinner&#34; and the &#34;Steak Torta Meal.&#34; 

Once you&#39;ve got that sorted out (or have given up), Vanessa Huxtable (from the middle season when she had that sort of short Rihana hairstyle) will be less than happy to take your order. Apparently Enemy of the State didn&#39;t bag her quite enough loot to carry her through life, so she&#39;s working here to pick up the slack. Don&#39;t call her out on it though, as she doesn&#39;t think any of this is funny, whatsoever. Also keep an eye out for the cook who thinks it&#39;s effing HILARIOUS that he managed to screw up sixteen orders in a row that day.

Once that&#39;s done, don&#39;t bother trying to find a clean table; there aren&#39;t any. The tables in this place look like they were garbage picked from an old McDonalds from the 70&#39;s, and STILL never cleaned. This is especially bizarre for this town, as simply waving your hands over something and shouting &#34;NAPERVILLE&#34; usually magically cleans it and turns into something really expensive. Also, don&#39;t try finding a table with a salt shaker that has anything in it; they&#39;re all empty. During one visit (yes, I was stupid enough to come here more than once), I went through FIVE salt shakers before giving up. Yeah, five. I&#39;m not exaggerating. After three it&#39;s just funny, but if you keep looking after five, you might have Down Syndrome. 

Be sure to keep your Game Boy handy, as you&#39;re going to wait a good long while for you food. That&#39;s OK, they&#39;re putting that much extra love in it, right? Nope. I&#39;ve gotten tortas, tacos and burritos here, and they all tasted the same. Well, to say that is somewhat misleading, as none of them tasted like anything at all. I guess that&#39;s why everyone scrapped the salt shakers bare. I found myself drowning my food in their (slightly less flavorless) green sauce just to get away from the feeling that I was having a freaky &#39;cid flashback and just imagining that I&#39;m chewing food, when in fact I&#39;m still back in that holding cell in County. Trust me, I wish it was the latter."

That being said: this place is not amazing, awesome, pay $40 a meal food.  It&#39;s just, good old plain, fast working man&#39;s Mexican.  You got 30 minutes for lunch and want some awesome tacos?  Hit this place up.  You on your way to Guitar Center and suddenly want some Mexican?  Hit this place up.

I haven&#39;t had a chance to eat here as much I want to as of late, but when I get a chance, I&#39;ll still grab a bite to eat there.  The Chile Relleno burrito is amazing and ridiculously filling for those of us who don&#39;t eat the meat.  For those of us who do, you can never go wrong with the ground beef.

The fish tacos: stay away.  They&#39;re just terrible.  I&#39;ve never had trouble ordering and have the coherence and comprehension skills to understand how it works.  It&#39;s broken up into Burritos, Tacos, Tostadas, Tortas, Sopes, Nachos, Breakfast, Dinner and Other junk.  And always remember: in this case red sauce is the mild and the green is the hot.  And it is delicious sauce.

The Flan is amazing, as well.  Some of the best flan I&#39;ve ever had, and it came from a simple &#34;fast food&#34; restaurant.  Hitting up other &#34;nicer&#34; Mexican and Tex-Mex places, I often times find rather gross flan.

I highly recommend this place for those of us in the Chicago-land area.  I&#39;ve eaten at countless El Famous Burritos and have never been let down."

After trying this place, I&#39;ve realized how inauthentic this place really is. My burrito was greasy and the steak was tough and chewy. My wife&#39;s tacos were the same. Real taco should be two bites, their tacos are definitely American supersized - not a good thing. Rice was mushy and the beans straight out of the can.

They used too much sour cream.  I literally brought this home, toasted my own flour tortillas and tried to make use of the very few peppers, onions and somewhat decent pieces of chicken.  The fries tasted like corn chips.  Aren&#39;t they supposed to use one fryer for fries and the other for other stuff so the flavors don&#39;t mix?  I felt nauseous after eating it was so bad.

Lithuanian diet is heavy with potato because, well it just is. Life was tough in Lithuania for many years, before and during the whole soviet era. Potatoes were cheap and people made do and invented quite a few dishes featuring what else...potatoes of course. So, here you go, now you know why. 
Anyway, the ambiance of the little cafe reminds me of a coastal cafe, somewhere by the sea. Wooden tables, benches and decor is very nautical (fishing net and buoys included :)
The food, even though starch heavy is delicious and hearty. If you are not sure what to order, ask, no really, ask! The waitress will recommend and tell you the ingredients so you can make a wise decision. 
The aforementioned Kvas is what we Lithuanians call Gira (Kvas is actually Russian).
Gira is actually pre-beer, that is how homemade bread beer tastes before it becomes beer, it has no alcohol in it yet, but you can taste the yeasty bubblyness. Personally, my husband doesn&#39;t like it, but i say, it&#39;s an acquired taste.  Ask for a sample and i&#39;m sure they will give you some. 

P.S. They have the best Lithuanian salads!"

When I found out there was another Lithuanian restaurant in the area, I got excited. Real excited. Why? I dunno. I like the food at the other two. But my love of trying new places bit me in the ass this time. 

We came right when they opened, and the family that runs it seemed to be all gathered around one of the tables. We weren&#39;t even sure the restaurant was open, but after asking, we were told it was. 

So we sat down and ordered two cups of mushroom soup, a cepelinai plate and an order of kugelis. If you don&#39;t know what those things are, you probably aren&#39;t reading this review. And if you still don&#39;t know, feel free to google them. But basically, they&#39;re heavy, traditional Lithuanian dishes made from potato, grease, bacon and love. 

Unfortunately, aside from the soup, the food wasn&#39;t good. It tasted like it had been made about a week ago and was reheated in the microwave. In fact, I&#39;m kind of thinking that&#39;s exactly what happened. It was steaming hot, but extremely gummy and just...bad. 

While the service was quick, and the server was friendly, the food was just lacking to the point that I had to leave half of mine uneaten. And if you know my love for Lithuanian food, that just isn&#39;t how I roll."

There are so many Chinese, Japanese, Italian or Indian cuisines, but very rarely you see restaurants that are Lithuanian, Latvian, Polish, etc. So i give them credit for trying to bring a different cultural meals to the table.

However, the food is not for everybody there. There are many customers that are Lithuanian and probably they are the only returning customers there. I&#39;s because once you try the food, you never come back. 

Every meal there consists potatoes. Literally, ever meal. Of course except the drinks and.... only drinks. I have tried the traditional Lithuanian &#34;Cepelinai&#34; there. Those are potatoes stuffed with meat and floating in a pond of oil in the plate. There is also some sour cream and bacon on the side... Just try to imagine how it looks like...

I walk into cafe Smilga and this was the case. Inside the cafe are wooden benches and tables, simiar to what you would find on someone&#39;s patio. It is a quiet spot in Darien where Lithuanians (and Chinese foodies) congregate for some awesome Lithuanian goodness. It is a small, quaint little cafe sitting at the end of a strip mall waiting for you to walk in and order their ethnic delights!

The Zeppelins are very warm, soft and sticky. The pork cutlet inside the goodness is even better. Since I ordered one of the combos they offer, which came with a Zeppelin, potato pancakes, meat dumplings, thick cut bacon chunks and sour cream. When I saw the plate land in front of me, my eyes almost popped out of my sockets. It was that epic. I did not even know where to start. It was an amazing meal though, but I would not recommend eating this on a hot day, as the old is very hearty and heavy. The potato pancakes were warm, soft and did not have that starchy texture many potato dishes possess. The dumplings were all very well cooked and scrumptious. 

I do not recommend this for those who are counting carbs or watching their figures. For those who are into good food though, this is definitely a place for you to check out.

The server was very nice, and accommodating. I was nervous they did not have English menus walking into this joint, but they did. whew. 

I will have to say this is one of the best meals I have had all year.  Yay food comas!

They also have a small store next to the cafe in case you want to buy any Lithuanian groceries.

Stop counting carbs and just go here. It&#39;s a good, hearty meal.

café-smilga-darien-2,Ingrid D.,Zf4qnQ4ANSB6IDAPhLylzw,"Oakbrook Terrace, IL",0,1,0,3,7,eUr4bKV7qhId_uFwbeu-pw,4.0,2010-03-14,"&#34;Do you want to order any meat? You&#39;ve ordered a lot of potatoes.&#34; 

Cafe Smilga is not for anyone counting carbs or on a low fat diet.  I met a couple of my foodie friends there recently for lunch; it was very enjoyable, but left me in a food coma. The menu is heavy on all things potatoes, all things pork, and all things fried. 

 We started out by ordering Red Beet Salad which consisted of beets, beans, pickles, carrots, and POTATOES. (I also detected black olives.) The salad was available made with either oil or mayonaise.  The waitress was asked which she prefered and we were told mayo, with a nod that led us to believe, &#34;what else?&#34; My friends decided to have the homemade bread kvass to drink. Kvass is a fermented beverage. I declined and decided to stick with water, but our kind waitress brought me a sample. It wasn&#39;t bad, very interesting. Smelled a bit like beer and I thought it tasted like a cross between beer and hard cider. 

Ordering, after that point, got even tougher. I had settled on POTATO Sausage. Some how in my mind I was thinking it was something like Swedish Potato Sausage, but it was a potato mixture studded with bacon (I&#39;ve seen it called potato bacon pudding) stuffed in a casing, served with a side of sour cream and chopped, cooked bacon in lots of bacon grease. (Oh yeah!!!) My friends had a hard time deciding between POTATO pancakes, Kugelis (grated POTATO cake), Zeppelins (dumplings made from POTATO dough), other dumplings and various pork dishes. I suggested we try the &#34;Kugelis, plain potato pancakes, dumplings with meat&#34; combo platter. It was at this point that the waitress made the POTATO comment, so we tacked on a fried &#34;Meat Pocket.&#34; The other items also came with sour cream and more bacon!!! 

The beet salad was delicious. Nice texture and great flavor. I was very pleasantly surprised. (Not a big beet person.) The potato sausage was heavenly. Unique texture, not like mashed potatoes, but not just grated potatoes, studded with bacon and held together with bacon grease. The potato pancakes were fair; they appeared to be deep fried; definately not as good as mom&#39;s. The &#34;Kugelis&#34; was similar in texture and flavor to the potato sausage, but sans casing and bacon pieces and it was fried, so the top and bottom were crisp. You definately could taste the bacon fat. The small dumplings were filled with ground pork. Slather on the sour cream and bacon pieces - a tasty treat. Some carmelized onions would have really taken them over the top. The fried meat pocket looked like very large, thin calzones. Not bad, but nothing special. 

After we started eating we realized that we hadn&#39;t ordered any Zeppelins, but that will have to keep for another trip. The meal with tax came to about $32.00 and we left with a couple boxes of leftovers. 

Cafe Smilga also includes a deli and carries many imported canned and jarred goods as well as bread and sweets. It reminded me of the German deli&#39;s back in Lincoln Square in Chicago.

But even then, when that happens I automatically contact the respective restaurant&#39;s customer service to rectify the situation. 

Second time I&#39;ve been here in 2 days. Of course your food is great, but the service seems to pleasantly above par. I came here yesterday and the cashier who rung me up was &#34;Nazal M.&#34; He has exceptional customer relation skills. I came in very close to closing time yesterday, and whenever I do this at any restaurant (Buona or not) it is not unusual to get death stares from employees. It&#39;s understandable. It&#39;s late, its a Friday night and everyone just wants to go home. Nazal however was very pleasant, light hearted, and did not make myself, or any of the other customers feel rushed. Based off his mannerisms and his customer service etiquette I actually thought I was dealing with a manager, but that appears to not be the case!

Because I had such a good experience last night, I came back again to pick up an order for myself and my husband. I used the app to place the order online (a naked beef bowl and a kids meal). Nazal happened to be there again today, and when he saw me he greeted me by my first name, and asked me how my Quatro Formaggi pizza that I ordered the night before was. Very impressive! He remembered both my name and order! 

Today upon ringing me up for my order he took the time to attempt to optimize my order. He saw that I ordered the naked beef bowl for my husband to which he said &#34;since it comes without bread, do you think he would like it with extra au jus? We can add it if you wish, it will make it much tastier!&#34; To which I said sure why not (excellent choice btw). After offering a couple other suggestions in a professional, NOT AT ALL PUSHY manner he rang me up. Upon giving me my receipt he mentioned that if I enjoyed my &#34;Quatro Formaggi pizza&#34; from the night before (which I did) he mentioned that Buona has a $6 special on all pizzas on Thursdays, and double points on Tuesdays. I was not aware of any of these promos. I&#39;m very glad he told me!

In short, I just wanted to share this positive experience I had at once of your stores two days in a row. The timing of both of my transactions were at a times that most other employees would be groaning and want to be in a rush to clock out of work. Not with Mazal. He truly seemed happy to be at work. 

If there was anything at all negative about my experience today it was that I had ordered the italian beef kids meal, and I wanted the sandwich with sweet peppers, mozzarella and hot peppers. I opened my order when I got home and saw none of those additions. A little put off by that since I paid an extra 1.50 for all of those things, and didn&#39;t get any of it. Not sure what was happening in the kitchen, because it did say on my recipet that those all needed to be added. That being said, because the rest of my customer service experience was BEYOND excellent I still give this a 5/5 and not a 4/5; thats how good the service was.

TL;DR: Italian beef is italian beef, but excellent customer service 5 minutes before closing time, and the very next day when it first opens is RARE. Download the app you get $5 off. Order with your phone and another $5 off your order. $6 any pizza Thursdays, 2x point Tuesdays. Originally came for the food, will keep coming back for the impeccable customer service."

The beef sandwiches have the right amount of juicy resulted in perfect moisture levels and at the same time the bread holds the sandwich beautifully.

Service is fast and courteous. Great selection of other food like pizzas which I love so much. They even carry Italian beer how cool is that. Fries are always refresh as actually everything else. The only bad thing on my last visit was that some little kids were screaming and running around and management did not do anything regarding this. Felt like it was chucky cheese for a moment.

The pizza was surprisingly not bad for being made at a beef place. I had the Buffalo chicken pizza, the chicken and buffalo sauce were pretty decent and the crust was good. They were personal little pizzas but filling enough to leave you a piece or two to take home.  It looks like the pizza day (Tuesday I think) is a popular trend because the place was packed with people on lunch from work and seniors looking for a deal.   I joined the club while I was there, you get a free beef on your bday and can accumulate points for free stuff. I would go back for lunch again both on pizza day or just to give some of the other stuff a try."

I have been to many of the Buona stores, including Berwyn and Naperville, but this one is my favorite.

The Buona menu is wide enough to appeal to almost every taste, but everyone comes for the Italian beef.  It is cooked just right (you will never get a sandwich with white / grey rubbery beef here) and more importantly, it is spiced perfectly.

They have plenty of specials and specialty items like the recent reuben panini.  Buona offers a senior discount and has a loyalty card that is better than anywhere else I have ever seen. $5 pizza night is an insanely good deal.

The place has a great sit down atmosphere and doesn&#39;t have a fast food &#34;feel&#34; in any sense.  The wait staff brings everything out to the tables and cleans up after you.  If you need anything, they are happy to get it.  I usually forget to ask for gravy on the side, but the wait staff takes care of that for me.  Very family friendly.

Highly recommended."

This location is tough because you also have Portillo&#39;s in the area, so it&#39;s worth comparing the two.  Portillo&#39;s has faster service and is all around better.  As far as the combo sandwich, Portillo&#39;s is always good, but I have had better combos at Buona Beef than at Portillo&#39;s more than once.  I usually get cheese on my combo here, but not at Portillo&#39;s.  I don&#39;t know what it is, but it is hit or miss here.  Portillo&#39;s is always consistently great.  But, there are times when the bread is dry at Buona&#39;s and the sandwich isn&#39;t all that.  Other times, it is better than Portillo&#39;s.  It&#39;s just whether or not I want to take the chance with Buona&#39;s. I wish they were more consistent. 

The cheese fries are very good here.  The paninis are noteworthy.  The pizza is better than I expected, but I&#39;d still go to a good pizza place first. The pizza is better than Domino&#39;s or Pizza Hut though.

However, I knocked one star down due to my last visit. I don&#39;t usually go through the drivethru but I was on my way home from work and decided to pick up a sandwich for dinner. My friend asked me to pick up a hotdog for him as well. I placed my order and I must have gotten a new trainee because she took forever and I kept having to repeat myself. I ordered a pollo pomodoro for myself and a plain hotdog for my friend both with pepsi and fries. Easy enough order right? The sandwich is cold and hotdogs are usually precooked.. so I have no idea why but it took over 7 minutes to get my food. and then when I got home I found out they put EVERYTHING on the hotdog even though I asked for it plain.

Also a huge fan of their Tuscan Harvest salad, too...mixed greens, apple slices, dried cranberries, candied walnuts &amp; gorgonzola with fat-free raspberry dressing. In addition, their personal pizzas are a hit with some of my co-workers.

The burgers are not that great I wouldn&#39;t recommend them. Their pizzas that you can order in the drive-through are absolutely amazing. The only issue I have is is the wait to get them when you go through the drive-through is exceptionally long because they have to cook a little bit longer. Five stars if it would take a little bit less time to get my food when I go through the drive-through would be great. But I definitely love their salads their soup and pizzas.

I&#39;ve been here twice since they changed the menu.  The first visit was with a group, so we ordered a variety of their 9&#34; pizzas.  The alfredo prosciutto pizza was amazing!  It was gone quickly and I was left wanting more.  The sausage pizza was a close second.  I was disappointed by the chicken pinolo pizza - I thought it would be better.

The second visit was just me.  I had the combo and a fruit salad (I really wanted a delicious-looking chocolate chip cookie, but I can&#39;t afford the calories right now).  The combo was good but not great.  There wasn&#39;t really a flavor that stood out and the hot peppers were disappointingly mild.

I was left thinking that when I&#39;m in the mood for beef, I should just drive a few miles further to Portillos.  Oddly enough, the fruit salad was shockingly good.  There was a good variety of fruit, all of it was fresh, and the presentation was almost artistic.  There was a slight hint of citric acid (a preservative), but I&#39;m okay with that because it adds zest.

Bottom line...Buona has some outstanding vegetarian items and I will definitely be back, but when I&#39;m in the mood for Italian beef beef or sausage, I&#39;ll be heading down the road to Portillos."

Just for clarification, that is not something I ever do. I&#39;m relatively easy to please. But this sandwich was made up of a chicken patty that was about half the size of the bun and had the consistency and flavor of a pre-cooked chicken breast that you might find in the freezer section of your local supermarket. It tasted fake and overly chewy, as if it had been processed in too many chemicals. It even had those fake grill marks on it. I honestly expected a grilled chicken breast and that is not what I got. You can get real chicken that has a better flavor at other restaurants in the area. I&#39;m also disappointed because I feel as though I paid way too much for such a disappointing product and I will be going other places to get better grilled chicken for a better price."

If you measure an establishment on first impressions, Taco Diner was dressed to impress. The quality of the chicken, steak and beef shined through with every bite. The chorizo was rich and heavy in spices, but certainly a great meat option.  The food is far superior to many options in this area, but keep in mind quality comes with cost. Excellent value for a quick-serve restaurant. The manager cleared our table and held a conversation with us, discussing other great options on the menu.

The food was okay, but they charged me 22 dollars for 3 tacos, chips and guacamole, a curro, and a bottled coke. They made me pay for extra salsa in a big container which couldn&#39;t have cost them that much to make. The salsa cups they give you are  less than an ounce. And then they only fill them half way. So you get barely any salsa to begin with. 

The food was okay, but it certainly wasn&#39;t worth the price they were charging. I was talking to some friends about my experience, they were also charged 3 dollars for a bigger serving of salsa to go. And had similar experiences. 

The only reason this place isn&#39;t getting 1 star is because the staff is at least super polite and kind. And I doubt it&#39;s up to them to charge me a crazy amount for the salsa."

They chatted me up, and told me about this place... claimed it&#39;s WAY better than the others in the area, including El Burrito Mexicano... well, I KNOW it&#39;s already cleaner than that dive.  After I finished a weight loss challenge at my gym, I was craving Mexican food so I had to try this place out before getting back on that wagon.  I stopped in during the dinner time rush to take food to go.  The place was pretty booming...most of the tables were full, and a few were waiting around for to-go orders.  I got the chicken flauta dinner which was around $10 (the going rate I&#39;d say) which included beans &amp; rice.  They were decent for sure!

I typically try not to review a place after only trying it one time so I held off for another time before reviewing his place.
This past weekend my mom suggested ordering in food, and I suggested this place - that I could go pick it up...we both ordered the flauta platter and an order of chips and guacamole.  My order was ready in 15-20 minutes.  Their guac isn&#39;t blended, there are chunks of avocado in there instead.  Needless to say it was good...so are the chips!  You can get an order in 8oz or 16oz...we got the 16 oz.  I definitely recommend checking this place out - to dine in, or to go!"

The place is kind of small and the tables could fill up fast if you go between 12:00-12:30.  We get there between 11:30-11:45 and have always gotten a seat.

We always get the steak tacos and they are heavenly!  The unlimited, complimentary chips and salsa are delicious and always fresh!

The gentlemen who is always there (possibly the owner?) gets 100% for his customer service!  Always extremely friendly when taking our orders and always walks around to each table to see how the meal was and if we need any refills on drinks or the chips/salsa.

I do agree with previous reviews - This place should really be $$ (my 3 steak taco dinner and drink came up to about $12).

Love the cozy atmosphere and open table seating. The chips and salsa for dining in was delicious. Warm chips and seasoned with 3 different salsas to dip into was awesome! My main breakfast meal came out shortly. For those not familiar with what I ordered its scrambled eggs mixed with tomato, jalapenos and onions. Served with a side of rice, beans and tortillas.

As we waited for our food, the manager came out with chips, salsa, and hot sauces.  The chips were homemade, the salsa was fresh, and the hot sauces were very flavorful.  For food, I decided to try the steak torta.  The sandwich was good, but nothing to write home about.  The steak was a tad dry and chewy yet still flavorful.

I ordered my food online ahead of time and went to pick it up.  The woman behind the register was slow and confused...  The guy came from behind to help her which slowed everything up.  The gentleman was very friendly though. 

As for the food.  It wasn&#39;t good.  I ordered Mexican nachos to share with my husband, a beef burrito and my husband ordered the tampiquiena (sp?).  Everything I ate wasn&#39;t good.  The Mexican nachos were odd.  Piled high with saucy cheese, guac and beans.  It didn&#39;t taste Mexican at all!  Tasted like velveeta.  Maybe regular nachos would be better...  The the burrito....ack.  When I opened it up, the burrito was covered in oil!  It was all shiny and disgusting.  My hands were soon covered in oil and the whole thing was a giant mess.  I have never experienced an oily burrito before and I don&#39;t want to again.  My husband thought his meal was pretty good which is why I have 2 stars.

  I tried lunch at Romeoville location.  Enchiladas Suizas- Sad, skinny enchiladas, no flavor, flat tasting rice, beans are beans (canned). and it took FOREVER!
  Guess I didn&#39;t miss much when I walked out. 
    I give them six months.
  See what happens

VERY good food. It&#39;s worth a stop. There was a Burrito place across the street MANY years ago. It was run by a biker &amp; his wife, That was where I got my love for giant burritos. I guess now you&#39;ll get the closest thing to that experience. I think there&#39;s a new sheriff in town as it relates to Mexican food. I told people who work in that mall that this place is legit. I told the guy at the gas station close by about Taco Diner &amp; he checked it out. Later that week, he thanked me for suggesting it. Enough said. Keep up the great work!!!"

I had 2 chicken tacos. The chicken was white meat which I like, not greasy like some Mexican places make it. Sorta on the bland side, but the salsa helps with that. Same goes for the steak tacos. Not really any type of marinade to them, but cooked well and not greasy at all. 

The manager brought us chips and salsa. Not sure if that&#39;s if that&#39;s because they&#39;re still new or if that is something that will always be free for dine in costumers. The chips were really crunchy. The salsas we&#39;re alright. 

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back to try other things like burritos and maybe get some rice."

Excellent steak!! Loved that the salsa is home made chips served hot.
Tamale was the only downside for me. It was a bit on the heavy cornmeal side and pork was tough/dry.  I just prefer a creamier cornmeal finish and like beef over pork filling.

My husband said the steak actually tasted like steak and not mystery meat like some of these other restaurants use. The chicken was also of good quality, they use white meat chicken in the enchiladas and I didn&#39;t come across any fatty, chewy pieces. The guacamole tasted fresh and they make theirs with chucks of avocado in it, it&#39;s awesome! Can&#39;t say enough good things about this place.

I really think places need to focus on one great salsa instead of 3 okay to good salsas. Prices are fair. Chips and salsa are free if you dine in (yay!). You can get your tacos taqueria style (cilantro and onions) or american (cheese, lettuce, tomatoes) or both. I think having these options. Sometimes you want something more ameri-mex/ tex-mex. Refried beans and rice were run of the mill. My husband liked his tacos and I enjoyed my burrito. I wish it had just been stuffed with meat, beans and a crap ton of cheese instead of having lettuce, rice, sour cream and tomatoes taking up space. Overall we enjoyed our meal. Still trying to find something more like what we got back home in Texas.

I want to give it 4 stars because it was better the the &#34;A-ok&#34; description that yelp gives it, but I can&#39;t since their description is &#34;yay! I&#39;m a fan&#34;. I think it is a solid 3.5 if yelp would give us half stars.

I studied abroad in Mexico for four months and when I get food at a place like this it better taste authentic, or I&#39;m moving on to somewhere else. I usually judge with an order of al pastor tacos, a tamale and an horchata. All three are AMAZING here and they&#39;re my go-to every time. I&#39;ve had the al pastor torta too and that was also very good (and big). Green salsa is the best.

Honestly though, when it comes to Taco Diner having competitive advantage, they don&#39;t really have one. Service was lacking,  and price was higher than their nearby competitors. I ordered a torta because it was the cheapest dinner. I mean $10 for a regular taco dinner? Come on. Anywho, they made my food which was carry out. When they went to give it to me, the lady said, &#34;I did you a favor and gave you one of each sauce, hot and mild.&#34; (1) Ain&#39;t nobody doing anyone no favors. (2) Did you ask me what kind of sauce I wanted!?!?! Not only is the service slow and lack there of, but the walls were a depressing gray, and decor was sparse. I don&#39;t even remember any music playing. I would not want to dine in, because they sell authentic Mexican food, yet do not embrace Mexican culture! It is not tex-mex like Chipotle. They sell horchata, which was also more money than any other regular beverage. FAIL! I really want businesses in Lisle to thrive, but it looks like they will need better business strategy. If not, they will end up like Taco Day and that other burrito place that was a Chipotle knock-off that didn&#39;t make it. Good luck bros."

First off, we got there pretty early, so it wasn&#39;t crowded. Our waiter was polite, but definitely could have spoken a little louder. He mumbled quite a bit and we had a hard time understanding him.

The bread and dipping oil was delicious.  I ordered the chicken noodle soup with my meal and it seemed like someone was a little heavy handed with the black pepper. Also, there seemed to only be one large piece of chicken in the whole bowl of soup I was given. But it still tasted wonderful, just couldn&#39;t finish it with all that heat.

I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken with arugula and the lobster ravioli.  I loved it all!!  Only complaint is that my chicken seemed slightly burnt on the outside, but I ate it anyways and it was delicious.

I also got to try a bit of the pork tenderloin with the port sauce and I will definitely be ordering that the next time I come.

Overall, a great trip and I look forward to trying this place out again."

There&#39;s just much better Italian food in the Chicagoland area. 

We arrived on a Saturday around 5:30pm, waited about 10 minutes for a table. We were seated right next to the bar. Our server, Noel, was fantastic. Very attentive and didn&#39;t rush us to leave when we were finished with our meal, even though there was quite a wait. Although not his fault, the timing of our dinner otherwise was quite rushed. Our salads came out right away, and our entrees arrived less than five minutes later, which was a bit annoying. I had the spaghetti and meatballs, which was nothing to write home about. 

We skipped out on dessert since nothing sounded amazing and went to Oberweis right down the street instead (yum)."

Thats all you can find out here in the burbs. I wasn&#39;t feeling really well so that might be the reason why this review may sound a little blah.

We usually come here around normal dinner times like 5pm. Well, I worked all day and neither of us had a chance to eat dinner so we were looking for quick food without a drive thru. All the typical saturday night restaurants were still crowded so we drove over to carrabbas to check out the parking lot since we knew they closed at 11:00 pm and it was now 9:30 pm. They were fairly empty when we got there. The hostess and the manager were very nice and greeted us immediately when we entered. We were also seated right away. 

Our waitress came over right away to get our drinks. Her name was Tessa and she was so nice. We ordered quickly and our food didn&#39;t take long at all. The waitress came by to check on us a few times which was great. The food was good. This location is pretty consistant with their food (I&#39;ve been coming to this location for a few years). 

I ordered the tuscan grilled sirloin with garlic mashed potatoes and a side salad. It was good and exaclty what I expected. My boyfriend ordered the fettuccini weesie which he enjoyed.

We got in, we ate, and we left haha. They were on their game. I know some places are busy on saturdays and the staff are tired and ready to go home during that last hour of being open. But, everyone at this carrabbas still had great attitudes and were polite and the food was the same quality cooking you would get at say 5pm.

The service is Amaya great...  Love the ambiance.  Slightly romantic feel with the pin point lighting. 

I have never really had anything bad here.  Although I love there Chicken Soup.  So good if your sick cause it&#39;s chicken soup but a little spicy. 

It is a little pricey if you compare it to the Olive Garden, but I never do cause it feels so different.

While their menu is a bit more limited, I think the food tastes better, the atmosphere is more intimate, and (in my few visits) the patrons have a bit more class.

The first time I came here was when my bf and I celebrated our one year anniversary nearly two years ago. We haven&#39;t been back since due to our agreement to avoid the Route 59 corridor as much as possible. After visiting florists with my step-mother, she wanted to get something to eat, and I suggested Carrabba&#39;s as it was across the street.

We were seated immediately and were given glasses of water while we browsed the menu. I already knew I&#39;d be getting the Tag Pic Pac, which is what I got the first time I visited and I fell in love with the flavors of the dish. Tag Pic Pac is Tagliarini pasta in their housemade Picchi Pacchiu sauce of crushed tomatoes, garlic, olive oil and basil. My step-mother decided on a large bowl of Mama Mandola&#39;s Sicilian Chicken Soup. 

We were brought some bread with the oil and spices for dipping. The bread was piping hot, soft, and delicious. I love their blend of spices used in the oil; there&#39;s just something about it. I  think it may be the slight hint of red pepper, which gives it a bit of a kick but not enough to overwhelm the other herbs.

Our food arrived quicker than expected, as I was still digging in to my side salad which could have easily passed for a regular salad order. It was huge.

My step-mom&#39;s soup looked and smelled delicious. Unfortunately I wasn&#39;t able to capture a picture as she dug in immediately and polished off the entire bowl in under ten minutes. My Tag Pic Pac was as I remember it; a large portion of pasta, plenty of delicious garlic and chopped basil with a huge basil leaf for garnish.

Our waiter was very attentive the entire time but bothersome. Our meal was less than $20, but of course we didn&#39;t order alcohol.  I can&#39;t wait to go back and hopefully try something new. But it&#39;s so hard to say no to the Tag Pic Pac."

An aside of sorts. All restaurants should consider how they seat customers. Why is there a need to sit people on top of one another when the place is empty? Might it be a good idea to sit families with children together instead of sprinkling them throughout the restaurant?"

The goat cheese bruschetta is amazing and I love when they have it. I also got the lentil soup and their house salad as my entrée. The soup was spicy and delicious and the salad is always my favorite. Plus their oil, herbs and bread tops off the meal perfectly. I didn&#39;t get desert this time around, but I get the chocolate dream dessert when I go for dinner and it is one of the best things I&#39;ve ever eaten.

The menu looked excellent, the reviews promised tasty bread and good shrimp pastas. Our experience didn&#39;t match up at all.

The bread was disappointing to start with. It was doughy, cold and dense with no discernible difference in texture between crust and crumb.  The oil with &#34;Italian herbs&#34; was just small clump of basil stuck in the center of a tiny saucer of olive oil. 

The soup was fine. I had the sausage and lentil, and while it was nothing outstanding, it was filling and chili-like. I enjoyed it. The salads were a bit sad looking, just lettuce, dressing and croutons, but they tasted better than they looked. 

Our entrees were the most disappointing. My brother had ordered the pizza and it was flavorless. My mom had a lobster ravioli, which was slightly better, but tasted more like a seafood chowder than anything else.  

I had the Pasta Weesie and it legitimately smelled like ammonia. I have no idea why. I thought I was going crazy, but other people at the table smelled it and agreed. My dad thought it just smelled strongly of cheese, but the dish&#39;s description didn&#39;t even say it had cheese. Besides the odd smell, I was expecting something not too heavy, since it was advertised has having a &#34;garlic and lemon butter white wine sauce,&#34; but it was close to a heavy alfredo sauce. 

Just overall a very disappointing night.  I normally like to let the waitress know if somethings wrong, since of course they can&#39;t fix things they don&#39;t know are broken, but frankly I didn&#39;t even want to see how they tried to fix things here."

The food was very good, my dad&#39;s fried/ baked ravioli was the winner on the table.  My lasagna was very good, my mothers chicken arugula dish was okay, but not near as good as our other items.  Sausage and lentil soup was awesome, and the Sicilian chicken soup was quite tasty.

The reason for the low rating was the food.  Our visit was on a Saturday afternoon between three and four, a definite off time. The restaurant was not packed at all, pretty slow actually. We were welcomed immediately upon entering and our server was great (I think his name was Scott very tall, nice kid.).   I ordered the baked ravioli, which stated that it was a new item, along with the Sicilian chicken soup and a soda.  My husband ordered the lasagna and chicken Parmesan combo.

My meal:  The soup, delicious!!!  I am actually going to google that recipe :-) my baked ravioli, terrible, over cooked and tasteless.  It was so dry, not even the sauce  could save it. Also the soda, flat.

My husband&#39;s meal:  chicken parm was definitely overcooked.  The breading was dark brown and dry and actually curling up, that&#39;s how dry it was.  No taste whatsoever.  The lasagna, while moist, was very bland and mediocre at best.

We aren&#39;t restaurant snobs at all but did want to give our opinion.  The service and soup was excellent but the food, disappointing.  Maybe an off day for the kitchen, but enough of a reason for us not to make a return visit."

This would explain the extra minutes for it to arrive at our table.

The bread was freshly baked with an olive oil/herb dip, the salads were fresh greens with homemade dressings and the entrees tasted as good as they looked!

Ordered Salmon dish, fish was very fishy, not fresh. Fish and veggies served with meal were all different temperatures on the plate. Everyone at table tried what I ordered and agreed the bad smell was coming from my plate and the food was not appetizing. Other menu items ordered at the table were pizza, very small serving and oily looking. Olive oil was supposed to top the pizza but the whole bottle? Chicken Parm was also ordered by someone else at the table and that dish had no issues.

I had the Seafood Cannelloni, and it comes with 2 pieces. I wasn&#39;t starving, so it was perfect, and very good. Also had the tomato bisque soup as an appetizer and I liked that a lot as well.

My roomie, however, didn&#39;t fare as well. He ordered a sirloin, to be cooked medium. When our food came, he cut into a well-done steak. He wasn&#39;t going to bother complaining because of being afraid to send food back to the cook. I suggested he at least let the waitress know. He did, and she let the chef know and he came out and said he was cooking up another steak. My friend noticed that when the chef went back in, the cook glanced back out way, probably to see who complained.

He got his new steak, and it was nearly rare...bloody as heck, and my friend said it had no flavor compared to the last one. We said nothing and later the manager came by and apologized and said he&#39;d take the steak off the bill and said they were usually very good with their steaks.

The new baked ravioli. They take fried ravioli and put a small amount of sauce and cheese and that is supposed to be baked ravioli.  Nice idea but needs improvement.

I think that&#39;s exactly what my friends and I said when the pitcher of sangria came.  When you think pitcher of alcohol, you might imagine something that you and your friends could get a few glasses out of it. Not here, a pitcher of sangria (for $25.00) barely gave three of us a glass a piece. A huge rip. We would have been better just ordering sangria in individual glasses. 

The food was good though. I had the seafood pescatore, which was spicy and really delicious. There was a lot of mussels and shrimp in the dish and it was completely worth it. My friend ordered the fried mozzarella wedges and it looked like something that came out of the freezer aisle. My other friend ordered a pasta dish and added shrimp to it. When he got it, he actually asked if he could have a refill because it was so tiny.  

The bread was excellent along with their dipping oil. That was probably good so my friends could fill up after their dinner. 

If you&#39;re looking for a light lunch or dinner, then come here. If you&#39;re hungry and looking for a hearty meal, then try somewhere else. For the price, it&#39;s just not worth it."

The service was pretty good, but the food is fairly ordinary.  The bread is good.  That&#39;s about it.  The salad, some iceberg, carrot shreds, and 2 olives.  Yep, 2.  The dressing was ok, but nothing spectacular.  I had a chicken dish with prosciutto, but they forgot to include the prosciutto, so I had to send it back.  Not bad, just nothing to write home about.  Same with the grilled vegetable side.  My wife had something equally ordinary.  
The kitchen must have been having a really off night.  I saw/heard 2 other tables complain about something.  But the staff was very accommodating about making people happy.

Edit:  One more thing about the salad.  I think they pre-make them, plate them, and put them in a cooler that is too cold.  The lettuce had a little frost on it.  Pre-plating salads is bad enough as there is absolutely no reason for it, but when the cooler is too cold, you might as well not serve it at all."

However, I feel like though there are Carrabas in a lot of places, I never get that chain restaurant feel that I do from let&#39;s say....Olive Garden or Red Lobster or TGIFridays or, you get the idea.  Hey, you might knock a chain Italian restaurant, but Carabas is on the Zagat list; they can&#39;t be that bad. The service has always shined for me at this particular location.  I feel like I am always greeted by friendly people, promptly brought menus, drinks and hot steaming bread along with their signature spices.  I will say that if you do come to this location on a weekend night that you are going to wait.  But they have a bar you can wait at.

I have had drinks here, they are generally good and strong.  They have a few martinis that are some of my favorite if you are into that type of thing and they also have a pretty decent wine selection.  The menu is pretty tried and true Italian but they do usually have some seasonal specials that they change a few times a year, which is always refreshing.  The waiter that we had this particular night was really friendly and helpful with making our selections.  Their portion sizes are pretty large, and I wasn&#39;t starving so I opted for Chicken Caprese Panini with a Tomato Cucumber Salad as a side.  We started off with a Seasonal Bruschetta special.  The Bruschetta which I believe was called Bruschetta Caprese was amazing.  it was really different and very good.  The Panini was pretty good, but I probably would try something else next time.  I really liked the Tomato Cucumber salad; it was very refreshing and obviously, lighter on calories.  I have had various other pasta dishes, chicken dishes here and really haven&#39;t had anything bad.  I would say that some of my favorites from here are Spiedino Di Mare if you love seafood or the Piccata (either Chicken or Veal).  

At this point, I was stuffed and ready to go home and take a really long nap.  However, Carrabas also has one of the best desserts.  If you are a chocolate lover, you HAVE to get the Chocolate Dream.  But, they also have some really other great desserts and usually have a special one as part of their seasonal specials.  

MANGA!"

I almost always order the lobster ravioli, and it&#39;s a great dish because you get a decent amount of ravioli slices stuffed with the juiciest pieces of lobster.  As cliche as this may sound, it really, truly is to die for!  The cheese pizza is very good too.

The nice thing is that Carraba&#39;s service is friendly and quick.

The food it self was GREAT! Some of the tastiest food I have had in Naperville. I think the waiter name was Erik, he was perfect. What made me rate this place with 3 stars was when I first came in.. I was not greeted nicely and I am guessing it was because my husband and I are black. The hostess had the nastiest attitude and went as far as to try to seat my husband and I on the other side of the dinning area. She passed up at least 10 empty tables and 5 empty booths. The side that she tried to seat us on was completely empty. I had to ask her can we seat and dine with the others if she did not mind? In return she took us all the way to the front by the door. Almost as if we were infected or something. I was super irritated and did not act out but still patronized the business. I&#39;m just not sure if I will return.

Appetizer: The calamari was greasy and the color of oatmeal. The red sauce was the saving grace as it camoflaged the greasiness.
Salad:  The Italian salad was doused in dressing and the greens were wilted.
Seasonal Special: The Mama Rosa Chicken dish certainly did not look like the meal served on television. For $18, our one very small chicken breast was split into two different recipes.  They were stuffed with about a teaspoon of filling each, had no mushrooms on top of the one piece (as pictured), and was SO SALTY!  We had to ask for more water three times!
We were offered either broccoli or mashed potatoes as a side, not the macaroni as pictured. The broccoli was mushy and overcooked.
By this time, we noticed that others had bread on the table. We had to ask for that. Awful. They call that Italian? It was not crusty, very spongy and just plain old dry.

We did not want to take a chance on dessert and got out of there quickly.

We will NOT be returning to this or any other Carraba&#39;s.  We were disappointed that we had spent all that money and should have gone elsewhere."

The atmosphere was nice - they were pretty busy still at 7:30 pm.  We called ahead, but still had to wait about 15 minutes. They really don&#39;t have a very large waiting area and felt like we were in the servers way while we were waiting. Once we were seated, our waitress was very friendly and was attentive but not to the point of being annoying. We told her it was our first ye, and she explained the. Specials and how the menu was organized, got our drinks and have us plenty of time to make a choice. My wife chose the Clam Linguini, our daughter n chose the cheese and spinach cannelloni, my son has the sirloin Marsala, and I had chicken Marsala. Everything was very tasty and prepared perfectly except the cheese and spinach cannelloni - it wasn&#39;t any better than a &#34;Stouffer&#39;s&#34; frozen version. That was the only thing that we were a little disappointed with other than the prices. - that a long with the cannelloni is what&#39;s keeping me from giving it 5 stars. For 4 of us the bill was eighty four bucks - thought that was kind of steep considering pasta is very economical to make.  But you decide!  Over all we liked it; but wouldn&#39;t be real frequent at those prices.x"

Sometimes a chain transcends this fugue, like Copeland&#39;s down south, or Outback which isn&#39;t so bad if you order wisely.
This place stands above the fray.
The bread and oil with herbs is a fine starter.
Ordered the Beef tenderloin with spiedies of scallops and shrimp.
It came with a pasta side, but I&#39;m not an alfredo guy, so I asked for &#34;agli-olio&#34;, which is not on the menu. I expected to get a blank stare from the waitron, but got a &#34;yes sir&#34;.
Encouraging!
A standard Italian salad came with the meal, which was fine
The main course was really good! The steak cooked rare as requested, and seasoned well, the seafood the same way. The Pasta was a bit different than other Agli-Olios I&#39;ve had, but tasty nonetheless.
This seems to be a chief feature at Carrabas, they do things differently.
On one visit, I ordered baked clams, and Wife ordered Scampi (as appetizer)
The clams and shrimp came with the same topping. Hmm.
Both dishes tasted like many things, none of which were traditional baked clams or scampi. Not bad, mind you, but not what we expected
We sent the scampi back, which prompted a visit from the Manager. He was apologetic, and offered to re-fire the dish as a traditional Scampi. It came back and was fab. 
Hmm. Somebody knew how to cook in that kitchen, and the manager wasn&#39;t afraid to abandon the corporate mandate. Try THAT at KFC.
It happened again when Wife asked for Italian Sauteed Spinach, also not on the Menu. 
Appeared at the table and was spot on.
Compared to the Chef-Boy-Ar-Dee crap you get at Olive Garden, this is fine dining. 
I, for one was surprised, and multiple visits have proved this was no fluke.
A solid 3 stars..."

For an appetizer we had the Antipasti Plate which is their Calamari, Bruschette, and Mozzarella Marinara. It was all sooo good.

Usually when I go to a new Italian place I play it safe and go for fettucine alfredo, but I am so glad I didn&#39;t!

For my main meal I had, Seafood Cannelloni which was also amazing. It&#39;s Lobster, shrimp and scallops, blended with roasted garlic and chives, topped with a light tomato cream sauce and crabmeat.

And just when I thought it couldn&#39;t get any better. I got the Chocolate Dream for dessert. Which is a rich fudge brownie brushed with Kahlua,with chocolate mousse, fresh whipped cream and homemade chocolate sauce... I swear they should rename it the Chocolate Orgasm! 

Since yesterday was Wine Wednesday where they take $10-$15 off wine we also had the peach sangria.

Word to that.  I sincerely enjoyed everything from our order of mussel appetizers to the abundance of food I got for $22, which included a salad, 8oz filet, and 2 side dishes.  And watch out, Jimmy John&#39;s, the free smells wafting from the wood fire grill would rival yours.

What I did not enjoy was the size of the table.  The bread basket, our doggie bags, the salad plates and the entrees that came out so fast they were practically served on top of the salad plates barely fit on the small space.

Also, it&#39;s nice when a small and large portion of an appetizer are on the menu, and the waitress has the courtesy to clarify which size you want when you order.  Too bad our waitress didn&#39;t do that and instead opted to just charge us for the large helping of mussels.  Luckily for her, I am a newly pronounced fan of mussels.

Some people are iffy because its a chain restaurant, but I like the food and the atmosphere, so who cares. And this place beats out a large number of &#34;specialty/mom-pop&#34; restaurants anyway. 

We have tried a lot of different entree&#39;s and have enjoyed most of them. My personal favorite is what used to be called &#34;Whitefish Wolfie&#34; with its artichoke based sauce. The Linguine Pescatore is spicy and good. I liked the Chicken Bryan. Nice Ministrone. Nice Caesar salad. etc. etc. The kids have loved playing with the dough they give them if you ask... and then even baking it up on occasion. And we still like to sit up front by the open-kitchen to watch everything being made.... especially on cold winters nights.

We made a reservation, and they were about 10 minutes late on getting us a table. Not a big deal. The AC was pumping and it was kinda cold, not a big deal. The decor was very nice though, and we sat next to the kitchen. Very nice environment minus the cold.

Our server was very nice, but I think they were short staffed, because she was very busy. She was very knowledgeable and made great recommendations. We ordered appetizers and dinner. It took a half hour for the appetizers and over an hour for the food.

The food was delicious and very enjoyable, however it was very salty. All of us commented on how salty our soup was. We mentioned it to the server who was more than happy to let us try other soups, but we declined. Then all of us noticed our entrees were very salty also. We&#39;re not picky people either, it was noticeably salty.

The menu was decent, especially the appetizers: mussels, crab cakes, etc.  I&#39;m a seafood junkie...We settled on the crab cakes and it was delicious.

Apparently there is the option to get a few of the dishes in a smaller portion, but the menu was vague on which dishes they were.  I asked our waiter, but it was still confusing.  Oh well.  I settled with a fettuccine alfredo dish.  I liked it because it wasn&#39;t a heart attack in a bowl AKA it wasn&#39;t overloaded with heavy cream.  But it was very simple.  An incompetent person like me could PROBABLY made something just as good at home.  It by no means is an expensive place, but I don&#39;t think my dish was worth the $16.

I actually found my experiance to be quite the opposite. While I found the service here to b quite good and the atmosphere was comfortable I found the portion size on many dishes to be quite small. We went as a group of 4 friends. While I found the seafood pasta dish my two friends got to be a nice portion size I found my cheese stix to be a rip off and my other friends seafood dish portion size to be extremly small as well. While the cheese stix had great flavor and bredding, the large order (which cost almost $10) was a joke portion size. In the past they had giant wedge shaped cheese stix that were really good. The cheese stix they have now are flat and really thin. I actually thought I somehow got the small order. My other friends seafood dish was soo small he actually asked for a refill on the pasta. At $17 his plate should have been full but he was served a child size portion. While I found the taste of the food here to be quite good the portion sizes will keep me from coming back."

Really glad we did. The food was outstanding and the new owners and staff are going all out to develop this into a successful family type Italian restaurant. The new menu is a step up in sophistication from Buonaro&#39;s while retaining a few of the it&#39;s favorites. The baked spaghetti was better than ever. At urging of owner tried the Farfalle Alla Mikey and loved it. This will be our place to go when we want good italian food with comfortable welcoming environment.

The bartender was kind and polite. The menu seemed limited. I havent been to this location before but have been in Florida. Im already not a huge fan but was craving spaghetti. I ordered a $5.00 app at the bar,,they had 5 different apps for $5.00. I tried the zucchini frites, the bartender said those are one of the best. It was totally gross,,,the vegs were cut like french fries, obviously and they were sooo deep fried and soaked with oil they were limp. Ever think of letting the oil dry? I then waited for a real long time for a plain bowl of pasta with olive oil and the place was empty. 
Service was fine...nothing to write home about. I wont be going back. The plain pasta bowl was $10.00....really????"

I had no idea what it was about,but considering most of the other offerings here,we decided to try this place.It was not horrible.It was okay. Not a huge selection for a non land dwelling critter eater,but enough of a selection that we stayed.

They offer wines by the glass, bottle and something they call a Quartino-about a glass and a half. I liked that option, as a solo glass of vino can be so...solo! 

The food was decent,not great,but certainly tasty. Portions are not as huge as some places and that is not an entirely awful thing. It really is rather obscene to have a platter of food come to your table and it is just for you!Don&#39;t get me wrong, the portion size was more than enough to fill me, even had leftovers...which my honey promptly took care of! I had a pasta dish called Pasta Weesie....an Alfredo with sauteed shrimp,mushrooms and tomatoes served with Linguine.He had Lobster Raviloi.Both dishes were tasty. Service was quick and friendly .Rebecca was both prompt and helpful.

One thing I really loved were the mini portions of dessert. Served in a shot glass ! Just the perfect size to end a meal.They have six different offerings daily. Just ask and your server will tell you what is available on that day. I had a mini cannoli and he had a teensy baby sized Tiramisu.I hate ordering desserts at many places. You get a huge hunk of cake that is way too much,even if you share.

If we ever find ourselves in the area again, I would not hate stopping in for a bite.

Huh...I just found out this is a chain. I had a feeling,but no others in the area.That makes more sense to me.now."

Nothing too terribly fancy but simple, well appointed, nicely staffed and, above all, tasty. The dish that makes it so is Chicken Marsala and it&#39;s their sauce that is so incredibly good. The chicken is good, too, moist and tender, but that&#39;s not so hard to pull off. NOTHING compares to their marsala sauce. 

The usual bread is also a treat, served beside olive-oil and their own special seasoning. Asking for grated cheese for the bread adds that much more pizazz.

Service is great, too. I go there so often, they usually have my order on the grill when I walk in the door. Say &#34;hi&#34; if you see me there, usually on a mon, tue, or wed evening."

Orders were Chicken Trio Combination and Spaghetti Topped with pomodoro sauce
and meatballs. Both entries came with a choice of soup or salad. We both ordered the salad but in hindsight should have ordered the soup. Salads were plain, uninspired. House dressing (creamy Italian parmesan) was tasteless. A good salad goes a long way and why they can&#39;t provide at least a &#34;good&#34; salad is beyond me. Will choose soup next time. 

Mains were not disappointing. I decided on the chicken trio since it was the first time eating there and I&#39;d get a sampling of 3 different mains in one (Chicken Bryan, Pollo Rosa Maria and Chicken Marsala). For the side I ordered Spaghetti with marinara. All three chicken dishes were very good in their own ways but my favorite was the chicken marsala. Never had a piece of chicken taste like steak before. The Bryan was very tasty and different and the Rosa Maria was good but the least liked out of the three. I will DEFINITELY be trying the pork chop marsala next time (honestly, they could probably put a piece of shoe leather in that marsala sauce and it would taste wonderful). The Spaghetti Topped with pomodoro sauce was very good. Pasta was slightly overdone to my liking, sauce was good but the meatballs where disappointing. Very mushy with little flavor.

Service was good, can&#39;t complain.

For the value at this price point I give them 3 stars. If the price was more expensive I&#39;d give them less stars. Dinner for two for less than $75 is a good night for me. I&#39;ll be going back.

 HEY! Its a chain."

This was like eating at the Olive Garden, but darker inside.  The sangria was awesome I must say!  I had a side Mediterranean salad which was great.  It had field greens, kalamata olives, fennel,  onions, tomatoes, and a wonderful balsamic  dressing.  The pizza- sausage and pepperoni was a MESS.  It was like pizza  made on a pita bread instead of pizza dough.  Very soggy.  Not the worst pizza, but I have had better.  I will go back to try the pasta later.  The pizza no way."

However, the interior is very warm, inviting and much bigger than it appears from the outside. 
The waitress was very nice and attentive with our table. 
The complimentary fresh bread came out warm, moist and fluffy which went fabulous with the herbs in the olive oil; we must have gone through 4 baskets.  The bruschette was very good and had a citrus flavor to it, though we had to ask for more toast, as we only received about 5 half slices to go with it. The calamari was devoured in minutes and was (from what the rest of the table told me) was great. I ordered the Pasta Sostanza which was pretty good aside from the lemony flavor in the entire dish, which was especially overwhelming in the artichoke hearts ( I had been hoping for fresher tasting artichoke flavor). Another person at my table ordered a fish dish and had a problem with too much lemon as well. 
The portion sizes are pretty big, my bowl of pasta was HUGE; the whole bowl made about 3 meals for me (I took home leftovers).  
A bit more pricey than an Olive Garden, about $100 for 4 people (no drinks, 2 appetizers and 4 entrees) but I&#39;ll go back as long as the chefs ease up on the citrus."

Ahhhh, I still remember their $5 footlong sandwiches back when I was in high school *feeling nostalgic* 

I got the turkey breast footlong sandwich for $6.75. The person there asked if I would like my sub toasted, which was a plus since I&#39;ve never gotten my sandwiches toasted at a Subway before (unless it was a chicken or meatball sub). The ingredients seemed pretty fresh and everything was filled up, something that I always appreciate because I hate it when there are just scraps left. I wish they covered them though like the Subway closer to where I live, so nothing could accidentally get in (like a bug). They also have guacamole that you can put on your sub, which I guess is new!

&#34;Don&#39;t put so many olives on there!&#34; &#34;Make sure you only put three slices of cheese!&#34; &#34;Hurry up, you&#39;re taking too long!&#34; On and on it went, with this poor teen being harassed by his manager in plain sight of a customer.

As he was ringing me up, the kid gave me an extra cookie that I hadn&#39;t  requested. He said it was on the house. I gave him encouragement and told him never to let anyone talk down to you like that and to start looking for another job ASAP. He laughed and said, I already am!"

I don&#39;t care much for subway because it can be a hit or miss with the freshness of the veggies. I don&#39;t automatically say &#34;everything&#34; because I want to peep the freshness of the veggies before they put them on my sandwich. 

Also, I suggest you really watch them make your sandwich because the employees tend not to listen. the other day I had to ask an employee three times for pickles and today I had to tell the employee twice not to put lettuce on my sandwich as she was putting it on there.

The condiments are more or less what you would expect (mustard and mayo, oil and vinegar,  a couple of different types of salad dressing). You can have a bag of chips and a pop to make a meal out of it. The result is tasty, and less choleric than McDonald&#39;s.

Easy to read menu as well as specials posted above the front entrance. Ice cold Zwiec beer, love it, or if you prefer caffeine, your choice of soft drinks and of course, great coffee, and a cool carafe of water at your table.  Along with your cool water you get a huge basket of rolls, with a heavy dark bread, a sweet raisin bread and delicious rye bread. This also comes with butter and crackers. 

They usually have 2 soups to choose from, homemade of course. And very filling and definitely delicious meals, chicken, pork, beef, sausages, pie rogues, Glumki (cabbage rolls) all are equally delicious. Great sides such as sour kraut, sweet cabbage, beets, mashed potatoes and gravy again all homemade. 

Desert is simple but home made, usually a fresh baked item  or a oversized Kolaczki!!

I had stuffed cabbage, sweet and sour cabbage, potato dumplings, a cup of spinach n rice soup, and for dessert an apricot kolaczki. Mind you, this was one dinner order! So you definitely get your moneys worth and a good portion. The place is busy so get here at a reasonable time. Will be back!"

That said, I had two significant issues: they were not busy, but service was s-l-o-w. Getting our drink, easily 1/2 hour. Also, even though the duck shows up three different spots on the menu, they were out if it very early in the evening. 
That said, my chicken/pork combo was good and the bread dumplings, better. Everyone else was satisfied with their meal. 
So, if you enjoy this cuisine, I&#39;d recommend it. For me, meh!"

The bread basket was good and my daughter had the cold borscht soup which was very good. My husband and I had the Sauerkraut soup which was served without too much Sauerkraut and only luke warm. We had pieregios for an appetizers of cheese and mushroom Sauerkraut which was very good but again served lukewarm to cold. We had the breaded pork tenderloin with bread dumplings which again was served luke warm. It was just okay. I think this restaurant could be better. I like my food hot.So I don&#39;t think I would go back to many other good polish places to eat.

Everything is very greasy and completely blend. It&#39;s not what the real Polish food taste like. It really lacks flavor and quality. I don&#39;t mind paying top prices for good food but these prices (for the quality and flavor) are very high. Even desert was terrible. The only pleasant thing was a coffee, fresh and nice tasting. 
Also, if you like your bread basket (as you usually get at any European restaurants) you will be disappointed....they don&#39;t serve it. Instead you will get an extremely greasy deep fried pancake or whatever it&#39;s called. And no, it&#39;s not Polish.
The staff and service was really sweet and attentive. 
Will never go back and would never recommend."

The service is always excellent here, and we always get the same server. They know us despite months apart between visits probably because we&#39;re the only Asians who dine here. I&#39;m going to make it a mission to find out the server&#39;s name next time because I feel bad that I&#39;m referring to him as &#34;the guy with the ponytail.&#34;

Don&#39;t know what to order? Hungarian goulash potatoes is the go-to dish! It comes with a side of veggies, soup and dessert. The beef noodle soup is like a party in my mouth. I&#39;m on cloud nine when I eat their apple strudel. You get a basket of bread with crackers in it, and the type of bread varies depending on the day.

Got food coma and just want to sit or lie down comfortably after your meal? Keep dreaming because all the benches and chairs are rock hard! I just go home and sit comfortably reminiscing what a great meal and experience it was.

You probably have no business going around this area since it&#39;s kind of in a bufu area, but definitely make the scenic drive down here to check out this restaurant if you&#39;re coming from up north like me!"

Not being familiar with Lemont eateries, I trusted my fellow yelpers to point me in the right direction.  Once again, they came through.  It is definitely NOT  American food.

It is sort of Polish with a twist.

It is a small, intimate, place:  11 booths and 6 tables, 2 of the tables were set up for 6.  Wood ceiling and plenty of ethnic decor.  Home cooked, family recipes, can&#39;t go wrong.  If you don&#39;t like the way it is offered, they will prepare it to your specifications.  Once my husband got over the color of the gravy for his Sauerbraten, he slopped up every bite.  And the best part, dessert is included with your meal.

Our server, Martin, was very attentive and answered all our questions, and his beer recommendation ~ a BIG success.

From the bread basket to the kolacky, everything was delicious."

We started with potato leek soup.  Very good.  Had a homemade taste to it.  We really wanted to try their pierogi so we asked if we could get just 2 instead of a full order (6) because we knew we couldn&#39;t eat 6 and still eat our entrees.  No can do (-1 star).  We next had pork loin and stuffed cabbage rolls.  The pork was good.  The cabbage rolls had a different taste to them.  The filling was dry.  The &#34;sauce&#34; was pink and watery.  Skip the potato dumplings.  They were soft, gluey and chewy.  The sauerkraut had a different taste to it.  Maybe it was just old.  The prices are OK considering that entrees come with soup, potato, cabbage and a dessert.

Only because other Yelpers seem to like this place I would say give it a try if you are nearby but don&#39;t go out of your way to get there."

The decor of the restaurant is charming with European style finishes. Their menu has an assortment of Lithuanian, Polish and German dishes and gives you the ability to mix and match as desired.

We were a little bummed out that the roast pork wasn&#39;t ready yet, but we DID arrive early. The potato pancakes were as good as advertised and the pork tenderloin and duck were fantastic.

However...

The fish fry was disappointing. Stopped in last Friday. They have a Friday special, all you can eat fish fry. 

Not sure what type of fish they use, but it was mushy. So much so, the three small pieces were enough of all you can eat. The sauerkraut was too sweet and the potato dumplings were rubbery.

One person in our party had lived in Germany for a couple of years. She ordered the German Plate and said it was EXCELLENT. I ordered one of the daily specials, Bavarian Chicken Breast with sides of beets and bread dumplings. Awesome. The chicken had a light sauce on it that was very enjoyable. The bread dumplings were much lighter than I expected and with gravy, they were delightful. True comfort food. Another of us ordered the Schnitzel w/ Portobello and it too was very good. 

I did not expect to like it this much because my experience with Polish and German food has been spotty. But this was very, very good. I feel bad not finding something to criticize, but it was a remarkable meal. I&#39;m definitely going back."

I particularly like the combination platters (German, Lithuanian,  or Polish).  I have had each one many times, since I struggle to pick a favorite, since each one is delicious. But I have a Hungarian friend who loves the goulash, which has huge chunks of tender meat.  The liver dumping soup is excellent too .  Even the bread selection that comes with dinner is top-notch.  Save room for the kolacky dessert (apricot is my favorite) with coffee. 

Put this on your bucket list!

The restaurant is decorated like many restaurants I have been to in Germany, Austria and Hungary.  It is an overall European dining experience that should not be missed.  It is like a quick trip to Europe.

We will begin with parking, on the main street very little, turn into the parking area located in the back, plenty of parking for all the new and older restaurants in the area. You will also see antique stores to shop at and art studios. On to Old Town, they have been in business for 23 years, as long as we have been visiting them. The décor is done similar to Highlanders, located in Chicago on Archer Ave. The wood working was done by the same person that did Old Town. Beginning with the soup and bread basket, Lithuanian rye bread, babka sweet bread with raisins and pumpernickel. On Saturday they have a Polish fry bread, served hot and when wrapped in butter, delish. You know by the taste of any soup you try, they are all home made. The soups that were on the list for the day were beef noodle and goulash, a beef and veggie soup, in addition to two others. The main courses, roast pork, bread dumplings and gravy and chicken paprikas were on the menu the day that we visited. All of this is served with soup,  sauerkraut or sweet sour cabbage, beets that are sweet and sour. You will find many sides and different specials daily. With one server, he did a very good job in keeping everyone happy. Pick your cold bottle of Polish beer and you have just had a wonderful meal at a restaurant that is sure to fill your belly.  You will  get kolacki or a sweet cake at the end of your meal, also home made. After the meal, take a walk in the area, or go home and take a nap."

Not knowing what to expect we decided to give it a try.

The food there is excellent.  My mom had the portabello mushroom schnitzel and I tried their Black Forest Schnitzel....both very good and tasty.  Mine was a pork cutlet stuffed with a mushroom sauce on a bed of dumplings...my moms was portabello mushroom dish (which looked great).  Then my brother decided to try the pork chops which also looked delicious.  

Each dinner came with the choice of soup (we all had beef noodle which looked like Mrs. Grass&#39;s but was still good) and side (cucumber salad, beet salad, or sauerkraut) and dessert (all they had was a peach coffee cake which was a bit dry).  They also have  a full bar in the back of the restaurant which has an interesting selection of domestic and imported beer.  

I will definitely come back and try another dish (maybe something Polish or Lithuanian) perhaps around the holidays.  Its a smaller restaurant so there is a more intimate feel to the place (unlike a place like Szalas) and they have all kinds of trinkets and pictures from Germany and Poland."

old-town-restaurant-lemont,Phyllis S.,zgj2nnvhMs8ZU2QYYFKrVA,"Portland, OR",1,1,0,73,20,Bag3j3rp_ZwOMTYgDFRL0Q,3.0,2011-05-22,"So, my friends wanted to eat after a trip to the Hindu Temple (not all in our party were fond of Indian food) and it was too rainy for a picnic, so we decided to go check out Old Town Restaurant. 

Before we ordered, we were brought some frybread. I&#39;ve never seen this before(at a German restaurant), but it was very tasty!

I had the Black Forest Schnitzel with some sauerkraut and the liver dumpling soup. The kraut and soup were really good and the schnitzel was AWESOME &#39;cause it was stuffed with mushrooms. (I&#39;ve had better spaetzle tho.)  Also, the dinner came with desert, so I had  the chocolate cake. The cake was very unexpected, almost like fudge with a graham cracker-crust and topped with walnuts. I liked it.  I also had a glass of Riesling and I was happy with the quality. 

Now, mind you, over the past year I&#39;ve happened to eat at about 5 German restaurants, so I&#39;m only judging the German food. (I can&#39;t speak to Hungarian, Lithuanian or Polish, cause that&#39;s not my specialty.) I&#39;ve also eaten  Wienerschnitzel mit  Spaetzle in Germany, and so I can be a bit of a tough audience sometimes. It is my favorite dish.

I can say without reservation that this was the best Schnitzel I&#39;ve had all year. I was disappointed with the spaetzle, as it was kinda watery and soft.  The gravy over the top was very yummy. 

A nice thing I noticed is that for those of you watching your carbs, they had schnitzel served over portabello mushrooms, which my friend seemed to really enjoy. 

I was a little disappointed that the sandwiches weren&#39;t available on the weekend. Also, I was NOT impressed with the choices of beer. 

Also, FYI, if you go as a group, they will NOT do separate checks. When we asked, the waitress just walked away and left one on the table for us."

From the outside, the place doesn&#39;t look like much, but step inside and enter Eastern Europe. Not Soviet-style Eastern Europe, mind you, but the kind of cozy, wood-paneled place one would find in Krakow or elsewhere in that part of Europe. 

Everything I&#39;ve tried here is delicious. Personally, I think the Stuffed Cabbage, Hungarian Goulash, and the Pierogis are winners, but you can&#39;t go wrong with either the Polish or German Combination plates (I haven&#39;t tried the Lithuanian plate yet). Don&#39;t forget the bread dumplings! 

If I wanted to die early of a heart-related disease like all of my Polish/German ancestors, I&#39;d come here all the time, but alas, it cannot be so. Even still, I highly recommend a trip to Old Town for some fantastic Eastern European cuisine in an authentic setting."

The Old Town Restaurant offers a looooot of meaty dishes!
We went there couple times and having dinner there was always very nice.

We ve always been greeted by the same happy waiter, really nice guy. :-)

Oh yeah, and the restaurant itself looks like a big wooden cabin from the inside and has a lot of cool decoration. The restaurant is located in the beautiful downtown of little Lemont. 
You could eat there after walking or biking at the Michigan and Illinois canal trails (it s very nice at this time of the year!) or after strolling around in the antique and thrift stores nearby.

This place is totally worth the trip!
Definitely an authentic place."

With her directions, and my sense of adventure, I said great ... and wound up on the Black Partridge Forest Preserve ... which had I been dressed differently would be what I would be reviewing.

Nonetheless, after storming a canal, I arrived in this wonderful, neat looking town and at this equally sweet looking restaurant. Totally charming. It smelled good too!

Old Town is about eating European and when they brought on the menus I found quite a few choices and super prices for not only the lunch, but dinner options.

My friend decided on the Budapest potato pancake (which I later found was like what I would call a goulash), and it was a goulash, but with a pancake. I picked the Stuffed Cabbage. They were both around 11 bucks.  

Not to be outdone by other &#34;European&#34; venues, the Old Town Restaurant offered quite a bit with the meal. This included great soup, a choice from a variety of spuds (or bread dumplings), beets, sauerkraut, or sweet/sour cabbage. They also have a salad bar, though I&#39;m not sure if that would have been included.

Massive portions and our lunch entrees were massively mouthwatering. I got a taste of that Budapest goulash (very good) and I really enjoyed the Stuffed Cabbage ... their version had the &#34;stuffing&#34; with a tomato sauce.

Old Town has a decent selection of beer and wine, and their coffee was decent too.
We took our kolacky&#39;s to go, and simply waddled out.

Not only was the food great, but the place is cozy and classic for this type of food. And the service was friendly and almost subliminal. 

My time driving aimlessly around Lemont was rewarded with a new friend in the Old Town Restaurant. Nice!"

I celebrated my 60th birthday at the Old Town with 40 people.  Everyone had an awesome time.  Our wait staff were attentive and put up with our rowdiness.  2 Polish waitresses even sang Happy Birthday in Polish to me.  I brought in my own cake.  Our food was heavenly as usual.

Previous review still stands:

Oh My Goodness is this place D-I-V-I-N-E!  Eastern European food - home-made, luscious, flavorful.  

Polish, Lithuanian, Hungarian, German:  goulash, sausages, pierogis, sauerkraut, homemade bread, tartar sauce, soup.  The chicken noodle soup is like golden sunshine in a bowl.  The Hungarian goulash is just slightly hot - you feel it in the back of your throat;  the beef melts in your mouth.

All this in downtown adorable, picturesque Lemont.  It really isn&#39;t too far to go to.  I swear.  

OK - I am Slovak and was raised on this food, but my German-food hating Irish husband actually loves this place too.  They always have fresh pan-fried fish that will knock you out.

My only negative comment is that their desserts are lousy.  Pound cake that is too dry; kolackies that are worse than Jewel Food Stores&#39; kolackies.  I don&#39;t know what this is about, but after eating all the food they give you, you don&#39;t have room anyway."

Stopped for lunch, enjoyed pickled beets and a very nice liver dumpling soup. Service was perfect, smiling, happy to see us, invited us back.

One of the better Eastern European places to go for good food at a good price. I&#39;m Polish, German, Czech, and Croatian so this is the kind of food I grew up with. Now it isn&#39;t as good as what I make at home (naturally) but it&#39;s an excellent place to go when you want to try this type of cuisine or you&#39;re sick of the same restaurants or take out options. The food here is much better than Bohemian Garden near 75th and Lemont Rd. and you certainly will get full with all the food you get. I look forward to coming back as it&#39;s the best restaurant I&#39;ve found in this area for this type of food. 

Downtown Lemont is a great little area to visit, especially when the weather is decent and you can walk around outside for awhile. I&#39;m a local so I may be a little biased but I would recommend anyone coming to the area, stopping in some of the small shops, having a drink or two at some of the small bars, and getting a great meal at Old Town to finish off the afternoon or evening."

The customers can be jerks, the ladies behind the counter were very nice.  A sloppy looking old guy grumbled as he stomped away with his sandwich in hand, &#34;don&#39;t even speak English...&#34; I was tempted to confront him, call him an intolerant jerk and walk away.  There was definitely not a language barrier.  The ladies have accents, but if you can&#39;t understand them, that&#39;s indicative that you have a problem, not them.

The parking lot is tough to get in and out of because there is a lot of traffic coming and going from the DMV and the small grocery store in this strip mall.

The sandwiches taste the same regardless of location. I can tell you the employees smiled and were friendly. I can also tell you the restaurant has a tight middle aisle and is not spacious.

The restaurant is located off 75th Street near Rickert Drive. Parking is available in the strip mall lot, and it can get crowded around lunch time.

- Tostachos - very tasty and lots of texture
- Oxtail Burger - great layering of flavors
- Double-diner Burger - great classic burger
- French fries - crispy and cooked to perfection

We split the pierogis -- a MUST if you come here (potato and onion, obvi). 5 come to an order and they&#39;re just perfect pillows from heaven. You&#39;ll love em.

The girls and I all tried different cocktails and we had so much fun sitting and sipping for a while after our meal was done.

We had a table of 6 gals out celebrating Olivia B&#39;s birthday! Our table started with an order of the pierogis which was a surprising menu item, but very yummy! This dish comes with 5 homemade pierogis - either potato and caramelized onion or sauerkraut (we went with potato and onion), pan fried in sage butter for $10.

I&#39;ve been on a champagne kick for quite some time now, so it was only natural that my first cocktail was the Pom Pom. I can&#39;t remember all that was in it, but the drink included prosecco and vodka. My second cocktail was their grape cocktail - again, can&#39;t remember what was in it but it was fruity and delicious! Just a heads up - the drink menu on their website is different than the one we were given at the restaurant. 

The waitress told me their blue salad was awesome so I ordered that, and she was right! This salad is so good you guys. Not only does it look pretty, but it tastes amazing. Mixed greens, grilled tenderloin, gorgonzola, roasted fennel, tomato, cherry peppers, onion strings, and house made blue cheese vinaigrette. Need I say more? For $16 this salad is pretty big and the tenderloin was on point. 

As far as dessert goes, all they have is pie which is kind of a bummer. Luckily the bartender was able to whip us up some chocolate martinis! Sweet, boozy, and perfect for celebrating."

I knew we&#39;d be hungry before we went gallivanting around, so I found somewhere to have dinner while I waited. The boy has a love affair with burgers and as soon as I exited the train I saw Burger Local... 

The hostesses informed us that it would be a 30-40 minute wait, so we put our names in and found a spot on one of the couches in one of the lounge areas to wait. A server came by and took our drink orders, so we let her know that we had our name in for a table. She asked how long and wanted to know if we also wanted an app while we waited. We let her know we&#39;d think about it while we waited for our drinks.

I ordered a cider and the boy ordered and Irish mule to which the server said they could make. My guess is that they don&#39;t have it on the menu and don&#39;t typically make by her response. When it came out it didn&#39;t taste quite right, so the boy asked for some limes to see if that was the missing factor. Turns out it was. Mistake fixed and his drink tasted way better!

We did opt to order an app while we waited. We started with the Tots while we waited for our table. They are fried in duck fat, topped with braised short rib, parmesan mornay, grilled leeks, and drizzled with gravy. These were obviously handmade tots! Everything paired together very nicely giving the tots a really great flavor with just the right touch of saltiness and smokiness. My only issue was the coating of the tots. It was a little tough and chewy. 

The server was nice enough to check on our table wait a few times for us. It took an hour instead of 30-40 minutes. There was a room with arcade games, so we spent the rest of the time in there playing Ninja Turtle and Burger Time so we didn&#39;t get too antsy. 

For dinner we both order the Mac &#39;n Cheese with Pork Belly. I added schrooms to mine and the boy added chicken to his. I wish I could remember the 3 cheeses the server told us were in there, but I can only remember white cheddar. Anyway, the combination was really tasty! And the noodles they used were the kind that hold the sauce down inside of them which is great! Since we had an app, we both ended up taking leftovers home for lunch!

Our server was super nice and attentive! She answered all of our questions. We had the same one from the lounge area for dinner which was nice. All of the stars are for her and the food. 

The hostesses - there were 3 - were really quite terrible. They stood around socializing and ignoring people for the most part. There was no need for more than 1 considering the servers were covering more area than they could handle on such a busy night. The hostesses could also use some better training on how to speak to customers and estimate wait times! As nice as this seems, the treatment from the hostesses alone will prevent us from returning."

The place is trendy, cool and had a friendly vibe. There were couples, families and various groups keeping the spirit up throughout the late afternoon. 
We tried a couple craft beers, nothing that we loved, but they had 8-10 beers on tap to try. The beers rotate, so you won&#39;t see the drafts on their online menu. Also, the Sunday special is $2.50 Miller Lite drafts, an affordable option. 

As for food, I can&#39;t believe I tried them, but we ordered the tostachos...three tostadas with lots of toppings including chorizo and ready, oxtail. Um, the were good, but it was hard to get the idea that I was eating meat scraped off a cow&#39;s tail. Also, my husband got a bone, thank the Lord that that was not in mine!!! It&#39;s still weird that I ate it. We also ordered the deviled eggs, they had an uneven distribution of toppings (lobster and bacon) throughout the egg mixture which was disappointing on a could of the eggs. 

For our entrees, the guys both had the four pepper burger with fries. They both loved all of it and each burger was cooked correctly. I tried a bite, and I really enjoyed the crispy jalapeños. My friend ordered the tacos of the week w/a house salad. She really enjoyed them and ate every bite. I ordered the house salad with salmon. The flavor combination was awesome and so was the dressing and the salmon was cooked to perfection. 
I will certainly go back. I would ask for a tasting of the beer before I order and skip the apps to save room for the more delicious entrees. Oh, and we did not have to wait, but it gets busy, go at an off time to avoid a long wait."

We purposely arrived at 5pm in order to avoid the typical 2 hour wait on a Friday night. We started with lobster deviled eggs and tater tots topped with duck fat and braised short rib. Tots made to perfection--crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with delicious toppings. This time I ordered the 3 pigs burger which I split with my husband. After 1 bite, I wish we didn&#39;t. Definitely the best burgers in tri-cities area. Looking forward to trying their other burger creations."

It&#39;s rustic looking and the burgers are pretty decent, but it feels like it&#39;s trying way too hard. I&#39;ve been here several times on the invitation on friends who heard good things about it. I&#39;ve never been terribly impressed. 

The staff is nice and I would definitely come here if I wanted a place to meet business associates for a quick bite, but otherwise, I won&#39;t revisit. Don&#39;t misunderstand. It&#39;s a solid restaurant, but It doesn&#39;t stand out which it gets a 3/5 star A-Ok rating. This might even be a decent dinner date spot for a quick walk around the area afterwards."

We came on the later side and were seated right away and had really good drinks. I loved the blueberry basil margarita, good slightly strong but still able to taste the ingredients.  My husband said his Moscow mule was good as well.

We had a mushroom appetizer and each had burgers. One bite in and my husband said it was really good... four bites in he made me try his Hawaii burger and it was awesome. lots of flavor and cooked perfect. I also really liked my burger and the fries were very crispy. The prices are on point for what you get. We loved the entire meal and presentation as well. 

The décor is really cool, kinda dark and lots of TV&#39;s to keep the guys happy. The only reason we are knocking a star is the music is really loud... then later they even turned it up louder. It was like a club at 9:30 at night in Geneva on 3rd street when people were still eating. It would have turned some people off way more than us I would bet."

The brisket is tender, and the burger cooked perfectly.  I love that they have side options; the mac and cheese is delicious.  We also tried the pierogies to start, and they too were good.  I like having starter options beyond the typical finds.  My only (small) complaint is that the seating is set up more for nightlife, with long tables to accommodate multiple people.  This meant the possibility of a not so private lunch with my husband.  Instead of dining with strangers, we opted to wait a few minutes for an outside table."

And told me to come back at 6 and wait for a table. 


Anyways after all that, I did get there and honestly was impressed by their food. Best onion rings I&#39;ve ever had. 

We ordered 2 Asian pork belly burgers, the 3 pig burgers, pretzels , bbq cheeseburger and fried oysters.
I was blown away by their fried oysters. Just overall two thumbs up for the food. 

The Asian burgers came with wasabi aioli - I wish I could taste the wasabi, that was the only one thing I wish was different !!"

We got lucky and sat in bar while waiting for table and bartenders are attentive and gave great recommendations on craft beers. Love the decor, very modern but comfortable with sofa groupings to wait or eat your meal. The burger menu is diverse and quite gourmet but if you like just beef on a bun, you will still enjoy it. The beef is pure brisket, so fresh and juicy so you have to order it medium rare. I tried the short rib burger on pretzel bun and it was probably one of the best burgers I&#39;ve ever had!

We would have waited for a table (told an hour), but a couple seats opened at the bar- and we are good with that!  So only 10 minutes for us- and another got moved up a bit... Worked for all. 

Let me start With the bartender, she was great.  Attentive, suggesting drinks on special drink menu- and quite delish!  

Menu- nicely appointed with many options to choose from!  I had the shrimp burger from the &#34;protein&#34; section of the menu- umm hellllo, yum yum yum!  Fresh.  I chose the brioche bun vs. pretzel, side was fries. Garlic salted perfection on the fries!  Really really enjoyed- will return for that hands down! 

Hubby went for a typical burger - but he said it wasn&#39;t typical at&#39;all!  Probably the best burger he&#39;s ever had!!! Full of flavor.  His side was a salad - whateves.... I go for gusto with fries in a burger place.  He was playing good boy.  

Played great music- loved the cool black chandeliers- might steal one ;)  Go and plan on waiting a bit - it&#39;s cool- have a beverage or give them your phone number - take a walk - they will call u!!!

When our group of friends wanted to get together for the first time after the holidays, we couldn&#39;t find a place for a reservation around 7:00 pm, so we decided to take our chances and try out The Burger Local.  Any place that lists my favorite Negroni on the menu as a featured cocktail is worth a look.

My lovely wife and I arrived around 6:00 pm, and the place was really hopping.  A check in with the hostess told us that there was a 1-1/2 to 2 hour wait for a group of our size.  We put in our phone number and since the bar was two deep, decided to beat a hasty retreat right up Third St. to our favorite place for a nice pre-dinner libation, Wildwood.  A quick text to the rest of our friends, and we settled in for the call.

The wait was really about 1:15 and The Burger Local was no less crowded but louder when we walked back in. Thankfully we were seated right away, presented with menus and drink orders placed. The aforementioned Negroni was spot on.

For apps, our group shared the potato and onion pierogis and the portobello croquets.  I&#39;ve eaten my share of pierogis in my day, nothing better than Mom&#39;s homemade, but the entire table enjoyed the lightly pan fried, nicely sized gems.  The croquets were mezza-mezza, actually very finely chopped mushrooms, but the cream sauce accompaniment was really delicious.

My wife and I both opted for the Double Diner burger, her&#39;s with fries and mine with onion rings.  The burgers were really good, the pork belly, pickles and egg added nicely to the flavor, and my onion rings were stupendous, accompanied with another nice sauce, this time pepper jack.

As a group, our only real complaint is that most of the food was overly salted.  I&#39;ve read some of the other Yelps here complaining about lack of flavor, but to us, too much salt does not necessarily mean better flavor.

There were some other menu items that looked intriguing enough for us to plan a return visit, but next time I&#39;ll ask them to hold back on the NaCl if they can."

I had this inside out burger which was great, the burgers are HUGE and very juicy. It was definitely one of the best burgers I&#39;ve had. My husband had the double local which he loved.

Being a fan and loyal customer of Barrel + Rye my expectations were exceedingly high and were exceeded. I found out from Sarah at the other location (who always provides me with stellar service) that an owner by the name of Nick is the culinary genius behind the menu items at both locations. So Nick whoever you are (I know you but you don&#39;t know me) your culinary talents are greatly appreciated to say the least.

Where do I start with all the fabulous menu items? The pepper jack dressing is so unique and SO good on the taco salad and of course they don&#39;t just throw chunks of meat on the salad. The high quality meat is extremely tender and deliciously seasoned. You will find this same meat on the cobb salad at the other location. As far as the burgers go any one of them would be to die for but I personally like the double diner and the lamb burger. I also highly recommend the mushroom appetizer. Another fabulous appetizer is the combination oyster, sausage, and onion ring appetizer.  I don&#39;t like oysters but I would be tempted to order it and ditch the oysters. The sausage is obviously made in house and it has this great home made taste. Please be aware though that with all the fried food selections this dish is rich and is best enjoyed with another person. The attention to detail is mind boggling. Many of the sauces and sides are just as good as the main dishes. I especially like that the two locations have different items and each location has a distinct theme. 

I congratulate Nick on his obvious success and look forward to what he will bring us in the future which would hopefully be another location."

The décor is sort of a cool, eclectic mix with rustic, homey features.  We chose to not wait and sit in one of the &#34;lounge&#34; areas.  This was outfitted with a couch, coffee table, and 2 lounge chairs.  I would not have chosen this, but my son wanted to sit there.  He thought it was a fun novelty to sit on a couch and eat at a restaurant.  The light fixtures are huge, black chandeliers that fit with the rustic chic design going on.

I decided to order an appetizer for my meal.   The waitress who was fine, nothing exceptional, recommended the Tostachos over the Tots, so I chose the Tostachos (tostada &amp; nachos). On the menu, it is described as follows: smoked oxtail, chorizo, black beans, pico de gallo, guacamole sauce, queso fundido, fresh tortillas.  If I was blindfolded and did not know what I was eating I would have said some sort of protein on a fried corn tortilla with some sour cream, queso, black beans, and greens.  I didn&#39;t taste any pico de gallo or guacamole sauce.  One bite had some funky dry piece of micro green that was the texture of straw.  (yes, I had to spit that one out.)  By the menu&#39;s description, I was expecting an explosion of flavors.  That was not the case.  The meat was supposedly smoked oxtail and chorizo, but you could&#39;ve said it was soy protein and some ground beef and I would&#39;ve believed it.  Bland and flavorless.

My 11-year-old is a foodie and knows a good burger when he tastes one.  He ordered the BBQ burger.  It was on a pretzel bun with bacon, cheese, bbq sauce, and an onion ring.  It came with fresh cut fries.  I asked him what he thought (I also tried a bite).  I concur with his review.  He said the burger had no taste at all, the bacon was hard to bite off because it wasn&#39;t crisp enough, there was hardly any bbq sauce (he had to add some ketchup for taste), and the bottom of the pretzel bun was soggy and mushy with grease.  I asked what he thought of the pretzel bun and he said, &#34;It&#39;s a pretzel bun.  Hard to go wrong with that, except it&#39;s all wet on the bottom.&#34;  The fries were the best thing on his plate.  

What a disappointment.  When &#34;burger&#34; is in your restaurant&#39;s name, I would expect an excellent burger.  The actual burger had no flavor at all.  Don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll be back.  We usually give a place at least 2 tries, so if it is better next time, we&#39;ll let you know."

Service is outstanding.  There were a few things I wanted on the menu and just couldn&#39;t limit myself to just one.  Our server got a little creative for my wife and I and worked in some ways to do this (not for free, but did not expect that at all).

I&#39;m 27 and spend a lot of time at live concerts, so volume isn&#39;t really a problem, but having to scream at a place I&#39;m sitting down eating is rather annoying. The music was insanely loud at 7PM.

I had the short rib burger and OMG was it delicious. Everything on the menu looked good so it was hard to make a decision. 

My only complaints are that their fries are coated in salt!! Way to much. Also the kids Mac n cheese was terrible; you could taste the raw grittiness of the flour and absolutely no cheese flavor! Our waiter was not attentive at all so that was kind of annoying. Luckily the burgers were all delicious so  I can look pass these negatives and look forward to trying it again."

Pros: the interior is beautiful. Except for a few stray wires that were running up along one wall, it&#39;s gorgeous inside. MUCH more inviting than the former Mexican place. Lots of TVs everywhere. But yet does NOT have as much of a &#34;bar&#34; feel to it as one might expect. The light fixtures are really cool. The waitress we had was attentive and sweet. 

Cons: The meat had no flavor. I had the double diner and if it didn&#39;t have all the extras on it, I would have literally sent it back. The burger by itself would be so bland. When I bite into a burger I expect really mouth watering taste. I didn&#39;t get that with this burger. I was really disappointed since the place is called BURGER local. I work in the city, so maybe I&#39;m spoiled by all the choices and flavors and variety out there, but this definitely didn&#39;t come anywhere close to other burgers I&#39;ve had. Even Tom and Eddies and Smashburger are better tasting than this place. The ONLY saving grace on the cool &#34;plate&#34;... was the fries. Delicious fries. They were some of the best I&#39;ve had. I would say take your $12-15 (the cost of their burgers) and find another place. I&#39;m really surprised since these are the same owners as Barrel and Rye.

The only other note I had was that there is no noise dampening in the place, it&#39;s all hard surfaces so it gets really loud in there. 

Suggestion to owners: find a way to flavor the burgers better, or get a better source of meat. And add noise dampening to reduce the noise level when it gets really busy."

While burger local is a typical burger joint, what they do offer are amazing non-beef selections for people like me. I was debating between the shrimp burger (have you ever heard of such a thing?), the porto burger which sounded fab and the black bean burger. Our fabulous waiter Eduardo steered me to the shrimp burger and I was extremely delighted with it! The flavors were incredible! You could really taste the unagi sauce and the sriracha aioli.  It was also very light and my boyfriend was debating on getting rid of his ridiculously oversized burger in exchange for a shrimp burger, but he soldiered through with the black and blue and said it was delicious despite being grossly obese. The onion rings were crazy good as was the cheese with queso fundido."

Burgers are made from brisket which works surprisingly well.  

The only drawback is the lighting.  I&#39;m in my mid 40s now and my eyes are already starting to shift into Hans Moleman mode, so even with adequate lighting reading small print can be a challenge.  When you dine here you feel like you&#39;re in a midevil dungeon.  I can almost hear the screams of the tortured coming from the kitchen.

here&#39;s a tip, folks - good food, good service... but if you want to preserve this feel as part of your ambience, have some kind of light apparatus at each table (not a dim candle) to assist us old farts in reading the menu."

Watching those HUGE burgers come out on cutting boards will get your taste buds rolling and they looked amazing! We started with some great Deviled Eggs that were finished with a touch of crab meat &amp; hot sauce.. so good; you get 6. Unfortunately we got a bum steer on the burger and ordered the &#34;Inside Out&#34;.. It was good but can&#39;t be cooked to temperature; didn&#39;t come with any condiments and was pretty plain.

The restaurant is actually quite dark and there are TVs lining the wall. It has much more of an upscale bar atmosphere than a friendly family place like I thought it would. My husband and I were uncertain if it was baby-friendly because all of the tables and chairs we could see were bar height. The hostess said they had shorter tables in the back with high chairs, so we decided to go ahead. 

Our baby wasn&#39;t in the mood to cooperate, which obviously isn&#39;t the restaurant&#39;s fault, but because the tables are small, the food was placed right in front of our baby, and it was burning hot. She grabbed it and burned her fingers and started screaming. The waiter just seemed embarrassed and nobody was kind about the fact we had to rush baby out of there, though brought the check &amp; a to go container very quickly. 

The food was okay; my SIL really enjoyed the French dip burger and when I got to taste it, it was great. My short rib burger was kind of dry and the short ribs themselves were good but were lost on the burger overall. My husband had the pork burger and it was just okay. The onion rings were mostly batter and the fries were only okay. 

In short, restaurant is not really baby-appropriate, fancy food is only okay, and it is very fashionable so if you&#39;re a young family of dorks just trying to grab a burger, this place is not for you."

It doesn&#39;t get a whole lot better than this. Well, unless you go down the street to Barrel + Rye which is owned by the same people.

We have some shopping to do on Saturday and were in the Geneva area. We started to go to another restaurant that we have had good luck with recently, when I remembered that her friend had told me about this place.  The sister restaurant to one of our favorite restaurants in Wheaton used to be located here. Apparently, the owner of that one, for whatever reason, decided to open a burger joint. We&#39;re really glad he did.

We were greeted at the door as we walked in, and seated immediately. The host was very friendly. As we came to find out, this was going to be the same with all the staff we met. Our server,  was at our table within five minutes to take our drink order and our drinks arrived at the table shortly thereafter. He also took the time to explain several different things on her menu. We decided to start off with the deviled eggs. If we had one thing that wasn&#39;t outstanding at this restaurant, it was these eggs. They were good, however somewhat bland. I hope they read these, because all those deviled eggs need is a little bit more punch by maybe adding a spice or mustard.

My wife had a standard burger with fries and I decided to try the BBQ. My wife always orders well done ( wife or life of me I can&#39;t figure out) and I medium rare.  Both were prepared to perfection. I got fries, she got the tater tots.  not sure I  would refer to them as tots, more like teenagers. These were easily three times the size of normal tater tots.  they might not be prepared to everybody&#39;s liking, but for us, having them on the slightly undercooked side was great!  Back to the burgers for a second, these are not your fast food burgers. These take two, if not three hands to eat, and make sure you hang your head over that plate, because they&#39;re very juicy. 

The beer selection look excellent, however we can&#39;t speak to it since right now I&#39;m on some medication that prevents me from trying it. Trust me, I&#39;ll be back.

We now have two excellent choices for lunch or dinner when in Geneva, and luckily they&#39;re owned by the same individual which means the quality and service should be consistent.

We highly recommend."

The place is great! We also love Barrel &amp; Rye so its nice to see the owners carried over that same theme/feeling to this place. At the time we went we didn&#39;t know it was the same owners. Found out after reading all the other Yelp reviews. We loved the feel of the place, comfortable like a local place should be. There are many different sitting areas throughout the restaurant to sit, have a drink and wait for your table. 

Food was great, we had the Portobello mushroom appetizer, liked the flavor and the dipping sauce complimented it well. We both had burgers. I had the short rib burger, cooked medium, and I have to say they nailed the temp on the burger, with the side salad. The vingerette dressing was perfect, just the right amount of acidity but not overpowering and they didn&#39;t drown the salad in the dressing. 

My wife had the chicken chorizo burger and liked it a lot. Good spice flavor to it but didn&#39;t blow her mouth out so that all she tasted was hot or spice heat. 

Service was good, our waiter was attentive without being intrusive. The two hostesses when we walked in smiled and greeted us right away.

The burger was cooked to a nice medium rare, had some smoked gouda cheese and bacon, all were very good.  My only complaint was the actual burger patty, it didn&#39;t seem like it had any seasoning.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s a good burger and quite large, but I just felt it could have used a little seasoning.  The service was very good and overall the place is clean and nice.

Fantastic drinks too... on that note the last star was not given due to the length of time waiting for the drinks. When we finally got them they we great! Ordered the Jammy jam and some 3rd Street thing and  both drinks really wet the whistle. Our server, Adam, was awesome, everything we needed was right on point. Went to go tell the manager about the awesome experience and the first question was, &#34;do you have a complaint?&#34; NO THIS PLACE ROCKS why are you fishing for complaints??? So to conclude there were a few idiosyncrasies but overall I&#39;d come back over and over again."

They were so good! I had the BBQ burger with a side of mac &amp; cheese. My brother had the short rib burger. Both were great. This is one of the best burgers I have had. The only reason I&#39;m giving it 4 stars is because the service was slow and we were seated right under the air conditioning vent. It was freezing!

Stopped in to give it a try and first impressions were good.  It&#39;s a nice place although a little noisy.  My daughter and I both ordered the double diner burger and it was just barely ok.  The meat really had no flavor so if not for the pork belly and egg and pretzel bun and sauce it was a tasteless piece of meat.
The only forgiving thing was the fresh cut fries...they were pretty good.   But, at $12 a pop, just not worth it.  Sorry."

They try to bring something new to the table but end up with more of the same. The fries were too salty to eat, the mac and cheese just didn&#39;t taste very good and the greasy burger came out wrong. The staff was nice enough but they need to get some new teenagers at the hostess stand. The girls there today were full of judgement and eye rolls as they glared at every single person that came in the door. Typical teenager thing, I&#39;m pretty sure they have no idea how to keep a straight face yet. Wait staff was ok but with only half of the tables full, I still had to flag the waitress down for refills, etc. I stopped in after the lunch rush so I&#39;m sure everyone was just tired out."

The first time, I waited ten mins with a drink in the comfy couch and enjoyed the decor.  Service was friendly, and the salmon Caesar was delicious!  My rating that night would have been a 5.  I brought some friends back on Sat night and had a totally different experience.  We were given menus and seated, but a server never came to see us until I flagged one down after about 25 mins.  At that point, we were told that the kitchen just closed ten mins ago.  As we were there for dinner, we left and went to Barrel &amp; Rye (same owners), which was fabulous.  Didn&#39;t make sense why they gave us menus and let us sit for so long when the kitchen was closing.  The rating that night would be a 1.  So for now, it&#39;s a 3.

The funky tots were great (I think they will be a main course for a couple of our group if they ever return), and we liked the Portobello croquets.  We had 2 Black &amp; Blue burgers, a local, a French dip, and a burger of the week (with a perfect sunny-side-up egg).  The burgers were delicious, prepared properly, and generously sized (most of us halved ours for left-overs and to save room for dessert). The fries are some of the best around, the mac and cheese is very good, and the side salad with citrus-ginger dressing was a wonderful complement to the grill on the burgers. We had Key Lime pie for dessert, which was excellent; we were surprised that it came with vanilla ice cream, but that went very well with the thick graham cracker crust.  However, we could barely hear each other speak.  We arrived for an unusually early dinner -- 4 o&#39;clock --  and beat the crowd that trickled in over the next hour, but even so the cavernous space seemed to absorb our voices before they crossed the table, and the loud music made me want to finish up and escape as soon as possible.  Given the abundance of good restaurant options in Geneva, I&#39;m not sure I will choose to come back here.  Maybe at 3 o&#39;clock and a table for two?"

This thin crust is the real deal- it&#39;s a nice crispy crust with just the right amount of sauce and toppings.  My personal favorite here is the extra sausage well done.  Their sausage is perfect here- it&#39;s super mild tasting and is pretty good quality, there&#39;s no fennel noticeable in it.  They bake the pizza perfectly when it&#39;s well done, it has a nice caramelized cheese on top that is amazing.

The salads are lousy, and the slices for sale are nothing like the whole pies.

This is definitely a carryout place.  There&#39;s a picnic table and a few flimsy chairs inside.  I&#39;ve always been happy with the staff (on the phone and in person), so no knocks there.  The thin crust pizza here is the real deal.  Definitely in my top 10 all time favorites."

They forgot the blue cheese sauce and when called about it (within 5 min of delivery) they stated the driver was already 7 miles away and it would be an hour before  they&#39;d be able to deliver any sauce to me. Not really a solution, my food will be cold by then

Funnel cake bites leave much to be desired. They are bland puffs of dough and you can tell the powdered sugar was put on too quick as a lot of it is in hard chunks as it has melted.

Needless to say, huge waste of money ($23+) with delivery and tip. Will not order from here ever again."

Have lived in Naperville for 10 years and have been going here since day 1. The last two times we got it, everything changed. The cheese, sauce, the crust was thicker, literally a completely different pizza. Pretty sure they changed owners so this could be why? They also stopped doing the coupons on the box that you collect to get a discount. One time we even placed our delivery order and then almost 30 minutes later they called to cancel our order saying it was &#34;out of delivery area&#34; even though they delivered to our place countless times in the past!

The slices to-go aren&#39;t nearly as good as the full pizzas you order.  Not only are they sitting out for a little bit, but the dough is overwhelming in my opinion.

We always ordered the same thing, and received exactly what we ordered. That is, until about six weeks ago.

The other half threw out the ol&#39; &#34;I buy, you fly&#34; bit (in this case, I&#39;d make the phone call for delivery). So I proceed to call and place our order: a large, thin crust with pepperoni and black olive, with a coupon to upsize our order for free. (Like I said, our usual).

For starters, the kid on the phone answers &#34;Thanks for calling Taylor Street Pizza HOLD&#34; in one breath before I could say &#34;Okay.&#34; A few minutes later he came back on the line and asked what I wanted. I gave him my order, paid over the phone including a generous tip on my other half&#39;s credit card. I asked him to repeat the order back (considering he seemed unsure when he typed it in the computer), which he did, so I hung up. They usually quote us an hour for delivery but the longest we ever had to wait was 30 minutes. 

About twenty minutes later, our pizza arrived. We open the box to discover a pizza with black olives and pineapple. My other half quickly flagged down the driver and said that there was a mistake; we wanted pepperoni, not pineapple. The driver apologized and took the pizza back.

So, I get on the phone and call TSP back. The kid answers. I proceed to ask him how we received a pizza with incorrect toppings, when I had him verify my order after placing it, and not only that, it even stated &#34;pepperoni&#34; on the receipt. The kid mumbled something about hitting an incorrect button or something along those lines.I then asked what he planned on doing to rectify the situation. He said &#34;I could make a new pizza?&#34; Well, gee- that&#39;d be great. But how about a free 2 liter of pop or something? I don&#39;t know. He said they were making a new pizza and it would be delivered shortly. No apologies for the inconvenience, and no other &#34;peace&#34; offering. Before I could ask for the manager, he hung up.

Sure, I could have just called back and asked for the manager. But at that point, the damage was already done, and I really didn&#39;t care anymore. Our correct pizza arrived, albeit partially burnt, and you could clearly tell it was made in a hurry (cheese and toppings just &#34;thrown on&#34; and then tossed in the oven).

Seeing as we&#39;ve moved, I&#39;m certainly not sad to lose this place as our go-to pizza joint."

Their pizza isn&#39;t bad, but there&#39;s nothing special about it either. I have also had their sandwiches and wings and their chicken wrap, which actually is pretty good. The sandwiches and wings are average at best. As far as their pizza goes, I prefer their double dough over their thin crust and they also sell slices all day.

It started with placing my order. The guy on the other end was very helpful in reading off the pasta dishes they offer (I didn&#39;t have access to the website or a menu at the moment). After I ordered my pizza and pasta, he asked if I had a coupon, which I had a $3 off, so I told him, but he said he actually had a better one for me and used that one. If that wasn&#39;t enough to get me excited, besides their amazing pizza, there&#39;s more. * On my way to pick up the pizza, I realized I forgot to ask for double dough, which is my FA-VO-RITE. I had even ordered an XL so we&#39;d have plenty of left overs. This happened once before and their thin crust was fine, maybe awesome to some, but I just don&#39;t like thin crust, so my mood was not good. When I order from Taylor Street, it&#39;s to go big with a dough-y double dough. Anyway, I was really bummed because my order was $40. I went in to pick it up and didn&#39;t realize I was so obviously bummed, but this awesome guy at the register asked why I was so sad when I was picking up my pizza! Yikes! When I told him I forgot to make my order double dough and was super bummed about it, he told me I was in luck...that he had an XL pizza coming out that they usually put in the little &#39;by the slice&#39; case in the front of the store, and if I wanted, I could trade my pizza for it. What!?!? A W E S O M E service. I had my 4 and 5 year old in the car bc I was planning on just popping in to pick up the pizza (it&#39;s 5 feet away from the car and you can see in and out of the pizza place and it was neither freezing nor scalding outside...). The guy who worked there said he&#39;d bring the pizza out to my car when it was ready. All around, 5 huge, fat stars for Taylor Street, and a massive high five to the awesome guy helping me with great hair and even better side burns. You, my man, are a good one.

Lady at the counter wasn&#39;t in too good of a mood or very helpful. Their slices are too doughy for me... but I got one anyway. She tried to get me to add a two liter. Should have got a salad instead. 

As the picture shows, a $20 pie should be covered in cheese. If you like your pie with as much cheese as a frozen one, than this is your place. I like to have cheese in every bit.

Half hour round trip, so I won&#39;t be going back but it was nice of the owner to offer the raffle prize, so I&#39;ll throw in an extra star."

Finally we were able to get our order in after about 15 minutes of being on hold, being told the computer was down, being asked our address several times, etc.  The price was really expensive but we figured we would roll with it since it took so long to order.  Pizza arrived and was disappointing.  Overall flavor was good -- good cheese and sauce -- but the crust was not good.  It was very crispy.  That being said, we are not native Chicagoans and prefer our pizza East Coast style, so take this review with a grain of salt.  We will not re-order from here and our quest for good delivery pizza continues!"

Their pizza isn&#39;t fancy, but it&#39;s just consistent and down right good pizza. I&#39;ve never ordered a bad pizza from the place. Try the thin crust and you can&#39;t go wrong. 

The sandwiches are also top-notch. I often order the combo with marinara sauce on it. It is one of most delicious things in nature. I could eat that every night as well. I also like the staff as well. Everyone is pretty cool and they really appreciate your business. It&#39;s so great to find a pizza place like this in the area."

I&#39;m a big sauce person so if the sauce isn&#39;t right I&#39;m not happy, and let me tell you, they have GREAT sauce. The thin crust is actually thin. None of this like weird medium crust stuff going on. The ingredients are always amazingly fresh and the pizza is steaming hot when you get it. They always tell you an hour for delivery but it never takes longer than like 20-30 minutes. They have never screwed up our order once. I&#39;m a vegetarian and mu boyfriend is a meat-a-tarian so we do some pretty crazy half meat half veggie concoctions. The price is right too. It&#39;s a really good product for the cost.

I wanted to share a few menu items that AREN&#39;T pizza that I love. The spaghetti is great (again, great sauce), the greek salad is amazing and their veggie wrap is my new favorite wrap(it&#39;s also the size of your head). So if you aren&#39;t in the mood for pizza but still need delivery, rest assured that you can get other great food from them as well.

Got a quick slice to go with sausage for $3.25, while its $5 for 2 slices before 1.  Very good thin crust and its not too thin, which I like and the dough seems to be the focus of the pizza.  The bottom exterior is crispy while the interior is soft, doughy, and a tad bit thick topped with big-sized sausage toppings.  The crust ends were kinda lacking in flavor but didn&#39;t ruin the overall greatness of the pizza.  I can imagine this place doing a lot of business being near all those condos and townhouses."

I always order one of two things: either the fried green tomato sandwich (with sweet potato fries because I LOVE the dipping sauce that comes with it) or the cedar plank salmon.  Sooooooooo good.  They are very different items, so I decide which one to get based on my mood.  

They also have really good drinks.  I usually get wine (I love their white wine glasses, but the sparkling wine glass, not so much.  It was too bulbous and I had a hard time drinking it without spilling on myself), but I&#39;ve had a few of their special concoctions, which were super.  

I always make a reservation since they&#39;re usually packed when I decide to go.  It&#39;s also not outrageously expensive, which is good for me.  The fried green tomato sandwich is only like $12 or something like that and I&#39;m never able to finish the whole thing.    

My mom was visiting a couple of months ago and she doesn&#39;t like ANYTHING, but she really liked Nickson&#39;s.  Of course this was my go-to place to take her and it did not disappoint.  This is a woman who was completely unfazed by the wonder of Greek Islands (my other favorite restaurant), so that says something about her.  

Anyway, so good.  You should go.  And go again."

I had the shrimp po-boy and he had a simple burger. I so wanted to like the place. The shrimp sandwich: ehh. Boring, lack of flavor in the shrimp coating and the remoulade was tasteless. No heat, no tang, nada. Tasteless. (I am used to a more flavorful sandwich such as what you get at Heaven on Seven so this issue may have been just a matter of my taste preference). 

My bigger complaint was with their $12 burger. The burger was good, (but for $12, it should be), but we were charged $1 for a slice of raw onion? WTF? Sadly for me, a misstep of charging us for a slice of onion on an expensive burger weighs more heavily in our experience than the quality of the food and the ambiance. This is an owner taking advantage. Onion, pickle, and tomato are components of a burger, to charge for any of them is ridiculous. (Plus, the tomato for the burger was diced. Maybe a diced tomato for a hot dog, but for a burger? No)."

My guy and I are in money saving mode so going out has been less of an option, but last night I wanted to do something special and we went to Nicksons. 

The restaurant was about 2/3 full the whole time we were there. We walked in ravenous, ordered a flat bread and two entrees. We ordered at 648.... And our flatbread app didn&#39;t arrive until a half hour later! Ravenous+ long day of work+ being yelled at at work + have hour wait time for food left me dangerously close to tears. I don&#39;t know why food had to take that long when the restaurant wasn&#39;t full?! It was really
Upsetting for this hangry girl. 

That being said, our flatbread app and salad/ burger were delicious once it finally arrived.... Just slightly harder to enjoy because of our long wait. Our waitress was nice as well.

I don&#39;t think I have had a bad salad here and I have had almost all of them.  Granted, their prices are a bit high, but when you consider the quality ingredients and combinations, you realize that you&#39;re getting what you pay for.  It&#39;s not often I want to end up spending $20 for a salad (after tax and tip), but I am never hesitant to do it at Nicksons (my other expensive salad spot is 9 Muses in Chicago in case you&#39;re wondering).  The prices are for entree portions, but half portions are available if you ask.

I&#39;ve had:
1. Market Tomato &amp; Farro: Fresh mozzarella, arugula, basil vinaigrette, cucumber, grilled green beans

2. Nicksons Salad: Avocado, basil chicken, tortilla, bacon (which I omitted), white cheddar, scallions, tomato, corn, lemon herb vinaigrette

3. Southern Bell: Dried cranberry, house ranch, pecan, blue cheese crumbles, crispy chicken

I love them all and usually have a hard time narrowing down which one I want!

However, if the rare occasion strikes and I deviate from my salad (what can I say? I am a creature of habit!), then I have tried:

1. Colorado Elk Burger: Peppercorn crusted, white cheddar, duck fat fried egg, garlic herb mayonnaise, lettuce &amp; tomato, chili dusted fries.   This burger would do the state of Colorado proud!  It&#39;s decadent, but the elk isn&#39;t as heavy as the traditional ground beef burger.  The extraordinary ingredients elevate this burger to a new level and it shouldn&#39;t be missed!

2. Maine Shrimp Roll: Poached &amp; chilled shrimp tossed with celery, scallion &amp; lemon sauce, new england roll. Great alternative to the traditional lobster roll.  This sandwich is a great option for a light lunch with its clean flavors.

I have my eye on a couple of other options that I will be surely trying in the future.  Nicksons delivers a high quality, creative and well executed menu that would be fitting competition for some of the best casual dining options in the area and city.  If you&#39;re in the area, and looking for an extraordinary meal, you&#39;ll certainly find it at Nicksons."

My friend and I, both vegetarians, decided to order two entrees and split them. We shared the grilled cheese, quesadilla, sweet potato fries, and regular fries. All of the food was fantastic! 

Over the past year, I have remembered my initial Nicksons visit very fondly, always telling myself, &#34;I&#39;ve got to go back and try more of the menu!&#34; I even convinced my sister to give it a try when she was looking for a great local place for dinner. I finally visited Nicksons again last week to celebrate an interview (hey, I&#39;m always looking for an excuse to go out to eat!), and I was definitely impressed once again. Our waitress was very helpful when I was indecisive about which cocktail to order; she gave great descriptions and made recommendations based on what I was in the mood for. I decided on the cali-coaster ($11), which was very fresh-tasting and adorned with a crisp cucumber. 

I decided to pay an extra $2 for the sweet potato fries as my side with the fried green tomatoes sandwich. I absolutely LOVED my sandwich, which came on toasted wheat bread, a big layer of cheese and spinach, and bountiful fried green tomatoes. Even though I was absolutely famished before the meal, I ended up only being able to finish half because it was just that filling. I will continue to recommend Nicksons as one of my favorite places to eat in downtown La Grange and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back to try more items on the menu!"

Saw this on check please thats why i came. The service is good really nice really attentive. The ambiance just looks like a wooden sports bar kinda. I wouldnt come again. La grange is a really pretty town though.
Regarding food:

Elk burger: i asked medium rare it was a lil bit more pink then i would like. The actual taste of the burger was kind of bland it needed alot of salt and seasoning on it.  The egg on top was cooked perfectly not overcooked not undercooked. The seasoning on egg was strange idk what it was lol. The sauce on the burger made the bun really slippery so it was really messy. wasnt that big of a burger either. It was a pretty plain burger nothing special.

Fries: omg best part of the meal. They were really crunchy. Then really soft and moist inside. They were seasoned really good some were a lil to salty

Mac an cheese: really plain and simple nothing special really creamy thats it didnt taste amaizing no wow factor.

Brisket grilled cheese: i didnt like this my date ordered this i took one bite then that was it. When i think of a grilled chesse i think supper buttery and toasted this was mode toastsd almost to the point of being burned the filling is nothing special"

We ordered the Artisan Cheese Board and Sticky Buns as appetizers.  We were in heaven!  Their sticky buns are absolutely amazing!  The cheese board was good too, but those sticky buns are a food you have dreams about. I thought if our meal is half as good as the sticky buns, we struck gold.  I was not to be disappointed.  The ladies each had a different salad that were of good size.  I had the Carolina Shrimp &amp; Grits &amp; my buddy had the Texan Brisket Tacos.  All 4 of us were so pleased.  Their drink specials were quite tasty as well and I had to have two Republic Old Fashioneds just to confirm goodness.  And it&#39;s served with an oversized, clear ice cube - nice touch.  Finally, since we were stuffed, there was little room for dessert. So, we split a seasonal &#34;skillet&#34; of apple &#34;streusel-like&#34; on ice cream and it was big enough that all 4 of us had a least 2 heaping spoonfuls.  Fantastic!  This place had a nice, unique charm about it.  It&#39;s not quiet, so do expect to hear people laughing, talking and enjoying their meals.

I was with 3 others and each of us got something different from the menu. I ordered the Casa Club and this was hands down the best chicken avocado sandwich I&#39;ve ever had. I also ordered the smokey mac n cheese which was phenomenal however I tried the Poblano and Parm fries as well and they were excellent as well.

Service is good and on a busy Saturday service did not take a dive, something I appreciate. I ordered the shrimp po boy. Flavors and freshness in the po boy was dead on.

I literally only had 7 medium shrimp on my po boy. I can honestly say the bread and sauce was good. My husband did enjoy his beef brisket grilled cheese and mac &amp; cheese. Our waitress was so busy doing nothing and when she did come to the table to ask how we enjoyed everything. I replied mine was ok and she moved on to another table without a concern.

I must say I like the scenery and vibe was nice and inviting. I had the Grilled brisket, which was okay, nothing really to scream about. The bread was great,but the brisket could have been seasoned better. The fries were better. My wife did like the grilled fried tomato sandwich, which she said she liked. She also the smoky mac and cheese, who she liked much better than Calzone. I will not go back again."

The staff is casually dressed and the music is good. It gave a very lax vibe and that&#39;s why we decided to eat there for the day. Our waitress Angelina was very friendly and attentive despite there being an obvious rush. The mussels in almond butter sauce were delicious and my CDK burger was absolutely amazing. I&#39;m still thinking about that burger lol! However when we arrived the place was packed and we got our food as the place was literally almost empty. It was a fifty minute wait for some tacos and a burger! YIKES! It didn&#39;t help that we were very hungry. As I said my burger was delicious, however my sisters and brother in laws tacos were cold as soon as they got them. They were too afraid to complain for fear it would take too long to correct the issue and just ate them. We will probably give this place another try despite the unpleasant experience and the waitress did comp one of our dinners to apologize for the long wait. It is always nice when the staff acknowledges something like this instead of acting like it didn&#39;t happen."

We were able to get seated without a problem at about 5, but saw that by the time we left around 6.30 that there was a group waiting for tables.  The restaurant was pretty full while we were there, and it was a great night for people going to the zoo to look at the lights.  

Overall the food was good.  Our server was nice, though not terribly attentive.  We all had an alcoholic drink, none were too strong.  I had the Pineapple Express and found that it tasted more like tequila and not at all like pineapple. Not a bad thing, but good to know if someone wants something really fruity.  

Our food was all delivered promptly and had great presentation. We had the poutine and the fried green tomatoes to start, which were both very good.  

For our meal, two of us had salads and both thought they were great, except that there may have been too much dressing (didn&#39;t think to ask for dressing in the side - our fault).  All of the ingredients were fresh and looked gorgeous. Two of us ordered two entrees to split and they split them before they served them so it was nice that we didn&#39;t have to worry about that at the table.  We also ordered sides of the mac and cheese, which was AMAZING. 

The only bummer is that the restaurant is offering a holiday deal, where for every $50 you spend in gift cards, you get $10 to use between January and April.  Since our bill was over $100, I asked if could purchase a few gift cards and use them to cover the bill, figuring I could use the remainder of the gift cards with the bonus cards I would get for our next visit.  Our waitress said that they were not allowed to use gift cards the same day they were purchased, so I couldn&#39;t do that. Not the end of the world, but being able to do that would have guaranteed another trip out to LaGrange to go to Nickson&#39;s.  If I were in the area, or meeting some friends, I would go back, but don&#39;t know that I&#39;d make a trip out there in a whim to go to the restaurant. 

Overall, though, a nice evening."

As the months and years drifted by, we never really batted an eye at Nicksons again until restaurants started to close due to the loss of the tif district LaGrange had placed to encourage local businesses to form. So, for lunch, my parents and I decided to go to Nicksons, and maybe it was nostalgia that impacted the difference in quality of the food, but the meal was very lackluster and bland.

We came at around noon, the restaurant empty besides for three lone tables. This was a red flag already, as the people eating there seemed to be frequenters. Needless to say, we didn&#39;t have to wait at all for our table right in the middle of the restaurant. Our waitress was right with us, most likely because she had nothing else to do. Because of the lack of customers though, it felt like we were being watched and tried to be hurried up by the staff. Specifically, one lady who wasn&#39;t our waitress asked about every five minutes if we wanted something cleared off our table, which didn&#39;t really set the tone off for the rest of our meal.

Both my mom and I ordered the Maine Shrimp Roll, which (as previously stated), was my favorite item on the menu by far. The wait for food only took about ten minutes, which was nice. But, as soon as I took my first bite, the pretzel roll reeked of a grilled cheese after taste, queuing me into the fact that some level of cross-contamination had occurred. My mom did not experience the conflict between the two flavors, but instead found pieces and bits of the shrimps&#39; tails thrown askew into the meal. Not appealing whatsoever. My dad ordered some huge meal, but he said it was pretty lackluster.

Overall, the quality of Nicksons has gone down hill since we&#39;ve last been. Maybe we&#39;ll be back again, but with restaurants like Q-BBQ and Hillgrove Tap in less than a fifteen minute drive from here, Nicksons faded out as the local hotspot."

Service was just fine; friendly and attentive, but not overbearing.  The soup was a veggie chowder - delish.  I had the famous brisket and cheddar sandwich and it is as good as advertised.  My wife had the brisket tacos and she thoroughly enjoyed them.  Both dishes came with fresh cut fries...very good. We will be back."

I had dinner tonight with my mom. We started with the arugula flatbread, which was good but overpriced for what you get. 

We shared the aged beef tenderloin steak tails with mac &amp; cheese. The beef was a nice, tender cut -- LOADED with sodium! Way too salty. The mac &amp; cheese is nothing to write home about.

The restaurant, itself, is warm and welcoming. Our server was very sweet and attentive. I&#39;m just not impressed with the food."

Their craft beer selection and cocktail menus are always in rotation and delicious. Fried green tomatoes is one of our favorite appetizers. As a New England seafood snob I can confidently say they do seafood justice. My favorites have been the fish tacos (rotating fish selection) or the crab salad during lunch (please bring this back to the menu!!!).

There is one very small piece of fish in each tortilla. Smaller than a fish stick. Ok. I ask the waitress is this portion right.  She says yes. Ok!

The pork belly and grits were super good, although I&#39;m not the biggest fan of pork belly. It had tons of different flavors that complemented each other well. The truffle oil/parm fries are amazing. We ordered the Foodie&#39;s Seasonal Salad and the waiter was awesome and had them separate it onto two plates--he was just so accommodating!

There were only six tables and our waiter was hiding in the back watching TV.  I thought I saw the manager walked pass and had eye contact with him but he kept walking and ignored us.  The bus boy brought us extra ketchup (1 small portion) and he was probably saved the restaurant from falling apart.  I didn&#39;t know ketchup is at a premium these days.

Heard about it through Yelp and it was near the hotel my co-workers were staying at.  Convenience is key during the work week.

When we arrived the hostess was very friendly and chatted with us until the rest of our party of 6 arrived.  The hostess made one suggestion the casa club.  I don&#39;t think anyone in our party actually ordered the club but I always appreciate suggestions from the employees.  

The server was good, not great and not bad; just good.  The drinks took a little while to arrive only two beers (both in cans) so a little surprised by that.  The pace of the meal wasn&#39;t too bad seemed to flow nicely.  

Although I&#39;ve been stuck in the Midwest for a while now I am still a southerner at heart (Charleston, SC).  So when I see shrimp and grits I can&#39;t resist.  Everything in the meal (sausage, shrimp, bacon) was great.  The grits however, well they just weren&#39;t up to par.  

The food is on the expensive side for what you get here.  I always try to adjust my expectations based on pricing.  With that overall I do not think the food is worth the price.

I ordered the Crab Cakes and the Texas Brisket Tacos. Both were delicious. To pick my favorite, it would be too hard. The crab cakes were not fishy; actually, I just got back from Cape Cod not too long ago and I enjoyed these more than the ones I had looking over the Atlantic.

The Brisket Tacos is definitely a must. If you are unsure what to choose from the menu, you can&#39;t go wrong here.

Great portions and really a welcoming atmosphere.

A diamond in a sea of many places to eat."

Yes, we went the day after this restaurant was on &#34;Check, Please!&#34; And you know what? Kudos - they had a big rush of people (even at 3 p.m.) and they handled it well. 

The food was really solid. We had the brisket grilled cheese and the crab cake sandwich and then split both between us, and they were both great. But note they are reasonable sized sandwiches - neither is a huge plate filler so make sure you order some sides. They had a cobbler desert that was sooooo good! 

Service was friendly -- they were a little slow in following up, but I&#39;ll chalk that up to their busy day. 

I used to live in Madison (WI) and this has a very &#34;Wisconsin&#34; sort of vibe to it -- somewhat upscale, but in a very farmhouse, homey atmosphere, with servers wearing flannel shirts, etc. Definitely will go back.

EDITED 1/12 TO ADD: Sorry, I had to come back and remove a star from what HAD been a 4 star review. They managed to charge our card for two transactions - one that was ours and one that was not. It looks like from other comments that this is a recurring issue for this place, and they really need to get it under control."

Very nice staff, owner is personable and welcoming.  We started with the crab cakes, which were very good.  I had the grilled cheese with brisket not too salty, not too cheesy a very good cheese to brisket ratio.  I would not normally order a grilled cheese but the brisket sold me.  Very good french fries.  My sidekick had the schrimp po boy.  The beer selection was great.  Can&#39;t wait to come back and it&#39;s so close to home, an added bonus."

Sadly, I&#39;ve not been impressed both of the times I&#39;ve been here. We came here first time on St. Patrick&#39;s Day 2012 when it was in the 70s rather than the normal 25-30 something degrees. It was nice. We got to eat outside. They have a lovely little patio setup outside. The drinks we had were good, not watered down and didn&#39;t use cheap alcohol. 

It&#39;s just that the food didn&#39;t impress me. Higher than anticipated prices kind of turned me off, but everything seemed overwhelmingly greasy. We ordered the fried green tomato appetizer, my wife&#39;s favorite. All I could really taste was the grease in the batter. Same thing for the server-recommended duck fat fries. They tasted like any other fries to me. My sandwich was ok, but nothing spectacular. 

Overall, I think this place is lackluster and I probably won&#39;t be back."

Yes, they made &#34;Check, Please&#34; - good for them, since they offer slightly upscale comfort food rather than trendy artisan tiny plates.  Yes, they are kid friendly - go later if that bugs you.  Frankly I think they do a great job with families, which means the kids learn how to behave in a restaurant.  

This time we shared the Foodie Salad - delicious and a fresh way to start.  My wife had the Shrimp and Grits, a dish which seems to pop up in many reviews.  She was very pleased, and the small bite she shared was quite savory.  I had the Fennel-crusted Pork and Gemelli.  This pasta dish was generous with the pork, came in  one of the little cast iron dishes which kept it piping hot, and was loaded with flavor. We shared a side of beets with smooth blue cheese crumbles.  Always check Nickson&#39;s sides for such gems.  

Half price wine night seems to have disappeared as the IPAs and craft cocktails are the current trend.  The food remains solid, our server Sam (we&#39;ve had her wait on us twice now) was friendly and efficient, and my rating remains a solid four stars."

I have disputed with the credit card company -- but who knows if I will ever be reimbursed. I also tried calling to speak with the manager and was told by the girl who answered the phone that she&#39;d give him my message and take my number down and tell him to call me but he was busy and it&#39;d be awhile if I tried to hold. Great customer service, clearly this isn&#39;t something they value as a problem to deal with immediately. I&#39;d skip this place -- unless you don&#39;t mind being charged for God knows who else&#39;s meals in the restaurant...


EDIT: In the end I was refunded the additional charge to my account, I wouldn&#39;t exactly call it a &#39;timely fashion&#39; -- it was only timely because I took things into my own hands to be resolved but I would like to state that ONLY after I called AND emailed the restaurant did this happen -- I received a phone call back regarding the email I had sent, never from the manager on duty the day I initially called about the issue. I believe if I hadn&#39;t have followed up with the email I never would have heard anything back."

I think it&#39;s gone down hill a bit.  The crispy pig sandwich remains excellent but everything else we tried was disappointing.  The poutine fries sounded really good on the menu but there was so much gravy that the fries got lost in the slime.  The shrimp and grits suffered from an overdose of pepper - someone in the kitchen needs to check on that.  For dessert, we tried the warm chocolate cookie with vanilla ice cream, something we&#39;ve had before and enjoyed, but this time the cookie was rock hard and just not good."

The restaurant itself was hot..I&#39;m not sure if the ac was working , it made it uncomfortable to eat.

Food...mac and cheese was ok
Beef Brisket Grilled Cheese was pretty good..bread was a but burnt. 
They have Three Floyd&#39;s on Draft...Bonus!
Sticky Buns were good and dessert as well...had the apple pie ala mode..

I was surprised to read that the place would be closing in an hour - 10pm on a Friday? - but after looking at the menu, I realized they were likely doing this to try to set themself as a &#34;restaurant&#34; versus a &#34;bar&#34;. 

Service: Horrible. We waited at least five minutes before a server came by, and this was a sign for the remainder of the hour we were there. We had our bill 15 minutes before finally grabbing another server just to pay our check!

Food/Drink: We tried the Fall Sangria, which was an apple/pear/cinnamon and DELICIOUS. The food menu looked incredible, and based on the drink alone, I&#39;ll definitely return and review our food. We only had the sangria and then left since they were closing, but even despite the service, I&#39;m excited to try the food in the near future!

Decor: I don&#39;t normally comment on this, but the decor was awesome! Very shabby-chic and pinterest-y. Super cute."

Pig and fig and crab cake apps. Pig And fig tasted  more like pork with fat and fig. Tasty, but more like pork than bacon. Crab cakes were of Trader Joes variety. Just OK. 
 Went during &#34;Lobster Fest&#34; so tried lobster roll for entree. Lobster was like tuna on cold toasted bun. Lobster was plentyfull but again just OK. Nothing special for $21. Nicksons offers average food at above average prices. Lotta kids lotta noise."

We came on a Friday night and the place was about 2/3 full and we still had to wait for a table (?). The hostesses were walking back and forth to the back and front so I&#39;m not sure what the deal was. We finally get seated and order 2 beers only to find they are both out. So we order our food and wait and wait and wait.....

45+ minutes after we order our food, we have to tell the server to just box up the food so we can bring it home. Our little guy was getting fussy and so were we. It was ridiculous to wait that long. The server was apologetic but offered no compensation in return or offer to talk to a manager. It wasn&#39;t her fault but $75 later, we left with our food in tow - hungry, upset and disappointed."

Nickson&#39;s is a small restaurant in downtown LaGrange that I never would have noticed if I didn&#39;t look at the nearby restaurants on my Yelp App.  The waiters were in plaid shirts and jeans.  We had just gotten off a plane from Kansas City so we fit right in in our cowboy boots and plaid.

They had a bunch of BBQ items on the menu.  They also have a variety of craft and local beers which was cool.  I ordered an Angry Orchard since I am not a beer drinker and my boyfriend ordered a Boulevard (Missouri brewed) which is apparently difficult to find in the suburbs.

For an appetizer, we had the fried green tomatoes with a romoulade sauce.. fantastic... delicious.. melts in your mouth good.

For my meal, I ordered the brisket grilled cheese with truffle fries.  The fries were awesome...the brisket grilled cheese was dry and lacking in taste.  My boyfriend had a flat bread which was  good, but small.  We also had an order of the crab and bacon mac and cheese which we both enjoyed.  I was really disappointed in my grilled cheese because so many people talked it up.

The service was pretty good but it took a while to get the check at the end.  I would return, but I would not order the brisket grilled cheese again."

Tried Nicksons for lunch and was very satisfied. Nice creative menu with something for all of us including a strong showing of gluten free choices. My wife loved the tortilla soup and a chicken sandwich. I had the brisket tacos (gf) which were fabulous.  We also had the brisket grilled cheese that did not disappoint.  The service was good and friendly. Upon seating us, she relocated us away from a large group of little ones. 

Beware, I grabbed the first parking spot in front of the restaurant. Got nailed for a $30 ticket for parking in a 15 min zone.  My fault but that hurt."

The waitress was really nice and let us garage a couple beers before ordering which was nice. She recommended the shrimp po boy and the brisket grilled cheese, which we took her up on. My husband had the po boy and said it was good. The shrimp were fried and the bread looked good. He had the tomato bisque as a side which was tasty. I had the grilled cheese and was disappointed. The brisket wasn&#39;t very flavorful- just a little meaty taste but with my eyes closed I could have missed it was there. The nice touch was the crispy cheesey edges which were the best part of the sandwich. The fries were lame- little flavor, little seasoning and lots of small nubs of potato with few longer fries.

Pros: Friendly service. Food served quickly. Nice atmosphere. Elk burger and lobster roll both solid.

Cons(and its a big con to me): I was unable to get my southern smash because they were out of key ingredients. How are you out of the basics like mint on a Saturday???? especially when it is one of your signature drinks.  I came here specifically for that drink and was unable to get it.

I&#39;ve been to this place three times now since I moved out here a year ago. I&#39;ve tried all the other restaurants downtown LaGrange has to offer and Nicksons, by far, has the best food. Most recently, I had the tenderloin steak tails. This is a meal that would usually cost you $40+ if it was served at a well-known higher class restaurant. Very tender. Very flavorful. That being said, the best dish I&#39;ve had from there was an off-the-menu special. Unfortunately, last night for a business meeting only one person got to try the braised pork special because they ran out. He did say it was delicious.

The burgers were delicious and huge! The mac and cheese was great, but I didn&#39;t taste much smoky flavor.

we ordered the wings and bacon/onion flatbread for apps.   the wings were so good that we ordered another plate, our friend literally would have bathed in the sauce, they were, like, the best wings ever.  i really enjoyed the flatbread too: crispy, light, rich, intense, all at the same time.  delicious.  we got the nickson&#39;s burger, shrimp po boy, fried green tomato sandwich and the tacos.  everything was really good, you can tell they put everything into every dish on the menu.  my po boy was amazing, the sauce, the toasted bun, the veggie rice i ordered was yummy, the shrimp was seasoned perfectly and just crispy enough.  the boys ordered the bananas foster dessert and wiped the plate clean.   a nice night out, great food, nice people."

Not only is the customer service of this place spot-on, but it is family-owned on top of it!  You will find the sisters mulling around the tables and keeping you happy with drinks and a constantly full water glass... along with one of the brother&#39;s; I think he might be the floor manager?  The other brother is the chef. There is definitely something to be said about a family that owns and runs a business together.  It is a bond that you just don&#39;t see around all that much these days and it is a breath of fresh air in my opinion. :)

I have friends in the western suburbs, and every time I&#39;m out near La Grange, IL, we try to make it a point to stop by and have a few fun cocktails and grab some food at Nickson&#39;s.  The flatbreads are quite delicious and I&#39;d have to say that a few of my favorite menu items have to be the &#34;braised short rib&#34; and the &#34;carolina shrimp &amp; grits.&#34;

This place has delicious comfort food with a loving twist of family and neighborhood charm.  I look forward to the seasonal menu updates at this place... I don&#39;t get out there often, and when I do, it&#39;s a real treat!! Yumm! :)"

I had heard it was a good place from many people, so I had big expectations and they were met. My first impression was how inviting the place was inside, a nice fireplace, cool lights. The waiters I&#39;ve had, have been so nice and one even gave me some more bread for free to dip into the muscle sauce. Speaking of their muscles, they are delicious. Very nicely cooked and the sauce is buttery and delicious. The place&#39;s food in general is delicious so I think you should go ahead and check it out."

The restaurant itself and the decor is beautiful and the hostess and our waitress were great and very friendly!

I was a little shocked about the prices...I thought it was going to be a little more like &#34;Olive Garden&#34; prices.  Spaghetti and meatballs were close to $17, which was surprising (I think Maggiano&#39;s is even cheaper than that).

I ordered the Shrimp &amp; Scallop Linguine Alla Vodka and my fiancé ordered the Linguine Positano (grilled chicken, crushed tomatoes, garlic, olive oil and basil).  We both tried each other&#39;s and we agreed that my dinner was the better of the two.

I was also surprised about the portions...Again, I am used to Olive Garden or Maggiano&#39;s where 9/10 times, we have a to go box.  Now, I&#39;m not complaining about that because their portions were just the right size, but again, for the price, I guess I thought we would be getting a little more?

I sadly did not, and was still hungry. I asked for a container, since my plate was cold. The manager did give us 2 complimentary desserts, for the inconvenience.  Which we also took home.

This is a hard one to rate because it&#39;s been a couple of years since we been here so I&#39;ll rate based on most recent visit.

Food - 5 Stars
Service - 5 Stars
Menu - 2 Stars

We came here for my son&#39;s birthday and one of his favorites were the Cheese Stuffed Manicottis. No longer on the menu.  Neither were the Sirloin Medallions.  Kind of a bummer, quite a few changes on the menu.  They no longer leave the olive oil on the table and the bread dropped to 3 slices as used to be a mini loaf.

I had the Veal Marsala, my son had the Fettuccine Carrabba and my wife had the Salmon. All was very good but my my son really wanted the Manicottis.

We will be back, always had a good meal here we just need to adjust our cravings next time."

I wasn&#39;t impressed by the food at all.  It was okay but if you&#39;re looking for a true authentic italian meal, don&#39;t go here.  
I was hoping to find more veggie options on their menu and also hoping they had eggplant parmesan. They have a very minimal vegetable option.  My husband and I ordered the Italian lettuce wraps. Again, it wasn&#39;t impressive. Shredded chicken on top of neatly sliced lettuce.  We ordered the lobster ravioli and shrimp and scallop linguine.  They were both ok - lobster ravioli had more cheese than lobster meat. And my shrimp and scallop linguine was more linguine than seafood...Booo.  
The only thing that was nice was the service. Our waiter was very attentive and always made sure our drinks were filled.  He checked on us often and not in that annoying way.  Good service.
One more gripe: sat in the booths but the seats suck.  My feet didn&#39;t even reach the floor.  Oh well, can&#39;t do anything about it but hey, this is coming from a short Asian chick #bornpintsized"

It&#39;s only when I see their commercials that I remember wanting to venture out and trying one.

Because of the outrageous gas prices and having a comparable restaurant in my area, it took a while to come up with more than just wanting to eat at this specific place for driving down here.

We originally made plans to see John Wick at the AMC Barrington 30 and dine at the Macaroni Grill tonight. Well, something suddenly came up... plans changed... here we are!

I hurriedly walked in from the cold and inadvertently photo bombed a nice couple having their picture taken in the foyer, shared an awkward laugh with them before being greeted by a friendly host who took my name and handed me a pager.

While I waited in the nook, I looked around the room. I decided one of the booths closer to the bar would be ideal for us. This side of the restaurant is smaller, quieter, less occupied and has the kind of ambiance we&#39;re accustomed to.  

The pager went off just as my boyfriend arrived by my side. Without even asking, the hostess led us to the exact spot I aforementioned.

The service was delightful. Our server had a sense of humor. I give her and the staff 4 stars for being courteous, prompt and efficient. 

The pasta dishes turned out to be close to what I expected. We ordered the Shrimp and Scallop Linguine with house salad and the Lobster Mac&#39;n&#39;Cheese with ceaser salad. 

They didn&#39;t disappoint. They were average and familiar. There&#39;s nothing spectacular about them for me to rate higher than 3 stars.

I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;m in any hurry to return for one of their pasta dishes because I actually think Noodles &amp; Co and Romano&#39;s Macaroni Grill are better. I do like this place so I will return. I want to try an anti-pasta plate next time with their soup of the day and maybe share one of their desserts."

Went with the hubs for an early Birthday dinner and wanted to try something a little different for a change. I wish I would have taken pictures but unfortunately I forgot my phone at home. 

We ordered the calamari appetizer. Those were very tasty, fresh and not fishy tasting. We also ordered the Mussels in white Wine Lemon Butter, was so delicious!! The wonderful appetizers had me a little worried for the main course, you know its like the build up before the let down...lol.

Well I had the Chicken Marsala and my husband had the 9oz Sirloin Marsala and we both had the garlic mash potatoes for the sides. WOMP WOMP as expected....

Chicken Marsala - the chicken was moist and pretty delicious, the potatoes were less than amazing. I didn&#39;t taste the garlic flavor and the texture was of the boxed instant ones. They chicken was smothered in the sauce, which I didn&#39;t mind too much because it was added flavor for my mash potatoes

Steak Marsala - definitely did not look like the picture on the website. Was moist, didn&#39;t taste too bad, have definitely had better. Potatoes were the same runny flavorless consistency as mine. Husband didn&#39;t like the over kill of Marsala sauce on his steak though and only had a bite of his potatoes, he wasn&#39;t a fan. 

Desert  was the best part- Tiramisu was fresh and pretty damn good!! I had the Panna Cotta, although very small portion, was oh so good, but all the raspberry sauce took away from the deliciousness of the Panna Cotta. 

Over all not a terrible place, a bit pricey for the quality. Would probably go again and just stick with the appetizers and deserts, or maybe try one of the pasta dishes."

I was in town a few weekends ago and had lunch here with my extended family. It seemed that the restaurant was understaffed, and it took quite a while for everyone to order and get our meals. 

There were very few vegetarian items on the menu. The veggie-friendly dishes were all super carb-heavy. I ended up &#34;creating&#34; my own pizza. When I got it, the pizza&#39;s cheese was too thick and solid. It was also way too greasy. I don&#39;t think you could call this pizza.

My dad said his meal was very bland and underseasoned. I believe he, as well as others in our party, ordered the salmon.

The worst offense was that my cousin, who has a gluten allergy, was served croutons in his salad after specifically confirming with our waiter about his dietary restrictions. The waiter did not think much of it, and he barely apologized. 

I&#39;m really not sure how this location is still in business. The food is not great especially for the quality and price. Sadly, I think Chili&#39;s might be a better option."

The bread basket is soft &amp; fresh tasting.  The olive oil &amp; spice is addictive! If I could have brought it home I totally would have. 

The minestrone soup!!! Ahhhh the minestrone soup is hearty &amp; delicious.  It tastes homemade as well. It had cabbage, beans, potatoes, carrots. It was thicker consistency than OG which I reallly loved! I wanted moreeeeee!! 

Pasta pic pac. Delicious!  It had the perfect amount of garlic for this garlic lover. I really enjoyed the sauce not being heavy. It was just crushed tomato, garlic and basil. Really simple &amp; delicious. 

My aunt got the wood fired chicken. She said it tasty. It was not dried out like some grilled chicken can be. It was moist &amp; flavorful.  The only complaint she had was that she wishes they took the time to clean the stems off the green beans. 

We would both certainly go back!"

My steak was cooked fine, but was covered in a nasty sauce.  I paid $2 for fettucini alfredo instead of mashed potatoes and the portion was tiny.  The pasta was ok, but not worth the calories.  We had a pizza and some sausage and peppers for appetizers and I thought the pizza was tasteless, despite having sausage and basil and tomatoes on it and the sausage and peppers were pretty bland as well.  Maybe I&#39;m being too harsh, but I just didn&#39;t like any of the food, and the portions were too small for the price.  I&#39;m not a fan, but my sisters love this place, so I might give it another try."

I seem to have always just passed by or been too busy to dine in. I decided to make it appoint to have dinner and so happy I did.

My group started off with the fried calamari with marinara sauce and lemon wedges. A great start to my evening dinner. The staff is very polite and knowledgable in every aspect of the menu. Now I am the rookie here amongst my group so I had questions.

We sat close to the kitchen but I did not mind. I actually enjoyed listening to the orders being called out and prepared. Although I could not see anything I just knew there was an army of culinary soldiers on the line.

I ordered the char-broiled Chicken Marsala with garlic mash potatoes. Seriously one of the most juiciest chickens I have ever had. It was topped with a tasty mushroom and gravy blend which hands down made this entree absolutely amazing. What I did not care for was the minestrone soup it came with. It was not lacking anything, it must be the fact I am use to other variations of it. No big deal I will order the salad next time.

Forgot to mention it was New Year&#39;s Day and they had a nice crowd. We were seated rather quickly without a fuss."

A couple of favorites to mention is the bread.....baked fresh.  The clam appetizer is also very good.  The Sicilian chicken soup is awesome.  (I love Chicken soups this time of year.  If you know great places let me know)

Entrees are better than Olive Garden that&#39;s for sure.  Ambiance and service usually very good.   Would recommend for a casual meal.

I tend to get the same thing every time because there&#39;s a steak place next door but don&#39;t bother with them. Carrabbas filet mignon is the best! It&#39;s made perfectly to order and so tender and juicy! I don&#39;t know what their secret is but the flavor is incredible! I also love their Alfredo pasta. It is perfect and so delicious. They also have the most amazing house salad dressing. I highly recommend you try it because you will love it. You get fresh bread at your table and it is delicious and you get as much as you want. Also the service is impeccable. They truly take care of their guests and good service is very important. This is one of my top 5 favorite restaurants.

The pasta is al dente. The sauces to choose from are vast and the marinara is my favorite. Come here, support this place!

I went there on Valentines Day with my boyfriend and two of our friends.  They had no complaints about their Chicken Parmesan.  However, the Sirloin and Shrimp combination was not that good.  The steak was extremely tough and had fat and grizzle all the way through.  They forgot to put the spicy butter on it and brought it out on the side and I&#39;m actually glad they did.  It was disgusting and would&#39;ve ruined my whole meal if left on.  The prosciutto wrapped shrimp was good.  I just wish there would&#39;ve been more than just 4 shrimp on my skewer.  Needless to say, I&#39;ll be sticking with pasta the next time I go here and they should really look into a better supplier for their steaks, especially since they charge $20 and more for them."

It seems the management must be doing something wonderful as I have yet to get even &#39;ok&#39; service here. 

The food quality is always consistent.  Deserts are amazing.  I also enjoy their cappuccionos here as well.

I&#39;m quite surprised places like the Olive Garden can survice with a chain like Carrabba&#39;s around.  While there&#39;s no unlimited soup and salad... there&#39;s no need for that gimic here -  the fresh bread with seasoned oil and wonderful service will be all you need."

What I received was extremely deceiving as picture that was shown on the menu.  Got 1 piece of chicken &amp; 2 pieces of pork.  All 3 pieces were the size of a sugar packet, which made my normal-sized side of garlic mashed potatoes look gigantic!

 s-l-o-w, and the server was snotty.   (When asked about the chianti, her reply was, &#34;Read the back of the menu.&#34;  Given the markup on liquor and the fact there were only two, she certainly should have been able to provide feedback.)   The olive oil served with the bread was off-tasting.  We asked for butter instead, and that was straight-out-of-the-refrigerator hard.   Unacceptable.   The minestrone was pretty tasteless, the flatbread was cold--again refrigerator cold, and the baked ravioli two of my party had was not baked, but deep fried, rock hard, and passed under a heater (server&#39;s words) to melt the cheese.   Yuk.  Now the positives:  the bread was good, the manager did come to address our concerns, and they did offer us dessert for our troubles, which we refused.   Frankly, given the quality of the entrees, I was skeptical of the quality of the desserts.   The prices were not in line with the quality, and we will never be back to any Carrabba&#39;s."

The food style is comparable to Olive Garden, an American Italian Food chain. However, Carrabba&#39;s does a much better job executing its dishes.

It&#39;s a bit pricey so I like to go when they have television advertised three course specials. I&#39;ve also seen $10 off on Coupons.com

I enjoy how the kitchen subtly flows into the dining area. You can catch a glimpse of dishes being prepared while you wait.

You can customize your pasta dish by choosing a sauce and then a pasta from their extensive selection. They cook their chicken to perfection. It is very succulent and a bit not overcooked. The tomatoes are very fresh and delicious as well.

The three course meals are not large in portions size and do leave you wanting more. The service is not consistent: excellent at times and decent on other occasions, just the luck of the draw it seems."

I really want to like this place, I really do.  But they confound me with hit or miss service, frequent order errors and a guaranteed cold item in every order.
We often sat at the pizza bar area so we could see them preparing the meals.  Who in the world plates the hot soup and then goes about putting together the salad (whoops! We&#39;re out of lettuce, I need to go get some, refill the basket make the salad, put the salad on the counter wait for a server to schlep it to the customer, but not right away of course).
So when they offending soup arrives it&#39;s about the same temperature as the salad.  Do I need to point that out to the staff?  Could people like that be trusted to put together other orders without committing the same errors?  No.
There are over 100 Carrabba&#39;s in Florida.  I&#39;ve been to many, some several times and never had the consistent iffy service and consistent cold or incorrectly prepared food item that I&#39;ve had at the Woodridge location."

That said; if the food is good, who cares?

I&#39;ve been to a few locations around the country, but this one sits on my home turf and as such I&#39;ve been eating here since it opened...around 13 years ago. The only time I&#39;ve ever been disappointed was when I found a hair in my pasta in 2003!! But, you know what, the manager handled the whole thing with such professionalism that I decided to come back--and I&#39;m so glad I did! 

This location (at least in my opinion) is always on top its game and never fails to send me home happy. From their insanely good bread (almost as addictive as crack) to their delicious food (*albeit in smaller and smaller  portions in the last decade) to their very respectable Copper Ridge house wines (a restaurant only Gallo product). This is a place that doesn&#39;t feel like a chain restaurant where you can relax and enjoy some comfort food. 

*On a side note, the person who commented on their olive oil being rancid: Carrabas buys their olive oil from La Rambla in Spain, pretty decent brand. Interestingly enough, when the whole bread dipping craze took off, a lot of Americans developed a taste for rancid olive oil. I don&#39;t think Carrabas does this on purpose, but it probably has something to do with the clear glass bottles they use + leaving them sitting for weeks/months without refilling."

My first impression was that the wait staff was very frank.  Almost everytime my waiter came by it was either to take an order, deliver an item ordered or remove a plate.  There was no small talk.

Because they were super busy and had a wait time of 20 mins, I kinda let it slide, but at one point, my boyfriend told the waiter, &#34;It&#39;s her birthday today.  Do you guys do anything special for birthdays?&#34;.  All the waiter said was that they did.  No &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; to me which I thought was a pretty basic reaction.

Luckily my boyfriend&#39;s a good tipper because our waiter did not really earn a good tip.  

Otherwise, the food was good - especially the soup and alfredo pastas. 

Other Food:
- The Caesar Salad was average
-Raspberry Iced Tea was oversweetened
-Calamari was good, but overseasoned with salt (may have been because the place was packed)
-Dessert was delicious...not the typical below par bday dessert most restaurants have.  This was gourmet!  (see picture)

Overall, I love the atmosphere and design of the restaurant.  Food was good for the most part.   Service was unattentive.   Price was awesome - two meals that came with soup or salad plus Calamari appetizer for under $50."

I would have rated the restaurant 4 stars in the past.  That has changed.  The service at Carrabba&#39;s has generally been good and over the past years, most meals have been very good to great.   I rarely order a pizza here since there are so many other selections to choose from, but I had a taste for pizza.  

The last pizza I had many, many, many years ago was great.  It would have been a &#34;create your own&#34; with sausage, pepperoni and mushrooms (my standard toppings.)  

The pizza I had last night wasn&#39;t great, not even good.  I again created my own with my standard toppings plus meatballs.  The pizza I got was thin with a very soft crust, wet top.  It was nearly impossible to hold this pizza (limper than a limp noodle) and it was impossible to cut (cheese &amp; and toppings separated from crust.)  The waitress came by to check on things mid-meal and I told her about the pizza.  She apologized and offered to  take it back and put it on the fire to get a crust that is crispy.  Too late ... I&#39;m nearly done eating the pizza.  Besides,  I really should&#39; not get a soggy, soft pizza in the first place.  Also,  the amount of toppings seemed skimpy, but was probably appropriate for the super-thin crust.  On the other hand the pizza did taste good.

I will not be ordering a pizza from Carrabba&#39;s again.  I will come back for the other food.

My wife ordered the Sirloin Marsala and Crab Cake.  The crab cake was a bit small, but she said the meal was quite good.  It looked good too.  

The bread and olive oil ... very good.
The service ... good
The prices ... reasonable.
The atmosphere ... pleasant.

Yes, we will eat here again."

Portions at lunch were skimpy, Left hungry and wondering where to go for a hot dog. Had Chicken Parm, which consisted of a 3&#34; x 4&#34; dry piece of white meat, slathered with a thin red sauce and some cheese. It belonged at McDonald&#39;s or Burger King on a bun. The side of broccoli was two 2&#34; pieces that were overcooked and not worth putting on the plate. With a diet soda and tip this mess came to over $18.00. I must say the staff was on their game and tried to make everyone happy. The kitchen was slow to bring the food. I just feel I was ripped off. Feel like not going out to eat anymore after this."

It was ok, wait staff was pleasant, but, had to be reminded to do their job (drink refills). It took a long time to be waited on as well as receive our drinks (iced tea) - nothing fancy ordered. An apology and excuse was given once delivered. Another excuse given for the time taken to come back and take our order. Unfortunately, this was the same problem we had on our last visit.

Food was ok - nothing exceptional to point out. For the price, it certainly could have been better. With the variety of restaurants in the area, I don&#39;t see another visit to this one in our future."

My most recent visit was rather disappointing.  I am guessing they are under new management because the level of quality and care was not there.

They did not have bread because oven was not functioning properly.  Now if you have gone to Carrabba&#39;s, you know the bread is a delicious part of the dining experience.  Can&#39;t faulty them if oven is not working though.  Eventually we did get bread, but the size was half what it was and the few sprinkles of herbs in the olive oil dip was pointless.  Seems they are cutting back on things.

Asked for a substitution on my meal, what I was substituting costs less than what was on the dish, but manager said not possible to substitute.  Ok...so I ordered something else, the new shrimp risotto.  When the dish arrived, I was surprised to see what appeared to be way too much tomato sauce with rice - no risotto I had ever seen.  Tasted like it should have been on the kids menu as their interpretation of Chef Boyardee.

My dining guests also noted the decline in food quality.

Really disappointing.  Think I will look for a different location to visit."

 When children who enjoy italian food are saying that the food wasnt great

15 bucks is too much for the entrees they serve and 30 minutes is too long to wait for the quality of the experience.

Advice to management:

Lower the prices or raise the quality of 
  the food and the experience. Other
  locations are better.

 Management should be auditing tables. 

Our orders sat for a while before
 arriving at our table. Pasta was stiff
 and stuck together. 

Fried calamari quality is bad. 

Overall, we chose between you, maggianos and rosebud. Not the best experience."

The server was good, service was pretty fast. But everything we ordered, well, was fairly tasteless and I was really sad in the end that we had to pay for it.

I always try and find the non-chain place to eat, especially when it comes to Italian cuisine. However, rest assure that you are not walking into an upscale version of Olive Garden.  I feel like Carabbas has a lot to offer diners and when you have a taste for Italian and don&#39;t want to try a new place and risk disappointment that Carabbas is always a good meal. 

The bread that they bring to everyone is amazing. It is always brought to your table piping hot and they bring a secret satchel of spices that they mix with olive oil that is really tasty.  I usually eat too much bread and then can&#39;t eat my dinner, but there is nothing wrong with leftovers.

I love their salad and they have a really great vinaigrette that is one of my favorites. I don&#39;t like the calamari here; the breading is too heavy. Instead try the bruschetta or just eat some extra bread. I have had a few good main dishes from Carabbas that I think are winners: the grilled salmon, the chicken marsala, and the spiedino di mare have always been great. Carrabas has incredible desserts, my favorite is the dessert rosa, but they are all very good.  They also have a great wine and drink menu - try the Limonicella Martini; you won&#39;t be disappointed! 

A few other notes about my latest visit - they recently added a Prix Fixe menu that lets you have an appetizer, entree and dessert which is great.  The server we had was not the greatest - I would give her a 2 out of 5, but I have been here and had great service before too."

I was under the impression that this was one of those order at a counter, sit and wait for your food kind of establishments.  I&#39;m not sure why I thought that, but I wasn&#39;t really expecting much on our first visit.  

The restaurant is pretty classy.  It&#39;s obviously a chain, but it&#39;s decorated nicely and it&#39;s pretty romantic if you&#39;re looking for a date spot.  I really liked the kitschy Italian cafe decor, but I&#39;m in to that kind of thing.  The only weird thing is this restaurant is super dark.  I would have loved this for a date, for sure, but it was really weird to not really be able to see when we first entered.  When we left the sun was literally blinding because the restaurant is so dark.  They need to work on that.  I didn&#39;t think the tables were super close together and we sat in a six-person booth, so we kind of had our own area.  

Their menu also surprised me - there were a lot more selections than I had imagined and everything looked good.  I ordered the lasagna entree that came with soup.  I ordered a pasta soup which was delicious and the lasagna was excellent.  I mean excellent.  My mom ordered the lamb chop entree and said it was amazing.  She&#39;s a very picky eater, especially when it comes to meat and how it&#39;s cooked, so it must be pretty good if it impresses her.  Everyone at the table agreed that their food was delicious and everyone cleaned their plate but me (that piece of lasagna was just way too big to finish).  

I have read a lot of comparisons between this restaurant and Olive Garden but Carrabba&#39;s is so much classier than Olive Garden.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I actually like Olive Garden and all that it has to offer - it has a menu of pretty cheap, premade Italian fare that is tasty and hearty.  However, Carrabba&#39;s has a better menu, higher-end selections (veal, lamb, etc.), large wine list and homemade food.  Everything tasted fresh and delicious and I was pretty impressed with the entire restaurant."

We have been there a few times and have tried almost every burger and while they have all been fantastic, the Blue Bacon Burger is my favorite. They are cooked to medium unless you specify otherwise, but they are always cooked perfectly. Great flavor and they are huge. The burgers also come with a side of tater tots, and really who doesn&#39;t love tater tots. I think they deep fry theirs or something, because they are amazingly crispy on the outside, not the soggy mess they can sometimes be at other restaurants. And if you&#39;re a real tots fan, the tot-chos are also great. But probably dangerous, because they are covered in cheese, jalapenos and bacon.

As for the beer, they try to change it up quite a bit and really know their beers on tap. Their service is fantastic and it&#39;s a great place to just hang out, have a beer and maybe a burger, but be hungry!"

With all the neon signs and generator piwered lights you&#39;ll not miss it, alternatively just follow the smell.

Been to several taco places within the area and I would say they&#39;re a solid 4 on the taste. That&#39;s if you have patience to wait 30mins for your order. Could be the timing too since we came here around 7-8pm when there&#39;s already 6 customers waiting ahead of me. For a buck 80 each we ordered the taco pastor which was very delicious and is the hero of this story. Well marinated beef steak cutlets, grilled to perfection. The taco asada is also great with the tender flavorful chicken. But then there&#39;s the chorizo taco which I would call the villain. It was too salty for my taste, even with the cilantro and onions trying it&#39;s best to maintain balance to my palate but failed. Everything was served with 2 corn tortillas to hold the awesome goodness together and your choice of salsa. My personal fave, salsa verde.

The kiddos ordered the quesadilla con carne with the choice of meat. My kids ordered the ground beef topped with chihuahua cheese cut in 4 bite size portions, perfect for small meal eaters like my kids. You know everything is made fresh since they give away the last few pieces when they ran out of ingredients. I love supporting great small homegrown businesses like this. Till we meet again!"

I have driven by this place on numerous occasions and finally had the chance to try them out today. The girl taking orders was friendly and attentive.  I went with several tacos (chicken, steak, and pastor). The tacos were pretty blah, lacking in flavor and also very dry. I had to drench them in hot sauce to make them edible.  The pastor was probably the best out of the bunch. Also the green mild sauce was better than the hot sauce in terms of flavor. I would probably give these guys another chance and try some other items on the menu next time. They only take cash."

Here is the lowdown: If you get any of their fresh seafood or fish, you will be very happy. The blackened approach or even simply grilled are sooooo good. And their garlic rolls are pretty darn amazing. 

Blackened salmon = five stars, easy. Especially with the site fried veggies. The stir fried veggies are bright, crispy, flavorful and interesting. 

King crab legs = five easy stars. Pre-split, served with warm, drawn butter. Fantastic all the way around. Yeah, they are pricey but they are worth it for sure. 

Now for the not so great stuff...

Avoid any pasta dish. The pasta is overcooked and kind of mushy and the sauces are nothing to write home about. 

Their steamed veggies are bland, boring and mushy. When you get their veggies, go with the stir fried. They are a little more money but worth it for sure. 

We had one dessert and it was quite possibly the worst dessert I&#39;ve had in my life. It was a creme brûlée cake (I think) that was like eating cement. 

So those are my tips. Bottom line: Order their fish blackened or grilled, stir fried veggies and of course crab legs and you&#39;ll be happy."

I ordered the lobster mac and cheese and the teriyaki chicken (Was going to take leftovers to my husband). The mac and cheese had good flavor, but the pasta was overcooked. There was also some shell still attached to the lobster meat, so you had to eat it rather carefully, so you wouldn&#39;t crack a tooth. I was wanting to love love it, but with those two issues I just couldn&#39;t. In regards to the chicken, 4 smaller thin breasts were served. They were juicy and moist, but the sauce tasted like they just drizzled some tastefully simple sauce on it. Also, for so much meat, and costing $18, you only got a small scoop of mashed potatoes.

Garlic bread is even different !!! 

I ordered a dozen oysters and it wasn&#39;t shuck correct I try slurping them and they didn&#39;t loosen them up. This is a big no no 

I order a 18 oz ribeye it look more like 12 oz and wasn&#39;t cook right 

Ask for med rare it&#39;s was bloody rare ....

Server was good very nice but everything else was just average

From the garlic rolls (I call them &#39;crack rolls&#39;) to the fabulous oysters on the half shell to the grilled lobster to the crab claws, everything was MOUTHWATERING

More than the food though, our server (Rich) made our night wonderful.  Despite having his entire station being seated pretty much all out once, Rich was able friendly, attentive (but not overly so) and made some DELICIOUS suggestions."

Here&#39;s what I love about this place.  1. The atmosphere is casual - any attire goes!  It reminds me of being in Florida, absent the beach.  2. The most important reason you eat out is the food.  The seafood is always fresh with a variety of choices.  3.  The service is always great. 

I tend to get the same things here, since they are my favorite.  The lobster bisque is superb!  Creamy flavor with bit hunks of lobster.  I&#39;ve never had the pleasure of consuming lobster bisque before and have nothing to compare it to.  Grilled scallops - always cooked to perfection with a nice blend of seasoning.  Manchong fish  from Hawaii - its a steak life fish that is meaty with a sweet taste.  Its was a recommendation of the waiter and I eat it every time its on the menu!  It&#39;s my absolute favorite.  I&#39;m not much of a fried food lover, so I&#39;ve never had the fried shrimp - but it looks good!

If you&#39;re in the mood for seafood, its a great place in the western suburbs!"

Everything they brought out to us was worse and worse. I had snow crab with vegetables. The snow crab was salty and limp. I&#39;m guessing it wasn&#39;t fresh or they cooked it twice. It was absolutely disgusting. I&#39;ve never had anything like it. My mom had stuffed shrimp and she couldn&#39;t even get through a bite without the oily taste in her mouth. We had to send the food back and leave. It was really disappointing considering we were looking forward to a good Chinns meal. This Chinns is not anything compared to the Chinns in Wheeling. Just save your money and go there.

It wasn&#39;t that good. Filled with mayo and fillers and not too much lobster. The slaw side looked unappetizing so didn&#39;t even try it

Got some fish tacos also that were decent. Average taste.

I felt this restaurant was overpriced.  

The garlic bread was so yummy. Ate two of them. 

Lunch vibes were ok, but I hear it&#39;s more of a dinner place. I saw an ad for a full 4 course meal for $75 that looked good but expensive. 

I felt dirty after I ate here and had to literally go home and shower. The ambiance is pretty casual. But still expensive. Not really good bang for the buck."

Our server was slightly slow (even though we were the only customers) but was very kind and talked to us warmly. We ordered a whole florida black sea bass steamed oriental, house salad, seafood italiano and shrimp. The food was fairly average. The whole fish was great as was its sauce and it was also nice to have unlimited salad but the cole slaw tasted slightly funky and the seafood italiano did not seem like it warranted its price tag. However, the complimentary garlic bread was delicious, it was probably my favorite out of everything we ate. 

Pros: 

-Lots of seating
-Garlic bread
-Nice service

Cons:

-Price on certain items"

We have tried everything from their lobster to their crab to the different types of fish to their steak.  Yes!  Steak!  This last time we were here my son ordered the surf n turf and got a nice steak.  It wasn&#39;t huge as it was part of a combo, but he managed to exclaim that it was the best steak he&#39;s had in a very long time!  

I usually order the Hawaiian monchong fish and find that they do a wonderful job keeping the fish moist and tender.  This is an unusual fish to find on a menu but we always find it to be fresh as with all of the other seafood.  Chinn&#39;s posts their airbills in their lobby and you can see for yourself which seafood is FLOWN IN fresh each day!  This is what sets Chinn&#39;s apart from other seafood restaurants---you can see for yourself the expense that was paid for your meal.  

In general it is difficult to get a table without a wait when you come later in the evening or on a weekend.  However, we usually have good luck when we eat early, arriving at the restaurant before 6pm.  By the time we finish eating and leave the restaurant, it is usually packed.  You will find people there from all walks of life, senior citizens, families, ethnic Chinese, etc....  Although the restaurant itself can seem low-key, with people wearing casual shorts and t-shirts, you will also find other patrons dressed up for a special night out, celebrating birthdays and just having a nice romantic dinner.  Very eclectic mix of customers! 

The servers are generally well-trained and attentive but not overbearing.  I&#39;m glad to see that Chinn&#39;s, an old-fashion seafood restaurant, is still flourishing amongst the trendy diners that I see come and go everyday."

Their lobster, lobster tails, King Crab legs, Snow Crab legs, and steaks are delicious. If you like noodles, may I suggest their shrimp or crab meat stir fried vermicelli.  It is delicious! Love their garlic rolls that they serve at the table upon being seated.  And after eating a great meal you finish with their fabulous key lime pie (they have other desserts but their key lime pie is a family favorite).  Add to that their excellent wait staff and you have all the ingredients for a great dining experience.  We eat here at least once or twice monthly.  I highly recommend this place."

Their garlic rolls, a stake and signature of the establishment, are wonderful. 

They always have fresh fish and avoid variety. I had the seafood gumbo.  This was awesome and could have been a meal all by itself. Just delicious. 

I also had the seafood salad. It was fresh, but light in the seafood. That&#39;s why I rated this review four stars.

I was pleased though with my experience. The place was not overly crowded, so we were seated in a small booth by the window. The host joked about our lovely view of Ogden Ave, and they adjusted the shade promptly when the sun started glaring in.

Our waitress was very attentive in checking in on us, none of the service issues that other people mentioned in the least.

I wanted to order the lobster roll sandwich, but they were out of the rolls, I guess for that. I then chose the coconut shrimp with fries. The order came out VERY quickly- to the point that I said a prayer of no food poisoning before I ate it. The jumbo shrimp really were huge! The coconut flavor was prominent but not over powering- they were pretty fantastic with or without the mango chutney. The fries were &#34;steakish&#34; style, not as huge wedge pieces, but not shoestring, and I really enjoyed them. The garlic roll was good, a little too messy/greasy though.

The waitress sold us quickly on the mai tais. They were big and pretty dangerous. One was enough! Definitely the best mai tai experience I&#39;ve ever had, not too heavy on one particular ingredient. 

The ambiance there is something I didn&#39;t get. The prices and food options said &#39;semi-fancy&#39; to me, but then the neon plastic cups for water and mai tais did not. It looked funny to see those cups next to wine glasses all on one table. It was a bit of a disconnect, but overall enjoyable."

It was 5p and my husband and I were waiting for our friend. We waited in the lot to go in together, but my husband noticed the lot was filling up fast so we went in to make sure we got a seat. The first thing you notice is the amazing garlic smell permeating the lobby. The restaurant was over 1/2 full and we were seated immediately. We asked what the delicious smell was and our waiter said their bread.....he brought us some hot buttered hard rolls with fresh garlic and I wanted to eat them both. Out of this world. Our friend came and we noticed at 6p it was standing room only. I had the Fried gulf shrimp, my husband had the king crab legs and our pal had the ahi tuna. All were delectable. You get one side with your meal, I had fettuccini Alfredo, and it was yummy. I passed on the salad because it was ala carte which was fine, because I came for the seafood. When we walked out we noticed the receipts the restaurant received from their fish mongers that day hanging on the wall; one was from Maine, one from Florida and Maryland and one from San Francisco. The fish were flown in that day and probably just caught. Amazing. We will be back."

Friends consistently rave about the food, and having forgot that their Maine Lobster, Stone Crabs, sauteed frog legs and Crab Legs, are some of the best you&#39;ll get anywhere in the Chicago area, and rival Joe&#39;s Stone Crab, especially with a better price. If you can snag a Groupon, even better, as they offer $60 for $30 - nice! A friend and I decided to go. So, so glad we did! First, the place is brighter and cheerier and visibly updated, which is quite nice. Staff is helpful, professional, attentive and perfect for the occasion. 

Where the venue may lack (as do most seafood joints in New England, mind you) fanciness and upscale accessories, service is top notch! Chinn&#39;s was packed, yet our server, Missy, never missed refilling our drinks and making sure we didn&#39;t need anything else and to check to see how we were enjoying our meals. Attentive, helpful and friendly is an understatement. We received the service of a 5 star restaurant without the sometimes uppity attitude. 

The garlic rolls at Chinn&#39;s are delicious! So much of the bread basket carb on the table is cold and tasteless. Not these! They may be drowning in butter, warm and loaded with fresh garlic, but that&#39;s what makes them great. When I couldn&#39;t decide what to order, server, Missy C. gave a fabulous run-down with a perfectly detailed description of the wonderfulness Chinn&#39;s has to offer. Surprisingly, no crab or lobster ordered for this visit, but the stuffed shrimp with a side of Alfredo pasta. Decadent beyond explanation! The 6 jumbo shrimp were moist, flavorful and delicious, as was the pasta with just enough fresh parsley (I believe) to make a difference. My friend ordered the lamb chops with white rice and steamed veggies was a perfect mix of fresh flavors. At least 1/2 of our meals were packed as doggie bags, yet we wanted to try the baked pumpkin cheesecake. WOW! Homemade on the premises never tasted so good!"

The place seemed like it couldn&#39;t quite figure on what it wanted to be.  The decor is pretty much family friendly, diner-type stuff.  Cheap tablecloths, plastic fluorescent cups, etc. but the menu prices are decidedly gourmet upscale restaurant.

The food was pretty good.  The garlic knots they give you before dinner were just okay -- they were basically dough nuggets sitting in a pool of butter with way too much raw garlic on top.  I actually like Red Lobster&#39;s rolls much better, and that&#39;s a chain restaurant.  I got the Shrimp DeJonge, which again was super garlicly, but the shrimp was tasty and they were huge.  The potatoes I got on the side were really bland though, as was the coleslaw.

Overall it was fine, but if I wanted to spend that kind of money on a seafood place I&#39;d try Catch 35 or McCormick &amp; Schmick before coming here."

The meal was so lacking that I had to hear my boyfriend complain the entire 25-minute drive home about all the restaurants that we could have went to along the way for less than half the price.

After seeing all the raving reviews about their garlic rolls, I was excited when the server finally brought the rolls to our table. Honestly, it was not that great. It strangely tasted like a dinner roll, oil and minced garlic all separated in your mouth; it just didn&#39;t blend well. The aftertaste is as if you just drank a teaspoon of oil and then ate some minced garlic by itself afterward. Even Red Lobster&#39;s biscuits tasted better. We also happened to sit in front of the &#34;garlic roll station.&#34; It turns out that they use tongs to take the rolls from the toaster and drop them into a pan full of oil and garlic. After the rolls are completely drenched in oil, then they serve them to you.

NOTE: You can get the rolls without the oil and garlic. Just request them from the server, and they&#39;ll give you butter on the side instead.

The fact that their seafood is flown in fresh is great. To ruin the seafood with terrible cooking brings a tear to my eye. I ordered the Whole Alaskan Dungeness Crab served in garlic with a side of mixed veggies ($33.95) while my boyfriend ordered the Hawaiian Monchong with a side of potatoes ($27.95). The crab lacked flavor and was hard to swallow. I had to dip each piece of crab meat into the pool of garlic butter on my plate, which I normally don&#39;t do at other restaurants. The mixed veggies did not taste fresh either. My boyfriend said the fish was good but not for that price. Both entrees were definitely not worth the price paid.

There were two moments that were more on a positive note. At one point, I cracked a crab leg too hard, and a big chunk of crab meat flew towards the table next to us. Luckily, it didn&#39;t hit anyone, but the moment was like straight out of a comedy show. Towards the end of the meal, I asked for a dinner roll without the oil and garlic. The server brought me one straight from the toaster. The roll was so incredibly hot that I almost burned my fingers holding it. When I was finally able to pick it up and tear it in half, an incredible amount of steam came out from the center. My roll could have blended right into those restaurant TV commercials.

Overall, I would not recommend going here unless you want their Mai Tai based on all the other reviews. Your wallet will thank you."

We found a groupon and thought that would be a perfect way to check it out. At the end of our visit the server said &#34;I hope you had a kind of OK time&#34;. And it was exactly that, kind of OK.

We were at the restaurant for over 2 hours. It took us 45 minutes to get our food and after we were done it took 20 minutes to get/pay our bill.

My fiancé had the strip steak which was very dry and fried shrimp that was mediocre. I had the 2 pound Maine lobster which was over cooked. Long story short we were quite disappointed and would not recommend."

I called ahead for preferred seating which pretty much didn&#39;t make a difference we still waited over 30min. After finally being seating I felt rushed to order there was someone walking around looking at tables like the warden at a prison. The garlic bread was extremely salty. I ordered the Shrimp and Pasta the noodles were dry and there was half of a cup of some sort of broth maybe water mixed with small pieces of garlic at the bottom absolutely no flavor.

Every year the four of us go out to a nice dinner to celebrate my husband and best friend&#39;s birthdays and also to celebrate Christmas. We were a little late this year (Valentine&#39;s day weekend :P) but decided to try Chinns because we wanted seafood. There were good parts and bad parts...and I&#39;m not even talking about the hour wait. I&#39;m chalking that up to Valentine&#39;s Day weekend, and we should have probably expected that :P

From Candice&#39;s review, I HAD to have the Mai Tai. It didn&#39;t disappoint :) It was just sweet enough and not watered down. When we finally got seated, we already had an idea of what we wanted to have.

Ahi Tuna Appetizer: Although the rest of the table wanted the lobster bisque, I wanted to try the Ahi Tuna Appetizer that was under the raw bar. This menu item&#39;s description was a little confusing, but I clarified with the waiter that it was raw and not seared or cooked at all. (I&#39;m not a huge fan of cooked tuna, but LOVE raw tuna). I was pretty disappointed when it came out seared :( Once we flagged down the waiter though, he did rectify it very quickly and got me a plate of sashimi tuna, which was pretty good.

Garlic Rolls: The garlic rolls looked great, but the garlic flavor was just on the outside of the roll, and didn&#39;t penetrate inside. It was a good starter, but I think it was hyped up too much from other reviews :(

Lobster Bisque: The rest of the table got the lobster bisque, and I have to say it was absolutely delish! You could taste the sherry in it, but it wasn&#39;t overwhelming. Good thing the husband got a bowl!

Alaskan &#34;Bairdi&#34; Snow Crab: Unfortunately I&#39;m up in the air about the snow crab. On the one hand, the flavor and quality of the snow  crab was very good. On the other hand, I am a fan of lemon butter and the butter was SO DISAPPOINTING! It was very watered down and you could barely taste the butter. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, thinking that they may have put the butter down first before they put the crab n the plate and some boiling liquid could have gotten into the butter. I asked for another butter, but it was the same watered down flavor :( The only thing that saved the meal was that the flavor of the crab was there. It did also come with a side of veggies, but unfortunately overcooked :/

Our experience at Chinns was good, but I don&#39;t think I could recommend anyone to go there for a special experience. The quality of the fish was definitely there but the rest of the experience makes me want to recommend another seafood restaurant."

That being said, the entire problem that I experienced (the server) could totally be rectified at this point, or at least I hope :)

My friend and I met after work on a Monday for a quick jog (knowing we&#39;d need to burn some calories before eating here!). We managed to get lost, so we didn&#39;t arrive to eat at Chinn&#39;s until around 8pm. We were quickly seated and greeted.

This is where it started to get fishy (womp womp). 

Our server was very rough. Older woman, disheveled, and to the point. Not until after we ordered a drink and an appetizer did she lighten up the slightest, when she realized we were actually ordering more than the special. Mai Tai&#39;s - go down so easy! The cups though? Don&#39;t add up. Isn&#39;t this supposed to be an expensive and semi-formal restaurant? Neon cups don&#39;t make sense. Nonetheless, we were pumped to go home with a stackful. 

I started with a cup of lobster bisque. Very filling...and, not as good as my fave (Clubhouse in Oakbrook). Our calamari appetizer was well cooked and a good portion.

For dinner, we both ordered the crab legs. We had multiple friends recommend Chinn&#39;s and this dish, so dine we did. After several minutes, our server stopped by to ask how we were doing. Before allowing us to answer, she looked at me and said that I wasn&#39;t eating the crab legs efficiently enough...and proceeded to PICK UP MY FOOD WITH HER HANDS and crack open the shell. WTF!!!!!!!!!!!! I was appalled. Thinking back to it, I wish I had told a manager, but I didn&#39;t and left completely grossed out. 

We left very shortly after and I haven&#39;t been back. No LivingSocial or Groupon deal is good enough to entice me to come back for that reason alone!"

Date of visit: Sunday, Feb. 21, 2016, 5:30pm

SERVICE: Our waiter got 6 tables pretty much at once, just after we got sat.... he always seemed rushed and somewhat inattentive, trying to juggle it all, while other wait staff (who could have helped) strolled leisurely in their sections. We had to flag him down several times for service and when we did, he seemed like WE were being an imposition to HIM!

FOOD: The mini crab cakes were small discs of mush on shredded head lettuce, looking like something from a 1960&#39;s diner.Not nearly worth the $12 they charge for them.

Oysters Rockefeller had a decent taste, however what ever they put on top was NOT a hollandaise sauce... still not sure what it was! But in fairness, it didn&#39;t taste bad at all.

Coconut shrimp for $25 came out BURNT.. We took it home and decided to throw it into the garbage! As it was a Sunday night, perhaps the fryer grease was dirty from the weekend... I&#39;d be embarrassed to bring it out to a table. We would have sent it back, except we never saw our waiter again until we flagged him down for a check.

My surf n&#39; turf... this 6 oz filet, while smaller than 6 oz.. (more of a medallion!) was cooked perfectly... I cannot say the same for my rocjk lobster tail which was overcooked to the point of a textural nightmare... definitely NOT WORTH THE $55 they charged for it. 

When &#34;Steve&#34; brought it to our table, I asked for extra lemon for the lobster, and the look I got from him was one also of &#34;Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m busy?!!!&#34; as he huffed off to get me a few wedges.

All in all our $188 dinner for two (with tip) was an expensive experience we&#39;ll remember... for all the wrong reasons.. Terrible service, terrible attitudes, terrible food.

IF YOU WANT A GOOD SEAFOOD EXPERIENCE WITH PROFESSIONAL SERVICE WHERE YOU ARE TRULY VALUED AS A CUSTOMER AND NOT JUST A WALLET, GO ELSEWHERE!

First, our drinks were served in cheap, give away at the elementary school fun fair, plastic cups. Service was very slow even though not busy. As for the food, disappointing. We all ordered fish dishes and were totally unimpressed. While fresh, the fish lacked seasoning and presentation. The high price of the meal was grossly disproportionate to the quality.

If you&#39;re looking for a fancy looking place, this isn&#39;t it, but if you&#39;re looking for a place for good food and service.  I would highly recommend this place!

The garlic rolls are probably the best I&#39;ve had other than the original Bob Chinns.  We ordered egg rolls and fried calamari for appetizers and both were delicious.  Egg rolls are amazing, calamari was good.  The clam chowder is really good and I would recommend that over the gumbo.

 As for the meals, we ordered the whole lobster and sauteed scallops.  Lobster was broiled just right so it wasn&#39;t chewy or rubbery.  Scallops had a lite dusting of flour.

All in all a great meal!  Forgot to mention the service.  Our waiter Rich.... By far one of the best waiters I&#39;ve ever experienced.  Top notch!  If I was opening a restaurant, I would hire Rich to train all the other waiters.

The quality of food is terrible and for the price I shouldn&#39;t have to worry about bones being in the fried fish on the child&#39;s menu.

We also shared coconut shrimp and scallops (came with about 3 of each), which came with your choice of a side dish. We opted for steamed veggies for our side, but ended up receiving pasta (fettuccine with alfredo sauce). Our waiter apologized for the mistake and quickly brought out a side of vegetables."

Crap is hanging from the dirty vents, the stalls are broken, one of the toilet seats is cracked and the last time I used it, it PINCHED me! There is always debris all over the floor, even early in the evening as though no one ever checks it. 

I have a theory about seeing filthy parts of a restaurant, and it leads me to believe if they would let me see this, then how horrible might the kitchen be??

This place, unfortunately, has begun to spiral down hill a bit from it&#39;s former glory.  I&#39;ve frequented two-three times a year, and unfortunately they&#39;ve gotten to the point where they heavily utilize groupon and other &#34;deal sites&#34; to help to draw crowds in, which I firmly believe is a vicious cycle.

Use coupons to draw crowd, raise prices to off set coupons, reduce quality/quantity to off set coupons, see less crowds when coupons are used up, use coupons to draw a crowd...

Garlic bread still is a nice stand out, but c&#39;mon... warm bread, garlic, olive oil... how CAN you possibly lose with that combination?

Verdict:  The prices have climbed while the quality of the fish seems to have gone down a bit, and the quantity is slightly smaller.  What once was a great place to dine has kind of jumped the shark... perhaps they need to add that to the menu?  Though at the current prices, I&#39;m not sure it would help..."

Tonight we ate there again on a Groupon.  Because of the so-so reviews we had lowered our expectations.  However, we were pleasantly surprised at by the dishes we had and the helpfulness of the waiters. Richard was training Craig and both were very attentive.  We had soft shell crabs as an appetizer (which Richard recommended we have fried).  Two large delicious crabs for close to $20.  My wife had two key lime martinis because they were so good.  She had a salad and scallops and I had the seafood pasta (rice noodles). Both dishes were excellent.  Richard recommended alfredo sauce for the pasta dish, but I went with marinara.  I asked for some of the alfredo sauce on the side and after tasting it wished that I had taken his advice.  Three drinks, 1 salad, 1 expensive appetizer, 2 entrees set us back $100 not including tip.  The Groupon saved us $60.  Expensive, butIthink worth it."

Saturdays tend to be extremely busy and they don&#39;t take reservations, so if you don&#39;t get there early, you will sit with your lobster pager until your table is ready.

It tends to get loud when it is packed and difficult to hear others at your table, so speak LOUDER, and of course, a lot of other people will hear you, too.

The others showed their Groupon before ordering and I said I had one too.  The waiter said he would check with the manager and came back confirming they would only accept one.  We asked to speak to the manager who showed up with an obvious chip on his shoulder.  He told us we should read the fine print and asked if he should provide customer service to everyone!!!!!  Why yes, customer service is crucial in a restaurant. After paying, my friend, who did sales and customer service training for much of his career, asked him if he knew how to spell &#34;Yelp&#34;.

Three people at our table ordered the Monchong - the 7 way fish of the night.  Was served very dry and tasteless.  It&#39;s supposed to be a white, buttery fish.  This wasn&#39;t. It was prepared grilled at the suggestion of the server.  I had the mashed potatoes as a side for my dinner.  One very small scoop.  My wife had the vegetable side and noted that the portion was small.  Cole slaw served in a cup with dinner was almost non existent.  My wife and I each needed tartar sauce to scarf a fresh fish dinner down.  Shame.  I like fish, eat it often, (without tartar sauce) and this was either not fresh or poorly prepared - or both.  Not what we expect from Chinn&#39;s.   Yes, the garlic rolls were good, but this is a seafood restaurant.  This isn&#39;t the Chinn&#39;s we&#39;ve known for years.  Perhaps an odd occurrence?

The owner of this place must be related to Bob Chinn of Bob Chinn&#39;s Crabhouse because the rolls are the same.  And they&#39;re equally delicious, looking at you from a pool of delicious garlicky buttery goodness. The mai tai, a specialty here that you can also take home in gallon form, was delicious. My French martini was less so. It was like I could just taste how cheap the alcohol in it was. The atmosphere was sort of drab. 

The wait staff was nice and very accommodating with my table&#39;s demands for &#34;more bread! More bread now, aurghhhhhhh!!&#34; The bisque was flavorful and creamy. The filet was requested to be rare and it was close enough for government work. The lobster tails felt a smidge overcooked. We also had sea bass that comes out as a whole fish on a platter shaped like a dish (adorbs!) which was quite good.

I am not one to complain on restaurants &amp; managers but I do work in the food industry business and I do my job very well (No, im not a cook or server but a regional director for several restaurants under an umbrella brand) and cannot stand when i am the customer and don&#39;t get the service I provide anyway, our party walks in and we get told 10 min wait with a reservation..no big deal.

After and hour and 10 mins, were all standing there being patient as always and mingling amongst ourselves, still no table mind you we had &#34;reservations&#34; which didn&#39;t mean anything clearly. 

The manager standing right next to us never bothered to check in on us or even offer a glass of water..customer service 101.

We were handed the buzzing pager which is shaped like a lobster which was pretty neat seeing that everywhere else you go they are square, still no table open.

I went to talk to the manager (the guy with coke bottle glasses, i mean it in a nice way) and made it aware that its been well over an hour and 10 mins after being told 10 mins for our table, his response &#34;its Saturday night&#34; with a look as if it was my problem..

After, we finally gave up and I returned the pager and all I got was &#34;thanks, have a goodnight&#34;..wow. I don&#39;t care how busy it might be but you just let $400 walk out your door and will never come back. DUMBA**.

Coke bottles, if you reading this...
Your customer service skills are crap, it only takes one time to lose a customer, again skills 101.

Also, try and offer the group a free drink say your beer to keep them happy and not thinking you wasted 1.5 hrs of their time. 

In closing, I&#39;m sure the food is good there but the service and logistics need dire help. Being that size and busy on a Saturday night you should rethink your layout or god forbid you add a table that can fit more than 4.

It smelled funny (other than the fish smell) and they had pieces of paper thumb tacked to the ceiling where there was apparent water damage. The rug was extremely sticky with every step. We would have gotten a meal 100 times better at Red Lobster. A waste of money and a waste of what was supposed to be a special dinner.

Excellent quality and fresh seafood
Simple and casual table setting
Friendly and casual environment
Delicious and bottomless garlic rolls

Wife had Seafood Italiano (with angel hair pasta), and I had chargrilled Florida black grouper - both fresh and very good.  The red potatoes with the grouper could have been boiled more, but not a biggie.  What struck me most was how vibrant and casual the dining room was on a Friday evening.  It was relatively dead on two previous lunch visits from years ago.  Also, a few patrons were in T-shirt and shorts, while another was wearing a tie  - a casual and well accepted mix.  Most diners seemed to be 45+, so it&#39;s an older crowd.  Folks are here for good food in a plain and casual setting, and we&#39;re in that group too for this place.  Overall rating of 4  is based on something like 5 for the food, and 3 for the setting and rest."

I had the Hawaiian Monchong grilled with fresh veggies on the side.  My husband had another fish prepared oriental and my daughter had one of the shrimp dishes.  All were fresh, tasty and prepared to our liking.  I think the prices at Chinn&#39;s are a bit steep but with a coupon and the wine special, our meal was reasonable."

But the fish was prepared rare and not medium rare as I requested. I know the difference, and medium rare does not mean &#34;seared on the outside and raw to the middle.&#34; But good fish is fine rare, so I decide to settle (again) and just eat it. Sadly the fish was a poor cut and had sinew throughout. That&#39;s not a proper cut for a tuna steak. At this point I sent it back, though the waiter wanted to argue with me that it was indeed medium rare. 

At this point let me say that I worked the line in a very similar fish house in North Carolina. I know two things that are relevant to the situation. (1) Medium rare for a cut like this is pink throughout and a cool center. Not a seared exterior and otherwise cold throughout. (2) Don&#39;t ever try to argue with a customer about what is and is not the proper preparation of meat at any temperature. Even if the customer is wrong, you&#39;re not going to gain anything by arguing. 

But the waiter was cool about it and brought me a new cut. This time I ordered it medium. Overlooked for a nice ahi steak, but if ordering mid-rare got me rare then ordering medium would get me mid-rare, right? Nope. Same temperature (seared outside and cold throughout). Worse yet, the same sinew membrane was layered throughout. Again, this is avoidable if you sell steak cuts from the belly and not tail where smaller strips can be extracted for sushi. 

The resulting cut was from a chef who is either lazy, cheap, or doesn&#39;t know how to cut fish. I know that&#39;s harsh, but no chef that cared about their reputation would have served that cut. Twice."

The &#34;butter&#34; that came with my legs tasted like oil not butter.  My family who do not eat any seafood ordered the steak and pasta dishes which were all terrible!

I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve been extra picky or sensitive when going out, but the service sucked pretty bad. 

Went here for my gf&#39;s birthday and the dining area felt like Bob Chinn&#39;s except a bit fancier and a whole lot smaller. 

Food was really good as gf, her brother, and father got the king crab legs and enjoyed them. Just as an fyi... the 2lbs is actually more money than the 1.5lbs in terms of value, but you do get a claw. I got apakapaka which I really enjoyed as well. 

My qualm was with our server who is bringing back bad memories as I type this (figured I would wait around a month before writing so I wouldn&#39;t be too critical.) So the credit card machines were down so they were a bit busier. Whatever... understandable. My qualm is that you still need to treat your customers well... You need to earn your tip. Unfortunately, that guy did not deserve the nice tip my gf&#39;s dad gave. I will go further into the price after I expound on the lack of service by this server.

So, service was slow and not so great, but that wasn&#39;t what pissed me off. Because it was my gf&#39;s birthday I took the day off and ran errands all over Chicagoland. One thing I got was the Atomic Cake which gf really likes. I had to remind the server about the cake (in private) when he asked us about dessert to which he said he completely forgot about. Gf already ordered the coconut pie which didn&#39;t come out even though I said to keep it ordered to the server. Worst part though was there was that the server brought out the cake as given to them. It was still in the box with the strings still wrapped around the box. WTH... I expected it coming out with him singing and a candle or two on the cake. No... We cut the cake ourselves and opened the box ourselves. Thanks for that asshole... 

Anyways... that pissed me off and thinking about it again makes me angry. Then there is the price... It&#39;s not cheap... It&#39;s certainly not cheaper than Bob Chinn&#39;s which I think is much better now. I used a groupon and a gift card (I knew it was going to be an expensive meal and wanted to chip in since I knew I wouldn&#39;t be allowed to cover the bill). The server messed up the bill... 

Notice how I barely talked about the food... Once you fuck up on service it just makes everything less special and all the negatives stand out more. Yes, the food is good, but I can get food like that elsewhere. I can think of Bob Chinn&#39;s as a prime example of somewhere else to go. I&#39;ve never had a problem there. Maybe it was a bad night for that server, but he certainly sucked enough where I&#39;d choose somewhere else.

If only I remembered that servers name now..."

We started with egg rolls and stone crab claws. The egg rolls were fried beyond recognition and loaded with grease. The crab claw shells were pulverized to the point that shards of the shells were embedded in the stale claw meat. It was like eating glass.

 My wife had the fried shrimp that looked like what you can get at a wholesale club and tasted like it too. I had the scallops au gratin with a side of rice. The scallops were buried in a blanket of half melted florescent sams club cheddar cheese in a pool of cream. When I stuck my fork in the cheese it all came up in one piece. The wife had a good laugh with that! 

Seem like they dont care about how the food comes out of the kitchen. No standards at all. The rice was just a ball on the plate and had a skin on it from being over cooked and compacted in an ice cream scoop. Nothing to even make it look appetizing. COME ON HOW ABOUT A SPRINKLE OF DRIED PARSLEY! SHOW SOME EFFORT! Spend the 3 cents and put a Basmati or a Jasmine rice on the plate.

 Coleslaw was in tiny black plastic cups your drinks come in those annoying plastic cups. The whole experience was cheap and disappointing. The only thing I can say was good was the service and the garlic rolls.They have a great staff that deserves to have great food to serve not this half ass effort from the kitchen, 

This is NOT Bob Chinn&#39;s it is his nephew that is not respecting the ingredients. We harvest these beautiful ingredients from the seas and need to show respect to all of it. After all we ended its life for our consumption.

 I would be embarrassed to serve food like that to my clients. People rave about the crab legs and the oysters... Well since the crab legs are precooked and the oysters are raw.... I think you get the picture.... No effort in making it. We have been here twice before and it has gotten worse with each visit. We always give a few chances to restaurants because they can have an off night. This was our third time here and it will be our last."

So we went here for a birthday celebration.  We started with Mai tais which were good but were overly sweet and some kick ass garlic rolls.   Ordered the mini crab cakes that were a bit dry but still tasty.  For dinner, we had the grouper prepared Oscar style.  It was under seasoned but once salt and pepper were applied it was tasty.   Also had king crab legs which seemed to be a bit overdone.  I&#39;ve seen that in other reviews as well.

I went with my husband for dinner on a Friday night.  We drive by all the time and the place seems to be constantly packed, so when a Groupon popped up I grabbed it.

We arrived around 6:30 after placing out names on a &#34;call ahead list.&#34; It was very busy and we had to park a good distance away on the street, it was cold and I wasn&#39;t thrilled about the walk.

Even though we had called ahead and they had our names down we were given a wait time of about 35 minutes.  I was told when I called that calling ahead wouldn&#39;t guarantee us a table, just a shorter wait than everyone else so that was fine.

We went to the bar to wait and it was a bit crowded, however, we lucked into some seats so that was fine.  The bar was BUSY but the bartender got to us fairly quickly.  I had a Mai Tai (whew!) they are strong!

We were seated fairly close to the quoted 35 minutes.  We got a nice booth and our server was friendly and helpful.  We got rolls, a second round of drinks, and our appetizer quickly but the food was a bit slow coming out.

I thought my Seafood Italiano was very good and my husband said his crab legs were good, but not memorable.  The shrimp cocktail appetizer was very tasty!

Even though the decor is a bit dated and the service was a little slow, I had a good time.  The two Mai Tais I drank probably contributed to my fun, but I&#39;m fine with that any day!"

We&#39;ve been to Chinn&#39;s many times.  Tonight&#39;s visit was pretty typical.

We were greeted as soon as we entered and promptly seated.  Our server, Catherine, was friendly and attentive, as were all the other employees we came in contact with.  Geeezzz.... that all sounds kinda stuffy.  The food was great and our server was great. We both had the steak and lobster - best steak I&#39;ve had in a while and the lobster was perfect.

We normally go to Chinn&#39;s on Monday to take advantage of the crab leg special, but we&#39;d snagged a GroupOn, so we went on a Tuesday this time.  Did you know they have an &#34;all you can eat&#34; shrimp special on Tuesdays?  We didn&#39;t know either (though I guess you can&#39;t use the GroupOn with the specials), but we will be back on a Tuesday to try the shrimp.

So why would I give 4.5 stars instead of 5?  Because of the price.  If we hadn&#39;t had the GroupOn, our dinner tab for 2 of the &#34;surf-n-turfs&#34;, salad and soup would have been about $10 or $15 too rich for a dinner that wasn&#39;t a &#34;special occasion.&#34;  However, since the GroupOn saved us $25, it ended up being an excellent value.

We&#39;ll be back for the Monday night specials, and we&#39;ll be there some Tuesday to check that special.  Oh.. okay - if possible I&#39;d give 4.75 stars."

I often hear about how expensive Chinn&#39;s is, and I have to say that that statement kinda shocks me--seafood is expensive, and beautiful, fresh seafood is even more expensive, and I&#39;ve never felt like I paid too much for what came on my plate.  I have to mention that after dozens of visits to Chinn&#39;s, I have yet to have over or under-done food, which astounds me, and I respect that level of consistency.  I love the crab vermicelli, and any crab dish really, and I always get the raw oysters and fried scallops(which aren&#39;t technically appetizers) as appetizers.  Some of the appetizers aren&#39;t very good (well, to me anyway), especially the fondue and those weird rolls with the peanut sauce and the lobster bisque (which is way too cheesy), and the way they prepare their fresh fish could use a little imagination, but I also appreciate that they don&#39;t go crazy and mask the subtle taste of fresh fish wish all kinds of crazy spices.  I have had many different servers over many years and I have always received excellent, friendly service. Finally, I gots me a sweet tooth and I love desserts, and they have AWESOME desserts, especially the key lime pie and coconut layer cake; I may like sweets, but I don&#39;t like my desserts to be too sweet, and whoever makes the desserts at Chinn&#39;s knows what papa bear here likes."

It&#39;s a warmed roll swimming in a pool of garlic oil - swimming is the key word. Go to Olive Garden where it&#39;s endless breadsticks if you like crappy bread with way too much grease and garlic. 

Self, don&#39;t order stone crabs at a restaurant unless the said restaurant has a reference to a Joe and has the said product in its name. This is a lesson I continue to learn since I love a good stone crab. The stone crab appetizer was not fresh. Looking back, I&#39;m not sure why I tempted faith and ate it. When you smell shellfish at a restaurant because you think I as a funny smell, don&#39;t eat it.  Yes, I&#39;m an idiot for eating it but when you go to a restaurant where the &#34;jet&#34; in fresh fish daily, a part of you thinks &#34;it&#39;s gotta be fresh so maybe my nose is off.....right?&#34;

The lobster bisque tasted suspiciously of chicken base in too much cream.  

Dover sole meunière deboned tableside when done properly is artful, however, the server really ended up butchering the fish though the server did ask my wife if she wanted the roe sack to be served, which I though was a nice gesture. The delicate flesh of the Dover sole was overpowered by the amount of sauced. Shameful really. 

Finally the frog legs.  When given the option of sautéed or fried, my better judgment for a lighter option steered me to the sautéed.  Lighter?  In the voice of Lee Corso, not so fast my friend. The frog legs were floured then sautéed, which I have absolutely no problem with. The problem comes in when they then put the frog legs in a shallow bowl where it sits in a pool of butter, leaving the frog legs with a gloppy mess of a breading doused in butter. 

I guess the Paula Deen in the overweight population of America would look at this and say WTF?  You can&#39;t have too much butter!  However, you&#39;d be wrong. A fresh piece of fish, any fish as long as its fresh, should be complemented by the sauce and not overwhelmed by it."

It&#39;s a little jewel that sits on the south side of 34th street in Lisle. It has a simple two toned grey and navy blue exterior that doesn&#39;t shout out to people passing by. Nor does the dimly lit interior which provides a warm and cozy atmosphere. However the food stands out. It&#39;s fresh aromatic qualities are pleasant from the moment you walk in.

Yesterday I had the Hawaiian Monchong. It was char-grilled and very tasty. It came with mixed veggies, lemon, coleslaw and a little dip for the fish. The meal was very appetizing and the waitress, MissyC, had a good sense of humor. The fish was very  moist &amp; tender and the portion was satisfying. According to Chinn&#39;s, the fish is flown in fresh daily. 

The appetizer I had before the main course was a cup of Crab Bisque with oyster crackers. It was delicious. The Garlic Rolls were hot, covered in a light oil w/garlic sprinkled on top. YUM!

A week before I had the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi and the same could be said about this dish. 

The cost of my meal was $25.

After waiting 40 min for our chocolate dessert to arrive, we decided to cancel, checkout and leave. This was already more than 3 hrs since we were seated.  
The bathrooms were filthy (6pm on a weeknight- they have only been open for 2 hrs which means it was never cleaned for the day).
I also feel the need to mention that since we were quite bored in between courses because of the slow service, we saw how the tables around us were cleaned. It was quite alarming. Unused wine glasses were placed unceremoniously on the booth seats and wiped down by the same washcloth used to wipe the tables with.  The busboy also accidentally unwrapped the new utensils wrapped in npkins he was placing and he just put them back holding the mouth ends with the same unclean hands he used to clean the table with.

First it was not very crowded but we had to wait for our whole party to be there. I just don&#39;t like that, especially when it&#39;s not busy, that&#39;s not good customer service. 

Next when they sit us (two adult couples) they put us next to a big family with crying little kids. It&#39;s suppose to be a nice environment and upscale yet they sit two couples next to crying kids? 

After the crying kids left the table was a mess and food was all over the floor. It was like we were sitting next to a dumpster. The wait staff didn&#39;t clean the area the whole time we were there. 

When we get our cheese fondue they tell us the sides to dip into the fondue are unlimited. &#34;Fantastic!&#34; I said, until our waitress didn&#39;t come back and we stared at our remaining cheese for 30 minutes. Then we received some extra sides. 

Overall I think this place was over priced and it was not worth the experience of this quality."

I was looking for a great meal because I&#39;ve seen this restaurant in passing.  My sister and I ordered drinks at the bar because we had to wait 30 mins for a table. The bartender was awsome. He made us drinks that weren&#39;t on the menu- both were $10 each but worth every penny. The fondue dinner was a complete joke. Our waitress explained the ordering process but would often disappear for 20 mins at a time. This place reminds me of a tapas restaurant. It might be ok if you dont plan on eating while dressed up in your skinny jeans or a body-con dress but don&#39;t expect to get full by any means. This place is for people that nibble on food and it&#39;s way over priced. I will never go back here to eat but would consider a drink only.

BUT I had the best experience here for my bday in October and although I don&#39;t need to come back like every week, I would like it if the Melting Pot hung around for a fun special occasion restaurant.

We arrived for our 6pm reservation and were literally the only people in the entire place, which was weird, for at least a half an hour. Our server was exceptional. She walked us through the whole fondue experience, our options, what we should expect, what her favorites were, etc. I never felt she was trying to upsell us on anything, as other reviewers noted. We all ordered the four course meal and began with the alpine cheese fondue, which was delightful. Gooey, decadent, awesomeness. Then we had a salad course, which was really delicious. I had the California salad which had candied pecans and blue cheese - it was sort of a low-budget WCG salad from White Chocolate Grill (which I adore).

Things slowed down at the entree course. It was still good, don&#39;t get me wrong, but the magic of the cheese fondue arriving basically ready to go was gone. You have to cook your food in the broth that comes, and you have to remember when you put what it so it&#39;s cooked, and it&#39;s just kind of overly complicated. Two pieces of chicken I had were undercooked in the middle (my fault but still terrifying) and I don&#39;t know how you would dine here without a phone with a timer on it - unless you just don&#39;t talk to anyone at the table while eating. I almost feel like this place would be more successful if they made the cheese fondue the star of the show and let you dunk heartier items - cooked chicken, beef, etc - into the cheesy goodness. I would pass on the entree course the next time I came.

HOWEVER, they DO finish strong with dessert! We got the classic milk chocolate fondue and the extra dippers (cheesecake, etc) and went to TOWN. I could barely move when we were done, but no krispie treats went uneaten. I accompanied dessert with a yinyang martini (not what it was called, but what it looked like) which was a creamy sweet boozy treat to end the night. 

All in all, I had a blast, and really enjoyed my evening at the Melting Pot. I would definitely return, but it would have to be a special occasion. So hang in there, Melting Pot - after all, I celebrate my birthday at least once a year!"

I have been to this location on multiple occasions, usually with my girlfriends and a groupon.   Of course there wasn&#39;t a groupon available for this family meal.  Service is usually excellent and the experience is enjoyable.  Not so for my recent experience.  

We were a party of 6 - 3 adults and 3 teens.  Sparing you the specifics the service was extraordinarily slow, dishes were not clean and dinner was a 3 hour affair.  I understand this is a meal to be savored, but we were ignored.  Drinks went unfilled, used dishes weren&#39;t cleared and food was not brought out in a reasonable time frame. At one point I asked the manager to step in and he did help get things moving.  Once he left us he never checked again and we were back to the same poor service.  The final straw was that they were out of bags for our leftovers.  Really?  Just poor service overall.  

Our dinner cost $300.  At that price I expect an extraordinary evening including impeccable service and attention to detail.  We were very disappointed in this restaurant and will not return.  I do not recommend this restaurant anymore."

Save your money and time and do not go here! I am originally from NY and have been to Melting Pot many times and it has always been amazing. Recently moved to IL and was so excited to see it as soon as we drove by. I obviously went in with too high of expectations because it was nasty. They advertised a lunch menu on the website but upon our arrival our waiter told us it didn&#39;t exist. We chose to start off with a cheese fondue to test it out considering we weren&#39;t getting a good vibe. The selection was so limited compared to other locations. Glad we did before we ordered anything else! The apples were brown.. vegetables were not fresh at all... ALL of the bread was literally stale. It was sooooo hot in there especially with the burners going we were sweating! We got the check and left... lunch and atmosphere is way better @ Hooters!  Very disappointing!

I&#39;ve been to a couple different locations but this one is my absolute favorite! I would say I&#39;ve been here at least 20 times and I&#39;ve never had a bad experience. The wait staff and hosts are always very friendly and inviting. The food is always amazing! I try a different cheese fondue everytime I come in but my favorite would have to be the loaded potato cheese mostly because the green goddess dip is to die for! Every time I have been in here our server has gone above and beyond to make us feel special whether is was because of a birthday or just a little sisters day out. Last weekend I tried their new Oreo martini which was heaven in my mouth. I always recommend this place to all my friends if they are looking for a fun, unique way of dining!"

This is one of our favorite restaurants to go to on a special date night. Sometimes we just get cheese and dessert if we&#39;re not feeling up to paying for the 4 course meal. If you do just cheese and dessert, make sure you order the premium dippers for the cheese. And you can always ask for refills on any of the dessert dippers. 
Great service and beautiful ambiance.

The cheese fondue was delicious. We ordered the bacon and the Alpine. Everyone enjoyed the main entree. I&#39;m not a dessert person at all, but the chocolate brownie dipped in milk chocolate was &#34;to die for&#34;!
Service was a bit slow compared to the Melting Pot in Nashville, but our server was not the problem. She was doing her best for how many tables she had and being a server at this place is hard work I&#39;m sure!

The duck breast was my favorite, but the ahi and shrimp were also great.  Not sure why the shrimp tasted so much better on this visit, but it did.

I would think a restaurant, who the whole point is to make a memorable experience every time, would not let a situation like that occur repeatedly.  According to the staff it is always hot up there.

Then, we surprisingly found that they charged for my kids&#39; entree, cheese, and drink.

I complained to a manager, and the manager took off the charges for my kids&#39; entree and cheese. That is fine. 

Honestly I suspect that if a customer does not seem to know about Sunday Special, they just charge the full price. If what I suspect is true, they are doing their business in a very cheap and dirty way. We were not very happy about the evening."

We had a reservation and showed up on time, but we ended up waiting at least an hour for our table! We were lucky enough to find the last 2 open seats at the bar to wait. I found out all the people at the bar were also waiting for their reserved tables. Waiting an hour for a reserved table is totally unacceptable, but they didn&#39;t tell us it would be such a long wait, and we figured anywhere else decent would already be booked for Valentines so we stayed. They didn&#39;t compensate us in anyway for waiting. They should have at least bought us each a cocktail or something...
They serve a set menu which offered only a few foods that i wanted. Quite limited in my opinion. It was definitely not worth the money! I&#39;m pretty sure it was just a sampling of their basic stuff marked up for Valentines. I was under the impression that it was a special in addition to the regular menu selections, but that was not the case. None of the regular menu was available accept beverages. Very misleading. Not sure if they still have this special this year or if other locations are different, but we went here last year and we will never be back.
They service was average to good. Portions were on the smaller side. Food quality was good. Definitely not what you would expect for what you pay, especially since technically we cooked it all ourselves! Lol. My boyfriend and I thought fondue would be fun, and that part was, but overall we both agree it was not what we expected for the price and disappointing for the Valentine&#39;s day occasion."

Dinner at The Melting Pot takes time, and we were prepared for that, but our waitress had too many tables. I had to get my own place setting off another table, we had to flag her down for service, and we waited 45 minutes between our entree and dessert, which was a terrible way to end the evening.

I guess it took them a minute to look around and realize the place was almost empty to make an exception to the rule and seat us in the corner. The place was never close to busy while we were there.

My friend and I shared the chocolate and berries fondue. Server seemed less than friendly...maybe because we only got one dessert fondue for two people. She wasnt very helpful in heating up the chocolate and it took forever. I guess we turned the burner too high in our attempt to heat the chocolate so the fondue ended up curdling.

We went here on a date night tonight courtesy of Groupon. Melting Pot runs frequent Groupons, this one included a salad and entree for two people. The Groupon was &#34;valued&#34; at $67.98 and was purchased for $40. Almost a $30 savings, not bad. In the past they have had different deals, including cheese or dessert. I&#39;d recommend those since the best part of this place is the cheese or chocolate. 

The experience of going out for fondue is one of the fun parts. Our waitress stopped by and since we&#39;ve been there before, her shpeal was short. We decided to deviate from our Groupon and order cheese. Since we both like Swiss, we went with the Classic Alpine. I prefer this with the sides. I think you get a good amount of cheese per person. Not sure if it&#39;s worth the $7 pp, but you also get a basket of three types of breads as well as a bowl of apples, a few carrots, broccoli and cauliflower. 

Next we were able to choose a salad as part of the deal. They were nothing to write home about. We had the caprese and California. Of the two, I would recommend the California. After that, our entree came out. We were able to choose up to three items from the entrees. I went with the sirloin, filet and Memphis BBQ pork. I don&#39;t love pork so that was my first mistake. That one I gave up happily. There were two thin slices of the filet that were heavily seasoned. Lastly I enjoyed a few slices of the sirloin. You also get six tasty sauces to accompany your entree. In addition, a basket full of mushrooms, broccoli and potatoes come as a side. There was a decent amount of meat but without a groupon, I would definitely keep this as a special occasion.

To end, we decided to push the limits and end with some chocolate. I was disappointed to find out that they no longer serve cheesecake with their dessert. Instead they&#39;ve substituted pineapple and blondies. It came along with strawberries, bananas, marshmallows, Rice Krispies, pound cake and brownies. Now I obviously am biased because I love chocolate, but I don&#39;t think they give you enough chocolate in the pot. It was barely enough to cover all the sides we got and we were going pretty skimpy. 

Overall there are two reasons I would go here: a special occasion or a special deal. The cheese and chocolate are great but there&#39;s nothing special for the entree. Service was fantastic and the experience is a nice treat."

Don&#39;t go here for a quick bite to eat. Dinner took 3 hours &amp; they weren&#39;t busy at all. The food is good, small portions yes. But there are 4 courses in the meal. The real down fall in my opinion. You have plenty of time just sitting around. And while you do so, you start to notice things. Like the dirty floor  that clearly needed a good vacuuming. The more you look around while waiting to eat. You see more and more dirt around the restaurant. This is a close to $200 meal, not Bob&#39;s Burgers.

We arrived around 8pm and it was not busy. When we exited our vehicle, we could see staff at the hostess area. When we came in, no one was there anymore, and there was no one to greet us, no one in the bar area and we waited for about 5-7 minutes before anyone even came out.  There was a guy and a younger hostess. We were asked by the gentleman if we were celebrating anything and we told them we were celebrating a birthday. 
We were taken to a table by the hostess, who also had very little to say, and our server approached. He was not very friendly either and seemed not to be real excited about working. He had very little to say the entire experience, and it was never acknowledged that we were celebrating a birthday. 
When we had our chocolate fondue, after about 5 minutes, our server approached again and set the bill down, saying &#34;this is for later.&#34;  This reinforced the entire experience, which felt as if we were inconveniencing the staff by being there. From the time we arrived through leaving was entirely consistent and disappointing. 
This was the first time we had been to this restaurant, and it was not at all enjoyable or positive. The food was very good, but the experience was completely lacking, and given that this is a more expensive restaurant, I would not recommend this restaurant at all.

Now don&#39;t get me wrong: the food is good. Drinks are great. But what you&#39;re really paying for is TIME, since it&#39;s going to take at least two hours to dine here.

I&#39;ve been twice - both with either a gift card or Groupon. Happy for that. This will cost you a pretty penny.

The first time I went in the summer. We had the Sam Adams beer cheese dip to start, and it was delicious! I&#39;ll fast forward to dessert, which was a &#34;peanut butter and jelly&#34; dessert which was equally incredible. The second time, we had a fiesta cheese dip to start. If the appetizer &amp; dessert could be my trip alone, I&#39;d walk out happy. It&#39;s the entree that&#39;s the problem.

Again - food is good. Appetizer and dessert: awesome. Drinks? The cocktails are great and actually well-priced. But the entree...there&#39;s something about needing to clock watch (or watch a stopwatch on your phone) and cook your own food that just loses appeal to me. It wasn&#39;t relaxing, because you&#39;re concerned about over or under cooking. It wasn&#39;t bad, but it just isn&#39;t worth the hassle to me. All the sauces they offer are great pairings, but it doesn&#39;t make up for me having to pay a wad of cash to cook my own meal!

My advice - skip the entree and come here for appetizers &amp; dessert."

At minimum you will spend $30 a person....without an entree and just cheese fondue, chocalote fondue and a beer. 

As others have said this place is all about the experience over the food and the value. The staff is very nice and accomodating.

Where I lost them is with the menu. It literally took me 30 minutes and two beers to understand how to order after the waitress explained to me three times. It really shouldn&#39;t be that hard. 

The food is eh but for three courses you will leave hungry still. 12 pieces of meat for $20 that you cook yourself just didn&#39;t cut it for me.

Our server, Jimmy, was lots of fun and explained everything so we could understand how to order. The food was delicious and we were quite full when done. Our bill was $110 which was less than we expected.  It would have been less but I had a beer and my friend had a sangria. If you want to keep the price down, watch the cocktails. We will be back."

I was a fondue virgin until yesterday - our waitress Monique made this a trip worthwhile on its own, plus the food was to die for. We got the romance package for two, and had a fantastic private booth. Everything was spot on and I was so happy at the end of the night. What a great place!

I have gotten the chocolate fondue before and it was good but when I ordered the 4 course I barley ate it. I guess I just don&#39;t think it was worth to pay over 45$ to cook my own food that wasn&#39;t even good. And the choices werent that good. I got the vegetarian platter and I only ate like 3 things from there. But don&#39;t get me wrong the service is nice but the prices for what it&#39;s actually worth isn&#39;t worth it at all. I would only come there for a chocolate fondue.

Fondue has always been a great idea, but messy for home meals. But when the restaurant does the work, fondue is fabulous. They offer a romantic package that is well worth the $149 that includes a four course meal, rose petals on the table, a dozen red roses (that you keep), bottle of wine, and box of chocolate covered strawberries to bring home. A private cozy booth and lots of time to enjoy the evening. The food was great, steak, shrimp, chicken and veggies, plus salad, snacks and dessert."

Unfortunately I won&#39;t since my last visit in May was disheartening.  Reflecting over the years, I realize now I gave this place more credit than it deserves.  There have been many problems and service failures that I just brushed off.  But cumulatively, they are hard to overlook.

Notice the mediocre rating on Yelp.  One would think that they would ask for some guidance from customers on how to better themselves. But in my experience, Melting Pot has never been interested in customer feedback. I have offered both positive and negative feedback in the past (constructive) to corporate and they never even bothered to acknowledge it."

Once you put the meat/seafood in the hot oil, it all tastes the same.  Not very tasty at all.  However, the cheese is good!  The desert is good too, but save your money and skip the main dinner entree&#39;s, they aren&#39;t good.  
8 bucks a person for cheese and the same for chocolate - expensive, but definitely don&#39;t buy the main dinners!

I was there on Memorial Day (Monday, May 28) for the ladies night and went with my 2 teenage step-daughters and my friend and her teenage daughter.  We had mediocre service that night.  Our server&#39;s name was Carlos and he was very chatty.

We went right when they opened (5pm) so it was not busy at all.  I believe I heard Carlos say he was also bartending that night so he may have been pulling double duty.  At any rate, we all ordered the ladies night special ($18.99 per person for a 3-course meal -- cheese, salad, and chocolate) and we all drank water.  I kind of felt like he wasn&#39;t as attentive because we weren&#39;t paying extra for drinks.  I had to ask repeatedly for water refills and each refill he had to be reminded TWICE. 

The cheese pots were nice and full, but when the chocolate course came they were filled less than halfway.  When asked, Carlos claimed &#34;each pot is for 2 people&#34;.  But we had a total of 5 people and 2 pots?!??  Also, we got 2 plates of desserts for 5 people.  Last time I came (with 5 friends on ladies night in March), we got 4 plates of desserts for 6 people!  We felt gypped and he did not offer to make it right by us.  Not impressed with that.  Of course, there was a lot of liquor on our bill when we went in March... lending further credence to my theory that service and portions were mediocre because we weren&#39;t paying extra for drinks.

I&#39;m giving 3 stars based on past experiences with much better servers.  The bread is usually on the hard side, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s because it dips better that way.  Veggies are fresh and crisp.  Apples were slightly brown this time but usually are excellent.

We had the Traditional Swiss Cheese Fondue (my absolute favorite!!) and the Boston Lager Cheddar Cheese Fondue from the Big Night Out menu.  For chocolate we went with 2 pots of The Original.  The taste was fabulous as always."

My favorite is the cheese fondue..Alpine? The California Salad is to die for and the dressing is delicious. They are quite generous with their serving size. Plenty of options for entrees.  They all come with so many condiments for dipping and I don&#39;t use condiments. I&#39;m ok with that as I eat my food rather bland unless I can season it prior to cooking. We tried the Yin-Yang chocolate dessert and I&#39;m not a fan of white chocolate but when it&#39;s mixed together it&#39;s a delicious combination and I like trying new things when I go out to eat.  I loved it. But all in all  I could just go for the cheese and chocolate. Go if you have lots of time and money. I love spending time with my husband here. We had a great waitress Jackie J. who was informative, gave us plenty of space, but not too much space in between meals and didn&#39;t forget about us. The Sea Glass Wine was also very nice. Crispy, no aftertaste, light and airy. This experience was much better than my first. We&#39;ll come come back again."
the-melting-pot-naperville,Anastasia Y.,CFZaOTdhqXgrbtqx5vCIIg,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,6,3,VcmvtcIEXZWq5EKmxkacNA,1.0,2013-09-20,"Pros:  You get to eat.
Cons:  Everything else.

First of all, my Livingsocial app wasn&#39;t working for some reason (WTH??!!) which made me semi-frantic come bill time, but luckily I had saved my confirmation email for this place or it would have cost me a FORTUNE!! 

That being said, I will NOT be returning to this restaurant.  I LOVE fondue (it&#39;s cheese, meat &amp; chocolate...duh!) but this place was RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE!!!  Even with the Livingsocial coupon I had, it cost me about $60 and that was for me and my 9 year old kid!!

The coupon was for &#34;Dinner for Two&#34; which included a cheese fondue (choice of) appetizer, a salad (choice of) and an entrée (pre-chosen).
I had ONE (granted it was 8 oz) glass of wine (come on, I was with my kid) for $11.
My daughter&#39;s ice tea was $3.50.
So there&#39;s $15.00 so far, right there.
The cheese fondue was just ok.  We selected the cheddar.  It was pretty basic but descent enough.
The salad was VERY good.  We ordered the spinach salad with warm balsamic dressing (I would have liked some bacon in it, but that&#39;s fine).  OK so far.

For the entrée, the coupon I bought included the meats (chicken pieces, tenderloin pcs, a small *maybe 4 oz* cut up lobster tail, 6 shrimp and a few teriyaki style steak pcs) but the broth to cook it in is YOUR CHOICE.  We were steered away from the basic &#34;vegetable broth&#34; which I was going to choose because I was with my young daughter, but our (WAY too fast talking) server, Dan, discouraged that and another one of the four broths we had to choose from for various reasons that sounded valid, he also discouraged.  He &#34;highly recommended&#34; the Mojo broth (garlicky/citrus) which we ended up choosing but not really liking...it was just ok.
That was all supposedly &#34;included&#34;.  

Then, my daughter wanted dessert (of course).  I did not want it because I was pretty damn full from eating most of everything else that she didn&#39;t like.  So, I asked our server if the desserts come &#34;individually&#34; or is it a huge pot of chocolate.  He said, &#34;Oh, no.  Everything is individual.&#34;  
Great.  &#34;She will have the S&#39;mores chocolate dessert fondue then.&#34;
Well....a HUGE pot and large tray full of dessert dunkables came to the table and I thought, wow...that&#39;s a lot for one.
Of course I ate what she didn&#39;t want and it was ok but I really didn&#39;t want it but I also didn&#39;t want to waste it.  I&#39;m really NOT a fan of chocolate OR marshmallows.  meh.

Then the bill came.....

OMG!  MY portion was almost $50!  That&#39;s WITH the coupon and without tip.  *WOW*

The itemized bill showed the $11 wine, $3.50 tea, $4.99 for the &#34;Mojo&#34; liquid (I thought that was INCLUDED--he didn&#39;t say it wasn&#39;t and &#34;recommended it highly&#34;...no sh**! Now I know why) and $15.98 for &#34;TWO Choc.S&#39;mores for 1&#34; plus tax, etc.  I was wondering why the dessert was so big...it&#39;s because it was a double order.
NO, I didn&#39;t say anything because what are they going to do?  Take $12 off my bill?  That&#39;s ok.  I&#39;ll pay it and never return.  My own fondue is much better anyway, esp. for $50!  
I honestly don&#39;t know why anyone would go there.  

Another thing is this.  When you get a tray full of FIVE different meats that all cook at different times, it would be helpful to have a card on the table that indicates the time necessary to cook each to different types of doneness.  
Our server talked so fast I couldn&#39;t keep track of each time.  Two minutes for this, one and a half minutes for that unless you want it medium rare then only cook it this long, the shrimp need to cook at blah, blah, blah....  SERIOUSLY??  Give me a card with that info on it.  GAWD!  ...plus, I&#39;m with a kid.  We ended up playing a game to cook it and it was fun, but it&#39;s a lot to keep track of in any case...and I know my way well around a kitchen.

In addition to the sheer ridiculous price of everything...you have to COOK YOUR OWN DINNER.  

Here&#39;s an idea:  Buy a fondue pot ($30); some cheese ($10) some beef broth (or oil), bread and meat and cook it at home.  It&#39;s fun.  You can have dinner for four for about $60 and that&#39;s if you throw away the pot afterwords. (= no mess)

The ONLY advantages to coming here are that I didn&#39;t have to clean up and my daughter had fun, which makes it all worth it to me.    

Hope this helps..."

First we made a reservation for 9pm. We got there at 8:45pm and wasn&#39;t seated until 9:30pm. We were finally seated and we ordered our food. Throughout the entire night we had five random waiters attend to us. 

At the end, our original waiter never came back. It took us twenty minutes to receive our bill after my boyfriend asked the hostess. They overcharged our bill and when we told them about this, their response was &#34;you&#39;re going to have to wait a couple minutes then if that&#39;s what you want.&#34; 

Please avoid the hassle. You&#39;re better off spending your money at another high end restaurant with a respectable staff."

A complete meal is pricey on its own but he did get the ultimate romance package, which he felt embarrassed calling it that and thought it could use a less cheesy name.   We were seated in a semi private section that sits above the restaurant and our table was covered in rose petals, a birthday and anniversary card, a box of chocolate covered strawberries (delicious), and a vase with a beautiful dozen roses, which I got to take home.   Everything was beautifully arranged.  We did hit a slight problem in that whoever set up the table did not put water in the pot, so after the hostess turned it on and left it almost smoked us out of our seat.  This incident highlighted the only problem sitting up where we were and it&#39;s that you can&#39;t easily get a waiter or staff members&#39; attention.   Luckily the waiter came shortly after it started smoking badly and fixed it.  Our waiter was very polite and helpful in picking out a good wine, and he check on us often.

The appetizers were simply amazing as was the desserts, and I would go back in a heartbeat for an appetizer/dessert night.  The actually dinner, unfortunately, left a lot to be desired.  I do not mean the food was terrible but for the price it was just ok.  I could not taste any of the seasonings on the meat; however, I did enjoy all the different sauces they had to accompany the meat.  With our dinner we had a bottle of moscato, which was delicious, and not too badly priced.  With dessert we had each had a glass of champagne that came with our package, which I did not like it because it was way too dry for me personally. I understand not having a sweet champagne since you are eating sweet desserts, but I just don&#39;t care for brute champagne.  

The other issue we ran into was that they kept calling us husband and wife even though in making the reservation my boyfriend clearly said girlfriend, and he even spoke to them on two different occasions before the dinner.  We just ran with it and pretended to be married especially because they had it posted on their two announcement boards in the lobby and doorway.

Overall, we had a romantic evening minus the burning fondue pot and bland dinner. The wine, appetizers, dessert, and beautifully decorated table made the big bill afterwards worth it. This is a place I would like to go to again but not for a full course meal. I would only go back for an appetizer and dessert special.  I felt that those were the only items that are worth the price."

My boyfriend and I have driven passed it several times but, never actually stopped to go in..until tonight.  It was 8:20 pm we called around 8 to see when they were opened till.  I was delighted to hear that they were open till 10 pm!   We walked into the restaurant to an empty hostess station.  After waiting about 5 minutes a woman finally appeared and asked us if it was just going to be the two of us.  She then told us to wait until they cleared off a table.  5 minutes later she appears to walk us to our table.  On the way to the table we passed 6 tables that were clean.  We got seated in the back by the kitchen in a not very busy dining room.  When our server showed up literally 2 seconds after we were seated he asked us what we wanted to drink.  When we asked for a minute he very rudely said he would be back &#34;eventually&#34; to take our order.   He came back 10 minutes later, we ordered our drinks and then he asked if we were ready to order.  When we said that it was our first time and we had a couple of questions he very rudely started just pointing at things on the menu explaining them at warped speed.  Slammed the pot down on the table and told us not to touch it because it was hot.  He then asked if we were ready YET or did he have to wait and come back again after doing a couple of laps.  Everything in Joseph&#39;s demeanor showed that he didn&#39;t care for us to be there.   Let&#39;s face it, we were ready to drop about $200 for dinner, we shouldn&#39;t be treated like we are a bother the whole time.   By the time we got our drinks, we decided that we didn&#39;t want to give them our money based on how rushed and unwanted we felt. 

When we asked for the check for our drinks and that we were going to be on our way he walked away while my boyfriend was mid sentence came back and slammed the bill on the table.  On our way out my boyfriend kindly asked to speak to the manager.  When he explained to him what had happened the manager didn&#39;t even issue an apology.  He simply just handed a card and said dinner was on him if we chose to dine there again.  Honestly, we just wanted him to be aware of what was going on in his restaurant.  We declined.  Honestly, I will never set foot in there again.   I will be going to Geja&#39;s in the city where they treat you like they want your business not somewhere where they treat you like a bother when you are ready to drop some serious money."

We were so excited to try this place but what a disappointment.  Way too expensive for what it is.  We had a $100.00 bill for what maybe added up to ten dollars worth of actual food (and that is being generous).  The cheese fondue was the best part of the meal, but nothing I could not make a home.  The entrées are a joke.  The meat was inedible and hard to control cook times.  Would be nice to have a time card/timer for cooking.  Dessert was ok.  Have the flaming turtle.  I expected to have some awesome chocolaty dessert,  but what we got was a pan with some heated up Hershey chocolate syrup. Such a bummer, was hoping this place would be good.

I planned ahead and made our reservations, then kept him guessing til we were almost there. 

We&#39;d both been to Melting Pots before (2 locations in TX for me, the Downers Grove location for him), but this one was pretty new and quite nice. I had looked at their menu ahead and thought that the &#34;limited time&#34; Pacific Island Big Night Out theme meal night be fun; all the courses go along an islandy theme. 

The cheese course of a horseradishy havarti blended with sake rather than the usual white wine was delicious and paired well with the usual suspects of bread, apples, and raw veggie dippers. 

The &#34;lettuce wrap&#34; salad was a little less successful in my mind: the blend of veggies and roasted almonds with sesame-ginger dressing was tasty (if a bit sweet), but the type of lettuce (green leaf I think) they used couldn&#39;t hold up to all the ingredients; they needed to use a crisper, heartier leaf, like Boston or even iceberg lettuce cups. I just ended up eating the filling out and leaving the lettuce behind because this was too hard to handle; my boyfriend had some more success than I did making actual wraps. 

The main course was great: a choice of three different arrays of proteins to be cooked in the boiling broth, all at the same price. We chose the &#34;Fondue Fusion,&#34; consisting of Lobster Tail, Sesame Crusted Teriyaki Sirloin, Citrus Infused Pork Tenderloin, Ahi Tuna, Garlic Chili Chicken Breast, Kiwi Lime Shrimp, Spring Vegetable Dumplings (which were more like ravioli), and Fresh Vegetables. We also upgraded our broth to the Mojo style, which has Caribbean flavors infused into it. 

The various sauces then are fun to play with: the sriracha aioli went well with so many things, the blue cheese sauce was good with the potatoes, the classic Green Goddess sauce was a good pair with the chicken and the mushrooms, the teriyaki sauce was a nice match for the sirloin, and so on.

Bringing up the rear was the chocolate course; I have usually gotten their signature yin-yang swirled chocolate fondue when here, but to add island flair the white chocolate side was infused with passion fruit syrup. This was accompanied with an array of overly decadent snackies, the best of which were the pound cake squares and the strawberries (I mean, brownies dipped in chocolate is just too much! The graham cracker and chocolate-crusted marshmallows were rather clever though). 

The seating was nice, a small room tucked off a larger aisle; other locations I&#39;ve been in have not had as much privacy. The young man said that this location was a lot nicer than the one in DG, which had been around a while and was consequently starting to look a little dumpy. 

Our waitress was bubbly and generally efficient, though occasionally a little overly familiar (for example, when we said we wanted to order the Mojo cooking style, we noted that we didn&#39;t know if it was pronounced &#34;Mo-Jo&#34; or &#34;Mo-Ho&#34;. She said, &#34;Oh, not like Austin Powers! Yeah, shag me, baby!&#34; Yikes...)

Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable special occasion experience."

The food was small potions of not so fresh meat and seafood. Our waitress was very nice and did a good job!! When I asked to see a manger, he didn&#39;t make it to our table until I had to ask a second time. He seemed annoyed once he got to our table! The seafood was fishy and seemed old. When I asked him about it, he rolled his eyes with disgust. We decided to pay our $225 bill and never to come back! What a waste of $$$$"

Decor is nice but all the booths are so scrunched...they really tried to utilize as much space as possible...Im pretty skinny and I don&#39;t know how bigger people would even be comfortable with the small booths. Also too much waiting in between appetizer and entree and dessert. Let me ask you...why would anyone come back to pay $35 per person just to cook your own food in a pot and have it come out so bland?  You definitely need the sauces!  All 5 of us had from seafood to chicken to steak and we all thought it was so bland. I guess in that respect its good they only give small portions. Plus we ordered one more vegetable dish and the waitress Lauren forgot. Finally something to talk positive about...the dessert fondue was good and tasty but then again what doesn&#39;t taste good with chocolate? I totally agree with the one other reviewer...should call it Fon Dont. Definitely not worth the money and unless I get amnesia, we won&#39;t come back. Was thinking of giving it 1 star but the dessert made it ok to put 2 stars."

Melting Pot is my wife&#39;s favorite so we go when it is her turn to pick a spot, or for her birthday whatever.

We&#39;ve been going the better part of 12 years.  IMO the quality has been trending down ever since. 

for $100 to $150 per couple I can think of so many other spots to hit with higher quality food and beverages.  Needless to say I&#39;ll only be going when the wife says I have to."

Our waitress was very nice about it all but honestly, that was a real turn-off.  I made the best of it since my friend seemed to be having a nice time but could only imagine what the kitchen looked like if the public part was that bad.

Made our reservation online and asked for a private booth - because I was used to the Oak Brook location (that&#39;s now closed?) where a private table meant you felt like you were in your own little private room with curtains, closed off from the world. Here, the private table is adjacent to the bar and next to a glass window wall facing the parking lot and Route 59 - not exactly private. But at least we could watch football in the tv&#39;s reflection on the window. And hey, they tried.

People always talk about how expensive Melting Pot is, but not if you do it smart. We get the cheese and a small chocolate, drink water, and it&#39;s around $30 bucks, less than we&#39;d probably spend somewhere like Fridays or Chilis. And much more fun and romantic!

My favorite dipper for the cheese is apples - yes, apples and cheese are somehow phenomenal together! Sadly, the first batch of apple bits brought out were brown, so the waiter had some fresh ones cut up for us. YUM! 

We got the original chocolate fondue with chunky peanut butter. I want more now!!! I could probably eat here everyday. The dippers included cheesecake, pound cake... and other things that just aren&#39;t as important as cheesecake and poundcake :)"

We made reservations for 8:30, but got there around 8:00 and were sat right away.  We started with the featured Sam Adams fondue.  You are given small cups of a variety of bread cubes, cauliflour, broccoli and apples for dipping. Our friends got the swiss fondue.  He accidently put a big to much nutmeg in the Swiss, but it was still good. Accidents happen, no big deal.

After the fondue (the Sam Adams cheese is amazing by the way - I would highly recommend!) you get a salad.  I got a wedge salad, which delighted me. I love the crunchy part of the lettuce that you can eat like an apple, but that&#39;s beside the point. Wasn&#39;t the best salad I&#39;d ever had, but obviously this is a fondue featured restaurant, not a salad bar. You are kind of dumb if you go there just to get a salad. Seriously.

For the entree we got the Fondue Fusion which was strips of steasoned steak, bbq pork, shrimp, buffalo chicken, lobster tail and mushroom stuffed pasta (I don&#39;t like cooked mushrooms normally, but these were good).  You also get new cups of vegetables with your meal.

My fiance and I got the pot of broth for cooking, and our friends got the oil.  I have always had a fear of raw meat, so I was pretty skeptical on the &#39;cook your own dish&#39; scenerio, but you get the hang of it after a few minutes. In fact, when he set the plate down I had a secret panic attack and kind of felt like running away -- but the food was great.  I loved the chicken and shrimp. You also get two different kinds of batter for your meats. It&#39;s fun to experiment, and you can&#39;t really mess anything up. Everything pretty much goes good with everything. If you&#39;re a worrier like me and can&#39;t even touch ground beef to make hamburgers in the summer, then just leave the food in longer. Better to be a little overdone then underdone right? Plus my worrying made my friends laugh, so everyone wins right?

They also give you 8 different sauces to work with. I loved the greek goddess sauce. I even ventured into my wild side and spooned a little bit of the bleu cheese sauce onto my steak.  

For our chocolate, we got the PB&amp;J. Probably the best thing ever. Strawberries and bananas in a PB&amp;J chocolate? (Homer drool).

Overall, the food was good, our waiter was very nice, and I had a great time. It&#39;s a bit pricy, but thankfully, we live too far away to go all the time;-)  So basically, if you have no personality, no sense of humor and hate life, I would not suggest going, because it&#39;s a great time! :D"

We arrived at 8pm our reservation was at 8:15 didn&#39;t get sat until 9:45. Waited at the bar while the bartenders looked like they didn&#39;t want to be there. It was Valentines Day. Seriously worst Valentines Day ever. No one told us the menu was going to be different. No one came to apologize for the long wait. When we finally got sat we had a really nice down to earth server. Best part of being there. One of the bus boys came to our table, while cleaning it, he asked us who our server was. We told him we didn&#39;t get her name. He proceeded to ask us if she was chunky as he raised his hands. Very awkward and offensive."

My first visit to The Melting Pot was on probably one of their busiest nights, Valentine&#39;s Day, and our experience couldn&#39;t have been better (except for the rude customers near us, who were treated very well by management when they really deserved a slap in the face).
The waitress came right away, Andy (Andi?), and was super friendly, helpful, and attentive throughout the entire experience. I use the word experience carefully; this is a unique dinner that is fun to do! The Valentine&#39;s Day menu was preset, but we could choose between two cheese and two chocolates for the first and last courses. This could seem limiting, but really think about it: the restaurant will be full, there will be lots of orders, and your food will come out a lot quicker if the staff doesn&#39;t have to order and prepare a million different options. And for us, less choices really helped us to follow the Melting Pot process.
The food was phenomenal: Fresh, plentiful, and varied. We really got a kick out of watching Andy prepare our fondues, and then watch raw meats magically come out of the pot (after only a few minutes!) fully cooked and delicious. My boyfriend, a picky eater, found food he enjoyed and genuinely enjoyed preparing it for himself! The dark chocolate fondue for dessert had hints of salted caramel in it and it was essentially perfection. 
The bottom line here is that I not only was amazed with the service and quality of the food, but especially on a holiday our evening went flawlessly - except for, like I mentioned, a VERY rude woman across from us. I won&#39;t divulge the details, but as a server elsewhere myself, I got fired up and nearly jumped in to call her out as the staff couldn&#39;t for the sake of professionally. 
Thank you, Melting Pot, Andy, and Jeff (the manager), for a wonderful first experience at your restaurant and for a lovely Valentine&#39;s Day dinner.
I hope you enjoyed the truffles :)

PS: Cant wait to come back and try your established menu!!"

I know it&#39;s a chain, but they do what they do well. The decor is nice and intimate. I think a slight flaw in their design is that with only one burner at a table, you have to decide whether you&#39;re doing cheese fondue or oil cooking. At least, you can only do one at a time. If you order several courses you can do whatever you like, but just be prepared to be here a while. It&#39;s ok though, because the place is relaxing and the service is excellent.

I would say going with a cheese fondue would be the best bet if it&#39;s your first time here. You can&#39;t go wrong with your selection. It won&#39;t be a case of whether you chose well or poorly, rather which one you liked the best (assuming you get around to trying them all).

Whatever you do, make sure to leave room for dessert. Unless, for some reason, you don&#39;t like chocolate (in which case stop reading my review. I don&#39;t like you.)

I would say the real rating is a little closer to 3.5-stars, simply because the prices are a bit steep. It&#39;s definitely a once in a while place to visit."

But there are a few shortcomings. Here&#39;s the positives: the cheese fondue? AMAZING. The chocolate fondue? INCREDIBLE. The martinis (especially the chocolate one)? Awesome, if a bit over priced. The service? Fantastic and attentive. The entree? Skip. No, seriously, skip.

This is the type of restaurant to go for cheese and chocolate, maybe a drink or two. Problems with the entrees: 1. too pricey for the amount of food/caliber of food received and 2. impractical. Basically, you&#39;re allotted a fondue pot of, for lack of a better term, broth (now, it&#39;s not just broth, so don&#39;t get all picky on me--it&#39;s a liquid in which you are able to &#34;cook&#34; your food). Here&#39;s my first gripe: it takes a looooooong time to soften up a veggie or two in the pot. In addition, I am a vegetarian and my husband is not but we still had to cook in the same pot. I would&#39;ve had to have cooked all my food prior to his, and pretty much either eaten while he was cooking or eaten cold food. Next time we go, it&#39;s straight up drinks, cheese, and chocolate. Excellent staff--both for reservations and service. Beautiful restaurant. Recommended, sans the entree. But oh, words fail on me the deliciousness that is their cheese and chocolate... :)"

I guess they figured they didn&#39;t have to worry about a couple of old ladies reviewing them on-line. WRONG!! My 91 year old mom and her friend decided they would like to try some fondue after seeing a movie. They hadn&#39;t been to the Melting Pot and arrived there at a little after 4:00PM. They walked in and the &#34;hostess&#34; said &#34;What do you want&#34;? Nice and welcoming, right? They said we would like to eat. They were told the restaurant was all booked. My mom told me the place was fairly deserted with a few people at the bar, but several free tables visible in the bar. The &#34;hostess&#34; said &#34; We are always busy on Saturdays and besides, they are being picky today&#34;. They are being PICKY today????? What the hell does that mean? Are old ladies not &#34;cool&#34; enough to get in? Needless to say they went elsewhere to eat. When my mom told this story I was dumbfounded.

We were trying to not order more than we&#39;d eat, and I was looking to not have my friend pay both arms and legs for the meal, so we opted to skip the cheese/appetizer course.  I thought it odd that the waitress suggested we actually skip the entree and go for the cheese app, but what do I know.  1 star lost for the fact that this place is so darn expensive and the service, while good, didn&#39;t blow me away.

I say this because we sat down at 6:30pm and left after our four courses at 10pm, but it was fun and definitely worth it. We read the menu ahead of time and were a little confused at how it worked, but our waiter (Mike P.) did a great job and clarifying and made us feel comfortable with the selection. We started with the Swiss cheese fondue and the Fiesta fondue, both were good but the Fiesta fondue was really delicious. Next we all had a salad, and its salad you can&#39;t really mess it up. For the entire course everyone in the party ordered something different, but all agreed to cook it in the court bouillon and not the oil. 
If I were to go back as a date though, I would most likely skip this entree course because all four courses is really a lot of food, and I would be fine with the cheese fondue, salad, and the chocolate fondue. 
OK- speaking of the chocolate fondue. wow. holy cow. It&#39;s so amazing! I want to go back and try every single option. We had the dark chocolate fondue and the flaming turtle. If you are going to impress someone i strongly suggest getting the flaming turtle, the waiter mixes everything in and then lights the Bacardi on fire and pours it in and it really is such a cool presentation. They serve the chocolate with marshmallows, cheesecake, pound cake, brownies, bananas, and strawberries and everything is so delicious. I would also suggest going and sitting at the bar and just getting the chocolate fondue as a good date night activity. 
This is definitely a good place to try, its good entertainment with your meal and the ambiance is fun and relaxed."

What?! A $150 night out for two and we can&#39;t top our dessert off without leaving wired???!!!  That&#39;s ridiculous.

We sat at the bar while our table was being prepared - the bartender was absolutely wonderful and very attentive...but that&#39;s where the good part ends

We were seated promptly....but did our server come by promptly? Uh no. In fact he complained to us about getting double sat (which I know sucks...but really? Where is your professionalism?) 

It went downhill from there. Our server was either on crack or on lots of crack. He was distracted, stuttering, couldn&#39;t explain a thing, confused, rushed, and basically was the WORST server I have ever come across. But if you&#39;re lucky enough to get a server who does not dabble in illegal substances then here&#39;s some info on the food. 

---Cheese Fondue - excellent! You might need more bread though. 

---Salads - they were decent...but it&#39;s not something I would want to spend my money on or order again (unless it&#39;s free) 

---Entree - psh. please please please do not order. I go out to have food served and cooked the way I like it. This was a nightmare. You have to time your food so you don&#39;t get salmonella, god forbid you forget about what is on what stick because then you will have rubber. The cooking styles are a pain in the butt and it is just not fun. Too much stress to actually enjoy a thing. 

---Dessert - you must go for this alone - it is amazing.

Reservation was for 7pm and did not finish until 9:55pm...in other words, s-l-o-w!  Ordered two 3-courses (cheese, salad, and entree)...server (Earl) brought 2 bowls of cheese (Chedder, and swiss) to make the cheese fondue but didn&#39;t even empty the bowls to make the cheese fondues and brought half a bowl of bread for 5 people!..house salad was good...entrees were fine...and small size chocolate dessert was surprisingly good. Over priced for what I was getting..."

We had a reservation and it took a half hour to be seated. The bar is tiny, but while we were grumbling a bit about the wait the bartender gave us a free sample of one of their martinis that was delicious! After we were sat, it took almost twenty minutes before any wait staff came by to offer even water.  We were told by the manager that our waiter was delayed because of splitting up checks for a large party. When our waiter arrived he couldn&#39;t have been nicer. The appetizer course &amp; salads were excellent. They allow you to substitute almost anything. The entree was good, but we had to almost beg our waiter on how long to cook anything because he was so rushed. During our entree we were asked to order dessert repeatedly. When on our time, we finally ordered dessert it was good. To many things, like a brownie, when we just wanted more strawberries, and lose all the marshmellows and give me some apples and pineapple! Expensive place, needs better staffing as our waiter would disappear for a half hour at a time, but the pacing was great to spend time with friends. Fix the service on almost every level and I&#39;d love this place instead of not feeling it was a bit overpriced."

My hubby took me for our 14th anniversary and I must say it was a good choice. I would go again. The cheese fondue was great . The entree was good also. (  I have to agree with the last reviewer  the entree is skimpy). The chocolate fondue was great . If you like fondue this is a great place to go.

I&#39;ve vistited other locations in Illinois and have been very happy. 4 of us went on Thursday for &#34;Ladies Night In&#34; and it was a disaster. We sat down ordered our drinks and she brought back 2 that were correct, it took 20 min&#39;s to get the other 2. Then she brought us napkins and silverware that wasn&#39;t rolled because she said the &#34;they go fast if I don&#39;t get dibs on them&#34; Okay?? We order our cheese and told us the bread was defrosting in the kitchen so we had to wait for that to finish. We finally get that and she never checked on us again.....I hate that!! It goes on and on but you get the idea. I gave this location 2 stars but loved the others which stinks cause this is the closest location to me."

It&#39;s a great place for special occasions--because it&#39;s pricey and can turn into quite a long event. I took my g/f here to celebrate Valentine&#39;s Day early (I&#39;ve been here on V Day and I don&#39;t like the predetermined menu and escalated prices) and we had a grand ol&#39; time. Our waitress was a little too talky, but she made sure we had everything we needed and the food was good. Our dinner stretched to 3.5 hours, so we were full and exhausted by the time we left.

I was looking for a nice outdoor place to eat &amp; thought of the newly renovated Riverwalk Cafe.  Sat down &amp; within a few minutes I notice bees all over the tables.  I was the only one that early afternoon sitting outside, everyone else was sitting indoor and I did wonder &#34;why on such a beautiful afternoon would you be eating inside&#34;? Well, the bees!  I had my dog with me and could not go inside the restaurant. 

Not sure why management would not place something around the areas to keep bees at bay.  Needless to say I left and ate somewhere else."

My wife and I have sampled all three meals, along with the soft serve ice cream and it is all delicious. The prices are very reasonable for a downtown location. Plus the view is the best there is for outdoor eating in downtown Naperville. The view of the paddle boats and the flowers and landscaping by Naperville Park District makes it a quiet and beautiful place to have a meal, a glass of wine, or just a dessert.

$8.00 for a tuna salad that was the size of a side salad at a restaurant.  An ice cream scoop size of tuna in the middle, a teaspoon size chopped tomatoes, 4 thin slices of avocado. Some cucumber slices and all served on a bed of iceberg lettuce!  Horrible- who came up with the prices and the menu!!! That salad should have cost $2.00. The other food we got was a breakfast burrito- processed egg and bacon. Disgusting-  don&#39;t waste your time or money there.  The only nice thing was the location that is why I gave it 1 star."

Most of the restaurant&#39;s at Oakbrook mall are traditional/nicer sit down places, and if I am by myself shopping I can just pull up a seat at their bar or a  small table here. The atmosphere is definitely above going to the subway on the other side of the mall, but not the type of atmosphere you really need to be dressed up for. The restaurant is located near the men&#39;s department, and one of the nordstrom entrances.  The calorie count is normally listed on the menu in case you are dieting, or just want to be informed about the calories. 

I mainly stick with their delicious sandwiches and salads, but I hear that their pasta is pretty good as well. I am in love with their cilantro salad dressing that they have because of how refreshing and flavorful it is. Even though I doubt I would come out of my way to visit this restaurant, I believe it is the perfect option for diners seeking a quality meal during a visit to Oakbrook mall."

I never even noticed this place when walking in thru Nordstrom. It actually looks like a fancy restaurant once you walk in. I was seated before my friend got there which was cool because most places give you dirty looks for taking up tables. My friend had a grilled chicken entree which was a big portion and she said was tasty. I saw a guy at another table with a pizza and it looked huge lol. I ordered soup and grilled cheese from the kids menu but the server failed to ask what juice I wanted so I had to bring it up to him. He was pretty attentive the whole time though. Menu is a bit limited but a lot of options sound good. I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to visit here but it was overall okay.

This is now a sit-down restaurant with full table service.  Thankfully, the kids&#39; grilled cheese, which I love, is still available on the new menu, and our waitress was more than happy to bring it to me, even now as a 25-year-old.  Despite initially being brought the wrong soup to accompany the sandwich, my food was good and the service was quick.  The rest of my party enjoyed their orders as well.

We were seated pretty quickly, which was a relief during the lunch rush.....in the holiday season....inside a mall! We started with munching on bread and olive oil, which is always appreciated! The server told us about the soup, which was touted as a bacon pea soup. Of course, being the carnivore that I am, I had to ask if it was more bacon or more pea. The server said more bacon, so I asked if we could have a taste. Our server promptly returned with two ramekins for tasting and enough spoons for the whole table. First look, it definitely looked more like a veggie or minestrone soup, but when I tasted it, I definitely got way more pea than bacon flavor. As we passed it around, some got more bacon flavor and some got more pea, but overall, the soup wasn&#39;t good on anyone&#39;s pallet :(

I was starving when we arrived, so I really felt like something hearty. I decided on the Turkey Club panini with a side of their sea salt frites. Although the Turkey Club was delish, it was very....white. White bread, white turkey, white cheddar, white aioli.....on a white plate....with white(ish) potato chips. Good thing I was hungry :P It could have used some greens or something a little fresher to give the sandiwch another dimension of flavor, but it was still hearty and tasty. The frites were ok....a little softer than what I would have preferred, but since I asked for an extra side of the aioli, it as ok.

For those who have come here when it was Nordstrom Cafe, they still end the meal with their infamous stick of chocolate minty goodness :) 

If your&#39;e coming out to Oakbrook, this is a great place to stop and have a relaxing lunch!"

There are times I came few days in a row because the food was so good. Must try Penne Bolognese and Tomato Basil Soup. Both are rich and flavorful.

Make sure you double check your food if you order take out. Wish they are more careful in packaging their food. It is very disappointing when you get home and find out one of your dish is missing. Also, ask for the bread if you want it for the soup or your entree (I believe some entrees came with bread too?), as they don&#39;t always pack it with the take out order. Other than that, food is great!"

On a Saturday I&#39;ve waited about 40 minutes for a table, but we went in last night (Tuesday) around 6pm and we were seated right away.

Our server was sweet and efficient. We started with bowls of their famous tomato soup. I always get a bowl and can never finish it so I really need to remember to get a cup in the future. We ordered extra crostinis because they are delicious; they always say they have to charge us extra for them but we put up with it because they&#39;re good. We also got the artichoke tempura, which is always very good and hits the spot. I also got the Cesar salad, always a good choice here. 

My brother always gets the turkey Panini with a bunch of changes to it and he always loves it. My mom got the steak sliders and said they were really good. 

Yes, it&#39;s sort of pricy for being a restaurant in a store, but for a trip every couple of months it&#39;s worth it."

However, I could not negate the fact that in my Mushroom Raviolis with Short Rib Ragù, had a few or couple tangle hairs in it.  The manager came over, was polite, and apologized.

They certainly were right on both counts, I placed my entree order and it was served just a few scant minutes later.  I had the Chicken Mozzarella Ciabatta sandwich and it was amazing - if I had to complain about anything with the sandwich was that it could have used more chicken in it.  But the flavor was great.  

What was just as delicious were the homemade potato chips.  I am not usually a potato chip fan but I eagerly cleaned my plate of them.  I almost asked if I could by some to go.  ;)"

I was seated very quickly and without any wait. 
I was seated at the back of the restaurant close to the kitchen but I never would have noticed an issue, I didn&#39;t think there was a lot of noise. The place is dimly lit, relaxing, and comfortable.
I got the tomato jam jar and I wasn&#39;t too sure what it was or if I&#39;d like it but let me tell you it was excellent! It has pesto and tomato and ricotta cheese I think, it was great!
For lunch I had the shrimp risotto with asparagus.it was creamy and crunchy and just excellent! Really flavorful and perfect. My only complaint is that I wanted more but it is a hefty portion with 7-8 giant shrimp in it.

I&#39;ll run down here to pick up lunch for my whole department frequently- and they never disappoint. If you&#39;re looking to find a seat at noon, it&#39;s going to be a long wait- this place is PACKED with mall shoppers. 

Carry out is easy and they are very good with dietary needs. I am allergic to anchovies, which is only an issue when I&#39;m craving a Caesar Salad (the dressing is chock-full of little fishies.) and I have to make a special request to (1.) have the dressing on the side and (2.) make it anything besides caesar dressing. That tends to confuse all eateries, even my regular haunts. Not so with Ruscello. 

It&#39;s a great place for a quick dinner with friends or even on you own. I&#39;m fully comfortable eating solo, but for those of you who aren&#39;t, this place will help you feel more at ease.  

Order like I do and get the Caesar Salad with Balsalmic Vinagrette and a glass of iced tea- it&#39;s delicious without being heavy. Snag the pre-meal olives, too!"

This place is so kid friendly!  That is always a plus for me.  They brought out water cups for the boys and raisins right away.  I ordered a 1/2 panini (turkey bacon) and a cup of chicken rice soup.  The panini was great!  I kind of wish I ordered a whole one.  The soup was good too.  I think next time I go here, I will try the tomato basil because it looked really good.  We will definitely go back here because the food was great.  We had two servers, one was in training and they were both terrific!"

They still have the favorites on the menu (tomato soup and the strawberry chicken salad!!) plus some great additions. Everything is affordable, delicious, and the service is always reliable and courteous. 
Ruscello is also great as take out - I often order food to pick up for business meetings in the area."

My husband and I went to shop the anniversary sale and grab a quick bite. We both decided we wanted pasta and the place wasn&#39;t too busy. I ordered the chicken artichoke in a lemon butter sauce and he got the gnocchi carbonara. His meal was ok. Mine was appalling. The dish looked like it was tossed with end of the day scraps, chicken was filled with grissel. The sauce was served with a cream and no hints of lemon. It was gross. When I was finally able to get the attention of my waitress, she commented how the changed from the breast meat to shredded. I didn&#39;t expect this at all. They did take my dish off our bill, but I think they need to revisit the Monday cook and quality. The manager didn&#39;t even come and apologize for the quality. Just went back to the bar to visit with someone. For how great the cafe has been, so disappointed in this experience."

I called in and spoke to manager ( Justin) and was told that he receives this kind of phone calls on daily basis because when you add your tip to credit card instead of adjusting your original transaction they run another transaction for you so basically they double charge you , I&#39;ve never heard about anything like this before in my life ! I was told he couldn&#39;t do anything about because their system is made like this . And they are working on the system but so far it is what it is ... My checking account got overdrawn because I had 10 other transaction coming in at the same time and this place decided they will double charge me ... How horrible is that ! I asked to talk to someone about this since manager can&#39;t help me and was ask to leave phone number so someone can call me ! Horrible experience ! Just because of this  I will never come back to this place , and I&#39;m strongly suggesting not to use your credit card at this place ! They should have sign to inform guests about this practice !"

I was not disappointed! Salmon Poke Bowl was amazing, the right amount of vinegar, sweet and fresh mango and cucumbers. And the salmon was great! 

The Brussel sprout salad was amazing! I&#39;m by a fan of Brussel sprouts, but this salad is a must try. I thinking the sprouts are roasted (?) so you get that crunchy texture. 

Will be coming back!"

The host was on the phone so we waited about 10 minutes. Finally he gets off and asks if we need a table for 3 and we say yes. He then tells us it&#39;s an hour wait, even though the restaurant is empty. He says those tables are for reservations. That&#39;s totally fine but he should have told us that right away instead of making us wait because by then, my mom had gone to park and was walking in the rain. It was very irritating. 

We went the next week for lunch and it was very good. Their lunch menu is different from their dinner menu though. Smaller and you can&#39;t get some of the dinner entrees. The sushi was good, rice was good. I just wish they would get more staff. I know it&#39;s probably a move to save money but our waitress had every table herself and was all over the place and I know the table next to us said something to her about it."

I was in downtown Plainfield for the car show, and Mora sits on the western end of the downtown area. This allows one to walk by Mora while taking in the car show. They have an outdoor seating area right on the sidewalk, and in their genius they have a quasi walk-up stand set up. It is the Chef grilling on the patio, and you can walk up and order. This is only kind of samples: Chicken or beef skewers, or a beef slider. They have names for them, but they are basically Korean style meats. For only $2, I figured I couldn&#39;t go wrong.  I tried the chicken, and it was very good. Served on a boat tray with spicy slaw.
Their little marketing idea worked, and I happened to be still down there during dinner time, so I decided to go give it a try.  I was very pleased.  Their dinner menu contains appetizers, small plates, and some dinner entrées.  I chose the pancit noodles and added a pork shoulder. It came out to the table promptly. It was presented well and taste great. 
The food was excellent, the service was excellent, and the facility was clean. I intend to return to try more of their menu items.  It may not be the cheapest place to eat in Plainfield, but the prices are not unreasonable. Two people will probably not get out the door for less than $30 if they are having cocktails.
Great addition to the downtown Plainfield area."

This restaurant is small place but unique from another restaurant in Downtown Plainfield. If you are looking something new... Mora is the place you MUST go!! 

They have an amazing appetizer, Crunchy Brussel Sprouts and kale salad, Honey shrimp tempura, Korean chicken wings and also Robata (grilled) they all good to start. 

Sushi, Sashimi and rolls they are great! I love Summer rolls this roll so tasty! You don&#39;t need soy sauce for this roll at all!! 

Mora is a good place to hangout. Family, friends, kids, co-worker, big group or small group. They have 2 area for seating, at the bar or dinning room. I came here so many times and definitely I still want to go back!"

It was all cooked so perfectly and came out extremely quick! They had a great alcohol selection, as well. Again, something for every one. It was priced decently too. Although it looks like it is more of an adult hangout, there were a number of families there too. They also had a great outdoor seating option too. Overall, wonderfulplace!"

This restaurant is located in the downtown area of Plainfield within stepping distance from a number of other really great places nearby so the competition is fierce.  There is parking in the lot next door between Mora and the Italian restaurant on the corner so that&#39;s very convenient.  I made our reservation about a week in advance from their website but never got a confirmation call or email that the date/time was ok.  I assumed it was and then did get a call a few hours before on the day of our reservation to confirm.     

The interior of the restaurant is beautiful and stylish with wonderful artwork on the walls and detailed woodwork throughout.  You walk in to an ample bar area and hostess desk and the dining room is just beyond that area.  It&#39;s a small space with several comfortable sized tables and backless chairs so they make the most of it.  The cocktail and food menu is full of variety.  I wasn&#39;t sure if the dishes were more like small plates or individual portions and it wasn&#39;t clear by reading the menu either.  I guess you could order either way.  The portions were generous enough to share and were filling if that alone was your entree.  

We started with cocktails - lots of options that consisted of interesting ingredients (like cinnamon syrup) and boutique liquors.  It took awhile for them to make our drinks so they came out one at a time - odd that a party of six would have to have their order parsed out like that but the server apologized and said they had only one bartender working.  The drinks were delicious and in most cases beautiful to look at too so definitely worth the wait. 

We ordered appetizers next - a few kale salads and miso soup and the corn..we were going to order a few orders of corn at first but then the server made it seem like there were enough pieces for our table in just one order so we went with her recommendation.  The order was actually one cob cut into about 5 small pieces and it was REALLY good so we should have ordered more.  The kale salad was outstanding as well.  So far drinks and apps were a hit but they must have only had one person in the kitchen too because our food order came out in dribs and drabs....two of our guests waited more than 10 minutes for their food to come out - the others were already finished eating.  

The main dishes were where Mora fell short in my opinion.  I ordered the Honey Tempura Shrimp which was tasty but barely room temp when it arrived.  The nuts tasted a bit stale to me too.   The others in our group had a few sushi rolls, a noodle dish and poke.  The sushi rolls were good but nothing spectacular.  All in all the food was ok.  I would absolutely recommend Mora for drinks and appetizers if you&#39;re in the area - the ambiance alone is worth the trip."

The sushi was good but a little pricey compared to other sushi places ($14 for 2 california rolls). The outdoor seating was comfortable. We did not haev cocktails as our neighbors had previously warned us they were $14 a drink and there are several places w/ in walking distance with better drink deals. My husband had a fried rice dish for lunch, we shared 2 california rolls and I had a miso soup. Our bill was about $35 (we did have soda with lunch)."

I&#39;d recommend making a reservation cause this place was hopping shortly after 6 PM!

I wish I would&#39;ve ordered a cocktail- they all looked amazing and the bartender seemed to be knowledgable.

I had the grilled salmon first- YUM! Grilled perfectly and the sauce was a great pairing. Also had the crunchy roll and spicy tuna roll which were pretty standard. I highly recommend the Poke- great flavors and the fish was very fresh.

Only concerns were the smallness of the tiger shrimp and the service did not seem to flow very well. That may have been due to us being up at the bar, I&#39;m not sure.

Overall, I think this adds something that was missing from downtown Plainfield. We&#39;ll be back!"

The sushi rolls, nigri and shasimi are all fantastic. We especially liked the dynamite roll and unagi nigri. You can tell the sushi chef takes pride in his work, not only does his plates taste good they look amazing. If you&#39;re not feel sushi, they have an array of tasty small plates We tried the Korean chicken wings yes chicken wings. They were heavenly, so light and crispy and the sauce ... so good we wanted more. 

Unlike a lot of sushi houses Mora offers craft beer from Japan! Goodbye Sapporo hello YO-HO. They also have an array of unique cocktails and other craft beers from local breweries. 

The staff was very warm and welcome right when you enter the door. Jordan was a delight and so full of energy! They have really found some great people here which is so refreshing for this area. 

If you&#39;re looking for a cool place and some exceptional sushi be sure to give Mora a try. It won&#39;t disappoint. It is small so you&#39;ll have to wait at peak hours, but no one said you have to eat at 7pm. 

Best of luck to Mora as they move forward."

The chicken is so good it&#39;ll make you angry because you didn&#39;t have it sooner; because that&#39;s what it&#39;s called, angry chicken. 
The sushi is so good it makes you feel as if you&#39;re swimming with fish and Ariel the mermaid is giving you a massage as you eat it. 
The music is lit too. They&#39;ll play music you&#39;ll want to sing in your car in your way home with a full stomach of bomb food.

Pros:
Excellent decor
Decent Spicy Hamachi sushi roll  ( 7/10)
Decent tea selection
Attentive server

Cons:
Decent tea but served in a glass so it doesn&#39;t stay warm very long.
Small apps, good idea but mediocre execution: 
Tried the corn app - (6/10) Nothing special, a little oily.
The chicken Yakatori app (5/10) would have been much better with a decent sauce to accompany the dish.
The Pancit noddles (7/10) which were almost immediately cold upon arrival at the table were a tad on the small portion size for 2 people.
A little on the pricey side for what you receive.

Final thoughts: Not really an Asian Fusion place, rather a sushi place with some random samplings of appetizers served as &#34;tapas&#34; style dishes to seem more upscale.  Not a bad idea for the Plainfield area.  This restaurant adds a little diversity to a boring landscape of run-of-the-mill restaurants.  Hopefully they adjust their menu and take constructive criticism to heart.  I will likely return to try Mora again in several months to see if there has been any improvement."

Started with the saketini which was very good.They have a very interesting list of craft cocktails. 
For dinner we started with the edamame, then moved on to sushi. Everything was amazingly fresh. You won&#39;t get &#34;fake&#34; crabmeat in any rolls.We had the escolar, spicy tuna roll, the samurai roll and the Mexican roll. All were excellent!
We ate at the bar. Service was very good, and the restaurant was packed for only being open a short time."
