Time of my visit: Lunch

Well, I was on the run and needed a place to grab a quick slice of pizza...  This place was on my way, so I figured, I would grab a slice from there...

I ordered a slice of pepperoni, the lady informed me that, it would be about 5 minutes, which led me to this question...  Why 5 minutes?!?!  I would imagine slices during lunch are popular items?!

I paid $4 and change, which is a bit high for a slice with no drink...  I took it to go, as I was in the rush.  I got to the car and started the consumption...  The cheese and the sauce tasted like one of those generic, frozen pizza from your grocery store...  Never thought I would be disappointed in a pizza...  Also, I don&#39;t know how they put pepperoni on, but all of it was concentrated closer to the back.  The dough was harden, a bit burned.

Very disappointing.  D+."

They serve pizzas both by the slice and by the pie--2 slices should suffice if you&#39;re dining alone. The best thing Evviva has to offer, however, is its homemade gelato. It comes in servings small enough for a light dessert or for a mid-day snack. Wheaton students get nice discount on certain days of the week when they present their IDs or Wheatie cards.

The dining area is a bit cramped, making it inconvenient for groups larger than about 4-5. people. It&#39;s a better location for a few friends or a last-minute date than, say, a family meal. With no outdoor seating, either, it&#39;s a bit hard to grab a seat What it lacks in seating, though, it makes up for with a relatively helpful staff.

Pizza aficionados, keep moving--you&#39;ll find better at most other Chicagoland pizzerias. Everyone else, Evviva is worth at least a few visits."

I&#39;ve yet to order my own pizza, and I most likely never will, because my Pizza Loyalty lies elsewhere. I&#39;m never really out and about for Pizza, so the slices aren&#39;t really an option either. My Dad (roommate as well) usually orders some variant of a sausage pizza with their traditional crust. It&#39;s not as thick as a double dough pie you would get at another pizza place, but it has more substance than your standard thin crust pie. It&#39;s obviously thicker than cracker crust, too. I&#39;ve only had one square of the pie, and it&#39;s just okay.

Personally, I&#39;ve had their Cobb salad on two occasions. It comes with their homemade vinagrette on the side (at least it has per my requests). It has grilled chicken, bacon, blue cheese, small tubey (don&#39;t know name) pasta, avocado, and hard boiled eggs. I really like it! I&#39;ve had it twice, and even with my special orders (No cheese on time; No bacon and cheese the other) it has been great and correct on both orders. It&#39;s 8 dollars, and although I could make it at home, I wasn&#39;t paying, so kudos to you Evviva! I should also add that the salad features tomatoes, which add a nice flavor as well.

They have free wi fi. This spot has been plagued, but it seems that this tenant has staying power. They have another location in Lisle. That place, as far as I know, it a larger/bar/restaurant type place. This location has a small area for sitdown, and features pizza, pasta, some entrees, and even gelato! Probably a 3.5 star, but nothing says wow, hence the 3."

This is something I think people in the suburbs take for granted: solid pizza! In central Illinois where I live...this stuff is hard to find. Pizza Hut and Monical&#39;s don&#39;t do it for me!

Anyways, I tried a few slices of sausage and my mom&#39;s special order (Evviva Choice).

It tasted so generic. Solid sauce, not enough cheese for my liking, and the crust being chewy and not crunchy. Would I order ever? Probably not due to Gianorio&#39;s and Lou Malnati&#39;s being in the area!

My dad loves this place because of their coupons. The mural on the side of the building is quite awesome! I recommend the mural, not the pizza!"

I went for dinner and ordered a slice of pizza (which was $4.75 for one slice!) and onion rings. That with a drink came to $14. The place was nice and clean, and the food was decent. But my initial impression was that both the onion rings and the pizza lacked flavor. Though the onion rings were beautifully presented and crispy, I struggled to taste any seasonings. They were bland. When the pizza arrived I had the same impression. I had to add Parmesan cheese (which I never do) to get much of a flavor. This place has a ton of potential, but they need to adjust their seasonings. Everything was bland  and under seasoned. This is an easy fix. The place is clean and well maintained and the staff was friendly. But the food lacked flavor and was a bit over priced. This place used to be Michelangelo&#39;s Pizza which I loved. The new recipes just don&#39;t hold up."

Having passed by here a few times and being held up from crossing the railroad tracks I decided to stop by one day as I saw a sign that mentioned Pizza slices. 

Once I walked in, I was informed that no slices were ready, but I looked over the menu a little more thoroughly and noticed they had hot dogs. I decided to try the hot dog here which included fries. While I waited I looked around and noticed that the place was very well decorated and had an intentional rustic design to the interior. I very much get the sense that the intended design of this place was for a coffee house of some type and the other food items got added as time went on to increase appeal. After around ten minutes my food was ready and since it was served to me in a container I took it to go. 

Upon arriving at home shortly afterwards it was time to dig in. The hot dog I received was a jumbo skinless hot dog of some undetermined type ( not the usual Vienna Beef or Red Hot Chicago dogs widely served in Chicagoland). It came on a not particularly soft, but not hard bun. On the dog itself was only tomato pieces and onions along with a large pickle spear. In the container with the hot dog and fries were packets of mustard and ketchup. The hot dog itself wasn&#39;t that great, not a particularly strong flavor. The bun wasn&#39;t very soft and the tomato slices were a little too wet and made it soggy. 

The fries included with this hot dog were thicker than usual crinkle cut fries. They weren&#39;t particularly salty or greasy and had a lot of bland potato paste on the inside. These weren&#39;t bad, I prefer these to a lot of places &#34;fresh cut fries&#34; but they weren&#39;t good enough to salvage the experience. 

When I get a plain-ish hot dog like this it&#39;s always hard to rate the experience as I can&#39;t comment on condiment application. While tomato and onion were applied to this dog it doesn&#39;t give me enough ground to cover this hot dog as I do most places. Overall I&#39;d say this was a bit too expensive for what you get and you can do better. While not terrible, I am going to say it&#39;s below average and give it two stars. Maybe the pizza here is better, and if I get around to trying it I&#39;ll update this review."

Their italian beef is lean and not fatty.  The mostaccioli is more of a pasta/sauce combo than a baked mostaccioli with a lot of cheese.  We enjoyed it this way very much.

&#34;Here we go sodeo all night long&#34;

It&#39;s a Raffi song, and when I was a little girl I would sing along, &#34;here we go SODIUM.&#34;  I thought my mom was full of it when she said it was &#34;sodeo,&#34; since that&#39;s not a thing.  Sodium, however, is a thing, and for the first time in 20+ years this song popped into my head as I chowed down on some Szechuan beef from Yen Ching.

It wasn&#39;t too salty though, I was impressed by the spiciness.  It didn&#39;t blow my brains out, but generally that little red pepper/spice indicator on a Chinese menu is full of lies.  The Szechuan beef was a huge portion of beef and veggies, but it was seriously lacking in the mini corn cob, pea pod, and water chestnut department.  If I&#39;m going to eat Chinese, this trifecta of veggies MUST be present.

This disclaimer is a little late, but Chinese food is not my favorite cuisine; in fact, it&#39;s probably my least favorite.  I favor Thai and Japanese over Chinese.  But when I get a craving for &#34;Chinese,&#34; it&#39;s really a combination of egg rolls, crab rangoons, and fried rice dancing in my head - the trifecta of Chinese side dishes.  I&#39;m merely obligated to order more than this since I don&#39;t live alone.

The orange chicken was the BEST orange chicken I&#39;ve ever had!  The pieces of chicken were large, white meat chunks, which were perfectly breaded, crisp and served with a sweet, evenly-coated orange glaze.  This was the best dish of our order 

But, whomp whomp! The eggrolls sucked.  They were soggy and had a strong peanut butter flavor.  It sucks that my eggroll, half-eaten, sucked.  The crab rangoon were good, a little chinsy on the filling, but it will be difficult for me to admit that anything stuffed with cream cheese and deep fried was subpar.

The fried rice was not greasy at all.  It did lack a little flavor, but I couldn&#39;t believe the large chunks of white meat chicken mixed in.  It&#39;s a fresh product and prepared well, but if you like lots of salt and pepper, you&#39;re going to want to break out your own set of shakers and possibly a bottle of sriracha to spice things up.

I was mildly annoyed when I got home, opened the bags, and noticed the soup had spilled.  Although the soup is in a plastic container, and again wrapped in a plastic bag, the container had cracked under the weight (the soup was at the bottom of my bag), and there was a pool of soup inside the plastic bag.  It wasn&#39;t a big deal, nothing got ruined, but it was a moment worthy of an eyeroll.  One of the reasons I do takeout is because I&#39;m too lazy to do dishes.  The soup spill required me to dirty a bowl so, eyeroll, now I&#39;ve got to wash one.

Aside from the few hiccups (spilled soup and crappy eggrolls), I&#39;m giving Yen Ching 4 stars.  The customer service here was friendly, polite, and the girl at the counter was all about getting people checked out quickly.  There are 3 Chinese restaurants in a 3-mile stretch of Route 59 (between 119th and 135th), and this is #1."

Inside is more set-up for carryout with just a few tables.  Got a large chicken fried rice and a small chicken curry for about $15 altogether.  

I hardly notice any difference in the fried rice dish among many of the Chinese take-out places, here, there was a lot of big white chicken pieces in the rice.  

The chicken curry, for a small portion, was quite large, as I got about 4 meals out of it.  The dish was pieces of chicken with thin-long lengthed pieces of carrots and onions in a green curry.  Never had curry before so I was expecting an intense spiciness, especially with the pepper icon next to it in the menu.  The spiceness was more mild as I wasn&#39;t exactly hitting the water right away, had more of a cinnamon-type intensity, which I found surprising."

Well of course if anyone knows me I never turn Chinese down. Well it was cold and rainy so I told him just stop at the next one and get what we usually get the general tso&#39;s chicken.  We have lived here less than a year so haven&#39;t tried all of the Chinese places around here yet. Anyway he stops at yen ching orders their lunch portion. 
I could tell upon him getting home it was just going to be mediocre because usually you smell the spices and this was not the case. First off portions were ok I&#39;ve seen bigger around here, you did get either egg roll or 1 wonton and a cup of soup or pop. So that is definitely fair for pricing is concerned. Moving on wonton was good, fried rice was really good now onto the chicken. I looked, I tasted sauce was ehhh not spicy for general tso&#39;s not even close actually. It reminded me more of a sweet and sour mixed with a Lil general tso&#39;s. I could bare it though that&#39;s not where it was horrible. The chicken was the worst! I don&#39;t even know how to describe it but a little bite size of chicken in a whole lotta breading. I mean the best way to describe the texture and sizing etc... would be if you would mate a chicken nugget and a corndog together you would get a chicken corn nugget! I dunno it was not at all appealing or appetizing. 
I would go for the rice but that&#39;s it. So will not be ordering from here again. Will try others there are few left that we haven&#39;t tried yet!"

I am seriously addicted to the Shrimp Toasts. Probably not the best thing on the menu but their ooey, gooey, greasiness is hard to pass up. The rest of the menu is typical of suburban Chinese restaurants. You can get Szechwan, Hunan, Mongolian, Kung Pao and Moo Shu entrees. The staff is always super friendly too.

First, I love the fresh tortilla chips and spicy, delicious salsas (both green and red).  I can&#39;t decide which I like best.  The horchata is excellent.  I usually order tacos -  the cochinita pibil and the asada.  The asada (steak) tacos are as good as you&#39;ll find.  The steak is juicier than most taco places and fulll of flavor. The same can be said of the cochinita pibil (slow-roasted pork).  I&#39;ve never had cochinita pibil before, but it is as juicy as barbacoa in San Antonio or a mother&#39;s roast (if she&#39;s an incredible cook).  I discovered that it&#39;s a Mayan recipe from the Yucatan where the pork is slow-roasted in banana (plantain) leaves.  This leaves the pork very moist and you can easily tear it apart with your fingers (kind of like the Mayan&#39;s version of pulled pork).  I tried looking for it in Guatemala without success.  

I tried a special one day, chicken albacara? I believe.  It&#39;s a chicken stew, but its not what you would typically think of as stew.  It&#39;s chicken cooked in a broth with jalapeños and served on a bed of rice on a plate.  It&#39;s not a soup by any means.  It was incredible also.  I think I&#39;m going to have to try everything at least once here, but that would mean not getting my usual which I love so much.  Great restaurant.  Absolutely love their food.  They have some of the best Mexican food in the Chicagoland area.  I no longer have to drive into the city or Aurora for great Mexican food!"

As I&#39;m finding out a lot of places in the area are closed on Monday---womp womp for me---but I get it---a day of rest is definitely a necessity.

The fam and I did a take out order with steak tacos, salbute, carne asada, chicken tortilla soup, flan, and horchata---I know, I know----whenever we go somewhere new we like to try a variety of randomness.

All the items were super flavorful! We especially liked the carne asada and the salbute!

Check them out on Facebook as they have a different special of the day--everyday---off menu items generally.  Definitely will call ahead if not eating in next time---they get super packed for lunch time."

It&#39;s a small place and orders are taken at the counter then brought to you at your table or at the bar.  The staff is friendly albeit often rather quiet.  It&#39;s always clean and some level of self bussing is expected.

I&#39;ve never had a bad entree here.  I&#39;m an adventurous eater and will routinely get the special if it sounds at all intriguing.  Their salbute are excellent as well as the cochinita pibil and carne asada.  Unfortunately they don&#39;t offer burritos but given the quality of their food and presentation that&#39;s something I&#39;ve easily forgiven.  In place of the burrito they do have rice bowls which are more or less the contents of a burrito in a bowl and are typically the perfect amount of food for lunch."

I read reviews on the fresh homemade tortillas and I was sold. So we headed out on a Friday night. The place wasn&#39;t that busy and the service was great. 

The food was good but I feel like the salsas definitely could use a little more kick. At least have a salsa for people who like it really spicy. 

Of course I got Tutti Frutti Jarrito to wash my tacos down. Believe me, tacos and Jarritos go together like peanut butter and jelly! They also had some beer which I didn&#39;t bother with.

Menu is updated daily on the blackboard. And most are well below the $10 sweet spot. 

I decided to go big and try the Cochinita Pibil platter for a whopping $12. 

It came with two kinds of salsa. Both salsas were excellent. I think the verde had more heat. 

The platter came with the usual rice and beans. The beans were really quite excellent. The pork itself was tender, perhaps slightly on the salty side for me.

We weren&#39;t greeted once we went in which was already kind of disappointing. It&#39;s a cute little restaurant in the middle of a small strip center. Prices for tacos are a bit much at almost $3 depending on which option you select. The steak torta was okay and didn&#39;t taste too greasy or chewy like at most places. The pork sope was okay but a bit too spicy for me. I liked the homemade sope used though, just enough crunch. The pork torta was good and not spicy at all so it must have been made with different pork. The chicken quesadilla was good. The sauces were both too salty. A little more Americanized place and food though. Not somewhere I&#39;d go out of my way for."

Steak tacos, ordered with onion and cilantro, did not disappoint!  My apparent commitment issue forced me to have one on a flour tortilla and the other corn.  Both good, next time I&#39;ll go corn.

Washed it all down with their excellent horchata.  

The restaurant is small with about 6 or 7 tables.  Clean, comfy, with a soccer game on the telly.

The cherry on top is that the place is environmentally friendly.  Real plates and the option for a real fork and not all plastic.

Torta was amazing...the steak is extremely tender...not chewy like you get at a lot of places.

Salbutes....great.

Carne Asada, perfect flavor and tenderness. Side beans are amazing.

Pork Belly Tacos....amazing even if they probably are not the healthiest thing on earth. The house made corn tortillas are perfect.

They also have horchata, beer, wine and canned soft drinks. We perched at the counter, which was lucky because we got to talk to a woman who seemed to be the owner. My husband got chicken tacos, and I got the special, chicken thighs in chile arbol over rice.

We were served chips fresh from the fryer and two salsas which were fresh and awesome tasting. The hot had a kick but wasn&#39;t destroy your mouth hot.

Our food came out pretty quickly and it was sooooo good. These people are serious. The chicken was super tender. Fell apart on my fork. Great smoky flavor, not spicy, just bold. I devoured it.

There aren&#39;t many tables inside, so this might be an issue on the weekends, but on a weekday there is plenty available. The interior of the restaurant is more on the plain side, so I hope that one day they jazz it up a little. Even though the interior is plain, the restaurant is very clean kept up well. 

Their menu has some great options for both main dishes, appetizers, desserts, and even beverages. I ordered the Lamb taco, salbutes (like a taco), and flan. The meat in the lamb taco was very tender and flavorful. I had never had a lamb taco before, but was very pleased with my first experience. The only option for the salbutes is with the chicken and veggies. With the addition of a little bit of green salsa, this was also a delicious part of the meal. I brought my flan home, and ate it in bed while I relaxed that same night. In the past, I have not had the most impressive experiences with flan, but the flan from here was a different story.

Menu is pretty limited, but everything we tasted was delicious.  We basically tasted all of the meats, everything on the menu is a dish made with one of the meats, or cheese/peppers.  

I had a steak taco and a salbute (deep fried tortilla topped with shredded chicken, cabbage and tomato)  My suuuper picky self ate both at record speed.  The meat was really nicely flavored, no fatty pieces (which I HATE) and topped with cilantro and onions, and I added some of their salsas (which, by the way are so damn tasty!!).  The tortilla is a fresh made corn masa tortilla - able to hold all that meat and the salsa without falling apart. 

The Salbute was also really good, maybe just a touch greasy - but it&#39;s deep fried - gonna happen.  Chicken was nicely seasoned as well.

My BF had a steak torta, and a pork taco (cochinita pibil) - he loved them both as well.

My son had a chicken rice bowl - it was FULL with rice, meat, lettuce, tomatoes, beans, sour cream, etc.  He tore that sucker up - and my son normally does not eat very much - he finished it all!!

Very limited dessert selection - mainly flans - I had the flan de rompope - OMG was that sh*t good.  I have to learn how to make it at home because Los Dos is just too far for me to hit on a regular basis and I can&#39;t wait that long to have another one of those flans!!  Next time I am also trying the Kahlua flan...sounds deeelish.  

Complimentary chips and salsas -- all tasty.  heat levels varied from mild to really really hot!  Chips were nice and warm - not greasy at all.

LOS DOS, however, has the best authentic Mexican food.  My favorite are their steak tacos.  So simple and so fresh.  They don&#39;t jazz it up with salsa or lettuce or miles and miles of tomato.  They simply put cilantro,onion and your choice of meat in homemade tortillas.  OMG ORDER THEM ON THE CORN. SOOOO freaking good.  I&#39;m a fan of their steak.

Los Dos is in a  stripmall, a storefront Mexican place.. a touch more upscale than many and they serve wine and beer. It&#39;s also a scosh more pricey**

*Tres
I ordered three tacos: pollo, carne asada and carnitas.. and the special carnitas tamale.

The tacos were all flavorful, but I was especially fond of the pork taco. Hence, I was also very fond of the tamale.. delicious! Even though I thought the tamale was pricey** I would get it again. The steak and chicken tacos were excellent as well.

** pricey means.. means maybe .50 to $1.00 more per item

The service was very good, they only have a few tables.. you order at the counter and then they serve you at your table or the small bar area. I was given two hot sauces and while they were good tasting, they were meant for mere mortals... the owner brought me out a hotter sauce that was quite good.. but still not super hot.

It&#39;s a nice, friendly atmosphere and the food is good.. overall it&#39;s reasonably priced.. while not as cheap as some of the other Mexican joints in the area. I will be back for sure.

Watch for their special.. the chef (the other half of the Dos) likes to have some fun."

I tend to overlook places that don&#39;t offer lengua but I couldn&#39;t ignore the reviews and pictures. This place was a very nice surprise. The storefront is small, not many places to sit, but it was a not-so-busy Tuesday. The menu is fairly straight forward, not an overwhelming amount of options.

We went with steak, chicken, and pork tacos with cilantro y onions and cheeeze (15c extra). I was also lucky enough to get the last daily special, a pork tamale. Also a side of rice. 

The tacos were great across the board. They&#39;re larger than most places and comparable in price. The pork taco was extra juicy and delicious. I usually get three at most places but I would be satisfied with two. The pork tamale was so-so, nothing special. The rice was standard as well. Perfectly cooked, great texture, but the flavor wasn&#39;t there. But no worries, if you eat in, you can dress it up with some salsa raja or verde that come with the awesomely fresh FREE chips and salsa. The chips are really great.

Looking forward to trying the other daily specials and menu items!

4.5 stars on Yelp? I had to see what the fuss was about, and I don&#39;t regret it! It&#39;s a small little restaurant in a small little plaza. Little did we know, you have to order at the counter and then sit at a table. We did the exact opposite and sat down at a table waiting for someone to take our orders. Whoops!

I ordered three steak tacos with lettuce, tomatoes and cilantro. Yes, they&#39;re $2.95 each and pricey, but they definitely don&#39;t skimp on the meat and are a decent size. You can also tell that it&#39;s better quality meat than most of the other taco joints in the area (no nasty, fatty pieces!). What&#39;s also great is that the tortillas are handmade. This might be the first restaurant I&#39;ve visited that goes that route.

We also didn&#39;t know you had to go back up to the counter to pay after you finish eating. We just sat at our table waiting for someone to give us the check. Whoops again!

Overall, I highly recommend visiting this little gem in the west burbs."

Complimentary warm, salty chips and two salsa offerings were solid. Guacamole was top notch as well, but for $6 I&#39;d be hard pressed not to simply make it at home or just go somewhere else.The handmade corn tortillas were appreciated, but way to thick and masa-y. The Cochinita pibil was a welcome dish, but far from the best I&#39;ve tried (check out Chuck&#39;s). Not much flavor and oddly dry...needed salt and spice. Sides of rice and black beans were decent, but hardly justified the $12 cost. The daily special Lamb Taco was decent, but like everything else, it hardly impressed and was overpriced. Too fatty, with the taste and mouth feel of gristly, stringy, lengua. Seating inside is cramped and limited, but the food seems to get out quick enough to keep the patrons moving. Definitely enjoyed the affordable beer offerings, but not sure it&#39;s enough to keep me coming back. Three tacos, four beers, guacamole, and the pibil ran just over $40 for two of us. While I appreciate what they&#39;re attempting, I&#39;m hard pressed to say they&#39;re pulling it off. Overpriced and mostly underwhelming.

Los Dos is an exceptional Mexican restaurant and has the food of classic, authentic Mexican food. This is a high 4 star rating. Everything was very good from the tacos (steak, pork, and peppers and cheese) to the tortilla soup. 

What is great about this place is how they cook their tortillas. They make sure every tortilla is cooked enough to compliment it&#39;s wonderful fillings. Restaurants should take boys of this as it is not always done. A pretty  good Horchata also. 

The chef, who is also part owner, is charming. While I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary, it&#39;s always nice to see someone you like cooking your food with such care.

I will say the service that we received was great but the food overall was not bad but far from what I expected. It seemed to be more Americanized Mexican food not the authentic kind I was craving.

For Vegetarians, the options are somewhat limited and they did not seem to want to adjust their menu to accommodate. That&#39;s fine - every place is not for every one, and I can understand that.

Basically for vegetarians they had a taco or a torta with poblano peppers and cheese as the filling. That&#39;s about it... We all had the taco, and it was fine. From the appetizers side we tried the guacamole and quesadilla. Again, for the guacamole, they didn&#39;t to adjust to taste, e.g., I wanted a spicy guac. For $6, you get a very very small cup of the guac, which was a bit disappointing. It was fine. The rest of the items didn&#39;t seem to be over-priced, so that was kind of surprising. Lastly, the quesadilla with pepper and cheese was good. I think the best thing Los Dos has to offer are the chips and sauces. All three sauces are quite good and the extra hot sauce is very good.

The place seemed to be doing great business. It was around 6pm on a Friday evening, and place was crowded. Seemed like one lady trying to run the show, which was probably tough. Luckily, we arrived before the crowds showed up so we got lucky.

Overall, Los Dos is a nice little joint. Very clean place and fresh food. Personally, I would appreciate if they had better options for vegetarians or at least a willingness to adjust the fixed menu."

There were two people in line - one ordering, one waiting.  I had 15-20 minutes and figured I&#39;d be able to get a couple tacos to go in that time.

First, it took nearly 10 minutes for me to get to the front of the line, mostly because the girl working the register seemed to be new, under-trained, or otherwise unable to take orders without multiple repeats and register delays.  Seems like a poor management decision on a presumably busy day.

Then, as I was ordering, a customer who had been seated (and served) walked up beside me and hollered his order to another employee who was standing idly behind the counter.  She happily obliged, got his beer, called his taco order to the cook, and said he could settle up when the line was gone. Meanwhile, I had to repeat my order three times to the cashier.  It was for two steak tacos - one with cheese, one with lettuce, tomato, and onion.  If I&#39;d only known, I would have shouted my order when I arrived to save time.  Now, my order still hadn&#39;t been passed along to the cook.

After finally getting the order written down, the cashier struggled to get the register to add it up, When she did, I reach out to hand the cashier my credit card, which I had been holding in plain sight above the counter through the whole ordering process.  She informed me that they only accept credit cards for purchases over $10.  Mine was $7 and change.  She asked if I had cash.  I said, &#34;No.&#34;  She then asked if I wanted to order more things to increase the total.

At that point, nearly 15 minutes had passed, my order had not yet been placed, and by the time this employee figured out how to add something to my order (something I didn&#39;t want, at that), I wouldn&#39;t have possibly gotten my food in time to be moving on.  My reaction was simply saying, &#34;I&#39;m done here.  Never mind,&#34; and walking away empty-handed.

I&#39;d had their food once before; and it was ok tasting, small portions.  There are too many options for Mexican food nearby to choose this establishment again."

It&#39;s very small and cramped especially if the people inside are fat. Hmm. Moreover, I paid like 9$ for a cup of beans and two tacos. Overpriced.  My girlfriend had a quesadilla. Only cheese. It was soggy from the grease. How do you mess up a quesadilla??? I had been to this place when it first opened and always said intend good but I had recently been brought in through another friend. I do not recommend it any more than Los Burrito. Also- they do not accept a credit card unless it is 10$ minimum transaction. These r tacos. Not salmon burgers. Cmon. No cash."

Something that is REALLY nice is their daily specials which are usually the best thing on the menu. Some of the habañero stuff is way too spicy for me, but on the whole their quite good (lamb tacos are the best by far). The staff is wonderful, and it&#39;s a super comfortable place to eat.

So here is a very overdue rave for Los Dos, run by Amor and Mike, who are the eponymous &#34;Dos.&#34;  Though their place is casual and homey as could be, they have learned their craft in some elegant places, and it&#39;s evident in the care they show with their dishes.  The menu has consistent favorites -- try the salbutes and the cochinita pibil, for example -- along with specials that change daily and are often adventurous (lamb tacos with avocado crema, ribs in chili verde sauce, and on and on).  Their freshly handmade corn and flour tortillas are incredible;  likewise their chips, salsa, and guacamole.  Nice selection of beers.  Flans are maybe the best we&#39;ve had.

The meat was tender and well seasoned, and they don&#39;t skimp on the meat.  This isn&#39;t your $1 taco joint, it&#39;s $2 and some change, but definitely worth it.

The free chips and salsa are also really good.  The chips are made fresh, and you get plenty of them.  I favored the red salsa over the green, but truthfully they&#39;re both fantastic.

I didn&#39;t like the guacamole that much.  The texture was smooth, more like a dip, and it tasted sort of like sour cream, and it was very, very limey.  The portion for $5 wouldn&#39;t be bad if it had been a better flavor/texture.  The guac here just isn&#39;t for me.  

There are a variety of drinks available including several sodas, iced teas, craft beers, and horchata.  My horchata tasted like chai and was poured from a Dean&#39;s gallon container.  If I had seen that before I ordered, I would have opted for a Coke instead.

When we dined in, it was so hot and humid inside that I thought the A/C might be broken.  It didn&#39;t totally ruin our dining experience, but I still left with a &#34;blegh&#34; feeling.

Los Dos easily earns 5 stars with their tacos and chips &amp; salsa.  But the guacamole, horchata, and steamy dining area made it a 4-star experience for me."

Their 2 salsa were perfect with the warm chips. I love the seasoning on the meat for the tacos.

Also may be a coincidence but the young  girl walked out of view and away from the register with my credit card for a few minutes.

This place operated by a friendly and efficient staff offers up great fresh tacos, quesadillas and the like, does it reasonably quick and at a good price.

The tortilla chips (first bowl free, $1 for the next) are on the harder shell side and more dense and crunchy than some.  Two homemade salsas are offered -- one is mild with nice flavors and the other one brings a small snap of heat.

The chips are freshly made as well and were just made when we got them, so they were actually hot.  There are 2 salsas for the chips &amp; to add to the food - one green &amp; hot and the other red and mild.  Both are extremely flavorful.

Los Dos was discovered purely on accident. I was at my moms and I was starving. I was also lazy so I knew I would only go within walking distance. Enter Los Dos. 

Situated in a strip mall, the tiny restaurant delivers the best tacos, homemade tortillas and flavors around. ((Seriously, if anything, go for the tortillas)). I ordered myself a steak taco, chicken taco, guacamole, and rice. Each item was better than the next. The meats were cooked perfectly and the ingredients were seasoned just right and full of freshness. I haven&#39;t ventured too much further off the menu since I started my love affair with the tacos. However, the serve up other delicious looking dishes like tortas, salbutes, rice bowls, and carne asada. 

The downside. The place is tiny and has a handful of tables, so if it&#39;s busy it&#39;s best to take your order to go. However, if it&#39;s on the slower side, grab a seat at the bar and chow down on complimentary chips and salsa. YUM.

I had a steak rice bowl and he had 2 of the brisket tacos (daily special) and a steak taco.  They brought chips and salsa to the table and we were blown away by the salsa.  I should add that my husband is Mexican and we love to cook and eat authentic Mexican food.  We both loved our food. The portion was just right for my steak bowl.  It wasn&#39;t ridiculously huge or smothered in cheese (yay!) and everything was hot and fresh.  I used lots of the salsa atop.  My husband loved the tacos, especially the brisket.  Meltingly tender beef and hot, fresh tortillas. We had a great view of the kitchen with cooks bustling around and preparing everything to order.

Their smoked and stewed pork is amazing. Yet I prefer the steak is which is charred, yet stays moist on the inside despite being cut into very small cubes. 

Today&#39;s special is sopes (I got two). I&#39;ve never had this dish before, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s going to be worth my time.

I also noticed that they looked like the ones that I like, the kind that just come with cilantro and onion. I was a bit underwhelmed. 

The tacos came out and tasted a bit bland, the corn tortillas are a thick, almost doughy type of tortilla that apparently lots of people love. I prefer the thinner, sometimes doubled up ones that get a quick crisp on the grill before you get them. 

Although they aren&#39;t for me the other dishes like the rice bowls and the specials look pretty good. I will be back, just not a huge fan of the steak tacos."

My personal favorite is the steak torta. A buttery fresh roll toasted to perfection then piled high with savory steak, ripe avocado, flavorful black beans, juicy tomatoes, crisp lettuce, and a dollop of sour cream. So good! They have a rice bowl version as well if I want to pretend to be healthy.

The chips and guac are a solid staple as well. Be sure to check out their website as they always have a special of the day which adds great variety to their menu.

The staff have always been incredibly friendly. They even picked up the tab for an order one time when they heard it was for my mom&#39;s ten year cancer free celebration- unexpected but appreciated!

The secret is out about this place so call early when the special sounds good or on the weekend rush."

It was their Saturday special, and it&#39;s not always available. I teamed it up with an old favorite of mine, a steak quesadilla with some horchata. Horchata seems to be a little different from normal but was very flavorful. No free refills and limited choices of other bottled beverages. You&#39;ll need cash if your order is less than $10.

I was surprised to see they fry up each serving of chips as you order. The freshness and texture of everything was great and it hit the price point. I can see myself making the trek here and enjoying their specials. Not official table service but they seem attentive to your needs and you can keep your ticket open once you walk in and order. 

Not a ton of seating but there&#39;s bar stools at the counter, a couple other high top tables and four small tables, which makes for a casual meeting spot. Having the owners on site is always a plus and they seem to oversee everything. Saturday seems to be family time and the TV was tuned into the kid channel.

Its been over a year since my last Los Dos review. I shall begin with saying Los Dos is mucho mucho nice. Really I am not kidding they are super friendly.

Los Dos has the freshest and on the spot homemade tortillas. I am in love with their steak tacos served with cilantro and onions. The steak is char-broiled and holds its flavor well. Clearly the creative minds behind the menu have done their homework. Los Dos serves only the best and produces 100% confidence.

Today I cheated on my usual taco order with a Steak Torta. The bun was toasted and smothered in beans then lettuce, tomato, sour cream and avocado. Once again the steak&#39;s flavor greeted me with a jumping high kick to my tastebuds. It was another wining meal.

The homemade chips have the exact same addiction as m&amp;m&#39;s. Salted, crispy and splash their hot sauce and you are in heaven!

Until next time :)"

Anyway, I ventured over in this area for some lunch and stopped when I saw a sign for tacos.  I was hoping that they had some sort of lunch special, which they did not but the tacos really weren&#39;t too expensive.  They do offer a daily special, but on this particular day it was a $4 fish taco which I didn&#39;t want.  

When I went it was pretty busy and the dining area is pretty small, so I sat at the bar.  The person who took my order was really friendly and took  my order right away.  It did take them longer to get me some complimentary chips than it did to get me my actual order, but it didn&#39;t really matter - I just ate it all together with their delicious homemade salsa.

We came in to try these dishes on a Friday night. Upon first entering, we were slapped in the eardrums with the explosively loud volume in the bar. It wasn&#39;t that the music was too loud - it was simply the volume of every patron in the bar. In fact, we could hardly hear the music as everyone was practically screaming at each other. This appears to be a great sports bar, lots of screens with many different games being broadcast. My wife was convinced we came in on a fantasy draft night - I however, got the impression this is the average crowd. Some serious &#34;bromances&#34; happening in here - the ratio was roughly 8 guys to every 1 female. I could see the look of absolute misery on nearly every female in the bar - the sausage fest made neck breaking turns to gawk at every woman to walk in the door.  

Our server was super cool - it took him a while to initially greet us, but after that delay, he was quick to refill our drinks and check in regularly. The food was good - the Mac And Cheese was tasty and oh so full of bar calories... We didn&#39;t come here to count calories and this certainly hit that spot. 

We will give Another Round, another&#39;s try in the future. I hope it was just a particularly rambunctious night that doesn&#39;t reflect the every day occurrence."

They apparently are an &#34;Official Blackhawks&#34; bar. They even show the cool opening that you only get to see while at the game. They have a horn for all of the goals and of course.. THE SONG!  

The food is pretty good. I had a buffalo chicken wrap with was perfectly sauced. Others in our group had fried pickles, tacos, mini burgers, wings and a salad. They have a variety of different foods and appetizers. 

It was a very busy night, of course, because of the Hawks game... and the waitress really tried to accommodate us as much as possible. She was really nice.. wish I could remember her name. If anyone from Another Round is reading this, we sat at the tables directly right next to what seems to be a VIP area with couches.. directly in front of the big tv. She even helped us with suggestions for shots.

Id definitely go again."

Drink specials are okay. When I went last Sunday, they had Bloody Marys for $5.50.

I ordered boneless wings for $9.95. When they came out, there were 10 small wings- that&#39;s $1 per wing! When I told the bartender I was dissappointed, he rectified it and brought out a new, bigger order. Great customer service to make me a happy camper!

I give this place 3 stars because they have everything you want for a sports bar, although prices are slightly high overall. I probably won&#39;t order food again.

If you don&#39;t have a specific place to go to, but you want to do something, I would suggest to go here. Another Round is pretty agreeable for all parties."

I remembered it as being packed with enthusiastic fans and a fog horn going off every time the Blackhawks scored. So when the hubby and I found ourselves in downtown Downers Grove right before the Blackhawks played the Calgary Flames, we dropped in again.

Good decision! This place is the quintessential sports bar! A billion big-screen TVs, plenty of seating (with fold-out walls to open up other areas when the place gets crowded and an outdoor patio for nice weather,) a surprisingly good menu (great spicy shrimp tacos), and a friendly, attentive waitress named Melissa who actually knew and liked good beer! 

Speaking of the beer list here, the selection is not very large and it consists of a lot of crappy beers because most sports fans don&#39;t know what good beer is. However, this place is smart enough to also carry some premium brews like Guinness and Sam Adams, and a few selections from craft breweries like Two Brothers. So there&#39;s something for everyone. My husband had them mix up a &#34;Black and Bock&#34; - a mixture of Guinness and Shiner Bock.

We had no wait for a table or service, but this was on a Tuesday night. It&#39;s probably a different story on week-ends when it&#39;s packed.

And yes, they did blow the fog horn (and played &#34;Chelsea Dagger&#34;) whenever the Hawks scored!"

Everything took sooo long to come out, and and by the time our server checked on us were already ready to to skedaddle. The appetizers are all heavily fried and pretty sub-par and though my spicy shrimp tacos were genuinely pretty solid, the 99 cent extra charge for dried out, hard-as-a-hammer tots was not justifiable. 

As with most menus based upon the presence of a fryer in the restaurant, we all left feeling heavy, tired, and annoyed that we had to wait so incredibly long for our food, drinks, checks, and server. 

Another round might be a decent place to stop for some drinks and food, but if you plan on doing things with your day beyond beyond waiting for someone who&#39;s supposed to be waiting on you, maybe skip it and look elsewhere."

We had some coffee and and decided we were going to run some earns before lunch. I asked if we csn reserve the table and I will leave my credit card at the bar. Left and came back less than 1 hour later. The waitress gave a 6 person table away to a guy sitting alone. Went to the waitress and asked what&#39;s going on. She said he just sat down, I said okay so it should be easier to move him to a single table or somewhere else. She said no and said we can sit at the tables right in front or a 100 inch projector screen. Yes, I want to watch the football game 6 inches from a projector screen. I guess they don&#39;t require common sense to get a GED anymore but I may be to generous with her level of education. 

Would love to have tried the food but after that exchange, I fear for the service in ordering food and you could have the best food in the country but you might as well close your doors if you have bad service.

We&#39;d been to sister restaurant Roundhead and I thought it was just ok, but I was actually a bit more impressed with Another Round. We met a few people on a Friday to watch some March madness and eat and drink. 

The wait was about 20 minutes at 6:30 which is better than expected. We grabbed a first round at the bar, and got seated halfway through our drinks. Our waitress handled the busy night and our many rounds of orders well. 

We shared some pot roast waffle fry nachos, which were quite good. The pot roast was juicy and tender and made my husband say &#34;we really need to eat pot roast more often.&#34; 

Continuing on the pot roast theme, I had pot roast sliders, a simple affair of meat, a slice of cheese and tiny pretzel rolls. Adorable and more filling than you might think. A side of tots rounded out my oh-so-healthy dinner.

The rest of the table had various sandwiches, pizza, and for one paleo-loving dieter, a plate of veggies - which they were happy to accommodate.

The beer list is decent, if not completely outstanding; they do have some good local brews and a few craft choices. 

The waitress took great care of us, the atmosphere was a lot of fun for watching basketball, and I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to come back to hang out with friends."

I got the Parmesan crusted grill cheese w/ bacon and a side of sweet potato fries. Not a bad dish, but the cheese does lack the creaminess of American cheese. The fries were bomb diggity.

My friend and I were headed to the midnight showing of the Blues Brothers at the Tivoli and stopped in because it was one of those places that is open late and still serves food... delicious, potroasty, food.  

Their big claim to fame (in suburban circles) is their plate of pot roast fries.  I had heard tales of these mythical fries and was pretty pumped to push nutrition aside in a moment of meaty whimsy.  This dish is not for the faint of heart (seriously, if you have high blood pressure... ask your dr. first).  Pot roast fries are composed of a GIANT bowl/plate of waffle fries, layered with cheddar cheese (not the &#39;sauce&#39;), blue cheese, tomatoes, onions, and topped with giant chunks of tender, fall-apart-in-your-mouth, homemade pot roast.  They are a delicious and shameful food choice... but one you should make at least once!

The rest of the menu was mediocre. Good enough, but nothing special.  The waitress was very pleasant, present, and was quick to refresh our drinks. Drink menu was reasonably varied for the environment and had a range of beers beyond the typical bro-brew.

We got there at 11:30. Two people, when they opened. ONE other table was there when we arrived. Two tables in the whole joint. 

We ordered chili dip, two grilled cheese sandwiches (add tomato) with BBQ sauce and honey mustard to dip the fries. All together, nothing fancy.

Over 30 minutes later, no food. We didn&#39;t order steaks. Nothing that really needed to be cooked longer than 5 minutes total, really. The service was TERRIBLE. I never complain about service and rant and rave about how the food quality matters more. Well, it does... but when your food takes forever, it does matter. Especially when ordering grilled cheese. We didn&#39;t get out until 12:30 (and were then in a huge hurry) and we ordered grilled cheese, had to get up for the bill, and nearly walk in the kitchen just to get a box.

The chili dip was gross. A slab of whipped cream cheese on the bottom of a bowl with a cup of chili on top. Really lame. The waitress lied about things taking so long because the cook forgot to fry the chips. We received BAGGED chips. Liar. Admit you just forgot, thanks.

The grilled cheese was good, but we never received any dipping sauces and no tomato inside. Is that too much to ask?

We only had waters... so the food was all! 

Won&#39;t be back because although the grilled cheese was good and crusted with yummy parmesan, it wasn&#39;t worth the wait or missing out on what we really wanted to eat-- properly."

Holy smokes! I swear, our bartender&#39;s biceps were the same size as his head! So, either he had a really tiny head, or really gigantic biceps! I couldn&#39;t tell which anymore after looking at him for too long. Besides having massive biceps (or possibly a tiny head), he was also a great bartender! My friend and I were ordering really obscure mixtures of things, and he went along with all of them! He humored us all the way : )

Anyway. This place was a blast. There was a blackhawks game on and the place was packed with crazy blackhawks fans. It was so much fun! Every time they scored a goal, the bar would explode and then a large fog horn would sound. We didn&#39;t want to leave, but we had to to catch our train.

Also, the food looked and smelled delicious. I can&#39;t wait to go back and try it sometime.

We&#39;ll be back soon!

They were decent, but nothing worth raving over. My next trip was for carry out, that time I opted for the pot roast sliders. After my wonderful experience with the nachos, these were on my must try list. One word for you, YUM! If you love pot roast, check these tasty little guys out.

The main reason that brought us here was their indoor patio-ish seating.  Its a nice view and you get an outdoor seating feel, indoors. Definitely a selling point and a reason I would return.

How do you feck up fried food??  We ordered the fried platter because we were feeling particularly fatty this afternoon.  The fried mushrooms were cold on the inside.  Some even still frozen.  Funny, because it took forever to get our food.  I also ordered the Parmesan grilled cheese.  They were out of white bread, but offered to make it on wheat.  I would rather have it on wheat, so I didn&#39;t mind.  It also tasted amazing reheated.

It took even longer to get the check. Half of us had to wait in the car because our parking limit was almost up.  The service was slow, but friendly.  The menu was large but sub-par.  Not amazing, but OK.  3 stars."

I tried to redeem an expired Groupon (for the amount paid) and was told they don&#39;t honor them even after I showed them the terms and conditions that explained the promotional value may have expired, but the paid value ($10) is to be honored by the merchant. I was told to get a refund directly through Groupon, which is not what is outlined in their terms and conditions. At this point it&#39;s more about principal than the actual dollar value. His lack of managerial experience has clearly clouded his better judgment. He&#39;d rather lose a customer and receive a bad review than honor the terms.

Actually, it&#39;s a pretty good one from what we could see.  There are plenty of TV&#39;s  and tables that can handle a good-sized crowd on a game day.  But, we didn&#39;t come for the sports, just the food.  We arrived on a Friday just before the dinner rush, which in the summer, can be a busy day with the classic car show bringing a lot of traffic, auto and pedestrian, to Main Street.  We seated ourselves and were quickly served.

Service was quick and friendly.  We ordered the Fish and Chips with a side salad and beer,  and the Slow Simmered Pot Roast with a side salad, garlic toast and beer.
The wife said that the fish and chips were quite tasty, crisp, not overdone.  The pot roast comes with steamed broccoli, mashed potatoes and crispy onion strings.  Let;s say that you need to bring you appetite with you if you get the pot roast,  An alternative is a doggy bag, but what&#39;s the fun in that.  The chunk of pot roast is large as is the serving of mashed potatoes.  Very filling.  Very good.  I took no doggy bag home.  I prefer the broccoli less steamed,  but it was okay.  I refuse to eat broccoli that is ruined by being sauced too death.  The broccoli here was not.  The onion strings were crispy, at least some of them, for a short while.  They were put on top of the mashed potatoes, then covered in brown gravy.  I would have liked the onion strings better had they not been soaked in gravy, which was pretty good in itself.

The salads were okay, nothing special, but decent.  The garlic toast, just so-so, not all that crispy as toast should be.  The prices are very reasonable.  The beer selection is very good.  The location on Main St. is good,  Street parking is a pain to find, but there is a good-sized parking garage about a block away.

Yes.  This is a good place to eat and one to come back to."

Their pizza is seriously among THE BEST I&#39;ve ever had from any sports bar anywhere on the planet. Its not as good as Gino&#39;s East, nor Giordanos&#39; or Edwardo&#39;s or Barnabys or Art of Pizza, but it IS delicious and holds up well as leftovers too. Warning: I&#39;ve only ordered thin crust here as I&#39;m not ready to take the big boy step into thick or pan pizza at any sports bar.

Imagine Palermo&#39;s thin crust, but without all the sugar in the sauce.... yeah, now you get it.

As for the sports: Holy cow, I thought I was in a Best Buy/Circuit City! Not a good place for a date unless your date is boring and/or they&#39;re a sports fan as well because you cannot help but watch the TVs while you&#39;re there.

As a bonus, the bar area is open and when they get filled up, they &#39;open the walls&#39; to the other rooms as needed and this is a brilliant idea that I wish every other sports or nightclub would do.

It was 7:30 on a Sat. and it wasn&#39;t too busy when we got there there was plenty of space to hold seats for all 9 of us.

Our waitress was excellent and not pushy when we didn&#39;t order food right away.  We did have to move to another table because they needed our space for a private party.  We had cheese curds, and the pot roast nachos to start and both were delicious.  For dinner everyone had sandwich&#39;s or burgers and everything was finished.  We drank a lot of tall beer $6 for craft and cheaper for domestics. Total for 9 dinners, 2 appetizers, and a lot of beer our bill was about $258 or $35 a person with the tip.  We were there from 7:30-11pm so we thought this was a great deal.

Realizing that each night is different I have to say we had excellent service we never were without drinks and she didn&#39;t have to ask what we were drinking she just replaced them and it was always correct.

There are a bajillion TVs and tables to sit at. I only come here when there are big games on. I work at a bar and I&#39;ll admit that I get pretty jealous when I see how packed this place gets.

Their beer selection is good. I was surprised that they offer so many beers that other bars nearby don&#39;t. Woo! The food menu is pretty extensive. They offer a variety of pizza options, pasta, salads, and sandwiches! I shared a pizza with a friend and loved it. It was thin and crispy. A bit oily, but what&#39;s a good pizza without grease?

The food was really good (we ordered fried cheese curds as an appetizer and a pepperoni pizza for our meal). Everything was delicious and the prices were reasonable (our total bill for two people, including an appetizer, a medium pizza, and a lemonade was $26.00 and we had enough pizza left over for us both to take about 6 pieces home). 

The service was good. Since it&#39;s seat yourself there was no wait, and our waitress came over right away and had perfect timing for taking our order, checking on our food, and asking if I wanted a refill.

The environment is like that of a typcial sports bar. HUGE televisions and screens all around, there is a bar in the middle of the restaurant, and the place as a whole is very open - it was basically one big room, not a lot of walls, which I really liked. 

The menu has many options and I think anyone would be able to find something that they like. 

The only negative thing I experienced was that at around 7:30 they turned up the volume on the TVs (which were showing a hockey game) and it was very loud. I had to speak up just to get my friend to hear me - even though we were sitting at the same table. However, since it IS a sports bar, that should be expected to some extent.

I will be going there again, especially when I&#39;m in the mood for pizza or some good bar food :)"

Great all around sports bar but not great for socializing.  People are way to introverted here and unless you in a click that goes here a lot, your on your own.  Pizza is great their other food is very good too.  Best place in Chicago to watch the Blackhawks play hands down.  What other sports bar in DG even compares??"

Yummy food, always hot when I come get it. The service leaves a little to be desired tho. The bartenders are usually too busy chatting among themselves to notice that you&#39;re there until you get their attention.

Good food tho. That&#39;s why its getting three stars instead of two."

Let me first get this out of the way, their sandwiches are good. I had a hard time deciding which sandwich I wanted. I eventually ordered their 8&#34; chicken salad sandwich. When I got the sandwich, I was surprised it was toasted. I never asked them to do it. As it turns out, their bread is frozen. So they have to toast their bread. Anyway, it was really good. I think the sandwich was better because of it.  The sandwich also had lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and I added hot peppers. It came with a drink and bag of chips.
The sandwich was great, now the problem. 
When I was paying for my meal, I assumed they had lemonade. When I didn&#39;t see at the soda fountain I then noticed they had fresh squeezed lemonade. When I returned to ask the girl if I can have lemonade, her reply was it&#39;s going to cost you more and I don&#39;t have time. Listen, I don&#39;t have an issue paying more. But don&#39;t tell me you don&#39;t have time. So I sat down and had my lunch. Not going to make a big deal about it, because I will not be coming back! She came by later when it slowed down, and asked if I still wanted the lemonade. My reply was no, I don&#39;t have the time.

I had never had their food before so I was excited to try it. I get there and there are two people ahead of me and 2 people behind the counter, one taking orders the other making sandwiches and fries.... it took 15 minutes for a simple club sandwich. The other two people ahead of me were still waiting on their food. 

As for the sandwich, I could have eaten two of them. It was a 6 inch but had to only have the height of 1 1/2 inches. While it tasted okay, there was barely any meat or veggies on it. And I wanted it cold, it wasn&#39;t as they toast their bread. By the time I got home with it, it wasn&#39;t a cold sandwich anymore. 

I can&#39;t complain too much as it was free, but if I would have paid the 5 dollars for it, I would have been ticked.  Needless to say, they have not converted me to a customer. I&#39;ll take my money and my appetite to Jersey Mike&#39;s."

It reminds me of Five Guys, actually.  The French Fries are VERY similar too. 

The staff is so friendly I think all 4 people up front said hello and goodbye to me. My food was hot and fresh. My cheesesteak was so hot it burned my mouth and lap.  (I ate in my work van) This isn&#39;t a complaint. I love my food this hot. 

As I&#39;m eating it all and get halfway through, I begin to realize why it was so expensive. This is a lot of food! I can barely finish my sandwich and the fries are a lost cause at this point.  If you want fries, get the smallest size sandwich. I&#39;m a pig and this is just too much.

I ordered the chicken Philly with provolone which was pretty good and not lacking in meat and cheese. The fries were tasty too.  The prices were fair and the service was friendly.

Order at one register at the front of the store and walk 25 feet to pay at another register,  then be prepared to wait.  I REALLY love the chicken teriyaki sandwich.  It&#39;s great! 

The fries... every time I get them, they are different in some way.  Either overcooked,  or re-heated from an old order that was sitting in the tray waiting for the next customer.  Only once have I ever had properly cooked fries.  They make a big deal about how they are fresh cut and cooked in peanut oil (I  think), but if they are butchered in the fries or re-heated old fries, then what&#39;s the point?  Only average fries, at best. 

The long wait is what puts me off.  I will go back again and again, but I need to do so when I&#39;m not with the rest of my family.  They will not tolerate the long wait for simple food.

i dont really understand the hype with penn station. The only thing about interior that caught my attention was the flat screen tv...i didnt understand why a tv was in a sandwich store....but i found out it helped make waiting for a sandwich bearable....

We ordered 2 subs and it took 20 mins....20mins for 2 subs?...NO GRILL INVOLVED...we ordered basic chicken and tuna salad subs and it took 20mins....THATS UNFORGIVEABLE...two cold subs shouldn&#39;t take almost half an hour...there is no excuse...thats Olive garden wait time....its took us about 5 mins to order and walk to the other register to pay...then we had to wait for about 20mins...we basically spent 30mins in the store....there was a couple seated before we got there...they got their food a few minutes before us...they had to have been waiting for over 30mins...it wasnt even busy...it was a slow sunday afternoon and there were only 3 other customers in the store....there were 3 employees behind the counter....20 to 30 mins wait time is unreasonable....even gourmet burgers at high end restaurants dont take that long...

The layout is weird...they take your order at one cash register and then you have to walk 20 feet to another cash register to pay...whats the point of that?...all this for a simple sandwich?...

In all honesty, we chose the chicken and tuna subs because we wanted to taste their craft.....most places make their own tun and chik salad from scratch so we wanted to taste their skills.....both were on the same level as subway...we didnt smell or taste anything special....but i guess we paid for waiting and watching tv .....those 2 subs cost us 23$...UNBELIEVABLE.

For the same taste and quality AT A CHEAPER PRICE, we could have gone to subway or jimmy johns. We wouldnt have waited 20mins either.....those subs werent even foot longs...we could have gone to apple bees or chillis and bought 2 meals for 9.99 each......I JUST DONT UNDERSTAND HOW 2 SUBS COST 23$.....can someone please explain to me how 2 basic subs with small fries and 2 small drinks cost 23$?

The only good thing about this place is that they serve french fries.

Our fries were not fresh.

.....after waiting that long, a &#34;hookup&#34; with hot fresh french fries would be nice....they didn&#39;t think so.

Penn Station is a new type of Sub shop that is trying to come into the Chicago market. Originally from the East coast, it now wants to compete against Subway, Potbelly and now Jersey Mike&#39;s Subs.

This past July 4th, I traveled to Bolingbrook to hang out with some friends who actually live in Naperville. For the record, the friends own a neighborhood Jersey Mike&#39;s near I work. We wanted to check out the competition, as it were.

At first glance at the menu, all I saw was &#34;Philly Steak&#34; kind of sandwiches -- not really what I was looking for ...but I didn&#39;t have much choice after the long drive from the Metra stop to this store location; luckily I scanned the menu more and found what I wanted - a &#39;simple&#39; cold club sandwich.  I chose the 8&#34; size of sandwich because I wanted something more than a 6&#34; but nothing like a 10&#34;.

The ordering process was a little confusing - you place the order up front on one register -- then you move down to the other register and and pay there. I noticed that the actual kitchen area takes up a good 30-40% of space in the store. It does leave room for chairs and tables -- but almost as if those were an afterthought.  It&#39;s not a tight squeeze, but the as I said the kitchen area takes up much store space.

The actual sandwich had taste, but it wasn&#39;t much to &#34;write home about.&#34; I did enjoy the slightly toasted bread, however. One extra treat is that PSECS has fresh-cut fries. that was a treat, but pricey at $3.25 for a medium.

I did notice that the person putting together the sandwiches wasn&#39;t even wearing gloves...not sure what they means, but I think they should be wearing gloves when preparing food.

Lastly - the whole placing the order and getting/ paying your order process TAKES WAY TOO LONG. I think I waited at least 10 minutes for my sandwich to be made after I placed the order. I noticed as I was finally eating, I looked back and there was a sea of people (8 at least) waiting for their food after they paid.

Overall, with the fries, sandwich and drink, I paid $12.68. about $2.00 too much in my book.

FINAL SAY:
Would I go back? Probably not. - just seems too pricey and takes too long to process."

They were handling money, rags, etc and still touching the meat, cheese, bread. The other bad part was that there are glove boxes there, but they are choosing not to bother with them.

I got 2 10 inch Philly cheese steaks and 3 small fries 26 dollars wow the sandwiches are about as filling as a Jimmy Johns slim sandwich!! Also got turned off because they do not use gloves  to prepare food yikes  again I also waited almost 25 min for 2 sandwiches and french fries!! Overall the sandwiches were ok but had alot  better! 10 inch sandwich was like eating a 5 inch sandwich and way too expensive!! Fat Rickey&#39;s in Plainfield gives you the bomb for a cheaper price and have a huge selection of sandwiches and great pizza plus the owner there wants to.get to know the customers at Penn Station they don&#39;t say a word to you they stare at you like they have no knowledge of the food there!! I guess if we were in Philly or New Jersey the the Sandwiches would be bigger and better at a real deli.

When you walk in, there is a register where you order. However, when you attempt to pay, they tell you that you pay at the other end of the store. If it was like a Subway setup where by the time you pay, your sandwich is ready, it would make sense. However, you pay, and you wait for what seems like a long time for one sandwich. What is the point of this set up?

For the food, I&#39;ll start with what I like, the fries. 

Everything else .... not so much. I ordered a grilled veggie sandwich. They ask you a ton of questions of what you want on it. I basically ordered all that you could possibly order on the grilled veggie. The big mistake came when I said &#34;ok to put teriyaki sauce&#34;. I got home and the sandwich was DRENCHED in teriyaki. It made the bread soggy and the whole sandwich was way too salty. I was very disappointed because everything else was good."

What wasn&#39;t good was how long it took to make some sandwiches.  We walked in around 5pm, and there was one person ahead of us.  After I ordered, it took 10 minutes to make two sandwiches by 6 employees.  I&#39;m not a fan of places that train on the job.  When you open a new restaurant the goal should be to wow people with your food and service.

Soon a crowd formed near the other cashier leaving no room for anyone to stand and wait the (way too long) 15 minutes for their order.  I observed the cashier handle cash and then assisted preparing food.  VERY GROSS!  It appeared that nobody in this place knew their roles.  My first experience I had here, the food was good, but not this time.  The bread and cheese were the only good quality of their supposed famous cheese steak.  This time the steak was dry and tough.

I got a artichoke sandwich which will be my favorite for sure!! Yes my obsession with artichokes comes in here! I also got an Italian sub for tomorrow. Very good!! They kinda of toast the sandwiches like they do at Pot Belly. They also had hand cut french fries in 3 different huge sizes! Good job offering the coupon because that was an added incentive to get me in there. Now I will come all the time, especially since it&#39;s right across the street!

The location is right within a mile of a dozen other decent fast-casual restaurants, so I was leery of spending $5-10 on a mediocre meal when I have so many choices.      I was pleased to get a coupon to be able to try it out.  I&#39;ve long searched for a decent Philly cheese steak.  I&#39;ve had so many terrible ones at other places I had pretty much given up.  I think growing up in Chicago with access to really good Italian beef sandwich&#39;s has made me fussy about by beef.  

When I walked in the employees seemed to almost purposely ignore me for a minute or two.  I know they were busy, but a quick greeting would have been nice.  They took my order and it took about 5-7 minutes to get my sandwich with two people ahead.    On their menu I saw the options for onions, mushrooms, peppers, and pizza sauce.  Pizza sauce seemed silly on a cheese steak, but I googled it and found out its quite popular in Philadelphia, so I ordered it.   They don&#39;t just throw the pizza sauce on the sandwich but cook it with the meat first.   They fill the 6&#34; up with  meat and toppings and it was more than enough.   They use real cheese and the mushrooms were thick cut along with the peppers and grilled onions.  The touch of pizza sauce was fantastic on it.   It added something that really brought everything together.  I will never have a cheese steak without the pizza sauce again.  The fries were good (very much like Five-Guy&#39;s).    It can get expensive (much like other restaurants) when you add fries and a drink.  I will definitely come back for more Philly cheese steaks with pizza sauce."

We ordered traditional fajitas, our opinion of a true test of Mexican restaurant. They were average. Nothing spectacular but not bad. Served with rice, beans, pico, guacamole, sour cream and flour tortillas. We also asked for shredded cheese.
Overall the food was average. 
Service was slightly above average. 
Cost of meal was average. 
Atmosphere was average, a little loud due to openness of restaurant but not annoying.

The only flaw, no flan or chorrzo desserts (you can purchase them for an additional charge and, the flan  at $7 is worth every bite. In fact, some of the best!) Tip for cozymels content management team; the wording you are using to advertise your Sunday Buffet with bottomless mimosas comes across as easy to misunderstand;  please make clear that champagne and mimosas are NOT included in the Sunday Buffet pricing. Also, I&#39;d like to suggest that you do add the flan and chorrzo in mini versions and have a one champagne or mimosa offering included in your Sunday Brunch.

To start the waiter brought chips and salsa which were both fresh. Tortilla chips felt warm as if they were just made fresh. The salsa was mild but authentic and the waiter even brought us a spicy version which could put spicy thrill seekers to the test. 

We split the chipotle chicken fajitas which were unique and delightful. The chicken was well marinated and came with melted cheese on top with an interesting choice of onion rings to top it off.

#1 margaritas. 
#2 Chipotle ckn Fajitas. 
#3 Salsa (chips too!).
#4 Fast Fast service (good thing if you&#39;re hungry).
#5 Desert (Try the Banana one, you&#39;ll die, omg good).
#6 Tortilla Soup (Home-made you can tell, best ever!)
#7 Fire place room
#8 Huge guacamole app! like totally worth it!
#9 Margarita Monday&#39;s (the house marg is so good!)
#10 Onion rings on their fajitas!! 

By the way...I can&#39;t believe all the negative comments about Cozy&#39;s, I love Mexican food, I&#39;m from Texas, so I&#39;ve had my fair share, and dude, it&#39;s good. Above average! 

The comments below about their one time bathroom ordeal and the way they take names down at the hostess stand, Comm&#39;on y&#39;all!? you&#39;re kidding right?
and their wait staff??...they&#39;re nice, and fast, what did you expect? an Olympic genius runway model to wait on you? please y&#39;all...Have you ever waited tables? Try it before you judge. K. Thanks.  
People who only give one star for something so minute and clearly a fluke incident should have to tell us who they are &amp; what they do at the bottom of their comment so business owners and potential customers can get a feel for their credibility of their comment... Like do you bartend at a trendy restaurant in the city? or are you a pseudo hipster wannabe living off Mommy and Daddy&#39;s money? y&#39;all know what I mean, I know you do. Lol. 

Also, if you negative commenters had that big of an issue with anything, get your game face on and say something to management while you&#39;re eating there...Yelp, I can promise you- will not fix your issue. 

million $$$ Idea: 
if bathroom out of paper? tell someone.
if waitress did something bad? tell manager.
if your salsa wasn&#39;t filled quick enough? take it to bartender and go get some more.

Conclusion,
Unhappy people with 2 thumbs say negative stuff on Yelp...
But people in medical school who like to procrastinate studying and write long positive comments on Yelp, yes like me, Lol, lead a much happier life, I&#39;d bet my career on it. (for the record, I&#39;m not living off parents money, instead your tax dollars are loaning me my education, so thanks y&#39;all!!! I&#39;ll pay you back, I promise. :) ) 

Yours truly, 
A big fan of CozyMels"

Cozymel&#39;s is a frequent stop for meeting out with friends or a casual dinner out with my husband when we&#39;re in the mood for eating waaaay too many chips and salsa and drinking waaaay too many margaritas.

The location is fantastic (right in Danada, near Naper and Butterfield) and convenient for meeting out. Huge parking lot with plenty of space, even on busy weekends. The building is cool - lots of seating, and very &#34;Mexican Restaurant,&#34; which as you may or may not know  is scientifically proven to make tacos taste better. I&#39;ve been coming here for quite a few years now, and their prices did go up about a year or so ago, but they&#39;re still fair for what you get. The chips and salsa is fab, but I always get a big bowl of queso to go along with it. For a good time, you cannot beat a giant bowl of cheese. I&#39;d also highly recommend their taco plates, with the guajillo chicken being my favorite. They do offer lunch specials and will do an expedited order if you have to get back to work in a hurry. They have a nice bar selection as well, if you do NOT have to get back to work in a hurry ;)

If you&#39;re craving some Mexican food and haven&#39;t been here yet, you should give them a try. I was able to find a few web coupons by searching online ($5 off $25) so check that out. And they do also offer an eClub for birthdays and such, which you can sign up for on their website."

First of all the booking and process of hosting a party at Cozys was excellent. The general manager Kyle did a fantastic job and his staff was equally impressive. They made every accommodation that we requested, simple stuff such as a gift and sweets table. Room for a Dj and allowing us extra time to set up and stay. These are things that are normally included in banquet halls but often times require additional fees, not at Cozymels. They wanted the business and it showed. The attentiveness of the staff was great and they communicated every aspect from the timing of the food to how many pitchers we needed. 
This was a special surprise celebration and Kyle and his staff helped me pull it off. The cost was reasonable, better than many locations and the food was delicious and well prepared. The drinks were equally tasty. I couldn&#39;t of asked for better. Thank you Kyle and team for a wonderful afternoon and evening!"

I&#39;ve never had bad salsa or margaritas (hoping not to jinx myself) from a restaurant, and what makes places better than others is the menu.

My friend and I came on a Monday night, for ($3! Woo!) Margarita Monday. We were both expecting to get a few, but WOW, our house/lime margarita was strong and we ended up with our initial one. It tasted like tequila- the way that I like to make my drinks. I&#39;ve ordered corona-itas that tasted weaker than this. Amazing start! 

I got the portobello fajitas for $14. DAUMN. The mushroom caps were huge, there were plenty of peppers, and the plate was well worth the $14! ONE PROBLEM: it has SO MUCH OIL. Whyyyyyy? I took a bunch of napkins to soak up the oil, but if the chef just used a third/half less, the dish would have been perfection. When I was full I still had enough left for lunch tomorrow and continued to soak up the oil before taking the left overs home. Same with my friend, her fajitas were drenched in oil too (perhaps even more since she had protein), and she proceeded to pat off her food with napkins. 

It&#39;s a shame, this place could have been 4.5 stars (with service, drinks, large portions) but the food wasn&#39;t quite there."

Average Mexican restaurant. Food is not traditional Mexican, more of a standard Americanize version of one. Has all the standard plates you&#39;d expect, just not very spicy, tasty, or inventive. 

Food portions are small, as such the prices are higher than at first glance. Had the 2 taco platter. The tortillas were the 2nd smallest tortillas I&#39;ve ever seen, but that&#39;s a previous review. They hold maybe an ounce or two of meat in them. Had black beans as a side, they were inedible. They were either seasoned too much to make them taste smoky or they were burnt. Only reason I had more than one taste I was curious which one it was. The chips tasted like grocery store chips from a bag and the salsa, bland. The margaritas are average. Better off visiting one of the several other restaurants in the area"

Cozymel&#39;s was nothing short of fantastic. We will for sure be dining here again. The food was well worth the money, and incredibly reasonable at that. The service was outstanding, and oh, did I mention the food?  One more time, then. The. Food. 
 My boyfriend and I decided to have a date night, so we drove around and eventually settled on Cozymel&#39;s. Being that my boyfriend and I both tend to be indecisive, we couldn&#39;t decide what we wanted, so we enlisted the help of our server, Dontrell. We asked which of two dishes he preferred. I was debating between the Carne Asada and the Pork Rostisado, and my boyfriend couldn&#39;t decide if he wanted the Yucatan Especial or the Pork Rostisado as well. Dontrell told us his favorite dish was the Yucatan Especial, but the Pork Rostisado was &#34;insanely great.&#34; After ordering those two dishes, we wondered if he was just saying that because it was required of him to boast about the dishes. Alas, he did not lie. I&#39;ve never heard my boyfriend describe a dish in such detail before. The way he went on and on about how amazing it was, and the look of sheer pleasure on his face as he delighted in every mouthful, carefully savoring every single bite...I simply had to try it. Although I don&#39;t eat shrimp, I must say it was truly delectable. It was a delightful mix of flavors, colors, and textures. Creamy, savory, and absolutely scrumptious! 
 Next was my meal, the Pork Rostisado. Again, the mixture of flavors was both exciting and comforting. The grilled vegetables were cooked to perfection, spiced with something I couldn&#39;t put my finger on but was nonetheless delightful. And the pork! Oh my goodness, the pork. It was so flavorful, and wonderfully cooked. It fell apart just as pork should, and was so moist it felt like it was melting in my mouth, but not fatty at all. The flavor was sensational, and coupled with the rice, beans, and salsa, it was out of this world. The tortillas were homemade, and reminded me a lot of how my grandma used to make them. I have to say, I&#39;m truly excited to eat my leftovers tomorrow (and I never eat leftovers!) 
 We left Cozymel&#39;s and gushed about it the whole way home. So often when we go somewhere, it&#39;s mediocre, or disappointing in some way, but not here. From start to finish, the place was amazing. Next time I want good Mexican food (and I&#39;m a tough critic when it comes to the food of my people!) I will definitely be coming back to Cozymel&#39;s."

Located off Loop Road and next to Chickfila with ample parking. The service is always fast, patient and the food DELICIOUS! Im not very adventurous in the Mexican Cuisine area but their Tacos and Shrimp Fajita Salad are my absolute favorites! I have taken several of my colleagues here and they are much more adventurous in eating Mexican, either way they also LOVED it. I have gone here 3 days straight since the weather has broke. 

I also love the margarita&#39;s (3.00 Monday&#39;s!) all great and not watered down. The Mango is a favorite,

I suggest going even if just during a lunch break or a simple curbside pick up if you want great quality. They understand time restraints and still provide EXCELLENT customer service."

We were sat right away and our server helped us as soon as we set down. He seemed like he really didn&#39;t want to be there calling us &#34;dude&#34; and &#34;buddy&#34;.  He seemed to casual. We ordered drinks and were hoping to have a few. We decided to order our appitizer and entree at the same time, thinking that the app would come out first. Which it did, but two minutes after it hit the table our entrees came out. We both were ki da confused. My husband who is a former waiter was confused.

We felt like we were bring rushed. He brought us take home containers when we were still clearly eating was strange. Then when we received our bill he made change right in front of us. Which was really confusing to me. Later my husband said it was really rude.

I had the fish tacos which were great and flavorful. Nicely spiced. They were small though. My husband had a burrito and he thought it was basic. 

I do really love this place, I hope this was just an off night. I will try back again and update."

I went here for dinner for the first time a few weeks ago at 4:30 - within the hour this place was packed so key is to get in early.  I&#39;ve been to mexican restaurants where they make the guac at the table, but I&#39;m usually there with someone who isn&#39;t a fan of guac.  I was in luck with this visit and I must say it was awesome!!!  I don&#39;t even think I tried the salsa but the chips were good as well.

I ordered a margarita with my dinner - both were great.  I got a combo where I had a tamale, taco, and taquito.  The service was very good, and very fast.

The corn tortilla chips were served warm and very lightly salted. The Table-side Guacamole was excellent!  

I ordered the Yucatan Especial. It was very good. Bay scallops with medium shrimp in a cream sauce that included onions, spinach &amp; tomatoes. Also served with their Mexican rice (cooked with seasoning and sweet corn kernels).

The beans and rice were cold and tasteless. The food is Americanized and doesn&#39;t have an authentic Mexican taste.

I recently moved here from California, and am still looking for really good Mexican food. While the food was OK here, the atmosphere was not.

First of all, even though they seem to have a very nice dining room, the girl at the front desk walked us through the bar to a distant booth.  We had music blaring from the ceiling along with the football game from the various TV&#39;s, so catching up with my son about his trip was impossible.

The waiter, who was either very tired/hungover/suffering from an eye condition greeted us with &#34;Hi, I&#39;m (???).  How&#39;s it hangin&#39;?&#34;  After he brought our drinks, he announced that he was workin&#39; the late shift and would be hangin&#39; around to get our order.  He then asked if he should &#34;slam down&#34; our soups before he brought the rest of our meal.

I don&#39;t consider myself old and stuffy.  I grew up in CA in the 60&#39;s.  But when I lay down that kind of money for ridiculously small portions, and the server depends on my tip to supplement his income, I would at least expect him to have a passing knowledge of how to speak to people over 20."

The positive? A delicious tequila infused drink and a yummy flauta.

The bad? Each one of their servers looks like a member of the Backstreet Boys. I am all for pretty boys serving me food; however, it was impossible to tell them apart. This resulted in constant debating over which server was ours when we needed something. Since the service was just horrible, we spent most of the meal this way. 

The in-between? This is what I consider American Mexican. Really, I might as well go to Taco Bell when I want AmMex. Give it some more flavor and spice and I would be all over this joint.

I have had the opportunity to go back several times in the past few weeks while taking a class nearby.  The first time i had some gourmet tacos.  They were a little smaller than I would have expected and they were  ok.  I do enjoy the fresh tortillas.  The flavors didn&#39;t burst as I was hoping but that is my personal taste.  It seemed like the ingredients were fresh.  I had a Mango Margarita which was very good. 

The second visit, I tried a combo plate, I enjoyed the pablano chile cream enchilada and the chicken flautas.  I also had the pork tamales.  I think i would have liked them without the sauce on top, again, a matter of personal preference, but they were ok.

For the money and my personal taste, I would go back for the margaritas and some appetizers and to sit outdoors for that southwest feel.  

The restaurant seemed to be pretty busy for a Wednesday night and our server was kind.

I was a little surprised when the bus staff dropped and broke a glass on our table, Glass shattered everywhere and water all over (while he was attempting to clean off a table nearby) soaking my friend.  The waiter asked if all was ok and brought a clean towel for her to dry off with...but the manager NEVER came to the table, as close as he came was to put a &#34;caution&#34; tent on the water left on the floor right next to her.  I was thinking maybe a personal check in with the manager, or a comp of a little something, or a coupon to return would be appropriate.

Worth a try if you like a good margarita and fresh chips and salsa."

We were driving around when I spotted the brightly colored building with a cute name and I wanted to stop!  It was lunch time the day after Christmas and the place was empty.  The good thing about this was that we were seated quickly.  We hoped that since we were one of the few tables with plenty of servers the service would be good, however it pretty much sucked.

We were brought the chips and salsa, which were delicious.  The chips came out super salty (this became a theme... and I love salt!) and warm.  However, when I went to pick up another chip and instead I grabbed a warm beer cap.  I pulled it out and wasn&#39;t going to say anything.  Then, my sister picked up her water and fished a chunk of something out of it.  Even after doing that, there was still stuff floating in it.  She didn&#39;t want me to complain... but that was disgusting and we already ordered our food so we could not get up and leave!

I waved the waiter over... he seemed to be avoiding us. I showed him the beer bottle cap and the floating chunks in the water... he just apologized and brought her a new water and I had to ask for new chips.  i figured he should know if someone is throwing stuff in the chip warmer.  I don&#39;t even think he apologized.

When our food arrived, it was super salty as well.  I thought the food was just okay.  Nothing special and definitely overpriced for  what you get.  My sister thought the food was kinda gross and would not even finish it.

I will not be returning!"

After you do that you&#39;re transformed into a contemporary middle eastern place. Nice smooth groove electronic music the place has great branding and a great atmosphere. I went for the everything platter. It was delicious. Make sure they take off your free falafel after you check in at the register. I almost got hosed. The combo is either pita chips and no drink or potato chips and a drink- that was definitely a wtf moment for me. Check the menu in advance. It can get pricey quick. Many middle eastern folks eating here which is always a good sign and the atmosphere was light, contemporary and happy. 
The food was very good but again- that price. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s better Han some of the other amazing places I&#39;ve been to in this area but to be fair the Mediterranean food all around this area has been very good. I&#39;d recommend. Take a friend!"

Sorry had to declare that initially I&#39;m sure this place is awesome in person but put simply they lost my order I placed with them through their website. Very odd since I called them on the phone to confirm that they got the order initially (since I&#39;m the host of the work event I wanted to confirm) and they told me &#34;Yes we got your order and will be preparing it for delivery shortly&#34;. Only an hour later we were still wondering what was going on, only to call and have a different person pick it up and could not find the order.

Sorry, maybe I will try this place in real time by driving there but perhaps at a discount for the huge inconvenience they caused me and my group today.

I did not receive anything like the pictures people have here on Yelp.  If I wasn&#39;t at work I could post a picture.  What I got for a Plate was a cup of hummus, a few onions and a little cup of chicken shawarma. That is a joke for the price.  And the guy did not tell me about the rice.  I did not see any rice out so I did not order.  The chicken pieces that I got were sometimes questionable and more thigh then breast.  

Not impressed with paying $9 and not getting enough food.  Maybe they need to get their act together regarding advising people about their menu.  The counter guy kept trying to get me to add on to the toppings.  Why don&#39;t you give me the base food correctly or enough rather than trying to have me load on the other stuff.  And the cut up lettuce was disgusting!   It was brown edges and actually looked slimy.

I want the plate that I see here, not a joke that I got of questionable meat.  Could care less it is cage free, grain fed antibiotic. There was no taste to this meat at all.  I couldn&#39;t tell you what seasoning or if any was on there.  And I am married to a Persian, so I know this food.

Last complaint - the meat was cold!  It is over 90 degrees out there and my meat is cold.  That is not acceptable.

Not impressed with this place at all.   Called to complain, told the manager left for the day.  It is only 330pm.  I will take my money and try out Naf Naf next.  Too bad they don&#39;t have a Pita Inn around here."

Possibly best falafel I&#39;ve ever tasted. It was actually MOIST. Full of cilantro and parsley as it should be. Chicken shawarma off the hook. Meat is very tender and well-seasoned. Only wish there were more of it in my pita! But I can&#39;t knock them a star for that! To me it&#39;s all about quality and not quantity. This place is as good if not better than naf naf. Of course it is run by natives. Not sure exactly where they were from. Jordan? Lebanon? Doesn&#39;t matter. Food rocked. See now, why can&#39;t the world get along with people from the Middle East? I think if more Americans actually ate middle eastern food, they&#39;d be more tolerant of the culture and not call them all terrorists. These are peace loving people just trying to serve good food. 

Ok Yelp. Don&#39;t put this one the &#34;reviews not recommended&#34; because I&#39;m seemingly getting political. I&#39;m actually trying to encourage ethnic and religious tolerance. If you do, I&#39;ll call CNN. Lol. Kidding. I love Yelp. Cheers"

This platter comes with 3 kinds of meat chicken, gyro &amp; steak served over a bed of yellow rice.  It also comes with sides like tabouli, red cabbage, red onions &amp; feta cheese.  

This platter is a large portion of food.  I have been losing weight so instead of eating the whole thing I ate half and took the rest home for another meal. 

The chicken was delicious cooked with the skin crisped and cut up shawarma style.  The steak seasoned nicely.  It was cut up in kabob pieces and a decent quality of meat.  The yellow rice served as a bed for the meats, but didn&#39;t have any seasoning that stood out.  The red cabbage added a nice crunch and texture to the meal.  The food was very good.

I don&#39;t know if the baklavas are really vegan or not.

On the website under take out menu; http://www.idreamoffalafel.com/menu/cyo/
It states that the baklava is vegan and I asked the young lady behind the counters today if they&#39;re vegan and she asked another gentleman and he confirmed that they are as the board indicates indeed vegan. However, on the website under nutritional value;
http://www.idreamoffalafel.com/wp-content/themes/IDOF/pdfs/idof-nutrition-facts-oct-2014.pdf
The baklava does not have the vegan sign ; &#34;V&#34;. 
I would like to sort this out as soon as possible. Allergic reactions cause serious medical issues and business owners are responsible for relaying accurate information to their consumers. If a menu item is indicated as vegan and a consumer who is highly allergic to dairy consumes it, they face significant medical issues and there goes a legal lawsuit for your business.  I would like answers regarding this issue soon. 

Are your baklavas really vegan and if yes, why is it not marked as &#34;V&#34; under nutritional values??

Entering the restaurant, there was a pretty nasty smell of something rotten drowned out by the smell of bleach or some other strong cleaning agent. Not the kind of smell you want in a food establishment, but I figured I&#39;d come to try it and I wasn&#39;t leaving.
I ordered a steak kebab wrap. They guy went to make it and noticed they were out of steak. So I ordered a chicken shawarma with everything on it. Checkout was smooth and I was in and out  in under 5min, so props on the speed of service. Unfortunately though, the food quality and freshness earned no props. The vegetables were dry and had no real defining flavor to them - definitely not fresh. The sauce felt very unhealthy, but the actually bad part was the quality of the chicken. It was dry (while still oily), overcooked, and had really tough bits that made the whole wrap a bit of a minefield to navigate: never knowing if you&#39;ll end up with an average bite, or something really tough and bad tasting. Only real positive I can say of the wrap was that the wrap part itself was pretty decent.
The main conclusion I got out of this was that I&#39;ll stick to my main mediterranean places in this area, Naf Naf Grill and Pinched, where I&#39;ve never had a problem with freshness or low quality and poorly cooked meat. I was hoping I might like IDOF more so that I could save a buck on what looked like a pretty big wrap, but I&#39;d rather pay a buck more for a hummus bowl or other meal at Naf Naf or Pinched down the street if that means fresher and better ingredients."

i DO dream of falafel! I mean shawarma.

Love this place, mostly. First off: It&#39;s middle eastern fast casual. A chipotle-type experience, but with different cuisine. I looove the chicken shawarma, baba ghanoush (with olive oil plz!), sumac onions, tabouleh... saffron rice I would love more if they used a thinner, more fine rice, but it&#39;s still pretty nice. Oh yah, that garlic sauce is dreamy.

I would give this place 5 stars, but the consistency is a bit iffy-- some visits have been fresher than others, the saltiness wavers as well (i like things a little more salty). If you try it once and aren&#39;t impressed, try a time or few more. Whenever I&#39;m in Oak Brook for shopping etc I try and stop in for a meal. I&#39;m hard to please, but this is pretty great."

It joins a host of others (Naf Naf Grill, Falafill, Benjyehuda, and Pinched Mediterranean Grill etc.) in this category. I enjoyed my meal quite a lot, though I think it would have been better to dine in - as the cool/cold toppings quickly cool the protein off, making everything lukewarm.

This is an order at the counter then guide them through the toppings-type place (like its Mexican spiritual ancestor, Chipotle Grill. The toppings guy was pretty brusque with me, but I&#39;ll chalk it up to a busy lunch service. My check-in triggered a free order of falafel, which was awesome. Thanks IDOF.

On to the food:

Create your own Wrap:
The wrap comes with a &#34;base&#34; layer of hummus - other options give you more than one base. My protein was Doner Kebab, something I miss greatly from my trips to Germany, where it has a reputation for ummm.... being good for late night noshing. I topped it with sumac onions, cucumber and tomato salad, and tzaziki. I asked for IDOF hot sauce, and got a healthy squirt. They put it into a panini press to brown the outside a bit, then it was ready to serve. The flavor of the Doner was excellent, and this particular combo of toppings and sauce seemed to work really well. On the whole, this sandwich rocked.

Side of Falafel:
It would have been nice to have some sort of dipping sauce for the Falafel, but they had quite a bit of flavor on their own. They were well-seasoned and still had a little bit of moisture inside - no crumbling. I thought these Falafel were very nicely prepared.

I&#39;ll definitely come back here when I&#39;m in the neighborhood. Perhaps I&#39;ll come at the very beginning of lunch service, when it&#39;s not too crowded yet, and the ingredients are all really fresh."

We also tried their falafel. The falafel wasn&#39;t piping hot and fresh, but we still loved the flavors and the crispyness. So so good.

Then checked the customer out. Then scratch her nose again (though using a different motion. More like a pinching the open nares move). And then walk back to where I was and start putting on gloves. Except I stopped her. And asked her to wash her hands because she touched her nose. She said &#34;well I had gloves on&#34;. &#34;Well yes, but you wiped your nose with your gloves on. Then wiped your nose without your gloves on.&#34; So she took off her gloves, walked over to the sink and literally ran her hands under the water for 5 seconds.

Another review mentioned the sweet potato falafel was green--you have to specify which you want (regular or sweet potato) and they don&#39;t always have it but it&#39;s yummy! Kind of like the sweet potato fries you always wanted but never get. 

Service was very friendly. We&#39;ll be back."

Drove 20 mins to this place for steak shawarma, only to find out it was discontinued. I ordered a pita sandwich instead with chicken shawarma, hummus, and taboola in it. The chicken was pretty good. I don&#39;t recommend their hummus at all. I also got an order of falafels, and they were really good.

I was expecting a much better experience, and was disappointed.

Service:
The person working the counter wasn&#39;t rude or anything, but just wasn&#39;t very helpful. My husband used the word &#34;incompetent.&#34; 

Ambience:
The restaurant smelled nasty, we almost walked out. It&#39;s very casual, almost like any other fast food place. There&#39;s plenty of space, and it&#39;s pretty clean.

There are 3 spreads to pick from. Tahini, red pepper tahini and something else. They have some organic ingredients too. There were some extra charge toppings like the garbanzo beans, tomato, cilantro and other stuff in it (I got that)- really fresh and tasty.

Empty @ 3:45 ish and no one behind the counter. (Maybe elsewhere prepping food?) The ingredients looked fresh. A few minutes later a kid comes out. He made some fresh falafels for me. I asked for garlic sauce, so he added it on there. All is well.

Except, um, my total: $10 and some change. Really?!

My wrap was good but wrapped kinda loose. The sauces were VERY watery, so my wrap had one soggy part. Meh. No likey. Cookies are always good.

I dunno if the place is poppin&#39; during lunch hour or what, but the execution and price point were a bit much for me.

I&#39;ve had every iteration you can think of chewed and swallowed year after year. I&#39;m always down to try a new schawarma place, in hopes that it would be a new favourite, but honey, this ain&#39;t it.

I went here with my friend for dinner and ordered a create-your-own plate, which consisted of baba ganoush, spring mix, chicken &#34;schawarma&#34;, tzatzki salad, tabbouleh, kalamata olives and hot sauce. My friend got a falafel wrap. 

You see the quotes up there? This was not schawarma. It lacked that spicy sweet taste that I have grown to love and tasted like generic grilled chicken that you&#39;d get at a food court. The tabbouleh had giant jagged pieces of parsely, the tzatzki salad tasted like it was made with heavy whipped cream, and the hot sauce tasted like taco sauce. Really, the only things they got right were the olives and the spring mix. The baba ganoush was decent, but I&#39;ve not had a lot of experience with that to tell you otherwise.

My friend&#39;s falafel wrap looked like a Chipotle burrito. She said it was good, but it ended up giving her the same uh... intestinal distress that Chipotle is often known for later.

Not going here again. Sorry, guys."

And when you check in on yelp you get a free order of falafel :). Tons of options! Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re vegan, vegetarian, organic only, low carbing, low fatting, paleo, or a carnivore!

Setup: Set up &#34;chipotle&#34; style. Meaning everything is assembled fresh for you EXACTLY how you want it. You can either create your own (CYO) rice plate, salad plate, wrap or plate in general. If for example you want to CYO plate (arguably the most customizable), then this is how it works:

A) Bases: you get to pick two bases (regular hummus, red pepper hummus, baby spinach, spring mix salad leaves, chickpea quinoa salad, baba ganouj/roasted eggplant spread, couscous or saffron rice). You can definitely add more bases for 75 cents extra each base. The portions are quite generous!

B) Protein: 1 protein choice (falafel, chicken shawarma, doner kebab, steak shawarma). Extra protein is $2.25 each and again, generous portions! All their shawarmas are vertically slow fire roasted-- always delicious and juicy!

C) Toppings: Pick three! (Tabouli Quinoa salad, cabbage slaw, tzatziki salad, green olives, pickles, DELICIOUS sumac onions, romaine lettuce, or cucumber tomato salad). All options are delicious but my favorites are the sumac onions and tabouli quinoa salad. Extra toppings at 75 cents each

D) Sauces: you can easily get these on the side if you don&#39;t want to commit. 4 options! IDOF hot sauce (ITS HOT.), spicy tomato, garlic and tahini. Feel free to try all of them on the side especially if you have never been here before-- they&#39;re more than willing to accommodate! My favorite is definitely the tahini sauce and the IDOF hot sauce IF and only if you try it in conjunction with food.

Other food items: stuffed grape leaves, lentil soups, in house made pita chips, in house made Kennebec potato chips, baklavas, artisan bottled drinks-- and more stuff that I&#39;m definitely forgetting off the top of my head

&#34;But what if I don&#39;t want to CYO? I&#39;M LAZY!&#34; No worries! they have a pre picked menu (&#34;Chef Inspired&#34;) where you can choose from &#34;Vegan Dream&#34; a selection of all of their yummy vegan options, &#34;All in one platter&#34; which gives you a taste of almost everything on their menu, &#34;Mediterranean Chicken Salad&#34;-- the name is pretty self explanatory, and other things. Don&#39;t worry, whatever your mood, IDOF&#39;s got you!

Staff: Always a pleasure being served by them. Even when they&#39;re totally backed up they work as fast as they can with a smile and a sense of humor. On one occasion a couple months back the line was a little longer than usual (nothing that bothered me though), and the manager made it a point to come out and extend his apologies for the wait, asked us how the food was and to extend us coupons for free entrees and sides upon our next visit. They are always willing to offer samples of their various sauces, meats, sides, and as mentioned they will always have that smile on their face. As opposed to the death stare that other places will give you if you asked for a measly sample, leaving you looking at them with puppy dog eyes quoting Oliver Twist when you say &#34;Please sir, I want some more&#34;. Not here! No miserliness with IDOF.
 
Notes:

1) Right next to a chipotle, a jimmy johns and noodles and company. IDOF is a great place to come to with a group of people even if they don&#39;t particularly care to try something new because they can easily bring in their meal from the neighboring restaurants in here

2) Chicken (and perhaps the rest of the meat too if I remember correctly) are all &#34;Zabiha-Halal&#34;, which for those who are wondering mean that the meat has been humanely raised, fed an all natural organic diet, and slaughtered humanely (quick, no chemicals or poisons)

3) You can order online and pick it up in store! Perfect for those rush hour/lunch days!

TL;DR: Excellent place for customized Mediterranean food on the go/sitting in. Preselected menu for those days you don&#39;t want to customize your food. Options for even the PICKIEST diets (paleo, low carbing, vegan, carnivore etc). Price is great, service is consistently excellent, and you can place your order online if its rush hour/lunch hour. Check in on yelp for a free side order of falafels!"

Then I saw the Yelp  check-in deal and got some free falafels: bonus! Short version: walked in wanting döner, walked out preferring their falafel.

Longer version: my husband and I simply adore döner kebab and Turkish food in general.  After moving to the US we have yet to find a döner close to what we are used to consuming all across Europe, juicy, spiced meat (mystery, lol) wrapped in lahmacun or pita with a sweet, creamy garlic sauce. So for us, the search is continuously on to find that dream sandwich once more.  

If you have ever had this outside of the US then you know what I am referring to, and you will know it is very difficult to find here domestically. Did this one come close? Yes, it did. The spices on the meat were very enjoyable and we really liked our sandwiches overall.  If you aren&#39;t familiar with the döner which I am describing, or with döner in general: it is spiced rotisserie meat (usually beef or chicken, compressed) which gets shaven onto a sandwich.  It is somewhat similar to Greek gyros or shawarma, but there are subtle differences (mainly in spices and cuts of meat used).  

Here, you can create your own sandwich with choice of several meats or falafel, and there are plenty of toppings.  Rice, couscous, salad, hummus, lettuce, sumac onions, tomato/cucumber salad, tahini, garlic sauce, etc.  Speaking of falafel, theirs is fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside and they have  a great, almost curry-ish flavor to them.  These are light, airy balls and they are so much better than the mostly rock-hard, heavy pucks of grease which other places sell.  

My quest for &#39;my&#39; döner still continues, but I will return for some falafel action for sure!

Lastly, do NOT follow your GPS here.  Once you get close keep your eyes peeled, they share a building and parking lot with Noodles &amp; Co, as soon as you see them, turn in immediately. Your GPS will take you around back to a parking lot which is not connected to theirs.  Trust me. we had to wade through the bushes for our food - not fun."

Additionally, the person who delivered the food was very friendly and set up the trays on our serving table for us, for convenience. We got countless compliments from guests and inquiries on where the food was from. Even the people who had a somewhat negative or indifferent opinion about IDOF before this, were pleasantly surprised and now seem to want it again!

The menu reads just like Chipotle. I didn&#39;t make that comparison at first, so I had to ask the worker a ton of questions to get me started. She was really sweet about explaining the process to me. I created my own plate and it was pretty good. Not a huge fan of the hummas, but the babaganoosh, veggies, and falafel was delicious.

It was about 3:30, a dead time for suburban food spots.

The format had changed slightly from when I was last there. Seemed like a couple fewer options, but still really good ones. Last time I had the lamb kebab wrap but lamb was off the menu now, a supplier issue. This time I got a CYO (create your own) plate for $8. Bases of a quinoa/chickpea salad and a chickpea vegetable medley were topped by tabouleh, tzatziki, doner kebab, and a cucumber/tomato salad. All were pretty delicious, the doner kebab a standout because of its rich, intense flavor. It&#39;s like a Bostonite said about a lemon donut once, &#34;you don&#39;t have to LOOK foa the flavah...the flavah&#39;s gonna find you!&#34; The creamy jalapeno sauce and the hot tomato one were fab. A great meal and portion size for about $8. Good drink selection too including Pellegrino&#39;s flavored bubbly water cans and a good ginger beer called &#34;Bruce Cost.&#34;

Since it was so slow I got to talk to the owner, one Hassan, a Pakistani gentleman of all things. He was ultra friendly and that goes a long way toward establishing a business as a spot you want to visit over and over. He has locations in Chicago which I&#39;ll definitely check out. I was deciding on a drink and the Vimto can looked interesting to me and he ended up giving me one to try later. Really nice. And he&#39;s good to his employees.

The place is well lit and ultra clean too.

The pita  seemed pretty stale - it actually started to crumble about halfway through my meal. The man with whom I was placing my order seemed to go to great lengths to &#34;skimp&#34; on all the toppings, so I pretty much ended up with a pita full of meat with a tiny amount of sauce/hummus/feta in there. I was not impressed by the sandwich, but I was pleased to receive a free side of falafel with my order because I checked in on yelp.

I was craving some protein hard core after work, and thought, &#34;mmmm beef shawarma....!!&#34; Well, they have this entree with different types of shawarma, a side of rice, falafel, salad, and if you want, hummus. My favorite salad was a chickpea one with cucumbers, tomatoes, and onions. I have never walked out of a fast food joint feeling healthy and satisfied until today. Try it.

The sign calls them sweet potato falafels - I tasted no hint of sweet potato.  They were very dry - all ingredients are green.   The toppings were not distributed throughout the pita so when I was half done, there were only falafel left.   They made up my husband&#39;s plate and then said the steak would take about 10 more minutes to be ready - so the server the put the plate to the side ...  so that it could sit for 10 minutes???  My husband asked if he could take the plate to the table and start eating and they could bring the steak to the table when it was ready.  
The steak was good, but for the rest of the meal, it was so, so.   Back to Pinched we go!
*UPDATE*   My husband became violently ill approximately 6 hours after eating at this place.  No way to know, for sure, whether it&#39;s food poisoning or a stomach virus, but we certainly will not be returning to this establishment!"

I recommend the chicken shwarma, doner kabab, lentil soup, falafels, and tadziki sauce.

They also carry some delicious bottled &#34;real ginger ales&#34; with chunks of real ginger in the bottle. It&#39;s spicy though, so heads up if your meal is also spicy. It is delicious though and in my opinion well worth the pain. :)"

My 2nd experience was not as good so I&#39;m unsure where to score this. I&#39;m not vegetarian or vegan but I have an enthusiastic amount of love for vegetables. Aside from ordering a salad every day, it&#39;s hard to find places with a variety of fresh veggies. However, I.DOF delivers on this. This has potential to be my new lunch spot. The first time we came, we ordered the vegan platter and some kind of chicken kabobs. Sometimes its hard for me to try unfamiliar things but I dove in head first. I didn&#39;t really like the baba ganoujeh, but I loved everything else on the plate. My only time trying falafel was at Subway, so I&#39;m probably not qualified at speaking to theirs versus other places. BUT I loved it! They made it fresh for us and it was one of the best things I&#39;ve ever put in my mouth. The chicken kabob was really amazing too, but I&#39;m starting to think I will stick to the falafel in the future.

I went to I.DOF again for lunch the other day and ordered the Chicken Schawarma rice plate and my husband ordered a falafel wrap. His was fuhreaking delicious and I stole more than half of his. The rice on mine was lacking flavor as was the chicken schawarma. I tried peppering it up but the chicken was still too bland and dry. Even a little butter didn&#39;t save the plate. 

Going forward, if I only order the falafel wrap or the vegan platter, it will be a 5-star lunch spot for me and will be included in my lunch rotation."

It&#39;s a big menu with a lot of options that I really appreciated, but it was tough to figure out right up front. I went with a rice plate. It came with a meat option and then three sides.  The food itself was VERY good. The portions are pretty decent as well. I went with the steak which was very well seasoned and not tough. And then the cabbage salad and sumac onions. I wish I would have tried the tahina salad but next time. Everything was fresh and tasted great. 
I was in a rush so I didn&#39;t try the falafel but I will, I&#39;m going back for certain it was very good and I want to try this doner kabab.
I&#39;d think of it like a Mediterranean chipotle. It&#39;s pretty reasonable price wise as well. Check it out. The restaurant was really colorful and had a lot of seating, I would dine in.

Anyways, I am I big fan of their wraps, whether it&#39;s chicken or steak. The tzatziki salad is a must!!! 
Eat it with your wrap, your plates, or just by itself! 

Their falafels are always crispy and flavorful. Their sauces are distinct but all wonderful. 

Why the four stars? Like Subway, I&#39;d like to add a few more toppings aside from the 3 I am only allowed to.

No.  However it was pretty darn good, and as a quick bite for dinner on the way home, it was fine.  They were nearly out of sweet potato falafel, so I got them freshly fried.  In addition to the sweet potato falafel, they have couscous (the large Israeli kind you have to soak forever, so best to have someone else make it), red pepper hummus, a variety of sauces, and pretty tasty vegetarian dolma.  Yes, the one half-piece of pita bread is a little sad for a whole vegan platter - but I&#39;m sure if I asked they&#39;d sell me more pita bread.  (How cool that they have a vegan platter!)

The nutrition calculator on-line is pretty awesome; I&#39;m sorry to discover the sweet potato falafel have 10 g of sugar per serving, so I&#39;ll probably get the regular next time.  But it&#39;s great to know.  Yes, it&#39;s high in sodium - it&#39;s pre-prepared fast casual food and at least with the calculator you can order items to minimize the damage.

It was the end of the day, and they had packed up some of their stuff. They had to unpack some things for us. I guess they thought that there wouldn&#39;t be anymore customers. 

We decided to order the platters. They come with rice, meat, and two sides. 

We ordered two chicken platters, one chicken and gyro platter, and two all in platters, we also ordered a side of felafels.

There was only one person working there that night, and she completed all five of our orders at once. It was honestly a little confusing. We went there for the first time, and didn&#39;t understand what was a part of our order. She didn&#39;t bother to explain it to us either.

She seemed a little confused by our order too.

Anyway, we eventually sat down to eat. The food was mostly a hit! The gyros taste very good, and nicely salted. The chicken and steak were grilled. They tasted pretty flavorful, but they were a little bland. I have a well-spiced palate, so I thought it could use come spicy-ness. Their safron rice was okay.

I loved their hummus it was creamy and yummy just like hummus should be! The falafel was crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. I thought it was undercooked. The manager came out and made them fresh. I guess he took them out too quickly.

I though the decoration were interesting. It seemed like they had a throwback to 1970s in mind. The chairs, tables, and logo looked like it was from that era. It is a little quirky to eat middle eastern food in place with 70s era decor.

However, a great benefit to this restaurant is that it is HALAL! It is awesome to have a chain restaurant  that is halal.

I would recommend this place. If you are tired of chipotle, noodles and company, panera or other comparable places, then check this place out!

They also have stores in downtown Chicago."

Step 1: Plate (comes with up to 3 items for the &#34;base&#34;). I got the Baba Ganoujeh, Jerusalem salad, and Tabouleh

Step 2: Doner Kebab (Turkish style seasoned meat made of 100% premium beef fire roasted on a vertical rotisserie)

Step 3: IDOF&#39;s Hot Sauce

They pile your 7&#34;W x 7&#34;L x 1&#34;H plate full of mediterranean goodness. I enjoyed the doner kebab, however I will want to try the felafel on my next trip. Beware of the IDOF Hot Sauce if you can&#39;t handle spice; although rated at 2 flames of spiciness (1 less than the spicy tomato sauce), it is unsuspectingly spicy. I enjoy eating spicy foods on a regular basis, so trust me when I say that your mouth will be on fire!

At around $8 and with a mostly healthy offering, this place is definitely worth checking out."

One time, in the drive-thru, this Burger King failed to give me my full order and I drove away without knowing that they forgot to give me many of the items that I had paid for. By then, it was too late.

Overall, very shoddy service. The food takes too long to prepare. Very shabby place near downtown Naperville. Why not go to one of the finer restaurants just a block down?"

(I won&#39;t say the world since I know there are quality variations between countries).  Being unremarkable aside from a musical theme in the seating area (?!), it&#39;s well suited for the role. 

I had a crispy Tendercrisp value meal, since they got rid of the spicy Tendercrisp sandwich at some point (why?).  The chicken wasn&#39;t itself bad.  The lettuce was limp, though; the jalapenos were shamelessly, spicelessly weak.  The fries were so small individually that there was barely anything to taste aside from the deep-fried exterior.  I know it&#39;s my fault for ordering a value meal, but I stood in despair at the soda machine wishing for something that even approximated a healthy option.  On the up side, they offer free wifi (which in a more remote or less affluent area might be a rare and valuable thing), and they had stacks of crowns free for the taking, which my 20-something brothers had a hilarious time with. 

I&#39;m normally an advocate of rating restaurants relative to what they are -- a food court shouldn&#39;t be held to the same standards as a five-star restaurants.  Maybe I should be rating Burger King against peer restaurants; I&#39;m sure against McDonalds and Wendy&#39;s and White Castle, it wouldn&#39;t be less than a three.  Still, there has to be some quality to the food -- usually I&#39;d call it tastiness -- against which you apply these different scales of flavor, value for price, tolerance for imperfections or service variations, etc.  Honestly, I didn&#39;t find any basic quality at Burger King.  I didn&#39;t enjoy it, and I actively don&#39;t want to go back -- that&#39;s my criteria for one star, so one star Burger King gets.

Now, this all may be snotty, and maybe knowing I was eating at a major fast food joint caused me to be more negative than usual.  (I&#39;d like not to think so, I always thought Burger King was better than McDonalds).  It&#39;s not the price  -- for less than the $5.67 the value meal cost, I know you can get actually good food -- check out the hallal stands in New York City, for example.  

The next time I&#39;m home and my brothers want to go to Burger King and refuse to let me look for alternatives, I&#39;m just gonna have to steal the car keys."

Breakfast being my favorite meal of the day, I&#39;ve done a lot of eating out and trying different spots. I have tried some decent places but Citrus just blew them out of the water. 
I had tried going here last summer but made it too late and they were closing. Ever since then I have been wanting to go back. It really isn&#39;t very close to me but it&#39;s not too far and yesterday I was determined to try a new breakfast place. 
We got there around 10:45 on a Sunday and the wait was 25 minutes. We drove all that way so we decided to wait. They have chairs and little couches to wait and the entry way is heated. The restaurant is very bright and colorful, decorated with Citrusy colors of yellow, orange and green. 
The wait was about 25 min. There was water at our table snd the server came over right away to get out drink orders. I went with the regular coffee but they have flavored coffee too. My boyfriend and daughter had OJ which was fresh squeezed and was delicious. 
The menu has a lot to offer and I can&#39;t wait to go try all the different dishes. I went with the Ham I Am which scrambled eggs with bits of ham, cream cheese mixture and onions. It came with breakfast potatoes that were perfect and an English muffin. My bf had the Crabby Benny snd my daughter had the chocolate chip pancake from the kids menu. My dish was so amazing that I ate the entire thing!!! The eggs were scrambled perfectly and the potatoes were full of flavor and not over cooked. 
Our sever was not hovering over us but did come by to refill my coffee and check on us a few times.  By the end of the meal I did feel a bit rushed because the hostess kept looking over our way. I understand that it&#39;s Sunday and busy so I didn&#39;t take it personal. On the way out my 3 yr old got a balloon. She was a happy toddler. 
Great quality food at a very cute diner equals a very happy foodie. I will be back this week!"

When we visited we had Plain Jane Pancakes (two nice big malty buttermilk pancakes that came out steaming) and the strawberry waffle (three nice little waffle boats filled with sliced strawberries). Both dishes were done to order and served hot and fresh. The coffee was especially good and free flowing. 

Since it is named The Citrus Diner you have to try the orange juice...it was very good and you won&#39;t be disappointed...you can even order it by the carafe for your whole table. Next time we are by we&#39;ll try the brunch/lunch items. This is a good place worth returning to."

However, everyone else seemed to have really tasty looking sandwiches that I would like to try as well. Others have ordered &#34;avalon sunset&#34; or &#34;honey bear&#34; sandwiches. The first time we got it, they came with fries. 

The next time, the rep brought a plate of sandwiches. I had half a burrito wrap which was amazing! Unfortunately by the time I got to the platter, there was only one half left. I would&#39;ve liked to eat a full order. They came with their sweet potato and regular potato hand cut potato chips. I could eat a whole bag of those by myself.

First impression upon walking in was fresh, clean and bright. You just feel happy when you walk in because you&#39;re surrounded by a yellow, orange and green theme. How can you not feel happy with that color scheme?!

Bf ordered the Lean Machine, and I ordered the Crabby Benny and substituted the avocado for spinach. Crabby Benny was absolutely delish... so much that it has warranted a 2nd, 3rd and 4th visit now!

I generally order the orange juice also. Love the fact that it&#39;s fresh-squeezed!

And take one of the colorful mints with you when you leave if you&#39;re a fan of soft mints like me. I always feel guilty when I take 4 - 5 mints, but at least I&#39;m not taking the whole basket and dumping them in my purse, right?

I called my favorite brunching partner (my momma) to break the news, and she took it much better than I did. 

&#34;Ame... That place had gotten a little shabby.&#34;
&#34;But the food!&#34;
&#34;Food was great, but the booths had holes.&#34;
&#34;They did?&#34;
&#34;And it was dusty. And the paint was chipping. And tired.&#34;

Soooo I guess I had sort of turned my head from the fact that Moondance had become kind of a dump, but alas. When I learned Citrus opened, I was pensive. What if it sucked? What if their &#34;organic spin&#34; on Moondance&#39;s menu was unsatisfactory? WHAT IF THEY HAD PAINTED THE TIRED PAINT AN UGLY COLOR?! Listen, I get attached.

So last weekend, my mom and I ventured in to try it. The place was so fresh, clean, and inviting! Bright white walls with a predictably citrus colored theme of bright orange, yellow, etc. Much of the staff have remained the same, and thank goodness - because they&#39;re great. A quick peek at the menu revealed that nothing awesome had changed - all that delicious food was the same. They&#39;ve added a few fun things - like organic coffee, that I didn&#39;t try but will next time, and a fresh-squeezing orange juice machine, which I didn&#39;t try because I&#39;m 30 now and everything delicious and wonderful gives me heartburn. Ah, to get old.

I got my old MD favorite - the calypso omelet, breakfast potatoes with cheese, and an English muffin. Food was fresh, fast, and delish. Still chock full of fresh avocado slices, covered in enticing melty cheese, and completely delicious. My mom got the calypso as well and was completely happy with her order. Husband got the bacon waffle and thought it was dry, but the man refuses to use syrup and is also extraordinarily crabby before noon, so I&#39;m chalking that up to his preference, not their quality.

The new owner (I think, she was hostessing and running around and being generally bubbly and in-charge-y) was lovely, effervescent, and polite to everyone. 

All in all, Citrus has stripped away the tired aura that Moondance Diner had lingering about it, without removing all the things that had made it a Hinsdale area staple for so long. Can&#39;t wait to go back and enjoy my old favorites in a new atmosphere."

I can tell that there are regulars here.

The interior design is very bright and cheery and modern. I love the orange accents. I like the general layout of the place. It&#39;s not one great big noisy room like most breakfast places. it&#39;s more like a smaller room and a hallway, which makes dining there feel a little more comfortable."

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day! I feel like we just don&#39;t prepare ourselves sufficiently with a good breakfast most days! My friend and I did so at a new (to me) place called the Citrus Diner a couple weeks ago... 

I ordered the Hakunna Frittata. It&#39;s an open faced omelet made with 3 eggs and stuffed with spinach, tomato, mushrooms, and asparagus, then topped with goat cheese served with breakfast potatoes and buttered English muffin for $9.25. It was a pretty regular dish. There was very little seasoning letting me pepper it all to my delight. The potatoes were the freezer kind brought back to life.  

My friend got the 2 Eggs Your Way with fruit and toast. Apparently, this is what he always orders when he hits up this joint. Hey, there is nothing wrong with some regularity in one&#39;s life. ;)

All-in-all, this is a good standard breakfast join for a weekender to hit up on occasion. The service was friendly and quick!"

I have been looking for that amazing breakfast spot and although I have found some good ones in the area I had yet to find the perfect go to spot until now. We visited on a Sunday right after church and expected we would have a long wait. We were happy to find out that although there were many families already waiting that it was only 15 min wait. The entire staff was friendly and welcoming. I ordered the Ba Ba Benny, my fiance ordered biscuits and gravy and his son order eggs and bacon from the kids menu. Everything tasted amazing. Perfectly seasoned. The potatoes that came with the meal was the best I have had anywhere. Seasoned just right. I know they must have been good because my Fiance son is so picky and barely eats anything. He didn&#39;t want to touch the potatoes because they were not hash browns but he finally tasted one and then could not stop stuffing his face. He was beyond full and tried several times to push the plate away to once a again stuff more potatoes in his mouth. He kept raving how good the food is. Any place that can make this picky 9 year old rave about food is tops in my book. I also love that they serve potatoes instead of hash browns . Not too many places in Illinois will do that. I am from Boston and that is how most breakfast is served back home and I appreciated well prepared food and not just a pound of hash browns in my breakfast that I could never come close to finishing.  I picked at my Fiance biscuits and gravy and that was oh so tasty. I can&#39;t wait to go back."

I found Citrus Diner on Yelp and was impressed by the high reviews. Plus it&#39;s five min from our house - nice!

Decor is bright and clean, and wait staff fast and friendly. I opted for the Avocado Pan Skillet, my husband the Cinnamon French Toast, and our daughter a large choc chip pancake (we ate her bacon;) Everything was FRESH, hot, and tasty. Nothing was greasy or drowning in oil; just the opposite. My one complaint is the potatoes - they were just...blah. And I love great, well-seasoned potatoes, they add a great deal to the meal. Perhaps they&#39;ll eventually change them up. I couldn&#39;t let the remainder of my kid&#39;s pancake go to waste, so I finished it off, SO chocolately and syrupy good.

They were pretty busy, especially for mid-morning on a weekday, but we were seated quickly, and received our coffee without delay. 

Our waitress took our order and after a short wait we received our breakfasts. I was a bit disappointed with the breakfast potatoes - spongy, dry and unseasoned - but I&#39;ve come to accept this as the norm in the Midwest. 

My eggs and corned beef hash were flavorful, and I was fully prepared to savor every bite. Unfortunately, about three bites in, as I was raising a forkful of egg and hash to my mouth, I noticed a dark hair scrambled into my egg.  That&#39;s it...I was officially grossed out.  When the waitress made it back to our table, I asked her to take the plate away and take it off the check. With barely an apology, she took the plate away and came back, dropped the check and walked away without a word. My boyfriend quickly ate his meal and I took the check to the counter. The gentleman at the counter asked I we enjoyed our meal, to which I replied &#34;no. I nearly ate some of your cook&#39;s hair, and that ruined my appetite.&#34;  

As he reached for the check and my credit card he simply replied, &#34;sorry about that,&#34; rang me up and had me sign the receipt. 

Any thoughts I had about giving the restaurant  a second chance were completely wiped out by the extreme indifference. There are enough tried and true breakfast places nearby, where service actually means something...I&#39;ll chooses any of those places over this place ant day."

Just as the name suggests it&#39;s a Diner and you&#39;ll be finding breakfast and lunch here which your taste buds will be happy about! Constantly the kitchen offers specials and I have yet to have a bad meal here.   

On the weekends you are probably going to hit a wait.  

Now onto the meals while I first want to make sure that you know that they put something addictive into the pancakes (you can&#39;t stop eating them!) that everything is good. On a diet or trying to eat healthy? Don&#39;t worry they&#39;ve got a good selection of healthy options as well for those who have to avoid the pancakes... Which I&#39;m currently drooling over just thinking about.   

Oh that&#39;s right I mentioned lunch too. It&#39;s not all pancakes and omelettes to tides you over. There is a healthy array of sandwiches and one of my favorite tortilla soups (that you can find in the area at least.)

I&#39;m a fan, but thd food is is not &#34;Woohoooo, this is as good as it gets.&#34; Service receives three stars. I ordered the French toast which was served with fresh strawberries, bananas and kiwi. The fruit was very good. However, the French toast was lukewarm and parts of it were cold. The French toast did not come with any meat, such as, turkey sausage, turkey bacon or regular bacon. I don&#39;t like my food cold, so this was not cool. For this reason, I rate it with 3-stars. It was not worthy of five stars. Our Server came to the table about every 15-30 seconds asking us if we were ready to order yet. Here is a hint to Servers:  If you see the customer still looking at the menu this is a sure sign that the customer is not ready to order yet. After a few times, it got a bit annoying.  Service = 3 stars.

The restaurant may have a new name &#34;The Citrus&#34; but they maintained almost the same menu when it was formerly the Moon Dance Diner (MDD). The guys are wearing dark gray and light gray colors resembling a uniform that reminded me of a gas station attendant. Remember, Goober from The Andy Griffith Show?  That&#39;s what the guys are wearing here. Weird. All the colors in the restaurant are vibrant, cheerful and modern with three huge prints of a citrus -- one in sunny yellow, one in lime green, and the other in bright orange. On one wall, there is a huge print  in orange that reads:  &#34;Eat Good, Feel Good&#34; (something similar to this). 

There are a few new items on the menu, but nothing unique that I haven&#39;t had at other restaurants that serve brunch or breakfast. My friend ordered the ham skillet. I asked her to &#34;rate&#34; her dish from one to five stars, and she said &#34;I would say four stars&#34; because the ham was &#34;really, really good.&#34; I did not see a lot of diversity at this restaurant. It appeared to be a typical suburbanite crowd from the surrounding western Suburbs (Downers Grove, Oak Brook, Hinsdale, Westmont, Clarendon Hills, etc.). However, I noticed that there were people here of all ages (from senior citizens to the twenty-something crowd). I live in the heart of the city, and my friend lives in Downers Grove. She rarely comes to the city. I would probably suggest/recommend the Egg Harbor Cafe in Hinsdale, which is sooooo much better in terms of quality and service. Would I go back here again? Probably. However, I will not make a special trip to come here."

But I have to say, the past 2 times I&#39;ve been here the line was somewhat long. Not out the door long, but there was probably about 8-10 people in front of me. That&#39;s not the problem though. The problem is that the people who work here rush you to order and then make all the sandwiches at once. It&#39;s really confusing when they are asking what you want on your sandwiches, when at the same time,they are asking the person in front of you or behind you what they want on theirs. She asked me what I wanted and as I was telling her, she put the same thing on both of my sandwiches even though I didn&#39;t want the same thing on both. They are moving so fast the sandwiches are sloppily made and they soak them in vinegar so it&#39;s soggy when I get home.

I had really bad experiences with them when I lived in North Carolina (hard, old bread, nasty sour meat, cold chicken on my chicken parm sub...) and swore I&#39;d never go back.

Today, my husband was craving a sub and naturally he wanted the Jersey Shore Favorite from Jersey Mikes. Ahh the things we do for love.

So I went, not willingly, but I was glad we did in the end. This specific location was pretty good and definitely changed my outlook on the Jersey Mikes franchise....at least the ones in Illinois.

The two young men that worked behind the counter were so nice and made small talk with us as we waited for our subs. I ordered the regular chicken parm sub on white for $6.75 and my husband ordered the Jersey Shore Favorite (he&#39;s originally from the Jersey Shore so go figure). He swears up and down there&#39;s not a place around that makes this sub like Jersey Mikes does. Not sure how much his sub was but between the two of us for the sandwiches, one chip, and two drinks our total came to $18.00. Meh.

We didn&#39;t have to wait long for our food which was great. I was a little disappointed by the iced tea and raspberry iced tea because neither was sweetened and they tasted foul. The soda machine had a poor selection too...pepsi, diet pepsi, root beer, lemonade....bleh. I hate pepsi products. They need that awesome soda machine that all chains have nowadays with the different flavored syrups you can put in your sodas.

But anyways...My sub was just OK. There was about two inches of it that didnt have any chicken on it, so it was just a mouthful of cheese, bread, and marinara. Two inches is a lot if you think about it and I had only ordered a regular which isnt that big. I was also disappointed by the lack of marinara. It was dry. Why are you being stingey with the sauce, Mike? Hot marinara and cheese should be oozing out of that thing. 

My husband&#39;s sandwich was really, really good! The bread was soft and perfect, the meat and the ingredients were fresh, and they put the perfect amount of oil, vinegar, and seasoning. I definitely know what to order next time.

I know three stars doesn&#39;t seem that great but originally I would have given Jersey Mikes zero stars if possible. They&#39;ve come a long way. The customer service was amazing at this location, the store was clean and well organized, and the jersey shore fav was delish. BUT they still need some serious work on their chicken parm sub and soda machine."

Order your sandwich &#34;Mike&#39;s Way&#34; and it&#39;ll be seasoned with herbs, oil and balsamic vinagrette.  I think it&#39;s supposed to be a secret, but that&#39;s what it appears to be made of.  I wouldn&#39;t have a sandwich here without it, it&#39;s just too good to pass up.

My favorite is the turkey and provolone.  The &#34;regular&#34; is still very large, and depending on how hungry you are you could probably save half of it for later.  But I never do, it&#39;s just that good!

They also have &#34;mini&#34; subs, which are definitely a satisfying portion.  

Tried the cheese steak today and it was really good!  If you like delicious, oozing cheese, you gotta try it!  I ordered mine without onions, and the peppers gave it enough extra added flavor.  If you like spicy, like giardinera, you&#39;d probably like the chipotle cheesesteack instead.  I felt like mine was missing something when it comes to spice.  But I don&#39;t think a cheese steak is supposed to be spicy - never had a &#34;real&#34; Philly cheesesteak!

Prices are on-par with Jimmy John&#39;s and Which Wich.  You can easily get a meal here for less than $10.

Service is a little strange.  They are friendly and cool, but I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re supposed to be friendly/smartassy as mandated by management or what.  I wasn&#39;t in line yet, and the girl asked me what I wanted.  I said I was still deciding.  She said, &#34;okay I&#39;ll be here til 6.&#34;  Her tone was joking, but when I ordered my sandwich without onions she yelled, &#34;NUMBER 17! EXTRA EXTRA ONIONS!&#34; It caught me offguard, but I could tell she was joking.  It&#39;s a little annoying when I just want to get away from people at work on my lunchbreak - who are also annoying.  I&#39;m not going to take away a star for this though, I think it&#39;s part of their &#34;thing.&#34;  Although the store in Plainfield isn&#39;t like this at all, they are just normal, friendly kids."

First of all, 10$ for a sub, a large drink and chips?  HELLO!!  Have you met your competitors? Subway?  Quiznos? Jimmy Johns? They (ALL OF THEM) knock your socks off in pricing and taste. 

 I am not cheap, (I just spent 120$ on a pillow next door) however, for 10$ for a SUB SANDWICH- it BETTER be good. Either that or I am in my second home- NYC.  WRONG.  Nope, just a crappy sub out in the hinterland burbs. 

The bread had some flavor, which is good, because that was the ONLY thing with taste on this lunch item.   
The roast beef, supposedly cooked in the store, was akin to eating paper.  No texture, no taste. 
The provolone cheese? No taste; I double checked to make sure it was present and accounted for. 
Lettuce- no crisp, no nothing.  
Tomatoes might has well have been left off.  They sure looked pretty, but were mysteriously lacking in flavor. 
Olives were nowhere to be found on the offerings section, so yeah- they could not help. The calories I wasted on the dab of mayonnaise might as well have been spent eating something else.  It also failed to contribute!

 Either this place was having an off day or the flavor fairy needs to reconsider the mix.  &#39;Cause it sucked!

 I see that people are cheering the Philly cheese steak sub.  My thought- if you cannot do a cold one right, no thanks, not heading back to try the hot.  I will grab one next time I am in Philly and save myself the disappointment.

As someone who is pretty health-conscious.. I refuse to try the Philly stuff because it sounds like I will feel like a 400 lber when I&#39;m done eating it.. Maybe that&#39;s where I am losing out?? Perhaps.

I know everyone has their taste and preferances, but I tend to ignore that. A sandwich like this, IS better with oil and vinegar. If you disagree, you&#39;re likely the person who orders turkey with lettuce and cheese. Real adventurous you are...

Again, I know &#34;to each is their own.&#34; But please people, take chance every once in a while. They know what they&#39;re talking about when they tell you to try something a certain way. 

Their meat crushes the competition. They cure it all themselves. The vegetables look to be of grade A quality. Their service would make Henry Ford proud, plus they give you some humor or a quick chat about Chicago sports (love that). They make bread better than any of the typical chains.

I had to ask for a knife and fork because I knew this was going to be a challenge. It looks like a submarine missile ready to take out your biggest appetite as it sits wrapped up in foil. The temperature stays consistent as does the flavor throughout the entire sandwich.

The staff  is friendly and knowledgable about their products, they seem happy to work which makes for a positive lunch experience.

You can get the subs &#34;mike&#39;s way&#34; which is basically everything on it with red wine vinegar and olive oil etc.

I kinda thought the red wine vinegar was a little too much. It was splashing everywhere, and I kinda felt bad for the worker who had to do that. Later, it makes for a slightly soggy sandwich.

Hm so we tried the Italian (yum), chipotle steak (kinda too sweet), and chipotle turkey (yum). I think overall it was okay, but nothing mind blowing.

BTW the giant size is basically two servings of the regular. Anyway, it was honestly a slightly stressful atmosphere with workers running around and yelling things, but it&#39;s SO MUCH FASTER than quizno&#39;s!! I admire efficiency (I heart america)

It was okay. I got the Jersey mike famous philly. Not too flavorful, peppers had a nice zing. cheese was lush &amp; melty. but the meat was okay. didn&#39;t really pack a punch... 
the cookies sucked. i had white macadamia &amp; a chocolate chip. I like my cookies to not be soooo soft. I love a crispness around the edge the to sink into it. These tasted undercooked. 9.59 for a sub, 2 cookies (.49 cookies) &amp; a bag of chips.

The best part about Jersey Mikes is there pleasant service that I encounter EVERY time I get a sandwich....I REPEAT EVERY TIME!!!!! A warm greeting does a lot for a business, sometime overshadowing a &#34;shotty&#34; product.

The food here is pretty good, always get my grinder &#34;MIKES WAY&#34; adding Italian spices, red wine vinegar, and olive oil. The ingredients are all very good. The meats and cheeses are sliced to order, unlike JJ&#39;s and Subway. My only beef, pun not intended, is the bread is a little bit on the crusty/stale side. I do understand that this may be intentional, however the plastic tub that the bread comes out of when you order a sandwich is not sealed (air tight) so me thinks it may be stale.

There are not many options for additional toppings here, this is another minor complaint. I know this is an east coast thing, they do things their way so I will leave them alone to sticking to tradition. 

Prices are right on par with other delis in the area....i do split my time between this place and the other freakin fast place."

I hope the owner or/or manager reads these reviews.  There&#39;s no need for the comments when you order something.  Anyone who ordered a giant yesterday got a &#39;boy you must be hungry&#39; comment.  I find them simply annoying, there&#39;s no need to chat me up when I&#39;m waiting especially when it&#39;s just stupid comments.  This is what happens when the whole place is run by teenagers.

The Lombard location has much better staff and when they talk to you they don&#39;t comment on your food choices or if you&#39;re so hungry.

I also wasn&#39;t paying attention when I ordered a few weeks ago as I was busy paying but they jacked up my order and when I got home the only things on my sub were lettuce, onion and tomatoes, she forgot everything on the right side I asked for.  I&#39;ll be watching them going forward.

That being said these are my favorite subs if any chain and are worth putting up with the wanna be comedians."

Yesterday I had seriously one of the best sub sandwiches ever.  Trumps Quizno&#39;s and Subway, hands down.  Even Jimmy John&#39;s and Potbelly are second to Jersey Mikes in my world!

It&#39;s a quick-service sandwich place, and they make the sandwiches right in front of you, a la Subway.  If you want their select suite of condiments, you just order it Mike&#39;s Way and move on(instead of picking and choosing).  Or you can pick and choose.  What&#39;s the best is they actually slice the meat and cheese for your sandwich AS YOU ORDER IT.  You get a very fresh deli sandwich on (excellent) bread that you can watch them take out of the oven a short time before.  I can&#39;t wait to go back and try one of their other sandwiches - maybe work my way though the menu through the course of the summer.  
I do wish they offered cookies or something, and maybe they do and I just missed them.  

It&#39;s a fun environment, too.  The folks making your sandwiches are people that are obviously happy to be there, and seem genuinely interested in making sure you get the sandwich you want and have a positive experience.  

I was so happy to see this place very busy at lunch time - good luck to Jersey Mike&#39;s in Chicagoland, and you&#39;ve just got to go and try it out!"

They cannot get the orders right, for sure with the wraps.  I&#39;ve had two instances where I have ordered and waited while they prepare it the wraps, paid, and then driven home with my food only to find that they gave me the wrong wrap.  A while ago, they just mixed up the wraps - gave mine to the lady behind me ad gave hers to me.  Today, I ordered a wrap again, and this time, when I got home, what I unwrapped was a sandwich.  They gave me the sandwich that belonged to the person behind me, I think, and gave that person my wrap???  I called when I discovered this at home, and the employee who answered the phone said, yes, they knew now that they had mixed up the orders, and they still had my wrap.  That was it; no apology, no offer to make me whole, nothing.  When I told him I was not going to spend another 20 - 30 minutes driving round trip to pick up the correct order (likely now cold and gross), he had no response.  So, I told him I would NEVER be back for myself or my family.

Since I was hungry and did not have time to go back to pick up the wrap, I decided to try the sandwich rather than throw it away.  Their sandwiches are mediocre at best.  The bread is soft and has no flavor or crust.  The meats are not high quality; the Polish ham and plain roasted turkey are almost as lacking in flavor as the bread.  There are so many better sandwich places - Potbelly&#39;s, Fire House Subs, even Which Wich across the street (though they are incredibly slooooooooow) - with better ingredients, more zip, imagination and spice in their meats, toppings and their bread.  NO reason to return to Jersey Mikes."

Pinched Mediterranean grill offers a simple, cheap, safe gluten free dining experience. Pinched is located in the strip mall sandwiched between Jimmy John&#39;s and Burrito Parrilla Mexicana. 

The restaurant is on the smaller side; however, there is plenty of seating available, without feeling that cramped. Upon entry, you make your way up to the counter to place your order. The menu is pretty straight forward. Think a Mediterranean Chipotle. You select if you wish for a plate or pita. Then chose your protein. Pick three toppings and a side and your set. Then pay and enjoy.

For the amount and quantity of the food for the cost, its a good deal.

Some additional Tips:

+ Items are marked on the menu with an icon, a cow if it contains dairy and a wheat stock if it has gluten

+ You can order a gluten free pita; however, there is an up charge. $3 to be exact, which is a bit high for an upcharge; however, it is nice for the option.

+The rice has a nice kick to it. I am thinking saffron. 

+ The humus wasn&#39;t what I was expecting and I wasn&#39;t really a fan. It isn&#39;t a straight chickpeas that is smooth in consistency, It&#39;s more of a spread with parley in it.

+ On a nice day, enjoy your meal outside a one of the few tables outside"

That being said I love Mediterranean food and I love chevap, especially their spicy chevap which has blend of spiciness and garlic (lots of garlic). 

Once again another restaurant that borrows on the Chipotle concept of creating your own dish.   You start with a meat, get 3 sides (very small portions).  I got a garlic hummus (delicious), corn and black bean &amp; red/green cabbage (all very small portions). The dish also comes with brown rice.  The pita bread was excellent served fresh and warm, soft and delicious.

The BEST things about all of the above?
The pillowy pita, the garlic sauce, and flavorful rice.
(The garlic sauce? Seriously amazing. Get it!)

Everything else was very &#34;meh&#34;: the steak was a tough hockey-puck of meat with mild spice. The hummus was bland and forgetful. The falafel were fried fresh and hot, had great texture, BUT were also very bland and flavorless.

You could see the pride on her as an owner and is not intimated with the competition in the area (naf-naf ahem). What we loved about this place is that the menu offers dishes known across the Mediterranean sea and and it&#39;s adjacent nations. Let me explain...

-kalamata hummus is basically Egyptian with Greek influence
-shawarma and kebabs with Tzatiki are common working man&#39;s food in Egypt, Syria, Libya, and Turkey
-beef chevap is Serbian in origin
-tabouli another Levantine dish know to Syria and Lebanon
-black beans and corn is a common Spanish dish
-falafel, one of the Egyptian staples
-tahini sauce are popular Greek and Turkish flavors
-spicy green schug is a Yemeni sauce
-baklava originated in Turkey

For my order, I usually get the plate combo instead of the Pita since it is only a dollar more and you are allowed two choices of meat instead of one. For the proteins, I love the Chicken Shawarma and the Beef Chevaps. They also have the spicy version of the Beef Chevaps for those who prefer spicy food. The best part has to be the toppings. Before, they only allowed us to pick 2-3 toppings, but now, it is unlimited. The Hummus, Mediterranean Salad, Red and Green Cabbage Slaw, and the Sauteed Onions are Amazing. For the sauce, I usually get the Tzatziki sauce. I do not know the exact ingredients they used to make the sauce, but it is delicious. 

The restaurant is only a 5 minutes drive from campus, perfect for those who are attending Midwestern University. On top of that, STUDENT DISCOUNT (better than the movie theater).

The hummus tasted just like ground chickpeas and everything needed salt. I really should have taken a picture because there was literally one fork-full of each topping on the bed of lettuce. Money is much better spent at Roti, where the food is flavorful, fresh, and served in a much cleaner and prettier environment. 

The service was slow as well, and they were sweeping around and under our chairs while we ate... Which is just annoying because the girl doing it announced that she wanted to finish the job so she could leave. We all want to stop working and go home, but show some customer service, please!

Order at the counter, where we found the owner with very helpful suggestions.  I appreciated the way the menu walks you through ordering.  That&#39;s great for people unfamiliar with Mediterranean food.  1) Choose your base, 2) Add your protein, 3) Add toppings (however many your base allows), 4) Choose your sauce.

I had a base of greens with Chicken Shawarma and various sides.  I was encouraged to order as many as I liked, which made my salad base a bit of a treasure hunt in the excavation.  SO good!

Check out their website if you want to go prepared to order.  We came for an early dinner and ordered right away but clearly they do have a rush time as there was soon a line that moved along quickly enough.  The dining room is clean and open."

I came here with my wife and daughter to grab lunch on the way to the mall. For just under $30 I got a fantastic meal.

I ordered a tilapia plate with a side of falafel. The plate tasted great; the hummus was made with some seriously fresh tahini sauce, and the pita was nicely browned. The tilapia was moist and very, very lemony (I suspect the blackened version would be equally good). 

The falafel was unlike any other I&#39;ve had. The chickpeas were mostly whole inside the falafel, giving it a light texture with a crispy outside. The toppings were fresh. Very, very well done.

Without a doubt, I would definitely come back."

Service was great and their menu is simple. You start with a pita, plate, or bed of greens. Then, add a protein and toppings.

Seating is a bit challenging, but we made it work. They had a good sized lunch crowd and barely enough tables. They also have bar stool seating along the wall.

I had a chicken kabob pita and my husband had the salad with chicken shawarma. Both entrees were super tasty and the portions were nice sized. The salad was large, included a pita, and had lots of chicken. The chicken kabob and the chicken shawarma were both perfectly seasoned.

The place has large menus explaining to you step by step on how to order. The lady taking the orders was very helpful, too. So don&#39;t be scared to ask for samples/questions if you are indecisive. 

I ended up getting the spicy beef chevaps pita with the green sauce (spicy schug). The spicy schug sauce is not to be taken lightly. It is ver spicy! I usually don&#39;t eat spicy but it was so good that I couldn&#39;t stop even while my eyes and nose were dripping!

This location is easy to find with no issues finding a parking spot.

When you walk in, stay to the right and go straight to the cash register to order from the menu above. Scenery inside resembles a small cafe.

You start by deciding if you want your meal inside of a pita, on a plate, or on top of a bed of greens (salad).
Next, choose a protein to add to your meal unless you want to keep it veggie. Last but certainly not least, add any toppings that sound good to you, (they&#39;re free). I recommend throwing in a side of potatoes with your meal. Potatoes either come in a brown paper bag like chips or in a bowl as fries, both are seasoned well.

I had a three piece Falafel, made in the Egyptian style but still containing a fair amount of Chickpeas, instead of the Fool bean typical of the Egyptian version. The Falafel was well seasoned, fried to perfection with no excessive oil drips. They were fully cooked through and through, tender, with the textures you should expect, crunchy outer shell, and chewy creamy inside. Add alittle of their special red hot sauce or their zesty cilantro green sauce, and the dish is pretty much an orgasm waiting to happen. 

The chicken shwarma was also cooked well. Not too dry in the center, but exceptionally tender, and chewy. It was seasoned with a balanced amount of salt, star anise, black pepper, and probably a little garlic powder. It was awesome when in combination with either the salad greens, or the additional veggies provided.

I also had three beignest which were light, fluffy, with no excess oil and a healthy covering of cinnamon and confection sugar. Excellent finisher.

Decorum is good, better than that pseudo hipster chipotle corrugated edginess. It permeates an atmosphere of homey professionalism that is both welcoming and comforting for sit in diners.

You can choose to order your food in a pita, on a plate with rice, or on a bed of greens (the plate and greens cost more and both come with pitas anyway). Then you can have fun choosing your protein, toppings, and sauce(s).  I ordered a bed of greens with chicken shawarma (nice and garlicky), roasted red pepper hummus, mediterranean salad (cucumbers and tomatoes), and some tzatziki sauce. The tzatziki and house dressing came in small containers with lids on the side to pour at your discretion.  There was so much flavor going on already, I basically just lightly drizzled.   Husband got the pita with beef chevaps with field greens and black bean and corn with the lite garlic sauce, as well as the side of crisped potato rounds, which he enjoyed.  

About the only minor thing I could say, is I thought the pitas at Naf Naf were a bit better, but the last time I ordered a pita with goodies inside from Naf Naf, there was (someone else&#39;s) hair in it.  So they&#39;re not exactly at the top of my list now.

If you&#39;ve ever been to their competition, like Naf Naf, their pita is similar to store bought, nothing compares to the pita at NNG. 

Overall, it was nice, I&#39;ll definitely be back. The atmosphere is a bit strange though, it&#39;s a little reminiscent of a military chow hall. There was a waitress(?) that was serving orders out to tables, but I&#39;m not sure she ever spoke, just kind of hovered around. Also, there&#39;s real silverware and I could only assume the used dishes should just be returned to the top of the trash bin, though no signs or collection containers were there to indicate this.

I think pinched has really separated themselves from their competitors (pita inn, naf naf, etc). They have fresh brown rice (which I haven&#39;t seen at any other Mediterranean places). The brown rice is perfectly cooked and tastes great. The chicken is flavorful, I tasted hints of coriander and cumin, all with some other powerful spices. The tabouli, hummus, and olives are extremely fresh as I saw the cooks making the tabouli. The pita is fresh and warm as it should be.

I thought the negative reviews were clearly outliers.  We&#39;re new to the area and love Mediterranean food because it&#39;s so fresh and flavorful. I really like the fact that you can build your own meal. When I received my plate it looked good - I ordered the spicy beef chevap with rice, tomato/cucumber salad, and slaw. But I was very disappointed after the first bite. The best part of the meal was the fresh pita and the garlic sauce. The beef chevap was seasoned okay but it was essentially a hamburger patty. I was expecting the beef to be in the form of rolled meat (kind of like a hotdog) which is how I&#39;ve always eaten it before. This meant the meat was chewy. The tomato/cucumber salad had started to soften a bit, which means it&#39;s been sitting in the marinade and not fresh. The rice had a weird chemical after taste. My assumption of Pinched is that it has not always been like this and that the ingredients used to be very fresh and preparation authentic. But maybe because of costs or other reasons - they have made decisions that now comprise the taste and quality of the food.

She explained that for fast-food style MIddle Eastern, she&#39;s never been let down by Pinched in Lombard.

She hasn&#39;t steered me wrong yet, so I stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. Similar to Naf Naf, Roti, Benjyehuda et al, you chose such things from various columns of options, such as what protien, which toppings, what sauce and cross your fingers that the result works together cohesively.

I went for the beef chevaps on pita topped with med. salad, hummus, and  cabbage slaw with the spicy schug sauce on top. For good measure, I ordered the three piece falafel to see how they do on that common offering. The falafel came out first with a small (and I mean small!) container of dipping sauce. They were hot and tasty with a nice crunchy exterior. The interior texture was a little smoother than I&#39;m used to as mentioned in another review, but it didn&#39;t bother me. 

They seemed a bit pricey at nearly $1 per ball. For comparison, at Falafelji in La Grange, an order of four falafels costs less than three at Pinched--for an equally good product.

But on to the main event. The pita wrapped beef chevaps was really good. The beef was formed into little sausage-shapes. It was well-seasoned but not overly spicy to my taste. The condiments I selected added flavor and texture, and the spicy green schug sauce added a delicious fresh zing. Overall, I was impressed and wouldn&#39;t hesitate to come back.

(the olives are fresh and delicious...and I don&#39;t even like olives...and the baclava is actually still delicious also!)

I worked in restaurants for many years and Pinched delivers consistent quality with some of the freshest food and most delicious, high-quality ingredients that I have been able to find anywhere.

My first experience with Pinched was actually their catering at an event, and I knew I had to try it in person, hot and fresh and straight from the source. My initial expectation was low, because Pinched looks like a chain restaurant in a strip mall-type setting, with a few small tables scattered around a counter with the kitchen immediately behind...but nothing could be further from the truth of my expectations. Pinched is a family-owned small business delivering DELICIOUS FOOD and great service, and I have been back dozens and dozens of times since.

The chicken shawarma is OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD, and although the menu is simple and small, build-your-own plates add endless variety and all of the toppings, sauces, and side dishes that I have tried have been equally delicious, and all compliment each other incredibly well.

If you enjoy good food with great service at an affordable price, you owe it to yourself to check out Pinched. I promise you won&#39;t be disappointed.

P.S. They also offer a student discount! Could this place be better??"

The food is filled with flavor, I drool thinking about it. Prices are decent. It&#39;s right next to sweet tomatos, which I go often.

Me and my boyfriend thrive off of Mediterranean food... And we come here whenever we crave it. 

I usually get the chicken shawarma plate with tabouli, rice, and onion. Pita bread comes with it. Nice portions, not skimpy. 

Their garlic sauce is the bees knees. 
It contains mayo in it though, asked the lady

The only reason I took a star off... they don&#39;t use gloves. I&#39;ve seen it and noticed as I peek when they cook my food.

They have the standard Mediterranean fare, falafel, shwarma, steak, etc.  They also have tilapia which you never see at the chains.

The best part of the food at Pinched is how fresh it is.  I had no idea what a fresh pita was until I came to Pinched.  The falafel is fresh, moist and tastes great.  I usually get it on a bed of greens which are actually true greens, not just lettuce.  The bed of greens come with unlimited toppings.  The toppings are practically meals within themselves.  The portion sizes are large and reasonably priced.

Only downsides are it is very crowded at lunch time and the parking lot is very tight and dangerous.  I suggest parking further away (near Sweet Tomatoes) and walking in."

Anyway, everything is fresh and made to order and the portion sizes are great for the price. Doesn&#39;t get any better than this.

You start with a base (greens, rice or pita), add a protein and then a variety of sauces and toppings.  I knew I wanted greens and falafel, but had no idea where to go from there so I let the woman behind the register choose my sauces and toppings.  Maybe she was the owner?  In any event she had the most beautiful skin in the word, if that&#39;s what eating Mediterranean food does for your skin I&#39;m having tabbouleh and olive oil with every meal from now on.

I came here on the recommendation of a Yelp friend, and we were going to try it together, but I happened to be in the area and starving, so upon checking my bookmarks I decided to give it a try. And y&#39;know what? Eh. 

I ordered the bed of greens with chicken kebab. The menu was very clear, and I understood how the process worked from the get go. Everything is spelled out and unlike another recently opened place nearby *coughRoticough* what&#39;s included is very clearly outlined so you aren&#39;t charged for additional toppings-slash-sides. 

It took them about 8 minutes to put my meal together, which is okay. I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be ready when I finished ordering. The gentleman who took my order and gave it to me was very friendly and helpful. 

My salad, however, was kinda disappointing in that the amount of chicken I received (for almost $10) was so minimal. I mean, when did chicken get so expensive? I could&#39;ve probably put this dish together at home for about $2, if that. The greens were fresh, and the toppings were tasty. No complaints there. My biggest, and only, real problem is the one little kebab I got. I&#39;m guessing it was possibly a 2-3 oz. breast. It also came with one pita. And had I assembled everything into a sandwich, I probably would&#39;ve had enough meat for half. And sorrynotsorry, but the little bit of chicken I did get was totally overcooked and dry.

I know I&#39;m bordering on whining here, but I really think it should&#39;ve included either a larger skewer of chicken, or two of the ones it came with. Maybe I sound cheap, but to me, they&#39;re being stingy. 

I was going to pass on the pita and opt for just eating the salad, but there&#39;s no way I would&#39;ve gotten full if I didn&#39;t eat the bread too."

None in the Madison area yet: the closest is in MKE, apparently. Here&#39;s the thing: THE MEAT IS FRESH-CUT TO ORDER, right in front of you. Despite that, the sandwiches are cranked out FAST. Ordering a sandwich &#34;Mike&#39;s way&#34; results in an herbed, oil &amp; vinegar-dressed sandwich, loaded with veggies. I also love the tangy cherry pepper relish, which I get instead of the O&amp;V or mayo. I have now tried the Club Sub and The Original Italian (the latter was my fave). 

I do hope we get a few Jersey Mike&#39;s in Madison in the near future: they make Subway look silly."

Many thanks to Angela P. whose review I read prior to placing my online order. My 2 sandwiches were about $15 together. 

The turkey &amp; provolone was hands down 5 stars! I customized it without the oils/vinegar and got pickles, banana peppers and cherry pepper relish instead. If you&#39;ve never had cherry pepper relish and a fan of peppers, GET IT! You won&#39;t regret it! I hadn&#39;t heard of them until last year, and now I am obsessed. No wonder they say the turkey is their best sellers- it&#39;s one of the best sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had. 

The other sandwich we got was the chicken parmesan. Ooooo....the sub itself was warm and toasted, the cheese was gooey, but you can tell that the chicken was kind of cold (and reheated). I threw the chicken in the microwave for a minute to warm it more. Meh.

When it comes to the store, I was surprised to see how big it was for the small store front. Lots of tables, the space was very clean, plenty of hands at the front making sandwiches at 1:30, and many people were eating there. I&#39;ll definitely be back to eat in!"

She greets me as I walked in (nice), then I gave her my order of which she stood there and told the manager to make. The manager told her she needed to make the sandwich at least 4 times back and forth and she literally just stood there laughing which forced her manager to make it. Was VERY unprofessional and she was lazy and to me should be FIRED. I would never allow an employee to talk to me that way as a manager. It offended me as a customer of which I almost said something to her. Which is the opposite of what I would normally do. Plus my sandwich was completely squished as they cut it. Can see the finger lines on my bread.

Horrible. If I walk in and she&#39;s there I will literally walk out. I&#39;m afraid to eat my food because who knows how sanitary everything was since she was even complaining as she put lettuce on my sandwich (the 1 extra condiment I asked for)."

We were greeted with a friendly, &#34;What are you Kraving today?&#34; from our server. I&#39;m a fan of puns, so that was a positive in my book. The menu was not extensive, but also not limited- they had a collection of reasonably-priced items with a variety of ingredients to choose from. 

My boyfriend recommended I order a Stromboli. I also got the minestrone soup (I believe it was a free side with the Stromboli). As a vegetarian, I greatly appreciated the two different meatless Stromboli options (cheese or veggie) and the minestrone made with a vegetable base. I haven&#39;t been able to get soup at a restaurant in ages (it&#39;s always made with beef or chicken stock), and Krave&#39;s was delicious!

The boyfriend&#39;s side salad looked delicious, too- not just some iceberg lettuce on a plate, but a mélange of colorful, crisp vegetables on a bed of fresh greens. Our Stromboli came out extremely quick and piping hot! They were absolutely wonderful, and gigantic, so I had leftovers to bring home."

But for what it is, it is damn good.  Honestly, we have never had anything here that wasn&#39;t delicious.  The kids love to go on Saturday mornings because the balloon artist is there.  We love it because it is a comfortable, family-friendly place that has a lot of options to please the pickiest members of our family.  I tend to stick with breakfast (Benedict, skillets), but my husband likes the stromboli and cheesesteak.  Kids menu is pretty extensive and they almost always have open seating even at their busiest.  I think once we had to wait for a couple minutes.  Prices are reasonable and they are open either 24 hours or midnight depending on day, which is great when you are desperate for a bowl of French onion soup at 11:00pm.  The place is always clean, tastefully/stylishly decorated, and the staff has never been anything but attentive to us.

My mom got a bacon and American cheese omelette. It was an ugly omelette. Fake bacon bits in a mess of eggs then two nasty slices of packaged cheese on top. My country fried steak tasted ok. The eggs tasted ok. They gave me square pancakes that weren&#39;t good. We didn&#39;t eat all of our food. The waiter never refilled our drinks. 
Two minutes after leaving we both had to find a bathroom or we were gonna lose our guts. I have no idea what happened.

I was very disappointed in the French toast which are usually my favorite. They had no flavor at all besides just being crunchy. I felt like I was eating plain bread.

The Spicy Chicken Stromboli was delicious and huge. In fact, I split it with a friend and it was still too much.  Well, at least I was sleepy after lunch and that generally means I&#39;ve eaten too much.  So, stromboli (aka calzone) was good and we did get a decent side salad.  

However, there are two reasons to downgrade this restaurant to three stars.  One, the service was lacking.  I honestly think that one guy was trying to run everything from cook to waiter to cashier.  Ok, I didn&#39;t see him make the food, but he disappeared for so long that he certainly had enough time.  Second, there were no lunch specials.  Splitting one meal and still spending $13.5 each for lunch is too much.  At least for this type of food.  Across the street at MOD Pizza you can get a pizza, salad, and a drink for under $10.  

I&#39;ve spoken with a few friends and they all recommended the pancakes and waffles for breakfast as a better choice.  I wish I had spoken to them before I went.  I&#39;ll still give them another chance.  The food was good.

I found this place by seeing it as a late nite eatery coming up as nearby me. So I looked at the pics and instantly I knew I&#39;d love the place. I bookmarked it months ago,  but wasn&#39;t eager to get here for some reason. So last night, I&#39;m cruising Yelp for a late nite spot and they&#39;re the only 1s open at 12am near me. I called them before driving there and a gentleman answered and said they were open 24hrs!!! SCORE THERE

We get there and the place is empty. No customers,  but us. This honestly didn&#39;t scare me because it&#39;s Dupage and it&#39;s a Thursday night. We were greeted promptly and courteously as we entered. We were seated at a front booth and given menus to order. It took forever to decide because the menu offers many great options for breakfast and dinner. Many specialty pancakes &amp; waffles. Skillets and sandwhiches. 
  (plus I was now excited LOL). 

We ordered a steak skillet and it came with 2 pancakes &amp; eggs. (I declined the eggs) &amp; red velvet pancakes which came w/sausage, eggs, bacon, &amp; hashbrowns. EVERYTHING was delicious!!!! Not 1 complaint w/our food. It was fresh &amp; hot even at 1230am. I can&#39;t wait to taste other dishes!!!!

They Love the K don&#39;t they.

The Key to this place for me was low expectation. When driving by I wrote them off as a Denny&#39;s breakfast kind of place. Ironically I came hear for breakfast the day after Christmas and well to my surprise it&#39;s really much more then that.  I kind of feel like it&#39;s hard to mess up breakfast so I decided to try them out again for dinner and walked away still impressed

French toast - Got mine with Blueberry came with eggs, sausage and hash browns. No complaints. Good eats!

Alfredo Steak Pasta - Loved it. but I love pasta, steak and parmesan! Comes with a soup or salad. It&#39;s going to be hard for me to try other items on the menu before ordering this 2 or 3 more times.

Open 24hours Thursday-Saturday and 6am-midnight  the other four days. Parking is TIGHT especially when it snows. Price is fair a few items I wish was à la carte.

The food here is definitely a bit more unique, executed well, and contains good ingredients but isn&#39;t so amazing that it justifies the more premium price. The portion sizes are decent however and the food is presented nicely while not being overseasoned. Particularly disappointing was the drinks like coffee and tea which were mostly tasteless (compared to say Egg Harbor or Wild Berry Cafe) which is important to be of high quality to pair with good food. The decoration of the restaurant is simple and attractive, with nice tables and silverware. Although the food arrived quickly, there was little followup service during the meal.

Fortunately, the most important part of the experience was good enough to warrant future visits. The food is in general a bit on the lighter side with nicer ingredients and simple flavors, similar to what you&#39;d find at nicer cafes in the city.

Here are my quick thoughts about all the items I tried:
Tomato Basil Soup: Nice, thick texture and a good strong tomato flavor without being too sour.
Chicken Gumbo Soup: Slight kick, hearty and enjoyable. Nice combination of vegetables to give a bit of sweetness to the broth.
Fully loaded stromboli: Nice texture to the pastry, really liked how it was served on a hot plate. Could&#39;ve actually used a bit less meat and a bit more cheese and sauce to keep the inside warmer. Nice combination of herbs used to flavor everything.
Chicken fried steak: Very crispy steak and tender chicken. Would&#39;ve preferred a little more flavor in the batter. Pairs very well with the seasoned red potato and fries. Sauce had a nice creamy texture to it but could&#39;ve been a bit more flavorful.
Corned beef hash skillet: Really liked the way the potatoes were seasoned here and using just the right amount of cheese. 
Philly cheese omelette: The shaved steak was surprisingly tender and seared just right.
Chicken and spinach crepe: Very light but tasty as well. I liked the very slight hint of citrus in the hollandaise sauce which had a nice strong yolk flavor.
Pancakes: Fluffy and hearty, one of the better pancakes I&#39;ve had.

Overall, good food -- could use a bit of improvement on the quality of the drinks and possibly better service and slightly lower prices. But well worth the visit if you&#39;re in the area."

We haven&#39;t been here before. My wife ordered the Chicken Fried Steak, my daughter the Fried Chicken and I had the Philly Cheese Hoagie. Unfortunately we were disappointed with all of it. 

We all got salads, iceberg lettuce. Translation - too cheap to buy Romaine. Ranch dressing was vinegary.

The chicken fried steak was small. The gravy it came with bland and the potatoes were instant, not real potatoes, served with bland steamed broccoli.

The Fried chicken was not fresh, it came to the table too fast and had no flavor. It was hard. Not light and crispy. The onion rings were cheap corny frozen kind, not beer battered.

The Philly cheese hoagie was more lettuce and tomato than cheese steak. The texture of the cheese steak was like ground hamburger.  The French fries looked like fresh potatoes with the skins on, but they were soggy and overcooked, almost burnt. Like they were held in a hotel pan, not freshly fried.

The food was better when it was the Kitchen, albiet not great. Maybe it&#39;s the curse of the location, or just that they spent more money on the décor, branding and menu than the quality of the food. 

It&#39;s one thing to have a mediocre meal, it&#39;s another when its just BAD. The food here is just bad. I dont recommend it. We won&#39;t be back."

Inside it is decorated in a very clean, colorful almost hip kinda way.(Not the usual coffee shop food stained carpeting and dark color schemes.) They made my eggs (scrambled dry) perfectly, I like that they mixed butter in with their syrup for my pancakes and I really like that there was a pot of coffee on the table so I could drink away without having to wait for someone to make the rounds with the pot. Looking at their menu there are a lot of different things to try.

With an extensive menu of delicious breakfast, lunch and dinner entrees this is going to be the place to be before long. The biggest problem I had was deciding whether to have breakfast or lunch!

 I came during opening week, which is often difficult for some restaurants, but our lunch was pulled off without a hitch. A super-friendly wait staff was delightful to my friend and me, asking us what we were &#34;kraving&#34; that day. Yes, it&#39;s cutesy and kitsch, but it made the experience more memorable and friendly. 

We had a delicious gourmet-quality tomato basil soup, and both had cheesesteak sandwiches that were massive and flavorful. 

It&#39;s going to be hard not going here everyday. Everything was perfect and I look forward to my next visit."

Then the food came.  Everything was awful.  My friend got an omelet.  It went back 3 times before it came out right, and each time it came back out, it seemed smaller and smaller.  The eggs in the omelet looked and tasted like the liquid eggs you buy in the carton.  I got a skillet, and the peppers and onions were chopped so tiny and uniformly that I could tell they were frozen from a bag.  The potatoes were from a bag too.  Nothing seemed to be fresh, which is disgusting when you see the prices they charge.  I expect this level of crappy food from Denny&#39;s or IHOP, which is why I don&#39;t eat at those places.

We won&#39;t be back.  I can do frozen food at home for a tenth of the price, and I don&#39;t have to leave a tip."

The side salad was prepared fresh and it was really pretty good as far as side salads go. No wilty lettuce! The Stromboli was super hot and cheesy. I had the veggie one... Lots of fresh spinach, onions, peppers! I was able to ask them to make it without mushrooms which was great because you really know it&#39;s being made to order! The hubby had the bacon cheeseburger and onion rings. He was happy with the burger but disappointed that he couldn&#39;t have a beer with his burger. No liquor here!

We will be back! Next time for breakfast...

Overall, the food is good and the servers are friendly. Everyone pitches in to keep the tables clean.

The prices are a bit steep for a diner. All desserts are $9. Boooo. Where is the classic ice cream sundae?! As far as vegetarian lunch/dinner selection goes, there is a veggie panini or stromboli ($10.99)."

I ordered decaf coffee which tasted as if it had been brewed many hours before -- it would have been nice to have been offered a fresh pot. Got the French Toast special -- bacon and sausage were fine, eggs were OK but a little cold, French toast was not great.

Pros:  many attentive servers, comfortable booths, reasonably sized menu with breakfast offered all day.   Our food arrived very hot so I know it was not sitting under the heat lamps.  My pot roast was so hot that I had to blow on the meat to cool it off before eating it. 

Cons:  very noisy, I believe due to the high ceilings.  We arrived at 3:30pm Sunday afternoon so we were at the tail end of what was probably a busy lunch crowd.  There were 2 families with little kids and boy, the entire restaurant could hear them yelling.   Pepsi products instead of Coke products.  There was only 1 choice of soup (clam chowder).  I asked to have it packed &#39;To Go&#39;. by the time we were ready to leave, the server said that they were out of soup.  She offered me any of the other sides such as salad or fresh fruit.  That was an acceptable substitution but I hope they offer more than one soup a day and I hope they don&#39;t run out of it by 3:30pm. 

We&#39;ll return but we&#39;ll go at an off-hour to avoid the crowds and the noise."

The food. Well, not the best breakfast i&#39;ve ever had and if I&#39;m in the area again for breakfast, there are other places I would prefer to go. 

Eggs benedict.  The eggs are supposed to be poached, These eggs were bordering hard boiled.  Yuck. My favorite breakfast meal in the world is eggs benedict and I just get sad when the eggs aren&#39;t made right. Also the slice of canadian bacon was way too thick.  I can&#39;t believe I have to make a comment about bacon of all things, but it was just too much and offset the esthetics of my favorite dish. This isnt supposed to be an egg mcmuffin.  The hash brown potatoes that is served with the eggs benny was good though, i was glad for that. 

My son got the kids pancake meal...we loved that the pancake was in the shape of a &#34;K&#34; for krave, but the pancake fell apart so easily...and that&#39;s before it was dipped in any syrup.  It fell apart so much that we couldn&#39;t even spear it with a fork TO dip it in syrup. So short of having a pre-schooler have a melt-down because the pancake won&#39;t stay on the fork, I told him he could eat pancakes with his hands just this once.

My MIL loves this place, she says there&#39;s a balloon artist there from time to time.  That&#39;s cool. Just not enough to bring me back."

I ordered country fried steak with buttered corn and twice baked potato water and coffee. It also came with soup or salad. I choose the soup which was minestrone.  

The server was exceptional at my family&#39;s (party of 5 Mom, Dad, Aunt, Grandma &amp; myself) requests thus the one star. 

On the other hand the food. First coarse soup. Was hot and delicious.  No complaints there not hard to screw up soup though. 

Next the main course my food was served on a hot plate or fajita plate unbeknownst to me why. Though the corn was from cob it was over cooked and no butter to be found let alone any seasonings. 

Next my other side dish the twice baked potato till wrapped in foil with a small slit on top maybe a small spoonful removed piped back in and thrown under a salamander absolutely no effort on this chefs part cause no toppings or flavor. Not even enough sense to add butter to the foil before the first bake. I did ask my server for butter which she obliged.  

Now my main coarse. The country fried steak. Other thank having to pour my own gravy on the steak. Trying to figure that one out why the gravy was on the side. The steak was okay stick to Craker Barrel for those. The gravy was any mix you can find in any store or perhaps GFS it was thin and watery. 

Oh yeah I almost forgotten to mention this fine American dish is served with GARLIC BREAD instead of a biscuit or cornbread. 

Now My grandma&#39;s meal. She ordered spicy Philly cheese steak. Also served on a hot fajita plate open faced after being overcooked in the salamander. She took about 2 bites and that was all. Drank her coffee she&#39;s over 90 years old and that was sad to see that she could not eat this dish because it was that aweful. Way overpriced I am sure that is so they can pay for all the items they had personalized in their place or the prime location they have.

I had asked if they are hiring for chefs and they said no. I am surprised cause they sure do need a new one that has some kind of taste. My 12 &amp; 14 year old daughters can cook better than this place. Your choice your money."

I got a hot tea and it came with its own pot of hot water but it was amounted to the equivalent to a medium hot tea at Starbucks in the quantity of it. However, the tea ended up being 3.99 and it was very average tea. The lead up to the tea was very great because they have a magnetic board that allows you to smell and pick the one you like best. 

The food for our table was all around okay, it was fresh but nothing to draw me back here. It was a place I&#39;m happy we tried but it&#39;s not a place we will be returning most likely. Overall, it was okay but a generic breakfast place that you can find anywhere in the United States."

We were greeted and ater being seated we were given 4 rolls, 2 were a small flat corn bread and 2 cinnamon rolls. They were delicious Both of us ordered Stromboli&#39;s. My wife got the Fully Loaded Stromboli and I got the Hot and Spicy Chicken Stromboli. Both of us found the meals delicious. These were so big that both of us brought home half of the dinner. The bread is not a soft bread but as you get away from the ends it is very softened by the ingredients. One description I found referred to it as an Italian type bread. Prior to the main dish you had a choice of soup or salad. Both of us selected the creamy broccoli soup and were happy with our choices.

While eating I asked my wife why more restaurants do not serve Stromboli. Asked the waiter about it and he told us it was a popular dish in Philadelphia.When I got home I looked it up on the internet and found it was introduced in a township outside of Philadelphia in 1950 by a Romano. Though there other meals I would like to try when I go there next time, it will be hard to pass up another Stromboli as there are several choices."

It&#39;s a fairly newer place, the hours are 24 hours on the weekend.... I mean, can&#39;t beat that! Way better than Denny&#39;s. Don&#39;t compare.

Cute menu and concept of &#34;what are you kraving today&#34; when you order. The food was less than desirable and the prices they charge are a bit steep for what you get, in my opinion. I know of other places that have better food and cost less. 

The food: mind you my family and I ate here about 7pm on a week night. It was a last minute decision since we were hungry. I had strawberry crepes for $8.99. There were 3 very skinny crepes on the plate and the fresh strawberries were diced on top. It was weird to me to eat mini pieces of berry. Also, they must have been cut up with the same knife that an onion was cut with. Strawberries taste like onion! The crepe was too eggy and texture was rubbery. My son&#39;s Krave pancake was too crispy. A giant K is cool and fun but it was more like eating toast than pancake.

First time we went there it was a mess but they just opened and the sever was horrible. She forgot our syrup even though we asked a couple times,  but once I asked the manager for some he was overly helpful and checked back a couple times to make sure we were ok. Everytime after we&#39;ve gone has been good.  A little pricier but big entrees for breakfast, especially the omelettes.  I don&#39;t know why,  but those square pancakes just taste better and i literally &#34;krave&#34; them randomly some weekends."

I dont eat meat so no comments on that but my bf got a beef sandwhich which was huge. I got a veggie panini and it was a large portion as well and came with soup for 8 bucks. It was a Saturday and this girl was doing balloon animals which was different but not my thing when I&#39;m eating. No complaints really but nothing grabbed my heart enough to ever go back.

Kitchen. The previous place Kitchen  Eatery was ok but with a limited menu. I&#39;m very pleased with my meal. I ordered the fried chicken with corn and seasoned red potatoes. Very generous portions and enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Mark our server was pleasant and made many recommendations,he even brought me an extra glass of water because I was drinking a lot. This is Diner fare which I love. My food came out on a hot plate which kept the meal hot. The fried chicken was prepared just the way I like it not too breaded. The staff were very upbeat and friendly, not used to such great customer service. Just at the end of our meal the owner who is from Philly stopped by to see if we enjoyed our meal. My husband had the chicken sausage with eggs over hard. He is particular about the way he gets his eggs, they usually come out kind of scrambled. He says they were perfect. The prices are very reasonable and they even have bacon pancakes! I just might become a regular here so many choices! They are known for Philly Steak and Stromboli. I will be back big YUM!"

They are quick to refill the coffee pots and that is nice. I haven&#39;t been there for lunch yet so this is just my breakfast experience.

My two biggest complaints are that they are a bit pricey for breakfast and both times I have been there my food has come out luke warm or cold. I really like my food HOT! If they could fix that, I&#39;d be happy."

Our table had Fried chicken, buffalo wings , country fried steak, a Ruben, pot roast, an omelette, chicken fingers and spaghetti W / meatball.  Soups and salads were good, the cornbread cakes and cinnamon hush puppy type plate that was complimentary were exceptional.  Very clean and comfortable.  The back room was a little loud, when people talked back there the sound resonated.  8 of us cost $104.00, that was including 4 kids.  I will be back to dine here soon."

What the hell are the sides???? Isn&#39;t that your job??? 

I then asked about the filet of beef...at $15 it probably wasn&#39;t filet mingon. I asked if he could tell me about it...his answer? &#34;It&#39;s like the pork chop.&#34; WHAT??? I said, ok...what do you mean by that? He says &#34;Have you ever had pork chop?&#34; I said yes, but not here. A pork chop is pork... this is a beef filet.... Oh, screw it. Just bring it.

I had not gone since the new owners took over a year ago (did not like the previous place) but it was more than worth the trip. We went there for breakfast on a Sunday. They have a huge  menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I had an omelette with Hollandaise sauce on it that was delicious. Others with us had omelettes, French toast, and pancakes - all had large portions and were very good. Their hash browns are like the original kind, tasty and made fresh. The service was fast and friendly. The owner who came around to check on everyone&#39;s meal and the manager were both very friendly and accommodating.

Krave is very cute on the inside and the coffee was good but that&#39;s where it ends.
My order was very easy just a swiss and spinach omelet   with hash browns. The first odd thing was you just get that you don&#39;t get any toast or pancakes unless you pay for them which I have never had happen before but okay so I ordered it with pancakes to take home. They brought out my omelet and it had tomatoes all over the top which I hate so I sent it back. The new one came and I took a couple of bite and shocked to find there were mushrooms in it very gross since I cannot stand them so back it went. The 3rd one tasted so funny that I did not even eat it. They did not charge me for my meal since I never ate it anyway. The food is not fresh and I think the eggs for the omelet are from a carton not from fresh eggs. I ordered a side of gravy and that was from a mix. My friend had a skillet and she was very unhappy with her meal and you could tell everything in it came out of a bag veggies and potatoes. Our server was just okay sweet but not doing a great job, I asked for butter 3 times and never got it. I don&#39;t understand why they are doing things that are not fresh and charging so much money for them. They really should have paid for both our meals since it was just so bad. I will never ever go back, its a shame it really could have been a great place and for the record one skillet 2 cups of coffee $15.00 just way to much for such a bad meal. I really wish I could have given a zero on the stars, that&#39;s what is really is."

Each piece had a hint of a glaze from the restaurant&#39;s special Krave sauce.

I really wanted to like this place as I passed it by many times.  It&#39;s the kind of food I would expect from an old truck stop 24 her diner.  I ordered a patty melt and soup.  The minestrone was awful and like it was canned soup...I couldn&#39;t finish it and was hungry. Salad was fresh and garlic dressing was good.  Patty melt was ok....just ok.  Like a fast food diner...not a nice restaurant.  The food doesn&#39;t live up to the decor.  Maybe this sounds picky and believe it or not, I am not picky and easily pleased...but the ketchup bottle was almost empty and would only come out when you squeezed real hard like it was dirty and old.

We started with the spinach artichoke dip which tasted as though it was just taken from the freezer and microwaved. I had the strawberry blitzes which were okay, personally I prefer fresh strawberries rather than canned strawberries in syrup. My husband had the Philly cheesesteak Stromboli and was unimpressed. It wasn&#39;t worth the additional wait required for the Stromboli to cook. In general we felt that the menu items were priced too high for the quality of food we received. Another annoying thing was being seated near the front door where I had watch the servers hostesses  flirt with each other during my entire meal. We won&#39;t be back any time soon."

This place is a fast food chain, though it&#39;s price point might make some weary. It would be tough to get out for less than $10 a head with an entree and drink; with some items taking you closer to the $15-20 range. 

But food quality is on par with the price point. Add to that a comfortable dining room and available beer/wine selections you get a great meal experience for the price. 

I would recommend the guacamole burger or a BBQ brisket sandwich."

First time for this restaurant. Food was good and service was friendly. I didn&#39;t like that so much plastic/throwaway utensils and plates is used. Had the Italian Beef with mozzarella cheese, a regular-size salad, and the tropical tea. The Italian beef was super yummy. Nice balance of spices and pepper without being too hot (I didn&#39;t opt for peppers on my sandwich). Bread was fresh - crusty outside and soft inside. The salad was fresh and a lot bigger than I expected. The creamy garlic dressing was a little light on the garlic for my taste. Hubby had the ribs - he prefers fall-off-the-bone; these are not. I think he was jealous of my Italian beef sandwich.  He had loaded mac and cheese as a side. Would definitely go back."

BUT they try to run you thru the restaurant as fast as possible. My wife and I went to the Bollingbrook location for supper last night. When we ordered I asked the cashier to hold off sending the main course out till we finished our soup &amp; salad. I&#39;m not exaggerating but 30 seconds after getting our soup they were putting the main course on the table. They did this same thing several times in the past which is why I tell them to hold off till we finish our starters. Sorry to say I will be cutting down my visits there.

I ordered a Burger cause well, the BBQ here does nothing for me, its very basic and not that good at all (Famous Dave&#39;s is better and even they aren&#39;t that great)
The burger was well, a frozen patty, not even a 1/4&#34; thick and tasted like a cafeteria burger from a hospital.  The fries were also terrible, soggy, and some were even cold.  
The Ribs were tough, chewy, and left me wanting to go to a real BBQ place.  

The worst part of all this... The Price.  VERY expensive for what you get, for a brand they are trying to sell.  
My plain frozen cheeseburger, fries, and a drink was $11.00.  WHAT?$?@*%$&amp;% Let&#39;s think about this...
Portillos right down the street which has good burger and fries cost me about $8.00.  Five Guys fresh ground 1/2&#34; burgers and Fresh cut fries with a drink is about $11.00.  Fresh Burgers, 1/2lb, and fresh cut fries not frozen.  
The Ribs were also much more expensive than portillos and their ribs fall off the bone.  
I&#39;m just comparing chain to chain here, not even trying to mention REAL BBQ places like Smoque, Q BBQ, or Fat Willies cause that&#39;s not even a comparison.  

I definitely wont be back.  There are a ton of other better options that cost less and provide a better product."

This is to bbq what Taco Bell is to Mexican food, but The Patio is definitely a higher quality than most fast food clones. They have a wide variety of stuff that is sometimes ready and sometimes you have to wait, depending on what time of the day it is and what you&#39;re getting. Stuff like hot dogs and fries come out pretty quickly.

Most of the time I get the beef shish kabobs. You get two of them on pitas with a side that can be rice or a potato. It&#39;s always pretty good.

If you call ahead and order over the phone, you can pick up your food through the drive-thru. If you go through the drive-thru without calling ahead first, they have a bunch of parking spots where you can wait until your food is ready."

When I pulled up to the drive thru, they said they didn&#39;t have an order with my name.  So I pulled around, she said no order with my name was there.  She then asked me what number did we call and after I repeated the number she said its their location.  She asked me what I ordered and I began to tell her, I then asked what happened to my order?  She said it probably got lost or something.   Keep in mind, not one time did she offer an apology and I had to seek out an explanation which in itself was unacceptable.  Poor customer service.

I just got a cheeseburger and an order of fries, so I can&#39;t speak about the quality of the BBQ items yet.  The burger was good, but the bun was a little too big for the burger, I guess I should have gotten a double.  Fries were very good, reminded me a little of old Wendy&#39;s fries, before they ruined them.  Prices are more than a typical fast food place, but the food is higher quality.

Walking in I loved the look of The Patio! I was totally expecting something boring like picnic tables with rolls of paper towels to wipe your hands. Nope much better look inside! Loved the over sized chairs in the bar area! 
       Anyway I took some time to study the menu because it was pretty big. I wanted a Greek salad so bad, but then slapped myself back into reality. I didn&#39;t come there for veggies!!!!! Gimme me some meat!! I went for the spareribs (plural), and I was disappointed when my meal came and there was one (I repeat ONE) piece of meat on my plate for $16.99 #WTF  
           My sadness changed to happiness when I realized there was no bone in my meat, and I could eat the whole chunk. Omg....It was like a hug from Jesus.  #Gurl.  You could cut it with a butter knife it was so tender!!! The sparerib was seasoned and smoked perfectly. The veggies that came with my meal were pretty good. They were squash, zucchini, and grilled red sweet peppers. I was totally expecting the lame broccoli &amp; carrots ensemble that most places serve. 
       They have a killer unsweetened peach iced tea!! I tried a different fruit  tea as well and it tasted like robittusin. #Gross.  The chocolate chip cookies are so good!! #Diabetes

I was told that each container feeds 4 people. However, I only received 2 slices of bread per container. When I asked for more bread, they wanted to charge me. WHAT?!!  If I had ordered a single bowl of soup, I would have received a piece of bread, right? So, why not get 4 pieces of bread for 4 servings of soup...or 8 pieces of bread for 8 servings of soup??

My favorite at this spot is their Greek Pita which consists of a lightly marinated and grilled chicken breast and lots of feta cheese - very good and a healthy alternative to some of their other dishes.  Their veggie sandwhich is also a favorite.  You can&#39;t go wrong with their soups or salads either - great flavors and decent portion sizes.

We had just finished a round of mini-golf with the kids and our friends and we were trying to figure out a close place to eat quick before the kids went nutty.  A call to Red Robin provided an expected response, a 30 minute wait.  Yeah, not gonna happen.  Looking on yelp, I found the Patio. I&#39;ve seen advertisements for the place close to home, which I found odd, as it&#39;s not that close.  I gave them a call and asked if they were a restaurant with wait service or was it more of a fast food type place. The ass&#39;t manager said it was a sit down place with options for drive-thru. I asked how long was the wait for a party of 10 and he said no problem, we&#39;ll get you a table.  SOLD!

We get there and it&#39;s not a sit down restaurant really. Someone in our party said it reminded him of a classier college cafeteria.  It was a more modern facility with flat screen tvs with the sox game on, there was a wine and beer setup too.  We got to the line and it was very efficient. They had people walking up the line taking our orders and then we would hand them over to the cashier. Then we would be given our number placard and off to our table we went to wait for our food.  And there was a large table reserved for our large party.  How nice!!  It was inexpensive, a ton of options, and perfect for large parties.  We were able to linger around for a while, while the adults enjoyed their beers.  

I highly recommend this place for large parties and families.  Excellent service and great food."

It was 3ish so there weren&#39;t many people in the restaurant and it was pretty quiet.  The menus are posted on the wall near the entrance.  Lots of good stuff to choose from.  We went with a  slab of ribs (of course) and the kids had hot dogs and fries.  Ordered at the counter, got our number, and choose a table near the fireplace.  Food came out after about 5-10 minutes.  Service was friendly.

The ribs were good...I&#39;ve definitely had better, and nothing beats home-cooked ribs (tie between a few friends and my brother&#39;s recipe), but they were still good.  They didn&#39;t fall off the bone like I like them to do, but they were tender, meaty-enough, and the bbq sauce was tangy/sweet but a bit smoky too.  The kids liked their hot dogs - beef franks plain.  And the fries were good.  The coleslaw was sweet and pretty close to KFC deliciousness (to me, nothing beats KFC coleslaw).  Overall, a good visit.

I did expect to be &#39;wowed&#39; here and I wasn&#39;t amazed, but it was a good meal, in a nice clean restaurant.  I would almost compare it to having ribs/hotdogs at a Portillo&#39;s-type place just not as diner-ish . There are a lot of options their menu and based on this last experience, I&#39;ll definitely be back to try other stuff the next time we&#39;re in the area (and not lost)."

With few exceptions, the service has been fast, courteous and accurate.  The management has a strong presence, so the employees know to be on their best behavior. The food has a consistent quality and they know how to get you in and out the door quickly.  Being take out oriented, I have not eaten inside the restaurant very often.  However, it is airy, spacious and contemporary feeling.

I particularly enjoy the bacon cheeseburgers.  The beef used is high quality and tasty. The ribs are fantastic and the sauce is sweet. The sides like french fries, coleslaw and baked beans are also worthy.  We also enjoy their garden salad, which we often split due to its size.  You won&#39;t find any gobs of ubiquitous iceberg lettuce in their at all. The chicken oreganato is also tasty.

If it&#39;s one of those evenings where you don&#39;t feel like cooking and have run through the other usual possibilities, you might just want to head to The Patio."

The Patio for me is pretty awesome, being a Northsider it&#39;s tough to come across consistency and fair prices for brisket and pulled pork sammies. I like the sauce and the good quality toasted bun. This place lacks the smoky atmosphere of a real pit place like Hecky&#39;s in Evanston, and I doubt anyone would get browned bits or char on the BBQ here because its a little sterile, albeit pretty damn yummy. 
I&#39;d say this place kicks Famous Dave&#39;s in the teeth, but as far as Chicago style bbq, this place is closer to the old Carson&#39;s ribs than it is to Hecky&#39;s or Leon&#39;s.
 For me, leave a lil gristle on the brisket and throw me some burnt parts.

All in all though, I do get the Patio craving whenst I am in Bolingbrook."

I have been eating at they&#39;re locations for many years and always loved the food, service and cleanliness. I would have given 4 stars, but.... stopped in the other day with my son and we were really disappointed! The ribs we actually chewy and tough. They used to come right off the bone. This was around 11:45 am also, so not like an off hour. Sounding picky now but the usually large baked potato was half the size. I will now think twice about returning, at least for ribs.

But I&#39;ve been back several times and tried a couple other items, and I feel a change of rating is in order. My complaints:

- Their hotdog comes with a slice of not-very-melted American cheese on it. Um, what? Last I checked, we were in Chicago. That shit don&#39;t fly.

and

- Their &#34;Hot and Spicy Buffalo Chicken Sandwich&#34; was a little bit hot and spicy, but the sauce honestly tasted nothing like buffalo sauce. And it was pretty vinegary. No thanks.

There is never a lack of seating, and they have tv&#39;s all over the place so you&#39;ll never lack a view of the game. Their menu is extensive, however it&#39;s mostly cafeteria style food. I&#39;ve heard the ribs are good though I&#39;ve never had them myself. Personally my favorite thing on the menu is the Italian Sausage.

Back then, I was around 50 lbs lighter, didn&#39;t acquire a taste for barbecue or ate out very much..   Times have changed!

I was easily impressed by their barbecue chicken and ribs a decade ago.  So, this time when I visited, I was definitely ordering the ribs...I mean you aren&#39;t going to go to a place called The Patio to order chicken fingers are you???  

OK, I don&#39;t beat around and got the full slab.  It was good, but not great.  Maybe I&#39;m so accustomed to having BBQ with a smokey flavor to the point that meat which isn&#39;t smoked seems a bit lacking for me.  The ribs were not heavily sauced but did have a slight tang.  The sauces weren&#39;t nearly plentiful as other BBQ places that have a variety of different sauces varying in kick and hotness.

The ribs are still good.  I&#39;ve just had ribs that were a lot better.

The Chicken was also good even though it wasn&#39;t smoked.  It was very tender.  My wife, who is often critical, remarked that the white meat portions were not dry and she enjoyed the chicken..."

The problem is the service has gotten increasingly bad over the last several years. They went from pleasant to rude to (today) down right complacent. They don&#39;t seem to like to work or care how they treat their customers. No greetings when order (by someone who seemed dressed like a manager), no thank you, no eye contact, no how is everything, they practically make YOU work for THEM.  It wasn&#39;t even crowded. I live in Naperville, so this is the closest Patio to me, but I&#39;m not going back.  I&#39;ll wait for the Aurora one to be built or go to other locations, or better yet, other restaurants who appreciate customers spending their hard-earned money.  Rude rude rude.

A little crispy on the outside and still soft on the inside.  It wasn&#39;t busy so it only took a few minutes to get our food.  

Bottom line:  We&#39;ll be back to try some of their other items. I saw rotisserie chicken on their carry out menu.  I hope that it is on their regular menu.  If it&#39;s as good as what we had today I might jack The Patio up to 4 stars."

The menu is posted on the wall when you come in. You order, get your drink cups, fill up your drinks yourself at the machines, and pick a table. They give you a number which you put on the tall holder and wait. Shortly thereafter your food arrives.

Now realize, this is not a 5 star dining restaurant where you will be dropping $200 for a meal. But it is decent for a quick bite to eat for lunch or dinner. But the food is good and the service is fast.

First off their chairs are painful unless you are supermodel thin.  I got the ribs and chicken combo.

First, is the full slab really a full slab?  Unless these ribs are from short pigs I think the full slab is missing three ribs!  The ribs are just &#34;OK&#34;.  They are about the quality of super market ribs you cook yourself at home. One expects much better from a BBQ place.

And what&#39;s the deal on the garlic mashed potatoes?  What are these, Betty Crocker Potato Buds?  Are you kidding?  You serve this with an $18.00 entree?  I ordered fries too, but you forgot them.

Please teach your staff how to pour a draught beer (and please don&#39;t wipe the rim of my glass with a dirty bar rag).

Where shall I begin? The good? Ok, the only good thng were the cheese fries and the Italian sausage/Italian beef combo sandwich. Everything else was a pass. It was four of us, so we ordered a lot of food and, unfortunately, had the chance to try and be disappointed by several items.

The service was yikes... no, not a good yikes. It was more of a, &#34;yikes, why did I make the terrible decision to pick this place??&#34; My grandfather ordered the submarine sandwich and got the Italian sausage/beef combo sandwich. No one ordered it, but bless his heart he had forgotten what he actually ordered. When he bit into it and said it was good, no one had the heart to tell him it wasn&#39;t correct. So, we let that go when the server brought us the 1/2 half of the order. When the fries didn&#39;t come with cheese sauce, like we ordered, we were given the 3rd degree for saying so. &#34;No, you didn&#39;t order the cheese with the fries. The order says you didn&#39;t.&#34; We had, in fact, ordered and paid for cheese sauce. (This place is order and pay first, and they bring out your order to the table - using a plastic number card to identify you). Why be a jerk? He was lucky it was my/ my dad&#39;s order of fries in question, because if he would have given my grandfther the same hard time it would have taken me 3.2 seconds to come over the table and break the servers arm.

There are 3 main things I find wrong with the way this guy approached such a simple situation: 1) Attitude. It was a rude attitude from the moment we said something was missing. You didn&#39;t take the order. You&#39;re just bringing it out, so why take it so personally if there is a mistake. 2) We are telling you we did... so we did. If you didn&#39;t charge us for the cheese, then do so and F*** the hell off. 2) We produced the receipt showing the extra charge for cheese, and he still stared blankly at us. &#34;Oh, I guess you did. I&#39;ll let them know.&#34; Oh... you guess we did? How about trying, &#34;Oh, I&#39;m sorry I was a complete douche for no reason and any server with half a brain would have asked if everything was correct/anything was missing AND corrected it if it was.&#34;

No, that was too much to ask from this quote, unquote gentleman. So, is it asking too much from me to visit this place again? Yep."

I gave it 2 shots, and haven&#39;t gone back.  Went inside one time, and it seemed MORE expensive to order in.......seemed like they only had a meal special when you went through the drive-thru.

Lacking in both atmosphere and any kind of customer-service welcome just isn&#39;t a reason to come and experience a seeming lack of pride in the place, literally amplified by a blaring television station uncaringly selected of whatever commercial station was last on when they closed last night in this uninteresting space in a strip mall. Chipotle mayonnaise, possibly on everything, seems insulting to the country of either Mexico or USA, your pick. The shrimp burrito special seemed like a good pick, but it was dripping with this &#34;mayo&#34; all over the paper it was served on, and the fish taco was sloshing in it too.

Time of my visit: Around opening

I wanted to try this place based on all Yelp! recommendations and it did not disappoint!

I am from former Soviet Union and I still have extensive family living in the region, so I go back very frequently.  A lot of times I miss the cooking, so after reading all the reviews, I figured I would give it a shot.  I thought what&#39;s the worst that can happen?!

I got their just after they opened and there were 3 people in front of me already.  All three customers were Ukrainians, which is a good sign in my book!  I bought 2 dozen potato pierogis and 6 cabbage rolls.  I got home and figured I&#39;d have so for lunch.  Let me tell you at first bite, it brought back the memories of my delicious grandma cooking!  Both the pierogi and cabbage rolls were delicious!  Very authentic!  You&#39;ve got a new customer! A+

On a side note, I was informed you can could call a head for pick up, anytime after 12pm on Friday and they would put it aside for you.  They are only open on Saturdays between 8am and 2pm.

I spent a large chunk of my college years trekking through the Balkans, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, all the way to Poland and Ukraine. In some countries I had a better grasp of the languages than in others, but every single place spoke my language loud and clear. I&#39;m not talking English - I&#39;m talking ethnic cuisine, particularly carbs and meat. Furthermore, the culinary art of combining the two.

Pierogi are my weakness (Please note that they are spelled pierogi and not pierogis with an S. Pierogi is already plural. Don&#39;t make me pull out my red grading pen!). I was eating them almost daily when I was in Poland and Ukraine. They are a staple there and I never found a bad one. My favorite are filled with meat, but I also like potato and cheese when done properly. I even continued to eat them here in the US because Chicago has such a huge population of Eastern Europeans that you can pretty much pick up a rock, chuck it in any direction and you&#39;re likely to hit a store that sells this food (but I don&#39;t encourage vandalizing). I have found it&#39;s a little harder to locate these shops in the suburbs, but it&#39;s not completely hopeless.

A couple friends raved about the St. Andrew Ukrainian Kitchen and I live relatively close to the Orthodox Church. I pass it a couple times a week and always marvel at how beautiful it is. I had no idea that they also prepared and sold food, so I did a little research -  Everything is prepared by the St. Sophia Sisterhood and the St. Andrew Brotherhood. Food is sold out of the Kitchen (the common building to the right when you enter the grounds) on Saturdays from 8am until 2pm, but you will want to arrive early or pre-order to guarantee you get what you want. I arrived around 11am and nabbed the last 8 pastries.

Their menu isn&#39;t huge, but there is a decent assortment and it makes ordering very simple. They offer 1 Dozen Pierogi/Varenyky/Pelmeni in Potato, Cheese or Sauerkraut for $5. You can also order 2 Kielbasa links for $8 or Stuffed Cabbage Rolls/Holubtsi/vGolabki/Golubtsy/Sarma for $2. Kolachky are 50c each and come in different flavors (Cherry is quite good). They also make fresh White Bread and Rye Bread and sell Honey from a farm. There are specialty items (Smoked Bacon, European-style cakes, etc) on sale for holiday events.

I spent about 15-20 minutes standing in line, placing my order and patiently waiting for my Styrofoam take-out containers of goodness (I hear lines can be out the door in nicer weather). Everything was hot enough to eat as soon as I got it, but I stopped at the local Jewel-Osco to get Sour Cream for the Pierogi (Do this!). By the time I got home the food was still pretty warm, but I placed it in the microwave for a couple minutes and it was good to go. It blew my mind! If &#34;The Old Country&#34; had a taste then this would be it, and I was able to feed 3 people for $20. This is the real deal, so you HAVE to stop in on a Saturday and see what&#39;s cookin&#39;.

They are only open on Saturdays and everything is purely homemade and WONDERFUL!!!!!! There will be lines at times because they are so good. You can place phone orders and it will be ready for you. These are all basically senior members of St Andrews who run the kitchen and they have it down. Fresh homemade hot and ready on the spot or sometimes you can buy frozen. IF you want butter and onions on your Perogis make sure you mention it, you only get it if you ask. I have been going here for years and I am always truly impressed over and over again. They really are outstanding!!!!!"

I come from a small Romanian/Ukrainian town in Alberta Canada, and never thought I&#39;d find anything or anyone who resembles home in Chicago. Until I stumbled across this place. The perogy varieties are wonderful. I even got my husband (who grew up here) hooked on them! Just like home, like my Ukrainian grandma makes! I try stop by when ever I can, just to get a taste of home. I usually pick up a couple dozen of potato and cheese and they&#39;re always yummy and fresh. No frozen, bland perogies here! Nothing but the best."

The cabbage rolls are big, fat and stuffed with the most delicious rice and meat mixture, topped with a delicately yummy tomato sauce.  The cost is minimal for the labor and love that goes into making these.  They are packed tight with a lot of the filling and look elegant in presentation.  I would be proud to bring these to a pot luck.  

The pierogi are out of this world as are the cookies.

The staff are very warm and nice people.

We bring our own container, a big Rubber Maid plastic cake pan with lid other wise they will gladly put your yummies into a Styrofoam container.   

Get there early, we were there last weekend at ten and we were told, they were almost out.  We get about a dozen so I can freeze some for the work week and give some to our sons who live near by.

These taste home made, fresh and with quality ingredients.  

They are open only on Saturdays from 8 am to 2 pm.

If you decide to get a lot of Cabbage Rolls for either Easter or Christmas Dinner, you need to call two weeks in advance and place a order.   

If you want some home made comfort food, you can&#39;t go wrong here.  Whoever makes the food at St. Andrew&#39;s Kitchen,  really knows the art of fine cooking.

Lastly I believe this is carry out only, no dining in and they only accept cash.  Very reasonably priced."

What about my Mother in Law? Can St. Andrew meet the pierogi high bar set by my her?  I love her home made pierogi,  but she only makes them for Holidays or special occasions.  So you can imagine how that  weekly Saturday sign at St Andrew always beckons me to come by and order up some Pierogi to take home. 

The verdict?  St. Andrew&#39;s Pierogi rocks.  It&#39;s not as good as my MIL&#39;s, but it&#39;s still delicious.  As are the other goodies I purchased to bring home. 

Potato Pierogi, Cheese Pierogi.  Both very good.  they were a bit doughy for my personal taste, but still very good!  (tip from Ericka A--Stop for some sour cream before you get home! )

Smoked sausage--basically what I can get at one of the Eastern European delis around here, but it&#39;s nice to be able to pick them up while I&#39;m here. 

Stuffed Cabbage *whispers* I hope my MIL doesn&#39;t find out I&#39;m saying this, but these were delicious and honestly rivals her home made stuffed cabbage rolls.  I don&#39;t know what St. Andrew&#39;s kitchen did to them, but the cabbage didn&#39;t have a lot of bitter flavor and the stuffing was really really good. It could have used more tomato sauce, but still quite delicious. 

Best tip I&#39;ve gotten from the reviews (ahem Osi V) ?  Call your order in! I called in at 845 am (before my workout) and told them I&#39;d pick it up about 1015. While I was putting my change away, the gent behind me wanted to order some cabbage rolls but was told there were only 2 left! 1015 in the AM folks! They close at 2!"

I pulled up to the door, placed my order, payed in cash and was on my way. The pierogi are cooked, but not hot when you get them, that didn&#39;t stop me.

There was also a sign on the door of the building directly across from the beautiful church building indicating where to enter for pierogies. Upon entering, there is a small counter displaying the short menu and pastries complete with an ATM in case you forgot to bring the only form of currency accepted here--cash.

We ordered a little bit of almost everything including, potato, cheese, and sauerkraut pierogies, cabbage rolls, and kielbasa. I wanted to dig right in but there isn&#39;t a place you can just sit down and do this so we took our wonderful smelling food home and picked up some sour cream on the way.

All the pierogies were fantastic and some of the best I&#39;ve had. I&#39;m far from a pierogie expert but I really enjoyed the fresh, delicate, chewy dough and flavorful fillings. This was the first time we&#39;ve ever had cabbage rolls and we enjoyed them although I was slightly reminded of that canned Chef Boyardee tomato sauce smell and taste on the rolls. After I grilled up the kielbasa on my grill just enough to get the casing a little crisp for that snap, we dug in and really enjoyed the fresh smokey flavors and were thrilled to find that the kielbasa was not overly salty like the store bought variety. 

It was a lot of food and it set me back $27 but it was more than enough for two meals between two hungry people. Quantity AND quality both being present, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back for more in the future."

OK, I kid I kid, only one of them is...Whichever one made the pierogi that I had is my Grandma and I love her cooking. 

After hearing about this mecca from Osiris V. and then reading the reviews of her Chrissy W. and Ericka A. I had to try these pierogi.  So one rainy Saturday afternoon, I loaded my baby in the car and headed out in search of pierogi divinity.  Didn&#39;t bring the rest of the family because I wasn&#39;t sure I wanted to share these bad boys. 

After an hour drive, we arrived at the church, the smell of pierogi in the air, I unloaded the kid and sprinted for the entrance.  I ordered 

12 Sauerkraut 
12 Cheese
10 Kolacky Cookies 

Needless to say, most of this was gone by the time I made it home; I had wolfed down 12 Sauerkraut, 6 Cheese and 5 cookies.  By the time my husband made it home from his day out, the rest was gone too. 

So since my husband never saw any of the goods and now thinks this place is a myth, I have to take him back on my next trip.

Our waitress was not very personable and was a bit awkward. She was efficient, but doesn&#39;t seem to have the personality for waitressing.

The food made up for the service. We ordered fries topped with pot roast and cheese curds to start. Kinda like a down home poutine. The portion was HUGE! And so good.

I ordered the Uptown Funk salad to balance out the poutine... It was delicious! Especially for a salad! I took most of it home for leftovers and it doesn&#39;t keep well- no fault of the chef.

My husband ordered a burger and it was enormous. And looked amazing compared to my salad.

There was a pretty odd/sparse selection of apps, but the beers all looked pretty good and were local.  The food was a weird mix of some really good, some not so good.  For example, the tots that came with my burger were excellent, but others at my table had fries that were soggy and or under cooked.  My burger was pretty solid, but I got a few bites of only meat, and it was way under seasoned and very bland.  It wasn&#39;t a huge deal because all the toppings and sauce made it come together. 

It&#39;s probably closer to a 3.5 for me.  Can&#39;t highly recommend, but not a bad spot either."

They offer half price burgers on Tuesdays, which I didn&#39;t see advertised on their website but is mentioned on their Facebook page as burger night.  I couldn&#39;t think of a better time to come try this new restaurant!  There was plenty of seating left when I arrived around 6pm.

Price ranges from $10-$15 and the burger is served on a pretzel bun and comes with a side.  There are 9 different kinds of burgers on the menu, one of which is the burger of the month.  For April, they the BOM is Mr. Bob Dobalina which comes with swiss cheese, beer mustard and topped with olive muffaletta.  The tots are really good!  I prefer them over the fries, which were dry and some were hard.  They also have many appetizers to choose from, salads and sandwiches.

They offer a wide variety of craft beer on tap and bottled.  Beer price ranges from $3-$8.

FOOD
Are you a fungi? Appetizer $9 - 6 mushrooms topped with chorizo and cheese.  These were ok, mainly tasted like chorizo.

Rebel Duck Burger $15 - There no actual duck in this burger, but comes with bacon and pulled pork over the hamburger patty.  The one I got had a lot of bites where I mainly tasted something burnt.  The bites that were not overwhelmed by the burnt flavor were just ok.  I wouldn&#39;t order this again.

Buddha Burger $12 - Comes with blue cheese, jalapeno, onions and bacon.  I tried a couple of bites of this one and mainly tasted blue cheese.  There was a ton of cheese on there, but I was hoping for more than 1 flavor to come through.  

Strawberry Nobel Pie $5 - This was their only dessert offering and it was good.  The pie was sweet and the crumbles were good.

They have free wifi, but you have to ask for the password (thegrubbery).  Free street parking on New York can be easy to come by, but if not then there&#39;s the casino parking lot on Rivers to park in."

Walked in seated promptly, service was fantastic and was never left wanting anything. Ordered the Bubba shrimp appetizer and the Oozy Boozy cheesy pasta appetizer. These both were so good I didnt realize I didn&#39;t take a picture until after they were gone. 

The oozy boozy is a heavenly smoked Gouda and sausage cheese sauce covering curly noodles....I could eat a bucket of this stuff. Seriously, I have never tasted anything so cheesy, smoky and savory.

The Bubba appetizer was chopped shrimp tossed in a red sauce accented with some avocado and served with black bean tortilla chips. This too was delicious.

Again, these apps were so good I forgot to even take a picture...that rarely happens.

For the main course my wife had the soft shell crab sandwich and tater tots. Not always on the menu but is a seasonal offering and I say go for it while supplies last!! I had a bite and almost ordered one to go. It was delicious!

Now a word about the tater tots, they are offered as a side to many of the dishes. They are cooked and seasoned perfectly. I&#39;m not exactly sure what the seasoning is but it transforms shredded potatoes shaped into a tot into something that is much more crunchy and delicious than any tot you&#39;ve ever popped in your mouth!! I was very impressed!

I ordered the Rebel Duck burger. It&#39;s a beef burger topped with pulled pork, applewood smoked bacon, onion strings and BBQ sauce served on a pretzel bun. This burger was crazy delicious. Every bite was juicy and flavorful.

I can&#39;t wait to come back and sample other offerings off the menu!"

I would much rather have a place have a smaller menu with really good items than being overwhelmed with a huge menu and tons of things they don&#39;t really do well. Robert Irvine on Restaurant Impossible agrees with me :) 

We had the best appetizer, kung po chicken sliders, served open faced. Slightly messy but so worth it. That sauce they use is so good, i could have taken a bath it in. 

My husband and I had differnt burgers so we could try each out. I liked mine better and he liked his better. Go figure! Both were just what a burger should taste like perfect soft pretzel bun, cooked perfect and tons of fresh toppings. Again slightly messy but in a good burger kinda way. And tater tots for a side? You cant go wrong. 

I really wish I had room for dessert.

The old Chef Epicurean space has been transformed into a funky-meets-farm influenced decor &#34;Grubbery,&#34; with sledge hammers on the wall and a large pig-head mural in the dining room. The few beers on-tap are listed on a large chalkboard wall. The charm is not lost on me, but I will say, the lime green hurts. Also, the junk on the wall stuff stopped with Bennigans. A few here and there is cool. But no one appreciates your antique collection anymore. This ain&#39;t Portillo&#39;s.   

We are greeted by the host, who was friendly and joking, then helped ourselves to a beer. Solemn Oath on tap! Local! 

As for the &#34;Craft Beer&#34; selection and service - There are only a few taps, say 4 or 5, though let us remember, the Grubbery doesn&#39;t claim to be a &#34;tap house&#34; of any kind. They do claim to be &#34;Local grub, craft brews,&#34; as stated on their shirts and menus. The beer list is long, though mainly in bottles or cans. 

**It irked me that they did not pour my beer for me, but instead, set a glass down and the can next to it.  

Pour it for me. 

As for the &#34;Local grub,&#34; the menu only states &#34;Locally Ground Beef.&#34; Well, that could be done in the kitchen here. Where is it from? What else is local? It bothers me that &#34;Local Food&#34; is printed on your shirt, but you are not giving any shout outs to any LOCAL producers.
What is LOCAL about your food? You cannot claim to be local just for the popularity of it. 
Tell us.
Where is your food from? Your Pork? Your beef? Your chicken? I mean you have a pig painted on the wall. You must have some respect for good food, yes?
But you cannot claim local if it is not.  
Or, do you just mean &#34;Local Grub&#34; as in we are eating in Aurora? I don&#39;t get it. 

FOOD
Chicken Nugget starter is ON POINT. Though they serve it on a huge plate, making the amount of fried chicken look small. I wanted more as soon as I looked at it! To add to this problem, they gave 2 dipping sauces, also both ON POINT, which needed more chicken to use. YUM. 
 
Pork Belly Sandwich - Seeing all the pig references on the wall, I went with the Pork Belly.
Pork Belly should be served by itself, not on a sandwich. It was dwarfed by the store bought soft bread. Soft bread, soft tender meat = muddled flavored sandwich. The pickles were interesting. The pork belly itself was delicious. Though it was easy to ignore because of the bread. 

Pulled Pork Sandwich - Also, lots of bread, though the flavor was there. Topped with coleslaw, it was pretty good.  

The fried potatoes, be them chips, or tater tots,  or fries, were good. ALMOST too salty, though the beer cut through that easily."

Two other coworkers and I came out today for a late lunch. The restaurant wasn&#39;t very full, although we did come about 1:30. We were promptly greeted by the owner (?) and seated. The waitress and service overall, however was a little slow for my taste. The menu is small, however packed with flavor. I decided on the Burger of the Month. I can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called, however it was a medium rare burger with with a creamy white cheese (havarti? maybe gouda?), a corn relish, and a spicy aioli mayo on top. The burger was cooked well, with a good pink in the middle. I did get a side of chips with the burger, and those were delish! Often homemade chips are too thick or not cooked crispy enough, however these were very crisp and thin! When paired with the lemon aioli, it made a great side!

The drinks looked great on the menu, although it will have to be for another time since we were going back to the office. Hopefully the wait time on service was just today, because this could be a great spot in Aurora!"

Gillerson&#39;s opened up in the location of the former famed Chef Amauri&#39;s Epicurean Affair.  They have a great rotating tap list and a great selection of bottles as well.  Their food is all well presented and fresh and reasonably priced.

They do a burger of the month - sometimes a little crazier than others.

We started off by trying the &#34;Are You a Fungi?&#34; (chorizo stuffed mushrooms).  They were good - but the tomato aoli was not able to overcome the tasty chorizo.  The dish was well presented and still tasty, but in the end it basically just tasted like chorizo.

We also had a buddha burger and a rebel duck burger for the 1/2 priced burger Tuesday special.  The rebel duck sounded like a real winner.  It didn&#39;t let me down, but the bacon (I think) had a semi overpowering char flavor (possibly too smoked if that&#39;s possible).  Other than that it carried the pulled pork flavor well and tied in nicely with the fried onion strings.  The buddha burger was tasty as well - not too spicy and all of the flavors of blue cheese and braised onions melded great.  I&#39;m a sucker for a pretzel bun, and all their burgers have you covered there.  All of the burgers at our table were prepared exactly as requested.  The tots were exactly as you&#39;d expect (delicious) dipped in the house-made catsup, and the fries had a good texture and taste as well (maybe like a less floppy Five Guys fry).

They were awesome enough to re-tap a line and throw in the 1z enough for us - and it was as tasty and boozy as I remembered.

We also had a strawberry noble pie which was tasty.  The local hot sauce is FANTASTIC and I definitely recommend buying a bottle - poblano for great flavor, habanero for a nice heat that slowly builds but doesn&#39;t overpower.

I&#39;m excited to get back sometime and try the harissa ketcup (North African katsup) and the Shroeder Odor.

Gillerson&#39;s is a great place to hang out - especially if the cover or the smell of Ballydoyle keeps you away.  It has a nice place to hang, good whiskey, good beer, and very friendly and helpful staff.

Well done Gillerson&#39;s!"

Not too loud and we were seated quickly. Our waitress Cheyenne was attentive and very nice. We ordered Ma where&#39;s the meatloaf appetizer for dinner and it was great!!!  Also got a side salad that was made with heirloom tomatoes and spring greens. Will definitely be back to try more things on the menu!

We went on a Saturday for a quick lunch, and was warmly welcomed.  The bartender (who name escapes me) was awesome.  He suggested a beer which was right on target.  The soup was amazing and the burger was mind blowing.  We will definitely return."

They&#39;ve got a great selection of beer, including a (monthly?) rotating featured brewery. In January, that brewery was Solemn Oath and for whatever reason they were offering pours of La Grippe for $5, that&#39;s a 9% ABV beer that will cost you at least $7 anywhere else, including just getting one from Solemn Oath&#39;s tap room directly. It&#39;s super rare to see ANY kind of discount on great local craft beer, so, that&#39;s pretty rad.

The food they serve is pretty typical of what you&#39;d expect out of a gastropub, with a bunch of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and burgers. I&#39;ve tried a decent spread of the menu, and have been totally satisfied with everything I&#39;ve ordered. They&#39;ve got a bunch of fancy appetizers, but honestly, their fries are nuts. $5 gets you a huge pile of them, which are great to pick at while you get started on your drinks.

The staff is friendly and the place is super clean. Also, if for whatever reason you can&#39;t find parking on New York Street, just immediately hang a right on River Street and you can always find a spot in the casino parking lots there.

It&#39;s not a bad idea to look Gillerson&#39;s Grubbery up on Facebook either, as it seems like they&#39;re always running some kind of special event or other deal. For instance, as of this writing, if you go on a Tuesday night burgers are half off and they&#39;re taking reservations for a Founders five course dinner with beer pairings on February 15th for $50 per person.

Anyway, I really dig this place and it&#39;s super cool how they try to promote locally sourced food and beverages so much. Next time you&#39;re heading downtown, definitely give Gillerson&#39;s Grubbery a try."

I arrived a few minutes before she did and just kind of awkwardly stood in the doorway. No sign about &#34;seat yourself&#34; or &#34;wait to be seated&#34;. Turns out it&#39;s &#34;wait to be seated&#34; as there were several tables open, but dirty. We were originally seated at a tall wobbly table. We asked to be seated somewhere else and they tried fixing the table with coasters. Ten coasters later, they agreed to put us at a different table. The guy said we would be seated at another table soon. A few minutes passed and a group was seated at the table we were promised so we got up and say ourselves. They seemed to have a problem with that and asked why were changing tables. So that was a pain. 

We both ordered drinks. We ordered the shrimp salsa &#34;appetizer&#34;. It is literally salsa with shrimp in it and a handful of tortilla chips for $11. Don&#39;t do it. It&#39;s not worth it. I had the Gracin but with chicken instead of beef. Apparently that&#39;s not a thing here. When I asked for chicken instead of beef, the waitress sighed and said &#34;well maybe but the chef is probably going to say no&#34;. She checked and said &#34;he said yes but to tell you it will be cut up in strips&#34; because apparently that&#39;s how they serve it for the only chicken sandwich on the menu. I&#39;m hoping they make the chicken fresh for everyone. You know, it was good with the chicken. It came with spicy ketchup and it was necessary to dip the sandwich. The sandwich was quite dry without it. Tots were good. Spicy. I liked them. 

Food is decent. A bit expensive. Wait staff not super friendly. Probably won&#39;t return."

Home made ketchup was delicious. (It&#39;s made with tequila) are you a fungi burger was yummy and pretty big. The fries are delicious and seasoned well. The brew list was very nice and appears to change with season. They also had a small wine selection and ciders to offer. The pumpkin cheese cake (made by NBS bakery) was delicious!

The decor definitely has a gastropub, inviting feel to it. One Yelper commented that their use of wall fixtures were outdated, but I think they decorated accordingly and that the wall hangings were not overdone. Unfortunately I was not very hungry when I visited, so I did not order any starters and kept my meal veggie based to be light. I had the Tacoma Ave with coleslaw and thoroughly enjoyed it-the tomato focaccia bread is to die for. The coleslaw was homemade and had the perfect mayo-vinegar ratio along with a unique seasoning that I really enjoyed. I also stole a few fries off of someone else&#39;s plate and they were incredible! 

Overall, my experience here was pleasant and I&#39;m excited to have somewhere other than the mediocre Ballydoyles across the street to enjoy local brews and a bite to eat. I can&#39;t wait to try their burgers and other sandwiches!"

Wife: Refinish the tables so they can be cleaned properly. Felt a bit sticky. Would appreciate being handed fresh silverware wrapped in a napkin versus it sitting in a jar on the table. 

Son 1 (16): They make a good burger!

Son 2 (13): Menu is too small.

Me: Odd menu, decent beer selection, casual yet rather dull atmosphere, good service, overall good meal."

I read their menu online and was excited to try it. I went with a bunch of friends on a Friday night. It wasn&#39;t too busy but it got a lot busier as the night went on. 

Pros: The food is really good. It has a really good atmosphere even if you are just sitting in the bar. 

Cons: I&#39;m never one to really complain about the time it takes to get my food. We all have &#34;those friends/family members&#34; that it ruins their whole din experience. It did take a really long time to get our food.i know it&#39;s a newer restaurant with a newer staff.  The food is also really expensive. 10-15 dollars for a burger.


Overall: I would come back to this place because I know they are new and I hope to change my 3 stars to maybe a 4 or 5. I can&#39;t deny that the food is really good here."

Clearly, the focus is on the many beer choices as the food menu is robust yet compact with salads, apps, &amp; sandwiches. Definitely a burger joint - including veggie.

We each had a Bloody Mary (average &amp; even though we were told they were &#39;spicy&#39;, they were not) and then shared the fried chicken appetizer (excellent) and a bleu cheese burger (exceptional) with tater tots.

Continuing a trend from the prior tenant, plating was uninspired.

Service was a bit dodgy. We had to request water several times and the tables were devoid of tableware, salt, pepper or condiments.  Tableware showed up after the food arrived.

Overall a marked improvement over the prior tenant in quality of food - we&#39;ll be back!"

My husband and I have been here twice. Both times we kept feeling a draft throughout the meal; I would suggest they find a solution for their entryway to block the winter air. The second time we brought sweaters lol, so it didn&#39;t keep us from going back. 

The first time we went it was slow service despite only having a few tables full. The next time we went was primetime, 6:30 on a Saturday, we waited 10 min for a table (had a drink at the bar), and the service was much better. Our waitress said it was her second day, she did a great job!

I have had the miss Minnie BLT and the pig pen salad, loved the delicious bacon on these dishes. 

We have had the chicken nugget appetizer and the mushroom appetizer, both of which were overpriced and not enough for what we got. We decided to just get fries as an appetizer, as they are $5 and you get a large portion. Plus the fries with the lemon aioli sauce = amazing. 

This place isn&#39;t cheap but the entrees are top notch. Beer selction is pretty good too. If you&#39;re downtown trying to choose between Ballydoyles and Gillerson&#39;s, you are a chump if you pick Ballydoyles. Just bring a sweater :)"

The atmosphere is awesome. Exposed brick walls, WWII decor, cozy bar area with great beer choices. I wish I would have gotten a picture of the mural on one of the walls. 

Our waitress was super friendly, prompt and knowledgeable. We ordered drinks and an appetizer to start. I got a cocktail called &#34;The Butcher&#39;s Apprentice&#34; which I helped name! It was delicious, made with bourbon,  fresh mint and lemon. Very refreshing. Mike had an apex preditor farmhouse ale. Great choice as well. 

Food we tried: chicken &#34;nuggets&#34; for our app. Fried cornbread and southern style fried chicken bits. The seasoning was spot on, nice kick to it. We had 3 dipping sauces,  ranch (which tasted house made and was super good), house made hot sauce which was like a salsa verde and bacon jam. Oh, the bacon jam!!! Please try if you can!!! 
I had the &#34;Grumpy Mcgrumperson&#34; 12 hour slow cooked chuck roast paired with giardiniera peppers! Yum!!
Mike had the &#34;Rebel Duck&#34; burger and it was EPIC! local beef(the same beef Au Cheval uses) fried onions, bacon, pulled pork on a pretzel bun. I tried a bite and will be ordering next time. Dan even had the time to tell us the story behind the name &#34;Rebel Duck&#34;

My husband found out about this place online and we decided to try it for dinner. Based solely in the name and a quick peek at the menu online, I was expecting an uber-hipster, dimly lit joint that was trying really hard to be cool. Much to my surprise, we walked in to an airy space that reminded me more of a lunch cafe. It&#39;s very open and bright. We came on a rainy weeknight, were fortunately able to park right outside the front door (its in a &#34;mainstreet&#34; type location), and were seated immediately.

We started out with beers, and though we were a little surprised/disappointed that the draft list was so short, there were plenty to choose from in cans and bottles. I asked out waitress about a local Maibock that was on draft and she (politely) said that she really didn&#39;t care for maibocks, but that she would bring me a sample so that I could try it for myself. Great answer! I would much prefer that over a false rave. I ended up not caring for it but saw some beers coming out of the bar with giant garnishes... and realized that they were serving 21st Amendment Hell or High Watermelon with watermelon wedges on the rim!! Decision made. I haven&#39;t seen that anywhere else (with the slice, I mean)  but I hope it&#39;s a trend rolling in because it&#39;s delicious. I can&#39;t remember what my husband had, but he had 2 different beers and was very pleased. They also had a fantastic looking list of house cocktails which I am hoping to try in the future.

We tried to order the &#34;Scooby Snacks&#34; appetizer which is a fried shishito pepper dish, but unfortunately the restaurant is in the process of re-tooling the menu and stopped ordering ingredients for the things that they are removing. But they haven&#39;t actually changed the menu. That is not really a good practice, they do get dinged for that. We decided to cut our losses with the apps and go straight for dinner.

I immediately landed on the Miss Minnie Bennett (I have never met a BLT I didn&#39;t like) and after a lot of waffling my husband decided on the Oteo Nebraska, a skirt steak sandwich.  I got tots on the side, husband opted for slaw. I was a little underwhelmed when my plate arrived, it was a wad of bacon on a focaccia bun with the expected toppings. However, it tastes WAY better than it looks - the bacon has a sweet glaze, the tomatoes are marinated, and the avocado makes it all really rich. So good! And the tots are perfectly fried and sprinkled with a spice blend that I thought tasted like BBQ chip seasoning in the best way possible. My other half loved his sandwich too (it was really delicious, I had a bite) and the cole slaw is also made special with the addition of horseradish. 

We will definitely be coming back to try more of the (hopefully updated) menu."

Beer list is very good, service is adequate, but the food . . . oh my the food.

Nearly every dish I&#39;ve tried has been amazing. Burgers are top notch and very creative. Veggie sandwich was delicious. One time they had a daily special of a Thai basil chicken sandwich that absolutely blew my mind. Amazing fries, delicious appetizers. 

My one complaint was the black bean burger, which tasted like a frozen patty that hadn&#39;t been seared quite enough. Pasty, not what I&#39;m looking for in a black bean burger. But even there, the other veggie sandwich is no holds barred incredible, so there&#39;s still a fantastic vegetarian option.

I&#39;m a VERY loyal Two Brothers customer, I was there for the ribbon cutting at the Roundhouse and I go there regularly, but Gillerson&#39;s is giving them a run for their money, especially in the food department."

I had the burger of the day with a fantastic pretzel roll bun. The toppings were good but the burger patty was just that, a patty. Service was fair to poor as our server forgot to bring utensils and napkins at the start and was not to be found when it was time to pay.

But in the interest of being an adult, I also ordered an actual meal...My husband had the Momma Duke&#39;s which he loved(and I&#39;ll probably order next time) and he didn&#39;t get what he calls &#34;gourmet burger fatigue&#34; until the last bite so he was quite happy.

     We went in for a quick bite for lunch with my wife, stopped in around 2pm so there wasnt alot of people. We had the Boarder Wars roasted jalapeños which were a bit smaller than I expected but they were still good tastin. My wife had the Porky the Pig sandwich, and I ordered the Oteo Nebraska. We split them so we could both try them and they were both good sandwiches. The Nebraska was a simple easy sandwich but with plenty of flavors popping out as you munch. The Porky sandwich was also nice and juicy, porkbelly with ham, pickles, cheese?, very good sandwich. Reminded me of a tweaked version of a Cubano Sandwich. Fries.....awesome!! 
     The beer selection I didnt get to go through since we had to eat and leave quick, but it definitely looked like it was extensive.

Went in today with a few friends after hearing great reviews. I ordered the rebel duck burger, which came with pulled pork as a topping. It wasn&#39;t busy at all but our server didn&#39;t bring water when we asked and seemed very distracted.  When our meals came, my burger was missing multiple toppings and was on my buddy&#39;s plate. His burger was on my plate and also missing toppings. 

But what bothered me the most was the amount of pulled pork on my burger. It was so small that at first I thought it too had been forgotten. But after looking closer I found a very small, flat patty of pulled pork that covered about 45% of the burger. Not even close to being worth 15$ I would compare the burger to 5 guys except 5 guys toppings are in much more generous portions. Best thing I can say was I really liked the fries."

So I gave it a second try and that left more of an impression. Came here after work to get a burger and a drink. Walked in and waited for a seat. I had maybe about 4 staff members walk past me while I&#39;m standing in the middle of the main area looking to be seated. Finally after waiting 6-7 minutes I went to go seat myself. Still waiting someone noticed me and called a waitress for me. I had mentioned I came here for a burger right? The first thing the waitress tells me is that they ran out of burgers and a couple of the appetizers. Great. If I wasn&#39;t so hungry I would have left but I insisted to stay and got a sandwich. It was okay. After the bad service I received the food really didn&#39;t mean much to me after that.

We went in for an early dinner and the place was nearly empty. The decor reminded me of what you might find on a Pinterest board. Individually, the pieces are eye catching. Together, it looks..... gauche. First, mismatched chairs that are way too close to each other. It felt very crowded. I rarely feel claustrophobic but this place is one of the few exceptions. Second, the wall decorations were generic and uninspiring. Third, the menu is ugly and filled with spelling and grammar mistakes. It was very distracting. The room temp was also on the warmer side (high 80s outside) and it was uncomfortable (most likely the root cause for this whole paragraph). 

Our server was mostly attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. It felt weird drinking wine at 4PM so we stuck to water. I ordered the quiche du jour (vegetables with corn, mushrooms, and spinach) with French onion soup and house salad. I was pleasantly surprised and greatly recommend this combo. The portions were perfect; very satisfying yet left room for dessert. My bf struggled through his burger (overcooked). For dessert, we ordered gelato. I chose the frutti di bosco which is a mixed berry gelato with chunks of blackberries, raspberries and blueberries . It&#39;s the best gelato I&#39;ve ever had in Naperville (so good that I don&#39;t even care that they spelled it frutta di bosco). 

Overall, my complaints are minor (go in the evening when it&#39;s cooler, sit outside). I could see myself coming back for a gelato/dessert and enjoying a cool summer evening in their outdoor area."

The place is cute as I&#39;ve said before but the waitress we had was kind of rude, first thought it was weird we were never offered anything to drink ever she just brought us water. Second I got the Mona Lisa crepe which is one crepe on the bottom topped with over cooked diced chicken and some veggies and sauce. Sauce was super bland and didn&#39;t taste anything like a sauce mornay, it just tastes like an unseasoned bechamel ... My boyfriend order a Ruben which says in the menu it&#39;s on rye bread but it was 100% in a crepe. He said he&#39;s was pretty good just weird it was in a crepe. I want to give the place a second chance I just hope we have a better waitress next time and next time I won&#39;t be getting the Mona Lisa lol I&#39;ll give it one more try before I cast it aside."

The place is still cute and fun. Their desserts are still great, and so is the service but the food was not good. We had the brie and fig appetizer and that&#39;s what saved this review but the rest was a shame. I got the pomegranate salad. The first time around it was mouth watering but the last time it wasn&#39;t good. The mixed greens were replaced by romaine and iceberg lettuce and there was no strawberries in the salad. The chicken was old and there was very little goat cheese. 
I am not sure I will be returning. PB needs to get their s*** together. Just saying!"

Service was very good, nice cute little Parisian ambiance, high quality goblets and seating. We tried the crepes (available as sweet - Creme de la Creme OR savory - Mona Lisa), they were very good and a cream of artichoke soup for an appetizer. It does have a little outdoor seating as I recall, perhaps available during warmer weather. They do serve a few select wines and have specific but very good choices for desserts.

I mean, yes please.  No, wait, I came for the crepes.  I was craving crepes after dreaming about them all night and instantly knew Paris Bistro was the place to go when I saw all the food pictures on Yelp.  I was very tempted with all the other offerings, but they will have to wait for my next visit.  

The décor inside was fresh, welcoming and classy.  We were promptly seated at a booth by the window.  Since they were out of apples, we couldn&#39;t try the caramel peanut butter crepes.

B.A.B.A $16 - This savory crepes came with roasted asparagus, smoked bacon, Brie cheese, toasted almons and a cream sauce.  It was quite delicious and very filling.

Crème De La Crème $14 - This sweet crepes is stuffed with Bavarian cream and topped with bananas and whipped cream.  It also comes with a side of caramel gelato.  It was good, but a little plain.

Truffle Frites $6 - YUM!  These truffle fries were great!  The dipping sauce also complimented it very well.

Also as an added bonus, I got to use the Yelp check in offer for a free appetizer or dessert that took $10 off my bill!"

Paris Bistro is quite a wonder. It&#39;s quietly tucked away in a developing shopping plaza. The people flow is far from its peak but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find this place bustling as more people realize what a gem this is.

For brunch, I had the egg and brie sandwich with bacon. The croissant was flaky and freshly baked. Cut into the middle of the sandwich and you will find a running egg with melted brie and a thick slab of bacon. I am a huge fan of brie and I cannot be happier with this generous portion. On the side is a helpful portion of lightly seasoned, breakfast potatoes. They are pan-fried to have a nice crisp.

For dessert, we tried the creme a la creme crepe with bavarian cream, carmelized banana, whipped cream and sea salted caramel gelato. The light bavarian cream goes well with the sweet caramel, making the dessert well balanced and not overly sweet. The sea salted caramel gelato definitely stands out from the crowd as it sits happily in a tiny, espresso cup. I especially liked how they served it on the side in a separate compartment because it prevents the gelato from melting before we dig into the dessert. 

Brunch was pleasant but it took a little longer than expected. Service was on the slow side even though there were only three tables of patrons. This is quite a concern for a small restaurant. For those who plan to have brunch and run errands, be sure to leave enough time for this quaint eatery."

We went on a lazy Sunday for brunch; we were seated at a table by the window very quickly, but our server took her time getting to us. As I said, lazy Sunday; we had time to kill anyway. Each of my friends and I ordered savory crepes. I was mildly disappointed because the egg for my crepe had a broken yolk.....c&#39;est la vie. It was still delicious. 

We also had an appetizer (spinach and artichoke dip), served with crusty bread - I probably liked the appetizer more than the crepe I ordered! Overall good experience; will return."

When I was in France, I couldn&#39;t afford food like this, so it&#39;s not a fair judge. I&#39;ll preface this review by saying I cannot WAIT to come back and I am so disappointed I waited so long to give it a try! 

TIP - Make you check in on Yelp&#39;s app! We received a free appetizer because of it!

I had been nervous that Paris Bistro would be a chintzy, expensive, &#34;tourist trap&#34;-like restaurant. Though the decor is a bit gaudy, they&#39;re trying to go with an &#34;in your face&#34; Paris theme, with Eiffel Towers everywhere. It&#39;s okay - the chandeliers are a great addition and the small place really explodes with character. This is a great spot for a girls night (which was my first visit), a date night (which will hopefully soon be my second visit) or a brunch (also on my radar; the menu looks great).

I visited with two girlfriends on a Thursday, and we were pleased as punch when we realized it was half price bottles of wine. We had a lovely Sauvignon Blanc, and fast forward to when we ordered the second bottle - we were allowed a more expensive bottle and still at half price, because our original was no longer available. 

Now - to the FOOD!!!
Though bacon wrapped dates are always to die for, we wanted to try something different. We started with the fig/crostini appetizers, as well as a spicy lobster dip. The fig appetizer was so simple, but executed so well! And the lobster dip...delicious. For the price ($12), I was expecting a mayo-heavy app with bits of lobster. What we received was a lobster-heavy app with a dash of mayo! Delicious.

For dinner, I ordered the special: a seafood crepe. I tend to keep my savory and sweet far, far, apart, so I generally think of crepes as a sweet treat, but this...it was to die-for. Huge pieces of scallops and shrimp, a creamy tomato sauce...my mouth is literally watering. Now, this was a special, but I&#39;d be inclined to get another crepe in the future. My friend had the Farmstand, which was fantastic as well. My other friend had the burger, which she also raved about. I tried a bite, but was too much in seafood heaven to be wowed. 

For the amount of food and wine we consumed, our bill split three ways was still roughly $50 a person. Not bad at all, but not a cheap meal either.

The only reason I am docking a star is due to the dessert pricing. Two of us purchased desserts to go. I chose three macaroons, a large chocolate cup filled with chocolate mousse, and two additional cookies. My other friend purchased six macaroons...and my cost was cheaper than hers. Now, this was great for me (at the time), but it also leads me to speculate on what the actual cost is. I simply wish they posted the prices so we knew how much everything was!"

The staff is very friendly and since it was a busy day, we waited about 5 to 10 minutes, but not very long.

I ordered the Mona Lisa crepe and my sister and her friend both got burgers. I believe one of them was the fromage 3 burger. It was very delicious and really surprised me how many of the flavors popped out of the dish! My sister and her friend were also pleased with what they ate. 

The prices for everything on the menu are reasonable since this restaurant has more of a gourmet tone to it.

Definitely will come back for dinner and even dessert!"

After my first time I had written an OK review saying that the food wasn&#39;t that bad, but was nothing spectacular.

The owner invited me back with a complimentary visit, so I took her up on it. When I arrived I asked for one of the two names I was given. Neither one of them was there, so I had to deal with the staff who work there. The server, Daniel, made his own rules and gave me a &#39;discount&#39; of sorts, but ended up charging me for a lot of things including soda. Who charges for soda on a complimentary visit? It wasn&#39;t like I was taking full advantage of their generosity and ordering alcohol. The fact of the matter is that my total bill the second time was significantly less than it was on my first visit. So I ended up paying over $40 for a visit to a place I probably wouldn&#39;t have come back to if I wasn&#39;t offered to come back as their guest. I hate to say it, but that&#39;s far from professional. If you make an offer like that you stick to it.

Sadly, it gets worse. My pregnant wife ended up getting food poisoning from our meal on this visit, and was really sick the whole night and the next day. It was the only time she has gotten sick like this in her pregnancy. I asked a question about the cheeses they used and if any were unpasteurized, but I never got a response to my question. The owner did apologize for my bad experience and said that she didn&#39;t intend for her staff to charge me, but it wasn&#39;t quite enough to make up for the nightmare and ripoff that was my second visit. 

I am staying far away from Paris Bistro."

I&#39;m getting tired of Nutella but I still tried the crepes cause I love apricot anything, so I enjoyed these. The gelato was delicious as well. I should add that I was really excited to see pistachio dust French toast their yelp photo section, as well as read about it in the reviews AND note it on their website menu.

This time we had my sister with us as well as my father and everyone&#39;s meal was excellent.  

This time my father went with the sweet berry crepes that came with an outstanding berry gelato.  Once it arrived my dad put his head down and we didn&#39;t hear a word from him until he proclaimed that he had just had the best blackberry he had ever eaten..... and at 88 years old that is saying something!  My sister had the seafood crepes which were every bit as good as they were when my dad and I ordered them at the beginning of July.  My wife ordered the whitefish special and I ordered the veal special.  We swapped them midway through the meal and enjoyed every bit.  A word of caution on the whitefish special, the big green things on the plate are not olives, they are the world&#39;s biggest capers!  I wish I had known that as I didn&#39;t taste them until after I&#39;d cleaned the rest of my plate.  Lesson learned!  

We treated ourselves to the deserts this time.  My sister loved her creme brulee, my wife loved her chocolate lava cake topped with salted caramel gelato and I was amazed with my chocolate eclair complete with 2 scoops of gelato.

After taking a look at the menu and seeing the awesome Yelp Deals (they have two) they offered, I quickly made same-day reservations on a Saturday night. They were very accommodating to my party of 3 and the table was ready as soon as we got there.

Paris Bistro is a relatively small place with a nice intimate decor. At the front of the restaurant is a small bakery counter front, while the dining seating is stretched all the way to the back of the restaurant. Upon entering and seeing the interesting dessert offerings, we were alerted to leave room for dessert. 

The menu is quite exciting and reasonably priced for the offerings. We started off with an Ahi Tuna Tower, which was a much bigger portion that I expected. There was a generous amount of tuna and avocado (both of which are my favorites) complimented by the fresh crisp of cucumber and red cabbage in a light wasabi sauce. It was really delightful of a starter and I would highly recommend it, especially since it tasted and seemed freshly made to order. 

For the entrees we had the Scallop and Shrimp over polenta, Steak Frittes, and Duck Coq Au Vin. The scallop and shrimp were OK, I was satisfied by the size of each scallop and shrimp but it was a smaller portion of food from what I expected from an entree. Both the shrimp and the scallops were cooked to a healthy temperature where it maintained it&#39;s sweetness and texture. The steak frittes tasted good, but the steak was slightly overcooked. The star of the entrees was the duck, which was a hearty portion of duck and various vegetables that had simmered in a delicious wine sauce. The duck was really tender, and definitely was worth the trip.

We capped off the night with a molten lava cake which was warm and satisfying, but also relatively small. The gelato that was served with it was really good without being overly sweet. 

I enjoyed the food so much, I made a trip again to experience their brunch. This time I ordered the B.A.B.A crepe and shared a Creme De La Creme crepe. The savory crepe was surprisingly light and delicate on the flavor. The crepe itself was very well done, but I probably would have preferred a stronger flavor from the bacon. 

The Creme De La Creme crepe was AWESOME. The cream and the banana provided just enough sweetness to really satisfy someone who was looking for an after meal dessert. The salted caramel gelato complimented really well with the dish and I left vowing to try that experience again. 

There are some flaws to the experience. The servers are really pleasant and nice, but the service itself is relatively slow. Our dinner meal lasted a good 2 hours with about 30 minutes in between the appetizer and the first entree. The over cooked steak could have been cause due to poor timing. I would understand had the restaurant been completely packed, but even in it&#39;s small seating they were not near capacity. The experience was improved during brunch, but the restaurant was almost completely empty when I visited. This is a bit concerning, because they are located next to a movie theater, and could cause issues if someone had made plans to dine prior to catching their movie time. 

However, the food really shines through and will make me a frequent visitor when I make my regular visits back to Naperville."

The Stratacceli has very dense distribution of chocolate mixed, Not all gelato is created equally, especially in this area. You won&#39;t be disappointed with their dessert selection either. This restaurant is worth visiting , even if you were looking for a dessert experience.

The food is good here. the portion size is appropriate. It offers very authentic French cuisine (according to my wife who grew up in Quebec and is french-canadian). It is a small environment comfortable enough for a family, but intimate enough for a date night. There dining atmosphere is unique, in a special way. The service is great. The presentation of the food make me want to wear a jacket in this establishment out of respect for the quality and attention to detail in how they plate the meal and the quality behind what they serve.

I wasn&#39;t adventurous (since I don&#39;t eat cheese, and most of the meals are made with cheese). I had the paris Bistro burger, one of the best burgers I&#39;ve ordered in a long time. The fries were great as well.

For a great dining AND dessert experience, Paris Bistro will not disappoint!"

High end pastries, desserts and coffee&#39;s when you walk in; super cozy restaurant out back. As a business travel guy, I&#39;m a stickler for service since I eat out so much; this place is the best I&#39;ve had since moving out here. Our waitress took us back out front to review all the pastries and other goodies after we finished our meal, she was a sweetheart! She was knowledgable about every single wine, pastry and entree, total pro. Now to the food, similar to the little mom and pop places back home, they have a nice small menu (typical european),  but many specials that change weekly, so you always have many options. I had a beef shank special, that was out of this world, and I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to have been entertaining on corporate expense accounts for over 10 years, and I tell you this place ranks up there with anything I&#39;ve had, in any major city. The part owner and manager came by the table, and we had great conversations with them as well. Great place to take the wife or significant other. And I thought this WASP&#39;y boring suburb could never have something like this lol. Trust me, go here as soon as possible, then take the wife or gf next door to the chocolate store and build back up some equity for when you take those extra long rounds of golf with the boys. Well done Paris Bistro, well done.

Immediately became tied as our favorite with The Turf Room."

My 10 year old son loved his sandwich and crême brûlée; the only problem was that there was too much sandwich :).  The mussels and fries appetizer was an unusual starter, and quite good.  The fries could have been a little better, but the main player was the mussels, anyhow.   I got a pork shank special that was comparable to the best restaurants.  My husband had a chicken and sundries tomato crepe, which he also enjoyed.

The Nutella, hazelnut, and banana crepe dessert with a side of &#34;Oreo&#34; gelato was a nice finish.

Overall, the service was quit and polite.  Possibly because we were seated prior to the main evening rush, the server was a bit overloaded.  Overall, though, he did a great job."

It&#39;s in Naperville, in a strip mall with an expansive parking lot, right outside of a monstrous AMC Theater. I&#39;ve been proved wrong before in nearly identical situations (e.g. Franto&#39;s in Schaumburg). I wouldn&#39;t have gone out of my way to Paris Bistro if it weren&#39;t for Yelpers saying that this is the best place in Naperville for brunch.

Originally, our plan was to go with just the two of us after the triathlon. Then, M invited our friends, their friend, and some of their family to join us. Suddenly we were a party of seven careening from downtown Naperville to the edge of Aurora. I thought to call the restaurant (whilst driving there) and were told not to come. That&#39;s right. Paris Bistro told our party of seven not to come because they had two other large parties who were more proactive about their reservations already on their way. AWKWARD! Our friends, their friend, and some of their family made a game-time decision to go to Pomegranate and M and I soldiered on to see if Paris Bistro could accommodate two.

We snagged a two seat table in the middle of the itsy-bitsy teeny-tiny restaurant. Paris Bistro wasn&#39;t lying. Within moments of our arrival EVERY SINGLE seat was taken. The place was pretty cute. There was a bench for waiting near the door, a glass counter with parfaits, cakes, and macaroons. Separating the waiting area from the dining area was a station with two beverage dispensers and champagne display. There was a small, unused, stand-up bar in the back of the restaurant. Behind the bar were the bathrooms.

I don&#39;t know about the kitchen staff, but they only had one hostess and one server for the entire place and it was plain to see their stress seeping from their pours. There were a few missteps made along the way (such as not honoring our Yelp check-in offer after she said she would) that we easily forgave due to their obvious desperation.

We were delighted that we could order from the entire menu even though it was still morning. M got mussels and frites with lemon wine sauce which were delicious. She especially liked dipping her fries in the sauce and soaking it all up. I chose the half rotisserie chicken with spicy watermelon BBQ and a side of sauteed spinach. I LOVED it! The only improvement I can think of would be to make the chicken skin crispy. Besides that, I highly recommend getting a rotisserie chicken.

M&#39;s mussels and frites, my half chicken, and our two mimosas came to $47.63 (without the Yelp check-in offer). We thought that was a fabulous deal considering the quality of the food we enjoyed at Paris Bistro."

From servings to service, the event was just ok. My guest and I arrived after watching Captain America at the theatre across from the parking lot. It was delightful night, we had reservations yet both the outside seatings and inside dining had plenty of room to spare. We were promptly seated by a cheerful person who turned out to be our server. After the server affirmed that we wanted to chat over a glass of wine, she courteously left us alone, however getting her attention after that proved to be an ordeal, especially surprising in a nearly empty dining room. My guest and I decided to have the cheese plate appetizer which turned out to be surprisingly good and refreshing. For the entree, my friend ordered the pan roasted salmon from the regular menu. She found it to be just ok. She said it seemed to be zapped right out of the freezer and not pan roasted at all I ordered a seafood creppe which was one of the specials that evening. It was well, not what I expected. The creppe made the base with the abundantly red sauced seafood lathered on top. The shrimp was rubbery, white fish seemed to still have some small bones. Oh, the scallops were just fine. After I returned home, I reviewed the menu online and wished I had ordered some other dish. The ambience was nice but not reminiscent of Paris. My guest, who spent much time in Paris as a student and adult, said this needs to be worked on . I suppose for Naperville it&#39;s ok but for a more authentic experience, I suggest Suzette&#39;s in Wheaton or Che Moi near the Steppenwolf theatre in Chicago."

Let me correct a bit of the info that is posted.  It is a very small, Paris type bistro.  What does that mean?  It is NOT good for groups.  If you had a large group, larger than 4, I cannot even envision where they would put you.  It is NOT good for kids.  The exception would be if you stopped in for some gelato which is in a case near the front door.

The menu is on the small side with dinner specials that change frequently, but not on a daily basis.  We selected the Pomegranate Chicken Salad and the French Dip sandwich.  The sandwich was listed as being served with homemade chips and a petit seasonal salad.  The chips never appeared, but it was quite filling as it was served.  We had to pass on dessert, which is unfortunate, because all desserts are prepared on site.  We did stop to drool over the glass case where the desserts are showcased.

We will return, they only accept reservations for 4.  It gets crowded, or so we were told.

My friend was eager to try Paris Bistro, but a little unsure of what to expect.  She ordered the salmon and raved about it.  We already talked about when to come back.

There&#39;s a nice wine and beer list, which includes many French wines ranging from $7-12/glass.

There&#39;s a $5 off check-in deal on the Yelp app, so I got an amazing deal on dinner!

The Parisian decor in here is charming, pretty, and done tastefully.  The seating in here is extremely congested, there is no sense of intimacy or privacy while dining here, unless you snag one of two booths.  We had to be careful standing and sitting so as not to bump people on either side of us.

The space was a lot smaller than I excepted, though the decor was very adorable without being cheesy. There were a few tables, but most of the restaurant comprised of a long, shared bench seating and high top tables. They tried to seat us at a high table (on stools) which is clearly not an option for a 86 year old woman. 

After we were seated, I asked our server about some items on the menu and received pretty vague and unhelpful responses. We ordered two crepes and a frittata, and while the portion sizes were good, none of the dishes were anything that I would go out of my way to recommend to someone else.

From my seat, the sun was coming in through the window and there were no curtains to block it. I ended up wearing sunglasses indoors-- I&#39;m really cool.

When we got the bill, there was a big piece of food or something stuck on the back of the bill folder. I&#39;m not sure how the server missed it, but I was pretty grossed out when I touched it. By then, they had cleared our table so I didn&#39;t even have a napkin to wipe my hand on. Dislike.

Decor is adorable and very pretty inside. 

There was only one server for the entire place and he seemed overworked and underwhelmed with his job. No personality, not overly friendly. Service was not speedy nor attentive, however, he was also the only one working...

Brie tartines were cloyingly sweet and swimming in honey. The bread was wet from the honey. I couldn&#39;t even finish my portion. Way too sweet for an appetizer. 

All of the food lacked salt and even average seasoning. Food was very americanized and not in traditional French style at all. 

Husband&#39;s steak was chewy and the only thing I liked about his plate were the fries. But, c&#39;mon they are fries. Frites. Whatever. They were properly seasoned!!

Scallops and shrimp dish. I thought it was awful. Scallops and shrimp were terribly overcooked and rubbery. It was swimming in watered down stew like mixture that lacked flavor. Polenta wasn&#39;t horrible but it lacked seasoning. 

Not sure if we were expecting too much out of this place, but when I spend $27 on a dish I expect it to taste good. Way overpriced for what it was. 

And I think it&#39;s poor form when owners openly sit in the restaurant and eat/work/make puzzles. Especially when tables need service and food takes forever to come out of the kitchen. I just was not impressed."

I had corresponded with the owner via email about a month prior to our visit, asking some questions about what to expect when arrive.  She was quick and happy to respond.

We were pleasantly surprised by everything; it&#39;s certainly a unique and one of a kind restaurant.  While we can&#39;t speak for actual French food, everything was prepared very artistically, quickly and came out piping hot.  It was all delicious, my wife had a seafood crepe special and I had a slightly modified version of the Mona Lisa crepes.  They are happy to make changes as everything is made to order.  For dessert we had several macaroons and a few scoops of gelato; salted caramel and Nutella.  All were delicious!

There was one server for the whole restaurant, but he kept up just fine and a few other ladies that worked there helped keep things going.  Everyone treated us really well and was polite and helpful.

Thank you!"

Everything was perfect from the decor to the plates and even the cloth napkins.  It really feels like you are in a French cafe.  The prices are a bit steep for the food that you get but that being said its worth a try.  We had the Mona Lisa crepe ($14) as well as the crème de la crème crepe ($12) and coffee (Lavazza $2.50).  The crepes were good but I definitely thought the sweet crepe was better than the savory.  I will definitely be back for desert and also to try the bistro burger that they have because it looks really good.  Very good place to come and relax and enjoy the atmosphere before or after catching a movie at the theater next door.  Also, they give a small scoop of geloto with your sweet crêpes!"

She, my dad and I went on a week-end for an early dinner, and were generally not disappointed.

The place is surprisingly tiny, so probably plan on going early if you do not want to wait. The place is on 59, in Naperville and right next to a movie theater.

Water is served as you would get it in France (i.e. no ice), so I spoke up quickly and asked for some. Screw your authenticity, give me my eau avec des glacons.

Dinner was good. Dad and I started with French onion soup, though frankly it was a bit too sweet for me (sherry?) Call me a philistine, but for my money you can&#39;t beat the soup at Mimi&#39;s in the same shopping center.

The French dip sandwiches were excellent, the beef shaved and not tough or stringy, and enough to take home for lunch the next day (our waitress even packaged up some au jus in a soup cup to go)
Mom had the Mona Lisa crepe, which is also the favoritee of a friend :)

For dessert it was all about cream: creme brulee and a cream-filled eclair. Another friend swears by their cupcakes.

Overall, convenient place for a crepe in Naperville."

The server was friendly but a little overly friendly and everything on the menu was apparently her favorite. 

I had to ask multiple servers many times to give the table bread. They gave it to us 2 seconds before our main entree came out. 

I ordered the scallop and shrimp dish which is a crazy $27. It contains 3 scallops and 3 shrimp and polenta. The polenta was pretty good. Towards the end of the dish I bit into a scallop and it was completely raw. I had to spit it out. When I told the waitress she said that they are supposed to be that way. The scallop was still pink and the other 2 were completely cook. So sure.... I had a feeling that this was the kind of restaurant to say things like that. She said that&#39;s fine and that she will have the cook re-fire them. Re-fire them?! I&#39;m paying $27 for one dish. I have been to many restaurants and they have never re-fired food. They start over. I would have been fine if she just gave me a new dish with one scallop. Once I received the dish back, the rest of the shrimp were even more over cooked than when it originally came out. 

After that incident the waitress barely spoke another word to me. 

The desserts did look very good so I order gelato because I knew it wasn&#39;t made in house. That was best part of my meal. I Did try part of the banana Nutella nut crepe and I wasn&#39;t impressed. I felt like the crepe was a little thick for my liking. 

The next day my friend who ordered a chicken entree informed me that she food poisoning. There must have been something going wrong in that kitchen that night.

If you going to this place, only go for dessert. They can&#39;t mess up gelato that&#39;s delivered to them, can they? 

Way overpriced for bad quality. I won&#39;t return."

On a whim from reading about Paris Bistro in a Chicago ABC 7 food review, I decided to try the small, corner French Rotisserie &amp; Creperie located within the shops of the Showplace 16 complex, just off of Route 59 near 95th street. 

The atmosphere of Paris Bistro is immersive. It had a lively feel, very much European, but also very intimate. It seemed like a place you can legitimately escape from the dull fields of Illinois to a laid back atmosphere of Paris for an hour or two (or more if you want to dine like a true European). A friend and I dwindled into conversation taken aback by the food, service and atmosphere. It was truly an experience. 

Entering Paris Bistro, you first see their Bakery Case with a cafe setup; a full Lavazaa espresso machine, full gelato case, along with a small separate seating section separate from the larger dining section. A large mural of the famous Parisian Arc de Triomphe welcomes you upon entering, with a similar large mural of the Eiffel Tower standing in the distance at the end of the main dining section. Small chandeliers and fake green garden hedge spheres hung from the ceiling. A chalkboard with Specials Du Jour written daily hung from a side wall, with wine racks at both the front and back of the room. French music and at times old school Sinatra played from the background, never distracting, only adding to the atmosphere.

Our server, Christie, first brought us out our water, served from a large glass bottle. It sat at our table for the rest of the meal, a nice European touch usually seen in Italian area restaurants. For my main drink I order the Lavazza brewed coffee, which I will admit was good coffee and made for a great pairing with my desserts at the end of the meal. With my unlimited coffee, our server brought out real cream to the table. My friend ordered one of their French sodas, Lorina sparkling Pomegranate Blueberry. The soda was refreshing, fruity and light, not overpowering like a cola. They make their own St. Germaine, which can be seen sitting a drink canister when entering the restaurant, and I have been told it is very good. And of course, being a French restaurant they have wine. 

To start I ordered a French Onion soup, which I read online was highly regarded and my friend ordered their Soup Du Jour which was a creamy saffron broth with mussels and leeks. Both soups were phenomenal. It honestly may have been the best French Onion Soup, or any soup I&#39;ve had at a restaurant period. The cheese melted over the top, bread underneath soaked in the delicious onion broth underneath.  Fantastic. I won&#39;t even try to put it into words, just order it. The Saffron soup with mussels was also top notched. We joked that these were the coveted soups of the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld. 

For my meal I had the B.A.B.A. crepe and my friend ordered the Mona Lisa crepe. The crepes were large, (I had enough to take some home for dinner), savory, and delicious. My crepe, the B.A.B.A. had roasted asparagus, smoked Bacon - yes! - creamy brie, all cover in creamy Mornay sauce and topped with toasted Almonds. It was exceptionally excellent. My friend&#39;s Mona Lisa, a crepe with rotisserie chicken, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, spinach all covered in a creamy Mornay sauced was also excellent and from what I&#39;m told their most ordered crepe. We paced ourselves during the meal, to be able to of course make room for dessert.

For dessert, there are many, many choices that you can choose from. They have their delicious crepe menu, multiple flavors of gelato or a number of bakery goods in the dessert display case. For dessert I had a Chocolate éclair and my friend had the Crème brûlée. My éclair was perfect and the Crème brûlée delicious. The dessert was on level with rest of the meal.

I had them box up one raspberry and one lemon macaroon to go, which I later enjoyed;  it being the exact crisp outside, soft inside and fruit taste that I was hoping for.

Our service from our waitress, Christie, was top service. She was not only great at meeting our needs as a server, but was great in making conversation and telling us about the restaurant, the food, her trips to Paris, etc. The service made the experience all that more great.

At the end of the day, my review of Paris Bistro is just words; you need to go there for yourself to experience the immersive atmosphere of superb food and service that is Paris Bistro. Get lost in the moment.

I love when I am looking for a quick bite to eat and there are options other than the regular chain eateries.  I have been meaning to try this place for awhile and when I found myself in the area I was thrilled to be able to try it.

I walked in at an off-time, around 2 or 3 and it was completely empty except for a couple of the waiters who were sitting at a table.  The place is pretty small, but I was still curious to why the owner sat me two tables away from the workers.  To make matters worse, there was a door that was propped open the entire time I was there which made it pretty cold in the restaurant.  The owner made some small talk with me since I was the only one in the restaurant, and kept telling me that it was unusual for the restaurant to be empty but she thought because of how nice it was outside this was the case.  Though the sun was out, it was still about 30 degrees outside and keeping the door open was noticed.  I also found it odd that after I had been served my meal that she sat down at the table with the workers to eat a salad.  All she had to do was lift up her head and ask me in between bites how my meal was. She explained that she wanted to eat before it got busy, which I can totally appreciate - but I would have eaten in back where your customers can&#39;t see you. I felt like I was interrupting her lunch if I needed to ask her for something. 

My food came out quickly and was pretty good.  It was flavorful, but had too much of one ingredient (asparagus) as opposed to the other ingredients (bacon).  I would have ordered a dessert crepe as well, but I was surprised to find that the dessert crepes were just as expensive as the savory crepes.  All of the other crepe places I have ever been have had lunch crepes that were priced higher and then dessert crepes for less.  I can&#39;t see spending the same amount for a crepe with caramelized apples and sugar as a crepe with bacon, asparagus and brie.  I would suggest making the dessert ones smaller and having them more as a dessert item rather than a entree.  Instead I ordered the creme brulee which was fabulous.

They also have a great pastry case and I took home some macroons for later.  They were fresh and delicious.  This is a cute place and I could see coming back here.  I think that I would just try something else and come when it is a busier time."

BIG MISTAKE!! After being greeted by the friendly staff and being seated near the kitchen my wife and I had a hard time deciding on what to order from their fully stocked menu. Luckily the entrees coming out of the kitchen made it easy for us to decide. We had the spicy shrimp appetizer which was simply amazing. My wife had the Tour De France sandwich and I had the braised ribs. The food was remarkable. For desert we had the Crepes and gelato which was to die for. We both thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience here.

Instead of closing shop, they focused on specialty meats and did something radical added a restaurant that&#39;s tucked away in this neighborhood... And it&#39;s cool! The music is a cool kind of r&amp;b, and you feel like a badass eating a delicious brat. 

Menu changes regularly to feature meats (they had a brat that was cut in half which was nice as well as pulled pork and beef brisket) and the outside dining is a nice addition.

Came out very quickly and was handed to me with a smile. When I was wrung up, I was informed that they needed small bills and lucky fir them and me, I was loaded with singles. After turning over my money and walking out, I told my my partner I was excited to try the sammy. It did not disappoint. Tender brat and pulled pork on a soft bun with delicious sauce. I will be back again... Probably bring the family."

I searched &#34;sausage&#34; and &#34;Naperville&#34; and came up with Kreger&#39;s!

Man, these people know their sausage. They have been making it for decades (note the worn-down butcher block) and now make somewhere around 50 types, including many versions of brats, made with assorted proteins: pork of course, but how about chicken, lamb or bison? There is even a veggie sausage so that meat-shunning relative doesn&#39;t have to be the odd man out at your family cookout. They also make and sell various homemade slaws and salads, and other butcher products. 

Check their web site before you go to see all the variety, otherwise you&#39;ll stand there overwhelmed by the options. There are all kinds of unusual spins, as well as time honored standards. Everyone has probably had a standard bratwurst, but have you tried The Viking (with turkey, wild rice and blueberries)? Or Pumpkin Spice sausage with pork, pumpkin puree and warm wintry spices? Kerger&#39;s has all kinds of unique items!

I came for the Polish, and was not disappointed: pleasantly spicy, with a good texture and a casing that didn&#39;t require a hand saw to get through. I will definitely return to try more of their creations! They are convenient to downtown, on the North Central side of Washington and near the train station, so you can grab some with ease if you&#39;re just passing through. 

They&#39;re off this month on a long vacation so I will anxiously await the return! As they themselves say, their wurst is the best!"

With their hours, it seemed nearly impossible to get over here, even though I live ten minutes away. I decided to finally check it out, as I got out of work early today. 

I decided upon the Blackhawk brat with sauerkraut, giardinera, and onions. Oh. my. flavorgasm! I was in heaven!!! The brat was slightly spicy, the kraut had a hint of sweetness, and the onions weren&#39;t overpowering. I was impressed.

My bf is at work sick, so I also ordered a chicken dumpling soup and roast beef and swiss sandwich. No sooner than leaving there, he ended up getting sent home early. So I was able to sample the soup and the sandwich. Both were phenominal, as expected.

All the employees were very friendly. It was so nice to walk into an unfamiliar place and be greeted so warmly. The man who put my sandwiches together was patient and explained the toppings available for both the brat and sandwich. The cashier was a total doll. I wish I had gotten their names.

Needless to say, I will definitely be back!"

I hadn&#39;t been back here in years when it was first a neighborhood gem of a grocery, then a sausage shop, and now since Jan 2013, a sausage shop serving lunch.   Colleagues and I came in for a weekday lunch and beat the crowd by showing up at about 11:45am, and a surprisingly long line did subsequently form on this day.  I had their brat lunch deal for $6.88 - their original brat with in my case sauerkraut and mustard, and with chips and a soda can.  It&#39;s also a nice quiet place to have a good lunch conversation while enjoying a fresh tasting home made brat.  I also bought for take-home a pound ($5.99/lb) of their enticing turkey-cranberry-orange brats, amongst various brat selections in their freezer (haven&#39;t tried yet but looking forward to it).  Will be back again I think."

Makes for a great experience. This is an old school kind of place when you walk in you feel like truly went back in time. Saturday mornings they do a gourmet breakfast Sandwich (different each week) and it is a surprise until Saturday morning (check Facebook) it is always a fun surprise. Breakfast is 5 bucks and includes juice or coffee. Always tasty. They offer a variety of fresh wurst daily and I am slowly working my way through all the flavors. I have not had a bad one yet. Locally and family owned so check them out and support small businesses or they will slowly be gone and that would be sad. Love this place!! On a side note there is a house being built across the street and my wife won&#39;t even let me look because she knows that I would eat here everyday if we lived there.

I just picked up my &#34;first timer&#34; Ho-Ka free range turkey, which is raised right here in Waterman, IL.  **Update: The best turkey ever and leftover for sandwiches was great. I didn&#39;t need to put so much Miracle Whip on the moist meat as in past years to make a decent sandwich.**

Bill has passed 35 different types of brat/sausage creations and the latest combo of turkey, cranberry and orange is a &#34; turkey day feast&#34; all with one bite. The weekly new brat for each team the Bears plays have all been interesting too. Certainly some creative thinking and the combinations are too vast to remember. I think Bill has a cheat sheet somewhere as sometimes he even forgets. Anything with lamb is amazing and just be sure not to over cook them.

The freshness can&#39;t be topped and don&#39;t be surprised if Bill ducks into the cooler for a few and comes out twisting your order right in front of you. The fresh salads and now the daily soups, make it almost worth the cold weather change. Your sweet tooth will continue to be satisfied and you can always raid the freezer for you favorite items.

Saturday mornings are such a rare treat now too, as each week they create a new taco or sandwich for breakfast. It comes with coffee or OJ for just $5. Plenty of tables to sit and enjoy your breakfast on Saturday or your lunch.

Thursday - Saturday the lunch options are always based with their traditional brat but always have several other great options. Add soup for just a slight upgrade then take home a pound or two of fresh salads and if you haven&#39;t tried his homemade Italian Beef, bring home two pounds. Their homemade buns and rolls are fantastic and I freeze them."

Be on the lookout for amazing breakfast sandwiches on Saturday mornings. They only serve until 10:30a, so get there EARLY. The last one I had had homemade sausage, a perfectly poached egg, tasty sauce (red pepper, I believe) on a soft roll. Eat in the store, too- Kreger&#39;s has been a Naperville institution for 60 years, and they have tons of great Naperville, grocery and family artifacts on the wall.

The owners have always been so, so kind to us, too. Recognizing us, asking about our days, heating up our sandwiches to take the chill off (I swear. It was lovely), letting me take a photo of the brat sign so I&#39;d remember the ingredients. 

That aforementioned brat? The Raven. GET IT. It was a chicken sausage with pepperjack cheese and Old Bay seasoning. Come on. The brats are a tad expensive, admittedly, but the price is more than worth it for the quality and friendly service you get. Everything is homemade, and the people are just lovely. 

Guys. People love Kreger&#39;s so much that when they closed in 2013, the demand was so out of control that they reopened. Go see why."

We also got a bunch of different sausages to take home and grill for a party. I can&#39;t remember all the flavors we got but they were all good!

I asked for whatever the man at the counter would eat and he brought me a brat sandwich.  DELICIOUS!  Just the right flavor of onions and soft, soft bread.  I will definitely be back and the kids will be with me next time - If I can wait.

Should also be noted...  When I called to find out about this place the woman I spoke said, &#34;If you&#39;re running a bit late and know you&#39;ll be here by 6, just call me and I&#39;ll make sure we put a few brats aside for you.  Love that."

I still get a brat from here for lunch almost every Friday.  My groomsmen and I came here on my wedding day last year when they were having their annual breast cancer fundraiser.  My best man still talks about how good the brats were.

Pick up some ham salad or German potato salad while you&#39;re here.  You can&#39;t go wrong."

Since reopening, I have tried virtually all of the offerings and without question the star of the show is Bill&#39;s Irish sausage. Perfectly seasoned and delicious. The new potato sausage is also stellar. The chorizo brat is fiery and excellent, too. If you are a purist, the traditional brat made in the Sheboygan style is the best around. If you want a leaner sausage, I have found the chicken brat to be great.

It definitely stood out from the standard Subway, Jason&#39;s Deli, Jimmy John&#39;s, and other sub places of the world, so I obviously had to take a gander. After looking through the pictures, I was sold. 

I stopped by the next day for lunch and ended up leaving with more than I anticipated. They have a fridge and freezer full of goodies...sausages, chops, and various sides are ready to go in the freezer, while the fridge has cucumber salad, sauerkraut, kraut slaw (yum), german potato salad, macaroni salad, and more. The thing that really gives this place a hometown feel is that they have a small shelf with chips and candy. They also have 3 little tables with the red-checkered table cover, the place is AC-free (just like the old days of summer)...its feels like a smalltown general mart :) 

The deli counter offers an array of sausages plus different sandwich salads (ham and chicken) to go. But you can walk right up and order lunch! The choices were polish sausage, brat, or pulled pork. For $7 you get the sando plus a bag of chips and can of pop. Not bad for a homemade chunk of meat! 

I got a small tub of german potato salad, small tub of kraut slaw, a pulled pork sandwich, and a polish sausage on a bun with kraut and tomatoes (all to share with my hubby, of course). The german potato salad had a creamy-saucy type of texture to it that German potato salad should have. It was really good...if I could change anything, I&#39;d maybe make it less sweet and add a bit more vinegar. But I still really enjoyed it and am glad that I got a small tub of it to munch on all weekend. Speaking of vinegar, the kraut slaw was off the beaten path. I was really wondering how it was going to be different than regular ol&#39; sauerkraut...well, the name &#34;kraut slaw&#34; says it all. It&#39;s very much like a vinegar-and-oil cole slaw, but with kraut. It has bits of peppers and onions in there, with some spices that help to give it a tangy flavor. Again, glad I got a bunch of this to eat all weekend. 

The sandwiches REALLY hit the spot. The french roll in which the pulled pork was stuffed into offered the perfect texture against the tender shredded pork. You got more than your fair share of pork too, definitely worth your dollar. It had a definite smokey flavor to it that blended well with the sweet BBQ sauce that was slathered on top of the sandwich. I really glad that the sauce was put on the sandwich afterwards and not mixed in with the beef, because you could really pinpoint all the flavors out of the meat, bread, and sauce. The polish sausage was great on its own...again, the bun went really well with the link. When you ask for tomatoes, you better expect tomatoes...I think an entire tomato was quartered onto this! The sausage was cooked to a good consistency...a slight firmness on the outside, but once you bite into it the inside is juicy and flavorful. I&#39;m in heaven just thinking about it. I&#39;ll admit, it didn&#39;t taste like any polish sausage I had eaten before...much like the pulled pork, it had a smokey flavor to it (possibly due to how it was prepared). But I loved that it didn&#39;t taste fatty or salty, like many store-bought sausages do. It tasted like I was eating real hearty meat. 

If you are running errands on a Saturday morning or afternoon around Naperville, do yourself a favor and stop in to this neighborhood meat market. It is literally in a neighborhood, so you might think you are going the wrong way, but then there it is, small and family owned like it stepped out of the 1960&#39;s. The place is small, but the sandwiches and meat pack a punch that will leave you dreaming of sausage (does that sound bad? Maybe?). I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll ever return to store-bought polish sausage again!"

I asked about the tamales I ordered and they told me &#34;oh we don&#39;t have them.&#34; why didn&#39;t they tell me this over the phone. Also I asked if my steak tacos were in the order repeatedly and they kept telling me yes.

Overall it was a horrible experience and I will never go back even for my free taco. I am going to have a field day when I talk to the manager/owner of the restaurant to let them know how horrible of an experience I had at their place.

Love,
a very dissatisfied hangry man!"

There is a bit of a language barrier here though.  I order the Steak Torta, and sometimes they give me options to as what kind, but unfortunately I have no idea what they&#39;re talking about.  I just want a plain ole steak torta.  One time I ended up with some thin breaded steak, which did not please me.  If you speak english try and talk slow for them or you&#39;ll either get the wrong order, or have to repeat your self a few times.  Also consistency.  Some times the torta has beans, sometimes it doesn&#39;t.  Personally I generally like mine with beans, but since the first one I got here didn&#39;t have any, I prefer mine without out them from here.

So, they have a couple things to work on, but since the torta is so kick ass, I can only knock 1 star off."

Our first time here and we could tell that the main chef is based from the southern region of India, however they alo serve break fast (usually not so common of Indian cuisine places in north America) and also do North India and Indo-Chinese fusion cuisine as well. We ordered the Idli appetizers (which is steamed rice dumpling made from rice batter), served along with 3 different dipping sauces or &#39;Chutneys&#39; (tomato, cilantro &amp; coconut) and &#39;Sambhar&#39; (a spicy vegetable-based soup accompaniment). Decent so far. We also ordered a Biryani, which was well done, a vegetarian (Paneer - Indian cottage cheese) Manchurian dish and I noticed an Andhra Pradesh (a state in Southern India well know for fiery preparations) entree called &#34;Kodi Vepuddu&#39; which chicken dry cooked in hot chillies and strong spices. I liked it although I would have preferred more boneless pieces. We also got a Chef&#39;s special - Pomfret fried fish (popular again in the coastal regions). Service was a little slow, but that can be overlooked as they are still working out the wrinkles. I expect to visit again. The place is huge - almost banquet like sized."

I stopped in for lunch and boy is there menu amazing. I got the 3 Maki lunch special. For only $14 I got miso soup, house salad, and my choice of 3 make rolls. What a deal!

The miso soup was delish and the salad was flavorful. I appreciated that both came out right away. For the maki part of my meal, I went with the spicy tuna, crunch roll, and salmon avocado roll and all three were scrumptious. This sushi was super fresh, well put together, and not to mention beautiful!

Our server was very nice and attentive. The restaurant itself is trendy, put together, and clean. I love that you&#39;re able to see the chefs making the sushi. On a Tuesday during the lunch hour it was a very quiet and relaxing experience.

The interior is small, but trendy. Makes you feel like you are in a little city bistro type place but in the middle of a suburban outdoor mall. Specialty rolls are the front and center here as they have an extensive list. They have a traditional roll list but it&#39;s smaller. I went with a friend and we each indulged in one specialty roll, and on traditional. I got a tuna/avocado as my traditional and the caterpillar as my specialty. She got spicy tuna and the California sunset. All four were creative, fresh, and packed with flavor. But these were just the tip of the iceberg. The menu is extensive, so many great combinations, I have to go back &#34;soon&#34;.

The prices went up a little since my last review, but the quality is still there.  I feel like with these prices, they could at least provide complimentary hot tea.  If you want some, it&#39;ll cost you $2 for unlimited refill on hot green tea.  The service was good.

Uni-toro tartare (appetizer special) $18 - I love this appetizer.  All the flavors work well together when they are mixed and eaten with the crispy seaweed.  There are about 6 seaweed pieces that comes with this appetizer.

Truffle Bluefin (appetizer special) $12 - There are 2 pieces to this appetizer.  The Bluefin, avocado and roe were mixed with a sauce and served on a thin chip.  This was good, but I wanted to taste a bit more truffles.  For the price, I would rather have more of the Zuke Salmon.

Oyster Motayaki (appetizer special) $10 - There are 2 oysters to this appetizer.  This baked oyster was good, but I wouldn&#39;t say $5 good.

Uni Shooter $7/ea - The uni in this shot is magnificent coupled with the quail egg.  In retrospect, I wish I could have gargled this for a while before swallowing.  Also, I could have use a little less of the liquid, it was a bit salty.

Soft Shell Crab Appetizer $10 - This single soft shell crab was lightly battered and perfectly cooked without any fishy taste or liquid dribble.  It&#39;s cut into 4 pieces and is average pricing for the appetizer portion.  The presentation wasn&#39;t that great.

Nigiri Salmon $3/ea - Nice and buttery.

Zuke Salmon  $3.75/ea - Seared salmon marinated in house special sauce and served with enoki mushroom sautéed in white truffle oil.  This nigiri had very good flavors!

Chef Soon&#39;s Special Maki $18 - This roll wasn&#39;t on the menu.  It&#39;s a roll with yellow tail and truffles.  I didn&#39;t really like the liquid sitting at the bottom of the roll and the flavors were ok.  I think I like the richer and crunchier types of rolls over these lighter and citrusy ones."

We ordered 12 nigiri pieces, 2 regular sushi rolls, 1 chef soon special roll, and some apps.  The prices here are on par with some of the high end sushi places in Chicago.

All of the fish had very little or no taste to them. Not that they should be fishy, but each fish has a distinct taste. Most pieces here had little to no flavor. I don&#39;t make sushi, I just eat a lot of it, and this was the most flavorless sushi I&#39;ve ever eaten.

Notable pieces:
* tamago nigiri-taste like custard. That&#39;s a tamago flavor I&#39;ve never had.  Jiro would spit this one out. 
* chef soon special-we were served this roll last. At first I thouGht this roll was great, there&#39;s flavor! Then I realized I was just enjoying it because it had some (any) flavor... the truffle oil. When I put the fish side of the roll on my tongue It again tasted like nothing.
* tuna avo roll-the rice had some black sesame mixed in which was a good touch but of the 6 pieces some had an ample amount of tuna and others less than half that amount... :/

The wasabi was on the bland side (lacking heat). 
The waitress got our order wrong. I didn&#39;t mention it as we are never going back. 

The presentation of all the sushi and nigri ordered was spot on for contemporary. The sushi rice was well prepared. And the service, besides getting the order wrong, was good and attentive. But like all my reviews the star rating is simply on the food."

We are glad to have Chef Soon and his staff back. Chef Soon Contemporary Sushi &amp; Bar is at least a partial reboot of what was once our (previously) local favorite sushi spot, Blu Ginger. BG itself (I think) was a reboot of the previous Blu Coral. I have never been 100% sure about that second relationship. However, considering that CSCSB still has a roll called &#34;Blu Coral&#34; on the menu, that both predecessors shared a common color element in the name (&#34;Blu&#34;) and physical location (around the corner and in front of CSCSB in an older part of the same &#34;Seven Bridges&#34; plaza) I&#39;ll lay a bet on it (a SMALL one). It was good to see some of the same staff that fed our cravings for all those years. It was even better to find that the quality of the ingredients and skill of preparation have also not changed.

Having done a bit of reading, I guess I can answer my own query about the pedigree of Chef Soon. It&#39;s amazing what you can learn when you read! It appears that, contradictory to what I have written, Chef Soon was indeed involved at Blu Coral but NOT at Blu Ginger. Though, one of our favorite wait staff in the area was at Blu Ginger and is now at CSCSB (but I think I remember her from Blu Coral too). So, at least some of the staff have been consistent through the years at these locations.

We executed our typical &#39;tour de force pour porc&#39; sampling of sushi and were thrilled with everything that we tried. To briefly explain, this means pretty much a hog&#39;s fest consisting of a piece each for both of us of every fish type available that night, sashimi style, along with a single amaebe nigiri (for me...she doesn&#39;t like the texture...but will eat the legs off the fried head ) and all the uni nigiri that they are willing to bring us.

These two latter ingredients (amaebe and uni) are more of &#34;Rick&#39;s rules for gauging sushi bar quality&#34;. They are comparatively delicate ingredients that a good chef SHOULD occasionally refuse to serve, even if they are &#34;in stock&#34;. Amaebe is raw shrimp, not the fully cooked cocktail shrimp (ebe) that every all-you-can eat Chinese buffet serves you as &#34;sushi&#34; and that many real sushi bars also serve in order to address the potential Midwestern squeamishness about eating raw shellfish. It also, technically, should be limited to certain species, though how would you ever know this! Where are those pocket DNA analyzers that Gene Roddenberry promised! They would allow us to not only determine if we are really being served amaebe and not just raw cocktail shrimp but also to make a stink without the help of the &#34;Action News Team&#34; when the tai is actually monkfish!  Amaebe should be slightly sweet (the &#34;ama&#34; part of &#34;amaebe&#34;), hint at &#34;slimy&#34; (as for any raw shellfish), and be small to medium in size. A Phoenix area sushi bar once did the &#34;American&#34; thing and served me a whopping huge shrimp as amaebe. It was horrible! Some things apparently are NOT meant to be eaten raw! 

When you order amaebe, they should also (automatically) serve you the carapace (&#34;head&#34;) in fried form on the side. DO judge them negatively if they do not! Though, the last time we caught an impromptu sushi meal at a little place in Naperville that has been in business forever, they committed this fatal faux pas and I cut them some slack. I wanted to judge them but I considered the clientele and realized that it was simply an expression of sensible business! In the spirit of beef dishes served at a favorite Indian restaurant in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan Canada (I just couldn&#39;t do it...seemed wrong), every restaurant has to adapt at some level to the palette of the local clientele. I am guessing that fried shrimp head if served in Naperville would likely, more often than not, minimally, be wasted, if not met with outright revulsion. No. You are reading too much into that. It was not a Naperville dig (said the guy &#34;from&#34; Joliet ). 

So that I can use more words, let me also share a &#34;San Diego experience&#34; with amaebe. On that night, I did not feel like having amaebe but we noted that the adjoining table did. We noticed because they brought the head to that table and it did not appear to be fried. Eating it that way would be a bad idea. Chitin (technically, chitosan), the exo-armor material of which shrimp shells are composed, is very &#39;cutty&#39; and would be very chewy. It turned out that this was for show, which we (and &#34;they&#34; at the next table) discovered to some horror when it moved! After the &#34;theater&#34; (sadness?) of it convulsive spasm of leg kicking at the table, it was removed, fried, and returned in edible (and not moving) form.

The rest tomorrow..."

So this jewel is tucked quietly away in an unassuming strip mall and hidden as a Korean BBQ, but don&#39;t be fooled...there is some amazing sushi being served here. 

What makes this sushi so good. First the sushi is so fresh the fish literarily melts in your mouth. There is no chewiness or fishiness...thus allowing the diner to experience all the other different flavors the chef has entwined into the roll.  

So that leads me to flavor. In all we tried 5 different rolls and unlike other sushi locations, this chef really created five different unique rolls using different out of the box items to change of the taste. One had crumpled bacon...wow, another had mango with a little bit of heat, but not hot enough to need water. We also had a roll with a tangy citrus sauce that exploded in your mouth as you chewed.

Now with more chefs, more space, and a trendy design, it&#39;s definitely fast becoming a great spot for date nights before/after the movies in 7 Bridges!  

Service has expanded (more space, more people) to the point where there&#39;s almost too many folks around... (though we came a week after they opened and had a crazy rush of folks, so some balancing may be needed).  Quality continues to be amazing.  

This last trip, we ordered some edamame (spot on, very good...) and a chef&#39;s plate of sashimi to split.  The fish quality was very high, with nods especially to the yellowtail... it&#39;s some of the best yellowtail we&#39;ve had ever in the US.  While we didn&#39;t get rolls this time, here&#39;s some of the other stand out items from the past times we&#39;ve been there:

Oven Baked Sake Roulade had excellent flavor and texture, with the only disappointment being that it was 3 pieces.  

Ocean Drive Maki was refreshing (as our waitress put it) and tasty, with the cilantro being slightly overpowering.  (To be fair, I&#39;m not a huge cilantro fan, and I think the delicate flavors of this sushi get masked a bit much).

Fireball Maki was awesome.  Fast and slow heat combined due to the spicy mayo (fast) and jalapeno (slow linger) which was balanced just right... it didn&#39;t mask the rest of the ingredients of the roll at all.

Summer Maki was by far the clear winner of the bunch and the most original roll I&#39;ve had recently.  Ridiculously thin slices of lemon topped each roll opening with a light lemon and citrus flavor which ended with the excellent taste of fresh salmon.  Really, I could go back just for this roll alone.

Check this place out.  Seriously good stuff."

THE NEW LOCATION HAS MADE IT EVEN BETTER!  The servers are knowledgable and attentive, the decor is hip yet comfortable....but most importantly the sushi is literally out of this world.  Try the summer roll and the turtle roll - the chef&#39;s presentation of the rolls is beautiful.

My boyfriend wrote Chef Soon a 5 star Yelp review in 2012, and I have recommended it to countless friends/coworkers looking for a great sushi spot. 

That being said; I will not be returning after my experience at their new location. 

The quality of the fish and flavor of the maki rolls continue to rank as some of the best in the area. Some might say that is all you need, but I disagree with the hefty price tag.

Upon walking in the door there was no warm welcome, rather 2 hostesses staring at us without any greeting. 

The vibe in the restaurant is pretentious overall. The wine list is drab and definitely should incorporate some champagne or sparking wine options, known to pair best with raw fish. 

The most disappointing part of the evening was the service. There was no progression to the meal whatsoever. We had 3 maki rolls and sushi on our table at one time, resulting in undesirable warm fish. The whole meal was VERY rushed. It felt as if we couldn&#39;t finish the food on our plates quick enough. They took the last plate away while we were still chewing and replaced it with a check. 

Our check was $120 for a horrible 30 minutes of service. Although the sushi was good, I still left with a bad taste in my mouth."

Second, as to appetizers, the tempura calamari was chewy, not well cooked and in small portion for a high price.  

The sushi plate was also overpriced, of remarkably small quantity for $24 and not well prepared.  The rice was not proper sticky Japanese rice and was undercooked and crunchy.  It was also the smallest quantity of rice I had seen in a piece of &#34;sushi&#34;.  

The miso was a bit bland and not tasty and the salad accompanying the sushi was in small quantity, had limp lettuce and was doused in bland dressing.  

The salmon sushi piece was fine but several of the other pieces were not especially fresh.  

The speciality sushi, such as a dragon roll, was not well prepared and remarkably small quantity for a high price.  

The vegetarian (mushroom and avocado) sushi was very small quantity for a high price and had a strange, almost chemical taste. 

We finished hungry and had to go out for ice cream to cleanse our polluted palates."

The restaurant has a small bar area, a sushi bar, tall white leather booths and a white leather banquette and white leather chairs. The restaurant is low lit and contemporary in style. The sushi is what I&#39;ve come to love...creative, fresh and full of flavors that burst in your mouth. My husband took me here on my birthday.  I ordered the lemon martini rimmed in pink sugar...sweet and light.  We shared the unagi spring roll appetizer, which had eel, cucumber, asparagus. It sat in a tasty peanut sauce. For dinner we shared the hamachi gone wild, blazing mango and dragon fest rolls. The blazing mango was very unique with mango, strawberry and super white tuna with a wasabi drizzle and jalapeño salsa. The sweet fruit balanced the heat beautifully.   The hamachi gone wild is always a fav maki of mine. The dragon fest had soft shell crab, scallion and avocado and it was topped with eel. Very good!  The price is on the higher side but the sushi chefs are fabulous at what they do. Our server was sweet but talked so softly that I had to ask her to repeat herself and we strained to hear her. It prevented us from engaging her on the menu. All in all, still a great sushi place with innovative and creative dishes."

The sushi is great tasting, beautifully presented and the selection is fresh and enormous. That being said, I feel that the rolls have definitely gotten smaller since they moved to their new location, but the price has not gotten smaller. The specialty rolls are from $16-18. I especially love the millineum and summer rolls. They taste wonderful, but one is almost not enough now that they have made them smaller. The hot tea used to be free but not any more. 
Service is adequate, not especially friendly and this place is not at all a take your time kind of dining experience . I&#39;ll definitely go back but plan on spending a fair amt. of cash to be satisfied. Have not had any alcohol there so can&#39;t speak on their wine or libation list."

I love a great value but this place was fantastic.  For the purists out there who love great fresh fish and not just &#34;goopy&#34; rolls with everything but the kitchen sink and a big blob of cream cheese......You may have found utopia outside of the city.  They even had blue fin toro!  (Hard to find these days.). What made them so special was the sushi chefs attention to detail and simply not compromising on quality.  His creativity and selection rivaled some of the better sushi bars I have been in over the years.  If you are looking for the cheapest sushi bar or an all you can eat value....it is not.  What it is....... is great sushi and quality but you will pay for it.  Their signature nigiri was fantastic!  Loved the zuke salmon, mackerel and yellowtail.  The creativity here was off the charts awesome.  The chef impressed me with his creativity, quality and purist mindset.  Yellowtail with sautéed banana peppers on the yellowtail or the zuke salmon marinated in house special sauce with enoki mushroom sautéed in white truffle oil.  For the real &#34;foodies&#34; out there....it won&#39;t disappoint.  I would have given it a 5 star rating, but seating seemed cramped.  Food definitely five stars*****!!!!!  But....for those of you want to find that special place where great sushi can be found.....WELCOME!  Oh yeah.....if  you want to taste something really awesome....order a Negi-toro hand roll, (belly side bluefin tuna,  otoro, with green onion).  Maki selection was fantastic and created sensory overload as there were so many wonderful and unique selections.
Enjoy!  Lastly.....I am making this a five star choice after all.  Excellent Sushi......this will satisfy the most discriminating sushi enthusiast!"

We had the Seven Spiced Ahi (Ahi minced, bottom crispy, and a thin slice of jalapeño on top), Dragon Fest (eel, soft shell crab, Avocado, cucumber), Fireball (Jalapeño and Spicy tuna...very spicy), Chef Soon&#39;s Special Maki...very different and refreshing that you must try, and Spicy Tataki (Soft shell crab and Spicy tuna). All very delicious and small bite size pieces that will fit into your mouth. I would definitely come back with some friends to try their other special Maki. I barely dipped my sushi in the soy sauce here, I definitely recommend eating some sushi without the soy sauce. The price may be a bit high, but the quality of the ingredients I believe are better than most sushi places that focuses on all you can eat style."

I would describe the food as innovative but approachable, the atmosphere as relaxed clubby feel without being over the top. It is pretty clear that chef Soon and his staff care a great deal about details and it comes through in the food.

I especially liked there was Asian men making Sushi. Sushi is very much of an Asian cuisine, and must be made by Asians. 
Saw no one but Asians and I felt a bit appreciative. Also, I have learned Chef Soon was one of the very first original Sushi Chef in the State of Illinois taught by the Master of Sushi from Japan. I&#39;m talking back when Sushi was not in every corner.

Despite going on a Saturday night (6:30. I made a reservation, and it was necessary) our waitress was friendly and attentive. Our drinks never ran out (including water). I wish I had caught her name - she absolutely deserves a shout out for how good she is at her job.

Notes on our order:
The mint and cucumber salad is a favorite of mine. The ginger dressing really makes it. It&#39;s a nice way to start an order. It is large - splitting between two people was a challenge. It works better for three or four, in my experience.

This time, we ordered exclusively off the signature maki section of the menu. It is a little pricier (16-18$) but the rolls are larger. Most have around 8-10 pieces, although those that don&#39;t (like the king kong roll, pictured below) had six and they were large pieces. 

We started with the tropical island and the king kong. The tropical island is a perpetual favorite of mine. It&#39;s a nice way to start (or finish) an evening. It has relatively mild, but well balanced flavors and just enough heat to enhance everything. Tuna is the main fish in this and it works well for these components.

I was surprised by the king kong roll (a first for me) and was a little leery about the size of the pieces. They held together well, though, and were easy to eat despite requiring multiple bites per piece. Again, Chef Soon did a nice job balancing out the elements of this roll and the added textural components made it really inviting (especially, I think, if someone is new to sushi). 

The Blazing Mango (not on their menu that&#39;s posted online, for the record) was interesting: it has mango and strawberry so it&#39;s sweet, but it doesn&#39;t overpower the salmon. I thought some of the other components of the roll would limit the influence of the fruit but I was wrong: it comes through very strongly, which I found interesting. If you aren&#39;t a fan of sweet, you may want to give this a pass. Alternatively, I think this would work nicely as a final order in lieu of a dessert. 

We ended on the summer roll, which is a citrus-heavy primarily salmon based roll. If you do not like strong citrus, give this one a pass: they actually have very delicate, very thin slices of lemon over each piece. The vinaigrette is another layer of citrus flavor. Because there&#39;s a fairly substantial piece of salmon on each piece, it has enough substance to hold up to the lemon, but it could be slightly overpowering if someone isn&#39;t a fan of that acidic flavor. I really liked it and found it a great way to end our meal. It was very refreshing."

This is the case for Sushi by Chef Soon. It has over 150 reviews on Yelp and the restaurant doesn&#39;t even have a sign - they actually share a space with a Korean BBQ restaurant. It has the level of creativity and presentation to the likes of downtown Chicago sushi restaurants but in the suburbs in Lisle. 

Not all spicy tuna&#39;s are created equal. The spicy tuna here is exceptional since it&#39;s not your typical heavy mayo maki. Instead, you can still taste the tuna while getting heat from the siracha sauce and an aftertaste of sesame oil. We ordered several maki rolls and each were made with precision. I was impressed at how quickly everything came out even though the presentation and quality were stellar. 

We also ordered the oyster motoyaki which could be described as a Japanese take on oysters Rockefeller. It was a perfect appetizer - a succulent oyster with a creamy and citrus aftertaste. I would definitely come back just to try more items on their menu because there were dishes and combinations that I&#39;ve never seen before. Make sure to explore the menu thoroughly.

However, the two most important factors of a restaurant-food and service-were right on!

For appetizers, the shumai was good-very hot temperature-wise, so make sure to let it sit before biting into.   I really enjoyed the house salad-fresh, crisp vegetables and a perfect slightly creamy and sweet ginger dressing.   The filo wrapped ahi was just o.k. as the dough was a bit burned.

The seafood was as fresh and high quality as I can remember at any local sushi restaurant.   The special we ordered-Hamachi Gone Wild-was something-yellow tail wrapped around more tuna with a terrific garlic/guacamole sauce.   It was served with bacon as well as part of the sauce, but it being a Friday during lent, we had them leave off that ingredient, which will attract me back on a different night of the week and/or outside of this time of year.  White Sox roll was good-shrimp tempura with spicy tuna and avocado, and the King Kong roll was good as well with the perfect blend of spice and sweetness.

I&#39;ll definitely go back and the menu contains quite a variety of kitchen appetizers and the amount of specialty rolls is great."

The best sushi is the zuke salmon. It&#39;s to die for. It&#39;s a must. 

Other rolls that are good are the seven bridges roll, sunrise roll, and mango roll. You really cannot go wrong here. It&#39;s a small restaurant and they are super friendly. It&#39;s in a building with a Korean restaurant that&#39;s yummy too b"

We had actually went to Seocho Garden on Saturday at 9:15 PM and was told that it would be another 30 minute wait just to get a seat for their all you can eat Korean BBQ. We looked over and saw that there was an open area where they were serving sushi and decided to sit down. There were no signs advertising that there was even a sushi restaurant on the inside. So we just thought it was one in the same business. It&#39;s a cozy little setting, the tables are a bit close to one another, but the chairs are actually quite comfortable. Our server was friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable of the menu. We ordered 4 rolls and it was made fresh to order and brought out fast.

Maki:
Spicy Scallop for $8, relatively large roll, cut into 6 pieces. Nori on the outside, rice and filling on the inside. The spiciness of the roll was mild, lots of vegetation, and minimal scallops. I could have done with a little more scallops. I would probably order this again in the future to give it a 2nd try.

Specialty Maki:
Kamikaze  for $14, fresh tuna over a spicy tuna roll. The spicy tuna had the burn you are looking for in something spicy. Loved it. This is a must order if you are a fan of tuna.

Red Dragon for $14, fresh tuna over tempura soft-shell crab had the right balance of crunchy to soft ratio. The crab was plump, juicy, and tender without being overly greasy.

Tropical Island for $18, fresh tuna with mixture of scallop, crab meat, and shrimp, and mango wrapped with mamenori and topped off with a hint of citrus vinaigrette and drizzled with citrus mayo and chili sauce. This mixture of goodies was thoughtfully put together. It was delicious. You get big chunks of tuna and mango that works harmoniously. The only complaint is that chef could have gone lighter on the citrus vinaigrette, citrus mayo and chili sauce that was topped off the roll."

Don&#39;t be fooled by the presentation. At first I was fooled by the picture posted on yelp and by the reviews that people claimed. I can tell you that they try to make the sushi look good yet when you taste it is disgusting and not fresh. The aftertaste fishiness made me almost regurgitate. I am no connoisseur but I know what good sushi taste like and bad stuff taste like. I didn&#39;t mind one bit waiting in line for 2 hours in winter time for sushi dai in tsukiji fish market in Tokyo.  

Most importantly, this restaurant has no sense of customer service. They are oblivious and do not care about whether customer is happy.  They could careless if they lose me as a customer coz they have plenty other customers. I should have known better when Koreans try to pretend they are Japanese to making sushi. 

Anyway. Go at your own risk"

They have a patio outside, more staff than their last location, and an extended menu with sushi and non-sushi options. You pretty much need a reservation otherwise you&#39;ll be waiting a while on the weekends! We love the Smokey Bear and the agedashi tofu.
__________________________________________________________________________
This is one of the best sushi places in the suburbs considering price and quality. The sushi is always fresh, the service is always good (pleasant moods and also prompt service) , and the price is always right. 

They offer standard maki and individual pieces of sashimi and they have a long list of specialty rolls. They also have daily/weekly specials and ice cream mochi (try it!)

Right now it&#39;s located inside of a Korean restaurant where a booze bar would be (they made it a sushi bar in this case) and since they just rent that bar space, it gets filled up fast. You almost always need a reservation. Luckily it looks like they&#39;ll be opening their own space at seven bridges soon so there should be more table space when that happens."

I am rating a five star for the freshness of the materials. This place is quite packed when we dined there and we ended up seating at the bar. It was not very comfortable. We ordered 5 rolls and maybe 1 appetizer. However, when the bill came it was $110. We never tried to estimate the bill but for 5 sushi rolls, $110 is a bit high. With tips we were paying $130 for one sushi meal! With this amount we can choose a much fancier French restaurant with 3 courses, while we were seating at the tight bar in Chef Soon Contemporary Sushi."

The restaurant is in the corner of a strip mall with a few other cafes and businesses.

Anyways,
The food is great!!! They have a variety of rolls to choose from, and each one is very unique with some very interesting ingredients. We tried the crunchy melt roll which had melted cheese on top.....definitely worth a try but I would not order it again. 

The Gyoza was AMAZING!!!!!! The prices are a bit high and the service is kind of slow but this place is worth a try for some good sushi."

Quality has gone down and prices have stayed high here in the past few months. They switched from Boars Head to Dietz and Watson and the change is very noticeable. Their best sandwich, the twisted reuben, now has chewy less flavorful corned beef on it.

Sweetwater Deli seemed like an ideal place to get one. It&#39;s located in the very cool and historic downtown area of Lemont.

The interior is clean and features the historic architectural details of the space. Check out the ceiling if you want to know what I mean.

I ordered a muffaletta sandwich, the New Orleans classic which features a bayou take on giardiniera, though the NO version features olives prominently in the mix. As it turns out, Sweetwater sells its own version of the crunchy spread in the tiny market area of the deli.

The muffaletta was just about perfect. It was filled with a bounty of high quality salumi and provolone cheese on a hgh-quality roll. It was pretty substantial, so I saved half for a later meal.

Any town or city would be lucky to have a deli as well-conceived and run as this one. Check it out."

I&#39;ve been here before and wasn&#39;t disatisfied until today. My friend&#39;s italian beef beef sandwich was barely warm. I ordered the Greek Lemon soup and it was terrible. The soup was actually curdled. It was obvious that the egg yolks  were not tempered when added to the broth, as the broth was lumpy with cooked eggs. It was more like an egg drop soup than a lemon soup. And it did not have any lemon taste. I took it to the counter, asked for a refund, explaining that it didn&#39;t taste good but was denied. I was told to give it to someone else. I left it on the table when I left. I won&#39;t be returning anytime soon."

There is a menu to order off of as soon as you walk in. You order and they run it out to you in no time at all. 

I had the BLT &amp; we shared the chicken salad. Both are a must try! I know you can get a BLT anywhere but this one was just different (in a perfect way) ... all of the ingredients were perfectly proportioned. Seriously. SO good. The chicken salad was just as yummy &amp; next time that will be my sandwich of choice.

Thankfully Sweetwater is here. I&#39;m very picky when it comes to eating out, so please don&#39;t think that 3 stars is bad. I wish we could give half stars, if so I would give 3.5. 

The food is consistently good. There is no wow factor for me, but I&#39;ve never had a bad meal. I had a meatball sub once and wasn&#39;t impressed. The meatballs were kind of bland. The sauce was not bad but it didn&#39;t help the meatballs at all. 

I usually stick to the BLT&#39;s. It&#39;s a very nice sized sandwich that fills me up. My coworkers get takeout here at least once a week and they always enjoy it too. The salads I&#39;ve seen are a nice portion. They don&#39;t have a salad I would order though. They have some good soups, but since they have so many &#34;soup of the day&#34; in rotation, if you were to find a favorite, there is no telling when they will serve it again. 

I&#39;ve never dined in, but it has a cute little dining area if you chose to sit and be served.

Downtown Lemont is quickly becoming one of my favorite weekend stops thanks to joints like Sweetwater Deli. Anyways, tried my hand at their Chopped Salad (minus bacon) and some of the more talked about chicken salad. The chopped Salad was solid, stocked with mountain of chunked chicken, and married perfectly with their House Dressing. The chicken salad was a little less my liking. Too much basil and dill, in my humble opinion, needing to be put back in the box as opposed to straying far from it. My co-diner thoroughly enjoyed her BLT Sandwich, quoting it &#34;amazing&#34; and perfectly constructed. I didn&#39;t partake but my mouth was certainly watering watching her dive in. Icing on the cake had to be grabbing a beer and wine. Nothing extraordinary, but cafes and liquor consumption aren&#39;t an everyday partnership, so combining the two only drove up their stock. Food and drink prices seemed reasonable storewide...especially $3.50 for Sierra Nevada Pale Ale! Plenty of deli take home options, as well as pre-packaged grocery accoutrement. Definitely will be stopping back to further explore their menu, and enjoy some chill time with my P.I.C. Tina N."

Because they are on fire.  Now I&#39;m not saying this is the best sandwich in the world, or the county for that matter.  But this is a solid sandwich that I will be ingesting again.  As they say somewhere: Yummers.  

The pretzel bun is a must, and let me tell you why.  Its not super chewy as some pretzel bread products can be.  It was perfectly fresh and i could almost taste a bit of love in the baking.  And it was prefect for the sandwich I got due to the high pile of meat.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this sandwich with the high meat to bread ratio and the minimalist approach to mustard and hot peppers.  I was full after half but couldn&#39;t stop myself from finishing it off.  

Sweetwater is a great place to stop for lunch if you can find a table or have your food to go.  And the general store aspect could be very convenient too."

And...the vegetable wrap.  While the veggies were extremely fresh, it just lacked flavor.

On my first visit, I really appreciated the atmosphere, as it was when I had first moved to Lemont, and I got to see what a great community feel the downtown has.

On my second visit, I got a to-go order of their House Chopped Salad, and it was extremely good.  It was probably on par with Portillo&#39;s and their chopped salad.  Incredibly fresh, and with a bright, flavorful dressing.  I loved it and it was enough for 2 meals.

30 minutes later, no response, no word on whether the WiFi was broken, whether they had even tried anything. I go back to the counter to see if anyone even bothered to look at the problem. Two separate staff members give me this response:

The grilled chicken sandwich is excellent. The chicken was moist, the pretzel roll was fresh, the roasted garlic aioli gave it the perfect amount of kick, while the roasted red peppers gave it just a hint of sweetness.  Perfection!  I&#39;m also a big fan of their Italian sub.  The meats and cheese are fresh, and the homemade dressing they put on it is SOOO good!

Their soups are also fresh, delicious and homemade...just what you would want out of a bowl of soup.  Their pasta salad is good and not overly oily like most delis.  The homemade coleslaw rocks my socks.  It contains big chunks of perfectly dressed cabbage.

Try a Labriola Bakery whoopie pie (like the bread, it&#39;s delivered fresh each day to the deli).  Holy childhood flashback, Sweetwater!  It tastes like a classed-up, adult-ified version of a Little Debbie Zebra Cake.

Lemont needed a nice but casual place like this, and I really hope people give it a try."

Lemont is such a cool, historical town and when I walked into the deli, I had a feeling like I was walking into a modern flashback (if that&#39;s possible).  Decor had a great old-time feeling to it, but was mixed with modern technology and colors.  

We had already looked at the menu online and knew what we were ordering.  I am an Italian Sub Lover and my husband is loves Corned Beef and at Sweetwater, the Corned Beef is a Panini, also another of his favorites.  

Because Sweetwater is already a deli, their meats on the sandwich were super-fresh.  I enjoyed the slight bit of spiciness coming from the sandwich.  My only 2 commetns were  that the piece of lettuce was HUGE, and that it could have used a tad bit more salad dressing on it.  I wouldn&#39;t say it was dry, I&#39;m used to having Italian Subs have a bit more dressing on it.

My husband loved his Corned Beef Panini.  His only comment was that he wished the cheese was a bit more melted on it.  Otherwise he loved the kraut, with the marbled rye, thousand island dressing.

We also ordered a small pasta salad to go with our sandwiches which either needed to be stirred or have a bit more dressing added to it.  It just didn&#39;t have much flavor to it.  

Overall, for under $20, 2 good sandwiches with side pickles, 2 bags of chips, 2 sodas, and a small pasta salad in a great old-time, modern setting - we will be back."

We got a smorgasbord of different foods: chili, pasta fagioli, mac &amp; cheese, the italian sub, the grilled chicken sandwich on the pretzel roll, and ended it all sharing a large piece of tiramisu. Out of all those, I&#39;d say the chili was the best thing on the table. Probably the best chili I&#39;ve had in the suburbs, maybe even in the whole Chicagoland area. It was everything you would want in a chili. The exact opposite of the $1 bowls you would get at Wendy&#39;s. Don&#39;t get me wrong though, all the other food was great. The mac &amp; cheese was blessed with what I believe the owner said was 4 different cheeses, and each cheese was tasted with every bite. I like my mac &amp; cheese to be slightly more cheesy, but it was perfect for my gf since she&#39;s not that big of a fan of my style of M&amp;C. The subs and sandwiches were made fresh and were hearty too. The Tiramisu was not too sweet, almost at a perfect amount of sweetness, with not much of that strong alcohol flavor that can be overbearing in cheaper Tiramisu (I say cheaper since this huge 5in x 2in rectangular slice was only $4.50). Oh yeah, I have to add that most rolls and pastries were delivered from Labriola which is something I like. If you don&#39;t make your own bread and pastries, at least get it from 1 of the better places around the area. 

So overall, Sweetwater Deli was a complete success of a trip, and my girl and I will be back soon. Probably tonight since typing up this review is making me hungry for their chili now. 

The GOOD: Everything on the menu but especially the chili. Try any of the daily specials too. 

The BAD: The location - Lemont is kind of way out there. My girl likes to describe it as &#34;a town off on its own little place.&#34; I will say it is well worth the trip though. 

The UGLY: The car in parked in front of us that had the license plate &#34;Twist F 8&#34; Probably the only terrible thing I saw that night haha."

I had the soup/sandwich combo, which was a tasty cup of chili and the grilled chicken sandwich on a pretzel roll.  My partner had the large soup of the day - stuffed green pepper - which was really good, and the full-size Italian beef sandwich.  Needless to say, too much to eat in one sitting!  The deli ambiance is interesting, lots of products (pastas, sauces, spices, along with deli meats and cheeses) I can get elsewhere, but will make a point of getting them at this lovely place in the future.  Friendly, prompt service and easy parking ensured a return visit!"

We&#39;ve been there several times now and each time the food has been great. I really like a lot of their appetizers/small plates. The lettuce wraps are probably my favorite, but the dumplings and rangoon are fantastic as well. The great thing is is that you can tell everything is made in-house. The house chili sauce/paste is unbelievably good too. Even the sweet &amp; sour sauce (which I generally just don&#39;t care about) is really tasty. My main recommendation would be the thom kha gai (coconut soup) though. Everything about it is excellent.

Other major pluses are that the restaurant is very homey yet tasteful and Mrs. Choun is super-duper nice. She goes out of her way to make the dining experience nice and REALLY cares about using the freshest ingredient. She is such a warm person. Such a change from the nasty jerks that run the Thai take-out place down the street on Main. 

Thai iced tea was really good too. Easy parking. Plenty of street parking and a parking garage right across the street when it&#39;s busy on weekends.

They also deliver via bitesquad.com! Delivery Thai food! Finally!"

My husband, who owns Art &amp; Glass Studio on Main Street, recommended we try this place for our occasional &#34;date night,&#34; and we were both pleased with the entire experience!

On our way into the restaurant I held the door for a woman pushing a cart overflowing with fresh produce, and it was Ms. Choun herself! She visited our table after Andrew, our adept and courteous server, took our drink orders; she was warm and cheerful and spoke with pride about freshly preparing each dish to order.

I have not been a fan of Thai food in the past, as I&#39;m used to it tasting overly salty and processed, yet the crab rangoon, shrimp pad thai and beef panang curry was superb! I&#39;m taking my co-workers there for lunch next week! The atmosphere, the server and the food...all get my highest accolades!!"

It was empty on a Friday night, and I do think they need to do some advertising and get the word out! Maybe a Groupon would be a good idea. 
We had the Chouns combo appetizer platter, which was great! Love the pot stickers and the crab Rangoon fab! Then we both ordered the pad thai, hot quick and good!  
The only thing I would say is that the service was awkward, waitress walked up to the table and said nothing- we kind of looked at her like, hi, how are you, she kind of awkwardly answered not great, I think because it was Friday night at 7:30 and EMPTY! But she never said- would you like to order a drink, or anything in fact, I finally just ordered. Then I ordered the appetizer and that was delivered with 4 sauce/toppings and she didn&#39;t say anything about what was what. They need an experienced wait staff, a Groupon and should seat all the folks in the window- then folks will think they should be there!"

I believe they moved location and changed their name. The FOOD is AMAZING! I went there after working a long day on a Saturday in downtown Wheaton and decided that I didn&#39;t want to cook so I opted for carry out. I ordered the Crab Rangoon, Drunken Chicken, Chicken Satay, Lettuce Wraps and Spring Rolls as a sort of small plates/share with my husband. WOW! He loved every last bite. His fav was the Crab Rangoon and Lettuce Wraps.....now he is saying that he can&#39;t choose between the two. The ingredients are soooooo fresh! As an owner of a small business in Wheaton, we need to support other small business&#39; and give them great reviews when they deserve it! 5 stars!!!!!

The server, Andrew, was very nice, prompt and courteous. We had pot stickers, rice lettuce wraps, my kids shared the lemon chicken entree, pad Thai and drunken noodles. Cant go wrong with pot stickers and lettuce wraps were ok, more rice and lettuce than chicken and a little more spicy than I anticipated all the listed flavors didn&#39;t seem to meld so it was a little disjointed. My girls ate all the lemon chicken and fried rice (the fried rice was quite good- tons of veggies).  Pad Thai was pretty good and the drunken noodles were bland, not my husbands favorite (and he&#39;s had a lot of drunkin noodles). All in all, it was ok but not great. I wanted it to be better bc it so hard finding good Thai food in the &#39;burbs.  Will probably get pad Thai take out from them again.

I try every thai restaurant I possibly can, and when I heard a new restaurant was opening in my home town, I just had to try it! To start, the decor and ambiance of Choun&#39;s is fantastic! Looks, and feels great on the inside, the service was great, and the whole vibe of the place was spot on. 

My girlfriend and I decide to try the crab ragoon. It comes out and wow! It is literally the BEST crab ragoon I have ever had anywhere, at any style of place. Full of flavor, crab, cream cheese, and perfectly crispy. I order Tom Yum soup and a chiken fried rice. The Tom Yum is similar to many other thai restaurants, flavorful, big, fresh ingredients, but pricier than most places for the size of the bowl. Then comes the nasty part.... I try the chicken fried rice..... I want to spit it back out! There is NO flavor whatsoever, I taste a mushy rice, with massive CUBED pieces of chicken that have a rubbery texture, and zero flavor. 

What started out as one of the best Thai lunches in my life, quickly turned into the worst. In my mouth I literally taste a white rice and chicken mixed with veggies. No oil, no spice, no flavor whatsoever. I can&#39;t believe this recipe is used in this kitchen! In addition to the dish being so bland I didn&#39;t want to eat it, when I initially ordered, I asked them to make it spicy. When I said this the waitress looked at me like I insulted her. I promise I only wanted a spicy dish. Many other thai places are more than happy to make my dish spicy and put flavor in it.

I will be giving this restaurant one or two more shots to give them a second chance, but I don&#39;t have high hopes after my first experience here. I will edit my review accordingly if i find it necessary. I 100% recommend you go somewhere else for thai food, unless you are going for soup and appetizers only."

I moved away a few years ago to the West Coast when the owner was still in her other restaurant in town. Every Thai restaurant I ate in out West paled in comparison.I cannot tell you how happy I was to discover that Choun opened this newest restaurant! I&#39;ve been missing this delicious food for 5 years! 

I ordered my old favorite, Tofu Pad Thai and Veggie Egg Rolls. It. Was. Back. Oh how my taste buds squealed with delight! The Pad Thai is traditional and what makes it special is freshness and a light touch with the sauce. Too many others drench the noodles in sauce. Also, the tofu is abundant and very fresh, as are the veggies that garnish with eye popping color! An eye appealing, filling yet light and refreshing dish!

The egg rolls? Well, what can I say. They truly are the best of hundreds. Maybe thousands. The wonton is light and flaky with the most delightful crispy crunch! The veggies, so fresh and with a bite, perfectly cooked. The flavor without the dipping sauce is so good you can eat them alone. But the sauce... You will want to pick it up and drink it out of the dish.

The atmosphere and ambiance are friendly, comfortable and contemporary. Choun clearly leads this place with her heart. You feel it when you walk in the door as her beautiful smile says hello and you can taste the love in her food. Make your heart and your taste buds happy. Visit Choun&#39;s today!"

My husband and I adore Thai food and have tried several places in the area without much luck. Our usual &#34;go to&#34; is Andy&#39;s Thai Kitchen in lake view neighborhood downtown which is AMAZING. Anyways, We were anxious to compare the two when Choun&#39;s opened since it&#39;s so close to home. It certainly did not disappoint!  The Tom Yum soup was delicious with perfect sized chunks of chicken and lots of delicious veggies. The coconut milk in the broth was velvety and not over powering. Perfect amount of heat and spice. Fantastic!  We also ordered the appetizer combo which includes potstickers, chicken satay, egg roll and crab Rangoon. All were totally delicious but my only critique is that I think there could be a bit more for the price. There was plenty of the dipping sauce leftover and I felt sad it would go to waste since the appetizers were gone!  I think a couple more crab rangoons and another satay and egg roll would be appropriate given the price. It was totally delicious though. For entree I ordered the Panang curry with beef and it was heavenly. Perfect in flavor and the beef was cooked to perfection. Not tough and melted in your mouth. The spice level was great. My husband ordered the basil Thai chicken dish and it was average. They may have went easy on the spice level since our son was there and was going this share. The veggies were fresh but the chicken was fairly boring and the overall taste was just average. We probably wouldn&#39;t order it again but that&#39;s okay because there are many other delicious looking items to try on our next visit. Overall it was super authentic and came close to meeting our expectations when compared to ATK in the city. We will definitely be back."

There are a ton of tiny tacquerias in this area, but Le Quebrada is one of the best.

The inside of this place reminds me of the Williamsburg Diner on &#34;Two Broke Girls,&#34; minus the sassy waitresses.  My waitress was very friendly.  All of the other customers here were Hispanic, which is usually an indicator to me that the food is authentic and good.

I had 3 tacos:  steak, chicken, and pork.  They were all really good, I think the steak was my favorite though.  Tacos are topped with the traditional cilantro and onions, but I added some of the salsa and green hot sauce too.  That nearly made my head explode from the spiciness, so tread carefully.

The chips and salsa were OK.  The salsa was too watery for me.

They have horchata too.  Yay!

The food was fresh hot and very authentic tasting to this Texas girl and self appointed Mexican food aficianado. I feel that a little more salt was required on most of the food but that&#39;s really not a criticism. The salt shaker was easily in my reach. The guacamole was fresh, the warm salsa served us when we sat down was really authentic and some of the best I&#39;ve had. The chips seemed to be house made and I found that really a positive.

It was absolutely outstanding!   
Tender and authentically seasoned with first rate accompaniment like fresh made tortillas, rich salsa served hot; The works.
Had the Queso Fundido Con Chorizo appitizer that was a perfect match with the fresh warm tortillas. This place was busy and full of happy locals.
Authentic recipes made with fresh ingredients, served by knowledgeable, happy, professional staff. 
In a city with a great, well established tradition for quality Mexican food, Le Quebrada stands out with a modern, clean and comfortable dinning room, fast service and delicious food and fair prices. 
I cant wait to go back and try something else.
I need a nap."

The place has a nice dining area with a combination of booths and tables.  They have a large menu with selections of meats, seafood, and even breakfast.

I&#39;ve had two different versions of their skirt steak.  One with cactus and one just marinated and grilled.  Both are very tasty and well done.   I also had the large meat grilled combo (PARILLADA DE CARNE) and the serving was just like the photo - large!

I would also recommend the tamarind fresh juice.  It&#39;s traditional sweetened juice from a ripe fruit.

In all, this place has great food that&#39;s fresh and not over cooked like most places are."

They are really good! Despite the fact that I had no idea what they were saying (Gringo Loco)

I  passed this place by my estimate about 1,400 times (going to work) in the past few years, never tried it until tonight! 

The setup: 5pm on a Sunday. PACKED! I&#39;m gonna take that as a good sign! Me my wife and kids sit in just a few min. 

The Place: La Quebrada is a somewhat old school Mexican Restaurant. Inside is decorated,but slightly dated. 

The Staff: Everyone was very friendly and helpful! No complaints! 

The Food: 1-10 scale
Chips and Salsa: Good crispy chips with strong corn flavor. The salsa was hotter than most so the kiddos did not touch it(great for me!) 8

Quesadilla:Small with really good cheese! 9

Carne A La Tempiquena: Steak was killer and full of flavor! The Enchilada has a Sweet Mole sauce that I was not expecting, but tasted great! Beans were good and rice was standard(full disclosure, I&#39;m not a fan Spanish Rice so don&#39;t listen to me about the rice.) 10

Tacos(one chicken,one steak) I would go for the chicken over the steak, but both were pretty good. I&#39;m on an 8 since I&#39;ve had a few better in the area, but these are top three for sure!

Huaraches: Bargain! This is a nice large serving and heavily topped! Awesome! 10

I kid you not, this really happened:  While we were dining, a cockroach suddenly started crawling up the wall right next to me in our booth.  Shocked, I jumped out of my seat as my friend summoned our server, pointing to the bug on the wall.  The server tried his best to quickly &#34;hush us up&#34; then, using the towel in his hand smashed the roach to death on the wall - smearing both the wall and the towel - then finally scraped what was left of the dead bug off of our table with his hand.

I feel that the rice and beans of a Mexican restaurant tell the DNA of all the food on the menu. If good, being the simplest of dishes, it can make or break the reputation or a mexi joint. I&#39;ve had some garbage out there, but here. Oh here., is so good. 

Amazing. Just quality. Flavor, not too salty, not dry. Just perfect.

I had my go-to, chicken flautas. He had fajitas. Can&#39;t go wrong.

We went back again and I had enchiladas. He couldn&#39;t get enough of the fajitas. 

Every time we go, we eat too much and leave with leftovers.

I decided to write this review immediately after my first meal at La Quebrada.  I ate so much that I&#39;m pretty much useless for anything besides sitting and typing right now....

To start, they bring you chips and salsa.  The chips were wonderful, and the salsa was served warm, which made a bigger difference than I would have thought.  

I ordered a three taco dinner with rice and beans (which, for comparative purposes, is usually what I try first at any Mexican restaurant.)  The chicken taco was great, as was the pork taco.  The big winner here was the steak taco - one of the best I&#39;ve had anywhere!  All three were served on really good homemade tortillas.  Oh, and let&#39;s not forget the side of rice and beans, which was almost good enough to be a meal on it&#39;s own....

La Quebrada might be a little &#34;out of the way&#34; for many people, but it&#39;s easy to find, and worth seeking out.

While cleaner than most, on this most recent meal we did find one fly looming around our table (perhaps because we were very near the entrance). The tacos and enchiladas needed some salt and salsa -- which has just enough spice and heat to let you know it&#39;s there but not so much that it will scare you away. The example pictures on their menu don&#39;t make the food look aesthetically pleasing or inviting but when it arrives on the table you&#39;re never disappointed. Their guacamole is damn tasty, but also needed some salt to get the right flavor that I was looking for. Their parking lot leaves a lot to be desired and the restaurant is not in the best neighborhood, but do yourself a favor and stop in for a tasty lunch or dinner."

The restaurant is a small stand alone on S Broadway, just south of downtown Aurora. Once you walk in though, you feel right at home, even if you do not speak much Spanish like me. The waitress was VERY helpful, despite my linguistic inadequacies. 

My buddy and I ordered ceviche to start things off, and start things off well, it sure did. I ordered the Pechuga Suprema, which was a grilled chicken breast and ham, slathered in a sauce which I believe is primarily cheese. Seriously, this deal is the ultimate comfort food. The chicken is cooked perfectly, not dry or undercooked. Buddy ordered the skirt steak which was juicy and flavorful. Both our orders also came with rice, beans and a small salad. Seriously, for the average eater, this is a feast. For a fatty like me, it actually took some work to down all of it. They have a very extensive menu of awesome and authentic Mexican food. I may just go broke trying all of it. 

The food, 5 stars. The service, 5 stars. The environment is brightly lit, warm and welcoming, and makes you feel at home, as does the service and food. I have been told the horchata and margharitas here are amazing as well. 

I went home and knocked out the moment I saw my couch. THAT, is an indicator of just how good the food is.

The salsa was pretty good, it was warm and spicy, love the spicy, jury is still out on the warm salsa.  Guacamole was fresh but needed some salt.  I ordered steak tacos, they were okay, I&#39;ve had better.  My partner had the steak burrito, her opinion was the same.  I think I should have been more adventurous and tried the carne asada, I just didn&#39;t want to eat something quite so heavy after 8 pm.

This place is no frills, and you might almost blow past it if you&#39;re zooming down Broadway from the north (look for the bright orange building on the right), but BEST FOOD EVER!

My boyfriend, his sister, mom and I went here for his birthday; I picked it based on Yelp reviews but otherwise was flying blind. They have a big menu, including lots of seafood and a number of soups, which is somewhat unique. Some of the items are described in somewhat vague terms, but our waiter was very kind to clarify.

For drinks we partook of augas frescas (piña, melon) and horchata, all of which were very refreshing. 

A guacamole appetizer and smoky warm salsa satisfied everyone (including the one-year-old nephew, who wanted in on everything, including the hot stuff!)

But the real prize was the actual meal. Everyone got something good: enchiladas in green chile sauce for bf&#39;s mom, grilled shrimp for his sister (with the shells on, oddly -- made it hard for her to wrangle those plus the dining one-year-old), pechuga sureña for me (also known elsewhere as pollo poblano: grilled chicken breast in a cream sauce with roasted poblano chiles -- delicious!) 
But my boyfriend was the clear winner with the Carne a la Tampiquenia: grilled skirt steak, plus a cheese enchilada covered in a smoky molé sauce. We all vowed that when we return (and we will) we are all ordering that!

Our waiter was very helpful, swift and unobtrusive. The place was full of people yet somehow wasn&#39;t too loud, though partway through the meal someone got the jukebox going so some warbling Mexican polkas geared up. 
We thought we might get some live music at one point when a guy and a girl came in with guitars, but they sat around for a while and then left, so perhaps they were just itinerant musicians hopeful for a gig and looking for one on the fly. In any case, no go. 

Overall, this meal couldn&#39;t have been much better if it tried. I feel like going back for dinner tonight! ¡Que aproveche!"

I really wanted to love this place as I love Mexican food and I have yet to have a favorite Mexican restaurant. Based on all the &#34;rave&#34; reviews, 5 stars, really? I had to try this place.
The waitstaff is friendly and bus boys continually refresh your chips and salsa.
The salsa is good and served warm, but the flavor is not exceptional and the chips are hard and thick and not warm. I love spicy so I asked for a side of fresh jalapeños and they served us japs out of a jar. C&#39;mon a fresh jalapeño, that should be easy. 
I ordered a Corona and the waitress brought it with a frosted mug, the mug had lime juice in the bottom and salt around the rim, nice.
I Loved it.
I ordered the Carne a La Tampiquena, skirt steak and cheese enchilada which comes with refried beans, Spanish rice and guacamole. The steak was very good but everything else on the plate was cold. The cold beans were bland, the cold enchilada sauce wasn&#39;t tasty and the cold Spanish rice wasn&#39;t worth sending back to be warmed up. Also, at the end, we were given someone else&#39;s check, an honest mistake, but it&#39;s a good reminder to check your bill. I can only give this place two stars because there was really only two things I enjoyed, the steak and the Corona.

Aye Caramba!! Why is it so hard to find good mexican food in Aurora?? Well when I saw this place packed with Mexican people I was hopeful but alas it was a huge let down. I&#39;ve had lots of good Mexican but primarily in Chicago, Texas and Mexico. This shows you that when there is nothing better around people will give a place a good review. Just like good Chinese food in the western suburbs good Mexican food is almost an impossible find.  The decor is nice and family freindly.I ordered variety of things off the menu for me and my family to try and here is the breakdown on what we had. Even the things I had that are labeled as &#34;good&#34;  are not &#34;great&#34; or worth going out of your way for.

Margaritas - some of the worst I&#39;ve had anywhere
Guacamole - pre-made from the fridge bland and cold - pass this up.
Chips - obviously from a bag.
Salsa was warm and good.
Queso Fundido with Chorizo - pretty good probably the highlight of the meal
Nachos with Steak - Not sure if this was steak or rasins my son had it and it was lame.
Chicken Mole - my wife had this and the amount of chicken in it was ridiculous the mole sauce itself was mediocre to weak
Carne Asada A La Quebrada - this was recommended as the house special and is essentially skirt steak with an enchilada. It was average as it&#39;s generally pretty hard to screw up Skirt Steak. The enchilada was okay as well. For the price though I&#39;ve had much better."

If you ever have a craving for delicious, homemade, comforting masa-based dishes--you know, on  those rainy, gray days that chill your bones--then definitely stop in here for delicious tortillas and sopes. I saw they also have huaraches and other delectables. YUM!

We went on a Saturday night &amp; drove right past the place - it&#39;s small &amp; not well lit. We got in there &amp; I swear I had flashback&#39;s to my aunt&#39;s basement back in the day. Rancheras playing on the jukebox, very basic decor...very simple. Based on that, I knew we hit the jackpot.

My husband ordered the carne asada tampiquena &amp; I got cheese enchiladas - both were hands down the best we&#39;d ever had. Especially the best we&#39;d had in the west burbs. We took our first bites &amp; just looked at each other stunned at how good it was. This is the real deal. They don&#39;t waste money on making a fancy restaurant, they put their money into quality ingredients. Our food was phenomenal.

It&#39;s right along the Fox River so next time we plan to go during the day when we can enjoy a walk along the river &amp; lunch at La Quebrada. I highly recommend giving it a try. Friendly people &amp; amazing food."

The meat was very flavorful, juicy and had nice grilled / smoky notes.  It was surrounded by a savory tomato-based broth and smothered with melted cheese.  Really, really good.  The beans were good too, but the small salad was just a little pile of iceburg lettuce with a couple of cucumber and radish slices.  I liked the chips and salsa brought to the table.  The chips had a tender baked consistency.  Nice service, clean, small and homey feeling.  The hot tortillas brought with our meal were covered with a hand-embroidered white cloth.  Sweet."

I remember passing by this place a million times, but always forgetting that I wanted to try there.  One of my friends just got done telling me about this place, and it&#39;s her mom&#39;s favorite Mexican place.  (They&#39;re hispanic so I knew it had to be somewhat decent).  

The waitress was so nice.  Not sure if she spoke a ton of English, but I knew she could understand me and I could understand her when she spoke to me in Spanish.  The first thing that came out were some chips and salsa.  So GOOD! Salsa had that spicyness that creeps up on ya after you&#39;ve eaten your 20th chip.  I had the Mole Enchiladas (Thanks Rachell J.) and mi madre had the langoustines.  Both were very delicious and I would definitely order them again.

Oh and word on the street is they make their own tortillas.  If I&#39;m wrong, somebody is makin them because they are fresh fresh freshhh!! So delicious."

La Quebrada fits in that category as it felt like walking into a liquor store.  Atmosphere was as no frills as no frills gets.  

Waitress was very nice, she knew English just to let everyone know.  I got 3 tacos, steak, chicken, &amp; pork $1.75 each, and a pork burrito $5.25. 

I knew the food was going to be good, the tacos had a ridiculous amount of flavor and the burrito was up there as well.  Absolutely top notch!     They truly deserve all the hype!"

Their Clamato and beer was great, and their salsa was really great too. The red was smoky and a bit spicy, the green-mild was good if you like green sauce. Chips were yummy, and the tortillas were amazing -- and homemade! The chorizo and eggs was a smaller, delicious portion and the boy&#39;s tacos were all eaten with gusto, so I assume they were good.

Guac was homemade and great, not watery or spiced with artificial flavors. All in all, amazing food and good prices. The decor is very divey, so be prepared."

The food here is amazing, stumbled upon this place by heading down Broadway going to the post office.  I&#39;m so happy that I did.  

Had Cheese Enchiladas, and a Chicken Taco, all for around 7 bucks.  I had my Enchiladas split, 1 Mole, and 2 Verde.  Of course I was scared to try the Mole&#39; because it is SO HARD TO FIND A GOOD ONE, but boy was I surprised.  The Verde and Mole were equally excellent, as was the flavor of the juicy Chicken Taco.   So follow this checklist to find good food in your &#39;hood. 

Looks like a &#39;hole in the wall?
Servers aren&#39;t smiley and chatty?
Mostly locals eating there?

If all three of these questions are can be answered with True, then most likely the food will be AMAZING! 

I will be back."

I had the Cheese Enchiladas with Mole, side of rice and beans. My wife had the chicken enchiladas verde, side of rice and beans.

The mole was bitter. The verde was bitter. The rice was ok, but bland. The beans had a taste to them that I have never tasted in refried beans before...possibly too old, not sure.

Service was slow. You also have to go stand at the counter by the door to get your check and pay. They don&#39;t tell you this, so just do that if you go instead of staying in your seat waiting 10 minutes for the server to bring you the bill."

We decided to take a bike ride to Phillips Park on this glorious day, to view the Sunken Gardens and get some much needed exercise.  I was starting to get hungry on the way over, and La Quebrada is right on the Virgil Gilman trail, on the east side of the Fox River, on Hazel and  S. Broadway (Rt. 25)...so I suggested we go there on our way back.  So...we dined at this fabulous restaurant in a non pristine neighborhood (which we kinda like!) and had scrumptious, reasonably priced fare...she had huevos, hashed browns, rice and beans and I had a tongue taco and a cheese and onion enchilada draped in mole sauce.  
The funny thing is that during our conversation, my friend told me she had heard of a fantastic Mexican Restaurant on Farnsworth and New York St., and asked if I knew the name??  I didn&#39;t...and then I read here that there is a La Quebrada in that very place...I guess they&#39;re just rockin&#39; the Mexican food all over...deeeeeeelish!!!!"

I&#39;m extremely picky when it comes to Mexican food.  La Quebrada is the polar opposite of the corporate americanized Mexican restaurant.  Love, love, love it.

Here&#39;s some things, if you&#39;re a gringo, that you need to be aware of before going.  a) you&#39;re going to be a minority, so if that makes you squeamish or uncomfortable, than don&#39;t go, b) it&#39;s not in the most white-bread of neighborhoods, so if you&#39;re one of those people that locks your doors when you see someone of color on the street, than don&#39;t go, c) if you&#39;re put off by possibly having to negotiate between with some broken English, than don&#39;t go, or d) if you believe that the immigration problem is the most serious issue in this country (instead of hunger, health care, gas prices, social security, homelessness and everything ELSE truly more important), than don&#39;t go

But if you&#39;re looking for good, authentic, and affordable Mexican cuisine than this IS your spot in the Fox River Valley.  We arrived early on this day (11/10/2007) and seated ourselves.  Our waitress came to the table and gave her best English, but when I responded in Spanish, a smile across her face made us both realize that we were both trying and it&#39;d be okay.

We started off with a Queso Fundido con Chorizo ($6.95) because frankly, we can&#39;t find a place in 630/331-land that does it right and we just knew this would be the joint.  It was.  It arrived with the most fresh, homemade tortillas that I&#39;ve had in a couple of years.  I could still smell the warm masa.

I ordered the Carne Asada en estilo La Quebrada (as Larry had) for $12.95.  MK ordered the regular Carne Asada w/ a side of cheese for $11.95.  Both arrived at our table hot and made perfectly! (see my review of El Taco Grande, Batavia for MK&#39;s last horrible experience with Carne Asada).  Both of ours come with the traditional refried beans, rice and lettuce/salad.  The skirt steaks were tender and juicy and grilled perfectly.  MK actually looked at mine and said that &#34;next time, I&#39;m getting yours&#34;.

To answer Larry&#39;s question about what the &#34;special sauce&#34; is.  It&#39;s the salsa that they give you with chips when you sit down.  It might be a bit more mild though, but I asked and was told it was the salsa.

There are no desserts listed on the menu and we didn&#39;t actually ask since we had planned to use a gift card we had from Cold Stone that night anyway.  But I will be sure to ask the next time we go.

Lots of families eat at La Quebrada and they do have live Mariachi music on the weekend (they were eating dinner when we were).  I think as mentioned, if you&#39;re uncomfortable being in this sort of situation than you really shouldn&#39;t go, however, you&#39;re letting your fears get in the way of a really good Mexican meal.  In fact, several other &#34;gringo&#34; families came in while we were eating, so the word has got to be getting out.

They have 3 other locations, 51st &amp; California in Chicago, Central &amp; Roosevelt in Cicero and one other location in Aurora on New York Avenue (closer to Farnsworth).

OH, we didn&#39;t try the Margaritas or beer, but everything looked GREAT and we&#39;ll definitely be &#39;avin the &#39;rita next time."

The rice and beans are tasty and fresh.  Tortillas are generally hand made and delicious.  Meats are typical quality of those found at other restaurants.  What sort of differentiates this place from others is the &#34;salsa.&#34;  It is served warm with chips that can at times be hard on the mouth, if you know what I mean.  The tacos de &#34;suadero&#34; are very good.  It&#39;s one of those places that you enjoy eating at and then you get a bill and you question how and why you spent so much there.  Like I said, good choice overall but not a cheap eat.  If you want to be adventurous, check out the food at the local flee markets!!"

It&#39;s located in a plaza with decent amount of parking. I was seated right away and though there wasn&#39;t too many people there, there were enough for lunch time and many to go orders I noticed as I was sitting there.

Surprisingly, my order came pretty quick and well prepared just how I like my pho, with the rare meat on the side so it&#39;s not overcooked in the broth.

Now everyone knows you can&#39;t beat home made pho, but I really thought the broth tasted pretty close and flavorful to what I would get at home! The only thing missing and maybe something they may consider for future menu items is adding oxtail to it. 

I usually like to season my pho with many flavors, but the default flavors did most of the work and I didn&#39;t need much in it. Pricing was reasonable, I guess similar to most pho places, place is clean, and service was excellent. This place calls for a 5 Star rating."

To begin with he asked us what we wanted to drink, while he had both his hand resting on our table and leaning forward. Which I think is very inappropriate. I was even leaning away from him. And I&#39;m not one to have a big radius on my comfort zone. 

So I ordered the bun bo hue from a server, and the owner brought me a wrong dish. Then I asked him &#34;that&#39;s not the bun bo hue right?&#34; (Because even if I&#39;m not Vietnamese I knew what BBH is because a good friend&#39;s mom makes it for me, and I love it). And he said no. I told him I ordered the bun bo hue.. no. 40 on the menu. Then it seemed liked he wanted to make it seem like I was the one who ordered wrong. He called the server who took our order and even opened up the menu for me to point out which one i ordered. I reiterated &#34;I ordered the Bun bo hue... no. 40&#34;. I told him i&#39;ll just take the wrong dish that he brought out home if he could still bring me the bun bo hue. And the owner was all like &#34;oh okay&#34;. He was unwilling to do a compromise that it was getting very awkward.... I didn&#39;t want it to be taken of the server&#39;s paycheck whom was very apologetic that he put down the wrong order.. but I still had to pay the full price of that dish which was more expensive than what I originally had ordered. 

Taste wise, their broth was a bit bland. Other food we ordered were on par with most vietnamese restaurant&#39;s I&#39;ve been, nothing special. Price wise it&#39;s mid-ranged. I mean, 8 small fried dumplings/wontons or what have you were priced at $8. 

Would I ever go back? Since it&#39;s only 5 mins. away from where I live I&#39;d probably give it another try. I just hope I don&#39;t have to deal with that guy. I&#39;m pretty easy to satisfy I mean I didn&#39;t even review the  decorations they&#39;ve had because I think that&#39;s insignificant when you get good food &amp; service. But for the sake of people who want&#39;s to try this place out. It is clean and not rundown. Again, I just hope the next time I try it they&#39;ll have a better system and customer service in place.

Though it&#39;s a great dish, it&#39;s the only dish many people know and Vietnam cuisines have SO much more to offer. A lot of these dishes looks simple with just broth and noodles but it&#39;s the broth that can take several hours or at least half of the day to simmer. Much love and patience goes into cooking Vietnamese noodle dishes. 

It&#39;s been only 3 weeks since my first visit and I&#39;ve already been here three times, case in point that this place is great. A lot of people don&#39;t know how much work it takes to cook Vietnamese food and for the sake of time and money, and pure indulgence I would rather just find a great Viet place and be a patron for all of my motherland cravings.  

Aside from their excellent food. The service is also very nice here as well. They could use a bigger budget for decor but perhaps once they took off the ground, as I foresee they will, it will be an easy feat."

This place is still fairly new about 2 months open. The place is big, no frills, clean, and nice service. I came on a week day afternoon and there was no wait in fact we were the only ones. We had: Vietnamese ice coffee (I wish it was dripped right at the table, egg rolls, spring rolls, pho Dac Biet, and pho tai bo Vien.  Everything was delicious! The pho broth tasted like Chicago&#39;s pho. The only short coming is that they did not have soy bean milk (my girls favorite)."

Finally a worthy pho restaurant!  I&#39;m from the Magnolia neighborhood of Seattle, we have pho left and right that&#39;s held to the high standards of the local hipsters ready to rap out a yelp review on a moment&#39;s whim.  With all due respect, I&#39;m not a hipster, but I love my pho options in Seattle, I hold them sacred like Indiana and that little golden statue.  Pho Bac, Green Leaf, Vietnam, Monkey Bridge, to name a few.

With that said, there are several aspects of pho one must experience to attain a true rating of the heavenly experience.  Primarily and center stage is broth, Pho95&#39;s broth is an 8 out of 10, I consider it very good, tasty, not greasy, not MSG-ie (no spinal column fuzziness afterwards), yet has a considerable taste that keeps your soup spoon hand alert.

2nd I&#39;d give the meat a 9 out of 10, rare, red, well cut, tender, fatty flank was mixed well with brisket, plentiful.  You can have a small/medium here and be well fed.

3rd would go to freshness of sides, jalapenos, bean sprouts, basil, all fresh and plentiful.  10 out of 10 here, very fresh, no changes.

Last thing would be the service and let&#39;s be honest, if you&#39;re leaving a review on a pho restaurant and you&#39;re pissed about the service, move along.  Who the eff cares, you&#39;re lucky to have this food as an option from a business that has decided to serve it.  Eat your pho, pay your bill and move on, life doesn&#39;t get much better than this.

With that said, the service was overly exceptional.  Right on time, quick to serve and refilled waters when half full.  I&#39;ll be back every time I come down, new staple for my 5 day work week!"

Carried out spring rolls, banh mi, traditional pho, grilled pork ribs with rice and grilled chicken with rice vermicelli.  
Let me start by saying how impressed I was with the freshness of everything. From the spring rolls, to the herbs with the pho to the rare sliced beef. Very nice quality.
The broth for the pho was steaming hot. The spring rolls chilled. If you get the rice or noodle dishes I would ask for a side of rice paper. 
My only complaints would be I didn&#39;t have any pate on my banh mi and the chicken in my noodle dish was a little over cooked but that&#39;s really all.
Big portions. Low prices. And the little girl at the front podium is adorable! She even came around to open the door for me when I left.

The shrimp spring roll I ordered was fresh and tasty. The pho (medium vs large serving; medium is big enough for most)? It was very good. Nearly PHOnomenal (did I just suggest a new Vietnamese restaurant name?).The noodles did not come in a clump (I&#39;ve been to places that served the noodles like so). There was a generous amount of meat. But, the broth, or soup base, as it should be, was the star. It was clear and refreshing. None of the tastes were overpowering. The soup is what makes or breaks the pho. Pho 95&#39;s soup base definitely makes the pho and much more. Loved it. This clean and unpretentious place will have me returning for more.

The food is pretty decent bar food. In my few visits, I&#39;ve had the Grilled Chicken &amp; Wild Mushroom Press, a burger and the Sprecher Root Beer-Braised Beef and Gouda. This root beer beef/gouda sandwich was apparently featured as one of Chicago&#39;s best sandwiches in 2011, but is way too weird for me to enjoy/ever order again.. The burgers and chicken mushroom sandwich were both tasty alternatives though. And you can have them served with tater tots, which I love!

They have pretty decent wings but the cheese cures are amazing and they come with this chipotle cheese sauce that is ridiculously good!

The kinda late like when it&#39;s a Sunday and you&#39;re unemployed (though not for long) and awake at midnight and needing a soft pretzel dipped in melted beer cheese immediately kinda late. Not to mention that a place anywhere outside of the city like Lemont is even less likely to have this sort of late establishment. This was an awesome find.

The food: beer cheese soup and steak and ale wedge salad for me, tipsy stout burger for the guy and pretzel sticks to share. 

The server: one bartender who came around just enough and brought the still-hot food out ASAP.

The place itself: super empty at 12am, but big enough to host a lot of people. I can imagine it being rockin&#39; on a weekend afternoon.

This food was amazing. The pretzel sticks completely exceeded my expectations - they were gigantic, salt-sprinkled magical wands of pretzelized dough garnished with parsley and served with both mustard and a Guinness cheese sauce. They were hot enough to sizzle my fingers when I touched them at first. And there were about 5 sticks for two of us and it more than satisfied. The beer cheese soup was gooey and wonderful. The wedge salad had a LOT of steak and blue cheese and bacon which ended up being too much for me in the moment, but I had also had bacon for every meal that day so maybe it was the wrong choice. It was absolutely delectable, though. 

My guy&#39;s burger was good (I had a bite, queen mooch that I am) and he enjoyed the pretzel bun in particular. All of this wasn&#39;t cheap and it was definitely enough food, but dear lawd did it hit the spot. I will be dreaming of those pretzel sticks for days. Tap House, you win."

Who only has 1 waitress for an ENTIRE room on a Friday night?  Was given a beer menu, 1st 2 drafts I picked, was told there are out of, which took 20 minutes because she was the ONLY waitress working.  Food prices are on the super high end for BAR FOOD.  $10 for guacamole and tortilla chips is a little ridiculous.  Sandwiches/burger/tacos all are over $12.  I got their &#34;2011 Chicagos Best&#39; sandwich, Sprecher Beef &amp; Gouda.  Came with no gouda and hardly any meat, so my toasted bread sandwich wasnt good.  I will not speak for the others in my group, overall a bad experience."

The bar, the food, the service was all a full one star at that! Bartender was inattentive and was more worried about keeping his starched shirt clean.

The service at the bar on this busy Friday night was spot on.  The food was good and once the crowds dissipated, the noise level was bearable.

I went with the bartender&#39;s recco of a Kobe burger with Tater Tots (LOVE tater tots!) and my friends went with the chicken pot pie (it was a cold night perfect for comfort food) and both came up quickly and were quite good, if our empty plates were any indication.

The odd part?  There are slot machines in the corner and one guy sat there the entire time I was there trying to win.  Felt a little odd to me but who am I to judge?

Plenty of free parking (it&#39;s the burbs) and large seating areas make this good for your group or equally as good for just the two of you.

I&#39;ll be back . . . . .might wait til it gets warmer, though, as they have a patio that looks like it would be fun in the warmer months!"

Most of the time there is only one waitress/waiter who is to busy chit chatting with his/hers regulars, than actually serving there customers. And when there is enough servers they still suck.

Food- Good
I usually enjoy the food here. Their pricing is fairly reasonable. They once tried to charge my group $4.50 for a side of pickles. General Manager tried to explain that they are house made and each batch takes 8 hours, that&#39;s why they&#39;re so expensive. 

Service- often lacking sometimes a joke. 
The reason I say, &#34;often lacking&#34;, is because this place rarely has enough staff.  One time the GM jokingly said &#34;Fuck You&#34; when my girlfriend ordered a mojito. Jeff, we aren&#39;t friends. You can&#39;t joke like that, fuck you. Another waitress told us that the bartenders purposefully make the mojitos bad so people won&#39;t order them again. New management could do wonders for this place. 

Atmosphere- clean/comfortable
Music and decor is good. TVs on every wall with many options. Games available for those who are into that. 

Overall- 
I don&#39;t know why I keep coming back to this place. The food must be it. They also have a pretty extensive beer selection though most of the staff isn&#39;t knowledgable on it. If the staff/management improved, I would gladly rate this place 4-5 stars.

UPDATE: The restrooms are disgusting. This place needs help."

Walked in on a Saturday night at 6:30 to meet some friends for dinner and the place was empty. There were maybe 3 other parties in the entire restaurant. I ordered a Down South Sweet Tea, which came in a glass filled to the top with ice. Even on my first sip, it was already so watered down that I&#39;m not even sure there was any alcohol in the drink at all. My friend ordered one as well and said the same thing. As my dinner, I ordered the wild mushroom and chicken press. The aioli sauce was amazing, but the mushrooms were slimy (obviously not fresh) and the chicken seemed like it was microwaved in a bag before being put on the sandwich. The best part about my dinner at Tap House was, by far, the tater tots! They were crunchy, but very soft at the same time.  Another positive was the service! Our server was very attentive, friendly, and timely, but it ended up to be about $25-30 (per person) for sub-par food and drinks. Unfortunately, I probably won&#39;t be visiting again."

I initially enjoyed everything about the place. The food was excellent. The beer choices were varied and plentiful. The servers were friendly and attentive. The decor and ambiance were clean and inviting. I was going the Tap House Grill at least once every week.

I began to notice that things were beginning to change for the worse. I noticed a reduction and frequent turnover in wait staff. Their schedules were either reduced or they just moved on. The quality and care in food preparation was declining. The craft beer menu was getting shorter and beers on the menu were often not available. The patrons that added spirit to the dining experience seemed to stop showing up.

Three experiences helped in my decision to stop wasting my money at the Tap House Grill.

1. Management let all but two servers go home for an evening. Patrons flooded the restaurant after the wait staff already left. We had to be served at our table by the bartender, who was understandably busy filling drink orders at the bar. It took about 45 minutes just to order our meal. Drink refills weren&#39;t frequent either.

2. The Tap House started a VIP program. I dutifully completed my application and handed it in to our server. I still have not received a response. I am yet to receive my $10 sign-up bonus. I guess my previous patronage record was not deserving of VIP status.

3. Being charged for a 1-2 ounce sample of beer at a craft beer establishment was the final insult to my loyal patronage. Are you kidding?

Having a bad experience just once at any venue is excusable. Things happen. It is time to find a more hospitable place after consistent disappointments on return visits. How&#39;s the saying go? &#34;Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.&#34; Nobody likes to be a fool."

But, its hit or miss on the food. I got the stuffed burger, and asked it to be cooked medium well. It was cooked rare, and I sent it back. On another visit, I tried the prime rib sliders. I got fatty gristle on a bun. I sent that back too. On both occasions when I sent food back, they were very concerned about getting the order correct. 

Some of the food was very good: shrimp tacos were excellent, nachos were good, and the $4 bloody Mary on Sunday is a great deal.

I couldn&#39;t tell who the wait staff were since they were dressed like customers.  Finally I grabbed someone who looked like the help and they hurriedly told me I could sit anywhere.  I wound up at the bar since the view of the TV was best there.  I did not get any service and had to ask for menu.  

The menu looked pretty upscale - wild mushrooms, kobe beef, pork belly, truffled aioli - all make appearances.  I opted for chicken and wild mushroom panini, which said on the menu that it came with brie cheese.  I didn&#39;t want cheese so I asked for &#34;no brie&#34; and I told them I was in a hurry.  The sandwich came in about 15 minutes but sure enough, there was cheese on it!  I complained to the bartender and she looked at it and said that the cheese was mozzarella, not brie.  I checked the menu again and the description said brie cheese, without mention of mozzarella.  She apologized and comp&#39;d the entire sandwich.  I informed the bartender that she should let the owner know the menu is misleading.

Anyhow, the menu has potential if only the service and execution were up to the task.  Alas, not today."

We had the bruschetta for a appetizer and it&#39;s really good, probably the best I&#39;ve ever had! I had the shrimp tacos and they were also really good and flavorful, an item that is not even available at the plainfield location. The server was really prompt and friendly too!

We went here for a fundraiser organized by The Hope and Friendship Foundation to help a family in need. I think it&#39;s great that Tap House donated 10% of their sales to help this family.  Very generous!  The place was packed inside and out--and music was live out on the patio, where we ate and enjoyed watching all of the hustle and bustle of selling raffle tickets and such.  I ordered the Tap House Burger and my husband ordered the Wings.  Our waitress was so sweet and explained it may take a bit for our food to come because the kitchen was slammed.  We had no problem with that and our food didn&#39;t take as long as we thought it would.  My burger--done exactly how I asked and it was fantastic!  Seriously--medium well has never been this juicy! Full of great flavor and it came with seasoned fries, also delicious!  My hubby loved the wings--really, he just loved them!  Our server was always right there to offer another drink or anything we needed.  I can see that the servers work very hard and never stop moving--while smiling through the evening.  Our dinner was as reasonably priced as it gets.  Really nice service, very tasty food and eating on the patio--What a great combination, and we found it here.
I am excited to visit again.  We aren&#39;t beer drinkers, so that wouldn&#39;t be our draw--the food and service will bring us back.  Thank you for a great night out, and for helping a local family in need."

There is a great variety of different food items on the menu, of which we&#39;ve tried most. Somewhat hit-and-miss, but the good menu items are REALLY good. For appetizers, I recommend the cheese curds (a little salty, but unique batter) or the fried bacon. I feel bad for the reviewer that had a bad cup of beer cheese soup, because I thought it was fantastic. I&#39;ve liked just about every entree I&#39;ve tried, but the Cuban sandwich and the root beer braised beef and gouda sandwich are incredible, though it took me awhile to work up the courage to try the root beer beef (it doesn&#39;t actually taste like root beer, but it is quite tasty). Tuesday night is burger night, and while it&#39;s fun to build your own burger with an extensive menu of additions, they only cook them medium that night, so I do wish they&#39;d let you specify desired level of doneness (probably not a real word).

The beer selection is phenomenal- at least 30 on tap at any time, plus bottles and cans. I almost always try something different, and am almost always completely happy with what I try. They also have periodic events like tapping nights with a theme like pumpkin ales or stouts.

The ambience of the dining room is nice, too. It&#39;s an open design, but the booths are large and feel private enough. There is also outdoor seating when the weather is nice.

We rarely have the same server twice, so employee turnover might be high, but they&#39;ve always been very pleasant and helpful. We had Tap House cater a party, as well, and though it was a bit pricey, Jeff the manager went above and beyond to make sure it was a good experience, including throwing in some garlic bread and the use of their buffet trays/stands and sterno warmers.

After trying several other bar/grills in the area- Davidson&#39;s (good), Stonehouse and Pelican Harry&#39;s (decent), Illinois Bar and Grill (terrible)- Tap House is the only one we go back to again and again."

They just lost money and for something that they could control.  She brought me a burger to replace the salt lick sandwich. I would do the burger again. Great beer selection. Place is tucked away off  State St in Lemont. Outdoor patio too. Ask to taste the pulled pork before you order!

The service was beyond terrible. We probably sat for 1/2 an hour just waiting for a server to take our drink orders, and waited another hour just to get food. I completely understand that yes, the Bear&#39;s game was on, and it was quite busy.....but to wait that long is completely ridiculous! Why don&#39;t they put extra wait staff, or kitchen help on duty those kind of nights when they KNOW that it&#39;s going to be extra crowded!
The food was actually pretty good though, when we finally got it......I really want this restaurant to succeed, but if it keeps up with this kind of service, it&#39;s going to go down the tubes fast!"

Chicken strips are $8.49 (It was $8&#39;something) then to add fries another $3.00. A plain burger is $9.99, doing things like a bacon-cheddar gets it in the $12 price range.

I will go there to eat, but for a hang-out watering hole, it&#39;s too expensive to sit there.

High compliments on fresh battered chicken strips, not frozen stuff many places sell. They batter their fish too. Food is good and fresh and why I will return.

Big complaint is their ketchup. At quick glance of the bottle, I thought it was made by Heinz like their mustard, but the instance it hit my mouth I had to stop using the ketchup. They use Red Gold after further investigation, and it&#39;s awful. The ketchup will keep me from ordering fries. If I want a side, I&#39;ll chose salad or mashed potatoes.

It should be good for Lemont though because food is just not very good at other places."

First visit shortly after they opened was pretty good. Brought us back again and not bad. Came for lunch on a 4th visit and had the burger special which was delicious and reasonable. Came back again on St. Patrick&#39;s Day, yikes worst corned beef ever and the salt content would put anyone into high blood pressure. Service has gone down hill as well with each visit along with quality and quantity of food. Seriously my husband had 7 french fries.. the waitress brought him more when he said something to her but the kitchen didn&#39;t think something looked odd. Burgers have always been good but their sandwiches, forget about it. Ok so let&#39;s talk beer since it&#39;s a tap house. Our family thought ok one last try after um 6 or 7 visits. There was a beer I wanted to try before I ordered a glass. The waitress said, no problem and brought me a plastic container that coleslaw is sometimes served in. I guess because we were seated outside? The little container was maybe an ounce..charged me 3 bucks for the sample! I could have had 8 times the amount for 5 bucks! I thought sheesh and this is why restaurants don&#39;t make it in Lemont. They start out and you want to give them benefit of the doubt and because they get crowed the first couple of months owners/managers think now we can slack and scrimp. Then you see these places no longer crowed and word gets around they are priced too high quality has gone down hill and then they close.
Good Luck."

They will give you free pickles and then randomly they will charge you $5 for 10 pickle slices. Even the staff told me not to get a specialty drink there because they make them poorly so you don&#39;t order them again. $6+ for garbage drink? No thank you. This place is just a let down.

How do you screw up Buffalo Chicken Wrap?  When mentioned to the manager he acknowledged that it is bad.  I ordered the steak and wedge with low expectations since you can&#39;t get great steak for $12.  It was even worse than I expected.  The steak was this over marinated teriyaki fatty and grissley thing.

I will give kudos to the waitstaff.  They were very attentative and did a good job.  This is normally a pain point with new restaurants."

Tucked away on the lower level of the Herrington Inn, Atwater&#39;s is an intimate, quiet restaurant with gorgeous views of the river. When coming for dinner, my husband and I usually like to sit at the bar first - there are only about eight or ten seats there, and the cocktails are excellent. The bar area is situated within the lobby itself, surrounded by old stone; very cozy, and if the fireplace is turned on in the winter, surprisingly warm as well.

The restaurant&#39;s main room is also small, with perhaps 15 tables. If coming for brunch or lunch, request a seat by the window (at nighttime, you might be warmer sitting away from the windows, however, as the room is surrounded by floor-to-ceiling glass). It&#39;s a beautiful dining area, reminiscent of quaint restaurants in rural France or England. That said, if visiting Atwater&#39;s in the summer, you might also sit on the patio!

The waitstaff are all well-versed in the menu, and provide exceptional service, complete with serviettes draped on their arms (lovely to see). The other patrons are usually well-dressed (sans baseball caps, for example) as well.

The menu changes regularly so I won&#39;t go on about particular items. I will say that I have never had a bad dish at Atwater&#39;s. The food quality is top-notch, and the taste/flavor is always excellent. It is clear the chef puts a great deal of thought (and heart) into his food. I highly recommend this restaurant."

My drink of choice is a whiskey sour rocks, shaken with a egg white to provide a smoothness. I order this often around the country. No issues.
I asked barman for a whiskey sour with an egg white on rocks.
I received a house cocktail, which was on the list, a glass with ice which had egg white in it.
It became clear that this is no cocktail or mixology bar. Barman had no ability beyond the list.
As local places like Niche, Barrel and Rye raise their game so should Atwaters bar. I know they think that this is not their market but a rising tide lifts all.."

The prices were VERY expensive.  If the prices were more reasonable then I would give them 5 stars but the outrageous prices did not match the food quality.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, the food was delicious but not amazing.

We started with the pork belly appetizer.  It was good.  Then we had a peach salad and it was very good.  Fresh ingredients and tasty dressing.  I had the Chilean seabass, delicious!  Served over quinoa.  I wish the plate had some greens line asparagus or green beans or something.  My wife had the filet and she liked it as well.

Overall the service was great, very accommodating as I&#39;m gluten free and they were very helpful.  The only negative besides the prices was that there was a 12 person party sitting next to us that was VERY loud.  Because the room was so small it made it uncomfortable.  As soon as they left it was a nice quiet dinner.  I wish they had left earlier.

The decor and feel reminds me of &#34;old money&#34; if you get what I&#39;m saying. The restaurant part is small and intimate. I could see how it can be romantic if you came for dinner. But I love it! Our host, server, bus boy...they were great! Even the manger was out helping on the floor. 

So I had the Atwater&#39;s salad, Braised oxtail and Chocolate Ganache Cake. My husband ordered the Butternut squash soup, Ash encrusted petit filet mignon and the Vanilla creme brulee. Oh my God everything was SO GOOD! I loved the dressing on the salad! My oxtail was so soft and delicious! And the ganache was very rich in flavor. My husband loved the ash crust around the mignon. The lunch menu was $22 a person and totally worth it! I ordered a vodka and tonic and my husband had a house wine = $22. Eh, day drinking at it&#39;s finest.

They don&#39;t have draft beer, but the cocktails are exquisitely made.  I had a gin gimlet with freshly squeezed lime juice.  Best gin drink I&#39;ve perhaps ever had!  

My husband and I had the snapper and sea bass respectively.  Light, fresh, and flavorful--perfect for a summer&#39;s evening.  Veggies were treated with respect which as an avid gardener and veggie lover I appreciate deeply!

We were so full that we passed on dessert, but because we had told them at reservation time that it was our wedding anniversary the chef sent two complimentary chocolate covered strawberries.  We also had a small complimentary appetizer of a chicken flauta as well.  The staff also gave us a card that everyone signed.  In other words, service was excellent.

My only complaint is the parking.  They do not have adequate parking available and they do not have valet service.  So......figure it out yourself I guess.

The food is fantastic and the service is very attentive.  We had the Maryland crab fritters with brie &amp; citrus aioli which were absolutely tasty.  Additionally, we tried the domestic cheese plate complete with Cypress Grove Humboldt fog made with goat&#39;s milk from Humboldt County, California, a Widmer 6 year aged cheddar from Wisconsin and a Carr Valley ménage made from cow, sheep, &amp; goat&#39;s milk from Carr Valley, Wisconsin.  All three cheeses were paired with a tasty something something to complement the flavor.

As a second, we had the tomato basil bisque with goat cheese mousse.  Very good. Finally, I had the ash crusted heart of aged beef strip loin with sauce bordelaise, Chevere corn pudding.  Wow!  I highly recommend.  I also tried my better half&#39;s meal which was the herb grilled filet of angus beef, gruyère whipped Yukon potato with black garlic confit, grilled asparagus, demi glaze.  Equally Wow!  Seriously, both cuts were colored perfectly edge to edge.  Cooked to perfection.

For desert, we had to have the highly touted vanilla bean creme brûlée.  Fantastic!

So, if you can figure out your own parking issues.  Give the place a try.  I would specifically ask if there are any special events which would cause parking challenges (i.e. weddings and fund raisers, etc).  The wedding event spilled over into the bar and created a loud atmosphere in the restaurant."

First, the wine recommendation was excellent. I asked for something that would be good for the one non-eater who was with us (this person of course eats, but wasn&#39;t eating that night. I mean really, how could a person actually be a non-eater??) and that would also be good with the elk steaks that two of us ordered. That&#39;s a tough order and the recommendation was perfect.

  Drink at the bar.  I asked for a slightly dirty martini, it was very dirty...fine - I gave it a 
pass.

 bread basket was filled with cold bread.   the butter used to come garnished, not the case any more.  

I was interested in the Elk tenderloin...I recently had some at another restaurant and it was like veal...it was amazing - so I had some high hopes.   I asked the waitress whether I should get the seabass or the elk and she recommended the elk - having never even tried it (of course, the elk was the most expensive thing on the menu $42, so why wouldn&#39;t she recommend it.)  I told her of my experience in the other restaurant and she said &#34;oh yes, just like veal&#34; again, having never tasted it herself.

The elk was brought out rare - extremely rare.    it should have been more medium rare.  it was incredibly chewy and not well seasoned.  I told her to take it back and cook it a bit more.  She did and it did not help.  I had one more bite and was not happy.  The veg and polenta cake on the plate were dry and not very appetizing.    She offered to bring me something else, but  at this point my husband was already done with his dish.  

She offered nothing else to remedy my disappointment.    It seems every time I have gone here this past year, there is always something &#39;off&#39;.  We have been going here because of great service and food - but now it seems that both are just not there anymore.    

This dinner for two was $155....what a waste...will not be going back"

Even if you don&#39;t, come anyway! Great for a romantic dinner or double date. Delicious seasonal, fresh ingredients cooked by an incredible chef and staff. Great starters (we LOVED the Fried Green Tomatoes and Charcuterie Platter). A great and extensive wine &amp; cocktail list. Our entrees were the filet (a HUGE and VERY tender one) with asparagus and gruyere mashed potatoes, and the monkfish ossobuco. Dessert is, literally and figuratively, icing on the cake. Seasonal changes in the menu keep it fresh and exiting every time!"

The atmosphere was cozy and festive. After we ordered we received a bread basket with different types of bread along with a tasty amuse bouche.

I had trouble deciding between the elk and the duck, but I went with the duck for my entree. It was served with an asparagus risotto and was really good. My honey had the salmon, which was tasty and moist.

We had the peppermint creme brulee for dessert, which I was skeptical about but it was great! Not overly minty. We were also treated to bite size cakes after dessert along with the bill."

I got the service with the tea, which was good but water got cold fast and wasnt refilled, the quiche which tasted great, the tea sandwiches which came with 3 but if you want more i think theyll bring you more, scones and mini desserts which were also good.  The scones came with Devon cream, lemon curd and jam which i wasnt crazy about.  I have tasted better.  After all that they bring out a chocolate molten cake which was excellent.  It was a nice place im not sure i will be back."

It was my lady&#39;s birthday and we had a very nice dinner here. The ambiance is very romantic, quiet, tables are far apart for privacy but not too much so. The service is fantastic, very knowledgeable and attentive, friendly but not in an obtrusive way. I wish we could give half stars as I&#39;d give this 4.5 and not a full 5 because our food was very good but not great. We had the mussels as an app and they were a little rubbery and then we both had salmon which again was good but not the best I&#39;ve ever had.  The prices were what you&#39;d expect for a place of this caliber a little high but all the extras here make it worth it for a special occasion. Also should mention that they have a great wine list by the bottle but not so much by the glass."

I was pretty excited we had landed a great table without a reservation and could look out over the water.  We got to look out quite a bit as the service, while affable, was very slow and spotty.  

I was still hanging in there but the lunch was just average food, very average.  I have even waited to write this review because sometimes memories improve with a few week&#39;s wait.

Nope, it was just average.  But great view!"

What pulled it up was the drink menu which is not the way you want to get to 4 stars in my opinion.

Be very careful in reading the menu for entrees and be as discerning as possible.  The items are imaginative but fall short on execution.  I went for the pork chop and found it lackluster.

We ate a Niche (about .3 miles away) the night before and Niche wins on every count.

NOW:  We ate at this restaurant on Friday, 4/27.  The woman who was there shouting it seemed at the top of her lungs about the estate and who should get what--nobody cares!  Inside voice!  As you left, at least some people turned to see exactly who you were so they could make sure never to run into you again.  Get it?"

The food and service were great and the prices reasonable. Tonight we went there for our anniversary and unfortunately they were still having their specials for Chicago Restaurant week. I chose the fixed price tasting meal but my wife ordered the Atwater&#39;s salad and the Oxtail entre&#39;. My first course was the crab Bengneit. It was lukewarm on the inside. Otherwise it tasted good but our waitress didn&#39;t know if it was supposed to be colder or warmer. My wife&#39;s Atwater&#39;s salad was miniscule, and smaller than the table next to us that had gotten the salad from the tasting menu. The oxtail entre&#39; that my wife ordered had less oxtail than the one that I had ordered from the tasting menu. We left without finishing and my wife went out for fast food.
The food proparers confused their tasting menu with the regular menu and execution was poor. Wait staff was great but it was a very sad experience."

but, we actually only went to the bar outside of the restaurant, in the hotel lobby.

BUT, it was awesome.  Our drinks were excellent, and appropriately priced.  The service staff had great attitudes and were attentive to the many customers (they all came in at the same time just before dinner reservations).  The seating is lovely: some around the bar (comfy and high), and several seating sections that make you feel like you are in your living room (cozy corners with couches and a fire-side table for a pre-meal drink).  Perfection.

Excellent place and I can&#39;t come back for a real meal!  This time, our late reservation was in the area, so we just stopped by for drinks before our meal-elsewhere. 

The bf, upon leaving said, &#34;I sure hope that we get invited to a wedding at that place.  The banquet rooms are awesome!&#34;  So-- if that&#39;s saying something, this place is beautiful."

Citrus glazed pork chops over roasted vegetables were divine, as was the tomato bisque soup! Would have liked the beet carpaccio salad to be a little more savory. Spouse devoured roasted pheasant, which was both flavorful and juicy. Impressive and extensive wine list. Named 2013 Winner of Wine Spectator for most impressive wine list! Enjoyed a lovely bottle of a Shiraz Blend by Two Hands. Minus 1 star for the spider web on chandeliers and chair cushions, although comfortable with larger size and armrests, could use a stuffing refresh."

The location along the river and atmosphere makes a wonderful spot for a quite lunch or dinner.  Unfortunately the day we dined the room was quite chilly and uncomfortable.  

Food
We opted for the pre-fixed menu that included a starter, entrée and dessert and we both ordered the same items.  I started with the endive salad with roasted tomatoes and brie cheese.  The presentation was nice and the flavors worked well together.  I would have liked a little more substance to the salad.  For the entrée I had the braised short ribs, with polenta and assorted vegetables.  I was expected to be wowed by the entrée but it fell short of my expectations.  The short ribs were tender but I thought both the short ribs and polenta needed a bit more flavor.  The vegetables were cooked el dente.  I&#39;m not a big eater but the portion size on the entrée was even too small for me.  All the food needed to be hotter but this may have been due to the room being to cool that the food suffered.  The dessert was a flourless chocolate mousse cake that was delicious and the highlight of the meal.  

Service
I expect a 4 diamond restaurant to really come through on the service.  Our service was below par.  A waiter should talk up the menu, tell you about the specials or recommend an item not just come to the table and ask if we have any questions.  Our water glasses sat empty until dessert arrived.  The pacing of the meal was too slow.  A diner shouldn&#39;t be waiting more than 15 minutes for dessert to be served.  Since I can&#39;t give 2 /12 stars I&#39;m giving 3."

I have been going to Atwaters for years, primarily for breakfast meetings, and have always had a great experience. I&#39;d estimate I&#39;ve eaten there 40 or more times, and I choose it because the food is always good and the service is always exceptional. I found that my guests were always impressed by the atmosphere (linen tablecloths, polite wait staff, no horrendous music booming from above), and the quality of the food. The prices are reasonable considering the setting, and the wait staff are there when you need them, not constantly pestering or trying to be your pal."

My filet was bad. Overcooked and the cut of meat just wasn&#39;t very good.  Everyone was really underwhelmed with their meal.  Dessert was also just so-so... could tell everything came out of a freezer.  But I love the quiet, mature, well-spaced, comfy atmosphere. And our waiter was very good."

Oh well, I&#39;ll chance it...

Went here for the 4th or 5th time last night, and this was by far our best meal there. I had the Elk Rack and it was unbelievable. Everyone at the table got a taste and all of them, even the &#34;is it gamy?&#34; crowd, LOVED IT!

The seasonal squash soup was our main driver for returning, and it didn&#39;t disappoint. The fireplace was raging, the wine was fantastic, couldn&#39;t have had a better night.

Reservations are a must, this place has fewer than 20 tables. They are in the Herrington Hotel, so make it a weekend and book your room, too.

It&#39;s a bit expensive, but much less expensive than Fahrenheit -- and the portions are perfect.

Highly recommended. They can handle bigger parties, business functions, etc., too. If you are coming out to the &#39;burbs, check it out."

For our anniversary, my husband and I usually spend the weekend at the Herrington Inn &amp; Spas, which I reviewed seperately, a couple years ago. We&#39;ve always gone out to dinner while we were there, but we never went to the restaurant in the hotel, I think precisely because I thought of it as just that, until this past weekend. 

With the way that things have been recently, we needed to relax and didn&#39;t want to do too much unnecessary walking around, so I made reservations at Atwater&#39;s, and I&#39;m so glad I did. I took the advice of another reviewer and told them that we were going there to celebrate our anniversary...and when we sat down at our table, there was a handwritten note from the hostess, which was also signed by all of the staff that were working that evening. A perfect touch to the beginning of a wonderful night.

We decided to go all out because of the occasion...we had appetizers (me, crab cakes topped with brie cheese and pears, him, beef carpaccio), soups and salads (me, house specialty that evening, cream of chicken rice, and him, caesar salad, as always), entrees (me, salmon atop asparagus ravioli in a white truffle sauce (yum!), and he had the crab topped filet) and we also shared a dessert (the bread pudding)...on top of that, the chef offered a salmon amuse bouche and a sample of their chilled chocolate mousse at the end of dinner.

It was truly lovely and everything was delicious. We spent two hours eating our meals and enjoying our conversation that did not have to do with napping, spitup or diapers. It was a wonderful experience and we are looking forward to going back next year!

On a side note, when we spend longer weekends in geneva (we only spent one night this year) we decided that we will dine at Atwater&#39;s one night and at another restaurant the next night, but we will always go back to Atwater&#39;s...between the personalized experience, the caring waiters/staff, and the delicious food, it&#39;s certainly something not to miss!"

Once we ordered, the food came out in a timely manner and arrived hot as one would expect. The only thing holding me back from giving it a full 5 stars is that i have been to other upscale restaurants both in the city and suburbs with a more unique and creative menu for about the same price. Be careful asking for well done on any beef, make sure you mean it - it will be WELL done.

We went to Atwaters for an after graduation lunch.  We had a large party of nine and made reservations a week prior.  It also happened to be Mother&#39;s Day weekend, so you would think they would have beefed up their staff.  Not so.  And the one older gentleman who seemed to be the only waiter was clearly overwhelmed.  
We were seated right away, but waited no less than 15 minutes just to place a drink order!  The rest of the meal was ok, but just took forever.  The &#34;icing on the cake&#34; was that we brought our own specially decorated cake to celebrate the graduation.  My husband gave it to the staff which informed us that there would be a 2.00 per person fee to slice and serve the cake.  I was expecting that they would at least bring the cake out so our graduate could see it before it was sliced- is that expecting too much?  Apparently. They sliced it without even asking if we were ready of if we wanted to present it.   The manager was told what happened and tried to make up for it by comping our champagne.  That was nice, but really put a damper on the whole affair.  
Will never return or recommend."

The service was great, the food was amazing, as was our wine choice. Yes, it&#39;s a bit pricey ($194 before tip which included $75 for wine, and $20 for 2 glasses of port), more for a special occasion, but well worth it.

It started with the bread, which was a basket of old rolls that you expect in a greasy spoon diner - inedible.  A bad sign at a high end restaurant.  Then came the food. My wife&#39;s was not bad (though no way up to $50 for appetizer + entree, no drinks). My food was literally inedible. Squash soup - their signature - was as sweet as desert topping. Two spoonfuls was enough for me. Then I got the chicken breast. It was so dry and overcooked that I could barely cut it, much less eat it. I tried sucking on it to see if it was at least tasty.  No luck. Bland as can be.  I waited for the waitress to stop by and take it away, but by the time I got her attention my wife was nearly done with her meal, so I passed on another entree. It least they didn&#39;t charge me, but I left the restaurant hungry (made a sandwich at home).  With one glass of wine each the bill still ran a hundred bucks!  Fortunately we were in a good enough mood that we didn&#39;t let it ruin our evening."

So many pictures of large fish pulled from the water and large stuffed fish hanging on the walls. Oh and you will not miss the large salt water tank while you eat.

Moreover the food and service was nothing above 3 stars.  Our waitress was checked out and went through the motions. To eat I had a side salad with fried fish.  My colleague had 2 fish tacos, he wondered why it didn&#39;t come with 3."

First, the bread they brought to the table was stale and half was cold while the other half was mushy. We ordered the pretzel appetizer and they tasted like freezer burn. The $10 burger also had a stale bun and the quality of the meat was very poor. 

The green beans they served were cold on the inside, and it seemed like those were frozen and not fresh. The steak was a cheap sirloin so we were not expecting something amazing but it honestly looked and tasted like burnt rubber even when ordered medium-rare. 

We would not eat here again; there are too many good restaurants close by to waste the money on a subpar meal here."

Food was usually around 3.5 stars - not spectacular, not awful. Services was always hit or miss.

On my last visit, first thing I noticed was the menu change - it was significantly slimmed down. Coconut shrimp was one of my stand-by entree choice and it was no longer on their menu. Instead, they paired it with a coconut fish on as a daily special for $25. The food was okay, but not on par for the price I paid.

It was Halloween Monday night at 6:30pm and there were not many patrons, maybe around 4 other tables. Service was really slow throughout our entire meal. They sat us in a booth opposite wall of the fish tank and they kept vacuuming and cleaning our immediate area. 

The final blow to the mediocre night - they threw our leftovers away. We realized we left it on the table as soon as got to our car. We ran back in, not 5 minutes after we left the table, and the table was cleared off and our leftovers discarded. Most restaurants I&#39;ve been to would at least try to chase you down when you&#39;ve left something behind. They hardly cleared our table while we were dining, but yet, they were so quick to clear off the table after we left.

Bottom line: Just don&#39;t bother"

It is nice to sit at the bar and watch the enormous fishtank, and I love Bass Pro Shops.

The bun was stale and presentation poor. The grilled grouper sandwich was certainly NOT grilled on premise and I&#39;m very suspect that it was even grouper. They charge $17.00 for this P.O.S. and the portion barely covered  1/2 of the bun. RIP OFF! It was tasteless, overcooked and over spiced. If you would prefer something besides their nasty fries, you can get a side salad for a $2.00 up-charge. Then you will be disappointed that the salad has about three leaves of lettuce and not much else. Another rip off.

Service: Service was well below average. These folks need lessons in common courtesy and what not to do when you&#39;re around customers. Getting a drink refill takes forever, and if you complain about the food the server (Jonathan) will just say &#34;excellent&#34; and then walk away like he doesn&#39;t give a damn. 

The server cash out station was right behind our table. We witnessed Jonathan and a few other servers talking shit about the customers, discussing their personal lives and being generally rude. One server (morbidly obese female--didn&#39;t get her name) was in on the trash talk. When she wasn&#39;t talking shit about the customers, she was snorting, sniffling and coughing throughout the entire restaurant. IF YOU&#39;RE SICK, KEEP YOUR NASTY ASS AT HOME!!!!!!!

Prices: The prices are high compared with other options in the area. The value is PISS POOR when you consider the low quality and minuscule portions.

I took a good look around because I will never see the inside of this dump again. I may not even bother to shop at Bass Pro Shops. It was such a negative experience."

However, over the past few months, the quality has fallen way off. Our most recent visit, today, will be the last for a long time.
Last year, they overhauled their rather large menu, eliminating feta cheese from their salads and subbing in blue cheese (which the husband hates) and steak from the kids&#39; menu (my sons&#39; favorite option and a rarity at most restaurants anyway). We continued to go out of our way to stop in, because the waiters were friendly and remembered us, and for the delicious complimentary fresh bread and homemade ranch. On our last visit, about a month ago, they had switched out the fresh bread for a store bought imitation that they popped in the oven to warm up for a few minutes, and when my grilled chicken came on top of my salad, it was very undercooked and pink. The waiter ended up removing the salad from our bill, which was a nice gesture.
When we visited today, the girls in the front ignored us for 2 minutes while they spoke about some of the waiters (it wasn&#39;t busy), and our food took a long time to come out considering how slow it was in the restaurant. The same disappointing bread was served, and the final nail in the coffin - the ranch is gone. They&#39;re now using Kraft or something similar.

Went here for the first time tonight. Decor was awesome, who doesn&#39;t love a massive fish tank behind the bar? Seated in a booth that was designed for people with an eating disorder, my back was firmly sandwiched between the back of the seat and the edge of the table....I was not the only one who noticed this and no its not just because I am a big guy, I go out and am never without space like this....the booths seriously need more room. 
Service is deathly slow, they must have been sun brewing the tea that was ordered as it took forever just for water and an iced tea.

I perused the menu and 3 of the 4 of us dining settled on the fish and chips.

Decided to try some mixed drinks as the tone of the bar lent itself to the Florida Keys and its cold outside so I was wanting something tropical.

First off I went with the Coronarita. I have had several of these before and have never been displeased so I felt this was a good place to start.......My god.....a pint glass filled with the some sort of tequila brine topped with a baby corona. My first drink and I almost spit it back out.......the only way to ejoy this drink was to get the alcohol into your system as quickly as you could so I slammed it and almost puked on the table. Im not kidding, Im not being unfair, this was THE WORST EXCUSE for a Coronrita I have ever seen.

Just as I finished force-feeding the salt, beer and tequila concoction the calamari appetizer arrived. Visually it was unappealing and thats when we all kind of got the feeling we were not in for any type of treat with this meal but we didn&#39;t want to jinx it so we began trying to enjoy the appetizer. It was frozen like everything else billed as seafood on the menu. Not only was it frozen but it was also way overcooked.

When that was finished we had some more bread which I must say is the tastiest thing I was served the entire meal. During this time I looked over the &#34;specialty&#34; drink menu and saw a drink called a &#34;Brain Eraser&#34;??? Something like that....it is described basically as black rum and all the ingredients for a Pina Colada on the rocks and not blended......I ordered 3, 1 for me, my date and my friend who has worked chain food restaurants and knows a thing or two about how food and drinks are prepared. 

My date took a drink and made a displeasing face....I took a drink and nearly choked as what hit my tastebuds was absolutely disgusting. I took one drink and waited for my main course as it was too nasty to drink by itself.


The main course arrives.....finally....there was at least a 5-15 min wait on drinks and orders each time.....VERY SLOW SERVICE.

Any way, fish and chips arrive and my friend requests an extra tartar sauce and thats when I realize my plate as well as my dates plate is void of any tartar sauce. So we ask for extra as well as balsamic vinegar.

I broke open my fish to let it cool and took a bite. It was very greasy and not very flavorful at all. Its not the worst thing I have ever tasted but I would not serve this to anybody I wanted to keep a friendly rapport with. At this point I realized I couldn&#39;t earth this frozen deep fried mess of a fish stick without it being drowned in tartar sauce. So after the customary 10min avg wait for anything requested, out comes the tartar sauce offering and balsamic vinegar.

A warning regarding the tartar sauce....it IS NOT TARTAR SAUCE, what they are advertising as tartar sauce is actually cream and dill mixed together which is also void of any type of flavor that would pair well with even good fresh fish. I have had some dill sauces that were great, this was literally a cream base that had no flavor with dill added to it.

I began dunking the fish in the dill liquid and ate it....the whole time displaying the same type of facial expression as one would waking up in Bill Cosby&#39;s bed and realizing why they had no clothes on. I was completely disgusted.
In order to finish the rum drink I literally pinched my nose and slammed it and nearly vomited again.

Why not talk to the manager? Because this isn&#39;t about my bad experience this is about stopping this restaurant from being able to take advantage of people by overcharging for disgusting frozen food and horrible service. Besides I doubt the manager has the ability to change the menu overnight and authorize the purchase of fresh fish.

The Food - NOT GOOD
The Ambiance/Decore - Inviting and nice

When you walk in it&#39;s very spacious, and tons of cute large fish on the walls. Dead center they have a salt water tank that&#39;s is entertaining to watch as you wait for your food to come. My only compliant with that is the need to clean it, it&#39;s looking pretty foggy, either the water or tank itself I&#39;m not sure. Our server was very polite and nice, checked on us often, but not often enough to get a fork in the eye. (I hate when they come back every 5 mins drives me crazy, he was good though came every time out glasses got empty, and a few mins after we started eating) we got the venison stuffed mushrooms with a lobster sauce it was a nice flavor, I understood what they were going for but the venison was way to dry, and lacked seasoning, the cheese choice they paired it with didn&#39;t make sense, it was a mozzarella. You need a cheese to take away some of the gamines of the venison, usually blue cheese or goat cheese would be perfect but not in this setting, so I would of gone with an asiago melted cheese and added a little bit of truffle oil to the lobster sauce to really pull it all together. The mozzarella made it overly greasy which made it unattractive and gave it a kinda bland taste to the already under seasoned venison. (These are just picky chef critiques, all in all they were a good idea) I think it would be a good idea to add a little crunch to this too, maybe add a little bread crumb on top toasted would of been nice. Moving on I got the fish tacos, which were AMAZING, no constructive criticism there  they were absolutely perfect, the fish was juicy and flavorful and I loved that they added tangerines too it was a great addition, they didn&#39;t over power it with too much cilantro which is great. Loved these and they give you two dipping sauces, a crazy spicy creamy one which was too much for me and a nice mango salsa which was perfect! My boyfriend got the shrimp and scallop pasta. I tried the sauce it was pretty tasty and full bodied, just slightly under seasoned. But the scallops.... Do NOT get this dish if u like scallops they are quarter of the size of scallops should be, no joke I looked at his plate and I&#39;m like &#34;why would they quarter the scallops before serving&#34; and looked closer and seen those were them while! I&#39;ve never seen a scallop so small. He said they tasted good but could of had more haha. Ya no kidding. Personally I would of sent it back, you don&#39;t pay for scallops to get that. But that&#39;s me. It would of been one thing if we were at an Applebee&#39;s or something but this is a seafood place, come on. Anyway other than that just know what to order, ask questions and everything is fine! Lol they serve you and awesome bread in the beginning that&#39;s soooo good! I love when places serve bread haha, it was sweet and salty perfect combo duh! I honestly would come back here and recommend it. They had a wine list and bar too but we didn&#39;t drink this time. The chef also came out to our table which is always nice. It was a pleasant visit."

Pleasant atmosphere and well-planned interior impressed me because there are not so many restaurants with good interior in Bolingbrook area. I liked everything: food is fresh and tasty, waitresses are polite, drinks are good and their aquarium looks cool, especially in the evening, when it gets dark.

I always wanted to come here and I was excited to try their food. We ordered two appetizers, calamari and alligator. Those were delicious but when it came to dinner it was not so much, I ordered the Island grilled Mahi and my fiancé the blackened Mahi. Both of our fish was dry and my fiancé&#39;s fish wasn&#39;t even blackened. I don&#39;t think the fish was fresh but was more like frozen. I am very disappointed and I won&#39;t be returning.

I do think that it is a pretty decent place for lunch. This last time I had the Cobb salad with salmon. I&#39;d say the salmon was slightly overdone but overall it wasn&#39;t bad and the salad was a typical Cobb. The blue cheese dressing was better than average.

Here are the pros and cons:

Pro: 
Decent seafood at a decent price. Bayou platter was especially awesome: catfish etouffee and crawfish tails. 
Pretty awesome interior of the restaurant - huge fish tank and weird fake fish all over the walls. Like albacore tuna! 
Amazing bread that is brought out to your table. Omg, bread is so good.

Cons:
Hostesses were kind of crappy. They just stared at us when we walked up to the hostess desk. No &#34;hello&#34;, no smiles, just blank faces for an awkward 10 seconds before they&#39;re like &#34;table for three?&#34; 

No. Table for four, beeyotch. 

Then they told us we had to wait for 25 minutes. We waited for at least 40 and they didn&#39;t seem to care, even when we were like the only people waiting around for about 10 minutes. Idk, I just got a really crappy vibe from them, a vibe that could only be offset by a real lionfish!

Other cons: They sat us in a table directly next to the server station where they input all the food orders. It kind of felt like a second dis after the hostess snub. 

That&#39;s about it...I guess I just kind of felt treated like a 2nd class citizen by those hostesses. 

Okay, maybe my Star Trek tshirt wasn&#39;t &#34;cool&#34;, and maybe my boo&#39;s tshirt had &#34;holes in the armpits&#34;...but he didn&#39;t lift his arms the whole time we were there, so there&#39;s no way you could actually see the holes in his armpits. Don&#39;t treat us differently! Our money is still good and nobody puts me in the corner. Or next to the server station."

Today I ordered a small shrimp appetizer, fried tilapia fish tacos and a kids steak for my daughter.

We sat in the bar area so my daughter could look at the fish tank. I didn&#39;t realize that the tables me  to us are also used to sort the dirty dishes. WTH, there&#39;s no room in the back out of the customers view? Last thing I want to hear is dishes banging around and he staff laughing it up by the bar. 

The shrimp appetizer was a joke. Like $7.00 for five cold shrimp and a puddle of cocktail sauce with a filthy lemon half? Seriously, 5 shrimp laid spread out one the plate with a puddle of sauce next to it. Terrible presentation.

 After thirty minutes the meal came. The fish tacos left a lot to be desired. The fish itself was pretty good, but the taco complete was again a joke. Store bought shredded cheese and canned orange slices does not make a salsa. The tortilla was even a joke. I get it, some things are not doable in the restaurant world, but 4 whole orange slices laid on top of the tacos and a rotting lime to boot.

My daughters steak and fries was pretty good, better than my tacos and hers was from the kids menu.

Sorry but this experience has left a bad taste in my mouth. The quality is gone and so am I.

The inside of the restaurant is pretty cool though. Nice to see but don&#39;t expect a great dining experience."

Do you like your beer/drinks served now or approximately 15 minutes later?  Do you especially like to wait even longer when you have a child with you for dinner?  

The fish tank is amazing!  We were seated right away on a Saturday night.  After that the rest of the experience was unremarkable.  My fiancee ordered a drink and they brought him a margarita instead because they were out of the other drink mix.  He didn&#39;t like it and got something else...all of this was time consuming.  Our friend ordered a beer.  The server forgot and it took 15 minutes to get it.  

The bread was extra crusty, stale and tasted like plain white bread.  Our friends who had dined there previously and loved it knew that this was not typical.  They asked for another loaf of bread which came to the table warm and delicious!

They do not have any vegetarian dinner entrees.  I had the Islamorada salad which looked good, but the mixed greens weren&#39;t crispy and the feta was really bland.  Our friend ordered a steak which came out considerably more well done than requested.

If the food was served promptly we honestly wouldn&#39;t have complained about it because it really was fine (just fine, not good).  But after waiting for nearly 40 minutes for dinner, you really expect a good meal!  The food (chicken, ribs, etc) does appear to be precooked and then reheated when ordered...so not sure what the deal was with the long delay."

Thought it may have been a one-time mistake by the cook.

Called the owner  he was very rude and didn&#39;t care I said you are going to lose a customer he said so what and hung up. This restaurant belongs on Hell&#39;s Kitchen .

It was a seasonal Sam Adams Summer Ale that was likely just tapped since it is Spring, so it is unacceptable that the beer is bad. It might be the beer system, who knows. The Alligator bites appetizer was not very good. The sauce that was drizzled on it was a jalapeño sweet sauce that is mint green and not appetizing to look at (plus it was served in a little disposable plastic cup, which can be seen in my picture....classy). The sauce did not compliment the meat at all. As for the meat, it was fried well and the breading was nice. Some bites were good, but others had gristle in them. One bite was almost all gristle. I informed the waiter and they were quick to offer me a new plate to which I declined. They took the charge off my bill without question, which was appreciated. Overall this was not a very good experience at all. Save your money and go elsewhere...."

The fish tank does live up to the hype and is the center piece in this restaraunt. Very tall ceilings and it is open with a bar against the fish tank.

It is not a place that I would go out of my way to go to again but the food, drinks and environment was great and I would recommend a try. 

Not many beers on tap but they have pina colata&#39;s and other beach going drinks to fit the scene which makes you feel like you are at the beach.

I had the alligator meal and actually asked them to custimize it and just grill the meat instead of breading it. They did! Gator is much better without the breading and it had a nice canjun spice to it. Not a huge portion but it came with fries and was $15.95. I think I proved that they don&#39;t buy it in frozen bags though. This is great!

Service was good overall and our bill for 4 was about $100. There were some up charges of $1.50 for trading out a side salad and we had a variety of things from burgers, pasta to the tradiotonal mahi sandwhich.  Nobody raved but no one complained. 

Try it out and be sure to check out Bass Pro connected even if you aren&#39;t an outdoors person like I am. It has a waterfall and more fish tanks."

Tilapia was great...grilled tilapia tasted better than fried...get the grilled...

Atmosphere was surprisingly older....they have a decent bar but its not the kind of bar a fasted paced 27 to 32 yr old would be caught at....this is more late 30s 40 something couple with kids kind of joint....sunday dinner with your in-laws kind of situation....

Nice HUGE fish tank but i didnt feel comfortable staring at swimming fish when a dead fish was on my plate...i felt horrible....its a bad idea to have live fish swimming around when ppl are eating fish...its evil...can you stare at a live dog with dog steak on your plate?....no you cant...

I ordered tilapia to go and 1 weird observation...the paper lining in my to-go box said BASS PRO SHOPS......meaning the same guy selling me cooked seafood is the same guy selling me fish hooks and worms...

I thought this was a strictly sea food operation...

the fish tank with the fish on your plate combo is weird.

Bass pro selling cooked fish is weird...

They serve us some nice fluffy white bread that has some sugar on top and so it&#39;s a sweet bread. We always order a bowl of hot creamy hearty clam chowder soup, and we try to go for something differerent every time we order.

This week we tried the soft shell crab sandwhich and I had their appetizer platter and we enjoyed it. I had the appetizer platter with onion rings, breed batter fried clam stripes, spinach artichoke dip with flatbread and a quarter of ribs. I had more than enough to eat and the food was very yummy.

what we like about this place is that it has a giant acquarium to look at while you&#39;re waiting for your food and the fish are fun to watch. I would recommend this place if you like seafood and a nice date night or family dinner."

The venue itself is pretty amazing in terms of decor.  I give this place credit for their exterior, interior and of course, the gigantic fish tank.  I dined here for Halloween with a group of friends.  They gave us a private room, the &#34;Hemmingway&#34; I believe, in the back so this place can accommodate large groups. 

The food itself wasn&#39;t anything amazing to me although they sure had an adventurist kind of menu that includes alligator and venison meat.  They also have a large variety of seafood offerings too.  This place is a bit more upscale and the food quality seems alright.  Though that a lot of the dishes came out with a bit more oil and fried than I would like .  

Honestly, I can&#39;t say that I had an amazing food experience because the food must have been decent but it wasn&#39;t memorable.  However,  we did have an amazing customer service experience.  One of our friends ordered a steak and it came out way overcooked from how he had asked for it to be done and when we told the hostess, a manager came straight to party to apologized, ordered him a new steak and gave all of us one complimentary desert.  The deserts were quite good. 

So my overall reaction to this restaurant is that it&#39;s a place I would definitely give another try someday.  I&#39;m giving it 3 stars for now because the food was alright but should it be amazing the next time I visit, it will definitely be upgraded to 4 stars."

I don&#39;t have much use for Bass Pro.  I camp once or twice a year, but can&#39;t say I need a gun, bow, arrow, turkey deep fryer, or anything else like that.

But we don&#39;t come to this location for the boats, pontoons, or machine guns.  We come for the restaurant atmosphere and the fish!

We&#39;ve been here at least 5 times now.  There are always reasonable drink prices, and there&#39;s not much more relaxing than sitting at the bar on a snowy day, watching the tropical fish, as the flakes fall gently (or violently) outside the windows.

Food is always adequate, and, sometimes, really good.  The Bayou Platter with Etoufee and Fried Crawfish is delicious, sandwiches are usually good, and so on.  Occasionally we have had dishes that lacked seasoning or salt, but usually the atmosphere makes up for it.

I know it sounds silly.  A relaxing dinner at the Bass Pro?  But seriously, go and just enjoy the fish and let all the worries melt away."

I went tonight and had a fantastic and economical meal.  I love that everything doesn&#39;t come fried (unless you want it to). Most times when I see fried seafood on a menu I ask &#34;Can I have it grilled?&#34;. When they say no it means that the food is not fresh and was breaded then frozen before it arrived at the restaurant. 

The service was good and the GM came out unsolicited and asked how my meal was. I can count on one hand how many times that&#39;s happened in my restaurant experiences. When I asked her what was in a sauce, she listed ingredients and the preparation. This is rare, very rare. 

Honestly..the fish is fresh and well prepared. I read that the calamari is bad here. Don&#39;t get the calamari, get something you can&#39;t get at every other restaurant. The venison stuffed mushrooms were very tasty.

I know some will roll their eyes about eating in a Bass Pro Shops, which by the way, isn&#39;t exactly a bait and tackle shack, but get over it!  We went for a late lunch on a Saturday and the one strange thing was that they don&#39;t serve baked potatoes until 4 p.m.-maybe the recipe isn&#39;t visible until then!

I had the Angler, which is a small crab cake, 5 grilled shrimp on a skewer, and a grilled mahi filet.  All were very good-the mahi in particular.  The sides were decent and the side salad to start was good as well.  Kids meals appeared decent.

Overall this is a good place for fish/seafood in an area that is lacking and the restaurant is well run, clean and a pretty good value as well."

I always liked Bass Pro Shop in general after all I do come from a family of hunters and fishers. 

I walked in to meet them at the table they already had and I was NICELY surprised. I just LOVED the HUGE beautiful salt water fish tank they have in there. You can sit at the cool bar area and just watch the fish. :) 

Nice seating area with options for a table or a booth. We had a table near the fireplace. I thought it was odd to have it on since it was 85 outside BUT you could not feel the heat so all was good. :) 

I decided to try the Lemon/Pepper Tilapia with extra veggies instead of the wild rice it comes with. NO CARBS for me! :) 

My dad had the fish and chips but he was not 100% happy with it. Boooo. 

My mom being my silly mom had a cheeseburger with white cheddar. She liked it but they cooked it wrong. She does not like to send items back but I ALWAYS say you are paying for it so you need to get what you ordered. 

I like the outside seating area as well. Perfect for the not so hot afternoons or evenings. 

I will defiantly go back.

Food was not exciting.  Appetizer mussels were over cooked.  Kids meal pizzas were tomato sauce and mozzarella on bisquick.  Absolutely terrible.  Étouffée was adequate.  Mahi tacos were the one stand out.  These were excellent.

As in the past, the decor impressed and helped pass the time waiting for a table. (The kids love watching the large saltwater fish tank) It was very busy as many families were out to see Santa. Our wait was about 40 minutes after being told 20-30 minutes. Not bad for the crowds.

The food unfortunately did not impress us. It is disappointing because I want to like this place, because the service and atmosphere is enjoyable. I tried the world famous fish sandwich and was disappointed with its tastelessness. My wife tried the grilled shrimp (teriyaki and cajun) Although the teriyaki sauce was not what was expected we both enjoyed it. The cajun (or blackened, not sure) was so spicy they were almost inedible. The kids meals were typical &#34;kids meals&#34; any restaurant would offer. I can&#39;t say the food was terrible, but just okay making us choose other placing in that area in the future for the cost.

I would go with a 2 1/2 if possible. Overall more of a one-time place to add to the experience when traveling to shop at Bass Pro."

I was definitely not expecting a place of this caliber to be attached to an outdoors shop... even if it is the Disneyland of outdoors shops. We were here because a friend was selling girl scout cookies outside, but we missed them, so we ended up just wandering around inside the store with our three year old. After venturing into the restaurant to look at the salt water fish tank (after having already looked at the fresh water display in the store), we liked the look of the place so we decided to have a late lunch / early dinner. This was about 4:30 on a Sunday afternoon and tables were plentiful. The service was also very attentive.

We started with the shrimp flatbread appetizer. Olive oil, shrimp, cheese, and tons of minced garlic. If you love garlic, like we do, you MUST try this appetizer. If you are not a fan of garlic, steer clear, because this thing is literally overflowing with toasted bits of garlicky goodness.

For dinner my wife ordered the Islamorada Portofino (blackened tilapia with shrimp on rice with a lobster cream sauce), I had the Seared Shrimp and Scallops (with mushrooms, peppers, angel hair pasta, and a white cream sauce), and our daughter had the mac n&#39; cheese (your basic Kraft dinner).

Everything was fabulous, the scallops were among the best I&#39;ve ever had. Seared crisp on the outside, tender and sweet on the inside. 

For desert we opted for the ice cream cookie sandwich from the kid&#39;s menu for our daughter, and the bread pudding to split for us. The ice cream sandwich was huge, adult-sized, but very tasty and our daughter loved it. The bread pudding was almost perfect... bread without any currants, raisins, or other nasty surprises, topped with ice cream, whipped cream, and I think a caramel sauce. The only thing keeping this from being the best bread pudding ever is the fact that Opah in Orange County has a bread pudding made of chocolate croissants.

We were definitely impressed with this place, and not just because we had low expectations going in. We will definitely be going back."

Went here with the fam since we had gotten coupons for free kids meal with adult entrees. Never going back! Service was slow. Food took so long to come out that the kids started to get antsy. Btw, they had kids menu/coloring paper but no crayons! According to the waitress, they were all out. How can a place giving away coupons for free kids meal not have crayons and make children wait so long for their food?! It finally comes and not so good. I got the fish and chips. They&#39;re ok but the fries had a texture of being microwaved. My husband said my fish tasted like something from Long John Silver. The fish also have the same affect afterwards as fish from long john silvers. They cost way more though! His grilled fish was so so and he didn&#39;t even eat the potatoes that came with it. The kids pizza, gross! Tasted like cardboard with tomato paste smeared on it. The carrots and celery that came with it looked really old. I couldn&#39;t believe they actually put it on a plate and thought it was ok. I felt bad that the kids are it. There are plenty of other restaurants in the area, go somewhere else!"

First we had a long wait for a table, so we walked around for over half an hour. Ok, I get it,it&#39;s Christmas time &amp; it was a Saturday.
Our waiter came up to us quickly. Took our orders right away &amp; left to get our drinks. He came right back with them. Passed out four of the five &amp; then proceeded to drop the last drink on the poor gentleman seated next to us!! He  kind of apologized &amp; got towels quickly. Clearly embarrassed. 
Our food came out shortly thereafter. The food was fine. Nothing special.
Anyhoo, this review is mostly based on the spilled drink.
A manager came over to the guy more than fifteen minutes after it happened. She cleaned up the ice on the floor, kind of said she was sorry &amp; walked away. Our waiter came back to us once. We had to ask for refills &amp; left the check. I&#39;m sure he was embarrassed, but still!! 
I can not get over the fact that this family had to pay for their meal! We were shocked when they paid a check!! The manager should have taken care of it or at the very least apologized &amp; asked if they were ok. This man left the restaurant in wet jeans!!
Because of this, I don&#39;t think we&#39;d go back. And I hope that family doesn&#39;t either. Terrible customer service if you ask me, if this is the way they treat a man they soaked!"

For what I was looking for, it was a bit pricey, but it hit the spot. $15 for a hearty grilled  mahi mahi fish sandwich and fries. The sandwich was awesome and I was very pleased. Our service was slow, especially because we were one of 5 other tables in the whole place. But I think the server was new. She was very nice, but didn&#39;t seem like she had much experience. My sandwich came out 10mins after my husbands dinner. So that was kind of annoying.... He had a burger,and said it was average at best. We also had the venison stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer. They were delicious. I would go back for another random fish sandwich craving or for lunch. The enormous salt water fish tank was very impressive and nice to look at.

I have been here once before and shared the sampler appetizer with calamari, alligator, cheese quesadillas and chicken wings. I had crab legs and my boyfriend had the steak and everything was good, but this time I had the angler which was bad. Crab cake was gross, I don&#39;t know why but it was.

We went before going to the iPic theatre. Of course we started with  delicious drinks (try the rum runner). The shrimp and scallop dinner was exceptional . Very fussy about my scallops and these were cooked perfectly, not over-seasoned. The flavor of the scallop should not be drowned in seasoning anyways. The side dishes were also very good. I would definitely not doubt the fact that this restaurant resides inside of a outdoor store. The atmosphere, waiter staff, food, drink, evening was very nice.

I asked the host if we could sit near the fish tank as my 2 year old love &#34;fishies&#34; and she was very accommodating.
Our server was friendly and very informative. She listed all the specials and answered any questions we had. There was a fishing ban on Mahi Mahi and she was very helpful in suggesting other substitutes.

I got the Pro Patron Margarita and it was awesome. One of the best margarita&#39;s I&#39;ve ever had, and not too overpriced either. $8.95 for a Patron margarita is pretty decent. My mother in law got some sort of punch that she said was good and my husband and father in law got beer. I will say, if anything, the beer is slightly overpriced, but not by much.

We ordered our son&#39;s meal first and it came out super fast. This is a bonus when you are eating with small children.

Our food also came out quickly. I got the Island Mahi Mahi but has to substitute for Grouper b/c of the ban. It had a good teriyaki glaze and the grouper was a decent substitute though I would like to try it again with the Mahi. I didn&#39;t particularly care for the &#34;salsa&#34; on the side of it. (not sure if that&#39;s what it&#39;s called but it looked like a fruit salsa) There was an overpowering spice in it that didn&#39;t really jive with my tastebuds.
My husband got the blackened tilapia and my in-laws got the fish and chips. Overall we were all pleased with our food.
 
If you are in the mood for seafood this place is definitely worth the trip. It is a laid back atmosphere and very family friendly. I would like to go back in the summer as they have a nice outdoor patio area. Hopefully they will have Mahi Mahi by then, b/c I would really like to try the Mahi Mahi Sandwhich."

The first time I ate here with my dad I certainly had my reservations, but now it is one of our favorite lunch spots. The ambiance is very St. Pete&#39;s Beach and there are different kinds of fish all over the walls. In the center of the restaurant is a massive saltwater reef tank and my son could not love it more. 

Before your meal a little loaf of bread with sugar baked on top is brought out with butter and it is awesome. The drinks are all delicious and fun. The meals are all reasonably priced, for seafood, which tends to cost a little more anyways. I have not had anything here yet I haven&#39;t liked. There are even fun appetizers like Smoked Wahoo Dip or Fried Alligator! PS, the alligator is really good. 

It is very kid friendly here and they will happily seat you next to the big tank. My son loves to watch the fish swim and point out the sharks on the wall. Once we even got to watch a diver swimming around in there. The servers have all been friendly and attentive. We have had an order or two mixed up here but they are always very quick to fix it. 

My only real complaint about this place is the cleanliness. Most of the times we come here I notice stuff on the floor. It&#39;s not like all the tables are nasty, but some more care could be taken and we have never had dirty silverware or glasses. Someone needs to go in there with a good vacuum and just go nuts. I still love this place though!"

The service is always fast &amp; friendly. Their lobster tails are pretty good. (They are a lil sauce happy w/ many of their items on the menu. If you like a lot of sauces, come here).

Let&#39;s start with the strong points:  Very attractive decor and theme centered around a beautiful salt water fish tank in the center of the bar and restaurant.  Definitely a place to make you feel like you are on vacation down in Florida and not in the west suburbs of Chicago for a couple of hours.

Service is solid, friendly, and attentive.

The Bloody Mary&#39;s are a great standout at the bar, and if you go on weekends, be prepared for a bit of a wait (no reservations taken).  However, if you can nab one of the soft leather couches, you and your brood will enjoy taking in the atmosphere and even reading through the extensive menu, which of course centers on fish and seafood.  Although we did not try any of the non-seafood selections, there were plenty to choose from for those that are not big fans of fish.

Appetizers:  Love the shrimp cocktail----fresh, great presentation, and excellent cocktail sauce.  Loved them!

The calamari seemed to be an appetizer that would be worthwhile, but ours was pretty undercooked and the girls would not eat it.  We were in too big of a hurry to re-order it.

Big thumbs up on the Caeser salad.  Girls both loved it and would order it again.

Two of us ordered the Angler plate which came with (your choice of preparation) blackened Mahi Mahi, a crab cake, and (your choice of preparation) grilled shrimp.  

The Mahi Mahi was terrific as was the shrimp.  They did a nice job with the blackening seasoning and grilling.  The crabcake tasted like either something that was defrosted and pan fried, or made with  poorer quality canned crab.  Not that bad, but not that great.  I think this is not the place to go if you are dying for killer crab cakes.  I could eat mine and enjoy it, but not so with my special gal.  She wanted nothing to do with hers.

If I had to do it over, I would have gone with the fresh fish of the day which was trout based on the guests at the next table.  They have a plentitude of fish choices and I like that they are not all fried.  

Thumbs down to the clam chowder.  Tasted like flour, potatoes, and hot water.  Not the worst I have ever had, but a notch below a canned variety from the supermarket. 

Don&#39;t take my negative comments to heart----the rest of the experience was so good, that we would definitely go back.  Perhaps if the &#39;dings&#39; we noticed were removed next time, we would ratchet the rating up to 4 stars."

I was at first a bit leery because it&#39;s attached to the Bass Pro Shop; when we lived in TX, there was a Bass Pro near us with a steakhouse attached, which was overpriced and overrated. So it was a pleasant surprise to find that Islamorada is consistently good (we&#39;ve been several times), not overly expensive, and not just getting by on dragging people in from the connected store. 

The setting is actually rather calming, as long as there are no screaming children at the next table: the lobby and dining room are dominated by a HUGE fish tank full of colorful tropical swimmers, so you can watch them while sitting at the bar or while dining. If you&#39;re a more restless type and want to roam while waiting for your table, you can take your buzzer and wander throughout the Bass Pro Shop and it will still go off anywhere on the premesis; I&#39;m not really into hunting and camping, but they actually have some other cool stuff to check out that I wouldn&#39;t have expected, so maybe browse for fun if it&#39;s your first time in. 

The fish has been enjoyable every time we&#39;ve gone. I often get the 5 oz broiled lobster tail for $17.95 (or if you&#39;re hungrier, you can get twin tails for ten dollars more), which is always succulent and moist. They also generally have a variety of seafood specials on top of their broad menu, so there&#39;s a lot to choose from. 

Definitely the best fish value to be found in this area, nice setting and good food."

I had the grilled mahi mahi with roasted garlic, wild rice, and vegetables.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  My wife had the grilled grouper, and our niece had roasted garlic shrimp and crab legs.  Everything was very good, and I tried it all.

Prices are a little bit high, but not too bad.  Drink prices were crazy, but then again, I think they are almost everywhere :),

We&#39;ll be back, I&#39;m sure."

We took our 6 yr old and my mother in law for her B-Day.  They have a kids menu which is always a plus. Food was so good and Fresh. We travel from Elgin because its so worth the drive! Our service could have been better. Our server seemed to be lost a couple of times and we had to wait far too long to request dessert and then our check. But other than that totally WORTH IT! We love the keys and this is the closest we can get to it when in Chicagoland!!! Put this on your list of places to go to and its fun to hang out in the Bass pro shop afterwards.

--EVERYTHING is fried, unless stated otherwise.
--From the looks of other reviews, it seems like there&#39;s usually at least 1 thing a night that you can&#39;t get from their menu; for us it was the alligator bites.
--The portions are microscopic.  The calamari were about the size of a fingernail, and as far as I can tell, their clam strips are just seafood-flavored strings of dough.  Try and put your fork into either, and it will basically crumble into dust.

Everybody I ate with agreed that the place sucked.  We won&#39;t be going back."

First off when we were seated the booth was weird, we kept sliding downwards off the seats. And the booth was very tight and our knees kept knocking. I can&#39;t imagine anyone sitting there that was extremely tall! So we moved booths, the same thing there so obviously a flaw. We moved to a table by the roaring fireplace, we were very comfortable! We then stared across at the gorgeous monster of a salt water fish tank. With the high ceilings and all the fish decor, it was just gorgeous! Our server was very nice! We had a coupon but still was very expensive! $60 w/ coupon!! But your paying for the decor, I&#39;m sure! Located inside the Bass Pro Shop in the Promenade Mall in Bolingbrook. I can see why this place gets overlooked. #1 for the expense and #2 it is inside another store! But for a special occasion or just to try- why not! I&#39;m not a fish person so I had the shrimp, it was very good, but tiny! Get the full order because a half order is probably like only 3-4 shrimp! All in all- I would come back again, it was very nice!"

I enjoyed watching the fish way more than I enjoyed my dining experience here.  

Located inside of the Bass Pro Shop, the restaurant itself is bedecked with nautical themed items.  Model boats, rudders, anchors, and of course a mounted swordfish adorned the walls. Fake palm trees in the corners, and calypso music playing in the background.  Reminded me of an upscale (well a little more upscale) Red Lobster.

Now on to the food and service.  I had phoned in a reservation the week before for a party of nine.  So we were seated promptly (there was a pretty good crowd there for a Sunday afternoon.)   So we were seated and greeted by our server.  Not that she wasn&#39;t efficient throughout the whole ordeal, but she took her job very seriously, which unfortunately came across as rather angry.  For appetizers, we had alligator nuggets, and potato chip nachos.  The nachos were good, but the alligator nuggets blew.  You could taste nothing but the overwhelming and salty batter in which they were fried.  For the main course, I ordered the red snapper Reuben sandwich.  What makes a Ruben, a Ruben, you ask?  My opinion would be the sauerkraut.  But unfortunately, when received, my sandwich was lacking it.  And instead of Swiss, I received cheddar cheese.  So it turned out to be a snapper sandwich with cheddar and thousand island dressing.  Very disappointing, as was the cole slaw our server had raved about.  It was more like shredded cabbage and carrots with vinegar.  But the key lime pie we all shared for desert was very good, and I&#39;m not even a big key lime fan.  I think it was the graham cracker crust that really did it for me.  

I don&#39;t see myself returning here.  The food was only average, and the prices a bit too steep.  (I felt that I was paying tourist prices to eat in my own town.)"

I really enjoyed the relaxing feel of the MASSIVE aquarium that spanned through a good portion of the dining room. 

First off our waitress mildly amused me. She attacked her job with a certain professional exuberance that was a tad over the top.  She annoyed some people in our group of 9 but she did a good job of taking care of us. 

The appetizers were OK. We had a variety of different appetizers (gator bites, fried combo, nachos) and nothing really stood out but nothing was really dissappointing either. I ordered the garlic grilled catfish. They did forget to add the garlic. If they did add any garlic, I could not taste it. HOWEVER... The catfish itself was delicious. It had an excelent grilled flavor and had a freshness that I am really not used to tasting."

We started with some Loaded Tater Totchos... These are tots topped with beer braised beef, chili, cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes, and a side of sour cream. We elected to leave off the corn salsa. Ok, who doesn&#39;t love tots?! Load a bunch of yummy stuff on them and they&#39;re even better!  

I ordered the Farm Burger which is a beef burger topped with a fried egg, cheddar, applewood smoked bacon, and a bacon spread. I feel like not enough people know about applewood smoked bacon! It&#39;s my favorite of all the bacons by far! And, if you can have breakfast on a burger for dinner, you really should! This was a really good burger and they did a good job cooking it to my preferred medium rare!

The boy ordered the 5 Cheese Man &#39;N Cheez with cavatappi and bacon! Typically, he&#39;s a burger guy, but lately he&#39;s been on a serious mac kick! He really enjoyed this plate of noodles and the 5 cheese combo!

The patio was kinda busy and our poor server was really pushed to his limits! He was fairly new and though he&#39;s waited tables before he was still getting used to his new digs. He did a really good job for what he was handed and we were patient with him cuz we really had nowhere to be. He made sure we had everything we needed and that&#39;s all we ask!"

I&#39;ve been here on a few occasions.... twice to have an appetizer and a beer or two while out running errands and once for lunch. Each visit has been enjoyable.

Over the course of these visits, I&#39;ve had the Drunken Shrimp and Chicken Finger appetizers, as well as the Cubano Press sandwich. The food and service have always been very good.

The only glitch was that on my lunchtime visit, their credit card processor broke down and I was required to sign one of the old time carbon copy forms after a very long wait. The bartender was apologetic enough, though.

I&#39;m not sure what the issue is, but the last 2 times we have ordered take out from there, our food(same order) has been different. My mom&#39;s BBQ pork sandwich one time had coleslaw topped on it, but the last two times no evidence of &#39;slaw... Not a deal breaker, but just odd that sometimes it has it and other times no topping.

Tonight we ordered take out, and my husband and I both got the chicken Caesar press sandwiches. We used to get this all the time, and it used to have cut up chicken pieces in it. I&#39;m not sure why they changed this, but tonight we got overcooked, hard, almost burnt chicken. And it was like two huge hunks of breast. No more cut up, diced chicken. Yuck. Husband and I both said we won&#39;t be getting that again. Go back to the old way, Taphouse, or get better cooks that know what overcooked chicken looks like."

The service is okay at Tap House, but nothing spectacular. The waitress or bartender will check on you once in a while, but they are not super attentive.

I would give this place another star but the drinks are $$$. It&#39;s like $8 for a well drink, and $12 for a cocktail. I get what they&#39;re trying to be, but I think it would help the business if they lowered prices a bit. You&#39;re attracting a young crowd- have some specials at least!"

Upon entering, the space felt big, while also cozy and welcoming at the same time. Great vibe. We sat at a booth at the opposite end of the entrance and I loved our view of the restaurant and bar. 

We came for the $5 burger Tuesday&#39;s and were not disappointed. These are not skimpy mini burgers, but rather large burgers normally offered on the menu for over twice the price on a regular day. Plus, it comes with a side of fries, tater tots, or salad. I got the tots, my boyfriend got the fries. I think the tots were the clear winner. They were crispy on the outside, soft and hot on the inside. I dipped them in ketchup with a drizzle of their hot sauce - yum! Everything tasted freshly prepared, with fresh ingredients. 

They have a great beer menu to boot. I ordered the daily special (some winter beer) for $3.95 and my boyfriend ordered another beer from the winter beer selection as well.

All of them?

ALL of them. I was amazed when my wife and I ordered enough food for about six people for about $25. Each appetizer is enough for probably 6 people to share and get several bites out of. But two people can easily make a meal on 2-3 selections and have leftovers to spare.

Drinks are great. Service is great. And I almost hate to review the place because I want to keep this secret all to myself. But yet, I don&#39;t because I want them to have all the success so they stay there as long as possible and keep offering their amazing food to me for low prices."

Great rotating tap selection and there&#39;s always a drinkable beer-of-the-month...October was Goose Island IPA, which is underrated in my book.

I have never drank toilet water but the drunken shrimp are as close as I&#39;m ever going to get. 

They were so bad and rancid they did have a taste but it was so bad it made me gag. Seriously they should probably focus on 10 items that they can make well. The menus has 3005 items and they cant get it right.

The service is high schoolish not professional. It took forever to get our tab after the offensive food we wanted to run out screaming.

I get that it&#39;s probably a local spot for some and thus they rate it higher than they would otherwise, but I&#39;m looking for good food, ambiance and service and this fell short on all three.  I walked in and it says &#39;seat yourself&#39;, which is kind of awkward cause it&#39;s a larger place.  So I sat down and no one even looked in my direction.  I then noticed there was an empty glass with a lime in it across the table so someone must have been sitting there and no one cleaned off the table.  Odd.  So I decided to get up and go to the bar where I felt I could not be ignored.  The women working behind was lacking in the urgency department and, while she was nice, she clearly paid must more attention to the male patrons, checking on them twice for my one throughout the evening.  As I said, she was actually friendly when she did come over but that was not as frequent as what I would have liked.  The fireplace is cool but other than that, it looks like a very dated dive bar and I think they&#39;re trying to be like an upscale sports bar (perhaps I&#39;m wrong) but that vibe is definitely not coming through and I got the feeling they have a lot of local regulars so they probably don&#39;t have to try that hard.  

We got our food in a normal amount of time but all of it was cold as though it had been sitting out for a while.  That was a let down.  My husband and I took one look at the &#39;prime rib&#39; sliders and were taken aback.  This was literally some like Carl Budding cold cuts with no sauce or anything just slapped on a slider bun.  What a huge let down.  I honestly wish I had taken a picture cause I could not believed they passed these off as prime rib.  The meat was extremely gray and unappetizing.  I make prime rib at home and get sliders often when I see them on the menu and these looked nothing like they should have.  We opted for tots instead of fries and they were okay.  Nothing wrong there, just average tots but not soggy or anything negative.  The wings that people rave about were the other item we got to share.  Upon recommendation from our server, she said to go for the exotic over the hot.  Now, I like things spicy, really spicy, and she said the hot was not actually all that hot so I was happy she was honest with us and suggested the exotic.  At first, I really enjoyed the flavor.  I thought it was balanced and pretty tasty.  I think if you&#39;re sharing them with a big group where you only eat one or two, they&#39;re probably a solid option but if you&#39;re getting these for a meal, they quickly become too sweet and have a lingering one-tone sweet flavor that just takes over your palate.  Other than the sauce being too sweet, the boneless wings were average in texture and size and were cooked fine so nothing wrong there.  But when people rave about these wings and their menu claims they have won competitions, I expected them to be large, tender, above average quality before the sauce even comes into play and they were not.  I can see those who live within walking distance frequenting but it is not a destination spot by any means."

But my most recent visit was awful.   Showed up and sat down on a Wednesday night when it was slow.   Waiter (Matt) came over after about 10 minutes and took our drink orders.   While he was taking our orders he just gave off a very rude and irritated aura, and made me feel like he didn&#39;t want us to be there.

After he brings our drinks and takes our food order, he ignores us for almost our entire dinner.  Another waiter brought our food to us, and he walked past our table 5 times while we had empty drinks, ignored us calling for him, and purposefully looked away and/or at the ground as he approached our table.   Finally he comes over and busses our plates without saying a word.

Having worked in the food service industry in the past, I must say that his behavior was uncalled for, and really left a sour taste in my mouth towards a place that I previously really liked, and regularly visited."

Being left to wait about an hour for your food when the place is almost empty is bad enough.

To then say &#34;it&#39;s coming right up&#34; a few times while we are still waiting another 15 minutes doesn&#39;t help. I was ready to walk out by the time my food arrived. The place might be ok for drinks. The food wasn&#39;t bad quality. Just don&#39;t come looking for a quick meal or good service!

I came here as part of a group of 7 at lunch, with one or two other parties in the whole restaurant. From the time we ordered to the time we had food on the table, it was almost exactly an hour. In the intervening time, the waitress came up to us only once to tell us that the food was almost out because one of our co-workers said something to her about it on the way to the bathroom. From the time she came up to us to tell us the food is almost out, to when the food actually came out, it was another 15 min. One of our co-workers had to wait even longer to get his meal, and Tap House ended up comping that one -which is nice of them, except that we had ALL been waiting over an hour to eat at that point, with no apology from the manager or explanation as to why it was taking an eternity. Only the waitress apologized after my co-worker lightly complained. Some sage advice, Tap House - don&#39;t take an hour to serve lunch when the restaurant is almost empty, if you must move at a glacial pace, at least warn us beforehand that we will have to wait an hour for food so that we can plan accordingly (read: leave), and have the wait staff at least check on us and bring silverware, water refills, and condiments to the table before the food is out so we don&#39;t have to wait even longer to eat."

We sat there for three hours for what should have been a one hour meal. There was a party in the back so I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt for the slow service. Got up to get my own water at the bar while waiting for a drink order. As soon as I come up the shift manager/bartender decides to pour the beers we were waiting for. 
Walked to the bathroom to see who I hope is not really a manager chatting with the BOH staff. So that&#39;s why I can&#39;t get a drink! Ok. 
Salad comes out and the seafood smells old so we send it back. No one asked why we sent it back or why we didn&#39;t like it. Shit, I was halfway done with my replacement Caesar before anyone asked if it was better.  As a manager, isn&#39;t it your responsibility to reconcile situations like this?
When we get our check, the manager didn&#39;t take a drink off the tab we never received. When my BF goes up to say something she doesn&#39;t believe him! Says we have to talk to our waitress. Then just stands there. Shouldn&#39;t you go get said waitress since you don&#39;t want to help us?
Since I&#39;m sick of waiting forever for everything I walk straight into the kitchen looking for her. The manager screams &#34;who does that?!&#34; to her staff since I&#39;m the bad guy now. Umm people who don&#39;t get attentive service. That&#39;s who. 
I manage a restaurant and understand when things get overwhelming but even after the party left the service did not get better. The manager&#39;s TERRIBLE attitude and nonchalance was just the icing on the cake."

He brought food without silverware, took drink orders from half the table and walked away. Every time we needed anything we had to flag him down, he never stopped by on his own. No wonder his mom was outside waiting for him after his shift."

On the first visit here, we felt our waitress was less than attentive.  However, this second time we had a waitress in training who we couldn&#39;t even tell it was her first day until she told us.  The other waitress training her was equally awesome.  Both ladies were great - checked on us frequently without being overbearing.  We enjoyed their smiles and especially appreciated that they did not get offended when we decided to move to the bar after we finished dinner.

The bartender gets equal accolades here... I had a pretty tough time deciding on my 3rd round and she was quite patient with me.  In fact, didn&#39;t even give me remote attitude when I asked for a cola between rounds.

The ambiance here is more that of a restaurant.. more booths and tables.  But you seat yourself.  I&#39;m definitely going to be coming back for dinner a few more times.  The Bacon, blue cheese, mushroom burger was awesome.  Their Bavarian pretzels come hot to your table and they seem so fresh.  I saw several other items that I&#39;d like to try."

#3 -- TAP HOUSE GRILL

Doesn&#39;t it just figure that one of the best restaurant/bars in the Chicagoland area is conveniently located only 2 miles from my childhood home?  If I still lived in Darien, I would come here to eat &amp; drink once a week.  Easily.

Since they opened their doors 4/5 years ago, Tap House has garnered quite a loyal following among their patrons (yours truly is one of them).  I have never had anything less than a 5* experience here, whether it was getting a beer and an appetizer, or pigging out on one of their sensational entrees.  The beer selection is VAST.....almost too vast; there&#39;s an entirely separate menu for draft, bottled, and canned beers, as well as a chalkboard that rotates out &#39;beers of the day/week/month&#39;.  The servers are highly knowledgeable about their brews and their food.  Several of the servers are pretty cute and have even given great suggestions about things to order.

I&#39;ve ordered a multitude of different things here over the past few years, and not one of them was sub par.  Highlights include the &#39;THG stuffed burger&#39;, which is filled with melted pepper jack cheese and diced jalapenos.  The &#39;four napkin pork nachos&#39; are heavenly and should be shared by two people, or one extremely fat person (like me).

The boneless wings are the best I&#39;ve ever had, and I have had a LOT of boneless wings.  As with most places that offer it, they come in honey BBQ, Asian zing whatever, and hot buffalo......but there&#39;s a hidden wing sauce that&#39;s not on the menu; it&#39;s called Blazin&#39; BBQ, and holy shitsnacks is it H-O-T.  There are very few edible items in this world that can make me sweat, much less have a noticeable effect on my demeanor.  These wings do both.  They&#39;re straight from satan&#39;s hollow, the sauce forged in the 7th circle of hell, and served by Dante.  But yet I get them time and time again, because the flavor is terrific and I&#39;m a closet masochist.  But the next day.......ohhh lordy lord, I wish I owned a bidet.......

Indoor ambiance is perfect--dim lighting, dark wood, comfy booths, plenty of flatscreen TVs, and a very unusual (but extremely cool-looking) back-lit shark decoration.  Hard to describe, but once you see it you&#39;ll go &#34;OHHHH, that is actually pretty slick&#34; and then, like me, you&#39;ll want one hanging on your wall at home.  In addition to all of the above, they have reduced-price burger Wednesdays, trivia night Tuesdays, and occasionally host a beer + food pairing as part of a private event sponsored by some local brewery.

Tap House is a stand-out neighborhood spot, and if I didn&#39;t live so far away, I would regularly give them my business.....I&#39;m a fan.  In fact, I&#39;m a HUGE fan.
I can only think of two restaurants in the &#39;burbs that can top Tap House, because Tap House is tip-top.  #alliterationFTW"

Huge beer selection, so expect a brand new list every time you go. 
The staff is pretty good most of the time. The only downer to this place is one time they lost my friends debit card and she was out of state. It was a big ordeal and the manager told us they she never saw the card when she was the one who rang us up, but everyone makes mistakes."

Had dinner here with my wife and father last night and was concerned about the service given the reviews below. Our waiter Emily could not have been more spot on with menu assistance, drink orders and special requests for dietary issues. We had salads, burgers and boneless chicken wings. The Farm Burger cooked desired temps but there was not a lot of flavor, or meat. At these price points ($10.95 w/ small salad or fries) I would expect a 8oz burger, or at least 3-4 strips of bacon. Boneless wings are what they are - good coating and white meat. Sadly, I could not partake in their great beet selection which is really the star of the show here."

The appetizers (Fried mushroom and Chicken) were fine. The skinny Margarita was pretty nice. I saw a mile long beer selections on the menu which could be a nice option for my hubby next time. 

What I liked the most is the atmosphere. Just a place I feel comfortable and I could relax. Other people&#39;s noise was a perfect background for our own conversation. 

The services were awesome. The waitress was nice and checked on us often but not intrusive. 

The only thing I didn&#39;t like what the floor was kind of sticky under our table.

While we were there, we were checked in on a few times, which was at normal intervals.  

My only complaint was that there was no Guinness.

The waitress that seated my party of five took twenty mins to come to our table before we even got out drinks ordered. 15 mins after that we got out drinks and ordered food. She then proceeded to ignore us when we kept trying to flag her down for refills. And keep in mind the night we went it was pretty much dead. We could see her in the back chatting with another employee. When we finally got out food it was great bit then we never saw our waitress again until she brought our check out and kind of seemed like she wanted to boot us out.

The menu has changed once again. Sad to report, the grilled chicken sandwich on the hoagie roll is still MIA. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the new BLT. Plate presentation was attractive. Half the sandwich was piled on the other, with a large toothpick through the center. The bread was lightly toasted and the sandwich had a rich honey flavor. Perhaps it came from the bacon, or a glaze. Either way, it had a special touch. The tater tots were in good form, as usual: crispy and non-greasy.

Props to the Tap House for this menu improvement."

Here are the days where you order up a $8 beer, sniff to guess the ingredients, and marvel over it&#39;s complexity. 

Why is this relevant? Because if you like craft beer, this is your spot. And I&#39;ve also seen one of the most amazing bloody marys made here too. The food is great as well. I ordered a Cuban sandwich with a side of tater tots. Yes. Tater tots. And it was magnificent. Don&#39;t act like you&#39;re too good for tater tots.

But yesterday, the bartender acted like she was almost annoyed that we were ordering things and taking her away from her - friends? Regulars? Either way, she pretty much straight up ignored us. It&#39;s not like it was closing time - it was 7pm on a Sunday and the Hawks game had just started. But the bar was nearly empty and now I understand why. 
All four of us are or were in the service industry, so usually we&#39;re the first to make excuses for a lapse in service. However, it was pretty blatant our bartender didn&#39;t care when 3 of the 4 of us had empty glasses, she made eye contact, then proceeded to chat up someone else at the bar who had a full glass in front of them.
The food was sub par - the calamari was rubbery &amp; chewy, the cheese curds were mostly breading (usually my favorite menu item!), and when my friend asked for cheese sauce for his fries, she brought a gritty, cold cheese spread. She then ignored us again for about 10 mins, never bothering to ask how our food was.
Again, I&#39;m usually the first to defend anyone in the service industry. This was just very disappointing and none of us will be returning."

Efficient (though not particularly friendly or engaging) customer service.

Excellent fried pickles (these are the first I&#39;ve had that are a little sweet).

The restaurant was VERY loud- the music was loud but also just the sound in general was a little overwhelming. 

The booths are cool but are in half circles (so you can see everyone else in the room but it&#39;s hard to carry on a conversation with how you are seated and with how loud it is in the restaurant).

I was disappointed in the chicken fingers. I think I was expecting them to be like the ones at Village Tavern. To each his own.

The food was really good. I had the wings and the pretzel appetizer and the sauces that come with it were all delicious. My sister for a burger and she said it was also delicious. 

Another thing that really made the trip was the bartender we had.  His name was Hitch. He was hilarious was always close by and checked up on us a lot.

It&#39;s loud in here, and it gets louder as the night progresses.  In the summer you can escape the noise by sitting on the patio, but that closes earlyish, so don&#39;t count in it past 9:30.

The first few times I was there I had great servers. The last two times were subpar.  

Its a bummer they cant play bands or music outside but im sure its due to noise ordinance so I dont hold that against them. 

Today I had a house salad with ranch, shredded cheese and chicken. Please dont mix the dressing in, tap house! All it does is get really really watered down and the lettuce gets wilty and croutons get mushy. That was a real disappointment, was looking forward to a good ranch salad. And please no celery, it has such a distinct taste that it ruins the rest of the salad. Friend had sandwich and fries, fries were sooo salty. Please use less salt, I can salt them myself if I dont think there&#39;s enough. Cant take the salt back though. And then the bloody Mary&#39;s. Not a fan, wanted to like it cause I loooove bloodys but not this one. Friend couldnt even drink hers, to spicy. Now I like spice so I was sort of ok with that, it was the flavor of the bloody I didn&#39;t like. I gave it one less star due to this experience today and lack of good service. 

Note to servers: please for the love of God, do not bring up how you found old tater totes when sweeping to the rest of the staff. Especially at the server station at the bar while guests are eating within ear shot. I was eating man, come on thats gross."

We got a few appetizers to share. The Sausage &amp;Mozzerella wontons, the Buffalo Chicken &amp; Mozzerella wonton, Baby Cheeseburgers, wing sampler ( 3 wings, Tequila Citrus), fried pickles, and the soft glazed Bavarian pretzels. Phew, did I miss anything? Lol

I&#39;ve had their cheeseburgers at the Glen Ellyn location and they&#39;re one of my favorite sliders. The buffalo chicken and mozzarella wontons were exceptional! Fried goodness in my mouth. So wrong but so good. The spiciness of the wonton was deliciously complimented by the side of blue cheese. Yum! The rest of the stuff was pretty good too.

He ordered the root beer and it was tasty. Me I had a hard time choosing a beer from their huge selection. Lots of tasty stuff on tap. 

The rest of the menu looked good and I will be back soon to try something else.

THG (Tap House Grill) is a pretty spiffy place. There&#39;s a decent size bar in the middle that goes straight into the kitchen, and then there are a lot of high standing tables with tall chairs. It looks nice and almost suggests that it wants to be a high roller place, but not. The floor, walls, and lighting say &#34;Ballin!&#34; but the decor, furniture, and bar say &#34;chill.&#34; What I love about the atmosphere, though, is that it&#39;s really chill. They&#39;ve even got a table surrounded by couches. The place has a lot of different personalities. And if that wasn&#39;t great enough, there&#39;s a very decent size patio out back with wire tables and comfy mesh chairs. Since it&#39;s sort of a neighborhood place, this place is perfect if you want to kick back, relax, have a beer and a smile, or if you had a horrible day and want to drink to oblivion. 

BEER
They have quite the list of beers filling 2 pages with 2 columns each. I think they have Two Brother&#39;s entire gamut, if you like them. I enjoy craft beers, but when I&#39;m eating food, it&#39;s Heineken. And I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s a mental thing, but I can only enjoy a Heine in a bottle. They served it in a can. Yes, I&#39;m serious. I would take a Bud Light before I drink a Heine in a can or a glass, or even on tap. 

WINGS
Screamer is their hottest and it&#39;s got a decent kick, but not even close to BW3 Blazin. Blazin BBQ has a good mix of sweet and spicy, I taste small traces of habenero in it. Sriracha eerily has the sriracha flavor, but none of its spice. Chipotle and hot taste the same and are boring.

PRETZELS
Maybe I had them when they were cold, I don&#39;t know, I didn&#39;t really care for them. You get 4 different kinds, but they&#39;re really nothing special. The cheese sauces were just ok too.

CRISPY FRIED BACON
OMG! Why didn&#39;t anybody think of this before...and notify me? Who would&#39;ve thought you can make bacon even more unhealthy by battering it, deep frying it, and then dipping it in ranch?! I don&#39;t think you can get more &#34;Comfort Food&#34; than this. It&#39;s so unhealthy, yet so freaking delicious, your conscience is going to eat itself.

CRISPY FRIED PICKLES
First time I ever had this, from anywhere. The breading here is really good. It&#39;s not &#34;crispy,&#34; though, it&#39;s &#34;crunchy.&#34; Yes there&#39;s a difference, and I like crunchy better anyway. The pickle itself is good and the dipping in ranch makes it excellent. The pickle almost had a cinnamon flavor to it, though, which was kind of weird.

THG STUFFED BURGER
This is their signature burger. Don&#39;t give up when you first see it, though. It&#39;s a bun, a patty, some melty cheese, and a lettuce leaf. Seems skimpy, but when you bite into it, and burn your tongue, you&#39;ll realize it&#39;s stuffed with cheese too (of course, you&#39;d know if you read the menu too). The jack and jalapeno cheddar flavors really come out and add all the flavor and seasoning you need for this burger. It&#39;s not spicy, but it&#39;s still very tasty.

SO?
This is a very decent place. Food here is good, atmosphere is awesome, and beers are flowing aplenty. The thing is, it&#39;s just a place that does &#34;regular&#34; very well. There isn&#39;t anything very unique about it or its fare. If we were wondering where to eat for dinner and I was in the area, THG may not be the 1st choice, but it would definitely receive mention."

They have a really decent beverage menu, including specific beer of the day specials.  I was happy to try some things I had not seen before and they also have a pretty wide local selection.  Lots of things on draft and even more things in bottles.  They also have $1 samples so you can build your own beer tasting flight, which is fun.  

On previous visits, we have enjoyed the burgers - very tasty, those.  This most recent visit, we only had appetizers.  I was a little apprehensive about fried bacon but it turned out to be really evil and delicious and perfectly breaded and fried, salty, crispy goodness.  I also liked the cheese curds and the hummus and pita plate - decent array of different bits and bites to try.

Service was a bit above average and our server did a nice job of recommending beers for one of our party members who was unsure about what to try.

I would recommend the latter. The pairings are monthly, and usually 45/person. I went to the Stone beer pairing in January. Tasting the beers is really fun, if you&#39;re into that sort of thing. However, the food portions are tiny, which isn&#39;t necessarily unusual, but they are not very tasty at all. I only truly enjoyed one of the five courses, the dessert. It was a chocolate cake of some sort, and I love chocolate, so I&#39;m a pretty easy sell. The &#34;main&#34; course was lamb and there was barely any meat on the bone. Very disappointing. I think the major issue here is that the food is supposed to be really upscale and sophisticated and it falls short. Also, its hard to keep that sort of food fresh when you&#39;re attempting to serve 100s of people all at once. 

Now, we returned for dinner with friends last night and it was fantastic! I think unique pub fare and comfort foods are the chefs&#39; strengths. I had a burger with brie cheese and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. My only issues were that it was very skimp on the brie and the house salad it came with had no flavor. Next time I will get the tots for my side instead! My husband had tots with his panini and he was very pleased. My husband has also had the cuban and the stuffed burger, both of which he raved about.

Also, we had a really great server. She was very knowledgeable about the beer menu and made great recommendations.  We will definitely be returning!"

So saying that I was happy when Taphouse opened their doors. I don&#39;t know why it took me this long to write a review on them. At first I/we were defiantly regulars there. Rafael and Ashley were/are our favorite workers there. VERY nice people and social. Always nice to be remembered when you walk in. We cooled it for wow several months so I hope they are still there!

I personally enjoy the food. I have not had anything that I don&#39;t like. Great big cheese sticks (Planks), burgers etc. Nice presentation. HUGE beer menu and awesome martini&#39;s.

I finally find a bar that is decent and close to my parents house! This location has been a couple of things in the past, indian restaurant, shitty sports bar.  So when meeting up with another friend who has also moved away, I consulted Yelp to find a cool place for us to meet up.

We only had drinks, and the beer menu was impressive. They had all kinds of beers from around the country and locally and I chose both Three Floyd&#39;s and Goose Island 312 as my drinks.  However, the service left a little to be desired. After a shift change, our new waitress was kind of a bitch to us, I think she was irritated that we were hanging at our table a little too long after we cashed out. It was dead anyways so I&#39;m not sure why the attitude.

The service is always good, everywhere I have ever sat has been comfortable and I have never been overlooked by the staff.

Boneless wings for desert were good enough, the hot buffalo sauce really isn&#39;t hot though.  Great chunky blue cheese dressing on the side.
Service was slightly slow but I don&#39;t think it was necessarily the waitresses fault, it looked like she had a lot of tables.  I ordered a couple of mixed drinks and honestly...

They have an extensive list of craft beers which they change every so often and is right up my alley! Since its constantly changing they have a website where you can check out what is on the list for that day (http://www.beermenus.com/places/1530-tap-house-grill). As an avid craft beer drinker, I really like the options they have both on tap and in a can. WARNING: if you sit on the patio the beer samples end up costing you $1 (but if you sit at the bar they&#39;re free).

The interior is dimly light, romantic and classy. This can be a great place for a first date or a night out with friends. They even have a fireplace!

We sat outside on the patio which felt a little dingy, but at least the chairs and umbrellas were a nice touch. Only problem was the smokers went to the corner to light up and it smelled while we were trying to eat. WORDS OF WISDOM: when sitting on the patio go as far away from the front corner as possible!!!

I like this place.... I just haven&#39;t figured out to what extent, but I want to go back and find out!"

Bring 20, and you&#39;re in for an experience.

Last Saturday, a friend of ours hosted his 30th birthday bash here. Why? There&#39;s a three-page beer menu, all the staff are certified cicerones, and the waiters took the constant addition of more bodies in stride. Even if it meant building a table Tetris block by block. There&#39;s not one reason he&#39;s a regular, there are 30. 

Each person ordered multiple drinks and meals, and each ticket went to a different person (seriously, one tab for drinks and individual tabs for food). Why the staff didn&#39;t just blanch and run screaming I&#39;ll never know. Especially when bottles started breaking. Their superhuman ability to hear over the Saturday night Blackhawks din, tolerate drunken ramblings and still laugh at our jokes makes me think Xavier, thy name is Taphouse.

And you know the most remarkable thing? A waitress, on her day off, came to join us. She listened, she laughed, she chatted and shared, and soon she was as much a part of this motley crew of friends as any one of us. She was an absolute delight: fun, friendly, intelligent, and absolutely adorable.

Lessons learned from my first trip to a bar -- It&#39;s all about the staff. It&#39;s noisy. And I have the palette of an eight-year-old."

The first time was after a very long day at a funeral and I definitely needed to be surrounded by some good friends, food, and beer.  Happened to be one of my friends would be playing at Tap House.

When I walked in the place was CROW-DED.  Not a problem, my friends had a table.  The beer list was overwhelming! Was about 3 pages or so stapled together.  At this point I was just getting into this craft beer thing and had no idea what to get.  Luckily our server was very helpful and I settled on a beer.  And then another one.  And another one.  We also got some pretty delish apps!  They had my favorite- fried pickles! Although these ones are kind of sweet, and I can&#39;t say I&#39;m too fond of them.  But, um, deep fried bacon? Yum. 

Just recently I saw someone posted about 3Floyds Wednesday at Tap House.  They have select 3.50 3F beers, so I checked it out with a friend.  It was pretty dead, and they were playing some pretty crappy music.  There was a good song here and there, but for the most part it was terrible.  They also ended up running out of Alpha King (one of the selected 3F&#39;s brews) so I switched to Robert the Bruce. 

We only stayed for two beers because my friend had to get up early, and the atmosphere was kind of bringing us down anyways.  I&#39;ll definitely go back, because they do seem to have some pretty decent specials throughout the week.  I also saw they have a 3Floyds Night of the Flight coming soon! And some other pretty awesome craft beer events I&#39;d recommend checking out.  

I think I&#39;ll give this place one more chance and hopefully give it a couple more stars next time."

Sounds like a good/bad idea if you have work early on tues. They don&#39;t have quite the selection of say the Bavarian Lodge but who cares when its not as busy and right down the street from me. They also have crazy beer and food specials every day of the week. The staff is friendly and is fairly knowledgeable about the beer which is a bonus.

As far as the food you can go wrong with the nachos or the fried pickles. The burgers are decent and are a special on wed along with 3 Floyds beers which is just the icing on the cake. I wish they could keep their beer garden open longer but that is just splitting hairs. Overall this is a great place to check out some new beers and have some good food. You really can&#39;t beat the specials and the atmosphere - they even have couches to sit on in front of the tvs."

She reserved a side-room, which we had all to ourselves, and they had a big screen playing the Bulls game, and then the Blackhawks game.  It was like being in our own private showroom.  We kept our server hopping, since there were about 15 of us, but she managed to keep everything straight and moved pretty quickly too.  They had an impressive beer list that seriously surprised me - I did not at ALL expect a list like that, and our server did a good job describing the different flavors for me.  I tried a few different things and enjoyed all of them.

The food was less impressive.  My boyfriend ordered the burger with bleu cheese, bacon, mushrooms, and grilled onions.  He said it was okay, pretty mediocre, with the patty tasting mostly of meat and not much other seasoning.  I ordered the Crispy Chicken Chipotle Salad, which was a large salad in a big bowl.  On the sides of the bowl, lay three crispy chicken fingers.  I guess I was expecting like, chopped chicken to be mixed into the bowl, not three rando chicken fingers sitting around the outside.  It was a bit odd.  Chicken fingers were very crispy and bready, which I like, and juicy on the inside.  Other than that though, the salad was pretty blah.  Limp romaine lettuce, tiny shreds of cheese, random bits of corn, black beans and peppers scattered around - it just wasn&#39;t very flavorful.  I&#39;m sure it would&#39;ve been if I dumped the ranch and chipotle dressing all over it, but I ordered them on the side and tried to use them sparingly.  It was not anything special, sounded way more delish on the menu.

But, I think it&#39;s a really nice place to have a good beer and watch a game!  I wouldn&#39;t bother with food in future, but it&#39;s a fun sports bar atmosphere with capable service."

Being my first time here, I grabbed a menu to give it a look and didn&#39;t realize they had table service, until a large group came in behind me moments later. That group was approached immediately with chips and salsa. Eventually someone did walk over with some chips and salsa and asked if I was eating in. I indicated it was my first time and wanted to look over the menu.

I went for a trifecta of asada, chicken and al pastor tacos. I added beans and rice for $1.50. The chips were terrible and appears they toss some new chips in with what ever the last table left behind. Salsa wasn&#39;t anything special and neither bottled sauce has heat.

I ended up bringing the al pastor and most of the beans and rice home. I find it really awkward to have to go to the register with out a bill in hand. I don&#39;t see a return visit, servers weren&#39;t attentive and I was never really sure who my server was? Receipt doesn&#39;t have a way to leave a tip either, very strange set up."

We were in the area and check Yelp for local joints for lunch.  So many good reviews.  Why?  Tried three tacos: steak, al pastor, and carnitas.  Of the three, the carnitas at least had some flavor.  The beef seemed tough, and the al pastor was non-descript.  The service wss also lacking.  They were more interested in watching the soap opera on tv than serving customers.  For our drinks we ordered cola products and given the choice of bottle or can.  Ok....we chose bottles.  They were delivered along with straws.  The straws were shorter than the bottle.    Um.....kinda tricky.  They were  Mexican Coca Cola products, meaning they were made with sugar rather than corn syrup.

Sadly that may have been the highlight of the meal.

I spent many years missing out on the best,  most affordable, and authentic Mexican food Bolingbrook has to offer.

Set in the strip mall directly across from Menards, the place is still pretty much brand new, with shiny floors, tables, and semi-uncomfortable fiberboard booth seating.  They do a fair dine-in business, but totally kill it with take out!  We were here on a Sunday, and I am not exaggerating when I say I saw at least 20 gallons of menudo walk out the door in an hour.  Although I am personally not a fan of menudo, I have a deep afinity for their Al Pastor quesadillas (tender, juicy, flavorful pork, with lettuce, sour cream, and cheese) and guacamole (huge portion with a perfect mix of ingredients) with warm, homemade chips.

It was easy to overlook in the little strip mall, but after giving it a try I have been going back at least once a week. Steak tacos are my favorite, and the ones at  El Balcon are high quality and some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. I haven&#39;t sampled too much of the menu besides different types of tacos and a couple of entrees, but everything so far has been top notch.

I also had an incident when ordering delivery from El Balcon that was resolved extremely professionally. It was very busy and the woman taking my order forgot to get my address and did not have my number on file. I ordered and paid using a credit card. I called an hour later wondering what was up, and she informed me what had happened. She delivered the order soon after herself, paid me cash for the delivery cost charged to my card, and credited my entire order back because of the mix-up. The girl was even willing to give me a refund for my order in cash (and drive it out to me again), but I accepted store credit for future orders.

Overall: extremely great food that you will definitely enjoy, and staff that is very pleasant, professional, and caring about their customers."

I would recommend sitting at a table because the booths are weird in the fact that they are angled at an oblique angle which makes you sit and eat at an acute angle to compensate.  The chips are very good!  Homemade and not oversalted.  Only gripe was the first basket we decimated was all broken pieces.  This was remedied with the second helping.

Got a Cubana torta and carne asada huarache to go.  It was amazing how much was piled onto my torta, as it contained milanesa (breaded steak), scrambled eggs, ham, length-sliced hotdogs, onions, tomatoes, avocado, refried beans, and cheese; all that for $6.  

Wish I could sing similar praises for the huarache as it was just steak on a tortilla with melted cheese and nothing else, wished it would have had lettuce, tomato, onions, cactus, something else added to it as it hardly had any flavor to it.

Location is kinda hidden as its in a 2 floor strip mall that&#39;s next to the Foremost Liquors and a hair product store."

I can definitely say after trying it out a few times that it was worth the wait.

This is a family-owned restaurant that used to have a location elsewhere but I had not tried out that one before it closed. I do know however that they had many big fans of the old place. Their new location is a great one - right by downtown Oak Brook but just off the main drag so that traffic isn&#39;t as terrible (right near Westmore-Meyers Rd. and Butterfield, but you have to turn north on W-M to find it). There seemed to be plenty of available parking spots when I went there and they also had free valet service for the front lot. I love the inside of the restaurant - classy, with that great Italian feel that makes your experience. The wait staff was friendly, and the food was served promptly. They make all of their pasta fresh and I could definitely taste the difference. And my favorite part of the experience was the fantastic prices for reasonable portions. I&#39;m so used to spending $15+ for a ridiculously-sized dish. Here the dishes run more like $7-13 and you get the perfect amount of food. They have a nice selection of drinks here as well. If you&#39;re looking for fresh and home-cooked Italian food without a crazy sticker shock, this is a great place to check out."

Environment - I met up with a group of friends on a Friday evening..parking was a bit harder to find in that area. The interior of the bistro was beautiful! Dim lights and beautiful decor on the walls. There is a huge bar space in a separate area (You could hear the Cubbies loudd and clearrrr) Our host and server were just fine..although I could sense that they were a little annoyed by the fact that we didn&#39;t fully understand the &#34;family style&#34; dinner..we figured it out!

Food - We started off with fried calamari..those were delish! They were mixed with giardiniera peppers..I think. For dinner, I got the grilled salmon. The salmon was good..but it was odd not to have any sort of sides..I had to order mixed veggies later. Which came after I was done with the salmon. I guess for the price $13 it was okay? IDK. My friends ordered variety of other items. I did get my soda in a glass bottle! That was fun! :)

To sum it up - it was alright..I wouldn&#39;t go back unless a friend had a birthday party and was dying to eat at Basta Pasta."

I hope they read this and make adjustments to their kitchen. We started with the giardinera calamari, which came in about three minutes, and tasted precooked..... for my entrée I chose spaghetti with White clam sauce, OMG I cannot stress how the bland and tasteless it was.... The baked clams and scallops were cold and seemed as though they too were also pre-cooked. My husband is Chilean sea bass, special of the evening btw, was less than 6 ounces, at a $24 for the plate served with a smile, the plate was empty. 

The restaurant is absolutely beautiful, has a beautiful atmosphere for a Friday night evening time with your partner, and service was outstanding. The kitchen needs to bring it up a few notches for prices that they are charging and my taste!

We scored big time with this experiment.  My husband and I loved our dinner here.  

The restaurant itself is beautiful inside.  Lots of seating options.  Nice booths in the dining room, attractive bar, banquet seating in the bar area, high top tables. tables in a screened in patio and tables completely outside.  Each table had a candle on it.

Dinner started with a complimentary small loaf of chewy Italian bread.  It was just a little warm.  I hope they put their menu online.  There&#39;s alot on the menu.  We decided on:

Twelve inch Margherita pizza. Very good.  The basil and tomatoes were so fresh.

Fettuccine in their cream sauce.  My husband loved it.He wanted to eat the entire bowl in one sitting but he just couldn&#39;t.

I was really excited about my choice, The Sunday Supper Salad.  It consisted of a large, soft meatball on one side of the plate, a mixed green salad with balsamic vinegar dressing in the middle of the plate and then an Italian sausage link on the right side of the plate.  Both the meatball and sausage had a wonderful tomato sauce on them. Being the true Italian that I am, I used my bread from the beginning of the meal to soak up that delicious tomato sauce on the plate.

I wish I would have had room for dessert.

The service was excellent. Our server did her job well. The manager stopped by our table to ask how everything was and if he could get us anything.  Nice touch.  Our food came out in a timely fashion and it was hot.

I think the restaurant is in a good location because of the office buildings and condos and apartments nearby.  I hope the neighborhood supports this restaurant."

I liked the pasta with meat sauce I got but the meatball on the side was not very tasty. They were also still unorganized for having been open a while now. We got there at 7p and didn&#39;t get our food out until 8:30p. This was even after the group had ordered and there was not many other patrons in the restaurant. Our servers came back to check on us periodically at the beginning but not much once the orders were placed. We did get free bruschetta though so thanks for that. However the other plates my friends received were not that great. Ravioli only had 5 barely stuffed pieces, and giardinera chicken was dry. We wouldn&#39;t return."

When we arrived, we couldn&#39;t decide if we wanted to sit inside or out. Since there was no wait to dine inside, we went with that. Being that it had been a hotly contested debate amongst our group before arriving, we were laughing amongst ourselves about it. The hostess shot us a nasty look and whispered to her co-hostess about us. I stepped outside once during our long, long, LONG time at the restaurant to get some air and was again greeted with glares and whispered comments. Gross.

Our waitress was AH-MAY-ZING and really did the very best she could in a bad situation but homegirl was running around like a crazy person trying to service way too many customers with very little help. I never saw another server in the dining room. As a result, we didn&#39;t get to order for a very long time. Appetizers came out quickly, but the wait for the meals was awful. We waited well over an hour for our food. When it came out, those who ordered sides (the menu is all ala carte) got just their side dishes first. Everything was of varying temperatures and portion sizes. My husband&#39;s Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes were cold but his chicken parm was the temperature of the sun. Another member of our group ordered brociole, and the portion was like, half an appetizer. I ordered the lemon chicken. The portion was enormous, the sauce was fine, the chicken was decently cooked. It was a perfectly average meal, served relatively cold, but edible. At some point a manager came over to ask how things were and we mentioned the wait for the food - which, from what I could tell, was NOT the waitress&#39; fault, and moments later SHE came over to apologize again! Bogus! I would never have said a word if I knew she&#39;d have been blamed for an understaffed establishment. 

As a result of this disaster, the management took a considerable portion of our bill off of our check AND offered us a free dessert, which I thought was kind. We&#39;d been there so long that I couldn&#39;t really bear the thought of dessert, but we pressed on and had the tiramisu, the cappuccino cheesecake, and the key lime pie. All were fine.

So, I dunno, guys. Food fine. Service fine. Pacing of meal? Atrocious. Hostesses? Horrible. I appreciated management actively working to make our experience better, but all of the wait and nastiness notwithstanding, the food would still have only been 3-star. And we were trapped there almost four full hours. I think maybe they need to work out some staffing kinks, and I&#39;d be willing to try again and hopefully come out of it with a better vibe."

For starters, my wife had a salad and I had the chicken dumpling soup. The soup was &#34;ok,&#34; but didn&#39;t taste all that different from canned soup of the same flavor that I have had. My wife had the gnocchi and I had the whole wheat linguini. She related that her was &#34;good,&#34; although gnocchi is her favorite meal ever so if it was only  &#34;good,&#34; then I&#39;m sure there was plenty of room for improvement. My linguini was decent, however, I felt like the serving size was smaller than I anticipated. When I think of an Italian restaurant that focuses on pasta, I think of large, generous portions and that wasn&#39;t the case. 

Our bill was close to $50 for two people, although my wife did have a $9 glass of house Cabernet. We may come back to try it one more time, but I don&#39;t see it going into the &#34;date night&#34; rotation."

Let me start off by saying service was much better then the first time we were at this location. 
We had 7 people in our group for my wife&#39;s birthday. Since opening in Oakbrook Terrace they decided to change their menu tasting menu. The waiter did not inform us of this so we were a Little surprised when our entrées came in they were quite a bit smaller than our last visit. I felt bad I&#39;m sure some of her just went home hungry  About an hour before reservation I had called and spoke with the hostess about my wife&#39;s birthday she said she would let our server know. After dinner we ordered dessert and I was expecting someone to sing happy birthday or something like that. I wasn&#39;t expecting anything for free but we got no acknowledgment of her birthday at all."

I started with the pasta fagoli.  It was listed under appetizers which I thought was odd.  Pasta fagoli is soup.  Anyway it came out and it had almost no liquid in the bowl.  It was VERY thick to the point of being unappetizing.  We were told later that this is the way they make it.  Big mistake.  Our server didn&#39;t write anything down.  He acted like he was trying to impress us.  The problem is he got our orders wrong.  I ordered chicken Marsala.  It came out and was two very thin pieces of overcooked meat.  I found out later that it was veal Marsala.  The sauce was VERY sweet.  It was like eating a dessert.  We ordered tiramisu for dessert.  We were served cheesecake.  

It might be worth a try if you happen to be driving by but certainly don&#39;t go out of your way to get here.  And remember their pasta fagoli is not a soup."

We made reservations on Friday for a special occasion for 6. Started off with cocktails, 18 baked clams and both the red and white wine sauce mussels. Clams we&#39;re good. The white sauce was bland for the mussels and the red sauce was fine. 2 of us ordered salads and only one came. 31 minutes waiting for entrees we asked the waiter - who got the manager, and he said the chicken on the bone takes 35 minutes, and he mentioned that it says that on the menu.. The menu only said that about a different chicken entree so he brought us a &#34;free&#34; bottle of red wine for the wait. The vodka sauce pasta was good, eggplant parm was good, chicken was flavorful and juicy. I had risotto (amazing but hard to mess up) with scallops on top but they were cut up and way over cooked and chewy. I did not try the sausage with peppers but was told it was not good. Our 6th guest had veal Parmesan and they brought out the wrong order, it looked like 3 chicken strips from mcdonalds. Dry and plain just on a plate. We said he got the veal so he realized he brought out the wrong meal and apologized. We had to wait another 15 minutes for his food and wait so ours didn&#39;t get cold... They brought out 2 free desserts for that mistake as well. In the end they charged us for the bottle of wine. We just couldn&#39;t wait to get out of there so we paid and left. The bus boy was polite but the bus woman working had an attitude when we were walking out. The waiter didn&#39;t really seem apologetic overall. The hostess was polite. That&#39;s about it.

As we got there we were greeted by the hostess which looked as if she did not even want to be there. Asked if we were going to dine in and we mentioned that we did and if it was OK to go inside the bar area. Would&#39;ve been nice if she asked was it your first time being here?. No instead she said just walk through those doors and seat yourself. We walked inside in the place seemed pretty packed. We ended up sitting by one of the booths that was available. As we got seated we were greeted by one of the waiters and sad to say we didn&#39;t understand what he was saying. Had to have him repeat himself a couple times. We asked for recommendations since it was our first time. But all he said to us that everything was good. So we asked about the braciole he said it&#39;s amazing!!! And for the parmesan it&#39;s amazing. So as a side we asked for the fried green beans. Before ordering I simply asked him if it&#39;s battered and deep fried. He said yes. As we got our food we looked at the green beans and they weren&#39;t as he described. We tried it. And it was very bland I then asked one of the managers that was present about the fried green beans as stated on the menu. He said well it&#39;s pan fried. Well that&#39;s not what the waiter had described to us we even confirmed how it&#39;s prepared. And it&#39;s states FRIED GREEN BEANS on the menu. And the manager was really rude and made it seem like I didn&#39;t know how to read a menu. My friend and I even asked the ladies next to us what their interpretation of fried green beans are? And just as we thought lightly battered and deep fried. They also couldn&#39;t understand what the waiter was saying to them. I then tried out the braciole and it had so much black pepper and it was dry. I then mentioned to a different manager about the braciole it was dry and very peppery. He then asked me have you ever even eaten Braciole before? I was so thrown back when he questioned me he made it seem like I&#39;ve never had it before or dinned at an Italian restaurant. And yes I have I had my friends that are Italian make it homemade and had it at numerous Italian restaurants. So we gave it back. But all together it was a horrible experience. I will never step foot in that place again. Service was horrible one of the servers wiped our table and all the crumbs were just swept off the table to the floor!!!! Food was bland and no wonder the food is priced the way it is. The way management handled the situation was unprofessional. But one good thing they gave us complimentary tiramisu (which was actually good). And our glass was always filled w water that&#39;s a plus. I was hoping this local restaurant would have been a 5.

Off putting. They also ran out of a popular beer which was disappointing for a fellow guest at our table. As the entrees came out our waiter was very disorganized and began just calling out &#34;who ordered the salmon?&#34; while running around the table. It was only a group of 13 so this was really off putting. I was served my side before the entree. Unfortunately one of our fellow diners was served a plate of pasta with gluten despite her request for gluten free due to an allergy. Her throat noticeably swell and it seemed a manager or owner (not sure) became defensive when she brought the error to her attention. A few orders were wrong or we had extras. The food was okay. Lastly we asked if we could separate the checks (from the beginning) and our waiter basically told us it would take him too long so we were left to break out our calculators and split up the check between 4 parties. Like I said the food was okay - but I definitely don&#39;t recommend for groups.

The other night the food was off. Mainly the mussels in marinara appetizer. They were all very gamey in taste. I ate four hoping they would get better, they didn&#39;t. I asked the people I was with to try them and one person, no kidding, went to the bathroom to spit it out. They tasted like a horse barn smells! When the server took back the remaining ones you would think that she would ask if they were ok because 90% were still in the dish. She did not. I&#39;m sure the cooks back there knew that they were no good and still served them anyway. That put a damper on the rest of the food which was a bummer. 

We each had pasta dishes and mine was tasty but not enough to brag about. The other people thought theirs was average. The bread served ahead of time was rock hard. It was 6pm. 

Let&#39;s hope the kitchen gets their act together because the place is nice inside and they have a screened in patio which looked nice too. I&#39;ll go for a drink and test an appetizer out to see where they stand but never mussels -ever!"

The manager gave us a free appetizer of Bruschetta, which was nice. It was absent of cheese but it was good and the thought was great. The baked clams were outstanding. Great seasoning and flavor, baked to perfection. The grilled octopus was nicely done but could&#39;ve use a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. I ordered the  pasta  with prosciutto and peas and it was delicious.  The desserts were delicious too. The key lime pie was perfect.

The service will get better over time. I was a bit confused as to who was my waiter since there were two people taking our order we were barely done with our appetizers and the main dish was served.   We didn&#39;t mind because it takes time for the team to find their cadence."

The fresh baked bread was so warm &amp; yummy!  We started with an order of fried calamari! It was fantastic! (So good!!!) I ordered gnocchi with marinara sauce. (I ate the whole bowl, it was delicious!) My 95 year old friend ordered chicken Parmesan, she loved it and had enough to take home leftover for lunch tomorrow. Another friend ordered the salmon with a side of risotto and raved about how good it was!

He was so personable and knowledgeable and of course the quality of food was not his fault.      Ordered calamari giardinera for an appetizer, came out about 30 min later.  Owner and waiter were very apologetic.  My dad ordered the lamb chops for $19, came out and were the size of my middle finger, could have ordered the lamb chop appetizer for $10 and gotten the same amount.  My husband ordered the four cheese chicken with whole wheat fettuccine.  The chicken was so chewy, he actually had to spit it out.  We sent that back and my husband said hold the chicken with the new meal they offered to make him.  His new meal arrived and the fettuccine was not even done, so crunchy.  My mom had the penne arrabiata, was just ok. WAY too much sauce.  I had the orecchiette Alfredo which actually was really good.  All 4 of us raved about it and shared it.  Ordered a sausage giardinera pizza to go.  Was mushy and thought it was supposed to be thin crust. Was definitely not what I would classify as thin crust.  Too much sauce and no flavor.  Was odd because my husband and I came here about a week after they opened and the food was amazing and that is why we returned.  However, not sure I will be back, maybe for some drinks and the live entertainment.  I will say though the ambience, owners, staff, outdoor area are the best part!  Ask for Joseph to be your server!  And Tony the owner was very gracious and apologetic for all of the food mishaps."

I am a big fan of outside dining and this place is still a great choice.  In fact they have both outside and a covered &amp; enclosed dining area.  Food was good.  Started with a stuffed pepper for an app and it could have been my entre.  My wife had Rigatoni &amp; sausage.  I had Chicken Marsala.  I would say both were good and probably above average.  There are many great Italian spots in the area, so competition is tough.  One of the things about Volare I loved was that the crowd was very authentic.  I always had a slight feel that many of the other patrons were straight out of &#34;Goodfellas&#34; which is a true testament to an Italian restaurant.  The crowd here seemed a little different.

Our last purchase my husband went to pick up our order and the noodle dish was incorrect. My VERY picky toddler only eats the noodle dish and will only eat the spaghetti-like noodle, so my husband know to always check to make sure. 
Knowing mistakes happen, my husband informed the woman cashier of the error. She proceeded to tell him that she was sure that is what he had ordered. Then the man from the back came forward to back the woman up and they were both standing there, telling my husband he was wrong. My husband then tried to explain we have a picky 3 year old that won&#39;t eat that noodle and we just need an order of the spaghetti-like noodle. The cashier then told him that they &#34;have a business to run, look around, no one will eat that here either.&#34;

The hot and sour soup which was average and about what we expected. The Empress Chicken was chicken fried fillets with a sauce that was way too sweet.  The Chicken and broccoli was bland.  A note all ingredients were fine.

We ordered the American Chinese cuisine instead of the authentic Chinese cuisine.  We are suspecting that is the difference.  We are not sure.  Maybe that is why we were disappointed in the food."

Looks like they are most known for their Japanese salt and pepper tofu. Most every table had an order. The tofu were light and fluffy with good flavors. The portion size overall seemed a little small. We also had pea tips in garlic sauce and a type of fried wide noodles. Both were good. I wouldn&#39;t say I was blown away, but I was satisfied for the most part. 

My complaints: The noodle dish was lacking on the noodles. To compensate, they threw in way too many sprouts. Like two giant handfuls. I like sprouts, but this was like a way to hide that there wasn&#39;t much noodle.

We ordered 3 different dishes since we had 3 people dining. They came out with 2 bowls of rice so naturally we asked for another bowl. They brought us out one and later we saw that they charged us for extra rice. The kicker here is that we ordered another order of the Japanese salt and pepper tofu towards the middle of the meal and without asking whether we needed it or not (didn&#39;t need it), they brought us another bowl of rice. :| Small charge, yes, but really?"

The salt &amp; pepper smelt are popular too, if you&#39;re into smelt. (They&#39;re not as scary as they look!)

The beef chow fun is decent, but I get it only because just eating fried tofu doesn&#39;t make much of a meal. It&#39;s simple--rice noodles, beef, bean spouts, green onions, and alot of oil to make it yummy!

SMELT is a must order with the red vinegar.

My dishes were: Salt / Pepper Japanese Tofu, Salt / Pepper Shrimp, and Beef + Chinese Broccoli Chow Fun (Sauced).  The tofu and shrimp were on point, but the Chow Fun resonated with me.  They prepped the noodles by properly frying them so the outer edges were crisped, and then poured the gravy over everything (authentic).

Please give them more business, but then maybe not... because their lunch prices were way competitive.  Average dish runs you about 7 bucks at lunch time 11AM-3PM; that&#39;s a damn good deal."

Until recently, I&#39;ve limited my selections to the Americanized Chinese menu. I&#39;ve always been thrilled with the quality of food I&#39;ve received for the money - especially the lunch specials.

 Increasingly, I&#39;ve been hearing chatter on the LTH Forum about how the authentic Chinese menu is where it&#39;s at. There are some who feel this is one of the best places outside of Chinatown to dine in the area. In particular, people are raving about one dish - Japanese Tofu with Spicy and Salt. I am a confirmed omnivore, with a strong emphasis on the meaty side of the protein spectrum. I&#39;m glad I gave this version of Tofu a chance. 

The disks of tofu, each about the size of 6 stacked half-dollars, were fried to perfection and simply tossed with chopped jalapenos without sauce. Despite the simplicity of the dish, it was really delicious. The tofu had a wonderfully creamy texture underneath the thin fried skin. The jalapenos brought the heat, but not so much that it overpowered the tofu. Because there was no sauce, you could include as much spice as desired into each mouthful.

This unassuming restaurant in a strip mall on Cass south of 63rd is a real gem. I plan to explore the authentic Chinese portion of the menu on future visits."

Oh fail. It is a authentic chinese restaurant yes, but the quality is way below par with Chinatown restaurants. We came here for a afternoon wedding reception party. The restaurant is super small first of all which is not a big problem because I like mom and pop shops. But the food leaves much to be desired. The main issues, the cripsy chicken with shrimp chips. I have no idea how in the world they cut up the chicken or how they fried/cooked it but 1/2 of the pieces were not edible. Just very dark meat with lots of bone fragments. The cold platter consisted of BBQ pork. Weakest cold platter I have ever had for a wedding. A lot of the other dishes were so so like the sweet and sour pork which was over fried and crunchy. The lobster was clearly not fresh, the meat was mushy and had no substance to it. Take heed of all the other reviews and go to Chinatown if you want a authentic meal.

Pro: none

Cons: small parking lot, lower quality cantonese food

Hidden gem:
None"

They offer a great heated tapioca dish as dessert that is very tasty. 

Service here is terrible! Our waitress gave us so much attitude from the start. We weren&#39;t being difficult or anything. She would walk away while we were asking her a question. She responded sarcastically to our questions once she did hear us out. If it was just me dining I would have walked away from the start and ate elsewhere. My parents like the food there so I was obliged to stay. I just felt terrible that my parents were trying to be so nice to our waitress and she was so rude. They tipped her a generous amount too.  I hope she doesn&#39;t act this rude to others.

I am dying to eat what people actually eat over there, and I know orange chicken isn&#39;t what&#39;s popping in china. (Kinda like saying Taco Bell is Mexican!) 
         Anywho the boy and I stopped here, and placed a carryout order. I ordered salt &amp; pepper smelt based on recommendations by fellow yelper Christina S. I ordered close to closing time, and one customer never showed up for a pickup order so they sold me their $30 order for 8 bucks! More food to try!  
             I tried their chicken fried rice and I loved it!! I usually DETEST chicken fried rice because the chicken is usually dry, but that wasn&#39;t the case. It was nice and flavorful! I tried their sweet and sour chicken- not impressed at all. This was a part of that other persons order they sold me. Massive fail. The meat had no taste and the sweet and sour sauce was watery. My salt and pepper smelt- hell yeah!!! This dish was the business people!! The fish tasted great, and the pepper blend was awesome! Seasoned just right with the right amount of kick. I couldn&#39;t finish it all that night, but best believe I tore it up the next morning. I will definitely be back to try other things!

We ordered:
Turnip+Beef Pot (i think they called it a Casserole in English?)
     - very tender and flavorful. too bad my &#34;uncle&#34; hogged it all
Tofu Pot
     - interesting mix of flavors.... very fresh squid. not too chewy.
Walnut Shrimp w/ Mayonnaise
     - Isn&#39;t it supposed to be tossed in mayo? They got lazy and just squeezed giant noodles of mayo over the fried shrimp.
Spicy Salt and Pepper Fried Smelt Fish
     - Fried fish was kind of bland. I ended up picking at and eating the jalapenos. Nice crispy, non-oily fry.
And some type of beancurd/veggie stir-fry (Ong Choy I think)

The meal was followed by a taro+tapioca sweet soup."

The patrons are 50% true Chinese decent, which is usually a great sign of good Chinese food, in our experience. 

We ordered carry-out which was fair. We ordered Kung pao chicken, and moo shu pork. My parents liked it, my sister did not. She even thought the steam rice was not quality. The moo shu was lots of cabbage and short on pork and high in MSG and sodium. The Kung pao was ok/passable, lots of MSG though.

A few days later, we went to dine in...this is really where the rubber met the road. It was terrible. How can this place be considered &#34;good&#34; Chinese? We ordered the dumpling and noodle soup ($11.50), the shrimp egg foo young ($8), and fried smelts ($10). The fried smelts were served head and eggs removed. Smelts are tiny little fish. Once you remove that, you are eating breading and bones. There was also no real flavor, just fry oil and salt with breading. The egg foo young sauce was bland as well. Shrimps were small and not prevalent in the egg patty. Oh, the soup, the dumplings were the best tasting out of every thing we ordered. However, the shrimp were not deveined (come on! This is cooking 101! You have to remove the vein-that is the shrimps digestive system!), and the left little parts of the shells in the dumpling mixture (pork-shrimp). They also placed a whole package of noodles in the soup bowl....I&#39;m not kidding. If the soup broth had any real depth in flavor, they killed it by adding the entire package of yellow noodles. Alls you could taste in the broth was noodle water. And, that was Not a good flavor.

If you are used to good Chinese food, authentic and quality, do not go here."

Honestly just as good as anything you can get from Chinatown. Best part is that sometimes they will also do deliver based on how busy they are and how far away you are from them! Very small restaurant and can get quite crazy over weekends and holidays. 

My favorite dishes:

1) Japanese Tofu with Spice and Salt: Absolutely to die for! This dish is best eaten in the restaurant- carryout and deliver just don&#39;t&#39; do it justice!! To tofu is lightly fried in batter on the outside, but silken soft on the outside. The taste is also out of this world with the different spices and peppers.

2) Fujian Fried Rice: absolute favorite dish of mine that I honestly haven&#39;t&#39; been able to find replicated in many other places. It involves not just fried rice but also this great sauce that is literally poured on top of the rice and then mixed in. It gives the rice a great texture and flavor. A pseudo-congee if you will. Very hard to describe, but just trust me: TRY IT! You won&#39;t regret it. 

3) Roasted Duck: Different from Peking Duck in the sense that it&#39;s not dry at all- the skin is not that crispy and meat is more tender and flavored. It has a great taste. 

4) Beef Stew Casserole: I love the radishes that are mixed in and the sauce more than anything!

Definitely pay cash if possible and try the authentic menu...not the stuff you can find at panda express!"

It was a busy Saturday night and the room is pretty small--less than ten tables, I would estimate; but we were seated right away and given tea cups and a pot of tea. It did take a little while for our server to come back and get our order, but it was ok because it gave us some time to look over the menu--which is extensive and has lots of options for meat eaters and vegetarians alike. Most of it is Chinese but they did list a few Japanese style options as well. I haven&#39;t tried those, but it&#39;s nice they offer a variety.

Our server was friendly and polite, and came back to refill our water numerous times even though the restaurant was nearly full and she was taking care of all the tables herself.

Our first impression: As we walked in the door, we were greeted by a young lady who stared at us blankly while eating a bowl of soup. As we were escorted to our table, we viewed a couple of empty tables still laden with half-eaten food (which were cleared as we waited for our meal).

None of that Beef with Broccoli, Egg Foo Yung lameness here, this is actually real Chinese food for Chinese people done fast and right! Don&#39;t expect a lot of English or great personal service, but good hearty food. 

I&#39;ve eaten fare from Chinese Kitchen way too many times to count, but there are always some faves that I keep going back for:
- duck rolls
- flat noodles
- fried smelt
- shrimp with walnuts

*A few words for the wise though, pay in cash if you don&#39;t want an additional credit card fee. It&#39;s also not really a secret anymore that this place is so yummylicious so don&#39;t expect to come here on Chinese New Year without a reservation!"

I&#39;ve tried many dishes from their ginger scallion lobster, to salt/pepper shrimp to their basic veggies dishes, everything is awesome.

Only 10 tables in the entire restaurant and 1-2 waiters, service is not the best as to be expected.  I felt really bad for our waitress as it was only her and 1 busboy answering phones, seating ppl, taking orders, delivering, cleaning, etc.  she was definitely flustered.  i hope we gave her a good tip!

Food was very good.  First off, this place is a MUCH cheaper option than Mapo and comparable with Chinatown.  Most entrees were about $8-10.  We got the family meal so it was 5 entrees plus soup and a sweet dessert soup for under $50.

Japanese Tofu- sooo good!  i love tofu and when you lightly bread it and can get it soft and not greasy on the inside, it&#39;s a HUGE success.  not as egg-y as most other places- but i like it not egg-y.  very delicate both in texture and taste.  loved it!

Fried fish fillets in a onion sauce- eh.  Mapo&#39;s is much better.  fish fillets were a little mushy.

Stirfry bok choy- good.  but it&#39;s hard to mess that up.  it&#39;s just boy choy stirfried with garlic and oyster sauce.

salt and pepper pork- Yum! a few places that i&#39;ve been to that make this aren&#39;t that good because the meat is all bones.  here it&#39;s really meaty with some occassional bones.

beef something- pretty much just beef stirfried with green peppers and onions.  pretty good.  meat was very tender.

All in all- food was prob a 3/3.5, but the cost in combination with food would lure me back."

This is the premier Chinese (Cantonese) spot in West Chicagoland.  I&#39;ve been to about a dozen of them, and none can come close in terms of price, food quality, and selection.  Sure the service is as bad as in Chinatown, but the flavors are legit.  Don&#39;t waste your time, money, or calories on direct competitors.  Your search is over.  Just be prepared to repeat your order 2-3 times and slowly.  I&#39;ve had the following dishes, and all were on par with my medium-high standards for food:

-Beef and Chinese broccoli chow fun.  Not too much beef/broccoli, not too much noodle, not too much gravy.  A perfect mix.  Fresh, tender beef and greens.  They fry their noodles slightly crispy, but only a few noodles get hit with enough hot oil to make them crunchy.  Again, there are just enough rice noodles for those that like &#39;em crispy and for those that like &#39;em soft and pillowy.
-Peking style pork chops.  A simple, decent red sauce that can be replicated with a little experimenting.  The pork was cooked to the right amount of doneness.  And it wasn&#39;t overly bready or thick and corn starchy.  My only complaint was that they could debone their chops before breading and cooking, rather than serving up chops obviously cut by a Chinese cleaver (i.e. small fragments of bone once in a while).
-Chinese spinach with garlic.  Fresh, simple.  Not too much can be said about this dish, as it&#39;s pretty easy to prepare.
-Bitter melon and beef.  Beef was nice and tender, as was the bitter melon.  Nice and bitter.  Cooked with a good amount of black bean garlic flavor that wasn&#39;t overly apparent.

I will definitely be coming here as long as I live out west.  Be sure to save a couple of bucks and order their lunch specials from 11am-3pm everyday.  They also have daily specials displayed on their front door which usually look pretty good.  Highly recommended."

A lot of the people we&#39;ve eaten with always mention that the menu is very similar to Cantonese places in Chinatown, one of the only places that offer certain dishes in the area.

I think the food is good, depending on what you order, and a good option for catering as mentioned on other reviews as well.  Fried rice, salt and spicy tofu, Chinese veggies, etc are all good.

If you are Chinese, it is a good place to be accomodated with special orders, etc, for a good price.  However, I do prefer to go to Chinatown."

My sister was coming in from the city and we had plans to go to Lao Sze Chuan in Downers Grove. She had read the same review that I had and we changed our plans and visited Chinese Kitchen instead - great plan change. 

The restaurant resides in a strip mall, nestled between a Nancy&#39;s Pizza outlet and Ruta, a Lithuanian restaurant. The place is pretty bland looking; white walls, plain tables with white paper on them and a view of the parking lot. But, I didn&#39;t come for the décor, I came to eat, and eat we did. Our table of three ordered Szechuan Green Beans, Spicy and Salty Japanese Tofu, Six Happiness, Sweet and Sour Chicken and an order of fried noodles (the last two for my teenage daughter.) Everything was delicious and seasoned to perfection. I didn&#39;t have the salty taste in my mouth for hours afterwards - MSG hangover. The Tofu was phenomenal; the teenager even liked it. The Sweet and Sour Chicken was very tender and the sauce was a nice compliment, not the overpowering, cloyingly sweet concoction you normally get. The Six Happiness included BBQ pork, chicken, scallops and snow peas. Very savory, nothing overcooked. The portions are large and the entrée prices vary on either side of the $10 mark. As an added bonus, the bathrooms are clean, always a good sign in a restaurant."

The food is pretty tasty, though sometimes a bit oversalty, and is a fair representation of Chinese food overall (a wide variety of dishes, though the Cantonese stuff comes out ahead of the rest). Prices are reasonable and the last time I was there, they&#39;ll knock off 10% of your bill if you pay cash.

Time of my visit: Lunch

I live around their other location.  Since I was not sure what I was in the mood for, I figured I would try this place.

It was nice inside, but the outside temperature dropped over the last week or so, why was the air conditioner blasting?  I am the last one to complain about cold or hot, but it was a bit chilly inside.

I looked over a menu, asked my waitress for a recommendation and decided to get a rib &amp; skewer (mixed) platter with fries.

The waitress was prompted with my water and refills.  Over the service was good.  Food, however, was not as good as I anticipated.

My plate arrived and right away, I noticed the size of the skewers.  I was not expecting them to be a mile long, but that seemed to be a small.  Fries were your typical fries, nothing to rave about.  I tried chicken skewer first.  It was about what you&#39;d expect your average grilled chicken to be., not much of seasoning either.  Then I had stake skewer...  The stake was a bit chewy and  just like the chicken did not have much of flavor or seasoning.

The last thing I had was the ribs.  I would not call them famous...  Again, sadly, average at best...  For $14 and change I was expecting, at least ribs to be better.

Overall a C.  I will probably come back to try their burgers."

Ordered the sweet potato fries and they lacked the sweetness I was looking for.
For the final chapter in my dining adventure I ordered the BBQ chicken salad, and they knocked it out of the park! Tender chicken in BBQ sauce atop crisp greens, cheese, tomatoes, onion straws...and I added avocado for extra creaminess.
Ambiance is old rich dude pub, and prices are in line with expectation.

I ordered the Meatloaf, there was hardly any gravy and a small serving of what looked like day old veggies.  It was just ok.  I would not recommend due to the fact the meatloaf was not fresh, you can tell it had been sliced well before serving and looked as though the slices had been warmed on a pan.  Flavor was meh..

Service was very good. that I cannot complain about.  
Atmosphere was very nice too.  They just need to work on their food.

I will give them another shot but kind of disappointed for a first time visit.

This time I looked up the specials menu and when I got there, that is the exact menu I got which is already an improvement from the last time I came. I ordered:

Ribs and Skewer: (14.00): 3 rib bones, some skewers of beef, mashed potatoes, cole slaw, bbq sauce and teriyaki glaze. There were hits and misses with this one. The misses were the lumpy mashed potatoes with plenty of skin and the ribs which were generic and slightly burnt. The hits were the skewers which were juicy and well cooked and the glaze was fantastic. The cole slaw was also pretty good.(See picture)  

French onion: Same as before, pretty generic. They need to put it under the salamander longer to crisp up and brown the cheese more. 

The service was pretty good last time and was even better this time. This place is really on the ball when it comes to service. 

Overall I&#39;m gonna have to say its still generic tasting which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. Service is outstanding."

We ordered Mozzarella Sticks ($8 for 8 of &#39;em) as apps.  They were good, but a bit small and perhaps a tad overcooked.

He had the Bison Burger (on Specials menu).  It seemed moderately sized, and the fries were OK (no salt/seasoning).  I had the Grilled Fish Tacos ($10); they had a nice bit of heat but, unlike my counterpart&#39;s fries, were WAY salty!  The lettuce was extremely heavy-handed - it was impossible to find the fish underneath without totally deconstructing it!  They also had an awkward heaping pile o&#39; black beans and white rice with parsley.  Neither of the &#34;sides&#34; were seasoned nor anything worthwhile to eat (and I LIKE beans and rice).

Our server (Jen) was attentive but not overbearing.

In all it was just OK.  I think we&#39;d try something else instead next time!"

If you&#39;re not concerned about your daily carb intake... I suggest you try their mac &amp; cheese.  It&#39;s so cheesy and comes with onions, tomatoes... and BACON! 
They have seasonal specials, some are better than others.  They always have different drink specials too... Sometimes it&#39;s martini night, sometimes beer.  

Their burgers are above average and offer several different toppings, cheese, etc. Also, they have turkey, beef AND bison patties; the more options the better! 

They do have a couple* vegetarian options.

For not being a pizzeria, they have really good pizza.  It seems they just made new menus and got rid of my favorite, the mediterranean.  Lo and behold, I asked the server if they could still make it and they had no problem!

We sat at a pub table to grab some quick wings and a drink.  Well and a quick BOWL of soup.   

Our waitress came up and I ordered an angry orchard cider with a shot of fireball whiskey in it (ANGRY BALLS FTW!).  They have posters plastered all over for  Angry Orchard and she even repeated it back to me and said it was good.  

[Minus] 1 [star] : She brought me a Woodchuck Cider and a shot of fireball whiskey, no glass.  
Ok, I let the cider choice go because it was already open.  I asked for a glass and mixed my angry balls.  

We ordered our meal- two bowls of soup, wings with BLUE CHEESE. 

[Minus] 2 [stars]: She brought out my boyfriends bowl of soup, and my CUP of soup.  My boyfriend made her quickly aware that I had ordered a bowl and she said, &#34;Oh, well I can bring you out another cup then.  Its like the same thing as a bowl.&#34;  
Great, I look like the fatty eating two things of soup.  Thanks homie.  

[Minus] 3 [stars]: Our food comes out.  Wings on both ends.  My boyfriend correctly got his blue cheese, I had gotten ranch.  WRONG!
A guy had delivered our food instead of our waitress and I told him I had asked for blue cheese, his response was, &#34;Oh, now you want blue cheese not the ranch?&#34;  
Well, duh, that&#39;s what I ordered!

I was hangry, and now even more irritated because this server didn&#39;t get ANY of my orders correct.   Being the wonderfully crazy girl that I am I insisted that it must be because she was flirting with my boyfriend.  Then I realized, no, she just doesn&#39;t pay attention.
She didn&#39;t write anything down and even rolled her eyes when she brought me out my blue cheese.  Thanks for your wonderful service! *note the sarcasm.

There&#39;s nothing magical about it, but there&#39;s nothing terrible either.  The restaurant itself looks nice, it&#39;s clean, and it&#39;s pretty spacious.  There is a decent sized bar too, if you don&#39;t mind the loud emcee screaming over the microphone every 5-10 minutes.  I still am unsure of what he&#39;s doing over there...  

Some things that stand out are:

1.  The ribs are pretty good...to put it in to perspective, they are better than Famous Dave&#39;s ribs but are less than The Patio&#39;s and/or Barnelli&#39;s ribs.
2.  The new pretzel bun burger special is delicious.  I would definitely order it raw, as my medium came out well done, and I would add some spice to it (Frank&#39;s Red Hot sauce?  Pepperjack cheese?  Jalapenos?) but it was good.  It may just be the pretzel bun&#39;s deliciousness taking over, but I was a fan.
3.  There is FINALLY some good beer here.  It&#39;s not an extensive list, they are only in bottles, and the 3 Floyd&#39;s runs out fast, but there were a few good ones to choose from.  I ended up with a Lagunitas A Lil&#39; Sumpin&#39; Sumpin&#39;.

I had a burger, and she had a pasta dish.  The burger was a perfect medium-well in my book.  The fries were a little too cold, and it made me think they&#39;d been sitting out for awhile.

This is the kind of restaurant that suffers from an identity crisis.  Is it a bar?  A restaurant?  What&#39;s the focus of the menu?  I agree with the thought that this is a better option than Chili&#39;s or Friday&#39;s.  When we left around 11:30 pm, the DJ was starting to spin some techno/Euro music."

Wings are standard, nothing exceptional but if you&#39;re jonesing for some buffalo wings they fit the bill.

My daughter wouldn&#39;t eat her hamburger, but she was all about the broccoli and fries. Shoulda just ordered her the chicken fingers, ohhhh well.  

The man ordered the steak, it was a lot better than I expected. It was good quality meat, tender, and cooked just how he wanted it. It didn&#39;t seem like the kind of place that would have a good steak, but there you go.

I had the lime chicken, it&#39;s listed on the menu as under 550 calories. I ordered it to justify the couple of fat tires I drank, totally worked. I would probably order it again, but I want to try other stuff on their menu first. 

We&#39;ll definitely go back, it&#39;s nice and close to home and right by a bunch of stores so it&#39;s in a convenient location.

Although I cannot attest for the food this time (we had eaten elsewhere!), we did have the chance to imbibe in some of their delicious bevvies.

I cannot believe I have gone almost 28 years of my life (7 *legal* drinking years to my mom if she reads this...) without knowing what Rumchata.  If you have never had this, YOU MUST TRY IT IMMEDIATELY!

It is a shot of some kind of delightful rum.  It doesn&#39;t really matter what&#39;s in it, all that I know is that I was literally licking.the.shot.glass after taking it because it was amazing.  It tastes like the milk that&#39;s leftover after you eat your Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

No I am not kidding.  That is exactly what it tastes like.

The other drink I had, Skyy around the World was good too--five different kinds of Skyy and diet coke.  YUM!  And super strong.  But nothing will compare to the Rumchata, let&#39;s just be honest!

Our waitress was really good, too!!  I wish I remembered her name.  She was all over our table like white on rice (it&#39;s a good thing!) and we had a group of about 10 of us!

I had some of a martini, too.  I will be back for the drinks for sure!  Maybe next time I will be brave again and branch out to food again.

The bar is in an unlikely midtown location, enjoy the entrance and your very quiet greeting by a well-dressed someone of whom you must convince to let you in via a reservation (Sun-Mon-Tues only) or by agreeing to wait on a list.  Sit in, stand by the bar, or grab a seat in the backyard (a midtown rarity) and sip your cocktails whilst enjoying some civilized, relaxing conversation. 

Anyways tops my list of city speak easy for the beverage selection and atmosphere.  A bit pricey (aren&#39;t they all?), but if you nurse your drink correctly, you can easily have two over the span of an hour and walk out without much of a dent in your wallet."

As a transplanted New York sports fan, I&#39;m glad I have the option to watch almost any game I want. Big props right there.

It took 4-6 minutes for the server to get to us, but she was friendly enough. The size of the drink glasses were tall, which is a big deal for me at a sports bar. For the food, we started with the spinach artichoke dip. It was really creamy, a little more yellow than what I would expect. Very creamy and served with tri-color tortilla chips. I would usually prefer toasted bread or pita, something more chewy, but it worked well enough. If nothing else, the presentation was nice with the array of colors.

I went for the Flat Iron steak sandwich. It came on a hoagie roll with crispy fried onions and sauteed mushrooms along with a side of Cabernet sauce. I was very impressed with the tenderness of the meat. And the combo of the red wine in the sauce and mushrooms was just tremendous. The onions provide that nice crunch, so I got a nice variety of tastes and flavors. The sandwich came with a mountain of French fries that were well seasoned with a Lawry&#39;s type taste to them. And we had certain requests like ranch dressing, honey mustard, our third drink refill, etc and the staff responded quite promptly to all of them.

There aren&#39;t too many sit-down places in that Stratford Square area that deliver the goods in terms of both taste and atmosphere. Anyway&#39;s is a fine exception, I am happy to say."

Who is Anyway? Is this his or her restaurant? No? I rather thought not.

But bad punctuation aside (and sadly, yes, this is how it appears on the building), Anyway[&#39;]s is a solid upscale sports bar-type eatery.

We came on New Year&#39;s Eve - fairly early - and half expected to wait awhile, but we were seated right away. The interior is very nice, with rich, warm wood, a couple of fireplaces and comfy seating. And lots of flat-panel TVs for whatever game is on.

The menu is decently varied and I had a hard time deciding, but I went with one of the specials, a turkey melt on ciabatta with havarti and spring greens. And in true M. family fashion, we started with nachos.

The nachos were solid, not fantastic but good enough to get them again. Tons of cheese (some of it not-quite melted), a little skimpy on the refried beans, decent guacamole, good salsa, plenty of ground beef. 

My sandwich was very good; the only mild disappointment was that the turkey appeared to be processed deli-cut, as opposed to nice pieces of a roasted turkey (like Thanksgiving leftovers). But the bread was quite good, the pesto mayo and havarti delicious. The fries were solid. 

Service was friendly and competent, no problems there.

Next time I&#39;d like to try something different on their vast menu, but I was definitely pleased enough that I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back.

Edit: We came back, just over a month later -- and I must say, the mac &amp; cheese (with tomato, bacon, onion and a garlicky-crumb crust) is AWESOME. I make some good mac &amp; cheese, and this blew mine away. Carb-o-licious heaven."

Most recently I went to Anyway&#39;s on a Thursday around 6:30 PM and found a packed parking lot. Gotta be doing something right if you can pack &#39;em in on a weeknight.

Though I don&#39;t drink too very often, the $4 Martini specials Thursday night were enticing enough for me to try before eating dinner. My drink was not too heavy on the alcohol, which is what I prefer. The Tequila Lime Chicken I ordered was quite moist and tender, served over cilantro lime rice and black beans. The beans were excellent! So good that I asked my server what they added to the black beans to make them taste so good. (Made with chicken broth and cumin.)

Of course, I had to have dessert since cinnamon ice cream was on the menu... one of my all-time favorite flavors! Two moderate scoops with a drizzle of caramel, whipped cream and a cherry on top were the perfect size for after dinner, unlike the monster desserts that you usually get and can rarely finish.

I did have the apple crisp another time, which (if I remember right) was heavy on the apples, not enough &#34;crisp&#34; topping, could use more ice cream, and quite messy on the caramel sauce. It was okay, but I probably won&#39;t order that dessert again.

All in all, Anyway&#39;s is a great option to the other chain restaurants on the block. Nice decor, decent lounge / bar area with flat screens TV&#39;s all around, separate dining area that&#39;s not as loud as the lounge, friendly service, and pretty good food.

The Lincoln Park Salad for me, the chicken nachos for the Hubs. 
The salad was very fresh. Various kinds of lettuce leaves, granny smith apples, cranberries and blue cheese crumbles. Quite large for one person. The poppy seed vinaigrette was very tasty and tangy and sweet. I didn&#39;t care for the nachos--the chicken was very dry--almost crumbly. The cheese was ok. The nacho chips were the tastiest part of that dish. 

I like this location better than the Oak Brook Terrace location because this one is more spacious, has a better layout and the staff is very friendly. Same menu, same drink specials. More flat screens and a larger and sleeker bar. Great place to watch a game and enjoy a drink."

The first time I was here I had the chili and a freakishly delicious &#34;Owners Burger&#34;. I came back a second time two months later to see if it was a fluke... nope. It&#39;s a nicely sized, juicy burger cooked just the way I asked both times (once medium, once medium- well). The fries while not as great as the burgers were better than average.

My daughter really enjoyed her bbq pork sandwich and we both had a loaded potato soup which was fine. But again, the burger; food is obviously a matter of taste, but I&#39;m telling you this burger is perfect - charred on the outside, juicy and delicious. The havrati or whatever cheese and onions they add to it match up perfectly. I know burgers and have had them at many of the critically acclaimed &#34;best burger&#34; places in Chicago and the suburbs, this one is the best I&#39;ve had.

Service was good, place seemed clean. I&#39;ll need to eat other things to give Anyways a perfect review and I will...if I can ever get past that burger."

But sadly it was probably the worst day to come. It was chaotic. But that&#39;s not their fault. The rest of the visit is why they are only getting two stars and why I&#39;ll only be back for carry out. 

So we got there around 8:15ish we waited for a booth for about 30 minutes, which was fine. When we were sat is where the trouble began. We had a new waiter, or so he told us. We sat at our table for 20 minutes waiting for him to come and greet us, we didn&#39;t have a drink menu at our table either. When he gave us the menu I decided what Margarita I wanted immediately but my friend was torn and he said he&#39;d put mine in but he warned there was a LONG wait. He really emphasized that. So we also asked for water in the mean time. This was about 8:50. I got my margarita by 9:05...fifteen minutes wasn&#39;t that bad. On a regular night sometimes that&#39;s how long it takes. He made it seem like 30+ minutes. Alas I asked for sugar on my rim and it was delivered with salt...luckily there was a straw.  And my blue island margarita wasn&#39;t worth the $11.95. 

My friend wasn&#39;t sure what she wanted when I ordered so our waiter left us there. We were waiting for our other friend to come join us after she left work at 9:30. I called her because eventually 9:30 had rolled around to tell her what they had margarita wise and had her pick since I was hoping he&#39;d be back before she got there. She arrived and he had only said &#34;I will be right with you guys.&#34; twice to us but was taking care of everyone else around us. This was probably 9:45. We didn&#39;t get our water either. I also thought it was odd they didn&#39;t offer chips on the table like most Mexican restaurants do, well...until they were brought to us when our food was. 

I know this sounds like an obnoxious rant but I need to tell you that the steak fajita quesadilla was absolutely delicious. This is why it gets two stars instead of one. 
That I will be back for to take home with me. 

I would love to give some friendly feedback to management and have your servers learn a little better time management. I know cinco de mayo can be a stressful day, but thriving under pressure is what really impresses people. And please let your chef know that their food is amazing."

Unfortunately, the food was subpar. The guacamole was good (no way you can go wrong with that), but the carne asada was not worth it for the price. I have tried carne asada dishes from other Mexican restaurants that were better quality and looked more appetizing than the one served here.

The service was even worse. Our server wasn&#39;t very prompt in making sure that our needs were met. For example, it took our server 10 minutes from the time we asked someone to bring us tortillas. By the time our tortillas were served, we were practically finished with our meal. 

Unfortunately, i was disappointed by both food and service here, as I had high hopes for this place that looked so appealing from the outside. Would not recommend"

 My friend and I visited this place, ordered a drink that was supposed to be a mojito but I am pretty sure it was just club soda with mint leaves in it. 
 We got our check signed our receipt and went on our way. The next day I noticed they double charged me, so I contact Casa and ask for a manager. After being put on hold for 10min without anyone coming back on the line with an update I finally had to hang up and call back. I finally get the manager on the line, he rudely did not let me finish my sentences and said that if I wanted anything done then I would have to come back in with the receipt. I told him it was out of my way about 30min and he responded with &#34;well are you coming or not?!&#34;
 So rude!! I make my way there where he walked up to me without any sign of an apology, hands in his pockets and the most sour face. He asked for my bank statement to prove they charged me another amount that was on my receipt. 
 He brought over his records said &#34; I don&#39;t know what to tell you, call your bank&#34; and then he just walked away. I said ok well thank you and he said yep no problem
 Bottom line....so rude! The place does not smell like Mexican food but of dirty mop water! Stay away!"

I just ate here for the first time.  

The restaurant is generally nice and colorful with fiesta-like decor.  The service was acceptable.

Beyond those things, I don&#39;t really have anything positive to say.  The food itself is what mostly determines whether I will return to a restaurant and Casa Margarita&#39;s stuff just wasn&#39;t very good.

This place is incompetent when it comes to proper consistency of salsa and queso.  

The salsa was red-colored water with oversized chunks of tomato in it. The taste wasn&#39;t the worst I&#39;ve ever had, but salsa is supposed to be able to stay on a chip as you raise it to your mouth.  Instead, liquid ran off the chips onto my hands and tomato pieces tumbled onto the table.  To add to the misery, the chips weren&#39;t very tasty.  They didn&#39;t seem to be homemade and were very Tostito&#39;s-ish.  Strike one!

The consistency problem continued with the queso &amp; chips appetizer.  The queso was white rather than yellow and tasted quite good, but like the salsa it was super runny - so much so that I couldn&#39;t even get a chip to my mouth without leaving messy drips of cheese all over the table.  Strike two!  That&#39;s too bad considering the queso would have been delicious had it been at the proper consistency (and with better chips to go with it).

For my entree, I had the &#34;Fiesta Enchiladas&#34; which is 3 enchiladas with your choice of filling (ground beef, shredded beef, chicken, or pork) topped with red sauce, mole sauce, and verde/green sauce.  Like typical Mexican joints, you get rice and beans with it.

The taste was seriously lacking in the food despite a decent appearance. 

One of the enchiladas was chicken and the meat was barely seasoned.  It had probably only 1/10th the flavor of something like Chipotle&#39;s chicken and it wasn&#39;t all white meat either, but rather a mix of dark and white meat. That&#39;s substandard to me considering chicken enchiladas in the typical Tex-Mex restaurant are all white meat these days.  

Same goes for the shredded beef I had in the other enchiladas on the plate.  The beef was mostly unseasoned and didn&#39;t have the nice flavor I was looking for that I can get at other places like Pepe&#39;s, On The Border, Uncle Julio&#39;s, and even Chipotle.  Chipotle&#39;s barbacoa was way tastier than the shredded beef at Casa Margarita.  

The sauces weren&#39;t very tasty either.  I didn&#39;t get any tingling on my lips from peppery spices and my eyebrows never perked up.  It was &#34;Meh&#34; through the whole dinner.

Strike 3, game over.  

Food = 1 star

Service = 3 stars

2 stars total - I wouldn&#39;t bother coming here with numerous tastier competitors in the area."

But not tonight everything was on and working! I would suggest different chairs for their outside the low top chairs you feel like you can&#39;t sit up. The high top tables I noticed a few people moving cause they were either too uncomfortable or their butts didn&#39;t fit into the seat?? We had the chips and guacamole which I wouldn&#39;t recommend!! Go to Mago if you truly want freshly made guacamole that has tremendous flavor! This guacamole had absolutely no flavor! There was no salt on our table or we would have grabbed for that! Their chips taste like cardboard. No salt or anything!But everything else is great! A few tweaks to get things right!?

The food is good and the price is reasonable. Unfortunately the service level has severely diminished over the past 6 months, and it culminated into last Friday I guess. 

We have had bad experiences in the past. The hostesses at the front desk being rude. Cutlery not coming and having to get up and get it ourselves from the service area. Things like this. But the food is always good. 

Last Friday I went with friends visiting from another country. First time to get together in years. The service this night was fucking horrible. Please excuse the language but I have no words. I cannot tell you how slow. They were not that busy. But we waited for almost 2 hours to be served. During the wait time the server forgot to bring drinks we had ordered, several times. When I told the server that we were going to leave because it was too slow she quickly brought our food. But the food was wrong. And I don&#39;t mean wrong in regards to what we ordered it was wrong in respect to the way it always is. Quesadilla with no toppings. Carne Asada with no rice or beans. Really inconsistent stuff. And again our server was oblivious. She had no idea it was wrong. All she did why I complained was complain back. She said the kitchen tossed out order in the trash and she had to get them to do it again. She complained about the kitchen constantly messing with her, as they don&#39;t get along. Crap like this. We waited for so long it was 930 at night and the three children under 10 were hungry and should have rated earlier. All we wanted was to eat. I don&#39;t need to hear the servers troubles. All we need is out order to come. 

In the end she brought her manager who gave us 25% off our bill. That was pretty weak. I would have expected more as we had been in the restaurant maybe 20 or 25 times in the past couple of years. I was so disappointed. But it took it and left. The only tip that I left was &#34;first rule of service : never let the customers know your problems&#34; written neatly on the bill. In lesser places they would have offered more. 

I love this place but won&#39;t be back for a while if ever. My disappointment was just too great in his last experience."

Atmosphere is definitely pleasant enough - your basic chain Mexican place.  There were multiple hostesses to greet us as we entered, all extremely pleasant and welcoming.  Then our server was a gem, very attentive to our needs. 

The menu was pretty standard, having the typical slate of entrees and combination dinners.  After ordering our food, delivery was quick to follow.  This may have been an indication of what was to come. 

It looked appetizing, but the taste was rather bland, like it was prepared well in advance and in mass quantities.  I wouldn&#39;t say it tasted bad, it just didn&#39;t leave me wanting for more.

I&#39;m giving this place a two star because I added a star for the service. If the service was meh it would be one star. 

Came here during the week around 8ish. Hostess was super friendly who seated us right away, waitress who was also very nice and friendly did a wonderful job, came up to the table right away asked us if we wanted drinks etc. nothing against the service, it was wonderful. 

But the food is another story... Their Queso Fundido appetizer is what we started with, and it came to our table within one minute after the order was placed. It was lukewarm and extremely runny. I doubt that it was chihuahua cheese. Their chips were ok and salsa tasted generic store bought. No way they make that in house. My entree Fiesta Enchiladas, I decided to go with all three sauces, red, green, and mole; each sauce was more disappointing and very bland. Also my cheese enchilada didn&#39;t have any cheese in it. Seriously, I&#39;m not kidding about this. 
My brother had steak dinner with chile relleno and his steak tasted old and it was chewy. Relleno had hardly any cheese in it. 
Also there is NO WAY that they make their beans, tasted like they came out straight out of a can. I can make better canned beans than this place. 

Flan was delicious though. That was the only thing that I enjoyed.

We did not have reservations and there was a little bit of a wait, which is understandable. The hostess at the front desk seemed extremely unorganized.

We were given complimentary salsa, which is extremely watered down. My mango margarita was loaded with sugar/mix and I couldn&#39;t taste any alcohol.

Our server was not very professional and it seemed like either: she has never done this before, or she has no people skills. 

The food. If you could open a can of beans and throw them in the micro with some instant rice - this was our side. The food was WARM and did not have much flavor.

Our server was very pleasant, but when the best part of the meal was paying and leaving, there are more than a few kinks to work out.  Unfortunately, there was nothing of note that will get me to come back and see if things have improved.

First off, there are no prices on the drink menu.  My sub-par pina colada ($7.95) was served in a warm glass, and mostly contained an undrinkable froth.  We started out with queso chorizo.  It was very soupy, even after letting it set and cool for a bit, and missed the mark when it came to flavor.  My main entrée was grilled fish tacos.  First bite had me wondering if they borrowed the fish from the buffet line at the neighboring Chinese buffet.  Not a bit of Mexican flair, chewy, rubbery, and just not good in any way.  My meal included two, but I only managed one."

Armed with a Local Flavors deal (buy $15 food-get $30), we slid into a booth around 8:30 on a Wednesday night. 
The salsa was pathetic, weak and runny with no substance. Seeing this is the first thing your public usually has at a Mexican restaurant,  you would think you would like to make a better impression. Chips were ok.
Ordered drinks and Carne Asada dinners, both cooked rare. The steak was done perfectly but the rice was once again bland and the beans were runny and cold.

Well, some friends of mine who have eaten there insisted it was not bad so a bunch of us went out for dinner there last weekend. I have to admit the food was decent and I had one of the best mango margarita&#39;s I have ever had in my life. The service was very good as well and we had a large party of about 10 people. They have a very large bar and very large dining room, they had no problem accommodating our party of 10 on a Saturday evening, we simply phoned ahead about 30 minutes before our arrival. I would give the food 3.5 stars, service was a 5 and my margarita was a 5 so that&#39;s how I came to my 4 star rating. If you look at my reviews I have eaten at a lot of Mexican places all over the country, you will also notice I ma not afraid to give 1 and 2 star ratings. Casa margarita is not my favorite Mexican place but it is by far not badt. I will go back again for sure! Give it a try and see for yourself."

The biggest knock against them is the service is often sub-par.  Also, one of the best ways to judge a mexican restaurant is by their chips and salsa. Theirs are just ok. The salsa is runny. I&#39;d try it out if you haven&#39;t tand see for yourself."

Reasonably priced food and drinks. The wait staff is very attentive and the hostesses and waitresses are all VERY attractive! Maria was great with making recommendations and even helping to entertain our little one. The kitchen is very well run because it seemed like even on a Saturday night they were churning out orders like it&#39;s.......Oh, right. Nevertheless, everything comes out pretty quickly and the pace of the meal was appropriate for us. We will most definitely be back. 

And they are building an outside patio with 2 in ground fire pits for this summer so come on out and give it a try!"

First: my family of 6 waited 20 minutes to be seated at 3:00 on a slow Saturday afternoon. It took 50inutrs from the time we arrived until we had food.  No drink refills in that time span.
We ordered the quesadilla appetizer, quack mole appetizer, 1 tostada, and 1 enchilada.   That&#39;s it!

The food was aversge.  We had to flag our server to ask for salsa....and then again for chips. ...and again for a 2nd beer.

Terrible, slow service.

The vegetarian options are a lie. Their refried beans have lard.  The Spanish rice has chicken stock.  There are no other bean option nor rice options.....not even white rice....which probably means they fo not actually make the Spanish rice themselves....packaged or frozen.

In all we lost about 90 minutes and about $75.00.  Wasteful!!!

Again, do yourself a favor: AVOID"

Good margaritas! The giant one is only like a dollar more than the medium, not bad at all. But it is huge, very hard to finish haha
I&#39;ve sat in the dining room and at the bar and had good experiences at each. I never had to wait long or at all for a table and my service was awesome. I never waited for a drink and the food was brought out fast.
I&#39;ve also gotten drinks at the bar with an appetizer that I got for free because I checked in on Yelp! It was very relaxing and the people sitting around us were cool too so I had a good time!
Only complaint was the shots were pricey. I went after a rough day of work and needed a couple shots of tequila and I was a little surprised by the bill but I guess that&#39;s what you pay for quality!
I&#39;d recommend this place. I wouldn&#39;t say there&#39;s anything in particular that makes it stand out but they&#39;ve been very consistent with good service and food and I like it here!"

We went during the week around 5:30 so it was pretty slow.   Our waitress must have been new (Miranda) because she was slow and acted like she never waitressed before. We heard the waitress at the table behind us telling them about different things on the menu, drinks and a hot salsa they were sampling.  We would eavesdrop and then ask our waitress things that she should have told us!  We would ask a question and she would be like, I am not sure (but never go find out the answer).  She was nice, but needs training big time.

We thought the chips, drinks and food were very good. Guacamole excellent. Horchada awesome. We will be back.  It helped that we found a buy 1 get 1 free offer in one of the local coupon clipper magazines.  

My suggestion is for them to have a meal plan for kids that includes a drink.  My 6-year old daughter&#39;s, non-refillable, apple juice was $2.95 and not included in her $6.00 meal.  A bit pricey I would say. Most restaurant kids meals include a drink in the price."

My fiance and i love Mexican food.  However,  I don&#39;t think I have ever had worse Mexican food,  even from a hole-in-the-wall fast food place. 

First, we got margaritas. They are not made,  they are dispensed out of a tap and made from sour mix. For a restaurant named after the drink,  we were definitely expecting something fresher and better. 

Then we looked at the menu.  We order two Appetizers,  which honestly weren&#39;t that bad - at least the guacamole tasted fairly fresh.  We ordered the chicken mole and Asada y relleno, which were $14.99 and $17.99, respectively.  For that price,  we expected good food. The chicken was tender,  but the mole was not great. The steak was obviously steamed and rubbery,  and horribly overcooked,  and the chile tasted of freezer burn. I had one bite and couldn&#39;t eat any more.  I could go on, but in short there are many other great Mexican places near by that I will be going to instead. 

To be honest - the only reason I gave this place one star I&#39;d because our server was very nice and attentive. It wasn&#39;t her fault the food sucked."

Their customer service needs improvement. We waited 15 minutes before the server came to take our order. The restaurant was empty, so no excuse to wait so long. The server gave us utensils for two people even though we were a party of four. I had to ask for extra utensils. Then plates for our queso fundido not enough for 4 people, only 2. 

The women&#39;s washroom was FILTHY. It looked like it had not been cleaned for days. The toilets were disgusting, so I cannot imagine how the kitchen is being kept.

I wouldn&#39;t say the food is great or that the staff goes above and beyond. This place is just pretty much average.

The decor is pretty wild but gives the place character, which is fun. There are some great conversations pieces here. Like I said before the food is just average. I haven&#39;t had anything I absolutely loved. There are like a million people working at once. We have been here probably 7-10 times and I can&#39;t remember ever seeing the same staff member twice.  I do enjoy their margaritas. There are a few different sizes depending on how tipsy you&#39;d like to get!!

On another good note they are just finalizing a patio which looks pretty nice. I&#39;ll be happy to see it finished with furniture and more importantly, people.

Me and the unknown got the quesadilla dinner (steak). My refried beast literally came as beans, everyone else&#39;s came all jazzed up with the shreds of cheese. I asked for mine to be fixed, the waitress says, oh I guess they didn&#39;t feel like doing it. 
O.o
Brings it back. Cool. I let it slide. Now. My familiar friend says we HAVE to get The Flight. 5 mini margaritas with different flavors all for you! but when I saw the piña colada, I asked to just change it to blue. I just don&#39;t like the flavor. You would have thought I told her the sky was falling. She goes to the bar (we were seated next to it) and as they made all of the flights, the 2 bartenders and waitress kept looking over at me with irritation. She comes back with all made including my double blue and says, next time, we&#39;ll have to charge you for that. 
O.O
REALLY??? I was going to tell her to charge me for it now. They made such a fuss about it, you are already making blue, will you die if you make another?

My dinner experience last night was polar opposite to my luncheon experience last week.  I am keeping in mind that it was Cinco de Mayo yesterday so the wait of 30 minutes did not influence this review.  First, we waited at the bar with a couple of jumbo frozen margaritas which were very good. I enjoyed my margarita swirled with sangria. The problem was we sat at the bar and had to stare down a bartender to even get an acknowledgment. Once we placed our drink order, it appeared quickly, but the chips and salsa the bartender asked if we wanted didn&#39;t show up for 15 minutes until we reminded her. Next, we were seated at a four top table in the bar tucked in a corner. I had no problem with the location, but sensed that we would not be seen. I was right!  I asked twice for a server.  Finally, Esmeralda came and took our order and refilled our salsa and chips.  My husband ordered the chicken fajitas which were plentiful and yummy. I ordered the fiesta enchiladas which was three different enchiladas that were served with different sauces. I chose cheese, chicken, and spinach.  The spinach enchilada I had previously last week came filled with spinach, mushroom, onions and tomatoes just as described on the menu.  The spinach enchilada that appeared on my plate last night was filled with large pieces of green and red pepper and a couple of leaves of spinach. I brought this to the attention of our waitress and she went to the kitchen to get a new enchilada. By time she came back, both my husband and I were finished with dinner so I took it to go. Upon inspection, this 2nd enchilada was filled with green and red peppers and steak!! This spinach enchilada did not even come close to the description on the menu.  This was a very disappointing dining experience. I am giving it two stars for the good frozen margaritas and my husband&#39;s fajitas...taking away points for not being acknowledged, lack of service, and getting a spinach enchilada wrong...twice. Casa Margarita you failed me. By the way, we we&#39;re not allowed to use our Yelp check-in free appetizer on Cinco de Mayo. What?!"

We signed up for the free entree email which would come in handy if this restaurant actually had good food. I saw my latest email for a free entree and we set off once again to eat dinner at Casa Margarita. We get our dinner and I notice right away my chili relleno was soaked!!!! In grease. Not just , this has been fried and so a little grease is there, this was a soggy, inedible food substance. It was so greasy it had managed to get my rice, beans and quesadilla greasy as well. It smelled like old fryer grease. I swear it looked as if this relleno was made a week ago put in the Frige and then nuked to death before serving it to me. AWEFUL!!!! The only reason I decided not to complain was my meal was already going to be free because of our coupon. Folks, there is a reason a Mexican food restaurant has to send out weekly free entree coupons in order to get people in to eat this sickening cuisine.

We were so excited to see they put outside seating in. We got to the restaurant around 6:30PM and asked to be seated outside. The host informed us for 3 it would be about 30-35 minutes. We understood the wait as they are always short staffed, and didn&#39;t mind waiting, it&#39;s Friday night we get it. Fast forward to 7:00 I asked the host about how much longer did she think it would be before we were seated. She said that we were next for outside and that we would be seated next. I asked her about how much longer did she think, she stated that she didn&#39;t know and would have to check with her &#34;manager&#34; since he&#39;s running the outside. Worked for me, I&#39;m not super impatient, and have worked in the restaurant business before for 4 years as a host and a server, I understand things get crazy. My family and I continued to wait. We observed the manager saying hello and hugging his regular customers / people He knew etc etc. My hope was for the host to communicate with her manager to get an idea as to how long we would be waiting... but sadly this didn&#39;t happen. We had been standing basically next to the host stand for an hour! ( after being quoted 35 minutes mind you) so I politely went up and asked again, the manager stated that we were next and would be seated when a table opened. I asked if he had an idea and he said that we would be seated outside when one came available. &#34;So 5-10 minutes I asked?&#34; &#34;It could be..&#34; he replied. It could be? This is who&#39;s running the restaurant? Even when I use to host i&#39;d never say it could be! I&#39;d go out check to see where people were at within their meal and re-quote the customer. At this point I was annoyed and set a timer on my watch to wait the 10 minutes, After that I&#39;d just ask to sit anywhere, we waited this long already! 5 minutes later they call my family and I and seat us inside at a corner booth next to the door to go outside . . .   What?! Are you kidding me? We didn&#39;t ask you to seat us inside, we didn&#39;t tell you we wanted to sit inside we said OUTSIDE about 3 times now. We walked out! I&#39;m Sorry! In all my years eating out i&#39;ve never went some place so unprofessional. My dad went up to the owner and asked why they would seat us inside after we requested outside! The owner replied &#34;Oh, you wanted to sit outside? Are you kidding me!? This place is a joke, I liked going here a lot, but will travel some place else moving forward. Please get your act together, you can&#39;t afford to loose any business as this specific building as already had 3 different restaurants open within it."

There was a reason so much time passed between visits, and it&#39;s the same reason why we won&#39;t be back.  Service both times was glacially slow, both times for lunch on a weekend, but neither time during a crowded restaurant.  The complimentary salsa was rather bland and this last time, the chips were extremely stale.  Between our two visits, we&#39;ve tried enchiladas, tacos and burritos, and all were very lifeless and bland, with no real flavor.  Slow service combined with bland food seems to be a recipe for disaster, and it has me wondering what the next restaurant will be when Casa Margarita closes up.  I will say, I like the decor, the restaurant was clean and the servers were extremely friendly.  But that&#39;s not enough reason to come back."

Went for lunch and there were about 4 other tables being served, it took a while to see a server and get our food. Can&#39;t imagine if it were busy. I could easily overlook that if the food was good but it truly was some of the worst Mexican food I have ever had.  On a positive note I will say their margaritas were good, but I don&#39;t know if you could drink enough of them to make the food good."

I was so excited to try this place out with my husband, but was greatly disappointed the moment we entered the doors.
No one was there to sit us, so we took a seat at the bar instead. The bartender was looking at some papers and never raised her head to greet us. First words out of her mouth were, &#34;Do you need menus?&#34; We looked at the menus for about 3 minutes, they have a good variety of Mexican food. My husband ordered the shrimp cocktail and I ordered the tamale, enchilada, and taco combination plate with a mango margarita. The bartender entered our order in the register, brought the chips and salsas and then assisted another customer. Literally 5 minutes later, she brought a draft beer for my husband, meanwhile I struggle to swallow all the chips I ate without a drink. Since she went back to attend to the other customer, I decided to ask another waiter for water. 3 minutes later, she made my drink. The margarita was strong and tasty, but far from the best I&#39;ve had. 
Our food arrived, and my order was wrong. Instead of apologizing and just making the correct order, the bartender tells me that she rung up the order correctly but the kitchen got it wrong. How unprofessional. My correct order arrives, but it didn&#39;t matter because it was pretty gross. Chicken enchilada were buried under a tasteless red sauce and so were the tamales. I sure wish she would&#39;ve given me a choice of green or red sauce because it was disgusting. And although I kept that comment to myself, the bartender response was, that&#39;s how they make them here. (They should state that in the menu!) Bottom line is that my food was horrid, and she knew I didn&#39;t enjoy it the moment I traded plates with my husband. His shrimp cocktail was pretty darn good though! 
I felt that I overpaid for horrible service and subpar food. Paid a $38 bill and left her $0 tip. Maybe next time she will learn to provide better service.

Don&#39;t waste your money here! Go to Pepes further south on Weber Rd."

With that said, we visited at 5pm on a Friday night with a party of 2.  We waited a little under 1/2 hour to be seated even though they were only using half the available tables in the restaurant, apparently due to being under staffed.  They told us 45 minutes to 1 hour, which made many others turn around and leave.

The staff was very friendly,  and our server, Carlos was very nice and attentive.  The wait staff was working hard and all were friendly and attentive as well.

Before the food arrived, we were served chips &amp; salsa, which was ok.  Then soup came. The soup was good.  I had a steak burrito which was excellent - I fully recommend the steak.  The sides were tasteful. 

Overall,  the food was good, not necessarily great, however this place is worth a try.

In order to survive,  this place needs to get staffed.  They turned away at least 20 hungry guests just during the half hour I was waiting to be seated.  Imagine how much business they lost - and maybe for good.

  If you decide to try, come with 1-2 hours to spend."

Considering the patio was empty, and the restaurant was not busy, I would expect to be seated immediately. After being told they were &#34;preparing&#34; our table, and waiting almost 20 minutes to be seated, we decided to leave. The staff was totally indifferent (including a manager) when we told them we were not willing to wait any longer.

My husband and I really enjoy Mexican food, but this food doesn&#39;t taste authentic at all - bland and barely seasoned.  The tamale had a hint of sweetness to it, which made it virtually inedible for me. The meat in the taco was unseasoned. I didn&#39;t even bother with the enchilada. There was an older lady serving our table, and it just felt like she would have rather been doing anything else in the world than that. She was extremely apathetic - not friendly at all - borderline rude. There was a young man who clears the tables, and continually walked around swinging a dish cloth - really?!?!?!

I absolutely love the atmosphere as it has very bright and festive decor, and it is always very busy. We had a slight wait last night but considering how many people were there, that was to be expected. 

Our waitress was outstanding. Very friendly and provided us with excellent service the entire evening. They are of course known for their gigantic magaritas of all different kinds, hence the name Casa Margarita, but I stuck with water. 

I ordered the burrito suizo for $11.99 which is a burrito the size of a child, stuffed with your choice of meat, rice, beans, lettuce, tomato, and covered with cheese and a ranchero sauce. It also comes with rice and beans. Absolutely delicious!! My husband ordered the pork tamales for $10.99. It comes with three large tamales, rice and beans. He loved his meal as well and was nearly licking his plate by the end of our dinner.

We didn&#39;t order dessert, but they still bring every table four large tortilla chips that have been fried and covered in brown sugar and chocolate sauce. I thought that was pretty cool!! Overall, really great place with great service and great prices. I will definitely be back!"

Sent one of the margaritas back and it tasted just as bad as the first.  The chicken tacos came with dark meat (at least that&#39;s what the owner told us it was) They were coated in chunks of fat and were rubbery.  The chicken fajitas consisted of seasoning with a little processed chicken underneath.  Horrible Horrible food and drinks!

When I first walked in I was immediately turned off and concerned by the crappy bright colors all over that almost made my eyes hurt.    All these blinding flourescent type colors that reminded me of a sugary child&#39;s birthday cake!  So what is goes great with Margaritas?  Mexican seafood goes great, right?  Well their Mexican seafood menu is really small, so I felt a sense of doom right there and then.  A tropical themed place with no real seafood menu is a recipe for disaster.
Well I then deduced that this was just a regular Mexican restaurant with a bad paint job from hell, so I just decided to keep it simple and I ordered the very expensive burrito dinner for $10.99.  They did boast in the menu that the burrito is big.  The chips and salsa came out first.  Just from looking at the chips I knew instantly they were store bought, then when tasting them......yup they were store bought. The salsa was alright had a nice kick.
I got the burrito dinner and it was quite large in size, and because of the large size I had difficulty keeping it together and it fell apart in my hands making a big mess, I guess I should get used to handling a large burrito like this, silly me.  Well I bit in and I was pissed right away that I found damn rice shoved in there......dammit....what is this Taco Bell!?  The worst part about it is the rice blows ass here, just boring rice and nothing good, and this crap was jammed into my burrito.  I am so grateful I requested no beans on this giant piece of crap because the beans that were on the side tasted like someone pissed in them.  Tasted like generic beans with a tart taste that makes me think the cooks were mad and decided to wizz into the bean supply....blah!  One bite of the beans is all I took, my friend&#39;s beans tasted the same, so not a bad batch for me, it&#39;s just gross in general.  Generic refried beans generally taste like someone pissed in them, so I can conclude these are generic and probably stored in the back in giant cans after being brought in on a truck. 
The burrito I ordered was a steak burrito, now the steak was tender and cooked correctly; however, the cut of meat they use is kinda gamey and generic, I could tell by the taste.....blah!  What did they use.....Kroger steaks??!!  I was also pissed that I got a tiny blob of Guac and sour cream, what the hell!  This tiny amount for a burrito this size......I call bullshit on that!  Blah!  I will never return here, just another generic Mexican restaurant in the suburbs and in a town with crappy Mexican food, no wonder why they make it here!  Smh!"

Either the food has changed, my taste buds have matured, or I&#39;ve been spoiled by better mexican food in the area because the food here is not very good or flavorful. We went here on a whim and partly for nostalgia. Bad call.

So many other establishments to go for better mexican food and drinks. If you want a super sweet margarita, over the top paint colors, and some nachos this is your place; otherwise I would frequent other establshments first."

I&#39;m going to have to give it a solid meh. The food is not great, it&#39;s pretty expensive, and the drinks are really not good.

The first time we went it was an early dinner. I had the camarones de diablo. Very, very hot. Muy calente. The shrimp come in a tasty red sauce. It&#39;s very good, except the tails are still on. You have to dip you fingers in the sauce and get it all over you to get the tails off the damn skrimps. No bueno. I ordered a corona and got a corona light. Also no bueno. The waitress was sure to tell us &#34; if you need anything, just wave me over.&#34; That would be cool, except she was never in eyesight. The guacamole is OK. Not great. Very expensive for the amount you get. Salsa is good, but thin.

We went again tonight with a bunch of friends. Service was better. Food was worse. I had chicken fajitas. Advertised as a specialty of the house. Had better at Taco Bell. We joked about calling the waitress out on the scale of the lime in the picture of the guacamole in the menu to an actual lime. The lime in the menu would have to be the size of an m&amp;m to fit in the bowl. I had a flight of margaritas. They were all syrupy as Hell. Just sugar and tequila. There was blue and nasty, red and nasty, orange and nasty and rainbow nasty.

All in all I&#39;m happy that this place is packed with an hour plus wait every night and the awesome Mexican diner across the street is still pretty unknown. Ya&#39;ll just keep dropping $200 on meh food and syrup and tequila and I&#39;ll be chowing on $5 fish taco platters without the fancy decor and accordion music.

The wait staff is very friendly.  I am only giving it 2 stars because of the manager who is terrible.  We joined their &#34;email club&#34; they have which sends you a promo every week. The promo tells you to click on the code which is non-existent but does say you can show it to your server. The server can&#39;t do anything - only the manager.  When the manager came to table - he said it was my phone. Really? Then, he wouldn&#39;t honor the coupon. This happened two times - and the same manager was rude each time.  If you plan on using the coupon code on your phone - forget it. He will just blame you and make you feel stupid versus trying to help you figure it out. And - it&#39;s on their end - not mine. I have never had issues with any other coupons on a phone - except here - and worse yet - to have a manager who doesn&#39;t believe in customer service is very disappointing.

Our  server was VERY sweet. She did forget to bring more chips (but once again...free, so no complaining), but there was a lot going on tonight so I understand. She kept checking on us which is really important to me.

Why did we go 3 Rd time had a buy one get one but it was a fraud as we saw when we got there can&#39;t use coupon. Sweetest day not really a holiday. No where in coupon ANY exclusions. Much better Mexican in area.

I keep giving this place a chance and it goes from bad to worse! Their food is horrible. It started off just bland and now they serve you chicken that looks like it has been reheated in the microwave several times before. They should have invested their money in quality meats and ingredients and stayed away from the top notch patio. No one is going to sit out there to eat microwaved chicken! Duh. I&#39;m not even going to start with the waitress we had. For me, bring me the edible version of the food I&#39;m paying good money to eat and I could care less who brings it to my table.  This time, never again for sure."

The first was the day after it opened, we were told we&#39;d have to wait to be seated even though the place was empty. I requested to sit at the bar. The bartender was attentive and the drinks were good.

We decided to order food, because they never called our name to sit at a table. The bartender put in the order, and an hour later no food. The manager came around later and said the ticket got printed out somewhere else, and the kitchen never got the order, and they would work on it right away. At the same time more people were coming in, it was around 2 and they were being told the kitchen is closed. That seemed odd to me since our food was still not out.

Our food did come out, and the carna asada was very good, I got the camarones a la diabla and it was not good, it was spicy yes, but no real flavor and the sides were not complimenting the dish at all (mostly lettuce), plus the portion was inadequate for the price (maybe 10 shrimp for $16). After nearly 3 hours we were finally able to leave. It was a bad experience, but I blame the rushed opening and so I did not hold it against them. The manager did give us a $15 gift card for the next visit.

6/27/2014 - The restaurant has been open for about a month and a half, so we decide it&#39;s time to try it again. We get there and the place is packed, all the tables are taken. We wait for a reasonable amount of time and seated.

The waitress comes, and takes our drink and appetizer order. 10 minutes later she comes back with the drinks, no appetizer, and no chips. At this my wife requests chips and salsa, which should have been brought over when she introduced herself. The waitress realizes her mistake and says it will be coming up. 15 minutes later the appetizer arrives, again no chips. And again my wife has to ask.

So now we&#39;re 45 minutes in we&#39;ve gotten the chips and salsa and our food arrives. We ordered the same things as before. Again my camarones a la diabla has the same problems, so now I know it&#39;s the recipe. The carna asada was good, but cooked well done, when medium rare was requested. We request it be redone. They take the steaks off our plates (who does that) and 10 minutes later we are presented with fully plated steaks that are cooked well, but have no flavor.

We never got our tortillas, and the first time we got soup right away, this time nothing.

This whole time I&#39;m sitting with an empty glass of water, and my wife&#39;s margarita is also empty. Did the waitress ask about refills? Not until we were done.

I would avoid this place for now."

I would have given 5 starts but the chips could have been better-- they tasted store bought and weren&#39;t fresh and crispy--then again they were free. Overall, great experience.

This is tucked in the corner right across Yorktown mall ( directly in front of Carson Pirie Scott and JCPenny). Location wise, it&#39;s secluded.  Inside, it&#39;s a little italian deli shop.  Lots of great meats, and various olive oils, their own giardinara and other brand giardinaras.  They have chips, soft drinks, etc.  It&#39;s all there for a good filling lunch.  
Yummy italian sub and awesome turkey and bacon sub.  Small or large order, their prices are cheap.  $4.79 for a sandwich; can&#39;t beat that.
Note: there isn&#39;t seating inside. You can stand up or go outside and eat as they have some tables and chairs set up.  Late afternoon on a weekday, you definitely will have no problem getting a seat.  Not sure about lunchtime.

We ordered two Italian subs, potato salad and fish salad. The fish salad was an abomination. It had huge chunks of imitation crab, a couple of low quality shrimp, and that was about it. They mix the &#34;seafood&#34; with giardiniera. The problem with that is, imitation crab is super sweet so you have this terrible sweet and almost sour conflict going on with each bite. It was hands down horrible and at $10.99 per pound, a true inedible waste of money. The potato tastes like it comes straight from the premise section of the Jewel deli. They just added some shredded carrot to this mix. Another failure but at $2.19 per pound way less offensive. The sandwiches were great and a steal at under $5 a piece. They have a lot of grocery items which was nice and a freezer section of house made delicacies like stuffed wheels, lasagna, assorted soups, etc. I will come back for a sandwich and will try the house made items in the freezer case but I am staying far the heck away from those salads."

My go to is still an American sub, sometimes I get the Italian, but today, today I got the Muffaletta Panini. WOWSERS!!! Why haven&#39;t I gotten this before?! Why didn&#39;t any one tell me?!   :)

Salami, Imported Ham, Provolone, Olive Spread on a Ciabatta bread. Yum!! I believe it&#39;s their home made spread, not sure though, but it had a little bite to it. Like it&#39;s mixed with Giardiniera.  I couldn&#39;t get enough and if they weren&#39;t so bad, I&#39;d get one every day! Needless to say, my boyfriend will be in for a delicious surprise. 

Since my last review in 2009 (man where has the time gone) I&#39;ve gotten quite a few things at Frankie&#39;s; subs, wraps, panini&#39;s, bread, chips, grocery items.  It&#39;s so easy for me to grab a frozen entree for dinner. I usually pick up frozen mostaccioli but for tonight, I got lasagna. 

I&#39;ve been going there for SIX years and the place doesn&#39;t disappoint. Again, very pricey, but I&#39;m not going every day. Plus the quality is good.

You can purchase everything from world class sandwiches, frozen pastas/sauces, imported meats/cheeses, wine, olive oil and the list goes on and on.  I have had every sandwich at one time or another and they are all quality.  The wine selection is good, but you will pay a premium at a specialty location like this.   

It is always busy. Period.  Expect to wait in a line for various amounts of time depending on when you arrive.  They do a good job of staffing, especially during busy times of the week.  The hustle and bustle looks chaotic at first, but after a few moments you will see that it is controlled chaos.  You need to be prepared when someone looks at you and says next, otherwise you may get shuffled to the end of the line.   Kinda stressful the first few times.... but you get used to it.

What I really like about this place is the outdoor seating.  I love going here for lunch doing work, because it is quick and during the summer you can sit outside under the covered tables and take in the fresh air. Since it is in a quite nook in the strip mall behind the mall, there is very little traffic, so it is quiet.

This place is always crowded and the price for subs is great.  All fresh ingredients.  However, I do not like their pasta salads, as their very bland.  I recommend the Italian Sandwich or their Italian Beef.  Again, bring cash! =))"

Frankie&#39;s offers tons of great, nicely varied Italian groceries, and some of the best subs and salads (the Roma, with artichokes and salty capers, is a personal favorite) I&#39;ve had in Chicagoland.

The service is good and bad - you&#39;ll get your sub quickly, but despite being next to Yorktown mall in an extremely busy area, they somehow still justify a $7 credit card minimum. The subs are cheap as well as large, running under $5 even for an 8 in. large sub, so this means that if you don&#39;t have cash, you will need to pick out something extra like a side to make the minimum. The owner, who has been on cashier every time I&#39;ve been there, is notoriously unfriendly - almost everyone I know who&#39;s been there has a story about him, or has at least noticed his apparent genuine antipathy toward his customers.

however, I used to buy some &#34;Italian&#34; groceries from there as well but its kind of overpriced !

The one thing negative about this place is they have a minimum for using a credit card ( $8) and their sandwiches prices are less so you either bring cash or buy something from there until you reach more than $8

The guy ( I guess he is the owner) who at the cashier is really nice but he got this angry look at his face and he reminds me of &#34;the soup episode from Seinfeld&#34; and I cant help laughing! he is a friendly guy though 

Bottom-line: its a nice place for quick lunch at work or even with friends !"

I&#39;ve been here several times over the years, getting sandwiches, groceries, etc. It has all been awesome. So let&#39;s focus on my most recent visit.

I got a large 8&#34; Italian sandwich to go. It was, of course, delicious. All of the meats were great. I spent the extra $0.60 or so for hot peppers which was a very wise addition. I also got a small order of the seafood salad. There are three or four sizes for the multiple salads, and this rather small serving of seafood salad was just over $4. But my gosh...it had hot peppers, other veggies, shrimp, baby octopus, and other stuff. It truly amazed me - FRESH, delicious. Best thing I&#39;ve ever had here. 

Service is friendly. Prices are fair. They accept plastic now, and have an ATM. As I get older, I love this place more. And I loved it as a kid."

Anybody who doesn&#39;t see the value for money here isn&#39;t from the city. Do you KNOW how much you&#39;d pay for a sandwich like this in Chicago?! The Turano bread is perfect, the ingredients are fresh, and the meat is plentiful. There was no wait. I generally dislike mayonnaise, and Frankie&#39;s used just the perfect amount to make me appreciate it.

The store is nice, too. They have the standard jardiniere my dad eats, as well as some fancier oils and such. I&#39;ll definitely browse further when I have more time. I&#39;ll more than likely go back tomorrow while I&#39;m still in town."

I ordered 2 combos and a rice ball. They charged me 6.79 each for the combos and when I questioned it because the price on the overhead menu said 5.69 they said oh yeah and then charged 5.89 each. Again, I questioned the difference and the older man at the register said, &#34;do you want it or not&#34;? I was shocked! I said why does the menu say 5.69 and you are charging 5.89. He said we raised our prices. I said well why don&#39;t you put that on your menu? He didn&#39;t answer. Got home and tasted the rice ball and knew right away it was spoiled by the sour taste. My husband said take it back and I just threw it away and said it wasn&#39;t worth driving all the way there but they surely will not see me visiting again."

The only thing that irks me is the credit card issue.  Folks, businesses CANNOT set a minimum purchase amount.  It is in direct violation of their agreement with the credit card companies.  They can, however, add a surcharge, but I can&#39;t remember the last time I saw any business do that.

I have been yelled at by the old guy behind the cash register when trying to use my credit card for a $6 purchase.  He pointed to the sign and said &#34;Minimum $7&#34;.  When I told him that he was in violation of his agreement with the credit card company, he rang me up but, trust me, the looks and grumbling I got were a clear indication that he never wanted me back in that store.

I&#39;m kind of a meatball lover honestly... there&#39;s something wonderful about a delicious well made juicy meatball where when you bite in, the meatball has a firm but soft texture and flavor throughout.  No matter whether it&#39;s Italian, BBQ, Chinese... a well made meatball is like a mini-burger in your mouth.  It can be perfection.

This place, ranks well up there.  The meatball picked up hints of the red sauce it&#39;s been soaking in, has the obligatory soft texture that crumbles perfectly in your mouth while giving you just enough resistance.  

If you&#39;ve got a moment, come get a meatball (or even their meatball sandwich!)  Good stuff!!

Verdict:  I&#39;ll be back to try their other sandwiches... and to have a meatball sandwich!  Their list is HUGE, and it may be perfect for some picnic dates or catering gigs at a party!"

And, as of Jan. 2012, they are now taking credit cards! They prefer you spend at least $7 to use one -- which is not hard to do. Sweet, this makes it easy for often cash-less me to stop by more often!

What can you find at Frankie&#39;s? Fresh-baked bread. Hand-made pasta. Lots of imported sauces and canned tomatoes. A deli counter with all sorts of meat, cheese, salads and sandwiches. And homemade ricotta, at a whopping $1.79 a pound. Yep. They&#39;ll just slice a hunk off and wrap it up for ya. 

There&#39;s also imported espresso (Illy and Lavazza!), imported olives, olive oil, etc., a decent selection of wine, and some other random grocery-type items. 

I know lots of people come here for lunch, but for me it&#39;s a quick stop before home for last-minute dinner supplies. You could easily throw together a romantic dinner with pasta, sauce, garlic bread and wine for way less than you&#39;d pay at a fancy Italian restaurant. Rock and roll."

All Their sandwiches are delicious, the italian sub is excellent and I&#39;m very picky when it comes to sandwiches, I don&#39;t eat fast food subs I like a sandwich that was prepared with quality cold cuts that are sliced at the time they&#39;re preparing my sandwich.

So far, we&#39;re doing great! Reminds me of some Italian delis on Long Island I used to love. I first had a feeling the joint wasn&#39;t exactly right when I noticed they didn&#39;t sell Snapple, but thats ok - I&#39;ll trade Snapple for a great Italian sub any day. I grabbed my Diet Coke and went up to the counter to order my sandwich. That&#39;s when things went straight downhill. 

I notice there are about 8 labeled Italian Heros (they called them sandwiches not Heros - should have tipped me off) sitting on the counter already-made. I tell the guy it&#39;s my first time here and I&#39;m testing the waters and ask them to make a fresh one. They refuse - made some joke about how the ones on the counter were just made a few minutes ago. Fine. I&#39;ll take your premade sandwich but it better be good. I sit down outside, open her up, and to my dismay I&#39;m staring at some real sketchy looking bread. The oil/vinegar sitting in that wrapper got about half the bread really soggy, and the other half really chewy and hard to bite. Essentially ruined the sandwich. I&#39;m thinking it was probably made last night. The meat tasted OK - nothing special - it was hard to decipher between the bites trying to chew through this half-chewy half-soggy bread. Gave my jaw a workout. Funny, because at all the &#34;Italian Deli&#39;s&#34; in the city I&#39;ve tried (Bari, Panozzos), they had the opposite problem - hard, stale bread. Can&#39;t win out here. In hindsight as soon as I opened my sandwich I should have went back inside and showed them the soggy nightmare, but on the other hand in hindsight no real deli sells premade sandwiches in the first place. I don&#39;t even think I&#39;ll go back to Frankie&#39;s and give it another chance because the more I think about this story the angrier I get at the refusal to make me a fresh sandwich - it&#39;s more of a lack of respect thing at this point.

P.s. it was not crowded at all, we were only people ordering sandwiches."

Twenty-five minutes later, I was in love, and I was eating a lightning fast sandwich in my car, focusing intently on tasty piled meat and some of the most delicious thousand island dressing of my life. 

As others have mentioned, this is truly a place for Italian cuisine/ingredients. Lots of love has been given to olive oil, pasta, and jardiniere. But there&#39;s also a great selection of other randomness that makes it suitably deli-like. I enjoyed looking around so much, that I missed my sandwich being prepared and it was waiting on the counter for me when I returned from Foodie LaLaLand. 

And yes, the man at the register was a grouch. But I kinda liked that. Not many people have the balls to take your money and be ever so slightly rude to you at the same time. So while I was slightly taken aback by his gruff demeanor, I also felt as if he issued a challenge, for me to come back and maybe next time he would recognize me, and not be so...crotchety lol. 

They do accept debit/credit cards, but it&#39;s clear cash will go a long way toward sweetening the temperament of the codger behind the register. Just a thought to keep in mind."

I used to get the buffalo chicken panini almost everytime but they changed the bread to a much firmer bread.   Having TMJ isnt good with hard bread.   But seriously everything here is the bomb.   The only dish I wasnt fond of was the chicken salad.   Not bad but could have used more flavor.    Other than that rice balls are great and they have a great selection of &#34;just put it in the oven&#34; foods I have yet to try.    Thumbs up Frankies!

Frankie&#39;s is a gem of an Italian Deli and Shop in the suburbs. I would never have thought a place like this would be tucked away in a Lombard strip mall. 

Great for a quick lunch to go. I had the large Italian sandwich for $4.09 and it was delicious. 

The shop has authentic Italian foods of all kinds. 

Outdoor seating is the only place to sit making the joint stricting carry-out come winter.

I went in a few times for lunch and had some some sandwiches made.   I sadly have to say, ew.  The BLT was not toasted, their was sooo much bacon to cause a heart attack and it was sooo soft.  I mean I love bacon, but there can be too much.  I like mine crispy as well.  Today, I tried the chicken salad sandwich it was soooo bland, all I tasted was mayo.  I will say that I did take a pint of frozen meat sauce and some pre made chili.  Which my boyfriend and I did enjoy.  I don&#39;t know if they get there deli stuff pre made or if they make it there.  But they could take a little more effort.  They have plenty of people working there.  Plus, the older gentleman behind the counter, working the register kept giving me the evil eye.  My coworker said he was the owner, but even so.  Wondering if I would have said I was part Italian I would be treated better."

I think I&#39;d actually shiv a guy for the pepperoni. (Shiv is a verb, right? Not just a noun?) And the pre-made pasta salads, oh doctor, are they delicious. Perhaps a bit salty sometimes, but I&#39;ll take it. I&#39;m not as big a fan of the subs, giving them only 4 out of 5 stars, because the sub rolls themselves are a little blah. You&#39;re better off buying the meats and cheeses you want from the counter and then picking up a bag of their pretzel rolls to make your own sandwich at home. The pretzel rolls are like the pepperoni, shiv worthy. 

The only troubling part of the Frankie&#39;s experience (in addition to the no credit card thing) is, what I like to call, the dirty look factor. No matter how ready you are to place an order, how succinct, the guys behind the counter WILL give you a dirty look. It&#39;s like they add a silent &#34;dumbass&#34; to everything they say. &#34;Can I help you, dumbass?&#34; Don&#39;t take it personally; they do it to everyone. Maybe it&#39;s some kind of disorder. 

Anyway, like I say, the food is fantastic. So grab some cash--and your brave exterior--and head on over to Frankie&#39;s."

By the looks of it from the outside/when you first walk in, it looks like a little Italian grocery store, but its much more than that.  They have items you wouldn&#39;t find at your local Jewel or Dominick&#39;s and the best part of all is their sub sandwiches.  They are made fresh to order and they are quick!

Their deli is great.  Tons of meats, cheeses and condiments to choose from.  Sandwiches made to order, and always very fresh.

They also double as a small market, a with a very wide selection of somewhat harder to find groceries.  Some of it you&#39;ll find in bigger stores, but most of it you&#39;d have a prety hard time finding elsewhere.

The best products they sell are their pre-packaged dinners.  My family picked up a 7 layer home made lasagna from them, and it was hands down one of the best lasagnas I have ever had.  Don&#39;t even bother buying one from a big store, or trying to make your own: Just try one of these.  Ridiculously good.

Staff is always nice and provide excellent service.

Bottom line, next time you&#39;re near lombard and want to try somehwere different for lunch, or aren&#39;t sure what to pick up for dinner, stop by Frankie&#39;s.  You&#39;ll figure something out.

It may seem like I&#39;m generous with my ratings but if that&#39;s my feeling, that&#39;s what I&#39;ll go with. This is rock solid and a little suprised more people don&#39;t know about this place. It&#39;s tucked away so if you&#39;re not familiar with the area, you might miss it. My first introduction to Frankie&#39;s was years back, when a friend picked up a pan of lasagna. So not longer after, I went to see the place myself. 

As far as food, you can get what you need here. I bought a pound (or close to it) of mortadella for about the same price I would get a 1/2 pound for elsewhere. I don&#39;t think you can beat the subs, especially for the price you pay (about $4.00-$5.00). I&#39;m a big fan of the Italian sub (provolone, salami, capicola, mortadella,lettuce,tomato,onion, &amp; oil) as well as the roast beef. WAY BETTER value than Subway and Quizno&#39;s (those Quizno&#39;s locations that are still around). 

The selection of meat is tremendous and again, at a very good price. You need other specialty products like dried pasta, olive oil, giardinara, and the like, you&#39;ll find plenty of what you would need here. It&#39;s a nice place to fill a pantry. Here are some examples of brands they carry:
- meat:  Daniele, San Daniele, Vienna, &amp; Volpi (and a nice choice of homemade sausage).
- cheese: Auricchio Provolone, Chellino Ricotta, Stella Fontanella, Grande Fresh Mozzarella, &amp; Parmigiano Reggiano.
- pastas: Barilla, DeCecco, and Divella.
- a ridiculous amount of canned tomatoes, olive oils &amp; balsamic vinegars.

Frankie&#39;s is in a strip mall, on the north side of Yorktown Mall (near Carson&#39;s).

Deliciously fresh just cut meats and hand made sandwiches. Honestly their deli cuts and their cold sandwiches are delicious. They are made so fast and they are a great price. You can taste the quality. And honestly if you ask can have anything put on your sandwich. 
Dont forget its a little store. You can pick up some drinks, some pasta, some frozen ready made food. And even some ready made salads.

Cons:
No credit cards. I mean come on!
Sandwich makers are high stress, seem in a hurry, if you are at all slow with your order theyll definitely rush you. Be ready to order before you go up. haha.
The french bread always seems too dry or hard to beat into. Their other breads are good.
No seating area.

My turkey sandwich was delicious.  It came in the small, white butcher paper that I love.  The bread here was wonderfully chewy and all for under $5.  Yes, my total with tax was $4.99.  This makes Subway&#39;s lame $5 footlong advertisements seem insanely ridiculous.

Once thing I like about Kimchihana is that they have a replicate display case of the food they serve (similar to Joy Yees). 

For $7-12 you can get affordable Korean food like bim bim bop/ bulgogi/ soup+ many side dishes. I got the veggie bim bim bop and a few side dishes for around $8- what a steal! Granted, if you wanted it in a stone bowl it cost a few extra dollars, but honestly, it tastes pretty much the same. This is asian fast food and while it isn&#39;t spectacular, it is definitely a quick eat on a lazy day.

Also, the portions are large so you&#39;ll be stuff on your way out. Or do what I do and walk it off afterwards at the supermarket :)

Ps. Depending on how close you sit, they might bring you your food. If you sit far away, make sure to stick close to the food stall so you can grab your food once they bring it out. Once you&#39;re done eating, be sure to bring back trays."

Now, Its true what quite a few helpers have said with regards to the service, It needs a lot of work.  The owner will not even look you in the eye  while talking and only one word will come out if any.  I made an effort to thank her and her response was merely a nod and did not look at me.  No smile was given.  

It could just be their way and maybe to them that is adequate customer service.  As long as you get your food and the food they gave was good, that it&#39;s good enough for them."

I agree with others, the service isn&#39;t great, but what do you expect?  They&#39;re Asian AND in a small food court of an Asian market!

We came at 2:30, which was not lunch hour. There are two women, one back in the kitchen and one at the front. My husband ordered #4 special bibimbap and combination c2. We got a receipt not showing what we ordered.
My bibimbap was ready within 20 mins. It was served in a tray with several pickled vegetable sides in small dishes as all Korean restaurant. However, all vegetables were not fresh. after another 20 mins waiting, the combination c2 was still not ready. After I saw several people coming after us were called, I let my husband go to check what&#39;s up. It turned out that they forgot. After two mins after my husband seated, the lady made our order came to our table asking for our receipt! She thought we didn&#39;t order!! Thank god. There was at least the amount charged showing on the receipt. It made me uncomfortable! Another 10 mins, I saw some customers went to the counter before being called and got their food. I thought I should try the same way. What happened next really pissed me off! 
While waiting by the counter, I saw the lady at front going back into the kitchen using her BARE hands to put vegetables into a bibimbap bowl!!
After she passed the bowl to a customer in front of me. I asked &#34; hello, how long is it gonna take for my C2?&#34;
She seemed like remember something, and went back. After a while, she came out and gave me a plate.
&#34;That&#39;s it?????&#34;
She realized something, said &#34;oh, rice&#34;, then I got a bowl of rice.
&#34;That&#39;s it?????????????? Can I have a tray and vegetable sides?
She said &#34;you have two people, so you can share.&#34;
I was absolutely shocked. I was like It&#39;s not the hell of your business to tell us to share. I insisted to have my sides.
She got an attitude back to the kitchen and out with a tray and some sides on it. No sorry. What a bad customer service!
I took a look at the food. All beef was over burned. All were black.

I went with a couple friends of mine and ordered the lunch special which is basically rice, 11 sidedishes and a cup of soup for $6.99. I waited for probably 20 minutes for this simple meal. When they called my number I recieved 2 bowls of rice (my friend and I ordered the same thing) and 6 sidedishes and no soup. I questioned them and they told me it didn&#39;t come with soup today. I argued that I could have gotten a main dish which comes with the rice and sidedishes on the side for free. After much arguing they finally gave me back a full refund.

I tried a few weeks later and gave them anther chance. This time I ordered a beef rib soup. The wait was much shorter but when I recieved my dish it smelled like stinky feet. I have had this dish many times and that is not what it is supposed to taste like. I bit into a piece of the meat and had to spit it out immediately. The meat was so old and expired. We complained and they gave us another refund. My patience is gone with this place. Not sure what happened to the mangagement or cooks of this place. The health department definitely needs to make a visit as well. 

Pros
-full refund
-lots of options on menu

Cons
-over priced
-expired meat and side-dishes
-dirty dishes piled everywhere

Overall it was a good experience. Ordered the combo 1, which is beef bulgogi. It was pretty good for around 8-9 bucks. Would have liked more meat though. The guy I was with said the same. Not too big of a fan if the sides, so they could probably ask ppl if they want all of the sides, would save them some money for a family owned business (assuming it&#39;s family owned).

It&#39;s located in the Hmart food court which I never knew existed. I&#39;ve been working in the area for around 2 years now and totally could have gotten my Asian food fix there. Service was eh. The lady taking orders didn&#39;t really speak English too well. Her and another person in front of me were arguing for like 5 min before it was my turn and I couldn&#39;t really figure out why. Our orders took like 10-15 min to come out. So i guess it&#39;s good that it was fresh but a little long for my taste.

It was a Saturday at dinner time - long line and generally busy in the H-Mart food court. I ordered the Japchae, which the overhead menu specifically states comes with &#34;beef and lots of vegetables!&#34; (The exclamation point is on there too...)

Issue #1 with this this place is that there is no receipt numbering, or ANYTHING, to help you identify which food is yours. Seems to be a lot easier if you&#39;re Korean-speaking, but I still witnessed multiple confused conversations in Korean. Anyway, after 40 minutes of waiting, I head up to the counter to see what&#39;s up. While I&#39;m there, I observe a plate of noodles being heated in the microwave prior to serving, and those turn out to be mine (further proven by the rubbery texture and crispy crud on the plate). Food at last! But there&#39;s no beef. I politely point this out; I get a head-shake which makes me feel like I&#39;m a crook. I try the lady working the counter; she ignores my polite requests for help twice. Finally I get in line and block the line, forcing the issue.

&#34;Hi, I think I&#39;m missing some beef here.&#34;
- &#34;I&#39;m not sure what you ordered.&#34;
&#34;The number 2, the Jopchae.&#34;
- &#34;No beef with that. $2 extra.&#34;
&#34;But your menu says it comes with beef.&#34;
- &#34;No beef with that.&#34;

That&#39;s as far as I could get.

My friend&#39;s bibimbap clay pot, pictured on their menu with beef, also was beefless.

Not sure if they ran out of beef, are not doing well and cutting meat, or what, but good service this is not...

We both got the Hot Chicken Bulgogi, which was alright but we universally agreed that it was just....alright. The metal chopsticks and metal rice bowl were fun. 
True to the place&#39;s name, you get three little dishes of Korean pickle with your meal. 

We both thought that it was more expensive (we only got the bulgogi and rice, not the combo) for what you get than it warranted being.

The restaurant was blasting classical music, which contrasted oddly with the classic rock drifting in from H Mart, so you had The Eagles singing about getting a peaceful easy feelin&#39; in one ear while Beethoven was playing stridently in the other.

When I got my bowl of rice cakes and dumplings, I had to do a doublecheck to make sure I was in a food court, because it was just that good.  (The last time that I ordered the dish at a restaurant that I shall not name, a bowl of broth came out. Confused, I took my spoon to search around for the dduk, and counted maybe a dozen at best. I am likely going to be having a word with them one of these days on suggested improvements.)

Downsides to the food court are ambience - obvious (half the space is vacant and yet to be built out) and lack of wifi- not so obvious (I don&#39;t imagine tech savvy Koreans will stand by for this much longer).

After my initial review where I stated I had only tried their spicy beef soup, I have also had other items in their menu, including the beef and pork bulgogi, dukboki, plus others, and they are all good. I agree a little bit that they sometimes are slow and sometimes their quality varies a little, but they do try hard to please everybody, and their portions are very generous. Plus, this is a food court, this is no fancy restaurant, so they have to serve people eating there plus some takeout orders, which for a small kitchen they do a great job. Besides, I don&#39;t mind waiting a bit for my takeout, I get entertained looking at the pictures of their menu or watching the hustle and bustle of people coming and going."

Located in the food court of H Mart, Kimchihana gives you a lot of traditional Korean dish choices. Took a friend here who was wanting to learn more about the Korean culture and we both liked our dishes. The Bibimbop is BIG. Almost worth sharing if both of you aren&#39;t starving. Plus the dishes come with a plethora of side dishes. So while I think the food tastes OK, the abundance of side dishes and the size of the entrees I think make it worth the while."

The food here isn&#39;t going to be sit-down restaurant quality, but that&#39;s not what you should be comparing to (in my opinion).  Kimchihana is the Korean restaurant in the food court of H Mart.  The food is pretty good considering, and has a decent selection.  I come here when I go shopping or when I&#39;m driving by, but if you&#39;re looking for a party or a sit-down with friends, you could definitely do better.

There isn&#39;t much to say for service or the venue.  It&#39;s a food court, you&#39;re not expecting waiter served tables or table cloths.

Overall... worth coming to when you&#39;re looking for a quick Korean bite."

Go for the other places nearby instead. The customer service was absolutely horrible and the food gave me indigestion. Took about 15 minutes before the lady took our order. We ordered C2 and 12 and then got a table to wait for our food. 

We waited an extremely long time for our meal and they don&#39;t bring it to your table, they just dump it on the counter and expect you to know what the food you ordered looks like. The food was average and we didn&#39;t get are kalbi or ribs, which should have been included in our meal. We thought maybe it took a little longer so we we kept eating. We were almost done with our meal and still not sign of our ribs. So I went up to the counter and stood there. I seriously waited there for 15 minutes. Everyone in the kitchen saw me standing there and they didn&#39;t say anything and completely ignored me. The lady SAW me standing there as well and ignored me. When she finally came out with a tray of food, I tried to get her attention by saying &#34;Excuse me...&#34; but she dumped the tray on the counter and went back into the kitchen. A few moments later, she came back out and I tried to say &#34;Excuse me&#34; again and she once again blatantly ignored me, dumped the tray on the counter and went back into the kitchen. I was getting frustrated because I had been standing there for over 15 minutes. While standing there, I got a perfect view of the kitchen, which was filthy. There was a guy putting the side dishes on the little saucer plates and he was not wearing gloves and he rubbed his nose and the sweat off his head with his hands and immediately went back to sticking his hands into the food. I felt sick to my stomach watching this. Finally she came back out and said &#34;what?&#34; and went to the register. I calmly asked her if our ribs were being made since it was part of our order, C2. The woman asked if I was placing an order and I told her that I was not and tried to explain it to her again. She stared at me and said &#34;No, no, no&#34; while shaking her head and tried to walk away. I once again tried to explain the situation to her...that I had ordered and paid for the C2 and the 12. The woman kept rudely cutting in and saying &#34;no, no, no.&#34; There was a woman behind me who had witnessed the whole thing and tried to help explain it, but she refused to listen.

 Finally, in a very rude and accusatory voice she demanded that I show her the receipt. I told her that she had not given me a receipt. She called for someone in the kitchen and they spoke in korean and he went back in and dug around in a garbage and handed her some random receipt. She took it and shove it in my face, saying &#34;You order 2 bibibamps.&#34; I told her no, we ordered the C2 and the 12. And she told us &#34;No, no, no. It says here you ordered two bibibamps.&#34; I told her that it was the wrong receipt and that we had not ordered two bibibamps. She walked out from behind the counter and went over to our tables and pointed out what we had eaten already. Did she think about trying to find THE RIGHT RECEIPT? NO. We calmly told her that there might have been some mistake, because we ordered AND PAID FOR the the C2 and the 12. Then she said, &#34;You want? You pay.&#34; while making a &#34;give it here&#34; hand gesture and walked away. Never in my life have I ever encountered such rude customer service. We had paid for the meal already and she was the one who made the mistake, and she expected us to pay extra for the meal that we had ordered? The woman who had tried to defend us, shook her head. We left, still extremely hungry because we were expecting ribs and all we got were some measly vegetable dishes. Later that night I had extremely bad stomach cramps, probably from the extremely unsanitary working conditions. Save yourselves the trouble of having to deal with such a rude woman and your stomachs...go to Tofu Village next door or one of the other kiosks."

That being said, I try to love this place.  Its way closer than Chicago, and they offer a lot of my favorite Korean dishes.  I always get the surrongtang, and I&#39;m always a little sick of it halfway through.  The noodles need to be cut, the beef needs to be of better quality.  Also, more gak du gi would be nice.  

The dduk bo gi was way overcooked and although it was spicy, the flavor was lacking.  

Maybe next time I&#39;ll try the bbq dishes.  The burrito looks good..  and how can they mess that up right?"

It took 25 minutes to get our first dish and 45 minutes to get our 4th...#s 2 and 3 came right at around 40 minutes. The lady working the register was new and very sweet. The lady in the kitchen was making everything out of order and there was lots of confusion. Even other customers were talking to me about our orders, their orders, what was going on, etc. The food wasn&#39;t worth the wait and frustration. Skip this place and go to Joy Yee Noodle a block south. That place is AMAZING! We just went to Kimchihana to go to the market, but ended up running out of time after all the time wasted waiting for lunch."

Water and I think tea too were free. I didn&#39;t take the tea so I&#39;m not sure but they are there with the water and cups.

It is outrageously expensive for food court food on a sticky table and chairs with no respect to their customers. The owner seems to be a decent guy, but the lady works at the cashier needs to find a different job somewhere else if she cannot love her job. She is not supporting her husband&#39;s business by being there. 
Sometimes, their rice is over cooked, and believe or not, it ruins the whole meal. The seafood, especially squid, in Tofu soup tastes like they had been in freezer more than 3 months. Pancake like jijimgae (even saurce) has almost no fravor for $8! Dduckboki is too sweet and over cooked. I would choose Tanaka Sushi for my Korean food cravings for cheaper price with MORE hospitality (or appropriate attitude at least)."

I reviewed Burger Antics at their 1st location, now I finally got the chance to go to their new location to eat some amazingness. I feel so bad that it has taken me so long, especially after destroying today&#39;s meal.

I went with a couple of friends early in the day, so there was not a line surprisingly.  I ordered the burger of the month, the Montezuma&#39;s Revenge.  I played the shit out of that game for Commodore 64 as a kid, so why not relive some memories with my tastebuds.

This meal was absolutely amazing.  The burger was cooked perfectly to my liking, the chorizo and cheese on it were tasty amd rich, the peppers were hot, the fries were crispy, hot, and seasoned in the most perfect way possible.  Seriously, I want to move next door to this place, because this is one of the best god damn burgers you can have in the surrounding Chicagoland area.

To ice the cake, i got to taste a shake that they now offer.  Motherfucking Shakes.  And they are do die for.  I will gladly stand in their yard once again for one of these things.  It was a peanut butter chocolate drizzle shake, which makes me think that if I had a peanut allergy, this would be the best way to die.

Oh and the waitstaff was extremely friendly too.  I love this place."

I am not a big fan of burgers , but I decided to order one, because my friends who I came with told me that this place is all about hamburgers. I was a little skeptical, but I really liked the one I had. Juicy, flavored, a little bit spicy. It comes with your choice of French fries, house chips or coleslaw. I picked chips and it was amazing, probably the best chips I ever tried. 
It is not cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for.
The only concern I have it&#39;s a floor was sticky and dirty, also the bathroom can be cleaner. 
Other than that everything was perfect.
We will definitely go back there again."

With all the rave reviews I guess I was surprised that Burger Antics is a small place and nothin&#39; fancy. We ended up sitting at the bar since it was just the two of us and the bartender was super friendly and helpful. I thought it was funny that they have three TVs all playing whatever DVD they choose... I believe it was the original Ghostbusters on when we were there :)

They have a full bar with great craft beers, whiskeys, and more to choose from. I wasn&#39;t in the drinking mood though, so I decided to indulge in one of their craft sodas which I thought was unique. The leninade sparkling lemonade is what I had. It was really good, but surprisingly orange colored!

To eat we started with the shrooms which included 4 very small white button mushroom caps stuffed with goat cheese, roasted garlic, and grilled onion. I was a bit surprised by the size of this app, but the shrooms were tasty none the less.

For the main event I went with the BBQ cheddar burger which came with house made bbq sauce, applewood smoked bacon, sharp cheddar cheese, and grilled onions all layered between a pretzel bun. Holy drool-worthy! This burger was amazing. Sure, I felt like a bit of a fat kid and got full half way through, but it was too good not to finish. To top it off, this beauty came with a pickle spear that had a bit of a kick to it. I chose their pub chips as my side which are cut in house and tossed in their house made bbq seasoning. Yummy!

I definitely suggest stopping by Burger Antics for a burger and a drink. If you want to make a night out of it like we did, head on over to the Galloping Ghost Arcade after!"

Hence, the &#34;antics&#34;. I&#39;m a very conventional eater, so I opted to build my own burger. I ordered a six ounce lunch burger with avocado and homemade ketchup and mustard. It was the best burger I have had in a long time. 

When you build your own burger, you are charged $0.50 for each topping. Some toppings, such as the avocado, cost $1.00. Some might dislike having to pay $0.50 for ketchup or mustard, but these condiments are homemade and better than the norm. The ketchup had a tangy sweetness which I loved. The plate presentation was artistic and thoughtful, with the ketchup and mustard in swirls on the bun and three generous avocado slices on the patty. The big avocado pieces made the burger a slippery mess to eat, but it was well worth it! The bun was also bakery fresh. In other words, the whole meal was excellent and I would definitely return."

I yelped what was around and discovered the original &#34;Burger Antics&#34; attached to a sports bar.  

I had their &#34;Swiss &amp; Mushroom.&#34;  It was one of these memorable burgers that I knew that I would have more than once in my lifetime.  

Fast forward to the year of 2016, &#34;Burger Antics&#34; has found a permanent home in downtown Brookfield.  Hubby and I were out and about in Lombard, so we decided to stop by to have some quality burgers.  

I know many restaurants that serve burgers as their primary specialty don&#39;t always offer vegan or vegetarian burger patty option, yet you have a choice to substitute the usual beef patty with the black beans.  My &#34;Blue n&#39; Black&#34; burger was just as fantastic as the &#34;Swiss &amp; Mushroom&#34; I had last time.  The crumbs of blue cheese drizzled on the medium-cooked thick beef patty...don&#39;t tell me that it doesn&#39;t sound enticing!  

Their fries were fresh and crispy.  The chef here knows her stuff because one (1) large pickle is included with every burger entree.  That&#39;s exactly how I like to conclude my burger feast.  

Even though the burgers here are top-notch, I didn&#39;t love the service.  It was slightly impersonal and wish it could be more prompt.  We were definitely not neglected.  The server came to out table asking if we were ready to order &#34;thirty (30) seconds&#34; upon sitting down.  We respectfully informed her that we weren&#39;t and please gave us some time to peruse the menu.  Ten (10) minutes passed and we have made our decisions, she was nowhere to be found and we didn&#39;t want to be rude to flag her down.  

At the end of the meal, the owner came around and greeted everyone in the dining room.  I always know that local business owners want to do the best they can and having good feedback from social media is crucial to their business.  The quality of burgers at &#34;Burger Antics&#34; is a solid five (5) stars for me, yet the overall service can use some improvements."

The stars aligned and we made it here for lunch on a Sunday. We were seated right away (I don&#39;t think they take reservations), and we decided to order burgers. I decided to order the barbeque bacon cheddar burger with everything on it. My girlfriend, who doesn&#39;t eat meat, went with the black bean burger. 

I was thrilled to learn that all burgers come with pretzel buns, which are definitely the best kind of buns! I also got fries on the side, which were delicious. They make their own housemade ketchup, which is definitely different from your Heintz 57, but not necessarily in a bad way. It was all good! My only issue here was the service. Even though there weren&#39;t that many people dining in, the only waitress working seemed very flustered. She forgot to ever check in with us and she took so much time to bring us the check that we finally had to go up to the bar and inquire about it. My impression was that they somehow weren&#39;t properly staffed. Maybe more people dined in than they were expecting. It wasn&#39;t that big of a deal, but good service should be something easily changeable for management to make people feel more satisfied and well taken care of.

I can say with sincerity that Burger Antics is an excellent burger option if you don&#39;t feel like trekking all the way to the city only to wait for a seat at Kuma&#39;s or Au Cheval. They also have a very decent craft beer selection there, which I will have to take advantage of the next time I come here.

Mine came with smoked gouda and a ton of grilled jalapenos, which turns out to be a nice combination.  (Braver souls than I might be excited about the opportunity to swap in grilled habaneros.)  Anyway, they make a really good burger -- not quite at the level of the most famous places in the city (mine had too much chipotle mayo and also fell apart), but probably deserving of an honorable mention.

Now you might be asking me why you, or I, ever felt the need to get a really nice burger in Brookfield. The answer is that this place is around the corner from The Galloping Ghost, one of the most overwhelming and yet wonderful arcades in the greater Chicago area. So if you&#39;re looking to combine a trip to the Galloping Ghost with a surprisingly good bite to eat, this is your place.

Three minor quibbles:  (1) They take great pride in making their own ketchup and mustard etc. in house, and not having any bottled ketchup on hand. A noble dream. But the house ketchup is a little bland and watery, and it would be better to have Heinz. (2) They have fried pickles on the menu, but they are fried in giant spears which makes them hard to eat, and more importantly, the coating was more leathery than crispy; fried pickles should be crispy. (3) The bacon maple donut that one of my companions ordered for dessert was nice, but had WAYY too much bacon. It was snowed with chunks of bacon. But when I cheekily suggested to the server at the end of the meal that the donut had a little too much bacon, she didn&#39;t miss a beat before replying: &#34;Well, this IS AMERICA.&#34;

Fair enough."

The drink menu was quite a bit bigger than the food menu.  Not that I&#39;m complaining!  We all know how I love booze and antics (and shenanigans), but on this particular day I was in search of food, not booze....

I was expecting more burger options, to be honest, but there were only 6.  They all sounded good and the mushroom and swiss burger I got was very good.  The grilled cheeses on the menu sounded delicious as well.  Had I not been there with my brother and sis that don&#39;t drink I probably would&#39;ve ordered a beer with my burger, the drink menu certainly isn&#39;t small!  

The décor fits perfectly with the Burger Antics vibe and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Our server made sure we knew what we were in for with the housemade condiments and everything we ordered.  

Maybe someday I&#39;ll make it back to try some drinks and grilled cheese. The train is right across the street so I could stumble onto a city bound train after I get cheese tipsy."

It&#39;s a bit small inside so if your going with a large party get there early to grab a big enough table. We ordered a few appetizers for the table. Went with the signature deviled eggs and fried pickles! All the burger options on the menu made it hard to decide so thankfully they offered the mini slides of all their best burgers! For minis they were moist and delicious all served on a pretzel roll. The fries were actual hand cut thick fried to a perfect crunch but not overly crispy. Burger Antics also makes their own ketchup, it&#39;s a good mix between tart and sweet. This burger place gets a high five from me!!"

It also helps that I work walking distance and stop in and pick up my food on my way home from work but anyways back to the food. Since my original review, I have also tried the maple bacon doughnut (YUMM! SAVE ROOM IF POSSIBLE TO EAT THIS YUMMY TREAT!) I saw they have milkshakes now and I LOVEEEEEE milkshakes so I&#39;m hoping to stop in in the next few weeks for a milkshake and the BOTM! I&#39;m definitely drooling thinking about it!"

That takes a lot of dedication to change your menu that much as it shows the creativity and love for the job and that&#39;s a place I want to eat at.

Slider Plate - I thought I would have to order a ton of other things but those three sliders will fill you up. All the burgers have been really juicy. From the sliders to the regular size burger. So never been disappointed with that. Season not to over powering...slightly wish it had more but still better than most that burn/dry out the meat to no flavor at all. I would recommend for most to get this the first time as it gives a chance to experiment with three different flavors.

BBQ bacon cheddar - I first tried this treat in the slider size portion but it has won me over to get the lager version. When I first notice the dollop of BBQ sauce I was concern it wasn&#39;t going to be enough but it blended nicely. Meat was cooked exactly how I asked for the larger size (cooked medium). Dropped an egg on top and made the sandwich awesome. (my fav burger)

Black &#39;N Blue - Blue cheese crumbles with blue cheese dressing and frizzled onions. Ingredients tasted really fresh of the block and not prepackaged. (2nd fav)

4 cheese burger - provolone, muenster, pepper jack and fried the mozzarella. the most visual but least fav for me...not in a bad way just for me I wish it had some kind of sauce that made it more unique (like mango aioli?--new burger of the week? You can call it Sweet L :D ) because the blend of those four cheese together was a little lost to me. I couldn&#39;t identify with what flavor cheese was prominent in the bite of the burger.

Hotter Than Hell- Smoked gouda, avocado, grilled jalapenos, and house made chipotle mayo..the name makes it sound like you&#39;re going to be in the bathroom a long time but was tame to me. Will add the grilled habaneros to it next time.

Pesto Burger - (weekly burger)  heirloom tomatoes, fresh mozzarella with pesto Good.. slightly wish I had some onions but I&#39;m sure it was just cause I was craving the BBQ bacon cheddar that comes with grilled onions.

Mushroom Swiss - Honestly I don&#39;t recall to much I smashed this kind of quick. It&#39;s not one that really stood out to me.

Shrooms/Wings - to keep it short, I just didn&#39;t like it..can&#39;t win them all.. The mushrooms came down to not wanting to eat it as I only ate one to be polite to the person that ordered it. The wings I could eat but I just wouldn&#39;t order them again as I didn&#39;t find them to be special/upscale  to be worth it.

Pub Chips - At first I thought someone dropped some kind of liquid on my chips (slightly still do) as the outside was crunchy but the middle parts for some of them had like a moist feel on my tongue. The BBQ seasoning on them were great ...minus the wet feeling with some of the chips.

Fries - Potatoes they actually chop up and cook so basically you know they are good.

Maple Bacon Doughnut - FRESH! the only drawback was mine was a little overdone as the outside was a little hard/crispy but wasn&#39;t a big deal. I would get again. 

Drinks - I haven&#39;t ordered anything but the list is impressive to me. beer list although not massive. Everyone can find something. They also have a mix of craft soda and wine. So again everyone should be able to find SOMETHING! 

Although I didn&#39;t like my appetizers. I didn&#39;t come here for that. I came for a burger and been back because those Lil&#39; Mijo&#39;s are good."

Burger Antics has been on our list for a while, so I&#39;m glad we got the chance to try it.  The burgers were so large, there was no room for any appetizers or dessert, so unfortunately, I can&#39;t comment on those.

My husband got the &#34;Hotter than Hell&#34; Burger and added the grilled habaneros.  I literally just tried the sauce on the burger and it was hotter than hell.  It came with smoked gouda, avocado, grilled jalapenos, and house made chipotle mayo.  I&#39;m not saying the chipolte mayo was hot, but literally the habaneros seeped into everything.  He thought it was great - but certainly not for the faint of heart.  The burger was perfectly cooked and had a nice flavor.  He even liked the fries and ate most of them. 

I had the Black N Blue Chicken Breast - house made cajun seasoning and topped with blue cheese crumbles, blue cheese dressing, and beer battered frizzled onions.  I, too, really liked the chicken and thought it was very moist - not at all dried out.  But what I didn&#39;t like was the frizzled onions - I would just do raw onions next time.

Our service was good and the place definitely can get crowded during a Sunday lunch.  It&#39;s a very family oriented place to come.  So if you want a good burger - you should give Burger Antics a try."

They have a total of 5 burgers. Not a big choice. Went to Another well known burger place and they have like 15 different burgers. The Mac and cheese was awful and way too expensive. They charge $12 for a very small plate. At that other burger place it is the same price and absolutely huge. The server was really weird. She kept telling us how backed up the kitchen was. With 15 tables and almost everyone eating when we walked in not sure how that is possible. It&#39;s a nice atmosphere and cute place just skip it. I wanted to like it but for the variety and price not too good. Take the ride somewhere else you won&#39;t be disappointed.

It was busier the second time around but they honestly need to find more help( there is a help wanted sign in window) I think the place is poorly managed , they need to speed up the kitchen so people aren&#39;t turned away because of no tables. We were in there over an hour just to eat a burger and pay bill.

Great beer selection including many seasonal beers.

I got the weekly special - poutine on the ritz.  It was fantastic.  At first when I got my plate I was curious as to why there was only a few pieces of steak on top, but underneath the cheese curds and fries was a hamburger patty.  It was a special surprise.  Would definitely get it again.  Too bad it was a weekly special :(

Highly recommend this place."

I finally made it there this week and was not disappointed. 

Service was pretty good. It seemed like there was one server and a bus boy per side of the restaurant, so there was small delays at times, but it&#39;s understandable.

We ordered the fried pickles as an app. 3 huge spears came out in all of their breaded glory. This is not my preferred type of fried pickle. The breading had good flavor but didn&#39;t stay on the pickle, and when I cut one of pickles, the other half jumped off the table onto the floor. Sad day. I loved the sweet mustardy dipping sauce they came with!

I ordered the slider trio with a side of fries for my meal. The sliders were so flavorful and amazing! I had the BBQ bacon, which even in slider form had huge pieces of bacon on it, the mushroom swiss- which was ooey gooey, and the 4 cheese. They were all equally amazing, but if I had to pick a favorite, I&#39;d say the 4 cheese was tops. All are served on toasted pretzel buns and will leave your hands with a nice sheen of grease on them. 

The fries were plentiful, $3 as an extra side, which was way more than enough. These are also pretty greasy, and somewhat limp. I do like a crispier fry, but they weren&#39;t bad. The housemade ketchup was more like a marinara, but with more complex flavor. Really different and good!

I loved their beer options- I found two for my weaker pallet that were fantastic!

We also went full on crazy and ordered the Maple Bacon Donut... that is definitely on my top 10 list of best things I&#39;ve ever eaten!! It has a crispy outside, and more of a bready inside- like a cinnamon roll might be, but then is slathered in maple frosting and crumbled bacon. The salty sweet + fresh warm bread was DIVINE!!

All in all, I will be back soon and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal!"

It was smaller than I anticipated and we were seated at a small table a little too close to the couple next to us, but the food makes up for the lack of seating. My wife had the BBQ bacon burger and raved about it and I made my own burger.  Large, flavorful, juicy (but not greasy), I had no complaints whatsoever!

We started with the fried pickles, which were delicious. I&#39;m sure the sauce for them was made from scratch just like the other condiments they use for their burgers. Next time, I think we&#39;ll try the stuffed mushrooms; they sound yummy too!

The burgers we had were the 4 Cheese and the BBQ Bacon burgers. The size of the burgers are note worthy and were commented on when they arrived to our table. They are nice thick, juicy burgers that barely fit in your mouth when taking a bite. Have a napkin handy...they ARE juicy! LOVE the fried mozzarella cheese on the 4 Cheese. The french fries are amazing to boot too! I took my left over fries home for the kids and they were even raving about them.

Love that. The burgers are also amazing - the pretzel buns are the best! Can&#39;t ever go wrong with pretzel buns. The burger pairings were really good too - I ordered the bbq bacon cheeseburger, the buffalo sauce one, and the really cheesy one. The buffalo one was my absolute fav - so much flavor! The cheese one was good too - especially LOVED the fried mozzarella so it tasted like a burger with a cheese stick on it ... never had that combo before but it was amazing. Wish there was more of the mozzarella on it but I just got the slider so maybe that&#39;s why it was a smaller portion. VERY cheesy though. Almost too much cheese. 

Deducted one star because the ambiance is kind of weird. We went at night when all the lights were on and it made it feel like the restaurant was closing / cleaning up. When all the lights are on, it makes the place seem big and empty and the bar seem like the finished basement of someone&#39;s parent&#39;s house. I hope the owners read this: dim the lights in the restaurant and keep the spotlights shining on the artwork on the walls. It will make a world of difference, and give a more intimate feel to the place when there were quite a few empty tables. Look to what similar popular burger places in Chicago/Schaumburg (rhymes with Uma&#39;s...) are doing in terms of ambient lighting - darker atmosphere with low lighting with some light shining on the artwork on the walls..."

What we liked:
The burgers.
The pretzel bread buns the burgers were on.
The thick bacon
The slice of cheddar cheese on the burger
The sauted onions on the burger
The generous serving of french fries and the french fries themselves.

In other words, we liked the food.

What we weren&#39;t too excited about:
The homemade ketchup.  None of us liked the flavor.  Wish we could have asked for a nice bottled ketchup to go with those delicious fries.

Pickle that comes with the burger - beware, it is a hot pickle.

The noise problem.  I know that the owners are addressing it but until they get it fixed, it is a real problem.  We got there about 1 hr. before closing and the restaurant was 3/4 full.  Noise level was too much for us. Not only the normal adult conversations but then when you add in a couple of toddlers who scream at different times.... It was enough to ask my family if they&#39;d like to get our lunch to go.  The others did not want to leave.  After a little while the table of 12 left and the noise level came down to what we considered just &#39;loud&#39; but acceptable."

By far the BEST, juciest burger I&#39;ve had! Awesome beer pairings too! I got the burger of the month that had pork belly and a cruchy pork rind on top. The beer was described as &#34;chocolately with berry notes&#34; and was excellent with the burger. Everyone in my group agreed the food was top notch! Kick-ass mac n&#39; cheese too!! Happy this is down the way from Galloping Ghost Arcade. -This will be our lunch spot when trekking out to Brookfield!!"

I let a few months pass before finally getting in there, and I wish I would&#39;ve went sooner! I went around 4 o&#39;clock on a Tuesday and I must&#39;ve just missed the rush because I was the only one in there. The service was great, my waiter made casual conversation with me (since I came in by myself and we were the only two in the dining area) but wasn&#39;t over bearing. I ordered the buff &#39;n stuff with fries and it was amazing! The burger was a pretty good size for the price. The fries were pretty good... I&#39;ve had better but they were good. The homemade ketchup was interesting, in a good way... Not like anything I&#39;ve had before but I enjoyed it.
I will definitely be coming back to Burger Antics in the future"

The husband and wife team of Dan &amp; Brenna, owners of Burger Antics have won the best burgers anywhere award. 

OMG what A burger experience I had tonight. The taste of the beef really comes through and thank goodness for the pretzel bun to soak up all the massive juice. I had muenster cheese, onion frizzles, dill pickle chips and chipotle mayo on my perfectly all pink &#34;medium&#34; burger with homemade bbq potato chips. The list of add ons and options for your burger is at least 25 options and they are all well thought out.  There are several other options besides the burgers including Mac n cheese salads and even a black bean burger and a special burger of the month too. 

Washed it down with a Sioux City Berry Berry Soda. ( yep Berry Berry ). Dan prides himself for his selection of gourmet sodas and there are about twenty to choose from various specialty providers. Having used up all my alcoholic drink tickets long ago, a thoughtful selection of non alcohol beverages is rare and much appreciated. 

Note there is an extensive list of craft beers and  a very special whiskey menu for your enjoyment. 

Now the dessert review.....i have not met Brenna yet.... She is the master chef here and resident pastry goddess of Brookfield and greater Chicago area.....I almost sent a marriage proposal to Brenna after eating half of a homemade , made to order , warm ,succulent and savory Honey Maple Bacon donut. I decided not to propose only because Dan seems like a great guy and my buddy &amp; I had a great conversation with him about Burger Antics. My current wife also may.... may have an objection also. 

Dan and Brenna are the bomb!  I&#39;m already
planning for my next Burger Antic attack!  I can&#39;t wait to Go back!"

Soooo good!!!

My BF and I have heard good things about this place... So before watching the Blackhawks in a sports bar (Sanctuary right across burger antics -- review is next ) We had to eat early dinner. 

The only flaw..... Had to take one star away because.....

No one even greeted us... The servers were just looking but not welcoming

We just decided to sit ourselves... A few minutes later.... Our server... Cameron introduced himself and gave us a lil spiel .... He was nice but everyone should be nice.... 

There must have been 4-5 servers total, including the bartender? I mean this is a very small place.... 

When you open the door.... You can see everyone ....
Would it kill the bartender or other servers to say Hi? Or was it because I&#39;m Asian and my BF is Black? Smh.... 

This was our first time here and THAT first impression wasn&#39;t good at all.... But hey .... Good food always make things better.... 

And that&#39;s what they have!!!


We ordered the ff:

Fried pickles 4/5

Hotter than Hell 5/5 -- juicy, moist and cooked to perfection accdg to my BF who wanted it medium rare.

3 Samplers ( bbq bacon cheddar, mushroom Swiss, 4cheese burger ) -- love this platter... Was able to try most of the burgers and they&#39;re all juicy and had their own flavor -- 5/5

Maple Bacon Doughnut -- 5/5 -- this is just heavenly... Not too sweet not to salty -- warm and doughy..... Love love it

We spent less than $60... Wow... What a treat!!! 

Dan, spent some time with each table, saying hello to patrons and spent time with us as well. Great guy!!!

We will be back!!!"

We started with bloody mary&#39;s; Burger Antics makes their own bloody mary mix and it&#39;s great. They add a pickled asparagus spear, a green olive, and a lime. It&#39;s a really nice combination; you can really taste the pickling spices!

Then we shared a maple bacon donut as an appetizer. Not to be missed! The donut is warm. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The maple glaze is excellent and there&#39;s just enough bacon on it. Just when I thought I was past the bacon craze, this donut convinced me to come back to it!

For an entree, I ordered off the special brunch menu. I cannot recall the name of what I ordered, but it was a traditional Irish breakfast. Corned beef (sliced nice and thin), a hard-boiled egg, excellent Irish cheddar and apple slices, some amazing pickled slaw, and warm and chewy brown bread. Not at all what I was expecting to order at a burger place, but so glad I did. It was terrific!

The staff was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. The art on the wall is a really nice touch. We were also pleasantly amused by the Weird Al movie playing on the televisions.

This was my first trip to Burger Antics. I&#39;m about to move to Brookfield and will definitely be back!"

I&#39;d compare them to a slightly plainer version of Kuma&#39;s. They use the same style pretzel bun and the patties are cooked very well. I asked for a medium and they hit the nail on the head. It was right in the pink department and not to mention so juicy. I built my own since I couldn&#39;t decide which one to get. I added everything I wanted from each burger. So the burgers were overall great. But let me tell you... The donut was amazing!!!!! I&#39;m not huge on maple anything, but the maple was just right on sweetness. The donut itself was freshly fried so it came out piping hot. And the crunchy bacon added just the right amount of sweetness!!! Wow! I was stunned by how delectable this doughy critter was.

We had shared the mac and cheese for the table and it was yummy! You can add some sides in there such as bacon but we went as purists and just had the cheese. Save your cheese if you have any left over for your fries. 

I went with the BBQ cheese bacon burger with a fried egg and it did not disappoint. Burger was cooked perfect and had the right amount of bbq sauce. Not over flowing but ran out a little towards the end. 

A friend had the special salad which was mixed greens, goat cheese and roasted beets. I of course tried some and it was great! 

My only reason for giving a 4 stars instead of 5 was that I had asked for a firmer egg so it wasn&#39;t so runny and for their chips, I got fries instead. I know I&#39;m being picky here but that&#39;s just me. 

Overall this was a good place and I would recommend it for sure!"

We&#39;ve been toying with the idea of stopping here because it&#39;s  near Brookfield zoo where we&#39;re members, but never made it. Since it was national cheeseburger day, we thought this was the perfect opportunity. We were right! My hubby had the hot as hell burger and I had a BBQ bacon burger. Both were cooked to perfection and delicious. The fries were wonderful and the housemade ketchup was outstanding and an attention to detail we don&#39;t see often enough. Even the pickle spear was good! We took half home and had it for dinner too.  I look forward to going back on a Sunday to try their interesting and ever changing brunch menu.

Goodness gracious, it truly is a great macaroni and cheese.  Very creamy and cheesy, unlike any other Mac and cheese I&#39;ve had.  My children weren&#39;t too fond of it so guess who ended up winning that battle of cheesy goodness?

I ordered the BBQ Bacon substituting a black bean burger and omitting the bacon. You can never go wrong with grilled onions on a burger!  The fresh cut fries are well made and perfectly seasoned.  I was too stuffed to order dessert, but I&#39;m sure that rocks!

When I saw they were finally re-opening AND it is *literally* 1.5 miles from our house, I could not have been more excited. 

The day we went, we arrived around 5:45 PM, and I am very glad that we did. There were maybe two tables with people but by the time we left the place was almost packed. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the beers on tap. They had a handful of different wines as well as a variety of custom cocktails. I knock them down a half star for serving my moscow mule in a regular glass. I know it makes me a bit of a cocktail elitist but one of the best things about the drink is how cold it remains in the copper mugs that remind me of my grandma&#39;s house. They do get props for serving with Tito&#39;s though.

We each ordered a slider plate and a basket of fries to share. Personally, I found the fries to be oversalted (minus the other half a star). The boyfriend loved that they used their own homemade ketchup so much that I didn&#39;t get a chance to even try any! I tried the 4 Cheese burger, mushroom and swiss without the mayo, and BOTW the Kapow minus the fried egg. I was disappointed that when they took away the egg they also took away the Sriracha but to the chef&#39;s defense, I didn&#39;t ask for it to be replaced. Each slider was served on a mini pretzel bun with the meat prepared medium well. I found medium well to be the perfect cooking length. The burgers were still really juicy and flavourful. I didn&#39;t feel like anything was missing from the actual sandwich itself. The combinations in the flavours were out of this world. I found the slider plate to be incredibly filling in itself and was asking myself &#34;Can you make it through this third mini-burger? YES, YOU CAN!&#34; 

NOTE: Because we each wanted to try the BOTW as an option on our slider plates, there was an upcharge of $1 for each slider plate.

Before we arrived, I happened to see a photo of the desert of the month - a raspberry cheesecake trifle. It is this delicacy of Godliness. Chunks of Angel Food Cake, raspberry sauce, raspberries, and a cheesecake filling made to look pretty in a desert cup. This is the most delightfully, amazing so much so that we each scarfed down our own.

As we are waiting for our check, Boyfriend says to me &#34;we will definitely come back here. This place is so good!&#34; Yes, we definitely will as Burger Antics has reinvented burgers for us."

We got there probably around 12:30 on a Saturday &amp; the place was fairly busy.   VERY eclectic/edgy inside with burnt orange walls, local artists paintings and painted skateboards (for sale, mind you) adorning the walls.  They also have about 15-20 tables all with dark wood finishes.  We were quickly greeted by our waitress, Stacy and were given the option to sit wherever we&#39;d like, so we took a bar height table up against the wall since I like sitting at that height, being slightly taller than average at 6&#39;2. 

We were given the menus, which were essentially a one page document (front &amp; back) with some very tasty, edgy choices.  The menu matched the decor essentially with some edgy/eclectic but great options.   They have a decent craft beer selections, nice variety of their own mixed drinks, regular fountain pop &amp; some craft pops for lack of a better term. Knowing we were going to an arcade, I opted for a Diet Coke (shocking I know, if you&#39;ve read my reviews).  Kelly went with a Caramelized Bacon cream soda. After perusing the menu, I figured I gotta dance with the girl that brought me.  They have about 8 house special burgers &amp; then you can make your own.  One thing I didn&#39;t like was if you make your own burger, everything costs extra (ketchup, mustard, lettuce, etc).  I get it since it&#39;s all house made but c&#39;mon.  Standard burger condiments should be free.   I went with their 4 cheese cheeseburger with provolone, pepper jack, muenster &amp; fried mozzarella and fries. Kelly went with Buff N Bleu Burger, essentially a bacon &amp; bleu cheese burger with choice of mild or hot buffalo sauce and fries. 

While we waited for our food, Stacy would come by &amp; chat, see how we were doing, etc.  She was outstanding  the whole time.  Drinks were never empty,  She was very friendly.  When we said we were new, she told us what was great on the menu, told us portions were larger than average, etc.  She made the experience even better for us. 

The burgers came out about 30 minutes after we ordered.  We were a little put off by the wait since it wasn&#39;t that crowded when we arrived &amp; it&#39;s only a 9 oz burger &amp; fries.   Thankfully, the burgers were WELL worth the wait!! Cooked to perfection on a pretzel bun that was a thinner pretzel bun than we&#39;re used to seeing, extremely flavorful, etc.  I inhaled mine in about 4 nanoseconds....which is slow for me. I wanted to savor the experience. It was awesome.  Kelly said hers was VERY good as well.  There were big hunks of bleu cheese, bacon was very flavorful &amp; thick, buffalo sauce was just right.   To us, the burgers were remarkably similar, both in size &amp; taste, to Kuma&#39;s Corner and priced about the same, if not cheaper.  Given the edginess/attitude in both the decor &amp; the menu, it made us wonder if a disgruntled Kuma&#39;s employee/cook worked there.   The fries were hand cut &amp; excellent.  Fried just right, still potatoey, soft yet with some crunch at times, salty...yum!!  The fries came with their home made ketchup.  It was good, but  I&#39;d have liked it a bit less sweet, a bit thicker and served warm.  It came out cold. 

Since my meal was finished in about 20 nanoseconds (4 for the burger, 16 for the fries since there were alot), I waited for Kelly to finish her meal.  As she noshed on her fries, there was a hair connecting 2 fries.  Didn&#39;t stop her from finishing the fries, other than follically-attached two.  When we asked for our check,  we made a point to tell Stacy about the hair.  She apologized profusely, went back to discuss with the manager &amp; they gave us 15% off our bill, which was fine by us.  As we waited for our check, a pair of guys at the table next to us ordered their maple bacon donut.  O....M....G!  It looked AWESOME and was huge.  Stacy came back with our check &amp; we asked about it.  She said they ARE awesome, made of a funnel cake batter and one of their top sellers.  The guys said they were $5 but WELL worth it.  Since we were full of burger, pops &amp; fries, we said we&#39;d get that next time.  

All in all, it was a very enjoyable experience for us, hair fries notwithstanding.  It&#39;s not a 5 star rating but a solid 4.5. It was VERY similar, quality wise, to a Kuma&#39;s Corner just without the heavy metal music. (which I&#39;m a fan of) Good price point, very good service, etc.  We will most definitely be back when we&#39;re in the area!"

I would rate Burger Antics higher if there was better seating and/or takeout. The building is really small, and the tables leave something to be desired. They also don&#39;t take reservations, which is understandable. If you&#39;re looking for a quality gourmet burger, look no further."

Went here for the first time last night.  It&#39;s a small space and at 6:30 on a Saturday night it looked packed.  We were told it would only be a 10 min wait and amazingly it was.  My sister and I each ordered the Hotter than Hell burger and my nephew got the mac and cheese.  The food was all wonderful.  The burgers were juicy and flavorful. There was a perfect amount of heat mixed with avacado and gouda to balance it out. It came on  a tender pretzel bun that was able to hold it all together. They came with lots of fries that were cooked and seasoned to perfection. The mac and cheese was creamy and delish.  They have a great assortment of soda and beer.   Although they were packed the whole time we were there, the server was attentive.  The only down side of the evening is that we didn&#39;t save room for dessert.  But we can easily fix that by going back again!"

Unfortunately I left extremely disappointed.
We visited on a Sunday morning and was not informed of their brunch options, only learning about their offered brunch after ordering our burgers from a slim selection.
I opted for their black &amp; bleu burger, which was huge and topped with delicious fried onion straws. The patty itself was not good at all, lacking seasoning and seemed overcooked and dry. It reminded me of bad meatloaf. I ordered the patty medium well and perhaps that is where I went wrong. For any future customers I advise you to order your burger medium.
Additionally, their homemade ketchup is not good and tastes like salsa."

Start with a professionally trained chef who&#39;s passionate about serving a transcendent product and add a proprietary blend of fresh, never frozen cuts of beef that are ground together to make the juiciest and most delectable hamburger you will ever find. Easier to get into than Kuma&#39;s and a better value than Owen &amp; Engine, Brenna&#39;s burgers are just outstanding.   Her menu offers 6 different riffs on the base burger with an option to build our own.  Add to those a burger of the week and a burger of the month that serve as creative outlets to the chef&#39;s inventive mind.  I recently had one with kangaroo chorizo, pickled beet and grilled pineapple, topped with a fried egg. Who does that?  

Burgers are also offered in a more modest 6-oz size for lunch and if you can&#39;t decide on one, you can get any 3 as a slider combo plate for just $10.  The menu is rounded out with a selection of soup, salad,  apps and sides that equally reflect the kitchen&#39;s creativity with new items appearing all the time.   

The proprietors put their 16 taps to very good use, offering an always interesting selection of american craft brews covering the full palette of styles from pilsners to imperial stouts.  They also feature a surprisingly wide selection of artisinal bourbons.  Be sure to save room for desert.  There&#39;s always pie but for my money, you can&#39;t beat the maple bacon donut with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.   Its crisp outside, soft and tender inside with  a sweet maple glaze and salty bacon crumbles.  A great combination of hot, cold, sweet and salty all in one package.  I&#39;ve sampled loads of bacon laced confections but never found another that is made to order and served hot with ice cream."

I had the mushroom swiss and he had the 4 cheese. The meat was cooked to perfection. Every bite was mouthwatering. My bf and I were in our own little world while we dug into these heavenly burgers, not a word was said.

Tonight, my boyfriend and I decided to walk here and try it out. I was pleasantly surprised, and we will definitely be back!

The restaurant itself is warm and inviting. The burgers... Absolutely amazing! I tried the three mini burgers, because I wanted to sample several of their unique burgers. I have ZERO negative comments - completely satisfied. The fries were also very good. They have a variety of speciality beers, whiskeys and sodas (I had an orange creme soda that tasted like a dreamsicle - so good! - and I&#39;m normally a beer drinker).

The only thing we didn&#39;t like was the ketchup. It&#39;s too sweet and cinnamony for our liking. We also weren&#39;t a fan of the fried pickles... They weren&#39;t terrible, but they weren&#39;t good either.

Overall, excellent! I will definitely recommend it to friends :-)"

The wings were amazing and they even let us split the sauces with BBQ and hot.  I wanted so bad to try the dessert but we were too full.  The meal was a complete, identical do-over from the last time we ate there.

The restaurant was pretty busy for a weekday but not too crowded and we were able to grab a table right away.  The food came out relatively quickly.  Server was the same woman we had on our first visit and she was pleasant.

If you&#39;re going to have a big pub burger, you want a bang for your caloric buck and this delivers. Everything was perfect, from proportion of bun to meat to the topping ration (I had the Midland). House made pickles were perfection. My only qualm is with the ketchup. It just is a bit weak and thin. I like housemade stuff, but sometimes you must defer to the master and in this case Heinz rules. Cole slaw is thicker than I like, almost like a chunky cabbage salad, but it was refreshing and I think they intend it to be this way. 

Beer list was absolute perfection. It isn&#39;t a giant tap list but it is well chosen with a great deal of variety. That this is a labor of love is eminently clear. If this was by my house we&#39;d be many pounds heavier."

This burger joint is a very small space. It has a bar in the back and they offer a good variety of craft beers and a good Moscow mule.  The burgers are extremely well made, creative and delicious.  The names of their burgers are very entertaining and the combos of what they put on the bun is amazing. They even have a PBJ burger!  We started out with the fried pickles as an appetizer. I decided to have sliders which you can choose three different burgers from their offerings. I went that route to sample more than one. My husband ordered their special fried onion burger, but they ran out. He was disappointed. How do you run out of onions, meat and a bun?  The three sliders I chose were so good...the mushroom Swiss is pretty standard, the Hotter Than Hell was a little less hot as I skipped the habaneros but oh so good, and my favorite the Buff and Stuff was full of flavor and a kick. The only negative I can say is the burgers were well done probably because of the size, so next time I would request the sliders to be cooked less.  My husband&#39;s full size burger was beautifully cooked at a medium rare.  All burgers are served on a pretzel bun and their sauces and ketchup are made from scratch. You can also get any burger with chicken or a vegan patty.  I will definitely be back because I have to get their mac n cheese as I was eyeing it on the table next to us and it looked so creamy.  I love this place!!"

I had their steak taco. It is flavorless. This place has great reviews so the first time I had I thought the were just having a bad day. Second time I tried I was upset for trying again. Now the third time I&#39;ve tried is a year later from the last time. It&#39;s been so long I forgot why I didn&#39;t like this place. Each time it&#39;s the same issue. Flavor! Even the guac I ordered was flavorless. I&#39;m starting to question the authenticity of some of their reviews.

They unfortunately took out the special on Sundays, but it&#39;s not too bad for $5. 

The atmosphere of the place could use some updating, but it wasn&#39;t too bad. Seemed like they kept the same furniture since they opened.

The service was okay. We waited in the front to be seated for about 5 minutes. The place was empty so it was weird that they didn&#39;t notice us waiting.

The food is kind of expensive from what I&#39;m used to in the Northwest Suburbs. A steak taco dinner (3 tacos, rice, and beans) was $10.75. They had another taco dinner option, but it didn&#39;t include steak as one of the meat options which was 9.75$. Typically around my area a taco dinner is around $7-$8. 

The taste was okay. The soup that comes with every meal was very good and nice it was included with the entree.

Chips and salsa to start, which were good. Not stale as most say. I mean, chips are naturally hard, doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re stale. 

As most say, margaritas are amazing. Half price margaritas on Saturday; strawberry ones are delicious. 

I had the chicken flautas and tried some chicken fajita quesadilla also. The chicken was great. Fresh, well seasoned. The rice and beans, well, we&#39;re identical to every other Mexican place. Not a bad thing! Just funny how rice and beans are the same every Mexican place. 


Overall, the service was great. Waitress and busboy were really nice and made sure we were satisfied. Food was fresh and came promptly after ordered. After we finished eating, the chef/owner asked us how our meal was to see if we were satisfied as well, which we were. It&#39;s nice seeing him care about his patrons being happy.

-complimentary chips and salsa (chips were good and seemed home made!)
-they had an option of fresh jalapeños or pickled jalapeños for my burrito which i really appreciated!

Cons:
-i would say the food just wasn&#39;t that impressive, kind of really standard (i definitely needed to salt my food)
-salsa wasn&#39;t hot at all and not much flavor

The restaurant is clean and the service was wonderful. Our waitress was very attentive."

The carne asada is the most tender around. The margaritas are huge...and contain plenty of alcohol...compared with what most Mexican restaurants give you.  The owner (Mario) is great...and Jose (at the bar) makes the experience amazing.  My new Mexican gem.....

I don&#39;t typically gravitate towards many traditional Mexican restaurants but this one had killer reviews so I had to give it a go.  Glad I did!

We were greeted at the door by a lady I can only assume is the owner&#39;s wife, very pleasant lady and we we&#39;re immediately seated.  The ambiance is pretty typical for a traditional Mexican place, brightly colored walls with a very southwest feel.  It was somewhat dark in the entire restaurant as well.

The salsa was served in a cute little carafe (first time I&#39;ve seen this) and was good. B.  Not great though, a little too hot for me and kind of plain.  I compare all salsas to Uncle Julio&#39;s FYI !  The tortilla chips were warm and obviously homemade. A.  Very tasty!

PIVOTAL MOMENT ALERT -  As we were finished ordering a  very polite Mexican man (obviously the owner) approached the table and asked if we would like a complimentary bowl of chicken and shell soup.  We obliged.  Soup was very good.  A.  
       I have the utmost respect for restaurant owners who mingle with the diners.  You can bet that a restaurant is run well when the owner loves what he does enough to want to know his customers personally.  I have had similar experiences as other places (see reviews for Mr. Benny&#39;s Steak and Lobster in Mokena &amp; Issaco in Saint Charles) and it really separates out the well run restaurants from the others.

I ordered the Steak Enchiladas Suizas.  A.  I felt that the steak was prepared perfectly, the rice didn&#39;t stick together and the beans were very tasty.  The cheesy enchilada sauce was unreal.  Good call for my first meal here.

My wife ordered the lunch portion steak mini fajitas.  A+.  The steak was again very well prepared and the sauteed onions and peppers were seasoned to perfection.  The portion was huge for $6.99!!

       While we were eating the owner came to our table again and asked how the meal was and we told him &#34;great&#34;.  He then asked if we&#39;d eaten there before and we said no, but we read great reviews and had to experience Loco&#39;s first hand.  He then joked that the reviews were all family members and we had a good laugh.  He was a very easy man to talk to and you could again tell that he loved what he does. 

Overall, great experience.  I will return again asap but hope to come back after work so I can give some of these margarita specials a run through!!!!"

There are a few Mexican restaurants in Joliet, and I would choose Loco&#39;s over most of them, especially if I was looking for a quiet place to enjoy a nice meal.

Tonight, we had the enchiladas verdes and the steak fajita quesadilla. The tomatillo sauce on the enchiladas was tangy with just the right amount of spice. The steak in the quesadilla was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.

The prices are reasonable and the service has always been good. The owner is very personable and checks on the satisfaction of his guests.

Recommend you check it out."

I ordered the Carne Asada and the steak was outstanding!  Steak was bigger and thicker than the local competition.  I ordered it medium and it was very tender.  Would only suggest that they add a small jalapeño pepper for additional flavoring.  I would imagine you could request that.  The steak taco was also very good.  Ordered it with lettuce, tomato, cheese, cilantro and onion.  The chicken tostadas were just ok.  Would have been better if the chicken was shredded and seasoned with more flavor. Supposedly the chicken fajitas are seasoned differently. Next time I would ask if they could put the fajita chicken on the tostada. The shell held up strong. Margaritas are 1/2 price on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturdays. The Large frozen strawberry margarita was HUGE..about the size of my wives head.  Not sure how we finished it...but we did.  Owner was very nice and gave us a brief tour as we left ...showing us the bar area.  We will definitely be back!"

Next time I may try something different and get a side of the tomatillo sauce to slather on everything we order. Shrimp burrito was fresh with large tasty shrimp. We enjoyed the carafe of salsa with individual dipping bowls &amp; warm chips. The frozen peach margarita really topped it off nicely.

I couldn&#39;t believe they had margaritas half off on a weekend night! This is practically unheard of and these were SO GOOD. Ordered a strawberry on the rocks and was perfect. Can&#39;t wait to try more. I ordered the giant chicken fajita quesadilla and it was so delicious. Chicken was good quality and perfectly seasoned. It was served with beans, rice, and guacamole. Couldn&#39;t speak more highly. The service was great and the owner even came to our table to asked how we liked it. He also informed us that you can order tacos for take out for only $1.99. Great!

We went on a weekday evening, around dinner time, but aside from one guy seated at the bar, we were the only people here.  It could have been the weather (one of the first bitterly cold days here), or it could be that there are just better places to eat in the area.

Starting with the chips and salsa, well, I&#39;ve definitely had better.  They were okay, but the chips were thick, and the salsa was watery.  Hungry like the wolf, we devoured them anyway, but I wasn&#39;t left wanting more.

The $4 margaritas were really good!  I had the peach - okay, I had two of the peach - and I really liked these.  I wasn&#39;t knocked off my seat drunk or anything like that, but it was a good margarita.

I also had the chile relleno, which was also really good.  The batter wasn&#39;t too thick and was cooked perfectly.  Tons of cheese oozed out, as a proper chile relleno should!  

Entrees are served with beans and rice, but I was shocked that they do not offer black beans.  I don&#39;t like refried beans, so I had double the rice.  The rice was good, but nothing special.

The service is tolerable.  The mood of the busboy and our server matched that of the weather.  Dreary.  They took our order, but their people skills could use some sharpening - no &#34;welcome to Loco&#39;s,&#34; no &#34;how are you?&#34; nothing like that.  It felt like the owner&#39;s ungrateful children were working here as punishment for doing something wrong.

Loco&#39;s is great for the $4 margaritas, and they have specials every night of the week, but I probably wouldn&#39;t come here again.  There are so many Mexican restaurants throughout the suburbs (especially Joliet) that Loco&#39;s doesn&#39;t warrant a second visit for me."

My cousins and I came here from time to time and weren&#39;t left unimpressed from all the delicious things to choose from. They offer complimentary chips and salsa, and delicious soup on the house! Hefty portions, and when Mario (The owner) realized how much I loved the soup, he brings a large bowl of it for me, and even after my meal, he gave me a large cup to go! My favorite things from here are the steak tacos and tamales! Also my cousin loves their tortas! I also love their mexican rice and beans (who doesn&#39;t?). The owner even specially makes things for us! It&#39;s gotten to the point on where he brings sour cream out with my salsa because he knows how much I love them together! This place has great mexican food, and their guac is even better!

The food is amazing. My only wish is that they stayed open later. Burrito Express used to be open until 3am on the weekends.

I always order the Huevos Y Chorizo burrito. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s actually on the menu but it used to be at BE and that&#39;s where I got addicted to it. The owner has told me that I&#39;m the only person who orders it so he makes sure he has eggs on hand in case I come in. If that&#39;s not personalized service I don&#39;t know what is. Also, if anyone actually reads this, why am I the only person who order it? You should fix that. Yes, you.

I also tend I drown everything I order in their red hot sauce. It is VERY hot and I use way more than is healthy but damn is it good. I pour a little bit on each bite of my food. I put an entire container on each taco and about 4 containers per burrito. I even mix some in with the regular salsa for the chips. It&#39;s amazing.

Every night there seems to be a special and that is pretty fun, can&#39;t wait till my kids are here for next monday when they eat for free, with an adult meal purchase.  Also the margaritas ar only $4 and worth it.  

The food is solid and I know will be agreable with my children too, but that is not the magic.  The staff are respectful and it is obvious the customer is the importabt one here.

The chips they served tasted like they were fried in rancid oil and the same with the beans that came out with our meal. The soup they served was like spicy water with over cooked pasta shells and the peach daiquiri was too sweet. We had chicken fajitas and tamales. The fajitas came with flour tortillas and a very sad condiment plate leaving much to be desired. The chicken was tough. The tamales were delicious but came with the funny tasting refried beans and dry, flavorless rice. The staff has potential but they kept checking on us to the point of annoyance.

The fact that you get chips and salsa and a cup of soup complimentary when dining in, says a lot about the service here.  They have excellent, attentive service.

The location is unassuming, inside a strip mall, but the decor and service are fantastic. The waitstaff was very attentive, and I believe we were served margaritas by the owner himself.

As for the food - we started with nachos. Plenty of the good stuff on these: cheese, meat, beans, guacamole, and just enough sour cream, but not so much the chips got soggy. I made a meal of these nachos before my entree arrived.

My wife had enchiladas Rojas and I had enchiladas verdes. Definitely the most flavorful enchilada sauces we&#39;ve had. Mine had a rich, citrusy taste. I have no doubt both were prepared fresh - a major plus!

Did I mention half price margaritas on Saturday? Oh hell yes. Not watered down - just perfect.

This place has made it into my permanent rotation."

I need to preface by saying Mexican cuisine is one of my least favorite. I believe it is because so many places are butchering the cuisine. Here I actually really enjoyed my meal. It&#39;s REAL Mexican food. Not the cheap knockoff you find at most &#34;Mexican&#34; restaurants and chains.  I actually like the decor unlike another reviewer. It makes you feel like you are eating at a friends house in Mexico. The staff was extremely attentive and super friendly. I mean, our drinks were refilled at least 6 times. Hey, we were thirsty! An extra bonus was the free soup. My partner said the broth tasted exactly like the soup is grandma made growing up. Gotta love a little nostalgia and comfort food! I had floutas and my partner had a burrito. Everything tasted fresh and made to order, and the portions are huge. They both came with beans and rice on the side. I also ordered queso for an appetizer. Our total ticket was $34.50 before tip.  The owner was so nice. He asked how our experience was before we left. He seem genuinely concerned that we had a great meal and quality service.   This will be our go to for our Mexican food cravings. AND they deliver. That&#39;s the best news. Check this place out, I&#39;m confidant it will become one of your favorites! Oh, tacos are 99 cents on Wednesdays. Happy eating!"

Chips were warm, salsa is waterey and mild, even my wife thought so.  Cup of soup was good.  I had the steak fajitas, wife had enchiladas, son had steak burrito.  Fajitas were good, the rest of our food was meh.  

Good thing it wasn&#39;t crowded as they only had one waiter working.  We waited a long time for our check.  Finally an older gentlemen who I assume was the owner  came over and asked if I was waIting for my bill.  He apologized profusely telling me he gave a waitress the night off.  Why tell me this?  So you are intentionally short-staffed on a Saturday evening?  

Overall the meal was nothing special, not sure why so many 4 and 5 star reviews."

The free soup was the best part of the meal. Very good soup. I ordered the chorizo tacos which also good. The rice was decent but the refried beans were less than average. Once again everything was decent but the beans.

Went back and the restaurants food was better. Added a star!!"

That may be, in part, because there was nothing &#34;special&#34; (good or bad) that stood out about those places, but still, since I appreciate reading about &#34;average&#34; experiences as well as good and bad, I feel I owe it to my fellow-Yelpers to write about the same.  So starting today, I&#39;m going to try and cover &#34;everywhere&#34; I go, even if the words don&#39;t flow with inspiration...

So with an average Yelper&#39;s rating of 4.5, I was hoping this place would do a little more for me than it did.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, both my son and I enjoyed our take-away junior burrito and tostada dinners.  But that&#39;s it.  Nothing special.  Nothing excellent.  Nothing bad either.  Nothing worth driving 30 minutes for, but a definite &#34;go back and try sit down along with a Margarita with the wife&#34; the next time we&#39;re in the area."

Sunday evening, 6:30 and the place has 2 other couples and a single man sitting at the bar. 

We were met and asked where we wanted to sit. I said table and we get a booth. Ok, so the host/busboy/waiter didn&#39;t hear me. After we sit down, he asked  what we wanted to drink. My dinner companion ordered a regular margarita on the rocks with salt. I ordered a frozen with no salt.  So came back with salsa and chips. Now, the chips were warm but also a tad stale. The salsa was on the hotter side ( a nice good bite to it) but if I didn&#39;t like hotter salsa&#39;s I&#39;d be sucking down water. 

The host/busboy/waiter brings our drinks and starts to set them down. Oh wait...Mine is wrong. He brought me a regular over rocks with salt. I said, this isn&#39;t what I ordered , it was frozen with no salt. He apologized and about 4 minutes later comes with my drink.  About them both my dinner companion and I agreed they were heavily syrup with little alcohol in them. If you love extremely sweet margaritas this is the place.   

As for dinners, I went with the simple Loco Nachos with steak and my companion ordered a taco salad. While it didn&#39;t take long for the food to come out, given how empty the place was, I would have expected the waitstaff to come around and check up on us. No refills of water, offer to refill chips...we just sat there and conversed before the food arrived.

Oh the food.....Taco salad bowl was burnt. ( I really should have taken a picture) We kinda laughed and said, they must have been in a hurry to watch the cartoons blaring on the TV in the bar area. As for my Nachos, now I understand using colby/cheddar is the norm for us here in America, but if this place is trying to be true mexican, then please try using Queso Chihuahua instead.  While not bad, I would not go out of my way to order them again. The more I think of it, the more it really tasted like velveeta.  

Overall, we both agreed this was just 1 step up from fast food and not a place worth visiting again."

After reading all the 4 and 5 star reviews I felt confidant enough to recommend Loco&#39;s to my mom and her husband for date night. They went in on a Friday night and were beyond impressed. I&#39;d like to add that my mother hates just about everything BTW, so her raving review had me running in the next day. Went on on a Saturday afternoon and there were 3 other tables seated in the dining area. I was greeted in a friendly and prompt manner and my drink order was taken immediately. From the reviews I knew I wanted the peach margarita but raspberry sounded just as enticing. I asked if I could mix flavors and the gentleman taking my order explained he would do it today but when it&#39;s busy some days they might not because it could get confusing. I hope that&#39;s not the case but I appreciated that they still mixed them. I had the &#34;fish bowl&#34; size or monster size as listed on the specials. I was very impressed with the taste of the margarita. Freshness seems to be a trend in this restaurant which I appreciate. Complimentary soup was delicious. I ordered chicken fajitas and my friend ordered steak fajitas. Both were served with rice, beans, lettuce, guacamole, and sour cream. Guacamole was very fresh. I would recommend ordering it as an appetizer although it may be overkill because they give you sooooo much food. My friend and I were full after just 1-2 fajitas. I made 3 large sized ones out of the leftovers so that&#39;s a good reference of how much food you get. Service was excellent, even though we waited a little bit for our check, but I didn&#39;t mind as I was still finishing my drink. Now here&#39;s the icing on the cake. My check was only $24 with taxes!!  Monster margarita- $9.99 chicken fajitas $10.95.This was music to my ears especially since La Mex must have recently upped their prices and I was very disappointed to see a $14 fish bowl margarita appear on my bill when they used to be $11 on 1/2 price days. I know it&#39;s not a huge jump but still... Anyways who cares about LM because I&#39;m never going back! Now that I found this gem called Loco&#39;s, I truly have no reason to.
TL DR: GO THERE! You won&#39;t regret it."

The homemade Salsa and fresh guacamole was amazing and probably some of the best we have had anywhere. We ordered the enchiladas and a combo of taco and tostada which were all phenomenal. The waitstaff was very friendly and attentive. We met the owner who was incredibly friendly. This place was amazing and we will be sure to stop here whenever we come this way.

The peach margarita was wonderful, as well as the warm chips and salsa.
Our waiter was fantastic.  Very friendly and helpful.
We both got the &#34;Three Amigos&#34; where you can choose the 3 items you would like.  The ground beef taco was both of our favorite. (We also had pork tamale, steak burrito, chicken flauta, &amp; chicken enchilada - all good!)  
The complimentary cup of soup was very flavorful &amp; the owner coming over to check on us was a nice touch.

The table I sat at had a hard, plastic covering that was cracked, and therefore, there was a large hole right where my plate sat. By the end of the night, I caught my shirt on it a couple times, and part of the plastic even chipped off at one point. The menus had crusty food on them, and no one was there to greet us when we walked in. Eventually, someone came to the hostess stand after a minute. My friend and I ordered enchiladas and fajitas, and both were OK. The beans were the best part. Overall, all the food lacked flavor. The rice was especially bland. For visiting on a Monday night, the service was not great, especially since the restaurant had many open tables. After we paid and left our bill sitting at the table, we continued to sit for 45 minutes and talked (something I typically wouldn&#39;t do at a restaurant, but again, there were MANY open tables). Our server did not ask to refill our drinks or even check with us that our bills were finalized. The manager (or owner?) checked in with us once throughout the evening, and he ran our credit cards for us at the end of the evening. That was appreciated. Maybe that&#39;s why our server never came back around. In the bathroom, there were no hooks for purses or jackets, and the toilet paper was not in the dispenser. Rather, the large roll was sitting atop the toilet. Gross. The bathroom smelled like a men&#39;s restroom (like a urinal cake.) There were at least three air fresheners in the two stall bathroom; what smell were they trying to cover up? There was a leaky pipe in the bathroom, as well, and to fix that, a high chair was jimmied under the sink with a rag on it. I hope that high chair will be thoroughly cleaned before being used by customers again. Many details were overlooked, and that just combines to an underwhelming experience. I won&#39;t be returning."

When it comes to portion, flavor, wow factor, the real value is in their large entrees. Expect them to have several seasonal off the menu specials. Spring 2016 I enjoyed a skirt steak with chimichurri and crazy good potatoes. My wife and I will definitely come back, as we live one block away, to dive straight into a main course, in effort to keep the bill under $100. We had the steak tartare. My wife had a meaty piece of salmon. We shared a $40 bottle of white. The bill was over $150...  Good date spot that could have you there for 2 hours for 3 courses, a bottle, and so-so service. I am not going to lay into this place about them being out of white bread, or the butter being too hard (we were seated outside on a 80 degree day and the butter never got soft!?) an updated review will eventually follow."

When you walk in, it appears to be tiny with no bar area but there is actually a bar area and an enclosed (or open in the summer) patio in the back.  We did not have a reservation but this was not a problem during the week.  We were sat immediately and our server was excellent.  Firstly, they swapped out white napkins for black since our pants were dark.  Secondly, our server walked us through the menu and wine list and made recommendations.  Thirdly, the food and wine list were very good and service all evening was outstanding.

We had to try the tartar, which was very good.  I had never had tartar with cucumber before but it also had a nice spice to it, which was cooled down by the creme fraiche.  I will definitely get it again.  On the recommendation of our server, I had the veal and it did not disappoint.  Suburb portion sizes so there was no way I could finish it.  The leeks and mushrooms were wonderful as well.  My husband got the steak frites, which was cooked perfectly and the frites were super tasty.  We decided to try the Pahlmeyer since I had not had it.  Overall nearly a 5 star and, if it is consistent (I tend to always round up for consistency), I will be upgrading eventually."

The reason for the one star review - there was a fingernail clipping in my husband&#39;s dessert. If that weren&#39;t bad enough, the way it was handled (or...not) was poor. After being told about the nail, our server pushed the fingernail around the table with a fork as if he were examining it, without a word. Then he said, &#34;OK, I &#39;ll take it off&#34; (meaning, the cost of the dessert). Absolutely no apology, nothing done to rectify the situation other than taking off the $7 (and, not that we wanted another dessert, but to not even offer a replacement?). That&#39;s not the way an &#34;upscale&#34; place handles customer issues."

Ambiance was just ok.... Just had dinner the previous weekend at Vincitori, which is right across the street.... A fine dining restaurant as well...they have a live band and a bit more darker and cozier....Perfect for date nights....

Anyways....My BF and I were seated and it took 12 minutes before Fabian (our server) even bothered to swing by ....

Didn&#39;t even introduce himself .... Just started blabbing the specials ...

Prior to this... We were just sitting...looking around.... My BF had to stand up and ask the hostess for a wine menu. Thumbs down !!!

There was maybe 12 tables in the main area.... And I see only two servers, Fabian and this other tall one.

I like the fact that they have a couple of bussers.,.. One that just refills water.... A crummer.... A busser who removes silverware and re-sets new ones...: another one who serves bread...


Our first issue-- serves cold butter .... But then the variety of sliced breads they serve is cold too...

I mean... It&#39;s either you serve warm bread and cold butter.... Or just serve EVOO and cheese with cold bread...

We ordered a bottle of Bila Haute Rhone $36...Its blended wine which is pretty good

Appetizer -- grilled calamari $14 ....3/5
Why? Flavor was definitely amazing.... One of the best I have had.... Soft texture and sweet ... What you expect from fresh seafood.... BUT was served cold.... Not even warm.... I mean.... I&#39;m assuming Fabian didn&#39;t get it to us fast enough, from the kitchen warming table???

Soup --- potato soup &amp; tortellini soup $8 each...3/5
Why? Again the flavor of both soups are just really outstanding .... And the busser assigned to pour the soup in front of us..... 
It&#39;s just a great presentation BUT both soups were both lukewarm.... Not even warm .... You expect soup to be at least borderline hot at least right?! 
So we were just disappointed coz it was really good flavor but would&#39;ve been phenomenal if served hot. Ugh!

Then we ordered our entrees:
I ordered short ribs: $25 4/5
My BF ordered scallops $28 4/5

Both were cooked perfect.... Short ribs was very tender and breaks apart easily... You know it&#39;s baked for a loooong time .... but lacks flavor....
My favorite short ribs is still Coopers Hawk (risotto short ribs.) Yum!

Scallops were grilled to perfection.... 
But both dishes..... Also were served just barely warm.... What&#39;s up with that?!!!!!

We didn&#39;t order dessert....

Our bill was $130 plus $30 tip.....Not bad with a bottle of wine 

Problem is... We didn&#39;t feel satisfied or didn&#39;t have that &#34;OMG, we will definitely come back amazing satisfied&#34; feeling...

We see another fine dining restaurant J Flemings.... Since we have tried Vincitori and Amber....
We are still in a quest for a really nice exceptional  fine dining experience ..... I will definitely yelp about that experience too...."

In fact, we figured it to be open for 10 years. In restaurant-dog years, that&#39;s a century. I was there for the first time on Friday, and I just don&#39;t get the positive reviews.

Unfortunately, we were sat at the table closest to the bar. If you want to actually hear the waiter speaking in broken English, request the front dining room. At one point, a group of Millennials jammed themselves into the space of two bar stools. They kept roaring over every event during a sporting event on the TV. Each time, they kept slamming back into our table. I looked over to see what was on, thinking that the excitement level warranted an Arena League Football game. However, it was a soccer match. I&#39;m thinking, are they that drunk, because nothing exciting happens during a soccer match.

As mentioned before, it took us a while to figure out whom actually was our server. It started with a pretty good busser. Then the bartender must have looked over, did I mention we were close to the bar? He took our opening order for wine. I started out with by the glass for cocktails and a bottle for dinner. They got that in reverse. Our by the glass came out last. During the bottle service portion, he kept putting wine glasses on top of our menus. 

Which brings me to the real weakness of Amber. There is zero table awareness. Our water glasses went so long empty, twice, I got up myself, went to bar, grabbed the pitcher and filled up our glasses. Remember, I was so close to the bar. We had to beg for a refill on bread. Olive oil would have been a nice option instead of solid butter that cut gapping holes through the bread. 

Again, bad table presence, I had to hold up dirty glasses for the staff to remove each time someone approached the table. One of the cocktail glasses remained on the table the entire night. 

I was so annoyed by the service, maybe the food was good. I do recall the Beet Salad. Apparently, it was Frisée Week at the produce market. I consider frisée the &#34;weed&#34; of the lettuce family. I don&#39;t get the appeal, it&#39;s used as a filler in prepackaged salad mixes. In this case, it should have been called &#34;Piled Mounds of Frisée with Essence of Beet&#34;. When you actually got to a beet, they were excellent. 

I don&#39;t get the buzz. Maybe the Hinsdale-Westmont markets are just so starved for decent dining, this is consider good. Sadly, it&#39;s another case of a talented chef with no FOH support."

Have been meaning to try Amber for some time as heard it was great and live in the area. Service very good, ambiance nice, and wine list has good options at variety of price points. Meatball appetizer with polenta was tasty and hearty. Beet salad was ok, nothing special. Short rib entree was cooked very well but the Asian influenced accompaniments were a little odd. Halibut special on top of a watermelon salad was disappointing. Fish very salty and cold diced watermelon and cantaloupe salad did not go well with fish at all. Server raved about it which is why we ordered it but very disappointing. Chocolate brownie dessert was solid although a little chocolate sauce along with caramel and bacon would have been a welcome touch. 

Overall had high expectations but left disappointed. Wine was the highlight of the meal and service was very good but food only okay and at this price point, would have been nice to leave really impressed."

I have been here several times with a 5-star review each time I go.  The menu changes enough to where if you like something its on there long enough for you to enjoy multiple times and also changes enough that you can try multiple things and never get bored.

I went there tonight with a friend of mine who had never been there and I assured her she couldn&#39;t pick a wrong item to eat as she will NOT be disappointed.  And, of course, I was right.  

She ordered the corn chowder to start which was decadent.  So creamy and flavorful.  I had never had chowder in general, but now I love it as I tasted hers and had to hold back from taking more!  I started with the watermelon gazpacho with lime and cucumber accents and it was garnished with watermelon sorbet.

This is truly a neighborhood gem that reminds me of Miami when it is warm out. We sat in the outside patio with white chiffon curtains and Spanish guitar playing (ignore the parking lot of course).
I started off with a ceasar salad, which was actually unique here because the romaine is grilled... Glad I tried it, but would like to try more things next time. For dinner, we got the short rib risotto and pan seated mahi mahi with tempura beans and mango salsa (both specials). The mahi was delicious and light, the risotto was average.
For desert, we got the &#34;lava&#34; cake... It wasn&#39;t a lava cake though. They just added chocolate sauce on top of a warm cake. That would be my primary gripe and that is what prevented it from being a 4 star.

Amber is quite the find located on Main Street, not far from the Metra line.  In fact- when I took a friend here on a recent trip to Chicago, he said, &#34;how you find these great little places is a mystery to me!&#34;.  

Well, it certainly isn&#39;t a mystery why this place has been in business since 2004.  It&#39;s because the food is good, the ambiance simple and charming and the service on it&#39;s game.

We came on a rainy Thursday night.  There is a large outdoor patio out back but know that it is enclosed and on warm nights- it can be a bit stifling back there.  So we chose to sit in the restaurant by the window looking out at the trains going by.

We started with a couple of appetizers- the grilled calamari and the lump crab cakes.  A perfect start to our evening.

We then split a bowl of the lobster bisque (one of my favorites) and then moved on to the halibut and salmon as our entrees with some garlic mashed potatoes as a side.  Everything was perfectly paced and delicious!  And for dessert- their daily bread pudding special was the right choice.

The ambiance is contemporary with dark floors and wooden furniture.  Parking is easy as there is street parking out front or a free lot to the south.  And dinner for two with drinks ran about $120.

Amber is that perfect place for a celebration, a reunion, or just a mid week dinner to catch up with friends.  A bit off the beaten track, but worth looking for."

It amuses me that this place has been successful cause I remember back in the day when downtown Westmont had nothing.... except Bishop&#39;s Chili. 

We ended up here after a nameless local indian resturant didn&#39;t understand we wanted to drink more and eat dessert.
 We sat in the back and had drinks. Got there about 7:30 pm on a weekday.

We ordered a $25 small lot bottle ( fyi, most of the $25 bottles are about $11 retail) and enjoyed several hours of siiting chatting.

The ambiance was truly amazing, you will not find anything similar in the Western suburbs (or at least I have not seen anything). The outside area is like a permanent tented area, the sides can come off during the summer months, and during the spring/fall they have heaters. The day was perfect for us, we did not need the heaters. 

The service was very good. We had approximately 30 women who were comfortably seated at 5 tables. The servers were attentive and polite. The price was very reasonable for excellent quality. We went with a package that included: an appetizer, salad (with an excellent balsamic vinaigrette), and a choice of 3 entree&#39;s that each woman was able to choose the day of. We chose to bring in our own deserts, which the establishment did not charge an additional fee for (in my research this is very rare, and was a great perk to this venue). 

The venue is quite unique, and has a classy elegant look to it, and really requires no additional decorating. However my bridal showers hostess&#39;s did add a few table flower centerpieces and wrapped the curtains in a red sting to go with their theme. 

As the bride, I had absolutely no complaints, and was so happy with the perfect venue, great food, and wonderful ambience. 
Also, the establishments manager/coordinator, was extremely easy to work with and very friendly. 

Also, they offered a great Chardonay, Painter Bridge...tasted great!

In my numerous visits to Amber, I have found the food unique (to suburban standards) and well-prepared. The grilled and chilled shrimp is one appetizer I recommend. For those unfamiliar with the dish, the shrimp is &#34;naked&#34; and cold, served with a dipping sauce. The sauce adds a light flavor to the mild shrimp. The baby spinach salad contains a rhubarb vinaigrette and strawberries, both really dressing up and flavoring this basic starter. It also has goat cheese sprinkled on it, which I could do without. The &#34;Chicken Parmesan&#34; is not what one would expect, and a little too creative for this simple diner. It consists of a medium-sized piece of grilled chicken, pesto, and a Parmesan crisp. The chicken itself was delicious and tender. They went a little light on the pesto for my liking, and I thought the Parmesan crisp was bizarre. It is a big, crunchy piece of cheese served with the chicken. I left most of mine on the plate. 

Cocktails and dessert are definitely big highlights here. I recommend a cocktail called the French Connection. This pink drink served in a martini glass has a nice raspberry taste. For dessert I think the molten chocolate cake is a must. It is always so soft, fresh, and rich. With a slight press of the fork, chocolate comes oozing out and is delicious. 

Amber offers a fancy and flavorful dining experience to this ordinary, ho-hum suburb. I recommend a visit."

We made reservations through opentable.com last minute on Saturday night. It was 6:30 when I made them, and the offerings were 7, 8 and something a lot later than 8. Because of this, I was expecting a decent crowd, because usually, you are offered multiple choices between the hours. However, when we arrived, there were only two tables occupied. They had a backroom where they have tvs and a bar set up, so we could hear people cheering the games that were on. Later in the evening, more people arrived. It seems more of a late dining crowd. 

We ordered the scallop risotto appetizer, the butternut squash curry soup, an arugula salad, the Halibut special with Jamaican BBQ spices and crisp whitefish with cous cous. The service was very attentive. They served olive oil with olives for dipping your bread. I have never seen that. What a great idea!! 

We skipped desert as nothing seemed to pop out. 

I would definitely return to this place. I wish it was in LaGrange. We could definitely use a nice non-italian place in the downtown area."

We ate there last Wednesday and had a very good experience.  Amber is a gem in the western burbs hidden in downtown Westmont.  I enjoy the finer cuisine in their relaxed atmosphere.  I had a delicious escolar (fish) and it came in an amazing sauce.  Only drawback was the service, being the night before valentine&#39;s they were unexpectedly busy which slowed down the service.  Also our waiter served our food to the wrong tale and they ate it (so odd!) which delayed our meal even further.  Oh well, still love Amber and will be back again."

When you walk inside, you&#39;re in a small room with maybe 20 tables, but it felt a little stuffy to me - too quiet, only a few tables occupied, too &#34;perfect&#34; and untouchable IMO.  The host let us choose our table, so I dragged my mom to the back room, which is even smaller with just a handful of tables and the small bar, but this was more my style - a little livelier just by virtue of having the bar there, and most of the tables and bar stools were occupied.  

Our waiter was also the bartender, and he was awesome and adorable.

I had the grilled octopus - fantastic - and one of the specials: skate with apples, swiss chard, and an espresso bbq sauce - totally unique, yummy, and so much fish I couldn&#39;t finish it all!

My mom had the lobster ravioli - our only complaint was that the sauce was too tomato-y for the lightness of the seafood, it overpowered that distinct lobster taste that we were waiting for, but it was still a good starter - and then she had the salmon with jasmine cake, ponzu sauce and veggies - excellent.  My mom is a sucker for (she might say connoisseur of) sweet potato fries, so we shared an order of those and they were great - crispier than others, which was a great surprise.  

We tasted the Zinfandel and the Croatian red (I think it was called Plavec?) but decided to go with the Malbec instead because we wanted something a little fuller, darker.  It was great.  And our waiter surprised us with white wine &amp; chocolate cocotions for dessert - delightfully indulgent and the perfect end to a wonderful meal.  Not a cheap dinner but for a special occasion this is definitely the place to go."

The food was tasteless, the room was noisy and the service was poor.  We went on a Saturday evening, and chose both fish and chicken.  While the chicken was moist, it was tasteless.  Laid on a bed of polenta, again, lacking any flavor.  

The whitefish was  &#34;fishy&#34; tasting.  The fish special, that was de-boned table side left a majority of the bones in the filet that was provided.  

The wait staff was &#34;pushy&#34; at first, and then we were ignored as the evening progressed.  When we voiced our complaints, there was no remorse and an apparent lack of concern for the customer.

I attended a bridal shower there on a Sunday afternoon and the atmosphere there for this event was just perfect.  We utilized the outdoor area that comfortably fit around 30 people (it looked like it would fit about 40 or so).  Very unique setting that almost looked like a garden!  The food options were great as well.  The key thing that stood out about the restaurant is the service.  Along with a few others, I co-hosted this shower for the bride-to-be and the owner/manager of the restaurant was more than accommodating (anywhere from answering all my e-mails to letting us decorate the place any way we liked).

Never thought I&#39;d find good sushi in these parts. The service was outstanding, the servers were super nice and pleasant. For appetizers, we tried the baby King Kong which had the perfect balance of creaminess and crunchiness. My husband ordered the Sake/Salmon Don which was great - it was $17 but it was a big portion, came in a huge dish and was beautifully-plated. I ordered the Double Salmon roll and Alaska roll and both were excellent; the salmon was fresh and buttery! They have their house salad listed on the menu for $4 but I believe the miso soup and salad comes free if you order sushi. I would double check though. Also worth pointing out that the prices are very reasonable! Almost, if not all of the special rolls are $10.50 each and the regular ones are $5 and up. If you&#39;re a huge sushi eater like my husband and I, then you know that is way cheaper than you would get at most restaurants. 

The ambiance is nice, pretty quiet. They added some decor and I think they tried to make the place look somewhat fancy but you can tell that the building is quite old. Nonetheless, I think this will be our new go-to sushi spot in the area."

An overdue review for one of my oldest bookmarked locales.  I don&#39;t mind driving a ways for great sushi, and a plus that Renita M and I could finally catch up a bit. 

Strip mall location. The restaurant is a little cramped and there&#39;s nothing special about the décor. In our section of the restaurant (there are two) it was pretty plain.  But clean. 

We ordered edamame to start but was pleasantly surprised that we each got salad and miso soup as well.  Our order was just some nigiri and maki so perhaps everyone gets the extras.  
I loved the ginger dressing--it was light and creamy and a nice change from many sushi houses where their ginger dressings are often over-powering.  The miso soup was pleasant--nothing too special. 

Our sushi choices were fresh and well-made. White Dragon Roll, California Roll and another I can&#39;t recall.  SWT, Red Snapper and a couple other nigiri pieces.  Our meal was satisfying and at a reasonable price.  

My son got the shrimp and veggie tempura appetizer for his dinner and he enjoyed it as well. 

Nice spot, friendly service."

Kinta had wonderful reviews so we decided to give it a go. It can be found in a strip mall along with a 7-11 and you&#39;re met with friendly workers inside.

Their bento boxes are mighty pricey! $17.50 for chicken but it sure comes with a ton of food! It might just be worth the hefty price tag as we pulled out box after box for the bento box portion of our meal. Their teriyaki chicken was decent though nothing I&#39;m over the moon over and just ever so slightly dry.

For my main meal I had a couple of their basic rolls - Spicy Tuna Roll and the Philly Roll. Their spicy tuna is quite spicy and comes with cucumber (not listed) but I liked it. Same goes for the Philly Roll - a solid option and I liked it just fine. Both were sloppily rolled though, not neatly/tightly done so they were falling apart a bit. 

All in all, Kinta Sushi is a viable option when in the area though I wouldn&#39;t make it a destination spot. Their sushi chef needs to tigheten up the game a bit, as well!"

The servers and sushi chefs are always smiling and gracious hosts, often bringing miso soup or a house salad with fantastic ginger dressing free of charge. 

I love the wakame salad and sashimi. Several rolls are stand outs: American Dream, Lady Roll, Terminate, and Volcano. Sake don is generous in amount of salmon and rice is usually very good. 

I&#39;ve never had a glass of sake, beer or wine here but I think it&#39;s adorable when you ask for a Coke and they bring out a tall glass of ice and cold can of pop."

Not only psyched but also shocked. My husband and I, if we could, would live on sushi all day every day 365 days a a year. But unfortunately my name isn&#39;t Kim and his name isn&#39;t Kanye ( or maybe rather FORTUNATELY) but either way we don&#39;t have the funds to eat sushi every day!

So we checked out the yelp reviews and pictures and gave it a shot. We ordered pickup. 

My favorite item was the jalapeño bomb. Those were delicious. I feel like pickup was not the best option for this place because the food was not as good as we had hoped. I think if we had been eating in and consumed the food as it was coming out freshly made then I would have liked it better. 

Some of the rolls were so big I could barely fit them into my mouth in one bite. The items tasted somewhat fresh. Everything was packaged very nicely as well. 

All in all, I would say it was an OK experience. Maybe we will give them one more chance when in town again and we will definitely dine in next time.

I ordered the Kinta Bento Box. You get a little bit of everything! They start you with miso and salad with ginger dressing. There were 2 spots that had steak and chicken with veggies. Then there was a spot with tempura veggies and shrimp. The last spot had 3 pieces of Nigiri and 6 pieces of Maki. It was way more than I could eat! I took the meat and veggies home for lunch the next day! Everything was fantastic though! The cooked items were perfectly done just to the right temp and the sushi was fresh.

The boy ordered the Beef Yaki Udon noodles. He also started with miso and salad with ginger dressing. The noodles were cooked nicely and had a great flavor of the beef! The steak was perfectly cooked too! It was delicious! 

This is a small place, so if customers linger at their tables you&#39;ll have to wait. It got really busy for a Friday night! They did quite a bit of take out while we were there! The servers were really sweet! We&#39;ll be back for sure! We&#39;ll even stop in for take out!"

My favorite time to grab take out is lunch time (1130-230). The bento boxes are the best lunch deal. I always get the tempura box which comes with California roll, deep fried sushi, deep fried tempura, salad, soup, and rice for only around $10.

I have a lot of dinner favorites as well. Some good appetizers are the M-80 and baby King Kong. If you like heavy sushi, you will love the King Kong (my favorite). I also recommend the terminate roll, spider roll, and deep fried spicy tuna!"

This fact is even more clear as some fish-centric restaurants are not open on Monday. After many lunch hour taste tests, credible colleagues have discovered that Kinta&#39;s fish is MOST FRESH in preparation for Monday lunch rush. Even more so than on a Thursday or Friday, We recommend visiting early in the week if you are in the neighborhood. Kinta typically does not disappoint.

I had one of the worst experience. I been going to kinta sushi from last four years. So with new management or new chef they are charging extra money for each substitute (vegetables). I asked substitute veggies for meat.  Vegetables are cheaper than meat. Technically they are not adding extra stuff on my sushi. I am still paying for meat still I am not going to eat that. I feel like they are just charging people extra money!

I didn&#39;t think twice about calling ahead and at the time, I do not think they had a website up with the hours of operation.  The times that I tried happened to be for lunch on a Saturday and dinner on Sunday. They are not open during these time. So make sure you get their hours of operation ahead of time before you head out there. Finally on a Thursday night, my family got to try out Kinta.  

My husband ordered the King Kong roll and I ordered the Shrimp Crunch Roll and shared. Both were good.  They do not have a very extensive menu like other sushi places, but what they made was good.  The server was really nice and the sushi chef was very welcoming.  The place wasn&#39;t very crowded, for it is on the small side, but continued to have a steady stream of customers.  We also had miso soup and salad.  They gave us complimentary soup and rice for our little boys. We enjoyed our rolls and thought about ordering more, however, our nights out with our boys do not last long."

We arrived about an hour before close on a weeknight, figuring we had plenty of time to eat before causing any problems.  There were a few other couples there, but it was by no means crowded, so we were seated right away.  Our waitress was very sweet, potentially a little too shy.

We split a couple of rolls and a couple bottles of hot sake between us.  As others have mentioned, the rolls are very wide- most slices took two bites for me to be able to handle.  I forget which rolls we ordered, but both were very good and we were pretty well stuffed after splitting the two of them.  The order came with a gratis bowl of miso and salad, which was a nice touch (and something I typically have only seen at the AYCE places, where they would prefer to fill you up sooner than later).

The only major downfall about eating here was that they were obviously ready to close up and head out the moment we got done.  A lady who appeared to be a manager or owner kept walking around to see if we were done and they started breaking down tables, cleaning, and otherwise getting ready to go home shortly after we got our food.  A few of the staff were sitting in the booth by the front door, obviously waiting for the last couple of patrons to finish so they too could get out the door.  It made the entire process of wrapping up a little uncomfortable and felt a little rushed."

I too work in the restaurant industry and its a pain in the ass when customers walk in when it&#39;s close to closing time, so I get it, but we do not ever turn anyone away even if they ask to be seated a minute before &#34;closing&#34;.

A lot of the rolls here are different &amp; yummy meaning the fusion of textural components really worked for me. The Yellow submarine, Miami &amp; Godzilla are my favorite rolls here (tried more than half of the rolls on their menu.) 
The highlight for me is the sake (salmon). I tasted no hint of fishiness &amp; nothing but that natural sweet flavor and fresh salmon taste. I always order 10 or more salmon nigiri (fish over rice) every time I come.

I have yet to dine in here, all my orders were carryout but I&#39;d love to make it a date night sometime.

Of all the times I&#39;ve been there, (over 6) there was only one mishap. I ordered 6 pieces of salmon nigiri and received only 4. I called back and they offered to fix the problem if I drove back.. apparently I already had one too many sake shots and decided not to drive, but nice gesture. ;) No doubt I&#39;ll be back for more."

Went in for lunch today and was surprised by the huge menu of rolls.  I cannot comment on the sashimi/nigiri as I had a Maki C for lunch which had a Cali roll, tuna roll and spicy salmon roll.  They all tasted fresh.  As always the spicy roll could be more spicy for me.  I like spicy to be spicy.  But it was still delish.  The rolls weren&#39;t pristinely shaped to dazzle your eyes off but I am definitely coming back again.

You have to over look the strip mall and pull in, then look past the interior of this place.  It&#39;s small, a little dark and not too shiny...but do try the Taco/Tako Yaki....fried octopus dough with shredded tuna skin on top.  Melt in your mouth, donut hole sized bites of fried dough with octopus in it.  These are a little spicy with a brown sauce drizzled on top.  Don&#39;t be scared, try them."

I&#39;m a pretty picky eater over all and the thought of raw fish just did not do it for me. I was craving miso soup, though, and this place was really highly reviewed on Yelp and I figured I could get chicken teriyaki if I wanted a more substantial meal. 

But when we got there, my more adventurous friend convinced me to get one of the dinner specials that came with California rolls and a couple of pieces of nigiri and to just suck it up and try it. Oh boy was that a mistake. Since that day I have been to Kinta almost every week. I&#39;m completely addicted. Every waiter there knows me and a few even know my regular order. (California sunset, California roll, and the vegetable tempura appetizer) But I&#39;ve seriously gotten almost every roll on offer and all of them are delicious.

My husband has been on a sushi kick for a bit now and while I am learning to like it...even the raw items...it is more his favorite and not mine quite yet.  You may want to keep that in mind while reading this particular review. 

We drove up and I tried to pre-warn him that this sushi hot spot was located in a non-descript strip mall.  Apparently, he wasn&#39;t listening too well as he was not impressed by the outside of the building and the empty parking lot.  With plenty of hesitation we walked inside.  Color me plenty surprised as it&#39;s quite nice and cute inside!  They wanted to seat us in the main dining room off to the right hand side, but I wanted to see the chefs in action and requested a table straight back near the sushi table.  They agreed and we were quickly seated.  There were two chefs ready to work, but we took a while to make our decisions.  There was a lot to consider.  I decided to try some beef gyoza while my husband started with some Chef&#39;s Choice nigiri.  I loved their gyoza!  It was served piping hot with a nice dipping sauce.  There were five pieces and they were a nice size.  Ultimately, this ended up being the vast majority of my dinner because I filled up so quickly.  The nigiri was a hit, too!  The yellowtail was the fan favorite and the whole dish was a success.

We moved on to ordering some additional dishes.  And because my eyes are truly bigger than my stomach, I ordered a spicy scallop roll (cooked) and a shrimp tempura roll (yes, cooked).  My meal came with a little side salad.  The dressing was creamy and very tasty.  He ordered more nigiri and a roll that was raw and served with salmon on top.  He really enjoyed it, but said the nigiri was so good that he could have just stuck with that all evening.  I ate a bite of each of my rolls and brought them home to my son.  I was just too full from the gyoza.  

The restaurant started to fill up a little while we were there and there were quite a few carryout orders.  I think maybe we were a little early at 6ish.  We had excellent service from both woman who were hustling back and forth.  The dishes were cleared promptly and the glasses were kept full.  

The prices were competitive.  My sushi man confirmed he would absolutely stop by for dinner again and I would concur.  Kinta Sushi has made the go-to list for dinner options."

You choose a protein and it comes with three sides and miso soup. My favorites are the mackerel (usually they don&#39;t have it though) and kinta sushi combo for lunch, so give those a try! The salads are always great and tempura are in generous portion. Also, recommend the taco yaki appetizer, which is small but delicious.

My past experience here has sort have been disappointing because I waited literally more than an hour for my lunch to come out. This was during lunch time where most people have only an hour lunch break between work. I was compensated with ice mochi, but hopefully that this will be my only bad experience here because all the other times had been great, keeping my review at a solid 4."

I had pretty high hopes for Kinta since it was recommended by a friend, but it fell short of expectations. Upon walking in we awkwardly stood there waiting for someone to greet us and the &#34;host&#34; stand is oddly placed on the other side of their wall divider with employees back to the entrance, very weird.

Our service was good, someone always followed up with us and our food came out fairly quickly.

Shrimp and vegetable tempura app (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kinta-sushi-carol-stream?select=nWQfimLdQgnLsnQKfBWOpw#nWQfimLdQgnLsnQKfBWOpw): how can you go wrong with tempura? Hot, crispy, and I believe they gave us 3 shrimp versus two, +1!

Complimentary house salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kinta-sushi-carol-stream?select=nWQfimLdQgnLsnQKfBWOpw#LjmvAuQQcMQ2bd5MVnM-nQ): I love free things and appreciate the complimentary item.

Chicago Crazy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kinta-sushi-carol-stream?select=nWQfimLdQgnLsnQKfBWOpw#lF5Tsl1K4QAaLdPKO3gwxw): I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes when I saw they had this! This is my all time favorite roll and Kinta did it almost right. I didn&#39;t find the fish as fresh as it could be.

Rainbow (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kinta-sushi-carol-stream?select=nWQfimLdQgnLsnQKfBWOpw#Or1gkwm52DhcnTuWWxdLhA): it wasn&#39;t a melt in your mouth type of feel, not bad though. 

King Kong (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kinta-sushi-carol-stream?select=nWQfimLdQgnLsnQKfBWOpw#V7CLqNHnABasIWXe6NE67A): I can see why it&#39;s called the King Kong, this maki is huge! Definitely overpowering, but pretty good.

Godzilla (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kinta-sushi-carol-stream?select=nWQfimLdQgnLsnQKfBWOpw#V7CLqNHnABasIWXe6NE67A): our favorite, can you tell we like tempura?

Overall, Kinta is A-OK in my books. I&#39;ll continue my search and once I find my new fave I&#39;m sure the whole world will know."

I&#39;m going to rate this low in hopes it will drop this below 4+starts to hopefully guide others in search of decent sushi elsewhere. 

Seats of an old BBQ restaurant??   Yikes. ...  Not coming back here. 

Honestly 2 starts might be a stretch"

I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner. He enjoyed it very much as well. The service is good. The sushi is great. I don&#39;t remember exactly what we had but it was fresh and delicious. This place is small so I would not recommend it for a party or group more than 4.

This review is purely on the takeout experience, as the food that I&#39;ve had (both takeout and dine in) has always been great and flavorful. I refrained from writing about my last experience, thinking it was a one-off, but after last night, I don&#39;t think it was.

The last time I got takeout from here, I failed to check all the boxes (or any boxes for that matter!) before I left. We don&#39;t live that far from the restaurant, but far enough that it&#39;s not just down the street. When we got home, we found that the order that I was give was NOT the order I called in. It was completely different! When I called about it, they were apologetic and offered a credit for our next meal.

This time, I called in another phone order and had them repeat the order to make sure that it was right. They quoted 25-30 minutes for the takeout order. I arrived closer to the 30 minute mark since I also had kiddo with me. Those with toddlers know that a wait at a restaurant can go either really good or really bad. Totally depends on how the wind blows! When I arrived, they asked which was my order, and I had a bad feeling when I saw her face. While I waited, I had no less than three other takeout orders come and go before I finally asked where my order was. Kiddo and I were coming up on waiting for 20 minutes. No one really gave me a straight answer as to where my order was, but there was very hurried and frustrated Japanese being thrown around between the workers. Our order finally came, but with no explanation or apology until I asked for the owner. He also had no explanation, which was disappointing. Once I got all the bags and kid into the car, I came to realize that they probably did not start our order until I walked in, as I had 3 rolls of basic sushi (no bells or whistles) and an order for noodles for the kid. I&#39;ll still go to Kinta, but definitely for dine in rather than take out"

I will admit I skeptical because of the strip mall appearance, the strip mall looks old and dumpy and it is easy to overlook this place. The inside is cozy, dim lit, with both tables and booths. I like the set up because the seating feels private in most areas. My girlfriend took the liberty to order since she was the expert here. 

We ordered a soft shell crab appetizer, best ss crab I&#39;ve ever had, crispy and just delicious. She ordered rolls and I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t remember which, but they were all very good and full of different flavors. The wait staff are very pleasant and cheerful, very knowledgable about their menu which is a huge help. I have since been here two more times and have yet to be disappointed with the food or service.

At Kinta, I couldn&#39;t taste salt at all, yet every dish was flavorful and satisfying! Put them in a more kitschy locale and they&#39;ll be overflowing in 5 stars!!"

My older sister took me here for the first time back in 2009, and my life has forever changed. If you don&#39;t know what to get, I highly suggest the Baby King Kong, the Mountain, M-80, 911, their yaki udon (beef or chicken, both are delish!) and their fried green beans! The Baby King Kong is my favorite though. If you happen to not receive a side of their salad, make sure you do, because their salad dressing is bomb!"

I have to credit Kinta for my love of sushi. I had tried it before, and I&#39;ve had sushi countless other times after Kinta... However, Kinta is the standard I hold other sushi to.

The freshness and quality of Kinta has ALWAYS been it&#39;s reason for being the best in the area. It&#39;s like a hidden treasure tucked into a small business strip next to the Carol Stream P.D.

Everytime you walk in you are greeted with a hello from behind the counter. there is ample seating now that they expanded into the new area. The service is always quick, and it&#39;s a smaller place so if you need something faster just grab any of the servers walking by. The prices are very comparable to other restaurants also."

Service is polite and attentive.  I swear that all of their appetizers are excellent from the baby king kong rolls to the asparagus beef.  The sushi quality/taste is very close if not the same as the &#34;city&#34; quality/standards, but especially consistent.

We said we would just order everything right away because we knew what we wanted. She took our drink orders and walked away. 5 minutes later, a different lady comes to our table and tells us they are now closed! I&#39;m sorry.

I&#39;ve been here quite a few times, but haven&#39;t had the chance to given a review.  The sushi here is fairly priced and I recommend coming a bit early since the place does get crowded pretty quick in the evening. I have also been here during lunch on a Tuesday and it was packed as well.  

Went out last week with a group and was seated quickly, the restaurant was pretty packed on a Thursday night.  The waitress was kind and seated us quickly. Received the complementary miso soup and salad.  Ordered the Takoyaki, very good and the price is reasonable compared to many other places that I have been too.  For rolls we ordered the Lady Roll, Double Salmon Roll, Chicago Crazy, and the Volcano Roll.

I recommended starting off with the Chicago Crazy roll, some may not be a fan since it has lettuce in it, but its was very refreshing eating this roll then moving on to the heavier rolls.  The cuts of fish were large and fresh.  The salmon and tuna were the melt in your mouth kind! Avocado in the rolls were large and fresh as well.

We also ordered the Bibimbap, which came out in the stone bowl and the rice crisped up nicely.  I would of liked more meat in my bibimbap, but overall it was very good."

It took a while to find a decent place in the suburbs for sushi and this place hits the spot.  For me this place has good prices and good sushi,  Delicious rolls overall, rice was tender, and the fish was fresh. Creative Maki combinations too to note!

We spent $50 for sushi for 2.  They threw in 2 miso soups complimentary.  (I am always appalled when restaurants charge for miso soup.... it&#39;s just broth with tofu for God&#39;s sake!)

Anyway... maybe one day we&#39;ll actually dine in and enjoy the sushi sans kiddos!"

The service is gracious but a little scattered but I don&#39;t care, just as long as they keep bringing the fish they can do anything they want.

My coworker and I wanted to try something different for lunch so I ventured out a little further from work to this little gem of a place! The service was very quick but sometimes forgetful but understood since they seemed very busy.  The edamame was steaming and delicious almost more then I could eat..  My sushi, especially the spicy tuna was amazing!! The smoked salmon could use a little something to it but overall my plate was empty. can&#39;t wait to go back and try all the different kinds when I have more time to explore the menu!"

We&#39;re glad we did. They have a huge menu of appetizers, sushi, and dinners. We pretty much stick with sushi, and have tried many of their rolls. They have a good selection of creative rolls and lots of more mainstream rolls as well. Last time we were there we tried the shrimp and veg combo tempura and it was the best tempura I&#39;ve ever had--super light and crispy, the way it should be. They also give you miso soup AND salad with your meal. The staff has always been really friendly as well. We&#39;ve put this on our list of favorites.

I have to agree with the other reviewer about the toilet smelling. I used the bathroom the last time we were there and it smelled really bad on there. That&#39;s my only negative though."

We&#39;re so glad we did!

The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. They have never once messed up an order, and the wait between courses is very minimal. The restaurant is not that large, but you don&#39;t feel claustrophobic even on its busy days. Kinta recently added an additional wing, undoubtedly to accommodate all the new happy customers! And while some don&#39;t like the 90s music they play, it&#39;s always one of the many highlights of our visits. 

We always enjoy the house salad and miso soup they bring out at the start of the meal. The salad isn&#39;t the run-of-the-mill, iceberg lettuce-laden concoction that passes for house salad at other places, and it comes dressed with a delicious sweet glaze. The miso soup is delicate but still very tasty.  

Our favorite dishes are the jalapeno bombs, the American Dream Roll, and the King Kong Roll. The King Kong has a nice crunch and is topped with that delicious sweet mayo glaze that&#39;s also found on the jalapeno bombs. The prices are very reasonable and Kinta doesn&#39;t skimp on the portions.  What more could you ask for?"

I have lived nearby Kinta for YEARS and hadn&#39;t stepped foot inside until a few days ago. Bad foodie! Bad foodie, indeed.

I had a sushi craving so I ordered a rainbow roll to go, but upon walking in I would totally eat in next time. They even have a sushi bar! Despite having just expanded, the atmosphere was still intimate and cozy. 

Now to the food - the rainbow roll was so fresh and the miso soup hit the spot on a gloomy fall day. My only gripe is that the sushi pieces were super huge and frankly easier to eat with my hands rather than chopsticks. This gripe is small though because you get a great value for your dollar due to the size of the sushi. Also, the roll survived a walk home so that just speaks to the quality of the roll.

Also, I want to try a bunch of the other items on the menu. It seems to have a good balance between sushi and non sushi so you non sushi people have no fear! They also seem to have great lunch specials!

I will absolutely be walking over to Kinta again in the near future. But for the rest of you, come visit! Don&#39;t be weary of the fact that it is next to a 7-11 in strip-mall. Kinta will absolutely surprise you!"

If the people are nice and service is great, you have a good business, now if the food is great you are winning. 

We went in last night to try out the new place. We had driven by many times and seen that 5 Guys was gone and that there was this new Greek place. Last night we had to make an emergency run to Home Depot, and after we needed to eat so decided to try it out. 

We went in, had never eaten there before and didn&#39;t know what to order. The staff were very helpful in explaining to us what everything was. So I got the food, a lot of food for 40 bucks, and a lot of food for our family, and we were hungry so great. However I guess there was a little misunderstanding on if the roasted red pepper sauce was spicy or not, I guess it is a little, but it was too much for my 7 year old. So I went up and asked for clarification, and with no question, they just remade my daughters kids meal, and sent it back with tzatziki on the side for her. Very kind and understanding. This is great service. I was very happy to get such service.

And the food was great. We all really enjoyed everything. The flavors were great, everything was really fresh, and dare I say.... healthy. We were so happy with everything, the food, the service, the staff are lovely people. (THANK YOU!!) WE WILL BE BACK again soon, and again, an again. This is a very welcome addition to our neighborhood."

When I&#39;m trying a new place and I see there&#39;s mixed reviews I don&#39;t read all the reviews before I go... I want to have an open mind and think that this experience will be the best. 
I was in the area because I was lost... I was also hungry so I asked yelp to find local restaurants and noticed this was new &amp; not a chain.  I appreciate their philosophy on food and wanted to reminisce on my trip to Greece. 
The young man that greeted me seemed very excited to have me there and a little distracted...
I decided to order a bowl and my first thought was &#34;wow that&#39;s a really big bowl&#34;... I blame the people who have compared this to a Chipotle style restaurant, thinking the bowls would be the same size but I shouldn&#39;t have been surprised since the portions in Greece were also large! 
I ordered the steak on rice and while I was waiting for the toppings, the server asked if I wanted to try any other meats.  I asked for the souvlaki but he said actually that was just if I ordered gyros but he would let me try chicken, steak, lamb, or pork yeero. I asked to try the lamb... Which he handed me and also gave me another toothpick with pork! (It is a good thing I eat pork or the unrequested sample may have been a little awkward!) 
He decided to do the toppings since the line was backing up and I asked for lettuce and tomatoes (which I love so I asked for a little bit more but he put on onions instead... So I clarified that it was more tomatoes I was hoping for), feta, cucumber, olives, bell peppers and tzatikki on the side (in hindsight I would&#39;ve liked more of that as well!).  
I ordered hummus and since I was there :) decided I *needed* loukamedes.  The hummus was fine but not the best I&#39;ve ever had.  I asked for pita instead of chips and that was delicious! 
Likewise, having high expectations for homemade loukamedes I was a little disappointed with the doughiness but that didn&#39;t stop me from eating it! 
The drink selection was one thing that was totally unique &amp; fun! 
All in all, I liked most of the flavors and know now how I would order if I were coming back.  The cost of the &#34;extras&#34; that I tried I would take off because I thought my total was high for a take away lunch."

The thing that makes this place unique is that it serves Greek food in a unique way.  

Similar to Chipole, you choose if you are going to have a pita, bowl, salad or plate of food.  Then you decide what kind of meat and add toppings.  The toppings and sauces to choose from are very fresh and the finished products that I have had are tasty.  They also do offer some great side dishes/appetizers such as saganaki, pasta salads, etc.

I have had the saganaki (yum) which is a little different than typical saganaki that you&#39;d get at a Greek restaurant.  This is deep fried - so no embarrassing Opa! here.  I have also had a bowl and a pita.  I liked the bowl a little better than the pita, but both were great options and a good amount of food on their own.

One of my favorite things about the restaurant is that they offer a multitude of drink options.  They have lemon water, beer, wine and a variety of soft drinks including craft sodas on tap."

The young guy behind the counter was very helpful and offered samples.
He described the menu as the chipotle of 
Greek food.
We found the large number of items very confusing.
Chipotle is successful because it is a very limited menu done fast and consistently.

Consider if chipotle added a couple soups and 4 different salsas, bottled sodas and beer and wine and a couple different appetizers and 6 things you never heard of.
The overhead menu was the same font and color as chipotle. They copied the idea of preparing the proteins ahead of time and putting them on the serving line.

The best part of the local Greek joints is watching the carving of the gyro meat.
This place does have the rotating slabs behind them. Lost opportunity.

There were also two girls and an older guy behind the counter. They didn&#39;t say a word. We felt cheated on the entire &#34;street&#34; concept.
We took a carry out menu with us to better understand what we may have missed. The olive spread and saganaki sounded good.
My wife ate her bowl entree with a fork.
Come to think of it- I ate the ingredients off my pita with a fork. So much for &#34;street food&#34;. Still don&#39;t know what that means.
The food was good but skimpy.
How will they compete with locally owned Greek Entrepeneurs who give large portions and consistent average service
At reasonable prices?
My guess is not well."

From my understanding this is a brand new restaurant and everyone in the area is trying it out. Well don&#39;t. You&#39;re doing yourself a favor. 
I walked in and starting looking at the menu. The man behind the counter kept looking at me, no hello, nothing. I then say hello and tell him I&#39;ve never been there before. He tell me I can get a plate or a bowl. 
I told him I&#39;d prefer a bowl and ask for chicken breast. They didn&#39;t offer any. I tried their chicken option and it was nasty. I asked for their vegetarian option. He pointed to a spinach pie. Honestly, I wanted to leave, but since I was right on time, I went with it. I was giving 2 side options, I opted for the olive spread and the cabbage salad. I then ask if I will be receiving pita or pita chips for the spread. 
All in all, it sucked! The best part of my meal was my drink selection, they offer izzy. Number 2 would have to be the cabbage salad. The spinach pie was cold and nasty, and the pita chips were old. I will be avoiding this place at all costs."

The meat was seasoned well and the veggies and sauces were fresh. Great variety of fountain beverages. Reasonably priced, but a lot of stuff seemed to be extra, so the bill can add up. Around $23 for chicken bowl, lamb pita, and fries. We only had water. We did purchase for additional sauces and hummus to be added to my bowl. The way it was set up it reminded me of a chipotle version of Mediterranean/Greek food. Instead of it being extra for guac it&#39;s extra for the hummus lol.

I&#39;ve always appreciated a good street and I think spicy pork with feta, cucumbers and tzatziki on a pita is good. They have good dolmades and spinach pie. So good. 

If you go there make sure to look for the hidden 10% off Greek word of the day. It usually hidden on that wall when you walk in the foyer. If you can&#39;t find it they will usually help you at the front desk. Try it out.

Saw this place from the street a couple days ago in the old 5 Guys location and just knew I had to stop by. I am sure glad I did. 

While I would not compare it to actual greek street food in greece, COVO did not disappoint at all. It definitely has that Chipotle vibe going, but in a nice greek family sort of way. It has all the dive place goodness in an updated, clean and modern restaurant.  All the staff was friendly and attentive throughout my visit including one of the owners who was very pleasant. 

I won&#39;t go over the menu options too much, other than to say what other yelpers have. Basically, if you can order at Chipotle, the menu is pretty similar in concept as is the way your order. 

I went with my son and we both sampled each other&#39;s choice. We order both the fresh cut fries and the greek style with feta and greek seasoning. both orders were piled high and very tasty. Nothing too different than what you would expect for the fresh cut fries, but the greek style was a unique flavorful treat. 

Steak on a pita with no other toppings and the cilantro sauce is what my son ordered. He has a bit of a underdeveloped palate so without the additional toppings I really got a chance to just focus on the meat. The steak was tender a juicy with a not too strong garlicky taste. The real treat was the spicy cilantro sauce. Delightful!

I went traditional and ordered the beef/lamb gyros prepared with the usual toppings of onion, tomato, cucumber and tzatziki sauce. Now, do not order traditional expecting a &#34;Chicago Style&#34; Gyros served in hot dog stands, that&#39;s not what this is. This stuff is fresh folks! Not that processed stuff that every Tom&#39;s, Dick&#39;s and Harry&#39;s Dog&#39;s serves you. It was a good sized serving but I did not feel overstuffed like I do with most gyros. 

Finally, saving the best for last (which I ate first) was the Saganaki. Ok, I was a little disappointed that they didn&#39;t bring me out a flaming plate yelling Opa! Regardless of the lack of flames, it was much better than I expected. The crust was lightly crisp and fried to perfection with a warm cheese center and a wonderful lemon flavor. I will definitely be order this again!

I am already anticipating my next visit so I can try the other wonderful looking menu items. So please go spend your money here so they stick around for a while. Thanks!"

It&#39;s a &#34;Greek Chipolte&#34; with similar casual vibe. It&#39;s our go-to spot now, been there probably 6 times in the last 2 weeks. Good job Covo, finally a place doing it right.

UPDATE: I read some negative reviews from people ordering all this weird stuff that they didn&#39;t like on their first visit and then write this place off as crappy?!!! I legitimately want to help... ORDER THIS:

Order the PLATE (best value), PROTEIN: half SPICY PORK and half BEEF &amp; LAMB so u can try both. TOPPINGS: get your feta and veggies but get the GREEN SAUCE, TZATZIKI, and COVO SAUCE on the side so you can try them, they&#39;re good! For the sides, get SPICY FETA and FRIES... BOOOM!!! You&#39;re welcome.

It was ok the first time and so as the second.  I just hate the fact that meat are already pre-cut and a little cold already. The portion and its consistency changed too. The pita this time was almost toasted.  Rice was way little that I almost didn&#39;t taste it was in my dish.  My salad had an after taste and didn&#39;t taste freshly made.  The food is ok but they need to be consistently ok.  Otherwise it will be unfair to come back and food will taste different because they didn&#39;t throw away what they served yesterday, or the cook is having a bad day. 

It&#39;s a little pricey too for the amount of food you get. I hope they stay but they will lose repeat customers if they keep this up. Need their attitude adjusted too.  Even franchise fast food restaurants know how valuable customer service is no matter how good the food you serve. You can&#39;t be rude when customers asked abt the menu.

If you&#39;re wanting a traditional gyro typical of the area you will be sorely disappointed. The meats are shaved and diced then stored in bins for who knows how long before the make it on your plate. This results in mushy cold meat, which are more like chucks that you would find at chipotle but slightly more tough and flavorless. I was also taken back by how little meat they serve for the size of pita, another disappointment knowing how generous other gyro stands are. The pitas were great, soft with a little crisp. I also had Greek fries which were nothing special, under cooked potatoes with feta on top. 

Another easy fix would be to have kids that fit beverage cu

The service was great, a little rushed for being a new restaurant, but happy to explain anything on the menus. The restaurant itself looks fantastic and they really put in the effort to make the space feel inviting and current.

The old man said something to the kid assembling it and he scooped 2 large scoops of the meat from the tray. I reminded him &#34;I ordered it fresh cut&#34;. He turned and spoke again to the old man and he begrudgingly went over and cut some meat, less then 1/2 that was originally scooped on. I said &#34;that&#39;s barely 1/2 of what you put on&#34;. The old man grabbed my pita and then scooped the meat up into the scooper cup, flipping it completely up and loosing the rest of the freshly cut meat onto the counter. He put it down and walked away. Now there&#39;s barely 1/3 of the original amount, the pita has been touched multiple times. The kid looks at me with this deer in the headlights look and said &#34;So, anything else&#34;.

This is the real hand stacked Yeero just like in Greece.

Pork Yeeros is outstanding it reminded me  of the delicious Yeero sandwiches I had in Thessaloniki. 
I also tried their pork souvlaki Just Like in Greece simply OUTSTANDING. 

My wife had Beef and lamb Yeeros so tasty. It is real meat not a blend of soy beans and who knows what else.  A healthy clean protein I loved it.

I&#39;ve gotten the &#34;yeero&#34; twice. First time I ordered the spicy pork Picantico and asked for a wheat pita. Took them about 4 minutes to find their wheat pita and then it was pretty stiff and brittle after they steamed it. They loaded it up with the meat and toppings. It was good, definitely different experience with the chopped up meat versus the longer cuts you&#39;d traditionally get at greek like lunch places. No one was particularly helpful in walking me through the process of ordering. But it was clean and well lit, and didn&#39;t have RC Cola in the machine...which is much improved from traditional Gyro joints. 

2nd visit was okay, did the lamb/beef protein this time. Was dried out and chewy. Still decent, but was not as good as my previous trip. Also, if you order bowl or salad, it&#39;s considerably more expensive than the pita. Also very disappointing; and I don&#39;t understand what value is added by ditching the pita for a hard plastic bowl. At least at Chipotle, it&#39;s the same price regardless of which option you choose. I&#39;ll try this place again, but I&#39;m not going out of my way to tell people about it like I did after the 1st experience a few weeks ago. Like other reviewers have stated, they use Spotify with commercials."

We ordered two lamb/beef &#34;yeeros&#34;. The quality of the meat looked more like a chopped steak taco meat, with small (and often burnt or grizzly) pieces of meat.

Very skimpy on the meat. Most gyros are stuffed full of the lamb/beef meat strips off the cone. These had such little meat that we tore half the pita off just for a decent meat/bread ratio.

Tried a baklava as well, which tasted somewhat bland compared to others.

Their tsatziki sauce, however, is fantastic.

Doggie Diner and Preno&#39;s both outdo this &#34;Greek Street Food&#34; restaurant&#39;s gyros. 

Not sure yet if we&#39;ll go back."

I&#39;ve never gotten a gyros before that it wasn&#39;t absolutely packed with meat. I do believe they cut the gyros off the spit however they shouldn&#39;t cut it until right before you order because it dries out the meat. They took it out of a container instead of taking off off the spit?? Hubby got a chicken gyros which he said had absolutely no flavor?? My hubby he will not eat lamb (which really is the real gyros) Our saganaki was really good but obviously they cannot do it the right way maybe the restaurant code violations?? But it tasted really the same just made in a deep fryer instead of the classic &#34;flambé&#34; style. We got a piece of baklava and that was very good as well. Basically they just have to do a few things differently. It was crazy expensive for what you got.  I think they were only opened for 3 days and it was jam packed with people so we will try again after a couple months or I&#39;ll go without my hubby because it&#39;s not a huge Greek food fan. He kept saying he&#39;s rather just get Nicky&#39;s in Naperville!? They didn&#39;t have Greek potatoes either. Just smothered some fresh cut french fried with feta cheese. Hmmm. My hubby was basically looking for something else to eat afterwards because his gyros was so tiny!!

I chose Chicken, which turned out to be riddled with gristle and fat.  My husband picked Pork and both he and I agreed that it was extremely dry.  They were also out of many varieties of fountain drink.  So, for 2 gyros and a 1 side of fries we paid $18.34.  Not only meh but expensive.  I&#39;m not willing to give it another try but my husband was more forgiving and says he will give it one more shot with the lamb."

The meat is pre-cut into short strips and chunks on the steak. Both were not hot and very dry and chewy. The steak was seasoned to satisfaction. Then you proceed down the service line as at Chipotle or Panda Express to add your toppings and sauces of which were of a good variety. Adding an order of fries (fresh cut) and the medium drink the total came to over $25.00. Quite pricey for a barely acceptable entree. Have definitely out priced themselves for lunch and the area.

Do you want fresh food? Come here.

This is not the typical Kronos gyro meat on a spit you know in Chicagoland. 
Think cross between Naf Naf and Chipotle for Greek food. 
I had the spicy pork bowl. The toppings are numerous. Google the menu. Tasted great. Put garden on top (a taste of everything). 
The chicken lemon soup very bright and fresh tasting. 
They have two craft brews on tap. 
Now for something that is way beyond typical. Besides Pepsi products, the have Stubborn soft drinks. I&#39;ve never heard of them either. But I tasted craft root beer, cream soda, black cherry with tarragon (it&#39;s not too sweet with a hint of tarragon weird but good), and grapefruit. There was more but I finished my meal.

Oh boy.  This guy didn&#39;t know how close he came to being pulled over the counter.

She went in to place her order at the counter and she ordered her regular patty melt thing (meat, onions cheese sandwich) but she loves it.  The guy gave her attitude because he didn&#39;t know what she was talking about.  She tried to explain and then instantly went to being rude causing my wife to leave crying.

Tip to brother:
1. Don&#39;t mess with a man&#39;s wife especially when he is literally twice your size.  The person that you where rude to; ironically saved you.
2. When you don&#39;t know something, it&#39;s ok.  Just listen to your customer.  She wasn&#39;t being rude but just trying to tell you about  how she likes her sandwich.
3.  You being ridiculous turned a good customer into a bad advertisement."

Probably the best hot dogs in Will County. I have been coming here since they have opened. The ONLY reason they got three stars instead of 5 is the lady who takes your order. She doesn&#39;t let you place your order, talks over you while you are trying to order, and questions what you are telling her before you are finished speaking. I come here a couple times a month, and it is worth every penny. I have seen a lot of places on the food network do not clean their ice machine, and subsequently you get moldy ice. I always order my drinks with no ice. I went up for a refill and she insisted that my refill had to have ice in it because it was complementary. I offered $0.50 to not have ice, and she told me nope and put ice in my drink. Great food, but that lady needs to go"

We got the carne asada with flour tortilla and 2 tacos. The order came to about $20 for 2 people and we ate in so they gave us chip and salsa while we were waiting for our food to come out.

The carne asada was a rice plate, which I was mistakenly expecting to be carne asada fries. The plate had rice, lettuce, 1 slice of tomato, pinto beans, some guac, and about 3 slice of meat. Overall, it was mediocre food for a pretty expensive price. The restaurant wasn&#39;t fancy or anything and I am so used to cheap Mexican food so I was pretty disappointed with the price and quality.

I am surprised my Californian classmates were raving about this since we are pretty spoiled with delicious, authentic, and cheap Mexican food in CA. I guess they lowered their expectations for suburbs Mexican food.

They have a small parking lot and it is one way so if you can&#39;t find a spot, you would have to drive all the way around the building and back again to find another spot..

Service was great, though!"

Oh the memories....I&#39;ve been a loyal Los Burritos customer ever since. I don&#39;t even want to know how much $$$ i&#39;ve made for the owner but you&#39;re welcome! Now I started out at the Glen Ellyn location but recently moved and now I go to this location and they&#39;re spot on. I actually go to this los more often than I did the other location. I actually go sober to this location vs. the other as well. 

Anyways...to the food! Los cooks everything fresh! That&#39;s why I prefer Los over the juggernaut chain that is taking over the land...The tacos, quesadillas, burritos, fajitas, etc.. all taste authentic and delicious! I enjoy using all three salsas for my food. Each and every bite is a different taste. You can&#39;t go wrong with the chips and salsa either...excellent service is always provided. Very friendly and always timely.

Keep it up!!"

That being said not only does LBT offer lengua, but tripitas as well. I&#39;ve been here a handful of times now and have been satisfied every time. I&#39;ve tried ordering across the menu but I keep coming back for the tacos. I highly recommend the suite of taco options with cilantro and onions. The cesina (salty, smoked beef) is also a treat I haven&#39;t typically seen in most restaurants. A side of grilled onions to put on top adds to deliciousness.

A couple of tips:
- Eat in for the free chips and salsa
- Make sure to ask for the additional salsas (I believe it&#39;s a salsa verde and chipotle salsa)
- The staff does a good job, tips are appreciated.

Order with a smile!"

The food was fresh and prompt, so we were both able to get in and out and back to work in good time.

The employees were friendly and very nice.

The only downside was the parking and the fact that the place wasn&#39;t the cleanest inside.  I&#39;m thinking maybe the place was a little dirty because they probably just finished a busy lunch service.

If I&#39;m in the area, I will probably come back and try the quesadillas or steak tacos."

It was comparable to most tortas that I&#39;ve had before, but I couldn&#39;t say that it was great or amazing. It was pretty decent.

I came in to pick the order up and I found that the place was a little dirty and disorganized at the time. They have the chips (for dine-in orders) lined up right where you pick up the food. So anyone that picks up their food is now breathing and standing over the chips. It kinda freaked me out and I&#39;m not even really a germaphobe.

I saw all the great reviews on this location so I decided to give them a shot. Went there at about 11 pm and ordered it to go. The food was absolutely TERRIBLE the steak was dry and way overcooked (most likely cooked twice just to heat it up), the ingredients i paid extra for (sour cream, double meat) were nowhere to be seen, the lettuce was soggy..the tortilla itself was very dry. Even the French fries were bad and it doesn&#39;t take much to cook good fries.. Worst Los I&#39;ve ever had in my life and I like to indulge in Los burritos almost every other day if not every day so thats saying something.

All in all I will never go to this location again.

That being said these places have never done me wrong no matter which one I end up at. Always fresh none of that mystery meat being held till you order. As soon as you tell them what you want the raw steak hits the griddle with some nice seasoning that unfortunately some places seem to omit.

No the cheapest place but for the portion you seriously get two meals or a serious food coma like I had last night. Don&#39;t forget to get some horchata and extra salsa verde it just wouldn&#39;t be the same without it."

I have eaten there before, but nothing memorable.  My burrito was so-so, the pork was a bit charred and very dry.  The sides and all of the other burrito parts were fresh.

His chorizo and eggs burrito was HUGE, and at $4.95 one can&#39;t complain. He reports that it was delicious. I had tacos- beef and chicken. I&#39;d stick with the beef-yummy! The chicken was a little flavorless. When you eat in, chips and salsa are free, and the salsa is definitely acceptable!

We will be returning again, especially for those days when we&#39;re craving huge delicious burritos...or maybe we&#39;ll just make it a Sunday morning ritual!!"

Now for the good - the burritos are awesome.  There are plenty of other items on the menu, but I&#39;ve only had the burritos.  I usually go for steak or chorizo.  If you go with chorizo, ask them to put scrambled eggs in there too.  YUM.  I&#39;d eat it for breakfast, but I&#39;d probably want to sleep all day if I did.  If you go for lunch, I usually eat 2/3 of the burrito and save the rest for later, otherwise you&#39;ll go into a food coma.  A few friends of mine used to have a rating scale for burrito joints, so here goes...(all are scale from 1-5, 5 being awesome)

Girth - 4.5.  I&#39;ve seen bigger, but only from one place.  You&#39;ll need two hands.

Meat-veggie ratio - 4.  Sometimes they overload the shredded cheese, but you usually get a good amount of meat in there.

Slop factor - 4.  Some places the tortilla stays together like glue.  This one can fall apart sometimes, so you may want to have a fork nearby.  If you get the chorizo, have a healthy stack of napkins next to your place, you&#39;re gonna need &#39;em.  That stuff is greasy!

Service - 5.  They are always smiling, bring you chips and salsa (free), and bring your food to the table if you dine in.  Make sure you tip em.

Value - 5.  For the price you pay, you get a ton more than a lot of places.

Gets a bit loud after hours, but then again, what place isn&#39;t loud at 2am?  (besides a laundromat)

Enjoy!"

I always get the nachos with ground beef and beans and they are always really good.  I like it when the chips get a little soggy but still stay crunch to and their chips do the trick.

The service is fast and the food is always hot.  They just get a little confused when it gets really busy and sometimes not everyone&#39;s food comes out at the same time, which can make dining with a large group (more than 2 or 3) a little difficult.

To begin with, I don&#39;t understand why, when the place is nearly empty they will try to seat you on top of another table, or then right outside the kitchen. (It wasn&#39;t even 5 pm when we arrived.)

I have had better meals at Houlihans in the past. The Seared Scallops I ordered were quite tasty themselves, but the lemon-spinach risotto was too strident and also warred with the basil oil that had also been put on the plate. There was also a huge wad of baby arugula, undressed, in the center of the dish, that just seemed out of place. I&#39;m glad that I had added a side Caesar salad for an extra $2.95, which was enormous and tasty too.

My mom thought her dish was &#34;mediocre&#34;: the mahi-mahi itself was okay, but she thought the pineapple rice was much too sweet. My dad was the most satisfied with his salmon. 

We all enjoyed the ice cream pie with Snickers and Kahlua fudge, but the Oreo-peanut crust was frozen so solid that we could not drill our spoons through it. :( 

Our waitress was on the ball and friendly.

I&#39;ve come with my parents, friends, parties, and dates. The food is always fantastic what ever I try but my favorites are the steak and the chic parm. The steak is so tender and delicious and well seasoned. And for a 4oz fillet you get soup ...get the baked potato you will be glad you did, and two sides for I think $17 rounded up. 

The chic parm is one if the few places you can tell the noodles are home made. Most places get me by the sauce or the star of the dish is the protein. But with this the noodles shine as well.

Dessert: is there any better way to finish a meal? I suggest the Carmel cake or the snickers ice cream cake. And while those may not be the exact names you will know which ones they are. The Carmel cake is fantastic and the frosting divine. If I could have a bucket of the frosting I would gladly take it. And the ice cream cake...well try it and allow your taste buds to know magic."

Every other table were all folks that were 60+ years old.  For the first time in my life, I felt so out of place at Houlihans.  Oakbrook Mall used to have a Houlihans and unfortunately they closed which was a complete bummer since that was my regular hangout with my good friends and for Blackhawks playoff games.

My husband had his heart set on their Georgia Peach Long Island Iced tea.  This pitcher  (32 oz) of happiness is simply the best! I can see why he can down 2 of these before we leave (and I become the designated driver..haha). 

He ordered their burger and I ordered off of their new &#34;clean dishes&#34; under a menu called Inspiralized.  It was the Butternut squash and sausage lasagna paired with a pesto garlic zucchini and carrot &#34;noodle&#34; salad.  Yummm, and super healthy. The butternut squash was the replacement for the pasta part of the lasagna. So instead of the using a pasta layer, it had a thin layer of sliced butternut squash.  Well done, Houlihan Chefs!

It simply means it is nothing out of the ordinary. Just average. Of course, all I ordered was the French onion soup and a side of mashed potatoes. This is due to the fact that I just had my wisdom teeth out. But a lot can be said from the flavor of a restaurants mashed potatoes. The soup was ok. Campbell&#39;s makes a pretty similar version than only costs me 99 cents out of the can. So I&#39;m not sure it was worth my $5. The mashed potatoes were very tasty. I&#39;m sure there was a lot of butter in it...so how could they be bad?! But alas buttery potatoes do not win a 5 star rating. If I return to Houlihans sometime soon and I have the ability to chew solid food, I will give it another shot. But as of right now I deem it a simply average restaurant."

I&#39;ve lived in the area now for 6 years and finally made my way over to this location.  They have indoor and outdoor seating here, and you can make a reservation online.  As with any place after work, or on a weekend, making a reservation isn&#39;t a bad idea.

Be sure to sign up with them online - you will get some pretty decent coupons and reminded of specials they have every now and then, and they are GOOD food &amp; drink specials.  

I recently visited this place around 5:15 on a Friday.  When I got there, it was pretty empty...a reservation wasn&#39;t needed but I had one anyway.  Shortly after it did get pretty packed so keep that in mind if you plan on visiting.  I ordered the mixed greens salad w/ chicken...very good, and a favorite of mine.  They have a great selection on the menu, so you really can&#39;t go wrong with anything here.

The service was very quick, though once our check came, our server didn&#39;t come back to refill our water - that was my drink for the evening.  It&#39;s always a plus, and good customer service to keep getting water refills as long as you&#39;re sitting there."

Most of their salads seem to have pecans, fruit, or something sweet on them, which is annoying.  I got a chicken salad without nuts or croutons, and it was...ok.  Nothing that special.  While our waiter was generally friendly, my water was never refilled.  Also, though we were not in a hurry, when we ordered, the waiter said we would play a game -- if lunch took more than 20 minutes to arrive, it would be free.  He set a timer and left it on our table, but when he brought out our salads, there was no announcement of what the timer said (I thought we were playing a game?), so, uh, I&#39;ll take his word it was under 20 minutes?  And while we did sit there for quite a while, he got kind of weird about us eventually paying the check.  He was kind of saying that we could take all the time we needed, when it was clear that he wanted us to pay up.

Additionally, I do not understand why, in a mostly empty restaurant, we were seated immediately next to the wait station with a view of the kitchen.  I didn&#39;t want to be annoying and ask for a different table, but really?  If I hadn&#39;t been with a friend, I probably would have gone looking for the water pitcher myself...  Honestly, this was not great and I would not return."

The only downside is that their patio does not allow dogs. Which we all think is B.S., as my dog is as classy as they come. Oh well. 

I have to say that this location does have plenty of parking, and is kitty corner to a Whole Foods in case you want to get dessert (the desserts at Hou&#39;s leave a lot to be desired)."

Our food was ok.  

This is one of my favs for apps... So, was dissatisfied this time."

Due to having a strange day, we didn&#39;t arrive to be seated until 9:15 PM but we still received wonderful, attentive service and our food was very delicious for the most part.
We began with 2 appetizers, because we have been coming to Houlihan&#39;s for the past 20 years and have different favorites. I got the spinach and artichoke dip with cheesy lavosh crackers, and it was splendid. The dip was cheesy and creamy and the crackers were perfectly crisp. We did have a slight disappoinment with my mom&#39;s appetizer, which was the stuffed &#39;shrooms. She said that she thinks they must have changed the recipe because she thought the breading didn&#39;t taste as good as it usually does. 
However, that was the only issue. Her side salad was very good, the produce was fresh and they didn&#39;t skimp on the toppings.
For our meals, she got the pot roast which was also very good, but a bit different than the pot roast that we&#39;re used to since the gravy was more of a wine sauce. We both thought it tasted very good though. The meat was tender and the vegetables were delicious. For my dinner I got the steak &amp; blue cheese wedge salad which is my FAVORITE Houlihan&#39;s meal! (It used to be seasonal, now I believe it is a permanent option.) A small filet, a wedge of iceburg lettuce, a few cherry tomatoes, asparagus, a bit of onion, a large slice of gorgonzola, roasted beets, pecans, bacon, blue cheese dressing and soft cheesy polenta croutons make for a truly epic salad. All ingredients in my salad were fresh and prepared to perfection.
Overall, I love Houlihan&#39;s, I&#39;d recommend it to anyone looking for a casual, tasty bite to eat and I can&#39;t wait to go back! 
PS They often have seasonal cocktails. One year during Shark Week they had blue Long Island ice teas which were served with a plastic shark toy, and they have had lovely Christmas cocktails in the past such as apple pie moonshine. So, if you go there, be sure to check out the bar to see if anything interesting is going on with any specials."

I met a friend for dinner, food was good as usual, server was terrible. He kept trying to rush us, from giving us 2 minutes to look at menu and order, to bringing our dinner too soon after our soup and salad. He even started taking my friends salad away before she was finished and she had to tell him to put it back on table, she wasn&#39;t done. To top it off, he was pestering us to pay the bill, couldn&#39;t wait to shoo us away. SERIOUSLY??? The place was not that busy and even if it was, don&#39;t we have a right to take our time or we could have went to McDonalds. When we went to pay our tab I specifically told the waiter I&#39;d like change and guess what? He didn&#39;t break my large hill, but left it in the holder thinking I&#39;d just give him an over generius tip. He got less than I had planned because at this point I&#39;d have enough of his garbage. Bye bye"

If it took more then 20 mins then they would buy our lunch. Literally seconds after we sat down, the waitress brought my daughter carrots and ranch. It was perfect to keep her occupied and happy as we reviewed the menu. We ordered chicken lettuce wraps and shared an ahi tuna salad. Everything came out very fast, hot and fresh. It was delish! The waitress was very attentive and paid attention to details. The only reason why I didn&#39;t give my experience 5 stars is because they sat us next to the kitchen and the bathroom was hard to get to. Will definitely go back to try it again."

The food menu is not really our style so I can&#39;t get super excited about it.  I will say the food we ordered was good. But I must comment on the terrific service! We ordered nachos without tomato.  When it arrived neither of us noticed there was tomato on the dish.  The waitress noticed first and commented, immediately toon action and ordered us a correct plate.  The manager also came over to apologize.

Got to come this year with my mom and good friend we had a nice relaxing time together. I always get the steak my mom enjoys meatloaf or pot roast which is always good. Our service was good and my soda was always filled which always impresses me. And since it was my birthday I had to have the cappuccino cake. I do wish they still have the small cakes rather than the large piece of cake. But they also are accommodating and giving you a little dish of ice cream with chocolate sauce if you don&#39;t want one of their larger desserts. This is one of my favorite places to go. We never feel rushed and it&#39;s comfortable there. And of course I like the free Entree for your birthday.

Well...  I appreciate your confidence, but honestly, you&#39;re restaurant has been slipping over the years and dropped significantly over our last two visits in March and April of 2016.

We visit Houlihans regularly.  My husband and I used to go there as a couple when we dated.  We went there as newlyweds and now 20 years later we visit often with our children and extended family.

The last two visits, the food was good. (Not great or spectacular as I would have said about 5 years ago.)  Food portions are consistently MUCH smaller than they used to be.   The servers were awful.  Two visits ago I filled out their survey because the server was THAT bad- order was wrong, service slow, she charged us for kids drinks that come with the meal, she took my phone from the table...   I wanted to give her a little grace thinking she was new but she wasn&#39;t even nice about it.  I wouldn&#39;t have thought things could get worse until this past Sunday&#39;s visit when we were seated at the WORST table right next to the entry (even though there was plenty of other seating) and we got an even ruder waitress who was slower on service and accused my daughter of being over 10 (she&#39;s not- just tall) when she ordered the kids meal.

Seriously Houlihans?  I used to think your servers were the friendliest.  Loved the witty banter some would do.  These last two were not good.  Step up your hiring and training!!!

I think if there&#39;s a strike three we may have find a new &#34;goto&#34; sit down restaurant.

I really wish I could give you more than two stars but after some consideration with the service as bad as its been, you&#39;re not even a &#34;C&#34;.  You didn&#39;t meet our expectations.  I hope I can come back and edit this review to give you higher marks after our next visit."

This is a favorite local place for us and always enjoy their selection of food, great service, and fair pricing.
Just went casual for my birthday and had a classic burger. It was perfectly cooked, came with my choice of a side, and was delicious. My only suggestion would be to either offer more saluted mushrooms or not charge for that option. I think I got 4 mushrooms on my burger. But such a minor detail! We will be back!"

We started with a glass of wine.  We asked if the pot roast was grass fed or corn fed beef.  Brett didn&#39;t know but said he would check.  A short time later a manager type came out and said she didn&#39;t know either since the box it came in had been thrown out.  My question is, WHO&#39;S IN THE KITCHEN?  No one in the kitchen knows what product they are using? 

 Next we had a house salad and tomato soup.  The soup had a taste we didn&#39;t care for.   The bowl it was served in was not clean.  The salad was average at best.  Next we had the scallops and the white bean salad.  The scallops were a bit overcooked and the risotto that came with it was cooked to the consistency of mush.  The white bean salad had no flavor.

They have drink specials during the week which a pitcher of Long Island for $5.95 has me ordering two!  

Food wise we love the stuffed chicken breast and usually split it and they are nice enough to put it on two plates.  We split because we love their house salads which has corn on it which is really good. And their stuffed mushrooms are great too. Honestly everything we&#39;ve had - with the exception of their tomato soup - which seems to be a recurring comment here, is really good.  They probably should look at their tomato soup though, since it gets knocked on here a lot. Great atmosphere and if you sign up got their email or text program you will get great promotions to use and save a lot of money."

My fiance got a bowl of the French Onion Soup and 2 Fish Tacos. He thought they were not bad but the fish was a bit overfried. 

The server was nice in the beginning but then didn&#39;t really come check up on us later or refill our waters even once.

Overall, 3.5.

Update: I came again with my mom this time.

There were like 3 people that greeted me when I walked in. My server Phillip was super nice and my mom and I really liked him a lot.

My mom and I both got the 5 oz steak which comes with a soup or salad, and 2 sides each. My mom got a bleu cheese salad, baked potato, and asparagus. I got a tomato bisque, mashed potatoes, and fries. 

Steak: it&#39;s tiny, of course. It tastes just ok.

Mashed potatoes: it&#39;s ok

Fries: too much seasoning

Tomato bisque: yum!!!!!! Rich and creamy.

It was my moms birthday so Phillip gave her a free dessert. We chose the cappuccino cake and OMG it was delicious!!!! Super chocolatey and a generous portion!!! I don&#39;t like coffee flavored desserts but this had just the right amount, even my sister who hates coffee was impressed.

I increase my overall rating to four stars now."

Today is Easter so like many people we decided to have a family meal out. We got to the restaurant a little after noon, and saw very few cars parked in the lit as compared to the other open places we passed on the way here. So I completely understand this is a holiday and that the place will be busy, and filled with employees who don&#39;t want to be here. I don&#39;t think they should be here either, why are these places open on holidays like this? So the only reason this place gets an extra star is because my meal was better then last time. This is not the case for the others Two people complained their Italian beefs were flavorless and lackluster. The girlfriend thought the Italian sausage was lacking spice,while my sisters were disappointed in their vegetarian choices.

I was looking for a place in the area where I could enjoy dinner with a friend (anywhere) with a wide variety of options (not quite everywhere) with their nutritional information online (Houlihan&#39;s!). I am counting calories these days and wanted to have more than one option that would work for me for the day. Thankfully, that wasn&#39;t a problem. 

We sat in a cozy booth which was nice. The menus themselves have a metal cover on them. That was weird. I don&#39;t usually comment on what a menu is actually made of, but this was so unusual and the whole thing felt dirty, so it&#39;s worth mentioning.

I decided on a cup of chicken tortilla soup (no cheese) and the scallops with asparagus risotto (no cheese). My girlfriend went with a cup of their baked potato soup and a chicken &amp; bacon wrap (plain) with fries. 

Our server didn&#39;t write down the order. We are both picky and have some dietary issues, so we suggested that she might want to jot it down to avoid any mistakes and she declined to do so. :-(

The soups arrived and they were both very good. My girlfriend was looking for crackers, but our server was MIA. Within minutes our entrees arrived via someone other than our server.  Seriously?!?!?  This is definitely one of my pet peeves. It&#39;s Tuesday night at seven o&#39;clock in a fairly empty restaurant. Someone can&#39;t time this a little better?  Why?  

So now what?  My friend pushes her soup to the side and moves on to her entree. This isn&#39;t an option for me because my entire meal is covered with grated cheese. 

When the server arrives, I point out the cheese and she takes it back to the kitchen. At least I can finish my soup although my friend&#39;s goes to waste. My entree returns. The server says that the chef &#39;de-cheese-ified&#39; it for me. Aka changed the greens on top, flipped the scallops over and mixed the rest of the cheese into the already overly mushy risotto. I take a bite. It&#39;s cold.

Ah hem. Can we please try this again?  Oh sure! Ten-ish minutes later a new plate arrives. The scallops are hot and seem fresh. The risotto is basically warm enough to eat some of it. The plate has been redressed. $19ish and it took three times to ALMOST get it right. Here, have a scoop of ice cream for your inconvenience. Sure thanks.  Calories I didn&#39;t want but who cares because I didn&#39;t come close to eating my meal. 

You can guess that I will let years go by again before I consider stopping in.  Nutrition information is nice, but so not worth the less than enjoyable Houlihan&#39;s experience."

But the service we had today was absolutely horrible. I asked for a cup of hot water three times, once when we sat down, once when we ordered our food, and once again after all our food arrived.  We ordered kids meals for our two kids, and they included kids drinks, and I had asked for oranges juice, those never came.  Icecream was included in the kids meals, which was nice, but the waitress brought them out when we were in the middle of our meals.  I had to ask her to bring them back later, otherwise our kids wouldn&#39;t be finishing their meals.  I asked for the dessert menu after we finished the main courses.  She came back with the check instead. Not once during our time here did anyone stop by to ask us if we needed anything or how&#39;s everything tasting.  And our soup bowl and appetizer plates were finally cleared after our dessert came out, even though we finished them a long time ago.  I don&#39;t fully blame our waitress though, the poor girl was waiting on at least three tables while another group of 5 waiters/waitress were all standing around the hostess chatting and doing nothing for a good 20 mins.  this place definitely have some serious management/training issues."

We rediscovered Houlihan&#39;s through the Oak Brook location in the past few months and decided to give the Wheaton location a try. The restaurant seemed loud, it was really hard to understand our server and it seemed hard for him to understand us, and he was not very friendly. He brought me the wrong drink (diet instead of regular, a pet peeve of mine that people assume I&#39;d drink diet pop- they always give my husband the regular and me the diet even though I&#39;m the one who orders regular Coke) but my husband&#39;s beer was perfect and I understand mistakes happen so it wasn&#39;t a big deal and he brought it right away. I love the Chicken Asian Chop Chop Salad and have had it several times at the Oak Brook location- this one was not presented as nicely, had less toppings, and the toppings and salad mix seemed lower quality too. There was a dirty spoon on the plate- I have no idea why; it didn&#39;t seem to go with anything. There were a couple of bad (hard/gristly) pieces of chicken mixed in that I couldn&#39;t eat; I was surprised how different the salad was here as compared to the Oak Brook location. My husband liked his flatbread pizza (but thought it had too much arugula on it- that could be just personal taste). There were at least two managers (or other people in charge) walking around checking on people, and sometimes they just camped out right behind our booth and talked about their plan for the night and who would take what tables, etc.- it felt a little strange that we could hear them talk about all that. Overall it just didn&#39;t feel like an enjoyable experience, when we always enjoy our experience at the other location."

First, the hostess seats us at the booth next to the kitchen. The place is nearly empty, yet she thinks we would be more comfortable listening to the dishes clank so loud that my girlfriend and I can&#39;t hear each other speak.

As always, I ordered the chicken cordon bleu which never disappoints, but also decided to get some soup. 

I usually shy away from the tortilla soups at restaurants because I&#39;m consistently disappointed. I&#39;m glad I was feeling adventurous, however, because it was the best chicken tortilla soup I&#39;ve ever had. It includes a generous amount of chicken, veggies and tortilla strips, all of which exhibit a rich flavor I find lacking in other soups. I especially enjoyed the kick from the spices and practically licked my bowl clean. I won&#39;t be able to resist ordering soup with all my future meals now.

Previous visits weren&#39;t bad, but nothing that makes you really want to go back again. So in we go...it was a beautiful evening and the outside patio was hopping. The inside much less busy so we sat inside. The hostess apparently didn&#39;t like us because she sat us right at the entrance to the bathroom. With so many tables available, why...why I ask, would you sit people there. It&#39;s one of those tables you would seat last. It&#39;s like the table next to the kitchen...Hostess: &#34;do you want to wait 15 minutes or sit next to the kitchen&#34;... Customer: &#34;We will take it!&#34; But since it was a birthday meal and we were in a good mood we decided to let it go and just watch people to make sure they washed their hands.

The food was average. My fish tacos were pretty good. My husbands half slab of ribs was Meh. It was pricey for what you get. 

The service was terrible. She was friendly but either she noticed the birthday coupon or sniffed it out, or I suppose she could have been just lazy but either way we received lousy service for a place like Houlihans. (not that I expect great service but for a place that is trying to be an upscale Fridays you would expect more) She dropped off the meals and the next time we saw her she was dropping off the check. No checking in. No refills. No nothing. We didn&#39;t leave much of a tip. She probably thought &#34;those cheap bastards&#34; instead of thinking &#34;I gave them crappy service, maybe I should try harder or find another line of work&#34;.

We will probably be back at some point when our memories fade. We usually don&#39;t hold it against a place that gives us bad service because often times it&#39;s a bad server, not the establishment. However, high prices, bad service, and average food doesn&#39;t make me want to return."

The menu was quite different than I remember. They still offer the home-style American classics that one would expect, but with a heftier price tag. I got the stuffed chicken breast, and I don&#39;t know what was so $16 about it. The entree was good, but was way too greasy to have been &#34;baked&#34; as the description said. That chicken breast was most definitely fried. It was served with some creamy mashed potatoes, and asparagus that was tough. 

Our waitress was attentive and funny at times. I liked her personality, and was glad she was our server.

1.  They may have crappy beer overall, but they do have good drink specials for the non-craft beer snobs, AND they do have a few bombers of decent stuff (overpriced, but there none the less) if you do want to drink something good.
2.  The small bites menu makes an indecisive person like me very happy.  I can get a bunch of small dishes and call it a day.  In related news:  Disco Fries?  The bomb.  Give &#39;em a try.
3.  The burgers are actually pretty good here.  The Burger 72 is DELICIOUS.  (It has a stuffed mushroom on top, horseradish sauce, and parmesan.)  The Spicy Fritos one isn&#39;t bad either, but it is a little Steak and Shake-y.  Next time, I&#39;m going to try to &#34;Build My Own&#34; and see how much crap they let me throw on there...I&#39;ll keep you posted.
4.  THEY HAVE THE BEST DAMN SALAD YOU&#39;LL EVER HAVE.  Or so my husband claims.  I don&#39;t eat vegetables, but if I ever do, I&#39;ll start here.

However, last time I went to eat there, service at the table was pretty dismal.  It took a while between waitress visits, and we ended up getting visits from a few different servers, even though it was not that busy and our server was right around the corner.  It took a long time to get our drink refills.  Our server was polite and friendly, though.

The food is pretty good.  Instead of banning all raw or semi-cooked meats and fish, they write a warning on the menu that the asterixed foods contain raw ingredients, and raw meat ingredients may cause food-borne illnesses.  This means I was able to get my burger cooked rare, which most places aren&#39;t too keen on doing.

Nice variety in the menu, with Thai, American, Canadian, and foods of other areas included.

They&#39;ve got an interesting variety of &#34;small plates,&#34; which are small, complete meals.  The menu also includes a &#34;frites&#34; section (fries), which has poutine in it (called disco fries).

For dessert, I tried their snicker-oreo ice cream thing, though I forget what it&#39;s called.  It was very good.  If I hadn&#39;t been going to bed in a few hours, I would have tried the capuccino-chocolate cake.  It seemed delicious, but the capuccino would have done a number on me.

This is a good place to spend an evening, but service can get a little slow. I&#39;d still go there occasionally to get a drink or a good dinner at a fair price."

The proper question to ask is whether Houlihan&#39;s tops Chilis, Friday&#39;s, and Outback -- and objectively, it does.

The burgers, salads, and wings here are pretty delicious for chain fare.  The newly condensed menu also has helped give the kitchen focus (the old menu was literally a 20 page book).  I grew up coming here many times with my parents (who are big fans), and the service has always been pleasant and prompt.  The food is also reasonably priced.

There are definitely better options in Wheaton and Naperville, but in terms of the chain restaurants nearby, Houlihan&#39;s is your best bet."

They used to have the best frigitas here and now they are no longer offered.  The menu now  is just this card thing with very few selections. Not being too hungry I ordered soup and had them make cheese fries. The cheese fries were good but I didn&#39;t get many. The Soup however was very good. I must say if I was just going for soup Houlihans would be on my list of places to go. I had the french onion and tried some of my boyfriends cheese soup and both were very good. Both were fresh and hot. The service here was also top notch. Our waitress was very friendly and did a great job. The very limited menu is the reason I&#39;m giving Houlihan&#39;s such a low rating.

Food was bland, limited, and mediocre as expected.  A few things floating in my drink.  The mushrooms and edamame tasted pretty good.  Salmon portion was the size of a nugget.

The best part.  The happy hour drinks were supposed to be $4.  Of course, my bill came and I was charged $8 per drink.  I quickly questioned my waiter and he blew it off as some mistake...YEAH RIGHT!  He never told me about the happy hour or offered me the HH menu.  I only knew from looking online.

We ordered the chipotle chicken nachos and the disco fries both were pretty decent with the nachos being huge although for $10 I would kinda expect that. The fries were almost over seasoned which is hard to do but they accomplished salt lick status. The french onion soup was good as expected and the stuffed mushrooms were what I always remembered them to be. Nothing great nothing bad.

a tiny bit of chicken, drizzled with BBQ sauce and probably no more than a tablespoon of cheese.

I&#39;ve never had great service here, though, so that&#39;s a major downer. 

I primarily like to go during the week for their cheap long island iced tea special - it really can&#39;t be beat for value on booze. The patio is a nice touch in the summer but keep in mind you&#39;re basically sitting in the parking lot - not much to look at.

I was super hungry, looking for a good burger.  Let me preface this by saying I am anything but picky; several years in the Army have led me to eat almost anything as long as it&#39;s not breathing.  I ordered a big juicy looking burger, when it arrived it looked fantastic -fries were satisfactory, burger APPEARED ok.  When I lifted the burger to apply my ketchup I noticed some brown spots on the lettuce.  I assumed the lettuce was simply old and would happily discard, eat, and not say a word.  Upon closer inspection the brown spot had a thick consistency.  Hmmm, was it dirt, or something worse???  I ran my fingernail across the top and fetched a heaping lump of mud!  Not in just one spot, but a few nickel sized spots on the lettuce.  I politely informed the waitress that she can take it back (as I watched my wife and 2 toddlers eating....).  She insisted on bringing substitutions for me; but I politely declined (I only eat mud burgers on Tuesdays).  Alas, the manager appeared.  Typical apology would be forthcoming I assumed.  Nope.  He insisted that they wash the lettuce (not this time obviously), and continued to repeat &#34;we&#39;re not charging you...so we fixed it..OK!&#34;  No, not ok.  He gave a few &#34;houlihan&#39;s lotto ticket things&#34;, Which I deposited in the closest trash can upon leaving.  

Again, I understand where food comes from and have worked in a kitchen or two.  This lettuce wasn&#39;t coming from a backyard organic garden; this was shipped across country, left to fester in the back kitchen, then served to me and my kiddos.  

Never coming back Houlihan&#39;s."

This place was packed!  Hubby was seated even though I wasn&#39;t there yet and the waitress took care of him.

When I got there, she appeared asking for my drink order and mentioned no pressure on picking our food.  We decided to only eat appetizers.  The calamari was ok - fresh, but kind of greasy.  At least it didn&#39;t taste like rubber bands!  Have you had that?  Yuck!  The bruschetta was like chopped up tomatoes with cream cheese.  Kind of different and not for me.  The chicken nachos were great as well as the quesadillas.  How can you screw those up?

The waitress we had really hustled.  We figured that she had a large area that she was covering, but she still managed to keep tabs on us.  We told her we didn&#39;t have a lot of time and she remembered, being prompt with the check and some takeout boxes.

Going to these chains is such a hit or miss,  one place can be wonderful while the other one sucks.  This place to quite Eric H. was &#34;surprisingly good&#34;."

The burgers are always a hit with my husband, and so are the fries.  I enjoy these chains mostly because of the decorations - antiques, etc.  Servers can be iffy - we have had some great ones, we have had some crap ones.

we started with the cheesy lavosh with spinach dip, moved on to fish tacos, grilled chicken with mushrooms, onions &amp; swiss and the balsamic chicken panini. finished off with some crazy desserts. the desserts were neat because you could get mini desserts. $2 each 3 for $5.

I used to frequent the GAH quite some time ago and when their nearly entire staff - many of whom I grew fond of! - left, I stopped visiting, too. It&#39;s not so fun to go into a place with entirely new staff each time you visit.

Anywho, a friend and I decided to come here for old times&#39; sake recently and we enjoyed a great meal! We each had a burger - him veggie and me bacon cheeseburger! - and we both loved what we got. We also split the fried pickles because...duh. (Get theirs! They are so good!) And because it&#39;s what we do, we also each got a beer flight. We loved everything and had a great time in our old spot!

We mainly selected the restaurant based on the positive reviews on Yelp, however after the horrible experience with the service we will never return.

I asked our waitress on a recommendation for a beer to go with my meal. The beer she suggested  came out skunky and flat and when I mentioned it to the waitress she argued with me saying that I was the only one to EVER make that complaint. After a couple of minutes of back and forth she took it back but still charged us for it on our check.

My message to the restaurants is this; the service in your restaurant is the first and last impression that will be left on your guests. With bad service everything else doesn&#39;t matter.

Service: Good, very kind young lady was an attentive waitress.

Hungry after a very long day, she stumbled on the Geneva Ale House. Her mapping software brought us to the wrong spot, but after circling the block and looking up at the sign, we were amazed the place didn&#39;t jump out and bite us!

We walked in and were surrounded by regulars. We chose a table about half way back. The bartender/server took good care of us. They have a late night menu and I would easily go back to grab a bite from that menu again. 

We tried the Door County Cheese Curds. At half price, they were perfect!  I would not have been happy paying full price for the portion that appeared in front of us. They were definitely tasty though. The burger was good and the soup was very good. My hubby wanted a grilled cheese sandwich (to-go) and he was happy by the time he was able to eat it. 

Overall, the Geneva Ale House was a good fit for our needs that evening. For late night eats, it&#39;s a win. As far as their regular menu, I&#39;ll have to visit again to find out."

We weren&#39;t here for a romantic date, I was lazy and didn&#39;t feel like cooking, and why not get out of the house on a Friday night?  Geneva Ale House was the perfect spot for a cozy, casual date.  The beer list is a hit, I had the Sierra Nevada Otra Vez and later a chocolate porter.  There were a lot of predictable choices (Two Brothers) as well as some different ones, so there&#39;s something for everyone.

I had the Campfire Burger, cooked medium, and served with a maple BBQ sauce and pork belly on a pretzel roll.  The burger and sauce were fantastic, the subtle smoky flavor complemented the sweet maple.  The pork belly was a thick, overcooked slab that was too chewy - the burger would have been fine without it!

We shared the cheese curds with a bacon aioli.  These were good, but the portion was small for the price.

I liked the neighborhood feel of the place, especially since there are newer, more trendy restaurants popping up in the area.  Geneva Ale House is a little less yuppie than those places.  The food is good, and the service was great too.  I&#39;d go back for another burger or even just for a beer or two."

We were seated right away at a table next to the window. There were a lot of other patrons at the restaurant, but it wasn&#39;t too crowded. I loved the exposed brick throughout the entire restaurant too.

Another thing I loved about dining here was that they served Cider Boys cider. Most places only carry Angry Orchard cider, so I like when bars and restaurants carry more of a variety.

We ordered the cheese curds for an appetizer and the bacon aioli dipping sauce that comes with it was amazing.  My entree, however, left much to be desired. I ordered the fish tacos (because I LOVE fish tacos) and I&#39;m afraid they might not have been cooked all the way. They tasted ok, but I was sick the entire night. :( When I showed my husband the picture of my meal, he couldn&#39;t believe that I ate the food. And, now that I take a closer look at it, the fish in the tacos does look a bit translucent. For a split second, I did think that it smelled  little fishy, but I was so hungry that I ate them all.

Not a big deal, so we stayed and headed to the bar. The beer selection here is fantastic- particularly for the canned/bottled beer. I ordered a chocolate cherry stout which was delicious.

We were seated no more than 7 minutes after arrival, with the hostess finding us directly to seat us. We got the dreaded booth spot closest to the door and window, but overall it wasn&#39;t too chilly there. Waters came out after that and we met our nice waitress shortly after that as well.

The ale house is long and skinny, a little cramped, but not too loud where we couldn&#39;t hear each other. The vibe is upbeat, and there is a lot of families there, which was a little surprising, seeing as it is a bar with a strong beer emphasis. 

Our group of 4 ordered the fried cheese curds, because what could be better than fried cheese?? The app was small, more appropriate for two than 4 people. The curds were crispy, with a cheddar? cheese in the middle, but were more breading and air than cheese. The bacon aioli side looked amazing- big chunks of bacon in a thick dip- (I was told it was good), but I couldn&#39;t have it due to Lenten obligations.

I ordered the fish and chips as my meal. It was nice to see a few fish options and 2 veggie burger options to satisfy my no-meat Friday! My counterparts ordered burgers-including the burger sammied between to grilled cheeses. Shortly after ordering, the waitress told us the food would be right out. We were starving, so this was great news, until the food didn&#39;t arrive for 45 minutes!! Majorly upsetting. I get that sometimes a burger or fish dish may take longer, but feel if this is known up front, we should&#39;ve been told this upfront so our hopes wouldn&#39;t have been so high.

Once the food arrived, I received a large plate of fried catfish and fries. The pieces were thin but so LONG! They barely fit diagonally in the take-out box. The fish had a clean flavor and was delicious. Their tartar sauce was SUPER lemony, which wasn&#39;t unpleasant, but definitely different. The fries were hot and good, but I&#39;ve had better. The coleslaw was majorly funky, though. I took a bite and immediately thought I had eaten bacon. Upon asking, the waitress stated it&#39;s just how it&#39;s seasoned. But it was bitter and so artificially smoky-smelling that one bite was more than enough. The fact that I threw up the next day two made me wonder about that stuff.

Overall, everyone liked but not loved their food and experience here. I&#39;d come back for the beer, but that&#39;s about it."

I noticed the last time I stopped in for dinner, and it had been awhile, that the place was very quiet during prime time dinner time.  Never used to be that way.  Here&#39;s my take, and I offer it as an opportunity for the owner to think about making some changes.

First is the staff.  The bartender, a girl with black hair and has been there forever, needs to get a personality.  Really.  She seems out of it.  Never says hello, barely acknowledges customers, and even for regulars.  She seems miserable.  FYI- The servers are nice, and a couple of them very sweet, but it only takes one.  Second, the food.  The burgers are so good, well seasoned, quality meat, but always overdone.  The cooks can&#39;t get it right.  When you upgrade to a 15 dollar burger you need to get it right and they never, ever do!  We noticed the buns weren&#39;t fresh this last time which really sucked, and the fries seem to have changed to try to keep pace with their restaurant neighbors, i.e. Seasoned.  I prefer traditional, crispy fries.

So, we will likely stick with the Nobel House for pub grub, or one of the other pubs in St. Charles, at least for now.  That said, get some friendly bartenders who don&#39;t have that far away look in their eyes, some cooks who know the difference between medium and well done, and we will return."

First and foremost, they have an amazing beer selection, one of the best in the Tri-Cities. The vast majority of it is bottled, however. They have Church Street Heavenly Helles, one of myfaves, so major props for that. 

I&#39;m not one to go to a bar just to drink; there needs to be some good grub to go with it. And the ale House delivers. Their black forest turkey sandwich is one of the best turkey sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had. A lot of turkey with smoked bacon and honey mustard on a pretzel roll, it&#39;s an excellent combo. Also, don&#39;t skip the onion rings. they come out thick and crispy with a side of spicy ranch with avocado mixed in. Also, when you first bite into the ring, the whole onion doesn&#39;t come out, which is a cardinal sin. The ale house burger is very good as well. Mine was cooked perfectly medium, although I wish the patty could have been a little thicker. It just seemed I had more pretzel roll than burger. Also, they have very good fresh cut fries, which I like to dip in their garlic aioli. 

The service was very friendly and attentive as well, Corrine was a sweetheart. I do wish there was more bar space, as it can fill up quickly. I enjoy coming here a couple of times a year and will continue to do so."

Service was good though. I had the shrimp po&#39;boy which was good but the ciabatta was soooo bready. They should have hollowed it out some; hard to eat and too much bread. Cajun fries were good. My friend got the sweet potato fries and she was repulsed by them. But her garbanzo burger was decent she said. And my sister got the artichoke panini which I think would have been perfect if it wasn&#39;t burnt. Also, look for bones in there. Not bad overall. Would probably return.

This is for the crafty beer tourist who gets caught in the trap believing that nothing is actually something, or your a local who drinks Geneva Kool Aid with the willingness to wait for extended periods of time for a table of glorified bar food.

The wait staff and &#34;some&#34; bar tenders all wear rose colored glasses...because they are all on vacation congregating at the kitchen door. That&#39;s a jam session that just doesn&#39;t end.

By all means, don&#39;t ask for a domestic beer, you&#39;ll receive a quip...&#34;not at this establishment&#34;. In my opinion, PBR is the original craft beer...remember, it won a Blue Ribbon!

The burgers are hit or miss with a choice of Angus, Grass Fed, Wagyu or Dry Aged with an up charge for each selection. My question, how do you really know? However rest assured, the obligatory fish taco is on the menu!  Damn, most side sauces offered to compliment your meal are the equivalent of a scoop of Hellmann&#39;s.

The fish tacos were really fresh and well prepared.  Of course, there is a wide range of beers and a knowledgeable staff to help you decide among all the options.  Definitely will be back."

A whole damn legal sized sheet of paper&#39;s worth... and with a teeny font to boot. They also offer a few beers on draft (I had a very tasty coffee porter whose name escapes me at the moment, probably something &#34;edgy&#34; like BREWED AWAKENING).

We started out with the prosciutto/mozz sticks, which were good, but we couldn&#39;t taste the prosciutto. Husband got the fish tacos, and each taco had about 1/3 of a tilapia filet on it, like the size of a fish stick. :( He wasn&#39;t too keen on his food. However, I loved what I got: the chorizo burger. Half chorizo, half chuck, with fried jalapenos, chihuahua cheese, and this delightful spicy strawberry jam. We also split a pretzel bread pudding - also good, but needed more of the Kahlua ice cream that accompanied it.

All in all, it was good. I am not eager to go back right away but it would be a fun place to take a few of our friends once or twice. I&#39;d like to try their other burger offerings, especially since they offer wagyu and grass fed beef."

I was stoked to see a bottled beer menu in the hundreds and an unpretentious draft selection. I went for a flight and was content with several of my choices. We weren&#39;t in the market for food, but we did manage to try the cheese curds. The curds boasted crispy breading, semi-firm cheese, and a logical price of $5.99. My complaint would be that there were a lot of fried bits at the bottom of the serving bowl, and the accompanied bacon aioli didn&#39;t lend much to the overall dish. Service was quick and responsive. TV&#39;s aplenty and easily accommodating of our sports viewing pleasure. I&#39;d unquestionably recommend this joint to a friend or fellow Yelper, and will likely stop in the next time we&#39;re in old Geneva town."

My wife and I used to live in St. Charles and really miss the vibrant restaurant scene so we were excited to try a place that didn&#39;t exist when we were foodies in this area.  Especially with solid yelp reviews!

I am always nervous when reviewing an Alehouse especially when we&#39;re eating.  Many times I have come across very imbalanced restauralehouses that try to straddle the fence and fail on both accounts.

I&#39;ll start with the beer menu... A+
For a two year old Alehouse the investment they&#39;ve placed in their craft beer menu is really amazing.  Very impressive!

We started our dinner with an appetizer order of cheese curds and calamari.

The cheese curds were cooked perfectly and fried the same. A+. But I will not remember them.  Because the were fully upstaged by the cheesy bacon grease sauce they were served with. A++++++++
I could go into detail about this sauce that changed my life........ But I won&#39;t.  You have to try it yourself to understand.  ;)

The calamari was prepared well and unique, but the sauce was practically all mayo and there was a clump of calamari stuck together the size of a softball. B-

I decided to order soup and an appetizer for my dinner.  

The soup of the day was described by our waitress as &#34;chicken and rice&#34;.......  For me that is the dry toast of the soup world.  So I went with the French onion (a classic!).

The frog onion soup tasted good.... But failed the crusty melted phenomenal cheese test.  B.    Gotta broil the cheese people!!!

I  had for dinner the pork belly tacos with roasted poblano sauce and peaches. A++
Only two complaints.... 1. The poblano sauce burnt my face off.  2. More pork belly of course!

I was really impressed with both the beer selection and the quality and uniqueness of the food.  Ambiance is minimal and service got the job done.  I&#39;ll be back!"

They had a great beer selection and the food menu looked awesome as well.  Our server was great and answered all the questions we had about the beers.

I ordered the Cubano sandwich and my friend ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich.  Hers was good but mine was the bomb.com.  So so good. The meat was very tender and the flavor combo was kick a**.  Yum.  Plus there was plenty of food so I got to enjoy mine a few days later.

I wish this place was closer to home because I definitely want to go again and check out more of the beer list.  I think they change it frequently too so there is more to check out all the time!"

IMO one of the best craft beer pubs in the Chicago area ... fantastic bottle beer list and an excellent offering of drafts on their rotating taps.

I think their Campfire cheeseburger is the best burger in the area and so is their mozzarella &amp; prosciutto sticks!  The food overall is very good, my only complaint would be that sometimes they overcook my burger.  

The core staff is very good; Brian and Laurie have always taken very good care of us.  So if you&#39;re looking for great beer and burgers give the Geneva Ale House a try!

When you&#39;re asked to pay $14 for a burger, it better be decent. This was literally the worst cheeseburger I have ever eaten. Completely dry, flavorless and overcooked; I ordered it medium-rare. I had my guest taste it to make sure I wasn&#39;t crazy(due to the ridiculous price for a burger) and she spit her bite out. 

2 burgers, 4 beers, and an appetizer ended up being $70. The price and inedible burgers really ruined our night.

That being said, the beer selection was impressive and the waitress was nice, which is why I didn&#39;t give 1 star.

Go for the beer, skip the food."

They have a decent draft beer selection, but a huge bottle beer selection and their bottle prices are pretty reasonable.  We decided to try the cheese curds as an appetizer and they were just okay, although the bacon aioli that was served with them was great.  I decided to have the burger as the main course, served on a toasted pretzel roll with fries, it was cooked to perfection and had a great flavor.  They have some interesting looking desserts on the menu, but I was so stuffed from the burger I didn&#39;t have room to try one.  Our server was great and the place was clean and neat.

My friends and I wanted a place for a late night bite to eat and another place wasn&#39;t so nice to us so we left. I ordered the Cubano and it was a pretty good sandwich-especially with it being so late night. The chips were delicious and it was a good balance.

I was a little sad to see and taste that one of their beers on tap that I ordered at the time wasn&#39;t so, instead I got a lukewarm beer from a pitcher poured into a glass. The experience made it harder for me to order another beer so after I finished I drank water until I left."

I think a little tweaking to the menu and some interest on the walls would really pick this place up.

The beer selection at the Geneva Ale House cannot be beat locally. The menu offers an incredible range of domestic and international beers, and they frequently change with the seasons. The bartenders are very good about making recommendations based on your interests, likes/dislikes.

The food at the Ale House is your typical bar fare: burgers, onion rings, etc. They do have a few interesting items, such as Chicken and Waffles or Slow Roasted Pork Belly Tacos, but I usually order the mini chicken sandwiches, as there are not very many items that interest me (I am not so much a fan of waffles with sriracha, personally, and whomever created the menu must not have been either, as it is very badly misspelled on there!). The mini sandwiches are fine, but nothing special.

The decor is a bit lacking - there are a handful of random pictures and beer signs on the red-painted walls, but nothing that says &#34;ale house&#34; or even &#34;Geneva.&#34; It actually bothers me that the decor is so generic.

The staff is not overly friendly here either, which I suppose is also part of the reason my husband and I do not often come. They serve you as needed, but do not go out of their way to check on you or chat.

Overall, I would say this is a middle-of-the-road bar/restaurant with the potential to be much more."

I was sold on this place because they have cheese curds on the menu - a rare thing for Illinois, though not so much Wisconsin.

We got here on a Saturday night for dinner around 7 - prime time for sure!  Yes, there was a wait, and the place is smaller than I imagined so the bar area in the back was pretty crowded as many were waiting for tables.  I felt bad for the restaurant staff who had to work around this crowd hovering around the bar area.  I think the set up is a little awkward in here, especially for the dinner crowd.  

Once we were seated, about 20ish minutes later, I forgot about the chaos of the wait.  In fact, while we were waiting we grabbed a beer - their menu is extensive and I know ZERO about craft beer so I grabbed an Ace Pumpkin Cider being October and all, and I had this beer a few weeks ago while out to lunch.  

We got seated and our service was great - we settled on a few appetizers and a flight of beer each.  You can get a flight of three beers for $9 which was fine by me, again I know nothing about beer so based on the descriptions I choose three and they paired well with my food.  As for our appetizers we were VERY pleased....we got the cheese curds and the bacon aioli to dip it in was AWESOME! I&#39;m used to marinara or ranch but this was great.  We got the October &#34;special&#34; appetizer - mozzarella and prosciutto sticks which were mozzarella sticks but the cheese was wrapped with prosciutto and breaded and OH SO GOOD!  We also split an order of sliders which came on little pretzel rolls.  Everything was great, we were very satisfied, and for dessert we got the fried cheesecake.  I highly recommend this place...though I&#39;d suggest coming during on peak times if you don&#39;t want to wait."

I had never been there and didnt know it was so small. I had been communicating with the manager via email about this reservation and he assured me it would be no problem. When I called to confirm I was told they dont hold tables so I was a little worried as this was a business function. I was also told he had my name and # and if there was an issue they would call me. As luck would have it there were no issues and we were seated immediately. The server was prompt and friendly. My only issue was the noise level. It is very loud. The server could hardly hear us. I also wished she had told us when we ordered that the appetizer portions were small and we would need double. But we just ordered more.  We tried the calamari which didnt look real appetizing to me but everyone ate it. We also tried the fried pickles which were pretty tart. The chicken quesedilla was good and the cheese curds were as well. But again, small portions. I had the burger with cheddar, onion straws and bbq sauce. I ordered it medium, it wasnt. The chips were very good. The bun a little dry. I would probably go back, great place to watch a game it seems or gather after work."

Kelly &amp; I arrived on a Friday night at 6:30.  I had read reviews that the place gets really busy &amp; was expecting a post work/happy hour Friday night crowd.  We walked in and were told about 20 minutes.  There was a seat at the bar so we waited there.   

The overall feel of this place is very warm with burgundyish colored walls.  It&#39;s fairly small inside as well with 10-15 tables.  There was only 1 stool at the bar so she sat while I stood.  We were given the beer menu.  Quite the extensive beer menu! I&#39;d say in total maybe 150-160 beers to choose from, but none of your standard domestic beers. The beers are all sorted by types: IPA, ciders, stouts, ambers, growlers, etc. I tend to like the lighter, cleaner, crisper, sweeter beers while Kelly loves her a good chocolatey stout.  Luckily, she had an app that describes the beers.  I went with a honey amber which was pretty good.  Kelly ordered some birthday cake/batter beer which she really enjoyed.  

The hostess came &amp; got us about 30-40 minutes after we had arrived. It was a little disappointed we waited longer than expected but from what we could see, nobody had even left while we&#39;d been there.  The waitress we had was very good, nice, etc.   We ordered the fried cheese curds with bacon aioli as an appetizer to start.  They were very good. The aioli was way more mayonnaise than bacon IMO but it complemented the curd well.  We both ordered burgers.  Kelly had the Alehouse burger (bacon, fried egg, cheese, grilled onion) with house chips while I had the Campfire burger (cheddar, maple BBQ pork belly, onion straws &amp; maple chipotle BBQ sauce) with sweet tater fries.   I ordered a flight of beer while she ordered a growler of the creme brûlée beer which she had before &amp; loves.  The beer flight was a nice deal but I wasn&#39;t in love with any of the 3 options I had selected.  

As far as the burgers and sides,  Kelly had a burgorgasm.  She loved it and the house chips.   My burger was pretty good!  It wasn&#39;t quite as juicy as I&#39;d hoped &amp; I didn&#39;t really taste the pork belly all that much but was a good burger nonetheless &amp; one I would order again. .  The chipotle BBQ sauce was a little spicy but not bad at all.  I don&#39;t do spice &amp; I could handle this level of heat. It&#39;s a laid back, subtle heat that just says &#34;hello vicar&#34; after a bit.    The sweet tater fries were very good!  I&#39;d go back just for the beer options &amp; these fries alone.   Hot, soft, fresh with some sea salt on them.   

Service on the night was very good.  Our waitress stopped by at just the right times &amp; my water glass was never really empty.    No complaints at all, especially given how busy this place was. 

Overall, a very enjoyable experience &amp; I look forward to trying to broaden my beer palette here.   We&#39;ll definitely be back!"

We started with the Door County Cheese Curds Beer Battered with bacon aioli for $5.95.  Holy smokes!  We love cheese.  We love bacon.  There is nothing wrong with this app!  Nothing at all!

I had the Roasted Veggie Panini Roasted zucchini, yellow squash, eggplant, red and 
yellow bell peppers with provolone and balsamic reduction and a side of fried brussel sprouts for $7.95.  The sandwich was really good.  The sprouts, to my dismay, were not good at all!  They were over fried, burnt, and had no seasoning.  I was pretty disappointed by this because I love brussel sprouts...

My mom had the Mini Sandwiches Choose a combination of three, all served on Turano mini pretzel rolls for $10.95 Mini Filet Medallions, Mini Pulled Pork, Mini Salmon).  She really enjoyed these as her main dish instead of an app.  Each one had pretty good flavor.

My dad and the boy had the The Grilled Cheese Burger 8oz Certified Angus Beef between two grilled cheese sandwiches topped with cheddar cheese for $11.95.  They are crazy if you ask me, but they loved it!  The burgers were juicy, but there was just a lot of bread!

We enjoyed trying a bunch of different drinks on the menu.  I love that more and more places are moving to the craft beer (cider) options to give us more variety!  This is a great little place to hit in a great little downtown area!"

BEER -  They have an extensive beer menu that includes roughly 150 crafts.  Their selection is broad enough to please any palette and features a good deal of choices that I really enjoy.  Like others that carry this large of an assortment, their beer menu rotates so you may want to do your homework prior to visiting: http://www.beermenus.com/places/1378-geneva-ale-house

FOOD -  I tend to choose light sandwich&#39;s more often than not and have had their Ale House BLT with sweet potato fries each time.  Good sandwich..but it&#39;s hard to screw up a BLT.  If not for the BLT I&#39;d have an easy time finding something else here.  Their menu has great range.

OTHER - If this place is busy you may have a tough time enjoying yourself.  It&#39;s small and narrow.  It isn&#39;t cramped and table space is fine though. I&#39;ve eaten here three times now and never walked out disappointed, yet, the ambiance here is a bit lacking."

Simple interior, but good decor, lots of flat screens to catch the game.

Excellent sandwiches, appetizers, and entrees as well. Hearty fare to go with heavier beers, or lighter fare for dieters. Stuff for vegetarians too, including an amazing sounding quinoa burger.

I had the BLT with a side of sweet potatoes fries--it was a great blt with a neat special sauce. Crunchy bread, excellent, thick-cut bacon. The sweet potato fries were overcooked and burnt tasting, topped with a sprinkle of powdered sugar. I had a bottle of the Dogfish Head Peche and hated it, so I ordered a sprite and made my own shandy--much better.

He had the quesadillas and ordered an extra side, of fries. Delicious fries, well cut, seasoned perfectly which come with a little dipping sauce which tasted like mayo, sour cream, and some sort of herb. Very tasty indeed. The guacamole that came with the quesadilla had a spicy bite that I enjoyed.

Would come back in a heartbeat! I know it gets aweful busy on weekend nights, so Sunday lunch was busy but roomy enough to enjoy the bears vs seahawks game."

First, the place is usually dead. Which is crazy for it being located on the main drag of Geneva. (All of their customers now going to Nobel House?) The last time I was in, my food took forever (odd since they were so slow) and when it came out there was hair in it! I complained to the owner and he was a complete jerk. Didn&#39;t want to hear about it. He gave my friend a dirty look when he interjected and just refused to verbally acknowledge him. Felt racially motivated... Maybe he was just having a bad day.

It&#39;s in the old theater on State street, if you&#39;r old enough to remember there was actually a theater under the marquee. 

We ordered beers...what kind? eh for me it didn&#39;t really matter it was a white Belgium variety. I don&#39;t drink a lot of beer. I am not a beer snob. I drink Michelob. The beer was a recommendation of the waiter. If you LIKE beer, there are 4.56 million on the menu so knock yourself out. 

We ordered the cheese curds. about 5 came out to us in a little bowl. They were really good, but if you want to share with more than 1 person, order more than one. The dipping sauce tasted like mayo with some bacon in it. You&#39;d think that would taste good but it really does taste like a mouthful of mayo...with a little bacon. It&#39;s a little gross. I know, because you see &#34;Bacon Aoli&#34; and you think WIN...not a win. wished for a different dipping sauce. 

I ordered the special burger - 50% ground beef and 50% andouille. Although their andouille was very mild, the addition was totally welcome. It was a nice flavor. The burger came with asaigo cheese and sauteed peppers. messy but all of it worked really well.

My husband ordered the Cubano which was the best Cubano I have ever tasted and it can feed 17 people...or two. The pulled pork was really well done and it was on great bread. Seriously, this may be the best thing on their menu. 

We both ordered the sweet potato fries. The small one had the cheeseburger kids menu with regular fries and upon tasting one, I realized that the sweet potato fries are the better option for sure. They are crisp and light and soft inside and salted perfectly. Get them. 

The only downside really is that the total bill was a little pricey, even for Geneva, even for pretentious beer. I don&#39;t expect Panera prices, but it was a little more than it needed to be.

Last thing - waitstaff was nice, courteous, helpful and quick."

I was not thrilled with the choice of vegetable that came with it (asparagus) but it was still good, just not much of it. My salad was good too and my husband seemed to like his entree okay (the Mediterranean salad).

The acoustics here make it challenging to talk. This will not be a calm, talk to your friends or family while you have a relaxed dinner (at least not on a weekend). The place has limited seating and is LOUD (again, we went on a Saturday night).

They had a special of 50% off food after 10pm and that&#39;s right when we sat down. We shared the cheese curds as an appetizer and they were delicious, lightly breaded and the sauce was great. I had the grilled cheese with bacon and house made chips- it really hit the spot! The chips were perfect, thing and crunchy. I also got to try a bite of the sriracha chicken and blue cheese waffles, which was pretty spicy, and had to many conflicting flavors IMO. Another member of our party got the Irish Cobb salad with corned beef and she really enjoyed it. Hubby had fish, and he thought it was good but lacked a little flavor. I would definitely come back if in the area, food was high quality (not typical bar food), and the service was excellent. After 10pm in July it can be considered only 1 $, instead of 2."

Among the food highlights were onion rings (mild, nicely battered, good flavor), Caesar salad ( crisp &amp; delicious), sweet potato fries (the best I&#39;ve had: crisp, sweet &amp; salted just right), and pork belly taco appetizer. A Cubano sandwich also got good marks from one diner. My salmon was overcooked, though, and the accompanying asparagus was not delightfully fresh. Another diner&#39;s fish tacos had two good tacos, but a third was &#34;off&#34; and inedible. Fried calamari was OK. The menu has some odd ingredient mixes, and jalapeno seems to dominate as an accent (though the heat was not overwhelming in anything I tasted).

The Ale House is a fun place for a group get-together. My advice would be to stick with the sandwiches &amp; appetizers, and enjoy the variety of craft beers."

I ordered the Irish Cobb Salad that was recommended by our server too. The salad had corn beef on top, fresh cucumbers, bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, hard boiled egg and onions in a light cucumber dressing.

I used to consider the burgers at Geneva Ale House to be one of the best in the suburbs, but that opinion doesn&#39;t hold up anymore.

Also, the staff that used to be very friendly and social has completely turned over, and is now being run by an entire new group of people.  I&#39;m not sure if the place is under new management or it was sold, but things have definitely not changed for the better.  Nothing here really wows me anymore.

The Cubano was absolutely fantastic. The flavor was enormous and apparently it is their best selling item. I can definitely see why.  My wife&#39;s fish was also great. She kept telling me to have a taste since we like to keep trying to find the best fish fry wherever we go. The Geneva Ale House has absolutely the most tender, fall-apart-in-your-mouth fish I have ever had. The batter was crisp and it was excellent.

Portions were great and I left there full.  The wait staff was nice and attentive also.  Just the right amount.  Just enough to meet your needs but not too much to be annoying.

If you have seen my reviews, you already know that any place that has good craft beer and burgers is a place that I need to be.  Geneva Ale House delivered on both accounts.  I had the fried cheese curd appetizer (OHMYGOD THE BACON DIPPING SAUCE) and a stuffed burger (bleu cheese, bacon, and jalapeno) and both were pretty good.  (Sidenote:  I was surprised that they asked for a temp for a stuffed burger, but I went with medium, and it came out overcooked.  BUT I expect that for a stuffed burger so I didn&#39;t get all ragey...no worries.)  The fries that came with it were decent too...but dipped in the left over sauce from the curds?  AMAZING.  My buddy also got a burger and a reuben (he&#39;s got a big appetite) and seemed to enjoy both.  The beer list was impressive enough that I had a hard time choosing and was a HUGE fan of the fact that there were some local brews on there as well.

We stopped in and they were very busy and there was a wait so we put our name in and was told it would be 20-30 minutes.  We had a beer and the bartender was extremely helpful and great with recommendations but after about a 30 minutes we went to check to see if how much longer to get a table.  We were informed a party of 8 came in (not a reservation) and all large parties are taken before those on the waiting list.  We finished our beer and left.  I have never been in a restaurant that would do that to their customers.  Personally it made me not want to go back and try the food.  I value my nights out and want a restaurant that does too!

The food was top notch. The pretzel buns on their burgers were amazing, all of the toppings on point, sides done right. The price is on point for the portion size and not much more than fast food options even though the quality is 100x better.
Items of note were the bacon dipping sauce for the cheese curds, the grilled cheese burger which uses grilled cheese sandwiches instead of buns for a burger, and the fantastic beer menu.

Not a tremendous value, but pricing was fair and on point for what you get. Beer prices were a little better than average on craft brews. I have been back a few times since my first visit and have always had good service and good food.

The fish tacos my wife ordered was just ok.  Without all the stuff they put on it they would have been bland.  The burger I had was ok, however, I asked for a side of mayo for my burger which did not have any condiments on it.  The waiter charged for mayo..HUH!!??? Who charges for a tablespoon of common condiments.  Its like asking for ketchup and being charged 50 cents.  You should not be charging for these items especially if your order consists of food items that need these condiments.  If you do charge, out of principle, you tell your patrons this info.

Started with the cheese curds, which were fantastic. The bacon aioli was suspect at best - it may have been sitting around for a while because the oil was separating. Also got an order of the calamari. Pretty tough to mess up anything that&#39;s battered and deep fried, but this was not good. It was very rubbery and lacked flavor. If not for the dipping sauce on the side it would have been completely bland. 
The burgers were good. At our table there were two orders of the ale house burger, one chorizo burger, and one mushroom and Swiss. All got very good reviews. The only complaint I have is that I asked for my burger medium, and it was pretty rare. It still had great flavor so I ate it without any problems. There was one order of sweet potato fries at the table, the BEST sweet potato fries I&#39;ve ever had. The house made chips were meh, I wouldn&#39;t recommend them or try them again. 
Overall it was pretty good. But as some of the other reviews have said, food is hit or miss."

First the good news: Great tap selection, really good bottle selection. Good burger, other than the Turano pretzel bun that turns into a matzo cracker when you start to wolf it down...

Now, the bad news: What&#39;s with the 2&#34; of head on the Belgian ales? And why is all the beer just slightly cooler than ambient temperature? And what&#39;s with the music -- a stereo stuck ceiling high with two speakers? Really? Put a decent sound system in - please!

More bad news -- the &#34;Cubano&#34; came out looking like a quesadilla - no, really. If you can&#39;t get decent Cuban bread and a press, drop it from the menu. Most of the other sandwiches looked good, though.

Great crowd on a Friday night though. Get a good beer-tender behind the bar, upgrade the stereo, refine the menu, and this place will ROCK! Stand by for an update soon..."

My husband was a big fan...which is saying a lot, he&#39;s a tough guy to impress, food AND beer-wise. It&#39;s a small, unassuming place with little decor. When we walked in at 7:30pm on a Saturday night, the host said, &#34;Sit anywhere you&#39;d like&#34; and there was ample seating available. Not always a good sign, why wasn&#39;t the place packed for dinner? 

We were promptly greeted and ordered beers right away. While it does not have the most extensive draft menu I&#39;ve seen, the bottle and draft menu were both impressive for a small place. Lots of craft options! I think beer lovers will be pleased all around. I had Solemn Oath Mr. Innappropriate (wheat beer) and my husband ordered the Boulder Honey Saison...his was great. If you go there and they still have this, I highly suggest it. 

GET THE CHEESE CURDS. Omg, get them. They are heavenly. It&#39;s a perfect size portion for two people, maybe not four people (but then again, we can pack away a LOT of food), but they come with this amazing bacon aioli. We thought it was cheese sauce at first, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s just that flavorful. We were basically licking the bowl when we were done.

I ordered the Ale Burger, which came with LTO, grilled onions, bacon, and a fried egg. I ordered it med-rare and it came on a pretzel bun. The toppings and burger were melt-in-your-mouth, while the pretzel bun helped hold it all together. The burger patty wasn&#39;t overly juicy or messy, which was great because so many med-rare burgers I order are good but falling apart. This burger was the perfect overall texture. My husband and I both said our burgers were the most memorable we&#39;ve had in awhile!

$50 later (two burgers, two beers, one app), we were really full and happy. I was able to take half my burger home too! I ordered the fries which were just ok and a little soggy, and my husband ordered the fried onions (delicious...get those instead of the fries). I like this place because it isn&#39;t pretentious but has every right to be. If I lived in Geneva, I think I&#39;d hang out here a lot."

My wife and I spent a considerable amount of time here enjoying great beers before being seated at that other place. I was very impressed by the beer selection (admittedly, that&#39;s my barometer for most places), and loved the emphasis they put on featuring some local breweries, which is how I discovered Solemn Oath (based in Naperville).

Got there in the middle of dinner,  we were put on a short wait (no big deal), told we would get a text when our table was ready.. didnt happen.  We went to check on our table but the host forgot to text us.. ugh.

The decor is very generic, suburban brick colored paint,  medium oak stained wood, some kind of art(?) On the wall. Lots of TVs. Wasn&#39;t bad or unappealing,  but definitely not anything special. Kind of stuck between a sports bar and trendy pub


Beer list is fantastic.. great variety and the beer menu was set up well.  12 draft beers.. woot!! We werent out to drink but I was tempted... nice beer flight option available.

Menu had some nice choices, focus was on the burgers and sandwiches but also had some other items that looked interesting. The portions were large and the kitchen kept up a solid pace.

Had the cheese curds.. They were very solid,  served with a bacon aoli. .delicious.  I ordered the Campfire Burger, my wife I ordered the East Coast Cod. 

The burger was very, very good.  Perfectly cooked and tasted great. The fries were solid but the Onions on the burger were better. The best part we had was the glazed pork belly, it was perfect. Wish they had that as a sandwich..

The cod was ok.  It was kind of greasy. I liked the kimchi, brussells sprouts hash (don&#39;t know how else to describe it) my wife, not so much. It is served with a sweet and spicey mustard that I liked. The dish had potential but ended up being a &#34;Food Network&#34; or gastro pub mishmosh of cool things that had nice elements but overall didn&#39;t work.

The service was ok, the place was full and the emoyees were humping it pretty good but missed some little details like extra bbq sauce we had ordered.   They did help each other out and that was a huge plus. There didnt seem to be any management visible but like I said things went ok.

I would go back for their great beer selections, the burgers and select apps."

It&#39;s not an isolated incident either...the last time I was at this location it was JANUARY and still practically colder inside the store than outside.

It must be their way of discouraging loitering or something because this is ridiculous.

I&#39;ve ordered the Wisconsin mac &amp; cheese several times, and added parmesan chicken a few times.  The macaroni is creamy and hits the spot for a comfort food craving.  It&#39;s a little bland, but it does the job.  The chicken, however, isn&#39;t worth the $2.50.  Every time, the coating falls off the chicken and I end up eating bits of coating sans chicken.

They re-vamped this restaurant a little.  There&#39;s more seating, which was much needed.  It gets VERY busy in the summertime with students, moms with kids, and teachers.  A fancy new soda machine, and fancy salt &amp; pepper grinders.  But the siracha and hot sauce that used to be on each table are now gone.  What the heck?  I liked adding a bit of siracha to my mac, it needs a boost.

If you&#39;re an office slave, don&#39;t come here alone unless you want to listen to conversations between mothers like this one:

A mother walks in with 3 children, sits down and chats with them quietly while they eat.  A few minutes later, a second mother walks in with 2 children, and as she sits she starts asking the first mother questions about her kids.  Turns out, the 2 youngest of the 3 are twins.

&#34;OH WERE THEY IN VITRO?&#34; she loudly asks across tables.

I gobbled my last few bites, gathered my stuff and left.  I&#39;ve known women who have gone through that process.  We&#39;re talking about something very long, invasive, and emotional.  It&#39;s a personal journey.  Not something to be discussed, or overheard by, complete strangers.

Great place to take kids though, since they don&#39;t know what a uterus is yet they&#39;ll be more interested in their meatballs.  I&#39;m going to re-think it the next time I want macaroni &amp; cheese though and I&#39;ll probably go somewhere else since this establishment is overridden with moms and kids."

There were about 3 tables that were occupied in the restaurant at that time, two unmanned cashier counters that says &#34;Welcome to Noodles&#34; and one that was manned by a young lady at the far end (the sign showed pick up order only). Proceeded to one of the unmanned cashier counters.

Here&#39;s where the problem happened
1. We stood behind one of the cashier for at least 10 whole minutes waiting for service. During this whole time, the three ladies behind the counter counter (including the one manning the &#34;pick-up only&#34;) walked by us multiple times. Not a single eye contact.

2. At least two of the ladies didn&#39;t even seem to be working (e.g. preparing dishes), they were just chatting with one another and with some cooks in the kitchen.

3. The one that was manning the pick-up counter walked by us  (in front of us) a few times, never looked once at us, and never gestured us towards her.

4. After being ignored, we were getting irate and we asked if we were ever going to be served. The two ladies (that were hanging out doing nothing earlier) said &#34;Oh this counter isn&#39;t open, you need to go to the last counter&#34; - pointing at the pick-up counter lady. The cashier had a blank stare.

It&#39;s as though they just hired a bunch of high school kids who dread coming here because the parents refused to give them extra allowance and they feel forced to do some actual work. 

Sorry, but never again.

This isn&#39;t your ordinary Noodles franchise. Being located on a small, busy main street shopping district, the restaurant has a look unique to its location, rather than the familiar exterior of other locations around the Chicago area. One thing about downtown Naperville is that despite the presence of some national chains, the shops maintain a unique appearance and preserve the character of the town&#39;s main street.

The place can probably use a larger dining area, but we found a table off to the side in back of the restaurant. The vintage bare brick walls and old-fashioned exterior make it look like Noodles must have occupied the corner space for decades.

The first time we went, we had a reservation for a party of 11 for a birthday. When we arrived, we were told someone called to cancel the reservation. That definitely had not happened so I don&#39;t know what the mix up was. We had to wait a bit for a table but were eventually seated.

On that first visit, I split the chopped salad with my mom and thought it was amazing. I also had the patty melt, which was cooked to my liking and tasted great. Members of our party had all different kinds of food and drinks and everyone seemed to enjoy it. They gave us 2 servers, which was very helpful. 

On the second visit, I called to make a reservation. I gave the girl my name and the time and date I wanted and she took awhile and then said &#34;Nope. I don&#39;t see you on here&#34;. I had clearly stated I wanted to make a reservation, not that I already had one. I think their front of house staff could use some extra training.

This time, I had the French Onion Soup and the salad as my meal. Both were good, but the soup had a lot of parsley in it which ruined it for me. My brother&#39;s patty melt was not cooked well so it got sent back. My friend&#39;s burger was also cooked wrong, but she didn&#39;t want to send it back. Our server was friendly, but could have stopped by a few more times. 

Overall, I think this is a good addition to the area. Menu is varied and prices are fair. I think we will be back for sure!"

If you search through the photos on McWethy&#39;s Yelp page you will find my picture of a truly special burger I inhaled on this particular visit.

The burger itself was good.  I would not go so far as to say that their burger is the king of all burgers and people should come from miles around to eat it.  However it is a tasty burger. 
What is truly special is the fact that you can add  FOIE GRAS to the burger as a topping!!

Sweet lord nothing can top an ounce or two of seared foie gras on a juicy burger.  It was an out of body experience with each bite.  No joke.  Earth shattering foodgasm.

If you think you know what a good burger tastes like I URGE  you to get your @$$ over to McWethy&#39;s before they come to their senses and double the price of this item.   Honestly, I don&#39;t believe that there is another restaurant (other than TallGrass in Lockport) that even serves Foie Gras anywhere in Will County.  

And once again, the chef came out to see how my burger was.  HUGE!

Also, the dayside bartender is a sweetheart.  KARLA!   

I will be back VERY soon."

For starters, the dining area is very well appointed and gives you the feel you&#39;re entering an old Irish pub. The view of the golf coarse is magnificent. 

I had the Scottish Egg for my appetizer, the Braised Lamb Shank for my entree and the Pretzel Crusted Brownie for desert.

My wife enjoyed the house salad for her appetizer, a steak (don&#39;t recall the cut) for her entree and she shared my Brownie. 

My meal was outstanding. If my wife had anything derogatory to say it would be that the salad was a little over priced. 

I was very impressed with this restaurant from the moment our server indicated she was able to give me blue cheese stuffed olives in my Ketel One! That made her my newest best friend!

My recommendation is to give McWetheys a shot. If you enjoy fine dining that&#39;s not too over prices, this is your restaurant."

The first time with friends I had the steak sandwich while all the others had fish and chips. They loved their entrees while mine was tasty. However, I have had the rib eye sandwich at other restaurants with less fat and gristle.

The second time my husband and I went and we both ordered the fish and chips. The fish came out with a soft, greasy crust and the fries were also greasy. But the fish was absolutely delicious! I think because we were early that the oil was not yet hot enough for frying.

The third time my husband and one of our friends went to the Sunday brunch. It was great. The only thing that was not so good was the boneless ham at the carving station which was dry and a bit tough. It did, however, have a tasty sauce with it so all was not lost.

This Thursday I returned with the group of friends. One of my friends who had ordered the fish and chips previously and loved it was very disappointed to find it was so overcooked that it was hard bits. One of my other friends and I tried the shepherd&#39;s pie. That was, unfortunately, quite tasteless that day. We put lots of salt and pepper on it but it could have used more onion and perhaps some rosemary.
 
We will all be back, especially for the brunch. The fish and chips entree is so good perhaps I can just order it &#34;not well done&#34; or something like that to avoid the overcooking."

AMAZING ATMOSPHERE beautiful decor, Loved stamped tin ceilings x hearty woodwork ... Did not have reservation *gals @door recommended calling ahead next time however seated promptly! ENJOYED high top  seating  Server &amp; Floor Manager greeted us promptly- shared this was our FIRST visit! 

Unfortunately goes down-hill from there... 

**asked Server about &#34;recommendations&#34; ... she was only familiar w/steak sandwich... 
**asked about STEAKS on menu ... she did not know...
**asked about preparation techniques ... again answer unknown...

We went ahead X placed our order: STEAKS it w/be - how could we possibly go wrong @ $44.00 porterhouse X $38.00 ribeye ...

**we didn&#39;t read menu close enough: assumed &#34;something&#34; would come w/the meal.... No Bread / No Sides ... everything ala-carte ... $6.00 more for mashed potatoes ... $7.00 more for truffle french fries ... 

Enjoyed the atmosphere ... however waited forever for meal to come out ... as soon as it did I knew it was wrong (Porterhouse ordered MW -Ribeye M) *porterhouse came out undercooked X ribeye well done! 

Again the waiting begins!!!!! 

Server finally returns to ask what&#39;s wrong I explain  I ASSUMED the order was mixed up -- my food was ruined X the other was UNDER-cooked! SHE RESPONDED WITH &#34;no I asked some of the other servers how to order YOUR Ribeye and THEY said to order it Medium Well so I did&#34;... I told her it was ruined X she asked &#34;would I like another prepared for me  ... maybe I WOULD HAVE -HAD YOU RETURNED IN A REASONABLE TIMEFRAME- however NO Not Now! She said ok X walked away!   

Waiting again -same floor Manager from earlier comes over ... asks what&#39;s wrong (I guess he noticed I had not touched my steak other than to cut it open) I share same w/him ... he asks &#34;would you like round of drinks to make up for mistake&#34; No thank you! &#34;Ok maybe a piece of our famous chocolate cake&#34; No thank you! Ok and He walks away!! 

Out comes the check - NOTHING adjusted - Server hands us bag X says &#34;please enjoy this piece of our famous chocolate cake on the house -sorry about mix-up&#34; and walks away! 

We wait some-more ... wondering where do we pay? Server finally looks our way I flag her down ask her where do we pay and she says &#34;o you pay me&#34; and yes she walks away!  I sit another 10 minutes watching her CLEAR THE TABLE NEXT TO OURS before she returns to take the check! 

You ask??? Yes I DID still tip her (only 15%) I know she LIVES off those tips however I knew I&#39;d be Yelping about experience and that&#39;s bad enough! 

I bet w/BETTER SERVICE this would have become a favorite... however changed my mind about Easter Brunch there ....."

- The menu is interesting. A blend between ItalIan, Scottish and American Steakhouse

Clam Chowder soup: I was worried when it came because it looked thin, and not a thick cream soup. It was on the thinner side, but fantastic. Definitely homemade with fresh pieces of clam. 

Lamb Shank: Decadent!! It was huge, crispy skin outside, tender and moist inside, perfectly flavored. I will definitely order this again in the future. 

Mashed potatoes: Excellent. Creamy and buttery. 

Spinach: WARNING --- A LOT OF CHOPPED GARLIC ADDED IN. I still give a 5 star rating, but I highly recommend if your dish comes with spinach....ask for &#34;easy garlic&#34;.  (I couldn&#39;t even eat it)

Cafe Latte: Awesome. Very bold flavor and fresh, with great amount of foam on top. 

----Lastly is the VIEW outside. It&#39;s on a golf course and while you&#39;re eating you can just gaze at small lakes, hills, and trees. Truly beautiful atmosphere, both inside the restaurant and outside."

The food is solid for the area, nothing amazing but it&#39;s also not overpriced so it doesn&#39;t disappoint.  The drinks are all reasonably priced and there really are some standout dishes on the menu.  

They recently changed some of the items they offer, and I kinda miss some of the old items.  I think the menu could be broadened just a little bit because there really are only about 6 items that aren&#39;t considered sandwiches.  Lastly, I&#39;d prefer that the steaks came with a side of some sort, everything is a la carte.

Overall, we would definitely recommend the place and hope they strive to keep the quality of food and service they started off with!"

We went at 8:15on a Saturday night, and it was pretty busy when we arrived. We got seated right away though.

We ordered the pretzel bites for an appetizer. They were okay- not my favorite. And wish they would&#39;ve come with a better dipping sauce, but they come with horsie sauce. Nothing beats pretzels and cheese dip, so that was disappointing.

I ordered a cheeseburger with fries, and the husband ordered the steak sandwich and chips. His steak sandwich is a bit fatty; he said he would get a burger next time. My burger was cooked perfectly- had lots of flavor! And the bun was definitely homemade. Yum!

So why the 3 stars?

It seemed to take forever for our main dishes to come out, which was strange because by that time there weren&#39;t many other patrons in there. The service sucked though. Our waitress only has our table and two others nearby, and she didn&#39;t even refill our drinks once. To me, that&#39;s unacceptable if you&#39;re not busy.

Cool atmosphere, decent food, but to me it was overpriced a lot($12 just for a burger: anything you want to add on is $1 each- like bacon or an egg. You could easily end up with a $15 burger for the works!), and subpar service.

Not sure we&#39;ll return."

There&#39;s a Scottish theme to the decor and the menu, but they have a wide variety of options. We got gnocchi (fried), shepherd&#39;s pie, short rib pappardelle, and crab mac n cheese. We liked all of it, all very solid. They had a good number of beers on tap too, though the selections didn&#39;t really overlap with my tastes much. But I&#39;m sure that changes. They did have La Fin Du Monde on tap, which you don&#39;t see often and was really good. Chimay Red in bottles too. We also tried a scotchocolate winter cocktail, which was not bad when fresh out and still warm, but didn&#39;t age well as it cooled.

They are still working out a few kinks in the service I think, but everyone was very friendly. The environment is great. Dimly lit and comfortable, with a bar section and a big dining room complete with giant fireplace. It&#39;s a brand new building I believe, but they&#39;ve really done a good job making it feel old world.

We took visiting friends with us and had dinner on the 3rd night after the opening. All of us agree, food, decor, ambiance, service and food were excellent!!
We started out at the bar for a pre-dinner beer. It&#39;s a very nice area with comfortable seating and lots of tables and booths for eating there. 
The dining room, overlooking the golf course, boasts a beautiful arched wood ceiling with beams and a welcoming fireplace. 
Our waitress Liz was very welcoming, and on point with recommendations (I appreciate it when servers had actually tried the food) and very efficient. The food was well paced throughout the meal. 
We started with a flatbread with Italian sausage -the spicy sausage was a tasty counterpoint to the fresh mozzarella and arugula and the serving was generous enough for 4 of us. 
McWethys has a large, varied menu at a variety of price points - from pricier grilled meats to sandwiches. The only nod to Scottish cuisine was the fish and chips and shepherds pie (which we will try next time). One of us tried the steak sandwich, 2 had the pappardelle with short rib and I had the coconut shrimp. All were fantastic. Before our entrees, we had soups (very good, cheesy French onion soup and the daily special an excellent shrimp and potato concoction.) we also had a side dish of the tasty crispy Brussels sprouts with bacon. 
I loved the coconut shrimp that were served with a spicy chili sauce and citrus slaw (would have liked a carb as well, but a minor quibble ). The homemade pappardelle with mushrooms and tender short rib was amazing and so generously  portioned it was enough for a second tasty meal. The steak sandwich with crispy skin on fries was equally generously portioned and delicious.  Needless to say, we were too full to try dessert - this visit. 
We had an opportunity to speak with the Chef, who was very gracious. In fact, the entire staff was very welcoming and well trained, not always the case in a new restaurant. 
Don&#39;t miss the restrooms they are quite luxurious - each is a separate room with well appointed decor and interesting murals of Scottish cities.
We can&#39;t wait to return - McWethys is a marvelous improvement to the dining options In our area"

The restaurant itself and the view of the grounds are absolutely gorgeous. On our first visit we arrived around 8pm on a Saturday, so it was not very crowded. Our server was wonderful, very attentive and genuinely cared that we enjoyed our meal. Our second visit was around 5pm on a Saturday, so we called ahead to make reservations, and were able to do so easily. The host sat us in the bar area which is not nearly as nice as the dining room, so I was a bit disappointed in that. The food is good, but some of the items (specifically the onion soup) are a bit lacking in flavor.  On our first visit I had the whiskey cream prawns, and did not care for them at all. Our server and the manager did offer to replace my meal with something else, but I (a) didn&#39;t want to waste that much food as I was already full and (b) didn&#39;t think it was entirely their fault that I didn&#39;t like the entree. On our second visit I had the house made peppardelle and it was good, but not as good as I was expecting based on the reviews I had read. My two absolute favorite items on the menu are the pretzel brownie sundae, and the hazelnut cappucino; I&#39;d go there just for those two things, and the VIEW!

In special instructions asked for table by window. I did this once before without a problem.
My husband and I have been here a few times before however  my friend (birthday girl) and her husband have never been .
On Thursday I called and asked if they have a birthday cake or something similar for the table.
The lady I spoke to said yes, can bring brownie with ice cream , candle etc. to the table.  At this time I verified reservations with my name and time for 4 people.

So at 0730 my friend and I walked up to hostess desk (the guys behind us) gave the 2 employees my full name and time and party of 4. One of the girls escorted us to the window seats. As I was walking I saw there were no empty tables by Windows but a round table for 5 close by Windows. I thought no problem I realize specific table requests sometimes don&#39;t pan out. The hostess stopped at a table next to window with 2 women already sitting there. I thought &#34;what ???&#34; 
The women at the table just looked up and ignored us. I said to the hostess we have 4 people and who are these women? I don&#39;t know these people and are we sitting on each other&#39;s lap!!
Remember we had 4 people in our party.
Back to the hostess desk. By now the 2 hostesses were very frazzled.  We asked did they tell you a last name, did you even ask their last name? Oh yes the hostess said.
The one hostess now said sorry but now there will be a 30 min wait.  That&#39;s when I almost lost it. Because there was the table for 5 open and I saw the bus boys cleaning other tables. I pointed this out to them and they gave us the table for 5 next to the 2 women.
I spoke to the 2 women and asked if they  gave the hostess her last name . One of the women said here name was JoAnn and no last name was give or asked.


The birthday girl ordered the prawns in cream sauce with a side of mashed potatoes. There was 4 cold prawns in a cream sauce and you can tell the mashed potatoes were instant. Her husband ordered fish and chips. The fish was good but fries were cold. He did mention this to waiter and the waiter did get him new fries.
My friend did complain to the manager . The manager said she was sorry and did take $40 off the bill. Also they placed the birthday cake in a to go bag . What happen to the candle at table???   I think they just wanted us to go away before something else went wrong. If I knew they were gonna shove it in a to go bag and charge us $9 I would of told them never mind.

So what happened? Did these women not have reservations and knowingly took ours ?  Would be easy since the hostess do not verify names. Or is this the hostess fault?  Again this would  be easy since they do not verify names.


Bottom line , I tried to make a nice birthday celebration for a friend but night turned into a fiasco.
All  she got was cold food, no cake at table  and I was disappointed
I have given this place a few chances thinking it would be better the next time but it is just an beautiful place that is overpriced for the food and overpriced for the service. If you do go just a sandwich. The entrees are not worth the money."

Not a good first impression.  Then the bartender proceeded to spend about 10 minutes selling us on the place saying we need to walk outside.  What we wanted was drinks and dinner!

Also, I&#39;d seen their billboard on I-55 south that advertised steaks, chops, salads, and sandwiches.

We went on a Saturday evening with no reservations.  The restaurant is actually a golf course restaurant at the Mistwood golf course in Crest Hill, where they recently renovated the club house and all the front buildings.  The restaurant was near full, but we sat at the bar.  We waited nearly 10 mins while the bartender was chatting with friends.  Then when she finally came over, found more friends that sat down at that moment.  We had to tell her we had been waiting.  We started off by ordering drinks.  The selection of beers wasn&#39;t bad, but not huge.  We were  immediately accosted by the bartender however, who was pushing McWethy&#39;s to the point of being annoying.  She was going on about the authentic Scottish architecture of the new restaurant.  We looked around.  All I saw was blank walls with windows overlooking the course.  She asked off at least 5 times in as many minutes to get up and tour the small restaurant, which you could easily see all of sitting where we were at.  She then tried to push a Sunday brunch on us for $50 a head!  We hadn&#39;t even looked in our menus yet to order dinner.

We decided to hide in our menus.  Looking at the food selection didn&#39;t give us the warm and fuzzies.  Yes, they had steaks, chops, and salads as advertised.  But the prices seemed quite inflated for such a place. 

Between the bland boxy room, the bartender nonstop pestering us to love the place, and the prices, we gulped our beers and left.

I won&#39;t be repeating McWethy&#39;s."

For his wife&#39;s sister and husbands thirty first you each should take note before you go to this restaurant. But as I right this its Romeoville. So what should one really expect. 

Let&#39;s see the frustration and disappointment of this annoying vets art dinner has already dominated 45 minutes of another day pointing out service that TGIF is better than. Really a benchmark?

Poor service. Power manager accountability for poor experience. No waters brought to the table after three requests. Undercooked food. Poor service. Misleading menu items and Ed Debevic like service. You know?

Duck was the menu choice for one and out came a portly cooked duck salad. The logo should say Romeoville inspired Scottish logo. 

Dirty Martini looked like motor oil and tasted like it. 

I&#39;m tired of hearing the complaints. You won&#39;t last more than 6 months in this location.

Our hostess was very friendly but that&#39;s about all the service we would have. The room is very nicely decorated with nice views of the golf course. After sitting for approximately 10-15 minutes with no acknowledgement from any server we left. I guess cleaning tables is more important than assisting the customers. Won&#39;t be back and definitely will not recommend to others due to the horrible service. The hostess asked us how our visit was as we were leaving.

Everything tasted great  and the portions were large enough to bring home some leftovers. I  would have rated this 5 stars but the service was slower than I would have liked.

I had the patty melt but sent it back because it had some sorta icky tasting sauce on it. Make sure you read the menu thorougly there are some items on sandwiches/plates that are unique to their restaurnt. They gratefully remade it without that and it tasted great! 
Husband had the steak sandwich said it was good! 
The black pepper fries are awesome !
Nice place in an area with very mundane restaurants.
The decor though needs an update..how about some swords? Shields? There is NOTHING on the walls at all and we kept hearing a sort of grinding thumping under our table where we sat. Not sure what that was.
But none of these things would keep us away and we are happy to return with friends a second time.

I really really wanted to like it as soon as we walked in. The decor was very cute and they have quite a few interesting and different menu items. However, those menu items were just poorly executed the night we were there. The French onion soup was literally all bread and very little soup. That&#39;s because there was so much bread that all the soup had been soaked up by it, leaving a bowl of cheese covered brown mush. Yuck! I asked the waitress to take it back and bring me another, but a moment later we were delivered our meals. So I cancelled the soup. I really dislike places that have poor timing when it comes to bringing out the separate courses. If I had kept the soup I wouldn&#39;t have had time to eat it before my dinner would have been in front of me. For my dinner I had the steak sandwich which was mostly fat. Bite after bite I was eating chunks of fat not meat. I finally took the steak off of the bread to cut it into pieces to try and savage some of the meal since the sandwich thing was not working. Also the fries were cold and flavorless. My boyfriend did like his fish, but also thought the fries were bad. I&#39;m puzzled by all the great reviews on here. Maybe we went on a night when they were breaking in a new cook or something. I have no intentions on going back anytime soon."

Atmosphere and amenities are beautiful but the food (from what we had) was subpar.  My wife had the onion soup which she said was tasty but was warm at best.   The fish and chips that I had was some of the worst I&#39;ve ever had.  Tasted like mush with no flavor in the fish or tartar sauce.  I sent it back and ordered wings as a replacement and they were ok.  But $10 for 7 small wings is a bit outrageous (especially when they list them as jumbo wings). 
We will go back again I&#39;m sure.....but for drinks only and that&#39;s unfortunate with such a nice facility."

I found the shepherds pie to be good but bland but I think that&#39;s just how it&#39;s supposed to be. The fried fish was good. While the fish portion size was huge and the fish itself was light and flakey, the breading was too thick. Coconut shrimp was delicious. Best dipping sauces anywhere like the aoli is fantastic.

You don&#39;t eat hashbrowns with turkey and prime rib! Where was the soup? The salad bar was disappointing. The had oysters which is all well and good but they were just left out. Those babies need to be sitting on a bed of ice. That&#39;s a good way to make people sick. For $30 dollars a person I expected more. The place is very nice and the chocolate fudge cake was really good but who wants to pay $30 bucks for cake. The waitstaff was just hanging out by the door and in the way most of the time bc they had nothing to do it was kind of annoying. I&#39;ll stick with al&#39;s for sunday brunch.

Since this was our first time at McWethy&#39;s,  we wanted the whole culinary experience from appetizer to dessert.  We started with a sausage, carmelized onion and arugula flatbread.  The crust was crispy abd the perfect bed for the sauce, onions and crisped sausage.  My friend had the French onion soup.  After wrestling with all of the gooey cheese and the croutons, I soon regretted not having a bowl myself.  We were pretty full by the time our entrees arrived, but I still managed to eat half of my lamb burger.  My burger was perfectly seasoned and topped with feta cheese,  carmelized onions and arugula all on an Asiago cheese bun.  My meal came with a side of pepper seasoned fries.  Try the fries. Seriously, try them.  They are so good.  I also saw truffle fries on the menu.  That&#39;s on my list for next time.  My friend&#39;s fish and chip platter was filled with two of the biggest cod fillets I&#39;ve ever seen and, of course, those pepper fries were there supporting the overly generous portion of fish.  The fish was lightly battered and fried to golden, crisp perfection.  It was juicy without being greasy and flaky.  All this was followed up with a pretty crusted brownie topped with a mound of vanilla ice cream with candied pecans on top.  This is definitely the place to go for gre as t food and great views from the patio."

Then, one of us ordered a very expensive hamburger ($12.00, only including chips).  This was delivered cold.  We ordered the asparagus with salmon, thinking this sounded interesting.  What came was a $7.00 dish of asparagus, with a chunk of salmon tossed on top that was so dry it could not be eaten.  One of us ordered a vodka and tonic.  This came without a stirrer or lime.  I ordered wine, which had already been on the shelf too long.  I went to talk to the manager, who did not apologize.  He just said that this is what happens when they are busy.

It&#39;s always a cold, dry, rude, rushed experience as was today! She&#39;s overpriced and the food isn&#39;t the best, just a convenient location. I&#39;ll never return, my money deserves to be earned with good customer service as well. I urge others to stay away also, if you do stop by pay attention to the things I&#39;ve pointed out and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree. I&#39;m usually happy when I eat but not today, I&#39;m very disappointed today. I feel robbed and not only of money but respect as well."

This place is homey. You walk in and it feels and smells familiar, comforting. The servers are warm and the service has been fantastic. The food is your standard diner food, you can get pancakes/french toast instead of toast as part of the standard eggs. But you come in knowing it&#39;s a diner, so the food is perfect.

Matty&#39;s is a locally owned independent diner.  The service, food, atmosphere and price is all reflected in this fact.  The staff are personable and all unique.  They speak to you like you are a guest in their home and always make you feel like they know you.  Being new to the area I have only visited a few times, however; I noticed they knew some patrons by name. The overall service was prompt, my coffee cup was never empty, and alterations to items on the menu were no issue. The restaurant itself was bright, clean, and welcoming. The smell of bacon grease and black coffee lingered; as it should. The eggs, pancakes, french toast, fruit, salted meats, hot cereal, and sandwiches have all been delicious. The summer berry french toast with cream cheese frosting was exceptional.  The cost varied depending on what was ordered but ranged from $5-10 dollars per person.  I have not yet been disappointed and am looking forward to my next visit."

They can call it a family restaurant but it&#39;s definitely a diner.  Service was quick and friendly with no fuss.  The food was very good and I really enjoyed my stuffed french toast with bananas, berries, caramel, pecans, and sweet cheese.

Avocados

and only one Lamb shank 

&#34;would we like to order anything else?&#34; she asked of course because we were starving so after thirty minutes wasted on ordering the Broasted chicken made me feel like I gained 20 pounds from all the grease and the spaghetti was made from prego...The one and only lamb shank was alright, but the best thing out of all of it was:

We all agree that the food has stepped up in recent years, though the price is still reasonable in a nice setting. 

We went last night for my dad&#39;s birthday and all ended up ordering the same dish: the tequila lime shrimp brochettes. Two skewers of sizable shrimp threaded among peppers and tomatoes and kissed with a smoky flavor from the grill. Very tasty! Hope you like the red pepper rice because it&#39;s a side dish with about half the menu items (it is quite tasty and buttery). I also got a mini wedge salad, but had to ask for an extra side of dressing because it was rather scantily sauced to start. 

For dessert we had the creme brulee and the caramel basket with white chocolate mousse and berries, both dishes we have had in the past. It was a rainy night which may have accounted for the basket not being as crispy as usual; the humidity may have made it gummy. The mousse was still tasty, though, and the creme brulee&#39;s surface was crackling, hiding a delicate cream. 

The meal was marred by pesky details. The knife I was given (just a butter knife) was so dull that it wouldn&#39;t cut the lettuce of my salad, so I had to swipe the one that came with the excellent pretzel bread. Again, the skimpy dressing problem (which we had to address to the girl refilling water because our waitress wasn&#39;t around). Also, the restaurant is lovely, but it is always cold because of the vents right under the tables by the windows (be sure to bring a sweater no matter the season!), and also there are areas where they definitely need some more lighting, which was particularly obvious on a gloomy night. 

Despite these things, I know we will be back because of my parents&#39; love for this place. It&#39;s nice to see that the food is getting better and better; hopefully the little things will  step up too."

The drink menu is what is expected at a fine dining restaurant in Lockport.  They had a great martini list but I stuck with my plain Ketel One and blue cheese olives and at 9.25, not bad as they gave me plenty to enjoy.   So off to a good start. 

The pretzel bread was very good and kept us happy until the entrees.  The Halibut was the recommended special and I went for it.  It came with Spaghetti Squash and fingerling potatoes and for the most part it was delicious.  The fish was cooked perfectly which was most important.  My only criticism was the lack of sauce (it was one of those fancy droplets on a plate type of offering that was prettier to look at than it was to eat).  It was some type of apple sweet sauce that would have been better if they had substituted something more juicy and less on the sweet side.  But overall, I did easily eat the whole thing.  

Another had the pork chop with Blueberry reduction sauce and it really was a whole bunch of blueberries like what you get on a pie.  I tasted this and believe it or not, it worked.  So kudos to them for finding a great unique combo that most people wouldn&#39;t think of to put together. 

The dessert was awesome.  We saw them bringing out a few different ones from sundaes to lemon merengue pies and they looked fresh and homemade so we opted for the Chocolate Mousse and yum.. We all ended the night with a smile.  

Definitely would stop here again if I&#39;m out this way."

Both my husband and I agreed that the food was nothing special and pretty bland.  What you&#39;re paying for is the atmosphere.  We were also disappointed because we wanted breakfast, and they don&#39;t serve breakfast.

Our party ordered a strip steak, a filet mignon, and crab cakes. Both steaks were thin, dry, and flavorless. Not a drop of moisture in either one or on the plate - like they squeezed them dry before serving. The peppercorn crust was forgotten on one steak. The mushrooms were dry and rubbery, just like the steaks, as if they&#39;d been left under a heat lamp all day to shrivel up. I cannot stress enough, how dry our plates of food were.The crab cakes were mushy and bland. The sweet potato mash and the garlic mash both were forgettable, and tasted like they could have come from a packet. For $35 plates, this is a cruel joke. 
We also had a big issue with very loud knocking on the floor above the restaurant. Very loud and distracting. For this price point, your food and ambiance should both be quality. Too bad, as its a nice looking space.

Half of my daughter&#39;s &#34;medium&#34; steak was medium, the rest was medium rare.  Both seaks had tough regions: one bite tender, next bite tough.  The other foods (burger, beef stroganoff) were pretty good.  They have a decent variety of craft beer.  Prices are higher than average for the south suburbs.

For one, I was there with the bride during rehearsals. It didn&#39;t seemed that planned out at all. It almost looked like they were just winging the outdoor wedding. They had a planner there but there wasn&#39;t any real direction. Made everyone confused a little bit.

The actual reception was beautiful. You will need speakers to hear anything. It is by a train station.

The food was delicious. Definitely a plus plus plus. 

The reception area is small. If you want a decent sized dance floor you should probably only invite 150 max. You also need to be aware of the amount of guests that show up. The wedding I went to had 5-10 people who weren&#39;t on the guest list and they were given seats and were told to pay for their plates (during their wedding reception, I might add). 

It&#39;s a cute little spot. Worth trying it out for dinner."

We picked Public Landing for our wedding because there were no hidden fees involved, the price included your food, bar, taxes, and gratuities.  The planner was nice and friendly, but it was like pulling teeth to get her to meet with us, I literally did my entire wedding via email---which I felt was incredibly impersonal and almost rude. I&#39;m paying you thousands of dollars and nobody had &#34;time&#34; to meet with me/us-not right. 

The cake situation was a whole other issue-I have already yelped on them, RUDEST PEOPLE ON EARTH! The Landing&#39;s deal with Orland Park Bakery is a JOKE..  The landing fixed the situation by adding what I wanted themselves, but the entire process--HASSLE! 

The day of was great, SHE was great, however, I felt rushed when my husband and I were taking pictures. I also heard from quite a few people that the bartenders/staff were VERY RUDE. I haven&#39;t even had the chance to call because an entire month later, I&#39;m still upset about this. 

Food was good though, way better than most wedding food I have had prior.  Drinks were good--a good amount of liquor. 

Just disappointed in the whole process to get to THE day.  I will call, just wanted to vent out here to warn people that you WILL plan your ENTIRE wedding with Little to NO HELP. Creates a very stressful situation!"

It&#39;s a warm Sunday afternoon and we take our dog and son with us to a nice lunch.  We start with the Appetizer Platter, any three regular appetizers for a set price of $28.95 dollars.  We get the Crab Cakes, two giant cakes with veggies, which my wife loved; the Shrimp Cocktail, six large shrimps and sauce, which my son loved; and finally the Won Ton Bomb, five smallish lightly deep fried and very delicious wontons, that I really loved.  All items were really good.  Individually we would have paid $10 dollars more, so it was a good deal for the combined platter.

For our main course items, we ordered our dog the Double Quarter Hounder for $8.00 dollars, which came with burger meat, carrots, squash and dog bones, and she wolfed it all down.  Then my wife got the Crab Stuffed Whitefish for $13.95 dollars, she loved it and I thought it was very good too.  My son got the Argentinian Flank Steak for $15.95 dollars, which he loved and I also thought was very well seasoned, nice and tender too.  And finally I ordered the Fish Tacos, for $11.95 dollars, just average and a strongly okay item and the Carne Tacos, for $12.95 dollars, three excellent tacos.  Now I wanted to order a mix of the two and was willing to pay for that too but was told the chef could not do that.  So I ended up ordering both and brought half home with me for another meal.  Again the steak out weighted the fish, but both were very good items.  Well to take home with us my wife ordered a Bread Pudding for $5.50 dollars, and she will let me know how that is.

So overall everything was truly very good.  The service excellent and the setting beautiful.  I will say the prices are very high so this is more of a special occasion type restaurant.  Our total bill came to roughly $107.00 dollars without tip.  So again we do highly recommend the Public Landing in Lockport, IL."

Baked French Onion soup had NO onions in it!  Food was served warm, not hot.  Really disappointing place for the price.

Started off with the house sangria.  It tasted watered down and bland.

French onion soup: Easily best thing of the night.  Borderlined on being over seasoned but after having had the entree course,  I&#39;ll take too much salt over no salt any day of the week.

Entree:  Crisp roast duck.  I don&#39;t even know where to start.  I&#39;m pretty sure this 1/2 duck was thrown in the deep fryer.  The skin was kind of crispy, but mostly just heavy with oil.  The breast on the inside was cooked through! Duck breast should be medium-rare, medium at most, and this was for sure well done.  The leg/thigh were so overdone it tasted like duck jerky.  No salt or seasoning found anywhere in the duck.  Served with mashed sweet potatoes that were lumpy, under seasoned and lacked the cream or butter sweet potatoes need to get that light, fluffy texture they can get when mashed properly.  Also came with green beans.  Cooked well, tossed in butter.  Could have used some salt.

Dessert: German chocolate cake.  How do you screw up German chocolate cake?!?  Cake part was dry.  Coconut frosting was bland.  A true GCC is layered and gooey.  This was flat and cold.  Cake shouldn&#39;t be cold.  And it was topped with whipped cream and chocolate sauce, as if they knew it wasn&#39;t good and were trying to hide it.  

Stars for service.  Server was polite &amp; attentive.

I remember back when this place used to be awesome.  I can still remember a meal there from 15 years ago that included the most succulent soft-shell crabs coated in almonds served in a lemon butter sauce that was divine.  This was THE place to get a killer meal in a great spot.  I&#39;m not sure whats changed but my last 3 or 4 meals here have been consistently sucky.  

TL;DR skip it- the whole place.  

Management:  if you&#39;re looking for a chef

This longstanding restaurant offers standard fine dining fare, nothing imaginative but solid cuisine at reasonable cost. They offer drink specials. Service is good. I came here because I was celebrating with my elderly parents with simple tastes and Public Landing suffices. 
I had the prime rib which was cooked to my request and was not too fatty as it sometimes can be. The baked potato was sizable. My father had pot roast which looked good. My wife selected from their (new?) small serving summer menu which is great for smaller appetites. 
After a couple of mediocre meals in the past, I had stopped frequenting PL. This experience was much better, so I think I&#39;ll start returning."

I have had dinner at Public Landing 2 times previously, and I recall it being wonderful.  Most recently, not so much.  The building and space is still beautiful, and what has been done outside surrounding the canal is gorgeous.  But the food was truly awful.

Crabcake appetizer-while they tasted ok, they unmistakeably had Surimi mixed in as filler.  Can&#39;t mistake that fake pink/red color.  Embarrassing.

I had some potato crusted walleye dish.  Totally flavorless.  NO seasoning.  Wild rice was old, crusty, and inedible.  Twice baked potato (which there is an up-charge for) was dry and miserable, too.  Seemed to me to be at least 2 days old, and heated under a broiler before serving.  I&#39;m told the Ribeye steak was good, but the mushrooms and Bernaise sauce looked sad.  Creamed Spinach was good, but too salty.  Cream of Broccoli soup was the best part of the meal.  Server was sick and continuously coughing into both her hands, which pretty much did me in, as she was touching all of our plates and drinks.  Good people watching, though.  There were some cute, classy old-folks there.

Will probably try again someday, but with lower expectations."

The hostess could not have been more pleasant and got us a table right away with no reservation! The service was outstanding as our drink orders came quickly and the server was very attentive. We shared a Prime Rib dinner and a Tilapia stuffed with Crab. Once again Public Landing amazed me with the flavor and presentation of the fine dinning establishment that they are.

That just about covers it, I think.  Oh wait, maybe you want a few more specifics.

I have come here for a birthday party once and for lunch numerous times.  I like the way you can create a full lunch with soup or salad plus entree and dessert.  Their soups change and are all good.  My favorite was the Turkey noodle I had last year after Thanksgiving although I recently had a really good chicken and wild rice.  I have eaten sandwiches, pot roast, meat loaf and finally tried their steak.  Every meal was good.  For dessert I wish they had more items with pumpkin but the ice cream is always good.

Lockport is a pretty cool river town with lots of history of the I &amp; M canal thrown in.  Come for lunch in the summer and sit outside on the patio.

I told her we would be dining in Lockport and her reaction was a mix of shock, disgust and pity. I assured her that Lockport is a fine little town and that I would never put her palate in danger.

Public Landing completely changed her opinion of non-city dining and resulted in my night being spectacular in more ways than just the fare that was served. We got there early and found space at the crowded bar. The wine and beer list is impressive with local seasonal beers for a real man like myself.

My special lady ordered the duck and I ordered the rack of lamb. Both were prepared to perfection though she mentioned the next time she would get the regular mashed potatoes as opposed to the sweet potato version. 

The ambiance was exactly what I hoped for. A fine dining experience that was not pretentious in anyway with prices fitting the high quality of food. Our server was attentive but allowed us to enjoy the evening.

There was a wedding going on in the upstairs space that evening and I was asked to give an impromptu toast to the new bride and groom. I did not know anything about them but accepted the task. This is the type of place Public Landing is. A place where new friends are made, wonderful food is consumed and a gentleman such as myself can surprise his special lady. God bless Lockport, Illinois."

The Gaylord Building in downtown Lockport also houses a museum and you enter the restaurant via that area.  This restaurant has changed owners a few times and thankfully, seems to have new owners that are worthy of the setting.

Want to do lunch with the ladies?  There are great salads.  Have the ladies given up on the BS of always ordering salads when out together?  Then you will enjoy the real food even more.  A friend and I met there on Thursday and each very much enjoyed the Shrimp and Andouille sausage Etouffee.  It was flavorful and spicy and said, oh yeah, let the good times roll.  It was preceded by a nice house salad and ended with a small piece of banana cake.  3 courses, around  15 bucks you really can&#39;t beat it.  

If the weather is pleasant, sit outside.  Their patio is beautiful and wonderfully shaded.  They do sometimes allow dogs on the patio so you might want to check that out if that appeals to you or turns you off.  

Take a trip to historic Lockport where they filmed parts of Public Enemies and have the meal Johnny Depp wish he could have enjoyed."

Very rustic yet modern looking next to a pond of some sort which would be very lovely for an outdoor wedding. However, upon my arrival and meeting with Melissa, she seemed very distant and uninterested in serving me once she met me in person. She barely shook mine and my wedding coordinators hand. She took us on an elevator ride to the upper level where the reception would be held and literally stood in one place while we looked around. She only spoke when we asked questions of her, and she did not see us out or tell us how to get back out of the restaurant or which floor to take the elevator to. I was saddened that this couldn&#39;t be my location due to her attitude and even more frustrated that I drove 45 minutes out of my way to view this location and was treated this way.

I have been here three separate times, and each time my experience has been worse than the last. As a person who has worked in the restaurant industry for years, I know that one bad experience does not make a bad restaurant, but three experiences that go from bad to worse is not a good sign. The food was consistently over cooked and under seasoned. The beef stroganoff was one of the worst things I have ever tasted in my life, and the sauce had a strange gelatinous texture that was absolutely repulsive. The service was just about as bad as the food. Our server was flat out rude and was acting as though we were bothering her when we asked about a few of the wines. She made me feel so uncomfortable I would have left before we ordered food if it wasn&#39;t for my fiancé who convinced me not to give up so fast. She continued to make obnoxious comments throughout our meal, and by the time we were done we refused boxes, paid the bill, and got out of there as quickly as possible.

This past Friday night I suggested this was where we should have dinner - what a mistake.  We were a party of 4 and all but myself ordered the Lenten special of fried cod and shrimp.  The plates of cod and shrimp arrived and looked good - however each person was very dissapointed, the breading on the cod was very greasy and the fish inside was mushie and not cooked evenly to the point of barely being edible.  The waiter never returned to see how we liked our food for a long time - when he finally surfaced we explained that we were very unhappy with the dishes and explained the problem.  What he told us was he could get us more but it would probably be the same, we gambled - he brought more - he was right it was just as bad.  
Next he brought us our check - we paid and left.  We were never offered a replacement item since we were unhappy with the food - no one asked on the way &#34;how was everything&#34;.

However, service seems a little...overbearing? I felt as if our server was either trying to rush us out or felt pressured to check on us every five minutes. If it wasn&#39;t the server bothering us, it was her helper/runner. Water was constantly refilled, even before my glass had been half emptied, we were probably asked how everything was 6-7 times during our meal. It was difficult to have any sort of meaningful conversation with my coworker when we were continuously interrupted. I&#39;ve noticed that with restaurants trying more and more to be &#34;on top of things&#34; with customer service, good old fashioned relaxed dining with a friend is going out the window. I can only imagine how unromantic it&#39;d have been if I were on a date! Restaurants, this one included, need to start carrying &#34;do not disturb&#34; signs for the tables!"

Beautiful in every season.  There is a lot of history and culture behind this building and they have done a wonderful job of maintaining it.  The staff is personable and in the summe they have a doggy dining which i think is awesome (outdoors of coarse)The food:  Fantastic.  Never ate a bad meal ever!  Always a wide selection.  I personally hate going to a restaraunt where i cant figure out what i want because the menu is all over the place, but this menu...everytime i look at it I think i want at least one of everything. lol.... 
 I had my wedding here in October, and they were just amazing.  Julie and her staff catered to our every need and everything was beyond what i could have ever hoped for.  Every few minutes Julie asked us if we needed anything..and honestly we didnt.  it was all perfect.  My friends and family enjoyed it..as well as myself and my new husband.  I will continue coming here and maybe will even use it for a baby shower in the near future"

It is a good restaurant in its class. The food is not bad, ambiance is very good, service is adequate and the price is on the expensive side for value delivered.

Both the lunch and dinner menus are online at the restaurant&#39;s website. The lunch menu is like prix fixe for many of the entreés from the dinner menu, and a separate prix fixe for sandwiches, except that the entreés and sandwiches do not come with any extra courses --- no appetizer, no dessert, although the meals come with soup or salad. In the summertime, there is yet another fixed price list of smaller sized, yet complete, lunch or dinner plates. 

Food quality: 
The meat and fish are prepared well, from good recipes, using decent quality meat and fish. My pork was on the tough side, but quite flavorful, well-trimmed and extra lean. I could not have come close to what Public Landing&#39;s kitchen produced. My companion&#39;s turkey was juicy, but somewhat salty to her taste. This might have been brining by the restaurant or the food processor. In any case, the turkey meat was juicy, with satisfying texture --- very good, in my opinion, although I agree that the saltiness was noticeable. 

The garlic mashed potatoes and the mashed sweet potatoes were excellent. Good job. Yes, these sides are simple and routine to prepare, but so many kitchens manage to mess them up. 

Particularly fine was the homemade cranberry relish. The kitchen held back on the sweetening agent (let&#39;s say it was sugar; they used the minimum amount of sugar in the recipe). Minced leeks or green onions were added to the relish. The combination was creative and effective. The reduced sugar plus the leeks/onions accentuated the relish&#39;s role as a savory enhancement to the pork and the turkey.

The salad was fresh, but mediocre. 

The bread served was stale. The vegetable of the day was a mixture of green beans, carrots and zuchinni, all steamed, and lightly buttered. The vegetables were uninteresting, almost bad, in that they were slightly overcooked. They tasted like frozen vegetables that had been thawed and lightly buttered. Fresh bread is not difficult to procure or serve. Neither should appropriate preparation of fresh vegetables be a technical challenge for this kitchen. These are simple, inexpensive fixes that Public Landing should make.

To summarize the food, the main course, cranberry relish and potatoes were very good. The bread and vegetables were both quite bad. Salad was mediocre. 

We each ordered a dessert, one &#34;turtle&#34; sundae, one bread pudding. I think that good ingredients were used but the recipes were, to my taste, not successful. Please give the desserts a try yourself, however. A lot of thought plus good ingredients went into the recipes, and people&#39;s taste in desserts varies widely.

Ambiance: Public Landing really is a landing along the I&amp;M. Its dining room has been rehabbed into brick walls with hardwood floors, solid wood tables and chairs, with white tablecloths and linen napkins. The windows look out over the courtyard patio, with its outdoor seating, then beyond towards the landing, the 9th Street bridge and the I&amp;M. The rehab is first class. The interior dining room and bar environment successfully provide an upscale dining environment. However, it is not formal, nor is it classy. The Public Landing is just &#34;really nice&#34;, but comfortably casual. It is a good place to meet for a business lunch, or for a last dinner to break up with a girlfriend. 

The courtyard patio looks like flagstone, spacious, with the equivalent seating of 12 widely spaced four-tops. It must be a magnificent place to eat outdoors. The courtyard furniture is all metal. Each table has an umbrella. The patio, like the dining room, would overlook the landing, the 9th Street bridge, and the I&amp;M.

Public Landing&#39;s ambiance is excellent, more than appropriate for the  informal upscale restaurant that it is.

Service: Adequate, but completely unremarkable.

Price: Public Landing is steep. Budget $35-$45 apiece for lunch, including drinks, dessert, tax and tip. Dinner, I am guessing, would be in the $55-$70 range. The level of food, ambiance and service value delivered for this price is definitely no great bargain, although it is within reason.

Other: The dining room is not tiny, but I would not arrive as a walk-in during dinner service. Make a reservation. As for parking, there is a very small lot on the East side of the train tracks. We were not there for dinner, so I can&#39;t say whether there is valet parking. If the lot is full, you will need valet parking, since the West side of State Street does not appear to have any street spots.

In conclusion, Public Landing does a good job of being an upscale, informal American restaurant. Its food is generally good, ambiance is spot on, service is adequate, price is on the high side."

Admittedly I arrived with a smug west coast attitude and my expectations weren&#39;t high in light of the other local options.  It provided to be a lovely dining experience.  I enjoyed an excellent ahi starter, with accompanying spicy stringed beans and slaw, both of which were very nice.  My entrée of duck was excellent and the server was happy to substitute wild rice, which was excellent, in lieu of potatoes.  The wine was fine; my colleagues seemed to enjoy their cocktails."

Ambiance is great, food (for the price) was average. My girlfriend and I wanted to try some place we had never been , and ended up on Public Landing. 

The menu is relatively large, with various options for seafood, pasta, and steaks. We started off with the Spring Rolls which, according to previous review, were supposed to be good. One word: awful. It is a giant, fried, roll cut into two pieces that consists of chicken and some kind of other cabbage. It had zero taste, even with the rasberry and mustard sauces it is accompanied by. 

After the dissappointment with our appetizer, I was not expecting much for the rest of our meal. I am glad to say that they redeemed themselves. Each entree comes with the choice of 2 sides. I ordered the Rib-Eye that was tasteful, and very juicy. Not the best piece of meat I have ever had, definitely not the worst. Garlic mashed potatoes were very, very good and the wild rice was just blah. My girlfriend ordered the garbage salad which is something I would recommend. 

What sold us were the encrusted asparagus sticks, with ranch on the side. We ordered these as another side to split and would highlighy recommend them (on appetizer list). 

Overall the drinks hit the spot and the food was mediocre. We decided we would like to go back over the summer, sit outside on their patio, drink, and enjoy the asparagus sticks."

Even in the cold weather months, the inside looked cozy with the brick and wood. 

They have great drinks; we loved our &#34;Planters Punch&#34; (and it only set us back $4/glass). We enjoyed our food, too. I ordered the sautéed tilapia w/ mashed sweet potato. Both were flavorful and had a perfect consistency. 

If ever in the area again, we&#39;d be sure to return, for dinner and drinks."

I had made a reservation and it was a special occasion we were celebrating. Upon arrival, we were shown to the worst, most high-traffic, wedged-in table in the restaurant. After asking for a table change, we had to wait 30 minutes at the bar where drinks were very expensive. No one apologized or was even nice about this process. I got the impression that this place clearly caters to their regulars, and everyone else is unimportant.

Once our table was ready, our actual server was delightful and patient, but our fish entrees (the &#34;catch of the day!&#34;) came out burned. When the manager came over, he was curt and not the least bit empathetic. Both of us returned the fish but I did not want my entree replaced with another poorly cooked option. Nothing else was offered to me to make up for their mistake: no complimentary dessert or drink, and no credit on the bill. 

I paid $70 for 1 entree and a couple of starches. I went home hungry. The place was noisy and does not care about its guests. I will never go back. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else."

Sat at the bar to avoid the lonliness of the dining room. Beautiful, historic building. Small bar. Bartender was kind and efficient. Jamesons tasted watered down. Vodka and soda was strong and cold. Ordered fried asparagus and calamari. Asparagus breading was much too thick and uninspired. Calamari rings were small, flavorless. Remoulade sauce had a nice zing. I had crab cakes. Portions were large. Corn relish was weak and plain. Sweet potatoes were sweet. My friend had the maple clazed pork chops. The meat was of high quality and moist. The glazing was thin and flavorless.

The service was excellent from the seating to the dessert with every person that walked by willing to remove a dish or get something for us. Our server was also very knowledgeable and made very timely visits to check on us. The food came out hot and cooked perfectly. The only reason I did not give an excellent total rating was the fact that I was disappointed in the fish dish I chose. It was not quite to my liking (seemed mushy) even though it was replaced with another of the same dish by the chef. They did all they could to make me happy and the flavors were great, just not the texture by my judgment. The building also has a lot of history and was nicely furnished with a view of the park and canal. For a very nice dining experience, try it."

But we had a gift card that we wanted to use up and so we gave it a shot.

What a pleasant surprise!  It is a restaurant that is in a historical building and the decor is really nice.  We had an earlier dinner on a Saturday night (6:30 pm) and we were glad we came in early and this place is obviously very, very popular and very busy.  

The nice thing about eating earlier is you can enjoy a peaceful walk around the area (next to a historic settlement on the I&amp;M canal), and it was can be a great start to your evening.

We highly recommend the Spring Roll appetizer---very good and a large appetizer.  Perfect for two to share.

The chicken tortilla soup is good, albeit somewhat reminiscent of vegetable soup.  But it was a solid soup. 

I highly recommend the New York Strip as well as the Prime Rib---but make sure you order Au Jus for the Prime Rib as it comes with horseradish sauce.  It made all the difference in the world, and it was terrific, and very large.

We also highly recommend the grilled asparagus with red onions and blue cheese.  Outstanding.

For dessert, you must try the bread pudding.  It was unbelieveable.

Service runs hot and cold.  Waitress warmed up throughout the night, but getting the check was rough (they were also mobbed at this time in her defense) and getting water glass refills was a small challenge overall but not a horrible experience by any means).

Would definitely go back.  A great place to go for an earlier Saturday dinner or on Sunday.  Lots of families and gray hairs present.

Also, they offer a 50% off coupon in several publications from what I have heard, and this might make it even more irrestible."

Wait, let me blow my nose first. Alright, ready. Let&#39;s do this.

This was my second time eating at Public Landing. The first was many years ago with my family--so long ago that I didn&#39;t remember anything about the food or the service, but I did remember the building and the interior. That&#39;s very telling...

We ended up at Public Landing again yesterday for my birthday dinner with my parents. Upon parking and walking over the train tracks towards the restaurant, I instantly remembered the place. The building is beautiful inside and out. It houses some sort of museum as well, but I really have no idea what it&#39;s about. The restaurant occupies two floors on half of the building, however you can only dine on the first floor as far as I can tell. There is a very large bar in the center of the restaurant that, in my opinion, is really unnecessary considering the small size of the place. Either way, we had made reservations for 7:15 and were seated by 7:30. Not too bad. Someone who walked in much later than us was seated immediately, though. My  dad commented that it seemed like the hostess knew them. I noticed in a previous review that someone complained about this place &#34;taking care of its regulars&#34;. It seems like that has some validity.

We were seated at a fairly large table in the back of the place. The service was more than adequate. We orders calamari as an appetizer as well as some starter soups and salads. The calamari was pretty routine, and I really enjoyed my bowl of cream of chicken soup. The complementary bread was also very fresh and warm. All seemed great so far. For entrees, I orders the spinach and prosciutto stuffed chicken with ziti pasta in pesto sauce. My parents ordered the pork schnitzel and ribs. I enjoyed my meal. The pasta was good. The chicken was alright--a bit dry (even drier when I reheated it just now). My mom&#39;s pork was pretty good. Nothing amazing. My dad&#39;s ribs weren&#39;t great however. I didn&#39;t try them, but he kept talking about how fatty they were. On the drive home he said, &#34;those ribs sucked.&#34; Not very eloquent, I know, but it summed up his feelings about the place pretty well.

I&#39;m not as critical of the Public Landing as my father. The atmosphere is great and the food was mediocre. The real problem is the price. None of our meals was worth the $20+ we paid for them. I most likely won&#39;t be back, but hey, if the place gets a little cheaper, someone give me a call. Maybe I&#39;ll give it another go."

I think their scheding was done wrong....The people before us were offered a table in the entrance way...it was very tightly sqeezed in for extra tables and for extra money on such a busy night. It was a cold area to sit right by the door. We also were offered this table....we were all getting over colds and didn&#39;t want to sit there. So we were told to wait at the bar...which was fine...the host (manager) said about 15 minutes. We watched as they sat other people at tables for 4 after we came in...they sat 2 groups.

The food was okay...the prices very inflated...the service is always the best...you can&#39;t fault the wait staff...just the management..We spent $160 for 4 people...not including drinks....so I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll patronize again.

Service was slow but friendly. The patio area is beautiful though bordered on either side by train tracks; the intermittent train horns interrupt conversation. We ate outside, but the interior was nice too. The Bohemian special (three kinds of sausage) was okay, as was the salad. However, the bread pudding and caramel basket desserts were excellent. Prices are good."

the space is immaculate.  the service - host and server - were very good.  very hospitable atmosphere.  the food was delicious and plentiful.  i had the giant three cheese raviolis with alfredo and marinara sauce.  entrees are served with bread, soup or salad (you have to have the italian vinaigrette - absolutely delicious) and a mixed vegetable side.  everything was fresh and really very good.  the average entree price is about $20, but you can&#39;t really knock the place for that just because it may be out of your routine budget (if it is).  music was a little weird. 

the fact that this place is at the I&amp;M canal is pretty cool!!!! i think the exhibit we saw was part of the lincoln bicentennial, but still cool nonetheless.  would def recommend it."

I was going to dinner with a friend on a Sunday night and realized the place in downtown Lisle was closed, so we headed over here.  There was NO wait on a Sunday night so I was pleased with that, I also dug how neat it was in here...I&#39;ve been to the other Oakbrook/Lombard location and NOT impressed, so I was also a bit hesitant to come here, but...I did want Mexican food.
One star for having a SPICY MARGARITA on the menu!!! Those are pretty big in places OTHER than Illinois but I was pleasantly surprised!
Another star for great chips &amp; salsa and our waiter brought us an extra basket of chips
A Third star for great chicken flautas!  I must have ordered other food from the other location, and not flautas because these were great!
and a fourth star for that chocolate pinata which my friend and I plan on going back for...and it will probably be my meal.  We saw another table order it and it looks pretty amazing so I WILL be back!!!  Great place, service &amp; food!!!"

RIP Zapatista. Then came Fogo de Chao, Granite City, and Uncle Julio&#39;s! This Uncle Julio&#39;s is super convenient as the closest one to us prior to this was all the way in Lombard. 

It&#39;s the same fare as any other one in the chain, and that&#39;s fine by me. Quality food, relatively decent prices, enormous portions, delicious drinks, a cute interior, and an overall delightful dining experience. This location does a fresh margarita of the day that is seasonally based and the last time I was there was for raspberry - ahhhhmazing. Fresh, ripe muddled raspberries floating amongst lime, tequila, and sour?! Hell yes. 

Also, please take my word for it, get the incredibly fun, jaw dropping, chocolate piñata for dessert. Yes, it&#39;s expensive and yes, it&#39;s ridiculous. The whole restaurant will stare at you and you can barely fit it on a table. DOESNT MATTER. Just do it. Bashing a giant chocolate balloon filled with fruit and churros wide open with a wooden mallet?! PRICELESS.

In short, Uncle Julio&#39;s is a fun and welcome addition to the neighborhood. The food is predictable, but you don&#39;t go here for adventure. You go to indulge in fajitas and queso dip and sugary drinks and fun. So go!"

I called to set up the reservation about 3 weeks out because I had heard multiple times that they&#39;re crazy busy so I didn&#39;t want to miss my opportunity to eat here! I first spoke with Brittany and made the reservation with my special request to have them modify their Chocolate Pinata dessert for us. (We were announcing a baby gender reveal at dinner.) She immediately understood what I was asking for and made special notes for it in the reservation log. I called on Saturday morning and spoke to Veronica to confirm all was a go for tonight and to keep it low key so our guests would be able to be surprised with the pinata reveal. I was told Mallory was managing that night and to ask for her upon arrival to have it set up.

Kristen served our large group (did separate checks without hesitation) and was easily able to help get the pinata ready and bring it out BEFORE dinner arrived so we could do the reveal and then eat dinner and the dessert (fruit &amp; churros) later. Flawlessly executed. Our group loved it, my husband and I loved it. It was the most fun we had doing/seeing a gender reveal.

I seriously, like I stated in the beginning, cannot say enough great things about the staff and their ability to take care of this special request and make us feel special too! The decorated the platter that the pinata arrives on with &#34;And it&#39;s a...&#34; (so cute and SO thoughtful.)

The food is amazing, all made from scratch. The chips and salsa in the beginning are endless and I always make the mistake of eating too much of those first. And the chocolate that makes up the pinata is to die for (as well as those mini churros!!)

Make a reservation and go to Uncle Julio&#39;s. You won&#39;t be disappointed. (Or host a baby gender reveal dinner here with your friends/family... you just have to order the Chocolate Pinata first!!) Thanks Uncle Julios.. we&#39;ll be back. Already craving the queso.."

The salsa is also delicious, we must&#39;ve went through 3 rounds of chips and salsa.  The margaritas were AMAZING!  They were freshly made and the pineapple margarita was outstanding!!!  Our meals tasted great and very little was leftover.  

We had a great server who was very friendly and fun!  There were 3 people in our party who had birthdays and our server went out of his way to get a little treat for them.  We made last minute reservations for 18 and they accommodated us rather quickly.

Met a friend for dinner on a Thursday night.  Place sat us right away.  Our server was irritated we ordered table-side guac.  Drinks were taking forever.  Food took forever.  I asked about dessert menu and server literally talked me out of it.  Issue with putting a coupon on the bill-literally thought the server was gonna throw a hissy fit.  Place was not busy and server was horrible.  I&#39;ve gone to the Lombard location many times and have never had an experience like this.  I sent them a message via FB raising awareness that it was a bad experience.  The reply was this:  

thank you for letting us know. Can you please send this to info@unclejulios.com. I will also reach out to the manager about your service experience.

I&#39;ve never had someone direct me to another place to file a complaint like this.  Seeing it&#39;s the hospitality industry you would think they would have had a better response and not direct me to another place to inform them what horrible service we had.  So now I&#39;m just going to inform yelp that there are many other restaurants in that Naperville location-take your money elsewhere."

The first thing I noticed about this location was its sheer size and the high quality of the interior and overall design. It took awhile to get seated even though it wasn&#39;t very busy. The hostess didn&#39;t give off a very warm or welcoming vibe. We started off with the grapefruit margarita special and guacamole. We were really looking forward to the guac as they made it fresh table side here but it never came out. I told the server and he was super prompt in letting his manager know. The manager came over to apologize right away and offered us something else instead. Props to them for turning a potential negative situation into something positive. I&#39;m okay with folks making mistakes as long as they own up to it and try to do better next time.

For our main course my wife ordered chicken and steak fajitas and I had the combo enchiladas. The portions were good and the food was cooked well.

This is a good spot to fill your Mexican cravings especially if you are looking for a nicer trendy type environment. Definitely good for large groups as well. Based on my experience I would definitely come back!"

Sergio was too busy talking with his friends on the other side of the bar and couldn&#39;t even bother to take our credit card.

The wait was 1 1/2 hours for a table so we decided to eat at the bar.  We ordered the made to order guacamole and it was fantastic!  It is a very generous order.  It should feed 4 people for an appetizer very easily.  We split the honey chipolte salmon.  This was also excellent.  The salmon was very flavorful and it was served with rice and a pineapple salsa.  The rice was a bit bland but the pineapple salsa paired well with the salmon.  We also had the  El Jefe margarita after dinner.  It was super potent and really tasty.

We ordered an appetizer before we placed our order, we got ceviche. I probably didnt have more than 3 or 4 scoops and the ceviche was gone......There were only 3 of us. This is not your typical Authentic Mexican restaurant ceviche were they serve you almost a meal portion (like El Barco and Lobo del Mar in Chicago or even Los Fernandez in Hoffman Estates)

We all ordered alcoholic beverages. I had a strawberry margarita, my mom had mango and my dad had beer, Miller Lite. No complaints there, our drinks were good, made in house with a decent serving size.

Then came our Fajita Grill Mix...We ordered this for the 3 of us, like we typically do. We asked our server if it was big enough for 3, he said yes.........BAHAHAHA we get our meal and the platter had 3 shrimp, 3 SLICES of chicken, and 3 SLICES of carne asada. We only got 2 tacos each (the torilltas were homemade, yum!). This is not your typical fajita grill platter. Typically you have so much food that the 3 of us even have left overs. Ive never been able to actually count the pieces of meat on our plates. This was a sad New Years meal, with a deep Naperville price on it.

 After the meal my mom joked shes sure Uncle Julio is my uncle on my dads side because Uncle Julio is stingy and no family member on her side would ever serve a meal like that...Cheers to 2016!"

Having read all of the lackluster reviews, I went to Uncle Julio&#39;s just waiting for glaring mistakes and bad food. 

We were a party of six and yet were seated almost immediately.  Service was friendly and timely. 

They brought out very light, non-greasy chips with a nice smoky salsa. I liked them so much, I could have just eaten those and gone home. They were quite delicate though. Enough that a woman with stitches in her gums could eat them. If you order guac, you&#39;d definitely have to spoon it onto your chips. They wouldn&#39;t hold up to dipping them.

We ordered 4 tamales as an appetizer and with the smoky salsa added, they were some of the better ones I&#39;ve had in Naper. Very good, but not as good as my friend, Arturo&#39;s. ;) 

While I would typically never order enchiladas (especially chicken enchiladas), the stitches in my mouth dictated soft food. I ordered them with salsa verde and sang praises that I was eating good food that wasn&#39;t soup. They were seasoned well and surprisingly, the chicken wasn&#39;t dry. The salsa verde was the best choice for me because I hate food drowning in sauce. For enchiladas, they were not overly heavy on the cheese. I would order these again even if I didn&#39;t have stitches in my mouth.

A few in our party ordered menu items with skirt steak. They all praised it as being well seasoned and very tender. I couldn&#39;t sample it with condition of my mouth, but I did try part of a flour tortilla. Those and the side of tasteless beans we were all served, are the only part of the experience that were misses. Neither terrible, but not fantastic either. I am a tough critic on tortillas. I lived in TX and was taught how to make them by non-English speaking Mexican women. And those tortillas are not &#34;from scratch&#34; as they say. If they were, they were &#34;from scratch&#34; elsewhere and heated up here. 

But if tortillas that don&#39;t stand up to my own and a side of boring beans are the only faults I could find, I know I&#39;ll be back to try more. Especially because Naperville is severely lacking in Mexican restaurants. Yes, it&#39;s a chain and I almost always, always avoid, but I can&#39;t deny that I liked my food here.

I suppose it&#39;s important to note that not only had I just had oral surgery, but I&#39;d only eaten soup for my last 10 meals. I&#39;m forcing myself to give it no more than a 4 star, knowing my near religious experience here was at least partially due to my starvation and my recent disdain and boredom with soup!"

We arrived and had a super friendly, attentive server who told us all about their scratch-made food and fresh fruit margaritas. The waiter tried pushing a grapefruit margarita, which I was skeptical about - but after trying it, I was so glad that I did. 

I tried the carne asada which was fantastic. The guacamole was fantastic. Everything looked and tasted great. My only negative as far as food goes is that they don&#39;t have a very comprehensive dessert menu. I&#39;d love to have a flan or something at the end of my meal. 

This place is a little pricey, but the food really is great and so is the service. Another plus is that if you sit at one of the booths they have phone chargers in the wall. I can&#39;t wait to come back to this place for some more of those margaritas!"

We were seated right away, and our server was very attentive. She really helped us with details of the food. She even brought me some extra spicy salsa to go with the warm chips. Be careful and don&#39;t mix up the salsas. They look the same, but one is spicier. the spicy had a nice kick.

For dinner I had the Juanita&#39;s Platter with a beef enchilada, a chicken enchilada, a beef taco and a pork tamale. I liked all of them, except the tamale. I think mine had one small strip (and I mean small) of pork. The one small piece of pork was quite tasty. It just needed more meat. The creamy hatch chili sauce on the chicken enchilada didn&#39;t have much flavor. My wife&#39;s salsa blanca on her chicken enchilada was much better."

This place is a nightmare!!! So much unfriendliness, from the hostess to the bartender. When we pulled up to the bar, not only were we not greeted, the bartender actually tossed us a menu and walked away...I&#39;m not exaggerating, she tossed it (my wife and I looked at each other like WTH is her problem!!!). Little did I know the circus was just beginning, this story does not get any better. They were very short on servers, the guy who served us was run ragged, and apologized for any shortcomings...he&#39;s the one bright spot in this hole called Uncle Julio&#39;s. We had a party of 6, I counted 3 open tables for 6, but due to less staff, our wait was just over an hour! If you add the time to get our food, it was over 1.5 hours from door to eating. The prices are crazy, ridiculously high for Texmex, I&#39;m only here because it&#39;s for someone else birthday dinner. Our tableware was not only dirty, it clearly had food left on it (I posted a pic). No way on earth I return here even if I&#39;m not paying. I personally will steer clear of this restaurant, if every other place is closed, I will eat peanut butter and jelly at home. I cannot state strongly enough just how bad this place is in every aspect, they have no doubt earned every bad review they have received....be warned. I&#39;m putting money on the table that they will close, any takers?"

Decor: typical restaurant, dimmed lighting. We sat at the bar, 3 tvs at your view, all different channels. Bar stools were comfortable. 

Service: we weren&#39;t immediately greeted but someone did walk over after a minute to try to find us a table. Because of the busy lunch time, we had to wait for a table so we sat at the bar. Bar server was Jose, which was great! Always asked how was the food and if we needed anything. He even had small talk with us for a bit! Said bye to every single guest who left, just a really good bartender/server. 

Food: I order fish tacos off the lunch menu. Mind you, it said corn shells but I absolutely HATE corn shells. And I forgot to tell Jose that I wanted flour shells, didn&#39;t realize it until the food came. I didn&#39;t wanna be that girl and change my order then so I kept it. 

THE FISH WAS SO PERFECTLY SEASON AND GRILLED, the taco was stuff with the most perfect toppings...I didn&#39;t even realize it was corn shell. That&#39;s how good they were. 

Beans that they give were great as well, perfect seasoning. The guacamole was a 10! 

Price: each meal on the lunch menu was about 10.99, I didn&#39;t pay and got a water but I&#39;m sure we didn&#39;t pay more than $30.

Service was desultory and slow. When our food arrived, it was cold. The server did not return to check on us so I did not have an opportunity to let her know our dissatisfaction.  In fact no one asked us how things were the entire night. 

The setting sun glared in our eyes for the whole meal. Shades were down but ineffective. We did ask the server if anything could be done. She said &#34;no, sorry&#34;. That was inexcusable. I noticed several additional tables where people were awkwardly shading their eyes.  It made for a very unpleasant meal. The wall of windows was huge so the glare stayed 
with us throughout the whole meal. 

We will not return (party of 4)"

I ended up picking out the small amount of good stuff they had and left the rest on the plate. 

Pretty busy lunch hour and its a newly opened restaurant so the wait didn&#39;t bother me much, the food SOUNDED (read) like it would be delicious-they boast on it all being from scratch. I ordered the tilapia tacos and it was a taco full of mush and bland pescado. it really needed some salt and some type of CRUNCH to it. and the tortillas were a joke. I came during work lunch so I didn&#39;t try any drinks. I wouldn&#39;t mind coming back to give THAT a try but no more food for me."

Disappointed as the food was decent

Not going back"

We had a 6:30 reservation and wasn&#39;t sat till about 6:55(wasn&#39;t too big of a deal). Our server might be new so I&#39;m gonna go easy here and not say it&#39;s his fault that we have been waiting almost an hour and a half for our food. 

Update: I went up to the manager and asked to speak to him, he came over and he explained that the issue is in the kitchen but didn&#39;t seem too sympathetic. I explained to him that I&#39;m very disappointed because we are here for a birthday and this dinner ruined it. 

Our food came out (finally) cold and our orders were messed up. The cherry on top was when my girlfriend was served her food, not only did they put the wrong meat in her tacos(and it was cold), when I went to put some sour cream on the chips there was a large black hair waiting for me in the sour cream.  

They comped us $80 bucks(which is a slap in the face) and the manager explained that it was all that he could do. To be honest I don&#39;t think he could comp us anymore because the restaurant had to comp a majority of the people that eat here tonight. Sadly, I don&#39;t even think a free meal could compensate for the 3 hours of my life I will never get back(kind of joking) 

I&#39;ve heard such amazing things about this restaurant, but I will not be returning."

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!   Went there on a Saturday night pretty late around 830. Place was busy but only quoted a 30 min wait time. We waited a 40 min host stand said another 10 min.  Repeated this cycle 3 times.  Finally after asking for manager 2 times.  One came and told us their Point of sale system was down for the last hour and their restaurant was basically shut down??? And ur a manager interesting way to solve a problem.  No one knows how to write a paper ticket I guess.   We said we were leaving and the manager asked to stay and that he would comp some stuff for us because of thr time it took.  Mind you two hours had passed we would have left if told earlier but now all the kitchens in other restaurants we beginning to close  so we were stuck.  

Sit down for dinner,  here is the bullets

1)They were out of this and that. Settled for what they did have. 
2)Asked for extra sauce,  they told me the kitchen was closed.   
3)Server was clearly irritated we were there so late. Even though the manager asked us to stay
4)Food tasted like we&#39;ll North American Mexican food.  Nothing authentic about and their &#34;made from scratch&#34;  line not sure what that is supposed to imply but if it is that it taste better or something.  That&#39;s a lie. 

Got the bill they comped one $5 g guacamole. For a table of 6 people

Don&#39;t go yet readers it gets better!
I asked for manager,  they told me manager In charge is not available.   Told me to call Sunday. 

I call Sunday first manager tells me that she does not handle these issues and second manager  tells hears my story.  Ask for my name and phone and say all customer service issues are handled by corp office human  resources department and I&#39;ll get a call in 2 days??? I literally laughed on the phone.  I was like o really so I give them the info. 

As u expected no call... I called back got the GENERAL MANAGER  that&#39;s right folks the supposed queen bee. She was the worst out of all of them. Lady right of the bat was irritated didn&#39;t want to hear my story said corp handles all issues after the customer has left. 

No call no answer.  I called corp my self left a message on some lady&#39;s voicemail that supposedly handles these issues.

Again no call 

I am a Foodie been to every place in naperville large and small.  By far the worst experience worst place.  Bad customer service,  average food.  If you want to pay to have a bad time. Then go to unkle Julios naperville............"

I met a group of friends. There was 12 of us and all arrived at different times. I was greeted and they knew exactly what party I was with and walked me to my table right away. The server did a great job of getting our drinks appetizers and main dish out in a timely manor. I ordered a sangria but I felt like there was more ice than drink so I decided to order the pineapple margarita and was very impressed with the flavor. I ordered the guacamole and chips as my appetizer and they came out and made it right I front of me. As my main dish I ordered the fish tacos.

First, the good. The red sangria was very good. We ordered two each because after drinking the first one, we were sold. My wife loved the salsa that came with the chips. It had a sort of smoky flavor to it, which I didn&#39;t really care for so I ordered a small side of guacamole, which came on a bed of lettuce. For $6, they didn&#39;t really give you much of the guacamole and the lettuce was there as a filler cause I&#39;ve never heard of lettuce with guacamole. 

We ordered filet mignon fajitas for two and at first the waitress said that they only served it for one but on the menu it said for two so she checked and came back saying that they did have it for two.. When they brought it to us, it didn&#39;t seem like the size of the steak was for two and for close to $50, i expected more than that. Anyway, the order was supposed to come with rice and beans but it was never brought to us. Also, my wife ordered tamales and those never came either. We let our waitress know and she apologized for not bringing the complete order but when the bill came, there was no discount or anything. At least they took out the tamale they never brought. They even put the tip amounts ranging from 15% to 22%?? 

Look, this place has good food, no doubt about it but it definitely is well overpriced and you don&#39;t really get what you pay for in terms of what they give you. I probably will be back but this time I will know how to order so I can compare the portion sizes. I think I definitely was taken for a ride in regards to the fajitas."

As one of the other poster says; the décor is really nice, the service was great, a very pleasant helpful young man. But the food was a let down. We ordered a guacamole app which was good, didn&#39;t want to spring for the 12 bucks for made fresh at the table.... it&#39;s Xmas time so not as flush as usual, LOL. The chips are good, light and not too greasy. The hot sauce had a nice little kick but then the disappointment was the chicken fajitas. First they talk about made from scratch, the chicken looks like it just came out of a freezer and was just warmed up, not much taste to it at all. Then there was like zero green or red peppers with the chicken, it was ALL onion. The sides they served with it, was just ok as well, beans, rice, gauc. Cheese and a little Pico. 
Overall it&#39;s an ok experience but for the price you&#39;d expect more. 
Ma&#39; lady also said her sangria was watered down.
Finally I wish Mexican restaurants would join in the craft beer craze that&#39;s been going on, they all still serve only Mexican beer or the Bud and Miller Products. We need some IPA&#39;s."

It&#39;s a chain restaurant that has lost its original charm.  The food is good, but expected more for the money.  

The chips were on the same level as the ones at Chili&#39;s.  The salsa of the fire roasted variety was decent but missing some spice.  Only after we had our entree were we told about the spicy salsa.  

We ordered the chicken/steak fajitas for two.  These came out as all fajitas do, sort of.  The presentation was there but the follow through was missing.  Your typical fajitas come on a fire hot cast iron skillet. This skillet was not that sizzling hot as you would expect just kinda warm.  Kind of disappointed not to get the bell peppers and onions that are usually kinda stuck to the skillet.   When ordering the fajitas know that they do offer both corn and flour tortillas.  You will be brought flour. They do offer different style beans (black, refried and ranchero).  You will be brought the ranchero.  The meat was tender but couldn&#39;t tell if it was the butter slathered over the top or it actually being cooked well.  Again the food isn&#39;t bad, it&#39;s just we expected more.  

The restaurant was clean and it was a comfortable environment.  The wait was 25 to 30 minutes, as you can expect for a new restaurant.  The wait staff was pleasant and attentive."

I did notice some negative comments towards management. And what I will say is that I noticed a couple of tables around us complaining about the service. On a busy Friday or Saturday night, I feel like you can expect service not to be as quick. From what I overheard, management handled everything professionally and politely.

I stood at the hostess stand for at least 3 minutes while being ignored by all 4 &#34;hosts&#34;, when my friend came up and said she had grabbed a dirty table at the bar due to the long wait- typical for a Friday, wasn&#39;t mad about that. However; took us at least 5 minutes for someone to come over and greet us. We ordered nachos for an appetizer; they took over 45 minutes to get out us. Our server did apologize for that. It was the entrees that really did it in though. I ordered steak fajitas, my friend ordered chicken fajitas. My steak fajitas came out with half chicken, half steak, my server noticed and said she would bring me out another portion of steak; very nice and helpful of her. The manager delivered it, which was a nice touch. The portions tho- for $20 you&#39;d think you would get more than 3 small pieces of skirt steak and greasy onions. 
Basically, long waits for food, small, over priced portions of food. But the service is great, minus the front host stand. Next time I think we will be going next door for dinner and save our time and money."

We actually decided to wait.  Good news is they played some upbeat Spanish music in the waiting area.   The decor feels like you&#39;re in a nice Mexican cantina.  Their bathrooms are nicely decorated and clean.  When we finally got our table, the waiter served us the chips and salsa and they were jam good :). I like how the chips were thin and not filling and the salsa dip was very tasty although if you like spicy salsa you might not agree but I like very mild salsa.  The chips are a bit oily but I didn&#39;t mind it.  I ordered the chicken and steak fajitas and I liked the meats, tender and juicy.  The tortillas were fresh so it was better than other Mexican restaurants.  Place gets pretty loud so it&#39;s hard to converse.  I felt like I was shouting a little.  I was expecting to wait for our food based on the other reviews and it being very busy but we were so surprised when it didn&#39;t even take 15 mins for the food to come out.  We also got the chocolate piñata for dessert which was different.  The waiters were very attentive.  I would say it costs a little more than other Mexican restaurants in the area but I think the cost was worth it.  I was pleasantly surprised with the service.

Atmosphere: This location is notably nicer than all of the other Uncle Julio&#39;s I have been to in Illinois and Texas. We found the bar area very comfortable to eat in. I could easily see spending some casual time there over margaritas. 

Food: The food was excellent. It is Tex-Mex, as opposed to Mexican. As long as you understand that going in, you can appreciate the fresh ingredients. As with their other locations, the highlights are the Fajitas and the Charra Beans. 

Service: The bartenders were great! Some of the crew relocated here from Texas, so it is not entirely new and inexperienced staff. I&#39;m sure there will be kinks to work out, but our experience was very good."

The restaurant has a really big bar &amp; nice overall decor. They have a lot of outdoor seating in the back &amp; side of the restaurant, which is great when the weather is nice.

We had a younger gal as our server. It would have been nice if they automatically bring you small plates with your salsa &amp; chips instead of having to specifically request them. I mean, am I supposed to eat right off of the table? The salsa is a little different. I think it is made with chipotle peppers, which not everyone likes. We ordered a small dish of guacamole, which was pretty good. I think it is whipped to give it a lighter texture.

My husband ordered the steak fajitas, which he liked. I ordered the cheese/onion &amp; chicken enchiladas. Not bad, but nothing to write home about either. I feel like the dish was more &#34;Americanized&#34; because they used the orange cheddar cheese instead of the real white Mexican that you would typically expect from a more authentic Mexican restaurant.

We ordered the special margarita of the day, which was the grapefruit margarita. It was good, but very weak. Usually, my max is 2 drinks, so some might say that I am a bit of a light weight when it comes to drinking. After 3 margaritas, I wasn&#39;t even feeling at all tipsy! I guess I have a real problem with restaurants that charge you high prices ($11 per drink) when they barely have any alcohol in them!! It makes me feel like the restaurant has just stolen from me!! $66 for 6 margaritas with barely no alcohol is quite the rip off!!

Bottom line, I like Cozymel&#39;s in Wheaton much better. There are plenty of other restaurants in the area where you can get better authentic Mexican food. I would definitely try other restaurants before making another trip back. Sorry Uncle Julio&#39;s, I will have to &#34;scratch&#34; you off of my go to restaurant list!"

Took the waiter a little while to come to a table &amp; I had to ask him to bring the sling &amp; we finally got it. He didn&#39;t seem happy at all, it was hard to enjoy our time with a grumpy waiter. The food was good but not so good that it was worth the high prices. We ordered the chocolate piñata &amp; it was the best part of our meal. It was delicious but it did take a while for them to bring it out. It was after we were half way done with out desert that we finally got refills on our drinks. Needless to say, the food was okay &amp; service was terrible. Probably won&#39;t come back."

Uncle Julios just recently opened in Naperville.  Was concerned the service and coordination would be subpar. We&#39;ve been to the UJ in Lombard years ago and never returned because it wasn&#39;t a good experience.  However, everything last night was fantastic! The guacamole was fresh and made to order.  Their signature UJ Margarita was very good. My wife and I shared the chicken and steak fajitas for two.  It was excellent! Our waiter Berzain was one of the best Servers we ever had. Great personality and passionate about his job. We will return."

We ordered, we watched other table get food around us. The waiter was nowhere in sight. Patiently waiting without complaining finally we asked an hour and 20 minutes later and the waiter said he would check then 5 minutes. Around 1.5 hours the manager comes to tell us our order was lost in the kitchen and asked us what we got. Our third member had to leave because it was taking so long. Once our food came out over an HOUR AND A HALF after ordering my entire order was wrong! 

We ordered a lot of drinks and food and all they took off the receipt was a queso... What kind of customer service is that? We were waiting over a half an hour for food only for mine to come out completely wrong and they didn&#39;t even make our third member that left food?!

Since our ride left we were stuck taking an uber home on top of that. 

Insane first visit at the Naperville location don&#39;t see myself EVER revisiting after that awful experience."

It was an hour long wait if you don&#39;t. With a reservation we sat down right away. They cater to big parties too. Good bar area. Get the guacamole that is made fresh right at your table. Amazing skirt steak fajitas! Signature margarita swirly. Good service, impressed with management checking in at our table. Definitely worth the going. Not cheap but worth it. High end food"

Place was tastefully decorated with dark ceramics, with a high end cultural appeal.  Subtle tropical music was playing (salsa, meringue, etc).

Was relieved to experience that the place was NOT a mainstream gimmicky Tex Mex place like chili&#39;s or On the boarder.  Restaurant was a nice chill place that focused on the food and classy casual environment.

Food was very good and flavorful!  Not a watered down bland menu.  Table side server making fresh guacamole was excellent!  The homemade tortillas (corn &amp; flour) was a nice addition that is not available at a lot of places (many other restaurants use prepackaged tortillas). 

Only thing that was not my favorite was the rice, but everyone else seemed to like it.  

Overall, a great place and worth checking out!  Will definitely come back."

We ordered the guac and queso, veggie tamales and the shrimp and lobster soup. The chips and guac/queso were great. The veggie tamales were kind of bready to me but I dipped in the salsa which was yummy. The soup was a tad spicy, but was good nonetheless. The Mexican mojito was spot on!"

Tacos came with no cheese or sour cream and tasteless. I ordered carne asada not bad but definetly not worth the price , tasteless beans and rice . Also I got no sour cream and cheese either I had to ask for it and they charged me for it as a side order . Never was asked for refills on drinks either . Forgot to mention hostess was rude , we requested a booth and were never asked if we wanted to sit outside or inside , we were seated in a non boot hand said we requests a booth and had to wait extra time to get a booth , to bad because we had to give up our seat at the bar . We won&#39;t be going back ."

We were seated almost immediately (we were 5 minutes early for our reservation), and there was a nice seating area and/or cool bar to sit at while we waited. Highly recommend getting the fresh guacamole made at your table - not only is it delicious but it&#39;s fun to watch! The menu seemed a little pricy at first, but the portion size and taste are totally worth it. We were seated by the fresh tortilla stand and got to enjoy watching the chefs make fresh tortillas and chips that were brought right to the table. My fiancé ordered the Juanita&#39;s platter which included a chicken and beef enchilada, a crunchy beef taco and a pork tamale all with different sauces with rice and beans which was fantastic! Definitely check out Uncle Julios for a date or girls night out with delicious margs!"

I&#39;ve been to the one in Lombard and the service was much better. I&#39;m not sure if its because this location is newer but they don&#39;t have it together smh. The server was a scatter brain and seemed over whelmed. When we asked him why things were coming out wrong he seemed to be making up things without going and asking why. He did not put our order in when we asked so we waited longer than we should have had to he also kept saying he was busy but it WAS NOT busy in the restaurant. I only ordered appetizers so my food was fine but 5 of the women in my party were very disappointed with their order. Some plates came out cold some plates did not have all their order and the beans with one plate was runny and the rice was dry. We asked for the manager on multiple occasions and they couldn&#39;t seem to find one. When one did show up she had an attitude and even though she comped our meal she was not very accommodating.

The setting and decor is very nice and the service was just okay. I got the chicken and steak fajitas and the steak was tough and the chicken was not trimmed, it had fat and skin on it (yuck) The homemade guac was really good as were the chips. The  restaurant was also Freezing. The waiter  even agreed with us and  it was hard to enjoy the meal because it was so cold. I would not go back."

Been sitting at our table for 45 mins and service is very very poor. No one has come by to give us the status of our dinner. We have two kids with us who are hungry and keep eating chips! 

Dinner finally came at 8:00! We were missing a few items and only realized much later we never got them. 

Overall service is very slow and blah! Food quality is mediocre. Nothing special. Will not be returning again. Too many other nicer options around this area."

We were seated quickly and our server was pretty attentive, although all of the staff seemed to be in a frenzy. The salsa was decent, chips were good. Great margaritas and i ordered the guadalajara fajitas which were very good. This place seems to be a little overpriced but was pretty good. I would return."

 I need to stress that uncle julios was my go to restaurant and I use to drive to lombard and get it.  Excited Naperville location opened.  Said that,  they SO screwed up my order (nachos platter and The bacon wrapped shrimp dish)three shrimps and cold ( should be six) (I mean like it was sitting out,  cold). 

Now, I called them that day I ordered.  The male Manager (and I didn&#39;t get his name - my fault there)  said they would redo my order.  What he didn&#39;t tell me it was only that same day! Which he didn&#39;t.  Usually,  if there is a rare issue like this places usually say &#34;we can fix that, what day do you want to come in and I&#39;m sorry and just come in,  ask/say try name&#34; (the mgr)  and we&#39;ll redo your order&#34;.  I called to re-order today after a week plus.  ROBIN the Manager said &#34;we can&#39;t do that only the same day of the order so you&#39;re going to have to call corporate&#34;. Remember,  my meal I paid for was over $40.00.  So I call SHELBY of guest services at 972-554-6886. #2 and press guest services.  Left her vm.  (She&#39;s the only contact it seems for that department)  At Extension 8926. She actually asked me if I remembered the mgrs name.  I said no but it is one of your male mgrs there. (she can call her mgrs to verify).  

But,  NO! She asked for my credit card proof of purchase.  That&#39;s their CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  I was livid!  So,  I lost money. Yelp these concerns.  Share the number and you won&#39;t get ANYTHING  redone or anything but SORRY,  WE CAN&#39;T DO THAT!  

The good is better at Lombard and definitely Chicago but I truly am DONE with that company because of this and went to corporate! 

Hope this helps."

After living downtown for years near the Lincoln Park location, I was so excited they were building an Uncle Julio&#39;s in Naperville. After my experience Friday night, I&#39;d honestly rather drive to Chicago or eat at any other Mexican restaurant in the area. 

When we arrived, we were told it was a 30 minute wait for two at 6pm. Fine, that&#39;s expected. However, that was after waiting for the five people at the hostess stand to take their eyes off their iPads for a second to look up at me. Their attitude was pretty rude and dismissive, and we didn&#39;t appreciate it at all. Next, try to find a place to wait. It&#39;s so cramped and chaotic with servers running around trying to get through the sea of people to their tables while bumping everyone and everything in the process. We were finally seated almost an hour later (thanks for the 30 minute estimate). 
The actual dining experience was sub par as well. Way over priced for basic food that tastes like hamburger helper. Our waiter was rude also and acted like we were inconveniencing him by ordering food. My boyfriend also got hit by so many servers and people walking by because they packed the tables to close together. Nothing like feeling as if you&#39;re part of the conversations going on around you because you&#39;re basically sitting in their lap. 
All in all, I will never waste my time here again. If I want to spend money on overpriced rice and beans I&#39;ll head to the downtown location. At least they&#39;re not so rude there. Anyone thinking of coming here, don&#39;t even bother, it&#39;s not worth your time or business."

The service is attentive, quick and friendly! Who doesn&#39;t love fresh guacamole prepared at their table??!!?? I would recommend the chicken enchiladas, ceviche or combo plate where you can try a few different items. I didn&#39;t care for the rice and beans but everything else is tasty! They have a pretty big outdoor patio that wraps around the restaurant. On one of the occasions, I went with my co-workers for lunch, there were around 25 of us and we had the private room.

I got the fish tacos and the avocado crema was perfectly paired.  I never got the lobster bisque I ordered, which was sad, so one star off for that.  Our meals were delivered by someone other than our main waitress or I would have asked.  And by the time she came back, she had our check, so I figured it was a lost cause.  I&#39;d definitely come back and have some fajitas.  Be aware - no burritos on this menu - but you&#39;ll have plenty of other options."

Tonight we did not have a reservation, and we were told it was a 1 hour 20 min. wait.  Knowing the quality of the food, we decided to wait.  After an hour and a half of waiting, and watching everyone get seated in the waiting area...we knew something went wrong.  Mistakes happen...  I&#39;m ok with that!  But instead of apologizing, they asked for 5 minutes... and continued to seat other guests.  Now, I was mad!  When I confronted the host, she retorted that everyone else had reservations.  It was a lie, because I heard the host giving wait times.  Finally we were seated at a dirty table...  And the steak fajitas  were chewy...  Not worth the wait.  An apology would&#39;ve been nice. We will think twice next time."

I came here expecting a gringo version of the food I love so much, boy was I wrong! The carne asada was very tender and flavorful and enchiladas are amazing! The beans and rice truly are authentic. The guacamole is great as well. The only knock I have is that the salsa isn&#39;t spicy enough for me but the flavor is on point!

We had reservations at 4pm on a Sunday afternoon. There were 4 adults and 2 kids (only 1 old enough to eat though). It took over 10 minutes to see our waitress- Gina, in order to place drink orders and a kids meal order. It took her 3 trips to the bar to retrieve 2 alcoholic drinks and 2 non-alcoholic drinks (the bottle of beer that just needed the cap taken off took the longest). She passed by our table an additional 3 times before we could place an order for the tableside guac and our dinner orders. 
The food was ok. I had the Guadalajara which is 3 jalapeno and bacon wrapped shrimp with steak and chicken combo fajitas. The jalapeno in stuffed in the shrimp was microscopic and there was no spice to it at all. The meats on the fajitas were fatty and not pleasant to bite into. Of course, the tortillas didn&#39;t come out with my fajitas and when I asked for them, it was like I was asking for the Eiffel Tower to be delivered to the table. Other people in our party had ordered sour cream and guac as sides to their meals- none of their sides came out as ordered. Everything seemed to be a huge ordeal and a special order.
We had fully intended on ordering the chocolate piñata- because we were there celebrating a birthday, but we just couldn&#39;t bear to sit there another hour and wait for Gina to bring it to us at her leisure.
For a 4pm dinner on a Sunday to take 2 hours is a bit ridiculous. I would like to try the restaurant again in the future- but give Gina the waitress a chance to be fired and move on before I will be back. Best of luck if you are stuck with Gina- hope you have hours to spend with her pleasantness!"

It&#39;s a good suburban Mexican eatery and it replaced Zapatista which closed down in the area. The table side gaucamole is delightful and flavorful. The plus is that the cater the heat to your taste. The BACON WRAPPED CAMARONES were great, but really unhealthy. If that&#39;s your thing, go for it! :). I&#39;ve also had the Chicken Enchiladas (salsa verde) and those to were phenomenal. The drinks are really good too! Margaritas and swirls both! Service overall is awesome!

Unfortunately, that where the good news ends. As many have noted, the place is unbearably hot (like over 80 degrees) and the heat makes it very uncomfortable. The drinks aren&#39;t cheap and I&#39;m not sure if my margarita ever saw an actual tequila bottle (very weak and pulpy). Super noisy and chaotic with people waiting everywhere (bet that won&#39;t last long) and servers running all over. Speaking of which, the service is painfully slow. Our group was seated at 6:45 and didn&#39;t have a check until 9:30, glad we didn&#39;t have to make a movie. Towards the end, we would order our next drink when he brought our current one, just because we knew it would take so long to get the next one. The table side guac is way too chunky, basically big chunks of avocado with some tomato and onion thrown on top. We ended up mixing it further by ourselves.

At approximately 4:15 pm we arrived, and a female employee at check in told us to wait a few minutes to be seated due to shift change.  We waited for approximately 10 minutes and was told the wait would be longer than anticipated. We asked again what was the reason for the wait since MANY tables appeared to be available.  The same employee informed us again the delay was due to a shift change.  The employee offered us the bar area and seating outside.  We politely declined to both - a 6 year old at the bar? We did not have a reservation, but if there was no seating inside we could have been told that and we would have accepted that.  I thought it was unusual we could get a seat outside and at the bar.  So the shift change did not delay sitting in those  areas?  I have dined at Uncle Julios for several years at the Lombard location.  The experience I had today in Naperville was very disappointing, and I will share this experience with many others.  Such a bummer, especially when this location is closer to home. Ugh."

All three visits have been for lunch and we were immediately seated.  

I love their fresh chips and salsa and their table-side quacamole to start with.  I signed up for their diner card on my first visit and received free quac on my next.

Great bartenders, but we already realize there aren&#39;t enough staff, just by watching them run around. I felt sorry for them. We go ahead and order our drinks and food at the same time. The food was EXCELLENT....Tex-Mex. Everything fresh and very tasty and we are picky regarding our Mexican food. As the time progressed, we watch other patrons come in, and they aren&#39;t happy - either they aren&#39;t waited on, or if they are sitting at the bar, aren&#39;t offered chips/salsa, nor are able to order drinks.

Walked in and the hostess asked how many, answered two. She then asked if we had a reservation, I thought it was an odd question since it was 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon and 80% of the tables were empty, anyway I asked if we needed one, of course we did not.

The hostess brought us to our table and asked if we liked Mexican food, my wife is Mexican and we&#39;re at a Mexican restaurant so I guess we do. A few more of the typical hostess formalities and we began looking at the menu. Ten minutes later we were looking at each other waiting for a server to at least nod, say they would be right with us or even flip us off, nothing. There were two other tables being served in our section and noticed at least 4 servers walking around, no one offered water or chips said someone would with us.

So we decided to leave, as we walked out the same hostess that seated us 15 minutes earlier began telling us to have nice afternoon, you would think she would have realized we could not have eaten yet as she just seated us a short while before and no else had entered after us.  I explained to her and the other hostess that a server never showed and we were leaving. Just quick &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34; and just let us walk out the door. This was my first visit to any Uncle Julio&#39;s and it will also be my last."

I tried calling the phone number and looked all over online and that was the only phone number listed. It kept saying it was out of service. I emailed the restaurant but the only reply I got was when I commented on the page. I was told the phone wasn&#39;t working and they weren&#39;t delivering today. When I got to the drive thru the girl told me they don&#39;t always deliver and it depends on if they have specials. That&#39;s very disorganized. She was very pleasant but that was the longest I have ever waited in a drive thru. I started getting sleepy in the car I was there so long. I hoped that with that wait and a recommendation from my friend it would be good. Also I ordered 2 fries and she only put in one. So I paid for another one and it took forever just for fries!
The food, it was not good. We were very disappointed. The hamburgers are very small and there&#39;s really no taste to them. My Brother and I both salted them to give them some flavor but I didn&#39;t even finish mine. The fries I heard were so good they were really nothing special. My Mom&#39;s hot dog was falling apart. The bun was too thin. I tried one of the chicken fingers and again just not great.
I haven&#39;t tried the pie I got yet but Mom tried it and didn&#39;t like it.
I was very disappointed with my experience here. Portillos has way better hamburgers and their drive thru is so fast and efficient. I was the only car in the drive thru at ChiShack and I only saw a few cars in the lot so I have no idea what took so long.
We tried it to try something new but we won&#39;t be back."

Ordered a single Chi burger and fries. I immediately noticed the cook opening up a bag of frozen fries, disappointing. 

The food itself was pretty mediocre. The burger was pretty messy, and the patty was pretty cold. I assume the patty was frozen as well.

I want to give it another shot, but there are better burgers in the area.

If you claim to be &#34;Chicago&#39;s Great Food&#34;, at least have fresh cut fries!!!"

So I&#39;ve noticed Chishack a few times as I&#39;ve been out running errands but never stopped. I&#39;ve never heard of it before so I wasn&#39;t sure if it was anything special. So today I decided to give it a go. I ordered a jumbo dog, cheese fries, and a chocolate shake  (). I ordered it to go to bring home to eat (mind you that I live less than 5 minutes away). By the time I got home to dig in the hot dog was cold. And there was waaay too much relish on there that made the bun all soggy. All I was able to try was a couple bites before I had enough... But at least the fries were good?  They&#39;re still skin on, which I love, and not too salty, which is another bonus. And for a small you get a lot of fries! Now for the best part... dun dun dunnnnn... the chocolate shake. Seriously. So damn good. It didn&#39;t taste like it came out of a bag (cough, cough, mcd&#39;s, cough, cough), rather that actually chocolate and ice cream were used. Now I really have no idea how the shake is actually made, but this one is awesome!

So, all in all... I&#39;d obviously go back for another shake... but I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;m sold on much else there... But I may give it one more go, it just might be a little while."

I work close by and was excited when they finally opened. What I got was like a buffalo chicken burger and the chifries. The worst burger and fries I ever ate. From the very first bite til the last one was one disappointment after the next. When looking at the burger you&#39;d expect like flavor, but all I taste was blandness like they just put red food coloring into the chicken tender the used. Now then I ate the fries which was like garlic fries call the chifries honestly it was plain fries in a bunch of oil with some parm garlic and still just oily n flavorless. Like other people&#39;s review aren&#39;t lying about this place. 

Overall the buffalo burger and chifries are flavorless and horrible. But I will go back in maybe 2 weeks and give it another try. Hopefully they step up there game, but we&#39;ll just have to see"

Had the 1/4 pound burger. Was awesome: hot, juicy, cheese perfectly melted, great flavor. 

Chi fries: really good with lots of Parmesan cheese. 

***Chocolate shake was out of this world!!! They obviously use REAL ice cream and it was a premium shake for sure. Well worth the $3.50 price. 

This place is understandably close to Buona and Portillos. ***But give it a rest with the comparisons to this fine family run establishment. 

Both Portillos and Buona are giant corporations who care little about what the customer gets. Portillos makes their own hotdogs instead of buying Vienna, just to cut costs... And many more inside tips from this 6-year Portillos manager of the past. 

This place has fresh ground burgers. Portillos/Buona....tasty yes, But frozen patties from the box. And so on---"

My hubs got the double chishack burger w garlic butter and parmesean fries and I got the blue line turkey sub. 
The burger was AMAZING it was so juicy and so fresh. My sub was huge and also fresh and delicious. The fries were amazing, so crispy and tasty, probably the best fries I have ever had. 

I highly recommend anyone to try this place! Fresh delicious food is always a plus. The menu is not too big or too small, they have hot dogs, salad, chili, burgers, subs, fries etc. The young man with the big blue eyes who took our order was very kind and helpful with helping us to decide what to order."

Employees were welcoming and insightful on sharing their best practices. I came later at night,  around 9pm, watched them cook everything to order .

The hot dogs were as good as anywhere else in the area.  My family did not like the regular fries as they were soggy and flimsy. 

An avid lover of the combo (Italian beef and sausage),  I was anxious to try this place.  After all, they located their business between Portillo&#39;s and Buona.  Their beef and sausage are good, and would be popular in a lot of places.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s not good enough for where they are located and lacks the uniqueness or quality to make me want to return for their combo, but I will give them another shot as they just opened last week.   

Digressing:  The sandwich immediately reminded me of a sandwich shop on Vincennes in the industrial area of South Holland.  Yelpers gave that restaurant 4.5 stars, but there&#39;s no way it would get 4.5 stars in this location.  I swear they use the same bun and beef supplier.       

The inside has a Chicago theme that looked pretty good.  The service was understandably slower than you would expect.  The cashier was pleasant, albeit visibly cold from the drive thru window. They should let her wear a hoodie or jacket or something.  

Overall,  this is my type of place; yet there are other similar establishments nearby.  It will be interesting to see how long they can stay open.  Do they have a signature item?  The hot dogs were pretty good.  They had a blue line and a red line sub that sounded pretty good.  I&#39;ll be back next week to check out the chicken sandwich or sub."

So I brought my Dad here after running some errands and visiting some family friends in the area.  We did not come at peak time.  I think we were there around 1:30 p.m. on a Saturday.

We walked in and I thought they did a nice job with redoing what was an old KFC.  Nice furniture, everything was clean and we had no problem navigating to the counter.

So I ordered my Dad a single cheeseburger, small reg fry and a vanilla milkshake.  He loves ice cream!  Food was hot and Dad loved it.  He really enjoyed the milkshake.  I had the red line sub and their Chi fries which have garlic and parmesan.  Ya, don&#39;t judge...we don&#39;t eat like this every day and it was an alcohol free lunch to boot!

I felt like this is a step up from some of the chains.  The food looked more &#34;homemade.&#34;  I hope this place makes it.

If you&#39;re going to be a mile away from Portillo&#39;s, something needs to stand out - price, taste, service, etc. I&#39;m all for small businesses succeeding, but it&#39;s based on effort and knowing your market. Gave this a few tries and nothing convincing to make me come back."

Ordered a shake and fries...that&#39;s it.  You would have thought that with only 2 items the wait time would not be that slow but it was.  Have given this place a few trys and I think that we will find another burger place to go to in the future.  Only thing I can say that is really good is the burgers.

Price did include a drink. The fries were quite good and crispy; just the way I like them. I don&#39;t have any complaints about the burger other than it&#39;s kinda small for the price. I would say I&#39;ve probably had better for less. A meal option would have been nice instead of having to buy each item separately.  Would I come back?  Probably only if I was going with someone else who wanted to try the place.  I may give this place another try to see what else is on the menu, but if burgers are their specialty, this place is mediocre at best."

I don&#39;t know if you guys know proper flag etiquette but the American flag is always flown above any other flag. That is a disgrace to our country. 

&#34;When it is displayed from the same flagpole with another flag - of a state, community, society or Scout unit - the flag of the United States must always be at the top except that the church pennant may be flown above the flag during church services for Navy personnel when conducted by a Naval chaplain on a ship at sea.&#34;

By far one of the worse food experiences I have ever had. We went here about two weeks after they opened, and we expected some flukes as a new restaurant. I will tell you the food we got there was decent. Hotdogs and fries were good, chicken sandwich was decent. The service and them getting out order right was HORRIBLE!
First time we went there we ordered inside. We stood there for 15 minutes waiting for our food, while all the teenage workers stood there and talked. There was 3 men that looked like managers/owners of the place sitting in the lobby talking. Never checked on us, asked us how anything was nothing! We were watching them and they put our bag to be given out to the drive up.  They gave it to the car in the drive up, a minute later the car handed it back saying it was not there order. The lady took the bag from them, didn&#39;t even bother to look in it and just handed it to us. You can not give out food once another customer has received it. You need to make a new one. She didn&#39;t even make sure everything was in there. We left with the food and checked the bag in the car. It was missing two things so we went back in and told them. Manager apologized and gave us to food and told us to review them, so here it is.
We decided to try one more time, this time thru the drive up. We enjoyed the food so we hoped maybe the service would be better. Ordered and the lady taking our order hardly talked to us. Got my order completely wrong. She didn&#39;t even tell us how much we owed for the food, just took the card and gave us the receipt. Waited a long time to get our food, that was wrong. I ordered two hot dogs with ketchup, mustard, relish and grilled onions and a buffalo chicken sandwich. We got two different hotdogs, one with mustard ketchup and regular onions and one with ketchup mustard and sport peppers. The chicken sandwich somehow had the grilled onions on it. I went home and had to pick off half of the toppings  off of both of our sandwiches and hot dogs and switch them around and use our own toppings. Absolutely ridiculous. We were hoping for a better time because it has good food and a nice location for us, but we will not be returning here."

My first visit today was just to test the staple - a beef (hot, wet), with fries and a drink.  If Chishack can&#39;t pass this test, I&#39;ll pass on them.  Well, I give the beef a B-Plus -  I ordered it wet, which is usually just a ladle over, not a dip, but they dipped it, which makes the sandwich messier that I want for a work-day lunch.  Looking past that, it was a good beef sandwich. better than any I&#39;ve had at the place Dick sold out on recently.

The beef had a good, savory and herbed flavor and it was cooked properly with no fat to be seen and a chewy, fall apart texture.  The bread is very good, nice and chewy too, and ample thickness to soak up the au jus.  The giardiniera was regular old jarred stuff, nothing special so nothing to screw up.

The negative for me is the fries.  Now, I know everyone&#39;s tastes in fries are different, so most places are going to satisfy some and turn off others.  WIth that said, I don&#39;t think many will be satisfied with Chishack fries.  I ordered the regular fries, no seasoning or cheese, and they reminded me of Burger King&#39;s original fries.  Very crispy, almost of a texture like they are coated with some kind of starch, but nothing visible.  Its funny.  I  read in another reviewer who said the fries were soggy and limp, which mine were not at all.

Well, the beef was good enough that I will return to try the chicken tenders, which they self-promote as the best.  Maybe they should rename them Trump-tenders.  I also think I&#39;ll give their burger a try, but I&#39;ll pass on the fries.

As for the shop itself, the staff was helpful, wait was reasonable, one of the counter-servers was having her lunch break in-shop, so that gave me some confidence the food is otherwise good, and the seating was tight but nice atmosphere.  

Grades:  Seating:  B; Food (Beef only) - B+, fries - C-Minus; Value - C (almost $11 for beef, fries and a medium drink).  Overall, B on the strength of the Beef and I&#39;ll be back for a couple more items."

Absolutely love it. I can&#39;t speak to the wait service for dine-in as I&#39;m always ordering take out, but the staff is always friendly and they now know me by name due to the frequency in ordering. They are always accurate with the time the food will be ready as well as the accuracy, I&#39;ve never had to wait. 

Now on the food... I love the egg rolls- they are always crispy and the dipping sauce just the right mix of sweet and sour. 

Pad See Ew- exceptional- I&#39;m not a spice girl, so their base sauce is perfect for me. 

My spouse generally gets the fried rice, Tom Yum soup spicy and/or Pad Thai spicy. In fact, because she likes all the vegetables that come in the vegetable Tom Yum, but also wants chicken, that&#39;s exactly what I order- Vegetable, add Chicken- And the order is never wrong. 

If you&#39;re used to Thai that is by default, spicy, make sure you ask for your dish spicy. I have had friends who expected a dish to be spicy but I didn&#39;t order that way, so they were disappointed, but now that I know that - none have had issues since."

We dined in at about 3pm on a Saturday, so it was not terribly busy and the service was excellent and attentive. The restaurant itself is quite small so I can imagine that at busier times you may have a bit of a wait.

Our meals were served promptly and very hot. We didn&#39;t get quite as much food as I would expect for the prices (for example, the $8.95 appetizer for two just has two very small selections of each appetizer). This restaurant does have a bar on site, so that is a nice option if you&#39;re looking for a night out with friends and drinks. We tried the Hawaiian Fried Rice and the Pad Thai, which were both ok. I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;d order the same thing again if I went back - it wasn&#39;t magical to me, but it was acceptable. I think what would keep me from going back is the high bill, with not much left over to take home. For a $40 meal, I would like to carry out a bit for tomorrow as well!"

A really nice, authentic restaurant with plenty to offer.

Decor:
Beautifully lit with candles and white table cloths and beautiful silverware.  The place is well decorated and very clean.  I&#39;m very picky about cleanliness and this place is one of the cleanest thai places I&#39;ve ever been to.

Food:
The food was fantastic! I ordered the chili chicken and it was perfect. A good portion was given with some delicious jasmine rice.  Excellent 

Service:
The waitresses were always helpful and informative about their food.  Waters were always refilled and our checks were picked up right away.  

Price:
Price was excellent.  Can&#39;t beat thai places pretty much when it comes to price per amount of food given. 

Conclusion:
The place is beautiful, clean with great and excellent service. Will definitely be back."

And you see a line of people waiting for seats and/or takeout, you know your fellow Yelpers haven&#39;t let you down.

And then when there&#39;s one table available right in front of you and you think you&#39;re going to have to wait forever for other diners to finish and they seat you immediately at said table? You know you&#39;re in for a good meal.

Any time I go to a new Thai place, I have to have the Pad Thai. Just have to. Ordered mine with tofu and shrimp and got a tempura appetizer. All of it...was GOOD. Tempura was crisp and light and the shrimp was fresh and sweet. Dipping sauce was sticky and sour and perfect with the tempura.

Pad thai was hot and the noodles were thin and the sauce was saucy instead of dry. Ingredients were fresh and the tofu was served crispy and in large, rectangular blocks. None of these tiny, hard-to-find bits sprinkled throughout. 

It&#39;s good, ya&#39;ll. Real good. Love how small this place was yet how kind of upscale it felt without making you uncomfortable for wearing a Cubs hat and jeans.

Recently, I went back with my family, and was disappointed on many levels. For one, it took about 15 minutes for a server to even ask for our drink orders, and another 10 minutes after the order was placed for three waters and two beers to arrive to the table. While I understand the restaurant gets quite busy, I do not think it should take 25 minutes for drinks to reach the table.

Our waitress was wholly preoccupied, and rarely checked in with us. In fact, she did not ask once if we were enjoying our meal or needed anything else.

The food itself was really less-than-average. I am spoiled in that I have lived in and visited several major cities, and had amazing Thai food. This was not amazing - not even close. Several of the dishes were served lukewarm, which probably did not boost the flavor profile. The satay arrived first with a gelatinous and gritty peanut sauce. The chicken rolls were lacking in chicken. The golden triangles had flavor, but needed a sauce. After three disappointing appetizers, I decided to play it safe with pad Thai as a main, but even that was somewhat tasteless, and the noodles had an odd stickiness. Hours later, I swore I still had little bits of peanut stuck in the back of my throat due to the gooey-ness of it all.

Altogether, we had a pretty bad meal with equally sub par service at Vino Thai. This time, we won&#39;t be back."

The fried items of the medley were fantastic.  Not being overly greasy/oily is key!!!  The coconut shrimp had the perfect texture with that fresh burnt coconutty aroma that may permeate inside your mouth without being overpowering.

The spring rolls/avocado rolls were fresh and springy.

The panang curry was nothing special in my opinion.  Very very light on the &#34;kick&#34; in regards to spices.  I would recommend a different curry if you&#39;re craving &#34;spicy.&#34;

1.25 for an extra tiny bowl of jasmine rice...why don&#39;t you provide sufficient rice in the first place for the curry?"

               Prices very reasonable 
               Full service bar
Neutral....  Food. I started with Tom Khan soup which was good and then had stir fry broccoli with chicken and I could&#39;ve had at any of many Thai places that I&#39;ve been, nothing to write home about but not bad. My son had chicken fried rice and he said the same about his dish. We have Chopsticks over by us and food there is much better, but they don&#39;t have a liquor license.
Overall, good choice if you&#39;re in the area but wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to get there."

Our staples are the crab rangoon (so delicate yet so tasty!), the green curry with chicken (I get extra eggplant, mild in spicyness which is spicy but manageable spicy), and the red curry chicken (mild spicy but red curry is definitly spicier than green).

Their curry is perfectly creamy yet not soupy and has the perfect amount of coconut milk! Pour curry dish over white rice that comes with and perfection!

Asian is something I must have several times per week so I Yelped out the area and decided to try Vino Thai.  I was not disappointed.  When I&#39;m on the road I typically will order two entrees, one safe and one not so much, just in case I don&#39;t care for the risky dish. So I ordered Chicken Pad Thai as my safe bet and Crazy Noodle (spicy hot) with beef. 

The Pad Thai smelled so good and looked even better that I ate from it first.  I found it to be slightly dry, but very delicious. I thought about just eating it and keeping the Crazy for later, but I needed that spicy taste so I dug in to the Crazy Noodles.  Again, slightly dry, but the flavors were very good.  I found myself trying to grab a little bit of everything on each forkful. I asked for spicy, but they could have knocked it up another notch to put it in my mmm mmm zone. 

I would definitely eat here again.  Also, I had my food to go which could account for some moisture evaporation and the dryness.  Still had enough moisture to keep my interest. Yum! Yum!"

The atmosphere was nice and intimate, and we had great, timely service. I know Thai places aren&#39;t exactly famous for their martinis (I ordered a Cosmo) but I did expect better since they had a &#34;Martini&#34; selection on the menu. The glass I received mine in was more than half the size SMALLER than a regular martini would be. It was so tiny and was not strong at all, either. $7 for just some cranberry juice, pretty much. 

As for my meal, I ordered an entree called the Garlic Delight. Would not order again. It sounded so appealing....choice of meat, with mushrooms and young corn, on a bed of broccoli and in a garlic sauce. The garlic sauce was great but ALL of the vegetables were still half raw...uncooked....hard. I was pretty bummed about it as I love vegetables but these just didn&#39;t taste good together as they were still mostly raw. My date had a delicious looking meal though. Beef, noodles and vegetables, which he greatly enjoyed...so it looks like some of the meal selections are hit or miss. 
The crab rangoons were delicious, light and flaky, though! Would go back just to have those again AND try a different dish. 

Disappointed in drinks and my food. Nice, little place with a lot of potential though...maybe some dishes need a few changes. Or a better chef to make sure things are cooked thoroughly!"

After enjoying a good laugh, we decided to check it out.  Wow.  We really liked the place.
It has nice decor with a balance of a homey feel.  At first we were a bit worried bringing our 15 month old, cause some times if she&#39;s feeling rowdy, we don&#39;t want to create a ruckus in the smaller restaurants.  It turns out there was nothing to fear. 

The staff was very friendly and enjoyed playing peekaboo with our daughter.  They took turns to make sure we were taken care of which is kind of nice.  It wasn&#39;t super busy but it wasn&#39;t quiet either.  It&#39;s nice when there is a team mentality so you don&#39;t have to look for your specific waiter/waitress.  Quite a lot of pickup orders came through while we were eating.  So that must be a good sign.

We both got bubble smoothies (green tea and honey dew).  They were a little sweet, but the tapioca balls were very yummy.  Not like undercooked or anything like some places.  We also got the sampler of apps to try out some of their different apps.  They were pretty good overall.

I got the kao soy and my wife got the Pad Thai.  They were both pretty good.  The Kee Mao was a little different than the one I usually get but it was still delicious and I was happy to have the option.  It isn&#39;t always available at many other Thai restaurants.  The Pad Thai was also pretty good in my opinion.  Believe it or not you can get bad Pad Thai.  The fresh sprigs of cilantro were delicious.

Will definitely be back."

I&#39;m not always a fan of Thai food, but the food here is delicious and this will probably be our go to Thai restaurant. It&#39;s a bit far from where I live... there are Thai restaurants closer to me, but it&#39;s worth the trip. I found the prices to be reasonable, and they do carry-out

I had the pad Thai for dinner and a honey dew bubble tea as a drink. The meal was great but the tea was a little on the sweet side. Regardless, it was scrumptious. The staff was very friendly and the food came out quick, fresh and hot. The atmosphere is quaint, and it is a family friendly environment.

I am having dinner at this place as I write this review and I don&#39;t see why people rated it 4.5 stars! The service is mediocre but I get it... I came during rush hour dinner time but it could be better managed. I ordered the papaya salad which I had a discussion about with the waiter that I wanted it &#34;hot&#34; Asian hot not American hot and for everyone that knows what Im talking about...there is a big difference. 20 minutes later( ya I know) the papaya got to my table with no spice at all...Uhm hello Sawatika... I thought this was a Thai restaurant?!  Sorry,I have to be a snob... I have to because I live for Thai food it&#39;s my favorite!!!! 

The minute I walked in I should have known it was one of those scenes where you know they catered to certain palettes!  I had to send my papaya salad back so they can add the Thai chili that was clearly missing and the funny thing is the waiter questioned me as he proceeded to dig the fork in my salad like he was gonna find Nemo in there... Wow! 

At last the PANANG curry... thank god it was good as I was getting ready to duke it out with the cook! I can see the chili pepper and the consistency of the sauce was great just the way I like it! The only complaint I have is the beef was a little over cooked. Another thing I did notice was they charged a pretty penny for an extra cup of rice! Again I get it you gotta make money where you could but $1.25?. I&#39;m not trying to be cheap because everyone knows I drop a lot of money on good food since I do have expensive taste but really? It wasn&#39;t just a dollar it was a dollar .25 how random.. Lol

 In conclusion, as I go through the taste of Thailand the verdict still stands ...the ambiance does not determine the authenticity because clearly the white table cloth fooled me."

My wife and I went there on a Saturday night during prime dinner time. Needless to say, it was a little crowded, however they managed to continually sit people at a good rate.

We ordered a honeydew bubble tea, a beer, chicken tom yum soup, veggie tom kha soup, and split an order of Crazy Noodles with chicken (extra spicy).

The bubble tea was refreshing, the beer was okay (not really my type of beer), and the soups were great. Both were extremely flavorful and loaded with ingredients. The Crazy Noodles were also delicious. The level of spiciness was perfect and the dish itself was a hearty portion.

Initially I was planning on giving VinoThai a 4/5. However, right after dinner we went a couple stores down and got frozen yogurt. Within a minute of being there our server shows up with my wife&#39;s purse, which she had forgotten at the table. Bonus star for the server hunting us down and returning the purse!

Overall, I would definitely recommend to anyone; more than likely this will end up as our go-to Thai restaurant in the area."

I used the last of my dying phone battery to send an SOS to my husband:  Must. Have. Thai. Food.  

Twenty minutes later, we were enjoying our first Thai takeout since moving to the area last month.  Coming from the city where we regularly (too regularly, if you ask me) enjoyed King of Thai and Thai Spice (shout out!), we were worried about finding something that would measure up.  We needn&#39;t  have worried.  I may have been 5- minutes-from-re-enacting-a-scene-from-&#34;Alive&#34; hungry, but this was seriously satisfying Thai.

I ordered their Mus Sa Mun curry (I think that translates to &#34;fattening deliciousness with 30 different spelling variations&#34;) as it&#39;s always a favorite of mine and if a place gets it right, I know I can trust them.  They got it right.  Creamy, not oily, with the perfect level of spicy sweetness.  My husband ordered the drunken noodles and the chicken potstickers and raved about both.

There should be a law against offering salmon if its not fresh.  Its like serving white wine that&#39;s turned to vinegar, you cant make people happy with this stuff.

My other complaint is the decor which got very little attention obviously and all your left to look at (besides friends, family, etc...) is the parking lot.  The restaurant in in a strip center, so its basically a box with white walls, a few Asian accents and not much else.

I think the problem is that I expected something a little fresher and not what its more like in reality, which is a mom-and-pop place serving Thai instead of your normal mom-and-pop all American-Chinese style restaurants with fried rice and crab rangoon (which I believe they offer any way).

Would I go back? Yes, but for lunch at what I hope are lunch prices....and knowing that my experience will be more in line with an American-Chinese restaurant that dot every suburb in America.  Good service and enough food to add five pounds before you pull into the drive way."

There was great service and very welcoming for busy and crowded lunch seen. The waitress was very good but food lacked that mixture of sweet and sour. The heat which is affiliated to dictate the temperature of what you tell the waitress in most authentic places you would not dare to say hot/spicy. but in american style Thai food with the bland basics of panda express and or noodles and company this you could and should dare to say spicy please.

Don&#39;t get me wrong get service and very cute small place but food I have experienced better."

(I probably just ended up on hundreds of Bear fans hit list).  Neapolitan style pizzas made in a wood burning brick oven.  This is my favorite way to have a pizza by far and Brick&#39;s does it perfectly.  I was in town for about 5 months on and off for work and sadly I didn&#39;t discover this place until late.  However I still managed 3 visits.  

The 1st visit I got 2 pizzas because I couldn&#39;t decide.  I got the BBQ Chicken with smoked gouda and a Margherita.  The BBQ Chicken was everything I dreamed it to be and the Margherita was a slightly different version with the tomatoes and garlic.  Still really good. My 2nd visit I had a Caprese salad which was only 5.00 and an Italian sausage and peppers.  It&#39;s basically a Chicago meets Neapolitan style.  Phenomenal.  On my 3rd trip I tried the Sunny SIde up.  I was feeling adventurous so why not.  It&#39;s a cheese pizza with olive oil, garlic, bacon and green onions with 2 eggs cooked right in the middle of the pizza.  I cannot explain what this did to the pizza but it was great.  I read up on it later and apparently this is a normal thing in Italy and after having it I see why, I&#39;ll be on the look out during my travels in the future for this phenomenal pizza.

The best part about Bricks is of course the great thin crust 12 inch pizzas with perfect charred crust but also the price.  The pizzas are all either 12-13 each.  A complete bargain for these perfect pies.  As I write this review from my moms kitchen, I am contemplating driving 4 hours to the north just to get one."

I tried this place a while back because of Groupon, and I&#39;m glad I did. I love it. The food has always been delicious and the staff has been friendly. 

My only issue, it is a little pricey. Fortunately, it is delicious so while I may grumble when I hand them my credit card - I forget all about it when they put the warm, round, dish of yumminess in front of me."

They have a great selection of appetizers, salads, soups, sandwiches, pizzas, desserts, beer and beverages. Their wood fired pizzas are awesome - delicious thin crust with many options to choose from. We had the artichoke pesto &amp; roasted peppers and very veggie pizza. Both were delicious and had the right amount of sauce and toppings. The dessert menu is quite good. The cannolis were perfect. We loved everything we ate here.

We also used the Yelp offer for free garlic bread and that was delicious! The employees brought the food and then checked on us 2 times during our meal which was very nice. It was clean in there also and reasonably priced for fresh pizza. We were cleaning off the table at the end and they told us not to worry about it and they would get it. Hopefully they open a location closer to Joliet soon! We loved it here.

I always have the caprese sandwich but today I added the crostini appetizer and it was crazy good! Fresh and delicious. Ive had the caprese app before too! The pizza rocks as well.

The wood fire pizza at Bricks is a great option when you&#39;re in the mood for a great tasting pizza.

My favorite is the BBQ Chicken &amp; Smoked Gouda--plenty of BBQ sauce and topped with a good amount of chicken. I&#39;m not sure I would order the White Arugula again. It was topped with too much arugula (see picture) and had a very strong lemon taste. Bricks has a large selection of specialty pizza so there are plenty to choose from. I thought the specialty pizzas were priced a little high for what you get...although they are big enough to share. 

The pizza is cooked in a wood oven so it bakes quickly and is brought to the table in a short time. They offer more than just pizza...sandwiches, salads, soup, and appetizers. Also, wine and draft beer is available. They have indoor seating and a cute little patio on the side of the restaurant. 

Overall--I&#39;ve been pretty happy with the pizzas but I might try a sandwich or salad next time."

We understood that we were going out to dinner on a Friday night and every place would be packed. After looks at the Yelp reviews, we decided to try this place. When you walk in, the menu was very simple to understand and they offered a variety of pizza, salads, and sandwiches. We decided to order two different types of pizzas (the bricks pizza for the adults and a pepperoni for the kids). The pizza came out within 5 minutes. I have to admit I was skeptical because it didn&#39;t take long to cook the pizzas. Once I took a bite of the pizza, my skepticism immediately went away! As I have stated in my previous reviews, the key to a good pizza is the crust and this place definitely get it! The crust was thin, crunchy, and flavorful. The bricks pizza came with Italian sausage, caramelized red onions and mozzarella cheese. The amount of flavor in the pizza toppings was excellent! My son loves pizza and he ate three slices of pepperoni pizza. In addition, we sat on the outdoor patio and they had a musician playing acoustic music that really set the mood.

In the middle of nowhere except for a sea of strip malls, crazy traffic, office complexes and housing developments with catchy names of places so swanky, the pizza made a surprising, authentic statement, and a very tasty one at that. While my friends ordered pizza with BBQ chicken, Gouda, pineapple, traditional sausage and pepperoni, I ordered the margarita and loved it. Wood fired crust is perfect in all the right places for a thin crust that crackles yet is warm &amp; chewy at the same time. Toppings are fresh and top quality. The tomato is fresh and the mozzarella is tops. If I&#39;m out this way, I would certainly stop in again."

While I was at that location, I picked up a menu and discovered there was a Naperville location on Freedom Drive - much closer and convenient for me.

Then...a groupon offer came out.  Sold!

Last night I placed an order to pick up - the groupon was for 2 pizzas.  I also ordered the spinach and artichoke appetizer along with it.  I called it in and they told me it would be ready in 10 minutes.  Yowza...it&#39;ll take me that long plus a few to drive there so I headed out. This was around 6pm on a Friday night.

My order was ready when I got there.  The place was about half full, but a line shortly followed after I walked in.  I was able to park right in front in the &#34;bricks&#34; designated spots.  This area can get pretty crowded parking-wise.

I got my order home... everything was just as good as it was the last time I ate here, only this time I was eating my food at home.  The spinach and artichoke dip was accompanied by bread which was pretty much pizza crust...it&#39;s best to eat that immediately as it hardened a bit as time passed.  My mom got the spinach, and I got the quattro formaggi.  Both, tasty...

My sister loves this place as well, so I&#39;ll probably head back with her again soon."

It was between 3 and 4 stars. Now let me explain, I love pizza, I have it every chance I can get, I make it at home all the time, it&#39;s a true love. With that said, I judge pizza more than &#34;omg cheese and bread and meat, best pizza ever&#34; like some people are. No, there is more that goes into a perfectly crafted pizza. 
Now my experience here was good. I went after work around 5pm on a Wednesday and it was dead, that doesn&#39;t mean anything other than its right after work on a Wednesday...
I ordered 2 pizzas, the white arugula and the bbq chicken, and the club med veggie sandwich. The pizza, not bad. Easy on the toppings, so that it doesn&#39;t overwhelm the overall bite. The white arugula was very flavorful, fresh tasting, and just plain delicious. The bbq was too, good bbq sauce, though I&#39;m not sure if it is just store bought or not, I&#39;m assuming so because it was very sweet, nice amount of red onion and that smoked gouda got it going on. Now here&#39;s where I become a stickler. They were not cooked enough! They were not undercooked and doughy, no but they were not golden brown, there was very little browning on the crust and bottom, and the cheese was just melted. I&#39;m sure 1 minute more would have made it better. Another thing, with wood fired pizza, the dough needs to be light, flaky crust but sturdy enough to not have your toppings fall off when holding a slice to devour. This dough seemed to be tough. My jaw had a workout with every bite. Not sure if this was older dough or overworked, but it was a little disappointing to have to chew, what seemed forever to get down the delicious. The veggie was good. My wife liked it, said she would get it again. 
Pricing is good, menu options are great. I would def try this place out again and hopefully I&#39;ll have a pizza cooked a little bit more and not as tough."

We were starving for pizza but could not decide what the hell to get. Where is the great pizza in Naperville, team? Let a sister know, eh? NYC is a bit far to go on a Friday evening.

Anyway, the hubs and I perused the menu online and decided we were interested enough to order. The pizzas are CHEAP - $11 bucks each - and so we assumed they were teeny tiny and ordered too much food (hashtag story of our LIVES) but we somehow managed. He really wanted the bruschetta, so we ordered the bruschetta, two sunny-side-up pizzas, and a white arugula pizza. Our takeout order was ready in 15 mins and was hot, fresh, and well packaged.

Now being Queen of the Brunch, I enjoy an egg on pretty much anything, breakfast or otherwise - I mean burgers, sandwiches, houseplants - throw an egg on it. Insta delicious! So you can IMAGINE my delight when I learned the Sunny Side Up has TWO eggs cracked RIGHT onto the pizza. YUM. It also has garlic, cheese, BACON, and scallions (ew... But pick-off-able). I love love LOVED the Sunny Side Up. The white arugula was great, too - HUGE slices of prosciutto and mozz all nestled under a bed of fresh arugula tossed lightly  in lemony oil. The pizzas are a decent size - I think you could eat a whole one if you were starving - but our ingredient choices led us to the sad realization that we weren&#39;t going to have leftovers - re-heated eggs and wilted arugula hardly a delicious snack make.


I don&#39;t know what the service is like since we carried out, but the pizza was a refreshing spin on the usual options, and we&#39;ll definitely order again!"

Perhaps I came on an off day, but I ordered a BBQ Chicken pizza and an Artichoke &amp; Roasted Pepper pizza on a Saturday afternoon and when I walked in, it was completely empty. The guy at the register was very friendly and had my pizza ready to go. He asked me if I needed any napkins or pepper flakes, which was great considering most pick-up pizza places in Naperville just want you to take the pizza and go away. 5 stars to the friendly worker!

First thing that hit me was &#34;Wow. These pizzas are over $10?&#34; I guess it must be really good. I ate a slice of the BBQ chicken &amp; gouda... &#34;meh.&#34; For $6, I rather pick up a frozen pizza at Jewel Osco. For $12? No way. The artichoke &amp; roasted pepper pizza was good, though I have a very strong bias towards artichokes. Would I have paid $11 for it? Mmm, probably not. 

Also, I wasn&#39;t the biggest fan of the crust. It was in between a thin and normal crust. It was too bland to be normal, but too thick to be a crispy thin pizza. Or if they were trying to go for the whole &#34;flatbread&#34; thing, it wasn&#39;t dense enough. I wish they could just commit to one or the other, but that&#39;s just me.

Overall, I would suggest getting a Groupon and figuring it out for yourself if you like Bricks or not. Some other Yelpers seem to love it!"

Owner Bill Wilson has done his homework and offers up a very unique experience. My only experience to date, with this style pie, has been on food trucks. Brick&#39;s offers up so much more, It&#39;s a piece of Naples in Naperville.

Our group was treated to what a lunch must be like with a visit to Naples. For a starter, you will flip for the Fresh Tomato Bruschetta, so fresh and scrumptious. Then came the gamut of some incredibly light and delicious pizzas. The Margherita, Pepperoni and Banana Pepper, their Bricks Pizza, Sunnyside Up and perhaps my favorite was the White Arugula. 

I enjoyed the texture, taste and aroma of each pie. The attention to detail was perfect. I don&#39;t think this would be the type of pizza you would want to bring home, as only 90 seconds in the oven and it&#39;s ready to eat. 

Pricing are very reasonable, as their items are of the highest of quality. I am embarrassed it took me nearly 18 months to try this spot out, I&#39;ve had it bookmarked forever.

Plenty of Craft beer and wine. They have some great desserts too, the lemon gelato was the perfect ending to an enjoyable feast. I can see a visit for their soups and sandwiches in my future too. Well done Bill and crew."

The pizza crust is flavorless with a cardboard texture.  The toppings are sparse and cheap.  The good reviews baffle me.  Bricks is located in a busy professional office area, which is obviously plagued by people with expense accounts but no taste buds.

Pizzas are on the small side, so ask before you order to make sure there&#39;s enough for your party.  Wood fired pizzas are generally smaller than those monstrosities that you&#39;re used to getting from your local mom and pop joint.

I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t spend my own money here.  Our office decided to order several pizzas from Bricks to cater lunch.  I heard a few people grumbling that they were still going to go out to get lunch elsewhere."

I certainly don&#39;t feel like I did my homework accordingly for this visit. It was a Saturday night, and the hubby and I decided to go out, rather than stay in. Knowing my love for Pizzeria NEO, Hubs suggested we do that. A quick trip to Groupon told me that another Wood-Fire Grilled pizza joint was nearby with a deal, so we jumped on it. I had previously read reviews and it looked to be positive. I also looked through the menu online, and was looking forward to our meal.

When we pulled up to the restaurant, my stomach lurched. We were ready to sit down for a nice meal with a server and a bottle of wine - not at a fast food joint! This was completely not what I expected. I re-opened the menu online to ensure I wasn&#39;t crazy. But no, the menu didn&#39;t make me feel like this would be a fast-food type atmosphere.

We buckled down and ordered anyways. Bruschetta and the breadsticks, BBQ chicken pizza and the white arugala. The bruschetta was great - I loved the melted provolone cheese on the bread. Breadsticks were good, but wish the marinara wasn&#39;t stone cold. The pizza was the disappointment. The crust was nearly a third of the pizza, so the toppings weren&#39;t plentiful at all. In fact, several slices of the BBQ Chicken pizza were missing chicken!

I was so disappointed with this experience, it&#39;d be hard to return."

I&#39;ve been a fan of Bricks and customer at Lombard for years, then tried their Wheaton location which has a charm all of its own but THEN came Naperville. The most important thing about a multi-location brand is whether or not it&#39;s consistent every where you go and I can honestly say not one location has ever let me down and the atmosphere and layout at Bricks Naperville is simply incredible. For the price you pay for the quality of food and classiness of the store, it simply cannot be beaten.

A must visit! Baja chicken enchilada soup is a must have. Can&#39;t miss with the salads - it just depends on preference but if you&#39;re with a friend, split a pizza and a sandwich so you wont miss out and have to choose!"

First impression: clean and open store. The oven is right there so you can see the fire going before you even order. The menus are digital and very easy to read. I liked how I wasn&#39;t overwhelmed with options, but they do allow you to create your own pizza. 

I decided to go with a plain cheese and my husband got The Big Piluski and a drink. Overall, $25 which is comparable to going to competitors such as Neo or Fiamme. 

I thought the pizza was really good. It took only a few minutes to get to our table (as Neapolitan pizza should due to it&#39;s short cook time). The cheese pizza came with PLENTY of cheese and the crust was fantastic -- chewy yet crispy. It&#39;s important to note I brought half of my pizza home and reheated it the next day and the crust reheated very nicely; it didn&#39;t turn into a rock like some competitor&#39;s. 

I&#39;d say Brick&#39;s is a good option if you don&#39;t feel like dealing with Downtown Naperville parking.  I can say I got a great meal there!"

I thought that given how busy it was and the fact that they are making a pizza, that the food came out pretty quickly.  The pizza was 5-star delicious.  It was a smaller, thin personal size and it really hit the spot.  I could see sharing one with someone and then getting a side salad or soup.  I would also love to see maybe the option of getting 1/2 pizza and 1/2 salad or something - but that may be too complicated.

Overall, a really nice place.  Service was friendly and good and pizza was fantastic.  I would come again, but it would probably be with someone to share with or for dinner."

1. Location-not in downtown Naperville, so not as crowded as other places.
2. Quality and choices (several pre-listed pizzas, but a lot of create your own options) are good.

Well, I was wrong.

This place had a very unique pizza menu, but still enough mainstays for traditionalists.  The pizza is all wood fired, and it comes out fairly fast.

Biggest shock?  The Beer.  Not Great, but they had a few pretty decent beers on tap, and it was much better than I was expecting.

I haven&#39;t been to the other locations but would based on this visit. 

We started with the spinach artichoke dip; I could happily have ordered one of my own and eaten this alone as my meal!

As far as the pizza, the sausage and peppers on another table looked tempting, but we ultimately picked the proscuitto and baby spinach. This was a pretty streamlined pizza, well balanced, and they don&#39;t overload with sauce. (yay!)  While managing to hit the right point in the crisp/chewy matrix, this isn&#39;t a workhorse crust.

This Bricks is not a big place, only a handful of tables in a restaurant dominated by the huge pizza oven. I would still choose to eat in as I feel that the quality of this type of pizza hinges on the texture, which correlates to the immediacy (i.e. don&#39;t let it get cold or soggy).

Overall, if you are looking for something a little more upscale when you&#39;re trying to reach your monthly pepperoni quotient, get fired up at Bricks!"

The register girl asked TY, &#34;Do you go to Central?&#34; And then: &#34;Oh, me too. Are you a sophomore?&#34; TY mumbled his way through the encounter.

&#34;Why didn&#39;t you talk to that girl?&#34; I asked. Hum haw. &#34;She&#39;s not chatting you up to add to her database of local dweebs, ya know. She was sending you the vibe, man.&#34; TY shaking his head: &#34;That&#39;s not the way things work now.&#34; Uh huh. Youth is wasted on the young.

Anywho... The Brick is really good! It&#39;s pizza is super fast (just a few minutes) because the oven is extra hot, and it&#39;s light and tasty. Reminded me of Chipotle - lighter, less greasy Mexican... The Brick is lighter than your usual pizza fare. In any case, it was very tasty. They have regular old sausage or pepperoni pizzas and foo-foo toppings if that&#39;s your deal.

They have Sam Adams on tap. It was a nice, clean, bright atmosphere. I think the place is pretty new. The service as friendly and the owner or manager came over and talked pizza with us for a few minutes.

The ambiance is casual, but the service is still always exceptional, and the food always great. 

Particularly, there&#39;s a young gent who is usually at the register when I am there (I don&#39;t know his name, but he has a fancy mustache) that has always been pleasant and helpful. So, first of all, props to him. 

The menu selection is perfect. Sandwiches, soups, made-to-order pizzas, and beer and wine. I usually order soup and a sandwich, and it always comes quick, hot, fresh, and delicious. Naturally, pizzas will take a little bit longer, but worth the little extra time. I also highly recommend the bruschetta. Prices are fair.

The establishment is clean and comfortable. Great place to go by yourself or with a group. There are a lot of nice restaurants near by, but I prefer the step above fast-casual atmosphere. Not too fancy or expensive, but far exceeds any service/food I&#39;ve experienced at places like Panera Bread.

Actually to be honest, I just had my first bad experience. Must have been because I notice no working manager or someone who would have caught the things I saw this evening.

Well the first experience was good. Friendly staff. If you have questions on the menu they can help you out with anything you need.

2nd experience I was able to meet the owner? or one of the head managers; who was working the oven. He even showed me the oven, gave me the history and such which was awesome. Kind of wished they utilized that oven for more than just sandwiches and pizza though.

3rd experience was just a normal day. Same as the first, friendly staff. They recommended a few Items, yet I forget which ones because they all seem to be good which is a plus.

However this recent visit wasn&#39;t that great. Maybe I was just having a bad day and just was thinking of all the things that went wrong in the place. 

Long story short, When they were toasting one of my sandwiches I noticed the bun (bread) darker than I wanted, or more like being considered burnt and automatically they should have said &#34;hey this is too dark, lets throw it away and start another one.&#34; but it wasn&#39;t the case. They sliced it up, put the fillings and wrapped it up. Also I ordered two sandwiches. Yet only got 1 bag of chips. Other things too but I think those things shouldn&#39;t  publicized."

Short description: Thin crust pizza chain
Pluses: Pizza is solid if you like the style.  They also do sandwiches pretty well too.  I&#39;ve been here around 5 times in the past year, but I never plan to go eat here.
Negatives: Everything is very similar to me, a bit on the salty side of things.
Recommendations: It&#39;s pretty standard stuff for me, I think the Lombard location is better.  I think you&#39;re better off going to Al&#39;s Pizza."

My boyfriend and I were very hungry and wanted something simple in that area that mostly has sit down spots. We were both very hungry and certain pizza would have easily hit the spot. 

The menu said that each pizza serves 1-2 people so, being so hungry, we decided to each get our own. My boyfriend had his with pepperoni, onion, and bell peppers. I had the veggie, plus pepperoni. It was a little over $30 for the 2 pizzas and 2 drinks. I felt the pizzas were large and could feed 2-3 people- I&#39;d have rather had the option for a smaller pizza with a better price....on the other hand, had we liked the pizza, we probably would have been happy to take home leftovers. It was honestly the WORST pizza I have had in so long- and think about it, it&#39;s pretty hard to get a pizza wrong, or at least it&#39;s hard to HATE a pizza. It was GREASY, the cheese was not real mozzarella, it did not melt well and tasted fake. They were extremely skimpy on the vegetables on my boyfriends pizza as well as my own, a veggie pizza. I&#39;m talking slivers. Slivers Of bell pepper maybe equaling one wedge slice. There was a sliver per slice. Oh and extra toppings or build your own toppings are $1.25 each. I know this is hard to believe. We were so hungry and we tried so hard to eat it.  My boyfriend gave up after one slice and I stopped after 2, and then felt sick. Too much grease. It was just plain nasty. We went to Corner Bakery on the way home! 

We did have a funny moment when we both realized that it reminded us of Chuckie Cheese / Showbiz pizza&#39;s pizza in the early 90s and also school cafeteria pizza (yuck). Again, I know this is hard to believe considering the aesthetic and decor of this place- It looks like you&#39;ll be getting a nice pizza, simple and yummy. I&#39;m telling you it&#39;s not what we got and I have had MANY delicious by the slice pizzas in not so good looking storefronts that are 10 times better than what we had here. In fact, frozen grocery store pizza is tastier than this pizza, and frozen is never my first choice. I cannot see how they are getting away with it and I am happy that other reviewers seem to feel the same way, because again, I know it&#39;s hard to believe. 

I WILL say that the staff was friendly and seemed happy to be there. It was a strange experience. 2 stars for nice people and clean environment. Never going back."

I took another yelper&#39;s suggestion and added portabellos to it instead of bacon and it was delicious!!  The second time I had it, I added arugula (dressed like they do for the arugula pizza) and it knocked it out of the park!!  The crust is thin, chewy and crispy.  The cheese is fantastic and the eggs on top make the pizza.  The arugula was the best I&#39;ve ever tasted (and I eat  A LOT of arugula) and went perfectly with the pizza.  It was like a complete meal with the greens on top.  

I think the portions are great, I always have leftovers and it reheats just fine.  For take out they put the arugula in a separate container so you can enjoy them fresh.  Friendly staff, great location, highly recommended."

I knew it wasn&#39;t going to be comparable, but I thought it was going to be better than what I consumed yesterday.  I had watched Steve Dolinsky&#39;s (aka Hungry Hound) &#34;Friday Night Special&#34; segment in which he reviewed this place.  The old saying of &#34;fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me&#34; applies in this instance.  Please see my review of Taste of Cuba Cafe.  I should have known better when it comes to his reviews.  
I walked in and I immediately felt like I was dining at either Chipotle or Noodles and Company.  Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with either of these establishments, however, the quality of food and ambience does not align with Brick&#39;s price structure. I do have to say the restaurant is very clean so kuddos to them.  I&#39;m big on cleanliness!   
My mom and I ordered a side salad and a Margherita pizza.  The pizza consisted of alta cucina tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, garlic, basil and extra virgin olive oil.  I also ordered an additional ingredient of arugula on top.  My dad ordered the Italian Sausage &amp; Peppers pizza, which consisted of their house tomato sauce, mild Italian sausage, onions, red and yellow peppers with their house cheese blend and Parmesan cheese topped with fresh oregano.  Both pizzas were disappointing and so was my salad.  The salad was nothing more than iceberg lettuce with minuscule pieces of cucumbers (probably 2 slices cut up in several pieces to give the illusion of more), 4 cherry tomatoes, 4 little slices of red onions and 5 croutons.  Seriously?  The crust on the pizza was soft, flimsy and flavorless.  Since the restaurant is supposedly a wood burning pizza, I was expecting the crust to be crisp and delicious.  A slice of the Margherita pizza had only two small pieces of mozzarella cheese.  How stingy!  The sauce was nothing special.  My dad&#39;s pizza was a little more flavorful.  I think the sausage is what saved it.  The pizza was not filling whatsoever.  I was hungry a couple of hours later and ended up eating something when I got home.  Two pizzas, one side salad and one beer came out to $34.  As one previous reviewer stated, at those prices you&#39;re better off dining at Lou&#39;s or Giordano&#39;s. 
In closing, I would not dine here again.  There are way better wood burning pizza places around town particularly in Elmwood Park and other parts of the city."

This time around, we put in a take-out order and there was some confusion with the order. I asked for the cheese on the veggie pizza to be well done, but the cashier had heard it as a veggie pizza AND a cheese pizza. When we went to pick up it, instead of arguing with us, they quickly amended the order, put the veggie pizza through the oven again to get the cheese well done. 

They compensated the additional wait time by giving us the cheese pizza and a slice of cake as complimentary. We were totally overwhelmed! They really didn&#39;t need to do that for us. Suspect that the manager was annoyed with the cashier because he was a little abrupt with us. Still, a very nice thing to do and we are very appreciative."

Hearing that there was a location all the way out here in the hinterlands aka the far west burbs made us very happy.  We were even more pleased when we started going here and found the menu to be the same as what we have grown to love at the other spot.  Pizzas are always freshly made and delicious, with a variety of gourmet options, and the sandwiches never disappoint.  Do yourself a favor and try the blue cheese, apple, and chicken salad (forget the name) and the crustini con prosciutto.  It&#39;s a tad pricey for quick serve food, but these days isn&#39;t everything pricey?

It&#39;s the same concept of a Noodles, where you order at the counter, receive a number and the staff brings the food to your table. The staff was extremely friendly and the restaurant was neat and clean. The caprese salad was very good, not huge but two could share the dish.  I would have liked four slices of fresh mozzarella to match the four slices of tomatoes so it could be split evenly. I ordered the white arugula pizza and I was not disappointed with the wood fired pizza.  The crust was a perfect Neapolitan thin and bubbly crust and the prosciutto and arugula were generous. The fresh lemon on the arugula was the perfect balance to the salty prosciutto. I would have given a 5 star rating just based on the pizza alone, but the uneven caprese where not every tomato had a slice of mozzarella brought down the rating.  Besides pizzas, they offer appetizers, salads and sandwiches. I would recommend this place when you crave that thin and bubbly pizza like you find in Naples."

My only complaint was a bit of lacking in the customer service. The workers were polite enough but one was complaining about being short staffed and having to work a long shift. I get it, but the customers don&#39;t need to know.

When this location opened up the whole fast-casual pizza idea was new to me (and pretty new in the burbs in general). Since then, there has been a slew of these type of pizza joints popping up in Chicagoland. To date, I have to say Pie Five is still my fave.

I really appreciate the consistency I receive at Pie Five. I can go in any time knowing I&#39;ll get a pizza that is exactly what I had imagined. They&#39;re like a well-oiled machine over there and service is always great. Toppings are fresh, menu is diverse, and you can add as much as you like to your pizza with the cost staying at $7. Got to love that.

I&#39;m sure you can guess by the name, but these pizzas are ready in five minutes guaranteed. I&#39;ve been to some other places that guarantee a quick turnaround time as well, but have yet to live up to the standard. I really enjoy their pan crust pizza, but the thinner crust and whole wheat option is awesome as well. Their Windy City pizza on the menu is a popular choice, so I&#39;ll either get that or typically I just create my own.

If you like spicy things, I highly suggest their spicy marinara sauce! It&#39;s definitely got a kick to it. When your pizza comes out of the oven, don&#39;t forget to ask for the magic dust on top! I honestly can&#39;t remember what&#39;s all in it, but a lot of cheese for sure. Along with pizza they offer salads and desserts are for an affordable price. The cherry on the top would have to be the fancy coke machine that allows you to make literally any kind of beverage you&#39;d like.

If you&#39;re looking for a fast casual lunch or dinner that won&#39;t break the bank, I&#39;d say Pie Five Pizza is definitely worth your money!"

I ordered the artisan thin crust with spicy marinara. I added chicken and a variety of veggies to the pizza. I was very happy with the taste of the final product. They put the personal pizza in an oven and it bakes completely in only a few minutes. I would suggest topping your pizza with &#34;magic dust&#34;- their unique blend of spices. 

The employee explained their &#34;meal deal&#34; but I passed on that. The &#34;meal deal&#34; allows you to add a drink and a salad for a small price. Pie Five offers more than just a basic pizza. You can choose from four different crusts, salads, and three different sweets.

You pick what you want as you go down the line with them adding it to your pizza, just like subway.  Cost is $7.50 and is enough for a single person for a heavy eater and two for a light eater.  

Pizza was ok.  Nothing award winning, but it is a fast and customized pizza.  Good for a quick lunch when you are squeezed for time on your lunch break."

We were sorely disappointed. Where Blaze has a great hearth to bake the pizzas, this place as a bleh conveyor belt pizza oven. Where Blaze has great crust formed in their presses, this one comes off a pretty basic tortilla press, looking like a - you guessed it - tortilla. Blaze has a great selection of cheeses - the blue cheese is SOOOO good. Just some bland whitish cheese here. And the toppings - sounds good on the menu board, but looks meager and scant on the pizza. The pizza is mostly thin flavorless dough with some sparse dressing. Overall very sad. 

Oh, and most of the tables were unclean, had to look around to find a clean table. Good that we were the only ones in the store. Would hate to come here when there were actual other customers here. 

And the kicker? The price. For the small thin piece of dough that you get, $6.99. 

Do yourself a favor. You came this far. Just go next door to Meatheads and enjoy some real food."

They are made from scratch with fresh ingredients.  For $7, it makes for a great meal (or two).  You can pick the crust, the sauce and the toppings.

I ended up trying two different pizzas from their premade selections because I am more a fan of curation when it comes to pizza.  A little more DJ and a little less spotify if you will.

I attended a Yelp event at the Schaumburg location a few months ago, and I loved the food and concept.  We received coupons for free pizzas, so we went back this weekend.

The pizzas are good, and the build-your-own concept is still impressive with the list of crusts, sauces, cheese, and additional toppings.  The Windy City is my favorite, with Italian beef and giardineira peppers, and I also like the pan style crust.  For $7 it&#39;s a quick and filling meal.

The price certainly isn&#39;t horrible compared to some places, but I would probably be more inclined to spend the same amount, or slightly more, at another fast casual restaurant.

It&#39;s not bad though, and I&#39;d highly recommend it to anyone accompanied by children or picky eaters, or for those days you really want pizza and have no one to share with."

Anyway, I ordered the Windy City, which was thin crust, a garlic/oil base, cheese and gardinera peppers (probably a medium on the heat scale) and pepperoni, as they didn&#39;t have Italian beef.   Store was apologetic and accommodating without my asking as a result.

It was very good and quickly served.   A decent lunch portion.  For dinner, I&#39;d add a salad on the side or get more toppings.

Fresh ingredients and I&#39;ve read a Chipotle comparison in terms of being able to create your own dish, but I only wish Chipotle had the selection of ingredients/options and willingness to put them on/in your creation as Pie Five."

Unfortunately, pie five is no competition. 

The mixture of bland, under baked crust, along with the small selection of toppings made for a less than enjoyable experience. 

The staff seemed impatient, even thought we were the only ones in there, and the pizza just wasn&#39;t good. I&#39;m not sure why this place has a 4 stars considering the taste of the food.

A high quality, value oriented, highly customizable pizza product is featured, but the end result just does not blow me away. The crust is bland and unexciting. Being diabetic, a whole grain crust option is appreciated though I also found it bland and unexciting. The day of my visit a balsamic drizzle finish was available. I don&#39;t see it on the current menu, but if it is available please be aware that I found it a little tangy and tart. The Cezar salad complimented my pizza nicely.

I was pleasantly surprised. Pie Five is pretty much a fast food pizza place. You walk in and place your order at a counter similar to the way you order your sandwich at a Subway, you pick a crust, white or wheat, thin or pan and then pick from about 25 different fresh ingredients. About 5 minutes later your fresh, hot pizza is ready to enjoy. Portion size was perfect and the pizza was good. IMO this place won&#39;t compete with places like Giordano&#39;s or Lou&#39;s but then again you can&#39;t walk into Giordano&#39;s or Lou&#39;s and get a fresh pizza and soft drink in 5 minutes for under $10.

Out the door for twenty bucks for lunch for 2. Pretty good deal especially considering there&#39;s no up charge to load up a pizza with whatever you want. The only knock I have on the place is that when there&#39;s a line the assembly process can slow down a bit, but that&#39;s really a minor complaint considering any place will slow down when they get busy.

They also have lots of unique options like Alfredo sauce (in Chicago, &#34;white pizza&#34; means no sauce at all, as opposed to the &#34;white pizza&#34; I know with Alfredo, which can be hard to find around here...)

Toppings varied in quality. The chicken tasted kind of old and probably didn&#39;t benefit from another run through the oven. Most everything else was pretty good. 

Staff was all kids with varying degrees of alertness. I ordered one of the predetermined pizzas (i.e. they already came up with a roster of ingredients for you); kid puts stuff in the crust and asks, &#34;Do you want anything else?&#34; Well...you didn&#39;t even put everything that is supposed to be on it, so...

Not a lot of seating space and this being Naperville there are wild children everywhere, but we managed to get a seat around a corner in front. The place is hopping, so the secret is out. The place could benefit from a few tweaks, but overall I give Pie 5 a high 5!"

The line wasn&#39;t too bad when we went, most of the other places we have been too are swamped. They have 5 crust choices, which was great. I went with the pan and my wife chose the whole wheat. The cheese selection was a little boring and there was no fresh basil but it seemed like they had similar toppings to the other places we have been. The pizza goes through a conveyor belt oven similar to pizza hut and other big chains. 

We took our pizzas and sat down, a lot of the tables are right by the doors and it was a cold night. Each time the door opened we got a cold blast of air, I wish it was laid out a little better. The pizza was decent, not as flavorful as other places we have been but good. The prices were good and they have a lot of pop options.

What drew me here is that I could put what I want on my pizza, see what was being put on my pizza, and I can track the nutrition (which is pretty cool considering that it&#39;s pizza and not a salad or something).
    The restaurant itself is a nice, clean, small space. The menu is easy to follow. I wish the  first employee I dealt with would have been a bit more friendly-he didn&#39;t really explain to me what toppings go on first or how it all works. I didn&#39;t know what order the toppings were in-there were no labels on the actual ingredients. With this being my first time, I kind of felt like a deer in headlights trying to construct my own pizza (even though I knew what I wanted). 
     The pizza came out in about 5 minutes in the belt and the second employee I dealt with was great-she was all about making sure my pizza was finished the way I wanted it. I definitely didn&#39;t feel rushed. I ate most of the pizza in the car-I wanted to eat it hot. I thought it was delicious-especially for the price. I mean, don&#39;t come here looking for a $6.99 Lou Malnati&#39;s style pizza-but this place definitely holds its own.

Staff members were pretty friendly &amp; the entire process was pretty self explanatory. Even though we went in about 15 mins prior to closing time, we were able to each order personalized pizzas fairly quick.

You&#39;ll read about the &#34;right ingredients&#34;, &#34;fresh&#34; this and that, &#34;fast&#34;,  &#34;no preservatives&#34;, etc. etc.   All true.

The place serves pizza, soft drinks and a couple salads.  The draw is pizza and they don&#39;t disappoint.  It&#39;s $6.99 (6/5/2015) per pizza and you choose the crust (four types), sauce (seven types), cheeses (four types) and any ingredients you&#39;d like from a long list.  They make it Subway-style as you watch and then cook it so it&#39;s ready right after you pay the bill.

The place is small for the crowd they&#39;re drawing and the soft drink area is a choke point.  They were out of root beer, lemonade and Sprite last night.  I informed them right after I paid the bill and after we had finished dinner the problem had not been corrected.  That&#39;s the only ding I can give them, but we paid $2 each for drinks and all ended up drinking something we didn&#39;t want.  The soft drink choke point and last night&#39;s lack of drinks keeps this at 4 stars for me, but its easily 5 stars if they can get that worked out.

I&#39;m a pizza lover and Pie Five just nudged Malnati&#39;s from my #2 spot.  I will still hold Due&#39;s as my personal favorite but Due&#39;s is an hour drive and my daughter doesn&#39;t like it so Pie Five has become our new favorite.

You can choose to pick one that already has a list of toppings or you can build your own. I choose to build my own with a wheat crust and a spicy sauce. I put chicken, ham and almost all the veggies available. I had my pizza cooked well done just the way I like it. I have to say it was really good and filling.

They also have the new coke machines which I love cause I get to have my vanilla coke zero. I will definitely be back to try some other pizzas. I also think it is reasonably priced for the portion size that you get."

I love the concept of this place and I think this is a chain that will eventually be as common as Chipotle or Subway.  Here&#39;s the basics.... the pizza is $6.99 and you can customize it anyway you want, there is no upcharge for additional toppings, it&#39;s one price for one pizza.  They have multiple crusts, multiple sauces and a huge variety of toppings to choose from.  Once you tell them what you want, they put it in the oven for 2 minutes, yes only 2 minutes and out comes your pizza.  I wasn&#39;t sure how good a $7, 2 minute pizza would be, but it is awesome!  The pizza came out cooked to perfection and I&#39;m looking forward to my next customized creation.  Bonus points.. they have a Coke Freestyle machine (coke machine with the touchscreen and thousands of combinations).  I will definitely be back, I think this place is going to be very popular."

The workers were rude, not friendly at all. I took a few extra minutes deciding because it was my first time there, nobody behind me either but that seemed to inconvenience them. Once we say down my husband said to me &#34;man, he was rude wasn&#39;t he?&#34; So it wasn&#39;t just me being particular because he never notices those things. Like I said, great concept but eh.

I don&#39;t know who came up with this concept but it works. And you can&#39;t beat the price. Most places charge about  $1 per topping and you get all the toppings you want for 1 price. Spent less than $10 with a bottle of water. Only complaint is they need to turn down the AC a bit. Had to order jalapeños and get a seat by the window just to warm up a bit. Other than that great place. But take a jacket.

I have been to them all over the west coast, Las Vegas, and in Denver. Any time I hear of a new chain following this model, I have to try it. My first visit, I went with my standard, pepperoni and bacon thin crust. BOMB! I also noticed this place offers a pan crust as well which is something I haven&#39;t seen at any other chain before. Naturally, I had to go back the very next day to try it. Believe did not disappoint. Same thing pepperoni and bacon, this time with the pan crust. Again, it was crazy good. Pie Five Pizza Co. has elevated the bar for this newer type of pizza restaurant and I&#39;m not mad one bit. I will be back, and will try my hardest to get something new. However, that pepperoni and bacon was just so darn good it&#39;ll be hard to do."

When we arrived, there was a line to the door, the place was woefully understaffed, and neither of the two people working were in much of a hurry to move the line along. During our order, there were a number of toppings unavailable because they had not properly prepped before opening less than an hour before we arrived. After waiting for about 20 minutes to order and have the pizza cook, we finally had our food. 

When we went to get beverages, none of the specialty teas were available. The staff had not restocked the lids, straws, and utensils; leaving patrons to go through their cupboards to find what they needed. We asked for some tea, and the apathetic girl working the register said they might make some in the next hour. The dining room was a disaster with tables not being cleaned off, and the floor had clearly not been swept from the night before. The experience with the staff was terrible (I&#39;d fire every one of them if I owned this place).

From a food perspective, we ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza on their classic pan crust, and the Buffalo Chicken Pizza on the artisan thin crust. Both pizzas were lacking in the specialty sauce used, there was way too much cheese on both, and I had to hunt to find chicken on either pizza. Both crusts were partially burnt, and had an unpleasant taste as a result.

Overall, if you&#39;re looking for a pizza place with this type of atmosphere, head over to Bricks Pizza on Freedom Drive. We definitely will not be back to Pie Five after such a terrible initial experience."

I told my husband we should go on opening day. On Facebook I saw advertisement to go before the opening, so I signed up for a thurday at a specific time. Then I got a confirmation email that my reservation was confirmed...the email had no other information such as date and time. We show up on Thursday my family is not on the list..I have to go through my emails on my phone I showed them the email that has no info besides your reservation was confirmed. The women at the desk said I am not sure what this but today is a yelp event. You can talk to the pie 5 person over there. By this point my two year old and 5 year old are getting antsy. I go over to the person who is either a manager or owner he says that event was  on Tuesday and Wednesday. This is a private event for yelpers here is one free coupon for when we open and then went back to talking to other people. I work late on Tuesdays and Wednesdays so I would not have signed up for Tuesday or Wednesday. So here&#39;s the thing if the email had the date I reserved then we could tell which one us had it wrong.  I may have been wrong on the date who knows. What I do know is I drove out there excited and then I had to find another plan for dinner for the kids. If I didn&#39;t have the kids with me this coupon may have been acceptable but seriously you could just said you guys can order. No rather I had to get the kids back in the car and find something else.So I decide today to become a yelp reviewer (my first review) and wanted to let you know your customer service have turned me off. I will not be back."

A lot of options to choose from which can be a good thing or a bad thing. I tend to get the regular crust with marinara and will change up my toppings here and there. The dessert brownies are okay. I know this place could be crowded like the first time I went, but I have gone back and you could shoot a cannon in there and not hit anyone. If you know what you want, it will be painless to go through the motions of ordering your pizza. If you don&#39;t know what you want, please figure it out before you stand at the glass staring at all the toppings. People are behind you and are hungry too and probably know what they want. 
I would give this place 4 stars, but for the cramped quarters they are in and the choke point near the Coke Freestyle machine, they get only 3 stars. It bugs me when people go to the Coke Freestyle machine at any place and they have to see all the options before they pick what they want. A couple of times, I have asked to jump ahead because I know what I want.
I will go back if I am in the mood for a quick pizza, but with the construction I have to go through to get there, I would much rather wait."

We decided to call ahead and Frank answered the phone with a jolly tone.  We ordered our &#39;go to&#39; pad thai and panang curry and were quickly assured that it was a great choice because everything was made fresh in house.  Accepting that as a dare to test their quality, we asked for their favorites and ordered a summer wrap, crab Rangoon and Curry Puffs.

These were the best rangoons that I&#39;ve EVER had!  The curry puffs reminded me of a veggie filled samosa mmmmmm, and the summer roll was fresh and crisp making me feel better about the fried goodness I just enhaled.  Since i filled up on appitizers, I tasted the pad thai which was sweet and yummy and the beau made two bowls of the chicken panang curry which he said had the right amount of peppers, peas and heat.

Can&#39;t wait to go back and try some more yummies on the menu!"

&#34;When I first opened [the food container], I felt a little regret&#34;
&#34;Pad thai tastes like spaghetti. Which is fine, if you want spaghetti, I guess&#34;
&#34;Yeah I&#39;m on the spaghetti train&#34;
&#34;This is hard to eat&#34;
(ten seconds later) &#34;This is very hard to eat&#34;

We all got variations of pad thai, which ended up being a glob of rice noodles covered in unappetizing, inauthentic sauce and stuck together like gelatin. For the love of god, do not go here if you&#39;ve ever eaten real Thai food before. Or if you&#39;ve eaten any food at all in the past week. The only reason you should go is 1) you want to see how poorly Thai food can be made, 2) you hate yourself, 3) you want to passively shake off an unwanted date, or 4) you&#39;re from an abusive home and they starved you and you&#39;d finally escaped and this Thai place is the first place you find.

This place is getting two stars because we haven&#39;t yet gotten food poisoning. Will update review if status changes."

We didn&#39;t rush in days after they opened their doors...we waited a respectable few months for any kinks to be worked out.  It was so worth the wait!

Our plans to go out for dinner were thwarted by heavy rains and flash flood warnings so we decided to stay close to home and it was between pizza and Thai.  The fact that Bree is &#34;carry-out only&#34; works for us.  I couldn&#39;t find a website for them other than what appears on Yelp and Facebook (props to the Yelper who posted pictures of their menu here - super helpful friend!!) but we browsed their offerings and landed on several items to try.  

We started with Egg Rolls, Miso Soup, Pot Stickers and Chicago Summer Rolls....all were fresh and delicious and generous in size for the price.  Our entrees were Thai Southern Fried Rice, Chicken Basil and Pad Broccoli with Beef.  Everything we had was outstanding but I have to say the Thai Southern Fried Rice was exceptional!  I&#39;ve never had that dish before and it is the stuff that dreams are made of.  Fluffy, perfectly seasoned rice with crispy, lightly fried, tender chicken on top of it.  

The gentleman I spoke to when I placed our order was super friendly and professional and my husband enjoyed talking with him when he picked it up.  We enjoyed the food so much, he called him back to tell him so.  We will be telling all our friends and neighbors about Bree Thai in Lemont...and we know many people in the area of their other location near Midway airport so we will be sure to tell them too!!"

When I saw that Bree Thai was in Lemont, I knew that I had to make a special trip to try it out. We had just missed ordering the lunch specials (they end at 2:30pm), so we ordered a beef panang curry to split. I feel that if you want to properly rate a thai restaurant, you definitely need to try the curry. 

I was so happy that this curry was good. They give you tons of curry and a decent amount of meat and veggies in the portion. I thought the curry had a good flavor to it and had a nice amount of spice to it. I also really enjoyed the vinegar/pepper tasting sauce they gave on the side. It gave a nice flavor contrast to the sweet coconut of the curry. I think that the curry could have been thickened up just a bit, it was more on the watery side. The side of rice they give with the curry was also a good portion-I didn&#39;t feel as if I needed to order extra.

The inside of this place is bare bones. This is strictly a take-out location only (hence the Express...). There are a couple of chairs on the inside to wait for your order. While we waited, the woman at the counter gave us some samples of a mango juice. I thought that was very thoughtful of her, especially since it was so hot outside. The juice was tasty and had a lot of chunks of fruit in it. 

I think for the price, everything you get is great. I will definitely return to try more things on the menu-and I will definitely try a lunch special. Side note: don&#39;t follow the directions from the Yelp map-you will end up in a subdivision. The restaurant is in the little strip mall area off of Walker where the liquor store, pizza place, and 4 penguins gelato are. There is no sign for the restaurant yet, so it is easy to miss!"

I was waiting for this place to open up and couldn&#39;t wait to try it.  I just had the opportunity to place my first order today and I am so glad it didn&#39;t disappoint. 

Ordered the Pad Thai, Pad Si-ew and the Pad Ginger.  All dishes were very good. I had the lunch order so it came with Miso Soup and a Pot Sticker.  Both were very good as well.  Fresh ingredients, great Flavors and ample serving size for lunch portions.  Menu is fairly extensive including spring rolls, summer rolls, steamed mussels, squid salad and plenty of curries.  

Looking forward to trying more of the menu.  

It&#39;s carry out and delivery only but have a nicely decorated waiting area with some seating.  Lady at the counter was very friendly and the order was on-time.

We stopped by here and it was pretty great! Nothing too fancy - casual self order and self seating. Not a huge menu, but the selections were decent. I really love their salsa bar, around 20 salsas to choose from. I ended up taking home 5 salsa cups because every one I chose was so good.

They give you warm, seasoned tortilla chips while you wait for your food. Definitely some of the best tortilla chips I&#39;ve ever had.

We ordered a torta and tacos which were both very delicious. The tortas are huge, we could&#39;ve just ordered that and been fine. Glad we got to try both.

Finally, for all the food we got - the pricing was pretty cheap! Friendly service too, so that&#39;s a plus."

This was my first time here and I was I was very impressed. Service was fast and friendly. I got mine to go and the guy at register gave me three cups for the salsa bar. I got the three taco special with rice and beans. Picked up my three salsas and they were all very flavorful.
The steak taco was very good and they season their beef very well. The pork tacos were very good and they are some of my favorites that I have had to date. 

Only con was that a few bites of rice were a little crispy. Which happens. 

Would I return? Yes, most definitely. Delicious!"

I got the chorizo tacos and hubby got the chorizo burrito. It came out hot and soooo tasty this is my to go meat!
They serve you tortilla chips in the dinning area and help yourself to their salsa bar, seriously so many choices freshly made. 
They have fountain drinks self serve so free refill!
The guacamole is creamy and fresh, the small size can serve 1-2 when people. I like that their plates and utensils are REAL none of those paper and plastic crap.

My friends and I come here all the time, especially after leaving the library. After spending 5 hours studying, all I want to do is eat tacos. Unlike the staffs at Los Burritos Tapatios who are RUDE, the staffs at this place are extremely friendly. I came here more than 10 times and every time, same workers. This place has complementary chips and salsa, which is really nice of them. The best part about this place has to be the salsa bar. Unlimited salsas of different kind and toppings. 

This place opens really late, which is perfect for me since I love midnight food run. The tacos are delicious, especially the steak and the al pastor. The burritos are HUGE!! The first time I came to this place, I made a mistake of ordering a burrito(large size). I managed to finish half of it and had to take the other half to go. Yesterday I came back and instead of getting the tacos/burrito like I always do. I got myself a quesadilla. It was alright, but I would not recommend it since the cheese was overkill.

Best thing about this place: the widest arrange of salsa you can find around here. The tortilla chips were already seasoned but the salsa was so on point. We tried about 4 or 5 different types and from the mildest to the spiciest, they were all bomb. As for the burrito, the size was impressive. Like, this thing is huge!! But the the meat I got at least, seemed to be pretty dry so I constantly felt the need to add salsa and pickled onions to spice up the dish. Overall, pretty nice place to eat. It was a near full house when we started eating and honestly, from the service to the food, I understand why this place is so popping. I&#39;m just sad about the dry meat. Otherwise would easily give them a 4~5 stars.

Order:
pastor/ chicken burrito
Tortilla chips (lots of it)"

Both steak burritos had dry bland red steak in them(how dry when still red idk) They need the salsa bar because food had no flavor. And when told them the meat didn&#39;t seem cooked all way through was told that&#39;s the way it is supposed to be. Wife ate half and I powered through and ate most.

Anyways, besides that, their food is pretty good. I&#39;ve had tacos and burritos, but every time I&#39;ve gone I&#39;ve wanted an entree that they are out of. What are the odds?? 

You order, you sit, they bring your food. Pretty easy concept. Their salsa bar is outstanding. If you know me, you know that I love hot stuff and most of these salsas are right up my alley. You get chips when you sit and you can go up and get as many salsas as your little heart desires.

Both the chicken and the steak were VERY dry. They also arrived fairly quickly (before our chips were served, which were stale). 

Theses meats were definitely batch cooked ahead of time and reheated just before serving them.

My husband had the three chicken taco special with rice and beans. We ordered the large guacamole with chips. Everything was so good!  There is an extensive salsa bar to add some heat to your dish as most of the many salsas are spicy. There are only a couple that are labeled mild. Their guacamole is outstanding. We couldn&#39;t finish it all, so sweet Elva packed it in ice for us and gave us extra chips since we weren&#39;t going home after lunch.

I love this place. I&#39;ve eaten tacos here probably 100 times now, i&#39;ve tried most of the meats, and i&#39;ve tried the burritos and enchiladas too. My meat preference here definitely leans towards chicken and al pastor. But, that&#39;s not to say that the other meats aren&#39;t good, just not as good to me. If you dine in, they provide some chips and you can get some salsa from the salsa bar. The salsa bar is what really puts this place above others in the area in my opinion. You have a great variety of salsas that you can choose from depending on the style and heat that you prefer. The service is good here, the food is great, the prices are good, the decor is typical. They also sell beer and have a patio in the summer. This place is the top taco joint in the area in my opinion.

It was around 10:30 on a Tuesday night &amp; we were hungry after a few games of bowling so we decided to stop. The employees were friendly &amp; greeted us as soon as we walked in. Looking around, I noticed the decor could use a little update... after ordering, I quickly went to the ladies room (must&#39;ve been all that beer!) . . .  anyway, the ladies room needs quite the update as well. It was clean, but there is plaster on the walls and the door didn&#39;t lock. So, there is where the three stars comes from.. 

Moving on to why I really wanna give four stars, the food. 

I ordered Arracherra huarches  (half order) &amp; an Al pastor taco. Man oh man. Both were tender, full of flavor and absolutely delicious! The salsa bar was pretty good too. I did not venture out and try the very hot ones, but the few I had were packed full of flavor and delicious.

I tend to only drop by while Elvia is on the job. She is the star here in my opinion. If I often came when Elvia wasn&#39;t here then I&#39;d like remove a star or even two. Elvia has been here for at least the last 12 years since I started dining here and we have a great rapport but she treats every customer like family. 

The food is always made fresh to order and special requests are welcomed. Once I brought my mother here during lent and they put together a veggie enchilada dinner plate that she raved about for weeks. True customer focus here. I always get tacos al pastor and ask for extra cilantro. You order at the counter and they bring it out to your table within minutes. I love that first bite of the taco when the meat and pineapple are hot and the onions are cold. A flavor and sensation overload. 

When you dine in you get unlimited chips and free salsa and free refills on your Pepsi soft drinks. Great salsas from a mild chunky tomato based style to an ultra hot every pepper in the book mix that makes most of my body burn. It&#39;s all good. 

I once had an al pastor burrito but as the meat is marinated the burrito seemed a bit soggy. A bad choice on my part. Think about what meat or veggie you want and then weather it would go best on a taco or in a burrito. 

This is a very old Long John Silvers location and I was devastated 15 years ago when it closed but truly love Taco Grill and I couldn&#39;t be happier. Sadly the interior still needs some work and the space where the old Long John Silvers ordering queue wall was at and ripped out is clearly visible and chairs often get stuck in the hole. This would cause a star reduction at most restaurants but we know this is a cheap and low profit local taco place so I let that slide and focus on the food and service.

First of all, the tortas are amazing.  The bread is the perfect bread.  That totally makes the torta.

Back up though, this place has great workers.  The woman who clean the tables and also takes care of seating on busy days is very sweet and works so hard.  I&#39;ve been here on a Friday at 12pm with no available seats.  She told us to wait 5 minutes and had us seated in 3.  By the time we had ordered, we were sitting down, and had chips to munch on.  The food came out and we were in and out in 30 minutes.  

The salsa bar is a great touch.  You have the chance of trying way too spicy salsas that will burn your tongue and make you sweat.  But they are so tasty.  

The pepsi (&#34;is pepsi ok?&#34;) in the fountain machine is made with sugar, so that&#39;s kinda cool.  They have horchata, jamaica and tamarind in the front as well.

The tamales are homemade and this is evident from their wacky shape.  But they are delicious!

The lady working there told me that the color can vary a bit depending on the Habanero&#39;s.

I am used to very hot sauces, so none of these were too hot for me, but they were satisfying.

So, here&#39;s the deal (the cashier was awesome reworking things for me as I continued to ramp up my order... (some of you may construe this to mean losing control.. you say potato...) .. in the final analysis:

$10.50 plus tax. I had: diet Pepsi, chips and salsa&#39;s, rice and beans and three really good tacos.

I opted for the three different tacos, all with onions and cilantro; carbon, chicken and chorizo. I really liked them all.. but I was missing some carnitas. Next time its the chicken, carbon and the carnita&#39;s. I liked the chorizo.... just not as much as the other ones. The carbon and chicken rock and I&#39;m anxious for the Pastor and carnitas. They marinate their meats for extended periods.

It&#39;s been a few years since I&#39;ve been here and I&#39;m glad that I made the trip back.

Mentioned to Lisa that i stopped there and got a &#34;what about me? look. (I didn&#39;t even try a XXX joke out on her... just promised future great food)

It&#39;s not new, it&#39;s not fancy.. it&#39;s just really good. Friiendly service when I asked questions."

This review is of our experience on a Taco Tuesday. Right as you walk in, you&#39;re greeted with a friendly staff. The menu is extensive, a lot to choose from. I went with the lengua and al pastor tacos, cilantro y onions, with a side of rice and chicken tamale.

The tacos came out in less than 2min. I went to fill up my cup and pow! They were there. Tasty across the board. The chicken tamale meat was a bit dryer than I like but still good flavor and texture. The tacos were spot on. Nothing spectacular but definitely satisfying. Did I mention the SALSA bar? So many salsa varieties to choose from, did you know there were so many? Definitely eat in for the seasoned chips and salsa. Don&#39;t forget to tip. The employees deserve it.

Can&#39;t wait to try more and to have a cerveza on the patio!

Smile when you order!"

Over all....tacos were dry, burrito had very little flavor other than sour cream. Cashier seemed bothered when I came in.

You REALLY need to dine in to experience the salsa bar 12-15 fresh salsa&#39;s with an amazing array of flavors from light citrus/lime to a heavily smoked ancho. The taco trio is excellent and served with Pico de Gallo and guacamole. Carne Asada is served on a big sizzling platter with pico, guac, cactus and beans. I had it cooked medium rare and was tendor and very well seasoned. You can&#39;t come close to finishing the burrito grande. The quesodilla&#39;s are also served with pico and guac, you get 3 large pieces and will have trouble finishing these as well. Their chorizo and tongue are both excellent, give them a try. 
It&#39;s usually  crowded from 11:45 to 1 pm, so if you want to get a good table and enjoy the salsa bar you may want to get there early or go late."

Walked in hoping for some good tacos. 1st impression, &#34;Nice! its super packed, food must be amazing&#34; &#34;ohh cool patio&#34;

Lady taking orders had a sign on her forehead that said. &#34;Eff off&#34; 

Ordered a steak and Chicken taco...$2.40/taco
Not bad, but that cheap...I should have known better. But I was there, I was hungry...

They have a cool salsa table that has 12 different kinds of salsas. Each marked with an X based on their level of hottness! King of bad decisions that I am...I obviously choose the two that were XX rated and looked the most dangerous.

I sit to eat, the salsa does not disappoint. The X&#39;s are no joke or exaggerations....they will hurt you and your feelings at the same time.

All in all its all about the tacos. Chicken was dry with hardly any taste, the skirt steak seemed promosing except the meat was D grade to say the least. It was more little pcs of the fat more than the actual meat. I was spitting out the chewy meat every other bite. 

Probably wouldnt go back again. 

This was a 2 star review until one of the nicer lady there brought me a glass of water without asking for it... after seeing the effects of the XX rated devil&#39;s salsa."

The salsa bar is delicious and plentiful (includes limes and a variety of hot salsas). The tortilla chips are probably the best I&#39;ve ever had. Most importantly the food is fresh and not heavy/oily at all. The two times I went I got the veggie enchiladas and they were filled with fresh veggies, not just cheese and oil like at some other places. My one complaint is that the chef was heavy handed with the enchilada sauce. Not a huge deal obviously, as I can scrape it off or mop it up with tortilla chips or rice.

Food was good and so was the service. They were very accommodating considering we showed up close to closing. Price wax phenomenal.  At 2.95 a taco the meat was more than filing the taco. I had the steak taco which was actual steak with fresh onions and cilantro and my sister had the pros with onions pineapple and cilantro.  My sister didn&#39;t have enough pineapple so she asked for more and they were very accommodating. The plantain dessert was more than  enough to share between two people.

This place is a total hole in the wall and wasn&#39;t overly busy when we got there. We walked in, ordered 6 tacos and two drinks, chips and salsa are free, and ended up spending just under $20. 

The el pastor tacos were excellent! Top 3 favorites I&#39;ve had. They put a lot of meat on the taco, I could barely close it, cilantro, onion and pineapple. The combo was perfect. Great meat flavor, and pineapple was not over done. 

The salsa was good as well, I got the mild salsa but it was actually pretty spicy for me. Also, I thought the service was great. Everyone was very kind and welcoming.

Each table has a paper-lined bucket with fresh, warm chips. There is already a tiny hint of spice on them, but I tried both of the &#34;mild&#34; salsas, the first a tasty, fresh, red tomato salsa and the second a green tomatillo salsa with a hint of heat.  The salsa bar had a spread of 18 different salsas, and the hotter ones have a rating as to their potency.  Stacks and stacks of the 1.5 ounce sauce cups are available. Once you finish one cup of salsa (and you will), simply get up and get a second, and a third, maybe a fourth!!  My host explained that the sauces are made fresh each morning, and after the first bite, it was obvious that they were not from any jar or jug.  We split the Ham and Cheese Tortas which was made with the best bread I have had in a long time. Crisp exterior, but not so much so that it crumbles when you look at it, and a soft but not mushy interior. Spot on!!!  (I wish hamburger places would take a lesson in getting a bread that can be both substantial yet yielding, because the Taco Grill has it perfected!) And of course I washed it down with Jarritos de limon (lime soda) one of my favorites. I&#39;ll definitely be back. And I might even venture forth, throw caution to the wind, and try a touch of sauce rated at &#34;2 stars&#34; of heat! Outdoor dining is available."

Decent meheecano plates taking you into flame-grilled paradise. Al pastor is what you need.


Did I say salsa? Holy guacamole! They got salsa, picante, peppers, jalapeños, onionos, and burning holios. Double burning, yo!!!

There are so many salsa&#39;s that you&#39;ll need a month to try each one.

As a man with an appetite equivalent to a Persian Army, I look out for local pig out spots. The one that catches the eye is located parallel to one of the busiest local roads; On West Ogden, a little shack with with neon signs all over. The contrasting colors make it seem like a ten year old went mad with a couple of Sharpie highlighters. The yellow colored body of the shack seems the most outstanding of all, it seems as if I were a fly, tranced by the glowing light, and heading straight towards, what seemed to me was, eden. One step inside this cosy establishment and all seems well in the world. Two steps forward and unintentionally you are standing in the order line. Flustered with this new found love, you think for a second and step back because taking the ambiance in is the best part of all. Siblings working behind the counter, both helping one another, making a duo that would never fail. A small table filled with countless plastic forks, spoons, and knives, along with a hefty amount of condiments. The man behind the counter asks again, &#34;Are you ready to order&#34;, and there you are, left stranded in the midst of all the homeyness, with one of the hardest questions to answer. A simple &#34;yes&#34; declares you part of a family business that takes care of you and makes sure you are well fed.
Nothing over ten dollars- except if you wish to add on. As I am seated I here my order, the speed means something isn&#39;t right, right? Wrong. As soon as you dig your thirty-two teeth into the finest of flour tortillas, your mind is lost, your taste buds wonder what flavor has just passed through these judgmental walls. The steak taco; succulent, juicy steak mixed with the finest of assorted vegetables with just a hint of pico de gallo. Along with this masterpiece, I ordered the enchiladas uizas. The thought of green food may not sound appealing, but who really cares if your mouth, your heart, and your stomach asks for more. While eating this boheimath, one does not realize how much he is taking in because in all fairness, every bit of the food was worth it.
It takes will, skill, and a whole lot of endurance to start a business, but the fine architects of food at Taco Grill sure know how to run one. The place is never empty, so you know that there are people that go out of there way to get something good to munch on- no wonder they are open till twelve at night. The experience alone makes one want to come back and enjoy stepping into someone&#39;s home, except these guys charge for food. I am nowhere near Latino, but after being exposed to such a radical, I felt at home. And that is what an establishment should make you feel, to get out of the house, yet be comforted by being similar to a home."

One of the best mexican restaurants in the burbs. Not at all greasy but still satisfying drunk food. I usually get the chicken torta and he has tasted his way across the menu. Their salsa bar is legit and their large burrito is enough to fill a grown man twice over. Reasonably priced too.  We are usually full after spending $17. They are also open very late for that area.

The food is STILL VERY SOLID.  I&#39;ve been back 3 times within the last week or so and service was ....... hit or miss. 

My first trip was to use a Daily Deal but the problem was simple. They ran out of chicken. The delay was over an hour so I could have returned later. That day, time didn&#39;t permit me to do so. It happens from time to time so I didn&#39;t make a big fuss about it. I&#39;ve worked in a restaurant and those things go in phases. Some days, you get a rush on certain items. This appears to be one of those days. 

Trip #2. I ordered 2 chicken dinner w/ bean, rice, chips &amp; salsa. Food was prepared in about  5 minutes or so. The time was what I expected. The problem was I didn&#39;t get my chips with my meal. Now to be fair, the print was fairly small and may not have seen the deal included chips. But by the same token, you&#39;re seeing these thing come in so I&#39;m curious how that could have been missed? Food was still solid and I understand mistakes will happen sometimes. 

Trip #3 was today. Greeting was polite. I handed the gentleman my Daily Deal and my order was taken. Now here&#39;s where things get a little weird. I explained the deal includes salsa. I&#39;m aware of where the salsa bar was. I also informed him that the meal I got 2 days ago didn&#39;t have chips. He told his crew and I got the ones I should have received days prior. The order came up fast. Please refer to 2 of my pictures. One contains the chips and one was all the salsa I was permitted to take. I was hoping that I would be a bigger container for salsa. While others were given bigger tubs, I was given two smaller containers (a total of 6).

 I asked the lone server lady (who is right now, the main reason I&#39;m keeping this a possible 4 stars) for a bigger container. She told me to ask the counter people. I have no problem with that as she was the primary server during lunch. So I asked one of the guys (guy with a tattoo on his neck) at the counter (one of the cooks who was setting order for service). His response (in a VERY RUDE tone)- &#34;I&#39;M BUSY!! GO ASK THEM&#34; (the folks at the register)!!! 5 minutes prior, I watched him give the server lady a tub for her customers. I asked the two people if I could have a bigger tub. I got two more smaller containers. 

I got a total of 6 small containers to stretch between 2 chicken dinners w/ rice, beans and chips. Each of them were about an ounce. You would figure that a place with a salsa bar you would want them to have enough salsa for the meal. Not even close!!! I&#39;m 50-50 about returning based on the last 2 visits. The nice thing is that when I realized that I forgot my chips, I returned and they had put them away. By the way, the lone server lady is FANTASTIC!!! If you dine in curing lunch, tip her well. She&#39;s normally the one person taking orders. She does a heck of a job keeping up. Everyone else, you have some work to do. At this point in time, no longer a Mountain King."

I believe the ower was taking my order, it was an older Mexican gentlemen kind of short and thin.  I walked in as he was getting off the phone.  No smile, nothing just what would you like?  I placed my order, he told me the amount and kind of shoved the paper at me to sign. I looked up at him in surprise and he was already asking the person behind me what they were ordering.  I couldn&#39;t believe how cold he was.  When my order done the person bagging the food pointed at me and handed me the bag. I looked at him and asked if this was for me since they didn&#39;t call out number.  He handed me the bag and gave me his back and walked away.  I was so ready to get out of there that my mistake I didn&#39;t make sure my order was correct.  By the time I got home and opened the bag we had four tacos missing.  I had placed a total of eight tacos, luckily only charged for four.  The tacos that we did get were TERRIBLE!  The steaks had so much fat and the meat was cold!!! No way they could get cold in the three minute drive home.  I&#39;m done with this place! There are other taco places with better food and service."

I took at burrito to go.  It was really grande, more than I needed.  The salsa bar is kind of nice, but they seems to be salsa nazi&#39;s.  They have the cups out there, but they keep the little lids behind the counter.  If you ask for some lids, they&#39;ll give you like 2.  I had to ask like 2-3 times to get 4 different salsas.  Hey... if you have 9 salsas, you gotta let people try them out.   So that was really frustrating.  A couple of them were good, but my Brother told me I didn&#39;t get the best one.  Well guess what, it would&#39;ve been the one I got next.

The burrito itself was good.  The grilled veggies were nice and flavorful.  Better than most places.  I think the other toppings were a little sparse.  Like could&#39;ve used some more beans, cheese, etc.  I paid extra for avocado, but again it seemed like the whole burrito was filled with the grilled veggies.

I guess if you eat there you&#39;re much better off.  For one, they can&#39;t curb your salsa and I guess you also get chips to go with it.

Next time

- Ask for less grilled veggies and more of everything else
- Eat there instead of taking out"

We were here last night to use my expired Groupons - TWO $7.50 groupons

I got the Al Pastor Taco ($2.50?) Which is really good.

I also got the huaraches (half order $7.50) and was so tender and had great flavor.

However, my bf ordered their &#34;special&#34; Carne Asada $10... Basically it&#39;s a grilled rib eye steak skillet.... The meat had great flavor but unbelievably tough to eat.

We ordered 1 beer and 1 horchata... We spent $12 more aside from paying with groupon which is $15... 

A bit pricey right? Pricey because the Asada was so tough :/

We were not so pleased, so we ordered the Fried Banana...  Thinking that the dessert might increase the chance of us coming back here...

For $5.... Definitely NOT worth it.... They split a banana in half, fried it, then drizzled with chocolate syrup, cinnamon sugar, with whip cream... $5... Never again.... 

I could&#39;ve gotten so much more if I went to Oberweis or Baskin Robbins... Seriously not worth it....

Good thing I paid partially with my groupons coz definitely my nearby Los Tapatios is waaay waaaay better in taste, food portion and price point."

The restaurant is counter service (a la Noodles), and they have a number of good options. I opted for the Torta al Pastor and my friend ordered chicken enchiladas. 

After ordering, we perused their myriad salsa options and tried a hot and a mild. The hot we had was not messing around. So do be aware that they mean business. 

My friend&#39;s food came out pretty quickly. We were concerned when mine didn&#39;t show, but the lady working the front of house noticed I was without food and looked into it. They were making the pastor fresh. That gets my happy face. 

The good was delicious. I&#39;ve never had a torta that wasn&#39;t circular before. This thing was a big sub length. The bread was incredible and the meat was so worth waiting for. I could&#39;ve easily split it with someone, and sadly had some left over.

I miss the Lombard version of this, which was a bit bigger, cleaner, nicer and had waiter service. But if you want some delicious taqueria-style tacos, you can&#39;t go wrong here.

We came in around noon on a Saturday and the place was jumping. I ordered 3 carnitas tacos and they were ready before I was done picking a table, no joke. I didn&#39;t realize at first that the guy standing there with a plate of tacos was waiting for me. The husband got nachos with steak, and our friend also got carnitas tacos.

The tacos were on fresh corn tortillas, piled high with LOTS of cilantro and onions on top of big chunks of pork. We also got a free basket of chips and unlimited access to the salsa bar, most of which is hot, hot, and hotter. I stuffed myself full of porky goodness and those pickled spicy carrots, which I love.

The shop is pretty small, but I would describe it as quaint. There are a few tables inside and just two outside - so you may have to grab and go if it&#39;s busy (and it seems to get that way during lunch). But that isn&#39;t a big deal because crepes are great for that! Everything about the shop was super clean and inviting, including the manager/owner who is a very nice guy and friendly to all.

Normally I&#39;m not a big crepe fan but I figured we could give this place a try. We had the Cajun Chicken (the sauce is what makes this thing for sure), the Greek (so-so), and the Pesto (also so-so). All were made well (the crepe itself tends to the crispier side) and tasted just fine, but we were not, however, blown away by the taste. In fact, the overall consensus was that they seemed to be a bit on the bland side. To be honest, I would normally only have crepes as a &#34;dessert&#34; thing (sticking to their sweet menu) but since it was lunch I&#39;d thought I&#39;d branch out. However, in the future, I&#39;ll keep it strictly as a &#34;treat&#34; item.

While we were not blown away by our experience I&#39;d like to return again and give them another shot with a sweet crepe (THAT menu looks very enticing!). So we will, probably soon as an after-dinner treat."

While Bien has been my favorite mexican restaurant with hands down the best fish tacos that I have ever had, Altiro is now giving them a run for their money.
Where Bien focuses more so on tacos, Altiro presents more of a gourmet spin to their food. Altiro also offers tacos, but their food tastes a tad more authentic than Bien. Another big difference  is that you can actually make reservations at Altiro, which sadly, cannot be said for Bien.
While dining with my fiancee, we were lucky enough to meet Roberto, the owner/chef and he was so humble, down to earth, and very approachable. The only connection that can be made between Altiro and Bien is that Roberto worked for 5 years at Bien before branching out on his own. Another thing that I found very appealing about Altiro is the decor. It&#39;s very retro and the chairs are just the bomb! Roberto&#39;s wife decorated the restaurant and I have to say, the woman has some style! I also love that Altiro is centered around working with their family, which is something you do not see too much these days."

The restaurant is in a little strip mall, next to a karate studio. 
The restaurant is not very big, it&#39;s very cozy and quaint. If you don&#39;t like to sit very close to strangers then this restaurant is not for you. The tables are very close together.
We were seated right away. I loved the decor, the candles at every table, looked very pretty. The background music was perfect, I was definitely in my element. 
Food was fantastic and the drinks were ok. 
We ordered a few dishes, we started with the guacamole and chips and salsa. The guacamole was 3 different kinds, regular, one with jicama and a sweet mango one. The salsas were a mild and a hot and spicy. I really enjoyed it all, my favorite being the mild salsa, full of fantastic, smoky flavor. 
As far as the tapas we tried, they were all amazing. Food is fresh, with just the right amount of spice and flavor. 
Service was good, the servers were attentive but not pushy. 
I recommend this tapas place, great ambiance, fantastic food and yummy drinks. 
Very similar to Bien Trucha but this place can hold its own."

Negatives: 
The seating here was terrible. Way to close to others, super tight and uncomfortable. I couldn&#39;t wait to leave because I started to get cluster phobic. 

The bathroom was really nasty. It was dirty, and I kid you not when I walked in there was a hair brush on the sink. Which just disgusted me. If the bathroom appeared the way it did I wonder what other places of the restaurant looked like. 

The carnita tacos were terrible. Filled with nothing but fat, chewy chunky fat!! When we let our server aware that we weren&#39;t happy with these tacos, she replied with &#34;Well usually carnitas are fatty anyways.&#34; I don&#39;t know where she&#39;s getting her carnitas but they are NEVER fatty. Good quality carnitas if your getting them from a taqueria are never this way. So she blew both my mother in law and myself away. I&#39;m guessing she wasn&#39;t a paisa because she didn&#39;t know what she was talking about. They of course comped this off the bill, just like any other restaurant. 

Drinks here were average, they were your average mixed drinks at a bar, but made to look cute, fancy and yummy.. 

Save your money and time, and go to Bien Trucha."

Have had both numerous times and they are similarly both like frontera grill in the burbs. Great food and service and LIVE the pina cocktail. A very clever concoction that transforms near the at or exactly at the end as you must not finish the drink before the infused ice cube melts and changes it into a different drink altogether. Wonderful and spicy. I recommend getting 2 and sipping both slowly then you will not be tempted to finish too much before the melting moments. Yum. Love the al poblano super yummy chicken in awesome poblano crime sauce. Also the alambre skirt steak and cheese thing, AWESOME! Open for lunch too. Can&#39;t wait to go back"

It reminded me of all the awesome tapas places in the city that I miss. The restaurant is pretty small, so make sure you call ahead to make reservations. I noticed people that were waiting for a table were sitting in the kitchen. It is a tight squeeze.

My husband and I ordered the Al Trio guacamole to start. One regular guacamole and one mango and one watermelon. The watermelon guacamole was outstanding. Who ever would have thought to add watermelon to avocado? Such a nice surprise.

We also shared the Al Chilango steak tacos, the Al Carnitas pork belly tacos, the Al Elotito corn, and the Ala Pap Brava potatoes. All were outstanding. The potatoes were a little spicy, but they are served with a fried egg on top that really offsets the heat of the spices.

The restaurant is really small, so the tables are kinda close together, but one benefit of that is getting to see what other people ordered (without looking creepy by staring from a table from far away!). There are so many things I want to go back and try!

I ordered the Ala Pina pineapple margarita which was really good when it first came out, but the large ice cube inside was infused with chipotle spices, which made the drink hotter and spicier as you got down to the bottom. We also had the Al Naranja Agua (orange water) that is nothing like an orange juice (which I thought it would be). It was sweet yet tart at the same time (there was lime juice squeezed in too).

We finished our meal with a Strawberries &amp; Cream dessert (the special for Valentine&#39;s Day). It was served with rose petals on top, which I thought was a nice, romantic touch.

A few of the gripes I had about this place is the small size, and the fact that we visited on a cold February night - so every time the door opened, we were hit with a frigid gust of air. Brrr!

Other than that, the food here was so good that I know we&#39;ll be back! Looks like they have a nice-sized patio, so I&#39;ll be visiting when it gets a bit warmer out."

You could taste the freshness which is what this restaurant is all about.  Small portions for the $$, but that&#39;s how a lot of &#34;fresh ingredient&#34; places are.  They could probably lower their prices if they didn&#39;t have so many people &#34;working&#34; (standing around for the most part) or constantly filling our water glasses it felt like after every sip, which got a little annoying.

My biggest complaint about this place was the seating.  Very very very close together I almost felt uncomfortable talking to my boyfriend because I knew the two tables next to us could hear every word we said loud and clear.  Also, on one side of the table are normal chairs and the other side is a bench like seat that wraps around the entire restaurant, with a pillow for your back.  I got stuck at a table in the front of the restaurant with a huge window behind me that left me with no back support at all.  Not very comfortable when you want to go out on a Friday night for dinner and relax.  You kind of get the feeling they don&#39;t want you to get too comfortable so they can turn the tables over faster since the place is pretty tiny.

Over all, service was decent, food was good.  I would probably give this place another try one day but request a better table."

This, and the incessantly screeching child accompanying a waiting family, gave us a sour first impression.

The much-needed drinks, though delicious (especially my vegetal and spicy Al Verde), were disappointingly low-proof; given Bien Trucha&#39;s similar booze level, we had to wonder if it was just a symptom of this suburb&#39;s &#34;gringo&#34; aversion to strong tequila drinks. 

Passing over the only guacamole option of a fruit-filled $10 trio, we opted for yellowfin tuna tostadas laced with a chipotle glaze and avocado cream cheese. Pretty and tasty as they were, we felt $11 warranted more than four tiny chips. And king salmon tacos with grilled pineapple and chipotle aioli failed to impress. But skirt steak tacos, full of tender meat generously dressed with an excellent tomatillo-avocado salsa, got an intriguing flavor and texture boost from crispy shoestring potatoes. And elote swathed in garlic aioli with cotija cheese bore the distinct pungency of epazote, if only a tad too much. 

Our meal overall was good but not great -- it lacked the wow factor of Bien Trucha&#39;s explosive but balanced flavors and impressive price-portion ratio. Still, we wouldn&#39;t discourage you from trying Altiro, as long as you aren&#39;t looking for a facsimile of Bien."

Latin fusion I would call it. The staff was friendly and attentive. Sometimes a bit too attentive that could make a person feel uncomfortable. The food had nice flavor combinations. We would go back if in the area again, but not go out of our way for this restaurant. The food is expensive for the portion sizes you get, but that is with most tapas places. The guacamole appetizer was nothing special and we probably could have passed on it. Everything else including our potato dish, the shredded lamb, and the tacos were very tasty.

I love going to bien trucha when I&#39;m in town, however, due to the cold and small location we pulled around the block while my mom called to see if there was a wait. Before she even dialed, she said &#34;I have a better idea&#34;. She was right! The location is certainly kind of strange, but hey... There&#39;s PARKING!!!!! Living in Florida means I hate, hate, HATE cold walks on snowy, windy days just to get some food. Bien trucha sure has a parking issue. 
Altiro was nearly empty at 1pm on Wednesday and service was QUICK! We were promptly seated and our glasses filled with water(ok... I&#39;ll never understand the tiny water cups at these two places but whatever). We ordered drinks and an order of steak tacos. I went to the bathroom and before you know it, everything is there! It looked like everyone else had an order of chips given to them.. However we didn&#39;t get any which is a huge bummer for me. 
We tried to get a side order of rice and corn but the server informed us they don&#39;t have rice... Strange... But I did enjoy the corn! The order of beef tacos and corn left me satisfied. I&#39;m beyond impressed with how fast the food came out and would come back again when I visit."

After reading the yelp reviews (and a bit done with the surly service we&#39;d experienced at Bien Trucha the last few times we went there) we decided to give Altiro a try for our son&#39;s birthday. 

We sat on the patio on a Wednesday night &amp; it wasn&#39;t super busy. However, service was unbearably slow. Nice, but really, really slow. Our server forgot to put in the order of one of the guest&#39;s drinks and neglected to check back after serving everyone else, so she sat without anything long after everyone else&#39;s glasses had been drained. It was difficult to get anyone&#39;s attention, however when we did they were super nice. 

And the food was just okay. Not bad, but definitely not at the same level as Bien Trucha if you&#39;re looking for a substitution. 

We ordered the jicama guacamole, Altiro (tilapia tacos) Al Puercoriso (pork belly &amp; risotto), Al Chilango (skirt steak) Al Camaronchizo (shrimp &amp; chorizo) &amp; grilled corn side dish. Everyone seemed to like the shrimp &amp; chorizo best. The skirt steak wasn&#39;t very flavorful, pork belly was overly fatty (yes, I know it&#39;s not a lean dish but this was more than usual) and the tilapia was just okay. Again, not bad, but not anything to write home about. Sitting at a table that was too small for our party with empty drink glasses for most of the night really didn&#39;t help much, either. 

If the food was better we&#39;d be willing to give it another try, but after sampling so much, we just weren&#39;t that impressed. To be honest, I&#39;d rate Altiro somewhere closer to 2.5 stars, but when we did see our server she was really sweet and wanted to make us happy which is what landed the 3 star rating."

We made the mistake of coming without a reservation in a busy night, but were fortunate enough to secure a table for two. We ordered the El Chilango Tacos, which were delightful. Again, the steak was buttery soft, just melting in your mouth, with the cheese adding a tart but creamy addition to cut through the depth of the flavor of the steak. We also ordered the Tostada Tapas, which was melt in your mouth lamb this time, with a kick of chipotle, but no overpowering heat - just mellow, well rounded flavorful and unctuous meat atop a crispy, contrasting hard tortilla shell. Washed it all down with an Al Jarritos cocktail, which was the absolute BEST item of the night!!! Loved every second of being at this place, and it&#39;s food!"

The tacos are truly specialty tacos. They are of neither Taco Bell nor Mexican taqueria brand. Even the one vegetarian taco that I had came with a smoky flavouring that one would think enhances meat only.

The bar service was out of this world. I had one drink off the menu and one that was a concoction that was &#34;off the menu.&#34;

There is a constant flow of patrons, so either get there early or be prepared to wait. But rest assure, the food is so blasted good that you&#39;ll be okay when all is said and eaten."

It was perfect for an outdoor meal.  We were greeted by the cordial host who easily made it clear that he wanted to make sure we enjoyed.

We started off with an appetizer of Al Trio--three different samplers of guacamole, each was distinctive, savory, truly an appetizer.  

And then along came a Margarita--the Organica.  When you get the real thing, rarely, you can enjoy the essence of this great drink.  Rarely was upon us.  

We looked at the menu and found it all interesting.  

The portions are medium--neither large nor small.  We didn&#39;t feel the need to order more.

Partner (celebrating her postponed birthday) ordered Al Chilango--beef tacos with a &#39;frizzle&#39; of potato strings (local skirt steak with avocado sauce (nice twang with the sauce)).  Those small cubes that you find on typical tacos was there, but while the same size as at others, they were cooked to the proper doneness!  Morsels of goodness.

I had the Ala Barbacoa--lamb in cactus leaves.  As anyone knows (I really don&#39;t), cactus leaves add to the flavor of this traditional (is it traditional?) dish.  Wow!  Subtle flavors.  A true delight!      

Perfect evening.  Perfect cocktail.  Perfect meal."

Needless to say, they&#39;re now my favorite. Altiro was very small but cozy and almost lounge-like. My boyfriend took me here for Valentine&#39;s day. It was a Sunday around 5:00pm. We were seated promptly at a corner table. It was a candle-lit dinner. Very soft lighting and comfortable atmosphere. 
I ordered a flavored water (Al Limon) to start and drinks were brought out immediately. Let me just say, I LOVE the lime water. It was so refreshing, and tasted so vibrant. I would love to make this at home, for life. Our server was very nice, she introduced the menu and explained each section so we were familiar with the different categories. We started off with the Ceviche. Typically, I am not a cold fish, ceviche kind of girl. It was served on mini homemade tostadas. Totally fresh, totally delicious. I went back for seconds (there were four to an order). We ordered Mexican street-style corn as a side. Honestly, this was probably my least favorite dish of the night-only because if you&#39;re used to the traditional Elote/Corn in a cup vendor-it didn&#39;t really compare, personally.  
For our dinner order, we got the Al Fundido tacos. I could eat 12 of these I feel. They were fresh and an absolute delight. Our only gripe with these was we wish there were more than 1 shrimp per taco. Even just 1 more would&#39;ve made a difference. Either way-this dish was my boyfriend and mine&#39;s favorite. We also ordered Ala Tostada. It was shredded lamb with a chipotle sauce on a crispy tostada (same tostada as the ceviche). It came with three little tostadas and they were the cutest. The lamb was so tender. I do not like spicy food at all. It was spicy for a split second and in the next breath, it was gone. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. 
We were pretty full at this point, but then the waitress mentioned dessert. We had to. We chose the key lime pie bites. They were frozen and vibrant with lime flavor. Very good! I&#39;d definitely like to come back to Altiro and try more dishes on their menu."

The Good: Customer service, prompt timing, the barbacoa tapas

The Bad: Chilango steak tacos were bland, no seasoning for the steak strips. Price differences, menus on website are cheaper than what I was actually charged. Lastly, I had an order to go and they gave me no utensils or napkins. 

Overall I&#39;d like to honestly give a higher rating because the barbacoa was delicious, but the uber bland steak and price variance are hard to ignore."

What a phenomenal restaurant in Geneva, perfect for a casual date night or a nice anniversary evening like ours. We started with the ravioli and potato stack, and while I don&#39;t think we could have ordered anything that didn&#39;t blow the tops off our taste buds, both were incredible. Their sauces are so flavorful and really set the dishes over the top. We continued with a few items from their tacos menu and the roasted street corn. It was so enjoyable I&#39;m afraid to eat anywhere else now! It is also the type of restaurant that you crave what you ate, so while I want to go back and try everything on the menu, I will probably just reorder all the same because I can&#39;t not!

Also, our waiter was so great and personable. I&#39;m glad he talked us into a cocktail instead of wine, because the pineapple margarita he brought me was one of the most unique and flavorful cocktails I&#39;ve ever enjoyed. It was so fresh! I even think the ice cube was made of shredded pineapple, which is something I haven&#39;t experienced before and loved it. 

We&#39;ll definitely be back and as regular patrons of all restaurants in Geneva, I am confident when I say this was our favorite one yet."

Food and cocktails here are outstanding. Great for families or for a date. We like Papas Bravas, a masterfully constructed Jenga tower of potatoes, topped with a fried egg and adorned with a duo of chile sauces. Almost too beautiful to eat. It is our favorite item on the menu. 

Elote, a Mexican corn and mayo dish, is always a favorite in this place. Perfectly balanced flavors of sweet, smoke, and lime. It blasts your tongue from ten different angles.

The main dishes here are very similar to those found at Bien Trucha. All very good. 

Interesting cocktails here. They get creative with flavors and know how to balance flavorings in a cocktail.

Quite crowded - hostess very kind and took our drink order.  Flavored margaritas are excellent, freshly prepared, but they should be for $12 each (and they are about 5 oz).    Was later seated next to the door - seating is pretty crowded and the music doesn&#39;t really help, you can hear the conversations of the diners next to you in most locations.   

Ordered the &#34;Street&#34; corn appetizer, which was delightful.  Also had the shrimp tacos which were fresh and very good.  Dinner for two, one app and two taco entrees came out to around $80 with tip.    This place is very much like Bien Trucha without the attitude.

This place is SO delicious with a great atmosphere... it&#39;s totally off the beaten path - oddly located in the middle of a neighborhood... however it&#39;s a hidden gem and because of that, the wait time is substantially less than at Bien Trucha.  So I say I&#39;m hesitant to submit a stellar review because I selfishly don&#39;t want everyone to know about this awesome place and have to wait an hour+ to get in (unlike Bien Trucha).  But I digress.

Ok, so the food is so delicious.  SO delicious.  Fantastic flavors. 5 stars for sure. 
The Al Salmonjillo - wow!  So many wonderful flavors - this is definitely one of my favorites.  
The Al Elotito corn side dish is delicious.
Ala Tostada - delicious, a little messy and kind of hard to eat in a pretty manner, but still super good.
The Al Trio guacomole appetizer is good too.
I wasn&#39;t as impressed with the Ala Barbacoa - it&#39;s still good but I prefer bolder flavors.
I&#39;m a nursing mommy so I haven&#39;t tried their alcoholic drinks but the Ala Jamaica is really light and refreshing and comes in a fun jar :)

Price is a little high IMO for the amount of food you get.  We leave feeling comfortable.  Not still hungry yet not stuffed.  

We&#39;ve sat outside twice and really enjoy the atmosphere, especially when they light the fire lamps.  And both times we got right in - and the restaurant was full too, inside and out.

The service is fine - and this isn&#39;t a big deal but both times we&#39;ve been there, we&#39;ve experienced several mix ups with food and drinks.  We&#39;ve been brought food and drinks at least 3 times that belonged to another table.  Once is fine and mistakes are normal... I get it.  I&#39;ve worked in the food industry too.  But more than 3 mix ups in 2 visits.... hmm... do they just not write down table numbers along with the food/drink orders?  Seems a fairly simple way to solve that problem.  

Overall, this place is great - check it out!"

I could buy a quart of organic fruit and shake in a shot of good liquor for less. They&#39;re as much as the entrées! Yikes. The meat has good flavor, but it&#39;s all over cooked and tough, the chicken and the beef. Disappointing for sure. The corn tortillas are much too thin &amp; cheap. My chicken taco fell apart and splattered sauce everywhere. The beef tacos come in a bowl with some sauce &amp; cheese dumped on top and it&#39;s impossible to get out after the cheese congeals b/c it&#39;s cold. I get that it&#39;s easier for the kitchen to serve it that way, but it makes for a bad dining experience. Bien Trucha will remain in business if this is their competition."

However, I spent the majority of the meal being annoyed that so much of the menu was identical, or nearly identical to the menu at Bien Trucha. Does anyone know how these places are related? I recognized some of the wait staff from Bien as well- so I don&#39;t know if they left- or this is the 3rd restaurant opened by the chef?

Anyway- back to the experience at Altiro. The food was delicious- and the margaritas were great as well. As a group we tried three different ones, and none disappointed. We started with the trio of guacamole- all great. We also had the corn dish- which was amazing as always. I also thoroughly enjoyed my fish tacos.

The service was good- not excellent- but definitely attentive. My favorite thing about the restaurant was the space- it was perfect for the restaurant style. I loved all of their colors, and the unique use of a small space.

They take pride in what they&#39;re doing-that is evident.

I understand the owner is a former Bien Trucha employee and there are similarities-the tacos are at their base similar, but Altiro&#39;s sauces, the potato strings on top, and some flavors are different-in a good way!

The Al Puercoriso is the best example of their uniqueness-diced pork belly cooked just right in a risotto with smooth and a little cheesy (definitely not Velveeta!) and peppery sauce.   Unexpected but really great.

The guacamole trio to start was good-couldn&#39;t tell much difference, but I&#39;ll just assume my co-diners took the watermelon out of the one and the mango out of the other.   I did have one bit of mango in a bite.   Chips are good and the tomatillo that accompanied two of the three taco dishes was exceptional.

I&#39;ll go back for sure-the location is a couple of blocks north of State Street so a little out of the way, but makes a good combo with Pemrose Brewing Company, which I&#39;ll review next!  Outdoor seating is ample, which is needed as the interior isn&#39;t very large."

The location isn&#39;t on the main street in Geneva but nicely tucked away a few blocks down. I love the decor! So eclectic but comfy, very intimate as well. Food is served tapas style. Each of us picked a tapas and an appetizer. Our food was so fresh, the meat so soft and juicy and our drinks were so flavorful. Our server, Roberto, was so kind and patient with us. He was also so knowledgeable about the menu and the Geneva area. My husband went to the restroom and when coming back to the table he said he saw a plaque on the wall and realized that our server was actually the owner! We then asked him and him and his wife Ericka, came over to greet and talk to us. It was so refreshing to meet such sweet, genuine folks. They were so humble and kind. This is a family owned and operated business. Roberto gave us great suggestions on everything that we ordered, food and drinks.

I do love the differences here as I find it hard to compare. If I want to relax with some legit food and killer cocktails this is the place. 

Lunch is our favorite time because it seems like fried eggs may adorn most items. Who doesn&#39;t love a fried egg on top of their potato tower?

The drinks are potent which I love and why I may prefer this over my favorite taco joint ever. I think that taco joint may have lightened up on the tequila. I don&#39;t know but just saying...."

We ordered the El Fundido - the flavors were really good, but the shrimp was over cooked so it was hard to bite into. The Al Chilango tacos were definitely our favorite. The shoestring potatoes was a nice touch. We also had the Al Carnitas - very tasty.

The place is nice, modern and attractive without being fancy; could definitely do a business lunch here.

The food and it&#39;s presentation were only surpassed by the wonderful service of Roberto and (especially) his wife. The tuna (Al Atún) and the corn (Al Elotito) are just fantastic in both taste and presentation; you must try them.

Amateur technique disguised with fancy names just does not make up for very average and overpriced food. Unfortunately, mediocre, over-priced food was better than the service. 

Our waiter could not remember the specials (probably because the flavors were so forgettable). The times that he graced us with his presence, he would arrive stinking of cigarette smoke and without the drinks we ordered 10 minutes prior. When we queried about the drinks, he quickly shifted blame to the bartender saying that he was new and not familiar with their cocktail list. Meanwhile, both the bartender and our waiter had plenty of time for certain guests who appeared to be a group of friends of the establishment. 

At the end of the evening, we raised our service concerns to the manager who sniped back that our waiter and his bartender were some of his best staff and that maybe we should have better familiarized ourself with their menu. Whaaaa?????"

This weeks challenger is Altiro Latin Fusion!!!

Let&#39;s get ready toooo rummmm... Oh never mind, lets just get to the review.

First up, if it&#39;s Altiro, Bien Trucha, El Molcajete or even A Toda Madre, you will enjoy yourself. Each has their strong points. Altiro is most like Bien Trucha. Very similar menu. 

Let&#39;s break it down...

Food: 
Al Trio Guacamole- Great Guacamole, nice presentation, but the two fruit options were just overpowered by the Avocado. No real flavor wonders of the world here outside of the fact that it is great quality Guacamole.

Ala Tostada- Eh, Skip it, it reminded me of basic BBQ pork and the meat was mounded on a tiny little chip that could not really sustain that much topping. 

Al Calambre- This has the potential to be great, but it was just Killed by the guacamole tomatillo salsa! It took over, I did manage to get one faint taste of the wonderful steak underneath, but then my mouth was blown away by the Guacamole Bazooka. :-(

Al Elotito- I could eat this by the Truck load! Awesome Flavors of citrus and perfectly charred corn! This gave me the four star edge on a semi-3 star review! 

De-core:
Kinda rustic and done on a budget, but made me feel more at home in the long run. I&#39;m planning on stealing a few of their furniture ideas for my house.

Staff:
Totally and Completely Impeccable!!! Absolutely felt comfortable, taken care of and appreciated by everyone!!! Love the staff! 

(I would like to take a break to mention that the staff at Bien Trucha can be rushed, and non-personable and that is important when choosing this over that!!!! I get that that&#39;s their thing, but just saying)

Now, I am looking forward to coming back and giving a few other selections a try, I have a feeling that there are some other hidden pots of gold here. 

With a few minor modifications, the food here could be at the top my list and as a family run place, they already have my vote for Service!"

The portions look small but I assure you as a person with s big appetite, you will come away satisfied.  I highly recommend the grilled corn appetizer and guacamole sampler.  My wife is not one to eat corn and she loved it.  For our main dish, we had chicken tacos and tilapia tacos. Both were spectacular.  The portions looked small but after the 2 appetizers, they were just right.

The drinks here are expensive ($9 for an average sized cocktail in s martini glass) and the drinks come slowly.  That said, the drink I had, jalapeño cucumber martini, was really good.  All the cocktails on the menu look complicated to make which is likely why the drinks come slower than I would normally expect at a restaurant.

The atmosphere is very cozy and hip. It reminded me of the store front restaurants you find nestled away in neighborhoods in Manhattan.  If dining on the weekend at dinner time or later, make s reservation.  The restaurant itself is small and there is not a lot of space to wait if your table is not ready.  Also do not expect to be able to get a cocktail while you wait for the reasons I stated earlier.

We definitely plan to return here again."

I have no desire to stand in such a line with a 13-month old toddler, so we visited Altiro for breakfast instead.

We got strawberry pancakes for the toddler, while I got the Al Chori-Huevo and my wife got an Al-Fundido.

The names don&#39;t really help you out much, so here&#39;s what they actually were.

Al Chori-Huevo: if you&#39;re reading this, you should know about the goodness of chorizo. Now put an egg on top, a spicy sauce underneath, and oh, somehow it&#39;s not greasy. It had a tomato and an avocado on it, and this was a step above your ordinary brunch item. The flavors melded just right, the texture was surprisingly smooth... good stuff.

The Al Fundido is off the lunch menu. It&#39;s shrimp, sauce and veggies on top of a thicker piece of bread. Once again, the spice was just right, the shrimp marinated just right but not overcooked.

My daughter&#39;s pancakes also got an upgrade, served with sweetened condensed milk and sprinkles. In addition the pancakes themselves had a welcome tang.

Don&#39;t miss out on the freshly-squeezed fruit juice, either - we had lemon and lime, and it worked perfectly with what we ordered.

Not to miss. I want to go back for dinner!"

I had 2 margaritas. I liked them, a lot, and they seemed slightly different, but I don&#39;t know how. Maybe a little touch of a melon flavor???? I don&#39;t know, but I had two and was happy.

Time of my visit: Lunch Hour

Okay, let me start by saying, the only reason I went there, was for their gyros.  I had an appointment for an oil change and thought it would be a good time to try it out as the place was within walking distance.

Well, I was slightly disappointed.  Not the best gyro I have ever tasted, top 5 for sure.  I must say, they were not stingy with meat (hopefully you&#39;ll get to see the pictures), that&#39;s always a plus to me.  The meat itself was moist and soft.  Fries were a bit cold.  The one thing, which is different from any other place, I have ever had a gyro at, is they put cucumber sauce on the side (again, hopefully the picture will show up).  I don&#39;t know how I feel about that.  I did like how the pita was positioned/made, it&#39;s kind of arc-y, so it was easier to grab the sandwich and made it less messy to eat, which is a plus.

The staff was very friendly.  However, I must say the price was a bit high, $9 and change (after taxes) for gyro and fires and no drink was a bit much.  I get it&#39;s the area, but even for this area, that&#39;s a bit too much, in my opinion.  The inside is a bit outdated and feels cramped, when they are busy.

Overall a solid B.  I probably won&#39;t be make a special, repeat trip for a gyro, just because I feel there are better options in the area.  Definitely worth checking out, at least once."

My high school was right up the street (Go Falcons!) so I&#39;d come here for lunch as well. This place has been around since the early 80&#39;s, and not much has changed here. The decor is dated, but there is plenty of seating.

I ordered the hot dog special (one hot dog with fries; they also have a two hot dog with fries special) for about $4. My food was prepared quickly, and when I told the worker &#34;thank you&#34; as I picked up my food, he just glared at me. No smile, no reciprocal &#34;you&#39;re welcome.&#34; Just the ol&#39; stink eye. I don&#39;t know what that was about. Sorry for making you have to work, buddy.

The hot dog left something to be desired. There was plenty of relish and onion. They weren&#39;t stingy with the sport peppers or large pickle,either. I opted for no tomato slices this time; I didn&#39;t have a taste for them. The bun didn&#39;t taste as fresh as I would have liked, and there were no poppy seeds. The fries were hot and fresh, but the helping of them was quite large. I only ate half of them and it looked as though I hardly put a dent in them.

I&#39;ve also had the Julienne salad here, which wasn&#39;t bad. Their Gyros are okay... I&#39;ve had better elsewhere.

Maybe it&#39;s been too long since I&#39;ve eaten here, but the food doesn&#39;t taste the same as I remember it. The employees certainly aren&#39;t as friendly as I remember, with the exception of the lady who took my order. I&#39;ll probably still stop in on occasion but it&#39;ll be for the nostalgia factor and a quick snack, not a filling meal."

I know there are other places that arent too far from this place that have better ribs. I also tried the gyro burger. Unimpressive. If you just want a decent hot dog gyro rib place for taking the baseball team to after a game or you cant find anywhere else then ya go enjoy. It is not terrible or even bad. I simply think it has poor quality ingredients which is important to me. I may even pop in there again and try a hot dog or something. The two times Ive been there the place was near empty.

We chose Smokehouse and what a mistake!

The  female (I almost said lady) behind the register was the exact opposite of friendly. If it were just me, instead of my whole family, I would have left from her lack of kindness alone. Unfortunately, we still ordered and paid for our items.

The fries were blah, The buns (both hot dog and hamburger) were not high quality and my daughter did not even touch her corned beef sandwich. If you want better fast food locally go to Steamers. If you expect warm, welcoming employees when you decide to patronize a small business, go to Kilwins. That is what we did afterwards for dessert since this lunch was a bust."

Really though, how much better than average can a gyros be?

The prices were slightly steeper than I&#39;m used to, $6.09 for a gyros sandwich, over $8 for a gyros plate. But it&#39;s true, the gyros IS a bit better than average. A nice, unique flavor to the meat and the pita was as good as one could ask for. The sauce is a bit less overpowering than other sauces I have had, in a good way.

The staff were not particularly friendly and the eating area itself was a bit uncomfortable and messy, much like I expected from seeing the outside.  I would not drive very far out of my way to eat here, but I&#39;d gladly come back the next time I&#39;m in the area and hungry."

As I drove by I noticed a Hot Dog and fries combo advertised in the window and decided to try it.

After walking in I noticed a surprising amount of seating, there is one long counter where you can place your order. They have a fairly diverse menu and advertise that they were named Best Gyro of 2009 by the Daily Herald newspaper.

I placed my order and within a few minutes had my hot dog and fries to go.

The fries were fairly standard long cut fries, they weren&#39;t over salted which was nice as most places that prepare this particular type of fries have a tendency to go banana&#39;s with applying salt to them.

The hot dog came on a mushy non-poppy seed bun. The hot dog itself was warm, the onions were nicely cut, the mustard was well applied and the relish was a standard non-neon type. What surprised me about this hot dog was the sport peppers, these had just the right amount of spice to them to compliment this hot dog. Unfortunately, the bun loses a few points, as I grabbed on to the hot dog to take a bite my thumb went right there the bun. It was too mushy and almost soggy. It made it a bit harder to eat than would normally be required. Outside of the bun however, this was a surprisingly excellent hot dog. I would come back and try it again."

Everyone I know has been going here for years and they all have their personal favorites which is what makes it so great.  The hardest part is deciding what you want, until you cave and get what you always get, the gyro plate.  This round metal tin of joy is recognizable to Smokehouse &#34;regs&#34; young and old.  The gyro plate is full of sliced lamb (cut right in front of you which is cool), onions, tomato, pita bread and classic cucumber sauce with a side of fries.  It&#39;s a huge portion for rookies, but if you&#39;re willing to go pro, you can probably finish it.  The gamut of food runs the like of subs, salads, hot dogs, chili, and Italian beef; pretty much any American food you can think of, they have.

The fries are nothing special but they are hot and crisp (as I remembered). I&#39;ve also had the hot dog special which is 3.30 (before tax) and the Greek salad - both were good...but remember it&#39;s been about 7 years since I&#39;ve lunched here regularly.

I&#39;d give this place a 3.5 star rating but yelp won&#39;t let me...and I can&#39;t bring myself to give it a 3. I will say the decor has not changed at all since I&#39;ve last been here.

So much better than Portillo&#39;s. It&#39;s friggin blasphemy that other person even mentioned that and Jack Straws. Jack Straws is EWW. 

Sure it looks like it did back in 1980. So what? It&#39;s the food, and the food is GOOD for a 1000 calorie splurge or when you&#39;re hungover on a Sunday afternoon."

Yes, the restaurant is old, and never been remodeled,  However for those of us who have been coming there for 26+ years that&#39;s the way we like it.   So downgrading the the joint because your  crew doesn&#39;t fit in a seat is kinda lame.. no it is lame.

The Gyros are the best in town, and have been for 26 years.   None of the trimming the meat and  throwing back on the grill to brown.. that&#39;s sacrilege.  

This place is like Gene and Judes,    the food is so good that the eccentricities of  joint are what make it.   

As for the Comparison to Jack Straw&#39;s being better in Wheaton,  your probably a transplant  and enjoy grease soaked-spongy french fries that have been refried several times."

I do say that the Smokehouses gyro is awesome.  I&#39;ve ordered it with the meat extra crispy and loved it.  As a matther of fact, I have only gotten the gyro platter.  The fries are also very good, of the thick steak cut variety.

Warning however, you will leave the place smelling like either onions or like you&#39;ve been sitting directly next to a rotating gyro cooker for an hour.

I also love the Greek lady taking your order and how she&#39;s all business.  I believe I did get her to smile one day over something stupid but I might&#39;ve immagined it; she is that tough.  And as my homie Brianna W will tell you, I have my moments with being funny."

They have the best gyros outside of Greek town, and for someone who loves Greek town, that is high praise indeed.  One thing I have learned though, if you get the gyros sandwich, don&#39;t ask for the sauce on the side or you get a very little pre-packed container of sauce.

One other thing we like in our  house is that the salads are really good and fresh, which helps counter the rest of the meal which I know is not good for me, but so very good. Most places like this are not concerned about fresh vegetables for salad, the Smoke House is, which is a major plus for our household. Only complaint, not exactly a pleasant group working there.

We ordered the Platter #1 which comes in at $17. Included pulled chicken sandwich, rib tips, 4 ribs, and a we got baked beans. Everything was smokey and tender. The beans threw us off because there is a prominent onion seasoning, but it was absolutely fantastic. We also ordered the Platter #2 also $17. Included pulled pork sandwich, 2 hot links, 4 ribs, and we got the steak fries as a side. The hot links were the star of that show, the meat melts, and the spice level was perfect. The ribs were good not blow your mind awesome, but good and tender, smoked all the way through.

There was no one else in the restaurant, although a few people came in for pick up only. The place was clean, staff friendly. There&#39;s 8 tables in the main dining room along with a stage for live music. There is also a party room available for a catered event.

Meat is well seasoned and smoked the sauce is excellent.  We usually get the rib tips and have never had a bad batch.  Meaty and cooked through and have never gotten a batch that is too fatty (from not being slow smoked properly) or with too much gristle (from not choosing good quality meat).  

They do serve this joint style with fries on the bottom and sauce poured over the top so the sauce and meat drippings coat the fries.  The bbq joints of my childhood in Chicago, and when visiting family in St Louis and East St Louis put fries on the bottom meat (ribs or tips) in the middle and bread on the top and soaked it all (think Lem&#39;s if you are a Chicago South Sider).  

Good place great food.  The five-star bbq would taste exactly like my dad&#39;s this is the closest so far but my dad is still tops.  He took his secrets when he passed so, for now, it&#39;s Thomas.

First on Montgomery. Then on New York close to Eola. Then further east on New York.

Got a rack of ribs, half chicken, rib tips, beans and fries.
Rack of ribs met expectations! I would love to have more of these.

Rib tips were delicious! Definitely have more of these. 

Beans were ok...l I&#39;ve had all kinds of beans everywhere.  I had some more than a few folks try them too and we all agree, it&#39;s something to experience....once.

I really enjoyed the steak fries with the sauce. At times they were under-seasoned, but the sauce more than made up for it. But not a spectacle to behold.

Sooo with the expert taste of good quality smoked meat, I feel this place has a lot to desire to meet that standard.    I wasn&#39;t a fan of havin the bbq sauce put on the fries as it made them soggy.  You can tell the pulled pork is pre shredded and mixed and kept on a warmer since without the sauce the meat would be dry.  I think that good meat cooked correctly, especially smoked, shouldn&#39;t be in need of any sauce if the flavor if there for the meat.

The place was full of two tops which made it look 1/2 filled.  It only seats like 25 max anyways so having it 1/2 full made the experience even more intimate.  

The service was impeccable as always.   Having to go down to the basement and ring the doorbell to be let in is really a quaint touch.  Makes you feel even more VIP!

The menu is ever changing, but both times I have eaten at tallgrass have been in the fall so I did recognize some dishes that I had last time.  

So my wife and I decided to each do five courses (turned out to be A LOT of food!).  You can choose any five items off the menu, but the general idea is to order soup or salad first, followed by a lighter couple items, then one big meat item and finish with a dessert.  That is exactly what we did.  

I started my evening with the clam chowder.  It was killer.  It was only about 4 or 5 ounces, but there were forty fresh mussels nestles with the potatoes and some fish (not sure what kind of fish).  This was a  great take on clam chowder.  I inhaled it.

Second course for me was Trumpet mushrooms slice longways about a quarter inch thick with al dente asparagus and grated parmesan cheese over the top.  This was my first experience with trumpet mushrooms and while I really, really enjoyed the flavor...  they were a little bit tough.   

Third course was by far my favorite thing to put in my face....   The Foie Gras (spelling?) was a life changing experience.  I have had foie gras many times in the past, and I always love it, but this preparation has been returning to me in dreams every night since.  Picture a silver dollar pancake with a similiar sized hunk of perfectly seared foie gras on top.  Now drizzle a modest amount of extremely light maple syrup over both.  Finish the dish with a crispy disc of baconized prosciutto on top.   The tastes of all four components created the most lavish steak, pancakes/syrup and bacon mouthgasm that you can only understand through experiencing it.  I look forward to my next tallgrass, foie gras nightly dream.

Fourth course was a special for the evening, &#34;trio of birds&#34;.   How could I not order it?!?!  Half a grilled Quail was perfect.  Seared rare duck breast perfect.  Lightly breaded Capon..... tasted like chicken (actually it tasted like a ball-less rooster breast!).  Look it up.  

I finished with the five chocolate dessert.  I would explain them all, but I trust that after reading about the first 4 courses you can appreciate that Tallgrass won&#39;t finish a meal anything short of spectacular.

Thank you wife for a great anniversary, and Tallgrass you are my Lockport mistress."

Pros: Colleen the server was very apologetic about said hair.
Service was above average.
Great value for the tasting menu.

I was told that this place was probably one of the best in the western suburbs. And it&#39;s the closest thing without actually going into the city for some quality dining. And so far from my experience here, that I agree with that statement.

They have a 3,4 or 5 course meal. They also have a 7 course tasting menu. If you&#39;re hungry, then go for the 5 course meal. If you have an ok appetite and you&#39;re ok with smaller portions, you should try the 7 course tasting menu. I opted for the 7 course tasting menu, because I had a feeling I would be back, so I can try out more of their dishes.

Again, service was above average. I was there on a random Wednesday evening. Slow night with only 3 tables being utilized and only Colleen was serving. She was very attentive. I asked if she can make me a Mai Tai, and although it took about 20 minutes, she was very determined to find out on how to make it. And it was pretty damn good too.

My recommendation...go for the house assortment dessert plate.

Aside from the hair in my food, she replaced my dish right away, comped my drinks, I had a great time. I&#39;ll come back and hope to have a hairless experience the second time around."

Food, eh. 3 Course meal. 

Scallops as my starter  - Amazing 

Seafood Platter- An extra $5... it was OKAY. Lobster lasanga was over cooked and flavorless. The deviled egg was definitely bitter. Shrimp on a cracker was nothing special. Salmon perogi was too salty and had a strong fishy smell. Crab puff was delicious.

Duck confit as the main course- nothing to write home about. The sauteed Japanese was too salty and had a strong mushroom smell. The duck breast was cooked to my preference, however it was drenched in the gravy of the mushrooms. The confit was in a crepe, was not as flavorful as I had anticipated.

Overall experience, decent however not a place I would revisit."

Tallgrass Restaurant is hands down the best restaurant I&#39;ve been to in my life. I wish I could give this a ten star review.  Two years ago my now husband proposed during a hike at Starved Rock state park and then surprised me with a celebratory engagement dinner at Tallgrass Restaurant in Lockport.  One year ago we were married.  This weekend we celebrate our first wedding anniversary and decided to return to Starved Rock and then Tallgrass.  We were wowed with the service and menu selection.  Our servers, Colleen and Justin, were knowledgeable and professional, yet friendly and approachable.  Colleen even remembered us from two years ago and provided us a glass of celebratory champagne.  What a nice and unexpected touch!  The service at Tallgrass is second to none.  The servers really make the dining experience memorable.  The menu is filled with interesting and delicious meals with complimenting flavors and unique ingredients.  We each chose the four course meal.  I can honestly say each course was the best dish I ever tried, until the next course.  I HIGHLY recommend Tallgrass Restaurant in Lockport, IL."
tallgrass-restaurant-lockport,Shannon M.,H32QTRV87Q6CGTVUm1Z4QA,"Naperville, IL",1,1,0,119,1,ERQqWHRgSNLjp5E2K6o5mQ,4.0,2013-08-04,"For my mother&#39;s 60th birthday my parents and I went to Tallgrass (special restaurant for a special occasion!) It&#39;s a sort of conspicuous gem on the slightly scrubby old main street of downtown Lockport, a place that seems like it could really make something more of itself if it tried a bit harder.

Anyway, Tallgrass seems to want to make you aware of its specialness by putting you through an obstacle course just to get inside. You enter below street level, which lends a kind of speakeasy vibe, but then promptly hike up a steep set of stairs again. The dining room is a very cool space, with molded ceilings, chandeliers, and tiled floors (the multi-mirrored bathroom could plunge one into a paranoiac panic). 

We opted for the three courses (which was plenty, and they had no problem with us sneaking bites off one another).

The first course consisted of appetizer or salad choices. My dad got the bruscetta salad, and I the wedge of romaine (proscuitto being a more delicate version to the stodgier bacon crumbles that one generally sees).
But my mother made the best choice with an appetizer combo consisting of a literally melt-in-your-mouth lobster ravioli, a deviled egg (its filling the consistency of whipped cream), a crab beignet (think of Cafe du Monde making the perfect crab Rangoon), and a smoked salmon gnocci.

For the second course, my father had the steak with lobster bernaise sause and king crab lettuce roll with a potato terrine. He enjoyed the entree but thought the terrine (think potato lasagna) was awkward.
I enjoyed my entree overall: tender diver scallops with bacon (the proscuitto again would have been better) in a voluptuous vanilla sauce, garnished with tiny balls of honeydew and cantaloupe (rather hard to nab with a fork) and some stringy, tough leeks. It was a tasty disk, though a slightly weird execution.
My mom chose halibut with lemon butter and mango sauce with proscuitto, which complemented one another nicely.

The dessert course offered a wide variety to choose from, especially with several options for &#34;tasting&#34; menus. My mother did this and received a combo of an apple crisp, blueberry crumble, chocolate souffle, orange creamsicle pot de creme, and creme brulee served in an eggshell. I got the chocolate version, which was interesting but really too heavy: chocolate mousse, a mini souffle, a &#34;tower&#34; wrapped around a filling of whipped cream and raspberry, an insanely rich truffle, and a tiny crepe with banana-chocolate filling. Of all I preferred the mousse: like a smooth, luscious chocolate pudding.

Service was very attentive, the only bobble being when the server brought the wrong Chateau Neuf du Pape (red rather than white); since reds can be much more $$, this was a booboo. They offered to change it, but we tried it and were okay with it, and the price disparity wasn&#39;t insane in this case.

Overall, it was a good choice for a special occasion meal in the sw suburbs. Tallgrass can stand tall as one of the highlights of fine dining if you are looking in the region of Joliet."
tallgrass-restaurant-lockport,Wayne B.,pftbWgvvcmkneyF3VywtBw,"Woodridge, IL",0,1,0,0,7,CSZRedSd5imrd7NxpGq0gw,2.0,2016-02-03,"I&#39;ve been here a number of times the past few years and unfortunately this last experience was very poor.  I always opt for the 7 course (chefs choice) with wine flight and have always been pleased!  Unfortunately, this last visit was an exceptionally poor showing by the chef.  I always enjoy the service at Tall Grass and the servers go out of their way to make sure you always have a sufficient amount of bread, water and/or other drink.  They also even remember me (even though I only go a couple of times a year). 

This experience started out poorly --- one of the selections (they always have a variety of 4 or 5) of bread was clearly burnt - not just the outer crust, but a good inch into the bread.  This turned out to be a harbinger of things to come.  3 of the 4 courses were tasty although, were repetitive of previous dishes that I had almost a year ago.  The remaining 4 dishes were poorly executed and should likely have never made it out to the table.  1) The scallops that were served were over cooked on one side and still a milky white on the other side.  2) The sweetbreads were actually burnt on one side (although nicely cooked on the other).  Interestingly enough, they were served burnt side down - my assumption is to hide the mistake.  Additionally, I heard the server mention to the table next to me that the chef was not happy with the way their order of sweetbreads had turned out and offered them a replacement course.  3) The soup had over cooked mussels (and a broken shell) -- this can happen, but I would expect more from this establishment.  4) The final issue was the radically old? and/or overcooked duck.  I couldn&#39;t even cut several areas of the duck as it had either been reheated to death, sitting out for an extended period and/or just cooked improperly.   The duck course was enough for me to actually make note to the server to advise the chef of the issue.  

I likely should have just sent back all 4 of the courses, but I figured (since I was having 7 courses) that I would settle for a couple of less than stellar courses.  The server was very apologetic and even treated me to a free espresso and extra glass of champagne.  She even refused an extra tip when she retrieved our coats for us at the end of the evening.  So, despite a very positive experience with the service staff I have to say the food (which is why I come here at least once or twice a year) - was subpar at best.  

My final issue with the restaurant during this trip was how the bill was processed.  I absolutely did not expect an adjustment on the bill (which, as expected, was in excess of $350 including tip) however, I did expect it to be processed promptly.  My dinner at Tall Grass (to celebrate my Anniversary) was on January 2nd.  However, they didn&#39;t put the charge through on my American Express card until February 1st.  While, I guess it isn&#39;t a big deal - it is just another annoyance with this most recent visit.  I am unsure if I will return in the near future; however, given that this is my only poor experience here --- I will likely give it another chance in a year or so."

If nothing else then the dessert and being treated like a dignitary. From the moment my wife and I walked in they called us by Mr and Mrs, (last name) the whole time. It was the little touches that make this already amazing place over the top. 
I liked the fact that they have a dress code for Men. This is a rarity in today&#39;s world and I am all for going for a nice evening with jeans and a polo but sometimes on special occasion I like to dress in a jacket and it takes away from the evening when the rest of the people are in causal attire. Even our bill, at the end of the meal, came beautifully handwriting in almost a calligraphy format. 

The food was amazing, my wife and end went with the 5 courses a piece and it was a little too much, but it was our first time. Would do 4-courses on the next trip."

I was a little skeptic by the &#34;Ring the door downstairs to be let in&#34; sign since I&#39;ve never had to be &#34;let in&#34; into a restaurant before. It seemed really shady because I wasn&#39;t even sure I was in the right place and there was no indicator that the doorbell was ringing... I guess it could feel like some secret club though. Some guy let us in and it was pitch black. In the distance, it looked like a dark empty room. I really thought he was going to slaughter us at this point.

Then he led us upstairs and it was dazzling. Really bright lights inside a small, cozy room.  There were only a few tables in here and they were all packed. 

My bf and I were greedy so we got the biggest course dinner you could. I loved that you could choose your dishes unlike most other tasting menus. The best part was that most of these dishes were organic and low-carb. 

We were ridiculously stuffed by the end and didn&#39;t even enjoy our desserts because we were so full. My bf enjoyed it though and I took him there for his birthday so we were happy."

Not sure what the issue is with having to walk downstairs to enter. If you failed to notice, the dinning room is right off the street. If during the winter months you enter from street level the whole dinning room would be flooded with cold air and you would be complaining about that.

For a long time (up until the last ten years), it was the only really fine dining opportunity in the southwest suburbs. We haven&#39;t been here in a while because we&#39;ve been busy trying out the other nice dining establishments that have recently opened in the area, but I think it&#39;s time for a re-visit.

You enter by first descending a flight of stairs and ringing the doorbell, then are welcomed in a basement vestibule and taken up a flight of stairs to the dining room. It&#39;s very intimate, with only about 12 tables, and very elegant, with original gas chandeliers, dark wood wainscoting, a beautiful silver and china collection, and high windows. 

You create your own menu by choosing three, four or five-course meals from more than 30 different meat, seafood, or vegetarian items. Most of the items are rich, so you may want to confine yourself to the three-course menu. Their trio of soups is a specialty, with three double-flavored soups all served in one bowl. The desserts are also spectacular - I remember seeing another customer being served with what looked like a tower made of chocolate. I was usually too full to ever order that particular one; I usually opted for the chocolate soufflé instead. The wine list is extensive, with over 200 vintages by the bottle and 12 by the glass, but reasonably priced.  Service has always been impeccable whenever we&#39;ve been there.

Since the restaurant is so small, reservations in advance are required. It&#39;s also pricey, so save it for special occasions. But definitely try it at least once."

My wife and I are both foodies, and are fortunate enough to be well-traveled and have dined in restaurants in many cities here and abroad, so we know a good restaurant when we dine in one.

I was in Joliet on business by myself and drove to Lockport, as this was the only restaurant within miles that was characterized as fine dining by Yelp and Zagat&#39;s.  The room, the food, and the service were all excellent, and I commented to the owners in a separate e-mail that this is the best dining experience I have had in a small town anywhere in America (well, maybe the Inn at Little Washington would be a real contender for this title).  This is major, top-notch dining found only in America&#39;s five or six top restaurant cities in the US (New York, San Fransisco, Miami, LA, and maybe a tie between Chicago and Seattle).  

My three-course dinner was fabulous, the cocktails we large and generous, and the wine was superb.  There were no criticisms or shortcomings, and I can&#39;t wait to go back.

It really is surprisingly high end for the setting. It&#39;s worth noting, you need to make reservations well in advance. The dining room is quite small, and they only do two seatings per day (5pm and 8pm I believe). The ambiance is old and refined, without the polished glitz of a newer city restaurant. The food was all very well prepared and ranged from good to outstanding. We were a party of 4 and each got a the 4 course option, so we got to try a lot of the menu. It was my first time trying foie gras which I thought was delicious. Ravioli was particularly good too. The 3rd course entrees were a bit of a mixed bag, some a fair bit better than others, but all well done. The desserts too, were all finely made, but a few were a shy of delicious. That said, it&#39;s a top class restaurant, and worth the price if you&#39;re in the area and looking for something upscale."

Since moving to the Chicago suburbs several years ago, Tallgrass was a delightful discovery.  We have been back several times, usually for our anniversary.  On our recent dinner, the service was uneven, not nearly to the level of the past.  The food was ok, but nothing special.  We both had the bruschetta salad and the Trio of Morels.  The salad was basically cut up avocados and cherry tomatoes.  The trio of morels was a small piece of roasted chicken with a morel sauce.  But the sauce was so heavily favored, it overwhelmed the morels.  The deserts were equally disappointing.

It&#39;s not often we get to do the reverse commute on the weekends and drive out to the burbs for a night out - city slickers don&#39;t like to be designated drivers :-)

Having heard about Tallgrass for years now and finally getting the chance to try it, I was super excited. The menu looked awesome and I liked the idea of essentially creating your own multi-course menu (up to 7!) 

Unfortunately, by the end of the night, my dinner companions and I agree that Tallgrass was overall quite overrated and very disappointing. Also, not to sound snobby, but not sure how a white zin ended up on the menu of such a &#34;fine dining&#34; establishment...

As for the food, the general consensus was-- nothing stood out, and everything was very heavy. For such a rich menu, it would be nice to have one-bite palate cleansers between courses like a sorbet or something. Also, another complaint I have is they really need to work on their portion sizes. They are way too big for the tasting menu format. For example, I started with the trio of soup, which I thought would be served in little shot glasses or something else appropriately sized.. instead I got a bowl-sized portion of soup (all three in one bowl) that gets me half way to full. 

The chef has some good ideas b/c everything sounded awesome on paper.. but unfortunately most of them got lost in the execution. If Gordon Ramsey took over the restaurant for a day, he would tell the chef to narrow his focus and cut down his menu by half. 

For me, at the end of the night, the only thing that lingered from our dinner was a monster case of indigestion caused by the meal :("

I ordered a chocolate souffle which although very good had baked at all different temperatures. The top was cool and the bottom was warm.

But it mostly was for things outside of the food itself. Try it if you are meeting people who live near Lockport. Otherwise, it isn&#39;t really worth the trip.
We met some friends here last night for dinner. Our party was supposed to have had six people, but two people dropped out at the last minute (literally). That ended up working in our favor. We arrived at at the time of our reservation, told the waiter that our party was smaller than expected, and he said he&#39;d check to see if our table was ready, which it was. When he took us upstairs, we saw that only a four-top was available. So who knows how long we would have waited for a table. We were the last people to be seated that evening, and a six-top didn&#39;t open up until at least 45 minutes after the time of our reservation.
If you choose the three-, four- or five-course meals, you select your own dishes from the menu. A few of the dishes have a surcharge of a few dollars, but there is enough of a selection that you aren&#39;t forced to choose them.
We went with the seven-course tasting menu. The food was okay. The scallop with the chorizo pilaf was good. We also all liked ravioli with the crispy prosciutto. The rest of the dishes became less and less impressive as the meal continued. Not that they were bad. They were just so-so. But dessert -- a collection of four little desserts -- ended the meal on a high note.
The service is mostly good. It was little strange that instead of just bringing the wine list and menus, they asked us if we wanted a wine list. Then we had to wait for the menus. I didn&#39;t like that they cleared plates before everyone was done with the course. But the servers were very good about explaining what each dish was. They also were attentive when it came to refilling our water and wine glasses.
Unfortunately, this is what I&#39;ll remember most about the restaurant: The seven-course dinner is advertised on the menu as $88. When the bill came, we saw that our dinners were $88 plus two surcharges. Really? The tasting menu is chef&#39;s choice. We had no say in what dishes were selected for our meal. We were happy with our meals, but why not just be honest and print the true cost?"

Terrible cocktails, they used cheap liquor and a bad (browned) lime as garnish.  This is unexceptable from a so called fine dinning establishment.

The the fun begins.  The wait staff is outstanding.  We knocked one of our forks off the table and it was picked up and replaced almost before it hit the floor.  The bread basket consisted of a number of offerings, all fresh baked and delicious!

After selecting our courses, we chose a Cotes&#39; Du Rhone wine that was outstanding (it&#39;s one of my favorites) as usual. 

My wife had the goat cheese and asian pear salad and loved it.  I had the crispy brie and spinach salad and it was to die for.  

The second course (we decided on only three courses to keep the calories down) for me was the Beef trio which consisted of about (a guess here) 2oz each of new york strip, fillet mignon, and short ribs each served over a different kind of potato (cheesy polenta, whipped, and sweet.  It was fabulous.  The steaks were perfectly done.

My wife had the rack of lamb and had nothing but good to say about it.  It came with polenta and vegetables puree.

For the desert course we both picked the raspberry trio off the special menu for the day and what a treat that was.  A Raspberry creme brulee (served in an egg shell), crisp and crepe.

Then the waitress brought pouilly fume instead of pouilly Fuisse.  We had to wait another 5 minutes before we were offered bread! First course soup (the trio) was about as appetizing as lukewarm baby food. 2nd course scallops were tasty if sparse (2). 3rd course was pretty tasty - I has a frisée salad (not sure why it had green beans, peanuts and raisins tho.)and hubby had veal cannoli. For Mains, I had the single rack of lamb while hubby had NY strip and short rib, great flavor in the meat dishes but light on the sides (2 tiny onions and a few mushrooms) and portion sizes. 
Desserts were quite good, a choice of 5 desserts  - all chocolate or an assortment. Chocolate souffle was definitely the best of both dishes. 
The ambiance was quite odd, too brightly lit and tables with plastic mats and very chilly. Pretty cheesy for a $250 meal. Next time, I&#39;ll go into the city for a splurge."

I am profoundly delighted to say that I enjoyed yet again a most amazing meal.  The menu choices are extensive, the service is so correct and friendly, and the presentation is gorgeous.   Bravo, Tallgrass, and thank you again for a wonderful evening.  We will not wait so long between visits."

The ambiance was romantic and cozy, the food exquisite and the wait staff superb. We were most definitely treated like royalty. A definite downtown Chicago fine dining establishment in the southwest suburbs. Hard to find but well worth any special occasion!"

Very attentive staff and the food was delicious! My only complaint is that we couldn&#39;t try everything on the menu due to the both of us approaching a food coma-like state :). Tasting portions are very generous and enough for you to share with someone else. I would highly recommend this place to anyone if they are looking for a special occasion restaurant.

My friends and I have a club where we go to all of the restaurants in the Chicago-area rated higher than 26 in Zagats.  Don&#39;t get me started on how I think Zagats has lost it&#39;s mind but Tallgrass&#39; food is rated a 29 which is the same rating that Alinea has.  That&#39;s some pretty esteemed company so we made a reservation about a month ago.

Place is way the hell out there but that&#39;s fine, we knew it when we made the reservation but good to know if you&#39;re planning on having a few and then driving into the city. The space is okay - we were in the basement which was pretty dark and claustrophobic, I much preferred upstairs. 

Food was delicious but it isn&#39;t in the same league as Alinea.   Or Trotters, Schwa, Blackbird, Avec, Hot Doug&#39;s etc.   The service was o-kay and the wine pairing was seriously lacking.  A Hess pinot noir? How creative. 

Overall, we enjoyed it but were expecting somethign amazing based on the Zagat rating.  I recommend it if you live out there and want something special but we didn&#39;t think it was worth the drive from the city."

Some describe it as a city restaurant but I&#39;m not really sure that even covers it.  It is pricier but the wine list is an excellent value for the quality of the wine.

As some have noted the dishes are very rich and fairly large for a tasting type menu, however, I look at that as a plus personally.  They do adjust the size of the courses based on how many courses you order though.

The service is fantastic and I love the look and feel of the restaurant.  It&#39;s very much like a supper club feeling downstairs and the small intimate dining room upstairs feel like a private club.  It&#39;s especially enjoyable for me to enter a place like this from downtown Lockport (no offense intended I grew up going to high school there) where this is really a diamond in the rough.

I can see how those in the city might find a try out to Lockport for something that they can have in the city not worth the bother.  However, for those who are living in the suburbs this restaurant is an amazing and affordable offering for special occasions.  With a few exceptions of places like Vie in Western Springs, I&#39;m hard pressed to think of it&#39;s equal.

Not as modern seeming as the downtown most downtown offerings, but there is a reason that classics get to be classic."

The attention to detail, execution, creativity and service are world class. I especially appreciate it having lived in Texas for the past few years where the restaurant standards are quite different. Went there on a recent return to Chicago and a local friend who is on top of the restaurant scene took me as a special treat. It was a wonderful and memorable evening."

With 6:00 reservations, my husband and I rang the doorbell to be let in (yes, you read that correctly). The atmosphere is wonderful. The entire wait staff was wonderful. 

Best. Meal. Ever. I truly mean that. Here&#39;s our food night went. You decide if you want a 3, 4, or 5-course meal. You pick from categories like, Vegetable, Seafood, Meat and Dessert. You can have any one in any order...if you want dessert first, so be it! Even before our meal started, they gave us a small spring roll that I know had spicy mustard and not sure what else, but was it delicious!! 

1st Course: Husband: Spinach salad with Brie; Me: Asian Pear Salad...Both amazing, but I&#39;d say the spinach and brie won my vote. 

2nd Course: Husband: Two cheese perogi ; Me: Potato Gnocchi. The cheese pirogi was on a bed of what I think was a meat pate. Potato Gnocchi was heavenly, as it had fresh corn, green beans and leeks in a cream sauce...divine! 

3rd Course/Entree: Husband: Tempura Soft Shell crab over a bed of rice. Me: Beef Trio (Short-rib over salmon patty, Fillet over cheesy polenta, Strip steak over thinly sliced potatoes. If you like beef, YOU MUST GET THIS!!! Best fillet I&#39;ve ever had and the short ribs were out of this world. 

4th Course/Dessert: Husband: Chocolate Quintet (Chocolate tower, chocolate souffle, chocolate pudding, banana crepe with chocolate filling, and some kind of chocolate cake. Me: The Assortment (Chocolate souffle, white chocolate crepe, raspberry creme broiler, berry crisp and apple tart). WOW. Why get only one thing for dessert?! Get the assortment (chocolate or regular). The chocolate souffle was like the richest hot chocolate, but in cake form. 

Everything is absolutely fresh. The breads are homemade. You can really see and taste that they value good ingredients and good food. This can definitely be any suburban (or city) dwelling&#39;s 5 star restaurant. Our bill was a little over $200 with tip, but well worth the price. Unless you have that kind of money to spend all the time, definitely get at least the 4 course meal to try the wonderful creations at Tallgrass."

First it&#39;s a long way to go for us, so it takes a good reason to get us to drive to Lockport. More importantly they do fine dining very well and it&#39;s all at a great price. The place is tiny, at least from what we could see, with only seating for about 30.
The food was excellent, and I got off to a great start with a small taste 5-appetizer plate. It gave me a good sense of the chef&#39;s range. One of the standouts was the lobster lasagna - light, strongly flavorful, and a bit sweet. In fact, the entire meal had a pervasive sweetness. My pork tenderloin with prosciutto had plenty of flavor, but it was also sweet with a reduction sauce on the plate. After four courses I barely had room left for the amazing chocolate tower which was amazing.
Lockport itself is a cute little river town, and I expect that we&#39;ll return in the daylight to check it out."
tallgrass-restaurant-lockport,Carrie H.,A0uUf3hf22H0hR3iFq9TWA,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,0,54,114,XlrIRzJFfXphfcSl4UehiQ,5.0,2008-02-04,"Tallgrass, named after the Illinois prairie grass in Lockport, IL, is a refreshing, almost rebelliously good, four star restaurant. No snobbery served here. It&#39;s all about local fresh food served gourmet and fine art to complement the dining experience. When seated, I immediately noticed a note on the table that explained the connection we have to our food and that they serve food consciously. That is, food that has been raised organically, ethically, and locally. Chef Bob even suggested a fantastic book on this subject, &#34;The Omnivore&#39;s Dilemma.&#34; This awareness was reflected in the friendly and health conscious servers. The matre d&#39; was a nutritionist and (much to my pleasure) gave my Dad a playful lecture about dumping saccharine in his espresso. Our waiter competed annually in the Iron Man competitions. They certainly practice what they preach.

The place was tastefully decorated preserving the 1895 Victorian charm of the building. The china and vases are proudly collected and created by Chef Bob Burcenski. The sparkling crystal and pretty china actually make the food and drink taste better. Chef Bob has a BFA in printmaking and a MFA in painting and is the 25 year head organist at Presbyterian Joliet church- who is this guy, God? 

The co-owner of the restaurant is Tom Alves, the wine expert, more specifically, an oeneologist. He ensures a perfect selection of wine from small west coast wineries, Italy, and France. Here is a testament to his honed palate: I usually hate chardonnay and the chardonnay my Mom drank was irreproachable- something I never thought I would say about a chardonnay. I&#39;m more of a pinot noir, pinot grigio, or dry Riesling drinker. Tom has a BFA in English and Music and advanced studies in music education. In his free time he manages chamber music concerts, naturally. These men, the A-team of the culinary world, make other restaurant owners tremble in their slip-resistant safety clogs.

The Food.

When selecting food, here are some general tips. Choose local foods when possible. Local foods taste fresher, support your local economy, and reduce our dependency on gasoline. What would taste fresher: fish shipped 180 miles from Wisconsin or fish shipped 2,800 miles from Alaska? Choose the less processed option. Fresh fruits and vegetables burst with flavor and give you energy. The sugar, salt and fat in processed stuff kills taste buds and our bodies. Lastly, put some green on that plate. Greens and pepper help you metabolize the food better bringing balance to the meal. What is good for the palate is good for our health.

For a first course, I chose a trio of soups: pumpkin orange, white bean asparagus, and lemon cauliflower. Very creative combination of flavors and simple enough that it was not overwhelming. The painterly presentation reflected Chef Bob&#39;s artistic background.

Second course: Steamed asparagus on semolina gnocchi topped with arugula, sprinkled with pine nuts, and lightly drizzled with a scallion vinaigrette. This was my favorite dish; a perfect balance of green goodness, protein, healthy fat, and complex carbohydrates. Bravo. My Dad ordered a beet salad: thinly sliced beets topped with feta and walnuts- wow! Simple is best.

Main course: Wisconsin trout served on a multigrain concoction in butter sauce. They lost me on this dish. The fish was high quality, but the Chef was overly generous with the butter giving it a heaviness that nearly drowned the fresh quality of the fish. The multigrain pilaf was forgettable. This plate needed green on it to lighten the heaviness and balance the flavors.

Dessert- flourless Belgian chocolate torte, vanilla mousse, raspberries, dark chocolate walls, and raspberry sauce on the side. What makes chocolate better? RASPBERRIES! I could lose the vanilla mousse. Anytime raspberries get near chocolate, my stomach starts to throw a welcome party. There was too much happening on the plate, so it is definitely a dessert to share.

Beverages: A note on Lockport water- it has a high mineral content that leaves a bitter aftertaste. This was the case with the water and hot tea. I recommend having something from the bar- the iced tea was perfect- freshly brewed and served in a cut lead crystal glass reminiscent of the Victorian era that the restaurant proudly preserves.

I was thoroughly impressed with Tallgrass. It is pricey- $48 for a three course meal, $58 for four courses, $68 for five courses."

The &#34;crab&#34;onara was creamy and rich without being over the top and the short ribs had a wonderful texture with just a touch of acidity.

My boyfriend describes me as &#39;Tholerant Tholly&#34; because he thinks I can take way too much before breaking.  Tallgrass has left be me broken.

The boyfriend made a reservation for Friday, February 13th.  Friday the 13th!  What was he thinking?  Well, he was thinking we&#39;d try the new Zagat &#34;29&#34; for Valentine&#39;s Day.  The Zagat description was great.  The website&#39;s food looked delicious.  And well, the Yelp reviews so far are fabulous.  I suppose we should have realized that we were really dealing with Friday the 13th.

The menu is a small plates-style.  Pick the number of courses from a variety of areas -- think Graham Elliot, I suppose, for a flat fee w/ some upgrades.  We decided to do the five courses.  I went with the lamb as my main course (4th).  He went with the veal tenderloin (4th).  Our other courses were a trio of soups (both-1st), tuna/scallop (him-2nd, 3rd), shrimp/crab (me-2nd, 3rd) and then a tasting of desserts.  

What a disappointment.  The soups were OK at best.  I didn&#39;t love the flavor combination.  Perhaps the worst part - the waiter asked me if I wanted any black pepper.  I said, sure, of course, and he proceed to grind black pepper... and continue.. so that when I ate my soup... all I could taste was black pepper.  This nearly ruined one particular soup.

My 2nd course, a shrimp dish, was pretty, but, wow, let&#39;s just say that when the boyfriend tasted it he said, &#34;Tastes like something at Taco Bell.&#34;  Basically, yeah - meaning - it tasted good... but it was nothing unusual.  I could have paid .79 cents for it at Taco Bell.

My 3rd course, a crab &#34;cake&#34; beignet, was nice.  The crab tasted fresh.  But again, I found the overall plate extremely boring.  The flavor was not memorable.  

I enjoyed my lamb dish.  It was middle eastern inspired - with a yogurt and served over couscous.  But the boyfriend thought his gnocchi tasted as though they had been boiled from a bag.  I think he ate maybe four bites of his veal.

The desserts, again, were OK.  My apple dessert was extremely sweet--too sweet for me.  It was, however, the boyfriend&#39;s favorite.  He pretty much ate it whole.  That&#39;s ok - I cleaned the chocolate souffle ramekin.  

In hindsight, I should have sent back my second course.  He probably should have sent back his entree.  And, granted--we could have gone on a wrong night.  We could have ordered the wrong food.  We could have had our expectations set too high.  But for the amount of effort, cost, etc., we were expecting at least something unusual and different.  Instead, we got boring, Taco Bellish, disappointment and more boring.

We will not be going back."

This is a special occasion restaurant and they clearly have lost sight of taking care of customers.  Given their very limited wine list (about a half page of red wines), I brought two bottles of very special wine for our party of 4 fully having to pay a corkage fee which i have done at this restaurant in the past as well.  Upon being seated, we were told there was a 1 bottle limit per table (no mention of size which suggests we may have been better off having each couple sit separately).  I politely asked if they could open the second one and was promptly told it was against the restaurant&#39;s policy even though I was more than happy to pay the $20 corkage fee.  In fact, the manager/owner &#34;Tom&#34; who was referenced by the staff did not extend the courtesy of coming out to speak to us.  The food, while still good has also dropped in quality ranging from a dry lemon cake to several items which now carry a surcharge on top of the prix fixe tariff. I suggest thinking twice before visiting."

The atmosphere is very quiet with mirrors all around in the downstairs (probably so you don&#39;t feel claustrophobic), and the upstairs has a couple more tables then the downstairs, but if I had to guess this place couldn&#39;t sit more then 50 people between the two stories. I like how you buzz in to enter and the staff is very proper. Now the best part the food! You can choose from 3 to 7 courses from $48-$78 respectively. Not cheap but very impressive for the burbs! This chef is passionate about what he does and you can tell in the presentation, the flavors that are combined, and the methods used to prepare each dish. I would put this restaurant in the top tier of restaurants with any one in downtown Chicago. It&#39;s a bit out of the way, but if you are willing to look past the cost for one night it&#39;s a great meal and they have an extensive wine menu as well. Highly recommend!"

I cannot rave about this place enough!

We did have to wait a while to be seated, but that was to be expected on a busy Friday night. But boy, were we in for a treat! Everything was excellent, from our server (Mia, you rocked and made us feel right at home!) to the drinks to the meal. This place has a unique vibe, and the building itself had its own persona. 

The four of us split crab cakes and alligator tail for apps. And the boyfriend and I split their fried green tomato BLT for dinner. The food, while I wouldn&#39;t say is 100 percent authentic...is DELICIOUS. The flavors were all banging, and each dish seemed to be this establishments personal spin on Cajun favorites.

Fried oysters look huge but they are all breading and the oyster is about the size of a dime. Also they had no flavor. And also, what&#39;s with the obnoxiously loud music for such a small place? I go to heavy metal and death metal concerts pretty often and yet I can&#39;t wrap my brain around why the owners think blaring music is a good idea in such a tiny place.

We arrived and stood in the doorway until the hostess showed up about two minutes later. After asking how many in our party, she told us it would be a moment as she had to go clean a table for us. Don&#39;t they have buss boys to handle that? She came back a few moments later to seat us- at the table right by the kitchen/restroom hallway. Ugh. 

We browsed the menu for a few moments until our waitress showed up. She was a super sweet, friendly girl. She asked us what we wanted to drink but then noticed we weren&#39;t given a drink menu. She snatched one off of an adjacent table and gave us a moment to look it over. 
I went with my standard beer as I wasn&#39;t here to have my dinner in liquid form. Husband decide to try the do-it-yourself Bloody Mary bar. He was pretty disappointed, as they only garnishes available were olives and pickles. Maybe other options were available earlier in the day and were put away as the dinner crowd arrived.

We chose the Corn Crusted Alligator Tail as our appetizer, which did not disappoint. The jalapeno honey sauce served for dipping was so flavorful and had just the right amount of spice.

I was torn on making a decision for my entree, so I settled on the Muffaletta and my husband picked the Pirogue. The flavors of the muffaletta are good but I wasn&#39;t crazy about the bread (they use a tomato focaccia). Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love that kind of bread but not for a muffaletta. I subbed fried okra for my side and was a bit disappointed with it; many of the pieces must have been harvested too late as they were woody, tough, and stringy. After literally choking down a few pieces and attempting to discretely removing the strings from between my teeth I gave up on them entirely.

M wasn&#39;t too crazy about the Pirogue and didn&#39;t really touch his ribbon fries.

The drinks and food were brought out in an acceptable amount of time. It may have been a bit slow but it was late Sunday afternoon so where the hell were we rushing off to, anyway? I can certainly see why it would be frustrating during peak hours, though.

The positives?  Again, the waitress- she was wonderful and didn&#39;t go MIA for extended periods of time. I enjoyed the decor; yes it&#39;s kitschy but I didn&#39;t feel that it was over the top. The atmosphere was enjoyable except for the occasional bumping and jarring from patrons and waitstaff try to access the back of the restaurant. 

I&#39;d consider going back to try a few other items but in the alternative I&#39;ll stick to Heaven on Seven, Pappadeaux, or New Orleans proper if trip #3 is in the cards."

The only other place that comes to mind is Heaven on 7 in Naperville.  While this place is slightly better, it&#39;s still a bit too pricey.  Daily drink special do help bring in customer&#39;s, so the place is usually on the more crowded side.  If you do take advantage of the specials, don&#39;t stray as your tab can quickly accumulate.  The food is very good, but again pricey.  The appetizer skewers and gator bites are great and you can&#39;t go wrong with any burger.  Big fan of the brussel sprouts as well."

On a week-end it was very lively in late afternoon with the loud bar music spilling out into the restaurant area. 

We started with the Kabrit Fromaj appetizer: bruleed goat cheese atop cajun cream sauce, with garlic bread. Wish there was more of that toasty surface area because it really offset the goat cheese tang. And that cajun cream: whoo, you better like it hot, because it be spicy, cher!

For entrees, I went straight up Southern rather than Creole and ordered fried chicken. This was literally half a chicken&#39;s worth (breast, wing, leg and thigh), perfectly crispy and not too greasy. It came with two sides: I got the caesar side salad (which was the size of a regular salad!! With a nice homemade dressing and crunchy croutons) and sweet potato fries (regrettably I forgot that these came dusted with cinnamon sugar-- it&#39;s just more like dessert to me! Fail). My companion got the shrimp po boy, which came with HUGE fried shrimp (none of tiny babies that usually turn up in these sandwiches), enough for two meals. 

So all the food was excellent; it was service where things kind of fell apart. We were seated and everyone was friendly at first, but then maybe it was because we had a meal that took a long time coming (menu says 45 minutes on the fried chicken) that we eventually got forgotten. Finally we were looking to wrap up and get boxes and the bill; our waitress kept blowing by and ignoring us, til finally I grabbed someone else. (We could also see six or seven waitresses crowding near the kitchen entry taking pictures every so often...a little less socializing and a little more attentiveness, please.) Finally our waitress came back, claiming that she didn&#39;t think we were done because there was still food on our plates. Um...well, we were hoping to wrap it up to go...ten minutes ago. 

Anyway, overall it was a good meal, and definitely still a place worth coming back to, but the servers just need to pay attention. Then Moe Joes will really have its mojo working!"

The first time I went for the drinks and the second time I actually tried the food. The second time I was with a party of about 12 and we had a $400+ bill.

SO DISAPPOINTING

Everything looks great on paper- boar burger, alligator, crawfish. They seem to have it all. I ordered the fried chicken po&#39;boy, expecting it to be Cajun-seasoned (or seasoned at all??) and covered in a Caribbean rum sauce that I ordered.

I got plain fried chicken tenders cut up on a dry piece of bread for $12.95. There was no Caribbean rum sauce and when I asked for some, I got mayo. We couldn&#39;t pay the bill for about 30 minutes because they don&#39;t split the bill and we were trying to figure out how they wanted us to do it. If they were as worried about delivering good food and good service as they were worried about cleaning our table and getting us out of there, maybe I&#39;d go there again.

I&#39;m so disappointed! I do not recommend!"

We also never received bread - even during the very long wait -- because they apparently ran out which no one bothered to mention.  By the time we got our food, we had to leave so we didn&#39;t get to enjoy it.   Disappointing.  The food is good and the waitstaff is friendly but I just can&#39;t tolerate waiting this long.

Okay so rewind: we walked in on a beautiful summer Saturday night, prepared to wait. We did, but only for a few minutes. We asked the hostess if there was a wait for seating outdoors and her response was, &#34;Well there&#39;s a waitlist, so you&#39;d have to.........wait.&#34; It was more comical than anything, but clearly all the staff was very busy and had too many things on their minds! Regardless, we were sat quickly. 

Half of my family is from the heart of Cajun country, so I get extremely excited - albeit anxious - every time I frequent a &#34;Cajun&#34; restaurant outside of Louisiana. In fact I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever had gumbo or a poboy at an establishment north of Louisiana that was worth going back to. This....now this, takes the cake. 

We splurged, based on previous yelp reviews, on the fried alligator ($15 app). I&#39;ve had it similar to an arancini previously, but never literally as pieces of gator. It did not taste like chicken and I loved it. Great texture, light fry, awesome dipping sauce. Also a huge portion, great for sharing probably with as many as four people!

Then...THE GUMBO. DROOL. I am now marking Moe Joe&#39;s as the best gumbo in all states minus Louisiana (okay well...from what I&#39;ve tasted thus far). Though a very thick roux, it was dark and smokey and spicy and overall amazing-ness. The &#34;cup&#34; was huge, and enough to share a few spoonfuls (though I didn&#39;t want to). It also came with cornbread, which was a nice surprise. 

When I first looked at the menu, I thought, how could someone come to a restaurant just eat a giant bowl ($12.95 entree) for dinner? Well, I figured it out. Had I not already ordered my poboy, I would have scooped up another bowl (not because I needed it, but because I wanted it). It had okra and Andouille as the front runners, and the flavor was amazing.

Next up was my poboy. Also delicious. I had the petite shrimp, and it was the perfect amount of fillings, but not difficult to bite into. Remoulade was spicy but creamy, but I do wish there was a bit more on there. Chips are on-point, but who has room for those??

Also as good as the gumbo: corn fritters! I had never had them before, and they&#39;re similar to a beignet, in that they&#39;re delicious and powdered sugar-y but they make you feel like maybe a bit healthier since they have corn in them? Ha! We saved the fritters as a dessert, and I ordered a coffee cocktail - this is the only menu item in which they did me wrong. Shortly after sipping, the cream curdled - or something happened that was gross - but our server took care of it and we didn&#39;t pay a penny of it. Apparently their coffee cocktails come from a Starbucks machine, so who knows what happened there. Blame technology.

Hubby had a burger. He was all set for the poboy, but the Wild Board Burger caught his eye - so at least he still ventured out! It had a great flavor to it but forewarning: there&#39;s a heavy crisp to the outside that may scare away anyone who loves their medium burgers.

Overall, service was a bit flighty, but they were packed. For all of the food - app, soup, side, two entrees, plus a bloody mary for me and a cocktail and beer for hubby, we paid $76 plus tip, and I was pleasantly surprised, it seemed like a good deal to us considering we got two meals out of the deal due to leftovers!"

He grew up on the eastern shore, so seafood is right up his ally and their menu did not disappoint. With that being said, there were a couple upsets, but the food alone will definitely have us coming back for more. Here&#39;s my rundown...

PROS
- Food, food, and food! The menu is a dream. We honestly had such a hard time deciding what to get. It&#39;s not often we&#39;re at a Cajun restaurant, so we were like kids in a candy store. 
- The gumbo is amazing! I&#39;m still dreaming about it. My husband and I each got a cup of it and it was super filling and delicious. So much so that we ended up only having 2 drinks each, the calamari app and the cup of gumbo. We so wanted to order more food and really dive into the menu, but we were honestly too full!
- They have a skinny cocktail menu! I had the cranberry lemonade drink and it was good. I didn&#39;t taste any alcohol though, and it was a little sweet for my taste, but overall a good option (and only 106 cals).
- Staff is really friendly. Not necessarily the quickest service, but very nice people to talk to.
- On Tuesdays they have comedy night in the downstairs part of the restaurant!
- Cool vibe at Moe Joe&#39;s! I like the bar/restaurant combo and the New Orleans theme is great. They also have an outdoor patio which is nice.

CONS
- Unorganized service. When we were finally sat at a table, the air conditioner was leaking on my head...Yeah. Not great. The hostess cleaned off another table for us and we were able to switch, but the bar was unfortunately packed, and that&#39;s where we wanted to sit.
- It took forever for someone to greet us. We eventually had to flag down a waitress and she just took our table since nobody had yet. 
- They were out of Gumball head! Everyone on Yelp raved about how they carry Gumball head and they were out of the beer when we were there of course...such a bummer.
- The calamari is just okay. We&#39;ve had better. It took a while for it to get to our table and when it did, we realized we still weren&#39;t given any silverware.
- The draft beers we ordered were lukewarm. 
- Hefty bill when we left (but the gumbo was worth it). For 2 cocktails, 2 beers, an app, and 2 cups of gumbo it cost us about $65 (plus tip).

I really had higher hopes for Moe Joe&#39;s, but maybe it was the B squad working since it was a Monday night. Who knows. Regardless, we plan to come back and give it another shot. Their menu is too good to be true and those frog legs are calling my name!"

The service was horrible. We had to go the bar to get drinks.  After sitting down for 45mins and receiving glasses of water, one round of drinks and a food order put in 10 minutes prior, we looked like the idiots.  Then we tried ordering from the bar and it was the same.  Finally, before deciding to leave, we addressed the server and instead of trying to help the situation, it was all attitude and she turned her back and walked away claiming she was a manager.  Nice service.  

And for the record I have been in the high paced restaurant and bar industry for ten years.  I understand the difference between being busy and being ignored."

First impressions:  this is the second worse sweet tea I have had in the Chicago area, and they serve it in a mason jar.  Not good.  The tea quality itself is good.  However, you&#39;re passing yourself off as a New Orleans style restaurant and you don&#39;t have &#34;Southern sweet tea&#34;? Heaven on Seven has good Southern sweet tea.  

It was &#34;all good&#34; from there on out. My side was a Caesar salad which was surprisingly excellent.  Why excellent?  You&#39;re getting a Caesar side...what do you expect?  Larger than a dinner salad and really good Caesar dressing.

My lady had a shrimp po boy while I had the oyster version of the same.  Oysters were fresh, fried to perfection.  Crystal hot sauce on the table.  

The music had Virginia dancing in her seat.  The wait staff was friendly and efficient.  Definitely going back...and there&#39;s a dessert and aperitif visit in there somewhere.

We were certainly willing to clean up our mess but got zero help from the staff. They threw some paper napkins at us and left us to clean up. I was wiping up their dirty floor by hand waiting for dinner. We did as best as we could with the brown paper napkins and were left to have dinner in a sticky disgusting mess. Thanks MoeJoes. 

How about moving us to another open table, there were plenty. With the prices they charge, they should think about the service. After this experience I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d go back.

I think people on Yelp don&#39;t get out much----and are really quick to pull out the word AMAZING.
Its not Amazing. Its pretty darn good and sticks to your ribs, though!!!
The food is authentic in its flavors. 
Its not over the top WOW,--- but the cooking styles are very home-cooked in their essence. Like a good file gumbo.
Iive eaten at a few places down in NOLA and also the other cajun places around here like Heaven on 7, pappadeaux, etc. So I think I have the cajun style and flavors kind of figured out.

However, &#34;good food&#34; doesn&#39;t automatically mean &#34;good restaraunt&#34;

The prices are a little high for what you&#39;re getting. 
21 bucks for a plate of jambalaya is a little steep considering its mostly a rice dish with slices of sausage.
The service is consistently ssssllllllloooooowwwww. Every time. Whether or not the place is busy. I&#39;ve been one of 5 people in the place during lunchtime and still wind up taking almost an hour.
If you&#39;re in a rush to eat call ahead and get it as a carry out item.

the cocktails are packed to the brim with ice and I felt like mine was gone in a few slurps.

It can be a fun place at night with a group, since the bar is kinda lively and they have live bands playing next door sometimes."

Over the past 10 plus years I have drooled over their menu. Their drinks are the BEST!
Having suggested work meetings there because I fell in love with everything at MoeJoes, I have the pleasure of saying I tried just about everything on the menu (yes, even the alligator)

You will never be disappointed as long as you understand these dishes are NOT fast food so have a seat, relax, have a gummy bear martini and Be Patient. It is obviously worth the wait and i will continue to go for the wonderful shrimp starter, their glorious crawfish etouffee, and the best ham steak and cheesy mashed potatoes. 

The portions are crazy generous and you will have to take home unless you come hungry.  Don&#39;t like that much food? Split it with your hunny that&#39;s what I HAD to do with their amazing &#34;resurrection burger&#34; it&#39;s just too much for little ole me but some strapping hungry guy will leave with a smile on his face and a super full belly.

Now MoeJoes is not only a good place for your Cajun fix, I hear it can get pretty rowdy on the weekends (if you&#39;re into that!)

The location and outdoor seating is great.  Main Street in Plainfield so you have plenty of action all over.  The inside is pretty dark but we always sit outside.

What we ate:

Appetizer

Fried green tomato on garlic crostini: A

    Very different app you rarely see anywhere.  Tomato was only slightly fried, they didn&#39;t over batter and it was really sweet.  

Lunch

Boar burger (apparently voted best burger in the area): B+.  
     Taste was great, but the burger was tough to eat, big and messy. I thought the boar was slightly dry too.  Overall a good burger tho!

Grilled shrimp Poboy: B. (My wife&#39;s vote!!)



Moe Joes is a unique, quality eatery.  Should be on everyone&#39;s lunch rotation!

At this point we had had enough &amp; asked to speak to the manager.  She had an attitude and didn&#39;t seem to care we were upset.

The hosts, waiters, and bartenders are all friendly.  The decor and a few of the menu items are a bit hokey but fun.  

My food preference is for their specialty: Cajun food like jambalaya, gumbo, etouffee, Po Boys, etc...the giant gator burger  interested me less.  There are several of the usual, non-Cajun appetizers/entrees as well for the less adventurous diners.  All the food, while not extremely original or novel, is very tasty, and the portions are ridiculously large - you will have leftovers.

The bar claims to have all sorts of rare beers and drinks, but they were out of every beer I asked for...very disappointing.

Overall very solid but nothing really remarkable.  I am sure I will be back at some point, but this will never become a &#34;go-to&#34; restaurant/bar for me."

The toppings and flavors combined wonderfully, it was ranking in my top 5 burgers of all time, it was a 5 star dish. However........

The second time it was still good but I think it was over cooked. The meat seemed dry, and I needed drinks to get down some bites. I was much less impressed.... 

Because the first was such a good experience I will try a third time, I hope it resembles the first visit.

If you&#39;ve never been to New Orleans and have no prior experience with this style of cooking, then you will very likely rate Moe Joe&#39;s much higher than those who have.  I&#39;ve visited this restaurant about once per year since they&#39;ve opened.  My experiences have ranged from the food being ok to being pretty bad.   When it was bad, it was because the food, such as the gumbo, was old and simply shouldn&#39;t have been served.  When it was ok, the food was fresher. I&#39;ve heard people rave about the muffaletta, which is an ok sandwich, though nothing like an actual muffaletta.  The service has typically been pretty good from my experiences and again, the decor is nice.

If I really wanted quality New Orleans style food, Maple Tree Inn in Blue Island is the place to go anywhere outside of Louisiana.  Additionally, Pappadeaux and Heaven on Seven are much better options (though Heaven on Seven is nothing like it used to be 10 years ago).  If I wasn&#39;t up for the drive to either of these, I&#39;d consider going here knowing that it will probably be ok, though not particularly awesome, with a chance of being pretty bad.

The bar is different than the restaurant.  The last time I was in the bar, I ordered a craft beer that they had on tap.  As a very experienced craft beer drinker, I could tell immediately that the beer was bad due to the tap lines not being clean.  I discretely brought this to the attention of the bartender who:.

1. Stated that nobody else mentioned it, which doesn&#39;t surprise me because there are many people who don&#39;t know what specific beers should taste like

2. Mentioned it to the manager a few moments later, though must have forgotten that I was the one who told her, because she did so in front of me and said it with a really crappy tone and insinuated strongly that nothing was actually wrong. 

I&#39;m sure the Miller Lite is awesome"

It was a gorgeous day outside, and my dinner plan was originally grilled cheese &amp; tomato soup (hellooo Chiberia!), but of course this was no longer favorable.  It was my birthday, so I suggested somewhere nearby for dinner.  I couldn&#39;t believe I suggested MoeJoe&#39;s, but I really was craving a po&#39; boy.

The alligator po&#39; boy, as previously mentioned, isn&#39;t as good as the others.  The fried shrimp po&#39; boy is really, really good.  The sandwich is huge, served on garlic French bread with tomatoes, lettuce, spicy remoulade (or a Caribbean sauce), and loaded with lots and lots of fried shrimp.  The sweet potato fries here are amazing - another massive portion, and I think they put cinnamon sugar on them.

They now have Three Floyd&#39;s Gumballhead on tap, that ALONE deserves a star.  There&#39;s a long cocktail list and several beers available.

All the waitresses were in Mardi Gras outfits and make up.  The hostess said there was an hour wait for a table, but it turned out to be less than that.  Since the bar area was crowded, we ducked out and went next door to wait for our table.

We were seated in the dining area downstairs next to the fireplace.  Unfortunately, the fireplace didn&#39;t generate that much heat and I was cold sitting by the door because it&#39;s very drafty.  Every time the main door opened upstairs, a new draft of cold wind would come down right by our table.  However, if you were at a table that&#39;s away from the door near the bar area, it was pretty hot on that side.  That&#39;s probably why they leave the door open to cool off the area.

The food was pretty good.  We had alligator bites, gumbo, alligator po boy and jerk chicken.  The alligator bites aren&#39;t really my thing.  They didn&#39;t taste like much and needed a lot of sauce.  The gumbo was really good and hearty.  A cup for $7 comes topped with a ball of rice.  Mix it all together first and dive in!  It had just the right amount of spiciness.

A reservation had been made.  Upon arrival, the hostess was MIA from the entrance.  Not many folks in the dinning room.  So my partner and I went to the bar as we were early for our group.  We noticed the hostess so we went back to the dining room to check in.  She was very friendly and quickly got the tables grouped together for us.  

The service was pretty strong, out the gate.  We were quickly greeted by a server who took drink orders.  As more members of our party arrived, she was swift with getting drinks to them as well.  We ordered some appetizers to start: Corn crusted Alligator tail, Fried Green Tomatos and Ka Brit Fromaj.  Before our appetizers came out, our server took our entrée orders.  It seemed to take quite a while to get our appetizers... no one really kept a clock on it, but it became noticeable even though we all were engulfed in conversation.  Not to disappoint, when we did receive them, all of it was quite tasty.  I was impressed with the Alligator and Fromaj... I never had fried green tomoatos before, but they were also very good.

For my entrée I was torn between the frog legs and crawfish etouffee.  I asked the server to help me break the tie and without blinking she stated the etoufee was her favorite on the menu... SOLD.  I&#39;ll tell you of all the times I&#39;ve ordered Crawfish etoufee, this is one of my favorites.  It was LOADED with crawfish and cooked to perfection.  Others at my table ordered the Jambalaya... I heard it was a bit on the spicy side as even my brother in law had a runny nose while consuming it.   There was an Alligator and Andouille Picante that had a warning for its spiciness... however that was mild in contrast to the jambalaya.  

Overall, the experience was pleasant.  One of the owners was making her way through the dining room checking in on tables and making conversation with guests.  It was a causal environment that did justice to the Cajun theme.

Last, but not least, their beer menu was great.  Even had a few Three Floyds on tap.

We definitely plan to come back and try some more off their menu."

The downsides. Yes it&#39;s loud. Sometimes they mess up your order. It can take forever when they get slammed. And, I&#39;ve never had a good steak here - don&#39;t bother.

Pork chops, fried chicken, gumbo, jambalaya, green beans with bacon, Brussels sprouts. It&#39;s all good here. Many times I ask to substitute pasta for rice to change things up.

My wife loves the tuna here and I&#39;m a big fan of the seafood jambalaya."

Server was a bit off. What was worse was that I saw my server later that night in her moe joes shirt at a bar just down the street. She was drunk, she told a server at the bar to &#34;fuck off&#34; and was cut off for being obnoxious and drunk. Classy. I love the food at moe joes, but the servers need some work.

Staff needs better training. Been going here for years now, moved to Plainfield in 2002, and the staff has never been w/o issue.

We wanted to try something different. It didn&#39;t disappoint!...well, mostly. We started with the alligator bites for an appetizer. They were so delicious! Especially with the dipping sauce! I had the Crawfish Étouffée and my hubby had the Wild Boar Burger. The étouffée was a-ma-zing! So many crawfish! And the flavors and spices were wonderful! Definitely recommend! Can&#39;t wait for my leftovers tomorrow! The hubby&#39;s burger was good too. It was huge...3/4lb!...and not gamey at all! Great flavors. Then for dessert, since we were celebrating our 10th anniversary we decided to go with the flaming banana dessert instead of the beignets. Bad move. First we waited almost 30 minutes for the dessert. Then the flame didn&#39;t catch on with the first shot of 151, so the waitress added another shot. We went to eat the dessert after the flame went out...and it was like eating pure alcohol. Not pleasant! We got a couple spoonfuls of the ice cream, but then had to send it back. It was inedible. Next time we are definitely getting the beignets. 
The service was a little slow too. They weren&#39;t that busy...but took us over 2 hours to eat dinner. Seems a little excessive. 
We will definitely go back though, and would definitely recommend this place to someone."

The atmosphere was great and the staff was very good.  First, I will warn you that parking is rough but that is because of downtown Plainfield (limited parking on the main strip).  Moe Joe&#39;s has the restaurant, bar and a speak easy (downstairs).  I went there on a Saturday night and the place was packed.  They have a great selection of craft/micro beers (especially if you like Abita) and wine.    They also had on tap &#34;3 Floyds Zombie Dust&#34;, which I love!!  Now this place is very busy, so if you are not a patient person I would not recommend you go here.  Their menu even tells you that some meals could take up to 45 mins to cook.  Their menu has a very nice selection of Cajun but also has burgers and steaks.  I had the &#34;Red Beans and Rice with Shrimp&#34;.  It was excellent!!  And our appetizer was Corn Crusted Alligator Tail which was really good too.  Just a heads up on something; they don&#39;t spilt checks.  I was shocked about this but the waitress offered to help figure out the totals for each party.  That is my only bad thing I have to say.  I would definitely recommend coming here.

Let me start off with the fact that none of the waitresses asked my friend and I if we needed to be seated or cared to help us to the basement (as we were clearly new and lost) for the comedy show. Once locating the basement we seated ourselves for the show. The majority of the show was rudely interrupted by the ignorant and not so funny bartender. She continued to yell out lewd comments &amp; eventually made it so uncomfortable, you could cut the awkwardness in the room with a knife. She got pretty hostile. The comedians were pretty funny &amp; were able to brush off the nasty comments the bartender was shouting out. 

After the show, we made our way upstairs for some drinks. I ordered a rum runner, and the bartender rudely said &#34;A Rum Runner??&#34;.. With that  face and awkward pause of silence and raised eyebrow, &#34;you&#39;re ordering a rum runner?&#34;.. I asked her if she knew what was in it, she said &#34;yes, I just haven&#39;t had anyone order it.&#34;.. She handed me the drink &amp; it tasted like straight Jagermeister. (it&#39;s definitely a fruity drink, not liquorice tasting. I think it was poor customer service to reply to a customer the way she did. As if it were a chore or offense to make the drink. I returned it, and asked a different bartender to make it, who seemed much more willing and kind enough to make it properly. 

I won&#39;t be returning. Too unpleasant."

We started 3 appetizers to share: the gator bites, the crawfish boil, and the friend green tomatoes. The gator bites were the best I&#39;ve had; not rubbery at all. The crawfish were good and had no potato filler- it was all crawfish with one corn in the cob on top. The fried green tomatoes were ok. Maybe like they were trying too hard. They were good but served in bread with some sauce on top. Just the tomatoes would have been fine. Most were happy with their main course. I got the tuna and it was fishy. I didn&#39;t eat it. The Mac and cheese was just ok. The beans were ok. One friend got the blackened catfish and he said it was great. I should have ordered that. Rise that ordered creole dishes like what they ordered. As the place filled up, service got worse. Our dirty plates were rarely cleared; some crawfish shells were still on the table at dessert time. We split the bananas foster type dish and the sweet potato pie with pecans. Both were good but we all agreed we wanted the pecan topping to be sweeter."

Had to wait an hour to be seated and while we waited, we could have gone over to the bar to wait ( but had my daughter with so that would be awkward) but was just as awkward sitting on the little bench in front of a full table of diners. Maybe a little half wall to separate the diners from those waiting so I don&#39;t have to drool at the food I&#39;m not yet enjoying. Once we were seated, our waitress came to take our order, ( she got the appetizer wrong, maybe because of the noise level) and was so busy that I felt we were bothering her every time she tended to our table. 
However, all of my first impressions went out the window once the food arrived.
 It was so heavenly, I would elevate this chef way above the one over at Heaven on Seven. For Cajun food, this is my new FAVORITE GO TO PLACE.

I first came here back in July 1988 when visiting a family friend, so a couple of years ago I brought my family here for a return trip.

At first, it appears outdated and well-worn, but the food is excellent and the staff very friendly. I kinda hope they don&#39;t ever remodel the place because I prefer the vintage outdated look. Too many restaurants look the same these days--Select is unique. I ordered the &#34;Select&#34; skillet with scrambled eggs/ham/veggies/hash browns. And, coffee of course. The food arrived quickly and was piping hot. Our waitress kept our coffee mugs filled. My wife ordered the breakfast burrito and my 3 kids all had pancakes. My skillet came with buttered toast which was very good. The kind of toast where the butter is melted into the bread and then you put your jelly on it. My skillet had great flavors and was plenty of food for the money. If I lived in the area I would definitely hit this place at least weekly. There was a good crowd here this morning which is very indicative of a great place to eat.

It is not far from us, but was a little tricky to find.  We showed up at an off hour, but even still - this place looked totally deserted.  We were a little apprehensive, but decided to try it out anyway.  First of all, the inside is not very nice at all.  It is obviously very old, but some of the wallpaper is water stained, the booths are ripped, etc.  It does seem clean though!  A sweet older lady welcomed us though, and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  

We ordered coffee.  Good coffee, but the waitress seemed a bit surprised when we asked for skim milk instead of half and half.  This (along with the clientele that we later saw), told us that this place was used to catering to the older crowd and probably a lower-maintenance crowd as well.  Even so, we decided to order our food.  I tried a cup of their cream of chicken and rice soup.  Pretty darn good!  It could have had a little more flavor, but it was nice and creamy and hot.  The chicken seemed to be of a decent quality too.  We took a look at the salad bar and decided to pass.  Everything looked a little watery, but I think this may have been because they were having a slow day.  We decided to order our entrees.  I asked the waitress if ours came with a bread basket.  She didn&#39;t really tell me if it came with one, but she quickly offered to bring one to our table.  She was very accommodating the entire time.  So, my spouse ordered the fresh fruit plate.  It looked pretty good.  It came with raisin toast, which I am pretty sure was the best raisin toast I have ever tasted.  They were big, thick pieces with just the right amount of butter.  I ordered the chicken cordon bleu sandwich.  The bun was nice and soft, and the chicken was very juicy and steaming hot.  The fries were a little bland, but I didn&#39;t mind.  Then, we found out that the fresh fruit plate came with dessert!  Awesome!  They had several different choices of ice cream to choose from, and another dessert or two.  We ordered the birthday cake ice cream.  Yum!  It was very good.  

So, this place will not impress at first glance; however, I would encourage everyone to give it a shot.  I am curious to know how their other food will be, but I have high hopes.  Also, as for the atmosphere - there is something kind of comforting about this place.  We will definitely be making a return trip."

They have a great digital menu with all your typical coffee shop offerings. Although I haven&#39;t tried any food here yet, I know they offer sandwiches and other snacks.

There&#39;s always a sign at the front counter that has their coffee of the day. The last two times I&#39;ve been, I got the cinnamon hazelnut coffee which is awesome! I really only put a splash of half and half in it because the coffee is already so flavorful. Bonus? A 16 oz coffee only cost me like $2!

If you aren&#39;t familiar with the Yellow Box Cafe, you should know it&#39;s located inside Community Christian Church (nicknamed the yellow box).

It&#39;s a great spot to grab a coffee or snack before service, but if church isn&#39;t your thing it&#39;s really just a great cafe to hang out at. They have plenty of seating, a fireplace, and outlets to plug in. I believe they close at 2 pm each day, so be sure to double check the hours if you&#39;re planning to stop in later in the day."

Initially I thought it a good restaurant until I had an issue. Once I got home to eat, I found a hair in my food. I only live across the street, so I called to let them know what happened. Alexis, who I guess is the manager, upon hearing me say there was a hair in my food said, &#34;OK, the only thing I can do is make you another gyro or give you 10% off your next meal here.&#34; Not once did she apologize for something disgusting like someone ELSE&#39;S hair in my food! 

I went back to Patelli&#39;s, she looked at the gyro, looked at me, then rolled her eyes and told the cook to make another one. Here&#39;s why this is important. I have a beard, a DARK, COARSE beard. The hair in my food was a thin black hair. She assumed I wanted to waste my time by seeing my own hair in my food and making an issue out of it. I don&#39;t do that sort of thing. My specialty isn&#39;t a free meal hair hustle or whatever people do nowadays to get over on companies. She was badmouthing me to the cook as I could tell how he looked at me once she walked over to him. 

Again, she never apologized for my experience. I remained calm though I was and still am very pissed about this situation and how it was handled. Rather than doing something unbecoming, I thought it best to let you all know to stay away from this place. Unsanitary, unapologetic and it will never see another dollar of mine. To the owner of this location, you&#39;d do yourself a favor by getting rid of Alexis. She is a TERRIBLE employee. I&#39;ll never come here again."

Damn, all burger establishments should figure this out! Burgers for Breakfast! Better yet, open at 6:00 A.M. You&#39;ll have Contractors, Truck Drivers, commuters, early risers and Aurora Public Works employees lining up at the door looking for a breakfast alternative.

The only problem...the food sucks here.

I have encountered a tasteless hot dog &amp; fries, a molten lava Philly Cheese steak that&#39;s impossible to eat and a Patty Melt hockey puck cheesy mess.

The counter employees are just looking for a pay check.

I ordered the cheddar and beef croissant, and even though I asked for hot peppers, I realized that there were not any by the time I got home.  However, the sandwich itself was decent, so that was the least of my problem.  What happened though, was that I ended up getting food poisoning the day after (on Christmas eve), which involved severe vomiting.  Two other family members of mine who went to Patelli&#39;s on the same day suffered a similar fate as well. Other people have complained about getting food poisoning from this place as well, so there is clearly some kind of sanitary issue going on. Because of my horrible experience, I will not be going back to Patelli&#39;s again.

I do have a word of advice for them though; make sure you meat is kept fresh, otherwise, customers will suffer from you actions."

I walked in and spent quite a few minutes browsing their menu. You&#39;ll find the standard hot dogs, gyros, etc but they also have a Mexican food menu as well. After a difficult decision between a few different menu items, I decided to give the Veggie Twister bowl a go, as it would be an easy eat-at-my-desk meal. I also ordered a size of fried pickles. 

I waited about 5 minutes for my order; not bad at all for lunchtime. While I waited, I noticed that the place was very clean, despite the place being full of people. They have a movie theme going on, which was unique. The employees were friendly and welcoming.

The fried pickles were great. I was expecting pickle slices, like you&#39;d get anywhere else. Not here; they deep fry whole spears! I was worried at first glance because they looked like (big) deep fried zucchini. But after taking a bite, I was pleasantly surprised to taste a delicious pickle. It was a nice change from your ordinary sliced fried pickles. A small order will get you five spears, and you also receive a side of Ranch for dipping.

The Veggie Twister bowl was a bit disappointing. I did not detect any green onions that were supposed to accompany it. The beans were quite watery, and coupled with the salsa (seemed to be along the lines of a jarred Pace or Tostitos salsa) the Twister Bowl was a bit of a hot mess, literally. The corn chips were nothing but a soggy mess by the time I got back to work. It was a big bowl of mush. It was still edible, though.

I&#39;d probably give this place another shot, especially for the Fiesta Gyros, Buffalo Chicken Wrap, and a few other goodies."

Pizza Puff - Very good, although all it requires is popping into a deep fryer.

Philly Cheesesteak - Good and at a good price. Very messy. I&#39;d go down the street to Great Steak &amp; Potato in the outlet mall though, theirs is much better.

Gyros - Tasty and a very good portion.

Chicken Gyros - I thought it was good, very moist.  I was disappointed when I got it home and it didn&#39;t have tzaztiki sauce on it :(

Bacon Cheeseburger - AWFUL! It was clearly a frozen patty that they charbroiled and tasted terrible.  The bacon was cheap and had no flavor. I will never get a burger here again!

Fries - Average. Don&#39;t taste like old grease which is a plus!!

All in all this is a good lunch spot.  The food is ready quick, they have free wifi, and the movie-themed décor is entertaining."

Food is outstanding however customer service is bad, bad, bad. Went in to the North Aurora store on our way back to the office in Batavia, IL and order couple burgers and a Patty Melt, got to Batavia office and no burger on patty melt. We were not going to go back.

Went back to the same store about 3 days later almost forgot to mention it however did remember before we were checked out and they still charges us for the new patty melt! Ask to see a manager in the middle of the day and none were available? Is the lunch  not their busiest time?

So all that said and done left a business card and asked to have one call me however that was 5 days ago and nothing yet.

Update! The owner/manager did call me on 8/26/2015, we talked and understood and did satisfy me with his answers, I feel they are just going thru some growing pains."

But i wouldn&#39;t recommend the Mexican food here. It&#39;s kind of bland with no flavor. I&#39;m from Aurora so i know the real Mexican restaurants but still it&#39;s better than taco bell if that floats your boat. The burgers are good and the fries they spoil you with. Cool inside but is kinda getting dirty but i don&#39;t blame them most employees you can tell have disabilities which is awesome cause gives them a chance other places don&#39;t give them. Would be a 5 star if had better dessert options. Prices are very reasonable too.

I think a few people give it such high ratings because, in this immediate area, we don&#39;t have a decent burger/beef/gyro joint.   If I give something 3 stars, I do like it and will continue to come to places I give 3 stars.  You have to be really exceptional or different for me to give 4 and 5 stars.

The closest fast food place, like this, is Goody&#39;s, on Farnsworth and that place is questionable, anymore.  Do I think it&#39;s as good as Portillo&#39;s? No.  Even though their sign uses similar font as Portillo&#39;s and their fries look like Portillo&#39;s.. the fries don&#39;t taste like theirs, but they are fine.  

I&#39;ve visited here a handful of times.  I&#39;ve had salads (always fresh and full of goodies - don&#39;t like the box croutons they put on it though), I&#39;ve had the beef (not my favorite beef, but completely fine),  the gyro and chicken gyro has a good flavor, tastes fresh and doesn&#39;t have questionable bone bits in it.  The one burger I tried was good.  The chili cheese fries are huge. However, I was not impressed with their burrito.  Just didn&#39;t taste authentic enough.  Wouldn&#39;t order anything from the Mexican portion of their menu again, even though the staff says their tacos are pretty popular. 

The place looks clean and has a cute, movie themed decor.  All of the young staff have been friendly and helpful.  I will continue to come here.  Now if they only offered a chocolate cake, like their competitor. ;)"

Kids are so happy with the kids meals and they&#39;re good portions for the kids. The fries are good especially with cheese. Fried pickles- AMAZING too!

Plus, within each of those categories, there are unique options like the Mexican burger that comes with guacamole.  Oh, and there&#39;s even desert.  I leave impressed every time.

To top it off, the service is super quick and very friendly.

The only complaint I have, and it causes me to limit when I go there, is the food odors.  Every time I go, I find that my clothes and hair and really my whole body just reeks of grease for the rest of the day.  Being that I work in a nice office and I meet with clients all day, I try not to go to Patelli&#39;s unless my afternoon is free.  And even then, I kind of gross myself out.

My sister lives in Vernon Hills.  I have driven by that location many times.  I heard their burgers were pretty good so while I was in the area I stopped off at the Lombard location at Yorktown Shopping Center and decided to give their burger a try.  Since the beginning of the year I have been a good boy eating healthier, but what the heck you need to eat something that you enjoy once in a while.  

The restaurant is very nice.  The signage on the outside clearly defines who they are similar to the Vernon Hills location.  As you walk in you come to the register immediately with the selection of burgers on a menu board above &amp; behind the cashier.  The cashier Bradley was very polite and pleasant and greeted everyone as they came to his cash register.   The restaurant is very nice, clean with a nice decor.  After you order your food you get a number &amp; grab a seat. The food came pretty quick within 5 minutes.

I ordered the 1/2 lb Ampersand Burger.  The burgers are hand formed and not a perfectly circular burger which is good instead of the pressed formed circles.   The Ampersand comes with Gouda cheese, applewood bacon, fried onion strips and an egg over easy on top.  The burger was pretty good, but was a little over cooked for my taste (I asked for medium rare and it was medium), add the bacon (bacon is good on anything), the Gouda cheese, fried onion strips (yummy)  and egg (it wasn&#39;t over easy).  I prefer the soft runny yolk (even if it is a mess).  

Overall their burgers are pretty good, but aren&#39;t in the same league as some of the premier burger places like Kuma, Brgrbelly or Boba Burger.  Still it is definitely worth trying just to experience a new place."

I understand there are a lot of choices, but when you charge over $3 extra for fries you are in a new category of burger joint in my opinion. Im expecting a WOW factor that just wasn&#39;t there. Thin buger patty, over crispy string fries just did not do it for me."

They offer kids meals, with organic drink options. The organic milk was poured into their plastic cups, (not a milk box) so they &#34;premade&#34; it. Daughter got chicken tenders w fries. Fries were tasty. THEY also had a cart of toys for kids to play with at the table! Super handy for a two year old who is antsy! Would be even better if they offered organic wipes for the toys/ little hands. 

$4 chocolate milkshake was a little intense $ but it came with whip cream and a big neon straw. Lower the price, please.

I ordered a burger - fries come separate. My burger had avocado, tomato, etc
Eh, was average. Could have been better, was looking for something more flavorful. More avocado maybe. 

Brad gave good service at the register, and recommendations.

Probably wouldn&#39;t stop in here again, unless I was at the mall craving a burger. Wouldn&#39;t go out of my way for it. Otherwise I would have gave 4 stars. Didn&#39;t have that special burger &#34;kick&#34; to it."

I had an awesome tuna burger with avocado and bacon.  Their price it&#39;s a little higher than a drive thru but cheaper than a sit down. You order at the counter and sit down, and they bring your food. Noon alcoholic drinks area available from a drink station. Alcoholic drinks are delivered to your table. There is dining room staff that clears your plates and checks on you.

Great experience... I will visit again!"

It simply is a better layout, fast casual concept and no odd waiter service for a burger. We walked in 20 minutes before closing and it was still 1/3 full and the staff was very friendly and helpful/

The pumpkin shake was really good, super thick and creamy. I usually try the seasonal since they are so limited with the time you can try them.

Our burgers and sweet potato fries were hot, perfect and tasty. I really think the best bun choice here is the sesame seed it tends to taste the best with a burger.

They also have two brothers on tap to make my husband even happier."

This was my first time at this restaurant so I had no idea how the number system worked.  The lady behind the cashier asked if I knew how it worked so I replied &#34;no&#34; so I could find out.  Apparently no meant yes that day because she moved onto the next customer leaving me to figure it out on my own.  The numbering system is not hard, but why bother asking if you&#39;re not going to respond.  

Next came the food which I will agree the burger was good, but the coat was higher compared to similar establishments.  I was really disappointed with the onion rings, they were more like onion strings.  They were soaked in oil which made them not enjoyable and left on the plate for the trash.  I will not be so fast to return."

I ordered the south of the border, and it has too much oil falling, the bread breaks very easy making a mess that you have to eat with fork.

The burger was OK, not good just OK, better than MC Donald&#39;s, but not even close to IN-N-OUT

Prices rounds the $7 to $11 for the burger only, if you want fries and soda add $4.50 more 

Quick ordering system, fries are good, not salty which is good I don&#39;t like too salty.

Great selections of ketchup and mustards"

I just spent almost $50 on lunch for 4 ppl. I had the chicken Capri sandwich which cost $7.50 and came with nothing. It was on a small ciabatta roll. My daughters ordered chicken finger sandwiches which were almost $6.00 each and also came with nothing. We had to order side orders of chips at $2.50 each.  My husband&#39;s burger is the only one that came with a side of fries. And don&#39;t forget we needed to order drinks too! I couldn&#39;t believe the prices! And the food was mediocre at best. 

Additionally, there are signs on the doors advertising free wi-fi. There was no free wi-fi. The guest wi-fi required a password and there were no signs anywhere saying what the password is. Therefore, that&#39;s not free wi-fi. 

We were there for lunch at 1pm on a Friday afternoon and there was only a handful of people in there. Perhaps it is the prices that are deterring customers. I know that&#39;s why we won&#39;t ever go back."

I am in the food business, make millions of burgers a week amongst other stuff and love burgers, thought I don&#39;t eat them very much. So tonight as a reward, I decided to pig out and treat myself to a delicious burger, fries and a shake as I heard so much about Tom and Eddies, much of it true.

Yes, the people are exceptionally delightful, charming, friendly and accommodating.

Yes, the restaurant, fun welcoming and very clean. They have a fun condiment bar with exotic some locally produced exotic mustards, hot sauces and other stuff. There is a book and toy rack, a contemporary retro diner feel, big windows and easy parking.

The chocolate malt shake with chocolate ice cream and sweet potato fries were excellent. The fries were hot, crisp, and not greasy  They have about 8 exotic custom burgers on the menu (and I believe chicken and other stuff)  they are on trend with a simple menu board and burger build profiles such as truffle mayo, caramelized onions, exciting cheeses, spicy flavours, fun ingredient combos etc. I couldn&#39;t customize, or if so I wasn&#39;t aware of that but that was ok cause the choices looked delicious.

But what about the burger?  Well, maybe I have eaten too many burgers in my day, set my expectations too high or got there too close to closing when people were getting tired but I found it to be interesting but didn&#39;t get the &#34;whoa&#34; wow factor I was anxiously anticipating.  While overall quite tasty, I found the burger  a little too thin,  crumbly and the bun too chewy, overwhelming the flavor of the meat. Toasting the bun may have helped but that may not have been the texture or mouthful they were going for with this build. That said, what I ordered was a special burger of the month and not their core menu so maybe they didn&#39;t dial this burger bun pairing as tightly as they do  for their regular items, not that that&#39;s an excuse, for what I paid, it should be. 

Given the explosion of outstanding gourmet burger joints all over Chicago, and the country,  I would rank them solidly in the middle of the pack on the burger and towards the top on other components of the total experience. But, when you tout yourself as the &#34;Greatest Burger in the World&#34;, you need to deliver that 24/7

I will be back with an open mind as I believe they deserve it."

We dined in and it wasn&#39;t packed at all. Our orders came out in no time. Fries seemed to be a little too hard. My burger was medium, which in my error I didn&#39;t tell them well done, luckily the pink didn&#39;t bother me. The burger didn&#39;t wow me like the other location previously did. Not sure if it was because it was a busy lunch rush &amp; the food was super fresh,  but I wasn&#39;t wowed 2day. My friends burger was also very sloppy.

I did the make your own burger, I had a large burger with avocado, onion stack, garlic aioli, it should have had swiss cheese but that was not on it for whatever reason, I think they forget. I also had the garlic fries. My husband had the Blue chip burger large as well with sweet potato fries.
The burger was really good but was more medium well than medium which is how I asked for it plus they forgot the swiss cheese and I don&#39;t like to send food back so I just let it go.
My garlic fries were amazing, fresh, hand cut and full of garlic. Just loved them.
My husbands burger was good however his sweet potato fries were so salty that he couldn&#39;t eat them and he never sends anything back.
The place was clean other than tables that need to be cleaned and the young girl at the counter was very sweet.
I would go back since I am in love with the fries and next time I will make sure it is cooked the way I like it and that they don&#39;t forget my cheese. My husband I am not so sure since he felt it was pricey and since he didn&#39;t eat his sweet potato fries it kind of put him off."

I got the regular sized Blue Chip burger and it was more than enough for a late brunch.

The patty is seared nicely but lacked the juiciness and flavor of B&amp;B. My main gripe is that the bun comes non-toasted and overwhelms the flavor of the patty, so I ended up taking off the bottom half of the bun. The potato chips added a nice crunch to each bite while the fresh avocado slices and creamy bleu cheese brought everything together.

The onion straws were thin, delicate, crispy and packed with flavor (extra black pepper?). The sweet potatoes were also good, but standard. Great service, by the way!"

CONSIDER THIS IS A FAST FOOD PLACE FOR THE MOST PART

MENU - nice options but limited choices = 4 stars
PRESENTATION OF FOOD - a nice surprise with the real cutlery and plates = 5 stars
GREEN attitude - love there is little waste - less for landfills - 5 stars
PROGRESSIVE attitude - organic ketchup on the tables - very cool - 5 stars 
CLEANLINESS - very clean and tidy - 5 stars
DECOR / ATMOSPHERE - 5 stars ---  they even have  toys for kids and books for solo diners.  
PRICE -  decent sized salad with chicken for under $10 - = 5 stars
FOOD QUALITY and TASTE = 4.5 stars -  again this is FAST FOOD and my salad came with a perfectly cooked egg on top, with a sliced roll and a parmesan chip - so pretty and good! 

My overall is 4 stars because it&#39;s not fine dining ....  but for fast food it&#39;s pretty worthy.  
Again - based on 1 experience ...   I will be going back for more.

The soda fountain had some weird choices but it was a nice mix up from your usual coke and Pepsi.

I&#39;m impressed with the upgrades/updates to their menu. I&#39;ve always thought the staff of Tom and Eddie&#39;s were especially good at gathering customer feedback and I think they really listen.

I&#39;ve had trouble finding what I really love here so this hasn&#39;t become a regular place for me. My husband and parents love it, though. 

I like the look and feel of the restaurant. It&#39;s unique, comfortable and cool. 

I kind of miss their old french fries- they now offer fresh cut fries which I know they are better for you but I&#39;m just not into them. I still love their haystack onions and think they are my favorite anywhere- they aren&#39;t too spicy which I like.

The selection of sauces near the drinks is pretty cool and a nice touch. My husband likes the spicy ketchup. I like the assortment of drinks and love Boylan&#39;s root beer. 

My husband tried a new shake- Irish Creme Coffee shake- and thought it was delicious. 

I tried a new sandwich I&#39;d never had before- the Dixie Fried Chicken Sandwich- and really liked it. It&#39;s a thin breaded chicken breast (I think it&#39;s marinated in pickle juice?) and had house-made dill pickle mayo which was unique and added great flavor, topped with lettuce, tomato and onion and served on a soft and tasty sesame seed bun. Very good!

We were really impressed with the person who took our order- Sara- she was very helpful and had a great attitude. Excellent service!

The set up is you walk in, give them your order, fill up your drinks, and find a table. They bring you your food and find you with the # they give you. To eat we both had the Sriracha burger on special and shared large fries. The burger was pretty good; grilled onions along with the Sriracha sauce - a type of hot sauce from Thailand. Maybe they can add more meat to the patty. The large fries are for 2-3 people, they are traditional hand cut.

Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s changed that. I ate the whole thing. Bun, fries, and milkshake. All of it. I&#39;m not sure if it was the friendly staff that made my stomach such an inviting chasm. Or maybe it was just that gosh darn delicious. I&#39;d have to say it was a combination the two.

Parking was easy. The space was bright and cheery and clean. The people were genuinely pleasant - welcoming. The food was good. I was able to walk off some of the meal in the Yorktown Mall afterward.

I had the Blue Chip Burger although I think I would have preferred some of the others instead. They all had scrumptious descriptions. Even though I somehow managed to devour all of my food, I can&#39;t honestly say that it was the best burger of my life. Naw... But it was good and somehow inspiring."

Burger was delicious - I built my own: double meat, Swiss and American, egg sunny side up, bacon, and house BBQ sauce. Fries were pretty good. Build your own float was great, they have some excellent sodas, made with real cane sugar. With all my extras, my meal came to almost $20... A hair under $15 is probably more the norm. They also have a great selection of fairly unique condiments. 

Service was crazy-fast. There weren&#39;t too many people in line, and I got my food in about 5 minutes. Staff is really friendly, too. I also like the cleanliness and cool touches like a tower of toys to keep kids busy. Definitely recommend."

We happened to be in the area and remembered that there was a location nearby...luckily our GPS did not let us down.

We walked in for a late lunch and service was really fast.  We ordered our burger medium rare but it came out well done.  I talked to the manager and he had them make us a new burger.  I would like to say, &#34;Thanks to Trevor (the manager) for making everything right with our visit here!&#34;  Customer service is so important and Trevor went out of his way to keep us as happy customers.  In all of my visits to Tom &amp; Eddies the customer is very important to them and it is this kind of attention to service which is going to make this business successful.

We also learned that this location is going to start serving fresh cut french fries.  That sounds so good...I love fresh fries...this is going to take them up another notch in the quality of there food.

This locaiton did not have the cool 120 plus soda machine like Deerfield and Vernon Hills but that did not matter to me becaue I did not order a drink.  They did have the Boylan&#39;s flavored soda&#39;s which are amazing on there own too."

I do like their main table that faces the open kitchen.  You can watch people cook while you&#39;re eating.

Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s remains a bastion of quality and deliciousness, and is a top pick for a quality burger anywhere -- and especially in the quick-service category.

They&#39;ve revamped the menu some since first opening, so sides are now separate but you can make it a combo for pretty much the same price it was before. They&#39;ve also added both some lower-cost (smaller?) and higher-end (not much more) options. But never fear, you can still build-your-own to your heart&#39;s content. (And, I forgot to mention, they DO have pretzel rolls now! Yay!)

I&#39;ve experimented with both their ideas and mine, and pretty much everything has come out delicious. I recently tried the &#34;Philly Mess&#34; -- the &#34;mess&#34; being their new takes on sloppy joes. I always hated sloppy joes as a kid, but this was very tasty, none of that fakey sweetness, just flavor, plus caramelized onion and provolone. Yummy.

Their salads are full of delicious fresh ingredients and the milkshakes are awesome (and came in handy when I had a wisdom tooth out recently).

All in all, Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s remains a winner."

Along with a number of burger concoctions on the menu, every diner has the option of building their own burger, choosing everything from the ingredients, the slab of meat (you can order a veggie patty or a chicken breast for the more health conscious) to the type of bun. I ordered a cheeseburger with fresh mozzarella, and it did not disappoint. The burger was juicy, and the fries were very good too, albeit a little thin for my liking. My total for a burger, fries, and fountain drink came out to just under $15- considering I got my food in just under ten minutes and everything was hand made, it trumps any chain sit-down restaurant as a viable lunch option.

The serving staff is always very friendly and makes a real effort to make sure your visit is a satisfying one. I work about 5 minutes away from here and would highly recommend it to anyone who happens to be in the Yorktown Mall/Oakbrook vicinity."

The burgers are decent sized and the sides are plenty. My husband and I usually share one side since we find it&#39;s a lot of food otherwise.

It&#39;s fine... it&#39;s you know... a burger.  The onion rings leave something to be desired with their shoe-string selves, but personally I like big chunky onion rings.  BUT, let&#39;s talk about *my* favorite, the Burger Primavera. Those caramelized onions, the roasted tomatoes.... that sweet sweet love pair... and THEN you throw on avocado, basil pesto and garlic aioli.... and suddenly the burger goes up a whole new level. The skies open, angels sing, and unicorns poop rainbows and glitter, and the whole time you are sitting there, eating this delicious bitch of a fast food burger and you think, F-yeah man, this is awesome and my day is now complete.

And they are pretty well done, and you see your husband reach over the table to take--I mean, share--in their goodness, and you think &#34;Yes, this must be true love to share the little orange sticks of magic.&#34; And at the end, everything is right in the world, especially as you run a sweet potato fry through the drippings of the aioli and pesto on the plate. *Snaps out of it* Oh, and the milkshakes are pretty darn good too.

Right on the inside you see ugly green chairs and an attempt at &#34;trendy&#34; decor on the inside. Located in the food area of Yorktown mall the place is very clean on the inside and extremely stylized. Having been tipped off that they have a hot dog here, I was anxious to try it.

In visiting there were two different kinds of hot dogs a &#34;Windy City Jaimacan&#34; dog which seems closer to a traditional Chicago style hot dog, and a Holy Hot Dog which is an attempt at a spicy dog. I decided to go for the Windy City style.

The hot dog I received came on a poppy seeded bun. The bun appeared to be toasted and had the texture of it. The hot dog was actually cut in half so a lot of the juices you typically find in a hot dog were missing. This dog appeared to have been skinless prior to being slices in half. There were regular hamburger style sliced pickles on it rather than one long pickle, good relish, nice tomato slices and sport peppers. Overall this wasn&#39;t a bad flavor combination though the sausage itself suffered from having been cut in half. The big problem here was the price, this regular size hot dog was over four dollars with tax, if it were an amazing hot dog that might be acceptable, but it wasn&#39;t. If it came with fries or something else, it might be okay, but that wasn&#39;t the case either.

Overall I was not at all impressed with Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s. The entire aesthetic of the place was very sterile and I found it to be quite off-putting. One other noteworthy complaint I have is that when you sit at your table you push a card into a pager which produces a rather loud high pitched beep repeatedly. Why they chose to use an ear piercing, migraine inducing system for determining where patrons are seated is beyond me. While my food was decent enough, it seems like you&#39;re paying a premium for their ugly decor and location. Considering the price I&#39;d say avoid the hot dog here unless you&#39;re wanting to try an unusual variation on the traditional dog that doesn&#39;t knock it out of the park. Two stars for Tom &amp; Eddies, it might be some people&#39;s cup of tea but it&#39;s not mine."

We both opted to build our own burgers and I&#39;d have to say this is the best BYO burger I&#39;ve ever had. If you&#39;ve ever had truffle fries or chips before and like them, you HAVE to add the truffle mayo to your burger. 

The fries are also delicious, they tend to pile on quite a bit so we were barely able to make a dent in the pile, but they were delicious.

Care and creativeness can be seen in all aspects of Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s, and we did not leave dissapointed. Since this is a new concept for everyone, having menus to read while waiting in line would be great! We snagged some take out menus that happened to be lying on the windowsill, but everyone seemed to be asking where we got them from and where more could be had! 

Burgers come with your choice of a side and sadly they were out of sweet potato fries, but their thinly cut Haystack Onion slices were still excellent! Besides their signature burgers, you can build your own, or order a healthier edamame or turkey burger, nice salads, or try their Hawaiian Chicago Hot Dog, which looked great on paper. 

We decided to split two of their signature burgers and neither disappointed:

Love Me &#39;Dew- w/spicy chipotle mayonnaise, pepperjack cheese, and sauteed peppers (the Star! Could not put this one down!)

The Bushel-and-a-Peck- w/Granny Smith apples, walnut butter, brie cheese slices and carmelized onions. (Amazingly tasty, but very rich).

I&#39;m a big fan of not having to think when I order and sit down, and Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s is trying out cool new table seating locators. You get a number and slide it into this futurisitic thing with slots at your table, easy enough. But then our server came by with our order looking confused,  and asked if we had moved tables and made us feel bad. Not sure if I put the thing in the wrong hole or whatnot, but the restaurant has been open a week, and it&#39;s everyone&#39;s first time, right? 

The owners (who must be in their 70&#39;s) were out talking with customers and clearing tables. I mean, the owners are retired and they decided to open a specialty burger joint in a tough economy! They seem to have a winning formula and I would place a bet that a second location will open up within a year. Until then, I&#39;ll be knocking off the rest of Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s signature burgers and hot dogs and having a conversation with my doctor about Plavix."

Prices are a bit high for burger and fries.

Burger was juicy, no gristle, cheese nicely melted on top, bun was toasted (and homemade),  fries were good.

Two Negative comments: 

The burger was not seasoned with salt and pepper so tasted bland, despite all the toppings.  You need to season before cooking, guys.

We ordered a root beer float - they brought a tall glass with a little scoop of vanilla ice cream and you chose your soft drink.  When we began to sip the root beer, we noticed a wee little spoon half-way down in the float glass that I guess you were supposed to use for the foam.  GUYS - get proper sized spoons for your glasses.

I was instructed to wait at a small table nearby and it felt like I was waiting a long time but in reality, I wasn&#39;t. 

What confused me were the little cards they give you for your table, still unsure as to what they do...But I wasn&#39;t a sit down guest so that&#39;s probably why I wasn&#39;t really instructed on how to use them.

Sure, there&#39;s 5 Guys (I&#39;m just not a fan) and DMK (neither of us eat red meat..and I haven&#39;t been there). Every time we go to any of the &#34;Big 3&#34;, we always talk about which one we like best. And frankly, I&#39;m not sure.
This was the first time I&#39;ve been to this location. I like it better than the Geneva location. I&#39;m a huge fan of tall tables and chairs and even though it&#39;s a lame reason, it can sometimes make me really like a restaurant a little bit more.
Anyway, the food is good. The staff are friendly and nice and deliver the food to your table even though it&#39;s not really that kind of restaurant. This time I had their &#34;thanksgiving special&#34; burger. Turkey burger with brie, cranberries, caramelized onions and greens with fries on the side. It was good..really good. A perfect infusion of flavors.
I had 2 sips of my fiancé&#39;s pumpkin pie shake which was also good. Enough pumpkin flavor, but not overwhelmingly sweet.

The only problem with Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s is that I always manage to get sick after eating there. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the oil they use or maybe it was the cheese (that&#39;s usually ok, but maybe it&#39;s just not ok here). I&#39;m not lactose intolerant, but sometimes milk products due me in (usually when I&#39;m out to eat..that could be a problem, too).

And trust me, it&#39;s not food poisoning. That happens more like 8-16 hours after you eat something, not 45 minutes later.

Overall, a good restaurant though."

For one reason or another, it just wasn&#39;t happening. Then, like a stroke of magic, we ended up across the street on a Tuesday evening looking for a bite to eat. Finally!

There was plenty of parking available which was a nice start. Then again, it was a Tuesday night, so that may have played a role in that perk. We walked in and I was immediately overwhelmed. I have recently started counting my calories and found that it was next to impossible for me to decide what to order. Thankfully, a regular customer walked in to pick up a carry out order. He gave us a few pointers and we were on our way. 

My hubby ordered The Ampersand. He chose a 1/3 pound burger that came with bacon, Gouda cheese (that he surprisingly liked), BBQ sauce and haystack onions. The gal at the counter helped me narrow down the field a bit. Once she knew I was counting calories and hadn&#39;t saved any extra for dinner, she suggested a kid&#39;s burger. 3 ounces of beef on a scaled down bun. Perfect!  I had BBQ sauce on the side, an apple juicebox and some fries. Somehow we added a side salad with dressing on the side.

My hubby loved his burger!  He didn&#39;t finish it and our 15 y.o. son made short work of it when we got home. The fries are thin and well seasoned. I had a few and thought they were a nice treat. My kid&#39;s burger was the perfect amount of meat for me, but so dry. That&#39;s kinda how it works when you are working with such a small portion of meat though. The bun was nice. The salad was not your average green lettuce on a plate. There were a wide variety of greens, onions, chopped tomatoes and croutons. My husband really enjoyed the variety of soda at the fountain machine. I think he chose cream soda. 

Getting a box to wrap up our leftovers was a breeze. The restaurant was clean and I would go back in a minute. Here&#39;s my plan for next time...

-Order the fruit and nut salad with chicken and eat half of it sans cheese. 
-Convince my dining partner to indulge in the ice cream sandwich trio and snag a bite (or two!). 
-Hope for nutritional info soon, so I can guess less and come here more!"

Have very friendly staff who are willing to help you through the menu and wait on you. The food itself is pretty tasty. I prefer the grilled chicken and my partner likes the ground beef burgers. Both are cooked well and the toppings are fresh. I like that you order at the counter and don&#39;t have to wait for anyone to bring the bill at the end. Also they use peanut butter sauce (like friendlys) in their milkshake!!

I split an order of homemade chips which were excellent because I love homemade chips and these were perfectly salted (not over salted). Black cherry fountain soda was excellent.

Sometimes you want a simple burger and sometimes you want a burger that&#39;s gonna knock your socks off. After hearing rave things about Tom and Eddie&#39;s I headed over for lunch with my food partner in crime. 

The first thing I noticed about this place was the decor and the friendliness of the staff. That is plus to me. I got the blue chip burger and my partner got the Chicken Capri. My burger was pretty good although a bit tiny and my side of fries were not enough for over 2 dollars. The chicken Capri was really delicious as the chicken was moist and flavorful. Overall a good burger place."

The best service award of the day goes to Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s because the staff is so goshdarn stinkin&#39; nice, and they&#39;re starting to recognize me, which is pretty dangerous territory to tread.  

The WOW moment for me happened on a recent visit with my cousin and his wife.  We were waiting for his brother to show up, so we ordered for him, because he was supposedly right behind them.  Half an hour later, no brother in sight, and a plate of rapidly cooling burger bliss.

Tom himself stops by, pretends to sit down and nosh on the mystery diner&#39;s dinner, and then promises to re-cook my cousin&#39;s food when he actually does show up.

When he did actually show up, we told tales of his tardiness, and sold him out to Tom, so that Tom would know who was responsible for the burger redux.

Thanks Tom, and thanks Cousin Pat for failing to follow directions."

Unfortunately the manager (?? - middle age gentleman with a button down shirt at the register) was not accommodating, friendly or aware of pricing.  Bad customer service is a major turn off.

The menu board states that craft brews are $3.99 and draft beers are $4.99....I think domestic bottles are $2.99.  Sounded reasonable.  I asked which beers are the craft brews and we were shown 6 cans.  We picked the Supper Club and Modus Hoperandi and were charged $4.99.  I told the manager that these were listed at $3.99 on the menu board.  He said that there isn&#39;t anything he can do about it because that is the price they are in the cash register....ummm, okay.  So which craft beers are $3.99 then?!  He had no clue and was not willing to comp the $2 off of our bill.  Our total was $29.92 for 2 burgers, 1 large sweet potato fries and 2 beers...PRETTY PRICEY FOR BAD SERVICE and a place that you order at a counter.

The edamame burger was fantastic!  The Love Me Dew was also a winner.  Love that you can order potato chips on your burger and all kinds of other specialty toppings."

This was my first time at the Lombard location, and the only thing that made me sad was - no coke freestyle machine! :( But it did force me to try one of the Boylan&#39;s flavored sodas - I went with the black cherry, and it was so good! I almost immediately went back for seconds.

I am always blown away by their level of customer service. Everyone is very nice, and is so happy to be there. The great thing is, it&#39;s not fake at all, it&#39;s totally genuine.

I went with a burger that I had already tried, the Bushel &amp; A Peck. Nutty walnut butter, crisp apples, creamy &amp; nutty brie cheese, and sweet caramelized onions - the textures and flavors are absolutely perfect together. Paired with the sweet potato fries, it&#39;s perfection!

The BF went with the classic cheeseburger, loaded with toppings. He loved is meal as well, which is great for me, because I&#39;ll be dragging him back whenever I have a hamburger craving! Maybe one day I&#39;ll try somethiing different ;)

If you haven&#39;t checked this place out yet, please do. A little pricey, but totally worth it!"

These days I rate a burger place by their ability to make my alltime favorite -- mushroom and swiss...Tom and Eddie&#39;s version (Baby Bella Swiss)  is very good...even with the garlic sauce (in lieu of ketchup).  I chose the sweet potato fries as my side...very good as the fries were tasty and hot.  The homemade sodas were a nice touch.

I&#39;ll definitely try and get back here sometime if I am in the area....prices are a bit high but its worth a once in awhile treat...the decor gives it a very relaxed atmosphere (unlike Smashburger which looks very retro 70s).  Their shakes looked very good but this time I didn&#39;t get one."

Giving Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s 5 stars simply because of the awesome turkey burger I had last night. I mean...the flavor, the juiciness, and the overall burger was absolutely delicious. I built my own with just ketchup, mustard, mayo, and pepper jack cheese. When I go back I&#39;ll have the pre-made turkey burger they make to see how that combo matches up (garlic aioli, red onion, etc.). I am sure it is out of this world.

The atmosphere:
The restaurant is stupid small! After we placed our order at the counter we walked a lap around the restaurant (which took 6 seconds) and finally spotted  a table over by a window. Whew...otherwise where would we have sat to eat? That&#39;s a problem so I think we will get carryout the next times that we go. Also, liked the quirky addition that the other reviewers mentioned: the little gadget that you put your table number in so that the wait staff know where to bring your food.

The soda:
Mmmmmm....cream soda.

The fries:
Tried the sweet potato fries and the regular ones. Meh...not too great. I&#39;ll have to try the haystack of onions straws next time because one was attached to the underside of my burger (!) and it was really good, haha.

Overall, I am satisfied with the experience that I had and I will definetly be back...for carryout!"

I had the burger with mushrooms, cheese and red onions.  It was delicious but not as juicy as Burger Lounge.  I didn&#39;t try the fries but had a cup of chicken noodle soup.  My friend got a strawberry milkshake and it was so good.

I don&#39;t understand why so many people like this place! I went and had three main problems with my experience... 

1. Burgers only made &#34;juicy medium well&#34;??? The obvious contradiction in that statement made me really worried at the ordering counter. I was saddened to see my burger cooked to super grey. My daughters kid&#39;s burger however had the pink center I desired...why do you ask? Me thinks it&#39;s because the adult burger was PERFECTLY ROUND and there&#39;s only one reason for that... Also, if you&#39;re going to overcook a burger for safety, overcook the kids burger! 

2. Could you pack MORE seats into your very tiny dining area?? I HATE this! So there&#39;s no traditional waiter...does that make it ok to force us to sit on top of eachother?? BTW, I have the same issue with many restaurants that add extra tables on Valentine&#39;s Day just to maximize $$$ while sacrificing dining experience. 

3. Most Important...there is no way anyone should EVER pay $10 for one of these burgers and $6 for a kids burger. It was simply the worst kids burger I&#39;d ever seen. SOOOO SMALL. I actually took a photo with my camera phone and will try to upload it here. Apparently two McDonalds execs own this establishment. The kid&#39;s burger was literally HALF the size of a McDonalds single cheeseburger. 

The adult burgers are in no way worth $10. My husband and I both ordered the Ampersand, both came our lukeward....ummmm warming light much...and both uber well done. 

In all, I mistakenly thought this was a higher end &#34;burger boutique&#34; when it&#39;s really just slightly better McDonalds food. High end fast food. There are many restaurants that offer FAR BETTER BURGERS FOR $10. My favorite $10 burger remains at Cooper&#39;s Hawk Winery in Burr Ridge but there are so many others...even in the Yorktown shopping area itself! Rock Bottom Brewery.....Claim Jumper... Seriously, put your the $13 you would have spent at Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s back in your pocket and drive somewhere else."

The first time we came I remember it being really good, but this time not so much. I should have known that I would get a hockey puck when they didn&#39;t ask how we wanted it cooked.

Between the veggie burgers followed up with coconut macadamia and chocolate chunk cookies, the humble staff, the to.die.for milkshakes, and the cute story behind the restaurant, I couldn&#39;t help but fall in love with Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s.

I was among the lucky few who got to try out Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s in their test kitchen at COD last Summer. I remember leaving and being so excited about having a great veggie burger option so close by... especially since it isn&#39;t your standard tofu or mixed veggies and peas burger. This one&#39;s different... better. It&#39;s made of edamame and I love to put low sodium soy sauce on it with a zig zag of sriracha and then I douse my fries in malt vinegar and shake sea salt to my tastes. I&#39;m a build your own kind of gal, I guess. 

In all honesty, I could probably give T&amp;E&#39;s 4 stars and it&#39;d still be fair since the ordering system and menus can be a little confusing on your first visit and I still have a few questions about tipping, but the service here is spectacular (I saw a super friendly employee get major &#39;tude from some lame-o lady who just wanted to take her bad day out on someone and he was oh so polite in dealing her, even though she didn&#39;t deserve his kindness) and the owners seem sweet as pie and genuinely concerned in what their customers want and have to say. Plus, I love this as an option for not only dine in, but take out and not just dinner, but dessert, and I hope they stick around for a looong while."

Modern design but still a walk-up-and-order fast food restaurant. I had the Bushel and a Peck burger which sounded very promising from other Yelpers. A grass-fed beef burger topped with housemade walnut butter, granny smith apples, and a slice of brie. Some report that there are caramelized onions. Either they forgot to add them to mine, or the onions were just... forgettable.

At any rate, the idea was great, but the execution was very poor. First off, I have to agree with other Yelpers who noticed that Tom&amp;Eddies overcooks their burgers. Mine was horribly dry. Granted I flirt with danger and like mine medium, but this was the dry end of medium well.

Secondly, the toppings were in conflict. It was a love triangle between the walnut butter, apple and brie. The butter and apples were amazing together. And from past experience I know that apple and brie is quite nice. But the apple was being pulled in two different directions, and it didn&#39;t work for me.

The service was poor. Despite the modern wireless numbering system, we constantly saw the staff walking around with lost orders. And when I ordered a shake after the meal, it never came. Never. I had to go back up and order it again.

Add to this the high price (for what you get) and I don&#39;t think I&#39;d go back.

The only redeeming factor was the local brewery craft beer on tap. Tom and Eddie, keep on serving Two Brothers!"

I think the area is really called &#34;Shops on Butterfield&#34; but I like to nickname things all the time. 
I&#39;m quite impressed as to how this area has been upgraded, nice restaurants, specialty stores, brick paths to walk--careful, parts of that is really a &#34;street&#34; where cars can drive. 

Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s story is described well in other reviews. Former McDonald&#39;s execs that ventured out on their own to create a different burger experience. And a delicious experience I might add. 

For a burger place, the menu is quite extensive, between the specialty burgers and the create-your-own burgers. After placing your order at the counter, you can find a seat in the restaurant. I do like the &#34;Jetson&#39;s&#34; style metal box thing-y at each table where you slide in your order number card, that way the servers know where you&#39;re sitting to deliver your order. Service was very friendly and checked on us quite a bit (even without us having to press the &#34;service&#34; button on that metal box thing-y) 

My aunt and I shared the Islander--Sushi grade ground Ahi Tuna, (grilled) topped with fresh won tons, sliced avocado, crushed wasabi peas and wasabi mayo. This was amazing. If you like spicy tuna rolls, you&#39;ll like this burger. It was so fresh and every bite was flavorful. Very good quality tuna and the wasabi added a hint of zing. I&#39;ll admit, it was kind of weird to think of sushi when I tasted the tuna burger. But as an alternative to beef, this was quite nice. 

We also split the Ampersand--100% Angus beef patty, topped with Nueske applewood smoked bacon, Wisconsin smoked Gouda cheese, smoky BBQ sauce and haystack fried onions. I opted to have them omit the fried egg just because it seemed a little overwhelming already. This burger was also delicious. The beef, smokiness of the bacon and tang of the BBQ sauce went very well together. Flavorful in every bite. Another winner. 

The sides of sweet potato fries and haystack onions were very good--and quite a hefty serving. 

The only thing that seemed off to me was the bun itself. It seemed a little too soft for that kind of burger. So after a few bites, it got kind of &#34;mushed&#34;. I&#39;ve also come to love having my buns grilled (oh that sounds lovely). Yeah my HAMBURGER buns grilled or warmed when the burgers are put together--to me it makes a big difference. They do offer mulit-grain ciabatta vs sesame seed buns as a choice so maybe I&#39;ll try that next time. 

There will be a next time for sure! I think this would be a perfect stop for a bite to eat before heading to the AMC theaters around the way."

Not bad. It&#39;s like ordering at McD&#39;s with the added little bonus of getting your food delivered to your table. 

I was kind of rushed to order so I didn&#39;t see half the menu, I ended up getting a regular cheeseburger. To wash down my meal I got black cherry soda but they have other choices like root beer, cream soda, or regular pop.

The place is small so good luck trying to find seating after you order. I overheard a convo between a customer and the owner, and the owner was telling them that they were trying to buy out the property next to them so they can expand. That would be very helpful and probably bring in more business.

If you&#39;re looking for something fast but not TOO fast food-ish, this is the place."

Their blue cheese cream changed my life. I pair that with their sweet potato fries and they go so good together. I always opt to build my own burger, usually with tomato, pickle, and fried egg. They use very fresh ingredients and you can really tell that within the flavor of their burgers. Their peaunt butter cup milkshake is perfect. I only took off one star because their menu used to offer grilled pineapple for the burgers, but they took that off of their menu :("

Of course- that&#39;s not surprising when you know who the namesakes are who created this concept. &#34;Tom&#34; is Tom Dentice- a former McDonald&#39;s executive vice president, who is partnered with &#34;Eddie&#34;, Ed Rensi who was the CEO and President of McDonald&#39;s USA, for 13 years back in the mid 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s. I guess the notion of &#34;ketchup in the veins&#34; of most McDonald&#39;s people is true if these guys came back to start up a hamburger chain in one of the worst economies ever! 

The concept is quite nice. You place your order at the counter after waiting in a serpentine line. You are handed a plastic card that you are told to insert into a device on your table. This notifies the staff where you are sitting so that they can bring your food to you. We took a seat in a comfy booth and waited to see how long this would take. 

Within 11 minutes, our food was served on real plates right to our table. If you want real forks, knives, napkins- you have to pick them up yourself from the beverage bar which houses not only a drink fountain with Coke products on one side- but they have Boylan&#39;s soda on the other (root beer, cream soda, etc) They also have about 20 different types of sauces that you can spice your burger up with like Tabasco, chili sauce, etc. 

They have several &#34;reciped&#34; burgers (those that come with toppings already picked for you) like the &#34;Tried and True&#34; (a Lettuce and tomato burger with all the expected condiments) the &#34;Blue Chip&#34; Burger (a burger topped with Haas avocado, blue cheese and aioli sauce, and the &#34;Ampersand&#34; (which I think had an egg, BBQ sauce and onion chips on it) Or if you want to customize your burger- they have a listing of toppings so you can build your own. 

We went with three of the reciped burgers (those noted above) and these burgers were delicious. Perfectly prepared, juicy served on a soft roll. Just the way I would make it myself. The fries are thin- with the skin on- good- but will never compare to McDonald&#39;s fries. Sorry- Ed.  And other sides include sweet potato fries or potato chips. 

As we were finishing our meal- we needed to take something back for another person at the office so we thought we would try the &#34;Service&#34; button that is on the gizmo on the table. We pushed it. And within 2 minutes a server was at the table asking what we wanted (it turns out it&#39;s a paging system and the staff and management wear pagers that alert them to what table needs help). We placed our order and were told to pick it up at the front counter. Here&#39;s a tip- that button- can be great for moms too - for if you forgot something- no need to wait back in line and leave the kids-push the button and someone will get it for you. Or use it to order dessert (root beer shake anyone?) 

The ambiance is a cross between a fast food restaurant and bar. There are high top tables, booths and even comfy chairs pulled up around a fireplace in one room. Want to sit outside? There are at least 10 tables out there. And speaking of details- they even have big orange umbrellas by the door in case it starts to rain. 

The only hiccup that we had during our visit was in trying to pick up the additional food we ordered. I went back to the counter and was told I had to wait in the serpentine line yet again. I did- but when I got to the counter- the counter person said he didn&#39;t know anything. Then my food came up and he said he couldn&#39;t ring that up on his register. So I had to wait until the other counter person was ready. This all took about 15 more minutes than I would have liked. 

I&#39;m sure this is just a growing pain and can easily be rectified for future visits. (I wonder how they pay for those desserts they suggestive sell?) Might be a good idea to have the servers have credit card swipe machines so that they can just bring the food to you and have you pay at the same time. Just an idea, Ed! 

Burgers run about $10 each and include a side. Drinks are extra (they even have beer and wine). And parking is free (hey- it&#39;s the suburbs and this is located at Yorktown Mall) 

The funny thing? As I looked around on the day that I was there- half of the seats had to be filled with McDonald&#39;s executives. Hmm . . .wishing Tom and Ed well on their new venture? Or checking out some new competition? My guess??  A little of both!"

Though this is still a good place for a burger, the restaurant feels like its in a bit of a rut. The burgers do not taste quite as fresh or maybe I&#39;m just growing critical in my old age. There was a bit of a price bump too. 

As an example, when they opened their Ahi tuna burger was a tiny bit charred on the outside but a bright pink on the inside, a sure sign of great caliber tuna. The tuna isn&#39;t as brightly colored anymore, which implies a less fresh fish. I reserve going below 4 stars until my next visit."

So after gassing up my car I headed to Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s across the street from where I work. They&#39;re what I call a contemporary, fast-casual burger joint. Very a la California.

It&#39;s great going here because they have an Ahi burger (Islander) which is spectacularly spicy and very Pan-Asian. I loved it last time I came. Plus they have spectacular meat burgers and other stuff like salads and milkshakes. Check out their menu.

Their expertise in these fantastic, specialty meaty dishes makes walking in a sexy-dangerous line to walk if you&#39;re a pescatarian like me. Yes. Good food is sexy!

om nom nom

Today I opted to make my own burger, by selecting the Ahi Tuna, pepper jack, spicy mayo, fried onions on ciabatta with a side of french fries.

The spicy mayo is oh-so-perfect with the onions. Oh, and their seasonal pumpkin pie shake. To.Die.For. It&#39;s also perfect to drown out any fire the spiciness in your selected entree might light up in yer taste buds.

BONUS: Their takeaway box is biodegradable, which is AWESOME.

Yep that&#39;s about a whole week and a half worth of calories. But I earned it!"

I&#39;ve been to Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s several times, and even when they forget to put something on my ridiculously complicated (and slightly expensive because I like fancy ingredients) burger, I always have an incredibly enjoyable meal.

I have a tendency to create my own burger, because they have so many of my favorite ingredients that I want to include them all. So I do. What&#39;s that you say? Turkey burgers? The best in town. These flavorful beasts of meat are loaded with juicy tasty goodness. 

The regular burgers are just as delicious. 

But the real show stopper is the toppings. You want it? They&#39;ve got it. Goat cheese? Basil pesto? Grilled onions? Dried tomatoes? Flavored aioli? Smoked gouda? Other assorted cheeses and toppings? Yes. Yes. and Yes. Ciabatta buns? YUM. 

The service? Unbeatable. Everyone is smiling and offering assistance or suggestions. 

The drink machine? Totally awesome. They also have a rockin&#39; iced tea. And I don&#39;t even like iced tea.

So go. Check it out."

This visit we had smoked wings.  Hands down best wings I&#39;ve had in a couple years.  The BBQ rub were great, the rub is slightly sweeter.  We both agreed the buffalo-and-slow were awesome. Smokey, spicy, and delicious.  

The roasted cauliflower app is rather big and is roasted with lots of garlic and onions, and topped with olives and tomatoes. Really good. The vegetarian chili was super flavorful and surprisingly hot. Perfect amount of spice for me, but a bit too hot for her.

I was not surprised though after learning that they smoke their own meats.  The portion was generous too, I only ate half of my sandwich and ate the other half for lunch the following day.  Most entrees are around $12.  For a quality sandwich big enough for two, that&#39;s an excellent deal.

I also ordered a side of macaroni &amp; cheese.  This was again a good size portion which was extra creamy and so, so satisfying!  

I came here for dinner with a friend, street parking is available right on State St. or just around the corner, and the interior of Nobel House is much larger than the pictures show.  There was live music on a Thursday night which was obviously louder the closer you sat to the stage, but the volume was comfortable toward the rear of the restaurant.

There is no shortage of cocktails, wine, or beer.  The Mexican Mule (tequila, blood orange, ginger beer) was so good I had two!"

I can&#39;t believe we let 4 years pass and not slip into Nobel House.  Finally did Sunday evening and it hit the head right on the &#34;need that place that get&#39;s it&#34; nail.
The kitchen executed flawlessly with flavor, creativity and mix.  6 dishes between the two of us and each wasn&#39;t even close to just being &#34;ok&#34;.  All exceeded expectations.  They really get flavor, texture and offering something for many palettes.  Even with ingredient adjustments here and there the plates were amazing.
Beer list is great, though I am just a porter/stout guy...and they didn&#39;t disappoint there either.
Atmosphere is simplistically cool, and great music playing in the background.
It was a Sunday evening, so there were a few kids in the place (I guess young parents need a sanity check once in a while).  If you want zero kids, probably a different evening.  Otherwise it is just loud enough to drown it out, but not too loud to talk.
Service...not bad.  On Sunday the service crew was young, and it showed at times.  But really, everything else so made up for this.

Lauren, who coordinated the whole event for us, was always responsive and willing to work with us on special requests.  

The food was great, from the appetizers, including the oyster bar (a big hit), to the house smoked BBQ and homemade pickles, to the deserts that staff helped us find.

We came in on a late Tuesday.  The servers were super nice, friendly, and attentive and let us get an order in before the kitchen closed (at 10pm).  I had the Rueben&#39;s Sister Rachel and the smoked turkey was on point.  The onion rings and accompanying chipotle sauce were (somehow casually) maybe the best I&#39;ve ever had.  My girlfriends brussel sprouts were really tasty and her chicken sandwich was good too.  I&#39;ve got my eye on the sweet fries and mac &amp; cheese for the sides during my next visit.

The beer list was long and good, but mostly IPA-centric.  This isn&#39;t too out of the ordinary for summer time, and the local selections were a plus.

Definitely do not recommend this bar for their food. The french toast was uncooked, and the replacement they gave me was burnt and raw in the center.  The bacon was good, the eggs were this weird dark blackish color in some areas and the breakfast potatoes were greasy, old and flavorless.  I ordered &#34;hashbrowns&#34; but got these sad little diced up greying potatoes instead.  Brunch was inedible.  Luckily didn&#39;t have to pay for most of it, but left hungry and disappointed.

I had the veggie chili, which was yummy, but I wasn&#39;t too sold on the texture of mushrooms which competed with the beans in a slightly odd way. Don&#39;t get me wrong: I love mushrooms. Just not in chili. They also have a black bean burger which I haven&#39;t confirmed the vegan-ness of, but which looks really good, and I would definitely give this place another shot to test that theory.

My mom had a somewhat less enjoyable experience here. See, we&#39;re from pretty darn close to New England, and have eaten some REAL lobster rolls, notably from Maine and Massachusetts. I&#39;m not a seafood eater anymore, but if I were, I&#39;d probably save it for trips back home. My mom got the lobster roll here and was hugely disappointed. I can&#39;t say I&#39;m shocked, considering that people around here don&#39;t know what bagels or pizza really are either. So maybe stick to local fare. 

Also, if you&#39;re not a fan of country music, well... maybe you won&#39;t be a huge fan of this place. I don&#39;t love it, and it was pretty loud (actually, the volume kept fluctuating as if somebody kept leaning against the volume dial and maybe didn&#39;t realize it?), so if that will be a total buzz-kill, maybe skip this place and go somewhere else."

We normally always hit up a bar in that area, which is never a problem since there are plenty.  He kept suggesting that we try Nobel House, but from the outside it looked like a cafe and not a bar.  I finally relented and we went this past Saturday for lunch and oh how wrong I was, this might be my new favorite place.  
Nobel House isn&#39;t very big on the inside, but big enough and there was never an empty table, so apparently other people know about this little gem.  They have an extensive beer menu with mostly local craft beers on tap (always a plus) and they have a pretty big food menu as well.  Normally at a new place I get a burger, but something on the menu caught my eye.... pulled bacon sandwich.  What sorcery is this?  I absolutely had to try it!  It&#39;s essentially a pulled pork sandwich, but made with the cut of pork normally reserved for bacon.  Apparently this is a thing, but I had never heard of it before, so that&#39;s what I ordered.  This might be the greatest sandwich of all time, it was awesome!  It&#39;s sort of like a very tender, very flavorful, richer, pulled pork and it included house cut fries and 2 different BBQ sauces.

I remember bookmarking it for the craft beer and awesome gastropubby small plates menu and I will say that Nobel House delivered there big time.  I really was not expecting this tiny little joint to pack such a good list considering it is listed as a both a &#34;bar and a breakfast &amp; brunch/american&#34; place.  At least on yelp, it is.  I will say that the vibe there is totally weird because of the split personality though.  I walked in and immediately felt like I was in a Nashville honky tonk turned daytime breakfast place who might also be trying to be a gastropub and a sports bar all at once.  I mean, whatever, to each his own.  The loud twangy bluegrass and the smoked meat aroma that blasted me when I walked in certainly aided in that impression.  I can overlook the horrid music (and I don&#39;t REALLY care about the atmosphere) if the beer and food are good though so I ventured onward to the bar.  The bartender took awhile to stop flirting and come over to help us but once she did, the service was pretty good.  And the beer list?  Let&#39;s talk about that again since it is the most important matter, really.  IT WAS EXCELLENT.  There was an entire page of good craft beer both on tap and in bottle.  And lots of it was local(ish).  There was even several beers that my snobby a** hasn&#39;t tried.  Also, you can get a premade IPA flight or their flight of the day (both of which are predetermined...though I bet they would switch some things out for you as they didn&#39;t seem like the type of place that hates on that, but I could be wrong).  And the food (which we only tried one plate since we were hopping) was excellent.  We got the smoked wings which can be split into two sauces (we went with buffalo and sriracha) with ranch and blue cheese.  All the food, including the obviously homemade dressings were totally legit.  I could&#39;ve drank the blue cheese right out of the ramekin because a) it was THAT delicious and b) I&#39;m disgusting.  

Overall, I really liked Nobel House and I will definitely be back again so I can try more of those delicious small plates.  I&#39;m just going to have to bring some noise cancelling headphones to avoid the bluegrass..."

Our menu consisted of pork wings, beer mussels &amp; the belly melt with a side of mac &amp; cheese. 

Here&#39;s the rundown:

I was soo, sooo excited for the mussels but ended up being pretty disappointed. The &#34;broth&#34; was bitter &amp; there was grit in every mussel I had. No good.

The pork wings had amazing flavor &amp; the &#34;smoke&#34; taste was definitely dominant. If you&#39;re not a fan of that, stay away.

The belly melt did not excite me as much as the pork wings did. It seemed that all of the pieces to the puzzle that were on the plate didn&#39;t quite fit. Not terrible by any means but I would not order it again. GET the mac &amp; cheese though, that&#39;s definitely a solid choice and pretty delicious.  

It seems that each item had a flaw or two but it wasn&#39;t terrible. A little tweak of the ingredients and they would all be a home run.

The beer selection was great, plenty of local brews, lots of seasonal and rotational choices. They were overly dependent on IPA&#39;s like lots of bars. That&#39;s great as I&#39;m not a fan of all the hoppiness of them. They have grilled frog legs as an app special, they were slathered in a citrus Thai sauce that was tasty but too spicy to really enjoy. The plate also had a bed of coleslaw that had an interesting ingredient, bleu cheese. It made for a creamy flavor that was great. I followed the frog with the steakhouse sandwich. I wouldn&#39;t call it a sandwich as you can&#39;t pick it up and eat it. Best thing was to cut it up and eat it with a fork. The steak/cheese/onion combo tasted good, but the meat was a little tough for being cooked med rare. Overall the Noble house was a enjoyable experience and I will definitely try it again on a return trip."

They changed their menu a bit since I was last there, but it looks like they were all good changes. I had the tako tacos which were extremely flavorful and had a nice kick of spice to them. It was my first time trying octopus in tacos and I was not disappointed. Somehow the cilantro in the tacos complimented the octopus very well. I also had their Prairie Path beer which is a nice crisp golden ale and it went very well with the tacos; it wasn&#39;t too sweet or too bitter and it balanced out the meal very nicely. I do miss their Founder&#39;s Blushing Monk beer though, but Nobel House has more than enough delicious types of beer to make up for it. It looks like the business is still rocking and rolling and I&#39;m happy for them! Great food, great drinks, and always a great experience."

So we headed for Nobel house to get a table and some real food after Geneva Fest, because we like to hold our food DOWN.

Got a nice tall table near the bar, and we were digging into some oysters, a bottle of wine, and the best REAL fried salad I&#39;ve had in a long time when a different bartender suddenly appears mumbling about doing a favor for him. He looked kind of odd so I said that my partner might suckhimoff for big bucks but that wasn&#39;t my thing (although I hadn&#39;t seen his money :~);  then he started mumbling something about a big crowd etc... And when I asked him &#34;if he was asking us to move to a smaller table?&#34; he then started to mumble about comping something until he saw our  bottle of wine and then he mumbled off.
I don&#39;t think the rest of the servers liked him much either because we got big smiles the rest of the night and continued great service.

Kiel rocks, the better bartender. We bought some drinks for the great people that we met there and hope to see them Soon at a Sunday brunch.

WAY better than your average good bar food. Hold your table if they won&#39;t buy it. Be there."

That was disappointing. A week before that I dined inside- got the Mac n cheese- it was served to me cold. U would think the servers wouldn&#39;t want to bring the food out to the table if they don&#39;t see the heat rising from a big bowl of pasta - but nope. Cold Mac n cheese is what I got. All the flavor but no heat. I got a burger as well and the temp was wrong. May have to take a break from Nobel even tho it is generally really good food

I didn&#39;t expect to like this place as much as I did.  I had no expectations and I didn&#39;t even know what kind of a food they served when my Wife and I made plans with another couple to meet for dinner.  The menu isn&#39;t huge but they do have a large specials menu on the wall.  The place specializes in BBQ, and I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this since I just smoked 10 pounds of short ribs last weekend but, I just wasn&#39;t in the mood for BBQ when I showed up.  I therefore ordered their burger and it was very very good.  The meat was seasoned well and the toppings were ample.

For appetizers we ordered the Pork wings which were tasty but were a little dry.  This is normal in my opinion for such a small smoked piece of meat but I just wanted to mention that if someone really can&#39;t have their meat a little barky on the outside.  We also had the roasted garlic and that was fantastic.  I&#39;ll definitely go back just for that.

My wife got the pulled pork sandwich and being one that smokes about 15 pounds of butt each year I can say it was quite good.  Shoulder is hard to mess up though.

My One friend ordered the lobster roll and he said he thoroughly enjoyed it.  The amount of lobster was pretty ample too.

My other friend ordered the burnt ends.  I was trying to get my wife to order them since I at least wanted to try but she shared them and they were very tasty...Think beef bacon.

All in all a solid establishment with great food.  Although it seemed like a while before our initial drink order the service for repeat drinks and food was very prompt from there out and the server was very friendly.  The atmosphere is befitting a small pub style urban BBQ location and is exactly as you&#39;d expect it.

Thanks Nobel House!"

Husband and I stopped there for lunch on a Sunday and it wasn&#39;t all that busy. We were seated right away. I&#39;m normally not a brunch person (like, at all) but I had to try their Smokehouse omelette - pulled pork, pork belly, coleslaw, and cheese sauce. Yaaaaaas.

It was good, and they cooked my hash browns damn near burnt (just like I like &#39;em!) Husband had the Belly Melt, which was almost the same thing as mine, except with no eggs and on bread. Very good. 

We also split a poutine with brisket. I was a bit disappointed that the brisket was sliced and not chopped, but that&#39;s just splitting hairs at this point.

Their beer selection was amazing. They even had a Three Floyds beer. I&#39;ll come back and sample next time I&#39;m not so damn hungover and just need grease to calm the nuclear power plant that is my head and stomach."

We basically had to shout at one another, and our waitress had to shout to be heard as well- and so did all of the other patrons- seemed a bit silly.

Now, onto everything I loved. The entire rest of our experience was five stars :) Our waitress was very friendly, and arrived quickly when we got there. My husband enjoyed a beer from the local Penrose brewery, and I tried two delicious cocktails. The first was their take on a cosmo which involved pop rocks (delicious and dangerous), and I also tried my first mojito (blueberry) which was wonderful and refreshing. We started our meal with the poutine, which was lovely- not sure what the cheese was but it was perfect with the appetizer, we couldn&#39;t finish it- but enjoyed it nonetheless. For entrees, my husband had a burger, and I had the meat with two sides plate. Both of us had the adult mac and cheese as a side and I absolutely loved it- ate every single bite. I like that the brisket came with multiple sauces- all delicious. 

I also enjoyed that you can see right into the kitchen- love the open atmosphere- huge bar with tons of beer on tap. I also loved that the windows in front are screened so on cool nights they can be opened up. We will absolutely be back- loved everything about this place."

Seems like a place the locals come for a bite or two and a few drinks. Service was good - we came here on a Sunday evening. The reason for the 3 stars is because the food was salty beyond belief and not as good as earlier reviews stated. We have eaten at a lot of Geneva restaurants and there are way better places. This was seriously the saltiest food I have ever eaten in my dining experience in the Midwest.  If we come here again we will most likely just order drinks!

Our group had Grilled Chicken Breast with Mac n Cheese, Lobster Roll w Mac n Cheese, Grilled Steak Sandwich with Onion Ring, Pulled Bacon Sandwich with fries. The Chicken and Lobster Roll were deemed Very Good, while the Steak Sandwich was Excellent, and Pulled Bacon... Outstanding (darn near Orgasmic from the sounds coming from our fellow diner.) The Pulled Bacon essentially looked like a pulled pork sandwich, but we were told it was the best pulled pork sandwich they had ever had. Onion Rings and zest dipping sauce Rocked. Mac n Cheese was fine, but not exceptional - I&#39;d get a different side next time. There were several from which to choose. The portions were spot on.

My hat goes off to Nobel House - I think they offer well-prepared, interesting dishes at reasonable prices. I thoroughly enjoy the mussels and Parmesan fries as a main course (though it is listed as an appetizer), and am a fan of the ceviche (my husband is not...not everyone has good tastes!). The crab cakes are another go-to item for me, but pass on the crab-cake sandwich, which just has way too much bread! 

The charcuterie plate is a great option if you&#39;re dining with a group, as you can choose from a variety of cheeses and meats and the portions are more than decent.

The waitstaff is terrific; my family is a big fan of Kate, but we&#39;re a bit biased, as we know her brother and his fiance! Honestly though, we have had nothing but good service at Nobel House.

I think the atmosphere is a bit lacking though - there&#39;s a bit of an identity crisis going on inside the restaurant. I love the wood-planked walls and ceiling, but can&#39;t quite figure out the American flag artwork or vintage travel posters. I would much rather see invention sketches or portraits of Alfred Nobel on the walls. Some quotes would work too. I don&#39;t know if anyone else realizes the restaurant is named for Alfred Nobel...?

The actual setup is poor, tables that are wobbly and feel like you are right in the middle of an aisle. Service was adequate, nothing great or worth noting positively.

I had the steak sandwich, and it really was pretty good, but very hard to eat on the pretzel roll. The &#34;house made chips&#34; were NOT house made in my opinion, out of a bag I think. Very over seasoned, and Barbeque flavored. When I mentioned that to the waitress, she said they are about to redo the menu and the new menu will say they are Barbeque. HUH???? So you wouldn&#39;t mention that when I ordered it??? She didn&#39;t even offer to bring another side. I ate two of them.

Husband had the crab cake club. Too much breading, not much crab, and here&#39;s a clue. When you serve something soft like that, do not use ciabatta bread that&#39;s hard and dry, because when you bite it, everything sqooshes out and all you get is stale bread.

I&#39;d been here about six months ago and had been dreaming of the poutine with brisket ever since. 

Fast forward to today. First, we got serious side-eye from the waitstaff when we asked to move to a nearby table right after being seated (we were right under a vent that was blowing cold air on a cold day). When it was time to order, I inquired about the oysters and I expressed my preference for brine. My server steered me toward a cleaner NY selection, which sounded fine to me. When they were delivered, she informed me that she&#39;d asked the chef and he told her the BC oysters were more briny, so that&#39;s what she ordered for me (in spite of the fact that she said they weren&#39;t good earlier). Um ... thanks? I would have preferred that she relay the chefs recommendation and allowed me to make the choice myself. 

The biggest disappointment was the brisket on the poutine, which came to the table with no visible char  and was at least 60 percent fat - pulled from the smoker a bit too early, I&#39;m guessing. I picked at it, and ate some but discarded a fair amount of it. Nothing like the magical dish I&#39;d had in the fall. MAJOR letdown. 

On top of that, my mother&#39;s onion soup was nearly inedible (overwhelmed with seasoning) and my father wasn&#39;t offered a refill on his long-empty Arnold Palmer. Will not be back."

Like Barbecue? This is a great joint for you. Like an interesting salad? They make those too. Beer mussels are good and they make a mean charcuterie.

Prices are typical for the western suburbs. Nothing crazy expensive.

Open dining area and the TVs with various sports teams are always playing. We can take or leave the sports, we come for the food and the very attentive, friendly staff. Noise levels are reasonable. You don&#39;t have to yell at table mate to be heard.

Food and drink menu was solid. Service was steady and very cordial. The PORK WINGS were delicious, first-rate dry rub, moist, and with a pleasant crunch. Unfortunately, the MUSSELS didn&#39;t thrill. Very gritty with a bitter beer broth was hardly complimentary of the livery mussels. Definitely could&#39;ve benefited from a white wine or garlic sauce. Much like the mussels, the BELLY MELT didn&#39;t wow the crowd. The pulled pork and belly were a bit dry, and the bitter jicama slaw did not marry well with the appeal of the overall sandwich. A lot of contrast crammed in between two slices of toasted bread. On the plus side, the mac &amp; cheese was knockout and a certain menu must. Choice food and drink, a laid back atmosphere, plenty of space to roam in accommodation of the masses, and a contemporary music selection most assuredly secured our future business."

We walk in. Table of 3. Told a thirty minute wait. Ok that&#39;s fine but there&#39;s an open table right behind the hostess. I double check with the hostess, she says oh wait there is a table right there. 

We get to this highly exclusive table finally and then we wait...we wait and wait and wait. My life was passing before my eyes as I sat in despair. Awaiting some form of nourishment. 

It never came. 1/5. Would give less if I could. I&#39;m dead on the inside as a result of this experience."

The lamb burger was dry and not really tasty and the side serving of fries or beans were far from generous. This place could be improved and maybe it will but for now it has some catching up to some of the more established eateries in Geneva

My last visit was disappointing. First of all, we were told there would be a 15 minute wait for our table, yet we waited for over an hour. We watched the hostess seat people who came in after us, which was frustrating. The pulled pork was dried out, and the service was just okay."

Couldn&#39;t have been more pleased! Besides the normal menu and the chalkboard daily specials -- they also have a BRUNCH menu! Everything was a hit -- from the steak sandwich, to the crabcake club, to the belly wedge salad, everything was delicious. Thanks for making the meal a hit. A slight wait to get a table at the crack of 1 in the afternoon, but by 230pm the place was comfortably empty and a nice place to sit and relax."

Burger was cooked medium and very good.  Oysters were succulent but shuckers need to make sure oyster is fully shucked.  Over time I would say the food I&#39;ve tried here is always very good.  On this last visit, however, the two bartenders working seemed to not want to be there.  Saw more of their backs than anything.  Had to ask for silverware.  Had to ask for ketchup, mustard..... Never asked us how the food was, nor asked us if we wanted another beer.  Had to tell her to ring us up twice.  It wasn&#39;t even that busy.  Bizarre.

The choice of a charcuterie and cheese platter was a great idea to start! It came with olives and fig jam to offset the other tastes, a nice touch. 

After that, my entree (I got the crab cakes off the appetizer menu and the macaroni as a size) was slightly lackluster. I didn&#39;t care for the mustard-seed-y sauce that accompanied the cakes, so that threw things off, I think (at least it was only on the plate). The mac was good, in a plentiful cream sauce. 

Service was quick and alert. Overall, I&#39;ll remember this restaurant option for future dining in Geneva!"

We arrived on a Thursday night around 7pm. We were told there was a 20 min wait. Which was fine we were willing to wait. I saw 2 tables open up. However I was a party of 2 and the tables had 4 chairs. We were the only ones waiting on the list that had yet to be sat, but were told by the host that we couldn&#39;t be sat there because they leave them open for tables of 4. Even though there were no tables of 4. I asked to speak with a manager. The girl pointed me to a man in a hat behind the bar. I asked him why I wasn&#39;t being seated when no one else was on the list, and he told me to relax. His tone was completely condescending. He told me his restaurant is busy for a reason and that his host is a 16 year old girl so to give her a break. But the real issue was I was giving the 16 year old a break by asking her manager for clarification. His tone and telling me to relax and coming off like an arrogant ass is what sent me walking out the door. Since they are busy for a reason they don&#39;t need my business I guess. I hope the ghost people enjoy their 4 top."

First we walked in there were several tables opened   But yet we had to wait 10 minutes to be seated. 
A family walked in behind us and they asked how long the wait was and the hostess said 15 minutes and the guy pointed to an open table and said &#34;what about that one?&#34; To the hostess surprised it was an open table and she seated them right away. 

We ordered drinks and wings. No ice for the waters at the table. So you are drinking warm water. 

Wings were ok .Big and meaty. Lots of sauce. Nothing impressive. 

Dinner came. Beef brisket sandwich was cold, bloody, tough and a gross pale white color. 

Chicken tender sandwich is just a pounded out flavorless chicken breast.  

Fries were soggy and just gross. 

I just wanted to leave! 

What a waste."

Appreciated the fact that our server went to check for us and then put up with our stupid jokes about being able to cook in the kitchen ourselves. However, what I didn&#39;t like was the manager coming over pretty condescendingly saying that nowhere else would be serving food and that we might as well just order.

Nobel House has an awesome craft beer selection, good variety to their menu, a rustic decor, and all around good vibe. They also have eight screens, so this would a good place to watch your favorite team.

Service was good.  Hearing about the smoked meats my husband and I decided to get the Nobel platter.  I am very happy we got this platter because if we hadn&#39;t I would have ordered something I most likely would not like. When it comes to southern smoked meats I usually enjoy the pulled pork or brisket.  Some people are able to bring me back to my Austin roots while others just make me angry that I ever had real BBQ.  The brisket was beyond fatty to the point it was difficult to find a good cut.  The pork did have a smoke ring however there was no flavor to the meat.  With the BBQ sauce the brisket was still sad where as the pork was decent. However the ham, chicken and turkey redeemed the platter. The ham, turkey and chicken were flavorful and moist. The pickles and cornbread were actually the best &#34;BBQ&#34; on the plate. I would come back here but most just for beer maybe something other than the BBQ."

We both feel like nobel house prides itself on serving fresh, quality food.  We like getting the poutine, since it&#39;s somewhat hard to find around here. Husband had the steakhouse sandwich, which is really tasty - i was afraid the meat might be a little tough, but it was tender and perfect. I couldn&#39;t stop eating his sandwich! i had the burnt ends, which are good - not sure if i would recommend tho. i think it works better as an appetizer than a main &#34;dish&#34;, but i liked it. On a previous visit, husband had the &#34;rachel&#34; sandwich, which was a new twist on the reuben. we both liked it a lot!

On the food note. We thought it was great! My hubby got the brisket, I got the ribs. Loved their sauces that came on the side. Ribs were a little dry. Jalepeno corn bread was good. The sides! We both got mac n cheese &amp; baked beans. The mac n cheese was a delicious adult version!!!! Tempting to get a full the size one next time. The baked beans were equally as good!!

We went for dinner around 7:30pm looking forward to what we thought was going to be a great meal and were highly disappointed.  The place wasn&#39;t busy at all and it took roughly twenty minutes to get drinks. When she came over to our table she was very unpleasant and didn&#39;t seem to have people skills or really didn&#39;t care. We ordered an appetizer and waited for her to eventually make her way back to our table so we could place our food order. (She was super preoccupied socializing with her coworkers..) We ordered our food and not long after, it arrived at our table. It wasn&#39;t very hot so how could that have been freshly made right? Yeah it wasn&#39;t. The French fries are normally super delicious but they were bad. After a lot of debating on what was the matter with them and making the waitress aware that they sucked, we discovered they must&#39;ve put old fries in the frier again to re-cook them. The waitress had nothing to say about the fries or the poor meal other than &#34;oh really? I&#39;m sorry you didn&#39;t like the fries.&#34; I could say more but moral of the story, we all felt sick later that night after eating and we won&#39;t be returning back."

We sat at the bar and I was approached by a man(who claims he is the owner) from behind the bar asking me to change my language. Im not sure what I had said to offend anyone but I brushed his request off not thinking much of it.  

Within 10 mins, shortly after we placed our food order he started yelling at the other 3 people I was with in regards to our &#34;behavior/language&#34;- It unfortunately blew up quickly, I paid the tab(enjoy your chargeback) and quickly left.

I own and operate 3 restaurants &amp; in my 10 years of experience I&#39;ve never delt with any of my customers in this manor nor is his behavior excusable. Regardless of who is right or wrong in this situation if he treats his customers this way I can only image how he treats his employees. The rage in his face was unreal. We all have good and bad days while working in the service industry but there are better ways to handle customers. 

And for those who had to hear the yelling inside the restaurant, for that my apologies. I&#39;ll never be back, as we were regulars, stopping in couple times a week. GL to you &amp; you business, hopefully no one else has to endure your rage like we did."

Another in this list of AWESOME Geneva based hot spots that really meets or even exceeds the word on the street. This restaurant is one that we will definitely return to. Great food and service!

My wife and I had the opportunity last minute to catch dinner together and although they were extremely busy (I understand they are regularly full or busy) we were seated quickly and serviced immediately. The server was knowledgeable although I did challenge her knowledge regarding menu she never lost focus or got flustered, she asked questions of the leadership and chiefs staff and came back with all the explanations required to understand and make decisions. 

Food - OK if you know me you know I have traveled the world tasting food and most recently over the last couple of years focused on BBQ quite a bit. (Mexican and Asian food are my focuses of trifecta) I ordered the brisket with beans, slaw and cornbread. I normally start a new restaurant with a sampler platter of BBQ so I can find my favorite and ensure I am well fed. I didn&#39;t see an offering like that on the menu but for some reason I was drawn to the brisket directly. (this is a smoke house and they use Hickory) I am a big time foodie and smoke food almost weekly myself so I come from a perspective that I believe lends value to my reviews regarding BBQ. The brisket was plentiful, butterfly platted and tasted great. I received a healthy amount of beef and it was moist and elastic just like you would expect. I received both slices and some heavily smoked ends ( the industry likes to call this the burnt ends but because they are cooked indirectly it is not burnt or charred it is simply heavily smoked and cooked more than the inside) both had unique flavor and a mild smoke finish. I really enjoyed it. The beans are AWESOME. These are absolutely homemade ( not prepared off site or out of a can and to the plate) The molasses finish is unlike anything I have found in the Midwest. These beans are ridiculous and I have to get more. the slaw was sweet and tasty and really complemented the meal it pared nice with the brisket and the sauce. It was obviously homemade and complex with lots of different types of veg and fresh ingredients. Finally the cornbread, it has a slight spiced finish with the down home sweetness of corn (possibly cream corn and honey) the piece on my plate and every one I could see was large 2.5x2.5x1.5 yes that is a nice piece of cornbread. It was moist and full of flavor. Heck it could be desert. To sum it up the food I received was perfect or close to perfect. My wife had similar remarks.

Service - Door to door incredible. I mentioned how busy they were and I can tell you that most restraints hit a threshold when they are busy and service is impacted. Nobel House is staffed well prepared for the busy times. The server seemed to enjoy working with us and had fun working to satisfy us. The beer was served perfectly the food came out fast and fresh. She checked on us at appropriate intervals and to top it off the owner proprietor visited our table to ask us how we enjoyed the meal and service and then for what ever reason brought the chief to our table to share a moment in his busy evening. We talked about some of his finer points that delivered such a special flavor to the table he shook my hand and quickly got back to his responsibilities. For me this is huge. I love it when I can build a relationship with a restaurant. Relationships build alliances for companies and even though this seems self evident many proprietors don&#39;t get it. 

To sum it up - We will be back and I can not wait to try other items on the menu. I am positive Nobel house will easily achieve a 5 star in the next couple of revisits. Those of you who follow me know I don&#39;t give a 5 on the first visit. (They deserved  a 5 but standards are standards)

Thank you Nobel House!"

Coors Light and Miller flow like water, the menu is filled with greasy Chicago staples like hot dogs, gyros, along with just about anything that&#39;s vaguely acceptable to toss into a deep fryer (The jalapeño poppers in specific are real great). The people watching is fantastic too, between the people who hang out at the bar and the folks nearby pumping a shocking amount of money into the slot machines.

Everyone who works at Run-A-Way is supremely friendly, and their prices are ridiculously low. It&#39;s totally possible to get dinner for two with drinks and walk out for under $25 with tip- Even less if you&#39;re willing to commit to a pitcher instead of buying beers by the pint. It&#39;s turned in to one of my favorite places in the area to go to.

Oh, and definitely try their sub sandwiches. I know, it sounds weird getting a sub from a place like this, but they&#39;re mind-blowing. Actually, the same can be said for just about everything I&#39;ve gotten there."

Decor: Unknown as my friend ran in to get the food.
Bathroom: I did not use the bathroom during this visit.

Staff: They said to allow 20mins, which we did, but then had to wait another 10-15mins once we arrived because the whole order still was not ready.

Food/Drink: We had the Fried Chicken (very good) and the Gyro Platter (very good as well). The menu is pretty standard bar food, which means that no matter who you are you will be able to find something enjoyable.

Value: The serving sizes here are HUGE so you definitely get your moneys worth. And the prices are really not too high so it&#39;s a great deal!

This place is fine and good in a pinch - my friend said it is kind of their go-to when they don&#39;t have any other options but that is mainly due to the location. I enjoyed the food and would eat form here again."

Our burgers fell apart into three and four pieces right out of the bun. it was impossible to eat. That is unacceptable. Came back for another meal because we really want to like this place. Tried the souvlaki. It was a very bland precooked cut up pork chop refried in oil with some dry seasoning sprinkled on it. Not the grilled marinated pork kabob that&#39;s souvlaki should be. We would love to see this establishment be successful. They need help with fixing their food.

This is relatively new ownership picking up the pieces of two popular Irish joints that found a way to fail. From my perspective, this is a crescendo of popularity...customers are not &#34;Running-A-Way!

Most &#34;Good Food Fast&#34; joints do not have a booze bar to accommodate your attendance. In my world, most would or could or should.

Basically this a family run operation, a huge dining area and a booze bar partitioned by wood and glass. The major change from past ownership is the flat top and char broiler are now a public spectacle. They cook up some decent grub.

I kind of view this as a hot dog joint that offers a side salad resembling a16oz PBR. But NO! The menu is extensive to the point of...well, more choices than you might expect! For all you slugs, they offer a &#34;Late Risers&#34; breakfast menu. For us normal people that have a liquid breakfast at an appropriate hour, the meat and potatoes offerings are extensive for lunch and dinner. You can order a gyros and fries or...&#34;Chicken Vesuvio&#34; with garlic potatoes, garlic toast and choice of soup or slaw for $8.95. Is this a Harry Caray&#39;s rendition? Hell No! They forgot the peas.

Back to the family run operation...I never ask names. The usual suspects here are &#34;Grandma&#34;, the &#34;Dad&#34;, his &#34;Kid&#34; and his &#34;Bride to Be&#34;. They hold court here daily.

I could say a lot more, and some day I just may get around to it!"

I usually have salad for lunch 2-3 days a week.  I&#39;d like to see a little more of a variety of vegetables on some salads, but there are certainly enough to choose from with options like additional gyros or chicken.

Speaking of gyros; best I&#39;ve ever had.  And the fries are awesome!  Crisp on the outside and hot and tasty on the inside.

The rotisserie chicken is a dinner favorite for my wife and me and the burgers are pretty good (4 out of 5) and the steak sandwiches are tasty.

The beef or chicken noodle soups are very good.

They have pepper and egg sandwiches on the regular menu, but among the sub sandwiches, no traditional Italian.

The owner is a great guy and will customize your order.  I always get a &#34;low carb plate&#34; and that can come several ways I like.

They have beefs and hot dogs that are very good too.

The waitstaff are very friendly and helpful.

I pass this place twice everyday and have always been curious about it.  With today being a holiday for me but not Kelly and based on all the other Yelp reviews, curiosity finally won out &amp; I went there for lunch today.  I had mentioned it as a lunch option occasionally to Kelly but she was a bit leery as the place does look like your standard dive from the outside.  

The place is interesting inside.  It&#39;s definitely older, divey looking place with a  dark wood decor.  Very wide open place inside with plenty of tables.  It&#39;s probably 2/3 sit-down restaurant/tables while the 1/3 is comprised of a bar area and fast food counter to place your order if you don&#39;t want to be sit first and be waited on.  The menu is diverse with a variety of samiches, salads, etc.  However, don&#39;t be fooled by the sit down portion of the place:   the core of the menu, while diverse, still revolves around  hot dogs, burgers, chicken and gyros.   

I walked in at lunchtime and was offered the option to order at the counter or sit down &amp; be waited on. As the place had 15-20  patrons (most of whom appeared to be regulars as the one waitress and other help were  talking to several people at length by name), I approached the counter.  I  was greeted by a  nice older greek/italian gentleman with a bit of an accent that I couldn&#39;t quite understand at first.  After a few minutes perusing the menu &amp; a few failed attempts on my part to completely understand him more due to poor hearing than the accent, I went with the grilled chicken samich in a pita with fries &amp; pop for $7.  While the staff and menu appeared to be heavily Greek-based with the  gyro the lead horse on the menu, I was trying to be somewhat healthier by ordering the chicken. I was given my fountain pop cup &amp; was told to take a seat and the food would be delivered shortly.  

After about 5 minutes, just enough to catch up with all things the debacle known as Richard Sherman from the Seahawks-Niners game,  my samich &amp; fries came out.  While the samich wasn&#39;t quite what I had envisioned, it was very good.  I was expecting your standard big pocket pita split on top with chicken, tomato, mayo, lettuce, etc all jammed inside.  What I was given was some thin pita bread akin to regular bread in 2 fairly large triangular wedges.  The pita, for as thin as it was, was very good.  The chicken was cooked perfectly:  fresh, tender, juicy, flavored well.  The fries were your standard, thicker cut, regular fries but good,  plentiful &amp; cooked just the way I like my women:  hot &amp; soft with some saltiness and enhanced with a condiment.  After inhaling the first half of my hot samich, I was approached by the friendly waitress for a refill on my pop.  I gladly accepted since the standard issue 16-22 oz pop cup is about 1/3 required to sate my thirst.    The fountain pop had he proper carbonation to syrup ratio so that too was good...though it was from the Pepsi family.  Always had a stronger preference for Coke products. 

All in all, the staff were all very nice &amp; friendly.  The food was very reasonably priced and tasty.  While not &#34;blow me away&#34; good, for $7,  I definitely got my money&#39;s worth and would go back. If you can not judge a book by it&#39;s cover, give this place a shot.  This place is definitely not one you should &#39;run-a-way&#39; from and a welcome option to your standard fast food meals."

Well, I made a few stops on the way home, picking up veggies for our gyros salads. Once I arrived home, I weighed the gyros and it turns out that my instinct was correct, it was 9.7 ounces of gyros meat, despite again, the staff lying to me that they weighed it.  Doesn&#39;t 1 pound = 16 ounces? Rhetorical question, yes it does! So, I sent them an IM that night (with a photo of the Gyros, reciept and scale reading) and guess what? No response! But, you know what? I&#39;m not really upset about being screwed out of more than 2/5ths of what I paid for because, you know, sh+$ happens; inattentive, bad or poorly trained employees, whatever.

Suddenly the hotdogs weren&#39;t as good, then the burger wasn&#39;t either, and then their signature chocolate cake went the way of the hotdog.  I don&#39;t eat food like this very often--not just because it isn&#39;t healthy, but because I don&#39;t want to--so when I do get the craves, boy do I get the craves, and no crappy burger from the famous fast food chains, or Portillo&#39;s, is going to satisfy me.  Thank the good lord I found this place; after more than a year of searching, I found a place that could satisfy my craving for good &#39;bad food&#39;.  I haven&#39;t even gotten around to trying the hotdog, but the burgers, the gyros, and the beefs are really good--flavorful, moist, and fatty without being greasy.

Located near Best Buy, it isn&#39;t the easiest place to find or get into, but it&#39;s absolutely worth it.  There is a drive-through for fast and convenient pickup, but I usually like to go inside to order.  It&#39;s become a &#39;lunch spot&#39; for me--meaning that I can have a meal for under fifteen bucks, but the cost is actually under $10 (for all the value meals) making it VERY affordable.  Yes, you could go to King McWendy&#39;s and pay less, but the food here is much better.  I&#39;ve eaten inside and carried out, and it&#39;s a surprisingly clean and comfortable spot to eat your food piping hot if you have the time, but the food is just as good carried-out, if not sometimes a little more messy.  Service has also been good--professional and efficient--and though the food takes a little longer than typical fast food joints, it&#39;s probably because it&#39;s fresher and made to order.  HOWEVER, they also have a website that allows you to browse the menu and place an order (with plenty of options and the the ability to add special instructions), which is VERY convenient of you&#39;re ordering for a good number of people and have limited time to eat.  I also have to mention that, if you save your receipt and return within five days, you get a 10% discount off your bill--nice.

Again, I haven&#39;t actually tried that many items offered here--despite the fact that I&#39;ve had food from here about a dozen times, but it&#39;s because every time I try something new I have to have it several times.  Can&#39;t complain about that, right?  Now, about the food that I&#39;ve tried:

     The burger here is awesome, moist and flavorful for being well-done, and with the addition of bacon it&#39;s perfect!  I LOVE when a hamburger has the distinct flavor of beef.

     The Italian beef is also really good, served on a tastier, crustier, more substantial piece of bread that&#39;s capable of sustaining all that beef and flavorful jus.  Get your sweet peppers or your hot peppers and you&#39;ve got a great beef that can pretty much stand up to any other beef in the area.

     The gyro sandwich is also freaking AWESOME, beautifully browned and very tasty, and served with a generous amount of tasty tzatziki, onions, and tomato.  They REALLY pile on the meat too; you have to eat almost half of it before you can even fold the damn pita--not that I&#39;m complaining!

I still intend to try the hotdog, the corndog, the chicken souvlaki sandwich, the salads, and the fried mushrooms and zucchini, but I can&#39;t imagine that they&#39;re going to be so bad that I have to rethink the rating.  Already I love this place for the three things I have tried; I mean, even if everything else is crap, I&#39;d still be coming here pretty often.  I think I HAVE to go with five stars; I mean, a clean place where I can get an affordable, delicious burger from friendly/polite staff??  That alone is worth five stars to me."

I envy those who have had cause to eschew these halls of horror, but for many of us who either do not have the time or gumption to light a stove, or live the modern stopless life, fast food is a grudge match we play with our stomachs. 
There are heroes, though. Mostly Greek. 
They take the humdrum plots of the stories told by Hacks like McDonald, Burger King, KFC and the especially wretched ChickFilA and stage them with impeccable prose. Their versions sing, they dance, they float in the air. A lot of them are named Nicky.
At Nicky&#39;s joint they worship fresh, they appreciate clean, they take it seriously, and above all, they take pride in what they serve.
The French Fries at Nicky&#39;s prolly aren&#39;t any better for you than the tasteless sticks you get at the chains, and no one will ever confuse the rest of Nicky&#39;s menu with the Vegan pop-ups that snooty Liberals pretend to adore. But if you find a good &#34;Nicky&#39;s&#34;  (like the one here that just happens to be CALLED &#34;Nicky&#39;s) You can get something to eat that&#39;s worth eating in a short time and you wont feel a draft in your wallet.
Gyros that&#39;s close to Halsted Street Quality, A Hamburger made with care, A Chicken breast that is recognizable as having come from a Chicken and not an extrusion press. Salads with crisp greens and home-made dressing, If you&#39;re lucky, the odd Souvlaki or Spanakopita. They also serve a fine Chicago HotDog (Vienna, natch.)
When you get done scarfing a Nicky&#39;s meal down, you might have a little guilt for a calorie splurge, but you won&#39;t have that familiar sick &#34;Why the fuck did I just eat that?&#34; malaise you get after a Big Mac.
There&#39;s nothing to celebrate at McDonalds, Even less to get excited about at Burger King. The only reason to go to ChickFilA is their Lemonade and clean toilets (provided you don&#39;t need to piss on a Sunday). 
There are bunches of reasons to go to Nicky&#39;s (either this one or its brother on Ogden Ave in Naperville, or the one in Lockport). 
And all of those reasons are listen on their menu..."

I&#39;ve been going to the Ogden Avenue original location since I moved to Naperville 17 years ago and it is always good.   This location is o.k.-menu is not as expansive, and I don&#39;t feel the value as much as I have at the other location (portions are decent here).

Good burgers (patty melt) and traditional Greek quick service sandwich fare-gyros (chicken and lamb/beef), souvlaki (pork or chicken) and the Greek potatoes are the side to get (fries are average at best).

1.  Try an establishment I haven&#39;t been to (I&#39;m a Panera addict.)
2.  And that place has to have a drive-thru window, because it&#39;s cold outside.

Nicky&#39;s it is!  I ordered a chicken gyro with fries and a Dr. Pepper.  My total was about $9 (a gyro and fries at Gemato&#39;s is more than this).  The wait at the drive-thru wasn&#39;t bad, about what I&#39;d expect - 3 minutes maybe?  And the girl said &#34;gyro&#34; rolling the &#34;G&#34; and made it sound like a fun musical instrument.

The gyro was good.  Better than Doggie Diner (Plainfield), but I still think Gemato&#39;s is better.  The meat was well seasoned, but there wasn&#39;t enough honey mustard.  I scraped off some of the lettuce - it looked like it had gone through a paper shredder.

Fries were hot, fresh and salty.  Still, Gemato&#39;s has better fries.

The location is sort of crummy.  You have to weave in and out of that Best Buy plaza parking lot, with stop signs on weird angles.  So if you&#39;re not used to driving in that plaza it could be irritating.  I know where the lights are, and which turns are for southbound traffic only, so it doesn&#39;t bother me.

Nicky&#39;s has a drive-thru and doesn&#39;t have the creepy greasy-looking dudes that the other place does.  So head to Nicky&#39;s to save a few cents, stay warm and avoid the creep factor."

Now that I have your attention...

We discovered Nicky&#39;s when we hopped in the car to go to the KFC that USED to be there - and what a pleasant surprise! (as would any non-KFC restaurant would be..)

The first thing that wowed us was the remodeling of the building - it is GORGEOUS.  They seriously transformed that old, run-down red KFC barn into a hip brick BBQ/Greek hang-out (which I realized is probably the weirdest sentence I&#39;ve ever written).  While we haven&#39;t been inside yet, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just as nice!

They have a ton of stuff on the menu, but we&#39;re a sucker for their Italian beef...dipped, with mozzarella, of course.  The first time we had them, they were decent...but last night, they were AWESOME.  I can only imagine what the 3rd time will be like! ::squeals::

Let me preface this next part by saying that I can handle spicy foods about as well as Elizabeth Taylor can handle husbands...but I could live off of their jalapeno poppers for the rest of my life.

This new location is very nice inside. A little smaller, but has a drive thru. They&#39;ve changed up the menu a bit to make it easier to order at the drive thru, with some numbered meals and kids meals. 

My favs at either/both locations: grilled cheese, hot dog, fries, jalapeno poppers, cheese sticks, and best of all is the Spanikopita (or spinach pie). 

If you&#39;ve never had spanikopita, it&#39;s phyllo dough with spinach, feta, and seasonings. Salty, creamy deliciousness. 

Dessert options include baklava, tiramisu, cheesecake, and ice cream."

We always get the same thing: gyros platter. Why? Because it&#39;s just so damn good. I like it because the meat is not dry like other places or stale. You can tell when the meat&#39;s been just sitting there and it develops this crust on it. Not good. 

I get the Greek potatoes and Greek salad as sides. If the daily soup is Cream of Chicken Rice then I get that instead of the salad. I love their cream soup. It&#39;s a pretty sizable portion of food for the amount you pay.

This is definitely one of my favorites."

My daughter, who will inhale most any hot dog, wouldn&#39;t take a second bite. I tried the dog and it was pretty nasty. Like a boiled dog that&#39;s been sitting in the water all day.

I&#39;m a Chicago girl and when I get a Vienna, I have extremely high expectations (yes, even for 99 cents) and the relish wasn&#39;t neon green and the tomatoes were sliced pretty thick, although the sport peppers they used where PERFECT.

Fries aren&#39;t crispy, I don&#39;t care, but I think it&#39;s cooked in bacon fat, yummy. Burger was handsome with the nice looking, shiny brioche.

And making u-turns. And trying to (safely) cross traffic. I finally realized that Urban Counter is physically inside the BP Gas Station. So, word to the wise! 

I placed a to-go order and was told my food would be ready in about 15-20 minutes so I was a bit surprised when I arrived 25 minutes later that it was still about 5-10 min out. No biggie, though, I filled up my tank and waited in the (very) clean BP. The food was all made fresh by a few friendly guys at a cute little counter next to a smattering of tables. We ordered eats for a variety of folks, from grilled cheese to burgers, sandwiches to fries and here&#39;s how we made out...

Fries: 3/5: I prefer a crispy fry and this was lacking in crisp and salt. Points for being freshly fried. I appreciate the sweet potato option, though. 
BLT: 3/5: Huge and made with thick cut bacon. Flavorful but the bacon was a bit chewy (again, would prefer more crisp) and the avocado was teeny tiny. 
Portions: 4/5: Even item I ordered offered super hearty portions. You will not go hungry. 
Execution: 3/5: I ordered fruit cups and they were forgotten. Bummer. That and considering the longer time to ready my food, I give execution a 3/5. 

I love the concept of a freshly made burger, especially with such a convenient slant. If the execution was ramped up a bit, I can see Urban Counter being a go-to!"

So that ultra rare burger must have been okay. I only get 40 minute max work breaks and this place is 10+ minutes away so I called ahead today (which I had to do twice, no answer or message the first time) for a signature bleu cheese burger combo. When I arrived, it hadn&#39;t even been started though. So while I ordered it mid-rare, I started pacing around nervously a few minutes into him cooking it and he changed it to to-go packaging. I sat down there and ate it anyway as intended and it was damn near raw in the middle. But I took a chance and my existence seems okay so far...

Urban Counter makes big  1/2 lb pub style burgers. I&#39;ve had the bbq bacon cheese and it was good but overcooked last time. Today&#39;s was undercooked but that&#39;s half my fault...and it was still delicious with bleu cheese, bacon, caramelized onions and arugula. Fries are fresh cut style and quite tasty but can be on the wilted/soggy side like today.

I had the giant breakfast burrito once and it was fab! With sausage, egg, onion, peppers, cheese and some other goodness. Easily splittable and only $4?!

The fries were pretty good. They are fried with the skin...fyi for those who don&#39;t like their fries like that.

The second I walked up to the counter I was greeted by a plesant gentleman. So polite and smiled during our interaction which always makes me feel welcome.

It was one of the better burgers I&#39;ve had in a while.  The sweet potato fries were delicious as well.  On this visit, the regular fries were just okay. I would stick with the sweet potatoes.

We did have a problem with one burger being raw on the inside.  It was put on the grill after the others, but removed at the same time.  The staff was very apologetic and the young man that cooked it came to our table later and said that he just wanted to apologize again for the burger and was very gracious.  We were very happy with the customer service and food.  I&#39;ll be back.

All of that together was under $10 with tax. Burger places coming go, but let me paint a picture of what the burger looked like. The burgers are made to order, the patties are hand pressed, and are half pound (we realized later that you can order mini-burgers if the half pound is too big). The burger is on a toasted brioche bun, the meat was perfectly seasoned, and the bacon is thick cut. Once they brought the burger out, I was blown away at the presentation of the burger (remember, this is a gas station) for what I paid for it. Most places would charge you $13 for the burger I ordered.  I finished my burger in minutes because it was one of the best burgers I&#39;ve ever had. This place is a gem within a gas station.

The folks who made our meal were clearly proud of their work, and we could taste the love in every bite.  My husband ordered the blue cheese burger and a strawberry milkshake.  His shake tasted of fresh strawberries, and his burger was literally perfect, with the exception of (in my opinion) too-sweet bacon.  I ordered the bacon burger (opting for spicy mustard + mayo instead of the BBQ sauce called for on the menu).  I made it a combo meal with fries and a drink (loved the frozen Coke option).  My burger was close-to-perfect (the sweet bacon was a small disappointment), and I LOVED the jalapeno spread and onion rings as toppings.  

There are healthy options for those who choose not to indulge in burgerrific.  But I imagine that I will go back when I want a naughty meal.  I might try their reuben next."

Let&#39;s talk about how this place is in a gas station and how that&#39;s actually pretty awesome! Except if you have kids. Who want to walk all through the gas station picking up candy bars and such. You end up buying way too much crap.

The food was dynamite. The service.....................omghowfreakingslow. We were the only ones there and it was super, super calm and two workers. We ordered three burgers. The order was messed up and took ages and they kept coming back and checking on what we wanted, like I didn&#39;t already specify toppings at the counter. I paid too much because they rang me up for the wrong thing and didn&#39;t know how to refund me (FINE, just feeeeeed me), so we took leftovers home.

Food was legit. Except sweet potato fries. Get the regular. Those trendy ones are straight from a bag. Not impressive. But the regular are fresh cut and darn good.

We might be back, but I&#39;m bringing a newspaper to pass the time."

 Hubby was hungry for a cheeseburger. I pulled this place up on yelp since it was right by the errand we were running. 
Of course he was more than skeptical. I wore him down and he finally agreed.
In all fairness, it is attached to a BP station. 
Don&#39;t think of it as a resteraunt in a gas station.  Think of it as a resteraunt with the convenience of having a gas station in the resteraunt. 
But, enough of that...
The burgers are 1/2lb of delicious cheesy goodness on a brioche bun with fresh vegies. 
Definately a meatatarian&#39;s delight.
The fries were pretty good as well.  
Unfortunately, that was all the room I had in my belly to sample today. (I did try to talk hubby into a shake but was informed I was pushing my luck)
Definately will be stopping by and trying more of their menu!"

That being said we ordered their hand cut fries and they had been cooked earlier and when they were packaged with our order he did not throw them back in the oil to crisp them up so when we ate them they were here cold and soggy. I also think that this place is a bit expensive for food served in a gas station.

I&#39;ve had the bacon burger, blue cheese burger, and southwestern salad. All of these were very good. This place was quickly becoming a favorite of mine because of the food quality. Not everything is good: the chili cheese fries seem to just use canned chili, and the cheese fries use generic &#34;cheese&#34; sauce instead of real melted cheese for some reason. The mozzarella sticks were also limp instead of crisp and seemed like they were frozen previously.

The thing that really disappoints me and leads to only 3 stars is their recent change to delivery policy. I found them on grubhub and used delivery multiple times. Now the site says they don&#39;t deliver to my area. When I called about it, they only deliver up to 1 mile away. What&#39;s the point of that? I could walk 1 mile to get the food. I only live 2 miles away from them and was becoming a loyal customer. The convenience of delicious food was nice, but it&#39;s not really worth driving there for."

I wouldn&#39;t have ordered delivery if I was able to come in. I said that wasn&#39;t acceptable and they said they would let the guy know when he got back. Turns out the delivery guy was the manager. He came back right away and apologized (something the guys on the phone didn&#39;t do), gave me an extra brownie and a coupon for a free meal.

I don&#39;&#39;t think that Jam n Jelly accepts reservations, but after we put our names on the list, I think we only had to wait around 15 minutes before being seated. 

I was in an omelette mood, so I decided to try their lox omelette.  Before my visit, I&#39;d had omelette&#39;s and lox separately, but not together.  I knew I was kind of taking a risk, but decided to go for it anyways.  The lox omelette was okay, but it was a little dry and lacked flavor.  I think that this omelette option should be revamped by adding another ingredient like capers, or something along those lines.

&#34;I don&#39;t know; she&#39;s petting that kid.&#34;

We were already planning to be nearby, so we decided to have brunch at Jam N Jelly.  It was a beautiful day, so we requested to sit on the patio.  We placed that request after a few bumbling moments of confusion trying to figure out if the girl at the front desk even worked there since she clung to her cell phone, wandered back and forth between the hostess stand and a group of little kids, and then started to pet one on the head.

We only waited a few minutes before we were seated.  I ordered the Spring Omelet with brie, tomatoes, and asparagus.  I subbed the onions for mushrooms.  This was a generous sized omelet, served with a side of hash browns and toast of pancakes (I had the Greek toast).  I spread the raspberry jam on my toast, which was delicious.  My omelet was good, but could have benefited from a more flavorful ingredient.

My friends often order the hot chocolate there, as they&#39;re a fan of the marshmallows that come on top.

Their skillets also come with pancakes, which you can upgrade to their specialty pancakes if you desire. And desire, I did. I love me some potato pancakes, and these were fresh homemade, perfectly crisp around the edges, and oniony-potatoey on the inside. 

They give you enough food for two people, or two meals, so come hungry or else you&#39;ll be sharing or taking some home, or walking away feeling like a pig...like I did. Oh well. What&#39;s another few miles on the trail, right?

Service was quick, pleasant and friendly. And they were able to seat me right away on a busy Saturday morning. I&#39;d say it all worked out in my flavor. So punny. Give &#39;em a try!"

The cafe felt warm and inviting with calm, nature-y shades of green and orange on the inside. The decor was a sort of modern chic, embellished with paintings and wall mounts that brought different aspects of nature - mainly trees and leaves - to make for a calming and casual atmosphere. 

We went on a Thursday morning, so the noise level and overall ambiance was just right. There were plenty of people, although no doubt the place would be much more crowded and probably louder on weekends. But the service was great, and staff was very friendly. 

The FOOD here is delicious! The first thing we noticed was that there was a LOT on the menu. They have a large variety of breakfast foods, and plenty of lunch options to choose from as well. Prices seemed very average. My sister ordered the Chocolate Fruit Crepe and I ordered the Cafe Skillet. Both dishes were tasty and very filling. And in my opinion, no breakfast restaurant can get five stars if they don&#39;t offer freshly squeezed orange juice - seeing oranges and a juice machine through the window when I walked in assured me I wouldn&#39;t be disappointed. Both their coffee and fresh OJ were awesome.

We&#39;re glad we came into Jam n&#39; Jelly, and will definitely be coming back soon! Highly recommended for anyone to try!"

I think their skillets are just average, but I&#39;ve had good omelets and the pancakes and waffles are great.  The hostess is usually friendly, but the waiters and waitresses can be short and impatient. 

What moved me to write a review was the beignets.  &#34;Are the beignets, bad?&#34; you ask.  I&#39;m not sure.  &#34;Well, are they good then?&#34; you reply.  I can&#39;t say.  The beignets aren&#39;t even on the menu.  &#34;Well why are you writing about them then?&#34; I can hear you yelling at the screen.  

The beignets are an off-menu item at Jam and Jelly.  They make them.  I&#39;m just not sure how to get any.  I&#39;ve never been able to try them, EVEN when I ask for them.  When I have asked for them, I get &#34;we just ran out&#34;, or &#34;the cook who makes them isn&#39;t in today&#34;.  Apparently I look like an idiot because I can see them on half of the other tables as well as see servers bringing them out to people.  I thought maybe they were for big parties, but no.  I&#39;ve seen couples have them on their table.  I KNOW they are complimentary, also, because I&#39;ve heard waitresses say as much.  Today, my waitress tells me again &#34;we ran out&#34;.  I point to another table who just got theirs, and they say &#34;well, we just can&#39;t make anymore&#34;.  I told her that every time I ask for them I get some sort of excuse.  She returns 5 minutes later and tells me the cook will make them for $6.95.  That was insulting.  

Here&#39;s some unsolicited advice:  If they are free, then make them free for everyone.  If you want to charge for them (and you have every right to), put them on the menu and let anyone who wants them order them.  Don&#39;t insult the intelligence of your patrons."

They have their stuff together here, and it comes through from the moment you walk in the door, to the moment you pay your bill and leave.  Even if there&#39;s a crowd, (especially on weekend mornings) they will hand you a pager, and give a pretty close estimate of wait times.  Even thought they are busy, once seated, you never feel rushed to get through your meal, and lingering over another cup of coffee is not frowned upon.  The service, from the host or hostess to the servers have been nothing but stellar ever time.  

The food here is great!  I&#39;m a breakfast fanatic, while my husband is more of a lunchy kind of guy.  This place pleases us both.  Start with a cup of their fantastic regular coffee, and move on to the breakfast.  I&#39;ve had the French toast, which is great, and a few assorted omlete and egg dishes.  I would suggest getting something with toast, because when you ask for jelly, they don&#39;t bring out a few individual packets, but a nicely presented dish of two different kinds of amazingly tasty fruit spreads.  I&#39;ve yet to pick a bad tasting dish here.  

I&#39;m also in love with the decor. Natural light coming in from the windows, light brown wall colors, and light and non-garish and complementary wall decor make your surroundings comfortable, and the booths are spacious, well padded and very comfortable.

PS- Please never, ever confuse this place with the similarly named Honey-Jam cafe.  This place is better."

I ordered an egg beater omelette with some veggies, and my brother ordered the spring omelette, which had some veggies, brie, and cage free eggs. We both ordered the healthy cakes and made them nutty (you will understand when you read menu. Actually, we just had multigrain batter infused with walnuts and fresh banana).

The service was fantastic. It took 13 minutes from order to table. I know I&#39;m weird that I time these things, but that is extremely efficient! The restaurant was crowded when we arrived, but it cleared out once we were seated.

The waitress was very nice. IT was a bit on the expensive side, but that&#39;s the price I pay for ordering special things and being semihealthy. Sue me I guess.

The only knock I had on this place was that I was charged 1.20 for 2 cups of salsa. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the salsa was fantastic, and it may have even been made in the restaurant, but charging me for a condiment? COME ON! I won&#39;t complain too much because everything else was awesome.

If you are in the area, I highly recommend Jam and Jelly. THe menu is actually quite diverse. They offer plenty of breakfast items, and they also offer sandwiches, wraps, and salads for those wanting lunch. I love breakfast too much to not order that here!"

Sometimes a wait during peak times on weekends, but that is expected. Even with a crowd at the entrance rarely do we wait much more than 10-15 minutes.

The flavor and options at this place are unlike the location of this place (which is hidden). The menu is HUGE featuring egg specials, omelets, pancakes, waffles, french toast, and a FULL lunch menu. I knew exactly what I wanted just like Americans stormed Normandy. I wanted victory. This came in the form of breakfast.

Browsing the menu, I always like making a more nutritious choice than plain buttermilk pancakes. Since my brother (and frequent Yelp reviewer) like trying new places and are similar (twins), we both go about getting multiple options so we can try anything!

Initially, we wanted to get a side order of two &#34;Nutty Cakes&#34; and a side order of &#34;Healthy Cakes&#34;. As I told the waitress, who was lovely by the way, it would be a complicated order. I decided to do the unthinkable.

 I decided I was going to go with the Healthy Grain batter...but with their &#34;Nutty Cake&#34; toppings of fresh bananas and walnuts for my side pancakes. It was an eggcellent choice...almost as eggcellent as my Spring Omelet featuring asparagus, brie cheese, tomato, onions and made with cage free eggs! My brother built his own with Egg Beaters and we both REALLY ENJOYED our omelets and pancakes! The coffee I ordered was mediocre at best, but if that&#39;s the worst part of my meal...so be it! There was an up-charge, but I mean if the restaurant has to pay more since I like extra vitamins A, C, D, and K plus fiber, oh well. 

My brother was charged extra for his two giant cups of salsa; He actually let me have a little bit. It had a nice kick of jalapeno and chili seeds and was definitely worth the extra charge. It kicked up the meal a notch. Like Emeril, BAM!

I would LOVE to go back to the Greek style, local joint, and family friendly place. My brother and I were surprised by all the orders of the older-ish, book club, retiree women. Gyros, Chicken Caesar Wraps, Poached Eggs, and Belgian waffles were ordered all around us. Our waitress actually was surprised that my brother and I ate our omelets, pancakes, and fruit; even though calorically all of the items around us were more. The sad state of obesity in America. Oh well! As we left with our bill of $34, our waitress asked how old we were. She though 19; We are actually 24. This could have been due to the fact that I have a velcro wallet, we dress like high school students, and both had high school facial hair (think not shaven in two days...scruffy). It&#39;s Greek to me! CUE THE SAGANAKI...OPAH!!! I love Greeks!

I read in another review that they are owned by Portillo&#39;s,,,but I think that person is confusing this one of a kind joint with Honey Jam Cafe. I usually say away from chains for that reason. 

I would go back to this place in a heart beat. The food, service, and ambiance make my heart skip a beat...but don&#39;t worry, I did not have a heart attack since I got cage free eggs!

If you&#39;re in a jam, go with Jam N Jelly!"

On my last visit in March with a girlfriend, as soon as we walked in we were quickly greeted by the owner, Teddy.  He was very friendly and warm.  Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t have enough time to dine in so we had some food made to go.  

I ordered the Gyro Meat platter and my friend had a some sort of crepes with chocolate sauce and fruits.  She says that they have very good Eggs Benedict here but I haven&#39;t tried it.  I thought my gyros tasted OK but it wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had.  The meat was drier than I would have liked and the portion didn&#39;t seem that large for an approximate $10 lunch.   She ordered some kind of crepes with chocolate syrup with fruits and whipped cream.  That dish was a large size and by the end she just thought it was all too sweet together.  I

Overall, I think that this place is quite nice and is a good spot for brunch with friends to catch up.  It&#39;s a good concept but I wouldn&#39;t be able to afford breakfast here every day.  And as tempting as it is to make a stop over place after my workout at Xsport, I probably shouldn&#39;t if I don&#39;t want to negate all of my efforts ;D."

Pulled up to a mostly non-descript strip mall area with a sign that said &#34;Restaurant&#34; on the outside.  However, this unambitious exterior hid a warm, beautiful inside with tasty food on an overwhelming menu with way too many choices.

Coffee:  Not impressive unfortunately.  Perhaps they need a different roast, but the wife didn&#39;t much enjoy the flavor.

Irish Skillet:  Canned corn beef hash with potatoes and two over easy eggs.  Serving size was just right and over easy eggs were just the right amount of flow to the yolks.  Came with two pancakes which were light, fluffy, and sweet.  

Country fried steak:  Tasty gravy, more breading than meat, which is a typical hallmark of country fried steaks, and some nicely done toast.  

Service:  Uber-friendly with lots of smiles, and overly apologetic when they accidentally charged us for two coffees instead f one.  

Verdict:  Diner style food done right, while not exceptional, is highlighted by excellent service at a reasonable price.  Worth checking out if you&#39;re looking for a change up from your normal breakfast spots.  We&#39;ll likely be back with the family for a nice Sunday morning breakfast."

I think the real criticism should go to their food supplier, the Skirt Steak was tough and their bacon was horrible, it&#39;s pretty hard to cook bacon to come out horrible so it must be the bacon to start with, it was like eating a salt lick.

 We also requested well done hash browns and they were barely browned and tasted of vegetable oil. The eggs and toast were pretty good.

I would have to say that it is almost too hidden. I never even knew a restaurant existed in this space. It is easy to get lost in the area of giant strip malls!

The restaurant is rather sparsely yet rather nicely decorated and very well kept. Just by the looks of the interior, I was expecting a rather overpriced meal but I was pleasantly surprised. 

Our server was great and our meal was great and it didn&#39;t break the wallet at all. As mentioned in the name, their spin is jelly and did a good job of presenting their highlighted condiment!

Although the entire meal was fantastic and satisfying, I was surprised that just standard, ordinary bread was used to make their toast. It was not bad by any means. The name kind of implies a focus on one of my favorite breakfast side dishes so it was a bit of a let down.

Overall this restaurant was a great find! Since I am in the area quite a bit, I am going to be sure to visit again and again!"

Excellent food I recommend the Irish skillet! Probably the best cornbeef and hash browns I&#39;ve ever had. One thing that could make it perfect is if they used chunky cornbeef, but that&#39;s just a personal preference. Also the allow you to get French toast instead of just pancakes or plain toast for no extra charge. And you can have your eggs any way you want. I usually get one sunny side up and the other scrambled. 

The worst part about coming here is that their time management is horrible. We called to ask how long the wait was they replied &#34;no wait&#34;. We arrived 3 minutes after calling only to find out there was a 15 minute wait. The ugliest part of this lie in is that 10-15 minutes wait really means 20-30. They tell you 10-15 just so you don&#39;t go somewhere else. This is the only flaw in this nice place."

Sunday brunch feels like a weekly holiday celebration before you take on your week. Then you do it all over again! Jam n&#39; Jelly exceeds my brunch expectation. The hot brunch spot is hidden in a small plaza on Lemont and 75th. I believe my first reaction was &#34;Huh? Is this the place?&#34; Please don&#39;t be fooled by the outside. I will admit I was a little skeptical at first glance. My boyfriend and I were hungry and floating around Naperville, and stumbled upon this place... thanks to the Yelp App on my iPhone. 

The interior is nice and our server is nice... blah blah. Let me jumped into the food. One thing that&#39;s great about brunching with your boyfriend is sharing two plates. My boyfriend and I ordered the Mediterranean Omelets for something savory and the Stuffed Peaches &amp; Cream French Toast for our sweet cravings. Usually when you go to a restaurant, you might like one component on the plate, but you might think everything else is okay. At the end, you might consider it a good meal. At Jam n Jelly, I loved EVERYTHING on both plates. The Mediterranean Omelet was probably the best omelet I had in awhile, but the French toast was a real treat. The cream is injected inside the toast, and the caramelized peaches placed on top. The toast was toasted and crunchy in the right places. When you take a bite, you can taste the lovely cream melted in your mouth. I wished I had more room in my stomach to try something else, but I was so full. 

Overall I enjoyed my time and Jam n Jelly... obviously. The price is pretty reasonable. I really enjoyed glancing at their menu and reading the descriptions. I would describe the menu as being &#34;comfortably-creative.&#34; They don&#39;t try to distract you with the bells and whistles on the plates. The food really speaks for itself."

We sat down and got the fresh squeezed OJ which was very good and fresh. We didn&#39;t know what to order because the menu was sooo large. They had a lot of choices! We finally decided and I ordered the Mediterranean omelet, which is unlike me b/c I typically go the safe route and get a waffle, my friend ordered the Greek skillet and pancakes which looked amazing, I tasted the pancake which was light and fluffy and very good, not like any other pancake I&#39;d tasted (not a big pancake fan).

The prices are similar to Egg Harbor, but the food isn&#39;t as good. Been here for both breakfast and lunch, and wasn&#39;t wowed either time. Had the quesadilla on my most recent visit and can honestly say I&#39;ve made better at home for a fraction of the cost. It was very bland.

Hostess was friendly and I was seated promptly, but our party&#39;s waitress was pretty bad -- slow with refills and could barely hear her over the ambient noise. The only time she moved in a timely fashion was when we asked for our check. She brought that at once and was promptly back to take the cash to the register. Otherwise, it was like she was wearing cement shoes. What made it even more disappointing was that the other waiters and waitresses serving tables around us seemed to be doing a phenomenal job.
 
There&#39;s quite a selection of good breakfast places in the area and this place is always packed, but for the life of me I can&#39;t understand why. To me, it&#39;s just average."

This place is hard to find. It&#39;s on the far corner in a strip mall and only reads RESTAURANT in green on the building. It does say Jam N Jelly Cafe on the door but we didn&#39;t see that until we got closer. Deceiving, and the reason I don&#39;t think we were ready for this jelly. This Cafe was just too delicious for us babe! The food was lookin&#39; hot and smellin&#39; good! 

The menu had an abundance of mouth watering choices, but I had to go with the bananas foster Belgian waffle. It had caramelized bananas on top of a steaming hot waffle with cinnamon and powdered sugar. Each bite was a pocket filled with maple syrup and gooey banana goodness! So yummy. My boyfriend got the eggs Benedict over crab cakes. No complaints other than the hash-browns got cold quick. They were perfectly crispy though. We both had coffee and I had a glass of OJ. It was like I just bit into an orange. I&#39;m sure it was freshly squeezed.

My wife and I went for the first time on Valentine&#39;s Day (our anniversary) for breakfast. We were seated within 60 seconds. Literally 3 seconds later there was a carafe of ice water with lemon and two clean glasses at my table. Literally 5 seconds later my server introduced herself and poured our waters. Within  this time, the manager had already spoken and everyone was smiling!

The food was amazing! We ordered eggs, sausage, bacon and french toast. I remarked at the beautiful pancakes at another table, and just like that the manager delivered a complimentary short stack with powdered sugar, whipped butter and warm syrup. Later he had two glasses of orange juice sent out. Complimentary as well. I could tell they were whole oranges just an hour or so ago.  Exceptional quality of food. Really the best experience I&#39;ve had in quite some time eating out! They also brought toast (tastes like it&#39;s made there; I forgot to ask) and homemade jams with whipped butter. 

The service was fast. Efficient. They knew when to come to the table and when not to. Our server was very pleasant. The value for the quality of food is great. Can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t been here before. We&#39;ll be back. With guests. For lunch too."

Compared to a lot of other breakfast/lunch places in the area it&#39;s relatively new, so it has nice decor and comfortable seating.

My wife loves Eggs Benedict and decided to try the Benedict Skillet.  I had the Mexican skillet.  The food was very good - the Chorizo was flavorful and spicy, but not too hot to eat.

The one downside was the service - we ended up waiting by the door for close to 10 minutes...the restaurant wasn&#39;t full and there was no line.  Once we were seated, the coffee didn&#39;t come around too often, and the food took quite awhile for a restaurant that wasn&#39;t busy.

Considering I eat out for breakfast almost every weekend of my life, I feel I am more than qualified to write this review.  Quick background check: I was born and raised in Darien, and I have ate at all the other breakfast restaurants in the Darien, DG, Hinsdale, Burr Ridge, WIllowbrook area.  Jam &#39;n&#39; Jelly is on a whole other level compared to Egg Harbor, Downers Delight, Blueberry Hill, Moondance Diner, etc.

With it being a relatively new breakfast restaurant, you can see that they went above and beyond to make this a presentable place to dine in.  Jam &#39;n&#39; Jelly is actually a very nice, clean restaurant. 

Food: The menu is huge, and so are the portions.  A great bang for your buck.  I frequently order the Mediterranean Omelette - it&#39;s amazing!!  Other times I just get the classic 3 eggs your way, with hashbrowns, toast, and bacon.  Speaking of bacon, their bacon is extremely delicious.  They must get it from some top-of-the-line butcher because they are extra thick cuts.  Plus, they cook it to perfection - extra crispy.... 

Staff: Very friendly, accomodating, and inviting.  They take your order, keep the coffee mugs full, and serve you quick.  I couldn&#39;t ask for more.

Lastly, I would like to point out that they have some solid coffee mugs.  I drink copious amounts of coffee, and nothing upsets me more to see a dinky coffee mug that is empty within a minute.  Jam &#39;n&#39; Jelly gives me a good size mug that&#39;s built to last, and when I&#39;m empty, the cute lookin waitress is right there to top me off."

We were a group of about 12, and they were able to easily accommodate us with just a 10 minute call ahead.  

The place looks really nice for a suburban breakfast/diner-type establishment (most of them look the same, and this has its own feel). Our waiter was informative, funny and really efficient. Pretty much the optimal situation for work lunch dining. He ran off all the different jams/jellies quickly and from memory (I went with the jalapeno raspberry and would recommend it to any friend who doesn&#39;t mind heat). 

I opted to have the Mexican skillet because I am a sucker for anything containing chorizo. I saw several other dishes coming out ahead of mine and thought I might regret my decision because everything looked amazing. But then that delightful plate meant for me came out and I knew I&#39;d chosen the right one. The eggs were perfect, they didn&#39;t skimp on the meat, and the potatoes had a good bite to them. All in all it was breakfast-for-lunch success. 

At the end, they brought out a giant dessert waffle. This thing had ice cream, chocolate sauce and whipped cream atop it. It made its way around our table of 12 twice and there was still quite a bit left. Generosity, thy name is Jam &#39;n&#39; Jelly. 

Seriously, if you&#39;re looking for good breakfast dining in the Darien area, come here. You shan&#39;t regret."

The food was ok, the service was on insulting, but the patrons were what really spoiled my otherwise mediocre visit to this eatery.  Apparently a patron named &#34;Carol&#34; is a frequent diner at this location.  My co-worker and I had the pleasure of meeting carol.  We were first scolded and belittled for taking &#34;her&#34; spot.  As normal parking lot etiquette dictates, one uses their turn signal to indicate intent.  Carol was dropping off a gaggle of her senior citizen friends at the front door where she had her hazards on and was facing oncoming traffic.  There was a van about to move so we signaled and waited for the van to pull out.  As it did, we parked as intended and was walking to the front door.  On our journey to the entrance that when we were scolded by Carol.  The scolding doesn&#39;t stop there.  Upon entering and assisting another geriatric couple out of the establishment we were then scolded by Carol&#39;s gang of unruly seniors who also accused us of stealing Carol&#39;s spot.  To add insult to injury the hostess even sided with the seniors and spoke her opinion on the matter.  At this juncture we decided to leave since we would probably get pubic hair or at a bare minimum an unsanitary appendage dipped in our food.

Here&#39;s what stood out:

Service - the service was top notch! We sat there talking as we looked over the menu, and probably took longer than we should&#39;ve to place our order. At some places, you feel rushed, like you&#39;er annoying the server because you&#39;re taking too long. Here, our waitress checked on us periodically, but didn&#39;t make us feel rushed. She kept on top of drink refills, which was also nice.

Food - We both had one of the skillets. I had the American Skillet which had potatoes, some veggies, and chunks of sausage, with two eggs on top. It was served with pancakes or toast. My friend had the Veggie Skillet. Both skillets were absolutely delicious, and seasoned just right. The pancakes were tasty too! It was a lot of food, and the price wasn&#39;t bad at all.

For a weekday, I was surprised at just how many people there! That must be a sign of good food, right?

Anyhow, I&#39;d say this is probably my new favorite breakfast place in the area."

I got a skillet and as far as value it was not.  The skillet was very shallow and half the potatoes were under cooked.  My wife got the stuffed french toast and the waitress talked here into getting cinnamon apples on top.....they came out with cinnamon peaches.  Which much to her dismay look very much like slightly burnt cinnamon apples.  They however do not taste like apples, they taste like a pile of terrible.   The pancakes were nothing special but the coffee kept flowing.  That is more indicative of the waitress than the restaurant, but i digress.

They have a variety of unique breakfast items that looked yummy, but after spotting another diner with an incredible-looking lox, cream cheese and bagel platter I was sold. The lox was super fresh and came with all sorts of things to build the perfect lox sandwich - cucumbers, feta cheese, olives, capers, etc. My husband just has a side of fresh fruit due to a bad experience at Red Lobster the night before, but that is another Yelp review completely...anyway, the fruit was fresh and when he wanted to bring it home the waiter brought a container marked with the contents and the date.

Breakfast with mah lady.

TIP TOP SERVICE!!!!

I have been to this joint a few times and have not been disappointed once. Every time I go I try something different. 

Carbcake eggs benny ...thry this if you like crabcakes it was delish.
Prosciutto Fresh mozzarella Crepes...These were tasty however they went a bit overboard with the Basil....easy up there chef/cook.

The coffee here IMO is bit better than most breakfast places. The OJ is AWESOME, way better than other chain-breakfast places that use the concentrated shtuff.

The place has a clean minimal feel to it, nothing distracting but the multi level dining room gives the place a feeling that the decorator and owner give a poop about personality."

There are a couple of other reliable places, but Jam n Jelly has a much more creative menu than most, which takes it up a notch.

The management and waitstaff are all polite and seem to do their jobs well.  During crowded weekend mornings, they give out numbers and keep people moving without being pushy or rude.  

Foods of note: the skillets are well done, the homemade jellies are delicious, the healthy scrambler is a great deal, and the varied french toasts are all good.  There is definitely a large amount of unhealthy breakfast items available, so you need to have some self-control.

Orange juice is good, but it could be colder, and the &#34;large&#34; size would be a &#34;small&#34; in any other parallel universe.  Perhaps there is a shortage I haven&#39;t heard about.

Decor is nice, inviting and comfortable.  I frequently hear the 80&#39;s station on the overhead speakers, which is an interesting and nice touch.

Prices are higher than your average breakfast place, but I think the quality is worth it.  Two skillets and two orders of orange juice was about $23, maybe $4-$5 more than I would expect at another place. (The OJ is particularly expensive, IMO.)   But in general, if you&#39;re not eating breakfast out every day, it&#39;s a great place for a nice weekend start."

I got the crunchy munchy french toast and he got the cafe skillet. Let me just say that we haven&#39;t been able to stop thinking about our breakfasts since we went! 

My french toast was the PERFECT amount of crunchy yet melt in your mouth. It is basically french toast coated in corn flakes and it is amazing. The cafe skillet included skirt steak, mushrooms, green pepper, egg, and other various things that I do not like but my boyfriend does. He LOVED this skillet and raved that it was one of the best he has ever had. 

After that breakfast, it is a good possibility that we will be back this weekend for the same exact thing!"

I love their sandwiches and dessert. Last time I tried Italian pesto sandwich and could totally taste the sundry tomato and mozzarella. My brother tried the turkey apple sandwich. Service was quick and very friendly. You can see everything happening in the kitchen. 
Apparently they over charged me for a little bit and the manager came by my table and explained it. He refunded the difference back to my card right away.

The high reviews had me excited for some yummy food.  But I was disappointed.  It was edible.  But honestly it wasn&#39;t anything worth three or four stars.  I got a bowl of Italian wedding soup and it was very bland. And I had ordered a grilled cheese sandwich.  Well...it&#39;s a panini style grilled and was so blah and dried out tasting.  I want my grilled cheese to be buttered and grilled crispy golden brown to perfection.  But it wasn&#39;t.  Then I got a rice krispy bar thinking maybe it&#39;s the deserts everyone is loving.   Well that bar was just plain gross.  I kept eating it trying to figure out what the heck they added to it.  I shared it with my husband who said it was nasty.  Can&#39;t explain with words.  So....not sure what&#39;s so great to give it such high marks.  Guess y&#39;all have to decide if it&#39;s worth the risk.  I know I won&#39;t be back.

Though I was visiting for work training, I just HAD to get here earlier to munch on something and check it out - especially after reading the Yelp reviews and checking out the photos. What a perfect little spot! 
From what I observed over the 3-4 hour span I was here, it seems like Blackberry Market is a Glen Ellyn gem. Teens, older adults, employees stopping in for lunch, children, students and Glen Ellyn residents of all kinds visited the establishment. Because it had been my first time, I&#39;m not positive if the awesome weather we had was a majority of the reason why this place had a 2-3 hour rush but it seems like they were well equipped with enough employees to satisfy everyone. 
The food here was even better than I had anticipated. I ordered a shaken raspberry green tea and the Blackberry Market salad with $2 grilled chicken added in (total came out to be $12.99). The salad not only tasted good, it was the cutest presentation I had ever seen! I appreciate that they they not only take pride in how the food tastes but also how it looks - it matters! There&#39;s definitely a reason why they put the desserts and bakery goods in the glass closest to the entrance...they look scrumptious. Before I had left I grabbed two cheesecake brownies and my goodness. They were delightful. 
The employees were friendly which is greatly appreciated considering how swamped they were during my visit. 

Things to take away from this review:
-Unless you&#39;re okay with background noise (i.e. children, music, conversations, etc.) this may not be the BEST place to get work done. Otherwise, there seemed to always be seating and it was a spacious area to do your thing.
-If you&#39;re looking for a small breakfast, light lunch or just a quick, refreshing drink all for a surprisingly low price, this is the place to go. 
-You&#39;ll most definitely buy a dessert before leaving."

They can make your breakfast sandwich as a &#34;stack&#34; instead of on bread.  

After seeing some Yelp reviews I paid special attention to look for the door to the patio.  OMG, it was so cute out there.  The hubs and I ate breakfast and watched a chipmunk run around in the ivy on the building.

Décor: A great word to describe this place is &#34;quaint.&#34; It is a sandwich / bakery place (think Panera, only WAY less commercialized) that serves sandwiches, salads, and sides. The menu is pretty simple and straight forward and they conveniently parade you past the fresh items display case was you wind your way up to the register. We were there in the heart of lunch time so it was busy. However, it worked out to our favor that all the inside tables (there are quite a few) were taken and we had to go &#34;out back.&#34; The back patio area is adorable! There are a bunch of small tables all situated under a cherry blossom tree (that was in full bloom when we were there). The tree provides shade as well as beauty and it is delightfully quiet back there. If you&#39;re there on a nice day I HIGHYLY recommend sitting out there!
Bathroom: pretty standard but also kept clean and tidy

Staff: Everyone was very nice and friendly.

Food: We all just had an assortment of sandwiches, both pre-made and &#34;custom&#34; (I had chicken salad, which was in the &#34;sides&#34; case but not technically on the menu), mixed sides (chips and greens), and water (free). Everything was nicely made and was pretty tasty - standard sandwiches.

Value: The prices are not too bad here for what you get. I wouldn&#39;t say the servings are &#34;huge&#34; but anyone with a normal size appetite will find they are not leaving hungry.

This is a nice little lunch spot that I&#39;d return to again in the future. I&#39;d probably check out other local spots but this would remain as a fall-back option."

The menu looked delightful but I wasn&#39;t hungry, so I settled on a cold brew with almond milk and it was delightful. I like cold brew to be so insanely strong and concentrated that even a splash of milk and some sugar doesn&#39;t take away from that delightfully bitter, caramelly flavor. This hit the spot. My friend had the steel cut oats and it smelled awesome, a huge serving of hot hot hot oatmeal topped with nuts, sugar, and other assorted oatmeal accoutrement. She loved it.

I&#39;ve been here twice and have not been disappointed. I was off both times and headed to Cantigny Gardens for a relaxing stroll. This was the perfect place to grab a cup of coffee, a delicious scone, and escape the hustle and bustle of life by cracking open a good book and digging in. 

They have a rustic, yet trending vibe going on. They have bright and warm colors paired together which really creates a calm and welcoming atmosphere. It is very easy to spend all day working on your computer, reading a book, or catching up with one of you friends. Their coffee is bold which I like. It is a great pick me up in the morning, plus they add coffee art of which I am a huge fan. Their scones are amazing. I tried their French vanilla then blueberry scones and both were great. If I had to choose my favorite I would go French vanilla, but you really can&#39;t go wrong. They were light and fluffy just like scones are supposed to be, but not too fluffy to where it has more of a cake consistency. It was the perfect texture.

I ordered the Marketplace Trio: Tuna salad, watermelon arugula salad and the Caesar kale salad with bacon.  All so good.  Although, I prefer my watermelon just the way it is naturally..nothing mixed with it.  I wasn&#39;t too fond of the watermelon arugula salad.

I like how they serve Intelligentsia brand coffee; this automatically bumps them up in my book.  However, the food quality and quantity leaves much to be desired. Blackberry Market offers your standard American cafe-bakery-fast casual fare, toeing very, very closely to Panera both in style and substance. One nice thing is that they offer a variety of premade side dishes which you can bundle into a meal.

All-in-all, it&#39;s an alright spot to get some sandwiches, standard soups or salads if you happen to be in the area. However, due to long waits and somewhat basic food, I would look elsewhere if you&#39;re not from here."

They&#39;re in a great location though parking can be a little tricky sometimes.

The not so good: The food is very hit or miss. Sometimes, it&#39;s very good, sometimes you order breakfast and they really skimp on the potatoes. Sometimes you order the shepherd&#39;s pie as a take home meal and it&#39;s delicious. Sometimes you order it and there&#39;s barely any meat in it. Sometimes you order breakfast at the counter to dine in and they lose your order. Twice. I&#39;m not sure who is running the show behind the counter but if you go on a Sunday it seems pretty close to chaos. Lines open and close on a whim and people are left standing there while they start to take your order and leave mid way through it to grab part of your order and the customer has to try to remember where they left off.

I found myself enjoying a day off, all by myself, and it was a sunny, gorgeous summer day. I was craving breakfast and I decided on heading over to Blackberry Market. 
I found parking a few blocks away and walked up to my destination. I noticed they had outdoor sidewalk seating and there were a few open tables. With it being so nice I wanted to sit outdoors, perfect! 
I walk in and was greeted right away. I looked over the menu and everything looked and sounded delicious. They have a variety of healthy food options and everything in the case looked delicious!!! I had my heart set on breakfast so I went with that. I ordered the farmhouse breakfast. Two eggs, 2 biscuits, bacon and a mix of sweet and regular potatoes. I ordered the hibiscus tea to quench my thirst. After ordering I asked if they would bring out my food to me if I sat outside and I found out that they do. I was asked if I wanted to sit out back in the patio. What??? A patio? Score!! I didn&#39;t have to sit out on the sidewalk and I still got to enjoy the outdoors, cool! 
So thru the back door I went and I was so impressed with the outdoor seating area. Very cozy, pretty, and there&#39;s a huge tree in the middle of the patio. Plenty of sunshine along with shady spots and very intimate, I was in love!
I waited about 8 minutes for my food. It was brought out to me and I immediately dug in. My over easy eggs were ok, nothing special, but the biscuits, sweet butter and the jam were to die for! I enjoyed my farmers breakfast very much. The potatoes were delicious and the bacon was thick and not greasy. I&#39;m not a bacon fan but I did eat the bacon, it was cooked perfectly. 
My only complaints are that my eggs could have used some seasoning, they were a little bland and there are no salt shakers at the tables outside. They only bring you your food and then they don&#39;t check on you again. That was ok except that I could have used some salt and I wasn&#39;t sure if I just left my plates there when I was done. So I left them there hoping that it was the right thing to do. 
I absolutely loved this place and will for sure go back to check them out for lunch. There was a tomato and avocado salad that caught my eye and I must try! 
If you are in the area this is a must try."

It can get quite busy during peak times and it&#39;s a little annoying to navigate so I prefer off times where it&#39;s less chaotic.  We hosted my sons baptism dinner here on a Saturday night and the restaurant was closed for our group.  Everyone raved at how delicious everything was and what a cool atmosphere we had for the celebration.  I was so happy with how it turned out.

The menu has a lot of variety and it was definitely hard to pick. It took me some time to figure out the &#34;market sides&#34; idea but that was okay since the line during summer lunch was actually long. You can tell it&#39;s definitely a local favorite and the patrons are an eclectic mix. Definitely has a hipster vibe but the crowd ranged from moms with their kids, elderly, and young adults studying (idk how they were since it was really loud at that time).

I went for the half sandwich and cup of soup combo. I ordered the caprese and their Italian wedding soup. My favorite part of the meal was the soup. The caprese was good but I&#39;ll admit I&#39;ve had better. Regardless, all of it tasted incredibly fresh and flavorful. I grabbed a blackberry bar from the dessert case (even more options!!) and an iced coffee to go. Both great. Service is excellent as the cashiers take the time to explain everything to you if you have questions, even with the long lines and while one cashier was being trained. 

I then came back a couple weeks later for coffee and then used the dollar off gelato through the Yelp check-in. Much more quieter experience during the late afternoon. And can&#39;t go wrong with Black Dog gelato! Yum! Will definitely be back yet again!"

This is not an IHOP so don&#39;t come here expecting that type of menu.

I usually get the the same thing when I come here so I can&#39;t vouch for all of their breakfasts.  The eggs over easy on biscuits with bacon and breakfast potatoes.  The potatoes are a combo of sweet potatoes and regular potatoes cut in triangles...very tasty.

Coffee is good as well.  They have a nice seating area insure and there is seating outside in the back on the patio...kind of hidden and that&#39;s ok by me."

Caprese sandwich is one of the best I&#39;ve had, their coffee is AMAZING if you&#39;re a coffee enthusiast . Cinnamon rolls are really good (but sometimes need to be heated more)

I mean c&#39;mon, the name &#34;Blackberry Market&#34;? I felt like I was going up the mountain to pick berries for grandma&#39;s pie. &#34;Be back before dusk!&#34;

Something that wasn&#39;t totally cute was the employee&#39;s attitudes though. As I stood and eyeballed their menu I felt a bit rushed by the cashiers. There was no one in line behind me but a sense of urgency was in the air. They also lacked warmth, which I found disappointing. Ignoring the need to speed, I continued to peruse their incredible looking dishes. Blackberry Kale Salad?! Yes please! I ended up purchasing a tea along with my meal. 

After ordering, the barista hands you the tea almost immediately and you are then free to sit down and wait for your food. The only problem is, the tea cup is not quite large enough. You end up sloshing your drink around and spilling all over yourself as you look for a table. Although at first I thought this was my own clumsiness, upon looking around I noticed a few others do the same. Not a large problem, but a definite annoyance.  

The food came quickly and indeed did taste quite fabulous, as did the slightly lower than full cup of tea. 

After eating, you clear your own dishes. This could have worked as a sort of &#34;Panera Bread&#34; idea, but there wasn&#39;t the convenience of multiple dish disposing areas. Again, not a large problem but another small factor that slightly lowered my overall experience. 

If you are in the area and want a healthy meal, Blackberry Market has the perfect food to nosh on. Just don&#39;t expect anything more than the experience you might have at your local Starbucks."

The food is good; it&#39;s fresh, delicious and most of all, relatively healthy (until you dig in to the gelato...).  The prices are fair for what you get.

The menu is mostly sandwiches and salads, along with pastries, gelato, and coffee.

When I saw &#34;Hipster Juice,&#34; I knew I was going to order it before I even looked at the ingredients.  Jasmine tea, orange juice, honey, and a pine tree sized sprig of rosemary.  It was good, it was different, but it wasn&#39;t THAT great.  I think next time I will stick to the Metropolis coffee instead.

What I ate here made me forget that my beverage was just A-OK.  I had the &#34;mix and match,&#34; and ordered a half ham &amp; brie sandwich, with the half blackberry salad.  I was comfortably full when I finished my meal.  The toasted pecans and the goat cheese were plentiful on my salad, although it definitely needed more blackberries.  My sandwich was made on some fresh homemade bread - you will want to take a loaf to go.

I debated whether or not to try the Black Dog gelato, which has a storefront in Ukie Village; when I saw the Yelp check-in for $1 off, I debated no more!  The Butterscotch Bourbon Pecan is a winner!  I also had a scoop of the Mexican Hot Chocolate, but the spice level is a bit too intense, unless you like being punched in the throat with cinnamon.

Along with the mellow, but funky alternative-industrial-dance humming softly in the cafe, there is lots and lots of seating.  The crowd was definitely younger, a lot of students goofing around and some more serious pupils sucking on the WiFi.

They close at 7 during the week, but even as we got up to leave, there were people still coming through the door.  Maybe they stay open a little bit later during the spring?"

I&#39;ve gotten their their mix and match, where I got the caprese sandwich and italian chopped salad. Along with my second time back almond croissant, their chai tea latte, and an english tea.

I have to say, there is probably nothing comparable to this place, in regards to the fact that it is a small business and more so that it just has great fresh ingredients and spectacular ambiance. 

I look forward to seeing this business thrive. I also look forward on trying everything on their menu, so I can really give a detailed description on their items!"

My one recommendation would be to take it easy on the goos -- a lot of sauce/icing/etc on the items they sell.

We stayed for lunch and I ordered the ham and brie sandwich with the broccoli side. I wasn&#39;t crazy about the chutney on the sandwich, but the broccoli was amazing. It had almonds in it and a nice, light dressing. We split some sweets like a cookie, brownie, and cinnamon roll. Cinnamon roll = yum. Definitely get one.

Alright, snap out of it self! Onward with the deets...

Ambiance: Adorable. Brick walls, lime green chairs, unique artwork, seating inside and out, the works. Great spot for chatting with friends, working on your lap top or grabbing a quick meal. 

Staff: Very friendly, helpful and genuinely seem like they enjoy their job which is always appreciated :)

Cost: Fair (maybe even a steal if you ask me!). My delicious breakfast was only $6...Six. Dollars. Enough said.

Food: I can only speak for breakfast and dessert, but both were phenom. I enjoyed the Farmers Breakfast which included homemade biscuits with eggs, bacon, country style potatoes and a side of jam. The biscuits and jam alone are enough to get me back through the door! Delish. That brownie though...woah. I&#39;ll be thinkin of that for a while. So chocolatey and sweet and moist - get one. Just. Get one.

Quick tip: Outdoor seating can get noisy being on Main Street, so if you&#39;re looking for a quiet spot, inside may be your best bet. However...during the day in the summer it was slightly kid central, but I&#39;m sure that&#39;ll calm down once school is back in sesh."

The food is good and the coffee (intelligentsia is great). 

Nevertheless, I&#39;m only rating this place 2 stars because of the following annoyances:
1. Their operating hours are subject to change- literally while you&#39;re sitting there. Adversely effecting weekends.

2. Their operating hours close too soon. Adversely effecting weekdays.

3. Weekend constraints on where you can sit if you plan to use your laptop (to work or study).

4. Internet is unreliable. Sometimes it works. Often it is too congested or is intentionally turned off.

Other than the few issues above, the place is good. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of options for good coffee in the suburbs."

It seems like when it&#39;s busy, my eggs are overcooked, my latte is cold, and it takes forever to get service (One time I actually waited 20 minutes for an americano. What was I thinking?). Due to this, I would say half the times I&#39;ve visited Blackberry Market I have had a 4-star experience. Unfortunately, the other half of the times, it&#39;s been about a 1-or-2-star experience at best.

I&#39;ve tried many different great breakfast and lunch options here: the farmhouse breakfast, the veggie breakfast sandwich, cinnamon rolls, cookies, blackberry oatmeal, italian wedding soup, the list goes on... 

Half the time these are great. But once in a while when I stop in and it&#39;s a bit busy, my farmhouse breakfast will include: cold bacon and cold potatoes with 2 overcooked eggs. A dry, cold breakfast. Really disappointing. The same morning I ordered this, I got a pumpkin spice latte with it. The latte was delivered first in a large mug with latte art (nice touch), but the latte art makes no difference if I receive my fresh latte and it&#39;s legit COLD. To say the least, that poor breakfast really didn&#39;t start my day off well.

But other times when I visit and my latte is hot and the cinnamon rolls are fresh, it&#39;s awesome.

I can&#39;t help but notice each and every time I visit how confusing the &#34;behind-the-counter&#34; people look. Especially with the espresso: writing it down on a post it and putting it on the espresso bar for the 1 person working there to make the drink, then find the person it goes to...whether they&#39;re at the counter or he needs to deliver it -- they could really benefit from a 2nd person being an espresso bar runner. Not to say I&#39;m an expert, but I did work as a barista at a popular chain coffee shop to remain unnamed ;) and this would be unacceptable there.

This review is hard to write as I really do enjoy being in Blackberry Market and I think the style, atmosphere, branding, and collateral of the place is all wonderful. But the inconsistency is so frustrating, especially when there&#39;s a Starbucks right down the street..."

Somehow, we&#39;ve only recently discovered their patio, which is a magical oasis that I kind of do not want to mention here because I want there to always be a table available for me.

All the foods I&#39;ve eaten are pretty delicious. Blackberry oatmeal. Ham and egg croissant. Beef brisket. All kinds of side salads and breakfast sandwiches. I will say, the breakfast platter that includes eggs, biscuits and bacon is a bit lacking in flavor. And for a big eater, some of the portions can be on the small side.

They pay great attention to the quality of their (Intelligensia) coffee drinks. It seems like the employees are well trained in the art of iced coffee and espresso making, and that makes me happy. 

I&#39;m not sure about the efficiency of their ordering system. They have just one person taking orders, even at peak meal times, and the line can become quite long. It&#39;s worth the wait though!"

Blackberry Market... this place has it all. 

And I have to thank Laura N (as many others have before) for opening my eyes to Blackberry Market. It was the perfect place for a lite earlybird dinner for my boo and I this evening. 

They close at 7pm at the very latest, so eating here is a great pre-game activity for your evening. We arrived at about 6:15 due to having an extremely difficult time finding parking in the area on a Friday. We actually ended up parking 6 blocks away and walking over because that was the nearest we could find a spot amongst all the madness. Luckily, it&#39;s just 2 blocks from the Metra stop, so if you can make that your mode of transportation, that&#39;s what I&#39;d recommend doing. 

Upon walking in I was immediately impressed with the bit of local goods available for purchase, including beer from Two Brothers Brewing Company in Warrenville and Solemn Oath Brewing in Naperville, as well as various Etsy shop items, specialty food items. 

Upon ordering I was admittedly a bit let down, as they couldn&#39;t make our first sandwhich choice because they don&#39;t do fried eggs in the evening (only breakfast) and they didn&#39;t have enough of the kale salad I ordered to do a full order, but the guy at the counter offered to just charge for a half salad and I could have the last of the batch... which actually turned out to be quite a bit. The dressing (Caesar) was phenomenal. It was lighter, fresher, and smoother than any Caesar dressing I&#39;ve had before. 

I also had a few bites of my boo&#39;s smoked gouda and grilled onion sandwich which outstanding... and I&#39;m normally not a fan of grilled onions. I probably would have downed the whole thing if he had turned away from it. 

They offered a variety of beverage options including bottles craft beer, artisan sodas, and a full cafe serving coffee, tea, etc, but once I saw that they carried Bruce Cost Ginger Ales, I snatched up a bottle of the passion fruit ginger ale (which I haven&#39;t seen anywhere else) and happily took a seat at one of the small cafe tables. 

In addition to their cafe/market menu, they have a small but grand in quality selection of baked goods. We got a Market Bar, which is similar, but better than, a 7-layer coconut bar, and also a Blackberry Brownie, which may have been the very best brownie I&#39;ve EVER had. Light with hints of blackberry jam swirled in... too perfect for words. 

To round things out, I have to give another shout-out to my new Dill Pickle lip balm. It had the hefty price-tag of $4.50, but as soon as I uncapped it I knew it was I that was getting the deal. I only regret not getting the one other tube that they had for sale, because I feel like this is something I won&#39;t be able to go on without. Hooked."

I had some time to kill, and I&#39;d seen Laura&#39;s check-ins and pictures so many times here, I had bookmarked it, and today was the day. I walked in and was greeted by several friendly staff members. Everyone was smiling; they obviously like their jobs or fake it extremely well. Looking around, I could see the allure: the tin ceilings, the bright green chairs, the wood flooring and other wood elements, the spaciousness that allows you to find a little nook and settle in. It also has a nice energy, kind of buzzing but not frenetic. Just a nice vibe.

I knew I wanted a latte for here and maybe some take home items from the deli, so I approached the counter to begin my barrage of questions. The clerk was very helpful in answering my ingredient inquisition and offered samples. Once I tasted the southwest quinoa salad, I was sold. I&#39;m finally ready to embrace quinoa, and I was hopeful even my husband would go for that. So I ordered 3 sides for $8, the others being a smoky sweet potato salad and an egg salad with salmon. That bacon cheddar soufflé looked yummy too, so I&#39;ll have that with my latte, I told the clerk. Oh, and coconut curry lentil soup of the day? Oh yeah!

I found a nice little 2-seater spot against the wall in the first dining area (theres a second area) where I could enjoy my latte with a book, people-watch and take it all in. 

THIS LATTE- outstanding! Maybe I just like honey more than I realized, but this honey latte with skim was delicious, perfect and served in a clear glass teacup that allowed me to visually enjoy it too. No joke, it was so pretty. :) I&#39;ve had honey lattes elsewhere, and in my experience, they don&#39;t usually measure up to this one (or to Hansa&#39;s in Libertyville).

The bacon cheddar soufflé, which I&#39;d actually consider more of a popover, was outstanding.  After one taste, I bought 3 more to take home as well. It reminded me of my mom&#39;s Yorkshire pudding and I&#39;m a sucker for that. After I made that purchase, as I was about to leave, a lovely manager came over and told me I&#39;d been overcharged and refunded me. I had no idea. Next level service! :-)

With the exception of the sweet potato salad, my husband enjoyed everything I brought home, so that&#39;s a big healthy win for us. Well, at least the quinoa salad was healthy and that was the goal. For the record, I liked the sweet potato salad but I&#39;ve only ever seen a scrunched up face like my husband made once, and that was mine after trying Vegemite for the first time. So funny- he really didn&#39;t like that salad, but such drama! Haha And the coconut curry lentil soup is perfection.

 Blackberry Market is awesome and I am excited to visit again. I wish I lived closer, but that just means my future purchases will be larger to last for the week. Great find, Laura, thanks again. :D And that honey latte; I&#39;m telling you, on the way to my car, with my leftover latte in hand, I seriously almost turned around to take a second one with me. I really should have as I&#39;ve been thinking of it ever since."

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s actually healthy, but everything seems fresh and very tasty. I&#39;ve had both of their grilled cheeses and a few of their sides. They also have great cappuccino.

We loved the variety of side dishes and salads. My wife and I split a turkey sandwich which was delicious, but we especially liked the three side-dish plate. We tried the chicken salad, the quinoa salad and spicy Asian salad. All three were delicious. We look forward to returning to try other items on the menu including the cinnamon rolls which looked outstanding!"

Prices were very good.  Had the steel cut oatmeal, which was very good, and the broccoli cheese soup, also good and very tasty. I would recommend this place whenever you&#39;re in the area and want a general store type feel and good food at great prices.  I would have given this five stars, but they didn&#39;t have what I was hoping to get, because it wasn&#39;t there that day, and I wasn&#39;t aware they changed up the offerings on a daily basis."

I would give it 2.5 stars, but it&#39;s not an option. I know it&#39;s a local place, but I just wasn&#39;t super impressed. 

I got the pick 2 and chose the Turkey, Gouda and Apple sandwich. It came with a cranberry spread and it was ok, I just felt like it was really dry and lacking some flavor. I also got the soup of the day, which was a spicy corn chowder. It was very good and pretty spicy, but too many other veggies in it. My friend got the same food as me and seemed to like it. My mom got a sandwich, I don&#39;t remember which kind, and the Italian Wedding Soup and I know she liked the soup a lot.

One thing I really didn&#39;t like is that they don&#39;t have fountain soda; we had to get our cans of coke from the fridge. Not a fan of that. 

Some of the tables needed to be cleaned off as well. They were pretty busy for lunch, but that&#39;s one of my pet peeves. If I am back in the area, I think I would try somewhere new."

If you get to have a fresh batch, it&#39;s really good and it is the most authentic you can get at a restaurant. I went there for breakfast and got the Ham &amp; Cheese Croissant with a latte. It was a very good sandwich, though a bit small, fulfilled my apatite. The bf got Farmhouse Breakfast which was very good as well (potatoes were a mix of sweet and regular potatoes, a bit different than I&#39;m used to).

This place has everything you want: cute; trendy decor; fantastic coffees, teas, and other treats; and two store fronts for ample seating. Look up the menu before you go though, otherwise you may feel a bit rushed to make your decision at the register. There was one vegan option for sweets: a phenomenal cookie, indeed, though. And there were about two or three gluten free dessert options. On the market side, there were quite a few of both, mostly in the form of side dishes."

I&#39;m that rare, weird person that wakes up two hours before work to relax and prepare for my day. I light candles, make (and eat) breakfast, drink tea/coffee, prepare a lunch for later, do some reading, journal a bit, maybe write a review, and do some light morning yoga. Then I go to work. It makes my day feel so much better if it&#39;s not a routine of wake up and go to work. On nice-weather days, I&#39;ll even head over to a forest preserve for a leisurely walk.

If I don&#39;t feel like making breakfast at home (or run out of food), I&#39;ll use the time to find a new place on my route to work that isn&#39;t Starbucks (although I do love my &#39;bucks). In fact, I really love finding new morning places -- especially cute places open at 7am. Blackberry Market appeared on my radar a couple months ago and I finally visited recently.

I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t stop here sooner! This place is amazing.

If I had a larger disposable income, I&#39;d come here almost every morning for breakfast.

Walking in, you&#39;ll see a little shop area for artisan jams, bags of Intelligentsia coffee, packaged gluten-free treats, local beer, and other little kitchen essentials. Beyond that is a long counter with scrumptious baked goodies displayed behind the glass and smiling employees creating culinary delights. The interior has gorgeous floors, brick walls, tin ceiling tiles, lime green chairs, and fun photographs. There&#39;s even a large dining area attached to the front cafe. All of this, wrapped up together, makes for a very cozy and inviting cafe.

I stared at the beautiful menu (quinoa salads, lovely sandwiches, baked treats, coffees, teas, etc.) for a few minutes before deciding to order a pumpkin spice latte and a veggie breakfast sandwich. My latte was made right away. It was better than I had expected. Soooo good. A few moments later, my sandwich was ready and it was placed in a large brown paper bag (I ordered it to go). I was a bit confused why one little breakfast sandwich needed such a big bag. I looked inside the bag and saw one HUGE breakfast sandwich! With a side of potatoes! Very unexpected.

The sandwich and potatoes were eaten once I got to work. They were delicious and so filling! I actually ended up eating only half of my sandwich for breakfast and finishing the other half for lunch. At this point, it was probably a good thing I didn&#39;t order a brownie or something because I wouldn&#39;t have had any room for it in my [tiny] stomach! Mmmm.

Blackberry Market, you&#39;ve won me over. I can&#39;t wait to eat with you again."

So many to choose from the wonderful thing is you don&#39;t have to choose just one. The &#34;Market Side Trio&#34;allows you to pick three of your FAVS!!!
Today I opted for a full salad, the Blackberry Market Salad w/ grilled chicken didn&#39;t disappoint!
My friend decided to have Gelato after lunch. It looked amazing, she said it transported her to Italy!!!!

Super cute restaurant with quaint grocer/market offering upscale jams, nut butters, etc.
Ample seating area.
Delicious and CHEAP (nothing over $6.00!) breakfast.
Delicious bakery items including cream cheese brownies, chocolate chip cookies, cinnamon rolls, magic bars, etc.
Clean.
Seemingly seasonal menu.
Many gluten-free options.

Now, the cons:
There were as many friendly employees as there were unfriendly.
The lines to order food take forever.
They served the cinnamon roll cold. Who serves a cinnamon roll with a glop of frosting, cold?
The chocolate cupcake was hands-down one of the worst cupcakes I have ever tasted. The frosting was good but the cake, terrible! It was simultaneously dry and bitter! Gross.

We were a party of four plus one toddler at 9:30am on Saturday, December 27. There was some lines to get through to order but that was fine. The cashier was quick to point out that coffee refills are 50 cents even though I did not ask. They also ran out of mugs and served us our coffee in paper cups. We ordered three farmhouse breakfasts, a veggie breakfast sandwich, a side order of fruit salad, a chocolate chip cookie, a cinnamon roll, a magic bar, and a chocolate cupcake. My veggie breakfast sandwich was AMAZING. So delicious. I am craving it right now. My companion&#39;s stated that the farmhouse breakfasts were good but the biscuits were a bit heavy. All the breakfasts came with a side of perfectly roasted combination sweet and regular potatoes. The sweets were good with the exception of being served of a cold cinnamon roll and that terrible chocolate cupcake. 

I think if they fix their horrible cake recipe, serve the cinnamon roll warm, remind their employees (including management) to be a bit nicer, and somehow expedite the ordering process this would be a no nonsense five star experience!

To the Yelpers crying about the lunch prices, you guys are crazy. The dollar menu at McDonald&#39;s should not be the bar to which you compare your dining experiences!"

I was introduce to Blackberry Market by one of my closest friends. The location is just at the corner of main street but you would almost miss it if you are not looking. It has a nice outside sitting area on the sidewalk, the sitting area inside is very spacious and large. Just recently I have discovered the patio which is in the back ( you can access it thru the main lobby). The patio is great for enjoying a nice solo lunch or a glass of wine with friends. The kitchen area is visible to all and reassures you of the cleanliness and freshness of the food. I would also like to point out that within the store there is a little shop where you can purchase coffee or cute little kitchen items. Its great!

The staff is very friendly and welcoming to newbies. If you ask them what they recommend they always helpful and willing to give you a sample before you order. 

The food is just always tasty and fresh. You can see them making the food such as the sandwiches and salads right in front of you. The menu has a wide variety of options for people with dietary restrictions, such a vegan and vegetarian. You always feel welcome regardless of your dietary choice. I have had their breakfast vegetarian sandwich and is so delicious and big for the price ($6 only). I often get it for breakfast and have left overs for lunch. I have also gone for dinner and often get the pick two the portion size of the salad, soup or sandwich is great feels you up and satisfies your hunger. I have recently gotten the gelato which is also great just like everything else in the menu. 

Just a tip: if you do go for breakfast try to give yourself enough time for parking, being that you are in the middle of a busy street parking can be very limited. Also give yourself enough time to order and receive your food, since the food is freshly made it take a couple of minutes to prepare and there might be a long line during the morning."

I love the mix &amp; match options. I usually go with the caprese panini and the BlackBerry market salad, which is one of the most deliciously sweet and tasty salads I&#39;ve ever had.  Also they have Intelligentsia coffee here so this is a great place to get your caffeine fix.

Everyone working here is especially nice, the service is prompt and the atmosphere is refreshingly ambient. I have grown fond of this place. 

P.S. Don&#39;t forget to try the baked goods. The cinnamon rolls, frosted cookies, or brownies will cure any sweet tooth."

However, on the second visit my party came at 4:45 on a Sunday. Apparently they close at 5, but instead of just telling us we&#39;d have to take our food to go, they banged chairs and mopped bitterly while we ate.

That said, I like this location because they don&#39;t scrimp. Some other locations barely fill the bottom of your bowl with rice. I haven&#39;t had that problem here. 

When the weather is nice you can take your burrito for a walk and sit by the river or one of the fountains. You can eat in too of course, but it&#39;s loud and this location is usually full of college students (or St. Peter &amp; Paul kids after school), so my way is the highway.

I stopped in the other night before a Yelp event to grab and snack and ordered a chicken quesadilla. The gentleman that handled the proteins generously filled my tortilla with chicken. Sadly, most of the chicken was dark meat---YUCKA!

Then the gentleman that was handling the cheese part literally sprinkled on some cheese. &#34;SPRINKLED&#39; is the best word I can use to explain the lack of cheese that he put. I asked him to put some more and a pinch of cheese later, I had a giant chicken taco with cheese. Very difficult to eat because the cheese is what holds a quesadilla together.

Here&#39;s the problem I see. Chipotles are so inconsistent, its not even funny. It&#39;s crazy that that charged me $6.09 for a tortilla with some chicken in it.

Now, here&#39;s where I have to own that I did not address it with the manager at the time. I don&#39;t typically eat alone in restaurants. It makes me uncomfortable and I generally hate it but on this particular evening, I was forced to eat alone. For this reason and this reason only, I did not walk up to the counter and explain my crazy amounts of disappointment. Had my husband or a friend been with me, I totally would have talked with the manager right then and there but I didn&#39;t because of my un-comfortableness.

I&#39;m quite disappointed. It&#39;s clear to me that I need to stick to the Chipotle by our home. That is the only one that knows what they are doing and that is why, no matter what day it is, they are always packed. Because they know the right way to do things.

Wish this one is closer to where I live. I loved fresh Dosa and Idilis which made from the rice and tasted fantastic when made fresh. 

A tiny take out place where the young cashiers speak pefect English but need to turn their heads to ask grandpa or grandma for any food questions. The first time, I only ate one plain Dosa and took Uthapam home. The Dosa was excellent: huge and crispy with the right chutney. The Uthappam was just OK when we ate at home. So when I took my son to this place second time, we only order the plain Dosa and an sweet pancake and ate those right there. He finished most of those so that says something. 

I loved both of them. The only thing is I forgot my coffee but they don&#39;t have the masala tea! Wish they could have some hot drinks with the tasty Dosa.

They charged heftily for this poor service. 

The food that was delivered, tasted good. 

Still, I&#39;m not sure that the food is worth the stress of dealing with them.

There are more reliable and professional options."

We had to go since that was all he wanted while all I wanted was Lou Malnati&#39;s. We are not ones that love picking up sandwiches from places. Ideally we can make it at home, and that&#39;s why we never order them.

Potbelly is an exception. The toasted bread and all of the fixings make this sandwich the best. There are not as many sandwich options as I remembered and that&#39;s why I gave it 4 stars, but this is definitely a good sandwich, and we wish we had locations in Florida."

Their regular sandwiches seem slightly smaller than those at Jersey Mike&#39;s and other sub shops.  And the price is right.  For $4.50, I can get a regular size sandwich that is filling, not greasy, and extra toppings at no added charge.  The &#34;big&#34; claims to be 30% more and is only $1 more.  But even when I&#39;m a hungry monster, I don&#39;t upsize here.

My usual MO at Potbelly&#39;s is to grab a roast beef and provolone on wheat, a Pellegrino, and scram.  But today I wanted a little kick, so I got the roast beef with mustard, hot peppers and tomato.  My sandwich choices aren&#39;t so plain Jane anymore!  I really like that they use brown mustard instead of yellow.  The hot peppers are indeed, hot.  The bread is a little crusty on the outside, but it isn&#39;t hard or offputting.  I really like Potbelly&#39;s sandwiches.

The service is good.  Friendly (or at least appearing content) employees and accurate ordering are all I ask for in a quick stop like this one.

I&#39;ve always encountered a line here, and it gets worse at noon.  The parking lot can get congested during the lunch hour, but it was easier to get in and out of here around 11:30 than 12:30, so go early or go elsewhere."

I have either the regular vegetarian sandwich (mushroom and cheese), or the pizza sandwich (mushroom, cheese, tomato sauce).  They toast your sandwich, then they have a station where they add your choice of toppings.  They have great hot peppers which really spice up the veggie sandwich.

The vegetarian soup (tomato base) is a winner as well.

This would be a five-star review if the soup was more reasonably priced and/or they would not have dropped the original veggie salad off of the menu.  That amazing salad had artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, and chickpeas as the star ingredients.

My sister just had a baby so the least I can do is bring dinner... but what&#39;s on the way to CDH from O&#39;Hare?  I thought and thought and decided sandwiches would be the easiest solution to feed a handful of people and still not require much in the way of plates or silverware.

I rushed into Potbelly&#39;s to grab various sandwiches to take with me to the hospital.  Personally, I can&#39;t visit Potbelly&#39;s without a PB&amp;J sandwich, it&#39;s odd I know but they just taste better from Potbelly&#39;s.  My mom had the wreck which she truly enjoyed and there were a sampling of various other sandwiches like the Chicken Cheese, and the Italian which made good impressions on all.  Their cookies are always a hit and both sugar and oatmeal choc. chip were eaten to the point of gluttony.  The cookies are always baked perfectly with a crisp exterior and a softer center... I&#39;m nearly drooling just thinking about their buttery goodness.

The service was fast and the man helping with my order was very friendly and thorough with my order.

 Well I called, they told me that they don&#39;t deliver, and referred to me to another Potbelly&#39;s. So I called the other and they said the same thing. Tension was mounting, so I called this Potbelly&#39;s back and said they said they don&#39;t deliver.

I called the restaurant thinking it was maybe a mistake - nope they said that is how they make it. Ok, just won&#39;t order that again.

Vegetable Egg Roll: tasted chalky. Enough said

General Tso Chicken with chicken fried rice - just not good at all.

Every time we think the food is fine.  We usually get a beef or chicken entree.  I think they use too much breaking and not enough meat in the fried chicken dishes.  I love the beef gravy most of the time.
On a few occasions I ordered shrimp.  I prefer unbranded.  I think they cut the shrimp in half for the fried ones to conserve how much meat they need to use.  The shrimp with garlic sauce is much better bang for your buck.
We also get fried rice.  I think the combo is very good.

Delivery was the length quoted. The egg roll was stuffed with filling and delicious.  

The crab rangoon. Disgusting.  The wonton wrapper is soft and chewy. It&#39;s not crisp. Probably one of the worst I&#39;ve ever had.

After my doctor appointment, I needed to destress &amp; feast. I came here on the coldest day of the year. Assuming the delivery would take longer, &amp; many people would have the genius idea to stay indoors, all warm &amp; cuddly to just have their food delivered. I decided to go in &amp; order my food at their store. Good thing I did, I avoided an hour &amp; half long delivery wait! When I was there, The phone kept ringing with new orders to fill. With only 1 driver (they are looking to hire another driver anyone that&#39;s interested) it may take some time to get people&#39;s food delivered. 

The owner is incredibly nice,  the first time I went here she gave me a free bottle of water &amp; hot sauce&#39;s (.30 cents)
Small family owned local business, that has been in the area for many years.  I love this place, the customer service here is speculator!!!  The 2nd time I came her, she gave me a free egg roll! This is my favorite place to get Asian cuisine in Naperville. I especially love all the vegetarian options they have!! My 2 favorite items are the vegetable chow Funn, &amp; the eggplant with garlic sauce ."

Honestly, this tasted like white people made it. No flavor, the egg rolls were burnt,  and the sweet and sour sauce tastes like nothing at all. The sweet and sour chicken came with raw peppers, raw carrots and raw pineapple mixed in the box and there were more of those things than actual chicken. So weird! No thanks."

Went out and didn&#39;t see him, called the restaurant and they told us what car to look for, turns out he was parked in front of a different building. The shouty driver tried arguing about us not answering when he was the one showing up too early at the wrong door.

The spring rolls tasted like hot grease, and the tofu didn&#39;t have a taste and was very rubbery. We included the coupon for a free order of 4-piece crab rangoon but did not receive that item; however upon reading other reviews this was likely a stroke of good luck.

We will never eat here again."

I settled on some Hot &amp; Sour soup, General Tso&#39;s Beef (with steamed rice), and a small Chicken Fried Rice. 

I placed my order a few minutes shy of 5 p.m. through GrubHub and was given an estimated delivery time of 6:00 - 6:10 p.m. The delivery driver showed up at about 6:00 p.m on the dot; however, the poor guy got lost and I had to give verbal directions until he got here. He was very nice; too bad he works for a place with incompetant cooks.

Hot &amp; Sour soup - Plenty of spice, great flavor, but..... why does it have shrimp in it!?!? I HATE shrimp. Hate, hate, hate them! Nowhere on the menu on GrubHub does it state the H &amp; S soup has shrimp. Also, there&#39;s pieces of chicken in it. Hmmm.

General Tso&#39;s Beef - It smelled devine, but that was the only good part about it.  I seriously feel like they pulled a frozen block of it out of the freezer, nuked it for 90 seconds (if that), put it in a tray with three pieces of broccoli and called it good. I tried to scoop some onto my plate and the entire block  came out! After separating a piece to try, I was correct on my assumption. The meat wasn&#39;t warm at all. Even after I microwaved it for 2 minutes, I wasn&#39;t impressed with my second piece I tried and gave up on the dish entirely. I wouldn&#39;t feed this to my worst enemy&#39;s dog.

Chicken fried rice - nothing like what I was expecting. Kind of warm, kind of not with huge chicken chunks. I didn&#39;t bother tasting the chicken; it looked disgusting. After throwing some hot mustard on there, I managed to get through most of it (seeing as how my main dish wasn&#39;t edible, I needed something) but my disappointment was mounting.

I will say the steamed rice was good. But then again, if you mess up steamed rice,  you have some serious issues. 

Oh, and the best part? My fortune, which read &#34;Ability is not something to be shown off.&#34; Ohhhhh the irony! 

King&#39;s Wok.... please take me back. I won&#39;t stray again."

1) The lunch-version of the Szechuan Tofu clearly states that it comes with white rice (on the menu). I open it up, and the rice is brown. Had I known that, I wouldn&#39;t have ordered an additional vegetable fried rice. 

2) The almond cookies are ridiculously stale. I was so disappointed because I love the ones from Chi Tung and don&#39;t know too many restaurants that sell them. 

3) The fortune cookies are stale. This confused me altogether. With fortune cookies being a staple in American Chinese food, why in the world would you even have the opportunity to have stale fortune cookies? 

Pros: 

1) I loved the Szuechuan Tofu. Delicious! I wish there was more of it instead of so many vegetables, but I understand why. A serving of tofu is exactly what they gave me. I&#39;ll know for future reference to pay extra for two servings. 

2) The vegetable fried rice was decent. I prefer Thai fried rice over Chinese fried rice, but every blue moon I run across a version that makes me think it&#39;s OK. I wasn&#39;t falling all over the place about it, but it was better than many others I&#39;ve tried. 

3) The delivery guy was pleasant. I tip ahead of time on GrubHub so I never really know who I&#39;ll run into, but so far I have never had one bad/rude/mean/unprofessional delivery guy when ordering through GrubHub. 

4) I used to hate egg rolls, but they&#39;re growing on me. I liked theirs. 

Would I recommend this place? Yes. I wouldn&#39;t do it if you&#39;re on crunch time because it&#39;s about an hour wait for delivery. And definitely don&#39;t do it if you have a sweet tooth. But for vegetarians, this is a pretty good option as neighborhood places go. Are there better locations? Absolutely! But since I liked their Szechuan tofu so much, I&#39;m on their side and won&#39;t plug other places in place of them."

At 5:45 I placed an order on Grub Hub asking for their 3 dish combo which came with a large fried rice 2 egg rolls and 2 crab ragoons. I simply asked for no vegetables in the dishes and to make them extra spicy.

At 6:20 I received a call from restaurant. they wanted to know if I didn&#39;t want vegetables in anything including the fried rice.....stupid question. I said just they main dishes, and there was a nonsense back and forth for 5 minutes. 

At 7:15 I had to call to see if my food was on the way. They said yes the driver has already left and was on the way. (we live 5 minutes up the road)

At 7:30 I called again...enraged now...I let them know that I have been patiently waiting for 2 hours now food. The woman on the phone said it was because they didn&#39;t understand my vegetable request that they couldn&#39;t cook it right away, and she tried calling me and I didn&#39;t answer. I said that phone call was over an hour ago (the one I missed was 2 minutes before the one i answered) I said you didn&#39;t even call me until almost 45 minutes after I placed the order. She kept telling me its because they couldn&#39;t understand my order. I told her that we got that problem corrected over an hour ago, and that it shouldn&#39;t have taken this long to make the food, if the original time was only 45 minutes til delivery,

I made sure they knew that I did not feel as though i should have to pay for an order that has taken 2 hours to get to me. She insisted to telling me that it was because of MY ERROR, not their own. I told her that I could have chosen to order from at least 6 other Chinese restaurants in the area, and that for now on I will be doing so, and they will never have my business again. I asked if the driver was making multiple deliveries before my stop, and she said she told him to stop here first. I said fine, and hung up.

At 7:45 our food FINALLY arrived. No words exchanged with the driver. No apologies given. Nothing. After setting out our food, it was at lease correct. It was also cold. ALL OF IT! I had to microwave the food I just spent almost $60 on! And that extra spicy I asked for, it wasn&#39;t even spicy like they should have been. General Tsao&#39;s chicken, soggy. Mongolian Beef, cold and flavorless. Szechwan Chicken, cold, bland and mild. Fried Rice, cold. Crab Ragoons, just cream cheese and cold. Egg Rolls, gross, oily, and oh yeah cold.

I should have taken all that food back and thrown it in their face, but If we wanted to leave the house we would have, 2 HOURS AGO!"

This restaurant gives the best bang for your buck out of all the Chinese food joints in the area. I come here frequently during lunch to order the lunch special, which includes an entree, a choice of crab rangoon or egg roll, a fortune cookie, and a free drink. What really hooks me is the portion size for the main meal. The entree is normally loaded up with fried rice and whatever you ordered, and I often leave the restaurant feeling like I&#39;m about to explode. It is SUCH a great deal.

The manager is a really nice guy; he cares about his customers and often checks up on us while we are eating if the restaurant is not too busy. 

They also offer a rewards card that basically allows you to have a buy ten get one free deal. I&#39;ve went through four of these rewards cards already since I first got hooked on China Station in September. Great Cantonese restaurant. Mm ghoy."

I&#39;ve been to and enjoyed Joy Yee several times (Naperville &amp; Chinatown), but haven&#39;t been inside or ordered from a stand alone mom&amp;pop Chinese place in years.

There&#39;s plenty to choose from the menu, and looks like they have decent lunch specials.  I ordered the Singapore Noodle dish, extra spicy and it was very good.  Chicken, shrimp, pork, very thin rice noodles.  

I ordered for dine-in and the food came in a resealable dish, which made it easy to close the leftovers and take back with me.

The dining area is small, then again the store front is small.  I&#39;d suggest ordering over the phone or online and taking back with you (that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do next time - and there will be a next time).

How hard is it to just give me a little of both? I&#39;m not asking for two full servings?! In my opinion their dinner menu is very pricey compared to what you can get at Panda for the same cost. Their one entree combo costs a little more than Pandas two entree combo WITH my half and half chow mein and rice. But their food is good. Not great. Just good enough to not ruin my whole night. Pretty spicey. Even their orange chicken was spicey but their egg rolls suck. Very greasy and just gross. The filling had pieces of left over BBQ red pork in it. Yuck.

There are times when I have ordered and picked up food from there and it does not take long and tastes great, mind you its at prime lunch hours as well 11:30 - 12:30. Then there are times when I order ahead of time and I&#39;m told 15 mins and I come to pick it up and it ends up being 30. It may not seem like a big deal but when your lunch break is only 30 mins it is a big deal. Also the the food is not as good. It seems like they are very understaffed, there is only one person to answer the phones and take walk in orders. The employee seemed lost, he did not greet customers as they walked in, he kept answering the phone and taking orders making customers wait as the line grows. 

I recently decided to take a gamble and use the delivery service that China Station offers, big mistake... I ordered at around 10:30 -10:45. I had special instructions on how I would like my food prepared since there was a section for it. The food did not arrive till 11:45. The place being delivered to was not more than 10 mins away catching 3 stop lights.  The special instructions were not followed; extra spicy and less sauce. The spicy part is mildly understandable since its relative. But the sauce part not so much, I got my meal and it was drowning in sauce. The meat was no longer crispy due to the whole thing being submerged in sauce. 

This is a relatively new place and for service to be so terrible so early is disappointing."
