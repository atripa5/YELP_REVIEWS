I was a little hesitant, because setting up an event seemed to be a bit hard with actually getting a hold of someone. I am glad we were persistent though. 

The brunch buffet for our event was amazing &amp; delicious, lots of options, which I love! Our waiter was fantastic, give him props for dealing with 20 people pretty much by himself, they were very accommodating, and the price was just right! I can&#39;t say enough great things! 

Will definitely recommend! Thanks river view diner!"

I should say we have only been there one time for this meal, but the service was good, the quality was good, and the quantity was more than adequate. I found it to be a very enjoyable meal. 

However my previous reviews on the other menu items, remain as stated.
I think the menu is 5 times larger than it should be, and I think that the owner would do better training his cooks to prepare a few meals well, rather than to assemble many, many Items poorly.

On another note, he has recently added a very large, a very bright; almost blinding, sign that when traveling past it at night, is annoying and almost dangerous.

I think that the owner would have done far better to use that money on hiring a consultant to downsize &amp; improve his menu."

The new building is really nice and very comfortable and clean. Even though they were slammed for Sunday brunch, we were quickly seated. The bussers were fast and attentive, presenting us with cups of coffee and water immediately and keeping both topped off. Our server came and took our order quickly, but we never saw her again until she dropped off the check. If it weren&#39;t for the bussers, we would have been parched through our meal.

The food was better than average, but nothing particularly special. My wife and I agreed that we have had better pancakes, although these were good. The portions were sizable, but they should have been, since our bill was $29 for my wife&#39;s pancakes, bacon, and juice and my eggs, bacon, hash browns and coffee. 

Not a bad experience, but with all the other choices out there, the folks here might consider stepping up their game a bit, at least in the wait-staff department. I&#39;d eat here again, but it definitely isn&#39;t my first choice."

Friday&#39;s a fish fry heaven for those who look for a chuckload of fried favorites. Really good homey and traditional cabin dining feel plus you got a view of the fox river.

They serve breakfast the entire day and the price are very reasonable. Tried majority of the skillet combinations and they&#39;re very good. Just don&#39;t order for the pasta dishes since majority of the staff and maybe the cook are latinos unless you want your spaghetti tasting like salsa and taco spices. Eveything else is awesome though and did I say free dessert choices for any dinner orders (go for the pies)? Friday&#39;s are FishFry AYCE. I can only have enough fish and chips per meal, but you could substitute for a mash/bake potatoes if you want to mix it up. Some of the choices are cod, walleye, and perch. You can&#39;t switch to a different fish for every plate though and would need to stick with cod if you initially ordered cod. My personal favorite is perch, I find it more flavorful and lightly breaded. The broasted chicken is also a must try. Enough balance of crunch and moist on the chicken to go along with the mashed potatoes, the veggies are a little overcooked and not lightly steamed as I would prefer it.

The service is fast and they&#39;re very attentive to order details. Everyone&#39;s very friendly, like every knew each other. One time we accidentally left my son&#39;s ipad and they found it while cleaning up our table. The hostess kept it safe and I got it after an hour when in most cases it won&#39;t be returned. Kudos to your honest staff. I&#39;ll keep on going here and so far have really good dining experience."

The host staff did an excellent job managing the wait.  Our server was great,  she had the cutest hello kitty tatoo.  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and did have great suggestions.  I had prime rib which I ordered medium,  it came out closer to medium  well or well done.  Since it was my first time I got both brown and chicken gravy to try,  brown was for sure the better of the two.  Wife and daughter had chicken fried steak with brown gravy,  both were excellent.  Mashed potatoes are from scratch and we&#39;re great.  Son had a meat breakfast skillet and pancakes all excellent.  We got 4 pieces of pie to go,  they look good.

The restaurant was recently rebuilt and is very nice,  my daughter said the restroom wad very clean.  For 4 drinks, 4 entrees and 4 desserts it was $72.00.  Over a great experience except for the overdone prime rib otherwise I would give it a 5."

The prices are in line with most diners but those deserts that are often included with meals are absolutely fantastic and an extra bonus. Need I say more?

This place looks nice from the outside but you&#39;ll notice when you get inside: the carpet is filthy, bathrooms are gross, how do they keep the kitchen?

Don&#39;t be fooled, they call themselves a diner, but there is nothing &#34;diner-ish&#34; about this place. It is a family restaurant through and through. But we love those so we still ate. Sunday afternoon, packed, which was a good sign.

First thing I noticed was how much real estate was wasted in here. They could easily fit a handful more tables and booths to ease with the wait times, and the counter (which has about 7 seats) was not being used. Why not? 15 people were waiting for a place to sit.

Prices are fairly steep, and this is the first time I&#39;ve ever had to pay to get fries with a burger. 

Speaking of, I got the &#34;Island Burger.&#34; Which they say is &#34;smothered&#34; in thousand island dressing. Sign me up! Turns out &#34;smothered&#34; here means 1/4 of my bun was lightly patted with dressing. How disappointing. Burger was average, fries were pretty good. The creamy chicken and rice soup was very good.

Before we got our food, we were planning to travel here again to try the breakfast, now we will pass."

We had to ask the busboy for a straw since she was no where to be found. Heaven forbid if we had a problem with our food since our server didn&#39;t even bother to come back around and ask us how everything was.  Over $20 for jus 2 for breakfast, plus we had water to drink!!!!! I guess they got to make more money somehow to pay for that building."

Its really hard for me to write this review because this was my favorite place to eat and now I don&#39;t think I will ever go back, seriously. They moved to a new building which is very beautiful but seems to have affected their food. Although the service is still great. I took my family out to eat which was about 8 of us. No one was really happy with their food but of course it was breakfast so we ate it and just decided not to go back. The home fries are cooked weird now, they are very hard on the outside and potatoes just aren&#39;t done on the inside. The pancakes that use to be amazing have changed and now they aren&#39;t as good, not nasty, just not that good. My brother asked for medium over easy eggs and he says they were barely cooked and he could barely eat them. I even stopped ordering my favorite chorizo frittata because the potatoes were hard inside and it just wasn&#39;t good and it was too expensive to order it and not eat. Im not sure if their griddle is messed up because the time before this we went they were having problems with their griddle so we gave them a pass on the food that wasn&#39;t very good, although they didn&#39;t offer a discount. I wish I was comfortable enough to complain but im just not which is why I wont go back. I can&#39;t help but wonder if other loyal customers feel this way. I use to come here almost every week. Sad to think I wont be going back. Oh well. 

p.s. Prices have gone up a little since the new building, I guess that is to be expected."

Moved to Montgomery and a few people said go to Riverview.  We went for the Friday fish fry (AYCE) walleye/cod.  The batter was crispy, which is good in my book, however the walleye fish itself was a bit mushy inside the batter.  The cod was dry inside the batter.  The hash brown side with onions we ordered were good (I&#39;d come back for those).  They did have malt vinegar for the fish which was a plus.  Wait staff really have no personality to speak of.

I know having omelettes so huge they&#39;re practically falling off the plate is a selling point in 2014&#39;s America... But for those of us with a normal body mass index, I wish I could pay less and just get a normal amount of food. This seems to be a common problem across most (all?) midwestern diners.

The reviews on the lower end of the spectrum are pretty on point with what I&#39;ve experienced. When you&#39;re making omelettes this huge, you&#39;ve got to overcook them. It&#39;s simple physics, as to get the inside of a 6&#34; wide omelette cooked you&#39;re going to have to overcook most of the outside. Again, back to normal sized food, and being able to cook it, well, normally.

I&#39;ve never tried anything outside of the breakfast menu, but know this is the kind of place that has EVERYTHING. Want some Chinese? They got it. Pasta? Got it. Seafood? Got it. This might contribute to why everything is so resoundingly mediocre, as how do you be a restaurant that has great stir fry, pasta, breakfast, steaks, salads, and more? If a chef exists that can knock each of those respective cuisines out of the park, chances are they wouldn&#39;t be working at a converted Pizza Hut in Aurora.

You can tell the clientele who go here truly don&#39;t care about this kind of stuff as they just want two days worth of food for a small amount of money. If that&#39;s your thing, you&#39;ll absolutely love the Riverview Diner.

Oh, and the coffee isn&#39;t great, pretty watery store brand stuff, nothing special."

We are  minority family of six adults. We cancelled our order and went elsewhere.  I felt as though we were treated like second class citizens and we would Never dine there again.

I&#39;ve only had breakfast here and I can tell you that this is another classic example where Huge portions dominate and &#34;doggie bags&#34; are a way of life. People love BIG portions and often will compensate this for flavor. Omelets are consistently overcooked, dry, bland and the opposite of fluffy. You&#39;ll need an extra glass of water to get this one down. Experience tells me the Chopped Steak cooked medium rare is the way to go!

If you must, get here very early to avoid a congested dining area where your conversation is overheard by all neighboring tables as well. I don&#39;t mind that so much, it&#39;s just too much information for me to hear everyone else&#39;s B.S. The seating in here is tighter than a package of sliced bacon!

The building is old and quirky with local businesses advertised all over the tables and coffee mugs. I ordered the patty melt with fries and a side of thousand island dressing. It was all cooked to order and tasted good. The thousand island tasted homemade and was really good. Troy got the 2+2+2 which was just 2 pancakes, 2 eggs &amp; 2 pieces of bacon. It looked average but the scrambled eggs did look nice and fluffy.  Alyssa got a salad (with no lettuce) that was brought to the table in a silver mixing bowl. I&#39;d never been here so I thought perhaps that was a quirky trait of theirs but apparently this was an error by the server who had &#34;just came back&#34; and she quickly returned it to the kitchen to be properly plated.
As for our server, she was attentive enough but extremely eccentric. Honestly, i think she was on drugs but she did a decent job so, to each their own.
My meal was only $8.58 with tax and I had some to take home so i&#39;d say I got my moneys worth.

They had just opened the new rest that week. I had a fiesta burger and fries and it was great. 

I went back 3 days later for Sunday breakfast and it was packed! waited for a table for about 10mins. My friend said lunch/dinner was good but breakfast was the BEST. And it definitely was! I had the &#34;Hungry Man breaksfast&#34; (which is gender neutral btw); scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon and eggs and THE most delicious pancakes I have had to date! They are getting 5 stars for those pancakes! 

Next time I plan to get the strawberry stuffed French toast. 

Just go straight down Montgomery rd and left onto Mill St and this great place pops up!"

The coffee is garbage. Also, I hope you love chorizo because they aren&#39;t stingy.

My opinion is that this place &amp; Oswego Family Restaurant are the best breakfast places in this area and this place is better for lunch.  I also like the atmosphere at Riverview better and they are in the process of building a new facility right next door that will accommodate a lot more tables as the current location, due to the quality &amp; reputation of this restaurant, fills very quickly and waiting is almost guaranteed at prime hours.
Still, the omelets, egg dishes and French Toast are delicious and the BLT club, which I use as a true test for lunch restaurant-to-restaurant, is terrific.  Highly recommend!"

New place is very nice, feels very comfortable &amp; clean and just a lot nicer than the old place that was in an old Pizza Hut location. Not that it matters as the food &amp; service is the main deal....but the new, much larger restaurant just is a lot nicer.
On the food, the breakfast&#39;s that I&#39;ve had are all very good---you order 2 eggs with any dish &amp; you get 4 when it&#39;s served! Anyway, I use a standard entree that I love to gauge these types of restaurants against each other--- BLT club. I have probably had this choice maybe 6 times at this place and every time--- it is just flat-out delicious. Fries are perfect (great, traditional fries--not the &#39;double-crispy&#39; ones that a lot of restaurants have gone to for some reason that I HATE!) and always very hot &amp; fresh and the soups are equally tasty. As I said, breakfast&#39;s are always done very well and the only negative I could come up with here is that they only offer canned corned beef. But most places like this don&#39;t make fresh corned beef and I don&#39;t hold that against them since when you ask, at least the servers have always been honest about it &amp; tell you flat out---which is a major plus in my evaluations of places. You want fresh-made corned beef, you have to go to specialty restaurants like Walker Brothers up in northern Chicagoland or Buttermilk in Geneva--- which excel at their homemade corned beef.

For this type of diner-type restaurant, I highly recommend giving Riverview a try as I&#39;ve always been pleased when leaving after a meal here"

Fish and fries were both good.  the fish was a little too oily, but the fries were great.  Ended with a piece of key lime pie that had a very flavorful crust.

Just because it&#39;s cheap in price doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s cheap quality either. This is some good eatin&#39; going on. Breakfast is excellent. Dinners are great home cooking fare. The selection is huge. They have everything from American and Mexican to Italian and Chinese. And it&#39;s all good too. I have to give props for chicken fried steak and banana cream pie.

A short update. As I dig the fish here, I have often remarked to Eleno the owner, that a &#34;Fish and Eggs&#34; special for breakfast might be a winner, as I have had that dish a bunch north of the Cheese Curtain. The problem is that I usually forget to order it, in favor of the other temptations on the menu. But recently, I went for lunch and as I walked in, one of the waitresses brought out a plate of fish and the lightbulb went on.

My folks and their whole circle are faithful regulars. Came home to visit. We ate dinner there and I was pleasantly surprised by the wide array of menu options. I opted for their prime rib and it was a good 13oz lean thick portion above value. The sweet potato side was an excellent option for we health nuts, but their vegetables were canned. It would be ok to raise the price $1 or 2 for fresh vegetables. Also for the server to offer the horseradish sauce. I had to go to the front to request it. The place was half full and moderately busy. However, there were 3 servers and 2 other staff members/managers. Rounds for water, coffee, and checking up on customers was minimal. If the owner/manager can get their staff to be a bit more proactive, with a couple tweaks, this place will have a 5 star rating when I return in 4-5 months. Along with the new addition they are building, I have great expectations for them if they can get all of their staff up to speed with proactivity. That being said, I have noticed many from the older generation only tip 10% (or less..a dollar or 2!)...Folks, it&#39;s 15% nowadays, 20% for great service! Servers must make a living in 2015!

For the chicken and cod, it&#39;s $9.95, for the all-you-can-eat walleye, it was $12.95.  I went for the chicken, my best friend went for the cod.   Both were fantastic.  Next I will try the walleye.  

When he re-ordered the cod, the 2nd plate didn&#39;t come with two little bits like most places.  It was 4 or 5 nice thick pieces.  

It even comes with soup and a dessert, of which they had about 10 choices of pie (delicious), ice cream, and I think it was rice pudding.  Even the potato choices are insane...fries, baked, mashed, hash browns, sweet potatoes, home fries, maybe even another option or two.  Or you could even opt for mac n&#39; cheese!  There was a guy sitting next to me that had the mac n&#39; cheese and it looked delicious.  

I would recommend this place to Jesus, Mary, and Joseph if they found their way out to the SW burbs.  

Certainly a place that doesn&#39;t care about the bottom line.  It seemed to me like their biggest concern is repeat business.  And the line out the door this past Friday spoke volumes to that effect.

Our bill for the 2 all-you-can-eats and a pop and an iced tea was $23.  I was so satisfied with the experince and our wonderful waitress (wish I would have gotten her name for you fine folks, very friendly young hispanic girl if you go there, you know who to ask for) I left an $8 tip, which isn&#39;t the biggest tip, but for a broke MF like me, a 35% tip means something."

I have a confession to make.  Rarely do I leave a lonely french fry on the plate.  I&#39;ve been known to eat the parsley on the side of the plate.  But, here goes.  I, Tommy M., hereby confess that I left one or more bites of my burger on the plate, as I could not finish the meal due to its massive size.

I ended up coming to this restaurant on an accident when I was hungry just patrolling the area. It looked a little run down but had a beautiful view of the river so I gave it a try. Best find I&#39;ve had based off an impulse. The food was great and offered such a large variety I&#39;m not sure how they stay in business! The service was quick and very friendly even for me coming in around 8pm! The waiter went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of. I started my river view expense with a Reuben and have back several more times delighted that the quality of food was a theme. The best items on the menu are their chicken and their French onion soup. Amazing place.

We stopped in around 8pm Friday night, and it was packed! Mostly families and older folks which, to me, is a good sign. We were seated promptly and presented with an enormous menu - American, Chinese, Italian, and Mexican - oh my! Lots of tempting choices, but we were on a mission: All you can eat! We settled on broasted chicken (not all you can eat) and fried cod (AYCE). After a short wait, our massive portions arrived and all convos ceased - we meant business. I tore into the chicken which had crispy, flavorful skin with juicy white meat. My fries were standard fare, but delicious nonetheless. The cod came with homemade chips, and was replenished until we just couldn&#39;t take anymore. Dinner was followed up by rice pudding that was warm, fresh and sprinkled with a perfect dusting of nutmeg. Full stomachs, leftovers in tow, our check came to $22! Riverview is completely non-glamorous, but I&#39;m giving it &#39;5&#39; stars for the family vibe, tons of choices, solid food and unbeatable prices - but mostly for the feeling you get while you&#39;re there - it&#39;s a true community place - and those are hard to come by these days."

The interior is easily 30 years old and the charm is all there. The signs have obviously been up since the 80&#39;s at least. The menu is quite large ranging from (homemade) Italian beef, Chicago hot dogs, vegetarian falafel sandwiches, grilled chicken or fried, a variety of fried others and gyros. They serve French fries that were fresh cut and pretty good. 

We ordered a chicken gyro, falafel sandwich, hot dog + fries and a small drink. We all shared (2 small kids, 2 adults) for just under $17. I&#39;d call that a pretty cheap lunch. We&#39;d go back again, rating the flavors about a B-. The chicken gyro had a bunch of dressing on top which didn&#39;t appeal to us, and the falafel sandwich had all the right components but was lacking a little flavor blast.

The Hot Dog kind of missed the mark as a true &#34;Chicago Style Hot Dog&#34;. I&#39;ll leave it at that. However the fries were spot on fresh cut spuds cooked perfectly.

Doesn&#39;t look like much when you first pull up and walk in-- the place is a tiny hole-in-the-wall joint. But they are friendly, fast, and very generous with the portions (especially with fries, or if you get the gyro plate) at a great value. Everything that I&#39;ve tried on the menu is yummy, but I usually end up resorting to the gyros, because they are the best around! 

My only wish is that they were open on Sundays."

Got the chicken gyro. I thought the food was pretty good, but not spectacular. I think you would really like it if you&#39;re into gyros and greasy food. Greasy food is just not my type of thing, that&#39;s all."

I am a dedicated slave to keeping my cholesterol level as high as my SAT score. I have been to Johnny&#39;s 15+ times in 10 years, and as Clint Eastwood once said, &#34;It just aint makin&#39; it&#34;.

Very spotty quality, sometimes good+, other times very marginal. Sometimes hot fries (which are great), but more often than not, a serving scooped from a bin that has way too many fries made-up... that have been sitting and cooling off after being heavily salted. 

Lacking in consistency, but it&#39;s better than Portillos."

It&#39;s a great little hot dog stand with a menu filled with variety.. I&#39;ve tried the gyros, burgers and the hot dogs and all are very good! However i most often order up the 2 hot dog special, chicago style( mustard, relish, onion, tomato, pickle and peppers)!

I&#39;ve never personally tried one of their beefs but I did witness one of the owners making a beef and I saw something very disturbing...he scooped the beef out of a Papa Charlie&#39;s container and warmed it up.  It&#39;s one thing to use pre-made beef but to sell Papa Charlie&#39;s (the same awful stuff that&#39;s sold in the freezer section at Jewel) out of a Chicago style fast food place?  That&#39;s just sad.  
My next issue has the do with the hotdogs.  I used to like the dogs but they switched from poppyseed buns to plain buns...a Chicago style dog deserves a poppyseed bun.  It&#39;s just not the same with a plain bun.
My last issue has to do with consistency.  The gyros, hamburgers and fries are great when fresh but the quality is really hit or miss.  Half the time the fries are cold, I&#39;ve been served gyros on stale pitas that weren&#39;t warmed up on the grill, and I&#39;ve been served desiccated sausages...I have ordered an italian and polish from Johnny&#39;s and both were super dried out and not fresh tasting.  Not surprisingly I felt sick and both meals."

The food here is everything you&#39;d expect from a red hot joint but better. They have great deals and daily specials. Their gyro is gamazing, it&#39;s served with a delicious cucumber sauce. My &#34;go to&#34; is the hot dog special. You get 2 dogs and fries with a small drink for about $4. Their fries are the darker ones that have parts of the skin still on them. Makes you feel like you&#39;re actually eating a potato rather than the severely proceed ones. They sell Green River - worth 5 stars just for that. I love their fried mushrooms. Their fried anything is awesome. The other day I tried a patty melt for the first time and fell in love. The onions were cooked perfectly and the patty was the perfect size and the rye was toasted to perfection. The best part about this place is the guys who run it. Love you!"

They have a really good selection of Beer and mixed drinks. But they&#39;re standout selection of food, especially the bacon options are the main selling point. 
They have just about anything you would expect in a pub except they are wrapped in bacon. My wife and I had the bacon wrapped mozzarella sticks, bacon croquettes, and wings.
The sticks were amazing! The croquettes were also yummy too. They were like mashed potatoes fried and covered with bacon and cheese. 
The wings were good too. The bbq sauce wings were the best of what we tried. The garlic Parmesan was ok, but underwhelming. If you don&#39;t like spicy then they are the best for you, otherwise I would avoid them.
In addition we had the Lombardian cheeseburger. It&#39;s signature item was a large slice of fried Wisconsin cheese on top. Soo good! If you can&#39;t decide on a sandwich then just do that.

2 Pool tables
Outdoor patio

The bf and I ordered 2 Crystal Hero IPA&#39;s from Rev Brewing and followed up with their bacon covered stuffed jalapeno app. Very good, esp with their chipotle ranch drizzle on top!

For our dinner I ordered their breakfast bacon burger and the bf picked their meatloaf bacon sandwich. Everything was cooked to perfection, including my medium-rare burger! 

I did want to try their dessert, however, we chose to order a few shots instead! We took their Maple Donut Bacon shot and omgggggg it was so delicious! Everyone should try it! 

This place is pretty epic and we will continue to come here, however, only for special occasions since this place is very pricey.

But the service we received from Dave and his crew was worthy of top billing.  He and his whole team were freindly and unusually welcoming.  We arrived strangers and felt like we left as friends.  

Now for the main course... 

Seriously...  if you are among those who believe you could just about wrap a rock in bacon and it would be edible, then this place will blow your mind! No bacon wrapped rocks here, but they do wrap many delicious morsels in bacon.  They do also crumble bacon into things that may suprise you. And you can drink bacon drinks too. Every item we tried was outstanding.  

If you are not a bacon fan, that is fine too.  They also have plenty of non-bacon items.  Don&#39;t let the bacon theme or the fact that this is a bar discourage you.  This is actually a great place to simply go and eat... and yes of course get a drink. 

There ia a full bar with many micro-brews and the kicker for me is that they even have a few great dark beer (porter &amp; stout) options. 

Take a chance on this spot and you will be pleased you did.  

Oh...  Don&#39;t forget dessert.  It too is out of the ordinary and a treat. And, it can include bacon as well if you are so inclined.

In the imortal words of Homer Simpson, &#34;mmmmmm bacon&#34;."

The place was busy when we arrived but was not at all by this point.  We also had to ask for our tab twice and it came back incorrect, charged full prices for things on special.

Avoid the pulled pork unless you really love the taste of horrible slaw since this was the only detectable flavor despite a significant amount of some kind of BBQ.  I was actually entirely unaware the sandwich was coming with slaw since it&#39;s only mentioned on the primary menu not the specials menu from which I ordered.  The manager eventually took the inedible item off the bill for us but not before trying to buy us off with $5 off purchase of $25 or more coupons that aren&#39;t usable is the customer purchases anything on the specials menu.  We explained we aren&#39;t locals and have an almost non existent chance of coming back and he just looked at with a dumb expression before apologizing and walking away.

Last but not least if you value your ear drums do not go here.  They blast a fog horn into the speakers at max volume every time a local sports team does anything remotely interesting.  I am a big fan of rowdy sports bars but this was just unbelievably obnoxious."

We waited a long time for our server who didn&#39;t stop by until he found out we went up to the bar to get our drinks. The manager who originally gave us the menus didn&#39;t do anything about the lack of a server. Our server left for the night with out telling us. Matthew didn&#39;t have the decency to tell us he was done for the night. 

There was also an incident with a patron who didn&#39;t pay his bill. The guy was arguing with the manager, but the manager didn&#39;t bother to call the cops. She could have put the rest of the customers in danger, if something would have happened.

This place is tucked in a corner of a strip mall and next door here is a huge flooring store that can over power the eyes when you drive by.   Thankfully I drive a small skateboard type of car and able to stop on a dime and whip in! Which is what I did driving aimlessly around trying to hit up a different place.

What caught my eye was &#39;Bacon Bar&#39;....hmmm a bar with bacon items...and bacon items they had!  Started off with Bacon Sampler which contained bacon wrapped mozzarella sticks, jalapeño poppers wrapped in bacon, a croquette of sorts which contained a whole mushroom wrapped in a braid of bacon and steak bites also wrapped in bacon.  The bacon wrapped mozzarella sticks were by far the best with the poppers coming in next.  I might be ok without the croquette but the bacon stark bites were tasty with a creamy horse radish type sauce.   We also order a non-bacon, fried cheese curds.  They were fine but nothing to write to Wisconsin about.   

In addition to baconized food items there were also bacon drinks.  The thought of a slice of bacon dangling over your drinks was enough to get me to order a few of those.  The Pickle Piggy takes a strong love of pickle juice and bacon flavor vodka to chug this one down.  Then there was a Maple Bacon Donut Shot...that was tasty.

Now, what also impressed me was the CRAFT beer selection!!! Large selection on tap and bottled.  Impressive!  

The bar itself is a typical bar with high top tables and a few pool tables plus they do Karaoke on Friday nights.  

Definitely check this place out.  It is a bar atmosphere but the bacon items are great to see on the menu and craft beer choices are fantastic!"

If you&#39;re planning on going there they&#39;re located right next to the century tile building on Roseville Road just go into that parking lot and you&#39;ll get there quick.

The inside is a little dark but there&#39;s plenty of tvs and neon signs as well as outdoor lighting.  The pool tables are busy and plenty of high top tables as well as the bar.

She mentioned their specials and gave us some recommendations so I decided to go with the pulled pork Thursday special while my wife went with a BLT.  They have plenty of drink options as well and are very reasonably priced.  For a non-bbq joint, the pulled pork was good and not overly sauced or sweet.

Mainly because I get to go to lunch and enjoy up and coming local places. This one in particular is definitely up and coming. My brother suggested I go and check out their wings, so of course I did. 

We walked in and for some reason expected a hostess but nobody said anything, so I asked if they were open. One of the owners/managers apologized and told us to sit wherever and immediately we had a waitress at our table. The menu is decent, as is their beer selection. Lots of craft beer, good prices too. 

The first time I visited we had the following: 

12 Wing Appetizer - Whoa, these things were HUGE! Ginormous wings, not your typical Buffalo Wild Wings wings. Make sense? We got three flavors: Hot, Sweet &amp; Hot and Parmesan garlic. My favorite was the Sweet &amp; Hot. 

The Lombardian - Thick fried Wisconsin cheddar on top of 1/3 pound patty. Need I say more. Mmmm hmm.

&#34;Bear Down&#34; Burger - Bacon, Fried Onions, Cheese and whiskey BBQ sauce. 

All of the items hit the spot. For dessert, like we needed it right, the owner told us they were trying out a new dessert (creme brûlée) and gave it to us on the house. It was FANTASTIC!!! Who would have known that a dessert would be that good at a sports bar?

Then, the awesome Chef - Rene - came out and asked about the food. You could tell she loves doing what she does and wanted to make sure we enjoyed every last bite.
  
Since my first visit I have gone back several times, tried more items on the menu and haven&#39;t been disappointed once. 

Lets not forget about Bacon Thursday, yup, exactly what it sounds like. All the menu items are made with......wait for it........wait.......BACON!

Plus they offer free taxi&#39;s on Friday and Saturday if you live in the area. Um....HELLOOOO how could you go wrong with that. They really care for their patrons. 

They always have awesome deals going during the week and weekends. Check out their Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/otlombard?rf=113514372150353) for them.

Whatever - I went with it as I&#39;m not a local and didn&#39;t want to be the tourist pain in the butt.  I started with the pretzel bites and bone-in wings.  Bites were great but the cheese dipping sauce was weak - watered down and runny.  Wings were breaded and way oversauced.  Not having learned my lesson, I ordered the bacon/cheese stuffed burger.  Pretzel bun was dry and hard enough to shield the rain pouring outside.  The &#34;stuffed&#34; burger was anything but - just two patties slammed together with a bit of cheese and bacon in the middle.  Meah.  Nothing great.

We&#39;ve been back twice since our first semi-disappointing visit, and the service has definitely improved. I&#39;m willing to believe that our first visit was a fluke.

The food is definitely tasty and that&#39;s what sells the place -- because the atmosphere is nothing special.

My husband is sold on the Lombardian burger, which comes with a big ole hunk of fried cheese on top, but I&#39;ve now sampled a burger, the Drunken Chicken (shredded slow-cooker style with saucy goodness) and the chicken Caesar pita. All were pretty tasty and well-done. 

The potato croquettes are a delicious little tater tot variation, and my opinion of the nachos has improved, too; the beef was juicier the second time and there was plenty of gooey cheese sauce. I also kind of like having the pico, sour cream and guacamole on the side (good guacamole too).

I do wish they had some booths or normal tables/chairs, I feel awkward perched at a high top on a stool (no back or anything) but I&#39;ll forgive them because they really are aiming for &#34;basic sports bar with good food&#34; as opposed to gastropub or anything like that."

The Buffalo chicken wrap - which for me is a sports bar yardstick- fell short. It should be called a Bleu cheese wrap given the ratio to chicken was reversed. It was grilled a bit which is new. But every bite was just cheese! We got the guacamole and chips. Guacamole was bland and unripe avocados were used. I added salt, black pepper and tabasco to kick it up to a worthy level. The chips were too greasy but expected that from bar food. I can&#39;t come back with all the other options in the area till the food is stepped up a bit. The specials look good though.

This is an average size sports bar in a strip mall on Roosevelt Rd. which is very deceiving for what they have to offer on their menu!  There are plenty of TV&#39;s with games on, pool tables and pretty friendly and helpful staff.

The craft beer menu is pretty good, but I&#39;m really waiting for them to start carrying Not Your Father&#39;s Root Beer!  Then it would be perfection, in my opinion.  They also have some pretty good drink specials throughout the week.

Now on to my forte, the food!  I have tried the wings (hot, parm/garlic and sweet and spicy), burgers (my fave being the Lombardian which has a block of cheddar that is breaded and deep fried right on top of the burger patty!) that are served with a very unique cross between a chip and a fry and the arancini balls.  Everything is really good, my fave being the wings and burgers.  Super fresh and perfectly executed!  They even offer a creme brulee dessert!  Yay, they actually have a chef, not just a cook!  Not what you would expect from a strip mall dive bar!  

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for a fun place to watch a game which eating some amazing food and drinking some different craft beers!  See you at OT!"

After finishing the first drinks we waited about 15 min while the bartender walked around and chatted with her fellow coworkers. I would have like to tried the food before crossing this one off my list but bad service on booze is a no go for me. It scared me to think i would have waited for any appetizers."

They have some great selections on their regular and bacon menu.  During the last two visits, we have had the following and here are the reviews:
- Bear Down burger - good sized burger, a favorite amongst the guys, moisty decent portion and good amount of bacon
- bacon wrapped wings - better than Buffalo Wild Wings because they are wrapped in bacon and the bleu cheese has chunks of bleu cheese in it. One of the best bleu cheeses hubby has had
- pretzel bites - small round pretzel balls of heaven - so soft they just melt in your mouth and the cheese sauce for dipping is just perfect on these, not spicy, not runny just great
- mac &amp; Cheese Bites - stay away from these, they weren&#39;t very good. And I don&#39;t just say that because they weren&#39;t wrapped in bacon. They were small, deep-fried triangles with a drier mac and cheese inside of them. Too greasy, not cheesy enough and there are better options on their menu.  Did I mention the pretzel bites???
- Bacon Brownie - OMG. This is just scrumptious. A good sized brownie, I mean GOOD sized!! and thick and full of actual chunks of chocolate. More fudgy type brownie than cake which was perfect for this kind of dish. With some ice cream (I think) and whipped cream and good sized pieces of crunchy bacon.  And some chocolate sauce. Maybe something else, too, but I can&#39;t tell you because I just go into a trance when I eat this, it is that good. A major sugar rush, along with the saltiness of bacon and the sweetness and fudginess of the brownie.  I just can&#39;t think straight when I eat it. YUM!
- bacon wrapped mozzarella sticks - these are really good. Just typical mozz sticks but wrapped tightly in bacon. How can you go wrong? Wish they would have brought marinara instead of ranch, but maybe the guy who ordered them asked for the ranch instead - not sure.
- bacon croquettes - OMG, these are a heart attack in a dish, but you will die happy. Good sized deep fried balls of mashed potatoes topped with plenty of sour cream, ranch and bacon. These were really good.

So, would I recommend it? Yes. In fact, I know it is a bar, but I think my almost 17 yr old son would love the bacon stuff and the brownie, so I&#39;m considering taking him here for lunch one day.  It is just that good.  And bonus? There are no women servers running around in cut off shirts, tight shorts, with their bodies exposed. Or wearing mock kilts.  Sorry, you other two bars know who you are - let&#39;s leave it at that. I can bring my son here and I don&#39;t feel like we will need to have a discussion with him about why they are dressed like that when I leave. (yes, I made the mistake of taking him to the other place when he was very young hoping he wouldn&#39;t pay attention and he asked me why the waitresses were all just wearing their underwear.  Needless to say, we didn&#39;t go back no matter how good their seasoned fries and ranch were) Thank you Overtime for giving me a place to go where the food is good and I could actually bring my son during the less busy hours if I wanted to for a good meal. (And no, I wouldn&#39;t be drinking if I did that, for all you people who are going to start criticizing me for doing that - I would be coming for the food.  To those people - Lighten up people.)"

Tried the Parmesan garlic and sweet &amp; hot. Absolutely enjoyed the parm garlic; perfect temperature, plenty meaty, crispy breading, scrumptious garlic sauce, faultlessly moist chicken, and shredded parm coating was icing on the cake. Sweet &amp; hot were great too, but #1 goes to the garlic. Regrettably, the beer selection wasn&#39;t as advertised. Hardly what I would even consider a mediocre craft beer selection; however advantageous prices made up for the lacking in variety. Food came out quick, but overall service left something to be desired. Stopping in on a Sunday was the right move, as .50 cent wings and $2.00 domestics supplanted certain local tap deficiencies. All-in-all, a decent local sports bar putting out some great wings, bar food, and draft beer...just don&#39;t expect much more than that."

The blonde vixon of nose ring bar keep, who is pleasant to the eyes (I am married and looking at the menu, not buying the food) is awesome. I know she has worked elsewhere in the area just not sure where but I do remember her as a great beer slinger, not just a pretty face. She sure didn&#39;t let up on the gas pedal of quality service at the Overtime. I truly appreciate her work ethic as well as the the bearded chef bouncing out wonderful bar dishes with speed, taste, and pride. Plenty of TV&#39;s and an aura of localtiy. My only concern here was the retread of patrons that belly up from bar to bar...most likely being banished at one time or another because they handle their happy hour liquor as well as a wet fart on a plastic chair riding the Metra. Not that I am a perfect bar fly, just noticed a few folks that have caused high maintenance trouble at more than one of the bastions of barley and hops that I have frequently attended. Highly recommend the &#34;OT&#34; as a destination for a game or a happy hour gathering but do suggest an extra $20 in the wallet for a cab ride home because the general atmosphere comes across as a fun time that won&#39;t suddenly stop at the &#34;limit&#34;. Cops are a plenty in the area so I strongly urge you to plan on a &#34;DD&#34; or pre-arranged drive home. Na Zdrowie, Overtime, you seem to have hit the beer boomba right in the middle of the glass for a wonderful experience!"

This place is great. They have a nice staff and plenty of TVS to watch  games. There are good daily specials, including cheap tacos and rum buckets.

I think I have tried most everything on the menu, and still love the drunken chicken sandwich and miss the flatbread pizza with red onions and jerk chicken...although they made one for me off the menu last time!

There are only high tables in the place, which is OK, and not the most comfortable chairs for long-term stays. Additionally, since there are cement floors, the acoustics are crappy, and depending on the volume of the TVs, sometimes it can be noisy.

I have not been to trivia night yet, on Thursdays, nor taken advantage of the free cab ride home on weekends. There are often coupons available in discount mailings."

Service was slow, but there was a Hawks game on, so I understand.  First of all, if you&#39;re going to have an entire menu devoted to bacon...how about trying to use some quality bacon instead of what I could go to Jewel and pick up.  Secondly, they ran out of plates, we were given Dixie paper plates (probably from the Jewel where they picked up the bacon ha!).  Oh, and word to the wise, close your tab about 45 mins before you want to leave, because that&#39;s about how long it takes to get that all squared away."

The manager Pete and all the bartenders and servers were great. The price for craft beers cant be beat. Their specials are always good and change monthly. They have 2 nice pool tables, host pool tournaments and have league pool players come in. The outdoor patio is nice now with the shorter fence. 

The real kicker to this place is if I go in for a Hawks or Bears game I can&#39;t sit somewhere that doesn&#39;t have a great view of at least 5 TV&#39;s its amazing. 
The FOOD is to DIE FOR, I&#39;ve tried a good chuck of their old menu and like going occasionally for the bacon menu. Now they have a Daily Bacon Menu. I&#39;ve come in and the employes are usually pretty happy, recently I was in with a friend from work and the owner or manager was there he sat at the bar and was staring at us, I mentioned it to my friend he asked if I wanted to leave but I didn&#39;t since i suggested this place. This was the first time I&#39;ve had a negative experience here hopefully it will be my last negative as well. 
 
It seems like every week they have something going on if not every day. from live music to Elvis. If you go in a group on friday or saturday they offer free cab rides which is nice if you find yourself having to good of a time."

Staff is amazing.  I&#39;ve always been given excellent service by Stephanie and Kelly.  Even when this place is busy my glass was never empty.  Never waited more than a few minutes to get a drink.  They have perfect timing, just as my beer is almost gone they pop up...now if thats not good service I don&#39;t know what is!  This place a good selection of food to choose from. For a quick snack  I recommend the cheese curds and spicy ranch (thanx for the recommendation Steph).  You can always get in a good game of pool and a nice crowd Friday nights for karaoke.

The atmosphere is great and the place has plenty of TVs to catch sporting events

There are plenty of drink specials and great selections of beers and liquors.  During hawks games that have 2 dollar Miller or Bud, and they have Rolling Rock bottles every day for 3 dollars, which is a huge plus for me.  They have tons of specials everyday

The food may be some of the best &#34;bar food&#34; i have ever eaten.  The food is never frozen and you can really taste it.  The wings are in my top 3 of all time, if not the best wings ive ever had.  On Thursdays they have a special Bacon menu.  Me and my girlfriend tried the Bacon S&#39;mores for dessert and they were FANTASTIC.  Everything was very tasty

The staff and the owner are all really friendly and really attentive.  You can tell they really care about their customers.

Let me start with Lizzie B&#39;s comment from 4 days ago. I happened to be there that night as well. We had a server that had some experience working here and a new server in training. There was also another girl (blonde) training but taking tables on the other side. While I enjoyed the service from our training server, it appeared that no one was really helping her out. We ordered food and we&#39;re told that it would be over an hour. That was correct, it was. Why? I don&#39;t know. Was it worth the wait? Absolutely not! I&#39;ve been to a 5 star steakhouse on a Saturday night without reservations and waited less time to be seated and fed. Over an hour for less than average quality nachos... I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t pay more than $2 for the drafts we were having. I wanted to tip the lady that paid attention to us all night (the one in training, Tyesha) but she said that as a trainer she couldn&#39;t accept it. I found that to be a pretty stand up thing for her to do. Although we didn&#39;t feel the lady with red and black hair deserved the tip we hoped Tyesha would receive a portion of it. I think if ur gonna turn good people into great servers you should start with proper training. She must have had previous experience or she might have been lost. We might come back because of the specials, but we&#39;ll definitely eat beforehand."

Iput some money in the tunes machine and as soon as my first song came on they turned the music down. When my second song came on the bus boy turned it down more. I said what you don&#39;t like the music I paid for so you turn it down. He said he had a headache and it was too loud. Funny how it wasn&#39;t too loud before my songs came on. Then the bartender has the nerve to tell me ,is that all you came in here for was to play music?  So shes so ignorant and dumb that she doesn&#39;t remember me buying a drink 2 minutes earlier and that its my money in the machine.

However, this is a Mom &amp; Pop place that serves fried chicken, ice cream and root beer.

Everything about this place is accentuated by inconsistency, especially the fried chicken. You never know if they have enough pieces available to fill your order. You never know what combination you&#39;ll get for a 4-piece meal, legs thighs or 3 wings and a breast! You never know if the pieces will be large or small or how much time the whole process will take!

Everyone seems to ignore this because It&#39;s been here forever,

It is choo-choo train themed diner. The food is quite good considering the diner is geared to entertain children. On the evening we were there, the specials included Siracha wings and French dip nachos - hardly children&#39;s fare.  I had the beer batter deep fried cod; it included three nice sized pieces of moist cod and a choice of fries or chips.  My wife had the patty melt which she enjoyed; it included a generous portion meat. Our granddaughter, well she just had a plain hot dog which was what she wanted.

The stools around the center diner table are low for adults, but at comfortable height for older children.  For younger children, the stool seat can be removed and replaced with a high chair or booster seat. To entertain the kids, the meals are delivered by a choo-choo train. If you don&#39;t want to sit so low, there are booths on the outside of the diner - no train-delivered food, tho.

On the screen in the back of the diner, a &#39;Thomas the Train&#39; video plays for the young ones.  Additionally, there are video and arcade games for the kids to play. When you leave, the children are given a complementary plastic ring and a train whistle (you&#39;ll enjoy that on your way home!).

All in all, we all had a nice time and some delicious food. I recommend All Aboard Diner over other restaurants geared toward children."

The fries were awful - you could tell the oil hadn&#39;t been changed in months, maybe years.  The sandwiches, the burgers, all ridiculously low quality, and really overpriced for what you get.  Had I paid $5 for it, fine, but these prices were similar to what i would pay in a serious burger joint.  And more than $6 for a KIDS meal?  I would rather save my money, go to steak n shake where my kids eat free, and the burgers and fries are actually pretty damn tasty."

Wait staff was very rude, our waitress looked younger didn&#39;t catch her name. She was straight out rude and looked overworked. They really need more workers or less tables because we got horrible service. The owners; the man looks like he hates the world honestly, I don&#39;t know why he even owns a kids restaurant because he looks like he hates kids, every time my kid had a problem with a machine he&#39;s was so grumpy about it like it was such a task for him to fix the problem. The women didn&#39;t know how to seat us and looked very confused. And on top of that the women started yelling at one of the waiters to clean or something, these people seem like they don&#39;t care about their staff at all. This isn&#39;t my first time in here either I&#39;ve been in here once before and the women actually made our waitress cry and she went in the back for awhile, I asked if she was okay when she came back and she said she was fine but I could tell she wasn&#39;t, that time going the service was good but not this time I don&#39;t know what happened. And if treating people badly doesn&#39;t do it for you they make the waiters go under this bar top and they never wash their hands, they use the same rag to wash the counters and everything else in the restaurant. Overall staff doesn&#39;t look very clean and neither is the restaurant.

We happened to be in the area and needing some lunch. I saw this on Yelp and we went right over. 

Holy trains! Everywhere! There&#39;s a Thomas movie playing on a couple screens, a train that runs on a track near the ceiling, a train set near the front door and, the best part, a train that drives up to you at the counter to deliver your food. 

My husband and i agreed: the food was actually very good! I kinda expected it to just be mediocre and that the place thrives on the train gimmick. But I had a bacon cheese burger that was pretty amazing. My husband enjoyed his burger. The kids shared a meal and inhaled it. Next time I&#39;ll pass on the special fried pickles, they needed more pickle, it was like eating fried cucumbers. 

I will also add that while we were there, the woman sitting next to my husband had a medical emergency. The employees handled it all in a very professional manner. A gentleman working the front counter took the very young boy up front to have ice cream while the paramedics worked on his mother. I was impressed by how well everyone handled themselves.

Sometimes, a night out with simple food and plenty of distractions for the kids is just what the doctor ordered.
That&#39;s where All Aboard Diner excels.
At the counter, a small train passes by, carrying food to customers, stopping at its destination before the waitstaff serves it. My boy loved watching it. Fair warning: if your kid is hungry, expect some whining when the train passes by to serve other customers. Fair warning the second: you&#39;ll probably have a longer wait time if you want to sit at the counter than if you want a booth.
The place does get busy. Luckily, there&#39;s another model train, complete with effects, in front of the restaurant. Two other coin-operated trains, which kids can ride for 50 cents, are also in the restaurant.
Beer and wine are offered for grown-ups. I was pleasantly surprised to see Revolution&#39;s Anti Hero on the menu.

Tables are somewhat small.  There is a party room, however it&#39;s usually roped off for the frequent parties.  Food is good.  Nothing amazing but definitely enjoyable.  If your kiddo is into trains, you&#39;d probably want to sit at the counter.  Your food is brought out to you on a train if your at the main counter.  If you sit at a table, there are trains near the ceiling that circle the room.  I remember when my daughter was a baby and in a car seat, she enjoyed seeing the trains go by.  So, I guess this is a great place for big kids, little kids and even babies to enjoy!

The people are nice.  Food is average price.  Not too expensive but not cheap.  The location is interesting.  It&#39;s easy to find, easy to park and there is a Toys r us down the strip.  But, if your goal was to park, eat and walk around to shop, there aren&#39;t many other child-related stores near by.  

The place is clean.  I know we had to use the bathrooms before- I believe there is a changing table in the women&#39;s restroom.  Highchairs available.  Fun decor.  

Overall, I&#39;d recommend if you have a train lover in the family.  :)"

So I went here last Friday night and it was about 7:30pm so business was closing for the night.  The old lady (owner&#39;s wife) gave us a booth which was filthy dirty from a prior party.  She goes, &#34;let me clean it&#34; - and she smiled.  When she cleaned it; she still left food particles all over the table so I had to finish the job myself.  

The friendly waitress takes our order and brings back a burger, hotdog, and kids chicken fries.  I had the burger and I want to say they switched to food service products because it tasted just like a patty I would get from Sam&#39;s or Costco but at least the fries were okay.  I noticed my daughter barely ate any of her chicken fries so I took a bite to coax her to eat it.  What a mistake did I make.....  The chicken fries were sort of luke warm in the middle and I reluctantly swallowed the fry.  Awful undercooked food service product.  I didn&#39;t say anything to the waitress and we just took our check and left.  The next day I spent the morning on the crapper so I had to assume something wasn&#39;t right with the chicken.  My stomach felt bad all day long until Sunday.  

That&#39;s sucks, because I used to really like this place and I&#39;m disappointed that they switched over to crappy food service products now.  Or maybe I just never realized they were food service products all along?"

My 2-year old was quite thrilled to be going to the choo-choo restaurant just like he&#39;d visited with his grandparents. So for his birthday, we took him with little sister in tow.

We had to wait a sizeable amount of time-- but to be expected on a Sunday for prime seating at the counter.

The restaurant was clean, very stimulating, the food was good and the prices were reasonable. I was shocked at the great variety of food. They had THREE types of vegetarian burger patties! I ordered one of those and my husband had a chicken burger with mango salsa. We were quite pleased.

The train delivers the food and comes around about every couple minutes for your kid&#39;s enjoyment. There is a lot going on, so if that&#39;s not your kid&#39;s thing, this might not be the place for you. Obviously, weekends and peak hours will have you waiting.

Have plenty of quarters on hand if you have a kid who is aware of that sort of thing, because they have kid machines with cheap toys lining that joint. If it&#39;s a birthday, let them know and your kiddo can choose a cupcake or scoop of ice cream with lots of options.

We&#39;ll be back. Fun experience indeed."

I figured I&#39;d be eating a burger or a hot dog here because in my mind, you&#39;ve been to one train themed restaurant, then you&#39;ve been to them all. I was so wrong. 

First, this place is full of trains. There&#39;s the train that runs along the counter that delivers your food (of course). And then there&#39;s the train that runs along the upper wall, along the whole course of the restaurant. Then there&#39;s the miniature train set up where your kids can push the buttons to make different parts of the display light up or move. Then there&#39;s the mechanical train ride that rattles and hums. Then the two large Flat-screens that run Thomas the Train videos non stop. 

Sensory overload? Surprisingly for me and my son, No. 

Then there&#39;s the great menu I mentioned earlier. There are burgers and dogs, but I love that there are many different kinds of toppings for your burger. There are many different salads, sandwiches, chicken, fish available too. I love it. And yeah, other than the fountain drinks and milkshakes, you can order beer (some craft options too) and wine. 

My buffalo chicken salad was delicious. They also offer unlimited refills of soda so my diet coke was filled as often as I wished. I tried my son&#39;s burger and fries--both tasty. And his strawberry milkshake was pretty darn good too. 

Service was spectacular from beginning to end. The hostess (whom I think is one of the owners) was super sweet and helped my and my son settle in to our seats. Our server was awesome and really anticipated our needs. The price was right for a nice meal and train entertainment. 

The restaurant opens at 11 and when we arrived at 1120 on a Saturday, we were lucky to snag some of the last seats at the counter. There&#39;s booth seating but the train doesn&#39;t deliver your food to you. So yeah, prime counter seating on weekends goes fast or prepare to wait a bit. 

I also love that you can purchase train engineer hats for the kids here too!"

I&#39;ve always meant to come here but finally had the chance as I brought our G-daughter here today. I later come to find out that the owners are the originals owners of the Royal Shield restaurant in Darien which if you grew up here you&#39;ve definitely been to a time or two! I always heard the owners were going to start another restaurant but never envisioned them opening a kiddie place!? Their menu was pretty basic but had some nice completer items such as salad, appetizers, and fried pickles which I&#39;ll get next time when there is more than one adult present. They had a cool inactive railroad right when you walk in which made it difficult to get back to our seats. There was a railroad going around the perimeter of the restaurant and another little railroad that brings the food out to you if you&#39;re seated around the &#34;bar&#34; area where your server will assist you to take it off and get you whatever else you need. Our server was very nice and helpful! The food wasn&#39;t bad!! A little expensive for kid food but you have a lot to experience while you&#39;re there and it&#39;s entertainment your paying for!!"

We took our 4 and 1.5 yr old boys this last weekend for dinner on a Saturday.  We got in easily and didn&#39;t have to wait for a seat.  We were seated at the counter so the kids could revel in their food being delivered by train.

I read the previous reviews about the food and I have to agree.  So/so food.  I ordered the fish and chips and it came with a side of tartar sauce that was simply a plastic container of Kraft Foods tartar sauce. The 3 small fish fillets were likely frozen and baked.  My husband had a burger and he said it wasn&#39;t bad. Kids had cheeseburgers and fries with a side of fruit.  They also have a few dessert options from ice cream to brownies and cookies to cupcakes.  Mine had cupcakes...served on a Styrofoam plate.  Who still uses Styrofoam??  

The kids enjoyed watching the train go around the ceiling, pushing the buttons by the train set by the front door and a myriad of other things.  Would I go back? Yes; the things we do for our kids, right? Was I excited about the food? Not so much."

But please note: do NOT come here if you hate kids. It is swarming with kids. 

My brother is not a kid, but he is a train lover, so when he and my dad came to visit I thought this would be perfect for a fun and inexpensive meal. Sure enough. There is Thomas the Tank Engine playing, railroad memorabilia everywhere, and free train whistles for the kiddies. 

The menu is fairly impressive for a little dinery place. Burgers, sandwiches, salads, fried fish and fried shrimp. There are vegetarian options, including a three-grain burger and a black bean burger. I got a &#34;Cajun jack burger&#34; (cajun spices, pepperjack and grilled onions) with fries; my brother got a plain hamburger; my dad got the black bean burger. 

I have to say my burger was tasty, though it was a) not medium as ordered and b) *not* spicy at all. Must be the midwestern version of Cajun. But it was flavorful and the fries were solid. 

Service was good, our waiter was friendly and available. The atmosphere is mildly chaotic. 

BTW, for directions&#39; sake, it&#39;s a HUGE shopping center on the NW side of Lemont &amp; 75th -- there are several turn-ins off Lemont Rd so feel free to turn there instead of going all the way down to 75th."

This was on a Tuesday night and the place was empty.  We had our choice of places to sit and our son could explore without worrying about bothering anyone.  of course we sat at the bar so we could have our food delivered by train.  We got fries and onion rings and both were quite good.  Not fabulous, but definitely much better than you would expect at a normal place themed for kids.  The specials they had on their boards... mango chicken sandwich and fried ravioli among them, sounded fabulous.  Perhaps we will drive down again to have a proper meal here."

We took our 4 year old boo here last week, and I was just expecting some hokey train themed restaurant with okay food. What I got was a hokey train themed restaurant, really good &#34;bar&#34; food, and warm heart feelings that I will carry with me for the rest of my life (or maybe like a week).

We sat at the counter in the center of the restaurant versus the booths. This is vital bc if you sit at the bar, you get to have a model train bring the food to you!!!!! What. 

I ordered the buffalo ranch chicken sandwich. It was like Portillo&#39;s good. The fries were decent too. My babydaddy ordered the Big Boy burger. It was so good, I dare say almost better than the original Big Boy (of which we sadly don&#39;t have any locations in the western burbs). So delicious. Plus they serve beer.

Here is the heart warming part: A 2 year old boy across the counter from us was having his bday at All Aboard. It was so cute to see the train bring him and his sis each a blue frosting covered cupcake. His eyes were wide with amazement and the staff also sang him a bday song. I clapped along like a huge dweeb, it was a magical moment.

There is a fantastic mural on the wall back by the bathrooms. If you want to see a glamorous giraffe and a lion in a beret, I highly suggest checking it out.

There is also a bunch of claw games in the restaurant. They are each $0.50 to play. If you want to waste $0.50, let a 4 year old play a claw game without any help. Because 4 year olds totally sucks at claw games."

Keep in mind this is a family establishment, emphasis on family. There are toy trains everywhere rolling around including the main toy train that actually brings you your meal. 

DO NOT COME BY YOURSELF if you are an adult. You&#39;ll feel the same way I did when I sat by a train carrying chicken fingers to some little kid. Its just like going to chuck e cheeses without a child: completely awkward. 

The food is pretty generic diner food you can find in a steak and shake. Fries, sandwiches, hot dogs...etc.  The quality isn&#39;t that much better. I had: 

&#34;Homemade&#34; chicken noodle soup: Pretty bad, the broth was bland and flavorless and the noodles and vegetables were either over cooked or undercooked. (See picture) A complete ripoff at 3.95. 

&#34;All Aboard Dog&#34;: A basic chili dog with crappy chili that had more beans and sauce than meat, onions, and melted cheese. Worth the price seeing as it was only 4.95 and came with a lot of fries which were fine. (See picture)

To my surprise they actually serve beer and wine here which is pretty amusing to imagine drinking beers while a little train drives by you. 

Bring the kids, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll like this place. I certainly cant go back...."

Our server, Wendy, was extremely courteous and attentive to our every need. I had a chance to speak with Nick, the owner of the diner, who shared with me the story of how he started the place. 

The restaurant is kid friendly and very clean. An electric train was mounted high along the wall and wrapped around the entire restaurant. Booths were lined along the wall on the left and right sides of the restaurant and there was a looooong counter in the center of the place with seating. The highlight for the kids (and adults) was that along the inside edge of the counter was a train track that ran to and from the kitchen. When our food, which was served in baskets, was ready, it was loaded on cars on the back of the train and the waitress would use a remote to have the train deliver our food from the kitchen right to our end of the counter.

The video games and other interactive train set is a nice touch. I had a burger and fries and it was all just ok.

They offer two veggie burgers that really BLOW AWAY most any restaurant I have been to.  Seriously, they know how to prepare a no meat burger so well we deconstructed it for recreation back at the home lab.

Finally, a frequent visitor card is available, ask for it if you have kids!  Spend $20, get a punch, 10 punches, get a $20 gift card.  That is a 10% discount people just for eating... and they have coupons in the local mailers too.

We didn&#39;t have a kid.  We just wanted our food to be delivered by train.  I mean, if I can get my sushi to arrive on a boat, why not my fries on a train?

Despite about 3 birthday parties, kids were pretty well-behaved.  I heard only one annoying scream the whole time and that was short-lived.  This place is train-overload.  Trains zooming around, train art, Thomas the Tank Engine on the TV and The Locomotion playing on the speakers.

There was another childless group that came in, but one was on the way so I guess they just were in training (get it?) for later.  The father looked like he was getting a kick out of the place though.

They have a Boca veggie burger, one of the larger-sized ones, and it came with fries.  I think it was like 7$ so not to bad considering entertainment was free."

My girls love this place.  There is a larger counter area for the train than other places that we have been to. They also have a large variety of foods for both the kiddy menu and the adult menu.  

I had the philly cheese steak and it was delicious. Don&#39;t get sucked into all the random little games on the side though. They give out train whistles and rings for the kids--some hooray for random little toys that I end up stubbing my toe on in the middle of the night--but at least the kiddies like it.

Our server was nice but probably starting to lose steam--since it was nice outside and a little later in the afternoon. It happens--I think I would but a little nutty too if all I heard all day was train sounds and the obnoxious birthday song.  Again I&#39;m not a fan of visiting places during the peak of their lunch/dinner rush--but when we did visit there was a birthday party going on--we received out items hot and fresh with no delay.

In terms of pricing I thought it was average--not too expensive but too cheap either---for the novelty of it--it was a nice visit."

My nephew had his 3rd birthday party at All Aboard. There is always something going on whether trains passing overhead, arcade machines being played your child will be amused and entertained. We had about 15 adults with us and a handful of kids. The menu is extensive ranging from 14 unique burgers, 7 different style salads and beer. They even have jumbo fried shrimp, chopped steak and beer battered Cod.

Our server was outgoing, friendly and on point, my soda was always filled, our table never had to ask for anything. ( I wish I got her name, blonde hair with dark glasses).

In the end its the kids faces that really makes this place wonderful, its something new they&#39;ve never seen.The kids reactions of a train bringing your food out is priceless."

My 5 yr old daughter loves trains.  We got there before Noon and were seated at the counter.  The bar stools are really low, but they come right off and the staff placed a regular chair with a booster so the little one could reach the counter.  It was a blast watching the choo-choo train deliver food! My daughter had a smile on her face the entire time.

I ordered the All Aboard Chicken, which tasted just fine - I ate the whole thing.  My husband ordered a grilled chicken wrap off the specials menu, and he ate the whole thing.  My daughter had a cheeseburger and she ate the whole thing.  The fresh fruit cup was really fresh and delicious.  

There is a binder behind the counter that lists all ingredients in each item, which is helpful for those with food allergies or intolerance.

No, this is not a fancy-schmancy restaurant, but the ambiance was great, the prices were reasonable, the food was good, and the staff were friendly.  The restaurant was clean, as was the ladies&#39; room.  We definitely will be back."

There is a train running on a track near the ceiling, a model train operated by kid friendly buttons, and your food is even served on a train. Thomas is playing on the television, and the incredibly friendly and helpful wait staff even wore conductor hats. The food was decently priced and average greasy spoon fare. This will definitely be a go-to location with my nephew. 
They do serve beer, which is great for adults coming here, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place without a child- unless you REALLY love trains."

Food is ok. Typical dinner food.

I hate the whole train phenomenon. Don&#39;t know why. But we were looking for something fun to do indoors today so we went. The owners (I&#39;m assuming) were so nice and had 3 seats ready for us as we walked in the door. They serve beer and wine (great idea) and there was a lot on the menu. The food was really good, and I plan on going back to try some more. I also like how they serve Kraft mac and cheese (and note it on the menu so you know that it is) because 95% of the time, it&#39;s the only mac and cheese kids will eat. They are smart to have good food because it&#39;s the parents that take their kids back! I also expected angry teenagers to be working but the waitstaff was great - smiles all around on their faces! The only reason why I only gave 4 stars was because you can&#39;t move the chairs at the &#34;bar.&#34; I felt like I had to yell for my husband to hear me when I was trying to talk to him.

First time this weekend and the kids LOVED it.  Our two little ones were enthralled from the moment we stepped in.  They are 3 and 5 but there was an array of kids here ranging in age and all of them seemed to be having a great time.

The hostess greeted us right away and asked if we would like to sit at the counter or the booth.  There is a U-shaped counter space with bar stools that take up the middle of the restaurant...around/on top of that U are train tracks where the food is delivered via train stops.  On either side of the U, there are booths and tables.  At the open end of the U is the kitchen and a huge flat-screen monitor showing cartoons (Thomas the Train on this day,  of course). 

Our son loves sitting in booths so I initially said &#39;booth&#39; but the hostess was great, asked if we were in a hurry, and then convinced us to take a seat at the counter.  It was full at the time, but she had a party leaving, and sure enough, we were seated within 2-3 minutes after that.  I really appreciate that she wanted us to enjoy our time here.  I&#39;d told her it was our first time and she wanted us to get the most of it.

Food orders included hot dogs, cheese pizza and egg salad sandwich. Good food for a great price.  I was tempted to order beer or wine, but didn&#39;t.  We&#39;re french fry fanatics and the ones here were really good too.  The egg salad had cut-up pickles in it.  Tasted better to me than the usual relish mix.  Service was quick but they didn&#39;t rush us after the meal...giving the kids a little more time to enjoy the train delivering meals to others at the counter.

The rest of the diner has games and gum-ball machines.  Most games are 50 cents each (they also have the &#39;claw&#39; game with candy...play till you win).  Another train runs along the top of the restaurant  just under the ceiling. In the front is a train display where the kids can press buttons to make the train (and other things) go.  They also have a separate bday party room off to the right once you first step in.  Bathrooms and coat hooks in the back of the restaurant.

Staff here is all wonderfully friendly and efficient.  When we left and paid the bill, they asked if we had a good time and was happy to hear we did.  They also gave us a frequent visitor&#39;s punch card  I have a feeling we&#39;ll be using it a lot.  The kids also got to take home train whistles.

Overall, a terrific experience.  Kids have been asking when we can go back.  We&#39;ll have to be back soon.  And I highly recommend sitting by the counter whether it&#39;s your first visit or not."

We threw our son&#39;s 3rd birthday party here and I placed the order with the owner&#39;s mom and worked with him,  as well.  They were really fabulous and easy to work with.

Decor: Trains galore!  My son and his friends loved the machines and the train model up front.  The parents got a kick out of the buttons, especially the Strong Man one to &#39;test your strength&#39;.  The party room was filled with balloons and mylar balloons of Thomas the Train and Happy Birthday!  I love the flat screen tvs around playing Thomas, as well.

Party: Each kid got to pick out his own meal and got a cool cotton hat, as well.  After we sang Happy Birthday to my son, the kids all lined up to get their own scoop of ice-cream.  The private room is nice for parents to leave their coats and the gift table was nice, too.

Food: This is probably the best train diner around Chicagoland with their food!  They had 7-8 different options for the kids, including a gluten free chicken one!  My son loved being able to pick something he would eat and even got to pick out his sides.  The adults had apps and sandwiches/burgers in quarters which we enjoyed, as well.  The chopped salad was delicious - bacon and chicken - yum!  We had ordered several of the turkey club sandwiches and burgers which were well made, as well.  Some of the parents also enjoyed a beer, as well.

Suggestions: Next time, it would be nice to maybe get a name tag or something to identify the kids that were with our birthday party.

Overall, service was fabulous - our server was very accommodating and helpful with our group of kids.  THANK YOU AGAIN!!"

Just visited All Aboard Diner on Friday as a last-hoorah for the 15 month old I had been nannying for. I wanted a special activity for our last day together (I got a big girl job unexpectedly and we had to part ways). I knew she goes cuckoo for the the little Thomas trains at the public library so I thought this might just be the place to be!

We rolled in about 12:45 on a Friday and the place was surprisingly not packed. Busy, but not packed. Cute decor all over the restaurant, a train that runs the length of the restaurant while you eat and TVs playing Thomas the Tank Engine all over the place. Awesome sensory overload! To top it all off- a train brings you your food and always runs the length of the seating area so there is a train before your eyes once about every 20 minutes. 

Long story short- girly loved it! All I heard was &#34;wooooooooow&#34; as she alternated pointing to either train as it drove by. It was hard to get her to pay attention to her food! Staff was super polite, the owners were there working and they made sure everyone was well taken care of. Didn&#39;t even bat an eye when girly stole my cup of water and promptly dumped all over herself and the floor; they actually brought her her own cup with a lid!

Then why the 4 stars? Here&#39;s the big difference between this location and the downtown train diner. The price. Downtown doesn&#39;t have all the frills that this place has but their food is priced significantly lower. This location has prices more like you&#39;re eating out at a diner restaurant. $5.99 for a kids meal- a cup of macaroni and cheese and a fruit cup. I had I believe about $6.95+ for a veggie burger and fries. That in itself was not bad but I couldn&#39;t get over the $5.99 for girly&#39;s food. Oh, well, it was definitely nice for a once in a while treat!"

The food was decent. The atmosphere is a little weird - but totally fine for a lunch with the kiddos. I had a turkey wrap that was tasty, although something was &#34;off&#34; flavor-wise. The fries were delish.  My son ate his ENTIRE burger, which is unheard of for him. My daughter ate her entire hot dog and was raving about the place :-) 

Definitely something to try, at least once."

My son is three, so I expect we&#39;ll be back a couple hundred more times before he moves out.

If you have kids and live in the west burbs, check out this very cool little choo-choo themed diner.  It opened a couple weeks ago, so it&#39;s clean and sparkling but still has a lot of character.  If it isn&#39;t too busy you can sit at the big U-shaped counter with the train track and the train will bring you your meals.  Standard diner fare - burgers, hot dogs, fries, chicken sandwiches and ice cream.  My kids were ecstatic.  While they wait, they&#39;ll be entertained by the train circling the room from the track suspended from the ceiling, or the model train/town set up.  There are also televisions showing Thomas the Tank Engine videos (no sound when I was there) but it was the last thing my kids paid attention to.

If Yelp had half star ratings, I might be tempted to dock another fussy, parental half star for giving each kid a free whistle as they leave (don&#39;t worry - no shrill blasts in the restaurant).  They serve beer too, so it&#39;s all good.

It&#39;s a few doors from the Toys R Us."

All Aboard is the best, hands down. Let me start with self-indulgence and squee over a veggie burger option: fabulous! The restaurant is clean, service impeccable, quick seating even with a wait, Thomas on big screen televisions, delicious food, reasonably priced (all things being equal). We are in the DG quite a bit, and the kids (3 and 2 y/o) lap this place up. Highly recommended! A great family restaurant and everyone there is so nice and ultra kid-friendly. Keep a sharp eye out when heading there--it&#39;s tucked in a bit in a shopping plaza but definitely worth the turn around if you pass it up. Awesome!"

A nicely designed location, it sports plenty of seating, good service, a LARGE menu, and a good experience.

Sometimes the smallest detail can give you a good insight into a business.  Here, I&#39;d have to say, it&#39;s the fact that they&#39;ve chosen to use large baskets on the train for their food.  They&#39;re not chintzy with the food; the baskets come full, and the food is very good.

It might sound strange, but we kind of measure most of these places in comparison to The Choo Choo in Des Plaines.  The Choo Choo is a virtual madhouse of kids, activity, and radiates an underlying sense of joy by the owner.  It&#39;s small and cramped, though we allow for that due to the historical nature, and so, given the great atmosphere, The Choo Choo gets high marks in the end.

All Aboard is a little more sedate, and is a much larger, nicer, and modern place.  It is different from The Choo Choo, but is every bit as nice an experience in a different way.  Anyone contemplating a train restaurant would be well-advised to note:

1) Great selection of food on the menu, including the way it has been executed - nice to get a basket that doesn&#39;t look skimpy,

2) Nice decor, very enjoyable for both the kids and the adults.  The overhead train, train layout in front, etc. all keep it a bit more exciting for the kids,

3) Good call on having a (small) party room and an ice cream station

Things that aren&#39;t so hot:

Seating during peak times.  Cheating by sticking chairs between stools is kind of crummy.  Probably okay if it&#39;s just for kids, but two adults and a kid - that just doesn&#39;t cut it.  (The toddler highchairs over a stool thing is way cool, however, and definite bonus points for having the best highchair-to-seating ratio I&#39;ve ever seen.)

Location, location, location...  the first time we went, it was hard to find, until we figured out it was way in the back of a strip mall area.  2Toots DG definitely has the gold medal for location.

Overall, though, I&#39;d have to put this at the top of the list - probably alongside The Choo Choo - for excellence in train-themed restaurants in Chicago."

Try and get a place on the counter - they can stack two highchairs or a booster seat to the counter stools so your little one can watch the train action. Food is delivered on a train - awesome.

My son was so excited, and there was absolutely no need to entertain him. It was wonderful. You wouldn&#39;t expect much at a place like this food-wise either, but the food was good. My Reuben was great, the fries perfect and my son&#39;s burger was better than anything you could get at a fast food place. We ordered him a scoop of ice cream and it came with a cute little train whistle on top of it. 

For three of us to eat was only 25 dollars and the food was for sure better than Crapplebees. This is a great little family run place with a super friendly staff. Our server, Melissa was so nice to my son and was right on top of everything we needed. They have a birthday party room too, and if it was just a little bigger we would have my son&#39;s there.

We overheard birthday parties throughout our entire dinner.  It was cute, especially since my nephew was so excited about the whole ordeal.  But I was definitely ready to go.  I blamed our server for my under-enthusiasm, as he looked like he was in pure hell the entire time lol.

The food came on a train, but it was about the quality and price of something I could have ordered at a movie theater.

When you walk in, it is definitely set up like an old diner but with a massive train theme! =]  Everything from the wall decor to the music playing had something to do with trains and my kids loved it!  We were asked if we wanted to sit in a booth or wait a few minutes to sit at the counter where your food is delivered by the train...so of course we waited!  That was the whole point!  (I said there has to be some way that they could have made it so every table was served this way...but who knows!)

When we sat down we were greeted promptly and ordered our drinks and shortly after, our food.  Everything we ordered was really good, we had the Cajun chicken sandwich, Buffalo chicken wraps and a Gorgonzola burger and I substituted my fries for onion rings for a small charge.  Again, everything was very good, juicy and flavorful and the onion rings are a Black and Tan onion ring and you can really taste the beer!  Yum!

Let&#39;s call it like it is, this is a restaurant for toddlers and little kids. In that aspect, it excels. My daughter had an absolute blast here. You know the concept, so I won&#39;t repeat it. Train that brings the food? Check. Train decor? Check. 

The main counter, on which the train runs that brings the food, is huge. The seats are a little low compared with the height of the counter, so it is a little awkward sitting there. Also, the stools are placed pretty far apart. This is good from the standpoint of not being crowded up against your neighbor, but bad from the standpoint of, if you are coming here with a kid, who will most likely sit between you and the other adult in your party, forget about trying to hold a conversation with them because they will be a good 6 feet away.

The food was pretty decent. My wife got the BBQ Pork Sandwich, and I got the French Dip. Both were really tasty, although it would have been nice to have a bit more dip, and in a little wider-mouthed container. Our daughter got the chicken nuggets and potato chips, and she actually ate a bunch of the nuggets (she&#39;s notoriously picky, and either loves or hates chicken nuggets depending upon the day or the position of the planets). As an appetizer, we ordered the Sweet &amp; Spicy Asian Boneless Wings (yeah, that right there will tell you this is a step up from Two Toots), and they were really good. Presentation was a little dull, but come on, you&#39;re here for the trains and food that is decent enough to make you refrain from toddler-overload-induced thoughts of suicide.

Overall, while not the height of gastronomic excellence or originality, this place is the best of the train restaurants I&#39;ve been to, yet."

My 4, 2 &amp; 11 month olds loved it and so did me and my husband. Food was good, the trains we&#39;re mesmerizing to the kids and we can&#39;t wait to go back. Totally worth it! Service was outstanding! Not a drink went dry, special orders were a breeze and they have patience for the kids and the parents. My son who has tons of allergies was actually able to have dessert here because they have delicious allergy free cupcakes. Loved this place!"

We were looking for someplace cool to take them for dinner while visiting the Chicago area, and came across the All Aboard while browsing reviews on Yelp. Since both boys are total train fanatics, we thought they&#39;d love All Aboard ... and we were right!

The All Aboard is in a large shopping plaza, which had plenty of parking. (We drove from Rosemont, which was a hike, but at least it wasn&#39;t downtown traffic!) We went on a Saturday evening, and were pleasantly surprised to find that they weren&#39;t terribly busy. 

The boys were immediately transfixed by the train chugging around the wall and the one delivering food to diners. There were also several games, a small train to ride in, a very cool miniature train set-up, and a train whistle kids can pull on when they leave. (My sons could have done that all day!) The diner looked clean and tidy.

The restaurant had both high chairs and booster seats available to fit over the bar stools at the counter, which was nice for the boys. There was a good selection of kids&#39; items, with some healthy options (milk and a fruit cup instead of pop and fries, for example). Most of the food was fairly typical diner food (hot dogs, sandwiches, etc.), but what we had was very tasty. The prices seemed reasonable to me -- I think we spent $36 for four people.

We don&#39;t have food allergies in our family, but I did notice there were several menu options (including desserts) for kids who do have them, which was a nice touch. 

I was afraid getting the kids to leave would result in tears, but the lure of the train whistle convinced them to head for the door so they could try it out. We had a great time, and next time we&#39;re in the Chicago area, we&#39;ll certainly be back!"

It could very well be because just about everyone who goes to these places has a child under 7.     The really funny thing about All Aboard Diner is that food is actually .... pretty good!   

I had the Reuben and my wife had a burger and they were both quite good.   My son had a hot dog - and well that&#39;s pretty hard to screw up.      Also try one of their shakes.   Be careful when you go - as on school holidays (President&#39;s Day, etc.) this place gets packed and you&#39;ll be waiting for a table.      

You may not appreciate this place if you don&#39;t have a little kid in tow ... I can understand the reviews of people w/o kids who can&#39;t wait to get back out the door."

My kids can&#39;t get enough of the train delivering food.  Even if the food isn&#39;t being delivered to them.  My son is a huge Thomas the Tank fan, so he just loves this place.  Not to mention the huge TV screen playing episodes of Thomas the Tank Engine. (But they also have another less obvious TV playing stuff for the adults).  The looks on my children&#39;s faces both times make All Aboard well worth it.

I tried another train themed restaurant (Choo Choo Diner in Des Plaines), at there was absolutely no comparing.  All Aboard is definitely much better.  When I went to the place in Des Plaines is when I realized how very clean All Aboard is (Choo Choo Diner was not as well kept and I noticed it the moment I walked thru the door.)

The food is great.  They have a pretty large menu for the size of the operation.  It&#39;s very impressive.  Between food, drink, and dessert, you can spend an easy $10+ per person.  But the quality of the food is great and well worth it.  I love the pizza burger.

Service is always very friendly.  I have never had a wait time the times we&#39;ve gone.  However, I have pinpointed a non-peak time (which I&#39;m not sharing with you or you&#39;ll all be showing up at my secret day and time).

Location wise - I think it&#39;s great that&#39;s it&#39;s located in a plaza/mall with more than ample parking.  Heads up, the first time I went I recieved some odd directions from either my GPS or Mapquest.  I can&#39;t remember which.  So just in case, taking I-355 to 75th is the easiest way to get there.  When you exit on 75th you would want to go eastbound, and the diner would be on the left side right by the Toy R Us.

All in all, this is a great place, great food, family oriented, and I could be here an eternity typing every detail about how wonderful it is.  You definitely need to check it out."
all-aboard-diner-downers-grove,Chuck D.,GbVSRqA1mPaLqw6nfv9NqQ,"Minneapolis, MN",0,1,0,39,11,vkmm15Cpnlbd8pNrM8G9rw,4.0,2010-04-02,"Let me explain my ignorance first. 

My mom and sister were coming to visit and I was doing the usual last minute panicked Yelp search for new vegan places to try. For once, and I mean this never happens, they actually arrived early, leaving me little time to fully research my lunch choices. I had read that there was a vegan choice here and that it also served great burgers (hey, I don&#39;t always have to give up my meat!!). It was fairly close, and seemed fast. 

...How the name &#34;All Aboard Diner&#34; escaped my attention, or &#34;my kids love this place!&#34; - is far beyond me. But I had absolutely no inkling that this place was a train themed cafe made mostly for kids (although, I think they are missing a business opportunity by not making this 21+ after 10 pm on the weekends and using that train to deliver shots...). 

That being said... this. place. was. awesome! How fun!! Short little stools sitting around a railroad track that had trains delivering your food to you! There were exactly three seats left at the bar area that they offered to us, but we didn&#39;t feel right stealing those last seats from the kids that would inevitably arrive just after us being seated. We opted for a more comfortable booth. I was content to be here just to be somewhere so different and fun, but the burning question is - can the food have any choice of being good here?... and how many vegan options are there ACTUALLY at a place like this? 

As far as the vegan options, I was disappointed. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d recommend this for vegans, even though there are vegan &#34;options&#34;. I put options in quotes because I asked the waiter what their options were and he was like &#34;oh! we have a boca burger...&#34; ...I waited for the &#34;and....&#34; but it didn&#39;t come. That being said, if you enjoy Boca burgers, come on in, vegans! My mom and sister were not sad about this. They said that it was as good as any boca burger they have ever had, and it really hit the spot after a long morning of driving! (Phew!)

As far as the food for the rest of us, I was definitely pleased. I got the Cajun spiced burger. I have to admit, I was a little worried that it would be tasteless. I guess I just don&#39;t expect a place like this to have good food because they don&#39;t have to. Kids will force their parents to come here anyway. The burger was very good. You could definitely taste the spices and it was juicy and cooked to order. The fries were just good fries. I really enjoyed my lunch, as did my mom and sister. 

I guess this place isn&#39;t for everyone. But definitely if you have a family, bring the kids here, they will love it for sure! If you are looking for a cute place to go out to a quick lunch or dinner, I would say to give it a try. How often can you have your food delivered to you on a model train? I mean really...."

Bottom line: I would return if I were in the area but the sushi restaurants in Lake Forest and Northbrook are more authentic, which explains my 4 star rating."

The menu offering is more creative and diverse than an average sushi place.  I enjoy the rolls here more than their sashimi.

Tuna Dumplings $10 (2 pieces)- Stuffed with snow crab and avocado, wrapped with fresh tuna and drizzled with chef special sauce.  This was the first time trying these sushi bar appetizers, and although good, I wouldn&#39;t order them again because I didn&#39;t think they were worth the price.

Hot Sexy Mama $15 - Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, asparagus, crab stick inside with jumbo shrimp on topped serve with chef&#39;s special sauce.  This is one of their most popular rolls and it is served lit on fire.  It&#39;s rich and flavorful!

Nemo Roll $12 - Tempura soft shell crab and avocado topped with spicy tuna and eel sauce.  Good roll.

Located in a strip mall next to Best Buy."

I ordered a couple rolls of sushi and the Mongolian beef. The sushi is fresh and very tasty. It comes out really quickly and the service is attentive. The Mongolian beef is also really good, seasoned well and not sickeningly greasy. It comes with miso soup which I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of. I&#39;ve read a couple reviews saying the sushi was expensive but I thought it was about on par with most other sushi places in the area.

We have been in that plaza a million times and never even knew that it was there! But by kismet we had a crazy hankering for Asian cuisine and the god of raw fish delivered this magical treat to us.

It doesn&#39;t look like much from the outside, but that quickly changes. It is a nondescript storefront sharing the plaza with Toys R Us, Best Buy, Half Price Books, and a bunch of smaller stores and restaurants. There isn&#39;t much to draw you in, but you should totally listen to me anyway and go! Once you get inside, the atmosphere is super zen and the restaurant is wonderfully decorated and comfortable. The wait staff is prompt and polite, making sure your drinks never go empty. There are plenty of booths and tables in the front of the restaurant, but also a few more private areas in the back. They have a sushi bar and a drinks bar, as well as a full menu with all of the Pan Asian favorites if you&#39;re not in a sushi mood (crab rangoon, thai rice, mongolian beef, sesame or orange chicken, pad thai, etc.). 

We tried an eclectic assortment including both sushi and the tasty appetizers and entrees listed above. I actually found the prices to be pretty similar to all of the other restaurants in the Downers Grove/Oak Brook area, and well worth the cost. If you&#39;re in this area and at a sit down restaurant, you can certainly expect to pay at least $12-$15 for a meal. The sushi rolls were excellent, probably some of the best I&#39;ve tried. My husband absolutely swooned over his mongolian beef. Everything that we had seemed excellent for the price. They clearly go to a great deal of effort on the preparation and presentation of the food, and this shows in the quality of the meal. We will definitely be making Kyoto one of our regular restaurant stops in our rotation!"

Tables were spread out so you didn&#39;t feel like you were on top of one another. Plenty of lighting but not brightly lit so it still had an intimate feel. This place was a lot bigger than I thought. Towards what I thought was the back was: a good size sushi prep station. Sushi chefs were laughing and talking with customers and one another. What surprised me was behind that was another seating area with louvered doors to separate diners and a nice size bar w/ a tv. Bathrooms were kept clean and neat. 
Back to our table, I enjoyed the black leather chairs and neat tables everyone had. Very comfortable. Sushi was very fresh and rolls were presently with ginger and wasabi. Nothing had an odd appearance, or smelled bad, or tasted poor. All top quality! Enjoyed the blacked tuna as an appetizer also along w/ miso soup. Rolls sampled were Volcano,Caterpillar,Flaming Snow,Rainbow roll, and Torch. Service was excellent and accompanied by hot towels in the beginning. A very nice touch.

The salmon was glazed with teriyaki sauce and it came with a small salad, 6 piece CA roll, and a bunch of tempuras - yam, broccoli, other veggies, and 1 shrimp.

My only complaint was with the spicy white tuna roll as it was white tuna mixed with tempura and not spicy at all...I&#39;m not a fan of tempura in my rolls as that&#39;s all I can taste.  I just wish they would&#39;ve said that it was in there bc I would&#39;ve chosen a different roll.  I would definitely eat here again...inside or take out!"

I had drink about 3 to 4 full glasses of water while there. I understand that most restaurants are fairly high in sodium however I just was left with such a salty salty taste after eating there yesterday and I had only eaten the Kyoto sushi yesterday. Period. I&#39;m writing this review at 11:20 AM the next day and My mouth is still dry. Also it is currently at my attention that for you get full from this Establishment you&#39;re required to spend about $60 between two people... Also some of the roles such as the special cucumber roll could definitely use a slightly bigger pieces of actual sushi fish. The cucumber roll it was like a $12 roll and I could barely taste the yellowfin tuna in there. 

Otherwise it&#39;s not over sauced the flavors are there it&#39;s very good I would like to come back again however I may give another sushi spot a try before coming straight to Kyoto again."

My husband and I have been lamenting over the wonderful sushi spots we used to visit when I lived in the city... until now.  This place is very unassuming - it&#39;s near a Disc Replay and Best Buy for crying out loud.  BUT it so much better than any other suburban sushi place my husband and I have tried yet.  (cough.. cough... RA..)

You can tell that they really have fun with their menu and yet still certainly know how to cater to their audience.  We got the Pink Lady, which comes in a martini glass with a LED light that changes colors, the tuna and avocado roll, and the spicy crab roll.  The presentation was fun and professional.  There isn&#39;t anything too crazy on the menu - mostly shrimp, crab, lobster, and eel - but they really don&#39;t let you down with how many combinations are on the menu.

Ordered the Hot Sexy Mama, Spicy Tuna Roll, Sushi Sandwich, and chicken fried rice. The Hot Sexy Mama was drenched in sauce/mayonnaise concoction. The sushi sandwich seemed to have no fish in it, just rice and mayonnaise. The spicy tuna was okay, but lacked much flavor. The worst was the fried rice. Was doused in oil, and only had bits of chicken in it. There were also only a few pieces of green onion in it, with no other vegetables in sight!"

The sushi is always very fresh, nicely rolled, and delicious. This place excels at presentation. Just look at the pictures, the plates are beautiful (and sometimes flaming or glowing!)

For standard rolls my favorites are spicy white tuna ($6), spicy scallop ($5), and spicy salmon ($5.50). 

For specialty rolls my favorites are spider roll ($8), Sakura ($12), crazy roll ($9), flaming snow ($12) and sweet heart roll ($13). 

Try the specials too, those are always good and usually the most impressively plated!

We really enjoy this place and feel it is very comparable and equally delicious to the sushi we&#39;ve had at Hokkai in Glen Ellyn (also very delicious). 

Please try this place. The atmosphere is nice and quiet and they&#39;ve updated their decor. Service has always been prompt and polite."

Shitake Roll - You definitely taste the mushroom as they do not skimp on it.

Scorpion - Not bad.

Hot Sexy Mama - Cool presentation, but I think it would be better with less mayo sauce.

Salmon Bento Box - Wow, so much food. It comes with miso soup, salad, salmon, california roll, edamame and shrimp &amp; veggie tempura. Everything was good and great value.

Mongolian Chicken - My guy wanted this (yes, he&#39;s weird) and I didn&#39;t really care for it.

Overall, I liked the ambiance and the food was pretty good. Service was good.

This review is a combination of two separate lunches. When I first visited on Tuesday, the restaurant had just opened 15 minutes ago and the place was already filling up. I was on a tight lunch break and the waitress was very accommodating. I ordered off the specials menu since it was the first thing within sight. I asked for the godzilla roll and the spicy tuna lollipop. They both came fairly quick and were displayed nicely. However, the flavors just seemed to fall short of my expectations. I am not a fan of cream cheese in my sushi, unless it is minimal. The godzilla roll seemed to be overpowered by the cream cheese and it was all I could taste. Cream cheese and sauce. Not a great combination. The spicy tuna lollipop was okay. It looked very pretty but the flavor was one-note and bland. This should have been a warning for today&#39;s experience.


After trying another restaurant in the area for lunch yesterday, I decided to come back to Kyoto for lunch today. To my surprise, the place was empty and I was their only patron. I thought I&#39;d play it safe this time and order the 3 sushi roll lunch special. The special came with miso soup, which I never really liked so I cannot comment on the flavor or quality. I ordered an eel avocado roll, a spicy tuna, and a spicy crab. The lunch special selection was pretty basic, otherwise I would have opted for a caterpillar roll or spider roll. I just didn&#39;t feel like throwing more money down the drain. The eel avocado roll was good, although I felt like it could have had more eel in it. The spicy tuna was not spicy at all, and I should have foreseen this from my last experience. It was extremely disappointing, since I feel that spicy tuna is hard to mess up. The spicy crab was terrible. I did not even taste any of the crab, just rice noodles or something. I&#39;m sure it was shredded imitation crab or something, but it was tasteless. I ate two of the pieces and left it on the plate. 

There was a man who stood behind the register and checked on customers, so I am going to assume that he is the owner. He came to clear my plate and saw my barely eaten spicy crab roll. He smiled and asked if I had ordered too much and if I wanted a box. I replied with &#34;no, I didn&#39;t like the roll.&#34; His response was &#34;oh, okay&#34; and took my plates away. I wish he would have at least asked why I didn&#39;t like it, but he didn&#39;t seem to care. People in the area must like it, with all these rave reviews. I have a feeling that the flavor of their sushi only comes from the drizzled sauces, not the actual seafood in the roll. Overall, I give it one star for the good customer service on my first visit and the second star for the eel avocado roll. I also appreciate that they don&#39;t put a whole ton of rice on the rolls, as most of the affordable places do."

I didn&#39;t expect a lot walking in. The architecture and interior design inside the place was weird. The room that our group was seated in was in an awkward position in the restaurant, kind of isolated and not part of the main seating area but also not a private room setting since it was still open out. The food itself was good. We ordered uni sushi, fish roe sushi, sashimi platter, seared salmon tacos, salmon sashimi salad, spider roll, udon noodles (stir-fry not soup). The uni was good. We double checked with our server and made sure it had just arrived that morning. The proportion was unlike any other sushi restaurants. There was SO much uni packed on the top that it almost toppled over. The whole thing is supposed to be one bite but it was so big. Restaurants usually have a small portion of uni and small portion of rice, both balanced, or small portion of uni and a lot of rice, but this place served us monster-size uni sushi. Very generous portion. I don&#39;t know if it was just that night. The sashimi slices were fresh too. The salmon taco was unique and creative. Everything was on a very, very thin and crispy fried wonton skin. The salad was very different and pretty good. Both the tacos and the salad were recommended by our server. I don&#39;t think they were on the menu. Their spider roll came out in a very pretty design, with the web drawn on the plate. I&#39;ve never seen that before, but my friend said a lot of restaurants make that design on their plates as well. The roll itself was okay, not amazing but still tasty. The udon noodles were not bad. I&#39;ve always had it in soup so this was the first time trying it in stir-fry style. All in all, it was a good dinner and a very filling one too."

1. Miso soups were ok but it is something very difficult to ruin 

2. Ika maruyaki - burned and really the opposite of what it should taste like. Aside is not really good  

3. Rolls: spicy scallop and white tuna - ok. Philadelphia - the fish seemed to be less than fresh and not very tasty. 

4 presentation is acceptable (nothing special considering a true Japanese restaurant should be about presentation almost as much as t is about good. 

5. Atmosphere and decor - very nice inside, ambient atmosphere, good choice if background music. Cool traditional eating booth inside with the option of seating on the floor. 

6.  The service is far from perfection. I can&#39;t say it is bad - it&#39;s just the attitude if out server was something like doing us a favor. The food came relatively fast and she did pop in a couple of times to ask how we are doing, but the attitude was not really welcoming. Maybe she was having a bad day. 

Overall - solid 3 stars but nothing spectacular."

It is never really crowded there either. The dimmed lighting inside is perfect for a romantic evening together. Besides the food what I really like about Kyoto is that it is run by real Japanese folks. The owner is Japanese, the waitresses are Japanese and most importantly the chefs are Japanese! That means you know the food is going to be authentic. The music is also exellent oriental music. Their lunch special is very reasonable. Two rolls and a miso soup for $11 or three for $15.

My family and I come here at least twice a month (we hardly dine out as a family, I love to cook!) but when I get a craving for their delicious hot tea down to their unagi maki or a salmon bento box, this is our Sushi restaurant in the West &#39;burbs.  Service is fast and friendly and efficient. For our app, we always get edamame.  Perfectly cooked and deliciously salty, my daughters favorite.  My husband and daughter share a tempura udon soup, they substitute the shrimp tempura for more veggies.   My hubs also orders several pieces of mushroom maki.  I usually get the salmon bento box meal which includes a miso soup, salad tempura, edamame, rice and california rolls and for dessert, mochi balls!  Sometimes if I am feeling hungry I will add some tuna maki or unagi maki rolls.  MMMMM

It is THE place to eat sushi in the area. Everything is well-priced and freshly made, presentation is incredible and you won&#39;t have to fight anyone off for a seat. It&#39;s not modern and trendy, rather, feels intimate and cozy.

Do not leave without ordering the Pinky Lady. The presentation of this - and the taste!!! - are so awesome, you just can&#39;t leave without trying it.

Amongst the chain of chain restaurants that pretty much takeover the area, it&#39;s a much welcomed change of scenery. It&#39;s ridiculously close to where I work and quite convenient as well. I&#39;ve come a couple times to take advantage of the lunch specials, and while I haven&#39;t been particularly blown away with anything, I also haven&#39;t been let down. There&#39;s almost nothing sadder than feeling you&#39;ve wasted your money on mediocre sushi.

I get the L3 Sushi Bar Lunch Special, which comes with Miso Soup and your choice of 3 rolls from a rather large list. These are mostly basic rolls and they aren&#39;t bad. I call it a &#34;sushi flight&#34; and joke that I travel to New York, Boston, and Alaska. I&#39;ve also ordered the Spicy Tuna roll before. It leaves tingles on the tip of your tongue, but it&#39;s not setting off any fire alarms anytime soon. My spice tolerance is rather low and even I would like a little more kick. However, it is very tasty and probably my favorite. I like the other rolls, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of the cucumber that&#39;s found in most of them. I feel it overpowers the fish and other ingredients.

As far as I can tell, Green Tea is free and greatly appreciated by me. It has a robust flavor while remaining relatively light. I go through multiple cups of it and always want more. I wish they would offer a little side salad with the lunch special, but for $15 it&#39;s still not a bad deal. You get 18 pieces of cut up rolls, soup and hot green tea. Tax is $1.25. I typically round up and leave $20. So it&#39;s not the cheapest of lunches, but it&#39;s a nice treat every once in a while and only a few dollars more than many of the surrounding options that provide neither the friendliness or deliciousness that Kyoto serves up."

I have heard 3 out of the 4 excuses on my last 3 attempts to use a coupon: 1. Coupons are not to be used for alcohol. 2. Because you ordered the lunch special, you can not use this coupon. 3. We are not taking coupons here anymore. 4. You can not use this coupon because a hobbit came in yesterday morning at 7 and smashed up our coupon redemption system (firing several pieces of sushi at me.) This would have been a 5 star review if the service was better, however, 3 stars because I have to build in an extra 10 minutes on every visit to wrangle with the staff in order to be able to redeem my coupon."

We love this spot. Great rolls, service and casual atmosphere.
As a former city girl the sushi rivals that from hot spots for a much more reasonable price.

I ordered the pink lady roll and it came with with a light in a margarita glass- super creative. Its a bit dark in the restaurant at night. They have these cool rooms that you can sit on the floor towards the back. I thought my sushi rolls would be a bit bigger but they did seem a little small for the price. The strip mall its in is a little difficult to access- off the main road and its really busy around there. I was a little disappointed they didnt have soup or a small salad which is pretty standard for most Japanese restaurants I have eaten at. Otherwise its pretty good.

I love sushi and finding great quality sushi without having to empty the wallet is always a good thing. Service was very friendly, I thought a little too much hovering, but friendly enough.  

I met the Ms Renita M here for dinner on a Friday night on another one of our sushi expeditions. I was surprised to see that the place wasn&#39;t that busy.  It&#39;s cozy for date nights yet atmosphere not so hushed that it would a nice spot for groups as well. There&#39;s a small saki list, but they also offer wines and beer.  I chose a glass of Lychee saki--so very good with a nice fresh Lychee flavor.

I liked everything we ordered. 
Edamame (I could have gone without the salt they added, though)
Nigiri--Super White Tuna and Red Snapper
Rolls--California Rolls, Mexican Roll (Tuna, salmon, avocado, jalapeno, cilantro with spicy mayo) and the Spicy Girl Roll (tempura shrimp, cucumber, topped with spicy tuna and tempura crunch)

All the fish was very fresh and the presentation was lovely. Of all the things, The SWT was my favorite--very good quality Tuna--super buttery and melt in your mouth.  I am not a huge fan of non-traditional Maki Rolls, but the Mexican Roll was wonderful and my favorite roll of the evening.  The cilantro wasn&#39;t overpowering and gave it a nice fresh touch. 

Don&#39;t leave without trying dessert.  We had the Tempura fried red bean ice cream.  Not heavy or greasy, very light and not overly sweet.  If I could have ordered one to-go, I would have.  Yummy!"

Since we were already seated, we ordered a small starter  and that was enough for us to say no more.
Ordered the  spicy tuna roll &amp;  eel roll, only to be disappointed.  The tuna rolls 
are my standard  measure for the quality of the food and this just didn&#39;t pass.
The spicy tuna  didn&#39;t have that fresh caught  quality you look for in good sushi and was served with very little ginger.   The eel was better but still lacking.  The Sapporo beer was tepid.

Their dishes are very reasonably priced and I love that they have some different and creative rolls in addition to a standard sushi menu.

Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t had too many leisurely experiences here where I could take my time to eat, but only because I usually come here with groups during lunch breaks or when we have somewhere to be.

The service is consistently good here. Many times, we&#39;ve called ahead to place orders knowing that we have limited time to eat. They had the food ready when we came in, brought the bill promptly when we asked for it, and separated our checks without any complaints or problems."

Seriously, though...this is a place where the regulars are really into their sushi and very friendly.  You can tell that the sushi chefs enjoy interacting with people at the bar and it doesn&#39;t hurt that every bite was amazing.  

I sat at the sushi bar to watch what they were putting out to the tables for a little while before ordering.  Like most places these days they are all about the rolls.  Fortunately, that didn&#39;t degrade the quality of the nigiri.  I had a chef&#39;s selection that masqueraded as a sushi deluxe on the bill but came across as &#34;what are your favorites?&#34;  

I followed the plate of nigiri with a flaming contraption they were calling a &#34;hot sexy mama&#34; that the people next to me (left side) loved so much that I had to get one myself.  That led the people on the other side of me (right side) ordering one also.  I&#39;ve had similar in other places and in other cities but this really was the very best one ever.  I think what put it over the top was the addition of eel sauce under the roll on the foil.  When they flamed the thing it caused the eel sauce to caramelize onto the bottom of the pieces - spectacular.  The guy on my right side told me that his very favorite thing they made was something called a salmon dynamite and insisted that I had to give it a shot.  It was a large single bite that involved a single hand-made piece of inside-out salmon roll topped with a spicy scallop and a wedge of avocado.  Much like everything else I ate there, it was amazing.   

I truly enjoyed every single bite of every single thing I ate."

I asked could there possibly be anything done he stated that he should&#39;ve been notified early but he never once asked how the food was or stopped by to check on anything he just dropped plates and kept moving. He still never told or got the manager to come out. He was very rude!

They have a really diverse menu here which was good for us. Tyler was able to get his California Roll, but was also able to get Sesame Chicken too. We split an order of pot-stickers and I had two rolls, the Boston Roll and the Dragon Roll, which were both very good.

Started out with the beef and broccoli to help fill us up a bit, as with our paleo diet, no rice with our sushi makes it hard to feel full... and it&#39;s pricey to keep eating more sashimi.  

Beef Broccoli:  Nice sauce, good flavor, very tender beef, and well crafted overall.  Not an overabundance of food, but just right if you get it with the rice.

Sashimi Deluxe (x2):  Three pieces of tuna, salmon, super white tuna, snapper, halibut, and two pieces of yellowtail.  This is going to be hard to explain... all the fish were not fishy (as in spoiled or bad), but at the same time, it didn&#39;t taste fishy enough (it lacked the correct flavor).  If you&#39;ve ever tasted truly fresh salmon or tuna, you&#39;ll know that while it doesn&#39;t smelly or taste bad, there&#39;s definitely a certain flavor to the fish... and it was missing in all of them except the yellowtail, and the super white tuna.  My best guess?  The other fish were frozen for too long of a period and the flavor was lost in the defrosting process...

Verdict:  It&#39;s a nice place, excellent friendly service, and the sashimi is A-OK overall.  Yellowtail and super white tuna stand out as good, but the others just lacked the flavor with true fresh fish.  Since it&#39;s not that close to us, we won&#39;t likely be back, but it&#39;s worth checking out if you&#39;re in need of a sushi fix and you&#39;re in the area!"

It&#39;s part of a strip mall so it&#39;s easy to overlook, but trust me when I say it&#39;s a hidden gem.

Came by here on a whim around 11:30 am on a Saturday just as they opened.  They were vacuuming and still getting prepared so I felt a bit awkward but I was too hungry and in the mood for sushi to care about the ambiance upon entering.  We were the only customers there of course so we were cared for and served promptly.  I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s a lot nicer at night for dinner.  I ordered calamari and tempura for an appetizer, or at least I thought I did but when we got it I found tempura calamari.  It was a cute mistake and it ended up not being half bad so I didn&#39;t mind, haha.  

We ordered three chef special rolls:  Pink Lady, Spider Roll, and Spicy Girl.  Every single one was delicious.  All three of the dishes were also very filling.  My mom and I couldn&#39;t finish everything off.  Sadly, we didn&#39;t have enough space for dessert so I can&#39;t comment about that but I definitely will when we come back for dinner sometime because the fried bananas sound great.  I also eyed their drink list and some of the sake and wines sound yummy too.  I think I&#39;ve found a new go-to sushi restaurant.  We used to go to Dao if we wanted a sushi fix since it&#39;s so close by, but this place has quality food for a considerably lower price."

I guess I always assume they don&#39;t have a quick turnover rate.
The server was super friendly and quite attentive...but then again the restaurant was literally empty.  
The spicy hamachi roll had tempura crumbs in it and was slightly fishy tasting.  The shrimp tempura roll was tasty, as was the tuna + avocado roll. Edamame and miso were standard. 
The prices are very fair!

The fabulous Ms Aimee M met me here for a sushi expedition and I am pleased to say it was a success.

Service was attentive and friendly, the food was fresh and delightful, and the atmosphere is cozy and comfortable.

We ordered:
- edamame
- 2 super white tuna, 2 red snapper 
- California roll
- Mexican roll (tuna, salmon, avocado, jalapeno, fish egg &amp; cilantro with hot mayo)
- Spicy Girl roll (tempura shrimp &amp; cucumber topped with spicy tuna &amp; tempura)
- a glass each of sake
- tempura fried red bean ice cream

Lotta food, right? And yet, it did not empty my wallet! It was pretty much all delicious -- the Mexican roll was probably the most out-of-the-ordinary and had great flavors, but even the California roll managed to be special.  The white tuna completely melted in my mouth, and the snapper tasted like... the ocean. Not &#34;fishy,&#34; just fresh and with a subtle but distinct taste.

It&#39;s so rare that I get to go to a bar that plays such fun &#39;80s and &#39;90s music.  We didn&#39;t drink - except for a round of overpriced shots - we just danced for hours.  The crowd was a little older in the &#39;80s side of the bar, maybe people in their 30s and 40s.  It was perfect for a girl&#39;s night out, when all you want to do is dance awkwardly to great old music."

It&#39;s where folks go when the line to Features is too long, or when they want to grab an empty table. I feel like Club Mamalu has the potential to be a cool swanky spot, but the mood is kind of killed with the TVs, lack of seating (since they got rid of the booths), and overpriced drinks.

That being said, there are definitely some pros which is why they are A-OK in my book.

PROS:
- Live music on Friday nights!
- Super chill atmosphere where you can be guaranteed a seat if you get there before 9:30.
- Friendly service.
- No cover, even when there is a band.
- Decent food (same as Features).

ADDITIONAL CONS:
- $8 for a small vodka tonic.
- Typically hosts an older crowd.

Moral of the story... go for the live music! Or if you want to stay out of the cold :)"

Kinda funny because they are two seperate bars, but once inside you can go in and out of either place. So skip the line at Features and just come here instead...mucho quicker!! The service was meh...the bartender uses the jigger to measure out any hard liquor and makes sures to fill your cup oh with about 90 percent mixer...so don&#39;t waste your money. I thought it was strange that one bottle of bud light cost about 4 bucks, but if you get the 40oz its the same price. 

The music was meh as well...it didn&#39;t pick up till the end of the night. The plus side is there is ample seating. The down side it was sweltering in there! The last time I was in a bar that hot and sweaty with hardly any people ...oh wait never!! Couldn&#39;t they just turn on the A/C??? 

Over all conclusion....not worth the money. If you do go, stick to the Features side."

I just feel that the owners of the 3 bars put the least amount of effort in this one. This place should be on its own and given the attention it deserves. Usually people will go through here to get into Features because people don&#39;t want to wait in Feature&#39;s line. An older crowd tends to hang out here because of the 80s and 90s music. I love that music and they have a great playlist when I go through. It isn&#39;t as loud as Features, so you can actually talk to one another here too. The only problem I see with this place is how small it is. It can be difficult to walk through when people are crowding the bar. Not only that but the dance floor is a bit small and cluttered by the walkway to the bathroom and the door to get into Features. If they had a bigger location I feel this place would be a lot more popular and visited."

It&#39;s own by the same people as Features so not only do they have the same drink specials and pricing and the same staff, but you can go between Club Mamalu and Features as much as you want all night long. The music in here is different that the club like music you tend to hear in Features which is nice. You tend to get more oldies in here. As inside of Features the drinks are good and the price is right. Club mamalu is usually less crowded than features and has more places to sit which is nice as well. Overall if your a fan of the Downtown Naperville scene you could do a lot worse than Club Mamlu and Features."

Decided to give it a try and HOLY CRAP. This place blows all other sandwich places out of the water. Got the Lieutenant and was amazed at not only the quality of meat and bread that they used but also at how delicious it was. They don&#39;t use mayo and mustard like other sandwich places and honestly I don&#39;t think it needed any of that anyway. Just meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato and a little oil to top it all off. If you&#39;re looking for a great sub at a reasonable price you should go in and try them out. I promise you won&#39;t regret it. Customer for life."

The beef was terrible it was small bland and hardly any cheese.  We tried it after reading a great review on it.  Maybe this was an off day but our beef was terrible.  The sub sandwiches and calzones looked really good here.  I may try that next time.

I call back at least three times and get the voicemail.  Wait about 20 minutes and finally she answers with the same crappy attitude.  My one sandwich gets here and my total comes to 8$ and some change,  I give the guy a 20$ and ask for 8$ back which is extremely generous since the place is less than 5 blocks from my house.  And he responds with I only have 6$.  Who delivers and doesn&#39;t keep change?  I just paid 14$ for an 8 inch sandwich.  And the sandwich was good, just not 14$ good."

My garlic bread I got with my dish was burnt one time.  Another time I asked for pizza by the slice and they went to warm it up and left it in too long and burnt the crust.  The pizza sauce and the subs are pretty solid, but the lack of a little TLC for your orders is enough to make me go to Mangia much more often."

I came here expecting 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag Joe Pesci and got Casino De Niro.  I mean wow, just blown away.  You wouldn&#39;t think that this unassuming place (which despite their good effort still looks like a gas station) would have one of the best Italian subs this Yelper has had in quite some time.

I had the underboss, and it did not disappoint.  The sandwich was as perfectly crafted as the Sistine Chapel with the perfect ratio of meat to cheese to toppings to oil to I&#39;m salivating now just thinking about it.  There were a minimum of six other sandwiches that I NEED to try and a few others that caught my interest.  They have hot sandwiches too, not just the awesome deli ones.

There are also some good looking sides/salads.  I had a broccoli pasta salad that was simple yet tasty.  But there were a couple others that looked just as good.  

There were a couple cannolis there, but literally a couple.  Two wrapped together in plastic wrap.  I didn&#39;t get one, but if they have better packaging next time I&#39;m there I won&#39;t be stopped.

The only thing to note of this place is that you have to pull into the right side of the building when you pull into the parking lot.  You can&#39;t park in from and they don&#39;t have it blocked off.  Depending on the time of day it can be a pain to pull around to the other , Proper, side of the building as you can&#39;t pull through.  But that is a minor complaint once you get this food in your face."

Just for a quick bite in between weekend errands. However, I didn&#39;t expect they&#39;d serve instant noodle either. Being a big fan of Japanese ramen, I was excited to see they had ramen special. I asked what&#39;s in the dish and was told some veggies, fish cake, and dumplings. They no longer offer the egg in the soup (which was in the picture on the wall) because of some &#34;allergy issue&#34;. Asked what flavor base and was answered beef. All sounded okay. But when the noodle arrived, it&#39;s easy to tell from the look and smell that it&#39;s instant noodle. Surly it was, after a bite and a sip of the soup. Two mini dumplings were the frozen type you could buy from H-Mart.

My kid got the teriyaki chicken bento box. Chicken was on the tough side. Two fried dumplings were the same kind in my noodle soup. Sushi was not fresh. Even the pickled ginger was not as crunchy as it&#39;s supposed to be.

So disappointed. Basically the same disappointment from a few times I tried H-Mart food court at its different store locations. Wish H-Mart could have better food court choices like Mitsuwa."

For a quick bite, this place is pretty good."

Tasted like it was drowning in the teriyaki sauce. The nigiri was great and I couldn&#39;t get enough of it. The rice was also good along with the California rolls. The meal also came with a small cup of miso soup. it was around 9 dollars and I would say it was worth the price due to the fact I was full until dinner time.

Sushihana is the Japanese restaurant in the food court, and it&#39;s solid. I&#39;ve only had the Katsu box, but it offers a great sampling and even the kids like it! For 9 bones, I get a California roll, two pieces of katsu chicken, some rice, some miso soup, some coleslaw kinda stuff, and two itty bitty baby fried potsticker-type thingies. 

Before you ask....YES, I am very goodly schooled in Japanese cuisine.

The biggest drawback is, of course, the fact that you have to eat it there. That place is gross and dirty, but suck it up. The thingies are worth it."

Since, I wasn&#39;t fine dining at a reputable Sushi restaurant, I wasn&#39;t too up or down in my expectation, but overall, I was pleased to walk away with some raw fish craving for $8.95.  Not bad at all.

I ordered a Japanese-Korean dish called Hwedubbob (Korean Chirashi), which rice topped with fresh greens, sliced Asian pears, fish eggs, generous portions of sashimi, and red spicy sauced called gochoojang.  I was surprised to receive such a big portion for this price and the dish was quite tasty (see pic).

I would recommend Sushihana for grabbing a quick meal or taking out a meal to go after your shopping at HMart!"

As for the food, the fish is pretty good, and the portion size is pretty big for me. There isn&#39;t as much flavor as other hwe dub bap I&#39;ve had before, so I had to put a lot of the red sauce on top."

Madeleine (&#34;Mad&#34;) is an enthusiastic experienced chef and focuses on fresh ingredients. While she has a featured menu (www.Madwhatsfordinner.com) she also has daily specials. We tried the Turkey Cutlets and the Cabernet Beef. The Turkey Cutlets were generous portions of turkey, sweet potatoes, thin stalks of asparagus and a sauce for the cutlets ($11) The Cabernet Beef, marinated chunks of beef (tasting like sauerbraten almost!) came with barley/mushrooms and asparagus ($11). I loved this dish and my hubby loved his turkey cutlets. The dishes quickly reheat in a microwave and are packaged in compostable containers. Some may get two meals out of one dish--but I ate every bit of the Beef! Each dish comes with a dessert of three French madeleines (cookies). 
I would definitely recommend Madeleine&#39;s. Call ahead and order or stop in. Mad is open to suggestions and also does catering. She is definitely an asset to Lisle&#39;s food scene!"

An hour passed before we even saw a waitress, 90 minutes before our drinks were served.
Then our waitress refused to continue serving us when one of our group only ordered soup.
She snipped that there is a minimum $15 purchase per person, something that was not mentioned when the reservation was made OR at anytime while we sat there waiting 90 minutes for someone to take our dinner order. After talking to a manager we were assigned a different waitress and then staff came and tossed flyers on the table that said &#34;we ASK for a minimum purchase of $15 pp.&#34;  Key would there - &#34;ASK&#34;!! 
Our new waitress did ok, especially since she was thrown into a very confusing situation, however at this point it&#39;s two hours in before we received out soup/salad and after they were finally served she came to our table and asked if we had now received everything we ordered to which the entire table replied &#34;uh, no - how about our dinners!&#34;

Both were delicious and nicely presented. She had french onion soup and mine was New England clam chowder serve in a good size bowl rather than a cup.

Tonight a group of five of us ate here. Of the five meals we ordered three had mistakes.  My fiancé ordered the crispy chicken platter and they brought out the fried chicken. The waiter was new and said he rang it in wrong. An honest mistake, normally wouldn&#39;t bat an eye. But it got much much worse. 

Two of us ordered the same burger (the Manhattan royal burger) and both burgers came out missing different toppings. One was missing the mayo and the crispy onions and the other was missing bacon and mayo. When I asked to speak with a manager a young man (the &#34;manager&#34;) came over and told me that crispy onion rings were not supposed to come on my burger and that bacon didn&#39;t come on my friend&#39;s burger. Again, we ordered the same burger. He then rushed off and told us we would get our burgers with whatever we wanted on it soon. One of the burgers came back missing the onion rings again and neither ever ended up with mayo. 

The worst part of it though was when I went and got a menu and showed the manager that the Manhattan Royal burger did in fact come with everything we had asked for he did not apologize, he did not offer any sort of compensation for the mistake and he never came back to our table (I had to track him down to show him his own menu). 

Just so no one gets the wrong idea; they were not busy tonight. In fact most of the rest of the evening I could see the &#34;manager/supervisor&#34; sitting at the bar casually listening to the band.  

Just terrible."

I got the pulled pork sandwich with fries while my friend got the veggie quesdilla. While waiting for food, the waitress brought out two rolls for us to munch on. I enjoyed my pulled pork sandwich and was really stuffed and couldn&#39;t finish my food. My friend enjoyed her quesadilla, too.

It didn&#39;t even dawn on her I was sitting there without anything to drink until my husband brought it to her attention!

Every time she stopped by she was in a huge hurry to leave even though we saw her chatting it up with at least one other table. We still tipped her 15% because we aren&#39;t monsters, but we usually tip 20%. If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d say she didn&#39;t like us (or at least me since she seemed quick to bring whatever my husband wanted). I just got this hostile vibe from her.

The egg/pepper sandwich on their on-line menu doesn&#39;t appear on the actual menu.  

That said, they were extremely accommodating, and there are items you can modify (chicken/portabella panini, hold the chicken, etc.) to easily come up with a couple of other vegetarian options.  I ordered the nachos over a baked potato instead of over corn chips and the waitress didn&#39;t even blink. We had a group of 12-14 people with separate checks, and she was willing to combine some of them so I could use a coupon (which I hadn&#39;t mentioned when ordering), in addition to dealing with my custom nachos and wanting a larger glass for my drink (IBC and Jagermeister - what a good idea!).  She kept everyone&#39;s water glasses filled too.  

The bread/butter (real butter) brought out while you wait is tasty if bland (it&#39;s white bread, nice crust); they&#39;ll bring more if you ask.

I can&#39;t give them more than 3 stars because there&#39;s so little I can eat here, but they have many redeeming features, and if you like steak or pot roast, it&#39;s probably a great place."

We had such a great experience, I wanted to make sure that I reviewed it.  The hostess asked if we wanted to be seated near the TVs because a football game was on.  We said no, so we were seated in a booth up in a quieter area.  Service was excellent.  She was obviously an experienced server.  Our soft drinks were delivered quickly.  I liked the extra large size glasses.  Even with that, our server offered to refill our drinks when our glasses were about half empty.

My husband had the pot roast dinner and I had the pot roast sandwich.  Both meals were delicious.  I especially loved the warm bread with butter that came out with our soup and salad.  We both left stuffed and satisfied.  

We don&#39;t live nearby so it will be a special trip out here but we&#39;ll come back soon."

The lighting and atmosphere in here is perfect. If you are looking for a fancy occasion, or just to go out and have a few drinks I highly recommend it. The Calamari is one of our favorite appetizers it is so good! Last time I was here I ordered the Prime Rib that was on special last Saturday the 9th. It was an amazing melt in your mouth delicious Prime Rib. Her parents also ordered the all you can Eat Ribs and the Scallops and both of those dishes were excellent too. The beer I ordered on draft was two hearted ale and it was really fresh tasting. Every time we are here the Beer is good and the food is top notch for the price you can not beat it. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to get a good meal. If you ever get a chance to Meet Sindy the owner you will see she is a passionate business owner and really cares about her customers that eat there. Also I would recommend asking for Stefanie as a Server We have had her 2 other times while we were here  before and she was on top of our order for us and never let us go with out a drink the Customer Service provided is one of the best you will see. This time we had another server but she also was Exceptional you really can not go wrong with service here. Even sitting at the bar you will find the Bar Tender is really friendly and outgoing."

It&#39;s another place I really wanted to like but just couldn&#39;t.  I like the decide and atmosphere, but the food is really lacking.  It&#39;s not horrible, but it&#39;s so bland.  
I never, ever put salt on anything. This was the first place ever I had to salt my food.  We  had the following:
Saganaki- it was the appetizer they touted as a customer favorite.  I&#39;ve had better, I&#39;ve had worse.  
Mushroom soup- this came with my meal. It was ok. You could almost taste the thickener in it though and really bland.
Chicken Marsala-my dinner.  All in all ok, but the chicken was a little tough, and again.....bland.  It came with frozen green beans that were fine.
The missus had a pot roast sandwich.  It was the smallest thing I ever saw, like kids menu small.  It was dry and you guessed it, full of flavor....no I&#39;m kidding it was bland too.
All in all the bill was something like 66 bucks for 2 meals and 4 drinks (one was pop).  Definitely not worth the price.
I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back for trivia and drinks since we enjoy the place, but we&#39;ll stop and eat somewhere else first."

Our waitress was BEYOND SLOW. I waited a good 10 minutes before I received a to go box that I asked for. Then she proceeded to wait another 15 minutes to give us our check. She forgot my friends drink, but didn&#39;t end up charging for it since it took her so long to bring it, which was nice of her.

While we were waiting for a table we had a drink at the bar.   I noted a few things here: both bartenders took dirty plates from customers and never washed there hands after doing so, both scooped ice using a glass!, both consistently grabbed clean classes from the inside before making someones drinks, one was eating behind the bar while making drinks!,  and they both, after touching their hair and faces grabbed straws and fruit barehanded and put them into drinks! In the time we sat there, about 30 minutes, neither one washed their hands even once!!  Anyone with a basic knowledge on how viruses and bacteria get transferred to customers would know this is a huge no no!  This is a good illness outbreak waiting to happen!  The fish fry was ok but nothing to right home about.  Service was good.  Overall, this place caters to the over 50 grows.  To top it off, I found a fly in my water after drinking half of it! Gross!!

Today I went here for lunch using my Groupon.  A big thumbs up on all the changes from my last visit.  I would have given 5 stars, but our server was a little flighty, forgetting some plates and my salad dressing.  Most of the lunch specials are $6.99!

First of all, the remodel makes the place so much brighter and roomier.  It is very welcoming when you walk in and we were greeted immediately by the owner.  Our server came over pretty quickly after we sat down which is a big improvement over my past experiences.

We had bruschetta for an appetizer and it was GREAT.  The bread was nice and soft, not that rock hard crunchy kind you get and the toppings were very flavorful. 

I had a cobb salad, I know pretty boring.  It was HUGE.  I will be eating the other half for dinner.  Hubby had a prime rib sandwich which he thoroughly enjoyed.  Our server checked in with us frequently to see if we needed more beverages or extra napkins.

I can&#39;t say enough about the HUGE improvement in our dining experience.   Be sure to check out the bruschetta when you are there."

Ordered a burger and a turkey reuben. Both were very good! Lunchtime service was under 10 mins. Host and waitress were very attentive to drinks and such.

The decor inside seemed to be relatively new. I am definitely going to go back and try something new. They have a ton of specials and it seems on the sign outside that they always have some sort of event/all you can eat going on (Not good for the nation&#39;s obesity crisis, but oh well...)

It&#39;s a decent option in the area compared to the full out grease fest you get at VT across the street and the butter burgers next door."

The last 2 times were so-so with food and experience.  A lot of people I know really seem to enjoy this place, and I still haven&#39;t seen why.  So, this LAST time (because I will never return again), my best friend and I decided to give it one more shot.  Though we were seated promptly, it took about 4 minutes for someone to even come and greet us at the table.  After we got our &#34;greeting&#34;,( which she never said Hello, or what her name was..), we decided to order some martini&#39;s.  *sidenote-we were sitting in the bar area*  It then took and I kid you not, 10 MIN to receive our drinks.  TEN MINUTES!!  There was only one other booth filled besides us and 2 gentlemen at the bar.  I think the bartender was too concerned to eat his dinner then to tend to his guests.  Finally receiving our drinks, we put our food order in.  I ordered a filet cooked medium plus, and a garden salad.  My friend ordered a chicken wrap and a cup of soup.  Pretty simple right?  WRONG!!  It took ANOTHER 10 MINUTES to get our soup and salad, and when the soup was delivered, there was some dried food on the spoon.  Now, our waitress didn&#39;t stop back to check on us, so I took it among myself to ask the &#34;oh so busy&#34; bartender for a new spoon.   Of course no apology or anything, just plopped the new spoon on the table and I said politely &#34;thank you so much&#34;, which he proceeded to roll his eyes and walk away.  Now I have my timer on my phone going ( I forgot to mention that earlier), so these times are NOT exaggerated, I restarted my timer after we got our soup and salad.  The time it took to receive our entree...Ready for this...25MIN!!  At this point we are so angry, we didn&#39;t even want to eat, but our bellies were rumbling because we have now been sitting here for about an hour!  Now, of course my filet came out wrong, had to have it re-fired, and the waitress told me the horseradish sauce was my sour cream for the potato, but you know, minor details.  UGH.  I will never understand why everyone loves this place so much.  I don&#39;t get it.  So, unless you are over 50 and look like you have money, you might get treated with respect.  If you are in your 30s trying to enjoy a nice dinner, I might recommend Outback or Olive Garden."

However, I was overwhelmed with exactly what I wanted to write about in terms of a bad Easter Brunch experience.  

First off, the spacial function for this event was UNfunctional.  They had sat our party of 11 in the corner length wise and the hostess let me know that we could separate our table to better get in and out for the buffet.  okay... 
then when our party was complete, we set off to the buffet.  that was a line out the door and around the galley style bar.  Anyone belly up at the bar could not leave, the servers could not access the service bar and I felt very uncomfotable and unsteady with a plate of food I was trying to dish up as we moo&#39;ed thru the line.  They definitely could have come up with a better system.
The line began behind the hostess stand with desserts then filtered on past the bar to 1st up, fried chicken.  
after that was a buffet setting full of eggs.  that looked green.  if there was a green eggs and ham theme, I wouldn&#39;t have known because the carving station was last.  I was relieved when I saw the gal come thru with fresh eggs.  but she dumped them on top of the old eggs.  the same thing happened with the crumbled dry bacon that was dumped on top of old very crumpled very dry bacon.
same thing with the pancakes.  
By the time I finished thru the line I couldn&#39;t help but be green with the thoughts of contamination. I helped myself to 2 pieces of french toast and some 3/4 slice of bacon.  I skipped over the carving station because of the push and pull of the line.  I was hungry and figured perhaps I could go back when the line wasn&#39;t so full. on Easter. prolly wishful thinking on my part.
Right next to our table was a fabulous soup and salad table. thank gawd!  the creamy chicken dumpling soup satisfied and the salad was good.  I even saw the waiter bring more soup in a new pot, not just dump new on top of old.  That was the saving grace.  Thankfully my father in law payed the bill but I still felt as though I should ask for something considering the one piece (2 halves) of french toast that I ate was like crewing on concrete.  I was hoping to pay for soup/salad combo instead of the full buffet price of almost $20.  I would have happily paid and tipped for what I ate... love you Daddy!
We had 2 servers and their service was friendly and fast. Holidays can be a pain for us all.  We decided as a family that next year, perhaps we&#39;ll go out to eat on Easter Saturday instead.  that buffet was no good for anyone.  I should also mention that no one in our party of 11 went back for seconds."

I couldn&#39;t resist adding a saganaki burger to the Great Burger Hunt list.  The saganaki is flamed at the table per the usual ritual.   Unfortunately, the saganaki didn&#39;t add anything to the burger and was just too salty.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I really like saganaki but it just didn&#39;t work on a burger.  Although I ordered the burger medium, it arrived well done (translation - dry).  The fries were Burger King like in that they have that strange coating that makes them crunchy but not very tasty.  Had the fries been better I probably would have been less annoyed that the burger was overcooked.  My gf got a salad that came in an attractive bowl but had such a small base that it almost tipped over everytime she took a bite.  The complimentary bread was very good and the service attentive without being annoying.  We sat in the bar area and noticed plenty of HD tv&#39;s.

I was disappointed in our server - which probably influenced my rating. She was extremely rude from the beginning. When she came up to us - she said &#34;Well, I guess I&#39;m your server.&#34; It was down hill from there.

We sat in the bar area, and there was a man who was loudly dropping the f-bomb in his conversation with his friend - extremely annoying. He did end up leaving when our food came - so that was a relief.

As far as the food (I had the Angel Hair Chicken dinner), it was a very large portion - but had no flavor.  I felt it needed some spices or even a little salt and pepper. 

In general - we had a bad experience with our server and the food was so-so.  We will not be back anytime soon, but I know we should give it another try - it may have just been a bad night."

I am trying to say Manhattan&#39;s general crowd is retirees, but maybe that&#39;s why it is fun.  The people, diners included are very kind and warm people.

The menu is fairly wide in selection, something for pretty much anyone.  I have had a few different dishes across the board and everything is quite good.  The prices are on par with the style, but nothing you&#39;ll be too overwhelmed either way with.

They do have wonderful daily deals however on both food and drink, check their website beforehand and you can get a really good meal at a more than generous price.  They also have great coupons that come in the coupon mailers every week that make for a great weekday retreat.

The remodel is nice, the bar area I think is nicer than the eating area which reminds me a little of a Baker&#39;s Square restaurant.

Service is very attentive, you&#39;ll never have to flag someone down for a refill or napkins.  The young girls serving seem to slack behind the older waitresses, but I see that everywhere and would rather always have the nice older woman than the 20 something girl who thinks she&#39;s hotter than she is.

Honestly, Manhattan&#39;s is a place I really enjoy, and do look forward to going back.  Both the bar and restaurant are nice for a bite or a drink, don&#39;t be afraid to give it a shot."

The shrimp in the shrimp cocktail is flavor-less; the toast in the bruschetta is soggy. Otherwise, the apps were decent. The saganaki app was interesting, but not sure what to eat it on ... we used some of the bread. The bread is awesome -- comes to the table nicely warm and crispy.

The ribeye steak was pretty good, cooked a near-perfect medium-rare. The big salads are really big. Pasta dishes are fair-sized as well, and apparently are pretty decent.

Not sure what people are talking about as far as the senior crowd here ... the group get-together was around 7 PM on a weekday, the 4-top was a Thursday evening, 8 PM or so I think, and on neither occasion did the place seem to be particularly senioritised."

Their corn beef was so tender and their fruit plate is fresh and sweet. Would not go any other place for hambers. Thank you Manhattan!"

Biggest complaint is the odd shaped dinnerware which is hard to eat off.

I&#39;ve noticed service is different if a certain manager is on the floor or not. The soup is always good and the daily specials is a hit or miss. 

The other night I ordered the daily surf and turf special with steak and fried shrimp. Our food was taking FOREVER and when my food finally came out it was a lobster tail instead of shrimp. If I were a fan of lobster I would of kept it. My waitress realized she put the wrong order in and would find out the price difference. Told her that I would just like my shrimp instead. She contacted one of the managers and they told her that since its a $20 price difference. I figured after the long wait for the food and the food coming out wrong, they would of just kept the lobster on the table. They took the lobster back and got my shrimp. I know it was a big price difference but what was gonna happen to it anyway? If they took it back and made the waitress pay for it...i&#39;m not sure I just think that&#39;s just bogus."

The food though was nothing special. I had the baked mostacolli. It was alright. Not good but not bad. The garlic bread had a strange taste to it though, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.

I had a cup of soup as well. The soup was flavorful but had sort of an odds and ends feel to it. All the ingredients were cut in different sizes so it seemed like they just kind dumped extras from the kitchen into a creamy broth.

My lunch actually came with bread served on a board (think Outback). When they brought it out I couldn&#39;t help but smile. It was pretty much a typical small, crusty dinner roll, on a board, with a big serrated knife poked into it. It was cute."

Last night my family decided though to go back and have us give it another try. First thing to note is they are doing a remodel so half the restaurant is closed and the dinning room is very crowded. We got put at a table in the middle and kept getting bumped by the servers as they waited on other tables. I&#39;m not factoring this into my star rating however as I feel this is just because the other half of the restaurant is closed for remodeling. So my reason for going was to get the Saganacki burger... Yes I know it should include a trip to the doctors office or at least a free shock to get my heart going again. While I must admit I never liked the burgers here in the past I found this one to be excellent. My burger was cooked perfectly and had a gregarious portion of Saganacki on top. It was also flamed table side which is always great. Surprisingly the person at the table next to us still had there hair with hot tight the seating was last night :) Over all I enjoyed my dinner and look forward to going back and getting that burger again."

Interior looks great, a lot nicer than I remember. The bar is now separate so dining can be a quiet experience. 
Haven&#39;t been to this restaurant in a few years. Had a coupon on a fundraising card.  Monday night - must be Sr. night.  A wide variety on the menu. Nice waitress, but then comes the plastic water glasses, and plastic plates, and silverware with no spoons - o.k. we are in a Bar/Grill and not a real restaurant.  A wide variety of Beers, and knowledgable staff.   Apparently their weekend entertainment is a big draw to their bar business. I told our waitress my husband was allergic to onions, we ordered appetizer of stuffed asigo mushrooms, and the chopped onions on top were easily removed.  Very tasty. His soup arrived - chicken tortilla and it had onions in it. He told the waitress, she came back and instead of bringing the asparagas cream soup she let us know she talked to the chef and onions are in that too, so she gave him a salad instead - good on her part.  He ordered a chicken pasta dish, no onions, and I ordered the Filet Marsala medium rare. I should of stuck wit Bar/Grill food... my mistake.   The dish was very tasty but not marsala, it was a generic brown gravy sause with mushrooms.  The meat was tender and cooked to order.  The sauted veggie mix was too oily for my tastes.  His chicken dish was excellent and brought some home because of the large portion.  I did not want potato so I asked for pasta instead. She brought a side of fettichini alfredo. It was FANTASTIC - the best part of the meal - creamy, no garlic, just wonderful!  Ashley was attentive, quick with refills, checking that all was o.k. but not rushed or hovering.  The place was clean, but could use the spring cleaning to get the edges of carpet dust against the pillars that the vacumn obviously doesn&#39;t pick up.  Overall a nice place with good service and good food, reasonable in price for todays market. Stick with the sandwiches and specials."

If you live in the Western burbs, watch that crappy &#34;Mr. Coupon&#34; packet, Manhattan&#39;s (not Manhatten, spelled incorrectly above) puts out a buy one/get one so you can try it on the cheap.  

Be kind; take your extra coupons with you and leave them about.

Did try the saganaki squares, but was not overly impressed...I&#39;m just used to flaming saganaki so I have overly high standards. Some people may love these, I&#39;m just spoiled. They do taste good, but I like my cheese more melted, that&#39;s all.

Only difference is I got the combo and the Italian sausage was the only thing that saved the homemade beef to add any flavor.  I hadn&#39;t eaten here since the 70&#39;s.  I think going away from Scala&#39;s beef was a way to control food cost but it just doesn&#39;t taste how I remember it.

Food both fries and combo came out SUPER hot so little chance of any foodborne illness here.  I wanted to try the saganaki squares but wasn&#39;t that hungry.  Plus an abundance of salt on fries kept me from eating many as my sodium levels probably went through the roof.  The air conditioning is clearly failing as it was over 80 degrees inside on a 89 degree day.

Very nice people here and I want to like them more.  At least they are getting an award from Vienna next week.  Maybe I should have just gotten a dog.

It&#39;s not much, but it helps. I was in and out in 10 minutes which is also good. I was anxious to see what the good reviews were about. The gyros was very good! Seasoned just right and not a lot of salt. It&#39;s rare that you find a gyros that&#39;s not salty. They used more seasonings and less salt. Very good and very smart move!

I was on my way home from visiting a friend and decided to stop here for lunch. It looked like a cool, divey burger joint and I thought there was no way the food could be bad. I was actually pretty excited. Perhaps my excitement is why this place is only getting three stars. It just didn&#39;t live up to my expectations. I got the burger and looked furiously for the burger. It wasn&#39;t easily seen and there was supposed to be 2 patties. When I bit in I was relieved to find they in fact did NOT forget my patty, but honestly it wasn&#39;t all that impressive. It was mostly just a big hunk of lettuce with mustard and ketchup and I&#39;ve had a million better burgers at little burger joints like this. While I don&#39;t expect them to be Portillos, I do expect to be satisfied after ingesting those calories and I was not. The fries were tasty, but the burger is supposed to be the main attraction. 
The ambiance was pretty nice. The counter area was a little chaotic but the dining area was spacious and had tvs on the wall you could watch. Outside was very pretty with umbrellas and well kept trees. The staff was also pleasant, although I didn&#39;t have much interaction with them so I don&#39;t know how they would act given a problem, but still, I like a smile when I walk up to the counter and they delivered.

I needed a &#34;Bib&#34; for this one. A lot of gravy ended up on my sweatshirt.

The sandwich itself was a hefty representation by volume, however the gravy was the epitome of mediocrity. 

In my opinion, the gravy has no flavor. A 3 star rating is generous."

In Chicago (back in the black and white days) I would get my food and sit on the curb in between two parked cars. This is a pretty big upgrade.

Good beefs. I ordered mine with hot and Lisa&#39;s with hot and sweet.. also a couple of orders of fries. When I say good, I mean they taste good, but unlike Portillos.. they actually fill the bun with meat.  This is not my first rodeo at Flips so I&#39;ve got some familiarity with the food. They forgot to put the hot peppers on Lisa&#39;s beef, she was a little disappointed, but I was already home. They have OK fries.. kind of your standard frozen fries, cooked crispy.

I&#39;ve never tried their Gyros and thought their burgers were good, but not special.

I don&#39;t know what it is about that sign that flippin bugs the crap out of me. They&#39;ve selectively covered over a part of the sign on Roosevelt... I dont know if used to say &#34;Scala&#39;s&#34; Beef.. or what. And if they used to use Scala... now what?**

Also.. it&#39;s tight when you get in the door.. the order window is right there and there is little space for a line.

Pretty good menu selection and I really need to go back and try other things.

They currently have a Yelp check in offer.. and I also get coupons from various locations.

I would really give a solid 3.5 stars, but I&#39;m going to try some other things and see if that won&#39;t edge up a bit.

** The owner/Manager messaged me.. they used to use Scala beef, but went to making their own.. Having had it it I can say &#34;Good Job&#34; and please keep filling those sandwiches full like you do."

The sandwiches were home made with similarly sliced cold cuts. The cold cut was a bit messy which to me indicates a well made sandwich haha imagine the meat and sauce and things exploding under the bread. Not too much but definelty a bit messy. It was plentiful and good.

I ordered the Ruben which came on not rye bread but that was ok. There was a ton of meat on the sandwich and the thousand island was nice n sweet but not over the top. The kraut was perfect. A great sandwich. The saganaki squares are also great! The owner said they&#39;re homemade.

On my very first day on Yelp I put up a whole bunch of reviews from collected notes of visiting hot dog stands throughout Chicagoland. One of them was Flips Beef &amp; Hot Dogs in Glen Ellyn. Since I put up that initial review the way I&#39;ve been writing has changed, and I figured this would be a good place to revisit and see if the food quality had improved since my first review and to provide a more in depth analysis of the food.

First off let me go over the establishment itself, Flips is a small little restaurant with a few tables set up on the inside. There are a few TVs so customers can watch ESPN while eating, and for when the weather is nice some outside tables with umbrellas. There&#39;s also a ledge with stools set up to eat at right across from the main order counter. The main order counter is where you can see the menu board, and place your order, and even see your food prepared if you&#39;re so inclined. In visiting Flips again I decided to go for a hot dog and fries.  

The hot dog I received on my most recent visit came on a somewhat dry non-poppy seed bun. There was a pickle spear on it that was fairly thick though not particularly sour. There were two somewhat wet and mushy tomato slices on the dog along with two sport peppers that combined in length were not long enough to cover the entire hot dog itself. This meant that I didn&#39;t get sport pepper flavor in every bite. There was a decent amount of mustard on this dog, the onion and relish were a little light. The sausage itself was a skinless frank, it was well heated. The overall taste was decent but the bun was dry and the tomato and pickle flavor really overpowered the rest of the balanced. I wound up having to take those two items off to finish the second half of the dog. 

I also decided to go for some fries here, they have thick and greasy fries. On the positive side, they&#39;re very crisp on the outside with a nice potato paste inside. On the negative side they are super salty and greasy. Ketchup almost has to be used to sweeten up the incredibly potency of the salting of these fries. 

Overall my experience with Flip&#39;s left me feeling it&#39;s still slightly below average. The time to get my food was more than one might expect, and the food was a little below average. I&#39;ve had some other items here over the years such as burgers, gyros and chicken sandwiches, but I haven&#39;t had them recently enough to detail my experience properly to incorporate into this review. I&#39;m going to stick with my original rating of two stars, but it&#39;s possible a second updated review may come along at some point touching on the gyros, subs or something else there."

In 1997 the burger, gyros, hot dogs and other stuff were all very good. From 2002-2004 they were still very good, in 2011 the gyros salad and plate were still great as well, but the burger was no longer good, nor was the hot dog or the beef. 

That being said, when I was there last year in November the service had really gone down hill along with the rudeness of the cashier and the cleanliness of the place. The bathroom was out of toilet paper and there was leaking water in there, the table that I sat at, had not been cleaned under-neath the table, there were fries, relish, and pickle under-neath the table and the top was sticky from who sat that before, yes they have surveillance cameras in the restaurant but the person who does the cleaning was not paying attention to the inside of the restaurant or to the bathroom, It was the middle of the afternoon and there were no orders ahead of me and it took way to long for a gyros, the person at the table next to me said his hot dog was not good and that his wife hated her burger and they will not be coming back. 

I ordered a gyros with fries, the gyros was dried out, the pita bread was stale, the fries were over-cooked on the outside, and very mushy on the inside, greasy and way too salty, I will not be coming back here and I will stick to eating my gyros at Jester&#39;s in Elgin whose quality has not diminished over time."

First time I got a combo, and didn&#39;t like their sausage.  It just didn&#39;t taste good.  The spice just threw off the flavor, and the meat was dull.  It just wasn&#39;t anything spectacular. 

Then I came back for just a beef.  That was good.  Not great, but good. 

I would have been fine never coming back, but I was in the area and had a craving for crappy fast food.  Got a chili cheese dog and a gyro.  Had to go get gas, so it just sat there in the bag, in my car.  Baking in the hot sun, that crappy food smell just radiating.  You get that fake cheese sauce smell, mixing with that chilli, with that spiced gyro meat.  It was heavenly.  

And then I actually ate it.  Not the worst hot dog I&#39;ve ever had, but for sure in the bottom third.  The gyro was equally bad.  

It&#39;s a independent fast food joint with burgers and combos and gyros and hot dogs.  The service is awesome, the place is clean, the bathrooms are pristine.  I just hate the food."

The beef  is definitely not a hidden gem like someone else said, but a little above average.  Not even close to being as good as Johhnie&#39;s, Portillo&#39;s, or Mr. Beef.  I guess some people can&#39;t tell the difference between a good Italian Beef sandwich and a great/amazing one, or they own the place and are lying to get business.  I might be back to try other items on the menu, but I&#39;m not in a hurry.  I hope I just forget about this place.  The Gyro sounds good from reviews, but the beef sounded great in many reviews also.

There are 2 different listings for this business.  I think the other listing has more accurate reviews.  This listing has too many people commenting on how good the Italian Beef is.  The other listing talks mainly about the Gyro&#39;s.  I&#39;ll try the Gyro someday.

My Top 5 Italian Beef Sandwiches:

1.  Mr. Beef &amp; Pizza (Harlem and Irving)

2.  Mr. Beef (Orleans Street in downtown Chicago, not related to Mr. Beef &amp; Pizza from my knowledge.) 

3.  Johnnie&#39;s (Elmwood park, Arlington Heights)  

4.  Portillo&#39;s (Great flavor, but I don&#39;t like the aftertaste, something about it, has slowly been making it&#39;s way down my list)

5.  Al&#39;s Beef (It keeps growing on me every time I have it.  I did not like it the first time because it was different.)

Consolation Prizes:  These places all have above average beef sandwiches in my mind.  I will list as many as I can remember.

I&#39;m sure it&#39;s undergone a couple of ownerships (at least one) since then.  To date, my favorite gyros, other places skimp on meat (in a Gyro sandwich).  This place&#39;s sandwich is more like a Gyro plate as one needs to fork out some meat before one can consume it in sandwich form.  Although maybe it&#39;s just for those who consume it onsite, have never gotten it to-go.

Have not had any of their other offerings since the early 90&#39;s, but the stuff still looks great."

Their service is pretty fast (even during peak times) and the staff is VERY friendly. They normally have ESPN on TV while you wait (nice touch I&#39;d say). Food is very good as it relates to fast food. While it is small, it&#39;s also clean. Parking can also be at a premium during peak times. This is another place I&#39;ve heard students (college) speak well of so that&#39;s another good sign. 

1. The place is pretty small so things can get tight during peak (lunch &amp; dinner). 

2. As far as the eats:
a. Cheeseburgers are very good. One thing that gets me is when places put more lettuce  on the burger than meat. That&#39;s not the case here. Made fresh and fast.
b. While not one of my top gyros, it&#39;s still very good. On some of my recent visits, I noticed that people put the sauce on the side. Not a deal breaker but worth noting. 
c. SOLID patty melt (I&#39;m a bit fan of grilled onions on my burger). 
d. I had the roast beef sub once and I may want to try it again. When I&#39;ve gone here, I&#39;ve been in the mood for a hot sandwich. I liked it. 
e. The beef sandwich is a hidden gem. 

3. One minor complaint (and it&#39;s minor). One trend I&#39;ve noticed is that places are going the McDonald&#39;s meals route of #1, #2, etc. Flips does the same things. As a rule of thumb, I don&#39;t eat fries often (I try to limit my high glycemic food intake). If you take the fries out, I want to say the price drops about $.50. Not much of a drop pricewise. 

All and all, stop and enjoy a meal. If you&#39;re not looking for it, you just might miss it. Burger rating: Monster."

Flip&#39;s looks like your typical divey burger and gyro joint, but they were pretty damn good. The outside decor is kinda fun and offbeat: they had sculptures of lions and deer on the outside with really funk and mismatched patio furniture, which I thought was fun. The inside has a long counter you can eat at and a few tables, but it really is a small joint, so don&#39;t expect to find seating for a huge crowd.

Tonight was the first night that my boyfriend and I had ever been there: I got the polish sausage meal and he got the italian combo. I loved my meal, although it was little on the charred side. My boyfriend;s combo had a nice spice to it, but it was a little overpowering. The fries were pretty good too.

The lady who rang us up was a total sweetheart: she was very nice and polite. The cooking line amazed me with how fast they got us our food and seemed like nice enough guys. 

The place is a stone&#39;s throw away from College of Dupage, so it seemed like a good place to grab a bite to eat for kids on campus. Wish I had known about it while I was in attendance..."

Nothing personal about them, but their large menu isn&#39;t very extensive. Well, that depends on what you want. If you want 6 different variations of hot dogs or hamburgers, then fine. They didn&#39;t have a single patty hamburger, or a crispy chicken sandwich. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich, and it was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before. I did like the spicy option, and the sauce was very good, but the chicken itself was gyro style. It was chopped up in slivers and served on a bun, and I&#39;m not sure how I feel about that. Their chocolate shakes are pretty gross. Very little chocolate, and I&#39;m pretty sure I took a lot of wax from my mouth while drinking the shake. It had an abundance of waxy chunks.

Flip&#39;s is basically just your average Chicago style hot dog stand. I&#39;m a connoisseur of Italian beefs, and I like to try up different spots.

The fries were pretty decent, but I don&#39;t come for the fries. 

I&#39;d still give Flip&#39;s a shot in the future, but I&#39;m gonna give it a 2/5 simply because the beef was so tasteless, I&#39;d rather get a pre-packaged, oven roasted beef sandwich from Rosati&#39;s.

The sushi here is pretty great. I&#39;ve been to Koi 5 or 6 times and never gotten a bad piece of fish or a dud entree.

It&#39;s not the best in the suburbs but it&#39;s very good.
There are some truly bad chinese places in the suburbs and Koi definitely is NOT one of them.

So, the food is good. They do a solid curry, a great Thai basil, and all of the staples are solid. You can tell that they are more Japanese-based when you order an egg roll and instead of the mini burrito that most places serve you get tiny little egg rolls in a fantastic, crispy shell. 

The big thing I like about Koi is that the owner and cook seem to really take pride in their work. I&#39;ve gotten take out and dined in several times and every time have gotten great service."

Coming from Naperville, it&#39;s comparable to places like Sakura, Raku, and Tanaka Sushi.  Middle-tier sushi is middle-tier sushi, so it won&#39;t blow you away in terms of its taste, but the quality is still quite good. My friend and I ordered the White Dragon, Unagi, and salmon rolls.

Service was good and our order came fast.  Probably won&#39;t come this far again for sushi (about 30 min drive) but was a worthwhile experience to say the least."

Don&#39;t drive too fast on Gary Avenue, just south of the intersection with Geneva Road. There have been multiple failed establishments at this location (which I never tried), but hopefully this one sticks around.

They are located in a very small strip mall with a dog grooming business. The restaurant is not too big, but I was surprised how far the building went to the back; they could fit multiple big parties if need be.

Anyways, we were greeted and seated promptly. Of course, sushi is a big part of the menu, but they have other Thai and Chinese dishes as well.

My mom and I opted for their lunch specials. She ordered the Salmon Teriyaki Bento Box for $9.00 dollars. It came with the glazed salmon, white rice, house salad, miso soup, and two California rolls.

I went with the Chinese Chicken and Broccoli lunch special, which was served with white rice and miso soup. I added a house salad for an additional $2.00 dollar charge (Lunch special was $6.45).

My chicken and broccoli was cooked in a sweet brown sauce with carrots. It was very good. The miso soup was my favorite part of my meal. It had seaweed, tofu, and scallions. So tasty! Best miso I&#39;ve had at an Asian restaurant. My house salad featured lettuce, tomato, and cucumbers. The salad itself was nothing special but the ginger dressing (no doubt homemade) was excellent.

My mom offered me her sautéed onions (which were under her salmon) and those were superb as well. She didn&#39;t eat the white rice (I ate mine; hard to mess up white rice but I&#39;ll say it was great). She agreed with me that the dressing was awesome, too.

Most importantly, I took a big step in my life today. I, at age 26, had my first (and second) sushi roll! The California roll was awesome; white rice around seaweed, cucumber, avocado, and crab meat. I don&#39;t really do seafood but this place may have turned the tides for me! I eat shrimp on occasion but this was like Neil Armstrong&#39;s giant leap for mankind.

I would highly recommend coming here for a nice quiet lunch or dinner. I thoroughly enjoyed my expereicne and have nothing negative to note. GO TO KOI&#39;S!"

Safe to say that I hope this restaurant actually sticks around.

For those not familiar with this particular spot, it has been the location of an American grill named after a certain wizard from Lord of the Rings, and a short-lived Vietnamese restaurant. In an attempt to compensate for the fact that no one lives within walking distance of here, Koi Sushi &amp; Grill serves a variety of Chinese, Japanese and Thai dishes, thus fully earning the &#34;Asian Fusion&#34; category label.

I kicked things off with a couple of appetizers; gyoza (pan-fried dumplings) and the ringer, agedashi tofu. The gyoza was good (I should have gotten two orders of 6 each) and on the smallish side. The tofu was everything I hoped it would be; somewhat firm but hot, so kind of melty, with a crispy panko coating on the outside, served with some sort of a sweet fish sauce. This also came in a group of six, and I ate three, because the whiter members of my family don&#39;t have an appreciation for tofu. 

But I digress. The main keeper for me was the Crunchy 2 in 1, which is a terrible name for an awesome signature roll. Basically, take salmon, shallow fry it in panko, wrap it with avocado and crab meat, and put more crunchy things on top. (I guess I can&#39;t think of a better name for it either.) The fish was fresh, and I was sold from there on out.

I had bits and pieces of sesame chicken, which was quite crunchy and very good.

So look. This place is still easy to drive by, but from what I had, it&#39;s a great place to have an Asian-inspired meal. At $70 (tip included!) for 6 people, it&#39;s criminally cheap, too."

Tried gyoza, pork shumai and tempura rock shrimp. All were tasty but the tempura rock shrimp stood out!  

Had some yellowtail and salmon sushi....very fresh and would say this was a great start.  Everything tasted good at this point and I was feeling like yes! I have found a little gem in my neighborhood! 

We had several rolls...some were sushi rolls, tempura lobster rolls...the point is, all the flavors were fresh and unique.

We came early, no one was there at 6pm, but by 7pm on a Sunday most of the tables were filled (30% off ALL sushi Sunday!) and there were 3 people waiting for their to go orders. The place is nice inside despite it&#39;s meager exterior, clean and simple decor. Not a lot of seating but guessing most of the customers do carryout anyway. 

The sushi was good, above average, weighted more toward the spicy side for their signature rolls, of which there are many similarities between several signature rolls. We had the fujiyama (hubby liked, I thought it was just OK), the NY roll (very good), Philly (very good), Golden Dragon (excellent), California Roll (son enjoyed). Everything was beautifully plated - my sister said Gordon Ramsey would compliment them on presentation! As for the entrees - I heard the Lo Mein was very good, and the broccoli beef was fine (but this is coming from a super picky eater). The side of veggie fried rice was a little burnt and arrived at the table quite a bit after the entree it was to be eaten with was served. The chicken fried rice was good, a little soft for fried rice but thankfully not salty. But see below - there was probably a good reason for some of the entrees not being up to standards. 

Our server/cook was the owner, who was super generous, extremely hardworking, and eager to please. He was very apologetic when he made a chicken broccoli instead of the beef. We felt bad because his cook went home sick and he was also down the only server/bus boy in the place. Glad the sushi chef was well! So the owner had to do everything, and in rushing, one of the entree orders was screwed up and the entrees took a while since he was the only one doing the cooking, so one half of the table just started to eat while the rest of us who ordered sushi were almost done. He let us keep the chicken entree and didn&#39;t charge us for dessert. Because he was so busy, we ate our dessert while the used dinner plates were still on the table, which under any other circumstances I would not be a huge fan.  We also had to get up and find our own &#34;to go&#34; containers, and some members were a little put off when a can of Coke was placed on the table, instead of it being served fountain style. If you don&#39;t mind a little &#39;self-service&#39; on occasion, which generally was not a huge problem for us, then it&#39;s fine.

If we lived closer or happened to be out and about, we might try this place again, for now our routine carryout sushi place is just as good and same in price. We like the owner a lot and hope this place does well for him, and hope he gets consistent or back up staff to help him out. I recommend you try it out for yourself, hopefully half the staff won&#39;t be out that day...!"

We wanted a small sample of the sushi fare and ordered:
Miso soup
House salad with ginger dressing
Avocado roll
Philadelphia roll
Eel Avocado roll

(Yes, we love avocado!)

Miso soup tasted watered down--definitely don&#39;t recommend it. House salad was good, not great, but worth ordering if it doesn&#39;t already come with your meal and you want your typical ginger dressing.

The avocado roll and Philadelphia roll were truly delicious, melt-in-your-mouth sushi--which is exactly what we had been hoping for. The chunks in the sushi were large and you could definitely taste all the flavors. 

The Eel avocado roll was pretty disappointing though. Even more so because I LOVE eel! The flavor was non-existent, even though the piece was large and it came topped with eel sauce. Bummer. So much for the super amazing sushi...

So overall, the food was just ok. I feel like it was pretty hit-or-miss... especially for the price. Their basic rolls were an average of $6. For that much per roll, I&#39;d expect consistency on the basics.

We did think it was good enough to come back for the specials though. 30% off rolls on Sundays, and their Lunch Specials had more selection than most for the sushi: $11 for 3 rolls of your choice from a list of about 10-12. (Most places pre-pick the 3 for you and usually always include a California roll.)

No real thoughts on the service. We were pretty much the only ones there and the server was attentive. Can&#39;t ask for much on a dead weekday I suppose."

- Sushi was 5 star worthy no doubt. Some people in my party tried classic Chinese dishes and reports were great all around.

- Staff was helpful, quick, and very polite. The chef came to the table and spoke with us to ask how the food was.

- Prices were reasonable.

- Interior and decor was quaint and peaceful, nice relaxing music.

I had Mongolian chicken and the crab Rangoon. Both were well seasoned and very good. They packaged all the food items separately, instead of putting everything in one box. I do not car for sushi, but there was a small but nice sushi bar with the chef waiting behind it to make everything fresh.
You can tell the owner takes pride in his food as everything seems to be fresh and hot. 
It is a small place so you can miss it easily, but I  would recommend stopping in because in my opinion it is one of the better places in the area."

I agree with other Yelpers location is a little odd and decor nothing fancy. But the food and service were great. The owner came by often.. We were the only ones there at odd time right before the Bears game was over. Had no idea rolls were 30% off on Sunday until we got the bill.  Yellowtail jalapeño appetizer was fresh and beautifully presented with seaweed on top. We also had house salad for only $2.. Been to many places where they charge much more. Ginger dressing great. Only needed two rolls the volcano was huge warm and tasty . Mexican roll was good too. Wish we lived closer. Would be back often.

The sushi is consistently extremely good quality and the rolls are inventive as well as flavorful. Our favorites include the KOI special roll, NY roll and  the Golden dragon which was outstanding, as well as the classic spicy tuna which is one of my favorites here. Nigiri sushi contains generous portions of fish and outstanding flavor and quality. Oh I cant leave out the amazing appetizers such as Tuna jalapeno and Spicy tuna bowl- they are AMAZING. We always come back here and the best part is that its BYOB!!! So go try it out and bring your favorite wine...Its worth the trip!"

1. Soup
2. Maki roll
3. Lunch entree

Look, I can put away some food, and even I couldn&#39;t finish my meal. The miso soup was excellent; the spider roll maki I had with my meal had EXCELLENT texture--lettuce and cucumber gave it an extra bit of crunch, and it was a generous sized roll; the sesame chicken I had as my entree was HUGE and also very good. My partner had the hot braised chicken, which he liked--it was a lot like an orange chicken (very citrus-y). 

We came for lunch on a Thursday and were seated immediately; for busier times you&#39;d probably want to make a reservation. 

I&#39;m looking forward to coming back for dinner and doing a thorough assessment of their sushi selection. And also for their prix-fixe lunch. And also to try more of their entrees. OK, look, I&#39;m just going to come back a lot. 

(Also, I hope they don&#39;t ONLY deliver in Evanston, because I&#39;ve been looking for a good Chinese delivery place and if I could get Koi to my far north Chicago apartment I&#39;m pretty sure my take-out/delivery menu collection would be complete...)"

This place is only 3 weeks old (as of 1/31) and not to be confused with the previous establishment of the same address that closed down some time ago. 

Chris (manager?) and Jason (Sushi chef) were very polite and the food was beautiful and delicious. They take great pride in their work, and offered to make both on and off-menu Chinese and Thai selections if desired (and available).  

We had three sushi rolls (spicy yellowtail, 2x tempura) as a light dinner and they threw in a house specialty salad concoction for free. The salad was unusual, long, thinly sliced, crunchy veggies, plus thinly sliced red snapper and some sort of yellow sauce. Everything was absolutely delicious. 

Service was excellent, and the tiny location was very non-threatening. No need to dress up, but they are very professional and happy to serve. Sometimes you can tell when restauranteurs truly appreciate their customers - these guys do.
 
We will definitely go back, and highly recommend for excellent, reasonable, casual Japanese / Sushi."

The sushi was not fresh and the hot dishes were drowning in sauce but lacking in flavor. Also, overpriced for quality and portion size.

Great lunch specials with a lot to choose from that are reasonably priced. We&#39;ve done carry out and dine in. Lunch specials are 6 piece rolls instead of the standard 4 pieces and come with miso soup AND salad. Everything I&#39;ve tried I&#39;ve liked. Please give it a try.

Altho we do not prefer to eat at a American Chinese restaurant, since we are in Naperville this will do!  I say American Chinese Restaurant cause szechuan chicken, orange chicken or fried rice or egg roll are not exactly real chinese food lol

However, they do offer several very limited plates that is more chinese style so we been ordering them"

Smart-mouthed waiter. So, we went to the Chinese Kitchen when we were pinched for time before my brother&#39;s evening graduation. We didn&#39;t have time to explore options in the area and this restaurant was across the street from the graduation. We were greeted and seated immediately, which was great since we were in a rush. The menu had the standard options, which for us was good since we know what we like to eat at Chinese spots. Ordered shortly after we sat down and the food was prepared in under 10 minutes. We were all pleasantly surprised by the large portion sizes and low prices. Then the food was actually really good. The only down side was that the waiter had a smart mouth! For example, I asked for to-go containers, but also needed smaller ones for the sauce. The waiter didn&#39;t really acknowledge my request, but ultimately brought back the large to-go containers. So I told him I also needed smaller ones for the sauce and he said &#34;I know...I only have two hands!&#34; Really?! Then he had a few other smart comments that I would have preferred he kept to himself. But, overall, I&#39;d definitely recommend it. The egg foo young I bought came with two patties, soup, and an egg roll - for only $8.50 which included tax and shrimp fried rice (vs. plan white or fried rice)! If the waiter would have kept the smart comments to himself, this would have received 5 stars. Keep in mind that this is fast food, not an upscale place like PF Chang&#39;s though. So I&#39;m rating it based on it being fast food, not gourmet."

For under $7/8 you can get tea, hot soup, a delicious meal, and an egg roll. I can&#39;t remember the last time I got dinner here, or take out, so this 5 star review is specifically for sit-down lunch.

1) People think I&#39;m crazy (especially my parents), but this is the BEST hot and sour soup I have EVER had. Sprinkle in some white pepper for an added kick, and it makes it even better. I don&#39;t know why I like this soup so much, but I can drink a tub of it (and I have...haha). My mom enjoys the egg drop soup. 

2) Substitute for veggie fried rice! The veggie rice has green peppers, snap/sugar peas, bean sprouts and egg.

***3) If you are an eggplant fanatic, or like eggplant the slightest bit- you NEED to try the egg plant &amp; garlic sauce- BUT make sure you tell them LIGHT on the garlic sauce (if you don&#39;t there will be just way too much sauce on the egg plant, it will be too salty, and the sauce masks the eggplant). I have been getting eggplant with garlic sauce for the past 6 years ever since I switched from the orange chicken.

Orange chicken is also really good (though it can be a hit or miss on how crispy it is) &amp; Singapore lo mein is great (sometimes it can be a tad dry and other times will be perfectly steamy).

You just can&#39;t beat the price for all of the delicious food you get, and I always save my leftovers for dinner!"

Favorite things to order: Egg Foo Yung, Mongolian Beef, Beef w/ Tomato and Egg, General Tso&#39;s Chicken, and Beef and Green Pepper Chow-Fun.

Drove past this little strip mall and saw the huge Chinese Kitchen sign so decided to try it one day. Small place, tables are right next to each other. Like literally, I could have turned around and ate off of the table behind me.

The staff was nice, however our waitress didn&#39;t really speak english too well so it was a little hard to order or to ask for refills. And she never really refilled my water and barely asked if we needed anything. The people I went with got cokes and they still sell cans of cokes and give you ice. I mean it&#39;s 2011, get a contract with Coke or Pepsi. 2 bucks for a can of pop is just ridiculous.

Food was alright. I&#39;ve had better and worse. Pretty big portion for the lunch special. Though this &#34;special&#34; is still 8-9 dollars and is just meat, rice, soup, and eggroll. So I guess that means that it&#39;s a little bit regularly overpriced."

I noticed it is being managed by new people, as I never see the old couple working there anymore. The old couple was always so welcoming and sweet. The new people are average.

On another note, I hope the new owners are thinking about updating the dining area. I don&#39;t mind the lilac colored walls, but I think they could renovate the walls and seating to look less boring and more cared for. The understated look is fine, just find a way to spice it up a little."

Fast, unpretentious, modestly priced, clean, courteous, straight forward, little Chinese restaurant that serves very tasty food in portions large enough to fill you up.

Excellent value in a simple setting.

If you are looking for high cuisine, this isn&#39;t it.

If you want a very tasty good meal fast for dine in or carry out, you have arrived.

Strong Recommendation"

Chinese Kitchen is the place for fresh flavorful chinese. We are always seated promptly, the food is always piping hot and the service top notch. The cool thing is that you are always sure to see a friend or two in here. In a town of 140,000 that&#39;s pretty cool.

The decor is dated and the mood a bit old fashioned, but they actually know how to make a rusty nail! Really! I love that we get almond cookies and fortune cookies for desert and the always serve enough to feed you and 2 other people.

We  get the cantoneses chicken lo mein. Fresh and tasty every time.

If you are looking for the bomb in good old &#34;american&#34; chinese, stop in!"

 Haven&#39;t had a thing that I didn&#39;t like, the tea is great, at the end of the meal they give you almond cookies. Yum. They also have rice candy that you can buy, yum!

I have no idea why.

I&#39;m not a Chinese food snob.   I&#39;ve been known to enjoy Panda Express.  I was even reasonably excited when I realized that it was an old school americanized chinese place.   It reminded me of the chinese place we would go to when I was a kid.  It even had a Pu Pu Platter!   We had to get it.

The pot of tea was great, just like I remembered from when I was a kid.  

Then, the hot and sour soup arrived.  Um.  Okay, sure, it wasn&#39;t spicy, but I&#39;m sure that the soup I had has a kid wasn&#39;t spicy.  The meat in the soup was tender.  It wasn&#39;t too salty.   So, okay, I could deal.

The pu pu platter arrived.  Yay!  It had the little grill, and it had tons of stuff on it, including shrimp and shrimp toast!  Yay!  I love shrimp and shrimp toast.

First, I had the shrimp.  Perhaps a bit greasy, and the shrimp was tough.  But, the shrimp toast looked good!  I took a bite, and almost spit it out.  The smell of old shrimp was really really strong.  I don&#39;t think the shrimp was actually bad, but it was definitely well on the way.

I was over the pu pu platter by then, but my husband convinced me to try the crab rangoon.  Now, that was good.  It was creamy, and oniony with just a bit of crab.  I could have gone with less wrapper.

Then, our entrees came.  Now, I love Mongolian Beef.  I don&#39;t get it often, but I was looking forward to it.  Which meant I was very disappointed when it turned out that this was a big pile of mystery meat covered in a weird sweet and salty sauce.  There were few green onions, and the ones that were there were overcooked.

My husband had Szechwan Chicken.  The menu did say it was spicy, and I was happy to taste a smidge of heat on it.  But the chicken was vastly overcooked, and it mainly tasted of pineapple and salt.

The service was fine, and the place was busy, full of folks who did seem to enjoy their food.  So, there is a place for this restaurant in Naperville.  I just won&#39;t be in it."

Hot food was Hot and Cold food was Cold.

Wonton soup was above average.

And then, several years ago, I spied a bin of raw meat sitting on the kitchen floor, as someone was passing through the kitchen to counter door.  Obviously, I was intensely grossed out, so I stopped going.  Last Saturday, my wife, daughter, and I were at Naperville Motor Sports-just down the road- and we decided to give the old haunt a try.  We ordered Singapore fried rice noodle, Chicken Lo-Mein, Chicken fried rice, Pot Sticker, Egg roll, Chicken War mein.  On the positive side, I will say this: The food is fresh, with lots of chicken and vegetables, and the pot stickers are very good. The staff is friendly and efficient (my food was ready in exactly 15 minutes, just as the lady said it would be).  The prices are O.K.

On the negative side, I offer the following:
BLAND-I don&#39;t know if they eliminated all use of MSG, or if the cook needs a crash course on the use of seasonings, but everything was under-seasoned to the point of being highly forgettable.
The egg rolls consist mostly of shredded, unrecognizable vegetable matter-I&#39;ve had much better.
And the prices are O.K. $38 for the aforementioned array of entrees and accoutrement."

My first thought was this place is a little gross. The water glasses had that greasy look like the water in the dishwasher hasn&#39;t been changed in months. Also, being a waiter in a former life, I noticed the sidework hadn&#39;t been done...ever. For instance, the vinegar bottle, and salt and pepper shaker have never gone through a dishwasher, and the teapot was totally covered by that greasy film on the glasses, and a whole corner was taken by an employee who was peeling string beans that were strewn all over the table. Now that&#39;s authentic Chinese. Ok, enough about the aesthetics, and onto the food.
We ordered a seafood hot and sour soup, beef and tomato over rice noodles, yang chow fried rice, and a Cantonese crispy skin chicken. All came out quickly. The hot and sour soup was served in a giant bowl that could have fed 6 or more people, but the broth was gelatinous, which led me think too much corn starch or egg whites were in it. The crispy chicken was good, served with the 5-spice salt, and the yangchow fried rice was decent. The noodles with beef and tomato was a mixed bag. I liked the noodles which had been fried until there was a nice crust on it, but the beef and tomato in the gravy was too salty and too sweet at the same time. The prices were cheap. The whole dinner bill was $34. The place is tiny. It holds about 25 people and you would feel cramped. The decor is tacky...pink walls and chairs and vertical blinds that match their &#34;fine eye&#34; for cleanliness. If you&#39;re looking for that overall Chinatown experience, here it is, right in the burbs.
I drove 20 miles from home to try this place, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to eat here again. Also, they don&#39;t accept American Express and also have that annoying rule of $10 minimum to use credit cards."

Secondly, the price is great!

I have never left this place without feeling satisfied.  To begin, it is located right outside my neighborhood perfect for a last minute dinner idea.  Their lunch special is a great deal, I never pay no more than 7 bucks.  It includes soup of your choice: egg drop or hot and sour, an egg roll with sweet and sour sauce and hot mustard, the main course plus a huge mound of there scrumptious fried rice with scallions, sprouts, bbq pork, and scrambled egg.  Plus they are very good with water refills and they provide each table with a hot tea pot of their Oolong tea.  I can&#39;t remember ever ordering a beverage.  They do however have coke and Chinese beer available.  The bathrooms ARE clean.  The service is very friendly and the food is served rather quickly after ordering.  There is no wheelchair ramp to get to the 2nd level.  There business does very well on weekdays and weekends.  I&#39;m a little bias because its the only Chinese restaurant I go to.

Time of my visit: Dinner

I have been coming to this place for a while now.  This is by far my favorite shawarma joint!  Today did not disappoint either!

Today, I order shawarma with fries and a drink, as well as an Israeli (it might be called something else now) salad.  Let me start with shawarma, it was excellent, the meat was perfectly cooked, moist and soft chicken!  I took it in the pita.  Usually they put Israeli salad inside as well.  It was a perfect ratio of meat to salad!

The fries looked like home made chips, which I personally prefer!  And they actually made it home with me without getting too saggy.  Delicious!

The Israeli salad was actually a nice size for a side salad and had plenty of different veggies in it!  Definitely worth the money!

Overall an A+ experience!

It came with a side of &#34;fries&#34;, which are more like chips, but were quite soggy. Also, after ordering, I was told it would take 10-15 minutes to get my food.

It has a similar concept to Chipotle.  You choose to start with either a pita, rice bowl, or salad bowl then choose your meat (chicken shawarma, steak shawarma, or falafel), garnishes (chopped salad, purple cabbage salad, sumac onions, and/or pickles), and sauces (tahini, garlic, amba, s&#39;khug, and/or harissa).  

I tried their salad bowl with chicken shawarma.  I really love the flavor of the chicken.  It was fresh, tender, and juicy.  The crunch of the salad was a great accompany to the meat.  If that was enough, the side a pita they provided was heavenly.  It was soft, warm, and had a nice chew.  The portion sizes here are very generous, so come with a hungry tummy.

During lunch time, the lines can be a little long.  But don&#39;t fret, it seems to go by fast.  The staff here are extremely efficient and friendly.  I can&#39;t wait until my next visit."

I crave the Chicken Shawarma (also love the Beef Tenderloin) Five stars just for this. My wife and I are hooked.

The fries are good, The Falafel is sometimes outstanding and sometimes just good, lentil soup is excellent and the Baba Ganoush is babaganoushy. I have a high tolerance for heat, so I don&#39;t find their hot sauces all that spicy, just really tasty! 

Prices are reasonable, right around $20 for two meals. If you want Tahini sauce and it isn&#39;t on your tray.. just ask. 

Bright and lively atmosphere. The place get&#39;s packed at lunchtime.. we find that if we get there 20 minutes before noon the lines aren&#39;t bad, otherwise we shoot for closer to 1. Even if there are lines.. they tend to move along pretty well.. of course most people are in a good mood.. I mean, you are at Naf Naf after all!"

I decided to check out the restaurant with her and let my taste buds have some adventure.  The ambiance is casual and comfortable.  It&#39;s not so loud so carrying a conversation is easy.  

I have had the Kefta Pita which is a freshly made pita stuffed with very well seasoned ground meat, hummus, chopped salad, and sumac onions.  The combination is very delicious, but messy as the garlic sauce drips.  Be prepared to wipe your hands periodically.  I received one side dish and decided to get the Naf Fries.  This was awesome.  It&#39;s even better with the Tahini Sauce.

The cashiers are all very pleasant to talk to and very patient when I asked them what is good.  I have been advised that questions such as, &#34;What do you like to eat here, or what is good here?&#34; are all very annoying questions.  So, when I asked those questions to them, they were prepared with an answer and how they answered was in a friendly tone.  I&#39;m impressed by their willingness to entertain my questions.

I would definitely come back here more often.  I can see why my co-worker loves this place.  I&#39;m definitely a fan."

I ordered the chicken schwarma plate (add a couple falafel) and he ordered the falafel pita. The prices were a little higher than I remembered, however I went home with a huge amount of leftovers for the next day. The plate will run about $12 depending on which one you pick. The plate comes with your choice of protein, rice, cucumber/tomato salad and a pita. There are also a few sauce choices that are left out so you can pick and choose. My favorite was the green. It had a little bit of a kick but the cucumber salad cooled my mouth down. 

The food is fresh so it&#39;ll take a few minutes for it to cook. Ours took about 15 minutes. You&#39;ll get a beeper and they&#39;ll buzz you when it&#39;s ready. 

The dining room is pretty big and I imagine it gets pretty packed here during peak times. There were quite a few people here, but still lots of places to sit. 

Of all the fast casual places in the area, I think NafNaf is my favorite. The ingredients are all fresh and you get a good amount of food for the price."

Food?  
Lentil Soup-Delicious!  Highly recommend.
Hummus-fresh, but a little on the bland side.
Pita-fresh, but a bit on the thicker side.  I like my pita thinner.
Chicken Shawarma-chicken flavorful, cabbage fresh and tahini.  Delicious.  I just thought it needed a little something else, flavor wise.  Glad I had ordered s side of hummus to add to my shawarma.

Lentil soup was tasty. It added a little hot sauce and pickle juice for flavor. 

Vegetarian platter was filling and generous with falafel , hummus, cabbage, babganoush and tahini.  All good things that can be even individually or stuffed into very fresh pitas that come with the meal.

NafNaf is to middle eastern food what Chipotle is to Mexican food. 
It&#39;s a healthy alternative to fast food for sure.  It&#39;s good quality and everything on the menu is safe for just about any person&#39;s tastes.  Just don&#39;t get too excited about this being any sort of authentic experience, it&#39;s not.... 
Somewhere like Pita Paradise in Carol Stream is much more authentic and the dishes will all have better depth to them while staying in the same price range. 
But, if you&#39;re an average suburbanite looking for something different for lunch, or if you&#39;re looking for something &#34;ethnic but not too ethnic &#34; then NafNaf is great.

I&#39;ve had good experiences with the chicken kabobs and shwarma as well as the beff kabobs and steak kabobs.  I feel like the pitas are a much better value for your money than the entrée plates. The pita bread here is pretty great."

I know Naf Naf&#39;ers would toss me out if they heard me say that, but it&#39;s true. You can branch out from the shawarma and order other things, people. And first on the list should be the beef tenderloin. --You can cut the steak with a plastic fork. And what to order with a plate of dead cow? It only makes sense to order the vegetarian feast. ;) --Purple Cabbage, Hummus, Tabule, Baba Ghanoush (tahini, eggplant, lemon, garlic, and olive oil) and 4 Falafels. I can&#39;t eat it all and I never reheat steak or falafel. It&#39;s terribly wasteful I know, but the combinations are just so good together, I just don&#39;t care.
 
Not much of a wait here. Even when it&#39;s busy it comes out fairly quick. Not immediate, but not long. 5-7 minutes. Not even on a Fri night do you wait much. And if you&#39;re like me and boycott the Valentine&#39;s Day Prix Fixe whilst sitting elbow to elbow with overly perfumed strangers, you can make Naf Naf your tradition as I have.

If you&#39;re hungry, don&#39;t think twice - just go here.  If you want great food but don&#39;t feel like paying over $10 - just go here.  What&#39;s that?  You&#39;ve bought into the hype of all these reviews and now you practically live off of Naf Naf shawarma and pita bread?  Well luckily LA Fitness is right across the street, so maybe grab a gym membership after you leave if you feel the need.  

Ok but who am I kidding, most of the food is here probably great for you and you definitely won&#39;t get sick of it ever.  Some of the best pita ever.  Check.  Perfectly seasoned and grilled meat.  Check.  Lentil soup, which is probably one of the healthiest (disregard sodium) and tastiest soups you can get anywhere.  Check.

The only place in my limited book of food that competes with this place is L&#39;As Du Falafel in Paris... but I would rather drive 15 minutes than fly hundreds of miles and wait in a long line to get my fill of shawarma and pita bread.

Not only is it noisy when there&#39;s more than 5 people, the employees are incompetent too (order foul ups on 2 consecutive visits). I&#39;m only one of three people in the place, but the counter woman who barely speaks English runs around looking for a beeper to give me. I convince her that it&#39;s not necessary and apparently that derailed her train of thought because she screws up my order. After getting my order corrected I proceed to eat a very mediocre meal that&#39;s way over priced. A pita sandwich with 3 small chunks of tenderloin, small order of humus, extra pita, and drink shouldn&#39;t cost $15. That amount and quality of food should be $7-8 at most.

Naf Naf once was a star in ascension, but it&#39;s clear they&#39;re in a downward spiral. I give everyone a second chance, but Saturday&#39;s experience was strike 3."

Years ago it was located in a tiny space within walking distance from where I live, and years into the future, it is still as tasty and delicious as ever! While I was working in New York over the summer I craved 2 things (1) Jimmy John&#39;s (2) Naf Naf

I don&#39;t usually eat vegetarian, but for EVERYONE I highly suggest getting the Falafel pita (or Veggie pita...it use to be on their old menu) at least ONCE. The few times that I have gotten the chicken breast pita or beef kabob pita, it is always juicy, seasoned and grilled perfectly.

I have never gotten anything else but a pita here, but trust me when I tell you I have eaten here at least once a week (no joke) for the past 6 months (not exaggerating), and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ever going to get sick of the food :)

What are you waiting for? Go get Naf Naf!"

My favorite was the shawarma pita, and the kebab pita. OUT OF THIS WORLD AMAZING! Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. 
The pitas are made in-house, making them light and fluffy. Hummus is great. So are the falafel. If I lived closer I would eat here once a week."

All perfect words to sum up this jem of a spot! I was here on a weekend vacation and stayed with local family and we came here for my last dinner before departing and oh my goodness it was so so spectacular! My uncle ordered the falafel on the plate, I got the beef tenderloin on a plate, and my aunt got the Israeli salad with a side of hummus. All meals come with your choice of two sides (hummus, fries, Israeli salad), yummy garlicky tahini, and a basket of warm, delicious, soft squishy made-fresh-on-site pita. I was blown away. I think of myself as a Mediterranean connoisseur and I&#39;ve never had squishy fluffy pita. I&#39;ve always had the flattened kind that&#39;s unleavened but this was. Ah. May. Zing. 

Green spicy sauce for the taking along with homemade pickles. They look like typical dill pickles but they&#39;re not. They&#39;re a nice salty palate cleanser. So good. 

Would love if this small chain would explode and open branches to replace every single Taco Bell and McDonald&#39;s in the U.S. but yknow, life can&#39;t make that much sense right? Ha! 

Two entrees, side of hummus, and main size Israeli salad with side fixins- Our meal was $30 with one medium drink. I even asked for taboule salad AND Israeli salad instead of hummus or fries (trying to stay away from carbs... Except that damn tasty pita!!!) and they happily made the exchange! No problem! 

Naf Naf you are fab fab."

I&#39;m 100% serious, and I&#39;m rooting for its success. My family and I have been noshing on Naf Naf for the past few years, and we&#39;re all obsessed. Mind you - this is a family with three vegetarians (read: not picky, but need good veggie options). Luckily, Naf Naf delivers.

Service has always been very friendly and the menu options they have are delicious, though selection is pretty limited (but hey, so is Chipotle!). The veggie platter is reasonably priced, filling, and beyond tasty so you&#39;ll have a hard time choosing between the hummus and the baba ghanoush to put on your pitas. Speaking of which, are wonderful beyond words... to paraphrase another reviewer &#34;PITA LIKE PILLOWS.&#34; Trust me, they are hands down the best pitas you will ever have. Ever.

The chicken, steak, falafel. It&#39;s all delicious. All fresh, and all perfectly seasoned. The pitas are fantastic. The cucumber salad is light and refreshing.

Having traveled across the U.S. extensively for the last decade, I have learned that the same cannot be said for anywhere else here.  I was usually disappointed by even more expensive establishments.  As a matter of fact, I could frequently be heard as saying, &#34;this Baba Ghanoush tastes like slug slime!&#34; And &#34;Who puts potatoes in tabbouleh?!&#34;.

You can imagine my surprise when I stepped into Naf Naf grill with low expectations, and ended up having one of the best falafel sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had, and great hummus to boot.  I was wary of the meat (because I thought Naf Naf was a big fast-casual chain, and I&#39;m weird like that) but after this experience, Yelp reviews, and reading the story of their small, local beginnings, I have no doubt the meat is fresh and delicious too.

I wish this location would let you choose what you want inside your pita. What you read on the menu is what you are served. Pickles and hot sauce are offered on the side, you will need to grab these items when you grab your order.

Not only because the food is so fresh and delicious, but because this place started in an old Taco Bell (or at least the building looked like it!) hole-in-the-wall location and has grown to so many locations! I&#39;m not sure how &#34;authentic&#34; the mediterranean food is, but damn is it fresh!

You first have to decide if you want a plate or a pita. I&#39;ve only had a pita and felt like rolling out of there like an oompa loompa, so I can&#39;t even imagine ordering a plate! And I&#39;ve seen them....like the Filipino culture, it seems like they don&#39;t want anyone to walk out hungry! Once you&#39;ve chosen your plate or pita, you choose your meat. My go-to is the beef tenderloin kabab. It&#39;s probably one of the best cooked slices of steak that I&#39;ve had...and it&#39;s always consistent! I&#39;ve also had the beef kifta kabab, which is very similar to a spiced and herbed hamburger patty. That one is hubby&#39;s go-to :) Inside the pita, you get some hummus, israeli salad (a yummy concoction of veggies) than topped with tahini sauce. They also always serve this green &#34;hot sauce&#34; on the side...which is insanely hot! 

Probably the best thing here though.....the pita! They make homemade pitas, and if you&#39;re lucky enough to get them right out of the oven (which is pretty often!) it&#39;s like eating a mini mediterranean cloud of goodness. Add some homemade hummus on the side, and it&#39;s amazing!"

There&#39;s some cute tables to sit at outdoors and there aren&#39;t many people who know about them. It&#39;s my favorite spot to sit when the weather is nice. :) 

I&#39;m so glad Naf Naf was my first experience; it really set a nice precedent for my Middle Eastern food obsession I have developed. Although I have found other places which I like just as much or slightly more, Naf Naf will always have a basketball sized spot in my food baby&#39;s heart."

I had chicken and beef. Both were dry and dull with minimal taste. The Israeli salad was good. And tabule salad was good. The baba ghanouj was quite oily. And the pitas couldn&#39;t have been whiter and fluffier, telling me there wasn&#39;t a whole grain within a mile of them. 

The most unfortunate thing is the price. I paid close to $30 for a so-so carry out meal. Never again."

It is SO good!

I always get the same thing: chicken shwarma on a plate with double Israeli salad, and a balklava. The chicken shwarma is this absurdly flavorful spit-roasted chicken that is always moist and tender, cut into strips. Then you get pitas which are warm, pillowy perfection, AND tahini, AND this weird hot pepper mix that I don&#39;t dare eat, AND the Israeli salad which is a cucumber-y delight! My mom loves their fries (which are potato chips. Right?! Why are these called fries?) but I can&#39;t get past that unusual and delicious salad. 

The baklava is packaged and ready to go at the counter, but tastes fresh every time, and is an incredible sweet ending to a delicious meal. Also, it looks really hard to make and like something I couldn&#39;t possibly recreate, so props to them.

The food is so fast and even with a drink, is in the $10-$12 standard lunch fare in the area range. I never eat there because they desperately need more space and the place is horrifically claustrophobic, but I generally like going to these types of places for &#34;to-go&#34; orders, anyway.

This place has all the perks of any other fast food restaurant, with some bonuses they can&#39;t measure up to. It&#39;s like a global-culturally savvy Panera. Or something. It&#39;s just so good. Go!"

Thank you for introducing hummus to my toddler, he is your biggest fan. Pita and hummus is a quick winning meal, no children&#39;s menu needed!

The pitas seriously cannot be missed, sort of like eating a heavenly cloud of carbs. We love to pickup a six pack of pitas to go for an easy dinner the next night, feels like eating out again at a fraction of the price. Or throw them in the freezer, they heat up nicely in the microwave or toaster.

My personal favorite is the veggie feast, with its crispy crunchy falafel partying with the creamy rich hummus, it&#39;s a winning combo. I always sub out the tabule salad for the Israeli salad

This is fast food at its finest. Bring the family, meet a friend, or rock it solo, this casual fresh restaurant is not to be missed."

Then about 5 employees REACHED OVER our tray to grab stuff for drive through orders. She just stood there yapping to her friends. Finally our food was handed to us.

I got home and unwrapped the snack wraps to find a sliver of chicken no bigger than my index finger inside of each snack wrap and no cheese. It was as if they cooked a chicken patty and sliced it up to pass as the chicken in the snack wrap.

I was visiting friends in Naperville, and my friends took me here as a &#39;must-go&#39; place in their neighborhood. I was wary of this since I generally try more local food while travelling, but went along. I&#39;ve had middle eastern food at many places across the country, but this definitely makes it to my top ten.

Ambiance &amp; service: The location is larger than the downtown chicago ones, with plenty of seating. Went here on a friday night, and it was pretty empty, just 3-4 other tables occupied. The store is clean and brightly lit, and the employees are friendly and serve you with a smile on their faces. It is a self service restaurant, where you tell them what ingredients to put, and they make it in front of you.

Food: Pretty darn good. Generally, falafel balls come out very dry and are not very flavorful. Naf Naf does a good job here, and the falafels are excellent. We had a pita sandwich, a rice bowl, and a bowl of soup and fries. Both, the sandwich and rice bowl were excellent. They have fresh salads to top off the bowl, and their sauces are really well made.
The soup was pretty decent, but the fries were too good, wouldn&#39;t recommend missing them.
I can possibly come back when I&#39;m not too well, to only get the soup and a side of rice.

Value: Well priced, and good quantity. Sandwiches are around $8-10, and sides for $2-3, it is a perfect lunch place. Food isn&#39;t too greasy or heavy, so that&#39;s a plus.

I would recommend everyone who likes middle-eastern or Mediterranean food to go here asap! Loved the place, and will be surely going back when I visit Chicago again."

I was downtown Naperville and called in my take out order since I know the one on Freedom Drive gets crazy busy. And with a toddler in tow I wanted my food ready when I got there and didn&#39;t have a toddler meltdown sitch.

Well I got there and there was no one in the joint. I mean, crickets. It was 5 p.m. on a weeknight and I was a little put off since no one was there. But I went to the counter and the guy had my order all ready to go. He was nice and told me where to park next time that won&#39;t require the parking garage (it&#39;s behind the building FYI0), so I&#39;ll remember that next time.

Well my little one thought we were eating there, proceeded to pull out a chair, climb up, and pat the seat next to her like &#34;Come on mommy, it&#39;s time to eat!&#34; Well how can you say no to that? I pulled up a chair and we ripped into our falafel pita sandwich with everything on it. My daughter devoured it and looked like she was in a food coma! Apparently this is toddler approved food. I love everything on their menu. Nothing I wouldn&#39;t order, just depends on my mood. Highly suggest eating here if you haven&#39;t already!

Well like I mentioned earlier they don&#39;t offer the full menu that I&#39;m used to. My hubby gave me his takeout order and not only do they not have dinner plates, they don&#39;t have the chicken breast as an option. They only have chicken shawarma, steak shawarma, and falafel. With those items you can put it in a pita sandy, in a rice or salad bowl, or a hummus bowl. It&#39;s kind of set up like a Chipotle where you order what you want and then you can add what toppings etc.

I like this set up and this location but it was still a bummer that they don&#39;t have the full menu offered. This definitely caters to the quick and fast factor. I will just remember this for the future!"

My husband and I both got the CHICKEN SHAWARMA bowl dinners, served with an excellent and flavorful lentil soup.

The menu was small. A friend I was with commented that the other locations had a larger/different menu. The hummus was good, but not all that much better than what I could buy at the store. The flatbread however, amazing.

I ordered the chicken shawarma along with rice, salad, onions, garlic sauce and pickles. The only thing memorable? The pickles. Those were delicious. I could have been happy with pickles and garlic sauce on flatbread..

The food was ready for pick up on time and easily packaged to take home; however, I probably would not order from them for catering again. First, the meat portions are just sad. The chicken and steak went so fast that I was embarrassed that there was none left for guests who arrived later. This might have been supplemented by the falafel that I ordered, but Naf Naf forgot to include it. So, there was no entrée for my vegetarian guests and scarce quantities for everyone else.  There was more of the condiments than anyone could have ever eaten - onions and cabbage galore - but those are cheap and no one wants a plate full of cabbage when they should have been eating falafel.  Otherwise, the food was tasty, fresh, and easy to lay out for guests. 
It took two phone calls and 30 minutes to receive the falafel refund. The manager gave a quick &#34;sorry,&#34; but that was it. When I&#39;m left feeling like a poor host due to the caterer&#39;s mix up, I think the restaurant ought to offer more than just the dollar amount I was shorted.

1. Dig around in your center console to find $1.00 in loose change. 
2. Walk into the nearest Naf Naf you can find. 
3. Order yourself 1 pita (they are like $.75 each). 
4. Wait for it. 
5. You will receive a receipt. You will want to keep this for nostalgic reasons.
6. Neatly fold receipt and place in your back pocket whilst you wait. 
7. You will then be handed a small paper bag. Caution: it will be warm!
8. Say &#34;thank you&#34; and go find a seat in the nicely maintained establishment. 
9. Open up paper bag to find the most amazing, soft, fresh, heavenly pita in the world.

At both the Rt 59 and Freedom Drive locations it&#39;s on the menu. Large hummus, five falafel and two pitas for $7.50. Went to get that here tonight and he smeared a little hummus in a bowl and put five pitas in it. I complained that it wasn&#39;t enough pita so he said it would cost extra for more. I spent over $9 and only got one pita. Never doing that again!"

I like the Chipotle-style set-up since I usually opt to get mine without some standard ingredients, and this also avoids the &#34;everyone lingering with their pager&#34; problem at the end of the line.  

Downside is that parking in downtown sucks (especially on week-ends/Fridays), so unless you&#39;re walking it might be hard to score a quick in-and-out. 

Still, this is convenient for students, people who work or live in town or a dinner before a night out in downtown N&#39;ville. And Naf Naf is already a known commodity; you know it&#39;s gonna be good. Step on up and shawarma it up."

Even though I can WALK to this location from my house, and drive there in like, 2 minutes, I prefer to go out of the way to the Freedom Dr. location or even the one in Aurora to enjoy the classic Naf Naf format. This Chipotle-like setup is just not great. The ingredients suffer in terms of freshness and the bowl or sandwich options are just not as satisfying as the big falafel plates I can get at the other locations.

If you are new to Naf Naf, I would urge you to try one of the the original concept locations to see how good they can really be before coming here. This place is ok for a quick snack or lunch but the old way is just so much better."

I love that you can see the meat cooking on the skewer behind the counter. It gives the restaurant a modern and authentic vibe. The staff is very friendly and the food there is never stale. The only reason I wouldn&#39;t give this restaurant 4 stars is because of the lack of variety. Whereas in most Naf Naf&#39;s there are many different dishes such as the steak kabob plate and falafel/hummus plate, this location revolves around mostly just the shawarma as well as lentil soup, I believe. The options for the shawarma are chicken, steak, or vegetarian. You can also get a shawarma bowl where they give you yellow rice instead of the pita bread. Although there is limited variety, the taste of what they have here is still really great. And oh! The hummus! It is amazing. I could live on just the hummus here for a month!"

The meats were cold and not heated thru. Probably from yesterday and not heated thru. The pita fell apart when we hit into it again probably stale. Pass on this.

Naf naf is known for their pillow like pitas, and tasty falafel. If you want their simple staples this is your place.

Tonight was a game changer for my family.  We walked in and we&#39;re the only ones there for about 10 mins. After we got our food and there were 3 other tables seated we started hearing someone in back going to town banging something.  We all waited for it to stop and after about 20 mins I asked the manager what all the noise was. It was 6:30pm mind you. Prime dinner hour and he said it was one of the guys trying to break apart the chicken for tomorrow!!!! I kid you not. Why do I need to hear that in the middle of my meal and WHY are you telling me someone is hammering the frozen chicken I just fed my 5 yr old. We will not be going back

Went in as a group of 4 - we have gone to this location multiple times over the years. We will never go here again.  
Our server, a girl with light brown hair (we will not disclose her name for privacy purposes), was extremely rude. She began to take our food away from in front of us even while we were still visibly eating it. When we ordered tea and coffee after our meal we were not asked for milk or sugar, and were lukewarm when we got them. 
Her disinterested tone and sarcastic, arrogant attitude was what defined our experience. The whole process seemed as if we were being rushed out. The waitress was pleasant to the other (white) customers, which makes her unpleasant disrespectfulness all the more peculiar. 

Now I haven&#39;t even got to the food. The antipasti were hastily made with no real care or attention to quality. Salad was watery and the cheese tasted stale. Pizza was soggy and you could see the grease pooling at the top. The crust had no real firmness to it.

My friend ordered a pizza, she didn&#39;t want to say anything but i could tell by looking at it that it wasn&#39;t right! guess what?  The pizza was basically not cooked at all, the dough was soft and the inside had not been cooked, we told our waiter, he said he was sorry but did nothing about it! no offer to replace it or go back and cook it! nothing.  At the end of teh meal a manager showed up to apologize and gave us a free appetizer coupon, nice gesture but....really!!!!!!!"

The interior design is very attractive, with comfortable chairs and booths. Fantastic wait service and speedy food delivery to the table.

The first visit I ordered the special: Lasagna... 
After about 3 bites, I found that I could not pallette anymore of the foul flavor of the meat or the noodles. The sauce was acidic and not at all appealing.

The second visit in September was brought about by the GIFT CARD that the Manager gave me for the Lasagna. 

I ordered the Spaghetti with Meatballs and it arrived with plain noodles, a teaspoon of Marinara sauce and 3 meatballs. Yes, a TEASPOON of SAUCE!

Yeah, I know that apparently it&#39;s not common for Italian restaurants to provide much sauce with your pasta, but having grown up AMERICAN, this was just so pathetic.

I ended up ordering 4 more sides of sauce (they gave me 2-3 oz per request) and eventually settled down to eat my spaghetti. The noodles were perfectly al dente, the sauce was tasty, but acidic. I added about 1/4 cup Parmesan and it helped.

BUT THOSE MEATBALLS!
O.M.G. how horrible they tasted. Like mildewed socks left near a litter box.

Apparently, Biaggi&#39;s loads up every meat recipe with more BASIL than any other ingredient. Basil is a potent, powerful flavor and a simple dash of it is enough for a gallon of Spaghetti. These meatballs were more Basil than they were meat.

I gave Biaggi&#39;s a second chance. They are not getting a third."

LASAGNA BOLOGNESE(Tomato-Meat Sauce, Italian Cheese Blend,Three-Cheese Alfredo Sauce), an absolute delicious dish. There is an option to enjoy a smaller portion of any of their delicious pasta selections. I don&#39;t recommend it. The portion is pretty small to begin with, you don&#39;t really want to go even smaller to save a few dollars. Get the full size. You&#39;ll love every bite.


SEA SCALLOP RISOTTO(Seared Jumbo Scallops, Creamy Italian Rice
with Asparagus, Corn &amp; Pancetta,Basil-Leek Reduction, Jumbo Lump Crab), is a great dish. I&#39;ve had it twice and both times, the risotto was cooked perfectly. The little pieces of asparagus, corn, and pancetta pairs well with the creaminess of the rice. The sea scallops are a decent size, lightly seared and I think it might be buttered as well. It&#39;s delicious and doesn&#39;t have that gross ammonia taste with bad scallops. The only complaint I had is the &#34;jumbo lump crab&#34; description. There are little chunks of crab meat, but it was definitely not a large portion."

It&#39;s a large restaurant with plenty of seating and it also has a bar area. They take reservations and I recommend making them as it was packed on a Saturday night. We had reservations for 6pm and arrived 20 minutes early and had to wait until our reserved time. We went to the bar and had cocktails until our table was ready. I had the best Moscow mule ever. It wasn&#39;t the traditional ginger beer, vodka and lime juice...it also had tonic and soda water and mint. Refreshing. We were able to have the drinks transferred to our food bill, which was nice.  Our server, John was a nice guy, friendly and provided good service.  For dinner, I had the wedge salad and a pizza. The wedge was large enough for two to share and was good, lots of yummy blue cheese.  My wild mushroom and truffle pizza was flavorful. However, I inquired if the crust was Neapolitan style, thin and bubbly like in Naples, and was told yes. I was disappointed when I was served as it was not a wood fire Neapolitan crust.  All in all, a decent place to eat at."

The pasta (both mine and my wife&#39;s) was not cold, but looked dry across the top, which means it sat a while under the heat lamps. Maybe they were waiting for our friends&#39; food?  Not likely. Our server (Jeff) was a train wreck. He disappeared several times for way too long. He didn&#39;t tell us the specials, and when we asked he didn&#39;t know them.

We brought my 1 year old nephew who made a little mess on the floor with his food. My brother in law started to clean it when the manager came over and thanked him for not ignoring it.

The food is okay to somewhat above average depending on what you order, parking is easy compared to eating in town and this is close to our house.

Tonight I decided we will not be returning because of 3 things- 

1) The hostess who sat us complained about the staff saying, &#34;  I am sorry for the delay.  They are slow clearing tables tonight.  I told them they better start working if they want to earn any money tonight. &#34;  Who says this to a customer?  Also, the wait was not long, maybe 5 minutes with no reservation. 

2) Our waiter never checked back with us after we got our food. He arrived after we were finished. To his credit, he acknowledged this lapse.  

3). As we finished dinner I got a sliver from the table!  I mentioned it to the waiter suggesting maybe someone might smooth it over or sand it a bit before it happened again.  The manager or asst manager came over and looked at my hand and said, &#34; You don&#39;t need a tourniquet for that, do you?&#34;  No, I did not. It was not a big deal and I was not making it one. I was simply suggesting a problem be fixed and did not appreciate the sarcasm. 

There are many restaurant choices in Naperville.  This will not be one of ours in the future."

Just didn&#39;t have the same taste or feeling.  I always order a tiramisu to go to have later at home.  Bad batch today. The &#39;ladyfinger&#39; layer was dry.  Very disappointing.

 We ordered appetizers which were very good. Our server suggested we order our entree if we knew what we wanted. She assured us she would time it out so things didn&#39;t get doubled up. It did not happen that way. We were 30% done with the apps and here comes the entrees. Grrrr.
 The entrees were good, however there was a constant presents of fruit fly&#39;s around our plates as the meal went on. Grrrr. Unacceptable!
 I had noticed a peach cobbler dessert special that I wanted to take out for later. It took forever to get to the table. It came in a nice little bag with three containers. When I got home I discovered, one was a scoop of ice cream, one was four thin strawberry slices and one was a very small quantity of peach slices reduced in a syrup. That&#39;s it.

I live nearby and my wife and I eat out several times a week and have never experienced the treatment we received at Biaggi&#39;s last week. First, the waiter was as rude as he could be but, it gets worse when I am served a drink and happen to feel something in my mouth and I swallow what turns out to be glass. I look at the drink and notice that the top of the glass is chipped and cracked down the side. I inform the waiter who grabs the glass from me and runs. Then I ask to speak with a Manager who I inform what has happened and she tells me that the waiter has clocked out and she knows nothing about this (this is all in ten minutes). The manager went and found the glass in the the trash and I am wondering how our waiter all of the sudden is off duty. She doesn&#39;t know what is going on and then another manager comes over and we explain what happened and he tells me that I am lying to him. This place is the worst in Naperville and if you are looking for good service or management find another place. Plenty of great restaurants in the area without suffering through this type of treatment."

The food is delicious and we have never had a bad MAIN course.  I have my favorite, which is Butternut Squash ravioli, but have had other items that I really enjoyed, such as their jumbo lump crab cakes and Potato Parmesan crusted Tilapia, and of course, their pasta dishes.  Oddly enough, it&#39;s during the week when it&#39;s not so busy that we&#39;ve had a few poor experiences....usually with the large house dinner salad the my husband and I split.  Twice it&#39;s arrived at our table with some wilted lettuce in it or bits of slimy, very old lettuce that&#39;s really gone bad, and old shredded carrots.  I think that during the week when there isn&#39;t such a high flow of customers, that something fresh, like salad ingredients, sits in their refrigerator and starts to go bad.  On the weekends, the produce is much fresher, I think, because they go through it faster (?)   Biaggis, if you step up your fresh produce during the week, I will re-review you and give you a five star rating!!"

We usually start with calamari and stuffed mushrooms as appetizers. Weve had different entrees but i really like the salmon and shrimp risotto and my daughter always goes for the spaghetti. Service is usually good...sometimes depending on the waiter u get are very attentive but most times their attentive. Decor is nice and location is very central to that part of the area. Price is about the same as Olive Garden. We like to go here when were around.

One of our favorite things is the bar and eating at the bar.  The bartenders are a riot and not afraid to tell you to have or not have the especial of the day.  I love that!  We strive to at least once a week.  An absolute winner."

Def make reservations, we were seated promptly and was immediately given the rosemary focaccia bread which was DELICIOUS!! We ordered chicken Marsala and lobster cream penne which was beyond good. I got a lemon basil martini which was good and my bf got a glass of the house white wine which was good.

Let me preface this by saying I have eaten here before and had a great experience. However, last night I went with friends who were eating there for the first time and it was NOT a pleasant time. 

In terms of food, I wasn&#39;t impressed with my Cesar salad or my pizza. I&#39;ve had the pizza before and it is usually much better, I don&#39;t know if it was an off night or what. Creme Brulee dessert was pretty good and my friends seemed to like their food. What upset me was the service provided by our server, Ted.

As soon as we asked for separate checks, he got an attitude. He had only taken ONE order and then said he would have to start over and made a big show of it. It&#39;s really not that big of a deal and plenty of servers do it without acting like it&#39;s a huge issue. My boyfriend wasn&#39;t eating and when he said so, our sever acted like it was a huge affront on him personally. My boyfriend drank a beverage, got dessert..just didn&#39;t want an entree. I did not like the server&#39;s attitude about it one bit and he made the whole table uncomfortable. 

Another problem came up when we presented a coupon for a free appetizer. He said I couldn&#39;t use it because I was getting the pizza and it was only valid with an entree. Keep in mind that the menu actually states you can either eat the pizza as an appetizer or an entree..whatever. 3 other people got entrees. He said we couldn&#39;t &#34;cross&#34; use the coupon. My friend ordered a half order of pasta and then finally he said he would &#34;see what he could do&#34; and would put it on my friend&#39;s check. After this whole thing, he then said that actually it wouldn&#39;t count because she ordered a half order and not a full order. First, why wouldn&#39;t you tell us that beforehand? He knew she ordered the half.  Second, the coupon says it is valid with an entree or pasta. It does not say it has to be a full order of pasta. 

After he walked away, we were clearly annoyed and he could tell. He then went completely overboard trying to make nice, joining in on our conversation and trying to befriend the toddler in our group. This was equally annoying and did not make up for his behavior at the beginning of the meal. At the end, he put the wrong dessert on my friend&#39;s check and made a big deal of making sure he collected the coupon. 

My friends were not pleased because they had been wanting to try Biaggi&#39;s for awhile and then had this experience. I don&#39;t know if they will be back and I might, but only if I get a different server."

THE GOOD: We arrived early for our reservations and were sat early - even though the place was PACKED with people waiting - great start. The restaurant is open but still intimate and I loved the decor. Our server was fantastic. A TAD bit overconfident but he knew his ish. I was here with another friend two nights before a marathon, so we were happy to stuff ourselves with the bread and olive oil - so much so that we ordered another round of the free stuff. I settled on the chicken parmesan - something I don&#39;t typically order. They got me with &#34;delicately&#34; breaded, as I wanted some protein but not a bland piece of chicken. I also ordered light cream in the sauce. What came out was absolutely incredible. Savory, wonderful pro-portion of meat to pasta and very fresh. Everyone else was happy with their meals as well. There was a pumpkin creme brulee on special which we ordered as dessert - it was a huge portion for creme brulee and was some of the best I&#39;ve ever had!

THE BAD: Holy portion sizes. For the price of $16, I would have expected soup or salad, or enough food to last me a good 2+ meals. But I got none of those. I don&#39;t eat large meals, and almost finished mine. And, the $16 got me that and that only. About 99% of the restaurants in the area serve soup or salad with your entree but this is not one of them. I was shocked when I was told there was nothing that came with the meal!"

It is the first choice when I want to skip cooking at weekend, when friends come to visit us. Their fish never disappoints me. Scallops is very good. We always Start with calamari. Recently I tried their chicken masala, I have to give it thumb up. Always ask for today&#39;s special, you will have good stuff off menu."

The food is great Italian with a flair. Excellent wine list to include Lambrusco and Moscato D&#39;Asti--and a very, very well-stocked bar/cellar.

We can never get enough of the Biaggi&#39;s butter: olive oil, cheese, and pepper to dip the amazing crusty bread and homemade focaccia strips. Delish!

My favorite dishes are angel hair with tomato sauce or the pasta and seafood. Their tomato soup is unrivaled, and their starter or entree pizzas are delicately flavored and bright.

Don&#39;t leave without having dessert, there&#39;s so much to chose from, and it&#39;s all delicious: the banana chocolate chip bread pudding, the banana crepes, the semifreddo.

Menu changes seasonally to keep items fresh and hopping out of the kitchen.

This location has a great viewable prepping area in the kitchen that you can pretty much see from almost anywhere you&#39;re seated. The staff is very nice, yet rotates a little often for my taste--but they&#39;re all awesome and we love making new friends."

Once at lunch and once at dinner. Both times we had Rebecca as our waitress. She is phenomenal at her job and just adds to the excellent food and atmosphere. Do not miss the lobster corn chowder soup or the sea scallop risotto. Both deserve 10 stars for their marriage of flavors. I&#39;m so happy we have such a great place to dine so close to our homes.

One more thing, the bread is to die for!!!  So soft and warm and you dip it in some seasoned olive oil.  I am salivating now as I write this!

It&#39;s a cheesy chain restaurant that had a dull menu. I ordered a shrimp/pasta dish and it was so bad I couldn&#39;t even eat more than one bite!

I haven&#39;t been to Biaggi&#39;s in ages and the boy has never been so it was good place to hit up for a date night! We arrived at 6pm and it was already packed!  We were told we would have to wait 20 min, but it was actually 40 min.  They took several late arrival reservations in the meantime. 

We started off with the Lobster Corn Chowder.  The lobster and corn gave this dish a nice sweetness to go along with the hint of spice that hit the tongue.  It was great! We split a bowl between us with the garlicky bread that they bring out and it was a perfect start to the meal!  A couple bowls of this would even be a great meal!

The boy had the Chicken Parmesan.  He said it was really good and pretty much wiped his plate clean with a piece of bread!  The price to portion ratio is a little off though.  For $15 there could have been a little more offered up.  Maybe bigger cutlets or something.

I had the Black Fettuccini with Lobster.  The Cuttlefish ink gave the fettuccini a little more of a starchy texture and added to the seafood flavor of the dish.  Tossing in some wild mushrooms with the lobster was an awesome touch!  I loved the flavors!  The lobster was a little tough though.  It was a bit over cooked which is unfortunate for the portion size and the amount we paid. 

All and all the waiter was very nice and we had a lovely time for our date night!  It just wasn&#39;t quite as fancy and nice as I remembered it."

Biaggi&#39;s bills itself as &#34;casual&#34; dining, but the decor and service make you feel comfortable even if you&#39;re dressed up. I remember the first time I came here right after it opened -- I think I had just graduated from high school. My friend and I were like &#34;Whaaaat why is this place so fancy??&#34; LOL. #suburbkids. But seriously. I love the bathrooms here too.

Quattro Formaggi Tortelloni: 7 big pieces of rich, cheese-filled tortelloni with perfectly tender pasta shells (skins?) over a mixture of creamy pesto and marinara. Yummm. This is like ravioli for grownups.

Lobster-stuffed sole: This was on their (seasonal?) special menu. The piece of fish was actually quite small and dwarfed by the big grilled asparagus, but the lobster taste was definitely prevalent and delicious.

White chocolate bread pudding: We didn&#39;t even look at the dessert menu; this was a recommendation from our waitress and boy was it decadent -- a big mound of soft bread pudding sitting in a moat of melted white chocolate with a smattering of dark chocolate flakes and strawberry slices. It&#39;s big enough for 3-4 people to split, though you might not want to share it at all."

Having eaten here dozens of times you can always expect decent food and service. Tonight was a mess. Service slow, inattentive and indifferent. Two of four entries sent back. Lasagna appeared microwaved. Hard, black, truly inedible cheese. Risotto hard and dry. Upside was a nice pumpkin brûlée dessert, served on the house by an apologetic and professional manager. 

Gotta say, this experience will send me to the east side of Rt 59 to Francesca&#39;s for future Italian cravings."

I used to go for lunch after tennis with the Rush Copley team and have dined there repeatedly for the past several years.  My favorite salad is the beat and goat cheese salad.  The bacon-wrapped dates are also excellent.  However, the past couple of times my meals have been way too SALTY. Tonight was a case in point. The gluten-free mushroom truffle pizza was terrible, because of the salt.  My husband&#39;s white bean soup was terribly SALTY. The previous dinner, the lobster risotto was incredible SALTY.

One positive that I learned about this place that sets it different from other Italian Restaurants is that their food is fresh and you can taste that in each ingredient. (Unlike Frozen from Olive Garden---but I&#39;m not hating cause I love Olive Garden!) My sister and I split the Chicken Marsala. I don&#39;t like my sauce all over the plate so I got it to the side. If you are not a huge eater--split it..but if you are extra hungry-don&#39;t! My parents split a chicken dish too. The chicken is cooked perfectly--you can&#39;t go wrong. 

Help yourself to bread dipped with oil in the beginning and don&#39;t be shy to look at the desert menu! It offers a lot but I&#39;m glad we made the 7 dollar choice of Banana&#39;s Foster! It&#39;s a crepe filled with banana&#39;s with caramel, chopped almonds, and biscotti surrounding vanilla ice cream on top! It&#39;s HUGE. 

I was a little cold in here..but I get cold fast so maybe take a light cardigan with you. 

The ambiance is great. Romantic with huge overhead lamps and it makes you feel like you&#39;re in Italy. Even though I&#39;ve never been to Italy. The service is great too. They have a &#34;party&#34; room in the back too. We didn&#39;t make reservations at 6:30 on a Sunday night..but it did started to look packed later."

Just doesn&#39;t do it for me. Salad was real good this time but wasn&#39;t in the mood for a pork chop, which I have enjoyed in the past. 

I did edit my last review, as I received a note from a former server, that stated servers are forced to serve what ever the kitchen gives you. Not having worked in the industry, perhaps that is the norm? I always feel the server is the defender of our pleasant or unpleasant experience.

It&#39;s all about tact in IMO. I been somewhere and the server makes or brakes the dinner. Two stars mean just that...&#34; I&#39;ve experienced better&#34;. I wouldn&#39;t return if it turned into a pattern. Everyone is entitled to an off night. I suggest you servers love your job and treat your customers like elite members of some secret society...

The soup is creamy, spinachy, and hearty.  Also tried the tiramisu and bananas foster for dessert, both of which were excellent.

It&#39;s one restaurant I find myself recommending that&#39;s on 59. It&#39;s casual, but you could also go a bit more snazzed up, which is really what the environment calls for. If you go on a weeknight, you&#39;re likely able to snag a table upon walking in, that is if you&#39;re going before 6:45. Later dinners you might have to wait; for the weekends, it would be wise to make a reservation.

The service is always friendly. I&#39;ve been going more frequently lately, but have been here handfuls of times. Our recent servers, Michael and Amanda were great; very friendly. I love their bread here and find myself scarfing it down every time. I always start with a margarita pizza, because, well, obviously. However, the last time I was there we ordered the crab cakes and those were a pretty groovy chew for sure, a good stray from the usual. The black fettuccine is great, the steaks were rad, appetizers are a go, pasta is a great choice, and the pizza rocks. You&#39;ll likely find something to accommodate your tastes.

The price is reasonable and the portion size is good. This is a good place to go to if you&#39;re around the area and want to go somewhere a bit more dressy."

I cannot believe this place has 4 star rating on yelp. I am guessing a 4 star restaurant in the &#39;burbs is not equivalent to a 4 star restaurant in the city.

Absolutely mediocre food. We ordered two pastas and a pizza among 4 of us. Only the pizza was something that we could talk about. The pastas were dry, no real taste. It is just a glorified Olive Garden."

You really can&#39;t beat the value here.  Excellent food once again, excellent service once again, and of course, excellent prices!

A few new things I tried...Rigatoni alla Toscana...rigatoni with sausage, peppers, and onions in their awesome marinara...and the best part, a huge, yummy glob of goat cheese on top of it all.  Loved it!  The left-overs were just as good today!

Also different for me this time, I opted for some tasty martinis instead of splitting our normal bottle of wine.  I love &#34;different&#34; martinis...ones you can&#39;t find other places and Biaggi&#39;s didn&#39;t disappoint.  I had a Pomegranate Blueberry Sage martini, which was very different, and super tasty.  It could have been a little stronger, but I really liked the sage flavor...all the flavors complemented each other well.  It tasted like Christmas!  I also had a Basil Lemon Drop.  This one was also super yummy, and while I liked the flavors of the other one better, this one was stronger.

Our food came fast, our server, hostess, everyone was just polite and great and on point.  All of our &#34;usuals&#34; ...the fried ravioli, chicken Florentine soup, soft, tasty bread, cannolis, and my husband&#39;s cesar salad, eggplant parm, and bread pudding (my husband once again declared that it&#39;s his favorite dessert ever) were great as always!"

I have to give this place another try at some point to be fair because I&#39;ve only tasted one entrée-- which was not good =(.  But to be fair.. I&#39;m giving it a 3 stars to not pass judgement too early... 

So future edit/reviews may be in order...  In the mean time, here&#39;s what happened:

It was their lunch special: the Wahoo Fish with grilled potatoes, tomatoes and a few beans.  Well, it wasn&#39;t good.  The fish was extremely overcooked.  I&#39;ve never had fish that was grilled to be so dry and hard as much as that.  The potatoes were very oily, chewy and tasted like they were burnt. 

I couldn&#39;t finish my fish and didn&#39;t really want to.  I wasn&#39;t so excited this time but hopefully Biaggi will right the wrongs on the next entree I&#39;ll order.   Another friend of mine ordered a pasta dish that had shrimp and mussels and he finished that plate cleaned.  So I&#39;m thinking it was just my choosing and unfortunate luck? 

Biaggi, I wont give up on you just yet... But if fool me twice, then you will be considered &#34;Yelped!-slapped&#34;"

I decided to give it another go since this place is rated 4 stars.  The food is always too salty or too bland, things have not changed.  I had the chicken marsala - I&#39;ve never had chicken marsala that looks like chicken and mushrooms in chicken gravy.  Had a slight taste of marsala, but damn...  The spinach was overcooked and bitter.  The mashed potatoes looks freshly made but pasty tasting for some reason.  Also tried the special and the seafood angel hair pasta dish.  The special was very bland (some kinda clam linguine in garlic butter sauce).  The angel hair pasta dish was all chicken bouillon.  The black linguine with lobster was actually pretty good.  The only passable Italian dish.  The veal parmesian was ok, a little heavy on the cheese.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a fan of the marsala sauce.

The tiramisu was actually pretty good, but it was like 7.50 for a pretty small piece (3.5x3.5&#34;?)

All in all, MAYBE I&#39;ll try it again in another 5 years.  I&#39;m shocked and disappointed that Yelp reviewers rate this place so high."

This time we arrived well before 5 o&#39;clock opening on a weekday and sat outside in the crazily-warm November breeze in the al-fresco area watching traffic go by. A woman came out to light our votive candles on the table; sorry we were not able to order a drink. Presently a gentleman came out and asked if we had reservations, we did not. He explained there was the &#34;fancy&#34; dining room with more large-plate selections, and the main room with small plates - he would try to get us into the dining room.

Come 5 PM we were escorted by the same gentleman (who as it turns out was an assistant manager) into the small room -- he was not able to get us into the main room. Bummer, On the way in he described briefly the history of the space. We sat at a nice table for two at the window - good to be early. A busboy brought wonderful chips and a black bean dip with a subtle spice -- nice change from the usual salsa. I ordered a guacamole-of-the-day with pomegranate pips - one of the best guacs I have had. I will say again, chips were excellent.

The server Jessica introduced herself and her trainee at her hip, and pointed at the wall full of different tequilas. I ordered a Tradicional margarita, she asked if I wanted to try an &#34;upgrade&#34; tequila and described the differences. I stuck with the stock version. My wife had a Coladita, pineapple juice and coconut liquor. Both were good; the margarita was not great, and for $10 seemed small. I have trouble identifying good tequila, so it may be better than I can tell.

The server described the dishes available. I chose the Bien Trucha tacos, with grilled skirt steak &amp; chorizo. Wonderful. My wife had the a la Diabla with sauteed shrimp and a butter-mojo de ajo. The tacos came 4 to a plate, sized to be easy to eat. We traded a taco (food is very shareable) and we both liked the other&#39;s dish.

For our dinner drinks, I had a Michelada with Negra Modelo Dark and various flavorings in a salted glass, as I had discovered in Cancun, and it was as good as I remember - reminiscent of a Bloody Mary with a Mexican twist. My wife had the Chelada which was basically Negra Modelo Dark in a salted glass with lime. She preferred the Michelada. I forgot how good they are, especially in summer.

Summary: wonderful meal and drinks, fun, loud atmosphere, impeccable casual service. I would not hesitate to return, perhaps with a reservation to try the larger-plate dining room.  They also have a lunch time &#34;LIL DONKEYS&#34; menu that really looks good. Recommended."

The plates were unique and pleasing, as were the bathroom sinks, lights, the outdoor setup, and much of the restaurant. The food itself was superb, priced reasonably for what you received, and the service was excellent. I had the signature tacos, and they might have been the best tacos that I&#39;ve ever had. This includes some of the best rated places in Mexico, Texas, and California that I have eaten at.

But this was not our case, we were sat right away and new that we would going to order the Steak Tacos, which we did and then we ordered the Chicken Flautas. They were good but not as good as the Steak Taco&#39;s. The side corn dish was so so so good. The upbeat music that was pumping through this place was putting me in a good mood too.

Our power was out, so we decided to make the most of it and go get dinner somewhere far away. Bien Trucha it was!

With the menu running relatively cheap, and becaude these were only a dollar more than soda, my wife got a limonada and I got a mangoneada. Both were bright and fresh, and the mangoneada in particular was quite thick, like a smoothie (mango water is not a good description for this menu item). The rim of chili-based seasoning provided a familiar heat with the drink as well. 

I also ordered esquites, which was grilled corn with lime and cotija. I&#39;d definitely get this again, and it went well with my Atun tacos, or tacos with breaded tuna cubes.

It&#39;s pretty easy to describe the ingredients, but the thing that stands out is the balance of the ingredients. It would be so easy for any of the ingredients on the tacos to overwhelm, and you won&#39;t see me argue against having a fistful of fish on my plate. But no; each bite has the creaminess of the avocado, a little bit of fish, a bit of pickled onion. This is taco perfection.

I&#39;m pleased to say my wife&#39;s Bien Trucha was treated with the same care, only including skirt steak.

I&#39;m hoping to get a trip back here before winter sets in, because the things they&#39;re pulling off deserve the attention they get."

The star was definitely the corn. Both taco types lacked flavor and did not taste as authentic as my cheap local taco joint. The menu felt disjointed with very limited options if you didn&#39;t want tacos or tortas. 

Ok so the service was attentive, but food was lacking any real flavor. I guess it&#39;s catering to the Americanized Mexican pallette... But this non-amateur eater left greatly disappointed. This place is extremely overhyped and overpriced. There are so many better places to get your taco fill."

It had just rained outside by the time we got to dinner, so the patio was all closed up. However, as our dinner went on, they slowly opened it back up and had a great waiting spot for people outside. It was probably my favorite thing about the unique set up of the whole restaurant! Tables are a bit crowded together and voices carry/echo throughout, so don&#39;t plan to come here for a quiet dinner.

We started off ordering drinks at the bar, as we had to wait for our (previously reserved) table. House margarita, watermelon marg, and I had the strawberry marg. Our bartender did not skimp on the tequila! They were fresh and very tasty drinks. 

We then got to our table and promptly ordered the guac of the day which had mangoes in it. Real tasty, but I cringed knowing that we paid $9 for the lump of it that we got. We also ordered the Bien Trucha and Pollo tacos, both of which were good. The Pollo comes in a fried tortilla, which I was not expecting. The BT tacos were pretty standard steak tacos with cheese and some sauce drizzled over it. 

All in all it was perfect for the occasion we were there for, and I&#39;m glad to have tried it, but I certainly wouldn&#39;t become a regular here. I&#39;d be bankrupt on my third trip!"

This meant my parents were mashed together on the booth half of a small table and their elbows were basically on the neighboring tables. I know it&#39;s a small place but c&#39;mon, it was not that busy. 

Instead of chips and salsa, they drop off chips and beans at the table.....I&#39;m not sure I have ever heard of this before, but it was not very good. So I asked for salsa to go with the chips (standard and complimentary at 99.9% of places) and the waitress told me she could not just bring salsa, but I would have to order the salsa platter for extra $. 

After that things were pretty average. My tacos al pastor were solid, but the chicken tacos come drenched in a cold sauce that immediately cools off the tacos."

Tacos were on the smaller side but ok I liked the al pastor more because it had more favor and sauce, as for the steak a bit bland. I didn&#39;t enjoy the vanilla flan it was too sweet.

My buddy and I had a reservation last night. I arrived a couple minutes early, and sat at the bar. Ordered a corona, and I was handed a can of it. $5. Not a great first impression. 

Once my friend arrived, we were seated at one of the 10 tables there. No joke, not a huge place. They have a sister restaurant attached, which is only open for lunch. They may seat folks there once they are full, as it&#39;s the same ownership.

We had the tacos, and tortas. We also had some corn appetizer, which was phenomenal. Can&#39;t remember what it was called (Lo Siento, mi espanol es no bueno) but it was a must have. The tacos were great, tortas were nothing special. The meat on the skewer was tough. 

A bill for the two of us was $50, plus tip. While the food was great, it wasn&#39;t worth that much. If they brought their prices down by 20% or so, or increased portion size, it&#39;d be a great spot.

I love the fish tacos and chicken rolled tacos. I&#39;ve tried almost everything on the menu but these are my go-to. This is the only Mexican place in Chicago area that serves authentic rolled tacos. (If you know of others, I always looking for reminders of home do msg me w/ locations, please). I make them at home but nothing compares to well made ones + the delicious (slightly spicy) sauce + cheese they pour on them, YUM! 

The potatoes bravas are delicious as are the beans. You could easily share a guacamole app + each a taco entree. Tacos will more than fill you up since they come four to a serving. I usually end up taking one home. 

The patio in spring/summer is awesome, reminds me of a Miami lounge vibe when they&#39;ve got the DJ going and strawberry margaritas are being sipped. Certainly don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m in Illinois! 

Staff has always been super attentive. On a busy night, keep an eye on the bar seats for folks waiting for tables and slide in there for a shorter or no wait.

At about 4:20, I sidled up to the end the line outside of two rather unobtrusive buildings that one would otherwise mistake for a home on a main street. As it turns out, they are both part of the unique location that entail a primary dining room, a beautiful outdoor bar and dining space, and a separate bar with kitchen service.

Friendly well trained staff greeted us in line with an ipad to arrange our reserved seating, and informed us of our seating options, whereupon sitting outside was deemed the best available. I do appreciate the well organized line management, as it saved us from several would-be line cutters!

After what turned out to be a very short wait after opening, I was greeted with a flurry of professional service by a team of knowledgeable servers, led by both our server and a contentious manager.

Two excellent margaritas later; the guacamole, salsa flight, swordfish tacos with fried taco shells that were so yummy the table next to us tried to steal them, and tilapia fish tacos with home made chips had me longing for a beach in Baja at sunset; and I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.

At this rate, they should consider purchasing the vacant lot next door...

The meal that I had today at Bien Trucha was seriously one of the best experiences I&#39;ve had in a long time. I was in the area running an errand, so the fiance and I decided to check this place off my bookmark list. So glad we did! We walked in around 1:00pm on a Thursday afternoon and were seated immediately which seems unheard of based on the reviews.

We ordered the limeade and hibiscus iced tea to start and both were refreshing and delicious. We were also given complimentary chips and a bean dip -- both very tasty. Our waiter mentioned the special guacamole that day had pears in it -- we were intrigued and had to order it. Yum! We also ordered the cazuelitas de camarones and bien trucha tacos, which are supposedly the best items on the menu. For our sides, we decided on the esquites (corn) and arroz poblano (rice). EVERYTHING was SO GOOD! As soon as I took my first bite, I was in heaven. I wish we had known about this place sooner so we could impress our friends who come to the suburbs to visit. Believe me when I say it is worth the trip to dine here. My fiance and I are from San Diego, land of the best Mexican food, and we were both very impressed with everything here.

I would be eating Mexican every day if this place was closer to my neighborhood.  Start with the Margarita&#39;s... fresh.  They muddle the limes with the tequila for one awesome drink. Tasted the strawberry as well and .. wow!  OK, on to the food.  Chips were good - the serve with some type of black bean dip.  Different, but decent.  

The plates are meant to share.  The tacos are 4 per plate so, if you come with 4 people, that&#39;s ideal (you don&#39;t want more because the place is small).  We sampled the lunch menu and had the following tacos... A La Diabla (spicy shrimp); Pescado (beer battered tilapia); Pastor (marinated pork); Pollo (crispy chicken - more like flautas than tacos)  And I love that i could sample one of each!  I would rank them, but I can&#39;t .. all a tie for first.

Service also was among the best I ever experienced.  The waters were constantly filled and the chips were constantly refilled.  As I am not often in Geneva, I hear there is a sister place with the same menu in Glen Ellyn which is a bit more drivable for me called Toda Madre... I cannot wait to check it out!"

I went here for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. I was surprised the restaurant was still pretty busy. There was about a ten minute wait but we decided to eat at the &#34;chef&#39;s table&#34; and we were seated right away. 

Our server (Lucy) described the handmade margaritas and I decided on the De Lujo margarita. The drink was not too sweet. $12 seems a little high for the size of this margarita but it had a great taste. 

I was very satisfied with the food! We started with the Bien Trucha tacos. The steak had a unique flavor and the roasted tomatillo salsa was perfect on top. 

The server suggested an order of Esquites (grilled corn, epazote butter, lemon aioli, queso cotinga, chile piquin). This is a great choice and will go with any menu item. We also ordered a Capitalina Torta. This is a sandwich with pork, cheese, pineapple, avocado, beans and aioli. 

Overall- They offer tasty food and I would love to go back if I&#39;m in Geneva. Heads up- they close at 3:00 and then reopen for dinner at 5:00. I would recommend getting there early if you&#39;re going for lunch."

Not this one! It totally lived up to every expectation I&#39;ve ever had. The first time I came here, I was starving and I ordered everything I can stuff in my pie hole. Everything was great and super tasty. So I went back the second time just in case I was just hungry the first time, I surely didn&#39;t want to give a place 5 stars for a possibly skewed review because I was starving. Oh man, the second time around was even better! 
Let&#39;s talk taco: bien Trucha, arrachera, and pescado tacos were very good. Bien Trucha and arrachera were made with the most tender and well marinated skirt steak. Pescado is made with breaded tilapia with red cabbage topping. All 3 were soooooo good! You&#39;ll get Turnt Up For Taco guaranteed! #TUFT
Pièce de rèsistance: shrimp cazuelitas. Oh. My. Gawd. To die for. MUST HAVE for sure. The explosion of flavor in this dish is to die for . Totally worth the drive wherever you&#39;re coming from. Best dish I&#39;ve ever had in my life!!! 
Sides: the rice and corn sides were amaze balls 
Drinks: too sweet for my taste. I recommend their sipping tequilas vs their sangria and margarita. 
MAKE YOUR RESERVATION! The wait is no joke. The place is super small and waiting at the bar is not the most ideal. 
Bien Trucha you really are on top of your game!"

The hype is real folks. The hype. Is. Real.

My husband and I came here for Cinco de Mayo this year. I of course have read amazing reviews on Yelp, so I decided what better time to check it out. I know Bien Trucha gets hella busy, so I made sure to make a reservation online. It was the morning of cinco de mayo when I checked their availability and luckily we were able to snag their last rezzy! I guess it was meant to be.

Although we arrived right on time (6:45 p.m.), I don&#39;t think we were actually seated until about 7. I kind of was prepared for this though, being the holiday and all. What I wasn&#39;t prepared for was the shuffle between two separate buildings. Thanks to Angela P.&#39;s review, I knew A Toda Madre was connected to BT and is basically the same thing so I wasn&#39;t too concerned. It was rather annoying though how the hostess at BT told us we&#39;d be seated faster next door, and then that host sent us back to where we originally were.

When this shuffle calmed down we still ended up sitting at the bar and ordering a drink until our table was ready. They had a $5 classic margarita special, so that kept me calm, cool, and collected while we waited. About 15 minutes later we were sat at a quaint 2 person table in the side room. Our waitress greeted us right away and was super helpful.

I love the ambiance of the restaurant (although pretty small). A wine bottle-esque pitcher of water was on the table, along with a candle, stylish plates and a simple menu. The scene is perfect for a date night or a girls night out.

We started with their classic guacamole and were also given complimentary pinto bean dip. Both were delicious and addicting. Their homemade tortilla chips stood out to me. I&#39;m not sure what it was, but they had the perfect crunch and were not over-salted. It&#39;s safe to say we accidentally filled up pretty well on these pre dinner snacks.

Their food is served basically tapas style, so we were instructed to order a few different things to share and they would come out one after another. I really like this concept, however when all was said and done the hubbie and I agreed that we ate too fast in anticipation of the next delicious item coming out!

We ordered as follows:

Cazuelitas de camarones -- sautéed shrimp, red onion, garlic, cilantro-chimichurri, and chihuahua cheese served with tortillas (this was basically a make-your-own quesadilla and it was amazing!)

Bien Trucha tacos (4) -- grilled skirt steak, chorizo, chihuahua, roasted tomatillo salso

Pescadillas tacos (4) -- shredded swordfish, epazote, crispy tortilla, avocado-habanero pico 

Everything was absolutely amazing. I&#39;m talkin every time either of us took a bite we did that like full mouth &#34;mm hhmm, that&#39;s really good&#34; nod to each other. I literally can&#39;t wait to come back. These are fresh and unique Mexican flavors I&#39;ve never had before. It&#39;s a modern Mexican menu so sure, I&#39;ve had more &#34;authentic feeling&#34; entrees, but Bien Trucha is something special.

Definitely go check &#39;em out. Like, NOW!"

Had the following

Ceviche of the day
It had lobster in it. Very good citrus flavor and the spice really sneaks up on you. Nice fresh starter

Guacamole traditional
Basic guacamole. It was fresh and the chips were nice and crispy

Bien Truca Taco
The steak was very tender and I loved the cheese in it. Full of flavor and definitely could have ordered some more of these

Pollo Taco
The tacos are fried into rolls and it reminded me of an eggroll with the crisp and texture. An unexpected dish. More like southwest eggrolls. Enjoyed this one as well

Barriga de Puerco
Pork belly with a lot of flavor. Solid taco. I would say I liked the above 2 better

The tacos here are very small about 2-3 bites and you are done. If you are going with a big group definitely recommend sharing if you like a variety of food. I do appreciate the creativity of this place with tacos and the food is full of brightness and flavor. Way better than some of the fancy mexican that I have had in the city

The only drawback was the crampness of the dining area and how the tables are so tiny. For a restaurant that focuses on small plate there needs to be table space to share that food."

Our tacos were outstanding! I made my husband swap one of his so we could try each other&#39;s dinner. I had the Bien Trucha steak tacos, while he had the Arrachera steak tacos. I don&#39;t know which ones were better!

We asked for a seat inside and there was no wait, we were seated right away. The waitress went over the menu since it was our first time here. We ordered Mangoneadas and they were delicious like mango smoothies! 

We ordered the monthly ceviche special with lobster! It was $15, which in my opinion is expensive for an appetizer, but it was very delicious! 

We ordered three taco dishes for the three of us: Hongos (mushrooms), Pescadillas (sword fish), and (Pescado). We also got a side of rice. Each taco platter comes with 4 tacos which were plenty and we were quite full by the end!

Overall, the restaurant was very good and the food was very flavorful. I highly recommend this place to everyone!"

Had to wait in the bar inside crowded and ordered drinks from a bartender that assumed I could read Mexican drink menus. Didn&#39;t seem too happy you have to explain what was in them. Ordered the favorite de lugo. Drink was very good and finally got a table outside. Crowded noisy and and excuses were given that they were busy as to why appetizers did not show on time and I asked if there was a better time that we should eat at your restaurant. I am vegan and there was a couple of options on the restaurant menu. End up ordering the Hongos.  This is a portobello mushroom taco. It was not exciting and rather plain. We ordered the de rajas con chorizo. It came out luke warm and not hot. Then ordered salsa and chips and had to order more chips twice as they forgot us. Ordered the Pollo, it was okay , looks better than it tasted. The overall experience was a 2-star although I&#39;m getting it 3 stars as my friend that loves this place brought me here and was surprisingly disappointed at the food and service so I am concluding that it may be an off-day, but have that many things go wrong I don&#39;t know. There are so many better places to eat in Geneva, I would really consider something else."
bien-trucha-geneva-2,Rose D.,FqHNMGc_-BgX4svll0SwLg,"Elgin, IL",1,1,1,241,21,TClSD0RRhr-3UrK9Yl-E_Q,3.0,2016-05-03,"I was hesitant to try Bien Trucha. Since whenever we happen to be in their area it&#39;s lunch time but they don&#39;t take reservations for lunch and the line is usually down the block...and places with a lot of &#34;OMG you MUST go there!&#34; hype tend to disappoint me.  A few years later the planets aligned to a rainy Saturday where we would be in Saint Charles.  I hoped the rain would work in our favor keeping the throngs at bay for a bit so we could give them a try for lunch.  We arrived right before opening and we were rewarded with immediate seating.  The place filled up within an hour of their opening, however - but there wasn&#39;t a line to get in so a crummy weather day is a good time to give them a try if you can&#39;t make it for a dinner rez time slot. 

I&#39;d say the food was 4 - 5 stars and the service was 1 - 3 stars so I&#39;m going to settle on 3 stars.  It&#39;s tapas style but they have teeny tables so plan on just ordering 1 - 2 things at a time.  We tried the Esquites (roasted corn - amazing &amp; my dining companion who normally doesn&#39;t like corn gobbled it up!), the Bien Trucha tacos (skirt steak &amp; chorizo) &amp; the Atun tacos (tuna) - both tacos were delicious.  We also tried 2 of the margaritias (the melon, a special that day, &amp; the avocado) &amp; the sangria - all were tasty but they really don&#39;t give you much at all and they don&#39;t give you much &#34;kick&#34; if you know what I mean, either.  If I&#39;m paying $9 (sangria) - $11/12 (margaritas) each I would like it to be a least a bit stronger.

Our server was kind and explained the menu to us and she checked on us regularly.  We had 2 gripes with the service.  One was right after our margaritias arrived my dining companion picked it up  to move it to the side and make room for the food and the glass just slipped right out of his hand.  I&#39;m not sure if it was a bit of grease from the tortilla chips or what but he picked it up &amp; the glass immediately slipped out and spilled all over the table &amp; him.  Now this occurred when a bus boy was watching 2 feet away &amp; our server was at the next table taking their order.  Not a single person came over to help clean up the mess and we had to ask the bus boy to bring us new napkins &amp; plates.  That was a rather irritating start so I&#39;m glad the food was delicious to even out their star rating.  The second gripe was regarding the small basket of tortilla chips &amp; a bean dip they bring you when you sit down.  We finished our chips &amp; still had half the bean dip left.  The bus boy took away our empty basket for chips &amp; left the bean dip but never brought any more chips.  I did overhear another table asking for chips so perhaps you have to ask? Just not sure why they wouldn&#39;t ask us if we wanted more chips (most servers at other places ask), especially if they are going to leave the bean dip on the table. 

After all is said and done I probably wouldn&#39;t bother going back.  Good to give them a try, at least, though."

The tacos came in miniature across a wood plank and my wife and I shared the tuna and swordfish tacos. The swordfish were spicy in a crunchy shell where the tuna was wonderful in soft shell with salad garnish. It was very busy but wait staff very friendly and attentive. We had fresh guacamole with chips while waiting for our entree. Everything was provided timely but never felt rushed. My wife enjoyed the mango water with her meal.

i made a reservation, which was nice so we did not have to wait (i don&#39;t think this place is worth waiting for). we  had the cerviche, which was delicious. i also had the sangria, which i highly recommend. we ate the pastor and diablo tacos which were outstanding. we had the flan for dessert, which was a nice way to end the meal.

bien-trucha-geneva-2,Tadd T.,huuu1f574-2IPlHsLmI2VA,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,147,145,j8Fdp7qo2RRJK81rjVwnRA,4.0,2015-11-08,"Very few restaurants make you stop mid-bite and think, &#34;Holy shit.&#34; Even fewer are such places outside of the fine-dining sector. So when I first crunched into a magnificently, impossibly fresh tuna taco adorned with baby arugula, celery aioli and avocado at Bien Trucha, an unassuming little joint on the edge of downtown Geneva, every expletive I knew shot through my head within a nanosecond. And the bill for guac, twelve tacos and four margaritas came to just about $80. (I wasn&#39;t dining alone, I swear!)

As I munched on house-made totopos and that exemplary guacamole, freshened with the tang of tomatillo, I thought, &#34;Could Rick Bayless somehow be behind this?&#34;

Nope. Turns out Mexico City-bred chef/owner Ricardo Garcia-Rubio, although a decades-long kitchen vet, had never garnered any kind of real attention or seen much success before opening Bien Trucha in 2007. Now, eight years later, after an expansion and much local and national acclaim, it seems Chef is right where he needs to be.

He&#39;s certainly farther away from Lakeview than I&#39;d like; I would eat at Bien almost every week if he were within a five-mile radius. I randomly crave those tuna tacos. Other times my mouth waters at the thought of crunchy tortillas stacked with juicy, epazote-scented swordfish and avocado-chile pico de gallo. Even the skirt steak tacos, slightly overshadowed by the oceanic treats, pop into mind. I even miss the simple but ridiculously addictive white rice, dotted with bits of roasted poblano and creamy-gooey with crema and Chihuahua cheese. 

My only complaint aside from distance is that the margaritas, while delicious (especially the cucumber &#34;Pepino&#34;), are rather small and low on booze. I may prefer my tequila drinks more bracing than most people, but these might not do the job for even the lightest-weight lightweight in your group. 

I suppose that means that, pocketbook permitting, you ought to have an extra cocktail. The experience is otherwise worth savoring."

It was recommended by a friend! We had a bad start to the experience as we had just gotten coffees while shopping and the employee who greeted us at the door told us we could not bring in any outside drinks. In a way, I guess it makes sense, but it&#39;s not like we were bringing in a bottle of wine or vodka. Besides, I think I ordered water anyways so it wouldn&#39;t have made a big deal. Anyways, aside from that our service was good and the food was great! I enjoyed the portion sizes of the tacos as it was just the right amount! It&#39;s tiny inside but the food is a big hit for your taste buds! We&#39;ll be back...I&#39;ll just be sure I save my coffee buying for later!"

It was quaint, great and amazing.  I went back last night with some friends and I was beyond excited. However, I have learned high expectations can lead to disappointing results. 

We went in, grabbed four drinks (at 50 dollars total... Am I back in bora bora?) and went outside to sit and wait for our table. I really liked having this option as I a quite am a people watcher.  Our table was called on time and we were brought to the building I ate at the first time. 

On to the order! 
They were out of cerviche, which was disappointing but it was also 830, so my bad.  We ordered pork belly, fish, steak, and pork tacos along with the corn and salsa. 

Everything was mediocre and the flavors were not what I remembered. I think what drove me the most crazy was that everything came out at the same time.  Even our chips and salsa. The tables are tiny there and there was no room for anything.  They had us take the tacos off the platters so they could take the platters away right then and there.  Thanks for the rush...   Maybe invest in a larger table? 

The neat thing was as we were leaving my friend spotted a semi famous celebrity couple eating there too."

Though the restaurant interior is a little dark, the pastor tacos are flavored brightly. Citrusy, juicy, oniony, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. The fruit guacamole and chicken tacos were also excellent, but the pastor tacos need more Yelp love. And here I thought I&#39;d only travel to Geneva for Swedish Days and ACK. Way to impress, Bien Trucha.

Food was okay, more fusion than authentic, very overpriced. Drinks were great.  Came in with my husband and girls. The kitchen refused to make modifications leave off topping ingredients my girls couldn&#39;t eat. Reason was the chef &#39;wants everyone to eat the dish the way he envisions it&#39;. There are no special request or modifications allowed.  It&#39;s great the chef has a vision, but this restaurant should find a way to accommodate younger humans and dietary restrictions....and be honest about what they are serving you.  Vegetarians beware as some of their &#39;veggie&#39; options are prepared with chicken stock...I found out after the fact.  Our waiter was extremely rude about any menu questions or requests....so rude he blew off our table and we almost left. Food was decent, service was intolerable.   This restaurant wants to be sophisticated a la downtown. Problem is, it&#39;s in Geneva where you can&#39;t get away with that attitude.  Won&#39;t be back.

This place is very small so if you aren&#39;t a fan of siting close together for dinner, I suggest visiting during patio season, there&#39;s a little more room out there. They start off your dining experience by bring a bean dip with chips. The bean dip seems to have a hint of chipotle and is tasty. The pepino margarita they have is too good. It is pricey, but it&#39;s one of those things that you don&#39;t feel guilty splurging on because it&#39;s delicious. The guacamole is a must. They do have a special guacamole (Guacamole del Dia) where fresh fruit is added, by chef&#39;s choice and we always try it and have never been disappointed. The tacos are flavorful and have unique combinations on them.( I would not describe them as authentic mexican tacos at all, but more of a taco with a modern twist) The Arrachera tacos are one of my favorites. It&#39;s steak with onions, avocado and salsa. If you don&#39;t mind paying a little more for a upscale feel, then this is the place for you. But if you&#39;re looking for authentic tacos, steer clear."

I was treating my daughters to a &#34;girls day out&#34; and the wait time was 15 minutes for a table so we decided to sit at the bar.  We were the only three at the bar the whole time.  The bartender/server placed three menus in front of us and we chose our meals.  He ignored us for the most part and when we asked him for an explanation of some of the menu headings in spanish, he would mumble an answer that none of us could make out.  Two of our dishes came out at the same time and when the third came out about 5-6 minutes later, my daughter said, &#34;oh, I didn&#39;t know it&#39;s fried&#34; and the bartender responded with &#34;did you read the menu?&#34;  Now looking at the meals description of &#34;pollo&#34; under Tacos it says &#34;crispy rolled&#34; which still doesn&#39;t explain the &#34;deep fried&#34; meal that was given to her.  She explained that she is pregnant and has indigestion issues and he walked away.  So, the food was good and the service was ridiculously near non-existent and in your face rude...which is ironic since he wasn&#39;t busy mixing drinks, helping other diners, etc.  He would tell our order to one of the other servers and then they would hand the dishes to him and he would place them in front of us.  Spoke to the manager and she said that if we were coming back that she would like to make it up to us...my question is, &#34;why would I come back?&#34;"

This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants ever and it is definitely worth the wait. Bien Trucha owns two buildings that are separated by their outdoor patio. One restaurant is for reservations and the other is seated on a first come first serve basis. I would strongly suggest that you make reservations as soon as possible as they get booked fast and sometimes it can take a month to reserve a prime time on a Friday or Saturday. 
We always have a large group and so we usually order pretty much everything on the menu. The drinks are phenomenal! My favorite of them all is the Ahuacatl. They give you complimentary homemade chips and bean dip and a must order is the salsa trio and the traditional guacamole. Another must order are the side dishes of rice and corn and the pescado tacos. I make it my mission to try fish tacos across the country and these are my favorite by far. Obviously with the amount of visits that I have had, I have tried just about everything on the menu and I have absolutely no complaints. Everything is delicious!"

They need to change that so i can try different things. Then they need to make more unique tacos still the same ones.

Free appetizer:  its frizoles and chips the chips are fresh not greasy seasoned well the beans are really good i just eat all the cheeze in it then i stop not to get too fool

Ceviche del mes: i ordered this twice both completely different the first time it was really unique sometjing i never had before this time it was more traditional but still amazing its gormea so it has high quality ingredients in it then i love the salad in the bottom its not diluted  with water like alot of mexican restaurants must order!

Cazulita de camarones: this is the best dish here its so good the shrimp are cooked perfectly the sauce is really rich but a lil sour the perfect balance. The cheese underneath is to die for its so good its like a mexican fondue i wish they put more shrimp in it though u have to order this

Barriga de puerco: this was really good the sauce was really good to but i like my pork belly fried and its not fried 

Pescado taco: this was the best taco i have ever eaten its perfectly fried really crispy not greasy perfectly cooked not overcooked or dried seasoned really well the coleslaw is so fricken good adds so much richness to make it so decadent.

Atun taco: its really crispy but not greasy seasoned really nicely the sauce was really good i wish there was more surprised there was alot of tuna fish the salad on top was really good just wish that there was coleslaw instead  really good though 

Soup: crema de chile poblano: omg this was so fucking good i didnt expect anything of it i just ordered it cause it was cheap wow did this have so much flavor it was so rich one of the best soups i ever had it had a lil bit of smokey flavor not alot perfect for cold days comes with bread but i used the chips for crunch. Theres cheeze and potatoes at the bottom needs more though

Brocheta de carne: its a mexican shish kabob. It was cookd perfectly it was medium rare and the vetables werent overcooked wasnt to burned either the dipping cause was good could be better though it needed salt though the seasoning wasnt that good wouldnt order again

Enchiladas: umm this was my least favorite it was way to sweet was more like a dessert. And tasted like the can mole to be honest idk if they used it but tasted really similar to it. 

Mexican Corn appetizer: i love mexican corn but this wasnt really that good it needed sAlt jus had no wow factor i had better

Arrachera taco: this was my least favorite taco it was to plain i tasted almost everything off the menu and this had no wow factor the bien trucha is a way better steak taco i wouldnt order this again

Bien trucha taco: this was my favorite steak taco here its so good. The steak is cooked perfectly supper tender and flavorful. I love the cheese theres alot which is good. Then the salsa on top is so delicous not spicy just the right balance. Then theres chorizo on it which makes it even better not burned! Or really greasy.

Oysters: really fresh really delicious just i wish there was more condiments like horshradish theres just a black sauce and a red sauce needs a wow factor

Churros: this was my least favorite thing i ate here they were overfried and no sugar or cinnamon on any of them i had to ask for it.

Key lime pie: i hate key lime pie i dont really like things really sour but this was so fucking good it wasnt sour at all  the icecream was perfect not overturned not to sweet perfect texture. The crust at the bottom was supper crispy added alot of texture then theres  meringue that is blow torched so good not to sweet. Must order 

Corn cake: u have to order this one of the best desserts of my life u have to order this supper moist and flavorful the sauce is to die for theres tequila in it that really enhances the flavor of the cake its amaizing u have to get it"

Now, I&#39;m on a mission to try them ALL! I had heard about Bien Trucha being similar to Altiro Latin Fusion. I loved Altiro so I had to give this one a try. My boyfriend made reservations here for 8:15 on a Saturday night. The location is convenient and the two buildings are a cute idea. We arrived about 15 mins early and our table wasn&#39;t ready yet (which was fine). We just weren&#39;t aware at how small the inside was. We were left standing by the door dodging out of the server&#39;s way. On a busy Saturday night, there&#39;s really no room for people waiting for tables. Which may be the charm of it all...?

Anyway, we were seated soon enough and the atmosphere was loud and lively. No complaints. There was music in the background. Dining here kind of feels like you&#39;re in the inner city somewhere. The servers were busy so there wasn&#39;t much talk besides taking our order which is fine. They did bring out complimentary chips and bean dip. So good and so fresh. That was a nice treat. We started with the Cazuelita de camarones. I have to say, these are delicious, however, Altiro has a similar dish and I did enjoy it more there. For our entrees, we ordered the tacos de pastor and tacos de bien trucha. The pastor tacos were too spicy for me but if you like spicy then you&#39;ll love these. The bien trucha tacos were the best bite of the night. They were full of flavor and left you wanting more. I&#39;d definitely like to come back especially during warmer weather to sit out in the patio. :)"

When we first moved here, the word on the street was that this was the best in town.  While I will say that we enjoyed our time here, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d go out of my way to go back.  This is because, like other reviewers, I found the place to be a bit pretentious and over-priced.  The food was fantastic, although I would have expected almost twice the amount of food I got for the price I paid.  (More because of the portion sizes are very small).  Also, I would agree that I felt rushed to eat/leave, and don&#39;t even bother trying to bring kids.

That being said, the corn and rice was some of the best I have ever had.  If this environment sounds like your cup of tea you won&#39;t be disappointed.  Just be prepared for what&#39;s in store for your visit."

I have eaten at this restaurant prior and it is amazing. I was truely dying to go back and was very excited the patio opened. Having said that the first two times I dined there I was pregnant the third my baby was very young and still in her infant car seat. 
On his particular evening we arrived and the hostess said it was 30-60 min wait. Mind you we tried to call for call ahead seating and the line was no response. I did mention this upon arrival and the answer I received was that they only have three phone lines so if all are in use they can&#39;t accommodate. We said ok we&#39;ll wait. I went to use the washroom and when I returned my husband was already seated. So about 5 minutes. Strange to say the least. They brought me to the table my husband and daughter were at. My daughter is 1 1/2. She was sitting on his lap. He said they don&#39;t have high chairs or boosters. (Something they should have told me from the beginning) ok fine this isn&#39;t going to work I thought. We left. I mentioned to the hostess on the way out I&#39;m sorry you don&#39;t have high chairs. We can&#39;t stay. 
There wasn&#39;t this sincere apology or anything of the sort. I almost felt like they were happy. I was truely disappointed and felt like it was because of our daughter. If kids aren&#39;t allowed then have a sign and post that. We dine out with our baby all the time. She is very well behaved. I mean who doesn&#39;t have high chairs.

Glad they don&#39;t up charge the beer too much as an &#34;import&#34;. Margaritas starting at $9 and up to $12. Well, it&#39;s all fresh and mostly organic ingredients so I feel it&#39;s worth it. 

Chips and bean dip delivered complimentary. Very fresh. We ordered the guacamole as I tend to judge a place like this based solely on how fresh it is. NICELY done. We actually watched them prepare it. My wife ordered the special. Yellowfin snapper that was butterflied and grilled. Simply seasoned and perfect. Grilled lemon was a nice touch. Came with a red cabbage salad and tortillas. Delicious. 
I ordered the Pastor tacos. Very, very good. 

The place has a cool vibe. Very clean and noisy for what you&#39;d expect on a Friday night. They even have an outdoor patio area with heat lamps and shade sails. Wife reports that the bathroom was clean as well. A true gem for the suburbs. If you choose to skip this place, great. It&#39;ll just be less of a wait for others that want an authentic Mexican dining experience."

The hostess was so kind and impeccably presented with hair, makeup, &amp; a great attitude. They have a paging system so you can rest easy as you are waiting for your table. It was SUPER busy,  from putting in our name to eating, everything was run flawlessly. 

At the end of our visit, the manager was so wonderful to my daughter. He was approachable and so kind! 

I don&#39;t recommend bringing your child/ren if they are sensitive to crowds &amp; loud music, HOWEVER, the staff was MORE than happy to accommodate us. (that is just a mommy suggestion).

Food was quick and tasty and service was great!

If you are in a hurry, this is not your restaurant, as the servings are presented tapas style.   After trying several selections, we would highly recommend the pescado, atun, pescadillas and pastor tacos.

We had the guacamole, special ceviche (tuna), BT, Pescado and Pork Belly tacos, corn and thus amazing cheese fondito with chorizo.

This three star review is simply because of a simple &#34;we can&#39;t do that.&#34; I asked to have a Mojito made without the rum...I even went through the special drink menu to find the drink with the least amount of alcohol to make it uncomplicated. When I asked our waitress if they could make it &#34;virgin&#34; she said that they can&#39;t because they want to keep the consistency the same with all their drinks/food. What?! The funny thing is they would make me another special drink that was nonalcoholic but add mint for $1.00....does that make sense at all?! So you can compromise the taste of one drink but not another?

It&#39;s disappointing because as someone who might not always want a cocktail it is nice to see restaurants be accommodating especially with such simple requests....and kind of stupid when they arent."

Atmosphere. Deep house music over the PA system. Nice! Outdoor seating with couches while you wait to be seated.

Food. I was expecting a larger menu but it turns out all they do is gourmet tacos and a few sides along with the typical salsas. Everything we had tasted very good.

Service: It was good. Nice, friendly waiter.

What I didn&#39;t like:

It&#39;s a little pricey but hey, it&#39;s Geneva and we just got back from Vegas so we knew weren&#39;t gonna get taqueria or Taco Bell prices. I thought the size of the tacos was OK. They weren&#39;t big but they hit the spot. Ordered a habanero salsa and I got an ounce and a half for $5. Ouch. Was expecting more items on the menu such as entrees considering all the buzz this place has but now I know if and when I go back not to expect more than tacos.

I would go back if I felt like gourmet tacos and wanted to eat outside with a group. I wouldn&#39;t go if i wanted authentic Mexican food in the form of entrees.

Edit. When I got my receipt, the habanero salsa was $2. I must have remembered the price on the menu which was $5."

I thoroughly enjoy every bite I put in my mouth at this lovely establishment. This last visit we started with a salad that was just heavenly: arugula, Granny Smith apples, cheese, nuts and some delicious lemony dressing. We also had the Bien Trucha tacos again and the Pescado and Pastor tacos, which were both amazing. The pork belly tacos were our 4th choice and to me, fell short of expectations since they weren&#39;t as crispy as I typically like. Service was great.

We were literally out the door in 30 mins. This included drinks, guacamole &amp; entrees. 

For those wanting to try it out, the pepino margarita is really good, as is the a la diabla (shrimp tacos). Guac was mango today--another winner. 

The place was nearly empty at 5p on a Tuesday, however that didn&#39;t stop the waiter from rushing &amp; the bus staff clearing each plate before we set it down. Rushing with a long wait list on a weekend? Passable. But on a Tuesday when it&#39;s deserted?

The first time you ride a bike, your wedding day, the birth of your children. Now add to the list, the first time you try Bien Trucha. 

Even with all the food options of Chicago, the modern house-turned-restaurant stole the show.

After being seated quickly my server suggested a few options and I settled on the Bien Trucha tacos (I figured it has to be good if they named the restaurant after it) and the Esquites, a mixture of roasted corn, epazote-butter, spices and lemon juice. It&#39;s hard to live up to the hype of the 29 Zagat score posted at the door and all the other reviews you have surely read below, but I&#39;m here to tell you it was far exceeded. The flavor was amazing. To the point I brought my wife back THE SAME DAY for dinner. Which you better be early to because by the time 5:00 PM rolls around there is a line of 30+ people. 

Regardless of what you choose to get, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE get the Esquites. You can put it on any taco and its guaranteed to knock your socks off. Take a bite, BOOM, no socks. 

Bottom line- Bien Trucha is worth any wait, any drive, and sort of service. It is that good."

Things I suggest if you&#39;ve never been:
Manzana salad: I LOVE arugula &amp; this is one of my all time favorite salads, period.
Bien Trucha tacos: tender skirt steak, great flavors
Pescadillas tacos: swordfish, crispy tortilla, fresh salsa
Esquites: amazing grilled corn (cut off the cob), with cheese
Pica-Pica: bbq shrimp wrapped in bacon w/onion &amp; pineapple 

Only negative- seating is TIGHT, so adjust your expectations on that front.

Their sister restaurant &#39;a toda madre&#39; in Glen Ellyn is great as well, but if I&#39;m picking one or the other..it&#39;s Bien Trucha that takes the cake."

Upon walking in the its just a normal hotel (La Meridian), but go up to the 9th floor is a very nice lounge area. they had very comfy seating at the bar and also around the area from dining tables to nice couches. The view outside the window is a strip of the Oakbrook mall food row and in the distance other tall building where some of them even light up at night.

The service was very delightful, the servers brought drinks and was able to explain what the food was so that we would know what we were eating. They were also around alot to make sure the area was clean as even had an conversation with us for a bit. I can say the staff was indeed really friend and helpful.

Now on to the most important part, the food, was exceptional. all the food I was able to try was indeed delicious and dishes i don&#39;t try often. Mainly as expected from the name itself the food type was tapas. Mm they had so many different choices for us to try. A few of the highlights was the albondigas, which was a lamb and bacon meatball it was so flavorful along with the sauces. The Sopa De Calabasa was also very interesting because it came in a shot glass looking cup which was a really original was in it own to give out soup, Finally the best part of it all was the paellas, there were 2 different types, Arroz Negro Con Mariscos and Paella De Pollo. Thee Paella de pollo was very nice it was just a bit salty. The arroz negro con mariscos was the highly the black rice was a great complement to the other flavors and seafood that was in the dish. truly wonderful.

Overall if you are looking for a light meal and drinks after shopping or just around the area. this is the place to go just for that."

The decor is dark, sleek and modern. We stopped for wine and small plates before a show at Drury Lane, and had a hard time choosing a few appetizers. The server suggested the croquetas de setas - crimini mushroom fritters &amp; cilantro yogurt. They were delicious! 

Our wine was a 2013 Bodegas Atteca Garnacha. We also had a poached-pear salad and then a cheese and cured meats platter. The fuet was a standout on the platter - it was a sort of salami mousse, which blended perfectly with the coarse-grained mustard. The la peral blue cheese was wonderful with a bit of honeycomb and black fig. We will certainly have to come back for the El Cerdo Mixta dinner - pork belly, pork flap, chicharrones, onion, toasted carrot purée + mustard jus."

We really enjoyed everything! The menu was prix fixe and my date and I chose different items and we both loved everything we had picked. Portions were large (we went home with leftovers) and the beverages were tasty. We loved the variety the menu offered (definitely something for everyone!) and our choices were deliiiiicious.

My picks included:
-Appetizer -- Ensalada de Pera: a baby spinach salad with rioja wine poached pears, blue cheese, and toasted almonds. This was AWESOME. And huge! It was served on a dinner plate [see pic].
-Entree -- Carne Asada: 3 pieces of skirt steak (which was melt in your mouth tender and perfectly medium rare like I requested) with tons of arugula, a flavorful piquillo pepper sauce, and covered in manchego cheese. This was also awesome! A really flavorful steak dish. Loved it.
-Dessert -- Panna Cotta de Coco: this left more to be desired. It wasn&#39;t very sweet and overall was just ok. Beautifull presented coconut panna cotta with pieces of an olive oil cake, pineapple, and thin hazelnut tuile pieces.

We also enjoyed red and white wine sangria during our dinner and it was delightful! Full of fruit, not overly sweet but very flavorful, and served to the top of a large wine glass.

The atmosphere is really nice, too. El Tapeo is located on the 9th floor of Le Meridien hotel. The far side is filled with tables, but the bar area has low couches for a lounge vibe. It would be both a great place to grab dinner or just drinks!

Overall, we really enjoyed the meal here! The rest of the New Years Eve experience was, well, definitely lackluster to say the least. But the meal was great, and that&#39;s what counts for this review. :)"

The food was amazing.  Everything tasted good, the flavors were fantastic and seasoned perfectly.  I actually caught myself trying to eat tiny little pieces left on the plate because I couldn&#39;t get enough.

Atmosphere;  its on the top floor of a new chic hotel in Oakbrook overlooking the mall and great views of corporate buildings and landscape.

Inside it feels upscale and hip.  We didn&#39;t stay late, but it seems like the kind of place you could hang out at all night.  Feels a little like a club, and there was a DJ setting up when we left.

Must Try!"

The location also makes it a nice place to go for dinner either before or after a show at Drury Lane.  And it was very nice to dine at a tapas restaurant that wasn&#39;t boisterously loud for a change - perfect for a nice little romantic dinner!  Their menu, while it isn&#39;t expansive, has a decent selection of quality tapas, salads, a handful of entrees &amp; charcuterie/fromage platter options (that&#39;s fancy talk for a meat &amp; cheese tray, hehe) to choose from.  They also have a large wine menu and a variety of cocktails &amp; beers to wet your whistle.

Our server, Joe, was great, and the service was cordial and attentive with several other staff members seamlessly working as a team to bring out our dishes, etc.  Our water glasses never went below half-full and I was asked if I would like another glass of wine just before I had finished my first glass (lately most other places either never ask me once my wine glass is empty or they say they&#39;ll bring me another &amp; then forget).  Our food selections were very quite delicious and we tried the charcuterie/fromage platter (we selected 2 meats &amp; 2 cheeses from the choices &amp; it came with some bread/crackers, honeycomb, almonds, olives &amp; some little peppers), the shrimp croquettes, tuna foie gras and the lump crab meat salad.  These were all tapas so the servings were smaller of course but just the right amount to share and try a variety of things without feeling overstuffed.  The prices on what we ordered, for the most part, was reasonable compared with other tapas places, though I think the lump crab salad was a bit much at $18 for 1/3 Cup of crab salad.

The datiles and albondigas weren&#39;t anything special and I regret ordering the atun foie gras as I don&#39;t think the flavors went well together and the lemon/olive combo completely overpowered the dish. The crema catalana and leche frita we had for dessert were very good, but the star of the meal was the charcuterie board we ordered. You can pick a combination of any 4 meats/cheeses and it&#39;s served with bread, whole grain mustard, olives, and honeycomb.

It was nice that we didn&#39;t have to make a reservation on a Friday night, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re used to being busy, as it seemed like the servers got completely overwhelmed when there were more than 5 tables. I agree with others that the views are great and it&#39;s a nice spot for a date night. We came here because we wanted to try something new and I don&#39;t regret coming, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be back.

We ended up with cocktails due to the wine being so $$$, and the waitress was nice enough to let us taste a few wines they had by glass, when we told her one was past when it should be served due to a terrible musty smell, she told us it can&#39;t possibly be bad cause it didn&#39;t smell like vinegar when she poured it (?). Huh?

The food is average to bland. I wouldn&#39;t eat here again.

We ordered a fired pepper thing that must have been a special as I don&#39;t see it when I reviewed the menu to write this review... bland, just no flavor at all.

The &#34;meat and cheese&#34; board was ok, not amazing. The tiny lamb meatballs were ok but a strange not so good tasting bright orange sauce was served with them.

We love bacon wrapped dates- who who fries them, instead of baking? The others on the menu were fried.  we inquired about it - not no good answer and decided to insist they were baked, despite it taking longer in the kitchen.

The staff is very good from my experiences here. I like how attentive and personable they are, being friendly and starting conversations. 

I can speak to some of the tapas and dishes. Seafood paella- awesome! So many different shellfish including muscles, clams, shrimp, and lobster, and it had great fresh seasoning! I would also recommend the dates- a classic Spanish tapas dish. 

The gambas were good shrimp, but a little TOO garlicy. I didn&#39;t realize that &#34;garlic chips&#34; were actually slices of garlic cloves! It looked like shredded cabbage to me on top of the shrimp, and I ate a whole pile of them! LOL, that was the biggest dose of garlic that I&#39;ve had in my entire life. I will never have to worry about my cholesterol with that one down the hatch. 

Their drinks are awesome here, which is the reason why I return. The mixed drinks are delicious, unique, and stiff. The sangria is home-made and some of the best I&#39;ve ever had with a fresh, crisp flavor. I love the red sangria; the white is good too, but the red is the best.

The yelp! event was well organized and full. We played an ice breaker event that encouraged us to get to know one another  

Throughout the evening we were served a large variety of tastes from their tapas menu. Everything was wonderful. I think my favorite was the crab meat on toast points. Yum! 

I did want to try a few other offerings from the menu so we ordered the lamb meat balls and bacon wrapped dates. Everything was delicious!

I tried both sangria flavors. The white was sweet and light. The red was dry (I asked they make it with Cab). Both were good. My only would be the bar stools, way too high and they lean back too much.

We started off our meal with a magnificent cheese/meat spread with some crunchies. I simply adored it. I know my reviews are getting a bit repetitious because I get this type of app so many places but it was magnificent.

During this time the restaurant was slowly filling up but never did it get really noisy. By coming early we also had a great table by the window with a view of, well, the street. Still it was fun!

For the entree, my husband and I split the paella. Have I mentioned how much I love paella? This one was a great one to share, not too small, not too big. We ate every morsel.

We had play tickets at Drury Lane at 8:00 so we left without having dessert or coffee about 7:15 as we had to walk to the garage, drive about 500 feet, repark, etc. As it was our first time at Drury Lane, we wanted to be sure to be on time, etc. Now that we know the routine, we can leave a bit later or come a bit earlier.

I want to try their desserts and those 1,000 points were pretty fabulous as well."

The yelp event was awesome. Love that I finally got to see this place and how pretty it is. It&#39;s open til 12 on weekdays which is awesome bc I think the only other place that&#39;s open late in the area is Cheesecake Factory and that closes at 11 on wkdays. 

Anyways, we had some samples of their tapas menu and also the paella. Paella was alright but the the things I loved the most were the gambas (shrimp sautéed w garlic) and the salpicon cangrejo - jumbo crab meat with blood orange something - so good! Will definitely be back to try more of their tapas and entrees! 

I have to say, the service was amazing here as well. I came a second time just to hang with a friend late night and also received fabulous service even though it was almost closing time. 

Thank you to the awesome yelp elite squad for organizing this event- now I know where my go-to spot will be for late nights since I live right down the road!!"

I&#39;m not gonna lie, I have been going to Oakbrook mall for years and have circled around the parking lot but have never seen this restaurant and would probably have never seen it until it was featured in Restaurant Week. It&#39;s on the 9th floor of Le Meredien. I&#39;m so glad I tried it with my husband last night to kick start Restaurant week! 

I recommend: bacon wrapped dates and grilled cod!

We love this place and plan on taking our parents here next time."

The paraisa (habiscus infused vodka drink) was amazing and had a hint of elder berry liqueur in it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

We tried the patatas bravas which were perfectly crisp and delightful. The PULPO or octopus was cooked to perfection with a slight charred black pepper taste and fresh melt in your mouth inside. Served with a side of cilantro paste which was elegant and spicy!

The mushroom fritters or Croquetas de Setas were my favorite on the menu as they were light, crispy, smooth on the inside, very fine chopped and soothing mushrooms, and served my personal favorite cilantro yogurt which definitely hit the spot. 

The pimientos or shishito peppers were amazing. Very light and an easy way to ease into the meal. I recommend this plate as a nice way to start your night. 

Gambas or shrimp were buttery and extremely fresh. I am a big fan of garlic and the addition of garlic chips mixed with a slight cilantro finish was an amazing touch. 

Our wait staff was courteous, friendly, helpful, and very accommodating. Server even brought us desert on the house which was a cinnamon brandy glazed ice-cream with ginger infused pineapples and 2 churro donuts. AN ABSOLUTE WORLD OF FLAVORS THAT LEFT US MOUTH WATERING AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE!

DEFINATELY PLAN ON GOING BACK. RESTAURANT AMBIANCE IS AWESOME AND GIVES A CITY FEEL IN A BURBS. LOCATED ON THE 9TH FLOOR OF THE LE MERIDEAN HOTEL. 

Valet parking available for $5 however, plenty of self park around the side.... save your money!"

We showed up 15 minutes early for our 7:30 reservation, while they had valet, we were able to park very close without any trouble. We took the elevator to the 9th floor and were greeted by excellent views of the surrounding suburbs. The restaurant is put together very well. A nice, romantic candlelit environment. We met our waiter and placed our drink order. 

Drinks - 
La Jefa - tito&#39;s vodka, blood orange liquor, blackberry simple syrup, sage liquor &amp; fresh lemon juice - this beverage was excellent, quite smooth 7/10
Mediterranean Pink Lady - nolets dry gin, cointreau, campari, limoncello, egg whites &amp; fresh lemon juice - this drink was very bitter, the server asked how we liked it, we told him such and he quickly offered to let us take another spin on the drinks menu 4/10
Paraiso - absolut hibiskus, pomegranate vodka, st. germain, rhubarb liquor, apricot preserves &amp; fresh lemon juice - this was the clear winner of the 3 we tried, would absolutely order this again 9/10
Blanco Sangria - white wine, citron vodka, elderflower liqueur, simple syrup, fresh lemon &amp; lime juice - we got a pitcher to handle the rest of dinner and that was an excellent choice 9/10

While we were enjoying our drinks the chef came out to introduce himself and left us some of his recommendations on what direction to take with the menu. I am usually confused when it comes to tapas, I liken it to my experience at taco bell, I end up tacking on 3-5 things I don&#39;t need but end up eating anyways. So between him and the waiter their advice was excellent. 

Tapas - 
Pulpo - octopus - very tasty, I wish the lime dressing was more pronounced 6/10
Datiles - dates - bacon, marcona almonds, wrapped in cherrywood bacon = yes please 8/10
Croquetas de setas - mushroom fritters, very tasty little bites paired with a tasty dipping sauce 6.5/10

embutidos y quesos
Pata Negra Jamon - some of the most amazing iberico ham I have ever had 11/10

sopas y ensaladas 
Salpicon cangrejo de mar - lump crab salad, the bread was excellent and the crab salad too was excellent, the avocado and blood orange gelle just added to the experience 8/10

mariscoc y carnes
Paella de marisco - a memorable paella, all of the seafood was fresh, and cooked perfectly, I am excited to have this dish on our next trip here 8.5/10

verduras
Setas - garlic mushrooms with cana de cabra cheese on top, I literally ate this by the forkful, I couldn&#39;t stop! 8.5/10
Patatas bravas - great side, I could have used a bit more spice (although I am a huge fan of the spicy!) 7/10

at this point in the evening I was extremely full and enjoying life then the waiter presented us with the dessert menu....well my mother always said save room for dessert.....soooo without further adieu....  

dulces
Pastel de chocolate - molten chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream, nutella powder and brulee banana, this was excellent, the bananas were excellent, the molten chocolate - gimmie more 10/10
Pastel de queso manchego - cheesecake with raspberry gel and sorbet, I love cheesecake so this was a no brainer, a very well put together dessert but with the shining star of the chocolate cake it&#39;s a tough task to overcome 7.5/10

espresso - illy espresso and I loved every sip 10/10

We were here for a total of about 3 hours, we never felt rushed, the staff kept checking on us, my water was promptly refilled as soon as it went below 3/4 full, we were given new plates between almost every dish. We got to enjoy our meal. I have spent time in the Mediterranean and this meal gave me the exact same feeling. I will be back and recommend anyone looking to slow down and enjoy an evening to give El Tapeo a try."

Tips are an acknowledgement for great service for the time spent at that very moment. But when people stop in there busy life and make a point on how great of an experience they had that means something. There&#39;s a reason why the El Tapeo Restaurant is the best Hidden Gem in the Western Suburbs. They there cuisine is exceptional and they know there clientele. Because the restaurant is in a hotel the audience varies from travelers who are away from home and are looking for a place to feel comfortable and the locals who know they have found there special place. It&#39;s obivous that management knows how to accomidate for both.

There are plenty of &#34;Branded&#34; Restaurants in the Oak Brook Mall, which is fine. It&#39;s not until you find that &#34;Hidden Gem&#34; and you don&#39;t want to disclose the location in fear you won&#39;t get in. Sorry, El Tapeo for giving you up!

On a second note I want to acknowledge the LeMeridian. My last visit was a 4 day stay and all I can say is I felt like I was part of the family. Everyone remembered my name and was so accommodating. If you are from the area looking for a weekend escape or traveling I would recommend the LeMeridian Oak Brook. See my other great review on the LeMeridian Oak Brook ."

All of the food here is Tapas (Small Spanish plates for sharing). 

Tonight I ordered the Mussels, Octopus, Deviled eggs, and Cheese plate. My favorite out of these would have to be the Octopus. The Octopus is a room temperature dish with a creamy potato topping. Some may think it&#39;s on the salty side...but I liked it!  The cheese plate was also great with a variety of bleu, goat, manchego, fig, and olives. Also, a dark colored mustard came with the cheese plate. It was delicious.  

Equally important, the service was excellent! Our waiter knew the menu very well for the restaurant only being open for it&#39;s 2nd day ever!

The food was good but atmosphere was a bit cold. I like my lounges to be lounge worthy... This one not so much. Bar stools were not comfortable and to couch/group seating felt like you were in a hallway. Couches as well were boxy/modern and not very comfortable as well. On the plus side, great tasting tapas and live music kept us hanging for a while."

OK I don&#39;t know where to start so I&#39;ll just start from the beginning. First for a Saturday night in Oakbrook parking was just a dream, we parked in the parking garage right behind the Le Meridien hotel found a spot very easily got out and proceeded into the hotel passing the El Tapeo sign outside. When we got in we followed the red and yellow paint colors on the pillars, I&#39;m assuming since they were the colors of the sign they were directing us to the restaurant. After a short elevator ride we reached the 9th floor.

We&#39;re here! The elevator doors opened the sound of some techno and deep house music played by the resident dj. We were immediately greeted by the cutest little hostess, she informed us that our table would be ready in a few mins. No problem cause we always show up early for our reservations. We then proceeded to the bar for pre dinner cocktails. I had the old fashion because well, I&#39;m old fashioned, she had the sangria. The bartenders were very nice.There was a man and a woman working behind the bar, they seemed very busy but were very attentive. The old fashion had just the right amount of sweet to it and didn&#39;t overpower the bourbon at all. My wife said the Red Sangria was, just right. The drinks were $13 each but well worth it cause some obvious care was put into making these cocktail. The lounge was pretty full with a nice ambiance.
The hostess came over to tell us our table was ready.
We thanked the bartenders for their service and closed out our check.
We were seated right by the window with a view of the Chicago skyline in the distance. We were greeted promptly by a young lady who asked if we had been here before? No we replied. She was very informative, told us that everything was served family style and proceeded to tell us the specials for the evening. 
We started with the shishito peppers the gambas and the bacon wrapped dates, which I have to say were my personal favorite, it was nice to see them fried for a change it gives the bacon that extra crisp as opposed to baking them.
The wine list was a nice size not too overwhelming and priced just right. We ordered a bottle of Prisoner red blend.
We then ordered the Pata Negra Jamon which was a little pricy but hey you only live once. It was brought out by a man who identified himself as one of the sous chefs and sliced table side with greatest of ease. It was very good and just melted in our mouths.
For dinner we had the cobia and the Paella. Everything was totally on point the cooks had everything perfect that night. It was a delicious seafood treat.
A man then came by, told us he was the manager, asked us how everything was, and told us to enjoy our night.
We finished the dinner with yet another glass of wine and the Leche Frita kind of like fried ice cream but far more delectable.
We then payed our bill and continued back to the lounge where we danced the night away with cocktails in hand.
Overall a very good experience. Everything was perfect from the hostess to the bar, servers, bussboys, cooks etc... I highly recommend this place! It can&#39;t be beat!"

I worked with the Event Planner, Sonia, who was super sweet and answered back to my emails and phone calls promptly. 

The day of the party, everything ran pretty smoothly. The waitress seemed a little overwhelmed and would forget about our order sometimes, but we were all in good spirits so it didn&#39;t bother us that much. What I will say, is coming here you need to be fully aware of the menu along with being open to trying new things. I feel that this is a better date night experience than a 10+ group experience.

Overall, it was a good night."

Had carne asada as main menu.  Also very good...  Now the real reason only giving it 2 stars.. The noise from the people  made talking with each other a challenge...
When leaving, the main comments from my friends was the noise.... When I pay top dollar for food I expect to at least not have to shout to my friend to hear me....serious effort of the restaurant should be made to baffle the noise. Won&#39;t go back again till that issue is resolved..."

Ambiance was nice, very well decorated and the bar area is very trendy, though the live music was a bit loud for its close location to the bar - maybe turn the speakers down a bit?  In fairness, it was a Saturday night, and the music was not so loud once we were seated because the tables are farther away.

The food was OK good; tapas dishes were flavorful but nothing had an over-the-top wow factor, just good.  We ordered the bacon and pumpkin croquettes, which were good but not super terrific; then the fingerling potatoes, which were the best of any hot tapa we ordered.  The Gambas, like the croquettes, were good but not great.  Also ordered a very good salami tapas, which left me wishing we had ordered more of the many cured meats options.

Here&#39;s the bad news - the paella was really not that good, and for a Spanish restaurant, that seems unforgiveable to me.  The seafood was all steamed separately from the rice and chorizo base, so that none of the seafood had any flavor of the paella.  This is not the way to make paella, people.  Also, the rice base almost had a risotto texture of creaminess, instead of a crumbly consistency as true paella should have.  Overall, this was a big miss.

Second miss was the service.  Our server was very nice and knowledgeable, when she was around, but she hardly ever came by once the dishes were served.  It would have been nice to have more attention to see how we liked things and to get our feedback if anything else was needed, and doubly nice not to have waited almost 15 minutes to get the bill.

The drinks were the best part - my old fashioned was one of the best I&#39;ve had recently - great bourbon and a very artful presentation with a single ice block in the glass, though a bit pricey at $13.

I will return, for the drinks and more of the cured meats (lots of other options that we did not have the room to try), but don&#39;t come for the paella.

I do recommend the albondigas as an appetizer. The croquetas de setas were bland and definitely need copious amounts of the cilantro dressing for flavor. The ensalada de pera was a good choice in salads, but the ensalada de tomate was not impressive and I was disappointed in the fried avocado. For entrees the carne asada was too dry, but the Cordero was quite good. Neither the remolachas or the patatas bravas were worth ordering again. For desert we had the leche frita, which is worth getting again. Overall, nice atmosphere, decent food if you know what to order, but a bit overpriced."

What was fantastic was their white sangria, service and ambiance.  

What my hubby and I ordered:

Mejillones en Escabeche - this was my second favorite dish of the night, very fresh and tasted great,not to vinegary

Croquetas de Pollo - okay - easily something to pass over and not order

Sopa de Calabasa - very thick ... makes you wish they gave you a bread basket to help you eat it, but good

Setas - deliciously oily?  too oily actually, but tasted good

Patatas Bravas - easily the best dish of the night, the only thing I would order again

The restaurant has a nice almost romantic ambience. It is situated on 9th floor of Le Meridien Hotel so it has quite a  nice view at Oak Brook Terrace Mall and surroundings. At first the restaurant was not crowded but later on the crowd filled in. we took some tapas: fingerling potatoes were amazing and octopus was one of the best we have ever had. We took a bottle of wine for around $50 which was a little bit overpriced in my opinion. Next we ordered shrimps: cooked ideally but they lacked some seasonings. As for the main dish my wife took scallops with lentils and they were done very well, not overcooked with a subtle marriage with lentils, tomatoes and delicate sauce. I took lamb chops coooked to my preference (medium rare) , the only negative thing I can say the had a little bit too much fat in them but overall very good dish to try. As for the dessert we had delicious panna cotas. After dinner we tried some drinks at the bar and the were very well done with good portion of alcohol on it. I am an old fashioned fan and I judge good bar by properly made old fashioned and this one was definitely good. On this day they also had a DJ with live music and I cannot say if they have it every Saturday but we will definitely visit again to check it out :) After a pleasure evening we stayed in the hotel which I recommend as well especially if you plan to drink few more drinks."

It is an upscale Spanish restaurant featuring tapas and main courses.  The setting is on the 9th floor and has very nice views of the suburban Oak Brook area.  The restaurant is very sleek, modern and stylish... think Vegas as opposed to Seville.    A lounge and bar area are adjacent the dining room and look like a very inviting places to have a cocktail and a snack.  The clientele is also attractive, such as it is after a day of shopping at the posh stores of Oak Brook Center.

We ordered a selection of menu items to share.  The tapas selection is small and has most of the typical items.  Dates w/ bacon, deep fried things, etc.  We tried the deviled egg with tuna and the shellfish fritters with piquillo pepper sauce.  Both were decent but nothing to write home about.  

The poached pear salad with baby spinach, blue cheese and almonds was tasty if unexciting.  The crab salad with avocado and blood orange gelee was very good; the blood orange was very nice but I wish there was more of it!

The roasted sea bass with orange, fennel and sea asparagus was a bit boring - while the fish was nicely prepared, the skin was not uniformly crisp and the entire thing needed some zing.  Better was the octopus terrine, a beautifully conceived dish of tender octopus, creamed potato and chili oil.

We shared one dessert, the cheesecake.  This was a Manchego based cheesecake, more savory than sweet, served with some raspberries and mint.  It was almost like a cheese course.  Delicious and unique, definitely the highlight of the meal.

There&#39;s a nice cocktail and wine program.  Service was attentive and helpful.

All in all, this is a place that looks better than the food tastes.  I think the menu is playing it safe - perhaps the suburban traveler is not the most adventurous eater."

Our server seemed like he was going through the motions, and all of the food was very bland, especially for tapas.  Everything tasted frozen or reheated, and we walked away feeling what a waste of an evening.  There are better options in the Oak Brook area.

If you are looking for a place to have a drink that&#39;s not overly crowded try it.  Be sure to eat before you go..."

The food and drinks were excellent, and the service was even better. We especially liked the shrimp appetizer, the fried octopus, and the carne asada entree. Since it was our anniversary, the waiter brought us a glass of complimentary cava. This restaurant seems to be an undiscovered local gem, probably more frequented by tourists than locals.

Last night was their first night to have LIVE MUSIC.   A mixture of Jazz, R&amp;B, Top 40, Old and New School, Classic and Standards.... WOW!  They converted the room into  &#34;The Sound Factory at El Tapeo&#34; after 9pm on Friday and Saturday nights. They have the popular saxophonist Harlan Jefferson for the next few weekends and will be featuring other local artists AND flying in LAS VEGAS MUSICIANS!!! There is nothing like it!

We were surprised when upon being seated, we were given a complementary glass of delicious sparkling white wine.   To accompany our dinner, we ordered their Rioja (red) Sangria.  This was one of the most smooth and flavorful sangrias that we have had. We learned the secret may be the Grand Mandarin liquor that is part of the recipe.
When making the reservation, I didn&#39;t research the menu thoroughly so I was a bit surprised they only had twelve tapas menu items.  Once I got beyond this surprise I was pleased with the overall breath of the menu.  For appetizer, we ordered Seleccion de Embutidos, a selection of shaved serrano, chorizo, iberico and fuet and chicken liver pate.  The pate was fantastic and we enjoyed all of the charcuterie even the chorizo which I am normally not fond of.
For the salad, we shared the Ensalada de Pera, poached pear, spinach, blue cheese and almonds.  The spinach was very fresh, the blue cheese a nice offset to a subtle vinaigrette dressing and the poached pear very tastee.   For the main entre I had the Cordero, baby lamb chops which were cooked to perfection.  My wife had Pescado del Dia, serrano ham wrapped monkfish which she enjoyed immensely.  For desert we had the Crema Catalana de Chocolate and Churros which we both enjoyed.  Once again I was surprised how well I enjoyed the Churros which I normally find too sugary.  Great meal and service.  Would definitely visit again."

Having lived in Chicago &amp; the suburbs my whole life, I dare say it&#39;s the best beef sandwich I&#39;ve ever had.  (((Prepares to be pelted)))  The beef is just so tender &amp; the bread alone is fantastic!

My gyro-connoisseur husband really enjoyed the gyro he ordered and even had some leftovers for the next day, which never happens!

The beef seems to be a smidge thicker-cut than other places, and extremely tender.  The spices used are deliciously addictive - lots of garlic, red pepper flakes, and other deliciousness - it literally melts in your mouth &amp; that makes me one happy gal.

From this single happenstance experience, I abandoned my trusty standby (Augustino&#39;s) &amp; ordered Patelli&#39;s beef as an accompaniment to my Christmas dinner lineup.  To say it was a hit is an understatement.  My guests knew it was different, and EVERYONE asked where we got it.  In fact, my nephew-in-law ate all their leftover beef before my niece got any!

The catering order process was flawless.  The gentleman on the line was so friendly, polite, and very helpful.  I didn&#39;t get his name, but Patellis West Chicago:  he was one who offered to work late on Christmas Eve.  (We picked up our order early, but he offered to stay late if need be.)  He was really enthusiastic and so helpful!  Definitely a keeper!

Included with our delicious beef catering order was the softest French bread I&#39;ve ever had, more than enough sweet peppers &amp; mouth-watering giardiniera, serving utensils for *everything,* PLUS forks, knives, plates, - all the stuff you never ask for but realize you need at the last minute!  A lot of places charge extra for these niceties;  Patellis viewed them as 
necessities, and it really helped a lot during the last-minute serving melee.
 
For years I&#39;ve ordered beef from both Portillo&#39;s (10% - I find it too fatty) and Augustino&#39;s (90% - I love their spices) and I will say if Patelli&#39;s keeps doing what it&#39;s doing, they will eventually rule the area Italian Beef catering game.

I have never been happier with an Italian Beef catering order, and there just aren&#39;t enough stars."

Five min later, a bigger table of about 12ppl came, the same waiter waited on them, didnt bring a note to write down their orders and surprise....he forgot one of their orders!

If you have short memory its not very hard to grab a pen and a piece of paper writing them down!!!  

And of course, our hot water never showed up!! I wonder why....

I have to say the food were pretty good but kinda on the small portion...and most importantly so why I gave it a one-star, IF there is a zero star I would!   As soon as we got home, I had to use the bathroom, everything I ate were gone...lol"

Chicken was hot and cooked well, and the sautéed onions were perfectly cooked, but they unexpectedly put it on a bed of lettuce. You know what happens to lettuce under hit food? It becomes disgustingly wilted. Ruined the dish.

So when I found out that they were closed for good, I was really heartbroken. A couple weeks ago, I was messing around with the Yelp app, searching for new and hot businesses around the area and I happened to stumble upon this place. I was so excited, the first thing I did was texted one of my friends and told her that we need to check this place out. We ended up going here the following weekend. The new location is literally across the street from the old one. I really like the interior designs of this place. It seems so much bigger and cleaner compares to the old one. 

We started off with Spring Rolls and it was decent. It was not OMG amazing, but at the same time, it was not horrible. I actually prefer the Spring Rolls at Green Basil a little bit more. However, I actually like the Com Suon Nuong at this place a lot more. The Com Suon Nuong comes with a pork chop and shredded pork. For a dollar more, you can add an egg or the Vietnamese sausages.

The rice platter w/ the pork and a fried egg on top is a favorite among my friends and I. It is super filling and worth the price (~$11). The pho is okay, nothing spectacular but it gets the job done if you are hungover.

I ordered the beef pho and my boyfriend ordered the chicken vermicelli. The noodles were stuck together in my bowl, I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s because the broth wasn&#39;t hot enough to soften it. Also,  there were barely any meat in my bowl. My boyfriend also had the issues with his vermicelli bowl, there was barely any chicken in it. On top of that, there was lettuce in his bowl. I have never seen this meal served with lettuce and there&#39;s probably good reason to it. The lettuce was on the bottom of the hot food and was wilted by the time he got to it."

The wait seemed to take forever but it was worth it. Luckily their food is just as great as before with the exception of the mongolian beef. This time it tasted fishy, like someone went overboard with the oyster sauce. So that was a disappointment. My only other complaint was it&#39;s pretty cold inside. I get it, heat is expensive, but I want to be comfortable and relax when dining out. Hopefully it was an anomaly as I would hate to have to avoid the place until it warms up outside. 

Now for the good stuff - I love that each dish now comes with its own side of rice. In the past when we order multiple dishes, they&#39;d bring them out with just a plate of rice and not offer to bring more. This time we ordered four dishes because we were so excited they were back in business and wanted to enjoy the food for multiple meals. Each dish came with it&#39;s own rice so we didn&#39;t have to make our own at home. I also like that they now have lunch specials every day of the week. We will definitely take advantage of that since my favorite dish, Kung Pao chicken, is on the that list.

No more &#34;My heart will go on&#34; instrumental music. You&#39;re greeted now with Justin Bieber&#39;s &#34;Sorry.&#34; 
The menu is nice and simple.  One side is the Vietnamese dishes and the other side is their Chinese dishes. And THANKFUL their Pho is still amazing.  You know the Pho is good when the broth is so clear and just clean tasting. You can choose beef broth or chicken broth.  The spice of the broth and the ingredients are just fantastic!  
Nice and friendly service as usual. They are quick and hospitable. SUPER EXCITED they are back and in full swing!"

Had I rated it back then, the most I would&#39;ve given it would be a 3.5, if half stars were possible. This is because it was an example of the typical Asian restaurant with dirty floor, icky restroom, non-engaging staff, unedited printed menu in cheap/old plastic cover, old dishes/chopsticks/utensils, etc., etc., and I wasn&#39;t eager to bring visitors there. BUT NOW at the new location just across the street, Luong Loi is an Asian restaurant I am proud to bring visitors to! Not only is the venue snazzy and well decorated, but the printed menu is smart, there are new young staff who engage their customers and smile, the entrees are the same delicious taste, but better presented, and the restrooms are nice! Hope they keep it up!"

The pho which is a beef noodle soup is exceptional.  I love the different spices and flavors it features. I appreciate the generous helping of fresh bean sprouts and peppers which are meant to be mixed into the soup. The Mongolian beef and won ton appetizer are outstanding menu items as well. My Mom absolutely loves the Mongolian beef and she thinks it is the best out of many she has experienced. As good as it is, I think some people might find it a little sweet. The décor in the new location is much improved."

It&#39;s easy to to get to, as it&#39;s right on Main Street, and with a new location (directly across the street from it&#39;s old one) it has lots of seating to accommodate most group sizes.

Make sure to try to the egg drop soup--they&#39;re the only ones I know of that add garlic to it. The addition is simple but incredibly tasty.

First, we had been frequenting this establishment&#39;s original location for years, where the atmosphere was a dive, but the food and service were always very good. We were so looking forward to their new location across the street. Tried this new site several times, where there is almost an upscale atmosphere, still good food, but the service has gone from an A- to an F. Those first visits we chalked it up to being unprepared for increased business at the new location/ until last night! Saturday night, yes it&#39;s busy but no wait for a table. My husband, son and I arrive at 6:05 and order within 5 minutes with the older gentleman/owner, who never returns. Receive drinks reasonably quickly, then wait until 7:05 - one hour- for one appetizer to arrive, lemongrass beef skewers, which must have been sitting in the kitchen so long, they were absolutely cold. Ate those as we were starving by now. At 7:20 my son and I receive our meals, with no food or server in site for my husband. Wait 10 more minutes, get up and chase down 2 staff about missing meal, no apologies, just , &#34;We&#39;re busy.&#34; Still no food or server EVER arrives for my husband. At 7:40, I get up again, chase down apathetic server, request to pay for our 2 uneaten meals and cold appetizer - minus my husband&#39;s invisible meal, still no apology, and leave, all the while not even able to have a conversation due to the terrible noise level of the place.
ADVICE: Save the aggravation/miserable experience and head over to Simply Thai Bistro on Liberty St. for an excellent meal with great attentive service and relaxing atmosphere. This will be our go-to place from now on. I only hope this review is read by the first establishment and taken to heart in order to improve its lack of service and caring, but I doubt it. Deserves zero stars!"

Just the other day I visited the new location and I was pleasantly surprised. It is a very nice upgrade. New modern atmosphere with exposed brick and cool ceiling. It is airy and bright in there. 

I ordered #19 the beef noodle soup, of course, and the egg rolls. I&#39;ve loved the egg rolls for years, they&#39;re super crisp and the carrot dressing on the side adds a nice sweetness. Their egg rolls are a perfect appetizer while waiting for the soup. The beef noodle soup was so good. I feel like the portion size got bigger (??). The broth is very clean tasting compared to other pho restaurants. There is very little fat/oil on top as that part is skimmed off. The portion of veggies they give you was perfect for the size of the soup. 

The service was great as well. We got seated right away and waiter was very polite. The grandpa who would pour the water was very cute as well. 

Overall, well done Luong Loi on moving locations. I love it and will definitely be returning."

I didn&#39;t get a good read off my husband, but I think he liked his, but wasn&#39;t his favorite. The wontons we also got where good. Nice and hot so you knew it was fresh.

My friends suggested we give it a try as they have had it once before long ago. 
We kept the order simple, 2 pan pizzas, one pepperoni and the other pineapple. We got one crust with parm and the other with butter. They are a little more pricey than what I was expecting from a &#34;fast-food&#34; pizza place. Delivery took about 45 minutes, but it was a Friday night, so expected. 
The pizza was delicious. The crust was flaky and crusty like, not soggy like most pizzas. The pizza itself was rich and dense with the perfect ratio of sauce, cheese, toppings. 
The size of the pizzas are a little smaller than what I would expect for the price, but my eyes are bigger than my stomach and I was stuffed after 2 pieces. I will be back and I want to try this BBQ Chicken pizza I keep reading about!"

While I&#39;m sure the pizza tasted wonderful when it left the oven.  By the time it had reached our home, the pizza was MASSIVELY and INCREDIBLY soggy.  It was like someone had dumped a glass of grease in the box before they sent it out.

The bread sticks were also cold to the touch.  We tried to microwave them, but that made it worse.

The only reason for two stars is that they do use fresh ingredients and you might have a different experience in the restaurant itself.

The barbecue chicken 8 corner pizza is one of my all time favorite pizzas. The crust itself is incredible (8 corner is pretty much the only pizza I order now), so light and fluffy yet filling and crispy, but the barbecue sauce they use in place of pizza sauce is what takes it up to another level.

Thrilling, gut-churning and at times terrifying. I write this assumption because that is what I experienced.

The thrill upon having the pizza delivered and cut in 8 perfect squares. The gut-churning 1  1/2 pieces in. And after that... The terror.

I remember nothing after the third piece. The next morning I awoke in a neighbor&#39;s yard wearing only sweat pants and suspenders. A rabbit munching grass a few feet away said, &#34;Next time you eat Jet&#39;s wear a parachute.&#34; I do not know if I was hallucinating.

Will I eat pizza again? Possibly. Will I eat Jet&#39;s Pizza again? Never, Yelp. Never."

On top of that their service IMO sucks. I ordered from there two times. I ordered from there a second time because I needed something quick and they deliver. The Moron on the phone took my order and called me back a half hour later saying they don&#39;t deliver to my house because it was 20 miles away. WRONG it is only 3 miles which is about a 5 min drive away and they have delivered it before. Besides that even if they were correct which they weren&#39;t  they shouldn&#39;t call you a half hour and tell you they can&#39;t deliver. These people are simpletons don&#39;t waste your time.

It has &#39;bold pepporoni&#39; now, I&#39;m not entirely sure what that is. The bold pepperoni tasted really peppery. If you like jalapeños or hot sauce on your pizza then you might enjoy it. The sauce is slightly sweet. Sweet sauce, peppery pepperoni, and a garlicky crust(I added the free flavored crust option) this particular combination does not work. The bold pepperoni leaves a nasty taste in your mouth. 2 stars for the New York crust.. It was thin without being cracker like, I&#39;ll try this place again, next time I&#39;ll get the speciality corner pizza. I&#39;ll update this review if it gets better...

I&#39;ve killed a man for a corner piece of pizza, and I&#39;d do it again if I had the chance. 

Any downsides? The coupons that you get in the mail don&#39;t seem like they give you any discount. Maybe they do and my head math is terrible. Otherwise, this is my favorite pizza on Earth....maybe even the world."

I like pizza hut and everything but Jet&#39;s is definitely a step above.  If not several steps above!

If you&#39;re going to eat here you should definitely get the Turbo Stix and/or the 8 corner pizza.  I stick to the basics...cheese or pepperoni.

I frequently get the lunch slice special which is like a whole 4 dollars when you add a soda.  Yumyumyum!!

Good quality and always tastes fresh. SPEEDY delivery ... is this why they call it &#34;Jet&#39;s&#34; ? LOL
Most importantly for us is that it is peanut free- as my child has life threatening allergies The owner takes this extremely seriously. He does not even allow employees to bring food in with nuts.

The salads are nasty. Wilted brown lettuce, no thanks. I have ordered from this location many times. Including large orders for PTA functions and a kids sports team (they eat a lot of pizza!) However, on the last order I noticed that my card was charged $50 for 1 pepperoni pizza and a salad plus a $5 tip. I called the store and spoke with the manager. He was not at all concerned and made it seem like this was a regular occurrence. He was very annoyed that I noticed the over charge and after several minutes he offered me a $15 credit for my next order. As if I&#39;d actually order from them again. I sent an email to the corporate office explaining the situation. But this is a franchise and they have no authority over franchises locations. The franchise owner did contact me to apologize but again, no resolution or refund was offered. He did offer to send over a free pizza that night, which was a nice gesture but I already had dinner plans that evening and it was a take it or leave it this is your only recourse type of offer. I just wanted a refund of the over charge. Not a credit that I&#39;ll never use or a free pizza from a pissed off manager that had been caught stealing and knows where I live."

The first time we ordered from here we got  2 toppings on our pizza. The delivery driver arrived after about an hour (there was a snowstorm) and when my husband casually said &#34;Hey, how ya doing?&#34; the delivery driver responded &#34;I hate my job&#34;. Wow!! Okay then. When we opened the pizza we were disappointed because we ended up with very sparse toppings. We really thought nothing of it at first and chocked it up to being a busy night. 

The second time we ordered we told them in advance about our past experience with the toppings and they apologized. We ordered a plain cheese pizza duo. When it arrived the entire pizza was covered with a grated romano cheese which we neither ordered nor expected because our first pizza did not come with it. We were not too pleased since neither my husband nor I liked the taste. We called back and spoke to a manager. He put a credit for the value of another pizza on our account.

The third time we ordered we used one of the web coupons for an X-large pizza. Again we ordered 2 toppings and told the order taker about our past experience with sparse toppings. They applied our coupon and account credit. About two minutes later the general manager called us back and told us he could not accept both the coupon and the account credit. Okay, that&#39;s fine. But really? Call us back and take the $2 coupon away? He should have just let it go and then told his employee not to do that again.
Again, when the pizza arrived we had very sparse toppings - probably worse than the first time.

We are never ordering here again. Not only are the employees rude, but they have very poor quality control on their pizzas."

Originally we started at Rosati&#39;s, but they are a bit pricey. We then moved to Pizza Hut, but recently discovered Jets. Needless to say, we have our new spot on Friday nights. 

We always get the pan/square pizza, Jets bread and bone in wings. The pizza is delicious and probably one of the best chain pizza I&#39;ve had. Remember, this pizza isn&#39;t Chicago, so it&#39;s hard to compare to some other pizza joints. The Jets bread with garlic butter is amazing and the wings are pretty average. Either way, I go to Jets for the pizza.

Their prices are reasonable and their delivery service is as quick as a Jet! We normally order around 7:00pm and 9 times out of 10, they are at my front door in 30 minutes. 

In short... Great food, good prices, fast delivery and friendly service. Highly recommended!"

It&#39;s not Chicago style, but to us that&#39;s a good thing.  Pizza crust shouldn&#39;t be hard and paper thin!  Real pizza ought to have some depth to it and jets does.  Add to that a slight crispyness to the edges and you have some tasty pizza crust!
 Topping are great too and if you order double cheese here, you really do get double cheese!  If you order double cheese at most other place in the area, you can&#39;t even tell the difference between it and the ones with only single 
cheese.
Comparing this place to pizza hut is just plain ridiculous...
As for the interior being &#34;like a hallway&#34;, what did you expect, linen table clothes and fresh cut flowers?  It&#39;s a carry out only pizza place.  Walk in, get your pizza, walk out.  For ambience, go to Lou Malnatis and spend $30 for a pie, for fast, reasonably priced pizza that is great, try Jets."

The first time was good we picked up a 8 corner pizza and it was great. It is perfect for us, as I am a meat lover, and she&#39;s a vegetarian. This style pizza allows us to order half and half without my side touching her vegetarian side. 

First Experience: Good pizza, not Chicago or New York pizza, but a change of pace is nice every now and then.

Second Experience: Didn&#39;t go so well. We ordered delivery as we were being lazy and working on wedding details at home. We were starved ordered the pizza (arriving in 20 minutes when quoted 30 minutes--which we were excited about). After opening the box we weren&#39;t so happy. There were hairs all over the pizza, I&#39;m not sure what exactly happened....We called back and we got a replacement pizza in about 30 more minutes.... waiting on it we just made something around the house. We called back and the manager apologized but didn&#39;t comp or take care of the pizza.

Pros:
Different Style Pizza
Easily Split
Decent Service

Cons:
A little too much dough
Seems to be too much business for what their staff can handle
Pricey Pizza Pie (approx $20 for two people)

Overall: It&#39;s alright not sure if we&#39;ll order again we may just spend the extra cash and get Lou Malnatis"

I was born and raised on the south side of Chicago, so its my belief that I KNOW pizza. So let me assure you that Jet&#39;s Pizza, while technically a chain, is not one of those average pizza joints.  Jet&#39;s ranks as one of the best pizzas I&#39;ve had in my 40 years of eating pizza. Yes, this is a bold statement, but it is the truth!

We have not been disappointed with a single pizza selection from here but their BBQ Chicken Pizza is more addictive then the most addictive drugs. This is not a joke!

Pizza is very personal for many of us, I won&#39;t guarantee that everyone will be a fan its simply not possible. But Jet&#39;s is the real deal and I believe the vast majority of people will be more then pleased!

I ordered the 8 corner pizza, which is basically just 2 small square pizzas (so you get 8 corners).  The pizza has a thick crust, which normally isn&#39;t my favorite style, but this pizza is fantastic!  The outer edge of the pizza has a nice brown crust, it appears to have been cooked in a buttered pan.  The pizza is a little greasy, but the taste more than makes up for that.  The pizza had quite a lot of cheese on it, but the pepperoni, not so much.  It wasn&#39;t as if they skimped on the pepperoni, but compared with the amount of cheese, it wasn&#39;t a lot.  I ordered the pizza for delivery and it arrived fast and hot.  I don&#39;t live any where near the restaurant (I was surprised they even delivered to me), but they got it to me quick.

We always get the combo with the boneless bbq wings and pizza bread, which are both delicious.

Damn you guys for making such delicious pizza...it&#39;s worth every calorie.

I really didn&#39;t find anything great about the food and neither did my dining partner. The service was spotty as they had the server handling the carry out orders as well.

I&#39;m glad others are happy with this place, but I won&#39;t be going back."

From the outside, this place is nothing special and barely noticeable. I think this is what also makes this place great. You walk in, the ambiance is cozy and chic. It&#39;s not too big but not too small. My friend and I were promptly seated and offered drinks. Our waitress was awesome and funny. 

I ordered two things I don&#39;t quite remember the names of (see pictures) but I was so impressed by the portion and the quality. Even though there was larger portions, they don&#39;t skimp on the veggies or meat. It&#39;s loaded with deliciousness! Oh, and just like everyone says, the avacado rolls are to die for. Literally, die for them. They&#39;re amazing. 

Oh and something else to mention, they have free Jazz music the first Friday of the month! How cool is that?!

Have only had take out but every time it has been stellar. Pad Woon Sen has the most flavorful sauce I have ever had with that dish anywhere, I love it!!! The basil fried rice has a nice peppery bite but is balanced by the savory flavors cooked into the rice. My wife ordered the pepper steak tonight and I tried it and it was quite honestly the best pepper steak I have ever had. I love Thai food, this place takes Thai food and elevates the flavor beyond what I have had in recent years. Also the avocado roll appetizer is also amazing. The crunchiness of the fried roll gives way to a burst of deliciousness!!! I was highly impressed by those. From all I have tried here I would say the theme that comes across is balance. In all their dishes, not one flavor overpowers another, they just meld together and are bright enough to complement one another without stealing the show. Seriously impressed! Their TomYom soup is also phenomenal. I ordered it extra spicy the last time I had a head cold and again the flavors were perfect together and pronounced enough I could still taste it despite my cold.

I will be a repeat customer and recommend to everyone!"

Anyway, we&#39;ve ordered soup and 2 dishes, it took forever for the food to arrive, soup that was a coconut milk and lime grass with chicken was tasty, my coco-chicken was very good, wife didn&#39;t care her beef strings that suppose to come in on bed of chili peppers but had no spice or much of any pepper in it at all.

The restaurant we initially intended on eating at was closing soon, so we yelped it up &amp; found Montri Thai.

Located in a large strip mall in Winfield, IL it looks pretty simple on the outside. Once you get inside, however, it almost feels like you are at a restaurant near a tourist spot with soft music playing in the background.

We went on a Friday evening around 8:30pm, and the restaurant was on the empty side. We were seated promptly and given menus to look over.

I almost always order the Pad Kee Mao (spicy flat rice noodles) when I first visit a Thai spot. My husband ordered a curry dish (Coconut Yellow Curry?). My food overall was pretty decent. A little greasy for my taste, but definitely not overly oily to the point where I can&#39;t enjoy my food. The curry dish was delicious!

Our server was friendly and pleasant which enhanced our experience a bit more.

We look forward to trying out some of the other dishes Montri Thai has to offer soon."

The décor is modern and nice.  The service is fast and friendly.  The owner even came over at the end of our meal to ask how everything was and solicit any feedback we may have.  He also mentioned that they will have a live Jazz band one Friday a month starting in a couple of months.

Thai Iceed Tea $3 - This was very good, not too sweet at all (in fact, I could go a tad sweeter).

Tom Kha Kai $5 - Thai coconut milk soup with your choice of chicken or vegetable cooked with lemongrass, bell pepper, mushroom and lime leave.  This was a tasty soup, but what threw me off were the pieces of green bell peppers.  I love veggies, but this is one of my least favorite vegetables.  I&#39;ve never had that in a Tom Kha before.

Lard Nar with Tofu $9 - Big flat rice noodle with Broccoli and Collard Greens in garlic gravy.  They made this with a very strange twist - the noodles were crispy and the sauce was watery.  Maybe this is the fusion part.  I was expecting the normal soft wide rice noodles with thick sauce and didn&#39;t particularly enjoy this variation.  Also, I didn&#39;t see any collard greens.

Spicy Catfish $14 - Deep fried crispy catfish with red curry paste in coconut milk, topped with a touch of crispy basil leave.  My favorite dish of the night and it was delicious.

There were plenty of food, which we took home as leftovers.  I was particularly touched that even though we only had a tablespoonful of rice left, they had packed us more rice to go with our leftovers."

Finally, great Thai close to home! I have been dying for some great Thai food ever since I ate at Banana Leaf in Dallas and remembered just how great Thai food could be. (amazingly the owner there looked Thai, but had a thick Cajun accent)

Seriously, we eat Thai food a couple of times a month and have been making do with food that is just OK and creeping up in price. Many of these Thai places don&#39;t even serve much seafood... What&#39;s up with that?

Montri Thai has a full menu with all the right stuff. We started with the Avocado rolls and Chicken Satay... followed by Pad See Ew with Beef, Tofu Thai Fried Rice, Thai Orange Chicken and Panang Curry.

Everything was delicious! The Panang Curry is a real treat and the Satay is the best that I&#39;ve had in a long time (looking forward to trying the pork satay) I can&#39;t wait to get back there to try the whole red snapper and some of the other seafood dishes.

Now there is more to eat in Warrenville than just Two Brothers.

Good prices, a nice room, decent wine list, friendly service and great food... an awesome formula for success. Now if only they could work on their Cajun accents"

The portion I was served felt endless, and there were plenty of perfectly cooked shrimp.  I asked for &#34;spicy,&#34; and my dish absolutely was spicy without blowing my head off.  But don&#39;t eat those little red chilies in the dish, because those will make your mouth hurt.  I mistook them for a dried fruit, but I have no idea why I assumed something so ridiculous, so my mouth suffered a little.

The avocado rolls were interesting.  I liked the creaminess of the avocado and the crunchiness of the roll.  But it kind of tasted like guacamole which threw off the whole Thai thing.  Our friends ordered the Angel Wings appetizer, which looked like a giant stuffed chicken leg and deep fried.  I didn&#39;t get to try it, but it looked delicious.

There&#39;s a good variety of Thai dishes on the menu aside from the predictable Pad Thai including red, yellow, and green curries, and quite frankly a lot of other things I cannot recall much less pronounce (Pad See Ew, Kung...tingtangwallawallabingbang...)

Montri Thai is located in a strip mall, alongside a laundromat and thrift store, so I expected a more divey, casual joint.  While Montri Thai is casual, the interior of the restaurant felt intimate and classy with the dark wood tables, booths, and white tablecloths.  The restaurant can definitely accomodate groups, but it was so quiet in here (aside from the Christmas music) that I felt like I had to keep my voice down.

Good Thai food especially if you are looking for something a bit more upscale than the divey take-out joints."

Hands down, this is it. Whether it&#39;s break ups, work stress, or something else, their cocktails are excellent (both in liquor content and price) and their Rama Chicken makes everything temporarily better. The Rama Tofu isn&#39;t bad either. It&#39;s large enough that if you pick at your food and have a liquid dinner when stressed, the food still tastes good microwaved the next day.

It&#39;s true, hardly anybody dines in. Which makes it perfect to talk to the servers. My favorite is on maternity leave but I&#39;ve since become Facebook friends with her. Yes, this place is that amazing.

Taste was pretty good. The duck was fried and some was hard to eat since the breading or whatnot was extremely tough.

What I know is, whatever food I tried was good so I&#39;m going to give Montri the benefit of the doubt here.  Really the two major issues were that the service was really slow.  We waited a LONG time just to get our appetizers like avocado rolls and soup.  That was excessive, but again maybe the issue was the size of our group, 8 adults and 6 kids.  The other issue my friends complained about was the sweetness of the food.  Many entrees came out quite sweet, which wasn&#39;t ideal.

I tried a couple of things.  First off, the avocado rolls were great.  Almost like a Tex/Mex-Asian fusion thing going on.  Really nice.  On the other hand, the Tom Kha soup was... not what I expected.  Not that it was bad, but it just didn&#39;t taste like the Tom Kha soup I have almost everywhere else.  I&#39;m all for unique flavors, but this just seemed like a whole different kind of soup.  Really, the soup was my only complaint.  The red curry was great and the Pad Kee Mao was good.  I think we could and should have upped the spice levels on everything we ordered.  Adding in the hot sauce provided the heat we needed.

I would recommend Montri.  I would come back and give them another shot in terms of the service assuming part of the issues were just due to our group size.  We&#39;ll hope for a better experience next time."

We arrived hoping to finish dinner by the closing time we thought was 9 (actually 10) on a Friday.  The place wasn&#39;t too full, but the decor and setup is very clean and modern while still being comfy.  We took a bit of extra time to order since we wanted to scan the whole menu to see what they had to offer, and the waitress was extremely polite and not bugging us, but attentive none the less.

We ordered some Thai Tea that really stuck to your gums.  The very good flavor hung around in your mouth if you let it.  Then we decided on some Tom Kha Kai which came in a plenty large enough bowl to share (but not too large as to leave you groaning).  The flavor was very good but there was an interesting aspect - bell peppers.  It wasn&#39;t bad, but it was unfamiliar for the dish (as well as a couple of others).  Probably just something to get used to.

We also had the Pad See Eiw which was delicious, but the noodles may have been fried too much (unless they started with a different wide noodle than I&#39;m used to) as they were a bit too hard to cut with a fork and or spoon.  We commented to the waiter and he said he would tell the chef and thanked us for our opinion.  The dish also had broccoli instead of collard greens, but the flavor was great either way.

The other dish we ordered was the spicy catfish.  It was a very good mixture of red curry and coconut milk with a spice that I thought I was going to need to spice up at first, but set in to the perfect cruise to spice town.

When the waiter went to wrap up our food he noticed that we did not have much rice and, without asking, packed a nice, full extra container for us to take.  Awesome!


I really liked the lounge-style oldies that were playing the whole time we were there (Beatles, Doors, Steely Dan, etc) and the waiter also noted that they will be featuring live jazz once a month (2nd Friday?) and possibly more often if it is popular.  Cool stuff!"

To start I absolutely love the Duck Basil Salad with fresh Mango pieces and the sauce is phenomenal!!

I have been to Thailand, know the food and even speak it. We ordered some very basic carry out and it was mediocre at best. The pad Thai was tasteless as was the fried rice. Real Thai food uses fish sauce. Especially in pad Thai and fried rice. I don&#39;t understand Thai restaurants owned by Thai people that have lousy food, especially to a culture where food is so important. This did not have that Thai flavor. Crab Rangoon (which isn&#39;t Thai but who cares) was ok. I normally get joy Yees but they are temporarily closed. I will not order from here again. If you&#39;re reading this and are Thai, the food is &#34;juhd cheep-hai&#34;! Which in Thai means bland as hell. Skip it"

The food was fantastic! The drive went to the wrong address, but everything still came very hot, which was great because we don&#39;t have a microwave yet :). The portions were much larger than I expected. We had a dish with wide flat rice noodles and they tasted like they were homemade, although I don&#39;t know for sure. Everything was delicious.

Been here for around 5 times now. We usually order PadKeeMao, Pad thai, Panang curry and the Basil Fried rice. They have a good sausy taste to the PadKee Mao, and the portions they serve are more than enough every time. 
The fried rice have a good flavor and taste."

Ordered the avocado lovers roll as an appetizer which was pretty good.. Like a crispy spring roll filled with guac served with a dipping sauce.

For our entrees we had the panang curry with chicken and tofu and the green curry with chicken. Both were flavorful and delicious!! Some of the best I&#39;ve had in the Chicagoland area. The green curry was creamy coconutty goodness with thinly sliced bamboo shoots, peas, and peppers. Both dishes also had just the right amount of heat to balance out the sweet and creamy. So so good. 

We were stuffed but had to try out the mango sticky rice for dessert since everything else we had ordered was so authentic and tasty. I&#39;m glad we did because it didn&#39;t disappoint! Left happy and stuffed."

Their pad Thai is the best in the area. Hands down. Their avocado rolls are amazing good. Creamy and crunchy and worth the order. We even had potstickers which were good, though, a bit doughy for my taste.

Friendly service, beautiful space.

We visited Reserve 22, at Village Links, on a Fri nite in May &#39;15. The place was already very busy at 7, not so much with golfers coming off the links, but with diners who made &#34;22&#34; their target for the evening. A loud boisterous crowd filled the dining room, the large bar, and most of the terrace. Video screens covered sports of the day.

Service was very attentive, and there was plenty of staff to handle the large crowd as well as keep problems down and service up.

&#34;22&#34; is not the usual clubhouse dining. A long list of craft and specialty beers, and wines, are offered. They do have typical soup/salad/sandwich menus, but also an interesting list of small plates and sides, from $3 to about $15. A limited list of plate dinners ran mostly below $20. We had chicken linguini w/artichokes and bistro steak w/truffle/parmigiana fries. The steak was no filet but was well prepared and nicely dressed with a savory, slightly tangy sauce. The fries were to die for! I devoured the whole mountain of them. The chicken pasta, a large serving, was very good and included several dried tomato slices. Sides are extra.

The noisy crowd diminished about 9PM and management went to great efforts to move the band, and pull out some tables, for those who stayed for the entertainment and dancing until 11.

While not gourmet dining (3*), and the noise is not our thing, prices are modest,  the food offerings are creative, the mood is up-beat, and service very attentive (management gets a 5*). A good value and fun place. Res. recommended."

It started first with us walking in...and not be acknowledged. no sign saying to seat yourself, or wait to be seated. We had to go and find someone to ask.  
We placed our order and asked for 2 sodas.   We waited and waited. 15 minutes passed and the waitress never brought our drinks, or even stopped by. 20 minutes passes and nothing.   The restaurant wasn&#39;t even that busy. It seemed that almost everybody was waiting for food. Even people for carry out waited much longer than what seemed necessary.   After 30 minutes with no visit from the waitress, no comment that they might have been short-handed, or anything...we finally just walked out and left. Prior to walking out, I noticed a couple behind us almost walked out as well.  
If you have all night to wait for dinner...this might be the place for you.   The only positive thing worth mentioning is the place has a nice decor. If I could give zero stars for this place, I would, but they get one by default."

Nestled off Rt. 59 in a strip mall, we walked past it going to the hardware store and decided to give it a try. My husband is gluten and dairy free, so I sold him on the rice noodles and peanut oil in Thai food.

We have been back twice and loved everything we have tried. I adore the mango lobster roll appetizers, which are spring rolls with a peanut sauce you can spoon on yourself. I&#39;ve had the baby corn and peapod and trio delight entrees and they were both delicious. My partner had pad thai chicken and some kind of coconut curry with shrimp and pineapple that he raved about. The Jasmine iced tea is refreshing and light, too.

The banana dessert reminded me of overcooked oatmeal, but there is so much delicious food, I can skip dessert. :) I will definitely be going back often and we noticed they do a brisk carryout business, so we are looking forward to having a new carryout place that is on my way home from work."

I really appreciate a restaurant that makes things fresh and care about what they serve. Montri is small and quaint and makes it&#39;s food a nice presentation which I appreciate, and you can taste the freshness. Try it, you&#39;ll like it.

At any rate, we went in to dine. Yelp, I hate to be the dissenter but I fear that I must say that Montri is carrying on Ariya&#39;s mediocre tradition.

Why? Due to pretty much everything we ordered. For an appetizer we split the Blue Sea Crispy Rolls. For a dish that claimed to contain a combo of lobster, crab, shrimp, and scallop along with carrot, cabbage and bean threads, I have to say that the seafood was almost undetectable. The taste wasn&#39;t bad for what it was, but what it was was pretty much a deep-fried veggie roll. 

For our entrees he ordered the sweet almond beef and I got the mussaman curry with chicken. Mine came in a large ceramic cauldron, a heady broth of coconut milk bobbing with potatoes and chunks of pineapple; I fished around with the serving spoon to locate the chicken I&#39;d ordered until we realized that it had been made with tofu. 

(Servers: this is what an ordering pad is for!! There is no shame in using one!!)

I snared the waitress before she got into the back, and she took it away and apparently they remade the whole dish, because my friend finished his whole meal before mine came back. It ended up being okay, but in the end I should have tried something else initially (had I known). 

His dish was alright but as he said, only serviceable. 

There were a number of interesting sounding dishes on the menu (nutty chicken, coco chicken) and a plethora of seafood dishes (including the hilariously named (Hotty Seafood), but after this experience I&#39;ll return to the safety of Le Siam further south on 59."

Called in a pick-up order and was bringing food back to some friends who own a nearby business. Upon arriving, I liked the interior and the people were friendly, but when I got the food back, I was shocked to see what was being portrayed as thai food. Got a few noodle dishes and a bunch of apps. NONE was good and none was remotely close to authentic. One step up from food court sweet and sour chicken at the mall really. Ask for spicy, and you get a 1/2 cup of red pepper flakes thrown in at the end type of crap - and the crazy thing is that people like this junk. Needness to say, I&#39;m still looking for the elusive (and even edible) suburban thai food."

(I normally go to Tusk Thai in Batavia) So I work in Warrenville and came across this place online when searching for a nearby Thai restaurant. I stuck to what I know best which is why I ordered Thai fried rice with chicken. The chicken was very flavorful and delicious! Definitely exceeded my expectations! Now the rice on the other hand didn&#39;t. I&#39;m not sure what ingredient they used too much of but the taste reminded me a lot of the $1 Michelina&#39;s boxed frozen fried rice which I do not like. Price for my order was about $10 and it was a good size portion if only I had liked the flavor more. I just admit I was a tad bit disappointed that it was not as good as my favorite Thai restaurant.

This is a Thai restaurant and all Thai flavor sucks. I decided to give a shot because of the reviews but I was so mad with every single dish. It is the worst Thai restaurant ever. They can even cook a simple curry normally! Even the Tom yum soap! Do you think people don&#39;t know Thai food! You can buy the Thai curry from a Asian supermarket it is way much better than this! When I walked into the restaurant I&#39;m glad  because the waitress are Thai people but when I eat I got so confused. WHAT THE HL is dat! I have been Thailand and I eat a lot Thai food in U.S. But this is so bad can you Thai guys try yourself? HOW you can sell this and it is not cheap. At least you guys should give some real Thai rice because it is famous and normal in Thai food; HOWEVER! The rice is so sticky and slagging I&#39;m sure it is the same rice like super cheap Asian fast food rice. Well, anyone who give 5 stars I hope you guys enjoy. Im would be glad my review could help someone or maybe just one person who gonna try this restaurant.
