Thanks for that. 

Next, they label fish that is farm raised which I simply do not eat - so again thanks for making that easy.  

Stopped in tonight cause I have been just craving fish and chips and coleslaw. Got a cod dinner and a half pound of scallops to go with coleslaw and asked for tater tots.  Now french fries are great but tater tots - so much better.  

Got home and my order was a little off - got hush puppies instead of tater tots so I threw them to the outside critters who did not even want to eat them. 

I could understand if they were busy but there was not a soul in there.  Next time I will check my order before leaving. 

BTW - the scallops were absolutely scrumptous."

My coworkers are a fan of this place for their inexpensive fried food. Me, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the trip.

If you are looking for something fresh and healthy, Johnsons Door County is not the place for you. The fried food reminds me of what you get from grade school lunches or the church&#39;s fish fry! The cod is decent but the shrimp is over breaded and not very fresh tasting. Also, I am a big fan of coleslaw but this one has so much dressing you can&#39;t even taste the cabbage.

I feel like this place is borderline three stars. If they didn&#39;t have such a retro interior and nice service I would rate it as a place to not return to! 

If you&#39;re looking for a different place to go in the West Suburbs, this is definitely unique."

1. I&#39;ve never had a bad meal. Everything is fresh and the fish. ( shrimp, broiled cod, and even the burgers) are delish. 
2.  No fuss place. It you want to be wined and dined, this place is not for you.  You order the food at the counter and its delivered to your table. 
3.  The service is great and everyone is friendly. 
4.  Not everything has to be fried. 
5.  The decor is stuck in the 60&#39;s but that&#39;s the appeal. Like I said, no fuss.

It is a small place right on roosevelt where so many other restaurants are located and nothing to set it apart. However, once you take a trip inside, you can see why it is always packed.  We (along with what seems to be all of the Catholics in lombard) love this place for our friday fish fry.  The line is always long, and there is limited seating, but the wait is worth it.  This last weekend I decided to go the healthier route and ordered the broiled cod.  As crazy as it sounds, it was even better than the fried fish! The hush puppies are to die for and the staff is always very nice and friendly. They serve alcohol and have other items other than fish, but I have never seen anyone order anything other than the delicious fresh fish or shrimp.

Atlantic Cod Deep friend platter, it comes with 2 sides.  I personally like the fries (if eating there, they don&#39;t travel the best), hush puppies, cole slaw and the macaroni salad.

I had their Friday special - a plate of fried tilapia with fries and cole slaw. The slaw and fries were unremarkable, but the fish was excellent. I supplemented the tilapia with 1/4 pound of fried shrimp (5 in quantity). The large tail-off shrimp were juicy and tasty. The batter was a couple of shades darker than that used on the fish -- different formulation perhaps or fried longer. Either way, it tasted great.

I opted for the optional (extra charge) thor sauce for my shrimp. The 2 oz quantity of sauce (40 cents) was more than adequate for my 1/4 pound. Thor sauce tasted much like regular shrimp cocktail sauce with a big bump in horseradish flavor. It works well.

The condiments on the table were cool to the touch for my early lunch. Clearly they refrigerate them overnight. I wonder if they swap them out at any time during the day? If you prefer lemon juice or hot sauce (LA style), there is a condiment table near the door where you can fill up little paper cups with what you need.

Lost a star for not serving complimentary &#39;real&#39; cockail sauce.  But, definitely pay the extra for the thors sauce... Its cocktail sauce done right.

I love the lunch specials - they are a great value!

My favorite items are the fried clams and the stuffed potato.  Both delicious.  

I love that I can order by the pound, rather than having to order a complete meal with sides.  This allows me to provide my own veggie and starch at home.  Great short-cut for us &#39;working moms&#39;.

The television is always on Wheel-of-Fortune at 6:30!  That&#39;s so cute to me.  I love watching during my short wait for food.

Call ahead, and you won&#39;t have to wait at all.

Steer clear of the calamari - unless you like rubber bands with a cheese stick breading.  Stick with the fried clams - you&#39;ll never go wrong.

Their cod fish is delicious (it is almost prepared as a &#34;poor man&#39;s lobster&#34; in terms of flavor). The rest of the after work crowd that stopped in enjoyed the walleye pike meal and also the tilapia. 

You can get seafood sauce with plenty of horse radish in it (yum), lemon or their home-style creamy tartar sauce. All are great; but the fish is the thing and it can stand alone. No sauce required. 

The steamed shellfish (no matter which shell you are in the mood for) is equally as mouth watering. Ample side orders are available, take your pick of country fries (very good), hush puppies, and an assortment of breaded veggie options, slaw, and, at least when we were there, chowder.

As far as service, counter or wait service, for those that intend on dining in, this is not to be rated even as a 3 star diner. Its shining quality is it&#39;s fish fry or everything fried. This and only this is its gleaming quality. I&#39;ve had fish fry at many places around Chicago, a few of which I frequent and of the bulk of them, Door County beats them in taste. I sampled their mushrooms, Cod, French fries and shrimp. They are known for their fried shrimp which was excellent, now as I type, my stomach juices are in motion thinking about the crispy crunch and flavor as the cocktail sauce is swirled about each savory bite. The Cod was the freshest, flaky white, meaty chunks of excellent flavor and with every bite a bit of steam exhaled from each portion. Mushrooms were pretty good, would&#39;ve preferred a different flavor of accompanying dip and the fries were average, although the kids of our party liked them. 
The restaurant part is nothing to be excited about. I&#39;d bring a few people for a quick bite, but never for a sit down full out meal. This is a dingy diner type of place. You won&#39;t care much about your attire, maybe you just got off work and are in dire need of a stiff drink or beer with which you enjoy while crunching down on their tasty fried foods. This is that spot. 

Fish fry fans must bookmark this spot. The stars are for the food."

I have never seen a fast food place place with more kinds of fish than this place. I only have the shrimp when I go to this unique local eatery.It is liekely the best and biggest shrimp you will find outside a large chain  resteraunt. I enjoy the interior and the set up of this long time Lombard classic.

My G-pa used to come home on the weekend with the shrimp basket. I remember how big the shrimps were and how good they tasted. Always such a great memory!  Being a crazed foodie adult I started to take my hubby and child there. The food honestly could be sold out of a food truck and would still bring the masses. 
Okay the only reason for 4 stars is this...the establishment is carry out or dine in and the dine in is a tad run down and needs a major makeover. Now don&#39;t start swearing at me over this, I am a divey restaurant lover. I think it adds character but I don&#39;t believe this restaurant has had a coat of paint in the last 30 years. The chairs could be replaced and just needs to be brightened up. Ya know if that&#39;s what they are going for I&#39;m cool with it, maybe that was their plan all along. I&#39;m just sayin......
Now lets talk food. Oh man.....it&#39;s delish and I can&#39;t get enough. The breading on the shrimp plate is so good. You get fried shrimp at places and it tastes as good as the fried appetizers, Johnson&#39;s has the golden ticket on that here. The shrimps are huge, always crunchy but not over cooked and the breading (which I am NOT a fried food fan) is the best part. Their homemade sauces knock it all out of the park. Usually I try to eat as healthy as I can but I give it all to the food Gods when I come here cause I get those shrimps and then I snap out from the blackout waking up only to notice that I took down the entire basket, my kid and hubby upset I didn&#39;t share. It happens here. I can&#39;t explain it, I just roll with it. 
Hubs eats healthy and gets grilled shrimp, we are picky-ish people there is not a crumb left of food when we leave, even the child partakes in this food coma......kids cheeseburger is gone, fries, gone....it&#39;s all gone.
Look I kinda feel bad that I&#39;m knocking the decor around but it needed to be said. If I&#39;m going to eat delish high quality homemade, family owned, friendly as pie, not over priced beer and wine served, love the ambiance establishment just fluff it up and throw some $ in the resturant....just a tad.
Okay, who&#39;s hungry?"

Today I picked up their fried shrimp (be warned, it&#39;s double battered, if you want less batter, order the light battered), perch, clam strips, and hush puppies.  The hush puppies were the only thing that was just ok...everything else was excellent. 

BE SURE to get the &#34;Thor&#39;s sauce&#34; which you pay extra for. It&#39;s the best cocktail sauce. Period. The one that will come otherwise is pretty much ketchup with a hint of something (clove?) The tartar sauce is excellent as well. If you&#39;re a clam strip fan, this is your place. $8.95 gets you a giant pound of these bad boys. The perch was light and perfectly fried. Everything was even crispy after driving 10 miles home. Highly Recommended."

I love seafood.  I think that, if I were a fish, I would be a shark because I could eat all other fish including some of my sharky brethren.  And maybe some scrap metal because sharks are also kind of stupid so that&#39;s in their nature.
Oh yeah, back to the restaurant.  I went here with a friend and we both got the tilapia dinner-thing, except he had his fried.  I got a side order of potato pancakes and it was actually quite boss if I do say so myself.  At first, I thought that they didn&#39;t give you enough for a meal but after I ate everything I was actually pretty satisfied.  I can&#39;t think of anything poor to say about this place, really.

The dinner came with 4 small cod chunks. As another reviewer said, it seemed like it wouldn&#39;t be enough for a meal but it was.  The seasoned fries were delicious and I loved their tartare sauce. I would have rated my experience 5 stars but I subtracted one star because my &#34;fruit&#34; side was just a small cup of canned fruit cocktail  I was expecting some sliced fresh fruit.  IMO, there is no excuse for a restaurant to serve canned fruit cocktail.  Also, the signs say that bread is no longer served with dinners unless you ask for it. So be sure to ask for it.

First of all the woman behind the counter, bless her heart, was disabled and not able to turn around use the credit card machine(which was 5 feet behind the register for some reason)  She was unhelpful and after the person in front of me ordered and paid, she spent an additional 3-4 minutes gabbing about all her various medical ailments.  Seriously? No one wants to know about your tendenitious.  
We ordered a shrimp dinner and a cat fish dinner both with hush puppies to go.  Total was just under $17.00.  There was 4 shrimp, 3 pieces of fish and about a dozen hush puppies all together.  Just not enough food for the price.  Combined with bad service?  Not worth going again.
The food itself was blah. Nothing even worth mentioning."

Johnson&#39;s was the first restaurant that popped up on Yelp.  I thought the food was very good.  We had the fried cod loin sandwiches and fried shrimp.  The cod was a very nice piece of fish and very tasty.  It was served with fries and slaw, which I also liked.  The fried shrimp were equally as good.  Nice size, not a lot of breading, and good seasoning.  This is an older restaurant (a lot of history), which I find interesting and we did not have any problems with the staff (notably the older woman at the counter).  You do order your food at the counter and seat yourself and a server will bring your food out to you.  There was only 2 small things that I didn&#39;t care for...  The seafood sauce was a little on the sweet (but tangy) side for my liking, but I still ate it and I also thought that there was too many items/options on the menu.  It was a little confusing between dinners, plates, lunch specials, etc...  All in all, if I was in the area again, I would return and I would recommend.  The old photos on the walls of the Johnson family and their fishing history are a nice element.   They also serve alcohol, which is a plus!"

She use to work at Qs and has many years experience in the food business. Say Hello to her. I recommend hot sauce with the fish. It adds that firery spice to the breading. Cheap and good.

The only fish on the menu was catfish , walleye , perch and cod but there were shrimp , popcorn shrimp, scallops and clam strips to round things out. The variety of side dishes was second to none though , including fried cauliflower , zucchini , fried mozzarella and cheddar , poppers , cole slaw , and fries among others. They also had a decent selection of sandwiches including Italian beefs and sausages , brats and fish sandwiches.

We requested a darker table since our previous visit felt like we were sitting in a spotlight.  Our server, Jose or Joe as he introduced himself, had no problem putting us in a secluded portion of the restaurant and we certainly appreciated the privacy.  He asked what we were celebrating and we announced that we had a baby sitter for the night--and if you ask me that is plenty reason to celebrate when you have children.  

Our dinner was relaxed.  He dropped in from time to time to see how we were doing, we ordered a bottle of wine, the calamari appetizer and some complimentary bread.  The first loaf was a bit on the hard side but after mentioning it Joe made us a fresh loaf and it was perfect--just like how I remember it to be.  Soft, salty, warm, delicious, perfect!  We split the bibb &amp; blue salad which I highly recommend over the standard Caesar, then also split the Penne Rustica which was VERY tasty.  We appreciated that they separated both the salad and our entrée into two dishes since we were sharing.  It just makes things so much easier.   

We wrapped up a while later, no dessert for us, but we were both shocked and beyond appreciative when our waiter told us he was buying our bottle of wine!  I&#39;ve never seen such generosity in a server in all my life.  He said he knew where we were coming from having 6 kids of his own and just wanted to give something back.  This guy rocks!

 We were met by the young host (16?) and then brought to a table. He chose one by the kitchen, and I suggested another. He was happy to oblige, and unaware, I think, that no one wants to sit next to the kitchen.

Once seated, we looked around. There was a center section of bars with water and wine (there&#39;s a Last Supper theme here, I&#39;m sure.) The wine menu area said: &#34;Honor System Wine&#34;.....which we assumed meant the wine on the center bar next to us was...um, up to us to serve to ourselves? Honor System? We also assumed that we should serve our own water, as that was on the bar next to the wine. Honor System Water? It was all a bit confusing, considering that no waiter came around to explain any of this, for quite some time.

So, I stared at the host. He looked back at us, appeared concerned, and went somewhere....for a period of time......and did not return. So my husband went and got 5 waters from the (maybe?) Serve Yourself Honor System Water Bar. (Suddenly, employees appear like ants. &#34;Can we help you?&#34; Well yeah, 10 minutes ago.) Meanwhile we waited for a waiter. 

At last, a very tall longish haired dude named Mike showed up. We knew his name was Mike because he grabbed a blue crayon (there for the kids, or anyone who wants to scribble on the paper tablecloth) wrote his name (Mike) backwards on the table cloth, and tossed the crayon back on the table with a bored hipster flourish. Hey Mike, nice intro (not really)  and nice hair, but I think you should pull it back into a ponytail. When you lean your locks over my food, well, I&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t. Mike was nice, overall, but in the end, he did little but add to the oddness of the place.

Meanwhile, my husband ordered a drink along the lines of a Vodka lemonade. It was ridiculously sweet....with sugar on the rim, to add to the diabetic wonder. Two of us ordered beer. We received bottles.This isn&#39;t a dive bar. Where are the glasses?

Appetizer: The bruschetta was a weird mixture of tomatoes and...butter on the side. No olive oil.  Butter on Bruschetta? Just wrong.

The entrees were average at best. My meatballs were clearly frozen. (Costco comes to mind.) My companions also observed that their entrees tasted frozen. (You can tell.) All in all, much of what we ate here was inferior to Olive Garden, but more expensive. Take from that what you will.

So, in the end, the experience was just too odd, and the food too below average, to earn a return visit. Maybe if it was near an exit on some super highway and we needed something to eat after a (very) long drive....and there was no truckstop. Or Stuckey&#39;s. Otherwise, probably not."

My boyfriend and I decided to treat ourselves to a night out (we don&#39;t go out to each much anymore) and I feel like it was a complete waste of time and money. 
When we first got there, the older woman seating us said about two words. Very rude and cold and when I requested a booth it almost looked as if she rolled her eyes at us. 
About ten minutes later our waiter came, who looked like he worked at the bar and not as a waiter with everyone else. He was dressed differently and barely new what he was doing. 
When we got our drinks and ordered, the food took much longer than it should have for two pasta dishes. 
I had the lobster ravioli, which would have been good if it wouldn&#39;t have come out cold from sitting so long. 
My boyfriend however had the spaghetti and meatballs and he thoroughly enjoyed that.
It was a Tuesday night, and it was not busy enough for service to have been an issue.
Of course when the waiter came to take our food, my boyfriend wanted a box and he didn&#39;t even ask. He just whisked it away! We had to raise our voices to get his attention and ask for a box and the check. He cut us off with an &#34;OKAY&#34; before we could even tell him what we needed. 
Then after getting the check another 10 minutes passed so we left cash and walked out.
I wish someone would have warned me like I am warning you! Don&#39;t waste your time and your money going here."

My Parmesan encrusted fish lacked Parmesan and was extremely tasteless and cold as well as oily.

All I really remembered was that I used to enjoy drawing on the paper table covers with the provided crayons.  I didn&#39;t have any particularly strong feelings for or against the restaurant based on that, so when my sister suggested this for Mother&#39;s Day dinner, I figured why not. We had a group of 9, and our reservation was ready right on time.

While Mother&#39;s Day is a popular holiday to eat out, I figured our 2:30 reservation would be fairly safe as it is not a prime dining time.  Despite the restaurant being half full, the service was absolutely awful. It took our server 15 minutes to bring waters and another 15 minutes to bring the wine 6 people at our table ordered.  We ordered the &#34;honor system&#34; wine where they supposedly leave a bottle on the table and you let the server know how many glasses were consumed at the end of the meal.  Well, I guess we did not appear very honest because the bottle was not left on our table even though we saw many neighboring tables with bottles. I think my mom and MIL would have liked more wine, but the server&#39;s appearances at our table we so few and far between that it was very difficult to get anything from wine to water refills to cheese.  

In the 80 minutes it took for the meal to arrive, the 9 of us ate the two small pieces of bread (which is very tasty and even a little warm) that were left on the table.  We were never visited in between ordering the food and the food arriving, so we couldn&#39;t ask for more bread.  My MIL ordered a salad and ended up not eating it.  She asked to take it home, but the server never brought a box. 

The food came in 4 batches.  I&#39;m not sure when there wasn&#39;t a food runner, manager, or another server helping the waiter bring our food - it was just our server making 4 trips back to the kitchen by himself.  My the time the final round came, it was 8 or 10 minutes after the first round, so those of us polite enough to wait were digging into fairly cool food. 

Our party gave the food mixed reviews.  The best thing at the table appeared to be the pork chop with a glaze, some roasted potatoes, and broccolini.  2 people at our table had the squash ravioli, which were very sweet.  I had the cannelloni with bolognese sauce.  There was only about a tablespoon of the bolognese - the rest of the plate had a cheese/cream sauce, so I was eating cheese-filled pasta with cheese sauce.  Too much cheese. My sister picked the restaurant because she wanted a vegan-friendly option.  She had angel hair with marinara and veggies, but I don&#39;t see why any Italian restaurant couldn&#39;t accommodate that request. 
Also,I usually feel like Italian restaurants give huge portions.  After all, pasta is very cheap, so they might as well give you plenty.  No one at the table had any left overs, so the portions were not particularly big.  

There were two pluses of the end of the meal: We mentioned it was also my brother&#39;s birthday, so the waiter brought a piece of tiramisu.  Although between the 9 of us, we only ate a few bites as it wasn&#39;t that good. Also, the waiter realized the service as sub-par and did not add an 18% gratuity to the check so that we could tip fittingly. We still left a decent tip, but I appreciate that the waiter acknowledged the less than satisfactory service."

When it came to having our checks split and adding the $5 coupon code you can use when you sign up for the first time with your email, the waitress said she couldn&#39;t add both of our coupons to the system, that it wouldn&#39;t allow it, so we combined our checks and only used of our coupons.

Personally, I&#39;m a fan. I&#39;ve been here several times and each time has been great. On a whim, we decided to come here on a Saturday night which is pretty busy anywhere you go. Knowing that, we decided to call ahead. Wait time for a table was 45 minutes, so we asked if we could make a reservation. They asked for a time and said it was okay. That may have been because it would be about 45 minutes until we got there, but at least this ensured that we would have a table upon arriving.

It&#39;s a pretty nice area with wine bottles lined everywhere and a kitchen you can see into. The tables are lined with paper and the waiters draw their name in crayon. They also leave the crayons behind so you can doodle which helps pass the time. I ordered the chicken parm for $13. While we waited for our food, we were served some bread which was one of the best breads I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s drizzled in olive oil and salt and has such a great flavor to it and it&#39;s super fresh. Dip it in some more oil and please your tastebuds. 

It did take a while for our food to come but they were pretty busy. I probably should have ordered some wine to make the time go by even faster! But the food is worth the wait. Fresh mozzarella cheese melted on three pieces of lightly breaded chicken and some thin pasta on the side. Grilled cherry tomatoes on top gave it a nice, sweet touch. I probably could have finished my meal, but I wanted to bring some home to have for lunch the next day.

Definitely don&#39;t expect to be in and out very quickly, but if you have time and enjoy yourself, you&#39;ll have a good time."

Before I give my two cents, I will disclose that we got take-out, so I can only speak for the food, not the service.

The Good:

After calling with are order, they said our food will be ready in 15 minutes. By the time I got there, the food was ready. I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. Love it!

The Bad:

The food sucks!

My wife got the mushroom ravioli, and it was burned to a crisp. It tasted like processed food, not like food from a good Italian restaurant.

I was going to take a picture of it to post here, but my camera wanted nothing to do with it.

I got some chicken, mushroom pasta dish. It was soggy like a wet sock and tasted about the same. Honestly though, it was bland. The whole dish was very unappetizing.

I&#39;m not that picky of an eater. I&#39;ll scarf down frozen dinners like it&#39;s my last meal before an execution. Rammen Noodles? Bring it on!  Fast food? Can&#39;t get enough. And I even have the high cholesterol to prove it.

Yet I couldn&#39;t finish my meal from this place.

My son got the classic spaghetti and meatballs. It must have not been too bad because he ate a lot of it and didn&#39;t complain. Granted, he&#39;s only 1-years old. But he seemed happy.

I threw all the leftovers down the disposal, except for the spaghetti. 

The Verdict:

No, I wouldn&#39;t recommend this restaurant even if someone was holding a gun to my head.

The only redeeming quality this place has is their website has a food allergy list. My son is allergic to eggs, so we really appreciate that.

If it weren&#39;t for that, I&#39;d only give it one star.

I think I&#39;ll go to McDonalds now."

As others will, I VIVIDLY recall when they would have singing waiters. In many cases, I felt embarrassed for them. It was really an intrusion. Just take my order and bring me my food, as ordered, in a decent amount of time. I don&#39;t need to hear about your music studies at DePaul and how you want to sing &#34;Rigoletto!&#34;

In recent years, when I do go there, I have done much more take out than eat in. It&#39;s OK. Every once in a while, they will &#34;shake up&#34; the menu a bit, but it seems to be more about giving the same old stuff new names rather than adding new dishes.

The atmosphere inside is cozy and nicely lit. Parking is plentiful and the bathrooms are usually maintained. Given the age of the decor, I would say that it&#39;s time for a facelift to freshen up the place.

I would hope that they would open up the menu to gluten free patrons. It&#39;s time to get on the stick with that."

Very impressed with this location. You should know I picked you over any of the nearby competitors.  Thanks for always making it a great experience!!"

The name alone puts me in a good mood.  The ambiance is great because it makes me feel like I&#39;m dining outside with the high ceiling, strings of light bulbs and huge stone columns.  The service was great and I felt like I was on a mini-vacation.  I wish all meals could feel this wonderful.

The warm bread that comes out before the meal goes great with the olive oil (poured from a huge economical sized bottle at the table) and Parmesan cheese (which the waitress will freshly grate for you upon request).  If you&#39;re done with the loaf by the time your meal comes, the waitress will ask if you want another.  How thoughtful, but I had to turn down the offer or else there would be no room for dessert.

Lobster Ravioli was creamy and delicious and I really enjoyed the artichokes in the Chicken Scaloppine.  The best part about the Chocolate Cake is the homemade ganache drizzled on the top. Mmmm...

The portions are small on the American standard chart, but it suits me well.  I don&#39;t feel overwhelmed by having a mountain of food sitting in front of me.  Since the portions are smaller, it makes this restaurant on the pricey side.

I gave 5 stars not because it&#39;s a 5 star restaurant, but because I really enjoyed my experience here.  It&#39;s a chain restaurant, but I think it&#39;s a lovely one."

I was able to try them the week of Christmas. My bf and I met his family there for dinner. As we walked in I said oh wow this place has pretty decor and I like the layout. It is not super big but the tables are spread out somewhat decent. 

We met them at a corner table near the wall which worked out well. They serve a warm Rosemary bread which was just yummy. I could not stop eating it. The menu had several good items to pick from. 

We all started off with an order of the Fresh Mozzarella Fritta which whee cheese-sticks. A bit disappointed that only got I believe three or four. we also got the Tomato Bruschetta which I loved. I was SO happy I could eat it because I don&#39;t/won&#39;t eat onions and this had none. :) Good size portions on that one. 

I ended up playing it safe (only because I was sick earlier that day) and choose the Pollo Caprese which was lemon chicken and pasta. It was very good! My bf ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and said it was good. His brother ordered the Chicken Parmigiana. Great presentation on that dish. His father ordered the Lasagna Al Forno. It was not a big portion but I am sure it was good and his wife ordered the Chicken Scaloppine I THINK. Gosh I can&#39;t remember the name of her dish but it looked very good. 

We all decided to get the chocolate cake that I heard about. One slice and we just all dug in. It was very tasty! Moist and not too rich. All in all good experience with good people. :)

I have to say I think I will give them another try. 

Cheers!"

If you want more detailed information keep reading... We had an 8:15 reservation, we expected it would be busy due to Valentine&#39;s Day so arrived early at 7:45 to have a drink and appetizer at the bar. We checked in when we arrived and confirmed our 8:15 reservation with the hostess, and let her know we would be waiting in the bar. The bartenders were so deep in the weeds that it took 10 minutes for them to acknowledge us even though we were 1 of three couples seated at the bar. Now it&#39;s 8:30, recheck in with the hostess &#34;so sorry we&#39;re running a little behind&#34; she says. They overbooked the restaurant on valentines day, how inconsiderate, now there is a real backup of people blocking the entrance, waiting for their reservations. I tried to be patient and understanding, but now it&#39;s 9:00, we are still not seated and neither of the 2 hostesses have come to update us. At this point I decided to go and complain to the hostess and inform her that we are walking out because of the ridiculousness of the situation, this is the same hostess that I spoke to two other times but now she can&#39;t find my reservation, and initially looks at me like we have never spoken before. Eventually there is memory recall, and she apologizes profusely, and begs us to stay, and promises that she will make it up to us with free appetizers and a dessert.  My wife and I take a minute to decide, we would rather have drive through Portillos at this point, but because we are both starving we stayed to get some food, big mistake. Okay now are seated, and the one highlight of this review is going to be that they happen to seat us next to my cousin and his wife, but the waiter takes 10 minutes to come and talk to us, once he does, he is very good at his job, he takes our appetizer orders and they do come out quickly. Our entrées were good, except three of the meatballs were cooked into rocks, things don&#39;t seem to be getting better. We got cheesecake for dessert and that was delicious, but then we waited another 20 minutes for our waiter to come back and give us our bill, we don&#39;t understand why because the restaurant is pretty much empty at this point. We paid and left knowing that we would never eat here again."

My girlfriend and I swung by while shopping at Denada Square and I foolishly made the comment &#34;Oh yeah, I have been there before it was pretty good!&#34;...My bad.

We were sat promptly. Waited in the empty section for the server to finally come over. I was impressed with the lemonades, they were actually good.

The oil and pepper? Meh.

Our server had very little personality. He did his job though so I can&#39;t fault him there. Just saying though, if I  worked for tips and it was dead... TALK to your table.

The food was alright. The chicken parmesan was alright? Slightly burnt. The spaghetti that came with it was bland and very oily. And the Penne Rustica... Shrimp was overcooked, and the overwhelming flavor of something I could not get a hold on kinda made the dish tough to eat.

All in all I would say I will not be returning. I&#39;d rather go to Olive Garden."

Mac and cheese was very good, with tasty bread crumbs. Unfortunately there was very little of the promised proscuitto. My wife had the &#34;Create your own pasta&#34; with bow tie, spinach, and arabiatta. Pretty good once the spices kicked in she said.

The waitress, Melissa, came back two or three times before she finally took our order. Our appetizers took another 20 minutes to being out. After appetizers, we had to request to have our plates cleared because they&#39;d been sitting there for a while. And than the waiting continued...for another 15 to 20 minutes! We finally got food to our table...which was pretty good, hence why they get two stars rather than just one. I had the penne rustica, which was pretty delish!

My server did&#39;nt believe for one minute that anything was missing &amp; he was POSITIVE that he placed them in the order.

The food is okay but I have had better pasta. The service was bad. It was slow... Really slow. We were there for ten minutes before the waitress came over. She took the drink order and brought out one drink and the other one had to be made at the bar. We didn&#39;t get that one go 15 min.

I super-extra-heart their delicious warm bread served with olive oil and cracked pepper, and that alone keeps me coming back.  I always get the lobster ravioli or seafood portofino, and both are equally delicious.  The desserts are awesome, especially the ginormous chocolate cake with real chocolate sauce on it.

But... last time I went, I had the Worst Waitress Ever.  First, she forgot my stepmom&#39;s salad.  Then, when dad mentioned the salad was non-existent, waitress said, &#34;Oh, I&#39;m sorry.&#34;  After a ten second pause, she says, &#34;Oh, do you still want it?&#34;  Then, I ask her for something and she snaps, &#34;Just wait a second, ok?!&#34;  Later, I ask for something (milk, cream, whatever) other than corn syrup / soybean oil creamer for my coffee (I swear they had cream last time I came in), and she tells me I can&#39;t have cream, but she&#39;ll give me milk.  In a ramekin.  Wahoo. My ravioli was gummy on the top as though it had been nuked one too many times.   And finally, when my coffee was refilled, it had at least a teaspoon of grounds in it (I do not exaggerate... I had to rinse out my mouth).  

I&#39;m not  a jerk to servers.  I say please and thank you and I always tip above 20%.  I understand people have bad days, but c&#39;mon, really?  Do ya have to be THAT rude?  It wasn&#39;t even that busy, either.  There was hardly anyone there.

I hope it was an aberration and that this kind of service will never ever ever reoccur when I dine there, because, I really, really like the bread and I would give it 5 stars if it weren&#39;t for the crappy service.

Portion size was a bit disappointing and it came out warm, not hot.  The ravioli itself was okay, but restaurant sit-down quality?  meh.

Atmosphere and location are good though.  Located in South Wheaton off of Naperville road there&#39;s shopping and other things to do in the area.  The interior is pretty nice, I came here to celebrate my nephew&#39;s birth ( few years back) and the back room was separated out for us, which was nice.

You&#39;re not even in the city, near Italian immigrants.  You&#39;re in Wheaton.  With that said, this is a nice chain restaurant.  Everything is polished, from the cliche wall of wine bottles to the dim lighting and decor.  Someone looked at a picture of an Italian restaurant in a travel guide and did a great job of creating an Americanized version.  They always have huge vases of fresh flowers sitting around too, which I consider a nice touch.

I find something I&#39;m excited to order off their menu every visit.  Which I then struggle to finish after stuffing myself with the free bread and olive oil.  The bread comes warm out of the oven and melts in your mouth.  Awesomeeee.  It&#39;s probably my fav restaurant bread.  My go-to entree is the seafood linguine - although don&#39;t make the mistake of looking up the nutrition information online.  I always thought it was a relatively healthy choice but no.  Not even close.  If you want healthy, stay home and make yourself a salad.  I like the house wine they bring around in jugs.  I&#39;m not a wine expert but it makes me happy.

The staffers are great.  My waiter remembered me from 5 months prior.  That guy must see hundreds of people each day and he remembered.  The hostesses are quick and friendly and they let you pick your table if it isn&#39;t crowded.

More specifically, I&#39;m a Chicago girl.

So it&#39;s not often that I get to DuPage County for any reason, but work took me out there and I decided to test the culinary delights of our fair county to the west.

I met up with a friend who lives in Wheaton and she suggested this restaurant and it...wasn&#39;t bad. It reminded me of an Italian-themed Bennigan&#39;s. The food was neither &#34;authentic&#34; nor extraordinary but it...wasn&#39;t bad. Resolutely &#34;so-so&#34;.

I initially had the unremarkable Pasta Milano, which was advertised as this savory roasted chicken, sun-dried pasta in garlic cream sauce dish. I had to search for the chicken and I think they gave me the one little piece of sun-dried tomato they had left. The &#34;cream&#34; sauce was little more than salty, gray water.

To her credit, my server saw that it wasn&#39;t so much to my liking and very quickly switched me out to her original recommendation, the Chicken Marsala.  Better,  but not outstanding.

The service was outstanding, however, and much appreciated. Would I dine at Romano&#39;s Macaroni Grill again? Probably not. It&#39;s tepid Italian at it&#39;s best. I have to believe DuPage County has better."

I had a chicken pasta dish with spinach and red peppers.  I thought it was good but right along par with dishes that I have had at the Olive Garden.  Just for lunch, my pasta dish cost $10 and if you want a soup or salad, that costs extra.

Our last visit was a different story.  It was Mother&#39;s Day &amp; quite busy.  The service was slow &amp; the food was cold when we got it, but we tried to be understanding &amp; didn&#39;t complain.  However, my wife&#39;s pasta was all clumpy &amp; stuck together.  Seeing as it was Mother&#39;s Day, I wanted at least her meal to be good, so I mentioned this to our waiter.  Instead of offering to rectify the problem, his response was, &#34;pasta does that sometimes.&#34;  REALLY???  Needless to say, we haven&#39;t been back there since, and we don&#39;t plan to."

Great Italian food is hard to find out here in the &#39;burbs.  Family wise it works with kids.  The wait can be long at dinner time, but they have that call ahead where you can put your name in before you leave.  They have a good bar area to wait in (sans kids) and the wine is good.

As far as the menu selection goes, stick with the house specials.  They also have this thing where you can make your own pasta dish by picking out the pasta type, sauce and other stuff to put in it like shrimp and veggies.  Some of the other food is bland-o, but they will add extra garlic if you ask.

The kids menu is good with macaroni and cheese (the baked kind), pizza, chicken fingers and I think burgers and hot dogs.  They also get  a free ice cream at the end of their meal.

The waiters here seem to have a hard time figuring out when you need help or want to be left alone.  We always give them the &#34;we have kids, don&#39;t strand us&#34; chat so we aren&#39;t in a panic when it&#39;s time to go.  They don&#39;t get that you only get so much time, like a timer on a bomb and then it explodes.  If you want dessert, let then know ahead of time, because it&#39;s hard to catch them after the food comes.

So this place is MUCH better than some of the other chains, but my favorite Italian food is still on the HILL in St. Louis!"

All 4 entrees were sort of watered-down versions of their previously glorious selves. I complained to headquarters and they sent me $10. I will try once more in a few weeks to see if it was a fluke or not.

It was a very thin Neopolitan crust and had quality toppings.  Pasta bowls are very large here, even for lunch.

You get some nice warm toasty bread and olive oil when you sit down.  It wasn&#39;t very crowded for a Friday lunch but this place does good business and has been around for many many years.

I think it does tend to be a bit more pricey than normal lunch places, but for sit down it&#39;s probably the right value.  Waitstaff was attentive and pleasant, keeping our sodas constantly filled."

Cute, romantic italian atmosphere with live table hopping opera singers, draw your date on your tablecloth crayons, and excellent freshly, made to order, italian food.

MY MEAL: 
The best Eggplant Parmigiano I&#39;ve ever had in my life- I ordered it without cheese, and they didn&#39;t mind at all (that&#39;s how you know it&#39;s freshly made to order). It was sooooo delicious and not heavy or salty like most italian places make it.  My (omnivorous) husband was jealous and stole a few bites himself. 

ALSO- try the italian sodas- they have MANGO! It&#39;s amazing.

THE VERDICT: Great for a date or a group, and your veg friends will have great options too!"

This place has three things that always has me coming back: the deliciously baked rosemary bread, the penne rustica, and the smothered chocolate cake. The bread is enough to bring one here, especially if you are really hungry. It is by far the best bread you can find at a chain restaurant, as it is warm, fluffy, and flavorful. Dipping it in the olive oil makes it even more all worthwhile. I have tried many dishes here and they are all great, but the penne rustica&#39;s rich, hearty flavor always has me ordering time and time again. The cake is devoured within a minute when splitting it with others because it is so moist and delicious, especially with ice cream on top melting from the hot fudge that&#39;s smothered on top.

We had a reservation, arrived about 5 minutes early, was checked off on the list and was handed the electronic &#34;wait to be called&#34; device and politely asked to  wait.  (We amused ourselves watching the rapid cooks reheat pasta, portion out food that they rapidly cooked or reheated.  Everything in the kitchen appeared to be well orchestrated and I certainly wouldn&#39;t be able to do their jobs.  They seemed focused and happy.  Several dishes that were served up sat for pick up quite a while which explained why our meals weren&#39;t very hot when they arrived.)  

After about 10 minutes of waiting, we were taken to a table on the floor that was right in the middle of waitstaff setting up tray stands, the &#34;island&#34; where waiters and the bus staff would replenish their place settings, glasses, and so forth.  I knew that I would not enjoy my meal among this business and kindly requested the available booth that was about to be reset.  We were politely ushered back to the waiting area and were obliged to wait another 7 minutes or so until we were signaled that the booth was ready.  The booth was in the left, rear of the dining room away from all the action and for that I was grateful.  Our waitress, Melissa&#39;s initial greeting and explanation of the &#34;Blackboard&#34; specials was fine, however, her service was mediocre.  The restaurant was busy which may have impacted her service, however, of this I am uncertain.  Once she served us our meals, she never checked back in with us.

Menu has been changed.  All Ala cart

Bread was tasty and warm.

2 for $9 Appetizers/Italian Tapas:  
Spicy Ricotta Meatballs - arrived lukewarm, sauce was tasty, meatballs were spicy and fairly tasty
Baked Prosciutto &amp; Mozzarella - arrived lukewarm, served with a flat bread, overall this dish was nothing special and could easily be made at home and served at a warmer temperature

Pasta Milano - overly seasoned with what I think was rosemary (but not sure)/I didn&#39;t finish it; not to my liking
Penne Rustica - our daughters ordered this dish; flavorful and filling; again, it arrived warm, not hot
Blackboard Special - Squash Ravioli in a Truffle sauce with prosciutto, a tasty dish but looked as though it sat (pasta was stiff and not hot)

I won&#39;t be back.  If you go, go on a less crowded night.  You may get better service and hot food."

Of course, there are more expensive and classier sushi restaurants in the Naperville area, however, you simply cannot beat the price for the quality of food they provide. They have a great selection of appetizers along with their AYCE special. I would recommend going in for lunch, if you do not want to pay extra for (almost) the same food options. 

I also appreciate the owner responding to almost every review. I just wanted to convey my thoughts about the interior. Immediately when you walk in, you can&#39;t help but notice how dim the lights are. Though the interior is not in bad condition, I think Sakura could benefit with some new interior designing, and definitely some better lighting. The current atmosphere is almost depressing, but I still go back for the food and service. Also wish there were at least one dessert item on the AYCE menu. Best of luck Sakura!"

You can tell the level of professionalism here just with that and the fact that dirty dishes are stacked in a bin right in the middle of this place as everyone eats. Atmosphere and customer service already gets a 1 star right off of the bat as the lady rudely places just one menu and one all you can eat ticket in front of TWO of us. 

We order about 5 rolls to start only for the waiter to tell us that one of the specialty rolls is no longer available but is somehow still on the chef&#39;s specials list... a bit disappointing there. The sushi comes and there&#39;s a little bit of fish but almost 2 layers of rice!!! Everything was super stuffed with this rice that&#39;s not even meant for sushi. It was some weird thick rice so you clearly see they are trying to fill you up as soon as possible to meet profit margins. It&#39;s unfortunate because the sushi isn&#39;t terrible but the rice was a huge turn off.

Second and lastly,  we order a second round.  NOTHING we ordered was spicy. We made sure of it because the first round had a few spicy rolls that caught us by surprise and made us drink a ton of water. (Also the waiter topped our water just once in a 2 hr span) Round two ended up being super spicy somehow! You can clearly see they are trying to make you full on just water and rice. I even took pictures of how small the actual fish servings were! Finally the menu is a copy cat from Sakura in Westmont but a far cry from the same quality. I strongly suggest the Westmont location but highly suggest you avoid this place like the plague. Checks came in and not so much of a thank you... just dropped them on the table without giving it to any of us and walked away. Vet rude, poor quality, and penny pinchers. Not a place for sushi if you want your money&#39;s worth."

The AYCE menu includes:
-Appetizers (miso soup, salad, edamame, tempura, etc.)
-Sushi (Nigiri)
-Maki Rolls
-Chef specials

Instead of wasting stomach space on drinks, I order the miso soup to quench my thirst between bites.  The rice ball that comes with the nigiri is just a tad too much, but I find that a typical thing for AYCE place.  The sushi and rolls are fresh and tasty.  Some of my favorites include vegetable tempura, Spider Crunch Roll, Shrimp Tempura Crunch Roll, Sakura Crunch Roll, and Sakura Roll .  The sweet &amp; spicy chicken from the specials menu isn&#39;t very good.

Make sure your eyes are not bigger than your stomach because they will charge you for any left over pieces (I&#39;ve never had to test this out).  

PRICE: All you can eat $15/lunch and $20/dinner.  They have a special 20% discount 7 days a week except holidays from 230p-430p for $16/dinner buffet.  If you join their mailing list, you can get a 10% off coupon for AYCE anytime.  They also have a wine and beer menu that is perpetually 50% off.

SERVICE: Service is typically good.

I was super excited to be eating my first meal as well as experiencing an actual &#39;all you can eat&#39; restaurant for sushi.

It was $20 per person and you are provided with a menu of the different selections of sushi you could order. You could order as much as you want, hence all you can eat, but what I didn&#39;t know is that you get charged for each piece of sushi/roll you don&#39;t finish. That stopped me from checking off everything on the list and just ordering what I knew I wanted to eat.

The sushi wasn&#39;t top quality - rice was falling apart when I tried to pick it up with chopsticks and the size of the sushi/roll was a lot smaller than what I&#39;m used to. I did enjoy the miso soup and the spicy/crunchy rolls on the menu however. I guess for the price it was okay, I did get full with only one menu selection. I was told you will be given another menu every time you want to order. 

I think we should have ordered more and got our money&#39;s worth, but bf wasn&#39;t feeling well that day. We only came cause it was less than a mile drive away from his place and I was a bit hungry. Too bad though, as I could see myself liking the all you can eat sushi here."

I&#39;m typically not a stickler with customer service, especially if you are getting sushi for as cheap as you are here, however there comes a point when the poor service just becomes ridiculous. 

I came in with four other people well before closing time and the hostess immediately rushes us while we are still standing at the door. Before we can even get waters, the waitress asks if we know what we want. At this point, I had no menu to look at yet and no pencil to mark what I wanted. The waitress knew this and continued to pester me. 

Sushi tasted fine but came with no wasabi, no ginger and no water refills. The waitress was eating and obnoxiously talking and laughing with her coworkers instead of paying attention to her tables. 

IMMEDIATELY upon receiving our food, the waitress told us to hurry up. I was kind of in disbelief that we were being rushed so much when we still had quite a long time before closing. We were not staying past closing time or being inconsiderate, so I don&#39;t understand why the poor treatment towards us. 

Afterwards while counting cash for the bill, the waitress STANDS AND WATCHES us count. Within one minute of us trying to organize the payment, she has asked more than twice if we were done counting. Clearly we were just trying to figure it out. It was obviously a bit hectic splitting cash between 5 people. The waitress, with the subpar service she was providing, did not offer to split the bill, which would have made the process much quicker. One of the people at my table asked her to please stand back and wait and just relax a second while we finished up and made sure we were giving enough.

I&#39;m assuming this upset the waitress, because while leaving, she had the audacity to make rude comments and talk back to us. She overstepped her boundaries as a waitress. This is no longer a customer service issue, it is the issue of being a decent person to others. We were polite the entire time and I&#39;m sad to say that we didn&#39;t receive the same treatment in return. 

Moral of the story is: I promise you, you can get better service while buying a hot dog and a pack of gum at a gas station."

My friends ordered food. they were about to order more. owner said: &#34;YOU SAID YOU ALREADY FINISHED ORDERING!!&#34; and rudely grabbed the menu out of their own hands! They were still reading the menu. Not yet done ordering. My friends were shocked. Speechless.

When food was delivered, female owner stated &#34;YOU ORDER A LOT OF FOOD, CAN YOU FINISH IT ALL?!?!? IF YOU DON&#39;T FINISH IT, YOU&#39;RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT!!!&#34;

Friends ordered 2 drinks. owner came back and gave only 1. My friends said but we ordered 2. Owner blurted out in a rude manner: &#34;WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME?!?! CAN&#39;T YOU SEE I HAVE A VISITOR HERE?!?!

Before they left, owner said: &#34;OK BEFORE YOU LEAVE YOU NEED TO EXERCISE CAUSE YOU ATE A LOT!!!&#34;

What a discrimination. I am never going to eat here and I am never going to refer people to this restaurant ever again."

Nothing says &#34;America&#34; like stuffing your face with food to comfort yourself!  I think the 3 rolls, an app and soup is my max, which is still a deal at $14.99, but I see people totally going whole hog with piles and piles of nigiri, so maybe I am missing out.  The crab puffs are delicious - like a mini crab Rangoon.  I forgot about the sauce issue on the shrimp tempura and got that again - the sweet sauce is growing on me.  Also tried the chicken teriyaki roll which surprisingly came with both siracha and spicy mayo!  That was one hot roll.

We typically go with the AYCE sushi, and love that it is served to your table. You also have the option of sitting at the sushi bar. Chef&#39;s specials are included in the AYCE and posted on a board, as they change from time to time. 

There is a wide variety of rolls and they never disappoint.The sushi is fresh tasting and delicious. We have never experienced a &#34;bad fishy taste&#34;, like you do at other restaurants. 

The staff is friendly and punctual. The restaurant is very clean and has a very nice atmosphere. There is usually soft music playing and low lighting - very cute.

The lunch all-you-can-eat special for $14.99 is simply too much value to pass up. The catch is that they charge you for each piece left over. This is a great place to bring medium to large parties to, though, and if you order more frequently with less portions, you shouldn&#39;t have too much left over. 

The sushi is quality, as well as their noodles and other dishes. I would recommend just getting sushi, though, so you don&#39;t waste your stomach on non-sushi stuff. This isn&#39;t the best sushi in the world, but it&#39;s definitely worth the price, and I love coming here.

I have never ever been disappointed with Sakura and have gone to eat there at least 4 or 5 times over the past year and a half. We have visited with a group of 8, a group of 4, and (most oftenly) as a couple. We always eat off of the All-You-Can-Eat menu. We always feel that we get a good value for our money.

I have enjoyed every single thing I&#39;ve ordered every single time I&#39;ve ordered it. The ambience of the restaurant is incredibly peaceful and enjoyable, but try to avoid the bathrooms here. They&#39;re a bit sketchy and usually freezing cold. Overall, a great choice!

Some General Tips About the All-You-Can-East Menu:

**$15/person before 2pm and $20/person after 2pm (including weekends)
**Several non-sushi items available (see photos for menu)
**Tips left go straight to management; individual waiters are paid a consistent wage, so there&#39;s no need to tip largely
**They do NOT charge you $1 per piece of sushi left uneaten, but be courteous!"

At Sakura I got good quality sushi, friendly, efficient service, no limits on what I ordered (as long as I actually ate it all), and a very good experience overall. I&#39;ll be coming back many times.

Every piece of fish on my plate was fresh, cut well, and tasted fantastic. The rice was seasoned perfectly and sticky enough to stay together without being cloying. I particularly enjoyed the salmon nigiri and the special roll called the &#34;Crunch Dragon&#34; roll.

There were very few things that brought this down from a five into the land of four:

1. Almost anything on the all you can eat menu that isn&#39;t sushi was simply not very good. The teriyaki chicken, for example (I got it because I just had to know how it was) had the consistency of pre-cooked-and-then-microwaved chicken.

2. The lighting. It was just so dark. This isn&#39;t too big of a deal when you go with a group but I went alone and was reading a book. It was hard on the eyes.

But seriously, that&#39;s it. The sushi was fantastic and well worth the cost. I will definitely be going back to enjoy this some more with my family and friends."

The last time that I went the service sucked, and the sushi was OK so I decided to give it another try.

So tonight I went back. I walked in no one greeted me, including the server standing right in front of me at the register. About a minute goes by and a server walks by and seats my boyfriend and I. He gave us menus and asked us what we wanted to drink.... We got our drinks and then no one ever came back!!!! We waited 30 minutes, I finished my drink and we got no service. I was so hungry and angry that we got up and walked out. The workers noticed us leaving but didnt even acknowledge us. We will never go back!!!

Unfortunately what will deter a lot of people is the service :/ I&#39;ve come here a few times with small parties (tables of 2 or 4) and as long as you don&#39;t mind flagging down the waitstaff it&#39;s not that bad. However, with larger groups (we came with 10) they don&#39;t do very well. I called around lunch time to make a reservation and told them that we would need to have separate checks. The person on the phone said not a problem. When we arrived, our table was ready and I reminded them that we needs separate checks again. 

The servers started taking orders and it as very chaotic since they started taking orders not knowing how we were going to split the checks. Although four of our table wanted to order off the AYCE menu, they said to put all the orders on one sheet. I thought this was weird, and asked to make sure that all the rolls came on separate plates since it was four orders at once. When the first order came, however, there were three of the same roll on one plate :( We did send it back, and it was the only time it happened.

Each time we needed something, I did have to flag down someone from the waitstaff to help us. Although they were accommodating and nice, it was definitely a pain. We also had to keep track of our rolls because we had to reorder four of our rolls because they never came out.

I toyed between a 2 star and a 3 star ( I really wish we could do a 2 1/2 star!) but because the food is very good and pretty fresh I erred on the higher side. If the service were to get better, this would definitely be a 5 star restaurant."

I&#39;ve been out here a few times when I&#39;ve met up some friends who live in the south suburbs, and I think the quality/service has gone down a little bit over the last few years.  The AYCE deal is good - $19.99 to choose from a pretty extensive list of apps, side dishes, and basic sushi rolls.  The fish is pretty fresh, if not very imaginative, but that&#39;s probably to be expected with an all you can eat type of joint. The one thing that they do NOT budge on is substitutions/modifications - this includes if you want less rice (my friend and I are currently try to shed some winter chub) - again not that big of a deal given how much you are paying for the meal.

I came here in a party of 2 and did the $15 AYCE for lunch. Although they have a smaller selection of offerings on the AYCE menu for lunch, this was understandable and is not what upset me. What was absolutely terrible was the fact that my friend and I only ordered 4 simple, maki rolls to share and we felt like we were not &#34;over-ordering&#34; and inconveniencing the sushi chefs who did not have anything close to a lunch rush going on. Either way, they decided to overpack our rolls with an embarrassingly large amount of rice. Each roll was cut up into pieces about 2 inches thick and 2 inches wide, and there was about a one centimeter diameter of fish in the middle. I wish I had taken a picture, but it was absolutely ridiculous! Is $30 not enough to convince you to make decent rolls? I was so embarrassed after raving to my friend about how great this place was based on my last visit. 

Furthermore, service is just downright unprofessional. Everyone seemed polite and attentive except when our checks came, my friend and I were paying separately, and my total came to $16.26. I put a $20 down and didn&#39;t get a single penny of change back, while my friend put down $18 on her $16.26 check and got all of her change back. I was going to leave the remaining ~$4 as a tip anyway but the fact that they just ASSUMED that that is what they were getting and that I wasn&#39;t adding/taking anything back was just plain rude and really was the cherry on top to a subpar, inadequate, cheaply made lunch that I paid $20 for! 

They say you can tell a lot about a place from its bathroom....after using the women&#39;s restroom, I&#39;m questioning the sanitation of my so-called &#34;sushi.&#34; Everything is broken down and stained and moldy and is definitely violating health codes.

Go somewhere else."

Here&#39;s the breakdown of our first experience:

1st Impression -
Happy Hour AYCE $15.99/person = awesome!! The price was pretty exciting. The host/server seemed nice enough, and we were seated promptly. I personally enjoyed their choice of Korean songs playlist.
However, we had to wave down our server a couple times before we could finally put in our order when it wasn&#39;t busy at all. When we asked questions about specific maki rolls, the server basically pointed at the menu and told us to read the description for more info in kind of an annoyed manner.

Atmosphere - 
It was dim inside, but it created a decent ambience - nothing fancy or unique per se. We saw a good mixture of Japanese and Korean decor which was cool.

- Now onto the most important part - FOOD - 
We were most excited about their AYCE sushi since several people have strongly recommended it to us. Sadly, I was disappointed from the second our plates arrived. Presentation was nonexistent which was tolerable, I guess, but the taste wasn&#39;t all that great - mediocre to say the least. Most of the rolls were literally huge balls of rice with a tiny bit of actual fish and other ingredients. My husband initally thought the food was decent until he had a few more pieces. 

To sum it up, the service provided was just ok, and the food was definitely disappointing to say the least. We weren&#39;t at all impressed overall. Not sure we will return again anytime soon even though we live walking distance."

For $14.99 all you-can-eat-lunch or $19.99 all you-can-eat-dinner, you can get a good amount of good sushi that is tasty and fast. Is it the highest-quality sushi you&#39;ll ever have? No. Obviously not. It&#39;s all you can eat. Do you expect to get the best steak in the world at Golden Corral? If you do, you&#39;re a fool. So stop fooling yourself and get to Sakura for a good sushi feast. We always leave happy. They have the standard rolls on the special and then have some specialty rolls available as well. There are SOME rolls that are not available for the all-you-can-eat special, but stop being cheap and just order it if you want. You are already going to get $50 of sushi for $15-20. Plus, this includes soup and appetizers. C&#39;mon, what a deal!

Buyer beware: For ever piece you order and don&#39;t finish, they&#39;ll charge you $1. They do this so they can stay in business! If you walk in and order 100 rolls and expect to take them all home, this place would shut its doors so fast. So they have to incentivize you to only order what you are going to eat. I&#39;ve made the mistake many times of ordering more rolls before I realized how full I was going to feel. Rice must really expand in your stomach, because man. There are times where I eat a couple rolls, and then 15 minutes later while I&#39;m waiting for rolls #3 or #4, BAM I&#39;m uncomfortably full.

One other thing...when you order your rolls, I&#39;d have them recite which rolls are which. We have gotten some incorrect rolls before that we&#39;re pretty sure the table next to us ordered. Sometimes I think they just bring out whatever. So if you ask them to point out which rolls are which, you may be a happier camper.

We love this place. There&#39;s definitely higher-quality sushi out there, but if we just want to shove a ton of sushi in our faces for a low price - instead of savor a few expensive, unique rolls - then this is where we head. It&#39;s a step up from going to a sushi buffet, because you aren&#39;t getting sushi that everyone in the restaurant has already breathed on...it&#39;s made to order!"

We had to get up, go to the front, and find the menus and then bring them to our table ourselves. Sounds petty, but it was pretty frustrating.

I&#39;ve also had the all-you-can-eat lunch/dinner a few times. On multiple occasions (each time I&#39;ve had the all-you-can-eat), the dishes we ordered never arrived. When we informed the waitress of this, she just told us to re-submit another form. If this only happened 1-2 times, I would&#39;ve brushed it off. But it kept happening over and over (trust me I&#39;m not exaggerating), which just didn&#39;t make any sense.

The only reason I&#39;m giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because I do have to admit I really like the food. However, I&#39;ve never experienced such awful service at a restaurant until I came here, and there are several other places where you can get tasty sushi with a lot better service."

It can mean different things to different people depending on how things play out when you converge. There&#39;s work friends, internet friends, family friends, girl-friends, guy-friends, friends with benefits, partner-in-crime friends, drinking buddy friends, old friends, frienemy friends, friends with kids, married friends, single friends, might-end-up-in-jail friends, etc, but I have another moniker for a particularly fruitful friendship between Andres D and I: We&#39;re AYCE Friends. 

We don&#39;t always go out to eat when we get together, but when we do, we ALWAYS go All You Can Eat. Or, AllYouCandiceEat as I like to call it, though admittedly, Andres D picks up a lot of my slack. 

So this was both our virgin visit to Sakura of Tokyo... of Naperville, and what had initially caught my eye was a review by Nichole K (follow her on Yelp!), as I know she&#39;s got some pretty discerning tastes when it comes to sushi (and beer and spicy food and all good things), and if homegirl says something is &#39;the best&#39;, I pretty much know I won&#39;t be disappointed. 

So I get there a little early (an anomaly in and of itself) and announce that I&#39;ll have another person joining me. The greeter-guy smiles, bangs a gong and tells me to follow him. Why can&#39;t everywhere be like this? 

So I&#39;m sat at a table across from the sushi bar, it&#39;s mostly quiet with only two other tables who finished up shortly after Andres arrives. There&#39;s a $14.99 AYCE lunch special, and though I&#39;m not sure exactly what time the menu switches over to dinner, we were there around 2:30/2:45 and they swapped our lunch menu prices for the $19.99 dinner menu, BUT, between 2:30 and 4:30, you get 20% off your entire bill, which came up on receipt as only a little of $15 per person. 

Their AYCE menu (and regular menu for that matter) is extensive (read: Menu is two feet tall and about 15 pages long). The AYCE menu includes their regular appetizer menu complete with standard miso, edamame and also udon noodle soup, gyoza, tonkatsu and more! There&#39;s a fantastic nigiri menu, a somewhat limited, specialty menu and about two dozen varied regular rolls. The sushi world was at our fingertips!

Andres and I are both miso addicts so we started and finished our meal with bowls of miso, in addition to accidentally ordering a Philadelphia Roll (we thought we&#39;d erased it), some unagi and super white tuna nigiri, a jalapeno spicy tuna roll (LOVED this and it was actually pretty spicy), a spicy California roll, crunch dragon roll, dynamite roll and green tea. 

Our service was friendly, though a bit slow, but as a former server, I know how awkward it can be when there&#39;s only one table in the entire restaurant and wanting to be there for them, without also pestering them. So our green tea were empty a few times, and I had to do a bit of flagging, but in their defense, I can chug a hot green tea on a cold, windy winter day like none other. 

I left super shocked that we were able to get such good quality sushi off an AYCE menu, and that it cost us less than $20 a person, including tax and tip. #SushiSteal"

Fast forward a decade and now I know better. 

I&#39;m going preface this review by saying:
1) I&#39;ve worked in a restaurant before. 
2) I&#39;m Korean. Nearly half of the sushi restaurants in the Chicago area are owned by Koreans, I have been to too many of them. (this one is really meant for other Koreans or Asians who &#34;distrust&#34; reviews from non-Asians...) 

Service: 1 star
Service is really terrible here, moreso than your usual Asian restaurant. 
No table setting and chopsticks were not given for us to eat our food until after our food came out. Our food came out at different times and some parts of our dish were missing (both are problems with the kitchen). 
Wait staff did not check up on us during the entire hour we were there. I almost shouted &#34;waiter&#34; and snapped my fingers at them because it was impossible to get their attention. Once I did manage to get their attention, they were pleasant to deal with. This points to a lack of training, which ultimately is an issue with management. 

Food: 3 stars
It&#39;s your average sushi place. Nothing great. Marginally better than grocery store pre-packaged sushi. All other entrees are too salty. Udon is not worth your money.

Is there new management? If there is, like someone else noted in a review, your management is getting worse and worse. 

Here is some unsolicited advice: 
1) Train your waitstaff. They should know the menu. They should also learn to check up on their tables without me having to desperately make eye contact with them. 
2) Speaking of the menu; it&#39;s impossible to read under that terrible lighting you have (which has been terrible for the past decade). Please make it easier to read. 
3) Please work with your kitchen. Clearly one sushi chef is not enough for you guys on a Sunday night. 

Head over to Yamado or Tanaka down the street (West, and East, respectively). Unfortunately, if it&#39;s a Sunday, you&#39;re outta luck because they&#39;re both closed."

It&#39;s the sushi place of choice whenever my friends and I want to go out. I&#39;ve only ever ordered off of their all you can eat menu, but there&#39;s enough there to satisfy. They have a huge selection of sushi and even appetizers, like miso soup. Yes, that means those appetizers are all you can eat, too!

The staff can be a little slow, but it&#39;s a small restaurant and there&#39;s not always a ton of people there to wait on customers. They don&#39;t always hand you another menu after your first round, but they have the sheets all over the place. Just help yourself to another and order away!

I&#39;ve never eaten at a really expensive sushi joint, but I think this place is great. You really can&#39;t beat the price. Maybe, if you&#39;re used to really expensive sushi, this place won&#39;t be for you, but or the average person, I think Sakura is the place to go!"

When it comes to quality: Over time we&#39;ve turned to this place as our &#34;poor budget&#34; sushi spot. When the paychecks are good, we hit no place else other than S****o at Rt59 &amp; N Aurora! Sakura&#39;s rolls are decent, and not overly wrapped in rice. But they just don&#39;t have the same taste quality that the upscale places do (knock on wood, we&#39;ve never gotten food poisoning, but that&#39;s how questionable this place can be).

In a nutshell, I guess  you get what you pay for: the &#34;bar&#34; is non-functioning, the service is extremely slow, the bathrooms are always &#34;ghetto-rigged&#34; with a broken sink or toilet..... and, we were there this weekend and watched the bus boy walk out of the kitchen with a stack if soy bowls, bring them to the wait station which was less than  3 feet from us, DROP one of the bowls on the floor, and picked it right up and put it back in the pile of &#34;clean&#34; dishes to set the tables with. I mean seriously, if you&#39;re going to do that sh*t, don&#39;t do it IN FRONT of customers. wtf....

At that point we lost our appetite, and as of typing this, I changed my rating from 2 to 1 stars. We aren&#39;t food snobs by any measure, but I just can&#39;t with this place anymore.... Get it together."

We politely said hello to the hostess who just ignored us. We politely said hello to the staff each time they (the six) walked by us and asked when we could be seated.

I&#39;ve driven near and around this place a number of times because I frequent the Naperville Joy Yee&#39;s a lot but I&#39;ve never gone inside.  Looked dingy from the outside so I didn&#39;t pay much mind to it.  We decided to go there for lunch to celebrate the bf and I&#39;s 10 monthiversary.

I scrolled through some preview reviews and saw a lot of one stars.  Maybe my experience is different since I came in on a Monday at 3pm.  My boyfriend and I were one of two groups there.  It was pretty dead so the service was quick.  There was only one person there to wait on us.  He hovered around us a bit too much when were the only ones there in the beginning.

The inside was decorated plainly for the most part with the compulsory lattice board dividers and etc.  Lighting was super dark.  Normally this wouldn&#39;t be a problem for people because it sets a certain ~mood~ I guess, but as the typical Asian that I am I enjoy taking pictures of my food and the conditions were not ideal (I refuse to use flash in a public setting).  Played some current music and even some k-pop.  Which was a little out of place considering the not-so-trendy atmosphere.

They have a huge AYCE menu.  It&#39;s $19.99/person regardless of lunch or dinner, I think, but luckily for us we made it to Happy Hour so it was 20% off.  The waiter just gave us the piece of paper with a menu and didn&#39;t really explain how any of it worked.  The paper had the names of rolls with no descriptions so I was confused.  I just went off my general sushi knowledge when ordering.  When we gave our order, I opened up the menu out of curiosity and saw that they had all the rolls in there with pictures and descriptions.  Would&#39;ve helped to know about that.

We got a few appetizers that were pretty basic.  Tried the bulgogi and it was okay.  I don&#39;t remember all the rolls we got but it was pretty good.  Not out-of-this-world or life-changing, but good for the price.  There was a lot of rice though.  They didn&#39;t do much in terms of presentation.  Kind of just arranged them on a plate.  I appreciate good presentation because I tend to eat food with my eyes first.

Overall I had a good experience.  Based on the previous reviews I probably shouldn&#39;t try to go here with a big group or during a busy weekend.  But if you&#39;re looking for a quick sushi fix, I&#39;d head here on a random weekday in the early afternoon."

On top of that, there was a huge puddle of water around our table the entire time we were there afterwards. On top of that, he forgot our order TWICE. During the second time, I reminded him that we were still waiting for our food but it seemed like he completely forgot. When I reminded him a second time after that, he blamed it on the sushi chef.

A group of friends and I came here on a Saturday for the all you can eat deal. They raved about it and insisted that we go so I decided to make the 50 min trip (I live in the city) to Naperville for this allegedly wonderful sushi buffet. I was not impressed. 

My friends were already seated and upon my arrival, the server handed me menus and told me to bring them to my table. Um...isn&#39;t that what YOU are paid to do? If you wanted me to get my own menus, you should&#39;ve told me it was a self service restaurant. 

We asked for a round of water. It took about 45 min. FOR WATER. WTF. 
Miso soup took about 50 min to come, and required several reminders. 
They kept bringing sushi to the wrong table and they also kept us waiting a long time for the sushi to be made. It was ridiculous.

Clearly they were understaffed and the staff that was on hand was inexperienced and lacked a sense of urgency and common sense.  The food wasn&#39;t even that great.  

My friends were surprised by the experience we had; apparently the quality of this place has deteriorated. It was my first time and needless to say, also my last.

I ordered 4 pieces of salmon off the AYCE menu. None came. 

Second time around, I asked for 4 again. None came. 

When I asked if the salmon was coming (since they charge a la carte for any left overs, and I didn&#39;t want to fill up and find out that 8 pieces of salmon are coming), the waitress asked the sushi-chef, and came back telling me that they were out of salmon. This was at 1pm on a Wednesday.

I was a bit disappointed, but I figured that things like this sometimes happens. Then I overhear a person at the bar order 2 pieces of salmon, and the chef gave it to her. So I asked the waitress why was I being refused service, but that the other patron was not. When the waitress asked the sushi chef, he raised his voice with an annoyed look, asking which table keeps asking for salmon. When I saw this ridiculous response, I raised my voice, asking how they call this an &#34;all you can eat&#34; while refusing to serve certain foods that are clearly on the list of available options. He said, &#34;OK! One piece, that&#39;s it!&#34;

The waiter took our order, and a while later brought us our sushi order. However, that was all that he brought us. The hot food items from the kitchen were never put in the system until we questioned. By that time, we have already finished our sushi for a while. The waiter took the order paper away so it was difficult for us to recall what we have ordered. 

The waiter brought out water for my friends, but my husband and I waited for our soft drink. The girl who was waiting the table next to us brought the customer coke right after he ordered. Did not know why ours took so long. And he did not refilled our water and drinks until we asked. 

Most of the time, our waiter wasn&#39;t around when we needed something. So we had to ask the waitress to help us.

Around half an hour before closing, they started the closing process by turning off the TV, the light at the sushi bar and such. It made us feel rushed. After they rang us up, the dinner for us was around $80, however the subtotal came back to be $85 before tax. There was no explanation whatsoever regarding this matter. When they brought back to us the credit card for signature, then they tell us that &#34;just so you know, we will charge you a la carte for the sushi that you did not finished.&#34; Which was $1/piece.

You should only come here if you love rice and rice piled on and with everything.  Or bring a bag that you can throw all the extra rice into because you will need it!

As one could expect; the portions of the sushi rolls you get have very small pieces of actual fish and are surrounded by a garden of sushi rice.  You can even tell they stuck extra pieces on it.  The people that have given this place high ratings clearly do not know much about sushi.  The quality is not great at all.  When our waiter brought our food to us, he said &#34;I&#39;m not really sure what type of sushi this or that one is, but hope its right&#34;....W the F lol.  

Service is terrible and super slow.  Servers do not make eye contact with you after you place your order.  If you order tempura or ask for and sauces; only expect to receive a splash of tempura sauce or spicy mayo.  Never came by with our water refills.  

Both the waiters. tall skinny guy and this girl...dumb as nails.  

We really didn&#39;t eat much because we were so full form the rice, but I will say; that we felt ill when we were in there after we ate.  And it wasn&#39;t food coma....it was something else.

This was the 3rd time we&#39;ve eaten here and although the first two times the service was not great we decided to give it another try. Today we (5 of us) came at 9:15pm and were told that we would need to order before 9:45pm as the kitchen would be closed. The closing time on Yelp states 10:30pm. We sat down and the waitress gave us menus and came back a minute later so ask for our order...rushing us to put our order in. We asked for another minute and but had 1 all you can eat order ready. She refused to take the order and said we had to have everyone&#39;s order in all together.  She told us to hurry up and order. We rushed to give her the order since she wouldn&#39;t leave. Our order came and we finished eating a few minutes before 10pm. No wasabi and no ginger. No water refill. We had to ask for food that was ordered but never delivered. During this time we were served by 3 people all were rude to us. One the waitress would bring the food to our table and kind of throw it there and just say &#34;HERE&#34;. Very rude! My husband asked for a refill on his Sprite and the waitress sighed as she walked away. She then came back and poured water in his glass but only 1/3 full and walked away. Not even giving us a chance to let her know that we asked for Sprite not water. Who refills water only 1/3 of the way? When the bill came we were getting our money together as we paid in cash. The waitress stood at the table to watch us count our money. At this point I asked her to step away and give us a minute so we can count the money. She refused said that she had to closed out the register. WTF...who does that? Worse experience ever and would never come back. BTW I also own a business and would never treat people this way. If I could I would give them a zero stars.

A place I&#39;ve been coming to a VERY long time, and now my sister is also hooked on it! 

Since, I&#39;ve been coming here I&#39;ve experienced a wide range of service, but for the most part is has been pretty good over the years :) 

Look in your mailers and online for discounts on your meal and/or sign up for the emails to get them sent right to you! 

Most recently I went here yesterday, the spicy tuna was a little milder than in the past but still delicious! Their fryer was also spitting out some quite delicious appetizers like gyoza and vegetable tempura. 

One of my favorite rolls of theirs is the Crunchy Dragon! :)"

I got a coupon in the mail for $5 off another local sushi place.  But I thought, &#34;tonight I&#39;d really like AYCE sushi instead.&#34;  So we headed to Sakura of Tokyo.

As soon as we walked in, it felt warm and friendly.  A white, glistening Christmas tree was positioned near the entrance, and a man (presumably the owner?) greeted us with his arms wide open.  &#34;Hellooo!&#34; he said, &#34;I will clean a table, just one minute please,&#34; and that&#39;s really about how short our wait was.  A minute, maybe.  It was quite busy also.

It is clean, and it is not too dark in here.  The lighting is a little dim, but still bright enough that you can read your menu without any eyestrain.  The walls are a peach/light amber color, with bamboo accents on the walls.  This is not at all dirty or dusty like others have commented on.

We eagerly filled out our AYCE form:  gyoza, crab puffs, tempura calimari, and an assortment of rolls.  

The gyoza was good.  The outside was crispy, I think it was deep fried.  Although it wasn&#39;t typical gyoza, I really like it this way.  The crab puffs were a fried food, cream cheese lover&#39;s dream!  I don&#39;t want to be honest about how many orders we had of these.  But I ate almost every single one.  Don&#39;t get the tempura calimari, it is absolutely awful.  It was very chewy.  We ate all of it though, because if you don&#39;t you will be charged for food you did not eat.

The shrimp tempura crunchy roll was good.  Not too much rice, and a nice crunch on the outside.  We also ordered the rainbow roll, better than many I&#39;ve had, although some pieces fell apart.  The jalapeno spicy tuna roll is the best spicy tuna roll I&#39;ve had.  It&#39;s like I finally met the &#34;spicy&#34; in &#34;spicy tuna.&#34;  The spicy California is just okay, the spicy just comes from a sauce they put on top of the roll.

I&#39;m 50/50 on how I feel about the Dynamite roll.  A red chili pepper on the menu denoted it&#39;s spiciness, but it did not list &#34;chunks of jalapeno&#34; in the description.  It is a deep fried roll, and even though I usually don&#39;t like deep fried rolls, this one was very good.  Except for the jalapeno.  The first piece I had, there was a chunk of jalapeno and it burned the side of my tongue and I started coughing like a dragon smoked some Marlboros.  I picked at the next few pieces, removed the jalapeno hunks, and found a delicious deep fried roll beneath that horror.

Our server was very nice, but another girl who delivered the plates to the tables dropped our sushi and left before she identified the rolls for us.  She could use some polishing, but the girl who waited on us for the majority of the time was on the ball.  They thanked us on the way out, and we&#39;ll definitely be back for all you can eat sushi.  

I would not go back for a la carte though.  There are still better sushi places closer to my backyard for that."

The food is excellent and I always recommend this place to friends of mine.  That being said, here&#39;s why I&#39;m only giving it 3 stars: Over the past year this restaurant has replaced their mature and knowledgeable waitstaff with a bunch of kids who don&#39;t know their you know whats from a hole in the ground.  Now while it isn&#39;t the worst service I&#39;ve received, it&#39;s certainly not as good as it used to be.  There&#39;s no reason why I should have to remind them what I ordered when it&#39;s clearly written on a piece of paper.
***UPDATE***  Went here with a friend a couple of weeks ago and the service seemed to improve a bit.  I guess the big difference depends on what time of the day you go.  I seem to get better service during the afternoon rather than the evening."

Soft shell crab roll was mushy like it was pre cooked awhile ago. Salmon sushi was good. Served each dish separately and although I asked for edamame as appetizer they were served half way through the meal. Dirty dishes sitting near eating tables and a disheveled office open to dining room. Not the best

I had the bulgogi which was a little over cooked and drenched in garlic but still edible. My friend however, ordered the short ribs and the food was very under cooked. The waiter said he could re heat it up but since they do not really get that specific order a lot they do not know the specifics on cooking it. Not a good thing to tell a customer whose already paranoid on getting food poisoning. He did say if it was not cooked the second time they will refund us, my friend did not even touch the ribs after the second re heating and they still charged them. 

Overall, minus the poor cooking on the short ribs, i may give this place another try just to see the sushi. It just is unfortunate that the cooks don&#39;t know how to cook all the items on the menu or that the waiter would express that.."

Both the Naperville and Lombard locations have been top notch.

Now, this place isn&#39;t the place to bring a date to show off your sushi snobbery. There is much fancier sushi out there, but for a casual sushi lunch or dinner it&#39;s perfect.

The maki and negiri are both solid, good balance of rice, fish, and everything else.
I&#39;ve never had a bad piece of sushi here. Unlike some of the other all you can eat sushi houses that make sushi in large batches, refrigerate, then leave out on a counter for guests to take this place makes everything to order. So, my shrimp tempura crunch roll has a piece of hot , crunchy tempura shrimp in it, not cold, mushy breading.

Sauces are good, service is good, and you can&#39;t beat the $20 dinner and $15 lunch specials.

My wife, training partners, and I like to come hear almost every week after our training session ( for powerlifting ) and pig out. On a good day I&#39;ll eat 15 rolls by my self, I&#39;d go broke doing that anywhere else that serves the same quality sushi.

My highlights are the teriyaki beef rolls, shrimp tempura crunch roll, saki ( mono), and the spicy tuna rolls. 

It should be noted that they do serve other traditional japanese food as well, so picky eaters aren&#39;t forced to go sushi or nothing."

The cuts of fish are decent.  And they don&#39;t give you a ton of rice which is good.  I went here for lunch.  I like the fact that you can get some appetizers like bulgogi.  I don&#39;t eat much bulgogi, but when I do, it tends to be at some kind of all you can eat place.  The ability to eat it while chowin down some sushi is an added bonus.  I also noticed that our appetizer (soup and beef) came out before the sushi, so if you are really hungry, it&#39;s a good way to tie you over.  

We got a bunch of sushi pieces and quite a few rolls.  It was 3 of us, but we made sure not to go overboard since, as others have mentioned, you have to pay for what you don&#39;t eat.  The trick with eating sushi is to not stop.  Once you take a break, you get superfull and you can&#39;t eat anymore lol.

The sushi was pretty tasty and I really can&#39;t complain.  For the price, it was a spectacular deal ($15 for lunch).  With tax and tip it was under $20.  We were also in and out in 30 minutes, during lunch hour.  

I&#39;m probably gonna check out the one in Lombard sometime."

We sat there for 15 minutes while the manager yelled at us. We told the manager it wasn&#39;t about the money and we  will pay however we are leaving hungry and he smiled and sent over our bill of 65 dollars.

Their buffet sushi is not bad at all. All freshly made each time you want it. On January 29, 2014 we decided to celebrate my sister&#39;s birthday in this restaurant. Everything was fine until we start ordering lots of sushi. Our kids (my 4 kids and my 6 nieces and nephews) are really heavy eater. The owner kind of like surprise.. WOW... this family looks petite but eat alot, then he start giving that look and comments that I think a little bit insulting. 

However, other than that everything else was OK. Also when you order buffet, make sure you finish it... nothing left on the plate... they will charge $1/sushi.

Hubby and I came for lunch. He got the all you can eat sushi and the server kept missing our order. We later ask if the rest of the sushi was coming out but they apparently ran out of salmon. How does an all you can eat sushi restaurant run out of salmon?? We then over hear a group of young ladies order some salmon and the sushi chef gladly serves it. 

When confronting the server, the server asks the younger sushi chef to find out and the chef starts yelling at her and then at us across the restaurant while shaking his head and cursing in korean. Don&#39;t lie to us and then behave like a child when you&#39;ve made the mistake."

Stopped in late on a Saturday and really enjoyed the meal here.  This was actually our second time and I remember the other time (non-AYCE) being good also.  The shrimp tempura roll here is great (the sweet sauce helps) and most of the rolls on the AYCE menu are your basic affair but done very well.  The service is great for an AYCE place - Sushi Para sometimes is really slow and/or doesn&#39;t bring some of the rolls you ask for (though this may be because I go in larger groups to Sushi para).  I&#39;ll definitely be back.


Positives:
-Good flavor, fresh fish
-VERY fast service for AYCE  (though we were one of 2-3 parties at that point)
-Staff continued to take our order even after turning down a group of new customers closer to close

Negatives:
-Nigirizushi slices were a bit thin (assumingly so the extra rice fills you up).  They were still delicious and we continued to order more after noticing.
-Not a ton of crazier roll options, but there are plenty to choose from and all the usual suspects.  Chicago crazy roll seemed like the only good house-roll option aside from the very good staples.

Negatives for late people (like myself), positives for a better work-place because when people (like me) do this they are jerks:  We showed up at about 9 (with an 11pm close) on Sunday night and were finally the last people in the restaurant by 10:20 or so.  The chefs were cleaning up but service was still quick, however a small party showed up and was turned away at the door.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with this - there&#39;s no way you can properly do AYCE sushi in 30 minutes... just be aware!  (they did say to turn off the &#34;open&#34; sign after this, which may have been faux-pas, but I&#39;d allow it with no negative connotations).

If you are having trouble finding the actual location just know it is on the very eastern side of the parking lot that Google puts it in."

On Friday nights, it&#39;s operated by what I like to call their 2nd runner up staff. The owners are not there, and it&#39;s basically a bunch of kids and then the ultra rude cooks running the show. I will never forget one time we went there, and we brought friends of ours from Minnesota here. I had raved about it to them and insisted we all go. 

They close at 10:30pm on Fri &amp; Sat, and we arrived at about 9. We were having a nice time, until 10pm rolled around. The short, stubby, tiny, middle aged mexican cook with the fat face came around and literally stood there with his arms crossed, and proceeded to stare at us while we ate a minimum of 20 minutes - he literally didn&#39;t move. He made it a point to make us uncomfortable and force us to leave just because he decided he wanted to go home early. The music was turned off, and the lights went from the nice dim ambience they normally have, to ultra bright nonsense. Next thing we know a few more staff are standing around looking at us. We found ourselves looking around and wondering what we had done wrong, it was absurd - and not to mention it was exactly 10pm when all of that bs started, we had a minimum of 30 minutes to go! No one should ever be rushed out of a restaurant. That Friday staff must really not give a damn about their tips or the restaurant!?  

Sakura is amazing though, the food is always great and you cannot beat the $20 all you can eat buffet, and they make it as you order it - very fresh. Under any other circumstance I would leave 5-stars easily, but until their entire Friday staff is fired, I will have a bad taste in my mouth from that fateful Friday. One bad thing that is always consistent regardless of the day or staff, is that they are not very attentive. There is usually 2-3 waiters max, taking care of all of the tables. It can get very busy. But even when it&#39;s not necessarily busy, I have found that the waiters can vanish for 15+ minutes at a time. That&#39;s a long wait when all you need is some sriracha or more water! :(

I will always come back here, but never again on a Friday. If you walk in and a fancy older Japanese (or Korean for all I know) man or lady greets you, you&#39;re in the clear - enjoy. If it&#39;s some teenager, make an excuse and run ..and try again another day :) Might sound rude, but I speaketh the truth!"

 All the maki rolls I got fell apart as I tried to eat them. The sushi looked like it was prepared in a hurry and was sloppily presented. It was not an appetizing sight. The sushi rice was hard and the sauces for some of the rolls were too salty.

I came with couple of friends for all you can eat. The food is okay, not impressive. The service is terrible!!! A waitress told us to wait a second when we came in. But a waiter suddenly take us to some table. So okay~ maybe the waiter steal the waitress customers. Fine, it is okay for us. 

After we order our drinks, it took a century for the waiter to bring it to us. Then sushi came, but the hot food that we order never came. We ask the waitress, she said he sometimes forget things. Then she help us to re-order and make the new sushi order that we made. Our drinks are empty already, and the waiter never came to check us and re-fill it.

Hot food came~ then a big plate of sushi came later. It has somethings that we didn&#39;t order. In the end, we couldn&#39;t finish all the food. The waitress brought us a check. Total should be $80, but it came out with $85. After I gave her my credit card, the waiter move so quickly toward the waitress, this is the fastest movement I saw from him all the time, and he is whispering with her. Then waitress came back saying that since we didn&#39;t finish the food, they had to charge us $1 per piece. What? If you have brought us hot food before we re-order again, we wouldn&#39;t re-order that much, and there&#39;s something we didn&#39;t order. We talked to the waitress, she told us nicely that try to finish it and she won&#39;t charge us anything extra. 

In the end, we didn&#39;t tips on the bill. We tip the waitress $20 cash instead. All I have to say is the waiter is extremely inexperience. If you took your co-worker&#39;s customer, that&#39;s fine, but please serve us well. Not doing nothing except charging us extra.
I will never come back to this restaurant again until the punk waiter or cook kids leave."

The restaurant isn&#39;t the cleanest place, and isn&#39;t the best looking either. Tiles are missing and the decor is very odd.

Avoid this place! The sushi is paper thin. Ya get more rice than fish on nigri rolls. It&#39;s as if the chef used a deli slicer. The rice is not hand formed either rather pressed into a cube shaped rectangle. 
Our server was nice but screwed up our order. Maguro (yellow fin tuna) should not be white. She ordered some other fish most likely the super white tuna which is a different fish. 

The rolls are also more rice than fish and lack the flavor you thought you are getting. 

For the AYCE you must finish all the food you ordered or you will be charged extra for the price of the entire roll. 

I had brought in a coupon for $10 off for my birthday which they would not honor. They told me they could give me a gift certificate for a future visit. THE COUPON IS WHAT BROUGHT ME IN! Even after the server told me before we ordered that it would be honored. BAIT &amp; SWITCH. When I complained, the manager was a rude @$$hole and wouldn&#39;t budge. I left cash on the table with no tip and he chased me out into the parking lot claiming I had short changed him.

sakura-of-tokyo-naperville-2,Ricky C.,w_aSpcXhoJkgSnsrakNGUg,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1,159,307,l2w6r_wnVcstY8AYn0gYHA,4.0,2013-02-22,"Sakura Sushi is a great little gem of a sushi place tucked away in a strip mill, hardly visible from Route 34. When you walk in, you notice that everything inside is somewhat low budget looking (I mean that in the least sushi-snob way possible). It makes for a great casual place to get your sushi fix, but it&#39;s not somewhere i&#39;d go for a first date or special occasion if you&#39;re self conscious about that kind of stuff.

The food however speaks well for the establishment though. The sushi is surprisingly fresh tasting, and is affordable with the AYCE. As others have mentioned, the sashimi bits on the sushi were on the thin side and heavy on the rice. it&#39;s been that way every time i&#39;ve been. The Rolls are all delicious, i&#39;ve yet to be disappointed any anything i&#39;ve ordered. 

Service is attentive, but often on the slow side.

I&#39;ve only gone for the AYCE, and i can safely say that the best time to go is during the dinner AYCE. even better if it&#39;s during the Happy Hour time block (20% off dinner between 3:30 and 5:30). The lunch AYCE is very basic stuff like spicy tuna and california rolls, barely worth the price, where as the dinner AYCE menu by comparison is full-featured with a lot of the premium rolls tossed in for a few bucks more than the lunch price. 

If you&#39;re looking for a quick, affordable, and most importantly FRESH sushi fix in Naperville, Sakura of Tokyo is your place. I only wish they didn&#39;t water down the green tea so much."

The rolls aren&#39;t huge or anything, but they are fresh and delicious (AND they have the right amount of rice...unlike other places that cover their rolls in an exorbitant amount to fill you up.  I&#39;m looking at you, Sushi City.)  The basic rolls that I tried- spicy tuna and spicy salmon were actually spicy(ish) so I didn&#39;t have to douse the rolls in wasabi to enjoy them.  They were a little mashed up, BUT they were good.  Not too squishy or tasteless.  My friends got some specialty rolls too which were really good...I&#39;ve found that this is really the way to go in the AYCE world.  They are bigger, saucier, have more fish in/on them, and fill you up more."

I spent a week in Manhattan working on it, all the while getting a crash course on the grand clusterfuck that is NYC. Don&#39;t think living in Chicago prepares one for the Apple, it don&#39;t. One of the things I learned is NYC has the best Chinese Restaurants I&#39;ve ever been to. Had stuff I ain&#39;t never had, and specifically, a Hot Shrimp Dish, made with a sweet-ish bright red sauce, with a good dose of red pepper in. Also in it were chopped white onions. Nothing more. Found on the menus there as &#34;Szechuan Shrimps&#34;.
Well. 
This became &#34;The Great Shrimp Dish In The Sky&#34;. I have been hunting this dish down for the past 30 years. &#34;Szechuan Shrimp&#34; must mean something totally different to Chinese folks here, &#39;cos I&#39;ve never seen it, never had it, never found it. I&#39;ve described it in detail. &#34;Oh Yes-order #25!&#34; (for example) I was told--nope. Wasn&#39;t it.
Today I took my Ma to the Doctor, and we went out for dinner afterwards. I asked what she wanted, and she said &#34;Chinese&#34;. Out here in the wild Hinterlands, near Stately Breakwind Manor, there are Chinese take-aways of varying quality. (None of which have anything close to the &#34;Great Shrimp Dish In The Sky&#34;). There is a shithole $5.95 Chinese Buffet in the hood (reviewed here by me--go look for it), but while I&#39;ll scoot my fat ass in there for a feed, I ain&#39;t taking my Mama there. Where to go? Then I remembered a nice-looking sit-down Chinois on Montgomery Road: &#34;East China Inn&#34;. Never been there, but it looked safe. So there we went.
The menu was hefty, full of color shots of many of their dishes. Imagine my shock, when I saw the pic of something that looked suspiciously like my forlorn Shrimp dish. (On the menu as &#34;Sizzling Peking Shrimp&#34;). The dish pictured had not the preternatural hue of the legend, so my tail did not yet wag.
A well-made Zombie, an Egg Roll and a coupla Pot Stickers (also well-made) later, and then the main courses arrived (My Ma had Egg Foo Young). 
I could hardly believe my eyes. There, before me was...THE GREAT SHRIMP DISH IN THE SKY. Glowing redder than a Brookfield Zoo Monkey&#39;s ass. White Onions. Flecks o&#39; the spicy stuff. That&#39;s it.
In other words...culinary bliss incarnate. (for me, at least)
And good, too! Just as I remember it!
And pissed off I have been driving past this joint for 16 years, thinking it was just another Chop Suey hole.
I asked the Waiter what the dish was called in Chinese, he said &#34;Peking Style Shrimp&#34;. Ironic, no?
Others may not have their bippy bitten by &#34;Peking shrimps&#34;. I care not. This may be a plebian sham thrown together just for the round-eyes. Again, both shits and fucks remain in the holster, not to be given. I like &#34;Peking shrimps&#34;.  For the record, Mom&#39;s &#34;Egg Foo Young&#34; (Chicken) was really fine, too!
Throwing 4 for this one... I dug it!"

The first time I dined in and food was just &#34;okay&#34; I tried delivery the next time and it took over an hour on a Tuesday so ridiculous and food was cold! For whatever reason I decided to try delivery again tonight even though I know there&#39;s a ton of better Chinese places to choose from but I wanted to still see if they would be better. I ordered on grub hub (I&#39;m a chef and I&#39;m familiar with grub hub and how to set it up with menu items and pricing, the restaurant sets it up for sure no surprises) anyway after ordering online I get a call from them and he asks me &#34;what&#39;s a side of vegetables&#34; (there was a section of sides and a side order of veggies was one of the things I ordered) I&#39;m like, a side of sautéed veggies? He&#39;s like oh well we charge $5 for that (it&#39;s priced at $2 on their grubhub) I&#39;m like okay well do what you gotta do it says $2 on your grubhub so that&#39;s what I expect. He&#39;s like ok for you I do it. I&#39;m like great. So an hour later the delivery guy shows up and harassed my boyfriend for a tip, he said we put it in the card and asked the guy where his print out receipt was, he pulled it out and yep there it is, we pointed it out to him, and he wanted to fight with us about how we didn&#39;t tip then I pull it up in my phone and say yeah we tipped FOR SURE then he said no no that&#39;s for the car that&#39;s for the car, and the company and at that point my boyfriend was just frustrated and was like omg ok well give you a couple bucks more (just to get the damn guy to leave even though we were right! And we did tip!) but then the guy just ran away. Weirdest thing ever. We wanted to be like so wait the restaurant provides you with a car? Lol like really dude your trying to scam us out if a couple bucks when you know we have you a good tip already. Bogus and IM NEVER ORDERING HERE AGAIN. Added bonus, our food was cold. And my &#34;$5&#34; side order of veggies was clearly someone trying to give me $2 dollars worth. What a joke. For as many options we have around here, literally anywhere would be better than this place. 
Nothing was good, crab Rangoon was all cream cheese
Veggies were over steamed and mush
Beef fried rice was soggy and bland threw most away because we felt sick just gross.  You&#39;ve been warned. Don&#39;t order from this place"

This is for my takeout order which includes the general tso&#39;s chicken which tasted like an old thawed chicken that we had to throw away after the first bite, even the sweet-sour sauce can&#39;t mask the taste. So I told the guy Manager/Owner (I think) when I came back the next time about the rotten food they served me and the guy answered me with a raised voice that I should&#39;ve told them earlier. I was fuming with anger but I didn&#39;t want to make a scene so I told them to check their food&#39;s quality/preparation first and I headed out the door. To the Manager: are you being serious, you already messed up my food and I had to get this type of response from you? Guy was so disrespectful. Only thing they got my 1 star is that they have a good order system and a customer friendly website. Oh did I mention the mango smoothie they served me is made from a bottled mango mixer with ice.

My favorite dish from here is the moo shu pork, a suggestion- ask for extra pancakes and extra sauce. They give you such a large portion but not enough pancakes for it and definitely not enough sauce to put on. I have also had their orange and general tsao&#39;s chicken. Each were good but not amazing. The one thing I&#39;ve had that really wasn&#39;t good was their chicken lo mein. It was basically noodles with huge (inedible without cutting) pieces of chicken.

I always love their food. 

Only reason I am giving it 3.5-4 stars instead of 5 is because of these following things...

1. 2.00 extra for subbing a vegetable? Really?? Okay so I dont like mushrooms, and prefer carrots... you do not discount the food for deleting the mushrooms, so why charge me extra for adding carrots. I Didnt ask for a lot? 

2. The staff seems rushed whenever I call 

3. The 2.00 extra charge adds incorrectly online... it adds 4.00 onto the subtotal! I have pointed this out, and they do not care, so I call now to place an order. 

4. One delivery guy basically kicks my dog when he delivers the food, because my dog goes outside to smell him. He is a nice dog and not aggressive. But the guy is rude.

HUGE menu = check. 
Reasonable prices = check. 
Quality food = check. 
FAST delivery = check. 

This place has it all. It&#39;s not a Chinese Kitchen though - there&#39;s just a certain taste that CK has in Naperville that can not be beaten. 

We have relied on this place often for our egg roll and east china fried rice cravings. Their chop suey - all kinds - is actually pretty good.

The delivery service is very fast - I have never waited more than 30 minutes for my food. They are not right down the street for me either - just about 5 miles away. 

The only problem here - like most Chinese food places - the person that takes your order is generally rude (does not say thank you, hello, answers the phone with a stern &#39;what do you want&#39;, etc.) I don&#39;t care too much about the quality of the service over the phone - the food makes up for it. 

If you&#39;re looking for a nice person to order your food from and have some sort of &#39;luxury&#39; personality - take a step back and look at yourself... you&#39;re ordering take out Chinese food. Food that most people crave when they&#39;re hung-over, or having a lazy Sunday. This is not Mortons, Shaw&#39;s, Hugo&#39;s etc. I only make that comment for the tools that live in Oakhurst and feel that the world revolves around them - generally the people that have their head so far up their ass that they don&#39;t know what mediocre means and that it&#39;s ok that something is not served with a doily. 

Wow, talk about way off track. 

East China Inn - good food, fast delivery, online ordering, good prices. You can&#39;t find anything better in this area - it&#39;s a great place."

We don&#39;t visit for dinner very often, but go monthly, sometimes more often for lunch.  I think they give generous servings at lunch as we almost always have leftovers to take home.
The eggrolls are really good and we prefer their chicken noodle soup over the regular egg drop, wonton and hot/sour."

We lived minutes from this restaurant for 4 years before trying it...I was a little scared of its quality being that it is in a dirty little strip mall...where buying our beer from the neighboring liquor store was ok, but eating from...not so sure.  

The first time we tried it (on a Saturday for lunch), it was very busy.  Many of the customer&#39;s appeared to be local White Eagle Napervillians...groups of ladies, whole families with grandma-gramps-mom-dad-and kids, etc...

The lunch specials were reasonably priced, plentiful, and good.  I hate when I got to a Chinese restaurant where the egg roles suck, but theirs were good.  I like spicy dishes and got the schezwan shrimp, it was also good.  My husband likes pork fried rice and ONLY pork fried rice.  He said it wasn&#39;t as good as his hometown &#34;rice house&#34; but it is sufficient and better than anything he has ever had since living in the Chicagoland area.     

We frequent the East China Inn for take out regularly and it is reliable.  When I don&#39;t get the schezwan shrimp, I get the shrimp fried rice and like it very much.  For an extra buck, I get the large and I am able to eat it for like 2-3 meals...usually what I need when I am hungover...

As far as the blandness of the fried rice...I don&#39;t feel particularly strong about it...my husband likes dark fried rice (I can only assume that he likes it with alot of soy sauce); however, I like how East China Inn serves it and I usually put only a little soy sauce on it, if any.  Obviously, blandness is a matter of preference that can be solved with packets of soy sauce."

My wife had cashew chicken, and it was fairly flavorless.  She did say the veggie egg rolls were good.   The chicken fried rice was flavorless also.

What&#39;s good
- hot dog !!! Their hotdog is pretty awesome !!! 
- burger!!! Big and juicy ! Delicious !!!
- fries !! Crinkle cut fries,crispy outside and soft inside ! 
- salad!! I know I didn&#39;t expect they would have &#34;good&#34; salad but they do !! It&#39;s delicious !!! 
Try the poppyseed or Apple walnut !! 

What&#39;s meh
- Italian beef , it&#39;s my personal opinion, the meat can get dry if you don&#39;t get the extra gravy and the bun always seem kinda greasy/soggy. 
- pasta, this isn&#39;t Olive Garden or your local Italian ristorante. Plain mediocre pasta it&#39;s what you&#39;d get here.
- chocolate cake, it&#39;s not great, from my experience it&#39;s just a regular spongy dry chocolate cake and the icing is on the sweet side. 
- shakes, it&#39;s just not great, I&#39;d rather get shakes from Chick fil A lol

Grilled Chicken, Bacon, Pasta, Tomato, Gorgonzola, Scallion, Lettuce, and Cabbage fill the bowl.  The house dressing is a vinaigrette.   The salad comes tossed in the salad and all mixed together.  It comes with a wedge of fresh baked bread.  

Other popular items on this trip from people in my group were the Burgers, Dipped Italian Beef, Onion Rings, and Chicago Style Dogs.

One of these days I might try the Barnelli&#39;s side of the store since the location I usually goes to has one also, but until then I&#39;ll keep on visiting the Portillo&#39;s side and get the Italian beef, hot, and dipped.

I love this location and always try to go here with my girlfriend. Great parking, great seating, great decorations and great food. You will have to experience it all for yourself. 

I always get the Italian Beef with sweet peppers and it is to die for. Nobody comes close to beef sandwiches than portillos. I did not think I could find anything better until I tried their Beef-n-cheddar croissant and let me tell you if you have not had one of these yet, you are missing out! Their fries are perfect. Always freshly made and always great with BBQ sauce. 

And then there&#39;s the cake shakes. A small sized one is enough for two people. I have only had the chocolate cake shake and it is beyond amazing -- there is actual cake in the shake! I have also recently tried their pumpkin pie (or pumpkin spice) shake which is fantastic. 

I cannot comment on Barnelli&#39;s salad since veggies scare me and im a meat-o-saurus. At any rate, you absolutely NEED to go to Portillos if you haven&#39;t been! You will not regret it!"

But when a friend planned a trip to Chicago, you could bet your ass that Portillo&#39;s would definitely make the list of places to dine at. One of our friends had actually never been to Chicago so what better way to properly introduce her to the windy city than with Portillo&#39;s. I&#39;ve actually never been to this particular location, but it&#39;s one of the best locations I&#39;ve dined at -- very large, spacious and clean. I always tell myself I&#39;m gonna try something new when I come, but I always fall back on my tried and true favorites. 

If you haven&#39;t been to this Chicagoland flavor mecca, large cheese fries are a must when one visits - no if ands or buts. The crinkle cut fries have a crispy exterior and soft fluffy interior. The Chicago dog and Italian beef (always get it dipped, duh) never disappoint. Also, I didn&#39;t know the Italian beef and sausage combo was an actual menu item until my friend ordered it; definitely trying this next time! However, if cheese fries, hot dogs and delicious Italian beefs aren&#39;t your thang, then you&#39;re weird and we can&#39;t be friends...haha. But in all seriousness, if you&#39;re not into that, Portillo&#39;s also makes excellent bacon cheeseburgers and chicken croissant sandwiches or dig into a delicious chopped salad from Barnelli&#39;s Salad Bowl. Make sure to save room in your tummies for dessert too because Portillo&#39;s has one of MOISTEST chocolate cakes I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s the mayo that makes the magic! If you&#39;d rather drink your dessert, go with the chocolate cake shake; it&#39;s rich, thick and oh so chocolatey. Oh, word of warning: if you don&#39;t drink it all in one sitting, make sure you refrigerate it. I left it out overnight and finished the rest in the morning only to hear my friends tell me I was gonna die of food poisoning lol."

No matter where I am, or what time it is, the drive-thrus are packed. From what I have observed, the business does an excellent job processing orders, so it&#39;s not slowness on their part. When lines start winding around the building or pouring out into the street, they walk up to vehicles to take orders. In this review, I will share why I think Portillo&#39;s is such a catch. 

What most impresses me is the hamburger. The hamburger is a substantial piece of meat that is clearly seasoned. I thoroughly enjoy the meaty, smoky taste. The bun is also worth talking about. It is big, doughy, and fresh. When you order a regular hamburger, they also load it up with condiments (everything but cheese, unless you request it). That&#39;s convenient, especially if you are on the go. There are a number of sides you may order separately. I&#39;m a very conventional gal, so I get the French fries. The small order is definitely sufficient. I&#39;m not sure if the fries were seasoned, but actually that is a positive. It&#39;s easier to add salt than remove it. The French fries have the right amount of crispiness and are not soggy. 

My one problem with this location has nothing to do with Portillo&#39;s. The parking lot is tight. The lanes are small and parking can be hard to come by. Portillo&#39;s shares a lot with other big name outfits here: Staples, Chipotle, Jamba Juice, etc. It&#39;s also in a prime location on Route 83. You are competing with a lot of people for parking, or a space in the drive-thru. However, if you can make it through the vehicular madness, you are in for a treat at Portillo&#39;s."

I&#39;m back home for a visit and of course I needed my Portillos fix. Well after two visits, I still need my fix. First try- Saturday 7/23/16 I ordered two chardogs and a large fry. After 25 minutes of waiting I inquired if I had missed my meal. &#34;No, char dogs take about 10 minutes.&#34; I bit my tongue and decided not to point out that meant my meal could&#39;ve been prepared twice by now and I didn&#39;t even say anything when I got my meal 35 minutes after I ordered it and had seen about 6 char dogs  made and served to orders that were placed after mine. Ok so I could&#39;ve gotten over my hangriness but then I tried the food. It was like eating a hot dog flavored tampon:a thick, tough, cardboard like applicator of &#34;char&#34; and a shrunken bit of hot dog in the middle. I&#39;m not saying this for shock value but it&#39;s the only thing I can compare it to. I could barely bite through it. So I figured this was an off night and I needed to give them another shot for my sake (I REALLY LOVED PORTILLOS, keyword is loved.) Went back the next night (sun 7/24/16) with my family. We ordered three burgers, mine was a bacon cheeseburger and a few orders of fries that we requested be cooked well done. We waited longer than normal due to the well done fries which we were fine with. Unlike the previous night, the wait only took about 10 minutes but they didn&#39;t give us well done friends. The bacon on my cheeseburger wasn&#39;t really cooked, like more than half of each strip was still &#34;raw&#34; and none of it was crispy. On top of all of this, during the first visit I watched a woman return her order because they had messed it up. The girl at the counter had to get a manager to fix it (I&#39;m not sure why she couldn&#39;t do it ) I watched him stand there listening to the lady explain what was wrong and he never really saying anything back. Then he took the messed up items before coming back 5 minutes later setting a bag down in front of her. He never apologized for the inconvenience or said thank you for coming to Portillos. He literally just set the bag down and walked away. Unfortunately, and it breaks my heart to say it but I will not be going back to Portillos again."

When I told him the order he said he couldn&#39;t take that order that the drive thru restricted what can be ordered and that I would have to go inside. Now I am trapped in a line and the line was not moving so I called the restaurant and the gave me a manager. The manager stated that the drive thur is only for specific items. I explained why can&#39;t they take the order while I am waiting in the drive thur lane and I will go inside. He stated again the the drive thru is on for specific items, I asked where does it say that! If I knew that was posted policy I would not of gotten in line, nor would of been now stuck. He said he would make a one time exception and take my order and bring it out to my car. I said never mind, they unblocked the line for me to exit and I went to the &#34;Patio&#34; restaurant across the street for my ribs. I will never go back to Portillo&#39;s again.

Obviously, this is a very popular place; perhaps it&#39;s because of the wacky decor and ambience more than for the food, but the place seems busy all the time, and other reviewers loved it... but perhaps they just hadn&#39;t had an opportunity to try better.

I had an Italian sausage sandwich with mozzarella, thinking it would come with marinara sauce, as my Italian sausage sandwiches usually come, but no.  So perhaps it was my fault for not being specific enough, but the sausage was fine--nothing to do backflips over, but tasty enough--the bread didn&#39;t seem very fresh and they didn&#39;t put enough cheese on to suit my tastes.  Again, I blame myself, because I tried a friend&#39;s sandwich (the same as mine, but with hot peppers) and enjoyed it very much.  I can&#39;t stand bell peppers on sandwiches (or anywhere else) and automatically declined all peppers, even though the clerk asked if I wanted hot peppers (I was going on 3 hours of sleep for the past 3 nights, so maybe my idiocy can be excused). 

I&#39;m guessing that many of their ingredients come from grocery shelves.

My wife had lasagna.  Offered the choice between marinara and meat sauce, we chose marinara because, after all, lasagna has plenty of meat inside already... doesn&#39;t it?  Not at Barnelli&#39;s.  About the only ingredient we detected between the pasta layers was ricotta cheese, nothing more: no meat, no other cheeses, no natural herbs or seasonings, just gobs and gobs of tasteless, banal, boring old ricotta.  I guess if you want meat you have to get meat sauce.  It&#39;s a pity we were never told that.  As for mozarella, there was only a little of that, and only on top.  At least they topped it with freshly grated parmesan.  I have made lasagna a total of two times in my life (both recently), and mine is worlds better than Barnelli&#39;s.

As an Angeleno, maybe my tastes are radically different from Chicagoans, because they love this place, and I KNOW at least one Italian immigrant settled in Chicago, some years ago, and there are few Italian immigrants in Los Angeles, so maybe what we call Italian food is very different from what true Italians eat.  If this is the case, I&#39;m glad we don&#39;t live in Italy.  When we go out for Italian here in LA, it&#39;s almost always Compari&#39;s in Westchester, where we usually buy the most delicious lasagna and Italian sausage sandwiches we&#39;ve ever had.  We Californians DO tend to tweak the ideas of others, but just look what we did for the hamburger!  So maybe West Coasters improved on the old time honored recipes by adding actual meat, mozzarella, marinara sauce, perhaps some roasted tomato slices between the pasta layers instead of just on top and reduced the amount of ricotta used to something reasonable instead of total interior dominion.

But I hope Chicagoans don&#39;t think I&#39;m an LA-loving kind of guy who disdains their city; quite the contrary.  This was our first visit to Chicago and we both agreed that it looks like a MUCH better place to live than LA.  Then again, we did turn down the scenic tour of South Chicago, which may have tainted our view.  (Or maybe not; LA has MANY bad neighborhoods, some of which my wife and I have resided in and survived.)

On a positive note, we did enjoy the wacky interior, even if the excessively loud, festive music made conversation a yelling match.

If you love good lasagna, go someplace else.  We certainly will."

Go great with a side of cheese too!  I would also recommend the Italian beef which is probably the best i have had next to Al&#39;s beef on Taylor street in Chicago.  Just make sure to ask for extra gravy for the beef because they naturally serve it a little drier than other places if you don&#39;t say anything.  If you want something sweet you can not go wrong with their popular cake shake which has grounded up pieces of chocolate cake in the shake itself.

I get a regular beef and the last 3 times they did not have as much beef as they usually do. It was mostly soggy bread, not that I don&#39;t enjoy a &#34;dipped&#34; beef but I gotta have some protein here!

Like all Portillo&#39;s, the food here is awesome like The Miz. Can&#39;t go wrong with a cheeseburger, or Chicago style dog. Please drag it through the garden and hold the ketchup (look it up). 

The Italian beef sandwiches are my favorite in the city. I know, most Chi-fans have their fave, but this is mine. They&#39;re spread out far and wide enough so you can pretty much grab a bite wherever you are when you&#39;re craving the classics. 

The shakes are yum yum doodle dum too. It&#39;s like you&#39;re sucking down straight ice cream, and really, when you go to Portillo&#39;s it&#39;s not like you&#39;re trying to eat healthy. I&#39;m sure my meal topped out at about a million and one calories. But I worked out for an hour yesterday so that must have balanced, right? Sure...

Great speedy service in the drive-thru. Efficient. Everything is served hot and cooked fresh. I like that in fast food. 

One kudo slash complaint. They still haven&#39;t quite figured out how to handle their dual-lane drive-thru. I&#39;ve seen other Portillo&#39;s figure it out, but this one just can&#39;t seem to get it down. There&#39;s always a cluster going on because they cone off one lane and try to get people to merge. I think there was a lack of spacial planning when they designed the restaurant site. I know they rearranged the drive-thru flow from when they first opened because then cars were actually almost colliding with one another because the lanes were so narrow. They spread it out and looped it wider now. You kind of go farther out and around to get in at less of an angle. So the kudo is to them trying to fix the problem. That&#39;s awesome. But it&#39;s still not quite perfect. So boo to that.

No other problems. Awesome food. Great service. Keep it in the Chi."

My Chicago-born friend has been telling me about Portillo&#39;s for months now and I was ecstatic about trying it out.

I&#39;ve had polish sausage before but never &#34;Chicago style&#34; and most certainly not with a pickle and tomato on it. It&#39;s just unheard of where I&#39;m from. It was delicious! It definitely had a kick to it with that pepper on top. I&#39;m craving one as I write this!

The tiramisu was also splendid and it went  well with the large miller lite the boys all had to have but I was a bit disappointed that they only had two kinds of beers. Where&#39;s the Heineken? Guinness? PBL? Sad day.

I also loved the decor here. It was nice to be able to stare at 16 pictures of Jim Belushi and a naked man in a bathtub whilst devouring a large sausage. Made me feel dirty. 

The driveway scared the heck out of me at first. It&#39;s reminiscent of traffic on 294 but I was surprised at how fast and simple it was. The people taking orders were standing outside in the pouring rain wearing ponchos. That&#39;s the spirit, guys!

Instead of motioning for me to pull up they just kept taking peoples orders around me. I finally got someones attention and ordered my grilled chicken. After waiting about 15 minutes i got my sandwich and drove home.

It goes without saying that Portillo&#39;s is...was the standard of Chicago style beef and hotdogs.  Now they could care less if they mess up your order. After several emails to customer care starting in April this is response I received 6/10/15.  I get it. It&#39;s just a hotdog right?  It became more than that when they kept ignoring my emails for two months.  This is the NEW Portillo&#39;s people. If they mess up your order, too bad. Even McDonalds would replace an item of food if it was prepared incorrectly. By the way Celery Salt is a key ingredient in a &#34;Chicago Style&#34; hotdog. The CSR who wrote the email below doesn&#39;t get it.  I don&#39;t know who the person is since none of their emails are signed.  

&#34;Dear Alex,

We received your emails and forwarded your initial email to the Area Supervisor and General Manager of the location so they may follow up with their staff. We have compensation guidelines and typically we do not compensate for portion issues. Please know that you email was not a joke to us and we never ignored your email and stated we forwarded it to the correct people.  We are sorry to hear that the amount of mustard and celery salt you received on your hotdog was not to your liking however this is not something we compensate for. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to improve our service and we look forward to any feedback you have once you have visited us again.&#34;"

We stopped by for a quick dinner and were not disappointed. The service is fast and the prices are pretty reasonable. There&#39;s ample seating, so if you&#39;re going with a big group, accommodations should be easy enough.

The hot dog is delicious, with the perfect balance of toppings. The hot peppers are surprisingly hot, so beware if you have a sensitive stomach. Their burger is pretty good - not the best I&#39;ve had, but satisfying considering the price. I might skip it in favor of the hot dog. The Italian beef sandwich is great. The beef is extremely tender, moist, and flavorful. My only issue is that the bun becomes really soggy, which I don&#39;t really like it. The halibut filet sandwich is good if you like fish. The fries and onion rings are good, too.

Overall, really good and definitely worth a try."

1. Pesto Chicken tasted a little odd 
2. They wouldn&#39;t exchange it for a garden salad (which is much cheaper an I wasn&#39;t asking for the credit)
3. The assistant general manager Tiffani said they NEEDED a receipt in order for corporate to approve an exchange/refund
4. She had me SEARCH THROUGH THE TRASH for a receipt!
5. The busser James was gracious enough to give us gloves, after ten minutes of searching Tiffani decides to help us
6. When refunding it back she made it seem like &#34;she took care of us tonight&#34;
7. She preceded to argue with us when I explained how I was shocked that she made me search through the trash
8. None of the girls at the register wanted to give us a general manager name or info to contact corporate.

Today, I ordered my usual cheeseburger and large cheese fry and, as usual, it was fantastic.  Other than that I&#39;ve also tried the chicken, pasta, and deserts which are all above average in their own right.  This is technically a fast food place after all but you won&#39;t be able to tell from the quality.  The only complaint I would have is that once in a while I will get my burger and the bottom of the bun is a bit soggy from the grease.  It might not be a big deal to everyone, but it bothers me a bit.  Also, they grill their burgers which is great but sometimes that leads to the edges being charred which kind of ruins the taste of the rest of the burger.

My friend Emma and I were driving up to the parking lot of the famous Portillo&#39;s hotdogs.  If I didn&#39;t know any better I would assume we were at the mall on Black Friday because of how crowded the parking lot was.  As we stepped out of the car I could smell french fries and italian beef in the air.  Excitedly we made it in the door, only to be met by a 50 person line to order food.  While waiting a manager came around and talked to the people in line to make sure their wait wasn&#39;t too bad.  I believe a wait could never be bad inside of Portillos.  This is because of the immense scenery they have just above your head.   There is so much to look at because every inch of the ceiling and top floor is covered with posters to license plates.  They even have figures of people during the 50s enjoying Portillos!  When we finally got to the front of the line I knew what I wanted.  A hamburger with ketchup, a small fry, and an onion ring.  Emma on the other hand ordered a jumbo hotdog, and a fry.  The cashier was very friendly.  He smiled at us and told us to have a great day.  We would have had a great day if it wasn&#39;t for the traumas ahead of us.
After waiting around 25 minutes to get our food, we finally sat down and began to eat.  As Emma bit into her hotdog I heard a gigantic pop.  Juices from the hotdog shot everywhere.  At this point I was almost too sick to open my hamburger. but I knew I had to eat.  When I opened the container of my hamburger I noticed probably half of my ketchup had not landed on the burger at all.  It was smeared all around the bun and on the sides of the container.  However, when I did eat the hamburger it was delicious.  It tasted exactly like the burgers I have had in restaurants around the world that are known for burgers.  I was and still am very impressed by the burger.  The french fries were also outstanding, they were fried to perfection.  Perfectly crispy and crunchy.  None of them were soggy, or had any funky taste.  The onion rings were also artfully crafted.  When I bit into them, the whole onion did not come out of the fried shell.  This is when you know that they are properly made.  I learned this from the vast number of Food Network shows that I have watched.  As I was enjoying an excellent meal, Emma was not having the same experience as I was.  She told me that the fries she was eating were great, but the hotdog was horrid.  It had a funky flavor that she could not distinguish.  She told me that the flavor of the hotdog could be best described as musty.  As we finished our meal we got up from the table and brought our trays to the garbage can.  I remember looking back at our table and seeing an employee immediately wiping off the table for the next customer.  &#34;What a great staff&#34; I said, &#34;they are definitely on top of their game&#34;.  As we got into the car, leaving the 50s designed Portillos, Emma was already showing signs that the hotdog was not sitting well with her.  She spent the rest of the car ride hunched over trying to make the sick feelings diminish.  After I dropped her off, I received a text from her saying she had puked.  This shocked me because my experience at Portillos had been so amazing, but hers had ended with a bad note.  
Portillos hotdogs in no way is a bad restaurant.  While I dined there I was met with excellent
service, a staff who genuinely cared about its customers, and in my opinion, refreshingly tasty fast-food.  Even though Emma did not have the same experience, I think Portillos is the best option if you want a quick and delicious burger.  I have heard their Italian beef is world-class as well.  Emma has been there many times that she is sure it was just one mess up that will not happen again.  Portillos is a great establishment and deserves much praise for their excellent food."

We rented the back room out for our rehearsal dinner. It was a Friday night and the restaurant and drive thru were packed. I was worried walking in that there would be people in the back room since seating outside was limited, but sure enough the room was roped off and waiting for us. Our appetizers were already set up and so were the non-alcoholic drinks. The waitress had to check IDs in order to get a wristband for alcoholic drinks and that would be the only quibble I had with the whole night. The bar line was shared with the crowded restaurant and it did take quite a while when you wanted to get a drink. It also was only 1 drink per wristband, so you couldn&#39;t plan ahead and stock up. Otherwise, the evening was wonderful. It was quiet enough for us to make a speech and the space was set up for 30 people spread out over 3 tables. They served the food as soon as we gave word and there was plenty! We also got to take home all the leftovers. They let our vegetarians order off the regular menu and the food came timely with the serving of buffet. Prior to the event, the staff was very helpful to work with. The buffet options are very straight forward and easy to pick from. The buffet was consistently kept stocked and we didn&#39;t run out of anything.

My fiancé and I are relatively new to the Midwest and everyone loves this place, as did we the first few times we tried it. 

This weekend we had friends visiting from CA and wanted to take them to lunch, we built this place up to be so great. But little did we know this trip would be so bad. 


First we got this about 5 after 4. I have always just gotten sandwiches from the Portillos side, but this time I wanted to try the Barnellis food. They have a 1/2 sand 1/2 soup or salad combo that would have been perfect, but it ends at 4. I went up to the cashier and asked if there was anyway I could still do it, I even mentioned that I would pay extra for it and asked to her double check with the manager who simply looked at her watch and said NO. Did not look at me or anything. 

Now I have worked in a restaurant and I understand that there are rules you follow, so its not a huge deal I was unable to do the special, my problem was that the manager although right in front of me did not even have the decency to give me eye contact or speak to me. 

Second, my friend also ordered from the Barnellis side and ordered Pesto. She had just a few bites and asked her bf to try it- they both decided that it tasted awful. My friend went up to the cash register and told the cashier what had happened as well as the manager who told my friend that she needed her receipt. Unfortunately, she threw her receipt away and the manager instructed her TO LOOK THROUGH THE TRASH FOR IT! At that point I was livid, who makes their customers look through the trash?!?! All she wanted was a simple exchange, she didn&#39;t care about the price difference (that was in her favor) all she wanted was food that was not old. 

While my fiancé, friend and her BF were looking through the trash I asked an employee for a business card for the General Manager, she instructed me that they were up front so I went to the cashier. Who had no idea where one was and who also refused to give me the name of the General Manager at all. The manager that we did deal with was the Assistant General Manager Tiffani. 


I can not believe that this place is always so busy with customer service like this! The bussers and people out on the floor were way more personable and pleasant than anyone at the cashier or the manager."

I was somewhat perturbed by some other patrons: I left my phone at the booth for about two minutes to go claim my food while retaining our booth. One member went to turn in my phone to the front desk while another member of their group took our booth! It was fine though, as there was other seating available. 

The Italian beef was actually not impressive. It was much smaller than I expected. I paid $5 for it and it was under 6&#34; long. The beef wasn&#39;t that great of quality and the bun wasn&#39;t that great. It was still delicious: its basically just soggy bread, fatty beef, and salt. This will be delicious regardless. For $5, I would have preferred to just get a subway footlong. Still, I like trying new things and I couldn&#39;t stay in Chicago without trying the Italian beef. Maybe it was just an off night.

However, the highlight of the night was the Chocolate Cake Milkshake, which is fun to say and delicious. They literally have a piece of cake in the shake: towards the very end of the shake, I found an unblended bit at the bottom of the shake (what a pleasant surprise!). Somehow, the fragments didn&#39;t get stuck in the straw. It also wasn&#39;t that heavy and was delightful. I cannot recommend this shake enough. 

Overall, I wasn&#39;t that impressed with Portillos. I was starving when I came, but I still found the Italian beef lacking. Definitely try the Chocolate Cake Milkshake, but I can&#39;t recommend the beef."

There are many smaller places around the chicago land area that offer you a more authentic beef sandwich experience.  My main problem is their price, they offer no meal deals and even the size of their serving is small.  

Mainly, people go this place because of the ambiance they offer, it&#39;s a complete spectacle and takes your attention away from the cheap quality food.  The decor of this place is random signs and paintings from the 1950&#39;s.  The place is run by stoned 16 year old kids and random illegal immigrants.  I feel pitty for the immigrant they crossed the desert&#39;s of the American southwest, hitchhiked across the grass of the great plains to land in Chicago where they end up serving overrpriced greasy beef sandwiches to fatass Chicagoan&#39;s.

If you live in anywhere you&#39;ve eaten here and you know whats up.
Awesome hot dogs, polish, combos, ETC.
Cheese fries, YUM.

Personally lately I&#39;ve been more of a salad eater and I gotta say Barnellis definitely delivers as well in that department.
Other greatnesses:
Chocolate cake (OMFG)
Drive through speed
They serve beer!

It zipped by as I started asking- and as you&#39;ll see by the picture- they must have left it in the oven an extra 20 minutes. Crust was burned! Once we saw other pizzas next to us- it was apparent that only ours was burned. 

Told the server/busser- and she said, &#34;oh you should have told us right away&#34;.

Whatever... We waited longer than anyone else and were starving by the time it arrived.

After spending a good 3 hours wrapped up in my work down the street at a coffee shop, I realized I had neglected to eat lunch (#fail). I needed to head back to my neck of the woods before I hit rush hour traffic, but knew I couldn&#39;t wait until I got home to eat. Low and behold, I spot Bricks Wood Fired Pizza! Well, to be honest it was their awning that read &#34;sandwiches, soups, and pizza&#34; that caught my eye.

While I could easily down an entire pizza myself, I opted for a less aggressive option - something I could easily eat in the car as well. Their sandwich list is extensive, so it was hard to choose. I&#39;m a sucker for goat cheese though, so the portabello mushroom and roasted red pepper sandwich was a winner for me.

Balsamic marinated portobello mushrooms, sweet basil pesto, roasted red peppers, mozzarella and goat cheese make up this beauty between bread. I didn&#39;t realize they offer wheat bread otherwise I would have gotten that, but the artisan French bread was delicious despite being less healthy. At $7 a sandwich it also includes a bag of kettle chips which was a sweet deal. I added a bottle of water to my order and was good to go!

Service was friendly and I was told it would take 10 minutes to prepare my order, but it only took like 5 which was great. This sandwich was not your ordinary veggie concoction. It was packed with mushrooms and peppers and the pesto for sure added to this yummy combo. The cheese was the real all-star though, and it was definitely plentiful! For all you veggie (and cheese) lovers out there, I highly suggest this terrific toasted sammie.

There&#39;s no doubt I&#39;ll be back to Bricks&#39; -- so many other menu items to try! Especially the pizza of course...

Pro tips: They cater. They have a sweet Yelp check-in offer that&#39;ll getcha a free dessert!"

I usually do a few modifications and they are very accommodating. Haven&#39;t gotten an order wrong, not even once. I love that! The bread they use for the sandwiches is to die for. A baguette with a great texture of crunch on the outside and soft and smooth on the inside. And the bread is warm. Yum! 
I am not a huge fan of the pizzas though. I get it, it&#39;s gourmet pizza. But personally, I&#39;m a sauce lover. I have been satisfied with a pizza from Bricks...  after I ate the whole thing by myself. Anticipate getting a salad or an appetizer to split if you plan on sharing the pizza between yourself and other people. They&#39;re made for 2-3 people, but it&#39;s not very filling. They are pretty good though. Fresh ingredients. But the price of the pizza for the size shocks me and so I end up getting a sandwich instead."

But I have to talk about the Sunnyside.  This pizza is so delicious.  No tomato sauce as the base of the pizza. It&#39;s layered with cheese, topped with  bacon bits, green onion and the PERFECTLY COOKED SUNNYSIDE UP EGG IN THE CENTER.  Imagine picking up a slice and the yolk breaks and you are just forced to dip the crust of the pizza in it just because.  It&#39;s a beautiful thing!  It&#39;s breakfast for dinner in pizza form.

I&#39;ve only had two items...bruschetta and the caprese sandwich. Both are fabulous!

The bruschetta is some of the best I&#39;ve EVER had. The tomatoes and basil are always super fresh. The balsamic is aged perfectly for the dish. Sometimes it has fresh parm, sometimes it&#39;s grated shaker parm.

They feature cookies from an Oakbrook bakery that is usually pretty good.

Although they use the right tight of oven, the Neapolitan-style pizza is not very authentic in taste. The pies I&#39;ve had have been on the bland side-- probably the sauce or a lack of salt.

Even more disappointing are the salads.  Salads served with chicken breast use some kind of processed lunch-meat type chicken.  Really?  How hard is it to grill up a fresh chicken breast?"

Like, I&#39;m not a foodie per se, but I do know a whole lot about pizza. My favorite pizza is the super gooey stuffed crust with slices as big as your head. Therefore, it takes kind of a lot for me to rate a place with thin, brick-oven pizza so highly.

Brick&#39;s was a nice surprise for me when I moved to Lombard. Their pizzas are all one uniform thickness (kind of in between a thin and crispy and a hand-tossed crust), chewy and very delicious. Their menu is great - they have a variety of pies to choose from, or you can of course special order your own toppings. My favorites so far have been the quattro formaggi and the hawaiian, and my husband loves the BBQ chicken pizza. Size wise, I&#39;d say that one pie is just a little too much for a super hungry person, but not quite enough for two moderately hungry people. We usually order two, and end up with a couple slices of leftovers (though, it doesn&#39;t reheat all that great). I&#39;ve also tried the salads and those are fantastic. I expect a pretty terrible salad at a pizza joint, but they put just as much love into preparing the other dishes as they do their pizzas.

Side note: check out Groupon before you dine here - they often have a special, 2 pizzas for $14. I always stock up whenever Brick&#39;s pops up on Groupon!"

Generally in my group of friends, you get to pick where you want to go for your birthday. Well, even tho my friend&#39;s birthday was in April, we finally made it to Bricks this past Saturday night. We&#39;re a little behind in the get-togethers...

They had an extensive menu of 12&#34; pizza selections, or you can choose toppings to make your own. Here&#39;s what I&#39;d recommend. If you&#39;re with a group of friends, do it tapas-style, where you order a bunch of pizzas and share them as they come out. Because even tho my wife and I shared the two pizzas we ordered, my friend next to me made up his own and it looked awesome. I should&#39;ve asked him for a slice. Oh well. 

The folks at the counter were really friendly, the pizzas came out within about 10 minutes of ordering them and our server checked on us no less than three times in the 90 or so minutes we were there. 

Also? When we arrived, the place was empty, but when we left it was packed. And they were kind of shuffling us out the door to turn our table around. The girl did it in the nicest possible way, but I think there was a group reservation for the table we had and they were coming in shortly. I think that was the only real negative of the evening. They probably could&#39;ve handled that better since when we arrived we were the only people in the place, they might&#39;ve said they had a large group coming in and not to sit at that particular table. I dunno. She was so friendly about it that it didn&#39;t really rub me the wrong way, but it was a little awkward, I guess.

The food was okay, but I didn&#39;t think the chicken on our BBQ chicken pizza was very good. It tasted like the pre-packed cubed stuff you get from the coldpack case at the grocery store to put on salads. You know, the rubbery stuff that only vaguely tastes like chicken? I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s definitely what they use, but it tasted that way. But the sauce and the cheese more than made up for it. There was smoked gouda on it that gave it a nice smokey flavor. 

The other pizza we went with was the White Arugula. It was okay, but the main flavor was from the arugula, which was fresh, but they put pepper on it, which seemed out of place since arugula is peppery as it is. It could&#39;ve used a sharper cheese than mozzarella, and they kind of skimped on the proscuitto. I wouldn&#39;t order this one again.

Actually, I probably wouldn&#39;t return unless a friend picked it again. It was okay, but wood-fired pizzas aren&#39;t my thing to begin with. I don&#39;t like the burned-crust taste that kind of goes hand-in-hand with the concept. Bricks hasn&#39;t really found the balance of well-cooked but not blackened, and I know most places that do wood-fired pizza have similar issues. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s an acquired taste, but not one that I particularly enjoy. 

The food was just okay, so I would give them four stars on that. The service was super-friendly and efficient, so I&#39;d give that star back to them on that. But then there was the whole issue with the table at the end, so I&#39;m knocking them back to four."

I had a hankering for pizza and while I&#39;m a huge Michael Anthony&#39;s fan, I was feeling like trying something new. I&#39;ve passed by Bricks many times so I thought I would give it a try. The inside was smaller than I imagined it would be, but it wasn&#39;t super crowded. I think a lot of people take out their pizza. Upon first walking in, I see a bunch of autographs from those that have stopped in. One was from Rise Against. I let out a squeal. Already winning in my book. Then I looked over to the big board with the pizzas. We ordered the sausage pizza, bruschetta and two beers. They say they have craft beers, but they really only had two. Meh. No biggie. I wasn&#39;t there for the beer anyway.

Our bruschetta came out first. Holy freshness. The tomato chucks were huge and they were incredibly fresh and juicy. Some of the best bruschetta I&#39;ve had. Then the pizza came. It was perfectly thin and delicious. Real freakin&#39; italian sausage. The crust was perfect. I love wood fired crust. My bf and I gobbled that pizza up in no time.

&#34;Can we have another,&#34; he asked. Considering we did a ton of yard work that day, I figured we earned it so this time we ordered an arugula pizza. Damn that&#39;s a lot of arugula. Kinda made it a bit hard to eat since there was so much on there, but I appreciate that they didn&#39;t skimp. We got full halfway through the pizza, so we took the rest home. We left belly full and happy. I&#39;m glad we finally made it to Bricks and we&#39;ll likely make it part of our regular go-to restaurants."

Over the past few years I&#39;ve been finding myself traveling back into the city specifically to enjoy a nice wood oven/brick oven pizza. I&#39;ve kind of grown out of the deep dish phase, but not entirely, I promise!

But Bricks does the pizza right. They have a very nice menu with pre-selected pizza ingredients, or you can build your own. 

We had the bruschetta appetizer to start. Now this has become such a big thing in Italian-American restaurants and I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve had someone screw up this simple dish. But I was pleasantly surprised with their version. The pane (bread) was perfectly toasted, whereas many places over-toast it, and the tomatoes/basil were very well marinated. If I had to nitpick at this piece, I&#39;d have to defer to the cheese. It looks like they just used a typical parmesan cheese you would find in those green bottles at grocer. It would have been perfect with some hand-grated parmesan or mozzarella.

Then we had two pizzas: the pepperoni &amp; banana peppers, and the prosciutto &amp; baby spinach. I could break these down individually but they were both phenomenal. Very fresh, very tasteful, and both brought their own consistency. Absolutely no complaints on the pizza.

The prices were very very reasonable. And the service was nice. I have to imagine it&#39;s family-owned because they were quite young, but I didn&#39;t mind as they were very prompt and professional.

I will definitely be returning a few more times this summer to try out the entire menu :) (don&#39;t judge me!)"

Bricks has a very good version with a nice chewy crust with that lovely blistering from the wood-fired, brick oven.  I&#39;m a traditionalist so I usually order the Margherita; fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, olive oil. Prices are reasonable and the location makes for an easy pizza pick-up from the train station. 

However, for those of you really into Neopolitan pizza, I recommend Parker&#39;s Restaurant &amp; Bar just a few miles south of downtown Lombard at Highland &amp; 31st. Their Neopolitan pizza&#39;s are VPN (certified as the real deal). You can taste the difference. The Margherita was voted one of the Top 25 Pizzas in Chicago by Chicago Magazine. You can order by phone and pick it up in the bar. It&#39;s slightly less expensive too."

The wood fired pizza is great! We tried two pizzas and loved them both.  I also thought we should order a salad (I had just gotten back from a fairly indulgent vacation) and thought I would just split it with my mom.  The salad was a big portion! It wasn&#39;t anything special but it easily feed three of us and probably could have feed another, but my dad also ordered a side salad. 

Our pizza came out quickly and I loved the fresh ingredients. I really loved the prices.  It only cost a little over $20 for the 4 of us to eat.  I&#39;m sure if I was starving I could have eaten an entire pizza by myself but like I said, it&#39;s a perfect lunch spot."

If you find yourself craving the same and are in the area, I&#39;d suggest you drop into Bricks. The variety is there whether you&#39;re looking for a fully customized za or off the Brick shelf. 

We went with the asparagus and spinach dip app and followed up with the Brick&#39;s pizza (sausage, mushrooms, and red onions). After ordering we decided to add the BBQ chicken pizza (grilled chicken, red onions, and Gouda cheese).

First, the dip app. They serve it with the same crust as the pizza ex the sauce and toppings. Oven baked, great taste with a caramelized top. Good for 2-4 diners. Next, the zaaa, the sausage was the highlight of the Brick&#39;s pizza. Portions can satisfy 1-2. The BBQ has a good sauce. The chicken is satisfactory, seems too perfectly diced and questions if it&#39;s packaged. Also, the Gouda didn&#39;t pop out as much as I was hoping. Overall a good experience and we will definitely have to go back when craving the NY style. Next on the list will be a build your own with roasted garlic, spinach, and Roma tomatoes.

Smile when ordering!"

Only thing I would change is different Italian salad dressings, maybe a simple house inspired non sweet vinaigrette, and a touch less sweet sauce. But that&#39;s my taste influenced from traveling so much.

Most of the diners had finished their meals and there were only 4 tables awaiting pizzas. My husband ordered a pizza and I ordered the very veggie with a gluten free crust. Both of our pizzas arrived with limp, soggy crust, minimal toppings and very little cheese and they were room temperature. We asked for them to be heated up and they did but the crusts remained mushy and tasteless. They reminded us of frozen pizzas. We couldn&#39;t figure out how they could be so mushy and doughy when they were cooked in a brick oven unless they were not cooked long enough or at a high enough temperature. There was about a tablespoon of cheese on the whole pizza and so little sauce that you could see the crust through the thin smear of sauce. One of the worst pizzas I&#39;ve ever had.

The coke machine isn&#39;t watered down or jimmyed. It actually tastes good. Also the ice is the way I Want it not the quick turn small water softener tasting style.

It was spicy and cooked appropriately. The ingredient combination was spot on and had the right mix of flavors.

Being from Chicago, we are a little snooty about what qualifies as &#34;amazing&#34; pizza, but we figured we&#39;d give it a try.

We ordered the Very Veggie, Margarita, and the White Arugula. Overall, these were very sub-standard pizzas. They do taste brick-oven made which gives you a taste you can&#39;t get any other way, but otherwise there wasn&#39;t a single thing to rant and rave about them. The crust is extremely thin but not in a good NYC pizza thin kind of way, rather a crispy cracker kind of way. 

For a &#34;very veggie&#34; to only have a few strips of yellow pepper and some mushrooms, that was a total let down.

The Margarita has next to no mozzarella on it and the basil was almost burnt.

The White Arugula was our favorite but had barely any proscuitto on it, considering that was supposed to be the primary topping along with all the arugula they put on top.

Unfortunately the pizza I had today was neither. The crust was limp and not close to crisp on the bottom even though the top was cooked well. Very mediocre at best.

When the pizza was brought to our table it wasn&#39;t even hot so we returned it to be reheated. It came back hot but still not crisp on the bottom. When I asked to have it reheated, they were happy to oblige but no one seemed particularly concerned that it was not good in the first place.

 The toppings (artichoke and pesto) were flavorful but the crust itself was quite bland. To have a good white pizza you need to use better flour and have a more flavorful crust."

They do have a small dining area so if you are looking to eat at the restaurant, there are usually a few tables open, with one very large table that can fit about 10-12 people.

Three of us split an order of garlic bread and two pizzas, plus a free bundt cake for checking in, and it was just about the right amount of food. But it wasn&#39;t super-filling, so if you want leftovers I suggest adding a salad or making it one pizza per person. 

The garlic bread was nothing fancy, but it was really good bread. And the pizza crust was great -- just the right amount of light crispiness and yeasty goodness. Add in super-fresh delectable toppings of our choosing and you&#39;ve got one great little pizza.

We&#39;ll definitely be back to Bricks. (And I gotta try that salad!)"

We ordered a few different pizzas for take out and the BBQ chicken was the only one that was really good. They were also not very big and on the pricey side. This would not be a good take out option for a large group/party..... Even though my experience wasn&#39;t that great, I would still recommend anyone who is interested to give it a try.

I started with the Bricks Sticks (breadsticks).  They were okay, there was nothing about them that would prompt me to order them again.  Next course - the PIZZA.  I have to capitalize it because it was fantastic!  As a vegetarian, I am always looking for a good combination of veggies, and the Artichoke Pesto with Roasted Peppers was a home run.  The menu description of this pizza is, &#34;Sweet Basil Pesto, Oven Roasted Artichokes Hearts, Roasted Red Peppers &amp; Garlic, Mozzarella, Provolone &amp; Parmesan.&#34;  The crust was perfect, the amount of cheese was perfect, the flavors were perfect.  The only thing I would change is to put a few more roasted red peppers on it.  

Not to echo everyone else, but the service was great, the entire staff is very friendly.  Overall, they are doing just about everything well, but I wish they would switch out the styrofoam drink cups to paper.

The food and ingredients are of high quality. They have unique pizzas (I had the Hawaiian Pizza that had fresh pineapple, ham, cheese, cinnamon, and almonds on it!) sandwiches and salads. They make them fresh and bring them to you nice and warm. I also had a Kitchen Sink cookie (white, milk and dark chocolate chips, pecans and walnuts and oatmeal and raisins) and they offered to heat it up for me and then cut it into 4 triangles to make it easier to eat and share with my friend- thoughtful!

1.  Wood fire.  I don&#39;t even know why I like wood fired pizza so much, but apparently I dig on it in a major way.  
2.  ULTRA THIN crust.  But it&#39;s not TOO floppy or messy or soggy.  Perfectly crisped and oiled with a chewiness and a crispiness that is PERFECTION.  Perfection, I tell you!
3.  Build Your Own.  How can you not love that?  
4.  Fresh ingredients.  And a ton of them to choose from.
5.  Pay at the counter and seat yo&#39; damn self.  That means less money for tipping and more money for eating.  

I built my own pizza (garlic olive oil, goat cheese, bacon, basil, and two kinds of mozza) and my man had the pepperoni.  Per ushe.  We each got our own (although one COULD serve two people if you&#39;re not total pigs like we are).  Both pizzas were magical and weren&#39;t too expensive.  If I HAVE to complain about something it would be their lack of fresh-brewed iced tea (they have bottled sweet tea) or delicious craft beer, but seriously, for pizza this good I can live without both."

We used to go more often but since going gluten free it is a little harder to eat there, much to my dismay! But I recently went and they were very nice when I asked for no bread for the Chicken Pesto sandwich. The girl taking my order asked if there was something they can do to make it a little more interesting (my words not hers but I appreciated the gesture) by adding a bit more pesto. I was grateful that she asked.

I hate to do this, because Bricks used to be so awesome, but the food has steadily declined in quality the past couple years. The pizzas that used to be light and tasty are now almost inedible. I&#39;m talking about a paper thin, flavorless crust covered in bland tomato sauce and very skimpy toppings. I wish I had taken a picture of the greasy, gloppy mess that was on the flimsy crust because you really had to see it to believe it. We had ordered several pizzas for company and they were embarrassing to the point where we had to keep apologizing to our friends for the sucky pizza.

The salads are always really good also.   My son loves the BBQ chicken sandwich, and I&#39;ve had the tomato mozzarella sandwich as well, and although it was good, I felt it had too much balsamic on it, but that&#39;s probably a personal preference.

It&#39;s not the type of restaurant you need a reservation for. We checked, though it is busy; there was limited seating. Each pizza is about 12&#34; and therefore served 2 perfectly (the crust is thin, so we&#39;re not too gluttonous). We also both had drinks (lemon pellegrino &amp; tea) and a dessert and the grand total was $18 with our tip! Make sure you tip. Although it isn&#39;t a true sit down restaurant since you order from a counter, they still bring out the drinks and food to you and take the trays/plates away.
We checked in on yelp and had a free dessert as the check-in offer stated, even though it was technically expired, they still honored it. After we finished our pizza, we still hadn&#39;t received our dessert so I asked one of the employees and she informed us that the cashier that rang us out hadn&#39;t realized that they didn&#39;t have carrot cake. So, they brought us out 2 desserts instead!
It&#39;s by no means fancy and very casual. But would still make a great date option. They do serve many different types of craft beers and wine as well.
There was a dark haired slender woman that helped us twice while we were there. I hope she received some of the tip! Make sure you leave a tip the service is fantastic and they deserve more than the $9 that they are probably getting!"

Bumped it down a star due to the price versus the amount of pizza you get in exchange. Nonetheless, you do get one tasty small pie!

I started off with the Greek Salad.   As was mentioned in a prior review, this salad is pretty big--definitely made for 2. I appreciated that they offered to split it for us that way we didn&#39;t have to get messy.  Very fresh romaine and spinach, feta cheese, red onions, lots of olives (which I love) and a great tangy dressing that&#39;s served on the side (which I also love). 

The Cuz and I ordered 2 different pizzas so we could taste different options.  She the garlic oil base, mozz, italian sausage and mushroom.  For me, the pesto base, with chicken, mozz and roasted garlic.  These may be thin crusts, but the pizza packs a lot of flavor.  Fresh ingredients, made very well, served to order.

The thing that&#39;s especially great is that while there are several pizzas on the menu with gourmet toppings, you can also get simpler pizzas for the less adventurous eaters, shall we say? In fact, I was introduced to this place by my uncle, who lives in the area. He knows what he likes, and he likes to keep it simple. But he told me he loves this place because they make a great pizza -- and he can take people there who like to eat &#34;weird&#34; stuff -- like me and his nephew. Everyone&#39;s happy. 

They have a few decent bottled beers available, too, as well as the usual soft drinks. I still have yet to try their sandwiches, but I&#39;m sure I will at some point.

As I only had so much money on me that day(would&#39;ve tried the create your own pizza otherwise), I ended up getting the Italian Grinder sandwich to go. I have to say I was extremely impressed by how good the sandwich was, to the point that I like it better than the A Wreck sandwich at Potbelly. Have to admit I didn&#39;t have high expectations going in(and since I too often almost hit my data limit each month, to the point I too often can&#39;t browse sites on my phone in fear of going over the limit, wasn&#39;t able to skim yelp and urbanspoon ratings of this place beforehand...), but I have to say I&#39;m glad I made the snap decision to try this place out since I barely saw any non-chain places to eat open.

Ordered the Artichoke Pesto with Roasted Peppers wood fired pizza. It comes out about 12-14 wide. It&#39;s quite thin, but good flavor. Garlic-y, minimal roasted peppers and artichoke, but enough pesto to round out the flavor of the cheeses. 
Portion-wise, my wife and I were pretty satisfied with the salad, pizza, and drink to share.
Bricks is a nice place for a quick bite to eat with a sit down feel. Decent portions, flavors, and prices mixed together. 
I would come again."

I had a strong feeling when walking in my meal wouldn&#39;t be satisfying.  I was absolutely correct.

Upon entering the place, a stocky Chinese guy manning the front counter desk was apparently busy with his phone and took forever to acknowledge my party and rudely at that.  Instead of asking the always asked, &#34;How many?&#34;, he just blankly stares at us silently until I ask him for a table.  Sorry to mess up your day buddy.
The server, also rude, I saw three times the entire meal.  1. Take the order.  2. Bring order.  3. Bring check.  Not once did he check up to see if we needed anything or asked how the food was.  Even if we did need something, he was nowhere to be seen anyways.

As a first time customer there, my party of two ordered 2 lunch specials- Pad thai and the 2 roll special.
The pad thai came out first, and I was shocked.  First, a tiny dish with tiny serving.  Second, all the usual toppings like bean sprouts, chives, egg were so sparingly added, they may as well have not been added at all.  Third, the place charges a dollar extra for chicken, and they use chicken thigh dark meat, sparingly as well?  What restaurant these days uses chicken thigh?  Even the cheapest Chinese takeout uses chicken breast.  The pad thai was NOT pad thai.  It tasted nowhere close to it.  Horrible dish.  Fail.

So the place can redeem themselves with the 2 roll lunch special right?  Wrong.  
One &#34;roll&#34; was 6 pieces of maki sushi which is a roll with a single ingredient and rolled into the size of an index finger.  Fail.  
The other roll which was eel was about half the size of an identical roll at any other sushi place.  There were 8 pieces of the eel roll but at this place&#39;s laughably small size, those 8 pieces probably equate to half the quantity of a typical roll anywhere else.  Fail.

If you want sushi, you&#39;re better off going to the AYCE sushi over on Ogden in Westmont.

I will never go back to Wild Ginger.  I offer my warning to others to stay away from this overpriced joke of a restaurant."

Stale, old, dried out tiramisu and creme brûlée cake that they microwaved as it was likely refrigerated way too many days past its prime. Probably our fault for ordering these desserts in a sushi place... Can&#39;t imagine that anyone orders desserts there. They should get them fresh from Toni&#39;s or Sweet Ali.

Japanese: obviously wild ginger knows nothing about true japanese cuisine because... What is that LED crap they serve the sushi with? Its about the &#34;pure&#34;... Just because it has a swanky bar doesn&#39;t mean it serves good sushi people!!! Go to nobuki... One of the best in Chicago land area... Truly!!

Chinese: ordered Mongolian beef, sesame chicken and combo fried rice. Since the owners are Chinese i hoped this was good. I really wanted Mongolian beef with scallions and not green bell peppers, kinda odd, beef was decent, rice was on the bland side but decent. Sesame chicken was really good. If you want good authentic Chinese go to yu&#39;s... Even Chinese people drive there an hour to the original location in Schaumburg... Now recently opened in westmont. And there&#39;s always jade dragon a Hinsdale classic. I like people who support the community so even though their food is meh I support jade.

Thai: how can you go wrong w a noodle dish? I thought it was really good, surprisingly. Although their spring roll was awful! They cut it in halves? Why? Half the filling fell off and the best part about a spring roll is you eat it in whole so you see the steam when you bite into it???

I love thai food and was waiting for a decent thai restaurant in Hinsdale because I get sick and tired of going to thippi thai in LA Grange (the best in Chicago land)... I now live in Chicago and I&#39;ll still come out for thippi thai for their panaang. So disappointed these people are confused!!!!

Price was decent. 

Waitress was super sweet except I didn&#39;t understand a word she was saying and she really didn&#39;t understand anything I asked her about the menu. People: we are at a restaurant ... You should understand basic &#34;food questions&#34;.

It was a little saucy and I don&#39;t know, it was just kind of underwhelming.  We asked for extra broccoli and our waiter (who may also be the owner?), made some jokes about how next time he would let the chef know it was for some pretty girls, but he didn&#39;t really make an effort to change it.

This Asian crossover offers the classics of Chinese, Thai and Japanese in a setting that is fitting and classy without being uppity or hokey.  I&#39;ve eaten dinner and two lunches there and found the food to be consistently good and the service excellent.  

We first came for dinner when we were shut out of packed Vistro up the street, and found the menu selection and quiet atmosphere a welcome respite from the loud and crowded trendy neighbor.  


I liked the flair in presenting our California roll stacked up into a triangle with the plate decorated in flowers.  The Panang  Curry was good - not as good a Thipy Thai, and very mild. They can skip adding all the mushrooms and improve the dish.  

The Chinese stir fry dishes at lunch were tasty and seemed more upscale than Jade Dragon across the street (although the price was somewhat higher, the serving size smaller, and no free tea and fortune cookies!) My wife is a Pad Thai fanatic and liked their version here. 

Glad to see they removed the tacky neon &#34;Open&#34; sign from the front window.  If they want to see me come more often, they will need to add a couple of craft beers to their selection. Most Hinsdaleans have left Miller Lite and Budweiser behind and would much prefer a local Two Brothers or Lagunitas IPA to the Asian Tsing Tao and Sapporo standards.  Keep those, but add some craft choices for the fast growing group that prefers full bodied beers with spicy foods. Please!"

The Japanese-Thai-Chinese promise is a dead giveaway. Stick to one thing and do it the best you can, rather than offer mediocre fare across the board. The salad was simple and fresh but suffered from the use of a heavy mayonnaise dressing.  The pad Thai lacked flavor and the chicken tasted a bit rubbery.

Pad Thai was too heavy - none of that light fresh taste from a place that does it well. We ordered some Udon for the kids, the tempura was solid - noodles ok - but broth had too much random greens and the like - go to a real Japanese place and it is accented with those.  Fried tofu appetizer very mediocre. 

Pricing wise expensive - then my pet peeve,  We ordered two of the Udon bowls without tempura for the younger kids - they just like the noodles.  When the bill came every other restaurant gives us a bit of a discount - after all just soup and noodles - no tempura.  Nope charged the full $13-14 a bowl - which is too high.

The first time we did carry out Thai food and the noodle dishes taste very Americanized. The second time dined in with friends. The martini glass was not filled up and tasted very weak, ordered beer and was given no glass, ordered crispy noodles and was served non crispy noodles...lack of presentation and very small sushi rolls.

The décor is gentle, warm, quiet and welcoming.  The staff attentive and helpful with suggestions.  And the food..........delicious.  We started with the cucumber/crab salad, like a cucumber slaw with loads of crab and definitely big enough to share.  Can&#39;t wait to try the seaweed   salad next time.  For entrees, we decided to try things we could compare to other places we&#39;ve loved.  Had the ginger chicken and the Thai beef fried rice.  Again, large portions perfectly cooked.  Looking forward to returning many times to try so many different offerings from rolls to sashimi to noodles, etc, etc.  YUM!"

Two of us had the hibachi filet, which was very good (it is still better when cooked right in front of you, though), and I would order it again. Sushi rolls were good, as well. Everyone enjoyed the soups that were served before our meals. The service was very good, as well. Overall, we had a nice dinner and are planning to go back soon!"

Overall very pleased. Food tasted fresh and good. The whole thing reminded me of a slightly more upscale Wendy&#39;s and that was OK. Price was about level with the other higher end burger joints (Smashburger, Five Guys, That Burger Joint all a stone&#39;s throw away) and to be honest I thought the burgers at Wayback were on par OR better than the others. Certainly less greasy than Five Guys and food takes a reasonable amount of time to come out. 

I&#39;d go again. Felt compelled to post this after disagreeing with the reviews on here."

Each burger is 3 ounces and you can order 1, 2 or 3 patties. I stopped in after going to a movie, probably their target market, and was not impressed at all. The counter staff were rude and acted as if I was interrupting their day by coming in. None of them could tell me the size of the burgers except to say they were comparable to Oberweis&#39;s burger place up the street. Not smart to compare your product to a competitor. I ended up ordering a single with mayo, ketchup and lettuce being that I didn&#39;t know how big they were. I also ordered a small fries and a milkshake. The best thing were the fries. The milkshake was second and the burger wouldn&#39;t bring me back again. 

As I was eating the manager walked out from the back, ignored the employees that were just standing around and leaned against the counter. 

I motioned to have him come over to talk to and his expression shouted &#34;oh great, another customer who wants to talk to me&#34;. I explained my concerns and got the typical &#34;thank you for bringing this to my attention&#34; he then said &#34;I can&#39;t do anything about it because the staff (high school kids) know that they can walk out at any time. They just don&#39;t care&#34;.  

I explained that I wouldn&#39;t be back because of these issues and he said he hears that all the time and knows they lose 2 customers for every 4 or 5 that come in. 

Not sure if they are going to be around in a year but they won&#39;t be missed if they aren&#39;t."

First for the price I expected more. If I go to a place like Red Robin I pay about the same and it includes fries and is server hot. We place an order at Wayback on line and it was for 3 burgers, one kids chicken tender meals 3 orders of fries one with a cup of cheese side, the mac and cheese bites and an order of onion rings.   Plus a variety of the dipping sauces.

So where to start... The oder way placed and we were told it would be ready in about 18 minutes. We left right away since we are about ten minutes away. Once we got there we were shocked to see it empty. The employees were standing around talking to each other. That being said once they say us they did come to help us. We were told it would just be a minute, which was perfect. Our bags were sitting on the counter before we got there with food in them. Once the team we were waiting on was placed in the bags the girl packing the bags went to find the sauce we ordered. It took almost 5 minutes for her to return with the sauce.

We get home with the food and start unpacking. Things did not get better. first the sides, fries, mac and cheese bite and the chicken tenders were in cheap paper food boats that were just kind of tossed into the bag. They were falling all over. They could have wrapped it in foil or something.  The onion rings were not there even though the employee checked the order three time. Now the buyers were smashed under all the side and sauce. Not only were they smashed the were almost cold. I will say if they were warm or even hot they might have tasted good but they were not so they definitely did not taste good. The fries with a side of cheese were fries with a silce of cheese melted on them. The sides were all cold. I will say that the mac and cheese bits were ok even cold. If they were warm I bet they would be so good.

The one thing that was really bad was with the sauce. We did order a few different sauces. They came in unmarked little cups so we had no idea what was what. They make a ghost pepper sauce and a chipotle mayo that were so very good but we ordered a blue cheese and they gave us one that had spoiled!!

Over all even if all the food was there and it was served warn and not just thrown into a bag, for what you pay you might as well spend less and go to a fast food burger place like McDonalds and get the same quality or spend the same and go to someplace like Red Robins or TGIFridays and get a decent meal."

My parents and I tried to go here for dinner last night and the place was MOBBED. We waited at least 5 minutes to order, then gave it to a girl who just seemed overwhelmed and messed up the total three times due to a coupon. 

After twenty minutes of waiting with no sign that our food might be in sight, my dad went and asked at the counter what number they were on. The girl there said, &#34;Oh, we don&#39;t go in number order.&#34; ?? So they basically had no idea of how long it might be yet. Meanwhile there were many other people sitting around with the same looks on their faces as us (expectant, annoyed and hungry). 

Finally my dad went and told them to cancel the order, since the end did not seem to be in sight. That girl tried to give him back less money than he paid (the total is right on the receipt??) and then said, &#34;It was worse when I worked at Buffalo Wild Wings.&#34; (How is that germane to this situation at all?)

The atmosphere was insane. There was just general confusion going on; the place was insanely loud, and we saw a staff member try to give a milkshake to the wrong person twice, so one hand really didn&#39;t seem to know what the other hand was doing. 

To cap it off, my father spoke to the manager before we left, who was full of excuses (because he&#39;d probably been making them to other dissatisfied customers: we had seen another guy complaining earlier). The best was, &#34;This is just our grand opening!&#34; Um, I call B.S.: I was here a month ago!! You have had plenty of time to figure it out. It seems that they have gotten flooded with more business than they know how to handle (perhaps due to coupons), and they need to rethink their strategy. As it is, the place is small so there&#39;s not enough room for more staff members back there than are currently working, so they need to work smarter or they will definitely lose more customers. We won&#39;t be back."

Always anxious to try new places, we checked it out. We did this takeout and the order waas correct and well packaged for the trip home.

Excellent burgers! We got the classics and the Phillys.  The Philly may have been a bit bland but the meat and bun were both great. Didn&#39;t have the classic but I understand they were excellent.

The fries were outstanding- I give them a 4 out of 5 on the Tony Fry-o-meter (Ricobene&#39;s in Chicago remains no.1!).

We got no shakes but did get frosted lemonade which apparently was delicious.

Tab was somewhere around $45 for 4 burgers, large fries and lemondade, which puts it right there with Five Guys, Meatheads, etc.

1.the staff.- while friendly, they lack a  leader to help organize and create a cohesive flow to work. It seems as though they are all running around like chickens with their heads cutoff, criss crossing themselves, at times uncertain to who ordered what.
2. The decor- while clean, the decor and color selection is uninviting! Brown color walls to me are unappealing. When we sat down, there was a broom sitting in the middle of the dining room.
3- the food- some build your own burgers similar to other burger joints, how ever here is where they dropped the ball totally. The buns were cold, as if they were taken straight out of the fridge. The tomatoes, pickles and lettuce also cold. The only thing warm were the patties, which were under seasoned! Fries were less than stellar and the onion rings lacked seasoning as well. I asked another patron if their buns were cold and they too were.

Overall, it was a place i would never visit again. When i told them the buns were cold they just offered to heat up the whole buger!!

You can taste the freshness here.  All other burger joints, like five guys and meatheads put too much salt in their meat.  


This place has awesome burgers.  I got a deal for a free Wayback Classic when you buy a combo meal.  Good deal and better burgers than the places in the immediate area.  If you want a good burger where you don&#39;t need salt for this to taste good, try this place out."

The place is very clean &amp; we were greeted immediately walking in.  It&#39;s another burger joint along the lines of Five Guys &amp; Meatheads.  Slightly overpriced  double cheeseburgers around $7, $2-3 side and $2 drink.  Old school Dan still says he shouldn&#39;t be paying $12-13 for a burger, fries &amp; pop.  Anyway....

I ordered the &#34;cheesy&#34; double burger with everything.  I wasn&#39;t in the mood for a side, but my friend ordered the same burger along with the house made chips. After placing our order, we sat down since they bring your food to you.   The chips came out first by themselves after about 5 minutes.  They were okay.  Some were underdone, some were overdone.  They needed some seasonings too.  The burgers came out about 5 minutes later.  My &#34;cheesy&#34; was very good but served with upside down bun they put on the flat top.  A little unusual looking presentation but the burger itself was very tasty.  Patties were cooked great, well seasoned, fresh, etc. The bun and burger combo seemingly gave it a grilled cheese burger taste &amp; look, which I enjoyed.  

Can&#39;t say I&#39;d give this a huge thumbs up, but I do like it and ill be back.  4 stars here says &#34;yay, I&#39;m a fan&#34;, while 3 is a-ok.  This place falls right in the middle for me. 3.5 stars.

So rich and creamy.  Plenty of kids meals for our little ones too.  We went on Monday, Columbus Day for lunch with the kids. Place was clean and the service was quick and friendly.

I&#39;m always willing to try something new, but I will admit I was a bit weary because I did read some of the reviews that were posted here on Yelp. Despite the reviews I decided to give them a chance. When we first entered there was literally nobody in the restaurant, and there was two people behind the counter. A man and a women. The only thing I did not appreciate was when he asked if we were ready to order and I answered yes and still had to wait about five minutes to order. Even though there was no one there. The food itself was really good. I order the Philly cheese steak burger and I thought it was phenomenal. I think they put enough seasoning on it. I also ordered small fries and a strawberry shake(regular size). I felt the food was really really good, my friend enjoyed her food also, I believed she ordered the cheesy burger? (Don&#39;t quote me) but she really enjoyed her meal too. The man also walked around to check on everybody and asked how their meal was. Wayback is a really unique burger joint, they have a lot of interesting stuff on their menu that differentiates them from other restaurants. I will definitely be back for more in the future!"

After a few minutes, a nice young gentleman brought our order over to our table. The buns are so soft and fluffy and the burger is just perfection. The French fries are crispy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. The shakes are sooo good. We both enjoyed strawberry shakes and agreed they were great!!

All I can say is it must be growing pains that made the wait so long as everyone looked confused. The burgers however were very good. Thought I would try it again for lunch today (Monday). No confusion and no excessive wait for the food. A few minutes after ordering our TASTY burgers were brought to the table 

There are many burger places in the immediate area, and I think the burgers here taste much better than the 2 places across the street. 

Make sure you get the onion rings."

My wife and I went there Saturday night. Not only did we have to wait over 20 minutes for our food (wasn&#39;t even busy there) but the food is just bland and doesn&#39;t taste like anything. I mean, burgers and fries, right? You can&#39;t really screw it up but they made me rethink that. The burgers are small and the bun is too big and they apparently think each burger requires a pound of ketchup and mustard. Seriously, I can&#39;t believe this place got franchised. There really is nothing redeeming about this place. Again, I&#39;m not one to bash local businesses but this place needs to go Wayback to the drawing board."

My complaints and reasoning for not giving 4-stars were service and their prices are a little bit on the high side compared to comparable burger places in the area such as &#34;That Burger Joint&#34; and Five Guys which are both located directly across the street. Don&#39;t get me wrong I have no problem paying high prices for great food but their burgers are really no better than their local competition so why the premium price??? It took them forever to get us out food and it was during an off peak dining time, about 4:30 pm on a Sunday so I for the life of me can&#39;t figure out what took them nearly 15 minutes to prepare. If the service was better I&#39;d give it 4 stars. I will also add that Wayback Burger has a much more vast menu than the other two places I mentioned. I will most likely go back and give them a second chance, food was good I might have just been there on an off day."

The cashier called for someone to drop a fish into the fryer.  When she realized no one had done it, she walked away from the register, turned around, opened the freezer, and dropped it in herself.  The problem was she had been handling cash!!!  She did not have any gloves on when she handled the fish!!  I was so grossed out at the point I knew I would not be back.  Yuck!!"

When we got home and pulled out the food only 1 burger and 2 fries. Called said they forgot our chicken strips and that I&#39;m coming back for them. (I mean what a pain in the bum! I had to pack my kids back in tha car to go back) 

Once we got there I was told that they were out of chicken strips and they had to refund our money. They didn&#39;t offer anything else for the  massive inconvenience  they caused. Which resulted in my taking my kid to Panera to get there dinner while my burger and fries sat at home. It was cold and no longer editable.

The burgers were cheaper than McDonald&#39;s and did not look anything remotely like what advertised on the board.

I went back and ordered onion rings and a small shake.  Rings were good and shakes were amazing.  If you get the shake to dine in, they put the shakes in a silver tin can - just like the good old days.

The employees were talking and I think so training was going on. It took a few minutes for someone to take my order.  I ordered a double cheeseburger and fries to go.  I asked if the fries we&#39;re crispy, they said they were made to order.  The cook, that I assumed was getting trained put two clumps of raw burger on the grill and grab the spatula and started cooking.  He cooked the burgers and another couple came in and ordered Chicken burger and a cheese burger.  He grabbed the raw chicken and raw meat and put them on the grill and grabbed the spatula and finished my burger.  Put the burger on bun and grabbed the bun, placed my order on the paper and wrapped it up.  So he finished my food after touching raw chicken and meat.  Plus the spatula handle was contaminated.  With 3 other workers, he should not have been touching the buns.  Then they decided to cook my fries.  Not sure why the didn&#39;t start cooking them at the same time as my Burger???  The cook showed me the fries and asked if the were ok.  Having not tasted them to know how crispy they actually were I said OK.  With those food handling procedures, they are lucky the health department hasn&#39;t closed them down.  The fries were Ok and the Burger went in the garbage.  In retrospect, I should have said something and have them make me another, but the cook was just following directions from the manager."

You think an &#34;uppercrust brewpub&#34; would have a bar, a large variety of beers and high-quality appetizers. The service was average, the food was average as well, with high end prices. 

My biggest issue is the descriptions of the food don&#39;t actually match what comes out. I had a smoked pork appetizer that most people would think would be pulled pork or sliced smoked pork. It comes out as a dip, and not something I would recommend. The shrimp appetizer with quinoa comes out with only two shrimp. The beef appetizer I would think would be sliced or shredded beef, comes out as more of a pate or liverwurst. Again, not what I would recommend for $13.

I will not likely be back. There are too many good options in downtown Naperville."

I visited for a quick breakfast.  The two stars is entirely for service. The employees were pleasant and competent. That&#39;s really the only positive. The actual products are sub par and extremely overpriced. 

For a drink, I ordered the fresh pressed juice &#34;Cool Down&#34;. It was okay, but the cucumber really overwhelmed everything else, which defeats the whole concept of a blended juice drink. $8 for 12 ounces of juice that tastes exclusively of cucumber? Never again. 

The real disaster though? The breakfast sandwich. I ordered the Sausage &amp; Egg on a biscuit. It comes as a fried egg, red peppers, pepper jack cheese, sausage, and garlic mayo on a biscuit. Right out the gate, the biscuit is awful. It is pretty much flavorless and has a crisp texture more like you would expect from an English Muffin in a weird way. A decent biscuit is hard to come by around here, and this one certainly lives up to that poor expectation. While the egg was fried perfectly, the red peppers were mostly raw - despite having a few block grill lines. Their undercooked texture lead me to removing them pretty quickly. The final straw though on this being a terrible dish was the sausage itself. It has a horrible sweetness to it. Not a maple syrup balancing out the spice kind of sweetness. No, this is just a terrible sweetness like you are eating sugared pork with almost no other seasoning whatsoever. It was everything a breakfast sausage should not be. I quickly removed it as well. After removing the peppers and sausage, I ended up with a $6 fried egg with a smidge of melted cheese and garlic mayo on a terrible biscuit. Total food failure. 

I really had high hopes for this place. The chefs need to walk around the block to Darkhorse and order a biscuit sandwich one morning. They put out a far superior product. I really like Two Brothers and want to patronize this place, but I&#39;m not sure I can cone to terms with risking $15 again for really poor products.

They have literally managed to combine all my favorite things under one roof: coffee, wine, beer, and farm to table locally sourced food. Amazing.

Rightfully so, this will probably be my first of at least 3 reviews for The Craftsman. If you haven&#39;t heard, this space has three different levels each with its own flare. This review is specifically for their Market Cafe which is the first floor of The Craftsman.

I was bummed I couldn&#39;t stop by on opening day, but it did feel pretty right coming in the following day considering it was national coffee day. I met my husband here about 3:30 pm to post up for a few hours and get some work done on our laptops.

We snagged a spot on their comfy leather chairs which was great because we were right by a little end table and a wall with outlets. Everyone working at the cafe was super friendly and helpful. It&#39;s refreshing to see a restaurant team so on point for their first week being open. Market Cafe has a lot to offer -- a full menu of coffee, smoothies, beer, wine, breakfast bowls, sandwiches, salads, baked goods, cheese, charcuterie... the works. They literally have something to offer everyone at any time of day.

I ordered a large seasonal latte which was a pumpkin coconut flavor. It was hot, delicious, and bursting with flavor. Perfect for a cool, rainy, fall day. Of course I couldn&#39;t pass up something sweet so I got one of their oatmeal cookies as well. This cookie also had I believe white chocolate chips and cranberries maybe? Whatever it was it was yummy and I devoured it.

Hubbie ordered a beer and a turkey sandwich with chips. I had a bite and couldn&#39;t help but agree with him that it was one of the best turkey sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;m not sure what kind of cheese was on it, but it was really good. I also loved the sweetness of the strawberries they included - very unique.

High fives all around to Two Brothers! My first impression of the Market Cafe is great. I will definitely be back with my laptop to hang out. Looking forward to checking out the Modern Tavern and Third Floor as well!"

First we ordered a bacon and egg sandwich which took forever - about 20 mins. We also ordered a half sandwich/half soup combo with the hummus wrap (meh, not that much flavor) and the vegetable broccolini soup (very tasty!)

The restaurant is tucked in a strip mall.  It must be the best kept secret in Aurora!  The restaurant was clean and bright.
Roy made suggestions from the menu for us.  The ribs dinner was fabulous! The ribs fell off the bone, were juicy and tender...not to mention the sauce!  In addition,  the coleslaw was out of this world!
We also had the pulled pork.  Also juicy and tender, the scrumptious sauce was tasty and tangy.  The beans topped off this plate.  
The service was top notch, as Roy served us himself! He also checked back with us to make sure everything was to our liking. 
No longer a secret,  Roy&#39;s ribs will be a regular stop in the future!"

What it is - A friendly place with great ribs.

We called in an order for pickup - a full slab of ribs and a Gyro sandwich combo.  Nothing was too earth shattering about the location.  it seemed clean and friendly enough with plenty of seating (but no one in there - it was a bit late).  Roy himself greeted me and had my order ready right on time, if not a few minutes early.  He thanked me quite a bit for my business and welcomed me to visit his facebook page / etc.

The ribs were tasty.  They weren&#39;t complete mush and had some texture, but were very tender.  There was some slightly burnt sauce on some of the bone ends, but this actually made for good flavor mixed with the other sauce.  The included cole slaw was good, but the &#34;garlic bread&#34; didn&#39;t taste garlicky or buttery - just perfectly toasted toast.  The fries were standard but tasty and plentiful.
The Gyro combo had a ton of meat and toppings.  It wasn&#39;t the best gyro I&#39;ve ever had, but it was pretty good.  The price might be $1-2 high, but it is still in the reasonable range.  We did order greek potatoes with this item and received fries instead without notice, but I&#39;d rather that then bad end of the day greek potatoes in retrospect.

While you are in chicago you can&#39;t expect too much from BBQ, but Roy&#39;s ribs were certainly tasty and worth a trip.  I&#39;ll have to give a few of the other items a shot!

Note - if you are confused why you have a credit receipt from &#34;La Torta El Mercadito&#34; - it is from Roy&#39;s.  I assume that was the previous tenant as the address matches."

The friendly eponymous Roy worked at Gemato&#39;s BBQ in Naperville for years apparently and eventually set out on his own.

As Tim H&#39;s review mentions, some reviewers decry anything claiming to be BBQ that is not &#34;low and slow&#34; smoked meats or what have you. I think this is a mistake since Roy&#39;s ribs are succulent and tender and sport a tasty BBQ sauce. I don&#39;t care how they&#39;re cooked, they&#39;re gewwwd!

$12 gets you a hefty half slab and a choice of Greek style oven baked potatoes or fries and baked beans or slaw. The Greek potatoes I had on visit 1 were so-so. Need to be more lemony-juicy. Fries on visit 2 were fine. I haven&#39;t had the slaw but the beans were good.

I&#39;m gigging a star for incoherence. A lot of these Mexican places in Aurora are completely incoherent, Roy&#39;s is only slightly so. He has a visual menu overhead that doesn&#39;t have prices. So grab a paper menu and now prices are changing. I&#39;d love to try a burger/fry/drink combo meal but I think the $10 he wants for all his sandwich combos is too steep. Should be $7-8.

Roy is fun and friendly. He even knows a ton of Greek words - must be from years in the restaurant biz. Opaaaa!"

A coworker found this little BBQ gem tucked in a strip mall in Aurora. We ordered a large order of ribs, and what seemed like a bucket of fries. The BBQ was really good, ribs were tender and BBQ sauce had decent flavor. But nothing stood out in my mind to separate it from the other BBQ places, hence the reason they only get 4 stars. The only time a BBQ place gets 5 stars in my book is if they blow me away. Having said that though, there is limited seating for lunch, and the few other things we have tried are great. This BBQ is also affordable, which is not always the case at other places. They might not have a smoker going out back 24/7, but their ribs are tender and good!!"

First of all, the food was so good! I ordered grilled  chicken with potato wedges and garlic bread. The chicken tasted similar to Greek chicken...super flavory as well the potatoe wedges. Big portions! So if you are super hungry, this is the place for you. You&#39;ll get the best of both worlds.

Great people, very friendly staff.

I will  sugest to add more options on the board. While I was walking out, I notice someone was ordering a Torta. If I would have known, that&#39;s what I would have gotten. I love tortas!

Definitely recommend this place!"

Nothing fancy, just straight up good old fashioned BBQ.

Had their brisket, pulled pork, ribs, cole slaw, baked beans, roasted potatoes, bread.  The meats were all super tender, not fatty (brisket had some fat content, but it was super tender and juicy fat, no complaints).  Ribs were falling off the bone and juicy. So good!  Pulled pork was super tender.

Sides were all solidly excellent.

Definitely my fav BBQ that I&#39;ve tried.

Roy was always hoping to get his own spot and he went and did it, after 7 years at Gemato&#39;s. If you&#39;re a BBQ fanatic and think meats have to be smoked to be BBQ, then you will leave disappointed. If you enjoy tender meats and a flavorful sauce, then come see Roy.

Roy&#39;s gearing up still and is working with what he currently has from taking over La Torta. I will certainly be by again, as I always enjoy Roy&#39;s passion for good food."

Proportionally it looked good, wedges of potatoes and half chicken, great start.
Then I touched it, felt baked. 
Then I tasted it, ugh, dried, baked and thrown on the grill to it a char.. this is not moist chicken.
But..the &#34;piece de resistance&#34; the name &#34;Half Chicken Greek Style.&#34;
Spritzing with marinade and serving with lemon and lime wedge doesn&#39;t make greek.
Serving claimed chicken with undercooked baked potato wedges doesn&#39;t make it better.

So,,, this place is new since spring and some locals appear to think it&#39;s great. I will probably continue to get my Half Greek Chicken elsewhere, (N Aurora on Rt 56) Maybe check in again in winter to see if the chicken has improved, we&#39;ll see"

I didn&#39;t know what to try because everything looked so good on the menu so one of the chefs recommended the rib tips and boy-o-boy were they good and tender! Even the grissles were tender.  The garlic potato wedges were delicious as well. 

This dish with tax was about $10 and the portion size was enough for me to share with my friend. I will definitely recommend this place to family and friends. I grew up in Memphis- home of b-b-que and this spot can definitley hang! Next time I will try the Greek chicken."

Do not go in expecting amazing bbq. The ribs are good and so is the pulled pork. Although the pulled pork is served on a French roll which is odd

Do NOT go in expecting amazing smoked bbq. It isn&#39;t that. When you walk in you do not smell bbq. I&#39;m not sure if he has a smoker out back or if he has one at all.  The ribs and pork is cooked perfectly though. He would get 5 stars with smokey."

Was Roy&#39;s everything I want in a rib place? No.  As others have mentioned, you are not getting a wood smoked bbq flavor, but it is a nice alternative.  The ribs were good, almost too well done.  The chicken was tender.  I did have an issue with the brisket.  It seemed to have been slow steamed or boiled.  It was fall apart tender, but sliced thick so it was kind of pot roast stringy and again not slow smoked so you get a nice crust.  The same sauce was on everything.  Next time I would get it on the side so I could taste the meat first.
All in all, absolutely a step in the right direction for diversity of food options in the area.  The price was right.  The staff was nice.  Service was fast. The food was good but not exceptional.  I&#39;ll go back and try some of the other choices."

First- this is not a sports bar. For that I&#39;d go a few doors south to Burger Local. This is more upscale than that. But, these guys have a GREAT burger...I loved mine.

Second- not a cocktail bar (there aren&#39;t really any creative cocktail bars in Geneva yet) but they have EXCELLENT cocktails...priced at $10 each. I had three, loved them all.

They have different beer on tap, everyone at the table seemed to enjoy theirs. They have good wines. They have 6 or 8 huge TVs so it&#39;s def a place to go and watch a game.

It makes sense now, but I would have been more less eager to try it had I known it was part sports bar.

I came here one weekend in September for a friend&#39;s birthday. There were seven of us, and the restaurant was actually able to accommodate us right away. One of the first things I noticed was that it was impossible to hear what people were saying at the far end of the table. I am not exaggerating; I could not hear a word when of the first things I noticed was that it was impossible to hear what people were saying at the far end of the table. The acoustics in this restaurant were awful.

There were some vintage pictures on the wall baseball stadiums and what not, but those were mixed with more modern basketball pictures, and so it was tough to tell what era they were shooting for in terms of decor. There were also some very odd swirls painted on the walls, which actually made me wonder if they hadn&#39;t painted after the Japanese restaurant left the building. Two large screen televisions perched in one corner of the restaurant, and to be quite honest, I don&#39;t think televisions have a place in a gastropub. That is why I would classify this as more of a sports bar. But the tiling around the bar area was nice. Unfortunately, the seats were so hard it was difficult to admire much else.

With regard to the food, I was not impressed. The menu was extremely limited, and included typical bar fare even though they tried to dress it up by sticking bits of lobster here and there. You would be kidding yourself if you thought it was real lobster, by the way. After onion rings, corn dogs, and french fries, I was left with the gnocchi, which would have been quite bland if not for the super salty spinach that accompanied it.

I am always happy when a new restaurant moves into Geneva, but this one has a lot of work to do to impress me."

I think I&#39;ll have to caveat this quick review with the admission that the bar was set high for this place well before we sat down ( we are HUGE fans of The Finery in St Charles....same owner).

Service: great. Friendly staff. Knowledgeable about draught selection.

Draught selection: lacking. Disappointed that this place, with so many on tap, lacked any real diversity! A lot of IPAs and APAs, but not much for us &#34;dark beer&#34; guys

Ambiance: NOT The Finery. Lighting cheapens what is obviously an expensive establishment. Sports bar vibe vs gastro-pub we were expecting

Food: we didn&#39;t have much....stopped at appetizers. Had the Korean Lamb chops.....gristle chops. Very poor selection of lamb chops and disappointing!

All in all.....this place &#39;could&#39; be great with a few tweaks--kill the led lights, improve the draught variety and make sure the food is firing on all cylinders......essentially follow The Finery&#39;s lead."

My husband and I shared the hamburger. The beef, not dry or packed but juicy and loaded with flavor (it&#39;s grass fed). Topped with some staples and served on a fluffy bun it was one of the best burgers we had in ages. I loved the melted cheese on the burger - Wow! Wow! Wow!  

Service - very good. Patrick, our server, was very attentive. No Complaints. My fork and knife sat on a little server which I really liked.

My partner&#39;s and I own a breakfast lunch place in the same town. I had the pleasure to meet him at my establishment and quickly found out we share the same passion. Filoxenia is a Greek word that sums it up , meaning freind to a stranger. That&#39;s exactly what I felt when I visited with my partner&#39;s and designer there last week. From the craft drinks to the greatly executed dishes.  The filet and the ancho chicken were outstanding.No need to wish you luck....you got the tiger by the tail."

Menu is pretty limited and different.  Not to my liking.  I love sausage, but as a signature item?  Tried their grass fed burger.  Two patties of meat - good flavor but much better burgers in town.  Others ordered white fish and said it was just okay. When I heard about this place and its affiliation with Finery I thought watch out Preservation, but now I&#39;m thinking Grandstander needs to make some major changes in a hurry!  It was a Saturday night too, and town was packed with people, yet Grandstander was pretty empty.  Hope that&#39;s not a sign of things to come."

I don&#39;t live in the immediate area but my parents do. Tonight we decided to get take out from here and I picked it up since it is pretty close- never used their delivery so I can&#39;t say how it is.

Now growing up my parents always ordered the same thing from this place - chicken fried rice, egg  rolls, chicken Almondine. Well tonight I wanted to try a few new things and we tried the curry chicken, Pad Thai, chicken lo mein, and Gen Tso&#39;s chicken. Loved everything except the curry. It just didn&#39;t taste as good as other places. I get it though, this place doesn&#39;t have a huge menu and I probably shouldn&#39;t have ordered curry from a small Chinese food place. Every place makes their dishes slightly different and this one just didn&#39;t cut it for me.

I love their eggrolls, definitely the best I&#39;ve ever had. And after having the Pad Thai tonight I would highly suggest that as well!

I will continue to come back in the future. Keep up the deliciousness China House!"

  As another yelper mentioned, Ken and his female counterpart are extremely nice and accomodating. The Eggrolls are the best, and they will flavor food to your liking. 
  My personal favorite is the Szcechwan beef extra extra hot and spicy. If you like spicy, get the fried rice spicy too. They are more than happy to do it.

The fake golden Chinese chandelier, faded pink blinds in the storefront window and the red-orange tables, all of these could probably be found in an antique store.  What cracks us up is that the table closest to the kitchen entrance which is full of newspapers and has practically become the owner&#39;s office over time.  All of this is probably due to the China House being owned by the same friendly, boisterous guy and his wife since they first opened doors in the &#39;80s.  

What makes China House unique is that they offer Dinner Combos for $9 and includes an entree (all the favorites like S&amp;amp;S Chicken and General Tso&#39;s Chicken), pork fried rice (I always swap it for chicken fried rice), and an egg roll.  I will warn you that the egg roll has baby shrimps and pork meat secretly wrapped inside.  For those who don&#39;t eat either of those meats, no need to worry since I read in another review that you can make it veggie.  All the food is similar to any other greasy Chinese joint but, you guessed it, at least it hasn&#39;t gotten worse after time."

The crab rangoons were small and looked like tortellinis, really! But they were delicious. I will be going back there because of these. 

The egg rolls were phenomenal. I usually end up with egg rolls that are 99% cabbage, but these had a good amount of meat in them! And they were fairly big!

I will probably not get the egg drop soup again. It tasted very watered down. 

They have great lunch specials that are also available on Saturday! I&#39;m sold. And I really want to try the orange shrimp, because I&#39;ve never seen orange shrimp before!"

There are lunch and dinner specials which are a cheap way to get a lot of food because they come with a large serving of your food plus fried rice and an egg roll.  

The inside decor is old, worn, and nothing to get excited about, but the food is tasty and the price is right.

So why so good? The food! I&#39;ve been going here since 1985 (with a little help from my parents) and not a single thing has changed. Ok, well the owner did add fake carnations in a vase to each table around 1998 but that&#39;s about it. The food has always been delicious and if you are a fan of Cantonese-style Chinese food, you won&#39;t find a better option. Chinese food is my favorite type of food, so I have been to a countless amount of restaurants, some better than others, but none which I have loved as much as China House. 
I understand you might say, &#34;Well anyone who grows up on a certain food will be partial to that food.&#34; Yes, this is true, and I am not claiming this review is not very biased. However, I have tried many other Chinese food restaurants, and have even liked some of the dishes there more than China House&#39;s, BUT... there are certain dishes at China House which I constantly crave, because they are so delicious.  
- As a previous Yelper mentioned, their crab rangoon is to die for. The crab rangoon served here is slightly different than most restaurant versions in that the wrap is thinner and crispier. For the price you pay, you get a very large amount which can easily feed a table of 4-5. 
- Their lunch specials can not be beat. They range in price from about $4.50 - $6.75, and you WILL get a great meal with plenty of leftovers.  My favorite is the #24 - Chicken Kow. I usually ask the owner to throw almonds on top, which adds a delicious crunch and flavor to the dish.
- I hate it when you order an eggroll and get this tiny little tube of wrapped up meat/veggies. China House&#39;s egg rolls are very large, and filled with pork/shrimp/veggies. The taste is delicious. I have yet to try their spring rolls though, but that is next on my list.
- I would say my absolute favorite dish here is the Hong Sue Chicken. It is somewhat a mash-up of sweet and sour chicken and chicken chow-mein. A lot of other restaurants serve you the chicken with a standard breaded, doughy batter. The batter they use here is completely different - a lot crispier and has more flavor. I don&#39;t know if this is more true to the Cantonese style, but it is very delicious. This dish comes with tons of veggies and sauce, and the $8 price will feed you very well. 
You can&#39;t beat the prices and portion sizes. There has never ever been a time I did not take a to-go box, and I am a woman who is not afraid to eat. I wouldn&#39;t say to make it a point to visit this place for the atmosphere, because, well, there really isn&#39;t much of one. This place is clean, but the decor and lighting leave much to be desired. It has a decent sized dining area, but I would definitely either take the food to go or eat inside on a day where you are just going for a casual bite to eat.  
Kim, the owner, is extremely friendly and helpful in explaining the various dishes there. He loves to read the Sun Times behind the register, and makes sure to play the River or any radio station with oldies rock. His restaurant has not changed one bit since I started going, and with good reason."
china-house-warrenville,Johnny G.,1ByswKsCK_Ca2THpqfAVRQ,"Mt Juliet, TN",0,1,0,10,31,TwvXX6mBnvpNrVnt2vQPNw,4.0,2010-01-03,"The Background:
* this review is for my very first and only visit (so far) to China House
* 1 large entree, 1 small entree, Hot/Sour soup, 2 eggrolls, and crab Rangoon for about 26 bucks total.
* I&#39;ve lived in Warrenville for 4 years and I didn&#39;t even know this place existed until I wrote a review for the East China Inn - don&#39;t confuse the two as they are very close to each other although the menu&#39;s are very similar.

The Good:
* I&#39;ll start with the crab rangoon. Oh man, they were good and the highlight of the meal. Each rangoon was wrapped in a light springroll wrap and tightly wound by hand with an outstanding balance of cream cheese and a light touch of garlic.  I would return just for the crab rangoon.
* Hot/Sour soup = some of the best I&#39;ve had in a long time. Although it was loaded with egg the soup did have a generous portion of tofu, wood ear mushrooms, scallions and just the right amount of vinegar and spice.  Although i&#39;ve had better I would rank this as pretty high on my hot/sour soup scale and again, I would return just for the hot/sour soup.
* I ordered the cashew Chicken and i&#39;m happy that it was loaded with several vegetables, lot&#39;s of cashews and white meat chicken. The chicken was a little dry but I&#39;m really not a fan of white meat chicken anyway.  
* The Singapore vermicelli shrimp was deliciously stir fried with a hint of curry and tiny noodles that came in one of the biggest to-go boxes I&#39;ve seen.  This dish alone was almost 10 bucks but the portion size was big enough to order alone for my family of 4 (including two young kids). 
* Hot food - everything arrived very fresh and hot. 
* Skill in the kitchen - I can see that there is some definite skill in the kitchen with the use of multiple ingredients and while I am desperately trying not to compare to the East China Inn just up the street I have to say that China House has much more complex ingredients and a kitchen staff to pull off the use of them.
* Did I mention the crab rangoon!  I&#39;m seriously thinking of ordering them right now just as a snack cause they were so good.
* The egg rolls were delicious with a large stuffed shell it&#39;s a good starting point for beginners. I wouldn&#39;t necessarily write home about them though on the other hand I wasn&#39;t disappointed with them.

The Bad:
* I did note a slightly off taste from old oil on both the eggroll and the rangoon but my profession has taught me to look for the bad first.  I don&#39;t think your average layman would notice.
* Location. This place has to be in one of the most awkard locations I&#39;ve seen in a while. Although it is only a few feet from IL-59 I swear I have never seen this place before even though I&#39;ve probably passed it several thousand times since I&#39;ve been here.  With that said, it&#39;s really not a bad location but if you&#39;re a first timer here you may have a difficult time finding it.  I can even imagine both East China Inn and China House getting calls from people looking for each others restaurant.  Look for the flooring place next door if you get lost.

All-in-all:
* I think I&#39;ve discovered a gem here.  And if you read my other review for the other Chinese place which I&#39;m no longer going to mention here you will know that I have traveled the globe (including Hong Kong) and I&#39;ve had some of the best Chinese food you can imagine. While China House is no 5 star experience I think that for the prices, portions, and proximity you really can&#39;t go wrong here.  I&#39;m just a little disappointed that I haven&#39;t found this place sooner because I&#39;ve given up on finding good Hot/Sour soup I think I&#39;ve found a good place for my fix."

That sounds really bad, but really, if you want Chinese food and you live in Warrenville, China House will get the job done. The staff is friendly and they always get our orders right. The food is good. I&#39;m a fan of their Chicken &amp; Broccoli and their beef fried rice is also good.

I tried the chia cookies and the gluten-free donuts.

I kind of need to RAVE about the blueberry muffin. Because amazing as a description is lacking. I know my way around a blueberry muffin. This one was the BEST I&#39;ve had anywhere. Moist and full of (seemingly fresh!) blueberries inside and the topping... omg. Was this deliciously crusty, oatmeal-y, caramelized brown sugary type topping that was SO. CRAZY. GOOD. 

I also tried the Mocha recovery blended drink... banana and peanut butter and chocolate ice cream and I don&#39;t even remember what else but ohhhhhh so good. I did skip the whipped cream, because, you know, a girl&#39;s got to draw the indulgence line SOMEWHERE. But damn. Order it. 

I also tried their berry banana smoothie of the day (just a sip) but it was delish and had I been feeling like being a bit &#34;healthier&#34; I would have gone that route. 

They have a great selection of sandwiches, gluten-free items, ice cream sundaes, etc. so we&#39;ll be back to try more. Loved this place. 

PS - their seating in an outdoor courtyard is surprisingly lovely for being located along a busy main street... lush and green and dotted with old bicycles. Fun."

Having delicious lunches available inside The Sugar Path is a natural fit, complementing both businesses by offering wonderful lunches paired with delicious desserts for afterwards.

The Mr. and I stopped here yesterday morning on our way home from a bike ride.  We each grabbed a caramel iced coffee, and the woman working made a point to tell us that she doesn&#39;t like to make it too sweet without letting the customer try it first.  I really appreciated that.  I love a good sugar buzz, but we could all use a little less go-go juice.  In addition to the coffees, he grabbed two small gluten free chia seed chocolate cookies - his reasoning being that we just biked 10 miles.  I&#39;m doing it to LOSE weight, not put it right back as soon as I&#39;m done pedaling, but who am I to turn down a cookie?  It was really, really good.  And not just, &#34;good for being gluten-free.&#34;  

While we were sucking down our coffees, she also brought over a little cup of homemade granola for us to try.  Another win!!  Not too sweet or cloying like some grocery granola, and was tender-crunchy, if that&#39;s a thing?  We left feeling perfectly re-fueled.  

The woman behind the counter was so, SO nice.  She seems to really love providing this great service.

By far the pizza you can get in the Chicagoland area. Every time I come back to visit my family living out here its the first thing I want to eat. 

Their pies are thick and their toppings plentiful so be aware that if you like your pizza on the lighter side to order your cheese/toppings light and the bread thin. Their sauce is amazing though.

As a side note this place is family owned and operated too so I enjoy being able to support a local business over a cooperate owned chain. The owner is there almost every day making the pies herself."

 The sauce was way sweet and in my opinion too watery. Definitely not thick enough. The crust was good and the pizza overall wasn&#39;t bad. It won&#39;t give papa joe&#39;s a run for their money but it&#39;ll suffice. 
 The poor boy I brought home got rave reviews. I don&#39;t eat poor boys but I heard how wonderful it was and how it was possibly better than merichka&#39;s. The wingdings were satisfying.

The PB burger is surprisingly amazing, and we were forewarned that each ingredient was strongly represented on this burger. How fun and tasty it was to experience the mingling of peanut butter, American cheese &amp; bacon. Who ever knew? The Blue Burger was amazing, especially with the addition bacon avocado + burger sauce. The Country Burger, with BBQ sauce, cheddar, onions and an onion ring was delightful as was the Breakfast Burger with a fried egg and bacon on top. Sharing the steak fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings and delicious homemade chips. Yum, yum, yum. Just writing this, I wish there was a Hamburgerseria in Chicago, or at the very least, the burbs! Sometimes, you just gotta get a burger, and this is the best place in Illinois in which to enjoy that burger at!"

Unique toppings to pick from as well. My husband always gets the breakfast burger- bacon, over hard egg, and American cheese. I always mix it up and try something new.

Sweet potato fries are decent, a bit soggy.
Husband likes the homemade chips.

The owner always seems so kind and thankful to see customers. 

One thing they should work on is cooking their bacon longer. The burger I had tonight had basically raw bacon on it(see pic). Yuck. Not sure who likes bacon like that, but I won&#39;t ever get bacon on my burger here now."

Whenever we go to burger places, he&#39;s used to making do with the pitiful vegetarian options available.  Not at this place.  Not only was my teriyaki burger AMAZING and perfectly cooked, his black bean burger was so delicious he swore that it had to have been made fresh (we found out it wasn&#39;t, but who cares when it tastes like it is?).  Definitely have to give this place props for accommodating a wide variety of palates as well as it does.

Also was impressed by the prices.  We spent a little over $20 on two gourmet half pound burgers and sides.  We left full and extremely satisfied.  Can&#39;t ask for much more- definitely look forward to coming back!"

Nice place situated in a strip mall. The waitress was an extremely helpful and polite. I think her name was Nicole and she suggested the O&#39;Hare burger.......a quarter, half or full pound burger cooked how you like it with grilled onions, portobello mushrooms, Swiss cheese and burger sauce. A side of hand cut fries seasoned to perfection and I was in a serious food coma. I got their Greek Isles salad to take to work and it was awesome too. I will be back alot of other burgers to try including the French burger with Brie and cranberry and the peanut butter burger. Try it you&#39;ll like it!"

Choices are plentiful that will cater to all types of tastes..Don&#39;t see what you want on the menu..just ask..they will make it.

There is a full dine in area or you can take out..you want a beer with your burger..you can have one as well or drink from Pepsi products..

Today I went for the Breakfast Burger..half pound ..with cheese..hard fried egg..and bacon..with a side of homemade chips..Burger came perfect..medium on a pretzel bun..I have to say I love the chips..they aren&#39;t greasy or salty...I would love for them to be warmed..hmmm maybe I&#39;ll ask next time.  

The staff if very friendly and knowledgeable about what they offer..it&#39;s not like asking for a recommendation on a burger and being told..I don&#39;t eat meat..you don&#39;t have to ask for extra napkins or wait for a drink to be refilled..

This is in strip mall and next to a subway shop..do yourself the favor ..screw calorie counting for a day..and enjoy a burger made truly your way..

Watch for daily speciality burgers..they are wrote on chalk board by hostess stand.."

I ordered the Blue Cheese Burger w/ steak fries. 

Burger: Smelled good, tasted okay. The Blue Cheese Burger came with bacon, avocado, and blue cheese. I felt they were skimpy with the toppings. The burger was also on the smaller side overall. 

Fries: Very average. Complimented the burger well but nothing special. 

I would eat here again as it was enjoyable and moderately affordable, but it&#39;s not something I would go out of my way to get."

This place is the real deal! It&#39;s a sit down restaurant. Great customer service and kick ass food. 

Went with my wife and two kids and there was more than enough space for all of us. 

These are quite possibly the best burgers in the greater Chicago area. I&#39;ve had good burgers in Chicago, but nothing comes close to these! Can&#39;t say enough. Stellar food. This will be the only burger joint I eat at from. Now on."

They have a ton of gourmet burgers and I was having a hard time deciding until I saw they had 4 sliders for 9.00.  The 4 sliders are Buffalo, Colorado, Blue, and French.  I had that and a box of sweet potato fries for 4.50.  WARNING: Too much food!!!  AND only 13.50 that could have easily have feed 2.  

The sliders each have a half inch patty that is obviously hand made.  The meat is well seasoned and would stand alone with out condiments in terms of flavor.  The order of sliders also comes with their homemade chips.  Again a crazy amount of food.  So here&#39;s my take on the 4 burgers.

Colorado:  It comes with cream cheese, bacon and jalapenos.  This was my least favorite of the 4.  The jalapenos overpowered the burner and the cream cheese just didn&#39;t taste right to me on a burger.  Not my thing

Blue: It comes with blue cheese crumbles, avacado, bacon and something they call burger sauce.  Burger sauce is some sort of mayo and ketchup mixture.  I got mine without burger sauce because I hate mayo.  The burger was really good as I could taste the meat, cheese, avacado and bacon.  None of them overpowered each other.

French: It comes with cranberries and brie cheese.  Odd but good.  The sweetness of the cranberries really stood out.  I don&#39;t think I would order this again but it was solid.

Buffalo: Buffalo sauce, onion, lettuce, and blue cheese dressing.  Who am I kidding I was so full at this point I think my taste buds shut down.  Sounds good though.


There are a ton of other options for the burgers that I&#39;m sure I will be back.  If crazy burger toppings are not your thing, try a normal one.  It&#39;s good by itself."

We were made to feel quite welcome upon our arrival, and the young lady that waited on us was outstanding!  Very pleasant, frequent check-ins during our visit, and a smile every time.

Ordered a basket of the homemade chips for our table of four, and they were very good.  Make no mistake though, this place is called &#34;Hamburgerseria&#34; for a reason: the burgers are fantastic!

Yes, they had some nice featured burgers and whatnot, but the hamburger itself is delicious!  Juicy, tasty, and cooked to perfection.  Bacon, cheese, pretzel bun - they are along for the ride.

We&#39;re all for new places especially burger joints! The boy is obsessed with a good meat disk! 

I ordered the Sliders... 4 mini burgers: Buffalo (Buffalo sauce, iceberg lettuce, onions, blue cheese dressing), Colorado (Cream cheese, jalapenos, bacon), Blue (Blue cheese, bacon avocado, burger sauce), and French (Brie Cheese, Cranberries). That seems like a lot! They were mini alright! The burgers and the toppings were pretty mini lol! There was way more dry bun than anything else! I took the top of the hard bun off and had a more even bun to ingredient ratio. We shared a basket of the waffle sweet potato fries which were better.

The boy had the Breakfast Burger... American cheese, hard fried egg, bacon. He said his burger was much better. My assumption is that it was due to the size. He ordered the 1/2# (other options were 1/4 or 1#). Mine were more like bottle caps! His burger was cooked the way he likes it (mid-rare). He wasn&#39;t impressed with the bun either. His was dry and hard too.

This place is listed as fast food; however, we had a waiter... I clingy waiter! It was rather busy the Saturday that we went and yet this kid had nothing better to do but hover over us the whole time! We understood that our food was going to take a while, but he just kept telling us about it. When we finally got our food he kept coming by to ask how it was. For the love of dinner time, let us eat! The whole experience was just odd! I&#39;m not sure that we&#39;ll be back. It was an interesting place to try out, but nothing special at all about it!"

The reviews have been great and many of my friends have recommended this place. But I don&#39;t know what I am missing here. I didn&#39;t find anything that was worth going back for. 
This place is suffering from an identity crisis, it is advertised as coffee, hamburger, and sweets. My wife ordered the coffee and it really wasn&#39;t that good, it was weak. Now every restaurant has coffee but not all of them advertise it. If you are going to say your a coffee place you better have some good coffee. The same goes for the &#39;Sweets&#39; they advertise as sweets and we didn&#39;t see anything on the menu and your waitress didn&#39;t mention anything to us about desserts or sweets..... So I guess this is just a burger place. 

Regarding the burgers. I went there with my family and we ordered 5 burgers. We got a mix of the everything. From a basic burger to the weekly special. I did enjoy the variety of burger they had. What is the deal with the buns? I guess they offer a choice between pretzel bun (humm!!) or gourmet bun (what makes it a gourmet bun, I have no idea), however you only have a choice if you get the half pound burgers, the other size burgers just get a gourmet bun. What is that about? They should be able to offer the different buns for all there burgers. 

The burgers meat has a good flavor --- I asked for mine as rare as they can serve it and I got it as well as they can serve it. However I will say that when I mentioned it, they immediately said they were very sorry and made me a new one to take home. That was great service for them to do that. Thank you for that. 
But as a whole burger it wasn&#39;t that great. Again, maybe I caught them on a bad day or something. I found them rather dry and ratio of bun, burgers, and condiments, were off or something. 

I understand that this is a new place and they are growing rather quickly, which is a good thing. I like local business to stay strong and strive. I think with some adjustments and some figure out their identity they should be good."

This place offers some of the most unique twists and variations on the old hamburger that i have seen.  You can be as adventurous or boring as you choose.

Lots of options on the menu, mainly burgers of course, but also had salads and paninis.

1/4lb burgers start at $5 and go up to about $7 or 8 I believe. The meat was not anything special, but it wasn&#39;t bad either. The bread for my burger was kind of stale tho. At first I thought it was maybe toasted but it did not appear as if it was. They should definitely get better buns/bread because I think that would actually make them gourmet. 

Steak fries are $2.50 for a large portion that is definitely shareable. They also have sweet potato fries I want to try out.

Wasn&#39;t aware there was a large dine in area also. I will def come back to try out other options, like the Italian beef"

I was in the mood for a hamburger while hanging out in Joliet so I looked up burger joints.  Low and behold I find this little gem!  It&#39;s in a low profile strip mall so you might miss it if you&#39;re not paying attention!  When you get in you can order at the counter or sit down and order.  The floor plan is huge and very open, I hope they get busy enough to fill this place up sometimes.

I was in heaven looking over the menu options of interesting burger toppings.  I settled on one that had bacon and peanut butter.  I&#39;m glad I did because holy cow was it delicious!! My grandpa used to put pb on everything growing up so I immediately thought of him.  I also got sweet potato fries with it which rounded out my sweet and salty flavor profile for the day.  They had a lot of soda options too, canned or fountain which I&#39;m always a fan of.

When I see places like this I always wish the best for them because I like what they&#39;re doing.  But sometimes I worry about their brand placement.  I cross my fingers that jolietians make the trip out to all of their little hole-in-the-wall diamonds.  I think one of the great things about that area is a lot of the really cool restaurants are small businesses.  If I had a note to the owners I would suggest spending a little more time on their website, it&#39;s low budget looking, which can be okay, but it&#39;s a little &#34;too&#34; LB.  Stay on top of your social media, because that&#39;s the way to grow a fun brand like yours!


Bottom line check out Hamburgerseria! I will be back in Joilet next month and I&#39;m hoping to stop by again to try a different burger!"

(Not a pico no lime) lettuce with cheese. It was AWESOME.  I asked for medium and cooked perfectly. Steak fries nicely done. Young man that was my server provided excellent service. (Picture is this burger.)
Couldn&#39;t wait to take my daughter so went back few days later and I ordered the Teriyaki burger. Has teriyaki sauce, cheddar cheese onions and grilled pineapple. Well this grilled pineapple was the reason for the loss of 1 star. I was looking forward to a slice of fresh grilled pineapple. But alas it was 2 slices of CANNED pineapple. Big disappointment. Canned pineapple is so water logged it doesn&#39;t grill just warms up. It made the whole bun so wet it couldn&#39;t be picked up. I ended up just eating the hamburger with a fork because the thing was a total mess. 
I will definitely be back- its a great burger. Just not for the teriyaki burger."

One weekday evening I was craving a delicious burger, and read about this place on Yelp.  Since almost all of the reviews were positive, I decided to give Hamburgerseria a try.  I kept eyeing the Greek burger, so I got the 1/4 pound Greek burger with sweet potato fries.  The burger was wonderful.  They put olives, a block of feta cheese, onion, tomato, lettuce, and a special sauce on the burger.  The bun was toasted. Perfect burger, and the 1/4 pound was more than enough, especially since I got the sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries appear to be hand cut, and they were some of the best sweet potato fries I&#39;ve ever had. The fries were only $1.50 and they give you more than enough of them.  This meal left me stuffed and happy : ) . I look forward to trying their Italian burger next time, since that one also sounded delicious to me"

Place is really nice from the inside. Super clean and smiling faces everywhere. As others have mentioned it definitely plays a mix of songs and I enjoyed what I heard. Couple tvs to watch the game because come on it&#39;s illinois and we gotta.

Service was great. She was polite, answered questions, offered substitutes for pickier eaters and was there whenever we needed her.

Food is a step up from standard burger place. A lot of these niche hamburger places are coming up nowadays and this one was pretty much the same I&#39;ve been to before. Couple odd burgers (peanut butter or cream cheese on it) couple restaurant &#34;fancy&#34; (bbq  sauce and onion ring or teriyaki with pineapple. Just like the major chains have) and then basic burger without frills. 

Food was good. It&#39;s not frozen meat so that&#39;s to be appreciated. Fries were hot and crispy, soda was cold, and if I had to go back I&#39;d probably get the house chips. We ordered a starter of house chops either cheese and bacon and it was quite good. 

My 2 minor gripes are

1) this result was listed as kid friendly. And while I think the staff and atmosphere definitely are, there is no kids menu. The smallest portion was too big for my oldest son. And it&#39;s either a hot dog or hamburger. Thankfully mine eat that but I know there are picky kids out there so be mindful of that. 

2) sides are extra. Maybe I&#39;ve been spoiled mostly but when I get a burger at any restaurant I generally expect a choice of a side which is usually fries. However sides here are several dollars extra. They&#39;re good steak fries but for paying nearly $9 for an burger I wasn&#39;t ready for the additional cost of fries. Minor gripe like I said. 

Overall this is the type of place I was happy to eat at once, maybe recommend to others, but I wouldn&#39;t see myself going back repeatedly."

There are food items I like and those I don&#39;t care for.  Service has always been excellent. The gourmet bun option sucks, and the pretzel bun is what I&#39;ve settled on.  They really need to get another bun supplier to replace what they call a gourmet bun.  I&#39;d prefer Wonder Bread.  The half pound burger is generally cooked the way I&#39;ve specified and the meat is good.  Along with the burger I get the steak fries which are a good pick.  I&#39;ve tried the chips and they haven&#39;t impressed me and I feel they are overpriced.  The chocolate shake is the typical shake which isn&#39;t very chocolate.  My idea of a chocolate shake is one made with chocolate ice cream, not vanilla with a tablespoon of sauce.  I won&#39;t order it again.  I do have doubts as to whether the half pound burger is half a pound.  Prices are fair.  Overall my visits have been very positive.

My only complaint...and I hate to call it that but I have to note it. The waitress was great, super friendly, everything was correct and timely. But she kept touching my son every time she came by. Not just a tap on the shoulder or a quick little pinch of the cheeks. Her hand all over his face, by his mouth, every time for long periods of time (long for a stranger to be touching your kid). I tried to ignore it but I couldn&#39;t help but think if she&#39;s this Feely McFeelerson with my kid what/who else is she like that with? He could&#39;ve had a cold and she&#39;s all over his face then touching people&#39;s plates, money, other surfaces, sick people, then coming back to touch his face? It was odd. I even asked my friend if I was just being sensitive and she said no it was weird. I just sat him on my lap in the booth and she stopped. I could&#39;ve said something to her but she was so sweet I didn&#39;t want to make her feel bad. Maybe I should&#39;ve? I don&#39;t know but they have steak fries so I&#39;ll be back."

I ordered the bruschetta with fresh mozzarella and tomatoes for my appetizer. And when I say fresh, I mean it. The cheese was the highlight for sure.

For my entree, I ordered the O&#39;Hare burger with grilled onions and portobello mushrooms with a side of steak fries. It took a good 20-25 minutes for the food to come out, but it was more than worth the wait. The fries were average but the burgers were out of this world. Why does it take so long you ask? Because it&#39;s the definition of made-to-order..incredibly fresh.

I highly recommend stopping here. And bring someone to share the fries with!"

My boyfriend and I love coming here for burgers and their STEAK FRIES! We can never find any steak fries in the area, so when we can, we come here just to get our fix. They&#39;re offering waffle fries at the moment for some reason, but hey, I&#39;ll take them any day if it means I don&#39;t have to go all the way to Chick-Fil-A! 

I get the 1/2 O&#39;hare burger with steak fries and extra burger sauce on the side (I love dipping it in the sauce!), and then my boyfriend gets the 1/2 Teriyaki Burger with onion rings and ranch. They&#39;re willing to make any adjustments you want, and they also will let you build your own burger if you want! The hot dogs are 100% ANGUS BEEF! So don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re keeping it kosher, because these are all beef! We love the food, you can tell how great the quality the food is with every single bite! A great amount of food is put in front of you, and i always need a box at the end of the meal! 

The waitresses are very friendly and the owner loves to come by and talk to us about our meal and learn our interests!  

My favorite dessert is the cheesecake, they offer with a strawberry topping, but here&#39;s a secret, they&#39;ll do anything you ask! Try the cheesecake with the cranberry sauce, the tart and sweetness from the cranberry sauce is so good. 

We&#39;ve become regulars at this place, it&#39;s delicious, and great quality. If you want amazing food, come here!"

Meh:
-Servers are hit or miss.  When you get a good one you know it and when you get a clueless one you just want to do their job for them.

It was not fun to listen to Blackhawks fans shouting to the staff to put the sound back on for ten minutes.

Especially when they were told that the staff was too busy to do it, wouldn&#39;t do it, or couldn&#39;t.

Really? Why set up that big screen for the game if you can&#39;t be bothered to keep it on when an entire bar full of Blackhawks fans is watching?

In addition, two of our orders came out wrong.

So we walked across the street and tried this place out! I really think we should have seen this place before. I don&#39;t know how we&#39;ve missed it!

The boy ordered the Road House Chips as they were having a special that night. I felt like the homemade chips were a little on the well done side, but he likes them that way. You can&#39;t really go wrong with homemade chips topped with cheddar cheese, bacon, scallions, and bacon!

I had the Grilled Caprese Chicken sammich made into a wrap. It wasn&#39;t too bad. The chicken could have used a little seasoning like salt and pepper while it was grilled since it was frozen and thawed. The balsamic gave the wrap a nice flavor.

The bartender we got was a little more focused on her &#34;regular&#34; customers which was too bad. One of the other girls was totally cool though. She stopped over and talked to us several times. I sorta wish we could have given our tip to her since she actually spoke to us.

We sat down in a booth by the window, it was pretty quiet inside, just a few patrons by the bar. The service was quick and the bartender/server recommended the burgers- we each had one on pretzel buns with various toppings. They were cooked a perfect medium well. The toppings were fresh and the whole burger was just great-
on par, if not better, than some of the best burgers I have had up in Chicago which is where I live. 

I had tator-tots as my side and they were perfect- crispy and golden brown. Other sides were onions rings and regular fries- both got rave reviews from my family :)

Then we ordered three burgers, cheese pizza, and a chicken wrap. Long wait for the food. My burger came uncooked and still cold. Everything else was cooked well. When my burger came back after the second try it was on new plate without the fries or other sides. They ran out! The bill came in at $76 for basic restaurant staples. Portions were not gourmet either. I will try them again. Maybe just an off night."

I travel far to come hangout at this place b/c the staff are awesome (once they get to know you). The food is the typical bar food but I am a little bum that they took away my favorite dipping sauce for my chicken fingers.  The drinks are your standard drinks. It&#39;s a great place to hangout with friends and family. You have to go on Tuesday or Friday nights and meet the awesome bartender (Christa)...she&#39;s the BEST!

That beautiful large fish filet on a baguette is now a couple of filet-o-fish squares perched on bread chunks. Gone also is the homemade tartar sauce. It is still a tasty sandwich -- but not the same. Wish they could have raised the price rather than switching to the current fish sandwich incarnation . . . it was a reason for going to the Uptown.

There was like a 2:1 guy/girl ratio, and that might even be pushing it. I kind of liked this place, on a Friday night, it never got too crowded, like every single place in downtown Naperville. That was pretty refreshing. They had a jukebox that you could put your money into and almost immediately hear your song (a buck a song, however). And the most joyously fantabulous part is that they had $3 Captain drinks on a Friday night. So me and my friend got nice and ripped for under thirty bucks.

This wasn&#39;t the worst place we&#39;ve gone for breakfast, but it was far from egg&#39;ceptional.

My husband was happy to find they have huge coffee mugs but he was disappointed when they weren&#39;t filled up all the way. I ordered tea and went most of the meal without a hot water refill, which was also a bit disappointing.

I wanted something savory and something sweet, so we both got our own entrée and split the Pumpkin French Toast for dessert. I was asked if I&#39;d like the Baked French Onion Soup I added on to come out before the meal and said I would, but it ended up being served at the same time and sat around getting cold. Why even ask then?

I had the Way South Benedict that comes with chorizo, avocado, and chipotle hollandaise. Overall, it had a good flavor, but they should consider calling it the Way Salty. My husband got the Hey Ricky omelette and asked for some extra ingredients to be added and wanted his hash browns extra crispy. Some ingredients were skipped and the hash browns were far from crispy. I was just glad they let me substitute the Spanish rice for hash browns.

The Pumpkin French Toast was a bummer. He ate one slice. I picked at part of a slice and we took the rest home. And speaking of taking it home, I was still working on my soup when 3 people stopped by to try and take our plates before we finished. When we finally were ready for a box, there was no one to be found."

Egglectic is very busy on the weekends, especially during prime hours, so that&#39;s something to remember when you&#39;re considering where to go. It&#39;s decently sized, however there&#39;s typically a wait anywhere from 10minutes to an hour. We showed up at 10am on a Saturday, a very busy time, and were told the wait would be 15-25 minutes for two people, so decided to wait. They share a hallway inside Town Square, so it&#39;s nice to not have to be outside in the winter. We had no problem waiting, especially since it was just the two of us, we thought it would move quickly. However, it turned into 50minutes before we asked where we were on the list, and it was like the lady completely forgot about us. There were several two tops that were under us on the list that had been crossed out and she seemed startled and sat us right away. It was clear that we were skipped. Not a good start.

Once we were sat, we were greeted by a very friendly waitress. To be honest, she seemed a little overwhelmed, so I&#39;m not sure if she was just really busy or maybe she was new. Once she got us drinks, she sort of disappeared for awhile. 

I&#39;ve been there twice and both times I got the Belgium Waffle. It comes as one huge waffle, with maple syrup and powdered sugar, of course. The waffle is delicious and filling. I thought it would be two waffles when I ordered the first time, but now I understand why they only do one. There&#39;s absolutely no need for another and I promise, unless you&#39;re a professional eater, you&#39;ll be full after this. 

On both occasions, once we were finished, it took way too long to be checked on and get our bill. Again, not sure if the servers were super busy or what, however the second time I was there, it was much less crowded. Once you get the bill, you pay at the front desk. I usually like this style, however their front area is super crowded and just have one tiny desk to pay at, so it can be very hectic up there. 

Overall, I think Egglectic is an OK option in the Wheaton area. There are others that I would put above it without hesitation. They could certainly improve their overall service. Maybe that means hiring more help when it&#39;s really busy, or providing additional training for the waitstaff, who knows, but it definitely seems like they&#39;re lacking in that department."

Not 10 minutes later we were shown to our booth. It got better from there.

Their menu is extensive and quite accommodating to various dietary restrictions. I have never had a bad meal-- and I&#39;ve tried a good chunk of their menu. Whenever I go with the BFF or my BF, we always order their Nutella crepes to share---- the prices are cheap enough that a third shared entree can be justified ;)

Coffee is amazing. I wish they serve their coffee creamers in those cute mini pitchers instead of the individual serving tubs. It adds to the experience. Service is consistently good... my coffee/waters are refilled in a timely manner and food comes out with minimal waiting. 

I&#39;m never blown away so I do agree that this isn&#39;t the place to impress out of town guests. The ambience is like a rich man&#39;s IHOP-- casual, clean, pseudo farm/diner vibes. Many people can probably make the food here at home. But for lazy people like me, it&#39;s the place to go for dependably decent brunch experience and amazing bottomless coffee. It&#39;s also well situated in Town Square Wheaton (like an upscale strip mall) with a couple of shops (Francesca&#39;s, Gap, Victoria&#39;s Secret, Express, Papyrus, Bath &amp; Body Works) to browse in to make a morning/afternoon of it :)"

There&#39;s some ridiculously good breakfast choices here. And by ridiculous, I mean diabetes inducing. The banana bread French toast comes to mind. The euphoria you experience after may just be hyperglycemia Drizzled with bananas and kiwi sauce, it should come with an insulin injector.

Some of the booths are super comfy, some are kind of picnic bench-y in nature. Why is this a thing? Picnic benches are things people sit on when outdoors, because they&#39;re better than the ground. When indoors, we shouldn&#39;t have the &#34;thing that&#39;s better than the ground&#34; as an option. Maybe I&#39;m just old and ornery. Anyway...

I like the food here - the menu seems to make reference to some of the other brunch places in the area - I don&#39;t know how that works, are you all allowed to call your omelette the &#34;hey tony!&#34; or whatever the hell else clever names someone at one time came up with? But anyway, it has a very familiar feel to it. The eggs are always a little greasy, but other than that I have enjoyed everything I&#39;ve gotten.  Prices are standard, service is standard, coffee is standard... you know. A-OK.

If you&#39;re in the area and willing to deal with the dreaded Danada circle of doom, Egglectic is a nice place to brunch. I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way for it, though."

This is my wife&#39;s favorite breakfast place, and my second favorite. I like my omelets tall, my coffee hot, and my flavors bold. Egglectic cafe consistently delivers on each of those at a decent price, and with great service to boot.

My favorite omelet here is one of the farmstand ones, which is generally spinach, tomatoes, cheese and something else. I&#39;ve also had the California omelet. 

The quality is consistently good, whether it be the tangy buttermilk pancakes, crunchy hash browns, or every once in a rare while, grits. They also serve some fresh juices here, which aren&#39;t that bad.

Overall Egglectic Cafe won&#39;t blow you away, but they consistently deliver quality on each of their menu items, and sometimes that&#39;s just what you&#39;re looking for in a breakfast place."

The seating has been rearranged since it was Egg Harbor and is much more welcoming.  There is a mural on the wall straight ahead when you walk in, and it  is a very calming scene.  The hostess station is now on the left as you walk in. And they got rid of that annoying elevated area so everything is now one level.  What was that all about Egg Harbor?

On to the food.  I had an omelette that arrived looking like a burrito suizo that I have eaten at a Mexican place.  Unusual but tasty.  My husband&#39;s eggs were done just right and we both agree we would return.

Booth could be a little comfier (even my kid said they were hard to sit on...they need padded backs).

My son ordered from kid&#39;s menu...he got the cheese quesadilla with chips.  Beverage not included (I hate that), so $2.25 was added for chocolate milk.
It was good, kid liked it....came with enough to bring home leftovers.

I ordered the 1/2 sandwich, 1/2 soup lunch deal.  Normally $7.99 but I upgraded to the lobster sandwich and paid $8.99.  The 1/2 sandwich was just enough for me because they stuffed it good!  It had lobster salad, tomato, cheddar cheese and avocado between two pieces of toast. Pretty decent for a brunch restaurant that closes at 3 daily. I even asked the waitress if the lobster was real!  She assured me it was.

I chose the stuffed green pepper soup to go along with my sandwich; it was tasty!  Decent sized chunks of green pepper and tomato were bathed in a tomato broth full of rice and ground beef.
My mom makes stuffed peppers and I love them...this was the liquid version I guess. LOL
I also had the choice of fries, potato pancakes, onion straws or fruit.  I picked potato pancakes and they were dry....won&#39;t go that route again.  I&#39;m Polish and picky about potato pancakes. (Say that 3x fast!)

All-in-all, a decent meal for $17.  I&#39;d go back."

On any given day, Egglectic is busy. Happily, they are able to move people quickly and the wait is never horrible. When we came on Sunday morning - around 11 - we only had to wait for about 10-15 minutes. There was even complimentary coffee (what a genius idea!) for us while we waited. 

Service is fast and friendly, and the food is good enough to justify the major caloric splurge. It should be noted that you might want to avoid this place if, say, you are looking to lose a few pounds. Portions are of epic proportions, and whether you opt for sweet or savory, you are going to leave happy, but very, very stuffed.

The water-boy kept our whistles wet and we already had enough coffee to keep us wired until our Sunday afternoon nap, so there wasn&#39;t much left for our server to do but take our order and serve it up.  I went with a combo, Strawberry-Banana Crepes and Eggs sunny-side-up.  I was pretty surprised I got BOTH bacon AND sausage.  The food came out fast, our server disappeared just as quickly...we didn&#39;t see her again until the bill miraculously appeared.  My eggs were a little boogery, the crepes were okay.  It felt like Denny&#39;s but without the All America heart attack feel.

It all happened so fast, it was all just a blur, it was all but memorable."

As you might expect egg dishes are their specialty by their name. Having previously reviewed not just another Egg&#39;lectic Cafe location, but one in the same municipality I wouldn&#39;t normally think it to be a wise decision to review a second one unless there was a big difference in the quality of my meal. Well, this was the case.

This particular Egg&#39;lectic Cafe is located in the Town Square shopping center in Wheaton. When I reviewed the one in downtown Wheaton I had originally traveled to this location, only for it not to be open at the 6:00 AM time listed on the door. On this visit I came an hour later and they were in fact open.

I walked in and was quickly seated, placed my order and in around 10 minutes my food was ready. I ordered a skilet here. The good news is the eggs were well cooked, the bad news is everything else about the skillet was a bit bland. The meat was stringy and not so tasty. The hash browns were crisp but not particularly great tasting. This was just very bland, especially in comparison to the downtown Wheaton location. On the plus side the pancakes that came with the skillet were decent.

Overall I had a much better experience at the Downtown Wheaton location and would recommend skipping the town square Egg&#39;lectic Cafe and heading to the other side of town to that one if you&#39;re really interested in trying it out. Two stars for this one."

Sometimes the food is good, and other times it is a miss. Never have I left saying, &#39;WOW that was awesome!&#34; Why I go back so much, I am not too sure. 

This last time that I went I was especially hungry. It was around noon on a Sunday, so I expected a bit of a wait. That&#39;s fair. We put our name in after being told it would be a quick ten minute wait.

Now, I don&#39;t mind waiting for a good meal, but if you tell me ten minutes, it best not be more than twenty. When my blood sugar gets low, I start to feel sick and weak and sometimes it can last all day. If the wait is going to be long, please just let me know so I can avoid passing out in the lobby. 

We sat around thirty minutes later. The waitress was busy but very kind. She took our order and kept our coffee full and hot. Food came out within fifteen minutes, but it was clear the kitchen was in a rush to push food out. It was not so good and far too greasy. I had some kind of Tuscan Skillet. I expected it to be a little greasy and a little crispy like the time before. Nothing could be crispy with a pool of oil. Bummer. This time may have been my last."

It&#39;s your typical breakfast place. You get a ton of variety here, ranging from heart attack inducing cinnamon rolls to heart healthy oatmeal and omelets. If you&#39;re looking to appease a large group, this place should do the trick. 

Occasionally you&#39;ll find that the service can be hit or miss. Many times I&#39;ve been there, the service is outstanding. Other times the service has been slow and a bit subpar. For example, we&#39;ve had to ask multiple times for a condiment that never comes. Another time, only 1 of us ordered coffee but our waitress brought us two and charged us for both. Nothing earth-shattering. I&#39;d say 50% of the time the service is good. Either way, the food is worth it."

I&#39;ve dined at the Town Sq and downtown Wheaton locations. Egg Harbor used to occupy the Town Square space that now houses Egglectic. I&#39;m not going to lie - I was super disappointed that Egg Harbor moved (even if it was less than 10 minutes away). While Egglectic is a decent breakfast place, it&#39;s just not the same as Egg Harbor. 

On my last visit I had the Classic Benedict. It was pretty good but not the best I&#39;ve ever had. The canadian bacon was a nice thick slice and the english muffin held up to the weight of it, the poached egg and hollandaise. This was accompanied by a side of potatoes and fresh fruit. Eggclectic also offers a variety of fruit juices - strawberry oj was my beverage of choice that Sunday morning.

It&#39;s always hustling &amp; bustling in here...especially on Sunday mornings...get there early to put your name on the list otherwise you might be in for a long wait. 

I&#39;ve always been satisfied with the breakfast orders here although my bff and I lunched here once and were both pretty underwhelmed. I&#39;ll be sticking to breakfast only but more than likely I will just travel an extra 10 minutes to Egg Harbor in downtown Wheaton."

(30-35 min wait at 9:30am!).  Egglectic was a wonderful surprise. I didn&#39;t have high hopes considering that it was inside of a mall.

I ordered the California Omelet. It was fan-flipping-tastic. Avocado, tomato, green onions, cheese and sour cream. I added some hot sauce and OMG it was amazing. My other half had the Tuscany omelet and he too raved about it. 

The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because the bathroom situation was a little sketch. Maybe they have on inside of the restaurant, but the only one I found was in the mall. And it was not so clean...and had no toilet paper! Thumbs down to that. But because of the food ad everything else, I am definitely coming back to this place!"

Egglectic Cafe is right by his work, and his work has an incentive program that his bosses made up for this restaurant.  I guess if they meet their goals, they earn themselves a pancake lunch on the bosses.  Pretty cool if you ask me! 

I personally think it&#39;s just an excuse for his boss to get a pancake lunch at Egglectic ;)

That being said, I don&#39;t blame them.  The food is delicious!!  I ordered the veggie omelet with has browns and a side of pancakes.  My daughter and son split the french toast, and my husband got what he always does--the banana bread french toast. 

He orders this wherever he sees it on a menu, and he said that nobody does it as well as Egglectic.  So high praise for that!!

The french toast (shhh, I snuck a couple bites...slices...) was pretty standard.  Our waitress added on some bananas and strawberries, so that was pretty sweet.

My omelet was just OK...pretty standard.  My potatoes were burnt and gross.  That was the big disappointment of the meal.  Crispy, I like.  Burnt is just gross.  However, my pancakes were light and fluffy!

The service was fantastic, too!  We arrived at 9:30 on a Sunday and were seated about 5 minutes before our 10 minute quoted time, so that was pretty awesome!  Our waitress was really nice and sweet.  I really liked her attitude and she was quick and great with the kids.

The back entrance (away from the Circle) has more parking and you can park closer to the door if you need to drop people off.

Two of the people ordered the Spanish frittata, which was recommended from previous meals.  I had the corned beef hash skillet but substituted the potatoes with cheese grits.  I think only 3 of us didn&#39;t have leftovers.  The orange and grapefruit juices are freshly squeezed and the smalls are pretty decent size (10-12 oz.).

Although it started off as I expected, it surprisingly got better and better. I&#39;m not sure why the Danada Location is so much better, in terms of hot food, service and cleanliness, but I have a feeling that the manager has a lot to do with it.  I see her constantly walking from table to table asking how their meal and service is/was. She is always making people feel welcome and tried hard to get to know the customers by the first names...and she actually remember them when they return!

I also find the servers to be very friendly and work very hard to make sure that you are happy. I frequently have 4 to 5 in my group that will dine there but on occasion when relatives are in town, we can have up to 15 or so. The service is still just as good as it is with 4 or 5 people. They don&#39;t freak out like most places with large tables! I honestly feel comfortable showing up (calling ahead for a heads up) with a large group and know that my guests will be impressed.

The food is top notch. They have gluten free pancakes and muffins. And the raspberry tea is my favorite!  They have a frequent diner&#39;s card which we take advantage of. Best EVER breakfast spot!

It was nice that we had no wait, and were seated right away. 
Love the decor and atmosphere, very warm and welcoming.
The only issue I had with this place was the staff. Service was attentive and everything in that perspective was great....but they were cold personality wise. Everyone from the host that sat us, to the buss-boy that gave us water, to the server, and the manager that cleared our table.... not one smile. As each person gave us something (sat us at the table, gave us a drink, our food, cleared our plates) my boyfriend and I made it a point to say thank you to each person -- as a well mannered person should. Call me weird, but i found it weird that NO ONE, NOT ONCE ever said &#34;your welcome&#34;.  Very odd in my opinion.
Our food was good, and the overall experience was as well. But the staff really needs to work on being more customer-friendly."

They have some of the best eclectic and standard breakfast fare around.  I get their California Crepes.  With the poppy seed dressing, it is truly awesome.  The coffee is excellent.  The wait staff is phenomenal  and we&#39;ve never had a bad experience there. We find the best times to go are around 10 am on Saturday and before 11 am on Sunday.  If you love chirizo, try their Hey Ricky omelet.  Their cinnamon raisin French toast is to die for and their sausage is huge jumbo links of goodness.  Did I say the wait staff was friendly yet?  :)  Very pleasant experience.  Highly recommend."

My ginger and I come here occasionally when the equally decent place near us starts to get a little boring. I haven&#39;t tried a lot of the menu, sticking mainly to breakfast items and usually the pulled pork omelet which is pretty good. There isn&#39;t much to say about this place. Service is friendly enough, the food is good but not spectacular, but its decent spot if you&#39;re 15 minutes or less away."

I think the food is just ok.  Definitely nothing special--I think it&#39;s standard breakfast food, and lunch is just ok, too.  I also think that it&#39;s pretty pricey for the quality, though, yes, as Angela H. mentioned, you can almost always find a coupon for it.

Service is usually good.  However, on our last visit, I went to pay at the counter with a credit card.  The woman working at the front handed it back to me and said that their card machine was down.  She offered me the following options--pay cash, pay with a check, or give her my credit card, let her copy down my credit card number, and charge my card later when the machine was back up.  Now, I&#39;ve never run into a situation like this before, so I don&#39;t know what&#39;s considered standard or reasonable.  However, I did not have cash and was not comfortable leaving my credit card number with her.  The woman just sort of shrugged and stared at me and told me that there was an ATM in the hallway.  I just thought that the whole situation was weird, and would have preferred that they let us know that their machine was down when we first sat down (the girl said that the machine had been down for awhile, so I don&#39;t think this is an unreasonable request).  I don&#39;t know, the whole thing just left a sour taste in my mouth.  Lucky for me, I was dining with my mom, who had cash and bailed me out (almost 27 years old, getting married in 2 weeks, but, as always, Mom saves the day!).

I&#39;m definitely sticking to Egg Harbor from now on."

I ordered the Wildcat Scrambler, which was a special for the month of May. The only downside to ordering a special is that they won&#39;t allow substitutions of any kind. Regardless, my meal was fresh, spicy, and delicious. The portions are huge, and I had to will myself to stop eating even though I was full halfway through. The coffee was also quite good. I was surprised to see how busy it was on a weekday morning; I&#39;m sure the wait is long on the weekends. My husband and I will definitely be back, and we&#39;ll be sure to bring out-of-town guests the next time that we have visitors!"

We drove down this downtown area in Wheaton looking for a place to eat (unable to decide if we wanted breakfast or lunch).  After deciding we would just park and walk and find a place, we spotted this cafe.  We were glad to find a nice table outside and were immediately greeted by the waitress.  She was very friendly and warm in her demeanor :) I had the lobster salad sandwich, which wasn&#39;t the absolute best... too sweet or something.  But my boyfriend and friend/realtor had an  omelette and French toast and loved it!  We then had a loud crane truck pull up next to us, and the waitress was so apologetic.  This amused me because clearly there was nothing they could do about it, but they were getting a new AC unit... which can be quite rewarding in a kitchen.  I was actually happy for them lol.  We had a great experience and next  time I&#39;m in Wheaton, I&#39;m going to eat here!"

The breakfast items are very standard-fare... great variety of pancakes, omlettes, waffles, skillets, etc. They have lunch items such as sandwiches, salads, etc. Overall I was very satisfied with my meal, the portion sizes are large and filling. The food itself was very tasty and fresh. 

I was in a group of three and they were more than happy to split the check for each of us. The wait staff was extra friendly and pleasant. 

Overall there is nothing I can find wrong with this neat breakfast restaurant.... perfect for when you get the craving for some traditional American breakfast foods. 

Do go to the website, there is a handy 10% off coupon that can be applied for the entire meal! :)"

This went over really well in my book because I know a few places that have turned me away with so little time left before they closed.  

I was in the mood for French Toast, hash browns and bacon (not typical, but on this occasion much sought after).  I was all set to purchase these items separately when I discovered their monthly specials - one of them that just happened to be French Toast, hash browns, two eggs any style, sausage and bacon.  All this for about $3 less than if I had gone with my original plan.  The food hit the spot!  I asked for my hash browns and bacon extra crispy and they accommodated my request without any problem.  I will say the bacon was a little too crispy, but the hash browns were just perfect.

The service was also good as well.  Yes, we were the only ones there aside from another table, but I&#39;ve come to learn that doesn&#39;t guarantee good service.

Overall, a very good experience and I would be happy to come back to this Egglectic Cafe location again."

I usually go to Butterfields But I wanted to switch it up today and try something different. I work in the restaurant Industry and I am usually very understanding of getting busy and being in the weeds as they call it. But the way I was treated as a guest here I will not be returning. Peggy was our waitress and when she came up to the table I had a couple questions because I am gluten free. She made me feel that I was more of a hassle than anything and when I asked her questions she needed to go ask someone instead of knowing. While we were sitting there waiting for our food my water was gone and so was my boyfriends who was with me. We sipped on our juice. The next time she returned to our table was with our food. She saw that we needed more water and juice but didn&#39;t ask or return with any. My pancakes were chewy and my eggs felt like rubber. I was so hungry so I just ate some of my pancakes. My boyfriends pancakes were hard and stuck together and his potatoes were burnt. We tried to find her but we could not until the Busser saw that something was wrong and finally went to go find her but with no luck either. She finally came back and still with no water. .Took the pancakes away to have them remade. Still walking around seeing if everyone else was okay and still not checking on us or getting us water. The manager even walked by and didn&#39;t ask if we wanted anything or saw that anything was wrong. We finally had to ask someone else for water. She finally returned with more pancakes. And then after than when we were finished she never came over with our check after asking if we were done. She passed us about 6 times before we finally got up and going to the front desk. We went up and the manager and the front desk were talking and didn&#39;t even stop talking to take care of me. The front desk lady was rude and not understanding. I left very upset and felt that because I am 22 I don&#39;t get the same service that all the families got. I will not be returning here. And if anyone is a fan of Butterfields do not even try and come to this place.

Extensive menus excite me, so 1 star off the bat for that! At first I was reluctant to eat here... there was a ton of people waiting to be seated on a Sunday AM and the hostess told several different parties that the wait was &#34;only 20 min&#34;. I thought that was nearly impossible but lo and behold she seated us in 20! I ordered the cinnamon raisin french toast and for the price, the portions were generous, and of quality: thick cuts of bacon and real sausage (not the freezer stuff used at dennys, etc). My sister had the pumpkin cake french toast, which she says was kinda sweet but still delish. The staff was friendly and kept my coffee cup full. A good breakfast experience all around... and looking forward to their other unique breakfast selections. The price can&#39;t be beat... The first 5 star I&#39;ve given!"

I went here over the weekend with a party of two. To start with the hostess quoted us a 20 minute wait. Apparently she was halving the wait times though since our real wait was about 40 minutes. After after 25 minutes I went to go ask the hostess how much longer the wait would be since we were debating just leaving and she just pointed at my name on the list. No mention of how much longer the wait would be though. 

When we finally got sat we had another bit of a wait before our waitress came by. We decided on our breakfasts and drinks and placed the order as soon as she came. The drinks (and food) did come out quickly which was about the only plus for this restaurant. I had a fritata which was good, nothing special though and an English muffin. The English muffin came out without butter. We waited for the waitress to come back, but she never showed. We finally had to flag her down and ask her for the butter, but by the time she bothered to bring it the English muffin was cold and quite disgusting. I actually had to spit it out, which is something I never do. Never fear though, the fabulous (ha ha) waitress boxed up the spit out English muffin for me to take home without me asking for it. 

On our way out the cashier and hostess were standing there moaning and complaining about how awful the customers are and how they hate their jobs.That just capped off the morning and was uncomfortable to experience and we couldn&#39;t wait to pay and leave. The cashier did ask how our meal was and when I started to complain about the service (or lack thereof) she actually rolled her eyes at me and cut me off and just said oh that sucks! What a gem, I bet her parents just love her to pieces. 

We were really disappointed at our experience especially since we thought we were going to an Egg Harbor, which are always amazing."

There are so many choices on the menu and everything I&#39;ve had to date has been great. For how packed they always are, the service definitely isn&#39;t too shabby either! I&#39;m a huge breakfast fan so when I find little gems like Egglectic here I&#39;m all about sharing my opinion with others:)
