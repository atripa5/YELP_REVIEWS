This Little Caesar was very clean &amp; the workers were very friendly.  Little Caesars moto is hot &amp; ready for $5 but at some of them when you get your pizza you feel like it has been sitting on the counter for a few days but that is not the case with this place.  I feel that the pizza here is really fresh &amp; hot when you purchase it.  


For $5 you can&#39;t beat it because the pizza is good &amp; the Crazy Bread is awesome.  

Overall the place is clean &amp; the service was nice &amp; friendly &amp; the food is good.  I look forward to eating here again."

Got there and they were sold out. &#34;We&#39;re making more...they&#39;ll be done in ten minutes.&#34; Kind of defeats the purpose of &#34;Hot and Ready,&#34; so we just went with a regular pizza. Crazy Bread was out too...meanwhile three employees were standing around outside. This was the post-work rush (5:30 pm); come on, folks. 

The parking lot was also a ZOO...it&#39;s next to a driver&#39;s ed school and class was letting out. Parents not bothering to pull into parking spaces and just idling in the lanes blocking traffic while they waited for their kids, kids not watching as they ran to cars...yikes! You need to really want your pizza to go through this obstacle course.

This said, for $5, Little Caesars is a respectable ready-to-roll pizza. Wish it was the variety we&#39;d wanted, though."

When I get there I open the box and it is a round pizza cut into squares. So I asked my money back and walked out. Then decide they have premade deep dish pepperoni that&#39;s good enough. When I go back inside and say I&#39;ll take one of those the black gentleman behind the counter says they do not have any. He didn&#39;t even look I knew he was lying. So I went outside and called on the phone and ask the person if they have any pepperoni deep dish ready for pick up. He said they always have them ready I can come in anytime and pick one up. So when it comes down to it some punk ass  wouldn&#39;t sell me a pizza because he&#39;s a lying racist.

The falafel is fried to perfection. The spices are well balanced and it tastes delicious. We also ordered the mixed grill. I did not care too much for the kafta as it was a tad bit to the dry side but I have to say that the lamb and the chicken shish kebabs were to die for. I have never eaten a chicken so tender. 

The hummus is good but a little soupy as they overuse tahini. But overall I can&#39;t complain. The food was great and my husband and I left satisfied."

The Mr. and baby love the chicken shawerma. Pita bread is good when it&#39;s fresh, but it has also been very dry. It seems like most things are heated in a microwave.

Our appetizers were given to us without plates and there were no extra napkins to be found. My husband said he could tell the kibbeh had been frozen and the taste was off.

I placed a to-go order since I heard this place was good. I got the Maura&#39;s mixed meat,which was ok, and falafel, which needed a little more flavor. I wished that there were options to swap out some sides since you had to get rice or fries instead of other options when getting certain meal combos.

As far as the staff, I felt very uncomfortable. When I picked up the order today, the staff was looking at me and trying to pass off some really off-putting noises intentionally...I understand that things can get boring when there are no patrons in the restaurant, but it caught me off guard since I was on the phone while waiting and then I see people snickering and making noises...extremely unprofessional and made no sense.

That was a big mistake, I could see maybe grabbing a burger here on a Friday night but thats about it. 

We arrived a few minutes early for our 7:30 reservation, the restaurant looked busy, but smelled amazing. They had someone singing out on the patio, and the building itself is beautiful. The host was nice - they sat another twosome then took us to our table. The table they had reserved for us was literally right next to the open kitchen. We sat there for a minute, it was so loud with servers gathering next to our table, filling drink cups, and with the cooks sitting the plates for pickup, we asked to be moved. The only other available table was a large booth for 6, but it was better than right next to kitchen, so we took it.
I could be being overly picky here, but if I have a reservation and THAT is the table you give me when the twosome who walked in just before us did not have a reservation and got a cute booth for two, which I found slightly irritating.

Our server was sweet, made some mistakes with our drink order but nothing major. I asked her about the cornbread (because hello, YUM!), she said it was her favorite on the menu so we ordered it. When it came I was surprised to see it had jalapenos in it, as the menu didn&#39;t state that and neither did the server. I took a few bites but wasn&#39;t a fan, huge disappointment - I can see how some people love this, I&#39;d just prefer to be warned about jalapenos in a dish than be surprised. 

I had the crab cakes, which were raved to me by my friend who frequents Redstone, my husband ordered the Ribeye Jameson Au Poivre, which is supposed to be a black pepper crusted steak with a sauce. When it arrived we were intrigued to see it wasn&#39;t pepper crusted but instead had so many peppercorns on it. He said it overpowered the steak to where he couldn&#39;t taste anything else and were mixed all into his mashed potatoes so he couldn&#39;t enjoy that either. However, the worst part of the steak was that he was literally sawing his Medium steak, back and forth. I&#39;m not a huge steak person but I don&#39;t think a Ribeye, if cooked properly should be that tough to cut with a steak knife. 

The crab cakes were all around okay - nothing to write home about, I&#39;ve certainly had better. The tomato corn salad is really where this dish goes wrong. One bite and I was done - it was so bad, it tasted sour, and I couldn&#39;t figure out why. Ate some fries, they were wayyyyyyy over salted so I stuck to my drink and we decided to call it a day.

Jessie, who I assume was the manager stopped by to see how we were doing. I felt terrible but couldn&#39;t hold back, had to tell her how bad the steak was. She was really sweet, offered to cover our dessert but we were not interested in trying anything else out of that kitchen. She was very sweet to us, took the steak off of our bill, even though we said many times that it wasn&#39;t necessary - it was a kind gesture, is the only reason I&#39;m giving this place 2 stars instead of 1, but we&#39;re definitely not going back.

I will say, kudos to the bartender - the gin and tonic was delicious, my favorite item of the entire meal!"

I got a chicken pasta special on Mondays and thought it was fantastic. We started out with the calamari and shrimp appetizer and fig and prosciutto flatbread. The fig and prosciutto flatbread was very sweet. It came with a balsamic drizzle and since the fig is already sweet, kind of an overload of sweetness. I got an old fashion drink which tastes like fireball whiskey in there which I didn&#39;t like.  There was a lot of food leftover since portions weee huge! 
I would come here again to check out daily specials."

They had a live DJ at the outdoor bar, accompanied by a bonfire pit to light the area. What a cool little spot to enjoy drinks!

We chose to dine inside, the restaurant is very spacious with a lot of seating areas. Another full bar area/lounge fills the center, surrounded by tables &amp; booths on the perimeter.

I ordered the cedar plank salmon with mashed potatoes &amp; asparagus. It was delectable. The salmon was cooked perfectly, &amp; served with a garlic aioli which was BOMB. I could put that on my least favorite food &amp; it would be delicious.

We also shared a cornbread loaf as an appetizer, it was also verrry tasty. Seems like sweet jalepeno cornbread is trending right now as a hot app &amp; Redstone has it down!"

We found something better. For appetizer we had fried shrimp and calamari. It was fantastic. Had great flavor with a touch of heat from the peppers. My wife had the ribs and chicken and I had the prime rib. The chicken was awesome and ribs fell off the bone. Although we felt the ribs were slightly over charred. Had some black &#34;crunchiness&#34; to some of the meat. But both had great flavor. The prime rib had great flavor but the center part of the meat lacked some flavor compared to outer parts. I think the rub didn&#39;t penetrate all the way to the center. Loaded baked potato was great as well. They have a great selection of wine and great service. We will be back!!

The ambiance is beautiful when you walk in. They have a fireplace and beautiful bar area. The layout is nice with lots of space. You don&#39;t feel like you are sitting on top of each other when you are eating and the restaurant is crowded. The service was pretty good as well. Our waitress was pretty nice. Nothing too special, but pretty nice. 

Now onto the most important part... the food. The food was very disappointing. I got the turkey club sandwich, which was pretty good. It was standard, nothing special, My boyfriend and his mother got he peppercorn steak, which they both said was pretty bad. My boyfriend said they had way to many peppercorns on the steak which overpowered the rest of the flavors. The rest of the people in our party also weren&#39;t a huge fan of their food. Because of the service and ambiance I wouldn&#39;t mind giving this restaurant another chance... but probably not anytime soon."

-Food-was done with solid execution and the highest quality ingredients.  Not inventive but well done
-Atmosphere- Noise level allowed for conversations, had a good feel
-Service- very attentive without being obtrusive

Now, for the one negative.  We had children with us and in the corner by our table, there was a mouse trap.  The trap almost snapped one of the kids.  While I understand most restaurants need pest control, I would hope that it is not visible or altered while patrons are dining."

We had to wait 45 minutes for a table but it was fine, we just had a couple cocktails and met some nice people. Older crowd- around their 50s maybe. A band showed up and that was a lot of fun!

Let me start with the buffalo shrimp. I don&#39;t even like buffalo sauce but these were incredible. They were breaded jumbo shrimp and melted in your mouth. I could have licked that plate clean. The ahi tuna was also delicious. Best mushroom soup I&#39;ve ever had. Then we finished with a couple pizzas. The mozzarella was so fresh. Everything was great."

But, if you&#39;re going to tout your restaurant with an &#34;amazing cocktail list&#34;, then make them good cocktails (and hire bartenders who can make good drinks). 

I am super disappointed with the service and the drinks. For a $10-$12 cocktail, I expect it to be stiff. Not like fruit juice. I understand your restaurant is on expensive Oak Brook real estate, and your building probably cost a damn fortune with all the granite and finishings, but come on RedStone, you&#39;ve got to not completely rip off your patrons!

I got the signature pineapple drink on the rocks. There was so much ice in my high ball glass, my drink was only about 2 ounces. It was gone in 5 mins! Yes it was tasty, very light and fruity, but not stiff at all. The girl bartender who served it to me just did not do a good job. 

I ordered the drink again, another $10, and this time a different bartender made it, not on ice but straight up, and put it in a martini glass. It was slightly better, a little stronger, and def more volume. But, it was just a weak drink overall.

Frustrated w the RedStone cocktails, I ordered a whisky sour. The girl bartender made it, and it was SO AWFUL. Super sour. Super sugary. Hardly any whisky. It was gross, and I got them to just trash it. After that point, I just left the restaurant. 

This is the second time I&#39;ve been to RedStone, and I don&#39;t plan on returning."

Came here on a Friday night  after work and since it&#39;s Oak Brook it was mishmash of casual diners and people in sport coats grabbing a drink after work. The atmosphere is somewhat refined but mainly chill and laid back with an outdoorsy decor. 

Started out with the calamari shrimp which very good and stepped up to the baby back ribs which was great. The beer list was fairly minimal but they had a pretty decent wine list. 

 Our server was great and answered any question we had. It&#39;s a bit pricey for the most part but didn&#39;t have complaints. Well worth checking out."

In addition, the service was awful which was surprising considering the wait staff didn&#39;t have to take orders.

Our waitress was very attentive and took care of us well. 
We ordered the redstone burger and the fig and prosciutto flatbread.  Both weren&#39;t that extraordinary dishes as in they didn&#39;t stand out.  However, I&#39;ve have many kinds of flatbreads and this one certainly was one of my favorites.  It had goat cheese, asparagus, figs, prosciutto, with a drizzle of balsamic syrup.  Really good.  The burger was cooked just the way it was ordered - medium. Topped with thick Maplewood bacon, and shredded lettuce, etc.  It was fine. As I had mentioned before, it wasn&#39;t the best we&#39;ve ever had but it was good.
Pretty cool tip: they make everything from scratch. And it definitely tastes like homemade food. Good place overall."

When we told our waitress she says something to the effect of &#34;yea, it&#39;s not always good&#34; huh?! I didn&#39;t like the buffalo shrimp either. It could&#39;ve just been me since I don&#39;t like extremely rich dishes and the large crumbles of blue cheese was a bit much. It is very pretty in there though, and their food is plated cute lol.

Yes, I really enjoy the menu and well prepared dishes here, but the mood, vibe, lighting...just hits every mark for me... and I like that its situated AWAY from a mall and away from the Oak Brook hustle and bustle...perfect, more serene location...and room to breathe...
its a little curvy and twisty to find, stay on Butterfield, to Renaissance, then right on Lincoln Center...yes, I sometimes get lost revisiting this place but I&#39;m also geographically challenged...

It&#39;s one of my favorite places to meet up with friends in the area....ya know when you just want to hang out, have a drink, low-key night, chill and be surrounded by a nice crowd and comfortable vibe, without feeling like your in a bar? or pick up joint? (suddenly, Clubhouse comes to mind) well, there&#39;s something unpretentious and cozy about Redstone...
Its reminiscent of a ski lodge you&#39;d walk into in Colorado....(minus the mountains and skis..).

Lighting is warm &amp; subdued, interior gives off a cabin decor &amp; feel with lots of dark hues, wood, stone and fireplace....I LOVE the outdoor seating with big fire pits and heat lamps....a great area to kick back and take in your surroundings while sipping on a cocktail or glass of wine and enjoying the company your with.

My favorite time to come here is early spring or fall....just as the weather starts to get a bit of a chill, I can&#39;t resist anything with a fire....if you can grab a seat outside, DO IT...fire pits can accommodate parties of 4+....there is an outdoor bar too..

The indoor bar is not huge and can fill up quickly during peak hours....this place packs a decent crowd and SOME nights its more of a &#39;booty soup&#39; (no, it is nowhere near a &#34;Clubhouse&#34; experience)....but there are attractive people floating around and the age group is diverse...especially on weekends..

For dinner, I typically go with their specials.  I usually find something interesting versus off the menu ...My whitefish entrée was delicious...grilled perfectly with a light lemon sauce served with basmati rice...so light, flavorful and moist.  My side of grilled mushrooms were shared and devoured within minutes...Can&#39;t go wrong with the pan seared Swordfish and Fresh Fish specials like Mahi Mahi....I was happy to see Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc on the wine list which paired perfectly with my fish entrée...good selection of wines here...
Our waiter was nice and checked on us a few times...refilling our glasses as needed..
Attentive, but not overbearing...he did a great job explaining specials and catering to our needs..

Though I didn&#39;t order an app this time around, I really enjoy the Woodfired flatbreads here..especially when I&#39;m not looking for a meal and just want something to wash down my drinks...the Margherita or Fig &amp; Prosciutto is my go to...plenty for 2 or 3....this is crispy, light and satisfying...if you like flatbread, try this...Jerk Chicken fondue is another great choice as well as the Buffalo jumbo shrimp (yummm..a little buffalo kick served w/blue cheese..)

Redstone has some good steak choices as well as ribs and chicken though I rarely go that route unless I have a craving for it, I&#39;m usually enamored by the fish choices....Prices are about inline with Clubhouse, little less...If I want a great steak I&#39;d probably venture to Gibson&#39;s or Capital Grille in the area....but they do know how to make a good steak, nonetheless...Great lunch specials and the daily soup offerings are so good!
Get there on a Thur. and try the Wild Mushroom with Brandy Cream soup...(if your a mushroom lover like me)..

What can I say, I really like Redstone..ALOT..
Worth checking out..."

BUT that being said, this place is shockingly terrible!!! I can&#39;t even believe it was as bad as it was! I got the Crab Benedict and sent it back after one bite. It tasted like it was from a diner off the freeway. The coffee machine broke, so we got served cold coffee without the staff even realizing it was not hot.

I was excited because hey, free food, right? Then I looked at the menu... I HATE slabs of meat. I see a bloody steak and all I can think of is the poor cow letting out a weak moo as he is led to the slaughterhouse. I was ready to give this gift card away until I saw the brunch menu...

And so we brunched!

This place is really gorgeous when you walk in. They have fireplaces to the left and right upon entry and in the very middle of the joint is a huge square bar. Outside is what looks like a great place to go for drinks. They have a nice fire pit that was going on a Sunday morning in the middle of January. It looks like they have a separate bar outside that serves the patio. This, of course, could not be confirmed because it was 11 am in January and no one sits outside to drink in 30 degree weather.

Brunch starts with a nice, warm loaf of lemon poppyseed bread. It was absolutely delicious. If you are like me and always stealing your friends lemon poppyseed muffins when they get salads at Portillo&#39;s, you will be incredibly happy with this. A huge bonus that they let you take any that is leftover home. They offer small plates, breakfast, lunch, and a never-ending brunch. The never-ending brunch IS NOT a buffet. They just keep the plates coming until you cannot handle anymore. 

We ordered a whole order of the cornbread to start. This was divine. It was incredibly moist and the maple butter had a nice sweet flavor to it. I ordered the french toast but I am quite traditional when it comes to brunch. It was pretty amazing as far as french toast goes. They use a challah bread so it is a lot thicker, softer, and fluffier than a texas toast french toast. 

Brunch has $3 mimosas! Yes, you read that right! $3 mimosas! I can&#39;t comment on the Bloody Mary&#39;s but the mimosas have the cheapest price point I have ever experienced at brunch. They don&#39;t put a drink menu on the table. We asked and they are happy to bring one but we just knew what we wanted. 

With drinks and the pre-meal cornbread, we got out of there for around $50 for 3 people. Normally, boyfriend and I go for a breakfast at the diner down the street from us and pay $25 for just the two of us without booze. Unless you are out to get hammered, this place is a steal for brunch."

Redstone is a large restaurant with booth and tables, as well as a large outside area for dining. We were a party of 11 and upon arrival were shown to our table right away. Our server was Kelly, who couldn&#39;t have been nicer or more accommodating to my family.  She provided attentive and good service. The brunch menu is not extensive but there is everything from eggs benedict to pancakes.  This is not a brunch buffet so if you&#39;re looking for that, you&#39;ll not find it here.  Some hits with my family were the steak and eggs, crab Benedict and ham &amp; gruyere omelette. I had the salmon and goat cheese omelette.  Unfortunately, my omelette was overcooked and dry and lacking the creaminess of the goat cheese. Also, the description said scallions, but my omelette had chopped white onion instead. Didn&#39;t enjoy that. Had I known it wasn&#39;t going to be scallions, I would have asked for the onions to be taken out like the asparagus I asked to be removed.  If you look at my photo, you&#39;ll see the chopped onion. However, the hash browns were awesome!  Even though it was about a half-cup serving, they were tasty. Again, look at my photo to see the portion size. I also enjoyed the strawberry compote that I used on my English muffin.  All in all, this place was a hit with my family who came from the burbs and from out of town. I would come back here for brunch.

We have been coming here for over a year. We have chosen Redstone to celebrate birthdays, anniversary, and even Valentines day. Many of our family and friends started dining here just off of our recommendation. Needless to say, after this bad experience Redstone hasn&#39;t just lost our business but theirs as well. Unfortunately, it seems like the more we come, the worse our experiences get. We love the food but the service and cleanliness is horrible!!! We were in the area and decided to come in for dinner and this will be the very last time we dine here. Half way through eating our appetizers we noticed a huge ROACH (I have photos )crawling around on the table!!!!!!!!!!!!! We immediately got up and needless to say it ruined the mood. We informed our server and he moved us to a table right next to the booth the roach was in. 

Just when I thought things couldn&#39;t get worse, they did. We asked to speak to the manager about. The manager, who I now know is the GM!, Steve comes over to our table with a less than concerned attitude. He says and I quote &#34;I understand you saw a bug&#34;. &#34;A bug? No a roach!&#34;, I answered. He laughed it off as if it wasn&#39;t a big deal and asked us if he could do anything. We told him and he continued to laugh and make smart faces. His attitude was completely unprofessional and he never even apologized for what happened. It makes me wonder if this has happened before and if creepy crawlers are normal here. Disgusting! We were so turned off by Steve&#39;s attitude that we got up and left even after ordering entrees that would be comped. We were so disgusted with the experience and they have lost our business for good this time. Such a shame because the food really is good but bad service and ROACHES are just a deal breaker.

To start, my table had the buffalo shrimp and the hot crab dip. The buffalo shrimp were tasty and fairly large and the hot crab dip was excellent. For my entree, I ordered the prime rib with mashed potatoes and green beans. The prime rib was delicious except that nearly half of my 16 oz piece of meat was pure fat and inedible. Pretty disappointing, especially because it was a well-cooked and well-seasoned prime rib. Really quite tasty other than the fact I couldn&#39;t eat enough of it! I also had a bite of the parmesan-crusted walleye which was very good. For dessert, we had the hot cookie sundae, which you can never really go wrong with. Overall, Redstone is a solid American restaurant and a good place to come for lots of options!"

The breakfast/brunch/lunch menu is nice enough, but there&#39;s something that&#39;s kind of over-the-top about the experience.   Our &#34;breakfast breads&#34; brought to the table was actually a giant lemon poppy seed cake, with a big dollop of butter on top.   My companion&#39;s egg omelette was heavily smothered.   And the hash browns were stuffed with cheese.   All this is good if you are in the mood to gorge yourself, such as for a last meal.   But for a regular breakfast, it&#39;s all just a bit much.

But what really stuck in my craw was one experience I had with our waiter, Leigh.   I had asked him, &#34;How are the bloody marys here?&#34;   And his response was, &#34;They are really great  -- you&#39;ll love it.&#34;    

The bloody mary I was served had nice garnish, but absolutely no flavor whatsover.  When I asked Leigh the waiter to mention to the bartender that a bloody mary would normally have horseraddish and Worcester sauce, his reseponse was, &#34;Well, I don&#39;t know much about bloody marys.&#34;

For a lot of diners, this might not be a big deal.   If you are reading this review, and my experience doesn&#39;t apply to you, go ahead and eat here.    But if you want a simple breakfast without a lot of gimmicks, there are lots of other great choices in the area.    And get your cocktails served by someone who knows what they are talking about."

Location/Atmosphere: 5/5. The restaurant gives off a warm, bustling vibe. It is a little loud on a busy night, but not obnoxiously so. Parking is easy to find, or there is $4.00 valet offered at the door. 

Service: 5/5. We experienced excellent, friendly service here. The hostesses, servers, and manager were all attentive and genuinely friendly. Great job. 

Food: 4/5. Great wine list. The specialty cocktail list left something to be desired, but there were a few drinks that we tried that were good. Try the pineapple vodka concoction for a sweet buzz. Salads here are fresh and have generous portions. The rotisserie chicken is excellent. 

Overall: Good choice for dinner or drinks in Oakbrook Terrace!"

It&#39;s very dark at night...the parking lot, the building, and the inside. 
Food had its ups and downs. We got brisket hush puppies were good. The corn bread came with maple butter and it was amazing! Reminded me of Sunday morning breakfast at moms. The wedge salad was cold and crisp but the plate was too small for the dish. You couldn&#39;t cut up the lettuce and eat easily off of it. The French onion soup was okay- too much pepper. We got the chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Delicious, I just wish the chicken came with more of the sauce.
It was good but the ambiance kind of ruined it for us. It was okay."

He had the filet with mac n cheese/garlic mashed and i had the rotisserie chicken/bbq ribs combo with green beans and fries.  His filet was very tender and juicy and my food was delicious.   We also had the chocolate cake, which was good, but hard, I think they needed to take it out of the fridge a little earlier.  The cake definitely wasn&#39;t as good as my favorite, Portillo&#39;s chocolate cake, which was a disappointment, but not a deal breaker. Everything was good, but i wasn&#39;t blown away."

When you go for Sunday brunch, they give you a free mimosa for each person and then this amazing &#34;morning bread&#34;, which is basically a huge delicious pastry cake.  The flavors of this morning bread rotates (sometimes blueberry, cinnamon, etc.).  Any way, after you get past these two amazing &amp; delicious free items... You have a great brunch menu (with breakfast and lunch items to choose from).  Everything I&#39;ve tried so far has been super tasty and everyone else at the table has agreed.  I have gone once with my family and another time with friends.  Definitely going back.  Plus, I&#39;ve had the same waitress both times and she is fabulous.  Wish I could remember her name to give credit!

I have been here for dinner before as well.  Beautiful place.  Nice atmosphere.  Good food.  Pretty pricey, but what do you expect for a nice place in oak brook?  One strange note that is unexpected: it turns into a bizarre over 50s hookup spot some evenings, especially in the summer.  Very strange to see the place packed with older people (read: old men) hitting on crazy drunk women.  But hey, I&#39;m not here to judge.  Good people watching, if you ask me!"

Service-also great! Our server, Steven, was very nice, professional and told us his favorites, which I appreciate. 

The food we tried: 
 Fig and prosciutto flatbread-delicious! 

Steak salad- very good-loved the dressing, the thick cut bacon and the steak was well-seasoned and cooked.. Just wish there was more of it. My friend and I had asked to split it, thinking after sharing flatbread, this would be plenty. Each of our plates had only 2 thin slices of steak. For 16.50, you can give a bigger portion of meat. 

Wild mushroom soup- great flavor, just really thick."

Though this place is quite pricey, it is totally worth it if you&#39;re coming here for a special occasion. I came here for my birthday once and then returned this time for my parents anniversary. After two amazing times I had to write a review. First off the surroundings are amazing. It&#39;s in a low key spot, nice and quiet. Also, there&#39;s outside seating by a pond. It is beautiful and there is a fire pit. Along with seating, there is an outside bar. On the inside there is a bar in the middle and there is comfortable, quiet, and enjoyable seating for all parties around the room. Secondly, the staff are extremely polite and fun. The greeter, the waiter, even the manager all made sure we had a fantastic time there. We came on a slow random night in the middle of a snow storm, and sure enough, they were there to greet us and make sure we had a good experience. If this is how good it is on a slow night, I can&#39;t imagine how amazing they must be when they have their best staff available! And finally, the food. My family and I had a meal and wine here. We all shared some of their moscato which I have to say was one of the most amazing tasting moscatos I&#39;ve ever had. I had steak, my brother had chicken, my parents had fish, and my other brother had some combination plate. All of us equally agreed it was the best food we&#39;ve ever had, which is saying a lot for me especially, since I have dined at some very exquisite places. Since they nailed every type of dish, I&#39;m sure anything you order here will leave you completely satisfied. I will most definitely return again for other occasions, dates, and about any chance I get. Definitely try it!"

They have kinda made the buffalo shrimp their signature entree item and have kinda mastered it and no other restaurant seem to even want to attempt to compete with them on this. (and I kinda don&#39;t blame them) The buffalo shrimp are big, spicy and tasteful. If you are a fan of buffalo and hot sauce you will enjoy them. They are costly ($18 for 5) and 1 person can easily eat the full 5 with room for 5 more, but $40 for 10 shrimp is an ouch! It&#39;s typically a treat to myself. I have tried other items on the menu from the cedar planked salmon to the burgers and for the most part their food is tasty, but my favorite item on the menu is the buffalo shrimp. Their drinks are pretty good, with a minimum amount of kick to them, but a welcome special that they do have is $3 mimosas on Sunday&#39;s for their brunch from 10-2 pm.

My wife had the sea scallop special. Both were exceptional. You can&#39;t go wrong at this restaurant.

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
Based on the great reviews, I decided to bring my family here to celebrate my mom&#39;s birthday. For the most part everyone enjoyed their food - some more than others but the food was good. Our waiter, Pepe was awesome. But, one of the servers who helped him bring out our entrees was a complete and utter tyrant. She banged our plates and glasses around - touched the plate that I was STILL eating out of and moved it over without asking me if I was finished. She banged the plates around so much that she knocked over a glass of water that spilled on my daughter&#39;s iPhone 6. I immediately asked Pepe for the manager. The FOH manager, Chris Margo came over and asked what happened. I began to explain to him what happened while my daughter showed him her screen. He was loud and rude and did not handle the situation properly. He said that they would have to report a claim with their insurance and that he would be back. Well, when he came back he completely overlooked me and began talking to my daughter (a minor). I interjected and said, &#39;excuse me, I&#39;m the parent, her mom, would you please...&#39; I wasn&#39;t able to finish my statement because he very rudely said to me &#39;I&#39;m talking to her, let me take down her information and I&#39;ll get yours when I&#39;m done.&#34; Excuse me, what the what??? He completely disregarded what I said as her mother and proceeded to talk to her. Who does that?? So, without ruining my mom&#39;s birthday dinner, I decided to keep my mouth shut and took his card. It&#39;s not my fault or my daughter&#39;s fault that the server who spilled the water was on super hype mode yesterday. Despite Pepe&#39;s exceptional service, the birthday celebration was sadly and very rudely interrupted and blemished due to the manager&#39;s behavior. 

Sidenote: I&#39;m not gonna even talk about the rudeness and attitude of the insurance agent, Tayla from Traveler&#39;s insurance who called me to discuss what happened. Okay, I talked about it a little but that has nothing to do with Redstone, so I digress. Moving right along shall we...

THE FOOD:
Rotisserie chopped salad - good.
Buffalo Shrimp appetizer - excellent, no phenomenal! 
The Grilled Wings appetizer - bland and not cooked long enough.
The Barbecue chicken and ribs combo - very good. Chicken breast was very moist!! Delicious!
Braised short ribs - my mom said they were &#39;just okay.&#39;
The Redstone Burger - In the words of my daughter, nieces and nephew &#34;Very Good!&#34; 
The Loaded Baked Potato - Very Good 
The Asparagus - not flavorful enough
The Key Lime Pie - delicious AND the sparkly &#34;firework&#34; presentation they did for my mom&#39;s birthday was quite nice. 

The AMBIANCE:
Too dark for a 3:30pm dinner. I blinded our entire side of the room because I had to turn on my flash to take okay pictures. LOL. It didn&#39;t help either that it was pretty cloudy outside. :( 

OVERALL:
With the service and poor attitude of the server, I would never really want to go back. But, if someone I knew wanted to go there for dinner and invited me without telling me first that we&#39;re going to Redstone, then I would go (if that makes sense). I really don&#39;t want my perception of this place to be completely based on the jerk of a manager, Chris Margol was to me. That said, I probably would go back because even his ignorance cannot overshadow those delicious jumbo buffalo shrimp IJS!!! I&#39;m willing to give this place another shot BUT if I see the blond server/waitress, I&#39;m running (or at least hold my glass until she&#39;s done passing out entrees)."

Interesting outdoor decor next to entrance. Plenty of patio space &amp; a covered patio area.Liked the fireplace and the outdoor theme. Very nice. Smelled the ovens going all the way in the parking lot. Met a friend here for lunch. Good size place. Upscale place with modern indoor decor.Had rotisserie chicken. Very moist &amp; flavorful.  The service was excellent. Servers not even ours came by several times to check if we were ok &amp; or needed the table cleared away.The pricing is a bit on the high side but not out of line w/ whats going on here. Worth ur stop.

I recently hosted a family celebration in the private dining room at the Redstone, and was less than pleased with the service I received leading up the event. 

When we first viewed the Redstone&#39;s private dining room and were still deciding which restaurant we&#39;d work with for our event, I felt my family and I received attentive service with timely email follow up.  When we decided to go with the Redstone, I reached out to the event coordinator to provide credit card information for the deposit.  11 days later, I never received a receipt, nor was the Redstone appearing on my online banking records.  I emailed the event coordinator to ask what was up.  Within a couple days, the deposit was charged to my credit card, but I never heard anything back from this person.

Fast forward nearly two months later - - my family event was 9 days away, and I hadn&#39;t heard from anyone at the Redstone since that last email.  I called and asked for the person that I had been working with - only to find he no longer worked there.  A new person was filling his position.  I was disappointed that neither outgoing or incoming worker, nor management, made any proactive effort to inform me of these changes, but had to move forward - my event was 9 days away.

I spoke on the phone with the new coordinator, respectfully expressing my concerns and taking the proactive step to communicate the menu that I had chosen.  My understanding was that I&#39;d get a contract in the next couple days.

Fast forward to the day prior to my event:  It was late afternoon and I still didn&#39;t have a contract.  I called the coordinator who asked for my name. After I gave it to them, they asked when my event was.  I wanted to say, &#34;in 18 hours - - aren&#39;t tomorrow&#39;s events on your radar?&#34;, but it seems I already have my answer to that question.  

I then called management to express my concerns.  I felt I was given the general management lip service - - we&#39;ve got your deposit, menu, and contract (implying that there really weren&#39;t any problems) - - sorry for the &#34;confusion&#34;.   

The event itself was very nice, which is my compliment only to the kitchen and wait staff.  I felt event and management staff sort of avoided me that day until they could bring me the bill when things were done and over.

One final note - I was given the choice of white table cloths, or no table cloths. I went with the plain tables as I thought they would play up the warm colors in the room - - only to find that a number of them are riddled with water stains (see picture).  If anyone still decides to have a private event here after reading my review, I hope you&#39;ll at least consider getting the table cloths."

Reminded me of an early version of Opie
Kept reaching over us.
How about &#34;excuse me&#34;
Very awkward.
He brought the ketchup I requested for my burger as I was finishing the burger.
My wife&#39;s omelette was incredibly dry 
We&#39;ve been here a dozen times and this is our first bad experience.

The food at Redstone has always been great but the service was terrible this evening.  The place was not full nor was the outside bar.  We ordered drinks (a Corona, bottle of water and a Mojito) and nearly 20 minutes went by before our waiter came by and apologized for the delay.  Another 5 minutes went by before we received our drinks.  We order 2 appetizers that took over a half hour to come out.  The waiter again apologized saying he was yelling at the kitchen.  Dinner came out shortly after the appetizers when my wife ordered a glass of wine and my sister in-law ordered a mojito.  We ate our dinner and sat at the table afterwards and our waiter never returned.  Finally, I asked another server to track him down and asked him for a check.  He never acknowledged the drinks we ordered and did not receive.  It was not on the check which certainly lead to the conclusion that this server was the one who messed everything up from the beginning.  

We have been coming to Redstone for years and the food has always been great.  However, the service lately has been sub-par and this last incident was terrible.  Even the appearance of our &#34;waiter&#34; was not appealing.  He was profusely sweating the entire time and his attire was sloppy.  He was looked totally discombobulated and stressed the entire evening.  Redstone is a higher-end restaurant they need to have some more standards with who they hire that represents them.  If this is not remedied we will never go back.  Far too much competition in the Oak Brook area."

Food was terrible.  Had the crab cakes.  I could tell by taste and odor that it was well past its expiration date.  French fries covered in salt.  Ordered the buffalo shrimp. Was told by our server that this app was outstanding.  It was just shrimp drowning in buffalo sauce and blue cheese dressing.  Nothing special.

Very professional, knowledgeable and attentive without hovering. We started with the baked wings appetizer and they were delicious. I had the bbq meatloaf with mashed potatoes and veggies and it was SUPER DELICIOUS. My boyfriend had the prime rib sandwich and he enjoyed it. I also had one of the pineapple drinks and it was good.

We&#39;re from the northwest suburbs and my first reaction upon entering was &#34;welcome to Stoney River&#34; which is in the Deer Park shopping center. An almost identical layout.

I&#39;m not going to do a deep dive here, except to say that the prices were higher than what we were expecting, so we kept it to entrees and water as we weren&#39;t looking to drop a ton of money on this meal.

I went with a basic hamburger. Unfortunately, their basic hamburger goes for $15. It was good enough...but not $15 good. 

My wife had a half-slab of ribs. They didn&#39;t look particularly impressive on the plate, but she said they were good.

For dessert, we couldn&#39;t resist their triple-layer chocolate cake with whipped cream and a scoop of vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce on the side. $10 was a bit of a yellow flag, but it was worth it and probably saved the meal from just being slightly better than average.

Overall, this is a restaurant that is in the mold of J. Alexander&#39;s (and Stoney River).

If that works for you, then so be it."

No issues parking-wise either.  The large bar in the center of the restaurant is a great place to wait for a table or to socialize.

However our NYE experience was just ok.  We were sat on time (around 9pm) and were planning to slowly eat, drink &amp; stick around until midnight.  Our waiter was attentive but we could tell he was in a rush from the start.  We did inform him we were planning to take our time.  We were probably his last table around 11:15pm and he made it very obvious he wanted us to close out.  The restaurant was basically empty and the bar appeared closed before midnight.  No champagne toast offered.  Definitely a bummer!

Food was decent.  The butternut squash soup was yummy.  Calamari just average, not a whole lot of flavor.  The General Tso turkey burger was unique and tasty, but maybe a tad too much garlic.  The cajun ribeye was decent but there are better steak options in the Oak Brook area.  Small beer list by today&#39;s standards.  The red sangria tasted like jolly ranchers."

Plenty of free self parking, business casual. It&#39;s a lovely restaurant, huge stone fireplace, warmly decorated. Service was just OK, no water on the tables. I did not ask for any, and it never did come. The lunch menu was OK, sandwiches, salads, flatbreads. I had the rotisserie chicken Chopped salad-it was a flavorful combo of greens, optional blue cheese, golden raisins, corn kernels, some chicken, with a tasty, slightly sweet dressing. My companions were a bunch of ladies, mostly enjoying salads. A little bread basket would have been a nice addition. A fellow diner had a steak salad, the portion seemed quite small. We waited a while, hers was the only plate that was delayed coming out of the kitchen. Waiter explained delay only after the dish arrived. Not too many leftovers at the table.

I had never heard of it until I found it here on Yelp.

The service was friendly, fast and courteous. We started off with the jerk chicken fondue, and I swear on all that is holy that I could live on nothing but this appetizer for a very long time. The chicken is juicy and spiced perfectly. The fruit was as fresh and delicious as you could hope for, and the croutons have to be the best croutons my mouth has ever experience. They melt in your mouth, melding perfectly with the fondue.

We had the ribeye, the garlic mashed potatoes and grilled green beans.  We ended with a heavenly chocolate chip cookie skillet sundae. It was all exquisite. We can&#39;t wait to come back."

Am absolutely in love with the decor,  ambiance and outdoor patio. My friend and I sat on the first floor outdoor area. I was hoping this could become a spot I could go to more often as it is less than 2 miles from my home but I don&#39;t believe that will be happening after the experience we had today. 

First,  am shocked the menu has such little to offer.  Just shocked no complaints there. 

Second,  the hostess was rude. 

Third,  the service was awful.  We were not even given menus. We had to ask for them. Then our food wasn&#39;t cleared off for a very long time after we were done eating.  We were never asked if we needed anything or how our food was after we started eating.  In full disclosure,  when they gave us our food the girl who delivered the food (not our server) did ask at that time but our server never did after.  We sat there for an hour and a half and were never asked if we wanted a second drink!!  Never.  And it was not even busy at this point.  We just wanted out.  So decided to get our check.  Well,  we had to practically yell to request our server to bring us our check.  I have never in my life not tipped at least 20% (at least not to my recollection) and this time we decided it was necessary.  We tipped only 10%. I hated doing it but felt the need to.  

I really wanted to like this place but was sorely disappointed."

They have 3-4 hostesses at the front so there is no reason why I should have to compete with people ordering drinks just to pay my take out bill.

After a bunch of friends with decent palettes encouraged me to try it out, I finally went. I really love the atmosphere - about as casual as it gets without being corny, canned or franchisee. The tacos I had were great and the complimentary chips and salsa were a great addition. If you&#39;re looking for fancy food and a really creative decor scheme, you probably won&#39;t like it, but that&#39;s clearly not what Los is going for.

I definitely recommend this place and it is relatively cheap so definitely a place to continuously check out for late night food or just a quick tasty bite. 

Steak burritos with hot sauce is the best. They have other options that are good also and nothing is better than this burrito and a beer. Definitely worth your time and money!"

Their prices have gone up--but I guess that is to be expected, and the add-ons are a little pricey too, but that fact of the matter is that the menu is still reasonably priced, and you can get a lot of food for cheap and it&#39;s deeeeelicious. 

I think that their steak and chicken are my favorite meats that they offer. I love getting their guacamole as an appetizer. I usually stick with ordering tacos, however I&#39;ve tried their carne asada, flautas, taco salad, and tortas. I&#39;ve also been ordering their &#39;SOPES&#39;, which is found under their sides section, but it&#39;s definitely entree worthy because they&#39;re big and scrumptious. If you have never tried a sope, I suggest you try one immediately at Los. A sope is a thick tortilla slash gordita type slash tostada-y like corn dough that is obviously cooked to perfection and topped with refried beans, meat, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, tomato. Trust me, it&#39;s really good!!!!

Anyway, I get excited anytime suggests going to Los, and I&#39;m probably gonna stop by in the next week or so. I come here like, a lot..."

Love love love this place for some great Mexican food. The whole experience can be summed up like this &#34;Get in, order, enjoy, enjoy, enjoy, get out.&#34;  Let me explain...

The menu was very straight forward - your typical Mexican food options. I went with there taco plate which seemed to be a popular choice among fellow Yelpers. With a handful of filling options to choose from, I ended up going with one chicken taco and one beef. Of course. these tacs were accompanied by beans and rice, which were also introduced with a basket of chips and salsa (which had a perfect kick to it). 

My meal was delicious! I appreciated that the food tasted very authentic. You can always tell when Mexican food is either made right, or super americanized. The service was great - quick and efficient! No sooner did I sit down then my food was brought over to the table. And of course it was so delish that it was just as quickly devoured :)

So like I said, it was a quick experience but one that&#39;s definitely noteworthy! I&#39;d love to go back and enjoy their food again!

Tip: Don&#39;t be fooled by their outside appearance. Yes, they are located next to a mechanic and it may not be the flashiest of places, but the food is on point!"

Everytime I eat here, I do a double-take. Am I really sitting in suburban Glen Ellyn right now? Inside Los Burritos Tapatios, you&#39;d never know it. 

They have your standard items like tortas, tacos, burritos, etc. Of course, my usual is always the taco platter. Two al pastor tacos with onion and cilantro only, with beans and rice. 

If you choose to dine it, there are about four or five booths and quite a few tables to choose from. The booths are along the windows and are usually filled up first. They&#39;ll bring you chips and salsa to munch on before bringing your order. The salsa is one of my favorite parts about coming here. It&#39;s the perfect consistency; not too chunky and not too runny. You can taste every flavor in it, which is a plus. You don&#39;t experience an overwhelming tomato flavor, nor is the cilantro or onion overpowering, either. I could eat this stuff by the gallon.

I&#39;ve always been pleased with my food when I order here. The al pastor is so good. I have only found one (small) gristle piece of meat in all the times I&#39;ve come here. Hey, it&#39;s bound to happen. The rice is perfect - no stupid chunks of corn, no weird flavors. Just. Plain. Rice. That&#39;s how it should be. The refried beans are quite tasty- if they come from a can, I certainly can&#39;t tell. 

Most of the staff working here are still the same people I can remember from many years ago. The employees are friendly and the food is delicious (and cheap!). If you stop by late at night, be prepared to deal with loud, intoxicated patrons. They usually don&#39;t bother me, as I&#39;ll just take my order to go and that&#39;s that. Problem solved. 

I&#39;ve moved from the area, so I don&#39;t get to visit LBT as frequently as I&#39;d like. When I do stop in though, it is quite a treat for both my tastebuds and my wallet. Long live Los Burritos Tapatios!"

I usually get the steak or chorizo (spicy) but sometimes get the al pastor which is a treat.  Their red and green salsa are good and they offer sliced jalapeños for the table for a small charge (a buck or less I think).

The meat is just not incredibly flavorful. And the atmosphere is just overwhelmingly bright for my tastes. Bright yellow and fluorescent lights. It&#39;s part of the charm, sure, but it still makes it not a great place to chill 

3 stars for authenticity, decent taste, and portion size."

Sitting just slightly West of the corner of Roosevelt and Main street this eatery is open for breakfast and is open until 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM on weekends.

The inside of the restaurant has a handful of tables and a few booths along the front wall/window. When you walk in there is a menu posted behind the counter and a wide array of dishes to choose from.

I&#39;ve been going here for at least the past 17 or so years and have tried almost every entree on the menu at some point. I recommend the Torta&#39;s and Burritos. If you&#39;re in the mood for breakfast the Huevos con Chrorizo is an excellent choice as well. While the way the food is prepared does change slightly depending on when you come in, the food is always good and always tasty.

As a bonus,  if you sit down and eat in the restaurant they free provide chips and salsa. Los Burritos Tapatios in Glen Ellyn is my favorite Mexican restaurant."

It&#39;s too hard for me to pick just ONE favorite dish so I&#39;ll just offer three &#34;can&#39;t miss&#34; picks; al pastor tacos, steak burrito and carne asada tampiquena.  Come to think of it, the taco platter is a pretty darn good pick.  Awww, heck!   There isn&#39;t just one or a few dishes I like at Los Burritos Tapatios, I like &#39;em ALL!

Here&#39;s what I else I like:
1) They are very clean.
2) The service is great.  Be sure to tip the server.  She&#39;s always bustling about serving meals or bringing you a basket of chips &amp; salsa.
3) Free chips &amp; salsa!
4) Family friendly without turning the place into a damn Playland.  Case in point:  A father and his 4-5 year-old daughter enjoying a fajita plate.  You could tell they were having a good time.  In the past, I&#39;ve seen Moms and Dads with kids and everyone is enjoying themselves without turning the restaurant into a zoo.  Enough said.
5) They are efficient.  Order your meal at the counter, sit down, enjoy your chips, soon your meal will arrive and you can be out of there in less than 30 minutes if you are on a tight schedule.

Los Burritos Tapatios is great for families, a business lunch or a quick lunch with a friend or co-worker.  Oh -- and the food is pretty darn good too."

The chips and salsa are pretty good. I&#39;ve tried a tamale - it was OK and satisfied my craving. The al pastor tacos are so-so as are the beef....next time I&#39;ll probably go for the chicken. My favorite dish so far from this joint has been the caldo de camerones...that&#39;s shrimp soup for all you gringos out there. It&#39;s got some good spice to it and the shrimp were cooked just right. 

LBT is extremely affordable so it&#39;s a big hit with the teenagers...fair warning! They also package your to-go order very nicely and include all the fixins one might need which I really appreciate it. LBT is also open late so you can get that taco fix into the wee hours of the night if need be!"

This dive gets so much business -- from white collar mopes and greasy blue collar workers at lunch to the obnoxious Wheaton College kids and the equally-loud drunk teenagers at night.

It can be an eclectic bunch, which probably explains Los Burritos&#39; need to include items like the authentically Mexican &#34;french fries.&#34;

The food is solid, albeit slightly overpriced when compared to true Mexican restaurants in neighboring towns. You&#39;re guaranteed fast, attentive service and complementary chips and salsa if you dine in. The place is also usually very clean.

My favorite meal is a steak taco platter, which includes two tacos, rice and beans. I usually supplement this with one or two more Mexican-style tacos.

All-in-all, it&#39;s an okay place to grab some Mexican food if you&#39;re in town. However, if you&#39;re willing to drive a bit further, there are better alternatives (that serve alcohol to sweeten the pot)."

I ate here to console myself the day I got fired from the Caribou Coffee across the street and also the day my girlfriend at the time broke up with me. There are a lot of memories made at this place. 

The food is awesome. Probably not something you&#39;d go out of your way for but it&#39;s wholesome, fairly priced and the portions are huge. 

The staff and the service is great. The last time I went there a few weeks ago - 18 years after I first went there - I saw some of the same friendly faces behind the counter that I saw on my first visit. 

You also see a lot of Mexicans eating here...and isn&#39;t that the ultimate endorsement of an ethnic restaurant?...when people of that ethnicity choose to eat there?

You order at the cash register and either wait for pickup at the other end of the counter or sit down if you&#39;re eating in and they&#39;ll bring the food to your table.

It&#39;s a $9 burrito but it is good enough for 2 hungry people. It comes with Spanish rice and beans on the side too which I love.

They haven&#39;t blinked an eye on a few occasions I&#39;ve had to order 20+ tacos at once - Not that tacos are difficult to make, but I still feel like a pain when I&#39;m ordering for a group and they haven&#39;t seemed to mind. With only a few changes, it seems like the staff has stayed mostly the same over the years and start to recognize you (or are at least friendly like they do!) Open late is always nice in an area where quite a bit closes early. The only thing that can sometimes be a pain is if I&#39;ve called in an order ahead of time to pick up and they are busy, I&#39;ve still been stuck standing in line to get to the front to pay and get my food. At that rate I could&#39;ve just gone in like everyone else and gotten it to go, probably would&#39;ve been fresher. But that&#39;s not always the case.

The rice is great - simple without any veggies added but with a touch of spice. Finally, the guacamole is thick and has the right distribution of cilantro and onion with just a little tomato.

Years ago, my friend convinced me to try the tongue tacos and I&#39;ve been hooked ever since. I&#39;ve tried lengua at several places since and I always compare it to Los B&#39;s. It&#39;s cooked right and cut right, very important. Los B&#39;s does not offer much comfort or ambience but that&#39;s not what you go their for. You go there because its easy to get there and you get good cheap Mexican quickly. Though the prices have gone up a bit over the years, it still remains a cheap meal.

The food comes out very quickly, so if you&#39;re in a hurry, it&#39;s no problem.  It&#39;s impeccably clean - even by my high standards.  They are open well past midnight every day, and the food is very flavorful, hot and delicisious.

Suggestions.:

1.  Order a ground beef taco!!!  They are excellent!  The chef mixes in with the ground beef little chuncks of potato and carrot.  Very tasty!

2.  Order the tacos al pastor (barbaque pork).  You won&#39;t be disappointed.

3.  They will serve the tacos Mexican style (cilantro and onion only) or American style (lettuce, tomato, and cheese).  Just tell them your preference.

4.  For an extra $0.25 they will add a couple slices of avacado to any taco.

5.  If you dine in, the chips and salsa are free.  The chips are a solid B+ (but not quite an A), but the salsa is awesome!  A+++  Beware, it&#39;s a bit hot, but it doesn&#39;t have too much of a bite.

6.  The steak used fof the steak tacos and burritos is your typical low quality skirt steak - tough and a bit grizzly.  I&#39;m not a fan of those, but it that&#39;s your thing, you won&#39;t be disappointed.  

7.  The prices are very resaonable, so it won&#39;t break the bank.  

8.  It&#39;s not a great place for a date night, but it&#39;s perfect if your&#39;e with the family, friends, or just by yourself.

Bon Appetit!"

The burritos are a staple but nothing beats the balanced flavor combo of the wonderfully crafted taco. The perfect proportion of meat, cheese, lettuce and tomato on two white corn tortillas.

As for the filling for your burrito or taco, the steak is a great starting point. You can&#39;t really go wrong. However, the secret meat, is pork. The pork is seasoned with a chili sauce is just perfect. 

I&#39;m also a fan of the chips and salsa. The salsa is just spicy enough. One word of advice though. If you want more chips, ASK, DO NO TAKE MORE WITHOUT ASKING! I cannot stress this bit of advice enough. If you go up to the counter and take another basket, you will have the evil eye cast upon you. Los B&#39;s is not a good enemy to have.

Fresh ingredients.

It was (and I&#39;m sure still is) perfect.

First off let me say anyone who thinks Taco Bell is better than this place ought to have their mouth confiscated because clearly you aren&#39;t using it properly.  Los Bs runs a quality restaurant with speed and deliciousness.

The burritos are huge and not able to be tackled in one sitting unless you want to see that burrito again in the very near future.  The chips and salsa aren&#39;t the best I&#39;ve ever had but they do the trick.  The true beauty of the place is the fact they close at like 4am and open again at 6am.

I love all of their food but usually order the steak burrito with a side of chips and guac.

One interesting thing about it is that the food is a little inconsistent (in a good way).  You can tell the salsa is made on sight because it varies in the intensity of heat, and the guac can be creamier or more peppery on any given day.

That being said, I eat here about once per week, and have never been disappointed."

I grew up in Chicago, going to great authentic Mexican places, both sit-down AND carry-out type places, and this place is equal or better than any of them.  Not even in the same league as fast-food places like Taco Bell or Chipotle.  After eating here, you&#39;ll realize that Chipotle is a chic gimmicky place that is not authentic (even if the employees are Mexican).

This place makes their own chips, and salsa, and everything, which says a lot.  And they don&#39;t put rice on their burritos, which also says a lot.

When reading most of the other reviews, I found it hard to believe that we&#39;re talking about the same place, which is why I decided to leave this review.  So if you&#39;re looking for authentic Mexican food, give this place a try and judge for yourself.  I haven&#39;t found a better Mexican place in the western suburbs, at least not in the Wheaton/Glen Ellyn area.

My ONLY complaint would be that sometimes the mild salsa is on the hot side.  But I&#39;ve mentioned that to them, and it happens less often now.  (I&#39;m a white guy and even medium salsa burns my mouth.)"

La Hacienda has always been one of my favorite restaurants, but I always go to the Addison location. I&#39;ve been to this Naperville location twice. The first time I went years ago my food was not served at the correct temperature as it was not hot. I decided to give this place a second try since I was in the area.

First off, let me say when I was here the restaurant was pretty empty. We placed an order of bread to eat with our soups, which never arrived. When we ordered our food, I ordered enchiladas rojas - what I order every time I come to La Hacienda. Our hostess brought out our food instead of our server and she had brought me enchiladas suizas. I let her know that I ordered enchiladas rojas. When she told my server, the server began to tell me how it&#39;s the exact same thing only the cheese is different. I politely let her know that was not what I ordered.

After this, we had to wait for what I had actually ordered. Once again the hostess brought out my food and this time it was correct. Our server did not come back to check on us/how our food was. We got a single drink refill by the time we were almost done eating. The hostess was doing a better job as our server than the actual server.

The last thing that aggravated me is when we finally got the check. Our server left the enchiladas suizas on our tab instead of what I had actually ordered. The enchiladas suizas cost more than the rojas and when I let her know it was incorrect she argued that &#34;it&#39;s the same price&#34; (I knew it wasn&#39;t because I order this every single time I come in). Finally she comes back and says &#34;ok it&#39;s a dollar off the bill&#34; without wanting to rerun the check.

Overall the lack of service was frustrating, I would completely understand if the restaurant was packed, but it was just the opposite of that. The fact that instead of trying to fix the problems, the server just decided to argue about it was also annoying. I&#39;ll stick to the Addison location from here on out."

Let me start by saying, I think most Mexican restaurants are overpriced. Mondays and Tuesdays are days when they have margarita specials, so that is the only perk as far as drinks are concerned.

I also noticed a huge difference in service going during the week. On my most recent trip, as friendly as the waiter was, he was not attentive in the slightest. We had a party of 6 and the water glasses sat empty for most of dinner. He rarely came by to check on us, give us the bill, etc.

The food is average to slightly above average. The guac is ok, lacking some flavor. The salsa is actually pretty good, but I don&#39;t see much of a difference between mild and spicy. Also, we had the enchiladas and got chorizo in one of them and it must have been from the bottom of the bin, it tasted like burnt tar. Luckily it was only in one, and the chicken made up for that.

We ended the meal with a free dessert from checking in, and got a chocolate burrito. It was very good, very fudgy and extremely rich. 

Like I said, stick to the week nights here to get the best bang for your buck."

The enchilada was not good at all either. I don&#39;t typically select cheese enchiladas but that&#39;s what this dish was served with. The cheese used was cheddar which for a Mexican restaurant is strange. Way too much cheese in the enchilada in my opinion, and I LOVE cheese.

Service during the week has been great, however on the weekends it&#39;s been extremely slow. They also serve chicken noodle soup before your meal. Is that traditional Mexican? That&#39;s not necessarily the first thing I think of......

Their guac is very good here. I&#39;ve had both the enchiladas and quesadillas. Both have been pretty typical. They run coupons in the local magazine every once in a while and have specials during the week. They also run a Check-In offer which I would check out.

We got the salsa and your given both mild and hot, which both were good. Then my husband and I both got burritos and they were prolly the best burritos we have ever had. The red salsa and melted cheese on top was a nice touch! Then to end it we got fried ice cream. At first we were unsure about it but ended up being really good. Definitely coming back!"

On a whim, we stopped here after some good recommendations from friends and co-workers. Let&#39;s just say this was probably the best dinner date we&#39;ve had all year!

We started with the bowl of guacamole and chips. I was hesitant at first because I thought the guacamole was a little expensive. Once I tasted it, I was so glad we got it! It was so creamy and one of the best guacs you can find!

The waiter was so nice, attentive and definitely seemed to enjoy his job. He told us the specials, of which we each ordered a different dish. They were both heavenly!  They were savory and you can tell the sauces were made in-house and with care.

Around the time we were deciding to finish our food or splurge and order a dessert and take the rest of our food home, I checked in with my Yelp app. Every check in gives you a free dessert. Easy choice, we packed up our remaining meals and ordered the Tres Leches cake (after another great suggestion from our waiter). Umm, let&#39;s just say I would have licked the plate clean if we weren&#39;t in public.

Our waiter was spot on, never over bearing but we never had an empty water or pop cup. Absolutely perfect service in my book! Something else I noticed when we were leaving, EVERY employee smiled, greeted us, or wished us a good evening while we were entering or leaving the restaurant. This made us feel so comfortable and made this a very inviting space. 

Overall I would suggest this place to anyone who will listen! The prices seemed fair, the food was delicious, impeccable service, and great atmosphere."

I&#39;ve driven by La Hacienda at least a million times. Not sure why I never tried it before today and when I yelped Mexican restaurants in Naperville, this place didn&#39;t even come up. 

Called in a lunch order to go. Got a burrito suizo with beef which comes with a side of beans and rice. 

It was a good, solid, hearty, big old burrito. I could only eat maybe 1/3 of it and was stuffed. No way can a normal person finish this in one sitting. 

I&#39;ll be back."

The restaurant glows with huge star-shaped lanterns and, in another room, lights suspended in woven baskets. Warm wood and tile-topped tables create an inviting atmosphere. 

When we first walked in, the room to the left was being used for a private birthday party and someone was using a microphone to give a toast, so we were immediately assaulted with that booming voice. Gladly the place IS split into several rooms, so we asked to be seated as far away as possible, and got a table on the far end of the room on the opposite side of the building. 

Our waiter was very cheery, gave us time and gave good explanations when we had questions. 

We started with one of the &#34;cheese dips&#34; (as he called them -- usually it&#39;s referred to as just queso!) If you just got it plain it would be pretty damn bland, so be sure to at least add some roasted jalapeno; there&#39;s also chorizo if you feel like something meaty). 

I also wanted a margarita and originally went to order the &#34;skinny margarita,&#34; but they were out(?), so I went with the Classic, rocks with salt as I always order my margaritas, but it had a strange sort of chemically aftertaste. Would not try again.

My entree came with a bowl of what the waiter described as &#34;chicken noodle soup,&#34; which had a flavorful broth and small shell noodles, but was so scorching hot that I had to set it aside. By the time it had cooled down our entree had arrived anyway!

My tacos al pastor were pretty much perfect, with a true sweet tang of pineapple. Would definitely recommend!

Overall, this is a unique place in a convenient location to 59 yet not buried in all the crush by the mall. I&#39;d definitely like to check out other things on La Hacienda&#39;s menu. For tasty Mexican food in Naperville, you can go home again!"

As it was an early lunch on a Sunday, the restaurant was a little more sparsely populated by patrons.  I found the staff to be friendly and inviting. While the initial item that drew my attention online, a Milanesa Torta, was unavailable, I decided on the Fish Tacos.  I started with chips and salsa, which I found to have an initial sweet flavor, followed by a slow heat. I would have preferred to have two salsas (the one brought out was their hot salsa), however, I didn&#39;t ask if they had a mild salsa. The fish tacos also had a slightly sweet initial taste, but we&#39;re quite tasty. I ended up asking for a side of limes to add to the tacos, which made them perfect.  I finished up with the &#34;Free Dessert&#34; coupon, and selected the Tres Leche cake. It was quite delicious, although I haven&#39;t had a Tres Leche cake with such a rich icing on top - not bad at all, but unexpected. Overall, I was hesitant to try a new restaurant which seemed to have mixed reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised after a very delicious meal.

We were enticed here by a $10 off coupon.  The wife had the pork tamale dinner, and I had their enchiladas verde (green sauce) dinner.  The enchiladas were smaller and for $13, could be had for maybe $8 at a lot of other places.  Both servings were on the dryish side (like ala microwave), but edible otherwise.  You&#39;re paying a premium for a newish and nicely furnished location.

If we had to pay regular prices, I&#39;d probably have to knock the review back to 2 stars.  Good to have checked the place out though, as it&#39;s probably the newest Mexican place I&#39;ve ever been in."

- Layout: Awesome, spacious, dark and warm. I dig the Gothic chairs... a lot. 

- Service: Never, ever have I had poor service here. I&#39;ve eaten here many times and each time I have a server that knows his/her &amp;^%$. My glass never reaches empty, my food is always warm and any specialty add-on&#39;s or substitutions are addressed and not forgotten. 

- Food: Holy mother of Amazing. This place delivers. I have had pretty much everything on the menu here and love it. Of course, there are individual tastes for everyone so some things are not favorites and others are. I&#39;ve had a hard time picking what I would like because I enjoy the selection so much. GOOD food. 

- Cost: It&#39;s right up my alley. I&#39;m not looking for an El Centro fix (before they switched owners. Everyone knows El Centro sucks now... admit it). I&#39;m looking for a sit down and enjoy myself meal minus the cheap ass factor of Chi-Chi&#39;s (thank God that chain failed). The cost is appropriate for the quality of food - and quantity.

Came here for a girls night out. This place was pretty vacant and that&#39;s not surprising. If you want Mexican food, I would even say Chipotle beats this place or even Chili&#39;s menu with Americanized Mexican food, and please, just go down 59 a little bit more and go to On The Border. 

The spicy chicken salad was okay. Not spicy. And when you can&#39;t go wrong with chips and salsa, you can here. The salsa was watered down and had no taste to it. I was disappointed. I felt that it was frozen food that was brought into the microwave then served to us. The portion sizes were huge. But--- I&#39;m not coming back unless it&#39;s for a drink.

This restaurant is polarizing both in my family &amp; with others I&#39;ve spoken with. Hopefully I can provide a few insights that will resonate with regulars! I&#39;ve been to this location 6-8 times &amp; we visited the Bolingbrook location 10 times or so (closed a few months ago). My 4 is really a 3.5 &amp; this is based on experiences ranging from 2.5 to 4.  
The service is very consistent- consistently blah. It is so consistent (across locations) that you will come away believing they train staff to provide mediocre service- all staff has been somewhat aloof, quiet, a bit inattentive, slow and forgetful- every time, every server! It infuriates my wife. 
The interior of this location is great/ I&#39;m big on ambience. They nail one part of ambience (fail on others).
The drinks are good (sangria &amp; margaritas for us)- there actually is alcohol in their drinks. 
The food varies quite a bit. We&#39;ve sent a dish or  two back (perhaps 2 of 5 times in my life) on occasion. We&#39;ve had tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and a great marinated chicken dish. 
The ups &amp; downs have dove us away, though I still miss this place. It&#39;s like an ex lover who cheats on you, occasionally treats you poorly, yet you still want them back. 

Every time we visit (with another 7-8 diners), I think, &#34;Surely they can&#39;t stay open!&#34; They do- try &amp; see what you think. It IS worth a shot!"

So it was the Daddios birthday and since my stepmom and dad cater to my sisters, I was forced to drive to the state border (naperville, for me) and try this joint. Dont be confused with the relationship to La Hacienda in Addison (much better food). 

From the outside look of it, it looks like a great restaurant. The interior gives you the same impression. On to the food:

- Chips n Salsa: Salsa was way too hot. And I love spicy food, but this was too spicy for me. 

- Strawberry Margarita: You know those packets of frozen drinks you can buy at Walgreens, like Pina Colada and Daqueris? Well thats what this Margarita tasted like where it came from. Nothing special. 

- Chicken Burritos: Waitress made a mistake and I got beef burritos. Honestly I could have made these at home. Just a flour tortia, some beef, lettuce, tomato, and a heep of beans. No spice, nothing. More La Taco Bell than La Hacienda. 

Here&#39;s where it gets better- the dessert was kick ass. I tried the fried ice cream, and could have finished the whole thing by myself. The chocolate cake was also very good and fresh.

How bad could it be?

Not bad. But certainly not good.

Totally, utterly mediocre food.

Chips and salsa were decent, but the burrito I ordered was anything but. Just some chicken rolled into two  tortillas to make two thin chicken-filled tortilla tubes. So basically their &#34;burritos&#34; are not-fried taquitos with sour creme on the side. Refried beans were definitely old and so pureed it looked like baby food (or worse). Rice was bland.

Mango margarita was too syrupy and thick. It was like drinking orange juice concentrate through a straw.

Aaaaaand the cavernous space and decor is just ... overkill. Definitely trying to make the space &#34;interesting&#34; because the food definitely is not.

Boyfriend enjoyed his chicken tamales, but we both agreed if you want Mexican food,  you can definitely do better just about anywhere else."

We were pleasantly surprised by the decor!  It was very quiet, but we came in at 4pm on a Thursday, so that is to be expected.  

We were greeted with chips and salsa... salsa was great! (chips, not so much) I was afraid this was a sign for the rest of the meal.  The classic margarita, on the rocks, was okay, not great.  (see other reviews for the best margaritas!)

I ordered the Chiles Rellenos and my husband the burrito suizas.

The food was fantastic and portions were huge! (contrary to another reviewers issues)  I brought half of it home.
Service was top notch.

Yes, the restaurant caters to the target market of the area, and some of the dishes are Americanized.  

Would I come back?  you bet... would I drive 30 miles to do so, probably not."

My wife and I thought this is the best Mexican we have had in Illinois. The decor of this place is amazingly nice. The service is courteous, attentive and professional.

Started with chips and salsa. Chips a little thicker than I typically like but quite good. Salsa was very good. Mildly spicy, fresh tasting, and never ending bowl of it. Before our entrees came we each received small cups of chicken soup. Super! Very flavorful and a great start.

I ordered the whole snapper served with ranchero sauce. The wife ordered chicken mole. Both entrees were excellent. My wife gets mole at any restaurant that has it so she knows her stuff and she said this was the best. My fish was wonderfully prepared and super moist and tasty.

Trust me. La Hacienda De Los Fernandez is a wonderful new place in South Naperville if you enjoy freshly prepared tasty Mexican food. We will definitely return."

The reasons it is not can definitely be changed. One reason is because of the wait staff. On the few occasions that I have gone there, the help seemed less than thrilled to help any customers that came through the door to their tables. My boyfriend (who is authentic Mexican) and I had to wait almost 5 minutes just to be seated and another 10 minutes to get a waiter to our table. This may not seem like a long wait if the restaurant is full but there was only two other tables with people dining!

As for the food, it was ok to me. My boyfriend being the real deal Mexicano could spot right away that the food was not correct nor authentic. He was nice enough and did not complain to them. Their prices are a bit high also for the quality of food they are serving. We go to El Burrito Loco just east of there on 75th street once a week or more and are rarely disappointed and pay half the price.

All and all, this restaurant just needs to check their recipes and get some wait staff in there that are a little more attentive and I think they will see their business grow. It&#39;s usually word of mouth that packs a restaurant or any business so if any of the managers from La Hacienda are reading this, you have some work to do sooner than later!

PS: I will be going back again because I really do love the ambiance!"

 We had the Botana Grande (appetizer sampler) and everything was pretty tasty except the tamales were kind of bland.  The flautas especially were tasty, however, my gf didn&#39;t like those at all.  Different tastes I guess.  

 I had the Steak Tampiquena and it was just fantastic.  5 stars for the steak.  Juicy, flavorful, perfectly done.  I can&#39;t say much more than that.  My gf got the combo fajitas.  They were pretty run of the mill for fajitas, which aren&#39;t really my thing anyways.  She really liked them though.  I will say the shrimp in the fajitas were quite tasty.  The beans tasted like the ones you buy from a can but the rice was very good.  The waitress we had was friendly and never kept us waiting for anything.

The restaurant is really big inside, very clean and has a nice atmosphere.  The service is always very good, quick with refills of chips and salsa and beverages.  The salsa is very good, with an actual kick to it, so if you don&#39;t like spicy salsa, tread lightly.  The chips are below average, which is something I think they could definitely improve on.  The chips just take like store bought tortilla chips from a bag, and not great ones.  I ordered the &#34;Super Burrito&#34; with steak and it was very good, but not something that jumped out at me as fantastic, just a solid good burrito.  Everyone else at our table enjoyed their food as well, they have big portions and there were plenty of doggie bags to take home.  The prices are very reasonable and for the quality and amount of food you get, you won&#39;t be sorry.  One pointer: I checked in on Yelp when I arrived and a pop up on my phone indicated that for my efforts I got a free dessert.  All in all a good solid Mexican restaurant and I would recommend checking it out, it isn&#39;t the best Mexican food I&#39;ve ever had, but it&#39;s better than a lot of places in the area and you won&#39;t leave disappointed."

The staff was very accommodating to my group of gal pals and took our drink orders right away.  Everyone loved their margaritas, including on the was swirled with Sangria...yum.  The food tasted pretty good too, not the most authentic but not horrible either.  One of the people in my group ordered a chicken torta, but was brought one with beef instead so the waiter had to get her a new one and it took way too long - since we all had our food, they really should have put a rush on her order and they clearly did not.  I loved the salsa that they served with the chips, but when we ate all of our chips they never offered to bring us more.  If this were the end of the night, I would have bumped this review up to 3 stars....but later that evening my stomach started to hurt...and then it got progressively worse throughout the night.

Not sure why that would be, I thought any place within a quarter mile on either side of Route 59 would be jam packed with lunchers during the noon hour on a Saturday.

Before I jump into the heart of this review, let me qualify that I just moved back to Chicagoland after having spent almost seven years living in Southern California, so my Mexican food taste buds have shifted just a tad. Before moving to the Southland in 2003, I used to think Chi Chi&#39;s and Pepe&#39;s (watch for that review coming next) were the end all be all of Mexican food... fried, creamy, and cheesy goodness. When I first started going to Mexican places in LA and Orange County, I wasn&#39;t a big fan because, I guess, they were too authentic. Well, in 6+ years, that has changed.

With that said, this place is not a high-priced Taco Bell as some have noted. I had the mole chicken, which, while the chicken itself was fairly bland, the mole was excellent. It was definitely a case of them having one standard chicken that they then pour whatever sauce required for whatever dish... this was not chicken that had been simmered in mole, as it should have been.

I also ordered the Queso Fundido, as I am a huge fan (when it is done well). Unfortunately, it was merely ok. The presentation was pretty nifty though, where they set the thing on fire next to your table, kinda like the Greeks do with the Saganaki. Even though I&#39;ve come off of my expectation that there be cheese on anything Mexican, when I order QUESO fundido, I expect queso to be the first and foremost ingredient. This was a dish of some charred beef, onions, and potatoes, partially covered with a thin blanket of cheese. As I said, it was ok, but I have definitely had much better. For one, lose the crumbly beef substance and put some chorizo in that bad boy!

I did like the decor, it was a welcome surprise after viewing the exterior and the sign out front that looked more like a 24-hour diner than a Mexican place.

I probably wont be going back, but it is definitely not the worst Mexican place around. For that honor, I think I will throw it to Pepe&#39;s."

My Aunt and I went at about 3:30 on a Thursday afternoon. We Walked in and nobody was in the front to greet us, I had to go to the bar and that;s where I found tho host sitting at the bar chatting. 

The food was ok...the chips and salsa ( we asked for a milder sauce )were good and the guacamole was very good. ( I have to watch my salt ) and found it seasoned just right.

I felt bad because every time the waiter came by (which wasn&#39;t very often due to the fact that everyone of the servers were sitting at a table in the back of the bar) we had more requests...I didn&#39;t know the taco&#39;s didn&#39;t come with cheese so he brought us some at a cost of $1.75. Then I didn&#39;t finish my soup ( which was excellent ) and neither did my Aunt so she asked for the both to go and was told that it was something that came along with the dinner and wasn&#39;t meant for carry out, but he gave it to her anyway. 

When it was time to leave I had to go in search of the Waiter to get our check.
For a quick and convenient place on that day it was ok but If I was craving good mexican food I would make a point of going to the Addison location!"

First off, I couldn&#39;t find a menu online with any pricing. I called and talked to their hostess and asked her for prices to menu items. She hardly knew the menu. That should have been a red flag. Well we ordered the Jumbo Burrito and Taco Dinner with an appetizer of nachos. I was told the nachos were 8.99. Now in my mind, I&#39;m expecting the works. Chips, cheese, beef, tomatoes, etc. So I go and pick up my order and when we get home I see my appetizer is JUST CHIPS AND MELTED CHEESE! You have got to be kidding me! I paid 8.99 for chips with melted cheese on it???? And to top it off my husband opened his burrito meal and it was the super burrito with FRENCH FRIES?? I thought that this was a Mexican restaurant? My tacos were right, although just ok. I paid 9.99 for OK tacos.And my husband&#39;s 8.99 burrito was just beans and beef. Not worth the price for sure. I would never recommend this place to anyone. I called the manager and they are willing to offer me the correct meal and their nachos especiales at no charge. Unless I&#39;m blown away after we get that food, I will NEVER go there again!"

It reminded me of authentic restaurants in Mexico, which I used to visit a lot for work.  The chips and salsa were amazing.

No sauce on meals, no seasoning... No chance I will return.

Ordered 2 kids taco meals... Wanted them plain with just cheese. Charged full price for kids meal PLUS $1.50 per meal for cheese! With the full price $2.25 Sierra Mist ($2.25) the kids meals were more than the adults meals. 

Not blaming the server but he should have been ashamed to serve this food. Surprised I wasn&#39;t charged extra for silverware or crayons for the kids meals."

Ok, let&#39;s get straight to it.
Do you like fried chicken?  Yes!
Do you want something better than disgusting KFC or Popeye&#39;s?  Yes.

Kicks is called broasted because it&#39;s more like roasting than frying.  You can tell when you eat it that it&#39;s not fried the same way is the other places.  The chicken seems really good quality and Tate&#39;s great.

If you like fried chicken, want something better than the other crappy chains, quality is better, tastes better, and seems less greasy........ then you have to try kicks.

If you couldn&#39;t answer yes to that question, I don&#39;t trust your taste in food"

I could easily live off of chicken, so I knew I&#39;d have no problem finding something I&#39;d like here. 

I ordered a bbq chicken sandwich with mac and cheese as a side. The sandwich was great, and there was enough to take home leftovers.  I also got to try a chicken strip and they will probably be what I get the next time I&#39;m there.

Only complaint I had is that our orders took awhile to get to our table."

The waffles are awesome.  Sometimes you just have to have the right equipment.  The waffles were thick with great flavor.  I&#39;d come just for the waffles, and that&#39;s what it might take to get me back.  Did not like the Mac&#39;n Cheese.  Too sticky...sweet?...and cold underneath.  The Mac&#39;n Cheese did not arrive with the delivery of our food.  Had to go find it.  Maybe it was sitting under a heat lamp, because that&#39;s what they tasted like. 

Not enthusiastic about a speedy return."

I give them a high rating since the staff here are real nice and fun loving folks. They&#39;re always courteous and takes our orders with a smile. The more than 10x we&#39;ve been here, it&#39;s always good service even when they&#39;re about to close.

They have good side options, like mac n chz, mashed potatoes, sweet pot fries.. They deliver, but I dont live in Naper, so we will see if they change boundaries, or open in BBrook. They have chiken n waffles. This is my 2nd time trying it. The first time was a few days ago, and I did notice the breading on my sandwich was really light colored. Everything tasted good, but I did consider I ate some undercooked food or something, because the next day was rough(TMI). I love broasted so much I am willing to try again... After 2nd try.... They definitely dont cook the chicken long enough."

The order taker was not listening to me as I gave my order, kept asking her own questions rather than listening to  the customer.
So my food arrives absent half the order, only to have the manager come argue with me that I didn&#39;t order it.
Finally told him forget it. Because he would not leave the side of my table.
Bit into the hardest chicken sandwich I ever had. Not sure if this place recently changed hands or what....but it&#39;s BAD!
Choking down the $13 chicken sandwich as I type this review. 
Go elsewhere!"

It is the chicken equivalent of meatheads, smash burger, five guys, etc. Therefore, we weren&#39;t totally shocked when it was $25 for the two of us for lunch. It&#39;s usually that much at meatheads. The ordering and serving process is similar to meatheads as well. Order on the way in, grab a number and they bring your meal to you. Drinks are self-serve, of course. There are soft-serve drinks and 3 different teas; black tea, jasmine/ginger green tea, and watermelon black tea. There are also several bottled beverages available for purchase.

The interior is cute and modern. The wallpaper on the side wall is chicken feet, but it was styled well so that I didn&#39;t notice right away. The ordering platform is immediately inside to the left, so it would be hard to miss. I didn&#39;t catch how it makes it&#39;s way to the kitchen. I&#39;m assuming technology. Maybe they have caught on with other &#34;high-tech&#34; restaurants that use computer programs that pull up the order, without having to print it off. 

Anyway. I ordered the Tex-Mex wrap with sweet potato fries. The wrap had everything I love in it; &#34;Seasoned pulled chicken with Monterey Jack cheese, chipotle ranch, avocado, romaine, pinto beans, green onion, cilantro, and pico de gallo&#34; (pulled right off of their website). It was delicious, but I only managed to eat one half. Either way, it made for a great dinner tonight. The sweet potato fries were the best I&#39;ve ever had. Yes, everyone is doing them right now and has been doing them for a year or so, but they are worth ordering. They don&#39;t seem to be frozen nor are they like any other sweet potato fries I have ever had. They were perfectly crispy with a soft center. They didn&#39;t make it home in my doggy bag. 

My husband had chicken tenders and chicken tortilla soup. He seemed to enjoy both very much. He agreed that we will be coming back soon.

For those Chick-fil-a fans, we rated this higher in regards to quality and taste. And, it&#39;s open on Sundays. And, as far as I know, the company is LBGTQIA friendly. It&#39;s a little bit more expensive and a little bit farther from us, but we will definitely still return!


Update: We have now been there twice and there seems to be some disconnect between what is advertised and what arrives. They advertise pictures of crisp, curly fries but what I received were soggy fries. The fries were no better than 3 hour old McDonald&#39;s fries. So...don&#39;t order the normal fries."

The chicken is 10x juicer, more flavorful, and fresher than other similar chains. We have ordered it a few times for parties, and we have dined in several times, too. Tenders and bone-in pieces are excellent. The downside is that it&#39;s super expensive. For 15 tenders and 2 sides it&#39;s $30+, and the sides are not big at all.

He was everywhere at once and had his arms wrapped completely around the entire experience. Service says it all. The food itself was near perfection but a ton of salt. Blood pressure was pointing up after the meal but I would look for a low sodium option. I will definitely go back because these folks &#34;get it&#34;. Make it easy. Make it simple. The leaders lead.

I suggest getting the two dressings, one a lime vinaigrette and one a chipotle ranch, on the side so you can control the flavors and amount on your salad, the flavors are very strong! The salad comes with a Kick&#39;s stick which is a sort of sliced piece of garlic bread that will literally change your life! Always get it! Additionally, the onion straws are amazing as well!

So rather than drive through the snow (and seeing how I&#39;ve had Kick&#39;s bookmarked anyway), I decided to give it a try. 

I walked inside and looked over the menu. I wasn&#39;t terribly hungry so I decided to try the Southwestern Chicken (grilled) Sandwich on wheat ciabatta. The sandwich includes a &#34;zesty marinade and pepperjack cheese, chipotle ranch, avocado, chopped romain, and pico de gallo.&#34; For $1 more, I upgraded from the chips to the mac &amp; cheese. I paid and was told by the cashier (Alex) that my food would be brought out to me. 

I chose a cozy booth directly across from the fountain drink station. I only waited about 5 minutes or so for my food. When it was placed in front of me, I was shocked by the size of the sandwich and the mac and cheese. Let me just say, if you come to Kick&#39;s, you better be h-u-n-g-r-y. I knew right away I wouldn&#39;t be finishing my entire meal here. 

I first sampled the mac &amp; cheese, which was looked to be cavatappi pasta with a big glop of cheese on top. A little disappointing, seeing as how I expected a nice blend of noodles and cheese already mixed together. The taste was decent; a little bland for my liking but not terrible. I then surveyed the sandwich, plotting how I would attack this thing without having to dislocate my jaw. I managed to smush it down as best I could and took a bite. The flavor was excellent; the avocado and pico de gallo were fresh, the bread soft, and the cheese slightly melted. The grilled chicken was perfect.

My suspicions were correct; I had barely made a dent in the mac and cheese and ate about half of the sandwich. I asked Alex for a large box and a bag to go. With a smile, he handed me requested items and I proceeded to pack up my order. Looking around, I didn&#39;t see any garbage cans, so I assumed this is one of those places where you leave everything on your table to be cleared away, a la Noodles &amp; Company. I always get confused as to whether I should leave a tip in cases like that. However, I rarely have cash on me, and so I felt bad leaving my mess behind without leaving at least a buck or two on the table. 

Kick&#39;s went above my expectations today. It may be a bit pricey, but I felt for over $9, I got my money&#39;s worth with the huge sandwich, side, and small fountain drink. I look forward to returning in the future."

Staff quality has gone down in the last few months. No hellos when you come and in. Not even after having to wait for half a minute or so at the desk for someone to come out of the kitchen to take your order. I said the food is usually good because the frequency of it tasting stale has really gone up as well and they often forget your side orders.  Also there is no point in signing up for their points system. They keep telling me I should be getting an email everything I break 100 points to get a free sandwich. Have gotten on since they opened and I&#39;ve reset the points many times. That&#39;s why I&#39;m going somewhere else now.

However, after visiting Kick&#39;s, I think I would leave theirs behind.

The food itself is okay, but it&#39;s priced slightly higher than what I feel comfortable paying for the quality you receive. I&#39;d place the food satisfaction level somewhere around a KFC or Brown&#39;s, but you pay premium prices here. 

The soup was okay, but it was clearly kept in one of those heating kettles that turns the temperature up to levels normally only found inside the sun. 

And the silverware situation was just comical. I had to ask two people three times just to get a stinking spoon for my soup. The first time I specified that I needed a spoon the girl working the front counter handed me a wrapped fork and knife combo. Then she made me wait in line again til she was finished taking care of the other customers there. I get that she was trying to put their customer service first, but had she accurately served me to begin with, I would not have had to get back into the line. 

Oh and they do that thing where they give you clear plastic cups for iced tea, but don&#39;t properly cool it, so the tea actually heats up the cup and decreases its core stability thus leaving you with a handful of melty cup and hot tea. Notsogreat. 

All in all, this was disappointing because when I drove by and saw a chicken cafe I got a stupid excited grin on my face only to have that grin turned into a frown after dining here."

The Good:  The Chicken Tortilla soup is very good with lots of spice.  It&#39;s garnished with avocados and tortilla strips, and it is served with a slice of garlic bread.  I also really liked the watermelon iced tea.  

The Bad:  My sandwich (the classic chicken) was so bland.  Kick&#39;s offers many options to customize your meal, including the type of sauce and cheese you would like.  The ciabatta bun was toasted and buttery, but the chicken itself was tasteless even when topped with pepperjack cheese.  Sandwiches are served with chips, unless you want to upgrade your side (there are a lot of options).  I almost never turn down macaroni &amp; cheese, but I should have.  It was very creamy, but once again, bland.  This disappointment must be how my dog feels when the doctor tells me to feed him a &#34;bland diet.&#34;

If it hadn&#39;t been for my coupon, my meal would have cost around $15, which I think is outrageous for a fast casual restaurant.  Although I did get a lot of food and was quite full after lunch, I wasn&#39;t exactly satisfied and regretted not going to Chik-Fil-A instead."

I overheard another customer complaining and she was told that they had run out of chicken??!!  

Last, I asked for nutritionals and they told me that it was available on the website. When I went on their website there&#39;s absolutely no information on nutritionals. They need to get on this many people have I to watch their intake of calories, fat and other allergens.

One day I was going to the Starbucks that was a couple of doors down and I saw a sign for chicken and waffles in a wind and long behold I look up and there is a sign above a door that says kicks. Im like omg...ok a place in the suburbs that serves chicken and waffles!!! I am going to have to try this place out. So on a random day I go to kicks for lunch. Upon arrival I was able to to place my order with no problems. The cashier was as friendly as can be. I informed her that I never been here before and she told me to just choose a table and someone will bring my food out to me. Sounds simple enough..right??? Right. 
It didnt take long for my food to arrive and upon presentation it just look like someone threw some fried chicken and Belgian waffles on a plate with syrup and butter  and gave it to me. I was not impressed at all. Nope nada none. At this point I was hoping for a miracle that the food would taste better then it looked. The odds were not in my favor.  The chicken was dry, oh here are the best two parts. My Belgian waffles were extra crispy on one side and just crispy on the other. How is that even possible?  I have no clue and I didnt realize it until I bit into it because  of course they had the extra crispy side face down. Then the butter that I assume was supposed to be whipped butter. Now mind you, whipped butter is smooth and fluffy or creamy and is supposed to side on your pancakes or waffles or toast with ease. This  butter was hard as a brick like it just came out the deep freezer and broke into clumps. I had no chance of smoothing it on my waffles because it was so hard it tore my waffles apart. The syrup was the best thing about this meal. As far as the cost it was a little pricy for the portion size, the dry a^! meat, the crispy and extra crispy waffles and the side of brick butter. I do not mind spending cash on something that is worth it or I can at least take pleasure from. This plate did not satisfy neither one.
Now I really hate to give such a negative review but I must speak the truth. I know I will not be going back there. I dont see the point. If I could give this place zero stars I would, but the one is because yelp makes you and two because of the cashier&#39;s friendly and helpful attitude"

Now, before I was a poutine enthusiast, I was a chicken enthusiast. I&#39;ve had it in every form, including raw (which is actually pretty bland). I know what makes a good bird.

And, despite the low 3.5 star average, Kick&#39;s makes a good bird! I had the broasted chicken, which came with a breast and a drumstick. It was juicy and tender as can be, with perfectly crispy breading. I chose mashed potatoes for a side in order to sample their homemade gravy, which is wonderfully thick and contains little strands of chickeny deliciousness.

The atmosphere is much nicer than I would&#39;ve expected from the street, and I spent the entire afternoon planted in a booth coding a silly Twitter bot on their quick wifi.

This is some excellent chicken, and Kick&#39;s will have my chicken loyalty.

Young inexperienced staff. Basic customer service skills lacking .
Very nice dining room. Panera style 
Colors and ordering process. Lacks music.
Coke freestyle would have been a plus.
I prefer fresh brewed iced tea. 
I liked the wide open kitchen window.My cobb salad was good. I asked for it tossed it 
Wasn&#39;t . The lettuce was shredded -i like shredded in sandwiches not on salads. Seems cheap to me.
Broccoli firecracker soup was
Just ok. The pesto chicken sauce was excellent.

I really wanted to like Kick&#39;s. For one, I love chicken. For two, I love kicking. You should watch me drop kick acorns and other small objects. I&#39;m outstanding! 

I came here on a Friday night with the fam in tow. It wasn&#39;t busy but it wasn&#39;t dead. We ordered at the counter and seat ourselves. The interior is very nice and contemporary and also clean. We ordered a sandwich, grilled cheese for the babe, and some broasted chicken, which I feel is a pretty good initial menu exploration. 

Here are the results:
- We waited for like over 15 minutes for our food. In a normal sit down restaurant, that is no biggie. However, I feel like fast casual restaurants should be a little quicker. Would you wait 15 minutes at Naf Naf or equivalent? I don&#39;t think so. It felt like forever and everyone was really restless.

- Food was not quite worth the wait. Fries were straight up not good. Just gross, cold and kind of hard. Sweet potato fries were passable but I wouldn&#39;t drop kick an acorn for more. Santa Fe sandwich was good, but impossible to eat. It fell apart and basically turned itself into a chicken salad with two sides of bread. The broasted chicken was just okay - definitely not worth the wait. I appreciated that it was super fresh and hot, but the flavor was a little lackluster. 

I actually prefer Jewel Fried Chicken. Weird!"

After &#34;pdf&#39;ing&#34; the menu and reading reviews, I tried it for lunch this past week.

I had their Chicken Pot Pie (limited time availability) which was good-the pie part was placed on top of the chicken pot part.   Good for both parts.   I had a side salad with it, which was good with spicy dressing, but was very small.

Portions were average, but everything brought out to nearby tables that I caught a glimpse of-didn&#39;t state of course-looked appetizing and nothing took very long.   The counter in the middle of the location was strange to place your order there, then walk around to the drink station-very oddly placed.   Not that busy either, but it was a weekday late morning on another blah weather day."

This place reminds me kind of like a Smashburger or something similar.  When you walk in, you can see the array of chicken choices which ranges from soups, salads, sandwiches to chicken meals.  I decided on a 1/2 and 1/2 combo which consisted of a chicken Cesar salad and a chicken sandwich.  I waited a few minutes for my food and both were brought to my table.  I was a fan of both items, being very flavorful and filling.  I liked that I could have two things instead of one and the price wasn&#39;t too bad.  I was encouraged to join another rewards program, which I did.  In about 12.5 more salad and sandwich combos, I should earn enough for a sandwich.  There are a lot of other good looking choices.

It looked like a place I could sit and work while getting a bite to eat so I stopped in.  I got the chicken soup and classic chicken sandwich.  After one spoonful of the soup I had to walk through their kitchen to make sure my wife hadn&#39;t changed jobs and starting making her famous home made soup for this place.  Everything is very fresh and although it didn&#39;t look like much food I am STUFFED.  The only complaint I have is that they put their home made cookies right at the register where everyone can see them (and easily buy them)!  Haha

Okay, the chicken tenders were okay and not spectacular, but I only tried a bite and didn&#39;t order them since that&#39;s not something I would normally order.  

The restaurant is always very clean and you get served on actual plates instead of the typical disposable wares of other &#34;fast food&#34; lunch spots in this price range.  They do a great job of presentation with the plating.  

After a few visits, my coworkers heard me discuss meeting for lunch there and ordered takeout for me to bring back to the office.

Ordering was pretty straight forward as there are 2 registers and a huge overhead menu in front of you after walking in. 

Food: We tried the 2 piece Broaster meals and our sons had grilled cheeses. The Broaster chicken is basically fried chicken, but it&#39;s pressure cooked, so it&#39;s not greasy (that&#39;s the explanation we got). We had mashed potatoes and coleslaw as our sides. The chicken pieces were on the smaller side, but they tasted pretty good. The mashed potatoes were good, but barely room temperature. My husband said the coleslaw was better than average. The grilled cheeses were very good. They have many other menu options such as chicken sandwiches, salads (they looked really good), and soup. 

For a family of 4 we spent $31, which I think is a little pricey for what we got. I don &#39;t know if we&#39;ll try Kick&#39;s again. It&#39;s just not much to be desired."

I went in today during the lunch hour and they were extremely busy. I ordered a chicken sandwich with provolone cheese and pesto cream and an order fries. My husband had regular chicken with a side of mashed potatoes. 

It took forever to get our food. I will give them a pass this time because they just opened and are probably getting the hang of it. Let&#39;s hope. 

The food was very good. My sandwich was delicious and the pesto cream was just perfect. The fries were also very good as they were not overly salty or greasy. My husband liked his chicken but did mention that his mashed potatoes were a bit on the salty side. 

I will be trying this place again in the future."

Like others have mentioned, you order and pay at the register, receive a number, and your food is brought to you. Staff was very nice, especially the man who brought it out. For the price, dish presentation is a 10/10. I got a southwestern style chicken sandwich, and opted for breaded chicken over grilled. I don&#39;t want to recite the condiments as I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll forget one, but it was a great sandwich nonetheless. I also ordered the tortilla soup, and it was awesome! Squeeze a little lime in there and it&#39;s perfect. You get a garlic bread-ish slice that is generously sliced for dipping, and it goes very well with the soups.

I had the salad (Santa fe) and soup (chicken chili) combo. Salad was delicious w/lime dressing, chili would have been great as well but it was a bit salty for me. I would have given them a four because of the saltiness but my son gobbled it up and loved it. Hubby had pesto chicken sandwich w/side salad, which he absolutely loved. The sandwich was nice and big. Kids had grilled cheese and Mac-n-cheese, one with fries and one with apple slices. They both enjoyed their meals with drink included. All and all, the experience was great, was not to pricey, and we will return. Will definitely recommend this place to friends. I might give them another chance on the chicken chili because not a lot of Semi-fast food restaurants have it, they usually only carry beef or vegi-chili."

It was a little pricey, but, hey, you&#39;re in Naperville, people. Nothing seemed atrociously expensive, though.

The place had just been open for about a week. Upon entering, you immediately encounter the front counter for ordering (this is a quick service style place: order at the counter, sit down, food brought too you). I am a little astounded that another reviewer didn&#39;t figure out how the process works as the counter is literally five feet inside the door to the left with ropes directing you there. Anyway, the menu is presented on a menu board behind the counter and is well designed &amp; easy to read. The only suggestion I would make is changing the name for their &#34;broasterie&#34; chicken as it is difficult for the order takers to make that distinction in the loud environment (not to mention many folks are poor enunciators).

On to the food! We each ordered a standard broaster chicken meal. My wife chose mashed potatoes as her side &amp; I selected the Mac n cheese. The mashed taters were your standard Midwest style. I prefer more black pepper in both the potatoes and the gravy but that can be fixed at the table. The Mac n cheese was excellent. The noodles were al dente &amp; the cheese sauce was nice &amp; creamy with a distinct cheddar bite. The chicken was excellent. It was cooked perfectly and the broaster process leaves the chicken nice and juicy. The breading is well done but could use a slight kick up in the spice dept for my Texas taste buds. They serve Louisiana Hot Sauce as a condiment which is fantastic! Overall, excellent food at a price point very comparable to Popeyes.

As for the service, yes the food took a bit long to arrive. My guess is that they prepare the chicken to order this extending prep time vs. a place that fries chicken in large batches. Of course, it could also just be growing pains of a new place. Either way, the wait was not excessive. Other than that, we found the employees pleasant &amp; eager to help. As mentioned above, the young lady taking our order had a hard time hearing the distinction between &#34;broaster&#34; and &#34;broasterie&#34; as it is quite loud in that spot of the space. However, she was diligent to make sure she heard correctly to prevent an order being entered incorrectly. As we ate, we were twice checked on to make sure everything was good. Overall a good experience from a team of young folks just getting their legs under them!

We will definitely be back!"

Parking is great. I don&#39;t think that I was able to connect to their wi-fi, but I won&#39;t hold it against them.  I will try again if there is a next time.

I had a salad.  There was more than plenty of lean chicken on top and lots of lettuce and other salad ingredients. The dressing was fine, and the overall effect was certainly good. It was a much appreciated change from my usual Jason&#39;s Deli routine, which has served me well.

I wish that I could share more about their broasted chicken, but I have yet to try it.

For $8, I had the chicken tortilla soup and the santa fe chicken salad, both were delicious.  Soup (which is actually in a bowl, not the typical cup size) is served with a little &#34;flair&#34;- avacado, sour cream and tortilla strips garnish the bowl.  It is also served with a slice of garlic toast...a bit more fun than an ordinary roll.
The salad is: seasoned pulled chicken, romaine, red and green onions, roasted corn, diced tomatoes, pinto beans, tortilla strips, cilantro, Chili Lime Vinaigrette, and Monterey Jack cheese- with a drizzle of Chipotle Ranch.
Hubby had the corn chowder/soup and 1/2 sandwich- which he said was very good...the chicken was nice and moist- not dry like most chcken sandwiches are.  Together we spent $16 (no drinks.)
Though I don&#39;t usually like to spend that much on lunch, it&#39;s a nice alternative to Panera.  (It just pissed me off the last time I ate at Panera , the same meal (1/2 soup 1/2 salad, no drink) cost me almost $10!!   That place is so umimpressive to me.)

Anyway- back to Kick&#39;s. The menu is great, the place is clean, the food comes quickly- and on cute dishes, not the cheap melamine/&#34;cafeteria&#34; crap Panera serves food on- and the food is tasty.  What&#39;s not to like?

1/15-
OK- I have to admit that I am ADDICTED!  
I&#39;ve gone back 3 times in the last week just for that amazing Santa Fe salad!!!

I had heard about Kicks opening and had driven by many times but was only now able to stop in and try it.  I thought the food was fresh but portions small for the prices.  Chicken was okay but not outstanding.  Service, average.  This is a fast-casual restaurant where you seat yourself and place a number on your table so that the staff can find you when they bring your food out.  Nice place to sit and chat with a friends.  I would come by again if I&#39;m in the area and want chicken but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way."

I had the two piece broasted meal with Mac and cheese and DH had the chicken pesto sandwich with apple slices as a side. I don&#39;t know why everyone is complaining about the size of the chicken, I thought it was appropriately sized so it didn&#39;t dry out in the cooking process. The chicken was flavorful and the skin was crispy and not greasy. My Mac and cheese was quite tasty and again, the portion size was appropriate. 

DH&#39;s sandwich was quite large and contained quite a bit of chicken, spinach, tomatoes and pesto mayo. The sandwich was not served with the apples we ordered, just the chips. When we asked about the apples, the server brought a bag of apples like you would get in a kids meal. I noticed that the receipt I got was not itemized, which would be useful in a case like this.  However, the sever did not flinch when we asked about the apples and brought them with a smile and an apology.

Not sure why everyone seems to be complaining about the prices.  Our two meals with two drinks came right to $20.00, which seemed completely reasonable to me for what we got. 

We will definitely be back."

Got the Broasted chicken, all dark meat with a piece of garlic bread and mac and cheese.  All was very tasty, delivered hot and full of flavor.  Pieces were the right size one would expect.  And the service is as good as you can get.  

Spoke with the manager and asked for a sample of an additional side and was accommediated.  Cole slaw was excellent too. Seems everything is prepared fresh in house.  This is not a chain, first location.  There is a lack of chicken focused restaurants in the area, there is either Boston Market or Popeyes, whom I both like, but now Kicks is my new fave.

I wanted to make sure this place gets an excellent current review so enough other people will try it out so I sticks around.   I plan to bring the rest of my family and share my feedback with my friends and family.  

Good luck Kicks staff!!"

Had the white meat of which there is a $2 up charge that surprised me.  Although it does say &#34;additional cost for white meat&#34; on the menu.  The onion  straws were tasty.    So for a $13 I wasn&#39;t sure it was worth it. That might be because I&#39;m a frequenter of Popeyes and for $5-$8 I think I get the same quality if chicken. So if the sides and real china are worth $5 to you, then this might be your place.    Might come back to try a salad, maybe there&#39;s no up charge for that."

My husband ordered a 3 piece dark meat broasterie with mac &amp; cheese, and I ordered a 2 piece white meat broasterie with onion straws. Our total with 1 small drink (the sprite was flat in the fountain drink dispenser) was $20, which was pretty pricey for what we ordered.  It took awhile for our food to come out, about 15 minutes, but at least the restaurant was a nice place to wait. I liked the simple and modern decor.

The server who brought out our food was pleasant and friendly. I think the plates were a little slippery though, as some of our chicken pieces slid onto the table when he was putting the plates down (we didn&#39;t really care). My first thought when the food came out was that the chicken pieces were TINY! Thank goodness I paid the extra 1$ for a white meat piece, which was slightly bigger than the rest of the pieces we received, but it was still a ridiculously tiny chicken breast, maybe from a cornish hen or a pigeon?

Size of the chicken aside, the food was pretty good. The chicken was flavorful and juicy and the mac &amp; cheese and onion straws were good (the side dishes were good portion sizes). I also enjoyed the &#34;kicks sticks,&#34; which was one piece of garlic bread - it&#39;s a slightly confusing name, since it sounds like it would be french fries.

Right before we left, a child walked up and gave a tip to one of the servers, and we over-heard the server telling one of his co-workers about it, as well as making a comment about his paycheck. Not a huge deal, but maybe save that talk for a place a little further away from customers.

Overall, our experience was alright. The price was WAY too high for the amount of food that we got. I did see some people that ordered sandwiches, and those looked a little more decently sized. If the prices were lowered and/or portion sizes upped, I might come back at some point in the future."

First thing the service and staff were not very customer friendly. We decided to try it for the first time upon entering we were met by a long line of customers not sure when to stand in line a the procedure for ordering. We saw a booth that needed cleaning and proceeded over to it and asked someone if they could clean it. We had menus in hand and were deciding on what to order when after 5 minutes a guy came by and started to clean it but said we couldn&#39;t sit there unless we had our order already. He told us to get back in line. At that point the line had grown but we did . The next thing we see are people now coming in after us heading to the booth and other tables sitting down without their food doing what we had attempted and nothing being said since the person who told us to get back in line was engaged in a conversation with fellow workers. I guess that&#39;s why it&#39;s called Kicks. Their customer service really sucks and they more or less Kick you out! Not a friendly place! Won&#39;t be back...

The service was good each time I went. This time I had the Wisconsin cheddar fries with scallions, now I love cheese but these were almost too cheesy for me, I just didn&#39;t love them. 

The deviled eggs were pretty good. I like that you can just buy 3 for $3. That is a fair price and worth it, especially when you just want a few of them. 

I think for the size of the burger patty that the burger is over priced. It was good but I just wasn&#39;t amazed. I really like the bun that they used, it doesn&#39;t feel like you are eating pointless carbs. 

I think if you create your own burger you are likely to be disappointed or not that impressed. I would suggest if you are a plain burger type of person then this is not the place for you. I&#39;m sure their menu crafted burgers are great. I like that they are very original and they have different burgers for a special that month.

We stopped here after not being impressed with the choices at the oak brook mall. This is definitely a fun hip restaurant. There is a cool little bar when you first walk in, and then the dining area. It was not too busy when we went which was nice. The menu is pretty extensive, there are a lot of choices. I was super pumped to try fries because they looked so good on yelp, but unfortunately the fries are cooked in beef fat and I am a vegetarian. Luckily our server told us that if I got the sweet potato fries and asked for them to be cooked in canola oil then they would be vegetarian. So I ordered that!
I ended up getting the number 12, which is the normal veggie burger option. The veggie patty was fantastic. I also added an egg, and I think that might have been a tad overpowering, but otherwise it was good. The burger was huge! I didn&#39;t completely finish it. Though I did come close. My sister got a burger with onion rings but substituted a veggie patty and it was very yummy, I tried it! Everything on the menu is a la carte which makes things more expensive but oh well haha. The fries I was able to get were really sweet, had a different taste to them but I liked it. The lemon aioli it came with was very tasty as well.

I&#39;ll just say, DMK knew how to bring it on...

Excellent burger.  Excellent fresh-cut fries.  Excellent house made Blood Orange Soda. Excellent Server...everything was....Excellent..

It all started with our fantastic Server.  He immediately asked if we&#39;d been here before, and since this was our first visit, he took the time to explain EVERYTHING...how the burgers are prepared, portion sizes, differences between the burgers, BOTD, answered my soda questions. All around awesome guy.

Space is more intimate and I always dig intimate.  Trendy, modern-ish décor with dim lighting...Like Kuma&#39;s, they also had music, just not of the Rock variety and not quite as loud.  Smallish bar is located to your left when you walk in..

I was prepared to get adventurous with the Black Hawks burger (grass fed grilled w/buffalo sauce).  Server almost had me convinced, but at the last minute (I do that all the time) I decided to go with the familiar and got the #4 double.  Fried egg, Sonoma Jack Cheese, smoked bacon &amp; roasted hatch green chile (on side).  Friend went with the #8 single. Burger with standard toppings $9.50.  He asked how we wanted our burgers prepared.

We split two small orders of fries.  Cheddar &amp; scallion and Truffle Parmesan cream. $4.50 for small order.  Easily enough for two, but while she craved cheddar, I needed truffle. Truffle fries were ridiculously good...topped with a heaping amount of shaved parmesan.
The best part?  THE TRUFFLE CREAM.  It makes the fresh-cut fries. Truffle is in the cream and its addicting. No point in getting this if you don&#39;t like truffle or your not gonna dip your fries in it..

Everything came out HOT and timely.  I absolutely LOVED my blood orange soda (you can add alcohol too). I was told it was tart and he wasn&#39;t lying. it was the most refreshing soda I&#39;ve ever had. Lip smacking good. Just a hint of sweet. If you love tart drinks, GET IT. I had my friend try it, and it wasn&#39;t sweet enough for her...This is one of 4 house made sodas they offer. $3. I&#39;m trying the Pineapple Basil next time...

The Burger. It looked mighty fine. It exceeded our expectations. After our first bite, we both looked at each other grinning from ear to ear like two silly food obsessed girls...We were in hamburger bliss...ooohhing and ahhhhing over our burgers. Juicy patties, egg was perfectly fried and oozing yummy yolkiness.  Thick sliced bacon, gooey cheese.
AND the hatch green chile?  It was the icing on the burger...mild kick.. Burger is not as thick as Kuma&#39;s and who cares! It was juicy and tasty and the circumference exceeded the bun...and speaking of this BUN...

It made the burger. Puts all other hamburger buns to shame...No exaggeration.  They use Potato buns which look more like bakery quality rolls. We were told people ask about them all the time and they can&#39;t give out their supplier, but they get them daily.  It was soft and fresh, yet hearty enough to stand up to all the toppings.  In fact, I may never have a pretzel roll again, just the thought makes me go &#39;ick&#39;..

I couldn&#39;t finish my burger and took home half.  It was the best burger experience I&#39;ve had since Kuma&#39;s (my experience there was very low on the totem pole).  While Kuma&#39;s burgers come with fries, here they are ala carte.  In the end, you will pay about the same if not less for a burger, fry and drink...My double was $14.50 vs. single $10.50.

Props to our very cute, curly haired Server (if only I could remember his name)...He made our experience that much more burgalicious..and was easy on the eyes too..I&#39;ll be back..."

I went with my friend on our day trip to the Oakbrook Mall. I was craving a really good burger and DMK did not disappoint. The inside is a bit smaller than I had thought, but it created an intimate vibe which is perfect when you are catching up with a friend. They played some decent tunes as background music which is always welcome. 

My friend and I both ordered the number 3. The fontina cheese and prosciutto was a perfect combination. The saltiness from the prosciutto and the creaminess of the cheese melded together to create a perfect bite. The bun was soft and light which paired nicely with the hearty burger. We got an order of parmesan fries with truffle cream. I really liked the cream. I thought it was a nice alternative to ketchup. The burger was the true star though. Next time I may try a shake with my burger because they look pretty darn good too. I guess I&#39;ll have to wear my stretchy pants!"

No wait on a Sunday night, but service was terrible. I think there was one waitress working. There were waiters or bartenders near the bar, but they didn&#39;t really do much other than seat us. The waitress took forever to take our drink order, and she also took too long to refill our drinks. I would give the service two stars.
The food was just okay. I have been waiting to try this place after seeing it in Chicago Trib as one of the best burgers a few years ago. It was supposedly as good as Kuma&#39;s Corner back then. These burgers are a lot different - they are much thinner and the buns are different, so you can&#39;t really compare the two (but if you could, Kuma&#39;s is hands down a better burger). The burgers here were just okay. They don&#39;t ask you how you want it cooked. We tried the #4 which has green chilis on it. It was good, but would have been better if they just had a plain/regular burger or the ability to customize your burger. I didn&#39;t see that on the menu. For $10 or whatever, the burger felt like a rip off compared to other places like Kuma&#39;s, Burger Antics (in Brookfield), or even Small Cheval/Au Cheval, etc. The fries were also really small for $4 and my husband didn&#39;t like the lemon dipping sauce that came with them (tasted like a lemon dessert). The mac and cheese was the best part of the meal, but it was somewhat small and my husband felt like it was missing salt or something. We won&#39;t be returning. There are way too many other better burger places to go to both in the city and in the suburbs, especially with Burger Antics so close by."

The menu is simple in that it&#39;s mostly burgers but they&#39;re all unique with quality ingredients. My favorite is Burger #4, which features bacon, green chilies, and a fried egg.

I walked in and the bartender invited me to sit down at the bar with open arms. It sucks that I couldn&#39;t order a beer because I was on my lunch but I was very satisfied with the burger I had ordered. It was the #1 and had aged cheddar, smoked bacon, charred balsamic red onion and Rufus Teagues BBQ sauce and it was delicious. It came out very quick. The buns were very soft and the grass fed beef was very juicy. Definitely top quality. Will definitely return to try out the rest of their menu."

I am not sure how - but we got a really awful meal. We went based on the over 550 reviews, most reviews were 4 star and all the awesome photos.... Wtf?  If a burger is going to run in the $12 - $15 ranch, you would of expected top shelf.  

We had a table of three.  The server did not ask us how we want our burger.  We get what we get, I suppose.  We all went with Bison.  Each patty was thick, but small.  In fact, it looked like it needed to be squished a little bit as the patty did not fit the bun.   Mine came out without the egg.   My buddy&#39;s came out with the totally wrong burger, hence he waited 10 minutes for a new plate to be made, we were finished eating.

Cheddar Scallion Fries - came out cold.  Second version had so little Cheddar, that is was more like plain fries.  Truffle Parmesan fries, just fries with shredded parm on top, add truffle sauce and you have soggy fries.   We are fries eaters, but could only manage to eat half of both.

Nothing went well and the server apologized, the manager did take off the Cheddar Scallion fries, nice of him, but it still was really bad."

I am a vegetarian and its sometimes is kinda hard trying to find a place where both my friends and i will both enjoy (since they arent vegetarians). None the less this place has many different burger options. Aswell as vegetarian paties you can even choose a bunless burger. Just substitute the buns for portabello mushroom buns instead. All in all the food wash delicious. Their fresh cut fries with homemade ketchup! However, if I had anything to &#34;complain&#34; about is that they charge $3 extra for a veggie patty. When clearly a veggie patty is less than a burger made of grass fed beef. Still will defenetly come back here! Awesome food! Great service. Highly recomend this place to EVERYBODY!"

This is my favorite place to get a gourmet burger.

I came here with a coworker for lunch.  I&#39;ve been here only twice.  They have a great selection of burgers.  Today they had a special: The Northsider.  It was a grass fed beef patty, topped with a portabella mushroom, crispy bacon and other ingredients that I forgot about because they fused together.  The bread is heavenly.  Soft and perfect!  And a side of their parmesan fries.  AMAZING!!!!! Cool fun fact: this was their special since they offer it when the Cubs are playing at home in Chicago.  

The place is beautifully decorated.  Very modern and has industrial decor.  So clean and I love that their staff are super friendly and dress totally casual. Our waiter was hilarious and helpful.  This is a place where you feel comfortable.  Even though it can be pricey, it&#39;s definitely worth it.  I will be back with my army of friends and family."

My boyfriend and I go on a Friday or Saturday before dinner rush hour (around 4 or 5) and we sit at the bar. We never have to wait and by now, the bartenders recognize us. We usually split a patty melt and a large order of Parmesan truffle fries, which by the way, are &#34;to die for&#34;! HA!  The patty melt is one of the best I&#39;ve ever had, add those truffle fries to them and you&#39;ll be back for more. 

I&#39;ve also tried the Big DMK Triple Decker which to me tastes like a big mac. Last time we were there, my boyfriend decided to try their Roasted Hatch Green Chile, the menu claimed it was a side but he got a whole bowl of it. It was DELICIOUS! Not something I would expect at a burger bar. 

DMK has won me over. The bartenders are awesome, they have a GREAT beer list and once in a while we get a little &#34;love&#34; (a drink) on them.

I am a meat lover, but I decided to try out their crispy portabello mushroom burger. Hands down the GREATEST meat-free burger I have ever tasted. I highly recommend this burger to anyone who wants to try something new and/or any vegetarians out there.

My 1st visit, I ordered the scallion cheese fries, deviled eggs, and a burger medium with their chipotle ketchup and blue cheese. 

The fries were cold and soggy and the cheese was luke warm. The burger was dryer than dry! I couldn&#39;t even eat it. Their patties are flat and hard as a rock. And the chipotle ketchup just tasted like....ketchup. As for the artisan blue cheese....you mean 4-5 tiny crumbles with no taste? Not impressed. So NOT worth the $30 lunch I paid for.

The only thing I actually liked were the deviled eggs. I got those to-go a couple weeks later. Those were still good but the food I got was colder than cold. And 2oz of cheese for a large cheese fry? Seriously. Another expensive and disappointing visit. $15 for cold fries and deviled eggs.

The service however is nice and very fast. The place has a modern look with some great craft beers. But the food.....yikes."

It will curb your appetite, but it&#39;s likely you&#39;ll leave feeling overly full and heavy. The meat has a different seasoning than most places I&#39;ve tasted, and I can&#39;t say I love it.

The atmosphere is great for hanging out.  The music they play is loud enough to hear but doesn&#39;t overpower your conversation.  The decor in the place is also very nice. 

As for food, I ordered the #3.  This burger came with a ton of prosciutto, which tasted great, and it was cooked perfectly.  I was pleasantly surprised at how juicy this burger was.   One of my favorite parts about it was the bun.  Whenever I get a burger somewhere, I usually and up with a large part of the bun on my plate since most places tend to overdo it.  However, the bun for this burger fit it perfectly and was very light and tasty. 

I also tried the parmesan and truffle butter fries.   These were also very delicious.   The fries themselves would have been great even without the parm and truffle, but those did really add the extra elements that made it really worth getting. 

The service was very good during this visit.   We were greeted the moment we walked in and our server was friendly, but not overly so.   Our food came pretty fast and it felt like a short wait for the food that I ordered to-go as well.

I used to frequent the Evanston location (which also had fish sandwiches) until it closed, and now go to this one or one of the few in Chicago. Absolutely must go! I&#39;ve tried dozens of these kinds of upscale burger joints and this takes the cake. DMK has extremely creative, delicious burgers with a variety of flavors, high quality hand cut fries, and some tasty sides to boot.

It wasn&#39;t too busy when we arrived for early dinner, and service was attentive. 

I had the burger with egg, bacon, and green chilis and enjoyed it very much. The real standout, though, was the side we chose based on Angus W&#39;s amazing, drool-inspiring photo. Fries with blue cheese and bacon mmm. We will be returning just for those. Their fries are so well done...flavorful and just the right amount of crispness.

My only disappointment was that the toasted marshmallow milkshake I&#39;d been oogling via Yelp was a monthly special and not something I could order when I happened in. Oh wait, also? The lettuce &#34;wrap&#34; we ordered for our burgers was not a wrap but more of a lettuce over and underlay.

The quality of their grass fed meat really shines through, and the toppings on their burgers go well together.

I&#39;ve had the blue cheese and bacon fries, and although it is a heart attack waiting to happen, they are a must if you like bacon and blue cheese together. 

As far as drinks are concerned, they have a nice list of craft beers for beer lovers and also a decent selection of cocktails. Last time I had this really smooth cocktail with absinthe in it of all things and I would get that drink again for sure. 

I&#39;ve been to this restaurant on both a Saturday night and a Monday night. I think two of us waited about 30 minutes on the Saturday night, and then didn&#39;t have to wait on the Monday night.

But I had to save room for their awesome milkshakes.  I&#39;m glad I did, because they were awesome - probably the star of the show, after an already all-star lineup of good eats.  The food was so good, I almost forgot about their awesome selection of beers, and the really good service.  I&#39;m definitely coming back to DMK to try more of their burgers, beers, and shakes!"

But I was dining solo and opted for the bar where I was treated like a queen.  

Their beer selection isn&#39;t super huge, but it&#39;s a nice selection so whether you like IPA&#39;s (yuck), Hefeweizens, Ales, Lagers, there is something for everyone. It&#39;s always changing too. The day I visited they had my new favorite summer beer 21st Amendment&#39;s Come Hell or High Watermelon which the bartender poured into a frosty pint glass for me...nice!

The menu boasts grass fed beef burgers, but you can choose to have your burger turkeyfied or bison-ed, or portobello-ed if you don&#39;t want a beef patty.  I chose the the Number 8--Iceberg Lettuce, Marinated Tomato, Pickled Red Onion,Bread &amp; Butter Pickles, Mayo, with American Cheese.  Looks pretty basic, but the flavors of the toppings made it really tasty. A bit sweet from the pickles, a bit vinegary from the pickled red onion.  And the beef was really good quality.  I opted for a small side of truffle fries and they were stellar as well. Crispy fries topped with some shredded parmesan and served with a truffle aioli for dipping. No crumbs left there.   

I wanted something sweet to take to go and their shake did not disappoint.  They have the usual chocolate and strawberry options, but I opted for their seasonal flavor--toasted marshmallow.  Holy campfire flame--this was perfect. Great toasted flavor and lots of creamy ice cream and marshmallow throughout.  Shame that it&#39;s only around for summer....I&#39;d get it boozefied the next time it&#39;s available.  

Shout-out to my pals Michele S and Danielle S.  Both came to my rescue quickly when I was looking for suggestions on a good burger place and I&#39;m so glad I went with their recommendation for DMK. They are avid Yelpers and if you don&#39;t know them, well you should cuz they know what they are talking about!"

It&#39;s a small place, and that isn&#39;t bad.  A bit too noisy for me, but since I was alone talking to someone wasn&#39;t an issue.  I heard the burgers were good so that&#39;s what I ordered.  The burger tasted fine and I liked the bun.  The fries we good and they are hand cut daily.  I have no complaint about the food or the service.  However, paying a bit over 20 bucks with tip for a plain burger, fries and a soft drink with tip is a bit much.  If it had been a half pound burger I&#39;d have been happy, but it was five ounces before cooking.  Heck, even Five Guys gives you 6.6 ounces.  I consider the flavor slightly below Five Guys.  I think the reason Five Guys tastes better is because their burger is a combination of Sirloin and Chuck, while DMK is straight Chuck."

Burgers were really tasty but the buns were a kinda gritty due to the flour but had great texture and bite.  Fries were top notch.  Went during beer week and they had some tasty guest brews on tap.  Just a bit of sticker shock when the bill came prevented 5 stars.  No kids menu probably upped the price but this should probably be expected when &#34;bar&#34; is in the title.

Leave the kids at home and go for a few beers and a good burger."

The location in the city is plays music at a volume more suitable to a Skrillex concert than a burger joint. Because we couldn&#39;t hear each other we just ate our burgers in painfully awkward disengagement. 

At this location the music is still loud but not bone shatteringly so. The service was speedy and friendly. 

The real standout was the Big DMK (their version of the Big Mac). It was so good I wanted to smack someone. The meat was delicious, the sauce was made of unicorn tears, and the buns (triple decker a la the original) were warm and handled the burger like the champions they are. 

I&#39;m so so on the fries here, but the burgers are standout enough to justify 5 stars."

However, because of the service, I can&#39;t rate this location more than 3 stars. 

Our server, Abi, started out fairly attentive.
She delivered us water with no ice in the glass, which I thought was strange. Once she took our drink and food orders, the service went downhill FAST. We put in an order of fries as an appetizer for the table, and she brought us something we did not order. Not a huge deal, mistakes happen. As we were enjoying our cocktails, Abi came up to our table and literally threw our check at the table and walked off without saying a word. We were not even close to being finished, and we were planning on ordering more drinks. The way she approached the table and threw the receipt was so rude and offensive, as a server myself I could never imagine acting that way toward a table. 

Our beer glasses sat empty at the edge of the table for at least 5-10 minutes, Abi looked at our empty glasses multiple times without asking if we wanted another round. When I went to look for her to tell her we weren&#39;t planning on leaving anytime soon, I saw her sitting at a table in the back of the restaurant on her phone. Again, as a server myself, to find out we are getting terrible service and trying to be pushed out of the restaurant sooner because Abi wanted to be on her phone was unacceptable.

When we were finally ready to check out, Abi informed us we could not split the check, which we understand is a restaurant policy and not her fault, but you think she would know to inform us of this when first being seated so we could plan accordingly. We then decided we would all pay cash for our $130 bill, when we asked her if they had an ATM, she had no idea whether or not they did or not, which they don&#39;t. If you plan on coming her with a group, plan accordingly. No splitting checks and there&#39;s no ATM.

Overall, this place has amazing food and drinks. We will definitely be returning because we love this place, but hopefully will not be waited on by Abi again. Hopefully her manager can provide her with a little insight on how she should and shouldn&#39;t act around tables."

I am happy to identify areas that need addressing/improvement.  Maybe part of the problem was that it was a Sunday, Sundays seem to be an off day at many places.
It is a tiny place and there happen to be a very large party that took up ALL the seating along the right hand wall.  That leaves very limited seating for others.  Our table was next to and looking at the bussing station.  I am not a fan at looking at dirty dishes while I am trying to enjoy a meal.  Temperature of the room was on the chilly side, the single TV was not positioned for the enjoyment of the dining area.  There is a small bar area to the left upon entry.
Now the food.  Since we had never been here before, our server went over the menu in one breath ~ so fast, I did not get any better understanding than just reading it myself.   So a party of 5 must be a big party.  Our food came out piecemeal and it was not even warm.  I think the burger would have been delicious if it had been much warmer.  The fries were soggy and cold.  And the small plate the burger came out on was hardly big enough to hold the burger.  Serve on bigger plates, please !!  The chocolate shake one person in our party ordered was really thick and looked yummy.
The comfort stations are single person only, so wait in line.  That is a problem during a game when the dining room is crowded.
I want a 5-star experience like many other people seem to get.
Parking lot is very crowded because of the number of eateries in close proximity.
The music playing in the background was obviously for much younger people than us.  It was on the loud side.  Call me old fashioned, but I enjoy hearing what others at the table have to say.  Not conversation friendly."

I ordered the cheddar and Scallion fries which I was questioning because of the Scallions, but ended up loving. The soda options are also awesome and different, the Blood Orange soda was not overly sweet. Lastly, the burger I ordered had Fontina cheese and Truffle cream which was very delicious and was the perfect portion. I like that the portions here were not out of control. The only thing I found was that the patty kinda tasted it bit like sausage. Other than that I would definitely return here. This place is not your standard burger bar and offers new and exciting choices for burgers. Nice decor as well."

We&#39;d both had DMK bookmarked for a while, so chose it for a dinner date last night.

We walked in near the bar area but weren&#39;t sure about seating. We were greeted, though, so service from the beginning was friendly. 

The space is dim but modern with minimal decor. We sat at one of the many booth/chair combos. The beer/drink list is extensive and covers the entire backside of the menu. They don&#39;t offer drink specials, or there weren&#39;t any last night.

We ordered:
Truffle fries with parmesan ($4.5 sm)
Fried okra and pickles ($5)

Me: #11 (Lamb burger with feta - $10.5)
Him: #5 (Bison - $11.5)

Total: $34 before tip

The fries were ok, but a bit overdone. The parm on top was nice (shaved/grated), but didn&#39;t melt onto the fries at all.  The mayo was tasty. The okra and pickles were alright.

There is a note at the top of the menu that states that the beef is from grass fed cows. (Yay for happy cows!)

My burger was good - it was cooked to my liking (medium). I&#39;m glad it had some nice toppings, especially the feta. We both REALLY liked the buns themselves - soft and fresh with a pillowy top. The burnt insides of my bun was kind of a bummer, though.

His burger, by comparison, was flat and sad looking. It had a crust (smooshed down while cooking), but IMO was also a bit overdone. We thought maybe it was a plain hamburger until we located the cheese underneath.

Like I mentioned, service was good. We had a few people (aside from our server) who brought out our food and checked on us.

The burgers are a la carte, so I&#39;d expect them to be pretty fab for the $11 price tag. They were GOOD, but I probably wouldn&#39;t go out of my way for another visit."

Fries were well portioned and tasted great! Price was good but food was beyond better quality than any typical burger chain restaurant. 4 stars!

The place is pretty big. We were seated immediately by a nice guy. Our waitress came around right away. I will say that they have really great customer service skills. There were lots of workers walking around.

As far as the food... We don&#39;t really care for special &#34;foo-foo&#34; burgers as we call them. DMK has special burgers. We weren&#39;t too into them but why not try it out. I got their special which was a grass fed burger dipped in Buffalo sauce, with cut celery and onion strings on it. It was really good! The burgers are huge. Be warned. You probably won&#39;t finish it. I didn&#39;t. My husband had the #1. He said it was good. 

But the fries were the best part of the meal. We had the large Wisconsin cheese and green onion fries and a small of the Parmesan truffle fries. Both were fantastic!! The cheese fries were amazing! Gooey and cheesy. This was probably the best part of the meal. The parm fries were good too. Topped with tons of fresh parm and a truffle sauce for the dipping. 

The only complaint we had is that we couldn&#39;t build our own burger (that we knew of). But the ingredients were amazing. We would go back only if we could boils our own burger which is what we like."

The service was fast and friendly, drinks were refilled in a timely manner, and the food arrived fast.

I had the #9 patty melt and we split an order of the sea salt and black pepper fries.  The burger was cooked to a perfect medium, and the caramelized  red onions were done to perfection.  The sauce was a little light (personal preference is for the sauce to drop out the sides of the burger as you pick it up or bite into it).  Overall a tasty burger.  The fries were really good too.  Nice and crispy heavily seasoned with the salt and pepper and served with a house made ketchup that had a little spice to it.

Our interactions with her felt brief/rushed and infrequent.  However, being a server myself, I can chalk it up to the fact that it was a Sunday and/or everybody has an off day.

It was one of those long days at work which began with unwashed hair, wearing a shirt I&#39;ve owned since 2008 thrown together with whatever else was clean, and a day that ended with make-up that made my face feel like an oil slick.  I felt grungy.  When I got home, I did not want to cook dinner.  I didn&#39;t want to primp either.  We needed something casual and quick, so we headed over to DMK.

The restaurant has low lighting and exposed brick walls.  It&#39;s trendy, pretty, and perhaps a touch of hipster.  I will forever be grateful for the low lighting; this little greaseball fit right in.

I came on a Friday night with Dominic P, and we waited maybe 20 minutes for a table.  Meanwhile, we sat at the bar and perused the beer and cocktail list.  I had the DMK margarita, which was the best margarita I have had in a long time.  This was a real margarita, not some slush out of a machine.

The burgers are great!  I had the &#34;#5,&#34; a bison burger with goat cheese, pickled red onions, and blueberry BBQ sauce.  DMK will cook burgers either medium, or well, with nothing inbetween.  I went with well, and it did not disappoint as the burger was not at all overcooked.  The patty was thin, so if you&#39;ve got a large appetite, you might want to go with the double.

We shared the parmesan truffle cream fries.  Best damn truffle fries I have had in quite some time, right along with that margarita.  It&#39;s 50 cents extra for extra sauce, which of course we needed, and it&#39;s only 50 cents, but ughhhh why must places do this?

We also shared a chocolate shake with Bailey&#39;s, but they will make your shake with any alcohol you choose.  The shakes are thick, and they definitely don&#39;t skip on the liquor.

It is a little bit more expensive than some burger places, but the food is worth every penny.  Everything we had was very good.

DMK is a trendy spot for a casual date night, but it is noisy in here, so don&#39;t plan on having any deep, philosophical conversations."

My son and I don&#39;t get much time together, what with the new baby and work etc.. so this seemed like a good time to go do something.. (amazingly.. both wives felt this was a good thing.. us spending time together)

Angus 4 got the Burger #1 with an extra patty and fried egg.. he asked for no red onions and was granted that wish gracefully..  He loved it.. it comes with BBQ sauce

I, Angus 3 (me) got Burger # 7  which is their triple decker and kind of makes fun of the McDonalds Big Mac.. (comes with special sauce) I got mine with some thick, delicious bacon.. yum!

We got the sharing portion of their blue cheese and bacon fries, we loved them but found that they were a bit heavy on the blue cheese in the middle.. kind of messes with the sharing thing.. Next time I would just get my own.

These are excellent burgers. But not cheap at $9.50 - $12.00 ala carte. I don&#39;t mind paying for a really good burger, so no biggie.. but to put it in perspective.. this is about the same pricing as the most awesome Au Cheval in Chicago

I ordered the Bison Burger Fresh Goat Cheese, Pickled Red Onions, Blueberry BBQ Sauce w/ extra patty. The burger was nothing special considering its $15 tag. The toppings were really good but under garnished. I could barely taste the miniscule amount on both pattys. Common sense would dictate, if you double the meat, double the good stuff. My wife&#39;s $11 cob salad was again, nothing special. The only thing that saved this meal was the a la carte sweet potatoe fries &amp; Wisconsin cheddar fries. They do have a great beer selection. I ordered one. Somehow our bill w/ tax &amp; tip was $51. Not a chance I return unless for drinks. Better burgers elsewhere."

Had the Champion burger and the fried chicken counterpart.  Cook on the chicken was questionable.  Lots of gristle, too. No flavor.  Burger was better. Cook on burger was perfect.  Both these sandwiches had TOO much sauces (buffalo and bleu cheese). You could not taste the protein. 

And the fries...nothing spectacular although they made a big deal about them being cooked in beef fat.  We had the parmesan and truffle cream fries and the Amish Bleu Cheese and bacon.  The P+TC fries were more of a fries covered in parmesan cheese covered in truffle salad dressing as opposed to the twist on poutine that I was expecting.  The truffle cream was completely overpowering.  The ABC and bacon had hardly any bacon and were absolutely slathered in bleu cheese dressing.

None of the flavors of the champions came through.

They DO have any amazing beer selection."

I ordered the #6 single Bison and I THINK it was well cooked and seasoned, I couldnt really taste the meat under all the bread and toppings mish mash. Seriously that was a VERY thin patty.

Fries were less than average ,limp and  bland texture. The bourgeois truffle sauce B.S. could not save it."

My Order: Chili rubbed onion strings, Sonoma jack cheese, fried farm egg, spicy chipotle ketchup, charred balsamic red onions, chipotle aioli, fresh baked bun, and a medium grass-fed beef patty. 

Comments: 8/10. 
Presentation was average for a gourmet burger but colorful. Protein was fresh, cooked to a perfect medium. Onion strings were warm and crunchy. Eggs were a perfect over easy. Only thing I would change is more seasoning on the patty, it wasn&#39;t consistent. Service was quick. Ambiance was too dark for my taste."

Their servers usually have tried the menu and can advise what is good. All the different fry choices are awesome. I recommend the larger order to share.  
Since the burger choices are so great, I have sadly not tried the salad offerings but good burgers means I can find a salad elsewhere.  It is dark inside and can be loud during evening hours. We have experienced longer waits but that is usually because its good food!"

The shakes were highly recommended, but I didn&#39;t find anything special about them, especially for $6 - which is why I dropped a star. I&#39;m also not a fan of house cut fries because a lot of times, they are over cooked and greasy. These were better than most, but still not my favorite.

My party of 4 got seated immediately when we went for dinner around 8 PM on a Saturday night. I got the #4 (roasted hatch green chili) and I thought it was pretty darn good. It is the only burger with a fried egg in it so if you like burgers with egg, then you definitely have to try #4. I really enjoy their buns, warm and soft but it did get a little soggy towards the end of my meal.

My #4 had medium rare patty so warning if you don&#39;t like rare meat. It was juicy and the flavor was just right. Their fries were pretty good, too! Remember to get their house special ketchup! It has a spicy kick to it!

The service as exceptional and the price is quite reasonable, being about $10/burger.

The ambience is dimly lit and quite romantic. They were airing basketball games when I went and the noise level was tolerable, not too loud but not quiet either."

When I first entered I was actually surprised how small it was but we were greeted right away and had no problems being seated even though we arrived early. One of the members of our party was running late so we ordered drinks and the onion straws for a appetizer. The onion straws had a bit of spice but were the highlight of the meal. They tasted really good although I found the portion quite small. My sister and I polished them off really quickly. I also ordered the ginger soda for a drink. It was overly sweet and not worth the $4 they charged for it. What made things worse is they charged for refills at this price. Soda is cheap so felt ripped off that they charged $4 for a overly sweet drink that they didn&#39;t even refill. For dinner I ordered a cheese burger and my sister and I split the large order of cheddar fries. I was super disappointed with the cheese fries that they used a cheap nacho cheese instead of real cheese. I have had better cheese fries at White castle. The burger was also a big disappointment. It tasted ok but honestly you can get a much better burger at Portillios. This place isn&#39;t even close to Kuma&#39;s Korner, Alfies or Prime Burger at the grand vic. I was laughing because at first I thought they just brought a bun. Really disappointed."

What I love about DMK is its personality. The staff are very friendly, and dress in casual clothes and not uniforms. They are attentive, and your food comes out quick. This is a great choice for lunch or dinner- I could go both ways!

Any burger on the menu is going to be good. Blue cheese, bacon, fried egg, all of the above... take your pick!

My wife and I have been going here for years and our last experience was by far the best. The food was awesome as always and to quote my wife &#34;I&#39;d forgotten how good the fries are&#34;. Wisconsin cheddar with green onions.  The kicker came at the end when my wife presented our older rewards card which unbeknownst to us had been previously changed. We moved 40 miles away and hadn&#39;t been here in about a year due to distance but we did have quite a few points but they had no way to find out. We didn&#39;t ask for it and didn&#39;t expect it but because they were unable to verify how many points we had the management comped our meal. We didn&#39;t expect it but that is exactly what customer service is all about.  We have recommended DMK to many people over the years and will continue to do so. Great job everyone there! We will continue to patronize DMK as long as you are there.

- #4 Hatch Green Chili Burger (7/10)
- Peanut Butter Shake (9.9/10)

I&#39;ve been watching a lot of A&amp;E lately, which has a lot of house flipping shows, and I signed up for a presentation by one of those TV personalities at the nearby Westin. Well, apparently, I got up and drove my butt down here, only to find out, it&#39;s next week! ARGH! Well, I guess I was already here, and it was lunch time, so I decided to act like I was on a business trip (in my own city) and find an interesting eatery. 

I thought, &#34;Ooh! Boudin Bakery!&#34; Then I found out it&#39;s closed down. Crap! Now I REALLY need to stock up on sourdough next time I have a layover in SFO. Then I found DMK, and found that it&#39;s a Diners Drive Ins and Dives joint (the Chicago location). I think what I ordered would have probably been very different, had it not been for Yelp&#39;s mobile app, which is...lacking (gotta be careful of my word choices, or they might ban me forever), and I can&#39;t access the notes I typed in my bookmark, so I had to guess.

TRUFFLE FRIES
These are just medium size fries (think 5 Guys) with some shredded parmesan cheese on top, served with a truffle aioli dip. Truffle anything is a bit weird, because I feel like it plays tricks on your taste buds. At first bite, you start to think it&#39;s got this awesome butter-garlic type of taste, but after a few fractions of a second, the taste transforms. There is an ultra-light sense of bitterness that comes through, and then it does sort of taste mushroomy. I think the mushroomy part of it is what made you think it was butter, and the bitterness made you think it was garlic.

That all being said, if this was my first rodeo, I may have given it higher points, but I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to have had truffle fries and other truffle things enough to not be so intrigued by it anymore. When that happens, it becomes all about the subtle details that separate the men from the boys. In the case of these truffle fries, despite being shown on DDD, they&#39;re just average.

SWEET POTATO FRIES
I&#39;m so sick of sweet potato fries being on the buzz list of about every single restaurant that carriers them. If you ever watched Parks &amp; Recreation, sweet potato fries are like Lil&#39; Sebastian for me. I don&#39;t see why everyone&#39;s so moved by them. 

What slightly set these apart were their crispiness. Oh, and the dipping sauce, but that&#39;s not fair, because I dipped one of the parmesan fries in it, and that tasted good too! It&#39;s a lemon Tabasco aioli. Tabasco is a very very strong flavor, so it overpowers everything. This is not really any different. I&#39;d give it a &#34;Nice Try!&#34; rating, because in some very small ways, it kind of works, but in others, it&#39;s just lemony tabasco. Lucky for it, I love tabasco, so it wins!

DEVILED EGGS
I love deviled eggs! But these may have been the first that I wasn&#39;t so crazy about. There was nothing special about them, which is fine by me, except that they were lacking a bit in seasoning. Not something I&#39;d order here again.

#4 HATCH CHILI BURGER
This thing comes with roasted hatch green chili, jack cheese, bacon, and a fried egg. Again, had the Yelp bookmarks been usable, I wouldn&#39;t have ordered this, but I&#39;m not upset that I got this either. In general, their patties are a little thin (maybe about as thick as a McD Hamburger), but they make up for it in circumference! Much to an OCDer&#39;s delight, the size of the patty matches the size of the bun, and the bun is pretty wide. I&#39;d say it&#39;s about the size of a CD. Before you say, &#34;oh that&#39;s tiny!&#34; grab a CD and try take a bite and actually look at how small your bite is compared to the rest of the CD. The other great thing...the bun! The bun is fluffy and tastes flimsy, but that&#39;s exactly what I want! The meat is the star, not the bun! 

The meat was cooked medium, which I think is the only way it comes anyway. It&#39;s decently flavorful. It&#39;s definitely noticeable, but it&#39;s not overbearing. The toppings do complement the flavors well. The chili added a little heat and added some good and very light chili pepper flavors. This may be the first time where I actually thought a fried egg actually contributed! The chili&#39;s hot and the bacon&#39;s salty, and then this egg sorta acts as the mediator, so that the toppings, even with their spiky personalities, let the beef have a slightly louder voice. All in all, a very tasty and balanced burger. 

PB SHAKE
This should be illegal, but I&#39;m so glad it&#39;s not! Imagine peanut butter with the consistency of a milk shake. Yep, it&#39;s just like that! Probably heart stopping, but delicious! I love bad-for-you food, but this fits in a small category where I honestly feel sorry for my body afterwards!


DRINK MILK KINDLY (DMK)
Fell asleep coming up with a DMK word. Best I can do! I was a bit disappointed by the fries, considering all the hype, but the burger was decent. Want to try #1. NoMoSpace"

The bartender was great telling me all about the various beers on tap and lucky me! They had a witbier from Buckledown Brewery....one of my favorite types of beer + a local brewery for just $5.

Their deviled eggs are a steal! Three halves for $2. I&#39;ve had some weird obsession with deviled eggs and scotch eggs lately so was very happy I could satisfy that. My friend and I shared an order of small truffle fries. That truffle mayo! Holy goodness was it addicting. I&#39;m not a big fries person but I just couldn&#39;t stop eating the crack fries.

For my main dish I had the Mac &amp; Cheese #1 which is with aged cheddar &amp; a parmesan crust. No shame in the game of this noodle dish but not the best I&#39;d had. It&#39;s just $7 and though I&#39;m sure it&#39;s blasphemy at a burger shop, it is perfectly suitable as a main entree.

I told our waiter we were in a bit of a rush [to make a movie] and he was great about speeding things up for us - our food was in front of us in less than five minutes.

I liked the food at DMK quite a bit plus it&#39;s awesome they have a bar a single person could drink &amp; eat at, not to mention good beers on tap. I definitely have to go back and actually try their beef!"

We planned our trip to the area specifically so we could go here on a day and time that is normally slower than normal, due to their popularity.  They still had an impressive number of people dining there when we chose to go.

It was for my best friend&#39;s bachelorette party. All I gotta say is that I was disappointed. The reason why I gave them 4 stars is because I love going dancing on Tuesday&#39;s when they have salsa night, and the food is VERY good (I was born and raised in Mexico, I know my mexican food).
But I was truly disappointed with the customer service and lack of ambience.
I had booked the place for a Friday night to have dinner (buffet $20/person), get a private area for the party and get to dance to house music before the hip hop started at 10:30 pm.

When we got there at about 7:45, the place was empty (which I didn&#39;t mind because we did have games planned and wanted the bachelorette to be able to open her gifts). I waited until about 8:10 to inquire about the buffet. Once I talked to the girl (in charge??) she was very rude and told me buffet was supposed to be served at 7:30. I explained there was a lot of traffic and that&#39;s why we were a bit late. She was very snotty and mentioned that the kitchen closed at 9 pm... I reminded her that it was only 8:10... She continued to be rude and asked if we *really* wanted to eat dinner. I said yes, she continued to be rude, I reminded her that I had already paid for the deposit and two dinners. She mentioned that it didn&#39;t matter because sometimes people just didn&#39;t show up even after paying the deposit. 

Now, I don&#39;t see how their previous experiences with customers that don&#39;t show up is my problem... So I invited we were all very hungry and were expecting food. She walked away very very reluctantly to do her job.

I am not a difficult customer (I do work retail and in customer service, so I try to be as kind as possible when put in situations like this), but I thought this deserved a review on Yelp.

We ended up leaving at about 10 pm because there was NO music, not even background music... (The manager told me at about 9 pm, after having asked for music a couple of times, that their sound system was broken and we would have to wait until the DJ for ANOTHER event happening that night arrived...).

Needless to say, there was no dancing for us. What a shame.. A place known for its dancing atmosphere..."

Well we finally got our chance when a group from our Church decided to come here for a fun outing learning to dance salsa--it was fun!

I was very happy to see this expansion from Mexican Grille into Esteban&#39;s, a dance and dinner hall. There isn&#39;t much signage to identify Esteban&#39;s so look for the Mexican Grille and then a great big E to the right of it. That&#39;s Esteban&#39;s.

There are a few Puerto Rican and Mexican specialties for a quick nibble, but the food wasn&#39;t served hot and the selection you chose from is not as good as I would have preferred. Perhaps have a full meal before heading here and just order some items to share. I believe there is a cover charge if you&#39;re only here to dance vs. eat, but that may be worth it since the food isn&#39;t that exciting anyway. I did like my tostones, since I hadn&#39;t had some for a loooong time.

I enjoyed seeing more professional dancers do their thing from the sidelines after giving my salsa steps a little workout. After dancing a couple of times with your partner, you are then asked to switch partners, which can be daunting as practice levels vary from the very new (overly enthusiastic or dull) to the proficient instructor/dancer (knows their stuff, you&#39;re in good hands). It&#39;s as good a place for people watching as it is for dance lessons. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the music selection from the live DJ and the dance instruction. I had a good time and would love to come back again.

The parking lot can get a little full on snowy evenings. Margaritas the size of your head! Full bar is also available. The owner is very friendly and comes by to say hi and introduce himself. The staff is friendly but hard to get a hold of sometimes to get refills or order something."

It was my first time, but the teachers were funny and really clear with their instructions, plus there was a wide range of skill levels, so I felt comfortable being a newbie.  After the hour lesson, I danced basically the whole time!  I never waited around for a dance partner for more than a minute! It was so fun to dance with  experienced swing dancers.  I can&#39;t wait to go back and get better!

Tip for fellow females:  Wear a twirly skirt...it makes spinning way more fun!!"

I can&#39;t comment on the food because I just came to celebrate my friends birthday and enjoy a night dancing.  I&#39;m not much of a dancer, but I sure do enjoy watching.

There were free salsa dance lessons before opening the floor for open dancing.  The guy who was teaching was witty and of course a fabulous dancer.  The music was great, and they even had an actual dance-off.  Great fun!

I liked the crowd there that night.  It was a great mix of ages and cultures.  Nobody can feel out of place there.  There was another birthday that night...a regular named Dave.  Dave had a huge sheet cake, and shared with everybody in the place.

When we entered the door, there was nobody manning the booth where you were expecting to pay the cover. We walked around and a bouncer flagged us down and let us know the girl would be right back. Thankfully, he was professional about it and didn&#39;t insinuate that we weren&#39;t trying to pay.

As for the crowd that mostly frequents this place, it is late 20&#39;s thru 50&#39;s. There&#39;s a decent ratio of guys to gals, so finding a dance partner isn&#39;t that hard. Attached to the dance club is a small Mexican taquira, but they close early, so get your eats in before hitting the floor or prepare to stop elsewhere.

The dancing was a lot of fun and they have a large floor to practice your moves on. Our party had a good time there spinning around, however the music was too loud. You had to shout to be heard and even then, it wasn&#39;t a sure thing. The music should complement the dance, correct, not cause hearing damage!?

The bar portion of this club is unremarkable. The server did make a large mojito for $8 with fresh mint which was tasty, but extremely watered down. I could have been drinking Limeaid and not noticed the difference. Weak pours for a drink out in Naperville and still charging $8 seems spendy if you ask me. Parking can be hard to find at this place as well, so just be prepared if pay them a visit."

It is very expensive and very bland, in my opinion. HOWEVER.. we were there for the Salsa lessons which were very entertaining indeed.

There is a teacher Cinnamon (as another person pointed out, that is his actual name) who is fantastic at getting everyone involved and teaching you the steps slowly.. if you are like me, you still can&#39;t really dance but the point is fun, right?

You switch up partners a bit.. at first I wasn&#39;t so sure about this idea, but it was actually quite amusing to see how each person dances a bit differently. Some of those guys are pretty good at it and make it easy for a girl!

I brought a church group here.. would do so again but would probably organize elsewhere to eat ahead of time and just pay the cover $10 on saturday to get in the door.. I&#39;d rather spend $10 on the dancing than on the food.

The bartenders are good and friendly, but drinks aren&#39;t the cheapest.  If you go on Tuesday, they do have some specials that soften the blow.  If you go on a Saturday, the cover is $10, on Tuesdays it is $5 which is a little pricey considering that you can get it for the same or less at many clubs in the city which are much better.

For our large party of 15ish people, service started out great.  Two waiters greeted us, chatted us up, and took our drink orders quickly and efficiently, which may or may not have had to do with the fact that we were 1 of 2 tables occupying the restaurant at the time.  Great start.

...And it all went downhill from there.  The food took way too long to come out, something like 45 minutes, and with only a few tables dining in.  Strike one.  Not only that, but my rice was cold, and my sauteed chicken was lukewarm at best.  You take that long to produce the food, and it better be something worth enjoying.  The mojito tasted watered down.  Strike two.  A small entree portion definitely NOT worth $16, and we&#39;re at strike three.

But after our food arrived, the two waiters - who seemed to really occupy the roles of bartenders - literally disappeared and apparently tended at the bar for the remainder of the night.  What. the. hell.  It was nice that they originally offered to provide us split checks for our meals, but that was negated by having to hunt down personnel behind the bar to pay for our subpar meal.  Poor, poor organization, and since when have you ever dined somewhere and been left waiterless?   

The ups: free salsa lessons from 9-10pm with dinner reservations, and live music afterwards.

We were provided a gift certificate to Esteban&#39;s via Restaurant.com good until June of 2010.

We ordered a couple of drinks and appetizers; the place was pretty empty, its probably more for the dancing and music, but they bill themselves as a restaurant.    

The waitress was pleasant enough.   The food was not good.  Soggy quesadillas and bland empenadas.  I&#39;ve had much better empenadas for $1 in New Jersey.   

Then we tried to pay the bill.  The manager told us we can&#39;t use the certificate for $25; he said its under new ownership and they don&#39;t accept these.   He told us this is listed on their web site (its not).    Then he had the nerve to ask us for our certificate (which was useless there anyway) so he could post it on the wall to tell other&#39;s its worthless.    We told him no. 

Then when we they delivered the check they gave us a little leather American Express thing for the credit card.    They promptly came back and told me they don&#39;t take Amex.   I asked why they had Amex on the notebook thing, but all he did was say he&#39;s sorry once again.

After my wife told him we won&#39;t be coming back he just left.   

No offerings of a free dessert or a discount, nothing.   I guess they don&#39;t want customers.

Good food. That&#39;s what else I could want. 

I started with a a bowl of chili, and it was pretty good. If I had stopped there....

But, I ordered the Black Forest Ham panini with cheddar and an herb aioli, it came with &#34;Hand Cut &#34; fries. Not much ham on the sandwich.. what there was piled in the front.. leaving at least half of the sandwich.. to be what could have been best described as grilled flatbread. I didn&#39;t eat half of it. oh, and those &#34;Hand Cut&#34; fries? I don&#39;t know when they had been cut.. but they had been sitting around awhile. I&#39;m pretty easy to please when it comes to fries.. but these were room temp and stale.

My friends that got the burger said it was &#34;pretty good&#34;

Lisa got the Grilled Chicken Cobb salad... and it looked pretty good.. she said it tasted pretty good too.. except that it was pretty small for the money.

Two of our friends got the Turkey Cobb... which looked less appetizing.. At least one of them was missing the egg.. I suggested that he should ask about it.. but he just didn&#39;t want to deal with it.  

Perhaps we ordered the wrong things, or maybe our group was too large for them.. but they accepted the reservation and we ordered off the menu... so....

Fast forward to this last week, our 2015 holiday party. The chef has changed and the management is really working to get it right.

It can win me over! I wish I could give partial stars because I think overall my experience deserves more than 3 but I can&#39;t bring myself to give it a full 4. The patio at Reserve 22 is absolutely perfect (5 stars).  On a cool early fall night like tonight it was nice to be able to sit out and enjoy dinner while not freezing. Our seats were perfect! Both my husband and I chose the half prized burger.  Mine was delicious.  I asked for jalapeño and they were fresh and perfect! Fries were delicious.  The beer list was impressive, not in quantity but on quality for sure.  Now to the issues... We waited more than 5 but less than 10 minutes for any type of acknowledgment from the staff once seated.  Ordering drinks and food was quite slow.  Food took a while to arrive, although good it was slow.  We had empty beer glasses for quite some time. (We also never received a refill on water) When the food was delivered no ketchup or offering of ketchup occurred.  My husband had to stop a random server to ask for ketchup for his fries after 10 minutes of waiting for our guy to show up. With that being said,  our waiter apparently realized he was not awesome so he bought our first round. I think this place would EASILY get 4+ stars if service was more consistent.

The Reserve 22 hamburger was a 1/2 pound monster and I once had mussels which were decidedly not fresh. Fettuccini with artichokes was very good.

Even drinks came out slowly and I was there on a Tuesday so it was half price burgers. Medium burger came out way overdone. Kettle chips are not homemade, basically a bag of chips on your plate. I want to love this place because it&#39;s close and convenient but they need to up their service and food."

Also consider that the clubhouse had a major renovation a few years ago. 

Reserve 22 serves pub foods in a gorgeous golf course setting. Their burgers and appetizers are really good. Had the chips and salsa and their Reserve 22 burger. The burger was slightly over done but was tasty. The wait staff is awesome. Ask for Cheryl. She&#39;ll serve

Most remained empty as we sat at one of the hightops at the outside bar. We had to keep asking for service as it seemed no server was interested or responsible for serving us.

We have the conference room and enjoy free wifi, an extra plug strip (there are a few single-sided plugs on the table), and pretty cozy desk chairs.

The food&#39;s pretty good. The portions are ample and fries always come out hot. (Sandwiches have the option of fries, sweet potato tots, aaaaand something else I can&#39;t think of.)

Each time I order the Chicken Panini with no chicken (yes, I know). I ask if they can make me a veggie one, and each it&#39;s been different with seasonal veggies (yay!). Earlier in May it had yellow squash, zucchini, and tomatoes. Today it was mozarella, tomato, mushroom, and asparagus. Today&#39;s wasn&#39;t really a panini (more like a flatbread) and was a teeny bit over done, but was still very good and I ate the whoooole thing.

Two of my colleagues had the Buffalo Chicken Wrap that had a reddish tortilla. Another few had salads. Each portion was fresh and huge with enough to take home if you wanted.

Our server (forget her name, but she has red hair) always gives us space but checks on us a few times for waters.

And if you&#39;re prone to zoning out during meetings, you can enjoy a little people-watching and golf cart action. 
 
The only thing that freaked me out was golf carts whizzing through parking lot spaces in a crowded lot (srsly people?)!

They probably were expecting a bigger crowd, as the weather was nice and Sunday of the Masters was on TV ( this restaurant is part of the Village Links), and as it&#39;s owned by the village , profits are less of a focus than if you or I owned it. 

Regardless, the chef did a fabulous job on the pot pie, BBQ chicken salad, burgers, nachos and shrimp that we ordered. 

One complaint is the patio, even with a small crowd , it is loud on the 18 th green. They should try to put some sound buffers in. It is a nice stone patio, but if I am putting for a birdie on 18 I shouldn&#39;t be subject to the loud conversations. A huge wall of trees would make sense."

When it arrived it seemed very sparse but I was talking with my friend so I couldn&#39;t put my finger on what missing, but it bothered me even after I got home.  Then I remember that there was no chicken. ( I should have known that because we would go there for dinner every few weeks and that&#39;s usually what I order.) So since it really bothered me I decided to call the restaurant and speak to a manager. There were no managers on duty , just Eric the &#34; closing supervisor &#34;.   He was rude and accusatory when I told him that my salad was sparse and no chicken.  He asked why I didn&#39;t tell the waitress at the time , which is a fair question , but as I told him I was having a great conversation with my friend and I couldn&#39;t think of what was missing.  He kept asking me why I didn&#39;t tell the waitress.  He was rude and blamed me for not telling the waitress at the time.

Our food was bland and tasteless and the mussels were almost inedible with large chunks of debris left in them.

Stopped in at 8 PM on Friday evening for dinner with my family.   Overall we had made zed experience and mixed review of the food.  

First strike - it took several minutes for our waitress to stop by the table.  Customer Service plus - a second waitress checked in after our drink order was in to make sure we had been served.

Second strike - drinks were served but we received no water (a pet peeve of mine when I order wine or a drink).  

We placed our dinner order and the waiting began.  Since it was later in the evening, we were looking forward to eating.  While we ordered what seemed pretty common fare and we came in after the main dinner rush, we still waited a solid 30 minutes for dinner to be served.

Third strike - my medium rare steak was overcooked.  Since I was hungry and it was already so late I  mentioned to my waitress but said I didn&#39;t want to wait for a new order.  Customer Service Plus - She agreed that it certainly wasn&#39;t med rare and said she would take it off the check.  The manager stopped over and also apologized.

Atmosphere - lovely patio and nice decor but seems a little at odds with the huge TVs - does it want to be a nice bistro or a sports bar?  We also noted a waiter wheeling a huge cart of glasses right through the middle of the dining area.  Very poor planning for restocking during dinner.

Food - Onion rings and asparagus were fabulous.  Burger and chicken wrap were fine but nothing special.  Fries were not great and the chipotle BBQ sauce that came with the steak was not tasty.

I will be back to give some other menu items a chance.  While I appreciated that they tried to make their error right - they need to make other tweaks to the service for this to become a regular stop in our dining rotation."

The sliders were ok but the crab cakes did not taste of crab, they were overly fishy tasting, (not in a good way), leading me to believe they were being stored improperly in the kitchen cooler and had probably become contaminated with a nearby fish item. The &#34;loaded&#34; baked potato was a little light in the size that was described to us as well as shy on the toppings.  Our side of asparagus while tasty, still had the woody ends on them, four out of the five spears. Lastly, still hungry, we had an order of chicken wings. Of the eight pieces presented to us, one was the size of a little finger, two were the drummy portion the rest were the small part and dry at that. This was my second visit and probably the last.

We visited Reserve 22, at Village Links, on a Fri nite in May &#39;15. The place was already very busy at 7, not so much with golfers coming off the links, but with diners who made &#34;22&#34; their target for the evening. A loud boisterous crowd filled the dining room, the large bar, and most of the terrace. Video screens covered sports of the day.

Service was very attentive, and there was plenty of staff to handle the large crowd as well as keep problems down and service up.

&#34;22&#34; is not the usual clubhouse dining. A long list of craft and specialty beers, and wines, are offered. They do have typical soup/salad/sandwich menus, but also an interesting list of small plates and sides, from $3 to about $15. A limited list of plate dinners ran mostly below $20. We had chicken linguini w/artichokes and bistro steak w/truffle/parmigiana fries. The steak was no filet but was well prepared and nicely dressed with a savory, slightly tangy sauce. The fries were to die for! I devoured the whole mountain of them. The chicken pasta, a large serving, was very good and included several dried tomato slices. Sides are extra.

The noisy crowd diminished about 9PM and management went to great efforts to move the band, and pull out some tables, for those who stayed for the entertainment and dancing until 11.

While not gourmet dining (3*), and the noise is not our thing, prices are modest,  the food offerings are creative, the mood is up-beat, and service very attentive (management gets a 5*). A good value and fun place. Res. recommended."

One tip for patio dining though: put on bug spray! Not the most romantic smell for a date night, for sure, but you&#39;ll need it.

It seemed like some things had been sitting out a while, including some sad looking sushi and cheeses that were hard around the edges. Meats were either overcooked or very fatty, the rice was literally dry and crunchy (no potato option), and rolls were stale. Everything was relatively flavorless. Dessert choices were awful, mostly tacky looking cupcakes with Peeps on top because they were either out of the few other options or just weren&#39;t getting them restocked quickly. I guess I was expecting a little nicer meal and environment. This was truly no frills, not up to par for a holiday brunch. Not worth even the $46 per adult (with tax and tip).

So my family had decided to order pizza for dinner, but needed a place that also offered pasta for a picky eater in our family. Anyway, I attempted to call and couldn&#39;t get through, which I ended up finding out is because my phone was acting up. Once I used the house phone, I got through right away. The young lady that answered the phone was very nice and took my order quickly and thoroughly and then told me it would be about 25-30 minutes. I got on my way to pick up the order and when I got there I was told it would be another 4 minutes, not that I mind, I love fresh, hot food!! Plus the lady behind the counter was very friendly and talkative so the time went by the quickly. Once the food was ready I took it and got on my way. Well when I got home I discovered that they had made our pizza incorrectly :( so I called back and they instantly offered to remake the pizza for us, to which I took them up on. So I got on my way to pick up the correct pizza. I walked in and was helped quickly and was told it would be another couple of minutes, which again wasn&#39;t a problem for me. As I was waiting I got to talk again with the same friendly lady behind the counter and she apologized for the mixup to which I said wasn&#39;t a big deal, the Cubs are playing in the World Series, I understand they&#39;re pretty busy. While I was waiting she handed me $10 in Roundheads Dough, for us to use on a future purchase. She then offered me a drink while I wait and she came back with a root beer for me at no charge. Then the pizza was ready and she opened it in front of me to make sure it was correct and it was.

The standalone building sits at the perimeter of the parking lot serving an aging strip mall. The outside of Roundhead&#39;s brings to mind a nice casual dining chain restaurant like Applebee&#39;s or Chili&#39;s. The inside is anything but this.

The inside features a prominent bar, at which a cast of regulars can be found. This definitely has the vibe of &#34;bar and grill&#34; vs. &#34;grill and bar.&#34; When we arrived at about 6pm for dinner, there were lots of folks enjoying the beer, but nobody appeared to be eating. The dine-in crowd may have come later in the evening.

The sign as you enter says please wait to be seated, but one of the locals advised us to sit anywhere. The bartenders and waitstaff were all friendly, welcoming, female and 20-something,  -- a winning combination. 

There&#39;s a fenced in patio if you&#39;d like to eat (or more likely drink) in the fresh air. This was packed by the time we left at about 7pm on a weekday. Everyone seemed to be having a great time.

The food was very good. The Philly Cheese sandwich with steak was stuffed full of meat, onions and green peppers. The mozzarella on top ruined any shot at authenticity, but the result was really tasty regardless. It was served with hand-cut fries, which were great. The Fish and Chips was also really well-prepared. We cleaned our plates, if that&#39;s any indication of the food&#39;s quality.

If you&#39;re looking for a divey local place to grab a drink or two in Downers, this may be just what you&#39;re looking for. And if you get hungry, the food here will not disappoint. If you&#39;re looking for a place to bring your little league team for pizza after a big game, I&#39;m not sure this is where you want to stop."

When my boyfriend and I started dating, we&#39;d usually end up here. Admittedly, we&#39;d drink too much and eat too much, but we had fun talking to the older crowd that always seemed to be there on a weekday night (I worked weird hours so it wasn&#39;t unusual for us to party on the weekdays instead of the weekend). The servers were awesome, and I can&#39;t believe we&#39;ve been remembered by a few who have seen us at other locations, even though we haven&#39;t been here in over a year. 

I think my favorite thing about this place is the pub burgers. Do they still do the $3 Sunday special for them? If so, it is definitely worth getting your hands on a buger and fries. Wash it down with a cold beer, and you won&#39;t even care that Monday is soon to follow."

They have always had a very generous buffet spread and still do this day. Rather than fuss about what I can and can&#39;t eat on Good Friday, I decided to play it safe. 

I ordered a Pepper &amp; Egg sandwich with a side of cheese fries. The French bread was toasted and the pepper &amp; egg piled high. No complaints and I got everything I asked for. It was a simple lunch and I enjoyed it. I should really stop here more often and explore their menu outside of their buffet. Maybe their wings next time will be on my list."

I absolutely hate when people do that but I had no idea what time the kitchen closed as it is a bar and said open until 2:00am. The service was very friendly and accommodating. The food was what blew me away. I had the Diablo burger with a side of fries and loved everything about it. Burger itself was so tasty and juicy covered in buffalo sauce and topped with blue cheese crumbles. I cannot wait to go back. Fiancé said it was the best Philly cheesesteak around here.

The buffet was so-so at best.  There were only chicken breasts available, no legs or other portions.   Apparently they don&#39;t restock when 3 gentlemen eat all of the legs.  The pizza, which is wonderful at night, was bare bones - cheese, or sausage or pepperoni, nothing special.  The salad bar was basic, small, but acceptable.  The peppers &amp; sausage were okay. The fajita chicken was watery and the hard shells for tacos seemed destined to break before crunched with my teeth.  The pasta was so-so as well as the spaghetti.  I will say the brownie bites were truly special to end the meal.  Overall, if you just want to fill the pie hole over lunch, sure, it&#39;s fine, but do not expect anything wonderful and a glass of tea is $2.49, so they&#39;re getting their money back!"

Don&#39;t be fooled - this isn&#39;t a restaurant and bar it&#39;s a bar that also serves crappy food. 

I live less than 10 minutes away and decided to order a pizza to go to try something different. Lots of good reviews here about the pizza so I figured it would go smoothly. However when I brought it home and opened the box I could not believe how gross this pizza looked. 

There was a POOL of grease on top of the pizza. I used ten full paper towels to try and blot some of it off and didn&#39;t make a dent. I have never seen so much grease on a pizza in my life. When I tried to bite into it the cheese and toppings slipped right off, the crust was rock hard and thoroughly charred on the bottom. I tried to eat 2 pieces and ended up having to throw the rest away. I have no idea why anyone would say this pizza was good. Extremely disappointed and disgusting. Never again."

Along with the pizza, we also had an appitizer platter mainly made up of fried food.  It was standard, nothing really to rave about.  The only complaint I had was the soda.

We ate here last night for dinner. I enjoy their salads. They are always the freshest. I usually get a pizza and a side salad. The side salads are large! The pizza I get is the thin crust. Delish.

People love the dough balls. I think they are just okay, kind of bland.

This is a great place to go watch the game. However, if you don&#39;t like it loud then don&#39;t go on a game night.  They have a nice patio outside where you can eat. You can hear the game but will still be able to talk with your dinner mate.

We had the pick three.. The dough balls have an option of this buttery garlic deiciousnous sauce omg amazing in so many ways. The southwest egg rolls were good but doubt they were home made, seem to be frozen but good, and cheese curds were very tasty as well
We had cheese and garlic pizza, it was nice bc the cheese came all the way to the crust so no gips on the cheese, there could have been a bit more garlic, most of it was on the edges of the pizza and hardly any in the middle but other than that it was good pizza!

First off, they have a pretty respectable thin crust pizza.  It&#39;s in their namesake (Pizzeria Grill) so I was glad to see that they continued filled their pizza station with new choices even as the time winded down to 2:00.  Worthc checking out!  

Also, their fried chicken at lunch is greasy but crisp, and really quite tasty.  The older couple next to us continued to wait vocally for the fried chicken to come out, and eventually got their wish when they refilled the pan around 1:30.  I snagged three pieces for my wife and I, and it was tasty and hot.

Buffalo strips were good, chicken was tender.  Rigatoni alfredo had an excellent cream sauce as well without being cloyingly thick.  Overall, pretty good food, especially for the price of the lunch buffet.

Why three stars?  Well, some of the items we came excited to try (Italian wedding soup, Mini BBQ pork sandwiches) never made an appearance while we there for the one hour.  While the signs were out at the buffet table, the area was left empty.  Perhaps because it&#39;s 1:00 and the owners/chefs don&#39;t want to put out more food at risk of it being wasted, but my wife and I were a bit disappointed that the full selection wasn&#39;t out.  Personally, I think it would&#39;ve helped if the manager or waitress asked around if people were looking for any dishes specifically on the buffet menu so that folks wouldn&#39;t leave disappointed... In fact, if the older couple next to us wasn&#39;t so vocal about it, I wonder if we would&#39;ve had a chance to taste it!

Verdict:  The lunch buffet on the weekdays is a great deal, with lots of tasty options to take advantage of... assuming you go before 1:00?  We may go back to check it out again someday."

If you want pizza, go somewhere else because the chef here as no clue. Cheeseburgers are okay but come with greasy pre-frozen fries.

Having been totally ripped by their faux pizza on three occasions, we chanced another visit. 

We tried the &#34;highly recommended&#34; Pot Roast and Fries smothered in Cheese dish.
It consisted of frozen potato &#34;waffles&#34; deep fried and soggy, a SMALL portion of pot roast hiding here and there on the plate and drizzled with processed cheese. A well-recommended by the locals, but HIGHLY insulting dish for over $10.

I have always enjoyed their food, whether it be their amazing pizza, Italian Beef Sandwich (comes with fries, baked beans and cole slaw), meatball sandwich, or virtually any of the other items on the menu.

This is a classic mom and pop family restaurant and the Nagy family goes to great lengths to keep it that way. Although, I have to be honest: I thought they did better business at their old location next to Ace when it was open: ever since they opened Another Round in downtown Downers Grove, I&#39;ve noticed that their parking lot isn&#39;t as full as it once was. When this location first opened, you might as well ate your pizza standing up because it was jam packed. Now, a lot of people have gone to the other location which is more of a DG twenty and thirtysomething bar now...

The thin crust pizza is slightly moist yet crispy, and is usually ready within 30 minutes. I was unhappy that they stopped carrying Labatt&#39;s here, however they said they have it at the downtown location. For some reason, I find ice cold Labatt Blue and hot Roundhead&#39;s pizza to be an awesome comfort meal...

The noise level is not excessive, despite the TVs playing sports games and an internet jukebox on a continual loop of Katie Perry, Carly Rae Jepsen and whatever kids listen to these days. Roundhead&#39;s attracts a lot of regulars who eat and drink here frequently (former Mayor Brian Krajewski used to come here quite a bit, but mainly to the old location as well as Martin Tully) The wait staff is patient and friendly and for a decent sized pizza for two, one large beer and 2 large Pepsi&#39;s ran 24$.

My only complaint is they need to bring back Labatt&#39;s but they said no one was ordering it. Maybe I should bring my own?

Overall, an enjoyable family experience. The owners really do their best to make this family friendly and free of loud obscene drunks. Top notch."

This is an FYI for anyone using their smart phone to locate the phone number and place orders in advance.  Make sure to ask whether your calling the correct place.  The confusion &amp; error happens quite often.

Sports pub with a family feel.  Most diners are couples or families of four plus.  Their best pizza types are the thin and pan.  I&#39;m not a fan of their stuffed pies, which house  so much cheese you could gag on it.  With that said, after having a few of their stuffed pies, it could not compete with some of Chicago&#39;s better stuffed pies.  I think their thin crust is their best offering with pan coming a close second.  I mentioned in my Lombard location review a great pie to try is that with Italian beef and giardinera on a pan pizza.  The smells are divine and the taste is everything you would expect from it.    Since Roundhead&#39;s has that family feel to it, wait staff are welcoming and management is thankful for the business.  Between the two locations I would say I like this one a bit more, probably due to the dining experience.  The Lombard location draws more of a bar crowd and has that kind of feel."

His family is from the area, and we have eaten at all the 3 locations several times. I love their thin crust pizza, and it&#39;s one of our gotos for carry out. We&#39;ve always had decent service when we dine in, and most any other time I would have given them a solid 4 stars,  but this past visit there a few things turned me off and knocked them down a peg in my book. We got there earlyish on a Friday night, around 6. We were seated immediately, but they were starting to get busy because a Hawks game was coming on. They have a bit more of a sports bar vibe than I like when games are on, but whatever, we don&#39;t follow hockey so we didn&#39;t know there was a game on that night. It was annoying though because the guy asked us if we wanted to watch the game, and we said no, so instead of seating us where we could see a TV he sat us underneath one and the speakers were blaring right above our table. Loud. Our waitress was busy, but still attentive. We ordered boneless wings as an appetizer. They have a variety of sauces to choose from similar to Buffalo Wild Wings, there&#39;s like 10 of them. We wanted to do 3 and 3 of different sauces. She told us you can&#39;t break up the sauces on orders of 6, only the bigger orders. Not her fault, but I don&#39;t get it. Why does it matter? My husband said maybe they make the sauces from scratch and don&#39;t want to make them for smaller batches. It still seemed kind of dumb and arbitrary to me. The wings were really good though, we went with the chili lime and it was perfectly sweet and spicy. We ordered the Hawaiian pizza for dinner and I asked for it to be made well done. I like the cheese brown on top. When she brought it out it was sort of brown on top, she asked if it was ok, and said she could take it back if not. It could have been darker, but we already waited for a while because they were packed by then. It was delicious anyway. Their pizza is always awesome. The thing that really bothered me was when we paid we had an expired Groupon, we knew we wouldn&#39;t get the discounted price, but typically the policy is that the business should give you the price you paid for it. We buy Groupons all the time. We usually use them in time, but on the few other times we have had an expired one we have never had them rejected. Occasionally we have still been given the discount. I work in the spa industry so I have dealt with Groupons at work many times over  the years and we have always honored the expired ones for the price that was paid for it. Well, our waitress told us no that they would not take it, and we just needed to deal with Groupon for it. She was pretty flip about it too. I was tempted to speak to a manager just because I found it to be poor customer service, and she was kind of rude about it, but my husband didn&#39;t want to get into it. It&#39;s not about the money. It was only $10 off our bill, and we know we&#39;ll get it back from Groupon anyway. It was just the attitude about it was stinky. Overall this experience here was just OK. We&#39;ll go back though. We do like the food, and it&#39;s  practically in our backyard.

Honorable mention for the Dough Balls, they&#39;re like crack. And the Bagel Burger is really good too."

I love Another Round, so when I saw a groupon for their &#34;parent restaurant-&#34; Roundheads, I snatched it up! Though I had never eaten at this location before, I had been here before- I was just too many drinks in to the evening to remember. Hey- $4 hurricanes, baby! Can&#39;t go wrong there!

Anyway- on to the review! My brother, myself, and a boy I babysit for (dubbed &#34;kiddo&#34; for the purposes of the review) came here for a Friday night dinner to get out take advantage of the nice weather and my groupon. Kiddo uses a wheelchair and I&#39;ll be damned if I don&#39;t show up and every stinking handicap parking spot is taken. So I jet inside and I must have just looked a little distressed because the owner came right up to me. I explained the situation, he walked outside the restaurant with me and found us a good spot to park so we would be able to get the ramp out. Great start!

We got a table outside and our waitress promptly greeted us. She was super friendly and attentive. Got us our drinks within a few minutes and was even nice enough to re-do a drink for us so Kiddo had a drink with a lid and could drink independently. We ordered mozzarella sticks and a 16&#39; cheese pizza. Mozzarella sticks came quickly and were delish! In fact...it came with 6 and I only got to eat 1/2 of one. I guess the boys were hungry. Only downside to the sticks are that their marinara sauce has meatballs in it. I don&#39;t know if you can order without, but as a vegetarian I was slightly sad with that discovery.

A little bit later the waitress brings out our pizza and it&#39;s, of course, awesome. We ate the whole thing between the 3 of us. Somewhere in the middle of eating our pizza, the restaurant blew a fuse and lost all power. We were sweating a little bit when we realized none of us had cash to pay but the power slowly came back on within 5 minutes. Stuffed, we showed the waitress our groupon via the iPod (she actually just scanned it straight off the screen...no paper!), paid the rest of our tab and left. Definitely a fun night out."

Same goes w/the food when it was served. Didn&#39;t have to wait for it to cool down too long to take a bite. If you are a Cheese Lover, then you would enjoy taking bites into this lasagna. It was also a great portion where i had to take half of it home, which was delicious even heated up at home.

Food is good in my opinion; Pizza is excellent and I can&#39;t get enough of the spicy garlic hot wings.

Owner and staff have always been friendly and welcoming.

Huge Blackhawks bar, they will have the game on projection screens at either end of the place, as well as have the sound on during the game.  They will put on the flashing lights, bull horn and blast Chelsea Dagger when a goal is scored.  The kids get a kick out of it."

The pizza is okay, the beef is okay, everything else is okay.  Let&#39;s just say the food at Roundhead&#39;s is perfectly mediocre.  I can get mediocre food for much less at McDonald&#39;s.  

On to the service.  The staff at Roundhead&#39;s certainly aren&#39;t the brightest bunch.  They perform their jobs with no enthusiasm and show no interest in their guests.  I should&#39;ve just dropped my order off at the kitchen myself.  

Okay, the final test is at hand.  Can they make drinks?  I ordered a Tanqueray and Tonic.  Anyone who&#39;s ever had a Gin and Tonic of any kind knows that it&#39;s not complete without a lime.  Any bartender worth a damn should definitely know that that drink needs a lime.  No lime.  It&#39;s amateur hour at Roundhead&#39;s!  Luckily, they do know how to pour a beer.

All I have to say is &#34;Really?&#34; or &#34;How inebriated were these voters?&#34; We went during lunch and had the buffet. The pizza was good but not the best. It was the run of the mill standard thin crust that you can find anywhere. I was expecting to be blown away and instead it was meh. The lunch buffet was small but did have some yummy taco meat. The spread was diverse and not just standard pizza/pasta fare. The restaurant/bar has that blue collar feel that you might find somewhere in Bridgeport (something I like because I grew up around there). I will probably go back and just try the pizza when it hasn&#39;t been sitting on the buffet line.

  Best part is they have no problem letting you &#39;split it into Quarters&#39; so you can get whatever you want.

This place is really small. There was an area for darts, the bar itself, and booths along the walls. There were TVs scattered throughout the place which was nice. They had this infomercial thing on and it was sooo weirdddd. The rest of the TVs had the basketball game on.

The beef carpaccio was delicious, excellent amount of sauce and fresh chips. 

The person in charge of water was exceptional and came by our table no less than 5 times. Which was good, since my husband drinks only water. 

When we placed our entrees, Brandon suggested we cut down on sides, as their portions are generous. A very helpful tip as we didn&#39;t finish the sides we had ordered. My husband ordered the bison ribeye medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked. I ordered the 7 ounce filet mignon along with a half pound of Alaskan King crab legs. My filet mignon was exactly how I ordered it, the béarnaise sauce that I requested was perfect along with the mushrooms and onions, all delectable.

While most steakhouses host a common denominator of dark woods, very dark lighting, and very masculine decor, Eddie Merlot&#39;s has a lighter and brighter feel to it. Its modern decor, butterscotch colors, and dim but not dark lighting, is a breath of fresh air. While, it&#39;s not feminine at all, it&#39;s not a &#34;Boy&#39;s Club&#34;. Absent is that message that seems to scream &#34;Leave your ovaries at the door&#34;.

Mirroring the decor, Eddie Merlot&#39;s has a nicely diverse menu. --Something I appreciate since I am not a big steak eater. Nothing disappoints me more than going to a restaurant and finding they&#39;ve only paid attention to their big meat eating customers. Mind you, they still cater to them with their steak and bison collection, but they offer a nice selection of other menu items listed under their Seafood and Chef&#39;s Creations.

While I did enjoy the Filet Mignon Potstickers, the fact that it was filet mignon was lost with the other ingredients. They taste just like..... potstickers. 

I&#39;ve ordered and loved both their Cedar-Roasted Salmon and their Sea Bass. Both were cooked  perfectly and felt like comfort food to me without that dreaded feeling of eating heavy meat. I loved the Sea Bass so much that I awoke the next day, still thinking about it. 

Sides are perfect for 2 people. The (trendy) Brussels Sprouts are good. --A solid choice. While the flavor of the Sweet Potato Casserole is everything I love in that dish, the presentation had room for improvement. When they brought it to the table, my entire family giggled. Our sophomoric maturity got the best of us. It was delicious... but looked like a bodily creation. 

During my last visit, we ordered more traditional choices such as my choice for the Garlic Mashed Potatoes and my dinner companion&#39;s Creamed Spinach. I haven&#39;t eaten Creamed Spinach in years, but was pleasantly surprised with how much I liked it. --I am a sucker for comfort food. I&#39;m only hoping that skipping two meals that day balanced out the caloric intake of that heavy cream and bacon! ;)

We came in on a Friday at 5:30 and had a 3-hour dinner...thankfully it wasn&#39;t super crowded that we felt like we were holding a table for too long, it was great to be able to catch up and not be rushed out of there.  I wasn&#39;t sure how crowded it would get so I made us a reservation on Open Table with no problem.  It wasn&#39;t super crowded on a Friday night, though I&#39;m sure it fills up on the weekends.  They start you off with bread, though they ask if they can bring the bread to the table which I very much welcome usually eating low carb... I made an exception for this night!  I had steak, she had fish, and we split two sides.  Our server was great, and explained everything on the menu.  The food was AMAZING!!!  The inside is lovely!  I was very satisfied with my experience here."

The steaks are just about perfect! The calamari was amazing. However, the lobster  bisque wasn&#39;t very good. I also felt like the carrot cake wasn&#39;t that great, and they call it the world&#39;s best. Hardly. You can get a better carrot cake at Outback Steakhouse.

Everything else I have tried was awesome! I&#39;m not sure if all of it was worth the price, but it&#39;s good food. The service wasn&#39;t as good as you would expect though, which is kind of ridiculous since you are paying top dollar.

He presented a disgusted attitude when I ordered the house wine and a 7 oz filet mignon even though my husband ordered the bison.

If you like steak or pork chops, this is a good choice. The food is high quality served in a relaxing setting. The service is excellent which really adds to the positive experience.

They had a special for Valentine&#39;s Day that entailed both my fiancé and I choosing an appetizer to share, a salad of our own, and entree of our own, a side to share, and a giant piece of triple chocolate cake to share (all from a special Valentine&#39;s Day menu) for $119.00. It was more than worth it! 

We had a spicy shrimp appetizer, and I had a Merlot Salad, the cedar plank barbecue salmon, broccoli and Eddie&#39;s potatoes, and my fiancé got the same salad and a steak for his entree. The whole experience was awesome, and the food was delicious! I would say this is one of the best meals I&#39;ve ever had. 

Also, our waiter, Ruben, was absolutely wonderful. He was very helpful, and helped me to discover my new favorite wine (a riesling called Schloss). When we asked for a bottle of a different riesling at first, he suggested the Schloss and brought us a sample of both to test before deciding. Ruben was very professional and provided us with excellent service throughout our meal. 

In addition to the wonderful food and service, the atmosphere at this restaurant is very unique and relaxing. I definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a special and memorable meal!"

Can&#39;t wait to go back again! First time I got the Bison Medallion Trio. Slightly overcooked (understandable, the medallions are small and bison is very lean). But everything else has been spot on. Had the NY Strip on the return visit, outstanding -- and cooked perfectly medium-rare. I&#39;d go rare on this meat, it&#39;s that good.

We had a couple of starters this time -- the calamari and the steak carpaccio. The calamari was tender with three sauces -- I only found the wasabi sauce to be worth the dipping, since the calamari was delicious without the sauces. The carpaccio was thicker than I&#39;m used to, but sooooo tender! My wife insists it was frozen, and I&#39;ll admit it was freezing cold - but once it warmed a bit it was great, too.

Service was great again on this visit and we kept our server busy with wine orders. Leslie did a great job with fresh glasses for each bottle and even offered a tasting of a wine we considered buying. Nice move, she was right, we went with a different bottle.

Overall, I believe this place will stand with any steakhouse in Chicago. Great prime dry-aged meat, good wine list, great desserts, and spot on service. The only downside, I&#39;ll admit, is that you&#39;re going to pay for this - it&#39;s NOT a discount steak house. Prices rival any other top steakhouse.

And it was noisier last night, too -- but the place was full...

But if you&#39;re out for beef, and there&#39;s room on the ol&#39; Visa card, check this place out!"

The room had a projector for a power point presentation and was really long and skinny. The microphones did not work too well, especially over the noise from the rest of the restaurant. It wasn&#39;t the best room for a presentation is what I&#39;m trying to say. But it was still nice. 

Anyway, now to the food. My mom and I got a 7oz filet cooked medium which was decent in size and pretty good/not bad! Some parts were juicier than others. 

The mashed potatoes were absolutely amazing. So buttery and sooooo tasty! I wish I could have some now!

The broccoli was also pretty tasty for broccoli- probably because it was drenched in butter as well...

The chocolate cupcake was very generous in size and was absolutely scrumptious. The frosting was very chocolatey and the cupcake very moist.

I think the meal would have cost us $70 per person plus tip and tax. I probably wouldn&#39;t come here unless it was a super special occasion due to the price. But the place is really fancy and the food is really good! The staff are very kind as well.

Service, not so.

It&#39;s not that the service was horrendous, or unfriendly.. it was just kind of incompetent.

Some quick examples; My buddy ordered an aperitif with one ice cube.. the drink arrived sans ice cube.. but the server swore that there used to be one in there.. and then left. Wine was ordered and delivered with the appetizers, ok fine.. wine was ordered again for the main dish and didn&#39;t show up until we were halfway through the meal... our forks were cleared after the appetizers and never replaced... when our meals came we had no silverware.. we had to ask for it. That stuff never happens at other great steakhouses.

Stupid stuff but with a bill near $600 for four people, you&#39;ve got a few expectations.

We got a great table in front of the fireplace, it was cozy and the chairs were extremely comfortable. Eddie Merlot&#39;s is upscale casual.. in a really nice way. A different feel than most of the other steakhouses around.

For appetizers we shared the Short Ribs with Sea Scallops and the Filet Mignon Potstickers. They were excellent.. who would have thought that Short Ribs and Scallops could be so great together?

Adam ordered the Wagyu 20 oz Bone In Strip and it was perfect.. Adam thinks it might be the most expensive steak he&#39;s ever ordered. Janet got the Bison Filet, Oscar style and loved it. Lisa ordered the Stroganoff and said she would get it again in a heartbeat.

I was in a light hearted and playful mood.. so rather than a big honking steak.. I opted for a tantalizing taste sensation of flavors. The Trio of Medallions (one Oscar, one Bacon Gorgonzola and one Peppercorn... all done a perfect medium rare) and then, because I didn&#39;t want Adam to feel bad about his costly steak.. I ordered a lobster tail to go with my Trio... Let me just say...

&#34;Clean Plate Club!&#34;

Oh, and we shared  some really good sides too.. Parmesan Truffle Fries, Brussel Sprouts (yum) and mashed potatoes... yes, they were all excellent too.

For dessert we all dug into a huge Peanut Butter cup, it&#39;s a good thing we&#39;re all really good friends because that was a lot of sharing.

I guess that E.M&#39;s doesn&#39;t do much about birthday&#39;s because we told them with our reservation that it was Lisa&#39;s B-Day.. no big deal, but good to know.

This was our second visit here, the first was for a very good Mother&#39;s Day Brunch earlier this year, but it didn&#39;t seem appropriate to rate a steakhouse based on a special event that didn&#39;t involve their regular food or their regular service.

This could have easily been a five star visit if the service were just up to par. The food was so good, that I will go back.. for sure."

Once a month we go to different steakhouses with my coworkers (about 7 of us) and this time we chose Eddie Merlot&#39;s down the street from work. 

We had reservations for 06:45 PM and when we got there half the restaurant was empty. This was a Saturday evening. Usually stakehouses are packed.

We got seated right away but than everything just bluh. They gave us a private dining room which was nice but the service was leggy and took too long. It took them 1:20 mins to bring my Bison filet mignon. I was really looking forward to it as i never had bison before but when they brought it, it tasted like it had been seating on the kitchen table for about 30 mins and was not warm."

Let&#39;s net brunch down to three points - selection, quality, and layout.  I guess you could add price, too, but it&#39;s difficult to compare one brunch price against another in my opinion.  You either walk away thinking it was a good value or not.  

Selection - A good variety of entrees including a carving stand (ham and prime rib) along with staples like chicken (chicken breast and the kid favorite chicken fingers).  I particularly liked the meatloaf.  The usual salad offerings (Caesar, chopped, etc) and even salmon.  Veggies like mashed potatoes, green beans, broccoli, etc.  A good dessert selection (I recommend the sea salt chocolate chip cookie) that even included Bananas Foster.

Quality - No complaints from our table on any items.  As mentioned before I thought the meatloaf was very good.  And the bacon was outstanding.   The prime rib was pretty rare even by prime rib standards.

Layout - Basically an &#39;L&#39; shape for everything but the desserts.  I&#39;m a bigger fan of a split layout because I always feel like I&#39;m getting the stink eye when I skip the back of the line and zero in on a specific item.  But unless you&#39;re in line for the first time is it rude to not walk past the salads, appetizers, and other items just to get more mashed potatoes?  Other than the woman picking through every piece of bacon to find just the right pieces, there never was really a wait (whether you jump the line or not).  

A strolling guitar player set a nice tone.  I thought Eddie&#39;s brunch was better than most and would add it to my list of holiday brunch choices.  

Bonus brunch tip - always check out the dessert selection whenever you revisit the brunch line.  You never know if that piece of french silk pie or sea salt cookie will be available when you&#39;re ready for dessert.  Grab it when you see it."

It was my 23rd birthday and my cousin made a reservation a week before telling the hostesses to reserve a nice seat for the celebration. The day of we called to make sure the reservation was still available. It was. We called again to ask if it is OK if we come 15 minutes later due to rain and traffic. We ended up coming only a few minutes later. 

The two hostesses could not find our reservation? When we told them we called to make sure both of them didn&#39;t have a clue and suggested we made a reservation at a different restaurant. We definitely did not. the number we called was the Warrenville location. We checked our call list. We told them the number we called, they agreed it is theirs. 

We reminded them we had a reservation for a birthday. My cousin and her boyfriend are regulars: it was my first time. So where do we get seated? A table behind the bar next to a wall where our eyes were level with people&#39;s booties, right next to the entrance to the beautiful main dining room. We were a few feet away from the bar and the space is definitely a walking hallway space meant for decor, not a table, and NOT a birthday dinner table. The noise was ridiculous, we were constantly passed by servers...My cousin suggested we walk out, but I brushed it off. It was the worst seat of the house: awkward and I honestly don&#39;t know why they would even put a table there. Our view was literally a bunch of people&#39;s backs. 

What gets to me is that there were better tables available, and the front of house didn&#39;t mutter an apology and had a &#34;polite&#34; attitude about not finding the reservation, neither admitting fault but suggesting it on us. 

Anyway, our waiter was wonderful. 
We had calamari appetizer (perfecto)
Wine tasters (also nice)
I had the prime new york strip (perfecto) and a side of mashed potatoes which were some of the best I ever had. 
My cousin had the pound of Alaskan Crab legs which were too salty in my opinion. A common trend for the reviews. I would stick to their meats. 

I am coming back solely for the meats and to try the Escargot, but honestly, if I make another reservation and it goes wrong again, I&#39;m not dishing out hundreds of dollars to be uncomfortable. We were definitely the youngest in the crowd and it seemed the hostesses did not take us too seriously. 50% of a restaurant&#39;s success is the experience. Ours was awkward."

We walked in with reservations at 7.30 PM.  At 7.45 we were still waiting and 5 people along with the manager were studying a computer screen. All oblivious to us sitting there. No one else was in the lobby waiting. I asked if any of them could sit us. They asked for my name again. I asked are they too busy to sit us and serve is. The Manager said my apologies and had us seated. The hostess that seated us stated the Manager will be by to rectify our snafu at being seated.

The main area is about half full. 

We now wait 15 munutes and guess what? No waiter. The hostess comes by and gives us water. 5 min later a nuc5e waitress shows up. I ask her if I can expect great service?  She says they called her over from the other side of the restaurant because we have waited so long. 

We decided to leave and thanked her for her honesty. The Manager never showed. As we left the front desk had 3 people reading the screen....no one cared.

We were Platinum members and have had great service numerous times. What a dissapointment.

No one ready to spend $300 for a meal and Wine should be treated so badly."

Several menu items that we LOVED are now gone (steak Diane and wasabi beans).  Also, just recently, we noticed that the already exorbitant prices were raised...in some cases 50%!  

We ordered the Napa meal deal and both shared a filet and Alaskan king crab legs.  The crab legs were super salty and dry.  The filet was good (but I would have preferred steak Diane!). We also shared a twice baked potato which was good. 

Our waitress was friendly and provided good service.

Overall, we were not impressed with Eddie Merlot&#39;s as we once were...  I think that maybe we are just more interested in a different type of restaurant.  This place seems stuffy and trying to appeal only to a certain type of clientele with prices like $99 for a steak?!  The weirdest part is that price hikes would seem like a good idea if there was a huge demand for EM....  However, every time we have come, the place is almost entirely empty.

And so far, this has been the most non-enjoyable experience. The service was as slow as it gets. It took them 1 hour 14 minutes to bring my my bison filet mignon and it tasted as if they had left it in the kitchen table for 30 min before they they brought it to me. And I am writing this review as I am waiting 30 mins for my espresso. It takes 10 seconds to make espresso. 

The whole experience was meh and the restaurant was half empty at 8 pm on a Saturday."

My wife had wanted to check this place out for awhile, although whenever we think of it, it&#39;s packed.  So, when she asked where I wanted to go for dinner... it didn&#39;t take me long to suggest this place.

I must say though, that the initial sticker price is very shocking.  This is a pricey place.  But the menu had great choices that had me very intrigued.  

I ended up getting the best bowl of French Onion Soup I ever had!  And, a great Bison Ribeye.  I love Bison and always wanted to try a Bison steak... it was all that and more.

I asked for Medium Rare, which was a little too rare for my liking.  I sent it back, and the manager came by and kept apologizing like it was something they did wrong.  I tried to tell him that it was just my expectation of what a medium rare should look like and wasn&#39;t there fault.  When it came back it was so delicious I almost cried when I finished it.

For my Birthday they gave me a piece of their Red Velvet Cake that was very good, although it came with a shot glass of milk that I couldn&#39;t figure out if I should be dipping or take it like a man. 

They also gave me a card that all the staff signed which was a great touch.  

Angie was our server and it was her 22nd birthday too.... If I had known I would&#39;ve gotten her a card too.  She was super funny and great at what she does."

I would give them 5 stars but some of the prices I felt were over the top.  But let me start with the positives.  First the food quality is fantastic. Nothing is rushed and the food was plated in a high class style.  Second, our server, Monica, was a delight. She was funny, direct, and told us what NOT to have.  Imagine that!   She offered the advice after we asked, not before.   She made our dinner a great event.   She also introduced us to the managers.    Third, our steaks were cooked exactly as asked.   Nothing drives me crazier than giving me a steak wrong and having to send it back as your guests eat their dinner.   Wife and kids had filet medallions.  All loved it.  I had 1/2 lb of king crab legs.   Pretty good.  Would have liked it hotter.   It was warm at best.  

 Our appetizers were great as well. Raw oysters, Oysters Rockefeller and escargot borgeignon.   I had a French onion soup.  Top notch!   Last, we had bananas foster for desert.   Need I say more?   It was fantastic.   

The bills was $340 for 4.   We did have $100 of wine.   A bit expensive!   NOTE: My favorite cabernet was on the menu for $20-40 per bottle more than other steak houses in the area.   Hence my not giving me the 5th star.    However I will be going back and highly recommend for a special occasion or business dinner.

Ask for Monica and engage her in conversation.  She is great!"

I was very uncomfortably full after our meal at Eddie Merlot&#39;s last weekend, but there was soo much good food I couldn&#39;t resist it!  as soon as we got home, last Saturday night at 9pm, both the wife and I passed out on the couch from all of the food.  that&#39;s how good it was!

Cindy took care of us during dinner, and Roumel, one of the managers would also come around every so often to see how our meal was going.  top notch service here, with all of our needs tended to during dinner.  Cindy was raving about this bottle of Zinfandel, which now I forget the name of it.  I was going to get a glass of wine for dinner, but I had trouble convincing the rest of the table to go in on a bottle.  Cindy brought a taste of this wine over to the table and they were all sold on it.

For dinner I had ordered a wagyu tomahawk ribeye with a peppercorn sauce on top.  unfortunately, they had run out of the tomahawk ribeyes, so I decided to let someone else at the table have theirs and I went with a regular bone in ribeye instead with the sauce on top.  still very good, but wish I could have gotten the tomahawk. Roumel let me know that they don&#39;t get very many of these steaks from the supplier as they are hard to come by, so they can run out of them very easily.  so just something to note if you do decide to order it, make sure you order quickly!

for dessert we had bananas foster, they come and make it right at your table for you.  it&#39;s a pretty cool presentation as they ignite the liquor for a huge light show.  oh soooo good.  I would definitely order this again the next time we come back.

all in all, it was a great dinner.  if you&#39;re looking for a great steak, you can&#39;t go wrong with Eddie Merlot&#39;s"

The food quality was high, and I&#39;m sure the prices were too.  I didn&#39;t pay for this outing, so I can&#39;t speak to the value side.  The decor is virtually identical to the Lincolnshire location I noted.  The medium rare NY strip I had was very nice, as was the carrot cake dessert.  Except for our group on this evening, business was light though and the vibrancy factor was missing.  It certainly looks to be a place for a quiet high end dinner."

For dinner we had beef brochettes, short ribs, crab legs, and beef medallions. We ordered potatoes for the table to share. Everything was prepared as ordered and delicious.
The French Press coffee is one of my favorite things about Eddie Merlot&#39;s. It comes with accoutrements: mini chocolate chips, real whipped cream, cinnamon sticks, and cubed brown sugar. Yum!
The lemon sorbet is so wonderful! We also had a chocolate cupcake with ice cream, s&#39;mores, and chocolate cookies with milk. The desserts are simply out of this world, as is the food.

He was thorough as he spoke about the menu&#39;s, highlighting several items. He also recommended a couple of sample taste of wine as I was making my decision. 
 
Decor/Cleanliness - 5 Stars. 

Food - 3.5 Stars. I ordered a Caesar salad to start..nothing special. It was good with fresh crisp Romain lettuce, dressed appropriately, but nothing to set it apart. Main was a Ribeye and Brussel sprouts for a side. Maybe I had a higher expectation based on the price point but I feel the food was mediocre at best. The steak was thinner than I expected with very little seasoning. I wasn&#39;t looking for cajun style but  salt and pepper would have done wonders. The brussels were l&#39;dente and very toothsome.they had just enough bacon and onions for great flavor.

Wine - 5 Stars

All I can day is... It is not worth the money for the variety of food.  All beverages except water, juice and coffee are ala carte.  

They had 3 salads, smoked salmon (no bagels), bacon and sausage, frittata (not good) and apple French toast, potatoes, green beans, broccoli, rice, sweet potato casserole, meatloaf, pork, chicken, ham, salmon, carved ham and beef tenderloin, build your own omelet, muffins, fruit, banana foster, and mini desserts.  The fact that I can remember each dish is a testament to how little they offer.  No real seafood.  No bread variety and no waffles or pancakes (very little traditional breakfast foods for a brunch)

The food was O.K.  I heard they were known for their meat and the tenderloin was very tender and delicious.  But why their website says seafood is beyond me.  They had smoked salmon and salmon... Where was the seafood?  

The staff minus the hostesses were friendly and helpful. If you have brunch starting at 10 and you have several families with small children, why not go ahead and seat, so they are settled, instead of a 10 minute wait.

They needed at least two areas for brunch food or a large area for the food.  The food was placed in the bar area and it was congested!  The plates were on the bar and then the line wrapped through the dining room.  Definitely difficult for people with disabilities.  

Lastly, the seating.  Where we were seated was fine, not as congested as other areas.  The chairs are nice and the atmosphere was lovely. 

Having gone to Allgauer&#39;s for the last 8+ years, I was disappointed.  Decided try something new this year.  Although more people, Allgauer&#39;s has stations set up that are easily accessible.  Several of the same stations to prevent long lines.  I missed the shrimp and seafood and desserts at Allahauers.  I missed the waffles and the bread variety.  I guess I just like knowing if I&#39;m paying $45-60 per person, I have choices (and a little free champagne).  I won&#39;t be back to Eddie Merlot&#39;s, I&#39;ll leave that for the couples and their romantic evenings."

Very good food.
High prices.

That three line summary sums up Eddie Merlot&#39;s.  We went here after a meeting, and all of the above were true.  The service was very good, constantly attentive, with a visit from the manager after the food was served.

The ambiance was very good as well.  The place is well-kept, and not a crumb was out of place.

The price is on the high side.  Go with it - if you&#39;re looking for a good steak with good service, this place is for you. Everything is served ala carte.  There is no free wifi if that&#39;s a deal breaker for you.

The wine by the glass was a bit pricey, but it was in line with the similarly pricey menu items."
eddie-merlots-warrenville-warrenville-2,Susanne D.,Zj5Caq3EXPQD8g4gV8KoMw,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,1,0,469,44,jLJZQTOhsV5blMdi4o9xXg,2.0,2013-02-19,"I&#39;ve been to Eddie Merlot&#39;s for cocktail events in the lounge area, which have been satisfactory experiences...the restaurant itself is beautiful and they have a decent wine list. This past Saturday, though, was my first dining experience here and I wasn&#39;t wow-ed at all.

My date and I arrived promptly at our reservation time and were told there would be a short wait and we could have a seat. The host acted like he couldn&#39;t be bothered with a proper greeting and waved us over to some chairs sitting in the host area. After sitting there for a few minutes, I commented that it was strange they wouldn&#39;t ask you to have a drink in the lounge while you wait. (I have managed fine dining restaurants and that&#39;s a given! Get that extra revenue!) So we went into the bar area to find live entertainment. Hm, that would have been nice to know, too. &#34;Enjoy a cocktail and our entertainment while you wait....45 minutes&#34;

If the restaurant was busy, I would overlook a 30-45 minute wait, but it really wasn&#39;t. The service staff looked to be in slow motion. Brett was a decent but not particularly memorable as a server, with no urgency as seen across the dining room in the other servers. As a former manager I look for high-end waitstaff to sell, not just order-take. No steak tray was presented nor were we asked if we had dined there before or if we had questions. Just &#34;Are you ready?&#34; 

By this time it was well past 9 o&#39;clock, so my date and I completely skipped the appetizers and ordered our dinner. While he was pleased with his 14 oz. boubon marinaded ribeye, I was less impressed. I ordered the 6 oz. filet with foie gras topping (a $17 upcharge) and while the steak was cooked perfectly, there was nothing different about it than what I could get at Morton&#39;s or Sullivan&#39;s with far better service. The foie gras was the worst I&#39;ve ever had...maybe a 2 oz slice and not smooth at all. Just tasted like gamey fat. Don&#39;t waste your money!

The sides were the best part of the meal in my opinion, tempura fried green beans with wasabi mayo and parmesan truffle french fries. Both were delicious.

One more thing I wanted to mention was I believe (especially at a high-end restaurant) that a manager should ALWAYS acknowledge every table. Just a simple &#34;Thank you for joining us tonight&#34; would have been great. Especially with an $80 bottle of wine sitting on the table, you&#39;d think they&#39;d want you to come back...well I won&#39;t be. I could have spent $200+ at Sullivan&#39;s and been much happier.

I would be shocked to see Eddie Merlot&#39;s sustain in a restaurant market like Naperville/Warrenville. Even if their food was on par with the competition (which it&#39;s not) this town is all about consistency and service when it comes to dining out. Of which Eddie&#39;s has neither according to all of the reviews.

My advice? Fire your management team and get a bulldog in there to take control of your lackluster service staff. Eddie&#39;s needs to seriously step up their game."
eddie-merlots-warrenville-warrenville-2,Toni S.,dCLlQfMJbajOFmcIyyAHMA,"Aurora, IL",0,1,1,33,5,KqKxYzkS21X5WbE60EdnOQ,4.0,2014-06-13,"Came here for my husband&#39;s 40th birthday dinner.  This was both of our first time here.  We made a reservation on, opentable.com, so they knew it was our first time as well and made us feel very welcome.   A few flaws, overall, but it was a very tasty choice.  They even presented a card, signed by the staff, for my husband&#39;s birthday.  Was a nice touch.

We were greeted, promptly and politely.  Our server, Angie, was very nice, funny and knowledgeable.  She came back enough times to make sure everything was alright.  Even when my husband&#39;s steak was a little under cooked, she quickly remedied the situation.  The manger, Kurt, came over as well, to make sure our visit was going well. 

I&#39;m torn with the decor.  In one hand, I found it to be very pretty, but on the other hand, the tile art and geometric shapes with bold colors and 20 ft, gigantic floor lamps seemed very 90&#39;s to me.  But I did enjoy the 90&#39;s and that&#39;s why I was torn. ;)  I like the tables how they were spaced and the comfortable chairs.  Every restaurant should be this comfy.

They have a very extensive wine and drink list.  Their drink prices are competitive with other fine restaurants.  I would have loved to try something, but wanted to keep the bill total at a reasonable amount.  

I knew it would be pricey.  We didn&#39;t have any alcoholic drinks and spent $130 before tip.  This included 2 soups, 2 entrees, a shared side and shared dessert.  The sides are large enough to share and range from $8-$10.  However, sharing a baked potato, just seemed messy and unattractive.  I don&#39;t understand why they can&#39;t make the portion sizes for one and cut the price in half.  There is no way I could justify spending $8 for my own baked potato.  Spending $4, for a smaller one, is reasonable.  I felt forced to choose something that we could both enjoy, instead of being more adventurous.

The French Onion soup had a more deep and complex flavor than most French Onion soups I&#39;ve tried.  Very good.

I had the 7 oz Fillet Mignon and my husband the Bison Ribeye.   Even though, the Bison had to be sent back to cook a little longer, both were very delicious.  They take a lot of pride in their hand picked, aged meats and it shows.  It&#39;s right up there with other top steakhouses.  I have just found a couple that are slightly more reasonably priced.  I&#39;ve been do other places where I&#39;ve ordered the same things in the same ambiance and good service and paid $80 for 2 people.  

We ordered the peanut butter pie, for dessert.  I understand why they need to keep it so cold, because it&#39;s almost like an ice cream cake, but it was a little hard to cut through.  It was awesome though.  I think that&#39;s what officially sent us in food coma.  It was big enough for 2 to share, even though they specifically have desserts labeled &#34;for two&#34;.

The whole dining experience seemed to take a little longer than normal, but I was fine with that, as this isn&#39;t &#34;just dinner&#34;, it&#39;s a dining experience.  If you&#39;re in a hurry, this will not be the place for you.

So as much as I would like to frequent here, the price will make me stay away more and save this for really special occasions."

When we came in they asked if we had a reservation, which I thought was a little strange because we only saw a couple of people in the restaurant. The host was pleasant and led us to a nice table by the fireplace. Our waitress was very good, and fun. The menu selections are extensive but some items seems a little too pricey for what they are. Overall, we were satisfied with the food. The steaks were perfectly done and tasty and the potato sides a good match for the beef.

Our waiter, David was attentive when the restaurant was empty, but when it came time to order dessert his attention has shifted to a table of eight he was serving and he sent another waiter over to take our order.

Appetizers (Gorgonzola stuffed peppers, steak tar tar, flatbreads) were delicious and they served some impressive steaks as well!
Also love the throwback cocktails that we should all start drinking again! Dark and stormy! Get it! 

Staff is very attentive and friendly. Restaurant is large, fancy, and has definitely upgraded from the former Max N Ermas chain that was here! They have private rooms available too- would be nice for a rehearsal dinner, shower, party, etc.  Downside was that the restrooms very hard to find!

Our first impression was that the parking lot was relatively empty and the square footage seemed enormous for a restaurant we hadn&#39;t heard much about. (We just live one town over). 

This is a higher end steak house, priced similarly to Capital Grill, ($40-$100 entrees) without the truly professional-level service and definitely without the gorgeous ambiance. 

When we walked in we were greeted in kind of an awkward way while a couple was checking in and seated in front of us and several (a few too many) staff kind of bumped into each other behind the counter and then dispersed. Then we were seated.

Service: The service was mixed. It was both formal and a little heavy-handed in that both the manager and the asst. manager visited our table to introduce themselves (we&#39;re trying to converse here, guys). While going through the menu and ordering the waitress was friendly and professional. Once we got our food, however, the waitress was not attentive enough and we actually did have to wait for a bit to get something. Then when she came back near the end of our dinner and asked about dessert I made a point of saying &#34;no, we have to get somewhere&#34; and then even after saying that, we had a 10 minute wait for the bill. I went out to get the car during this time. Once she picked up the card there was another 5 minute delay. This actually made us late for our event. 

Our charcuterie &amp; cheese tray was served by a junior staff (high school aged kid) and he wasn&#39;t sure about what all was on the plate. The waitress (in her 20s, fairly poised and professional) got flustered that he hadn&#39;t gotten it right and then took over for him but also couldn&#39;t identify all 6 items on the platter. We laughed it off but really, anyone bringing food to your table should be able to identify it for you, especially if the details are not listed in the menu as was the case with this.

Entertainment: There was a troubadour-y acoustic guitar playing singer who delivered a nice assortment of old standards and singer-songwriter numbers.

Decor: The decor was pretty ridiculous. It was all oversized and ostentatious. It kind of felt like you were on a cruise ship. Everything was really BIG and it was really LOUD and FLASHY. The tables and chairs were somewhat normal but the artwork, the light fixtures and those pillar things were really - well, tacky. It was as if they shopped for an artist based on how large they were able to make pieces. &#34;But - can you make something that&#39;s 8&#39; long by 5&#39; high? OK, here&#39;s $14,000.&#34;

Food: The food was tasty but nothing out of this world. My partner thought the steak preparations options were fairly limited. I opted for a &#34;budget&#34; option (cough) that was a $29 steak, which included a salad. His was in the mid-40s. We also had the charcuterie platter ($21) and a side of asparagus ($10) which was very generous but, again, nothing special. We each got a cocktail. Mine was a tall Tom Collins (yum). And then I ordered a glass of red with dinner.

There was a board in the lobby displaying various specials. We asked about them and the waitress told us she thought they were not going to be available til next week. (?) Why would they have that out there on display if not available? 

Overall, the food was well-prepared and good-tasting, but it was definitely over-priced for the somewhat limited menu options, somewhat inexperienced staff (for a restaurant at this level) and the tasteless decor. The next time we go on a date night to an upscale steak house, we&#39;d definitely choose Capital Grill over this."

Place has not been opened that long. In the old Max and Erma&#39;s place.
First the decor, one poster said Cheesecake Factory? That would be spot on!
Second, our group and one other table were the only ones in the restaurant.

Service was befuddled at best, one of our guest had a slight wine bath to his suit jacket, though props to the restaurant as they automatically guaranteed cleaning.

My chicken dish was very, very, very, very plain though it was cooked. The fish dishes at the table were soggy.

Salads were OK, though I said no nuts I received,,,,,,,, nuts! Not good :-(

Now here is where the 2 stars came in. One for the carrot cake and the other for the carrot cake. Darn good carrot cake!

My suggestion for this Eddie&#39;s ....... Take quick trip down to Louisville, KY and visit that Eddie Merlot location. Watch, listen, and learn. IMO Louisville is spot on from the door, to the dinner, to the check. Do this and your stars will rise!

The Naperville, Warrenville, and Lisle has tight competition so you have to be spot on. If not, tenure will be short lived."

The service was so horrible despite the lack of customers that I had to go to the bar to fetch the drinks we had ordered about 10 minutes earlier. I took one bite out of my $50 steak and it was fatty and grisly and unedible.  We left without eating and the manager comped us on the drinks and salad we had.

We each had steaks that were done more or less as promised: medium with some pink in the center.  (I would say it was more medium rare) The sides were wonderful! We had the best creamed spinach ever - very tasty and hot!  The chopped salad is a little different, with slightly different ingredients than most chopped salads, but it was SO GOOD!  It was represented as being a &#39;large&#39; salad, which I might not agree with.

The potato leek soup was very good, but I think some green herbs or chopped green onions on top would have made it a little more visually interesting.  White soup in a white bowl on a white plate.

Their &#39;wines by the glass&#39; bottles are 50% off on Sundays!

When I told friends and coworkers about our date here, they didn&#39;t know what we were talking about. They know the cantera area but not about Eddie Merlots. My mom had a gift card she wasn&#39;t going to use here so she gave it to me to use and it&#39;s a good thing, this place is far from cheap. We did our best to make it as cheap as we could, kept it to 2 drinks each, shared an entree, no desert and the bill still ended up being about $150 without tip. Yes, we could&#39;ve skipped the appetizer but that would&#39;ve been a HUGE mistake. The calamari was just unbelievable. I could&#39;ve eaten 3 more plates of that as my entree, but I&#39;m really glad that we decided on other food. The wife and I decided to split the aged ribeye. That was the best steak I have ever eaten in my life. Sure it was $75, but split between my wife and I, it was so worth the price. Plus I think it was a 24oz steak. I couldn&#39;t bear to think of taking home leftovers with how good it was. I think I ate maybe 3/4 of it. They also serve sides family style so we chose the mushroom medley and garlic mashed potatoes, both excellent choices. 

We were seated in the bar area and after seeing the main dining area, I&#39;m glad that we were seated near the bar. The bar area is very old world with dark wood, dark carpet and bucket seats. I felt like some kind of club member sitting there. The dining area is a lot brighter with some pretty neat wall decorations and lighting. The service was excellent. I wish I could remember our servers name but he was very knowledgable and made our experience so much better. He was funny, cordial and made us feel special. I really have no other area steakhouses to compare it to yet. I haven&#39;t tried Morton&#39;s or Sullivan&#39;s but Eddie Merlots set the bar pretty high."

That is not to say this place doesn&#39;t have potential if they focus themselves properly! 

EM&#39;s is located in a rather odd spot in front of the movie theater in Winfield, where the old Max &amp; Erma&#39;s used to be.  The decor, while inventive, has a little Alice in Wonderland feeling to it, with tall, mushroom-like pillars, but probably the most comfortable chairs I&#39;ve had the pleasure to sit in at at restaurant.  The wine room is encased in glass and sits dead center in the back of the restaurant, right in front of the kitchen.  It&#39;s a good conversation piece.  

Now comes the strange parts.  Despite it being a weekend night, the parking lot out front was vastly empty.  All blocked off for complimentary valet.  That would mean something to me in the city, but there was a whole empty parking lot on the side, so why block off the entire front of the restaurant? Valet is great when parking is scarce.  But when you&#39;re facing an empty lot, it seems preposterous. Not even inclement weather to force us to valet. They should really reconsider their valet section.  It&#39;s discouraging as it is now.  

Onto the food.  They have an interesting menu.  But much of it is suspiciously like one of my wife&#39;s favorite restaurants, the capital grille.  The heavy focus on steak, the Lobster macaroni and cheese, truffle fries, the extensive wine list, oh yeah, the prices.  So, Eddies and capital grille market themselves a little differently, but eddie Merlots is still rather new, and, well, you can tell.  

Can they cook a steak properly? Yes.  But the service, while not bad, was certainly not very good either, and not good enough when I&#39;m paying more than $100 per person.  The steak tray presentation was a disappointment.  The steaks looked a little gray, wrapped in Saran, and garnished with some old kale.  Our waiter described he steaks to us in a rehearsed manner, going so far as to explain to us that only 2% of the steaks are graded prime every year by the USDA.  I&#39;m here for a meal, not to be &#34;taught&#34; by my server.  

Now, the steaks were done properly, the Mac &amp; Cheese was good, but service just was unprofessional.  Not rude, just unpolished.  

The best part was coffee, which is French pressed, and the vanilla cognac flaming brownie, which was fun watch and better to eat.  

If I could be assured their service would improve, I could be convinced to go back.  But otherwise, I don&#39;t like paying $100/person for a server to condescend me.  I suspect Eddie Merlots thinks they are bigger and better than they are."

I checked their website weekly to see when they would open.  Once they opened I came here with a co-worker after work to have dinner and drinks.  

I am really torn in writing this review.  If I had the choice, it would be 2.5 stars.  We were seated in the dining area,  the place was almost entirely empty and looked more like the inside of a Cheesecake Factory than a steakhouse.  

We found the service to be prompt and courteous and it&#39;s the service we received that pushed this review from a 2 to a 3 star review.  

The wine list was unique as it listed wines by flavor profile rather than varietal or country of origin.  

My co-worker and I ordered the Caeser salads; you could tell they used anchovies as part of the dressing, which was a plus.  However, they applied way too much dressing to the dish to the point where it was ruined. There was so much dressing, the romaine lettuce was white.  

I had the bone-in filet and my co-worker had the Ahi Tuna.  We found the our entrees good, but not great. The filet was cooked to how I ordered it.   We also had the asparagus and the brocoli and found them just OK.  

Overall it wasn&#39;t a horrible dining experience, but the simple fact remains that for the prices we paid, there are other steakhouses that do it better."

When the night&#39;s manager came around inquiring as to our satisfaction, I mentioned the discrepancy in what the server described and what was delivered. He explained that the servers are told to refer to the fish as &#34;Sea Bass.&#34; Ummm, really?

the bad.
the service was HORRIBLE.  although our waitress was super friendly, she stopped after about 5 minutes of us being seated to let us know that she would be right by, then finally 15 minutes later we got our drink orders in.  15 minutes later we had our wine.  they were out of the salmon, and though suggestions were made, i am a firm believer that if something is out of stock you should offer something comparable for the same price - especially if you are going to recommend a dish nearly ten dollars more expensive.  our waitress completely forgot to put in our orders for our side dishes, so about 5 minutes after receiving our entrees and asking about them she confessed she forgot and it would take quite some time.  while i am glad she fessed up, she didn&#39;t offer to still put the order in and comp one or both of them - she did bring us some broccoli, not sure why since we didn&#39;t order it, but said we could have it on the house.  thanks, but no thanks dear - we if we didn&#39;t order it, we probably didn&#39;t want it - although i do appreciate the gesture, it didn&#39;t make much sense. either way, we passed on the sides so i can&#39;t review how they were.  i feel bad that the broccoli was most likely thrown away.  after dessert it took us at least, no exaggeration, 30 minutes for us to get the check.  our waitress had disappeared into thin air.

the okay.
had the sesame ahi tuna.  it was a little dry so only tasty with soy sauce - definitely not the best i&#39;ve ever had, but still good.
decor - very cheesecake factory, but comfortably lovely.  not &#34;fancy&#34; by any means nor romantic, although the lounge seemed a bit more &#34;sultry&#34;.  the chairs are the most comfortable you will ever find in a restaurant.  i must find those for my dining room.

the good.
free dessert for birthday boy, and good dessert at that!  
had a few bites of the crab legs which were good.
the bread was phenomenal.
my boyfriend rated his steak an 8/10.  not bad."

Service at Eddy Merlots was very very slow.  Being seated 30 mins past our 7:45 reservation is normal and was no problem. Without explanation, the friendly bar tender during our wait actually knew how to make a true Makers Mark Manhattan up in a Martini glass... Well done. Upon being seated we just sat until we became consciously aware that no server had come to the table for 15 mins or so.  Mostly no worries yet, we were enjoying time with friends. The first table visit was a Manager, Kurt who masterfully navigated a tour in the wine room to select the perfect wine... Well beyond my usual budget but a great choice pitched by a true wine expert. It took an additional 15 minutes for that bottle to be delivered to the table. Our server was friendly when she came around which was spotty. The food was very good, pricy but you know what your getting into.  By the time our meal ended which was otherwise a normal meal with appetizers, it was 11:15 and the atmosphere was gone because the restaurant was empty.  It was a celebration and I didn&#39;t leave mad, but was certainly put off finishing a giant steak dinner at nearly 11:00 at night.  A toss away explanation for long service was a distraction by two high end tables.  After what this meal cost, I rather thought my dinner was high end.  2 stars for service (excelt 3 for experience, 4 for food quality/value.  Did I mention the restaurant is beautiful.

FOLLOW UP:  On 2/19/2013 I received a letter from Kurt apologizing for the less than stellar service we received on my review above.  Enclosed was a $50 gift card and a personal invitation to return for the experience Eddy Merlot&#39;s strives to deliver.  Like I said above, I didn&#39;t leave mad but $450 dinners are not a norm for my humble life. Hand signed apology letters are not a norm either.  It&#39;s a classy move, thank you Kurt and Mr. Merlot.  Apology accepted."

The french onion soup was delicious! The asparagus was cooked perfectly and my filet was exactly as I had hoped. My husband ordered the pork chop and was a little disappointed that the sauce was so sweet. He was expecting something more savory and wished the menu had stated how sweet it was.

Sadly, the restaurant had a very costly error occur. The table next to ours ordered Steak Diane which is prepared table side. The cooktop generated so much smoke that the fire alarms were set off (not to mention my clothes, hair and coat smelled like I had been sitting next to a campfire). The firemen arrived and the manager handed out $25 gift cards for the inconvenience. My heart goes out to the server who caused the debacle, as he was just doing the job expected of him. Unless it&#39;s mixing a simple guacamole, I never understand the draw of table side. Servers should focus on service and food should be prepared by the chefs in the kitchen with proper ventilation."

* Nice ambience
* Good wine/spirits selection
* Good place for special occasion
* Delicious food (except below)
* Can purchase $100 of gift cards at Costco for $80 with no tax

Cons: 
* Service level severely BELOW par 
* Maybe kitchen problems resulted in service issues?
* 20% automatic service gratuity for larger parties (even if service is TERRIBLE!)
* SLOW, SLOW, SLOW
* If you&#39;re going to Lobsterfest, INSIST that your Lobsters come out HOT!  (read more below)

So, first night of Lobsterfest in 2013 and 3 of our party of 10 ordered the all-you-can eat lobster.  More than half of us have never been here and I&#39;m sorry to say our experience left us thinking we&#39;ll not likely go back (this might explain why other restaurants in vicinity are at/overcapacity on a Friday night and this restaurant is not.  It would be interesting to do dining surveys of patrons BEFORE they leave to see if our experience was unique or typical of this location). 

After being seated at 7:10 pm, took 10 minutes to get drink orders.  Another 10 minutes from them to come in 2-3 trips.  Though there was some support staff, throughout evening I felt like our 1 primary server was either overwhelmed with other tables or under-trained.  

Finally drinks came and being eager to start eating lobster, I was told I could not order in advance as the &#34;kitchen&#34; requires all of a tables order to placed at same time!  What??  In addition 2 ladies from our party were in the restroom so our server literally left WITHOUT taking any orders till they got back!  Ridiculous!   In the interim, server did come back after 3 minutes and said he could get my order in and fortunately he was going around table and our 2 females came back from the restroom &#34;in time&#34; to get their orders in.

Finally, after 45 minutes after being seated, first food came out.    Only 2 of us had an appetizer and it was 5-10 minutes after those coming out that entrees were served, including my 1st lobster!  HOWEVER, after 5 minutes table realized we didn&#39;t get the 5-6 side dishes that the TABLE ordered.  It was another 15 minutes till those came out (maybe server didn&#39;t get order submitted?). For the entrees that did come out (except for lobster, see below) our diners were pleased with the quality of the food (though prices are VERY $$$$ for steaks you get).

Now onto Lobsterfest, they will only serve one lobster at a time.  I should&#39;ve been more indignant as to WHY they were coming to my table not much warmer than room temperature.  Not sure why they cannot promptly serve a fresh HOT/Steamy lobster to me when we were seated right around the corner from the kitchen.  

PLUS, if you order LobsterFest, be prepared to WAIT.  It was 15-20 minutes between finishing lobster and getting next one.  I am QUITE sure of this!  I finished 8 and my friend ate 15.  Now, keep in mind our first lobsters came out at 8:05, my friend didn&#39;t get #14 lobster till 11:15 pm!  Hold up certainly wasn&#39;t on our end in finishing them.  Server would not place order for next lobster until you finished lobster.   This was done in quite literally 3 minutes or less per lobster to eat tail &amp; claw meet.

Desserts were tasty and enjoyed by all so they did get that right as well as non-lobster entrees.

So, let&#39;s recap.   For party of 10, tab of almost $1000 with mandatory 20% gratuity for poor service, can&#39;t say I would visit this place again.   If you do go and get LobsterFest, INSIST, INSIST your lobster come out hot if that&#39;s how you enjoy it."

A revision to $$$$$ is certainly in order!!!

$16.00 for a shrimp cocktail? $9.00 for a bowl of onion soup? $8.00 for mashed potatoes? And, $9.00 for macaroni &amp; cheese!!!! Really?
And I bet there are lots of places you can get a damn good filet for considerably less than $43.00.
Good place to go if you&#39;re rich or on a company expense account. However, if you want to enjoy a nice dinner, even on a special occasion, you can find several places where the food is just as good and you don&#39;t have to take out a loan to pay the bill.
And the high prices are on top of the numerous reviews citing much less than stellar service."

We then got filet, black and bleu scallops, prime meatloaf and Parmesan truffle fries.  Everything was delicious!  Eddie Merlot&#39;s is a very nice restaurant.  A bit pricey, but in line with the food quality.  We would return again for a special occasion or if we were looking for a nice restaurant."

That being said, I doubt that I would ever return.  My wife and I walked in and waited approximately 5 minutes before someone showed up to greet us and take us to our table.  While we were waiting, we both commented on the significant noise level in the restaurant.  We were then seated in a far corner of the restaurant (which I prefer), but at the next table were 6 people who were just drinking.  They were loud, obnoxious, and vulgar and just got worse throughout the entire meal.  I complained to the waiter, who just apologized and said that even though other people were complaining, there was nothing that could be done (how about stop serving them drinks?).  I am glad that I did not have any kids there, but apparently the management believed that the profits they were making on these people drinking was sufficient to offend the nearby patrons who were out for a meal."
eddie-merlots-warrenville-warrenville-2,Amy L.,HIO8nhFFe8zBrL8D_wp54A,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,4,20,zQ1Y14GPspycAKDwi2SDLQ,2.0,2012-05-31,"My husband and I ate at Eddie Merlot&#39;s last night and were not impressed at all.  The service was flat out terrible.  Our waitress must have been brand new and while I feel bad that she was extremely shy and unsure of things, I wasn&#39;t really looking for an expensive meal to be ruined.  We would expect a waiter/waitress at TGIFridays to provide the kind of service we got last night.  When you spend $170 on a meal (for 2) you expect much more.  

When I asked the waitress what the fish of the day selection was she looked straight up to the ceiling and said &#34;i&#39;m not sure&#34;.  I was shocked.  But then she said &#34;I can&#39;t pronounce it&#34;  That answer wasn&#39;t any better than the first.  I looked very confused and stumbled with my own words because I was in complete shock that was the answer she gave at such a &#34;nice&#34; restaurant.  

Other things to note that made our experience less than enjoyable was that I waited forever for a second cocktail.  My husbands was replenished quickly but I was never offered another in a timely manner.  I sat empty for too long and when our food was delivered I told the guy from the kitchen who brought it that I needed another drink.  A few minutes later our waitress came by and asked if everything was ok and I told her I needed a drink but that I thought the other gentleman was getting it.  Apparently there was a disconnect between the two.  I had to grab another waiter (who wasn&#39;t even tending to our table) to get someone&#39;s attention.  Very annoying!  

My husband ordered the steak marinated in bourbon and loved it and I ordered the stuffed shrimp.  I have to say mine wasn&#39;t that great.  I wished I would have ordered the filet.  Also we got Eddie&#39;s potatoes for a side and they were sooooo blan and tasteless.  I asked our waitress what was the most popular side and she mentioned the Eddie&#39;s potatoes.  I ceratinly don&#39;t know how these could be popular.  There&#39;s supposed to be a jalepeno flavor to them and we tasted nothing of the sort!  Our calamari we had for appetizer was nothing special either.  Honestly the rice bowl it came it was more interesting than the calamari itself. 

Overall, there was nothing about our meal that makes us want to come back.  It isn&#39;t fun to spend that kind of money on dinner and a babysitter only to have a &#34;meh&#34; evening.  We should have gone to our usual Morton&#39;s or Capital Grille."
eddie-merlots-warrenville-warrenville-2,Sarah T.,-hbqBTap0xS-qhZ_Np82zQ,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,0,31,VYjq0jAsLmnupSoe-BI0_w,3.0,2012-04-14,"I am giving this place a 3-star rating because the food overall is pretty good and the management was very nice and welcoming....

We went in on a Friday night and the restaurant wasn&#39;t overly crowded. We sat in the bar area and were warmly greeted by several of the managers. Our waitress was very friendly and overall I was impressed.

The problems we encountered began when our food was beginning to come out. First off, they sent out several of the wrong dishes, probably some confusion in the kitchen. We assured our waitress we understood, but she started to seem flustered by the whole incident. All of the food was great, besides one entree. A member of my party ordered a small filet to be cooked medium-rare. When the steak came out it was cold and we decided not to make a huge issue about it but decided to send it back. 

When the steak came out for the 2nd time, it was still cold. The manager stopped by and could tell we were a little disappointed. We were very kind when we told him about the steak. The manager handled the situation by apologizing and taking selected items off our bill and offered us a discount on our next visit.

Our server on the other hand was a different story. When she came out to give us our bill, she looked like she was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. She told our party she &#34;felt like crying&#34; after the steak incident. We once again assured her she did a great job and it was not her fault. We even left her 20 percent! She took our bill and ran off only to return a few minutes later and throw the bill on the table without saying bye or apologizing. Therefore, we left the restaurant feeling terrible and like &#34;those difficult customers,&#34; when we thought we handled the situation calmly."

To start with, it&#39;s hard to say too many bad things about this place but I think when you&#39;re paying top dollar for your meal you expect a bit extra in regard to service and attentiveness. Only a couple minor issues struck me.
Remember, if you go to EM you&#39;re going to pay at least $170/couple. 
Our waiter, John, was a great guy. He bantered back and forth with us, remembered our names, answered our questions, etc. Really a great guy. But drink orders were sometimes a little slow. But hey nbd. And that may not have been his fault. But remember, I&#39;m paying big coin. But I must say, the drinks were perfect and presented very well. Little touches like bourbon soaked cherries in the manhattan. Edible flowers on the silly fru-fru drink my friend had. Scotch and soda with a lemon wedge (not a twist) just like I like it! And a minor &#34;glitch&#34; on one drink fixed quickly. 
The food runners mixed up the salads and the entrees by presenting to the wrong person at the table...more than once...that really shouldn&#39;t happen. Again nbd but service is huge when the diner is paying big coin. 
We also had a &#34;sun&#34; in our face issue and it took just a little bit longer to solve the problem than I think it should. 
I got the impression that the staff just needs a bit more training/experience. 
How about the food? Well, we all thought it was really good. My wife and I split a romaine &#34;Waldorf&#34; salad and it was very nice. Table bread was offered and replenished and it was good. 
My wife had a huge t-bone steak covered with mushrooms and onions that she enjoyed and I had a churasco strip steak. It was cooked as ordered and delicious but it was touted to have chimichirri sauce with it. It did have some...I estimate about a tablespoon. Maybe they ran out. My friend had stuffed shrimp and said they were good. Another friend had a trio of steak, sausage, and shrimp, I think it was Cajun inspired. I didn&#39;t hear him complain. 
The group shared large side orders of asparagus...fine, brussel sprouts with chipollini onions and bacon...yummy, and mac and cheese...really good. 
We skipped desert but had really good and well presented French press coffee. 
All in all a fairly good experience and I&#39;m sure we will go back as a group. I think with a little more experience and training the staff will get into a groove and EM will be ready to do battle with Morton&#39;s or Gibson&#39;s."

This is a I&#39;m looking for authentic Mexican from good souls that treat you like family. Game. Set. Match.

Time of my visit: Dinner

My girlfriend and I were in the mood for some Mexican and wanted to try a new place.  So we chose this one.  I got very excited as they would deliver for free on orders over $10.  We got our order together and called in for delivery, only to be informed that they did not deliver on Sundays....

The delivery order turned into pick up order.  Once, I got to the place, I realized that the place was pretty much pick up, delivery or take out, there were absolutely no table to seat at.  We ordered 2 regular (bigger than junior) burritos, chips and guacamole with rice water.  My total was just under $24.  So I reached out for my AMEX, only to be told that they did not accept it.  Again, this is one of my big pet peeves, either accept them all or be cash only.

I got home and we started eating.  The burrito was not that large.  Unfortunately, as I started eating it, the tortilla started to fall apart.  I must say, I liked the way pork was seasoned and the quality was good as I did not come across any chewy peaces.

The chips bag looked a bit small, but I am sure the volume was compatible to other place.  Guacamole was really fresh and tasted really good!

C-.  I would like to come back, but I am not sure when it&#39;ll be.  I would not mind trying their al pastor tacos."

As we walked into Javi&#39;s, we noticed a pile of beef just sitting on the counter in back. No big deal...right?  It&#39;s a dive Mexican joint....the screen door doesn&#39;t even close properly. Awesome....my kind of place.  (Not really....but let&#39;s order some food to try it for ourselves)

We were prepped, looked at the menu online prior and really wanted to get our Mexican grub on!  However, there is a group ordering ahead of us. They start talking to the cashier about Halloween costumes......&#34;what are your costumes?....Are you dressing up?&#34;  (Whatever...no biggie....right?)  The cashier decides to not place their order and to get the next order like any &#34;normal&#34; establishment and then talk to her friends about whatever after....  Nope. Stop the presses!  She proceeds to walk over to the aforementioned pile of meat, reach around the pile of beef and grab her cell phone.  Walking back out....&#34;Here&#39;s our costumes! Yeah....really cute!&#34;  

We walked out.  We had seen and heard enough. 

....to the folks complaining about why their orders are taking so stinking long....I think we cracked the code. 

To those that have actually had food from Javi&#39;s....congrats on the miracle!  Hope you remained healthy too!

To those who think the health department needs to revisit.... we concur. 

Sorry Javi....Your Mexican food doesn&#39;t earn nor deserve any stars or our money in our book.  Way too many quality Mexican establishments in this area. 

As a footnote.... we decided to eat at a different downtown GE establishment. Over an hour later, after we finished dinner....we walked past Javi&#39;s again on our way to our car.... the pile of beef still sitting on the counter....untouched."

I came to my bfff Yelp to find a place in the area since I&#39;m unfamiliar. I stumbled across this place and decided to stop in. 

This is strictly a carry out restaurant. They had a few chairs lined up so you could sit and wait if you want. 

It&#39;s a family owned restaurant and they have their son there who&#39;s a little ham! He was adorable. He definitely made the wait more bearable with his crazy antics and entertaining personality.

I ordered 2 carne asada tacos with cilantro and onion. Anddddd elote!!! I love when places sell elote. They didn&#39;t skimp on the steak and it was well seasoned. My only complaint was they went a little too hard on the onion. I was tried to get as much off as I could but was difficult since I had to eat it in my car. The elote was pretty good just wish it had more spice to it. Total $10 and some change. 

My friend ordered the chicken taco with everything and a cheese quesadilla. She said both were delicious. $5

The steak taco was plain and ordinary.  I also tried the small chimichanga. While it tasted great, it was like an eggroll and much too small for the price. 

The Verde sauce is ok at best. The hot sauce has a bit of heat, but not overwhelming. Also, they provide generous amounts of lime. 

Overall, it&#39;s a solid taco takeout joint within Glen Ellyn , but pales in comparison to other taquiera places in terms of pricing and the amount of food."

So Javis comes into my view and I grab a spot and pull in. I walk in the door and it is a small floor space without tables so its a take out spot. No problem, I order a a pork burrito. I request a cup of red and green sauce  to go with it. I got home and unwrapped it, stood it up and took a bite. The pork is seasoned very well, there is a great flavor with every bite! I pull out the red sauce and put a dab on for the next bite. The consistency of the sauce screams freshly made as its not total liquid, it&#39;s got a bit of body to it and the taste really got my attention. It paired very nicely with the pork! The green was also good but didnt complement the pork as well as it might with a chicken burrito but its still a good sauce!

Ambiance: It&#39;s a take out spot....not dining in here.

He couldn&#39;t have been more than two, and yet there he was, chillin&#39; and taking in the sites of downtown Glen Ellyn. Not a sight you often see in these parts, but I kinda like it!

Others have mentioned a &#34;hole in the wall&#34; vibe here, and I definitely got that. Odd paint job, subpar lighting, no tables or counter, just three counter height chairs scattered around. But I could see into the kitchen, and it was clean. The two adults we encountered were friendly and made us feel like they were happy we were there. Also, as I will explain later, the food was good. So I really don&#39;t care about all the other stuff.

Javi&#39;s accepts cash only, but they did mention that they&#39;re working on getting a &#34;credit card machine&#34; (which is not so much a machine these days, as a tiny device that can connect to a smart phone, but who am I to complain?) It was sort of a fun challenge for my husband and I to scrape together enough cash for our meals.

Now, the food...I highly recommend trying the chile relleno. Best I&#39;ve ever had! The quesadilla was nothing to sneeze at either, but it was just overshadowed by that tasty, cheesy pepper. My husband liked his fajita meal as well, though it was served with chicken when he had ordered steak.

The location can&#39;t be beat. I love the walkability of our little downtowns. We&#39;ll be back to try some more, and to see Baby Javi taking in the sights out front. Though why he was eating a Subway sandwich and not a chile relleno, I&#39;ll never understand."

Got a torta, mini chimis, and tacos. Really good stuff.

Super nice and accommodating. Also got some free guac and chips."

I ordered for delivery in Lombard and they actually came it is the 3rd time I order and they never disappoint. 

I usually go for steak tacos with cilantro and onion. This time I ordered the lettuce, tomato, sour cream in them. Both were yummy great quality and fresh ingredients. I was bummed they had no horchata but I asked for Mexican coke and they had that so I was happy as it&#39;s much better than the one we get here. Delivery was quick, comes very chilled and food very hot.

Next, time I plan on stopping by to meet the infamous lil boy Javi. 

I WISH Lombard had Mexican food like this. Until then I&#39;ll happily order from Javi&#39;s!!!"

The couple who run it live in the city and make the treacherous commute each day, sometimes with their toddler son, the infamous &#34;Javi,&#34; in tow. They embody an old school work ethic, and they are always truly grateful for one&#39;s patronage. Their food is made fresh and is excellent. You won&#39;t find better takeout Mexican in the area. And the only sit-down Mexican that is better is A Toda Madre around the corner. But that&#39;s a completely different price point and experience.  Because they operate on a skeleton crew and make everything right there, wait times can be a bit long for takeout. But hey, you can spend the time you&#39;re  waiting thinking of the countless aphorisms in the English language that remind us that good things are worth the wait. Also, because they don&#39;t have a public restroom, they cannot have a seating area.

When you go--and you must!--order a burrito or nachos with steak. You won&#39;t be disappointed. Tacos al pastor...ridiculous. Rice and beans are always fresh, not crusted over from being reheated four times a week. Chile relleno is as good as the greatest pepper in the world smothered with cheese gets. 

So, if you&#39;ve got 15 minutes to wait and you&#39;re ready to be impressed, make little Javi&#39;s parents&#39; day and pay them a visit."

Normally we&#39;d go to Los Burritos Tapatios. However, after reading many of the positive reviews, we decided to give Javi&#39;s a try. I must say, I was impressed with their kindness even though we were walking in at 9:45pm, 15 minutes before closing. There was no attitude at all. I ordered a pastor taco and my husband ordered a steak burrito. Both were delicious and we agreed that the quality was better than Los B&#39;s. My husband said that Los B&#39;s burritos had a little more flavor, though probably from cooking with more fat(lard?).

Lets get down to the food. The tacos are really good. I just wish they would add tacos de lengua, and they didn&#39;t make agua de horchata seasonal!. The burritos are always a favorite in our office. The meat is always well cooked. The taco salads are excellent as well. Their green salsa is sooooooo good!!

We have tried burritos in several other places, and they were good.  But this was GREAT!  Three of us had the skirt steak burritos, while one had the chicken burrito.  All of us had guacamole put on them.

The burritos tortillas were slightly crisped and the meat was well seasoned.  But the flavor of the guacamole made them great!  

There is no sit down seating.  The whole place is a waiting area.  You can see right into the kitchen, which looked clean.  It certainly needs a paint job and some more seating for those who are waiting.  But really, who cares?  You go there to pick up your food.

Incredible. The meat flavorful, the beans seasoned nicely, and a bonus is that you can add extra meat if you want to! I think it&#39;s about comparable with Los, maybe not as large of a burrito as Los in diameter (it may have been the overabundance of beans there versus meat), but the quality and flavor surpasses that aspect. 

What a little town gem. I cannot wait to make my way through the menu.

I was greeted by little Javi as most people have, and he handed me a book to semi-read, he&#39;d come back and want to go through the book when he wasn&#39;t moving around or dancing. Adorable."

I had the steak and pork taco dinner. The steak taco was good -- I could have used a little bit more flavor from the meat, but it was still tasty; the pork was tender, flavorful and topped with a tangy, spicy tomatillo(?) sauce that made things even more delicious. My order included the traditional red/green sauces which both tasted fresh, with just the right amount of spice, and made an excellent counterpart to the steak.

Thank you Javi&#39;s Burrito for the great burrito.

Today, Wednesday November 5 2014, I tried a steak taco, and the steak tostada. The steak tostada had a sturdy flat hard shell as a foundation,  coated with thick past of delicious frijoles (smahed beans), covered with home style seasond steak, in top with lettuce tomatoes and shredded cheese.

The steak taco was was well made, the tortilla held the meat without breaking apart. Both items, the tostadas and the taco were delicious, and authentic. Javi&#39;s is definitely the taste of the town. Javi&#39;s Burrito has earned my 5 stars."

It reminds me of one of my favorite restaurants in California; a family run place that is proud to share their food with you. I have also lived in New Mexico and so I have eaten at lots of Mexican restaurants.
In New Mexico enchiladas and chile rellenos were the test of good food. Hardly ever do you find good enchiladas. Javi&#39;s enchiladas are the best I have found in a long time. I crave them and that speaks volumes! In New Mexico you are judged by your enchiladas and at gatherings it gets very competive! People always want you to try &#34;my enchiladas&#34;they are the best! Javi&#39;s are really delicious with the right amount of heat. The rellenos are very good and I appreciate that you put a tasty ranchero sauce on them. Some places neglect that touch. I lived in The Hatch Valley and have eaten the best chile that the SW has to offer. 
This is a really good place with honest Mexican food true to the spirit of Familia. I hope they prosper!"

Service = 4 stars.

Took my husband to On The Border (Naperville) tonight. He had never been to OTB before, and I wanted something different than our usual Korean or sushi.

The ambiance was nice... toasty warm inside on a 25F degree night, well-lit, and colorful decorations. Music playing was a nice, non-offensive, latino pop music, at a tolerable decibel.

We started with the Stacked Nachos appetizer. Folks, this is a huge appetizer that can feed a family of 4 people! Their nachos were better than many places, yet not as good as the ones I make for our family and friends. 

We ordered the El Patron entree and Pick 3 entree. Sadly, you couldn&#39;t taste the tamale or enchiladas because they were drowned in chile-con-carne sauce. The sauce was overwhelming and really ruined the meal. The carne asada was good. Black beans were average. Rice was bland compared to what is served at a more authentic Mexican restaurant. Complete mistake ordering the tacos. We are used to the authentic steak-cilantro-and onion tacos at Mexican restaurants. The ones OTB serves are American-style with lettuce, tomato and cheese, and tastes likeTaco Bell.

I know, the food at a chain restaurant isn&#39;t going to be as tasty and presentable as an independent family-owned restaurant, but OTB&#39;s food didn&#39;t &#39;hit-the-spot.&#39;  As far as Mexican chain restaurants, I still think (locally) Chevy&#39;s Mexican is best.

On the bright side, our server Roberto was very energetic, friendly, and attentive. Great personality and great service--a very happy employee. The appetizer arrived quickly--within 12 minutes. And the entrees arrived in good time--within 20 minutes."

My husband and I were starving but had limited time to eat (completely our fault). By the time we sat down we knew there was no way that we would be able to stay to eat our food bc we had somewhere to be. We felt embarrassed and told our waiter that we just wanted to take the food to go.  This guy completely understood and was so accomodating!! He brought us chips and salsa with water while we waited. Customer service at its finest! And the food was great! We can&#39;t wait to go back and actually enjoy our meal there :) hopefully we get the same waiter. Their menu looked amazing!

They had a man blowing up balloon animals for the kids (for tips) which I thought was a great idea to make the little ones happy too!

I was a little hesitant when we decided to drive down RT 59 and they picked this place but we went in anyway. It was a busy Saturday  night and we had about a 15 minute wait to be seated. Upon being seated we quickly were provided with bottomless chips and salsa and our drink orders were taken. Our waitress was spot on, we never had to wait too long for our refills as she busily worked multiple tables. The food was delish, obviously not authentic Mexican, but for a chain I was pleasantly surprised. Our friends were equally impressed."

I&#39;ve been here a few times before, but eating here today has proven that I will NEVER return.

After a morning of running errands, the fiance and I decided to stop for something to eat. Our first two choices had obnoxious wait times, so I stupidly suggested OTB as it was on our way home. It was 11:30 on a Sunday, so it wasn&#39;t busy but there were still a fair amount of people dining in. Still, it was no excuse for the lackadaisical service we encountered.

We walk in, and the hostess was pleasant. We requested a booth and were seated in one closest to the door, which was awesome considering the 17 degree temperature and windy weather. We glanced at the menu and waited for our server, who was MIA. That right there should have been a sign to leave. Five minutes later, our server Desiree finally showed up. We ordered Bloody Mary&#39;s ($3 each) and continued to browse the menu. She brought our drinks out but no chips and salsa. 

She then took our order. I settled on the Enchiladas Suizas - three enchiladas filled with Chicken Tinga and cheese. Topped with freshly made tomatillo cream sauce and melted Jack cheese. The fiance chose Ranchiladas Enchiladas- grilled premium Skirt Steak topped with ranchero sauce and Jack cheese, plus two Cheese &amp; Onion Enchiladas smothered with chile con carne.

She came back with our Bloody Mary&#39;s, which were disgusting. The garnishes are unique; bacon, a slice of jalapeno, jicama with chili powder sprinkled on it, and a lime wedge. This is obviously to deter you from the fact that the Bloody itself tasted like it was made with cocktail sauce. It was so bad, I only managed to drink half. And normally, I have two Bloody Mary&#39;s in one sitting. 

Five minutes later, Desiree happened to be walking by and exclaimed &#34;Oh! I forgot your chips and salsa. I&#39;m soooo sorry.&#34; She promptly brought us some, which I wish she didn&#39;t bother. The chips were ice cold. The salsa was so watery, dipping chips in them was pointless as nothing stuck to the chip. I was about to eat a second chip when our food showed up. Another bad sign, considering we placed our order not even five minutes prior. 

The fiance&#39;s steak was slightly smaller than a chalkboard eraser. When he tried to cut it, it was so rubbery and stringy, he could barely cut a piece off. He said his enchiladas weren&#39;t impressive, though he thought the rice and beans were good.

Then there was my cafeteria -style madness. The refried beans were nothing more than water and a few chunks of freeze dried beans in them. The rice was terribly bland and had flippin&#39; chunks of corn in it. The enchiladas themselves were something clearly cooked by a novice chef. Runny, runny, runny. Everything fell apart, the &#34;tinga&#34; chicken was flavorless, and the cheese was hardly noticeable. 

We both picked around our food, very disappointed. When Desiree came back to see how things were, the fiance said &#34;well actually...&#34; but didn&#39;t get to finish as Desiree proceeded to walk away and check on another table. Fed up, we choked down the nasty dog food only because we were hungry. The food was a product of a microwave, corner cutting, and pure carelessness. 

I stopped at the ladies&#39; room before our departure from hell. I walk in, and the entire floor is noticeably sticky. The bathroom stall had urine all around the toilet bowl and all over the seat. The sinks did NOT have hot water, and the water pressure was so light, it was more like a trickle. I&#39;m going to guess employees aren&#39;t too keen on washing up properly, otherwise this would not be an obvious issue to a patron.

So you&#39;re probably wondering why we didn&#39;t ask for a manager. For one, Desiree was clearly too busy to notice that we were not enjoying our meal. When the fiance attempted to say something, she walked away (as stated above). At that point, we didn&#39;t care for our meals to be comped nor would we have even dared to order something else. At that point we were so fed up, we just wanted to get the hell out of there. 

As I sit here writing this, I&#39;m debating whether to go make myself vomit in hopes that it will take away the knot in my stomach. $40 wasted and we both left hungry. You couldn&#39;t pay me to eat here again. 

If you&#39;re a fan of airline, hospital cafeteria, or elementary school food, you&#39;ll love this place. If you enjoy wasting money on cheap, flavorless food, then you should definitely eat here. And if you enjoy spending time either on or in front of the toilet after eating, then by all means hurry on down to On The Border."

Hear me out...there are only a few in the Chicagoland area, and they introduce specials occasionally, yet keep standards and favorites, and make an effort to keep up with changing tastes.

Tex Mex is probably my favorite type of cuisine and it&#39;s different than traditional or &#34;authentic&#34; Mexican, at least all that I&#39;ve had over the years.   OTB does this well-take for instance what I consider to be a staple food for this type of place-the cheese enchilada.   If a place can&#39;t do these well, then that tells me a lot.  OTB&#39;s are great-always the right amount of gooey cheese, some crunchy onions, perfectly cooked tortillas and a great meaty red sauce.

Another important test to me is their queso-it&#39;s exactly what those of us who grew up on Rotel and Velveeta have come to appreciate.  I&#39;ll imagine they use real cheese for a minute to just pretend.   Their chips and salsa are good, and their Spanish rice is as well.  Their steak, chicken and shrimp are good in anything they make.

I dine here a good amount since it&#39;s near my work and the staff are friendly.  A recent weekend evening dinner here with my family was probably the best experience I&#39;ve had their when there has been any crowd at all, but this is mostly a &#34;lifetime experience&#34; sort of review."

The hubs and I popped in for a casual date night and On the Boarder did not disappoint. The weather was great, so we decided to sit on their patio which was a great choice. It&#39;s fully enclosed but has windows all around opening on the walls half way. Our waitress was quick and pleasant which is always refreshing. 

We were originally going to do the chicken fajita special, but after scanning the menu we found an upgraded amazing option - the Ultimate Fajita! This included shrimp, beef, chicken and pork (the best of all worlds).  Of course with it being summer time, we&#39;re both trying to watch our weight (nevermind those margarita calories, everyone knows alcohol doesn&#39;t count), so we decided to split the entree. Our waitress reassured us that it would be plenty of food and she was dead on. It was the perfect portion to split! Everything about the meal was fresh and delicious. Can&#39;t complain about the unlimited chips and salsa too, am I right? 

It was a great dinner - very glad we went. Plus...our total bill was $25.62. Talk about a date night on a budget! Love going home with a full belly AND wallet. We&#39;ll definitely be back to check out the rest of their weekly specials."

My hubby and I arrived around 1:00pm on a Saturday. It was fairly busy. The server took our drink orders right away. He also brought us chips and salsa right away. The chips were thin but huge! They were like taco shells. The salsa was pretty good! A little too spicy for me (because I&#39;m a baby when it comes to spicy things) but still pretty good. I spilled some salsa on the menu and on myself so I used my napkin to wipe the salsa away. My hubby also spilled some salsa on his menu and used his napkin to clean it up. Soon after, the waiter brought both of us another napkin without us asking. Eventually, we both ran out of salsa and the server immediately brought us each another serving without us asking. My hubby had asked to make his meal spicy earlier when he was ordering his main course. As such, the waiter brought him some spicy salsa and said it was spicier than the first one. That was super nice of him. Then as I am dying from the spiciness of the mild salsa, I ran out of water. Here comes the server refilling my water. This is VERY RARE that we get this great of service at a restaurant! I was loving it.

I got the Lunch Shredded Beef and Cheese Burrito with Queso- with black beans and mexican rice. The black beans and mexican rice went well with each other. The burrito itself was actually pretty good, especially with it being drenched in Queso! This is also very rare that I actually enjoy a meal at a Mexican Restaurant- as Mexican is my least favorite food.

My husband got the Borduritto- Steak Burrito. He said it was good. He ate half of it while we were there around 2pm and finished the other half around 7pm. He ate and drank nothing else (besides water) in between 2-7 and after 7.Then around 10:30-11:00 he started feeling pain in his stomach. By midnight, he started vomiting. He then vomited a total of about 8 times throughout the night and the next day. Needless to say, we think he got food poisoning from the Steak Burrito. And our St Pattys weekend was ruined.

I called to talk to a Manager- just to warn them that we think we got food poisoning from their meat and they said if they hear a That is how my review went from a 4 star to a 1 star. Be careful!"

There is always people who dine out here. Waiters are good and I always ask them to suggest and they have never disappointed me. I would recommend sampler to every new comer. You can get the feel of of all the Mexican dishes in 1 go. Also you can choose meat of your choice. Cocktail on the base of apple cider is my favorite. Must go....

The drinks are very good, the chips are top notch, the salsa is tasty and the entrees are delicious and generous.  The queso is very good and if you join their &#34;Club Cantina&#34;, you get a coupon for a free queso or sopapillas (warning - don&#39;t expect this to be instant - the manager says it takes about a week to receive the coupon).

It&#39;s a very good Mexican restaurant.  It&#39;s not authentic Mexican if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for, but it&#39;s very good Tex-Mex style Mexican food.  I&#39;m a big fan of their margaritas."

No, this isn&#39;t an authentic Mexican restaurant, but that doesn&#39;t mean the food isn&#39;t good.  I&#39;m a fan of the quesadilla (they always make it for me without onions - yuck!).  I&#39;m also on the fish taco bandwagon - damn, these things are good no matter where I go it seems!  I got 3 fish tacos, rice, and a choice of refried or black beans.  I chose black beans and they were sprinkled with a little bit of cheese.  I haven&#39;t tried anything I didn&#39;t like here.  

Watch out - the salsa is spicy!  The guacamole is good, but the chips and salsa will keep coming!  They are really good about staying on top of that.

I used to go here for lunch with co-workers and indulge in a margarita.  That was a long time ago, I&#39;m a responsible citizen now.  And they got annoyed with me giggling like a schoolgirl as I returned to work.  Oops!  Try the sangria swirl!

I like dining here if I&#39;m shopping in the area; Fox Valley mall is right down the street.  Or just to meet up with friends or casually celebrate a birthday.  

This is basically a Chili&#39;s meets Mexican restaurant.  And it works.

Never had any issues with service or waiting."

I had the chicken tacos. The chicken is tender and seasoned just right. It happened to be my birthday.  My treat was some ice cream along with the staff singing Happy Birthday.

Overall it was  pleasant experience - the food was great and the guacamole was probably some of the best I&#39;ve ever had at a restaurant.  Everything came out quickly (drinks and food), which it should have since the rest of the place was pretty much empty.  The hostess/waitress seemed really frazzled when we first arrived and the crew was hollering in the back kitchen for the better part of our meal, so it was enough to be amusing and annoying but didn&#39;t disrupt our meal too much.  I&#39;d be curious to see how they operate when it is really busy during a dinner service but for our experience I&#39;d give it a solid 4 stars."

Very refreshing. I also have the veggie fajitas and are even better than words can describe. They include zucchini, and portobello along with the usual peppers and onions. Being a vegan, i appreciate the wait staff always asking when I order a veggie dish if I am. They then always direct me to the cilantro rice and black beans as sides. They also ask me if I want any other side to replace my cheese and sour cream. This is a huge plus in my book. Many times I can tell a server no cheese on an item and it&#39;s in one ear and our the other. I know this is a great place I can go eat with no issues."

When I have a hanker for Mexican Food, this is the place I go.  They have a mean chicken tortilla soup, which I generally order with extra avocado.  

I have given it a five, because in my 15 years of going there I have only had to send something back a couple of times, which is a pretty good track record considering that I frequent on average about once a week. Nancy and America are the best servers there, they have been there for a long time and generally know what I order when I come thru the door.  the tea is ALWAYS fresh, which is one of my key indicators of &#34;minding the details&#34;.  

You can expect to wait a little bit when the place is busy.  However, they keep the chips and homemade (somewhat) salsa coming, so it bridges the gap.  The queso dip is good if it&#39;s HOT!  But the guacamole just isn&#39;t good they seem to put too much of the bitter green into it, which spoils the taste.  So if it comes on the side of your meal, just ask for avocado instead.  

I&#39;m not always fond of the managers, as they seem stuffy, but I&#39;m not there for them.  The food is good, and if you navagate a good server you will have a pleasant experience."

I have a rule to never eat Mexican food unless there is accordion driven polka music blaring from the kitchen, but I received a $50 gift card that was good at On The Border and 2 other restaurants so we gave it a shot.

We started with avocado fries and empanadas, the fries where battered mush and empanadas were bland with their main ingredient being air.

I had the brisket tacos which consisted of a teaspoon of brisket on a flour tortilla loaded with onion straws, my wife had steak enchiladas which was meat rolled in to a tortillas and smothered with  a bad tasting enchiladas sauce and cheese. I guess if you don&#39;t smother your meal in sour cream (which we don&#39;t) you can&#39;t cover the mediocrity of their food

He said no and named several other Mexican beers. I settled on a Corona Light. He returned with water and then got my beer. He took our  order. I started grazing on the delicious chips and within 15 minutes we were served with our order. My wife had grilled chicken fajitas which provided an ample serving for a take-home portion. I had the Barbacoa Enchiladas, a good choice and fiilling. &#34;Speedy Gonzales&#34; could be the manager since the restaurant expedites it&#39;s operation so quickly.

There was no hostess to greet us, when we finally got a hostess we had to wait for more than 10 minutes to be asked what we&#39;d like to drink. We ordered both our drinks and dinner. When our drinks (with no straws, we had to flag down another server) were brought to us, a second waiter came with chips and salsa (the chips were stale), and our server told us that the second server is who will take care of us. The girl then proceeded to leave without even saying hi or asking if we needed anything. I think one of the cooks brought our food, he was so pleasant and friendly (perhaps the best service we got here).

I have seen these restaurants before across the country, but much preferred the taste of El Torito Grille (now THAT is salsa) or Acapulco. 

They weren&#39;t always owned by Brinker. Back in my high school days, I worked at Cozymel&#39;s, which was part of the Brinker chain and OTB was not... now they&#39;ve sold off Cozymel&#39;s and jumped on the OTB bandwagon.

I can say, their salsa is totally lacking. It just doesn&#39;t sit well with me. I&#39;m perhaps a salsa snob, but I&#39;ve had a whole lot better. I nearly want to eat the chips solo. Cozymel&#39;s salsa was (and probably still is) WAY better.

I asked for a non-alcoholic drink and the bartender recommended a fruity v-margarita. I chose a watermelon and it was darn good! They used fresh watermelon and ice. I couldn&#39;t have been happier and it only cost me $2.99. 

We sat in the bar and they offer happy hour special from Mon.-Wed., but we didn&#39;t want any. We both ordered combos. I chose a pick-two and my husband had a pick-three. I was REALLY pleased that they offer vegetarian rice and bean options in addition to the regular Spanish rice and refrieds. It was a really flavorful cilantro-lime rice and the black beans were nice and seasoned.

Overall, we felt the service was excellent, the prices reasonable, and the food, decent. We&#39;ll absolutely go back... but sure wish that salsa wasn&#39;t so poor."

That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a decent place for what it is, though. 

I hadn&#39;t been to an OTB in a while, but I won a $50 gift card at work so hell yes I was going! I checked out their menu online, and in addition to the typical Tex-Mex-y fare (fajitas, tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, etc.), there were a lot of new offerings as well, including items in the &#34;Fresh Grill&#34; section like the Honey Chipotle Chicken, Spice-Crusted Chicken, and Bacon-wrapped Shrimp and Steak Medallions. Pepper Jack Chicken Enchiladas, the make-your-own-fajita combo (with ingredients like grilled veggies including portobellas, and pulled pork), and Empanadas (which I rarely see on Mexican restaurant menus!) all called to me. 

We started out with Queso, just a bowl of the original (they also have queso fundido and queso blanco) while we contemplated our orders. It was heavy on the cilantro but otherwise good! Damn, have I missed this stuff! Why is it so hard to find plain queso in Chicago?? It&#39;s queso fundido or nothing here; I do not want a crumbled hamburger in my bowl of cheesy goodness, thanks. 

As far as entrees, I ordered the honey chipotle chicken, and the Shaken Margarita. Said margarita was tasty; boozy aplenty for me, but the problem was the glass -- it came in a narrow-necked glass (narrower than a Collins glass, even), so you got very little salt as there was very little rim! That&#39;s why margarita glasses have a big rim (or at least in my belief system): more salt! Who cares if it&#39;s pretty -- not enough salt!! 

The honey-chipotle chicken was quite good: just sweet enough (but not syrupy so), and offset by the slow burn of the chipotle peppers. Frankly I didn&#39;t expect it to be as good as it was. Sides were hit and miss, though. The lime cilantro rice was so infused with cilantro that I couldn&#39;t stand more than a bite (I really don&#39;t like cilantro; I think it tastes like soap -- but I have a friend who adores cilantro so this could be the dish for her!) The corn (described in the menu as &#34;tangy Mexican corn&#34;) was off the cob, came in a small dish and had some kind of sauce squeezed over it, i think butter-based, but what caused the &#34;tang&#34; was unidentifiable to me, and it caused a pool of grease to settle into the bottom of the dish! Eww. The mini &#34;loaf&#34; of jalapeno cornbread was good, the most successful side dish.

My folks got the old standbys of chicken fajitas and beef enchiladas, which they enjoyed. 

The place is loud, both in color scheme and in music (the entire time we were there, they were playing what I could only describe as house music in Spanish, if there is such a thing, but the tempo was so frenetic that it was anxiety-inducing. This isn&#39;t a dance club; people are trying to eat dinner and talk. At least turn it down a few notches.)

The hostess also did something that I hate when seating us: the place is half-empty and she steered us to sit beside a table full of kids. When she said, &#34;Is this okay?&#34; we shook our heads and she looked at us uncomprehendingly. People want space and peace! (As much as you can get in a place blasting Hispanic house music at top volume.) This has been your PSA for the day.

Is it the best Mexican food ever? Of course not. But after a margarita or two you may not care anyway. And if you have a free gift card you certainly won&#39;t!"

At worst, I was fearing bad food with un-fresh ingredients. At best, I was hoping for the over-attentive and eager servers.
My experience was somewhere in between, or a bit to the positive.
I had the Del Rio combo: a fish taco, a chicken chimichanga and an avocado sope, I think. It was very good, like 4 out of 5. Hot, decent portion, no complaints.
The service? Just fine, thank you. Not overly-attentive, but not a stranger either. And there were so many other servers constantly on patrol that we only had to ask if we needed anything.
As tentative as I was, going in, my experience was such that I have no qualms recommending this restaurant. I&#39;d go there again."

The place is always busy around the year. I have been going to this restaurant for last 7 years.  I am a vegetarian and one of my favorite reasons for going to this place is they have vegetarian menu. The furniture is old style and has elegant paintings on the wall. The place is bright with television surrounding the restaurant. It also has fast Mexican music. It is a family oriented restaurant. We go to this place around 5 times a year and we always go here for mother&#39;s day. The staff is always full of joy and they are really enthusiastic when it comes to starting a conversation with people. The staff always have positive attitude towards all the customers and recommend the best things on the menu. 
Fresh chips and spicy salsa are served as complimentary. One of the best things for appetizers it to get live guacamole. This is where the server comes to your table with fresh avocados and makes it in front of your face. Guacamole tastes tangy with the hint of cilantro and lime on top.
 Let&#39;s start off with the main course. The grilled avocado enchilada and grilled vegetable fajitas are must have for the main course, which comes with either smooth ranchero sauce or tomatillo sauce.  They serve sides of black beans and rice with it. You can smell the melting cheese in between enchiladas. The enchiladas are grilled to a perfect temperature where you can smell the roasted vegetables and peppers. There is the hot salsa in the enchilada which gives it a perfect combination for the taste. The beans are topped with cheese and cilantro lime rice on side makes it a delicious dish. 
The taste is good as the presentation of the meal. The service is really fast and efficient throughout your time. The staff is always there asking questions about your meal and refilling drinks when needed.
The portions of the meals are big in size, so leave some of your appetite for mouthwatering desserts. 
My favorite dessert is border brownie sundae which is one of the more appealing to you. When it is served it comes with ice cream on top of fresh baked brownie with chocolate sauce all over the plate. The texture of the brownie is soft and chocolaty. It is rich and creamy in taste. You get a never leaving feeling from the restaurant. 
The prices of the meals are around average starting from 8.99. It is one of the finest and fanciest Mexican cuisine around the city. Overall the experience at on the border was excellent. Some of the tips before going to the restaurant is that you must be craving for food, so you can maximize your appetite. Try to drink less in order to eat more, so you have a better sense of the food. A great family place where you can have some sweet memories. Try to get the couches for your seat which is very comfy. Take your time while eating and enjoy every bite. The staff is generous and caring, so be appreciative of them. Don&#39;t forget to take a family picture for the memory (Say Cheese!).  
I am totally obsessed with this place. I highly recommend everyone to go and try out on the border Mexican grill with your family and friends. This is the place where you can make yourself feel at home."

It takes forever to find a table during most weeknights, and especially weekends. The noise levels are pretty high, and the staff doesn&#39;t seem very motivated to me. 

One time we ordered flan for dessert and because they don&#39;t move it a lot (it doesn&#39;t get ordered often) the manager came to ask us if it&#39;s ok if they give us the one made a couple of days earlier. It smelled awefully egg-y in an off way, and we ended up not eating it after a spoonful or two -- and mind you I LOVE fland and creme caramel, this was just not fresh. If they know it&#39;s not fresh why even try? Just say we&#39;re out. I&#39;ve never been able to go back since that time because of the weirdness factor combined with the food quality and wait times -- preferring instead to go to Chevy&#39;s (which now closed) or Friaco&#39;s down the street."

Our waiter was better hidden than Taliban in Tora Bora.  Finally we found him and he was bus-ing tables - at the manager&#39;s request it turned out.  So the manager needs to hire more staff or needs his head examined.  For $10 margaritas this is a crappy value.  

The $10 margaritas are perfect for children who aren&#39;t supposed to consume alcohol.  Be sure to bring plenty of insulin shots for your corn syrup-rich (and ascorbic acid-rich) margaritas.  

The poor service tarnished decent food that I let fester unwittingly as I waited until cobwebs hung off me for some more chips to dip in my cheese and beans.  I really feel like a fool being ripped off like this."

The ambiance is nice, the drinks are yummy, and the portions are huge. And no matter how many times you have eaten them, you can never get enough of the fresh chips and salsa there. (Perhaps that is why the portions of entrees seem so huge :P)

I can usually tolerate hot food,as well as my wife and daughter,but todays salsa was hot. We told the waitress and she brought some left over from yesterday as they had a different chef in yesterday and that one was perfect. Great catch by waitress. Ingredients always fresh. They make their tortilla&#39;s right in front of you. Chips and salsa at no charge. Great Margarita&#39;s according to my wife and daughter.

I have three words for you to remember: carne asada tacos.  Seasoned carne asada, slightly spicy sauce, and those greasy yet delectable onion strings.  Oh, onion strings.  You make everything so much better.

You can find your regular Mexican fare here, but everything is a little more fried, a little cheesier, and a little over the top.  If you&#39;re in the right mood for it, it&#39;s delicious.

I&#39;ve been here more than 25 times I think and year I have went there 10 times itself. This place is awesome, but I deducted one point for this last time and the inconvenience. 

This place is consistently great besides this last time. Their drinks are amazing. I had the house margarita and that was great. It was lemony and a very clean taste. They also have great margaritas and daiquiris. 

The CHIPS AND SALSA!!!!!! The number one reason I go there is because of the chips and salsa. Their chips and salsa are fresh and warm and are usually the main reason I go there (along with their drinks). 

I have tried a lot of their food: 3 queso burrito, chimichanga, vegetable fajita, and the enchiladas. All the food is really good and the plates are really large. The servers are good too. 

The problem we faced this time was that we had made reservations earlier that day and told them we had a party of 20. Then when we got there they said that they don&#39;t hold reservations and that the wait starts from when you get to the restaurant so we ended up having to wait about an hour until there was room to seat our party. 

Overall, of course I will be back. I love this place!"

This place used to be ok. Years ago, I enjoyed coming here for the Grilled Steak Ensalata with walnuts and blue cheese. Then they removed it from the menu. And wouldn&#39;t offer it. And changed the chips from good to &#34;weird corn-tasting chips.&#34;

We had a terrible experience last night here. Me and 5 of my friends. 

Menu: would they stop redesigning it every 6 months? Every time I come in its like I need a road map to read their new confusing concept menu. The new menu makes the food pictures look gross. I was turned off immediately compared to the old menus. This place has gone down market since a few years ago. Ew.

Food: chips, gross. Chicken tortilla soup, gross (huge chunks of cheese? No crackers? ew!). Endless enchiladas: meat quality, poor, sauce, gross and possibly expired. Rice: old, luke warm, nasty, with too much corn. Ew ew ew. 

Service: non-existent. Ok, so our waiter, who was frat-boy on us, was in love with the woman at the table across the way. To the tune of standing there chatting at least 20 minutes. But that doesn&#39;t mean that a) our order doesn&#39;t get taken til we complain. Then b) our drinks are not refilled without us asking and then incorrectly refilled. c) then he almost dropped the incorrect pop all over me!!!!!! d) we had to ask for the bill. e) I had to ask for endless enchilladas. f) our coupon was not applied to the bill. 15 minutes later my friend went to a manager and asked him to fix it. He at least came over and gave us a few appetizer comps. Not that we&#39;ll be back. 

Save your energy. Go to Friaco&#39;s down the street. Authentic, reasonably priced, delicious, with good and friendly service. I&#39;m done with On The Border."

When I feel lazy and don&#39;t want to go into Aurora, I come here. The decor is gaudy and the service can be a hit or miss. The quality has gone down in the past couple of years. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a corporate decision but the food does not taste as good as before. The salsa use to be spicy now it&#39;s just a meh. Even the chips are about sub-par.

The sampler appetizer is great, and that&#39;s on top of the fresh, warm pretzel rolls with cheese butter. The sampler accommodates those that do not eat pork/beef (like us) but also others at the table that do.

That said, my favorite dish continues to be the Tuscan Brick Chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach. It&#39;s to die for! BUT do not leave without having dessert!! My go to is always the warm apple crumble with cinnamon ice cream!"

1. An hour to get our food - 6 meals (server only had 4 tables
2. Runner did not bring out some of the sides or dressings that server wrote down
3. Servers were sweating (get them some a/c) for only 4 tables?
4. It took roughly 30 minutes to get our bill back after they took our card
5. One of our guests had a birthday the &#34;free&#34; desert was smaller then a .99 ice cream cone from McDonald&#39;s

Now for the food...uh....not again. I don&#39;t know who made the salad dressings but they need to ease up on the mayonnaise.  The garlic ranch dressing tasted nothing like the name. The Cesar salad was lacking.....everything accept lettuce and the onion soup....(I am shaking my head). I just can&#39;t  (as the kids say).

I ordered a cheddar cheeseburger, Medium, with lettuce, tomato and raw onion and asked the waitress to bring yellow mustard.

My burger came but it had white cheese that was falling to the side and soaked the bun.
There were grilled onions on it. No tomato, raw onion, or lettuce. She brought the mustard and then I asked her about the onion, lettuce, and tomato and she answered, &#34;Oh, I will bring it.&#34;
Right, like after everything was cold. And, the raw onion were red onion ring type slices and no lettuce. I gave up. I was not paying for the meal and did not want to make a fuss.

The burger was charred, over salted, and medium red in the middle. I did not enjoy my meal. The waitress was not very attentive, because she had quite a few tables. This took place on a Tuesday night at around 6:30 pm.

I would not advise going to this restaurant unless you like high calorie, smothered food.
The grilled pork chop my brother ordered was the best at the table. The chicken entrees were gross looking. Just my opinion. I would take a pass. It is NOT the same restaurant as when it was first opened."

Let me preface this review by saying we came on a Wednesday afternoon 2:45 when I&#39;m sure most of the prep work was focused on getting prepared for the evening meal rush. 

The atmosphere was nice and the customer service was excellent. Sadly the downfall for me was the food. My wife and I shared the crab cake for an appetizer and I found it to be lackluster and soggy. I had the Prime cut hamburger and ordered it medium rare and was served a well done burger. That although still moist was underwhelming in its presentation and flavor. The fries were ok but very greasy. My wife ordered the Beer Can chicken and she was unimpressed with her plate of food as well. The manager came over and offered to replace my burger. We were in a time crunch and I didn&#39;t have time to wait so we thanked him. They took the burger off of our bill and that was generous. $18 and I ate less than half.

I love that they have the water carafe at the end of the table.  Our waitress was nice, her service was not overbearing and she was quick.

The pretzel bread and butter cheese spread - oh my heaven!!!  The cheese butter spread was awesome.  I ordered the BBQ combo: you get to choose 2 meats and sides.  I chose the grilled BBQ chicken and the BBQ ribs.  The chicken was ok, certainly not my favorite because it was too much work.  The BBQ ribs were awesome.  Slow cooked, sweet and mild flavored and easily fell off the bone.  I ordered as my sides, the corn bread and the cole slaw.  Cornbread had enough grit and was rather sweet than most corn breads i&#39;ve had.  Don&#39;t order the slaw...yuck.

Had no room for dessert but overall, the prices were fair.  Loved the atmosphere of this place."

When we arrived, the place was packed and there was a bit of a wait (35-45 minutes), but given we had no other place in mind, we decided to stick it out. The interior is really cool, with an open kitchen, you can see the staff working away cooking, plating and taking the food out to the patrons on the dining floor. Cool! Loved just watching the action around us! 
The service was great, for our waitress was very friendly and very attentive, this place is a well oiled machine! The food is amazing....very flavorful, and the portions were substantial! I honestly could not finish my meal! My partners meal was just as good, and he was able to do some damage to his plate.....
We really enjoyed our experience here at Weber, and we would be back again!!"

Both of my children had the kids chicken tenders meal. I really liked that the kids meals came with broccoli and fruit and not just tater tots. You get quite a bit for $6.95. The kids enjoyed their food. I ordered the filet mignon with roasted garlic mashed potatoes. It was delicious! I would definitely order that again. My parents split an order of the black angus meatloaf (you receive a large amount of food). They also enjoyed their meal and would recommend it. 

We arrived at this location at about 4:45pm. We wanted to get there before the dinner crowd. We sat in a large comfortable booth. Everyone was very friendly from the moment we walked in. Our waitress was very polite and was very attentive. We didn&#39;t wait too long for our food which was good because we were starving! Once, the dinner crowd arrived the restaurant became quite loud but that&#39;s expected. I did not realize how cramped some of the tables and chairs were until we tried to leave. Some people had the back of their chairs almost touching other guests chairs leaving little room to squeeze by. Aside from that, I would say our overall experience was very good.

I would absolutely go back. In fact, I joined their (free) rewards program while we were waiting to be seated. I earned points on our dinner that night. They have a sign and pamphlets in the entrance explaining how the reward program works."

I knew exactly where she was talking about. I have passed this place so many times but have never actually eaten there. So I figured, why not?

As soon as I walked in, the charcoal smell was very apparent in the restaurant. I loved it. It smelled like summer time barbecue....but in the winter. I found the restaurant very cozy as well. The unfinished look of the ceilings, the dark wood, and the dim lights all were very synergistic. 

Our server was very friendly. He appeared very enthusiastic and comfortable with all of what the restaurant had to offer. It&#39;s nice to have someone who knows the menu just so they can make recommendations and explain what each entree entails. 

For appetizer, we got the spinach artichoke dip. The dips was phenomenal. Real artichoke in there. And it was served with pita. I decided to order salmon with a side of cole slaw which were very clean, light, and delicious. I was also able to try the seasonal pasta and bistro steak. I really enjoyed those flavors too. I also am a big fan of their pretzel bread - a different take on bread. Very soft and tasty. 

All in all, very good experience here. I like their style and unique takes on food. Whenever my bank account allows for it, I will be coming back."

We had a reservation for a New Year dinner, front staff was OK, we got the table fairly quickly and than our excuse of waitress showed up. I did hear her complaint to other patrons about being tired but I&#39;ve been left with the impression she just didn&#39;t care. 
Never said her name, never mentioned anything about New Year special, didn&#39;t recommend anything, never checked on the quality of food  and after all couldn&#39;t care any more if we walked away or dined in. To go even further we haven&#39;t been given clean knifes for steak so we&#39;ve used the ones from appetizers, kind of uncommon if you are paying $100+ for dinner.

It took time to get anything done, table wasn&#39;t cleaned up during dinner, I&#39;ve felt like we have been more of an intruder than guests, after all food was good as we have expected from Weber but the service was so sub par I&#39;ve decided to share this. 
We have been dining at Schamburg location for years and never had bad experience, Lombard on other hand can&#39;t compare to them, very bad service, lot&#39;s of long sad faces people working there, kind of depressing."
weber-grill-restaurant-lombard,Nic Z.,drzHAHTHFnThHW0R0rOdDQ,"Silicon Valley, CA",1,1,1,180,2,UtAzFhk1QSTDUJLDVmUqJA,2.0,2014-12-29,"We frequently dine at the Weber Grill in Schaumburg and occasionally the one downtown. We decided to venture to Oakbrook for a change. We had a reservation at Weber and were seated about 5-10 minutes after it. Our table was nice, and the ambiance in the restaurant was lovely.

Our server was pretty aloof, and things started going wrong already with the drinks. A Bloody Mary came almost clear (it should be a nice red... it&#39;s a &#34;Bloody&#34; Mary, after all) and had no vodka to boot. We were afraid it was all vodka judging how clear it was, but one sip revealed the opposite. Water. Bizarre... In 60+ visits to Weber over the years, I have never had a Bloody messed up.

Long story short, numerous things went wrong or were disappointing in between drinks and our meal. The entrees (nothing complicated) took almost an hour and half, and we ordered them at the same time as our appetizers. The worst offense was that my burger arrived wrong. The waitress realized this as she was handing it to me, and she pulled it back before setting it down and goes, &#34;That&#39;s not yours!&#34; How you mess up a turkey burger, when there&#39;s ONE on the menu, is beyond me. (She brought out some beef burger with bacon, etc.) She came back about five minutes later and said I would have my correct burger in three minutes exactly. I asked if it would be easier to order something else, as I know I&#39;m the slowest eater of my entire family and they had their food, but she reassured us once again that my burger would be out in 3 minutes flat.

More than 15 minutes later, I still had no burger. I told my family to start eating so their food wouldn&#39;t get cold. My burger finally came more than 20 minutes later - everyone else had finished eating - and I quite frankly had no appetite left after the disastrous meal. This was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back.

As much as we love Weber, it will take all of us awhile to even think about going back. They lost us for an indefinite amount of time. Really sad."

So, there were 8 of us for this meal and my husband and I were the only ones who had eaten here before.  The others were excited to try the place. Four ladies ordered the prime rib.  Not one really enjoyed it.  It was salty and we did not enjoy the smokey flavor.  Besides, the food was just barely warm as though it had been sitting for a while before being served. 
Service was good, not outstanding.  Most items were overpriced.  We were accommodated separate checks and that was appreciated.  Concensus is that we would not return."

I spent over  $220 with tip and her service was sub par.  Didn&#39;t introduce herself, asked if we had been there before, or showed us the menu. The bus boys gave us more attention and even brought us extra bread!  When I asked for the dessert menu, she put her finger up and said we had to wait until she got the other table next to us dessert order.  She could have just said of course be back soon, and taken 5-10 minutes.  Literally I have receievd better service at Culver&#39;s. Disappointed at service but at least the food was great even though we waited about 30 mins for it.

The food was decent, drinks were good (I recommend the Old Fashion) and the staff was friendly and nice. However, this was easily the worst ambiance I have ever experienced at a restaurant. At one point shortly after we had been seated, there were three different people talking on their cell phones, at their tables. One couple face timed someone, finished their conversation and then immediately left the restaurant...That couldn&#39;t wait until the car? Hello? Manners? Awareness of the setting you are in?

While the food was good, the service was mediocre at best. We sat a bit before water and very tasty pretzel rolls arrived (Sat nite, house full but not really hopping). Waitress  seemed in a rush, asking about drink orders and starters before we had a chance to look at the menu. Hubby asked about a certain beverage and was told she had not tried it. Honest, I guess... She also asked for the dinner orders right away. We split the Romaine wedge salad, very good, with blue cheese, bacon, a plethora of cherry tomato halves, and grilled sweet onion bits. Hubby had crab cakes, good, tasted like sautéed in butter-but no lump meat in there. I had the 7 ounce filet, done right and well seasoned. Sides of sautéed spinach (excellent!) and garlic mashed potatoes. We had an extra side of mashed sweet potatoes, which honestly, I expected a bit more than a teaspoonful of brown sugar-maple sprinkle on top.  They have a dessert menu as well as a dessert tray. We had to ask to see the tray, and waitress seemed unclear about the offerings. She  did not even name a couple if items on the tray. We asked if cappuccinos were available and were told only espresso. Heck, if you have the equipment to make an espresso, how difficult is it to foam some milk? We settled for coffee. The available cheesecake was amaretto Oreo, which is not a good combination and tasted strange (waitress recommended). The food was mostly good, but Weber&#39;s in Lombard is not very high on my &#34;return&#34; restaurant list. I did not feel welcome or valued there."

The service was very good but it ended there.  My husband had the beer can chicken, the skin did not have that golden brown grill look, it almost looked boiled.  Had the skirt steak which had good flavor but was cold along with the other sides.  The chocolate bundt cake was very dry, four of us did not even finish it and it&#39;s very small.

Prices are in line with the higher end steak houses like gibsons, portions are much smaller and not nearly as good.

I just did not get that &#34;Weber grill&#34; concept when the food did not seem anything like you would expect.

Would not recommend and no need to return."

The rotecery chicken at Sams is better.  It will be at least 10 years before I want to go again.

The only issue we had is our son did find some broken glass in the booth, but when we told our server about the issue, she was incredibly appologetic and offered to move us to another table.  Soon after the manager came by to tell us how very sorry they were that we found glass in our booth.

There was a bit of confusion at the hostess stand, and our hostess walked all the way to the table without checking if we were behind her, and another guy had to help us over. They seated us right outside a party room, so there was a ton of foot traffic around our table, which I guess should be expected on a Saturday, but the restaurant itself could use to be a little more spacious. The food was good as always, but the server forgot my side salad, and we waiting about 10 minutes for the waitress to come check on us to alert her that it was never brought out.

The ribs tasted old, the beef was tough and the shrimp overcooked. We had to ask to see the desert tray. The waitress did split the dinner salad for us. You can purchase a larger variety of their seasoning in your local grocery store than you can at their restaurant. I was just visiting the Chicago area for my first time. There are a lot of really good restaurants in the area. I think this one was more about the hype. I am glad that I tried it. I am not sure how fast I would return.

Over all the apps, entrees, desserts and drinks are all delicious and usually the service is on-par with 4-5 stars. My family recently dined here about a month ago and experienced one of the most disappointing experiences as our waiter was a con-artist who not only attempted to over-charge us by ringing up items 2x but also told us that meals could not be prepared to order and was just overall awful. It&#39;s important to note that after providing feedback on the experience, the manager, John G., called me the next day to discuss the experience I had and was of the utmost concerned, understanding, and considerate to our distasteful experience and really attempted to remedy the awful taste we still had in our mouths due to that waiter&#39;s many serving faux-paus.

The food is always exceptional and the service good.

Based on this good experience, we booked a private event in the their Lakeview Room recently and were very pleased with everything.

We received many compliments from our guests regarding the nice atmosphere of the room, the great food and the exceptional service.

The only negative thing I can think of to say is that a couple of times an item was not included in our carry out order so I always check the order to be sure everything is included before departing the premises."

I had a pork chop bone-in with mashed sweet potatoes and sautéed spinach.

Then along came a friend with a gluten allergy and here I was, staring at their GF menu and thinking, why not give them another chance. So glad I did, because Weber Grill is again on my go-to list. While the 3 of us just ordered burgers for lunch, these burgers, including the gluten free friends, was so yummy and fresh. We ordered a side Caesar salad, which was served in a shell bowl; tasty, fresh and quite substantial for only $4. This was lunchtime, but we couldn&#39;t help noticing the colorful entrees other tables ordered, with giant slices of cornbread. The pretzel rolls with cheese butter are outstanding and tempting, even when ordering burgers. We all shared the decadent brownie sundae which was every bit decadent, moist and delicious - the gluten definitely wasn&#39;t missed. 

While I&#39;m not a red meat expert and hamburgers are not my forte, I can say that the cheese burger at Weber Grill stands as one of the best anywhere in Chicagoland. Add a good server, such as Cole, and the result is a great experience - one where you&#39;ll want to come back!!"

I was surprised by the small celebration cake for my birthday.  It was an unexpected little previously frozen cake.  (What do you expect for free?)

The Lombard location is definitely less crowded than the Chicago place."

The steaks are fantastic, the ribs are fall off the bone, the beer can chicken is moist, and the burgers are awesome.

However it&#39;s really good. I&#39;ve heard complaints of orders being wrong or not cooked to liking. I&#39;ve never had a problem with the service or my steaks coming out incorrectly.

Thankfully I made reservations because it seems like there was a long wait.  The complimentary valet was a nice touch!  Before coming I joined the Weber Grill Club and I highly recommend doing it if you&#39;re planning a meal here.  First of all, you get a coupon worth $20 during the month of your birthday.  Plus while we were waiting for our food a server came over with some samples of beer can chicken salad.  Yum.  I actually double checked my account at this time to make sure I hadn&#39;t signed up for something I was going to have to pay for... it seemed too good to be true!  We ordered some type of onion ring thing for our appetizer.  I normally love everything onion but I wasn&#39;t really a fan of it.  My boyfriend liked it so I don&#39;t think anything was wrong with it, it just wasn&#39;t my taste.  For our dinners I had the meatloaf with the macaroni and cheese and the garlic mashed potatoes.  It was excellent.  I couldn&#39;t eat all of it and it was just as good as leftovers the next day.  My boyfriend had the Delmonico steak which he said was really good.  With the coupon, our total was under $50!  Granted, we only had pop and not drinks, but that was a great deal!  I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

I have a feeling it was an off night or maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  I did the BBQ combo and got the Chicken quarter and the Brisket.  The chicken was a dry and so was the brisket. The brisket did have a nice smoke ring but really needed the sauce to add flavor.

We were seated right away with the option of inside or outside.  Our server was excellent over the evening and very kind to come back many times when she realized we had not seen each other in a while and were catching up.

I had the Mahi Mahi with mango salsa and green beans (a great recommendation by the waitress). The fish was cooked perfectly. My girlfriend had the crab cakes...delicious! And my gluten free friend had the Mediterranean Veggie Grilled Salad--huge portion--definitely 2 meals for her. I had to try the house favorite dessert: s&#39;mores chocolate lava cake. Wow, a decadent version of a childhood favorite - as my girlfriend said &#34;oh, that is too good!&#34;

Not only is the food good here, but the staff are great; very friendly!  I usually have a mid afternoon lunch in the bar.  The atmospher is always great, friendly bartenders and good conversation if you feel like chatting.

I do have to start out by saying we were a party of seven on Valentine&#39;s weekend. I did call several restaurants in the area well in advance and they were the only one that would accept our reservation so I was appreciative for that. We had made plans for our family to gather for an occasion and Valentine&#39;s Day never crossed my mind when we picked the day. 
We arrived for our reservation and our table was not ready. We had a long wait in the smoke filled dingy lobby. Finally our table was ready. &#34;A large booth&#34; became available and was presented to us like we won the lottery. I had huge reservations about this because three members of our group our left handed. This is a recipe for disaster. I think our group was tired and hungry and were just happy to be seated. I suggested we wait a bit longer but they insisted we were ok but we weren&#39;t. 

On to the meal. It was just OK. The waitress was a big factor. She had no personality. It was difficult to even get water. No dirty dishes were removed without a request by us and we barely had enough room as it was. My meal order was wrong and I only received half my order and then had a long wait for the rest. Drinks.... Meh. I could go on and on but I will end it be encouraging you to try one of the other great restaurants in the area."

Their very cozy-looking dining room was full due to Thanksgiving reservations, but we were seated in their also-cozy bar area.

We were offered their Thanksgiving prix fixe but decided to just order off the menu as we had a Thanksgiving tasting already booked later in the evening at another restaurant.

  Our waitress was so jovial and laid back, it made the experience that much more fun.

We started by ordering their crab cake appetizer.  It is described thus: 
&#34;Tender Crab, Poblano Pepper, Smoked Corn, Black Bean &amp; Tomato Salsa, Avocado, Chipotle Mayo&#34;

Though looking back, I don&#39;t think we actually got any poblano pepper. Moreover, I tasted bell peppers in the corn and black bean medley. Still the crab cake was cooked perfectly with ample crab meat - yum! The avocado was also good and paired well with the crabmeat.

My hubby ordered a bloody mary, suggested as foursquare tip, that came with a beer back and a skewer of sausage and other treats. This must be a Chicago thing!  He liked the bloody mary ok - better than most, but still in the lead is the bloody mary at Tavern on Rush.  He was however a fan of the Weber beer so he ordered one.

I had a white fume blanc the waitress suggested and let me taste prior to ordering. It was simple but lovely and went well with our food.

Next up was the caesar salad - small, but with a great home-made dressing and shaved parmesan. All in all, another hit!!

Finally it was time for our main courses. I&#39;d taken a leap by ordering the wood-fired, seasonal flat bread with butternut squash and pesto.  To me, it was kind of boring. The bread was really good but I just didn&#39;t care for the pizza itself. While I found it bland, my hubby really enjoyed it.   To each his own!

Theron ordered the signature ribs and - O M G - these ribs literally were &#39;fall off the bone&#39; &#39;melt in your mouth&#39; delicious!! Their sauce was amazing and perfectly suited to the delectably crunchy on the outside, sumptuous on the inside, ribs.

Good job Weber!  We will definitely return!

Oh, and to make the lunch even sweeter, the Houston Texans beat the Detroit Lions in a really close, awesome, edge-of-your-seat football game!"

Even the few times where a server forgot something or there was a mistake with the food, it was always quickly corrected and never anything I held against them as a business.  Today however, we had family in from out of town and thought this would be a great place to have everyone. We had a large group, 7 adults and 7 children . For whatever the reason, we had 2 servers. It was only 12 in the afternoon and we were literally the only group in the place. Maybe one of the servers was new...who knows. But with that being said, our service should have been on perfect.  I cant say that the servers weren&#39;t friendly, they were polite. Nothing like what I have come to expect from Weber Grill, but they were nice.  The problem was that everything was so slow.  They weren&#39;t bringing out a tray of drinks, they were bringing out 2 drinks at a time.  The food was served the same way.  At this point, I was kind of irritated with the my whole expirence.

I worked as a waitress for 8 years. So i am always empithetic to servers and i never hold them accountable for things that i know are out of their control.  But this time, i felt like the only thing that bothered me about this place was the service. Empty drinks and old plates and utencils were never taken off the table, at no point did EITHER of the servers ever ask if there was anything we needed. I felt like we were constantly tracking them down.  Again, they were nice people, but the fact that there was so few tables, there was no reason for such unattentive service."

As soon as you get out of the car, in fact even before that, you can smell the fired up grills! Plus the photo op with the Paul Bunyan sized grill outside is worth the trip alone!

Walking in you get a peek at some of the giant grills that your meal will be cooked on - some are charcoal/wood and some are gas - it really is fascinating to watch.

The ambiance is like a casual steakhouse. Nice for a romantic dinner, but still perfectly fine for families as well. 

My hubby had the grilled chicken caesar salad (really??) - which was really good - the oldest and I chose the BBQ combo. Mine with meatloaf, and brisket, his with meatloaf and ribs. We both loved it. The meatloaf really was amazing - he tried to tell me mine was still better....please honey, I have had my own meatloaf, and while it is good, this was levels above - but it was sweet of him to lie to me!

Little guy had the kids steak skewers - I was skeptical about how many steak skewers we would all be dining on that evening, but he demolished everything on his plate - which only happens at few establishments. We didn&#39;t even get to try!

Service was a little slow, but they were packed. I would not hesitate to go back, that meatloaf is calling me....."

The whiskey cocktails were fine, a little on the sweet side but not terrible. 

I had the ribeye. It was bland, and too tough for the price point. They claim it&#39;s dry-aged. I&#39;ve had aged beef many times, and this certainly didn&#39;t taste like it. There was very little fat inside the steak, which of course makes it lean and tough. There was a ton of sinew and gristle though, which didn&#39;t help. In fairness, there was a nice charred spot on one side that had a glorious flavor, albeit a rough texture. Honestly though, my jaw was hurting after eating most of the edible portions of the steak. 

I subbed fries instead of mashed potatoes ($1 extra), they were alright, shoestring style, allegedly Parmesan fries but just tasted like fries. Meh. 

I had a side of their beets with goat cheese and pecans. This was pretty decent, although again, they claim they&#39;re grilled or something... no grill or fire-y flavor, but I like beets so whatevs. 

The service was alright, not great, not bad, just very mediocre. 

I probably won&#39;t be heading back there, at least not for steak."

The side sweet potatoes were amazing - whipped too! Weber brings you out pretzel rolls before your meal with a sinful butter (sweet). I only had 1/2 of a roll. Glad I did otherwise I would not have been able to eat my burger. For my drink had a berghoff root beer (they bring it in the bottle) - draft from chicago. Very good experience with the service. I&#39;ll be back the next time I&#39;m craving a grilled burger.

Ordered the brisket with a quarter barbecue chicken. Had a side of macaroni and cheese and mashed sweet potatoes. Both the chicken and briskit lacked flavor. The sides were definitely good. Was looking for briskit similar to what I got when I went to Texas last year. Definitely didn&#39;t get it here.

We were seated in a back room that was packed to the gills with people. Thankfully, we were against the back wall, so no one was banging on my chair all night or anything annoying of that nature.  Our server was pretty nice and helpful when we were trying to decide between things like pulled pork and beef brisket. He knew his meat which was a plus.  What wasn&#39;t a plus was that our kind server forgot our appetizer. But the food arrived so quickly that we didn&#39;t have much time to complain. It wasn&#39;t on the bill, so I had very little to complain about except that I had consumed far fewer calories that evening and then had room for dessert. So thanks friendly server for leaving me room for dessert!  ;-)

The menu has a lot of options, but we prefer getting combos and then sharing. If you have a few people at the table, you can ultimately try a little of everything. Glad we&#39;re good with sharing because I tried the smoked sausage and really enjoyed it!  

The only other meh thing was that you stink like a smokey grill when you leave here, but the tasty meal will probably have you forgetting about that pretty quickly."

I started with my dirty martini not bad, I snacked on the pretzel bread to slow the buzz down. Nice place very inviting and friendly. Our server was right on. I had the combo of ribs and brisket with sides of slaw and broccoli. I liked the slaw nice and creamy and tasty, broccoli was good. The brisket not bad and the ribs were delicious. The ribs just fell off the bones and were yummy. The sauce was pretty good like a little more bite to it but it works just fine. Finished with a second martini and was a happy boy."

I am thinking it&#39;s been almost  20 years. The atmosphere is great. Lots of elbow room. It was a snowy Saturday afternoon, so the crowd was light and the service great. We started with a couple of drinks from Smokey Joe&#39;s bar. Not sure why they are separated from each other, but it is called out on the bill. My drink was a little sweet, but they were heavy pours. I ordered the combo with ribs and meatloaf. ( I had just come from the mall and was reminiscing about the meatloaf at Marshall Fields. This wasn&#39;t even close) The ribs on the other hand were outstanding. Some of the best I have ever had. The sauce was sweet and smokey. Now I don&#39;t like to much of either, but this sauce walked the line. The slaw was thick and creamy. I would have preferred a little bite to it. This had none. The mashed sweet potato&#39;s were nice and buttery. The cornbread was flavorful and held itself together nicely. I saw two plates of Onion rings piled high go by and thought. Next time. No bread! It was a pleasant enough experience. I would come back for the food. Hopefully the service holds up when their busy."

I hadn&#39;t been in years to Weber but was excited as it was my birthday and I saw the Weber Grill near my home I just moved into.  The reservation I noted was messed up with open table by mistake and I called and they were very accommodating to my group increase.  

Of course I was running late and they called to check on me as I was 5 minutes behind.  They sat my guest and was so kind to me when I arrived.  The waiter was patient and kind and even when we had a couple of mishaps with the food and a grasshopper on the wall they were so accommodating.  

The food was okay but the service made it better than anything I can explain.  They made the little things become the best thing. 

Finally the small touch that sealed the &#34;I will forever be a patron&#34;, they knew it was my birthday and when I was going through my cards from friends there was a card from them stating Happy Birthday.  The personal touch made it all the worth while.  I will be back soon."

Seeing a decent rating here, we figured why not?

We made reservations for 8:30, and upon arriving at 8:38 were handed a buzzer and had to wait because we missed our window. Sure. Not the worst thing. Timer goes off, we go in and are seated in an unusually warm section of the restaurant (at one point they opened a door to the patio and another table openly clapped and cheered). We then proceeded to wait 10 minutes before a waiter came out and introduced himself and poured us water. Then another several minutes later he came back and asked if we were ready to order, never a drink order prior to the big order. We made our order and then maybe 10 minutes later our drink order came out. As the waiter handed out some of the drinks, the rest of the tray fell and drinks spilled everywhere. THEN, when our food came out those who ordered the same burgers but different styles (medium well and medium rare) got their burgers mixed up. One of our party members had had enough (surprise!) and went to the manager, who graciously took all of our drinks off the bill. All seemed well. Then, when the bill came, some group members put in cash, while others put credit cards in. We waited an unusual amount of time for the waiter to come and collect the bill too, and as he took it the instructions were give &#34;X on this credit card, Y on this credit card, the cash is the rest!&#34; To which he went and took the cash and split the bill between the two credit cards. Wonderful.

BUT I will say the food was pretty good, and the price range is certainly manageable. I hope this one experience was just a fluke.

For real though, being at the Weber Grill Restaurant with a friend who loves Weber grills and begged to go there and then just get such an awful experience was memorable in and of itself. We got to watch his dreams die in front of us."

We ordered a half chicken and a Malibu chicken sandwich, both with potato wedges.  The flavor of the chicken is really good &amp; not greasy at all, but the white meat was a bit dry.  My chicken sandwich w/ lettuce, tomato, mayo and cheese was tasty but I found a bone in it!  Bummer! The potato wedges were flavorful, closer to roasted potatoes than fries.  

Overall, good food and they offer larger family meals that are great deals.  I think they really need to update the interior.  Moisture was dripping from a vent above the cash register line.  A bit of a turn off..."

How does a chicken place run out of chicken? And why not mention this little tidbit before taking our order? Is 20 minutes how long it takes someone to run to a grocery store or Boston Market to bring back some chicken? We walked out and will likely never return.

A group of us came here before a movie one Saturday night.  The place wasn&#39;t too crowded and it&#39;s pretty large so I feel like the turnover is high even if you have to wait a few minutes.  

The menu is pretty large and they have everything from steaks to burgers to salads to chicken.  There&#39;s limited vegetarian options but they do exist.  The jalapeno cheese breadsticks were pretty amazing so I highly recommend ordering them.  I had the veggie burger that was pretty meh but everyone else seemed to enjoy their food.

The parking lot here is tiny and nuts so you will likely need to park further into the mall to actually get a space.  That was annoying on a super cold February night but what can you do.  The service was pretty decent, the homemade beers are OK, and the prices were pretty standard for a place like this."

Anything else was hard to enjoy when I saw my sons Mac and cheese arrive. It&#39;s easy to make something homemade for kids.  I wish the owners would realize that for parents who enjoy lunch and dinner out with kids will take notice of the ingredients given to kids. You are what you eat!! And kids food quality is important. I was pretty disgusted with that.

First off, if you&#39;ve never had the Chicken and Mac, you MUST get it. It is to die for! It&#39;s the ultimate comfort food, and I would pick it for my last meal on earth.

This place is casual but still nice enough to bring your coworkers or Clients. It&#39;s neat that they have their own microbrewery here, with the vats piped right to the tap at the bar. I love the wheat ale, but the red ale and kolsch are popular too.

Service is good, but not outstanding. What separates Rock bottom from other area restaurants is the quality of the food and the ambiance. There;s not a lot of American places that do pretty much every dish well: salads, burgers, tacos, appetizers. All great! 

Rock Bottom is one of the best places in the Lombard Yorktown area. Good for both lunch or dinner."

Rock Bottom Brewery!  Yep.  There is a woman named Kelly that runs the hostess stand that just makes you feel like she is your new best friend and does a great job of welcoming you to this location of this chain restaurant.

Having been to the city location countless times I was surprised to learn that there has been suburban outpost of this Brand for the last nine years!  Tells you where I spend my time, I guess.

Anyway- this location is much brighter than the city location but the menu and emphasis on beer is the same.  And new to me was that they sell this jug that you can fill and take home with you with one of their freshly brewed brews for about $16.  And bring back the container and you can get it refilled (or so my server told me!)

We each had a salad.  They were both very large and ended up going home with us to provide another meal.  Our server was friendly and even the manager came over to say hi and ensure that our experience was okay.  But know that the menu offers much more than salads as the burgers and entrees looked very good and the appetizers are what you would expect from a bar with nachos and chicken strips, etc.

The other thing that made me smile is that margaritas were only $5 on this day.  Loved the price and the drink wasn&#39;t bad either.  They have daily drink and food specials so check out their website before going.

Doubt I will make this a regular spot, but if I am looking for a place in the burbs for good food served by people who like what they do, it will be on my consideration list."

We stopped in for some lunch and a beer. We weren&#39;t thrilled with their beers, they really didn&#39;t taste that great. They do make a good bloody mary though. 

They have a large menu with a bunch of different things, but we decided on burgers. I really liked the mushroom and swiss burger. Their mac and cheese isn&#39;t all that bad either - a little dry but tastes good. The burgers were done perfectly. Everything was decently priced too.

Our server was very nice and attentive. We were not thrilled with the hostess at first...we asked if we could have a booth and she wasn&#39;t sure if she could seat us at one (it wasn&#39;t too terribly busy yet and we could see numerous booths open). She had to ask a manager...and eventually we got a booth. It was a little weird, but it worked out."

We got a reservation just a couple hours in advance and headed over at 8 PM and our spacious booth was waiting for us. 

The best things: our waiter! He was attentive, friendly and warm, and super knowledgable. He gave recommendations without reading the menu to us and he got us everything we asked for quickly. He also let me sample at least half of the beers on the menu which was awesome! I eventually decided on the wheat beer which was delicious. Thank you for your awesome service! I&#39;ve had such bad service at restaurants lately this was really refreshing and he did everything perfectly.

Also really good: We had burgers and the baja chicken sandwich and everything was super tasty. We also had the salmon bites and they were different and delicious with the fruity salsa! I wish I had taken photos but I was so hungry I dug in as soon as food arrived :)

Wouldn&#39;t get again: We had steak and fish tacos to start and didn&#39;t like them - messy, 1 was super spicy and the other wasn&#39;t spicy at all, and just not that tasty.

The service remained friendly and efficient. I ordered a veggie burger, added on cheese and it came with a chipotle mayo on the side. The burger itself was pretty good. The cheese was not worth adding- I couldn&#39;t taste it at all. The fries were crispy and warm, and I dipped them in the mayo and liked that a lot. It was a good meal, not overly exciting overall. I had the Kolsch beer this time, which was really light and again OK. I wouldn&#39;t mind coming back here, but I&#39;d like to try a few other of the restaurants nearby before coming back."

I ordered a cup of the beer cheese soup (yea like that combo could ever be bad!) and two items from the &#34;Street Fare&#34; appetizer menu.   If you aren&#39;t familiar with this menu it features small (usually two) portions of quick, mostly hand held foods that you would see out of food trucks and street vendors.  For someone looking for a quick bite on the run it is a perfect scenario.   I ordered the smoked chicken quesadillas and the barbakoa sliders.  I would give them both a solid B+.  Very good flavor and just the right size.

My co-workers swore by this place when we were located in Lombard. I just tried it for the first time on my birthday. Well, let me tell you, it was probably the most disappointing birthday dinner I&#39;ve ever had. 

I&#39;m going to start with our server. Now, I know I can&#39;t blame the Rock Bottom that much for this issue, but holy hell, our server had so much perfume on I gagged every time she came to our table. I&#39;m telling you, we purposly didn&#39;t ask for anything extra: no extra water, no napkins, no extra food, all because we could not stand to have her keep coming back to the table. I&#39;ve got to say, I was delighted she wasn&#39;t paying too much attention to us. Anyway, back on to the actual place.

I ordered a Cajun style chicken sandwhich. Bland. Super bland. Even their cajun mayo was bland. How does that happen? I don&#39;t know. Luckily, the beer cheese soup I got as a side wasn&#39;t too bad. It wasn&#39;t great either though. It was just meh. 

Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t try any of their beer while we were there because my mom isn&#39;t a drinker. Maybe that&#39;s what the hype is? All I can say is this place is a touch pricey for their flavor lacking food. 

Not sure why I signed up for their loyalty club, maybe so we can come back and try the beer, but other than that...probably won&#39;t be returning. If we&#39;re in the area and want to grab a drink, I might consider trying Rock Bottom again."

He was such a good baby he slept the whole time. The reason for two stars is the slowwwww service that we received. Made us wish we saved our $70 and just stayed in like we had done for the last 10  weeks! 

Our experience begun as we waited, and waited...........and waited for a server to come around to take our drink order and/or simply greet us and let us know they would be a few minutes. Never happened. My husband and I eventually looked at each other (we&#39;ve all done this before once a certain period of time has elapsed) and questioned whether there was a server assigned to our table for Friday night dinner. I think a manager came around to take our drink order, he asked if we had been greeted yet - no. 

The slowwwwwwness did not end with drinks. Our pretzel app took longer than appetizers usually take, and then by the time we were waiting around for dinner to come out, we realized that our entire dining experience at rock bottom was just going to be that -slow. 

We watched as other people around us got drinks, food, etc, before we did even though we were there before them. Luckily, the baby stayed asleep. Its so hard to go out with a newborn, because they can be a bit of a ticking time bomb as to when they are going to need to wake up and be fed. I thought that in the end our first round of drinks may have been comped by the manager that initially got our table going with a  server, but no. Disappointing overall for our first night out with our baby."

We weren&#39;t that hungry so we just got the chicken strips ($5) and the mini street tacos ($7). The tacos came in fish or steak and they are 4 mini tacos. I didn&#39;t think it was all that great and definitely not Mexican tacos but more Americanized. 

In celebration of Octoberfest, the bar was highlighting their famous brews. They do card you so remember to bring your ID.

Our server was nice enough, although there were some missteps (our appetizer came out literally 45 seconds before our burgers, our bill was incorrect). But he was nice, and apologized. So no big deal. However, the burgers we had, which I always rave about, were sub-par here for sure. When we were served, neither of our burgers were hot, and our fries were barely lukewarm. Normally, RB burgers are juicy, hot and fresh and piled high with fresh toppings. Not so here. My fried onion straws on my burger looked like they had been made hours before, and my burger didn&#39;t have blue cheese on it like it was supposed to. Also, mine was overcooked. Overall disappointing meal here, when I had really looked forward to it. Will stick to the Chicago location, where the burgers are significantly better.

Four of us went for a late lunch last Sunday. The place wasn&#39;t terribly busy and that suited us fine. We ordered apps and drinks, the ballpark pretzel is awesome! (Here is the description from the website: BALL PARK PRETZELS Two giant pretzels served with jalapeño spinach cheese dip. $8.50). We ended up taking one home and it reheated surprisingly well. 

Here is what we ordered:

MAKER&#39;S MARK® BURGER
Maker&#39;s Mark® bourbon glaze, gorgonzola cheese, and crispy onion straws (A+++ this was an excellent burger)

HICKORY BACON CHICKEN SANDWICH
Grilled chicken topped with bacon, cheddar and bbq sauce, served on a soft burger bun. (My husband would give this a C, he said it was only ok. The chicken was overcooked and the rest was just bland).

PULLED BBQ PORK SANDWICH
Can&#39;t-miss barbecue sandwich loaded with pulled pork, bbq sauce and apple coleslaw. (My friend said she enjoyed this, I forgot to ask her for her grade!)

CUBAN CRISTO
shaved pit ham, chopped pork shoulder, sliced dill pickles and swiss cheese surrounded by sourdough bread with a thin smear of honey mustard and mayonnaise. (I forgot to asked my friend to give this his grade, but I do know he mentioned enjoying it although he did wish it was served with a bit more to the jelly or dipping sauce).

I am super bummed because I didn&#39;t catch the name of our server and she was AWESOME. Super on top of things, always quick with a smile and refills. She was prompt and it seemed like she was just really chill and loving her job. It made for a nice added bonus to have a server who seemed to want to be there doing a job well done.

With gastro like pubs popping up all over we don&#39;t head to Rock Bottom very often, but I am glad that we always seem to get good food and great service every time we go. I love that it is consistent! (I prefer Ellyn&#39;s or Warren&#39;s ...Glen Ellyn and Wheaton). ;)

The IPA and Belgium style beer were spot on.  I highly recommend ordering the Lobster-shrimp tacos. The staff was even nice enough to suprise me with a delicious brownie and vanilla ice cream dessert.  Great customer service and food Rock Bottom Lombard staff!!

We had the Firecracker Shrimp for an appetizer and it had great flavor.  Our waitress was very good and let us sample a couple beers to before we ordered.  I had the Class Mac and Chicken and it was pretty good.  My wife had the Lobster and Shrimp tacos and loved them.  Would definitely recommend.

The beers were &#34;thin&#34; tasting is the best way I would describe it.  Sort of watery with a weak malt backbone.  But the part that was the most disappointing was the food.  I had a salad with a iceburg lettuce base made up of huge chunks you would need a knife to hack through.  The dressing was blah.  Appetizer was their chorizo pretzel bits that was served with a mustard dip  LOL... mustard?  It was unbelievable gross.  The corporate chef failed on this idea.   Not a place I will try again.

My recent visit included an outdoor seating option and while the service was adequate, the setting and the food were better than average.  My friend and I both opted for non-alcoholic beverages and salads.  Our wait was kind of long for a Wednesday night, but we enjoyed the time to converse.  Our server was efficient and did not push us to order drinks or dessert, and to me that is great - but at the same time she never asked if we wanted our drinks refiled or refreshed. 

 We both tipped over 20%,  but I sometimes struggle with tipping over 20%  if a server doesn&#39;t attempt to provide exemplary service. While I think she merited a 15% tip at best, the food and seating made me feel more generous."

To be fair, I just have to jump across the street, so it&#39;s pretty convenient. But nonetheless, it&#39;s a great go-to. I also have only chosen to sit in the bar.

While it is a chain restaurant, the beers on tap are always enjoyable, fresh and tasty. Don&#39;t be shy about asking for a sample if you&#39;re  unsure. The food is mediocre, nothing extraordinary but perfect to pair with a drink. The brewery sampler, which includes wings, southwest egg rolls, and jalepeno cheese dip is great for sharing.

One item I would highlight is the Bourbonzola Burger if you like BBQ type burgers. Great molasses based sauce, Gorgonzola cheese, and crispy onion strings. I highly recommend skipping the fries as a side and substituting for the apple cider cole slaw and just plop it on top of the burger. You will not be angry you did so.

Lastly, I can&#39;t say enough about the staff. The bartenders and waitress are really friendly and attentive. I&#39;m happy to say, I&#39;m just about regular status and they also appreciate your business.

Smile while ordering!"

I had never eaten here before.  When we walked in there were about 5 waiters standing there just looking at us.  Not one of them spoke or greeted us.  It was if we were some homeless folks who parked a shopping cart outside the door.  After a minute of them looking at us in this awkward silence I shook my hands like, &#34;well are you going to greet us or offer us a seat.&#34;  Finally, one of them spoke up.  The service was fine and the food was good.  Then, later...probably a few days later, my bank sent me an alert wondering why I left such a large tip.  What the place had done was flip flop the tip to the charge of the actual meal.  The overall bill was correct, but I didn&#39;t appreciate an inaccurate bill.  Will I ever go back ...no way.  I&#39;ve eaten at many restaurants from CA to VA and this place was a joke."

Food presentation and flavor has improved over the years. Their focus on beers and the inclusion of beer based food keeps pace and brings a unique element.

My only complaint is that overall prices seem high for chain food, but there&#39;s no loss of flavor and service."

Just across the street from my corporate office, I find myself in here for work dinners, meeting colleagues for a beer or with the fam.  As a creature of habit I haven&#39;t peeled away from the only dish I always order here, the Brewers Club.  Turkey, ham &amp; bacon on toast with cheddar and Swiss, tomato and lettuce with chipotle mayo...you&#39;ll be very hard pressed to find a tastier sandwich with this spread of ingredients. Oh yeah, for the side I always choose the steamed veggies.  These are highly recommended  They season huge slices of carrots, potatoes and asparagus and I&#39;ll tell ya, they&#39;re awfully damn good!  

Okay, onto their craft beers.  I&#39;m a stout &amp; porter guy by nature so I generally go with their Specialty Dark offering.  Know that the exact flavor and style of a craft at any RB will vary.   On average their brown rates around an 8 out of 10 with me.  They make very smooth crafts with great flavor.  Oh, and their beer is ALWAYS extremely fresh.

Deserts...ahh..deserts.  Here&#39;s the skinny from a guy that just sampled EVERY desert they offer in ONE sitting.  No joke.  I dined with ten colleagues so we ordered the desert gamut.  Tried a little bit of every one of them and would highly recommend each.  And by the way, the carrot cake serving is massive!  Unless yer a really big boy this one is not to be trifled with solo.  Guess that&#39;s why they call it carrot cake for two.  Hah.  My favorite of the group were the warm donut holes.  If you like the Dunkin Donuts version give these suckers a try.  Wow..mouth watering.  

I&#39;d be remiss if I didn&#39;t give a shout out for their service.  I booked a dinner party for 10, but an hour prior to our reservation I called to see if they could squeeze us in 30 minutes early.  Not a problem!  The place was jammed but they accommodated our request and dealt with a table full of lunatics for a couple hours.      

Cheers!"

We only had appetizers and drinks at a table in the bar area. The appetizers were pretty good and priced right. Most of us weren&#39;t in the mood for beer on this night. I will say that I avoided beer mostly because I&#39;m not a huge fan of what&#39;s brewed here. The mixed drinks were all fabulous though. 

The service was friendly and she handled every single request I had. She even had the bartender make me up a special grapefruit drink that I was talking about.

Basically any place that is a chain restaurant/brewery doesn&#39;t seem like a place that would give good attention to the beer to make sure it&#39;s high-quality. Nevertheless, I paid a visit to Rock Bottom this past weekend in celebration of my fiance&#39;s sister&#39;s 21st birthday with the family. I think my initial assumptions were right, for the most part.

Sat down, ordered some water and a beer. My fiance and his sister both got a flight of beer. You get 4 or 5 of their beers and you can choose the last one. It&#39;s the &#34;brewmaster&#39;s special&#34; or something. This can be a seasonal, cask conditioned, etc beer that is not typically offered. It&#39;s cool that you get to try something different as part of the flight, which is $6. 

 tried the beers from the flight. They were pretty standard and all tasted just like they should for what they were (white tasted like a white, IPA had the right amount of hops, etc). Nothing really stood out to the point where I would say, hey let&#39;s get a growler. I guess that&#39;s my measurement stick. If it&#39;s really good, I&#39;ll get a growler. His sister got the pumpkin ale which had a bit too much pumpkin spice. Pretty typical of pumpkin beers. Either too much spice or it tastes like pumpkin pie in a glass. The only pumpkin beer I&#39;ve had that was ever really good is from Lakefront Brewery.

The food was good, but again, nothing crazy. I had a pasta that was thick and nicely seasoned with olive oil and tomatoes and then a fat hunk of bread. The bread wasn&#39;t really necessary. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food as well. We had a brownie with ice cream for dessert and for some reason, they gave us forks. Huh? I&#39;ve never eaten ice cream with a fork and anytime I&#39;ve gotten this dessert elsewhere, it&#39;s always served with a spoon. I&#39;d also like to mention that not once did our waitress give us more water. I had the one glass from start to finish. Sure I had a glass of beer, but if you see that everyone&#39;s water is gone, maybe we need refills?

Rock Bottom is a good option if you&#39;re going with a group of people for a sit down atmosphere and want some beer, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back on my own. Just doesn&#39;t do it for me."

The brews here are the bomb.  First of all, you can get a one(ish) ounce pour of anything on tap (and even in cask if you ask nicely!) to sample their brews before you choose.  I ended up trying 5 different beers before I settled on one and it was the first time in a long time that I had a REALLY hard time choosing.

Their beers vary from light and crisp to malty and flavorful to inventive and hop bombed.  They also have barrel-aged brews AND cask-conditioned ones too.  Basically, there is something for everyone.  Their IPA was good but I REALLY liked the other four I tried:  Gibraltar Oatmeal Stout (cask!), 7 C&#39;s (hop bomb goodness!), and two beers that weren&#39;t on the menu so I don&#39;t know their real names...one was a Belgian (Abbey something) and the other was a delicious sweet hazelnutty brown ale.  ALL were good.  I ended up getting a pint of the 7 C&#39;s to go with my burger and it paired really well.

Speaking of the food...it was great too.  I got the Just Hot Enough burger (crispy fried jalapenos, pico de gallo, pepper jack cheese, and THE BEST habanero ketchup that will ever pass your lips) and it was awesome.  It was even cooked medium as promised (that NEVER happens so I was impressed).  The wings were good too...I mean, I&#39;m assuming that they were as my husband inhaled the whole plate while I ate one and debated on my beer choice.          

Obviously, we will be back.

*Quick Update: So, I visited Rock Bottom again and this visit was NOTHING like the first. HOPEFULLY the beer is still just as good...but as I&#39;m currently knocked up, I wasn&#39;t able to confirm...because the food has gone way downhill. The delicious burger I had last time was replaced by a spicy amateur version that was not nearly as good as the last. It was overcooked, the toppings were scarce, and even the bun was hard(ish). Overall, this visit was so sad it took them from a 5 to a 3. :("

The texas fire steak is amazing. All peppercorn steak with some nice spiciness to it, topped off with a jalepeno butter melting on it. Served on a sizzling skillet. This is my number one recommendation. 
My second recommendation is definitely the Classic Mac and Chicken...its an adult version of Mac n Cheese. A nice blend of cheeses melted all over pasta shells. Mixed in this cheesy pasta is some peppered chicken to give a nice blackend flavor to compliment the cheesy goodness....mmm...my mouth is watering now....
If your looking for a lighter option in a meal...go with the seared ahi tuna salad...seared blackend ahi tuna and mixed in the salad is chopped avacado, tomato, apple slices, garbanzo beans, and sunflower seed. Dressing is your choice but I recommend a lighter balsamic dressing to not overpower the crispy refreshing flavors of the salad and ahi tuna. If you are to drink a beer with this, (your at a brewery. You MUST have a craft beer!) Go with a refreshing wheat beer. It has a crisp light flavor to blend well with the salad.

Rock Bottom (Lombard location) used to be our hangout when we lived in the area.  Oh how the mighty have fallen.  We went there tonight for a friend&#39;s birthday dinner, and granted there were a TON of us in the party (had to have 2 servers), but that&#39;s not really an excuse.  The service was a clusterf-you know what.  It took forever to get drinks, and then both server sort of disappeared for what seemed like a super long time after the drinks were delivered.  They took food orders for half the table and then disappeared again.  I really do think they were doing the best they could, and our rowdy crowd probably wasn&#39;t helping the situation much.

Let me tell you, I used to have dreams about their chocolate stout sundae...holy amazingness, Batman.  So when I realized today was Rock Bottom Birthday Day, I geared up for the lusciousness that is their stout fudge sauce, cradling 2 scoops of the luckiest vanilla ice cream on the planet and crowned with a sprinkle of walnuts and a little whipped cream hat.  I know that the item isn&#39;t on the menu anymore, but I also know that the last time we came out, they were able to craft one (with love) just for me.  Well the joke was on me tonight.  

I asked if they still had the stout sundae, and the server said &#34;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about,&#34; meaning she was probably new.  So I explained to her what it was and asked if they could just make something close (I would have settled for a bowl of fudge and some whipped cream).  She said that they didn&#39;t have the stout fudge sauce anymore (uh...wut?) but they could do some vanilla ice cream with Hersheys syrup on it (again...uh...wut?).  Pregnant me decided ice cream was better than no ice cream, so I agreed.  She also said they could probably throw on some caramel &amp; a cherry (now we&#39;re talkin).  What I got was 2 scoops of ice cream with Hershey&#39;s syrup, whipped cream, and sprinkles...boo.  The best part of the sundae was that it was only $3.

Rock Bottom&#39;s menu has changed since the last time that we dined there.  Gone are the days of named standard beer (Erick&#39;s the Red, anyone??).  Gone is the chicken pot pie (my favorite thing on the menu).  And most regrettably, gone is the shot glass sundae.  So when you add up all of those subtractions, gone is this patron.  It&#39;s sort of sad to see a standout restaurant dumbed down so much.

Oh, and if you&#39;re thinking that some boozy fudge sauce sounds good, Lincoln Whiskey Kitchen is your huckleberry.  Theirs is fantastic, AND it&#39;s made with (you guessed it) whiskey."

The food quality here was well below average, enough to make me say that I do not plan to return to a Rock Bottom in general (especially the Lombard, IL location).  The menu did not look too appealing, so I ordered a burger assuming that it would be hard to mess up and I was wrong.  My bun was stale, the burger was not cooked to my request and it was room temperature (I could tell it had been sitting for a while before being served to me).  The only edible part of my meal was the french fries.  

The waitstaff was average.  I understand it was a busy Saturday evening but our waiter was no where to be found for a good portion of the night.  Usually you can spot your waiter running around to other tables or in the back, but in this case we didn&#39;t see him at all.  

In the end, I would avoid this place as there are many other choices right next door which cost the same and provide a much better quality of food."

The music choice for a restaurant is key is setting an atmosphere for the experience, and the music here was oddly disjunct with the decor/idea of the restaurant.  Certain selections on the playlist were not in line with the ambiance that they&#39;re attempting to create 

The beer selection here is relatively small compared to other brewery/restaurants, considering there is in-house brewing, and the servers seem to have only elementary knowledge of the selections. 

Our waitress was actually one of the positives for the visit.  She had personality and was engaging. However, we ordered our appetizer and entrees at the same time, and the appetizer never came.  We chalked this up to human error because the appetizer was never on the ticket. 

Adding to our experience was the food. We ordered very different entrees, and they turned out to be consistent in presentation, taste, and preparation time.  That being said, some aspects of both our entrees (the sides) could have used a little more attention in preparation. 

I think that we would come back to Rock Bottom for a second visit. It was consistent enough to warrant another visit.  The deduction in stars was due to poor service from the hostess, the missed appetizer, and sub-par preparation for appetizers."

I ordered the Turkey Burger and I think it may have been the best turkey burger I have ever had...I would highly recommend.  For me anything with avacado is a go to, and this burger had that an other very complimenting ingredients.  The atmosphere is very pub style.  There were TVs all around the bar playing different sports and two of the walls of the bar area were glass that showed off the brewery part of the restaurant...which was quite an impressive showcase of beer.

No.  The rice &amp; beans were also atrocious.  The entire dish tasted spoiled and sour.  And as I said in the beginning of this review--I was sick the entire next day from this food.

Usually rock bottom is bad. If you uttered the phrase &#34;let&#39;s hit rock bottom&#34; without context, it would be assumed that you were going to go bankrupt yourself and end your night sleeping on a park bench or something.

Thankfully, this Rock Bottom is good. Yes, it&#39;s a stereotypical suburban chain, spacious, landed in a mall parking lot near the highway. But this ain&#39;t TGI Friday&#39;s. The quality&#39;s a bit higher (and so are the prices).

The atmosphere is all warm wood and dim-ish lighting. They play themselves up as a brewery, and they DO have a number of unique-to-the-chain beers, which are explained in some detail on a table card. They&#39;re not brewed on premises, but it&#39;s still a step up from the norm. They also have fan-freaking-tastic rootbeer. (Lemme tell you &#39;bout it.)

The menu is a mix of Mexican/southwest inspired dishes, burgers, individual pizzas and a few higher-end steak/fish type things. I do like that they try some creativity, although I&#39;m not sure it always works. 

We started with nachos, as we are wont to do, and these are some enormous (and tasty) nachos. Easily could serve 4-6 as an appetizer, but the husband was hungry and we managed to polish most of it off. Lots of beans, cheese, pico, etc. We upgraded to ground beef although I found it a bit dry and not really worth the $2. The salsa was quite good, and I dove into that.

I had chicken flautas as my entree and only managed one plus a few bites of rice and beans. Hey, leftovers are fine by me. The chicken flautas were very tasty, packed with delicious ingredients.

I would love to see these places upgrade their rice and beans a bit -- they were fine, but boring. Adding a little turmeric and achiote to turn the rice a golden red looks pretty, but it doesn&#39;t add much flavor. Come on, I can make more flavorful rice than this at home. Also, the guacamole scoop that came on top was browning and less than appetizing. Needs to be covered better -- either that or it sat under the heat lamp a little too long.

Service was good, friendly, not amazing but solid. 

All in all a pretty good place but with a few tweaks (and maybe a coupon or two) it might be upgraded to very good. :)"

They&#39;ve been up and down with both the food and beer menus.  More of late, they&#39;ve been down.  The food menu has become just slightly better than the typical bar food.  They used to put a high focus on the food menu, but its quality has definitely been sliding.
They have added beer outside their house brews, and maybe that&#39;s a good thing, as their house brews aren&#39;t anything special anymore either.

DRINKS: Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Stout &amp; Margarita - Really solid, especially the Stout. One of those, and let&#39;s just say I was a happy camper (12% ABV).

APP: Ball Park Pretzels - Two HUGE soft pretzels, well salted, piping hot, and served with a jalapeno cheddar cheese sauce. Plenty for four people.

ENTREES: Lobster and Shrimp Enchiladas &amp; Cobb Salad - The enchiladas were a stretch, but they were pulled off fairly well. A bit bland as far as the filling goes, but the tortillas were soft, enchilada sauce added much needed taste to the dish, and the rice &amp; beans paired well. The Cobb Salad was huge, leaving plenty of egg, bacon, avocado, and chicken for my wife to take to work for later. 

Not necessarily the first place I would stop if I&#39;m on the go and need a quick fix, but definitely worth checking out if you&#39;re in the mood to watch a game and enjoy some quality brew. Plenty of TV&#39;s, plenty of food, and plenty of damn good beer."

Then the meals arrived, 4 burgers for the adults, 3 of which were overdone.  The all came med well to well, ordered med rare, which was disappointing.  My 2am burger was cooked to the right temp (rare), but the egg on top was well overdone.  In the past, what had been a golden yolk running into the burger to make it cohesive, was now the consistency of hard boiled.

I perused the menu online beforehand to make sure there was something I could eat (I&#39;m a vegetarian who happens to be allergic to shellfish, which is not an issue unless something I eat has been tainted by shellfish and that&#39;s happened twice to me) and there wasn&#39;t a whole lot, but there was something.  

I know you can ask for something to be specially prepared at most places but I feel like such a tool doing that.  

We&#39;re 50% poorer than we&#39;ve ever been before due to the husband being unceremoniously given the ole heave ho from his job so I did NOT partake in any alcoholic beverages but said husband did spring for a root beer (I wish I ordered it too, it was gooooood) as opposed to his usual water.  I had a diet coke (which we were not charged for, btw).  

The husband had lobster and shrimp tacos or something (so he&#39;d better not come near me tonight because it could be the kiss of death, literally) and I had, wait for it, a garden salad with tangy vinaigrette dressing (muy bien!), the ball park pretzel appetizer and a side order of mac and cheese.  I have to get creative (and quite unhealthy) at restaurants sometimes.  

Husband man said his was good but he doubted he would return without a coupon.  Mine was DELICIOUS but too carb heavy to enjoy on a regular basis.  The jalapeno spinach cheese dip that came with the pretzels was REAAAAAAAALLY good but I tried to eat as little as possible.    

My salad was pretty exciting and a hell of a bargain for the like $3.50 cost.  It was decently sized and had the usual lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, carrot but also sunflower seeds, raisins and half a hard boiled egg. 

I noticed something kind of strange as I was eating my pretzels though.  I wish I would&#39;ve gotten a small plate or something to use as the middleman betwixt the pretzel holder device and my mouth.  It felt kind of weird picking pieces off of the whole big thing and having to immediately dip and eat.  Weird of me, but a thought I had.  

Oh, and I randomly ran into this dude that I went to college with downtown and COULD NOT STAND.  I&#39;ve gone to one alumni function ever back in like 2008 and NATURALLY he was there, cocky as ever, and then I see him in Lombard?!?!  He&#39;s got this blog and website that I occasionally read for a good laugh (mocking) and then I run into him.  So I spent a good portion of the dining experience crouched down in the booth praying to ye gods that he wouldn&#39;t see me while nervously scanning the table trying to figure out where he was sitting.   

Sometime I would like to go back and try a few of their brews."

Friendly hostess/owners (?). We were seated immediately and pretty promptly greeted by the waiter 

So here is the good part. We ordered rolls which were good but maybe a bit small; chicken and calamari combo which was ok; and the garlic chicken which had a huge amount of Panko breading hiding the way too tiny shrimp. Avoid this!.

Drinks were slow to come as was the food. Beer is cheap though.

Giving them a pass because they are new. I&#39;ll try again later.

No comparison to the joint right down the street."

Service was wonderful, we were greeted immediately  buy a hostess  and the waitress was very attentive with good English. The restaurant is immaculate and very chic. Drink specials $5 for a wonderful selection of wine and Cocktails. And then came our Hibachi Grill chef... What a delight! He was funny and talented and performed daring tricks with fire I&#39;ve never seen before at a Japanese Steakhouse. The Highlight was the filet mignon which we had with shrimp. The selection of sauces added to an already great grilled flavor from the chef. Great price , great atmosphere, great service, this place is worth finding."

The service did a fantastic job at accomodting to the specific dietary needs of my party (a vegan and a guy that just really, really liked extra pickled ginger). The portions were absolutely massive and the quality of the food was awesome. It was very flavorful and I definitely didn&#39;t feel like my meal was lacking in anything. I did think the vegetable tempura was a little plain, but the custom vegan dish was pretty amazing. My family loved their combination meat dishes and the sushi looked and tasted freakin&#39; awesome. The server was super sweet, attentive, and beyond accomodating.

 I was honestly very impressed and the restaurant exceeded all my expectations. My family is already thinking about what we will re-order and try out on our next visit."

To get to their menu online menu you have to go to their Facebook page and scrolling through photos, or go to GrubHub. The rolls were okay, the Kobe and Fire Dragon rolls had a good combination of flavors. The problem was that most of the rolls just fell apart when you picked them up. They were not rolled tightly enough and didn&#39;t have enough rice. I might wait a little bit to go back to see if they work out some of those kinks."

While Frank&#39;s has quite the hot dog assortment I&#39;ve never ventured to trying any as it is not my thing so I tend to always go for their chubby burger. Being someone that eats cheeseburgers at every sort of joint like this I&#39;m very particular about what makes a cheeseburger satisfying. Frank&#39;s I can definitely say is the most satisfying, they get everything just perfect. If you&#39;re someone that prefers a more meaty cheeseburger I wouldn&#39;t say this is for you, but for those who like a burger proportioned proper; meat, cheese, garnishing, then this is it! I recommend ordering with extra cheese if you&#39;re a cheese lover. Also, another tip don&#39;t order a double chubby it is much too messy and doesn&#39;t keep its shape well so you&#39;ll be getting parts that are all cheese or all meat. My fix to that is just ordering two single chubbies! 
Shakes are good as well. 
Recently I&#39;ve broken away from gorging on chubby burgers to enjoy their lobster Mac and cheese fries. A new and fantastic menu addition. Since having them I&#39;ve fantasized about their greasy, cheesy, seafood goodness a few times a week."

There are multiple reasons for the 2-star review.  This is what we ordered and where the deficiencies were:

Nawlin&#39;s Nemesis - It was just okay.  First off the French bread was cut stupidly so it split at the bottom.  The Andouille sausage was overcooked.  While I understand that a cased sausage has some toughness to it, the insides were chewy for almost the whole thing.  Oh and the cook forgot the fried okra.  

Funnel Dog - Also just okay.  The funnel cake batter was super thin, almost non-existent and hardly any maple syrup in it.  The bacon bits were probably the only good part on it.  

Deep South Dog - This one was kinda blah.  The bacon on the dog was undercooked... It was still rubbery.  The mac n cheese on top was bland... Almost at the par of a boxed Mac n cheese.  Quite disappointing 

Bacon Wrapped Dog - So this one was a free dog.. Because the incompetent staff thought I ordered it.  Same issue like the Deep South dog... Bacon was rubbery.  I took the bacon off and just ate the plain hot dog... Nothing special.  

The fries were the highlight of the meal for me.  I&#39;m always a fan of fresh cut fries.  Kinda sad that this was the highlight of the meal. 

The staff?  They seemed lost.  Cashier was not ringing items up right (other patrons had major mistakes on orders), thankfully mine was the only order not missing but rather had something extra.  

Overall this was such a huge disappointment for us and I will not be returning. 

If you want a legit dog, hit up Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s."

I actually have never written a negative one yet. I give benefit of the doubt and second chances before I even complain. I need to say first the food here is great. That needs to be noted upfront. 

So, Franks night Out is about 4 buildings from my office. My boss and I tried it for lunch the first time about a a month and a half ago. We had great food, fast service and a great experience. However since then, we have gone 3 more times. The original lady that was there the first time was no longer there on our next 3 visits. A new lady(at least new to us) was there and has been there since. This lady takes the orders and delivers food to the tables. Needless to say the service was HORRIBLE!!! The first 2 times we waited in line with at least 5 other people and she was more worried about handing out food then addressing the customers in line. She would literally would ignore the people needing to order for 5-8 minutes at a time. Now this is LUNCH RUSH, and she is the Only one working outside of the kitchen. She is also very slow and seemed to not figure out the cash register. She would then break from table serving to take one order then touch the cash/credit cards and go right to serving again without even washing her hands. Money and cards are FILTHY!!!!! Huge sanitation issue here. My last experience which was on Tuesday or Wednesday of last week was what angered me the most. I brought our office manager who works at another location for the first time and she was so unhappy. She ordered before me. there were 2 people in front of her and after 14 minutes which she timed, she was able to finally order!!!  AGAIN THE  SAME LADY SPENDING MORE TIME HANDING OUT FOOD THEN TAKING ORDERS!!!!! Then after 6 more minutes I started to order. As I was ordering she was pushing buttons on the register and without even saying a work as I was speaking my order she left and delivered 6 meals and came back to say &#34;Can I take your order now.&#34; I read it again. HOW IGNORANT IS THIS!!!!! THIS was the WORST FOOD Experience I have EVER had. So my office manager was about to go ask for a refund after 22 minutes had past since she ordered a hot dog and fry. However it was just coming out after the 23rd minute and she told the lady thanks and why did it take so long for a hot dog. So a hot dog lunch took over 45 minutes from time to order to delivery. She asked me why would I bring her to such a horrible place. She said the good food is not worth longer than it would take at a fine dining sit down restaurant. 

The management needs to do something. like I said in my first statement, I don&#39;t judge on my first experience I give benefit of the doubt and give second chances. This is 3 horrible experiences in a row after only one good one(the first visit). Kinda like gambling, beginners luck. 

Sadly I now will drive 10-12 minutes to get lunch instead of a 1 minute walk just to be able to have lunch done in 20 minutes instead of almost an hour. I will NEVER go here again!!! How does management not see this going on. Absolutely ridiculous. It is a waste of what could be a great place."

&#34;Yep.&#34; - Frank&#39;s

Effing. Sweet.

This review is long overdue, but now that I live in Chicago, I feel the need to pay respects to Frank&#39;s for introducing me to the Chicago Dog and keeping my tummy satisfied when I was experiencing my first Midwest storm and potential cyclone.

Over a year ago, I had the opportunity to visit Plainfield and get trapped in a small hurricane. However, my friends assured me that I still needed to try a hot dog before I flew back to LA that evening. So what did we do? They Facebook messaged the place and they said they were still open during the storm. Hell yes.

We got our survival gear (consisting of pants and a flask of course) and made our way over. It must have been the eye of the storm that we were passing, because it wasn&#39;t until we entered the restaurant that it started POURING again. Good thing there is FREE POPCORN to get us settled in for the feast.

Chicago Dog - SO GOOD! I get that y&#39;all don&#39;t like ketchup on these weiners, and I can tell why. It was classic, big, and delicious.

Duck Poutine Fries - These were badass! Golden cut fries with a layer of cheese and duck fat.

If you are in the area, you can&#39;t miss out on having a hot dog at Frank&#39;s. It simply cannot be beat. They can persist through the storm, and so can you."

They are not skimpy on the toppings!  Would have given this a four star, but the buns of the other dogs were rather plain. But - don&#39;t let that stop you from a night out at Franks. Give it try.

Upon entering I waited about 5 minutes at the counter before someone even came from the back to greet me. I felt bad bc he seemed to be the only worker so I understood no problem, but in my opinion someone should always be readily available at the forefront. Another thing I questioned was whether they had air conditioning because it felt like a sauna in there, the guy working said the kitchen gets really hot. Besides those minor things I ordered the Deep South Dog, (bacon wrapped, Mac-n-cheese, cheddar and tomatoes) and honestly I was not impressed, I&#39;ve had better hot dogs. I can&#39;t speak for all the other dogs on the menu but this one lacked any flavor, the bacon that wrapped the dog even lacked taste (how is that possible) so overall I think the place has a great concept but overall in my opinion they definitely have to step it up. I gave it two stars based on the effort."

The Chicago style dog I ordered blew up in my mouth. The bun disintegrated after 2 bites. Dunno if it was old, not steamed, steamed too much... Anyway needed a fork. Also ordered a chalkboard special they were having, which ended up being a jalapeño beef frank with coleslaw and maybe pulled pork. All of the ingredients were hidden from my mouth as they were between what I can only describe as a huge Kaiser-like sandwich bun. I like a bun. Not a sandwich roll with a hot dog somewhere in between. 
Quick service, good specialty fries. 3 dogs and specialty fries plus 2 drinks ran me $25 which is too rich for me for some ho-hum hot dogs."

I know that specialize in fun Hot Dogs but when I was in line I had looked at a person who just ordered a Gyro  platter and I was like I want that! The order taker was a very nice girl who I would only wish was someday my future daughter in law as she was very attractive and personalble. All Joking aside she was very nice and the food olny took a few minutes. I chose to dine in but I would olny say that being a chilly nite and the fact the dining area was cold due to patrons coming and going. I am sure if that was my only gripe I would have scored a 5 star. 
Loved the old 40&#39;s 50&#39;s music playing and brought back memories of days past. overall  my visit was very pleasant experience.

I&#39;ve dealt with her the last two times, and she&#39;s been nothing but pleasant. 

I gotta say my favorite hot dog (so far) is the tijuana dog, although the gyros dog was an interesting concept. I&#39;m looking forward to trying the rest of the hot dogs out."

They have a fry menu that serves two people generously with flavors like greek fries and loaded baked potato.

The Notorious P.I.G. is a bacon wrapped hot dog topped with pulled pork, BBQ sauce, mac n cheese, and sliced jalapeño. Everything was AMAZING! The place is decked out with a hot dog theme everywhere you look, including black and white photos of old school hot dog stands on the walls and a giant cartoon of the Notorious P.I.G. in the style of Biggie himself up by the menu.

My first time here, I spent quite a while standing in front of the counter reading the menu.  Everything sounded good - hot dogs with jalepeno-pineapple relish, cheese curds, bacon wrapped, peanut butter, Sriracha mayo, avocado, goat cheese crumbles, baked bean, etc.  Hot dog/sausage price ranges from $2.25 - $5.25.  I was in the mood for mac &amp; cheese, so I went with:

DEEP SOUTH DOG - $3.75 - Bacon Wrapped Dog, Mac-n-Cheese, Cheddar, &amp; Tomatoes - It was good, but maybe too basic. I would want to be more adventurous next time on my order.
TRUFFLE PARMESAN FIRES - The flavors tasted very artificial and dull.  I would try their cajun fries next time instead.

I took advantage of the complimentary bacon &amp; sea salt popcorn while I waited for my food.  It was delicious!

Besides hot dogs, they offer burgers, sandwiches, pizza puff, etc.  They forgot about my friend&#39;s order and offered him a large milkshake for the error.  Great customer service and great milk shake!"

I knew for sure last Saturday that I wasn&#39;t going to let the day go by without a hot dog entering my belly. After stringent calorie counting, and 2 lbs lost over the past week, it was time for a little reward and I knew where it was coming from--Frank&#39;s Night Out!

We drove the frigid 45 minutes or so out to Plainfield and were overcome and overwhelmed with the gadozen choices on the menu. Holy cow there&#39;s a lot of hot dogs. How do you choose which one? All the flavor combinations seemed irresistible, but I went with the Philly Cheesesteak Dog. And frankly (get it, &#34;frank-ly?&#34;) you didn&#39;t need the dog. The steak was flavored well and the peppers were tender and just right. Everything was topped with a layer of melty cheese that cascaded over the side of my sandwich. The steak was a little tough, but manageable. 

My wife ordered the Notorious P.I.G., which I think is fun to say and probably more fun to eat. But I didn&#39;t get a bite this time. She said it was delicious and very piggy.

The other thing we ordered was a side of Duck Poutine Tater Tots. This sounded awful to me, but Laura wanted it so I agreed. I&#39;ve had poutine before and don&#39;t like it. It&#39;s usually very very salty and soggy. I wasn&#39;t feeling it. But this was good. Really good. The gravy wasn&#39;t overwhelming, and the salt factor was nonexistent. Maybe the creator knew that the potatoes were salty enough as it was. But the star of this attraction was the duck itself. Tender shredded pieces of duck topped the whole dish. It was flavorful and tasty, and enough to have a bite of duck with just about every tot. I enjoyed it a great deal, especially after expecting the worst. The bits of cheese curd added nothing for me. They were small and kind of tough. Honestly they were unnecessary. 

They apparently give free flavored popcorn away daily too, but by the time we got there most of it was gone. Saturday&#39;s flavor of the day was Sea Salt &amp; Bacon Fat. Not sure if it was because the corn had been sitting out all day and was stale, or if this flavor just doesn&#39;t work on popcorn but it was kind of disgusting. 

So as a whole, I was very pleased with my meal. Some of the dishes could be tightened up a little bit, I feel by using better ingredients, for examples the dry curds and tough steak. But for the prices I&#39;d definitely come back because they&#39;re doing things with hot dogs that not many others are."

On the menu is a pluthera of crazy hotdog, sandwich and fries creations that all sound delectable! I finally settled on the Mangy Mutt while my husband and son noshed on the Cheesehead Dog and Bacon Blue Cheese Dog. We washed them down with garlic parmesan fries and loaded fries. Boy was that good! My one critique, which kept me from giving this joint a 5 star review, was the buns. My sons pretzel roll was great but the other dogs were served on plain ole steamed buns. These gourmet dogs need a fancier edible vessel like a brioch bun or bakery roll or even a Texas toast bun. This would totally up their game!"

Then shortly after we received our food he put the volume on the TV as high as it would go because to him listening to the game was more important than any of the seated parties being able to hear each other or him being able to hear the orders of any other customers.

I stumbled across Franks when yelping for &#34;best Mac and cheese.&#34;  Franks takes my beloved to a whole new level. Loading it on top of several of their dogs. I gave the &#34;homewrecker&#34; a chance which is a foot long Frank on a hoagie with chili, onion and mustard. This dog was a masterpiece to behold. And enormous enough that if I had finished it I wouldn&#39;t have eaten again for days. I opted to finish half and nom down on our hot and angry fries which were so angry I think they could only see red. Whoooo! But were they good!!

I have also tried the Korean dog which was exactly what I dreamt it would be a vinegary concoction with some bar b q pork. 

The Cajun Blt is exactly as it sounds a bacon wrapped frank with lettuce and tomato topped with a Cajun aioli. I can&#39;t get enough of the Cajun aioli! The rajun Cajun fries represent we&#39;ll and it&#39;s my belief that you cannot go wrong I ordering them!

Should you grab a specialty fry I suggest making it your main dish or convincing your mate to split it with you as the portions are large and in charge!  

The Greek fry was a divine invention which is basically a gyro sans pita add delicious crispity crunchity Golden fries. 

Now in case you don&#39;t have plenty to write home about at this point I highly suggest grabbing a shake! They are off the chain ridiculous. Everyone at my table ordered one and they all tasted exactly how I imagined. I got pb&amp;j! What? So good. 

And last but not least they have that soda machine where you can make any flavored soda you ever dreamt.

If I can compare it to anything, it&#39;s like county fair food brought to Rt 59. Awesome dogs, gluttonous options and many deep fried desserts. 

Atomic Dog was great. Perfect slaw/hot sauce/Bleu cheese/dog ratio

Pastrami dog was wonderful, but the pastrami was a bit tough. I know that&#39;s sometimes hard to control

Wife&#39;s Bleu cheese/shroom dog was outstanding. 

The fact that the dogs are Vienna really tie it all together. A lesser pork dog would ruin the flavor combos. 

If my body didn&#39;t hate lactose, I would have saddled up to a shake as well. Best shake menu I&#39;ve ever seen"

I ordered the Deep South dog and fries with a fountain drink. 

So this thing had components of everything I love. A bacon wrapped hot dog, covered in mac and cheese and tomatoes. Now there&#39;s a few reasons I can&#39;t give more stars. The mac and cheese was pretty bland, tomatoes are bland in general and unfortunately the bacon really didn&#39;t even come through for me. I was kind of disappointed. I really think if they did something to spice up the mac and cheese and maybe use a hickory smoked bacon that could give that hotdog a good kick in the flavor department! 

I just had the plain fries, and they were just plain ole&#39; good fries. I wish I would have mixed it up with one of the others. Oh well, next time. 

They also have that coke remix machine where you can flavor your soda. 

I would like to come back for a Chicago dog and compare it to a Portillo&#39;s Chicago dog. That would be a good test!

Service was good, it was a dead Monday late afternoon so we were the only ones in there and the blonde woman at the front was friendly.  Everything has to be made to order because it took a little bit longer than most places but I appreciate the freshness. 

I think once they are more established and have the right feedback they&#39;ll be able to kick it up a notch."

This may seem like &#34;just another hot dog joint&#34; but the unique toppings and food choices make it stand out from the Five Guys and Chipotle&#39;s popping up in every strip mall. 
I found this place through Yelp, after looking for something other than the same old stuff. WARNING! Do not look at the menu on an empty stomach. After reading it my mouth was salivating at all the wonderful and unique offers on the menu. 
I brought my sons, 3 and 5 with me for lunch a Saturday afternoon. I chose the Cheesehead Dog and they had a hot dog and chicken tender kids meal. We also got a regular ol&#39; order of cheese fries to split.
First my dog- I&#39;m going to go against the popular vote here and say I&#39;m not a fan of the Vienna Beef hot dog. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s substantial enough to hold up against the toppings on these dogs. Also I like a dog that bites clear through. Not sure if it&#39;s all Vienna hot dogs or just they way these are cooked but for such a small/thin dog, the casing was too thick and hard to bite through. Was it bad? No. just not the dog I would have liked. A thicker ball park type Frank would have been better in my opinion. I also didn&#39;t care for the cheese curds. I was under the impression that they were the dough covered fried ones, but there are simply just raw pieces of cheese curd. Overall, despite these things I still enjoyed the dog. The homemade cheese sauce is extraordinary! 
Speaking of cheese- the fries are awesome! Hand cut and the portion is very generous. I probably could have just had the boys fries  and ordered a
Side of cheese because we had a ton left over.  Though to be fair my kids don&#39;t eat much.
Afterward we took some milkshakes to go. The boys split a Cookie Dough one and I had the Chocolate covered strawberry. They were both delicious and huge!!
The employees were both very friendly and helpful. The place is clean and they have movies playing for the kiddos, games and popcorn while you wait. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu!"

Franks you are awesome!  Keep doing what you do!

The SO and I stopped in with a friend since I had been wanting some exotic dogs/meats.  The restaurant is a little hard to spot (keep heading south at the Binny&#39;s) but has easily accessible parking and is nice inside.  The menu is big, but not too big and well laid out.  There is tasty &amp; free bacon popcorn (not sure if its bacon grease to replace the oil, bacon salt, or what) to enjoy while you wait.

I ordered one of the day&#39;s specials - the bacon bomb burger - and an order of truffle fries.  This burger is a monster... of deliciousness.  It played out like 2 burger patties with bacon and jalapeno sandwiched in between, formed together into 1 patty, battered, and deep fried.  The fix&#39;ins were simple (lettuce, tomato, onion, and possibly a special sauce?) but the flavor and fill was GIGANTIC.  As a big eater this thing could have filled me up and I wasn&#39;t over-it 2/3 of the way through like some foods in this category of healthiness.  I definitely wanted every last bite!  They did erase it from the menu after my order, so I&#39;m not sure if its a pain to make or maybe there is some pre-fab that has to be done.

The truffle fries on the other hand - good fries, good cheese, but compared to some other&#39;s I&#39;ve had / made recently something was missing (and unfortunately I think it was most of the truffle-y-ness).  I&#39;m not sure if they are just fried in truffle oil or how they are prepared, but the truffle flavor doesn&#39;t exactly burst through.  I didn&#39;t see any typical bits of black truffle fungus floating around, but at home we make it with truffle cheese.  Good fries for sure, but not a must-have at this time.

I was also able to try the SO&#39;s dog which had mac &#39;n cheese and tomato.  A bit on the simpler side, but it was still tasty and well prepared.  I tried my friend&#39;s duck poutine fries and they were great.

About our friend&#39;s order though - it got lost in the mix somehow.  When they realized the mistake they offered him some free fare, so knowing that he was already stuffed to the brim and we wanted to try a shake he got us a peanut butter, banana, and bacon shake.  The food and the shake were out in quick order.  The flavor in the shake was good, but the pieces of bacon were a bit too hard to &#34;chew&#34;.  I&#39;d soften them up a little bit - I&#39;m not sure if this was too-cooked or too-frozen.

Overall despite a couple of very small misses Frank&#39;s Night Out was both delicious and filling and satisfied my exotic dog cravings.

I can&#39;t wait to come back!"

Three dogs and a large fry ran me at $14. Their prices are fair for how high of quality and made to order their food is. 

I had the Chicago style dog just to see where they stand. They are on par with Portillos for the Chicago dog. Well done and I would take out of town folk here to try a real Chicago dog. I also tried a bacon wrapped dog with peanut butter and jalapeños. Weird, good but I will explore the menu further next time.

I will be back for their two Chicago dog, fry and drink for $6 special. They also have weekday specials but nothing on the weekends. 

The have a $30 The Mastiff challenge that no one has beat to date. I believe it is a lb of hot dog, lb of fries and quite the fixings. 

I applaud this place for offering such a large variety of dogs, burgers and even shakes. I will be back for the $5 shakes as they looked awesome off the order of someone else. If you are local turn out and support this place. Well worth the visit."

It&#39;s an unassuming little place smack dab in the middle of a large strip shopping area.  Easy to find - just look for the 7 foot tall hot dog greeting you at the door. 

The menu was a bit overwhelming and I was really hungry so I just settled on a Chili Mac&#39;n Cheese Dog with an order of fries.  My husband ordered a straight Chili dog.  Our order come out promptly with hot, &#39;skin on&#39; fries that actually tasted like potatoes.  The dogs were really good - a nice snap when you bit into it with a nicely steamed poppy sead bun.  I am usually not a big fan of the &#34;cheese whiz&#34; type cheese on hot dogs or nachos but this cheese was fresh and there was a nice balance between it and the chili and mac.

Went here earlier this week and met a friend who lives nearby and highly recommended it.

I had the burger special, which was a burger on Texas Toast (ok so far) with pulled pork on top (getting better) and a few fresh cut jalapenos (OK, I&#39;m listening) mixed in with their mac &#39;n cheese (there you go!).   Tots on the side were decent, but let me get back to the best part-the mac &#39;n cheese.   I can imagine going back and my boys ordering a vat of that-I&#39;m sure it&#39;s made without skimping on the hearty ingredients!

The menu is something-not easy to read-but it&#39;s evident a lot of thought and trial and error over the years went into creating the many options of hot dogs, sandwiches, etc.  The chili I saw on other&#39;s dogs and fries looks like it&#39;s going to be a staple on anything I order in the future.

Can&#39;t wait to go back and try a dog or sausage (the lamb one sounds tasty per the menu write up) and the fries.  Those dessert choices look scary, as in can&#39;t go back to work, I&#39;ll have to take a nap now to recover, so maybe the next time I play hooky, I&#39;ll head there."

Tzatziki was awesome, pita was melt-in-your-mouth fresh and the meat was flavorful, tender and not greasy at all. 

This is a must-try spot! We love Frank&#39;s!"

Let&#39;s be real:  Plainfield doesn&#39;t have much even downtown and outside of downtown is a lot of chain eateries. 

I had the cheddarhead hot dog and the cajun fries.  The hot dog came covered in cheese sauce and cheese curds. The hot dog was good but not what I expected.  The cheese sauce was good, but I expected typical fried cheese curds.  These curds were hunks of warm cheese pre-fry.  Next time I would probably just get the cheese covered dog.

The cajun fries were very good.  I liked the spicy aioli, and the fries were well seasoned.  The portion (just over $2) was big enough to share.

I really wanted to try the salted caramel shake mentioned in a previous review.  I thought they did seasonal shakes, but it appears they do a &#34;shake of the day.&#34; That day&#39;s shake was Oreo, so I just got a lemonade instead.

My husband had the &#34;Notorious PIG&#34; and the chili dog.  Both looked good (the PIG is covered in bacon, jalapenos, pork and cheese).  He said both were good although he didn&#39;t seem impressed.  On his last visit, he had the &#34;Deep South,&#34; his favorite so far.

Service is...awkward.  The cashier did not say a word to us and we never heard her say hello to any customers.  She literally just stood there and stared at us.  When she dropped off our food, she just showed us the tray and asked, &#34;is this yours?&#34;  How should I know?  I&#39;ve never eaten here and they&#39;re all covered in cheese.

I don&#39;t think it was intentional; something tells me she is family or it&#39;s her first job - or both.  I don&#39;t need you to kiss my feet, but some kind of signal (lights? smoke signals? any language, really) that you are ready for me to order or you can SEE me standing there would help."

Just a few days ago, I had the Notorious P.I.G, the Chili Cheese dog and a large order of tater tots.  The tots were perfectly cooked.  Nicely crunchy and the large order is large (as in share with a friend large).  The chili cheese dog could have used some diced onions on it, but the chili was good.  There was a good proportion of melted cheese to chili.  Now, the Notorious P.I.G... bacon-wrapped hotdog with mac and cheese on top.  I loved this hot dog.  It had me at bacon-wrapped.  :-)  Plus, they have a soda machine that dispenses every flavored soda known to man kind.  It&#39;s amazing, but there can be a line if someone gets overwhelmed by choices.

The place is clean and nicely decorated.  There were only a few other people there when I visited so it wasn&#39;t very noisy.  They had a table outside, but unfortunately it&#39;s getting to be too cold for outside dining.  

I can see this place becoming a regular hang out.  Hopefully there will be menus the next time I&#39;m there.  It&#39;ll help in trying all their hot dogs and desserts.  (No room for desserts on this visit sadly.)"

They have a huge menu with lots of choices of different kinds of hot dogs, different kinds of fries, burgers, sandwiches, etc.  They also have specialty shakes, desserts - you name it.  

It was REALLY hard to decide what to have.  There were at least 5 things I wanted, but I didn&#39;t want to order way too much food.  I went with a simpler hot dog, the Chinatown so that I could also try fries and a specialty shake.  The hot dog was just okay - it was covered in sweet sauce and a pineapple salsa.  It was really too sweet for my liking, but i could see where they were trying to go.  There were tons of other options that I should have tried that all included the hot dog being wrapped in bacon and the next time I come here that is what I will have.  The fries were just okay - I also should have upgraded to one of the specialty fries, but just couldn&#39;t decide.  The best part about my meal was my banana, peanut butter and bacon milkshake...YEAH.  Anytime you can drink pork...I&#39;m a fan.  This was darn good.

I know that my meal wasn&#39;t all that great, but I was overwhelmed and I don&#39;t think I made the right choices.  It was pretty crowded when I went, but it was a school holiday so that could have contributed to why. Food was a touch on the expensive side for a hot dog stand, but that is probably because everything is special - this isn&#39;t just your standard dog and fries.  I will have to come back after I have studied the menu for awhile so that I can order the right thing next time."

Reminds me of a solid mash-up of Hot Dougs and Criff Dogs (NYC).  Wide range of &#39;dogs to choose from and not for the faint of heart, health conscience eaters.  This is a down-n-dirty eating that you go for when you have that particular &#34;I&#39;m going for it&#34; scratch!

Big bonus to mention right off is the option for a veggie dog to be swapped out.  Not all options, however, are vegetarian friendly but there&#39;s enough there to eat from or to have something like bacon left off.

First time there my wife tried the Chicago-style and New Yorker, I dug in and went ape on the Korean Kimchi, Bacon Blue Cheese and Jamaican Me Hungry dogs, along with sharing a baby-sized mound of tater tots.

The Chicago style dog got rave reviews from my wife (her first time with that type of hot dog) and liked the New Yorker but wasn&#39;t feeling the grilled onions.  Which is a particular taste  on a dog, so if you don&#39;t dig &#39;em that might not be for you.

Korean Kimchi dog was rockin&#39; - only minor thing would be to have the short rib chopped up a bit finer but otherwise this was spectacular. 

Bacon Blue Cheese dog was better than expected although I would say the bacon either needs to be something more smokey or seasoned.  It was slightly lost when layered with the more heady blue cheese.

Jamaican Me Hungry also ruled with a nice combo of sweet and spicy.  The heat from the sauce and habanero salsa wasn&#39;t overpowering and geared more to people who what a little kick without choking.  A more kicky option would be nice to offer for those of us who do like a punch in the tastebuds.

The tots...yeah, those pushed the right buttons.  Big complaint for me is when a joint doesn&#39;t know how to use a fryer properly (i.e. dropping while the oil isn&#39;t back up to proper temps yield soggy fried foods).  Franks nailed it and served up super cripsy tots with the interior nice and fluffy.

Big thumbs up also for the innovative drink dispenser as odd as that might sound.  It&#39;s a newer machine with digital display - pick out the type you want and you get more flavor options for many of the types of soda.  

Gotta call out the guy behind the register when we went, 100% awesome!  Really friendly and seemed to be enjoying working there.  Place was really clean. With the range of dogs, burgers, shakes and other items we&#39;ll be going back as soon as we can!"

The only reason I didn&#39;t give this place 5 stars was due to a technique issue with cooking the bacon wrapped hot dogs. The bacon wrapped dogs have a tendency to come out slightly overcooked. This is a great disappointment because everything else seems to be spot on.  This was not a one time occurrence and it seems to be systemic.

With the hot dog bring the star of the show I had to drop the rating.

I had the Italian beef and I can easily say it has everything I like about Italian Beef from Portillo&#39;s without the mess.  Most recently I had their Maxwell Street polish. On a recommendation from another regular I had them deep fry the polish...you have to try this, it is good.

He was very interactive with the customers and super friendly. The free popcorn was a nice treat while waiting. 
Now on to the food.  I, ever the rebel, didn&#39;t get a dog.  My mistake.  I got the philly cheese steak.  It was small and the meat was very bland and there was a ton of gristle in it. My son got the notorious p.i.g. and cajun fries, both of which he said were very good.  I had like 2 of his fries, they were tasty.  I opted for no side so I could have the funnel cake.  When my son and I tried it he made me laugh by saying &#34;it&#39;s good but why does it taste like a pancake?&#34;. It was waythick and dense for a funnel cake.  Nothing like what you&#39;d get at the fair but not horrible. Since my son enjoyed the p.i.g. and we both liked the fries, I will return to try a hot dog of some sort and some more fancy fries."

After looking over their menu online I noticed a variety of different hot dog choices, from the traditional Chicago style, to regional varieties not often found in the area. In addition they have various exotic sausages, a Southwest Buffalo sausage, a duck sausage with fois gras, and even a lamb sausage. Having tried similar unique sausage combinations at Hot Doug&#39;s in Chicago with fantastic results, I was genuinely excited to visit Frank&#39;s Night Out.

Upon arriving there was a large statue of a hot dog applying mustard and for some reason ketchup on itself. I decided to snap a picture of it before heading in. There was a short line, and I took the time to admire some of the photos located on the walls and observe the decor. There are a great many photos of older hot dog stands and other frankfurter related imagery on the walls. When I placed my order I decided I was going to try a few things here. I ordered a Chicago-Style hot dog with fries and a drink, and a Southwest Buffalo sausage. 

The Chicago-style hot dog came on a soft regular poppy seed bun. The sausage itself was of the natural casing skinned variety. The pickle slice included on the hot dog was a bit thicker than I prefer and not actually as long as the bun or hot dog. This means that you don&#39;t necessarily get pickle flavor in every bite. The pickle was not too sour, but the thickness of it, combined with the shortness made it a bit less than ideal. There were two sport peppers on my dog, they weren&#39;t too hot and were a good compliment. There was a lot of salsa-like tomato applied to the dog. The salsa like tomato application was very wet, and it combined with the relish made the bun a bit soggy. There was not a lot of mustard on the dog, and I didn&#39;t detect any celery salt. The onions were fairly thick cut, but like the mustard were applied a tad more sparingly than preferable, especially when compared to the relish and the tomato. 
The predominant taste when I bit into the hot dog was the salsa-like tomato. It wasn&#39;t a bad taste, but it definitely threw off the flavor balance of the hot dog. Overall, this was a good Chicago style hot dog, but far from a perfect one. A better balance of mustard, onion, relish and tomato would be preferable.

Next we&#39;ll move on to the Southwest Buffalo sausage. Having had various buffalo and southwest style sausages from other places in the past I was excited to try this. It came on the same type of Italian bread typically found on an Italian Beef sandwich. The bread had a bit of a rough texture to it but was well suited enough to the task of complimenting the sausage. The sausage itself was a bit bland, with most of the flavor comining from the peppers, and grilled onions on it. The peppers weren&#39;t particularly hot, and were a decent compliment. The grilled onions really stole the show with this sausage, the onions were well grilled and tasted great. There was a sauce on this sandwich as well that tasted like some combination of a chipotle sauce, mixed with mayo and black pepper. It wasn&#39;t bad either but not particularly spicy. I thought this was a decent sausage, but expected a bit more kick out of it. I was very impressed with the grilled onions which led me back to the counter for an additional order.

Since I&#39;m not in Plainfield very often and since this place is more of a sausage specialty restaurant than a traditional hot dog stand, I decided to try one more entree. I went for for the Maxwell street polish as the grilled onions on the Southwest Buffalo Sausage seemed like they would be perfectly suited to this dish. The Maxwell street polish came on a regular poppy seed hot dog bun. The nice thing here is that the grilled onions were done perfectly and had just the right amount of carmelization and texture. The mustard was well applied. The problem lies with the actual sausage itself. It didn&#39;t have that deeply embedded char grilled flavor present in most Maxwell street polishes. It wasn&#39;t particularly spicy either. I would say that the sausage itself was a bit bland but the overall sandwich was pretty good.

I also tried the fries, as regular readers of my hot dog reviews know. I am not a big fan of fresh cut fries. The ones here weren&#39;t too salty, they weren&#39;t too greasy, but they were also a tad bland. I did notice that they have tater tots which I will have to try on a future visit.

Overall, while none of the items that I tried knocked my socks off. I like the uniqueness of the menu and recommend it as a place to try unique sausages without having to go to the city and wait in a long line. With some refinement to the recipes this could be a five star restaurant and THE place in the suburbs to try unique sausages. For now I&#39;m giving it four stars, unique and good food at a good value."

He frequents the location and always talks about it. We decided to give it a shot. They have a fantastic selection of unique hot dogs that are just delicious. We tried three different ones and enjoyed each one for its flavor combination. The loaded fries are fantastic, the Cajun fries although delicious contain more salt that one should consume, but that is a rather personal preference.

This is a fantastic local place that has fair prices for what you are offered. I have been recommending the place to everyone that I work with.

If you are watching what you eat, I would avoid this place at all costs. It can get dangerous."

I am SO glad that I found Frank&#39;s!  Hooray for veggie dogs!  The vegetarian hot dogs that they use here are delicious and surprisingly close to the real thing.

The Chicago dog is delicious and everything you could possibly want on an authentic Chicago style dog.  I also tried the New York dog which had brown mustard, grilled onions, sauerkraut, on a pretzel bun, and the Jamaican dog with jerk sauce, onions, and mango salsa.  Both of these were also great.  

I also have to give this place credit for having fresh cut fries AND tater tots, which are a personal favorite of mine.  The option to have different toppings beyond just your standard cheese fries or chili fries is also really cool.  I think I&#39;ll try some cajun tots the next time I&#39;m there.

There were only two things that stopped me from giving this place a perfect rating.  The biggest of the two was the poor maintenance of the condiment baskets on the tables.  Each table seemed to have a different combination of ketchup, mustard, hot sauce, etc.  Some tables had mustard, some did not, and there was a seemingly random assortment of hot sauces at each table.  The salt shaker at my table was nearly empty.  I realize these are small details in the bigger picture of the restaurant, but I always worry that a poorly kept front of house reflects a poorly kept back of house, and I&#39;d hope the kitchen gets better attention than what I saw at the tables. 

The second issue I had is that the hot dog statue outside is spraying ketchup on itself.  Ketchup on a hotdog is a sin and an abomination and the owner of this establishment and the artist who created the hot dog statue should be ashamed of themselves."

I love this place more than would seem reasonable for a hot dog place. But there are many reasons to love it. 

First and foremost, this is not your standard hot dog place. Sure, you can get your standard chili and Chicago dogs here, but there are several &#39;fashionable franks&#39; that are worth checking out. My favorites are the Chinatown, the Tijuana Dog and the Carolina Dog. I tried a chubby burger and feel like that sauce was sent from heaven.

Their sides are also pretty magnificent. Their standard fries are great, but you can load them up with a number of options. The cajun is delicious  and the loaded fries are pretty amazing too. Yesterday I tried the fried cheese curd option -- I was expecting it to be like Culver&#39;s, but instead of small breading-coated cheese bites, they were large and coated in a batter. It was a totally different and delicious concept. They also have tater tots, which is probably the key to my heart.

I have tried one thing on the dessert menu: the fried reese&#39;s. They take two reese&#39;s peanut butter cups, dip them in a batter (and it&#39;s not a terribly sweet batter, which is nice), and then fry them up, douse them in powdered sugar and serve them to you lollipop style. What comes to you is a warm, perfect mix of sweet and salty (bless you, peanut butter). 

Frank&#39;s is not health food, but it&#39;s just about the best example of upmarket diner food I recall. And it&#39;s probably worth an expanded waistline and a shortened lifespan to eat here on the regular."

First of all, the dogs they use taste like store bought and are tiny. They barely fill half the bun. They would be much better homemade or if they were larger or if there there was an option to switch to a bratwurst.

Second, the recipes aren&#39;t very connective. So when they say they add tomatoes and goat cheese or whatever, you taste each seperate flavor and not connection.

I had the Thai One On and the Deep South Dog.

A major plus was that they might be the only sweet potato fries maker in Plainfield. The minus was that my fries came with some regular fries mixed in.

Given the place has been only open for two weeks I expect service to speed up. It took 15 minutes for these two dogs."

Any weird style hot dog you can imagine they have something close to it and they customize fries as well. I tried the Notorious P.I.G. and an order of loaded cheese fries. Honestly it was a little too much for me but it was delicious. I didn&#39;t finish the fries because I had already successfully clogged one artery and didn&#39;t want to make it two.

We got the Notorious P.I.G. which has gotten very good reviews.  In my case the bacon was not detectable, the pulled pork was very sweet, tasted a bit refrigerator-stale, and the mac-and-cheese, while gooey, was not very tasty. The raw jalapenos on top were a little baffling and didn&#39;t seem to tie with the rest of the ingredients.  Also had the Mangy Mutt which was so drowned in toppings that it was almost impossible to pick up and eat even with the aid of the waxed paper wrapper.  Imagine my chagrin when two bites later the partially dissolved paper ends up shredding off in my mouth.  

We had two kinds of fries, the garlic parmesan that was fine, but the fries were limp and had been under the lamps for too long.  The second type, the duck poutine, was where things really went wrong. I&#39;ve had poutine before which I love.  I&#39;ve had duck many times and cook many duck-y things myself including duck fat roasted potatoes.  I know what duck tastes like and it&#39;s usually awesome. The duck and associated gravy in this case was definitely off.  It tasted slightly fishy and one piece of duck I ate was slimy. I told them about the duck being off before I left and got a bemused &#34;huh&#34; from the staff.  No apology for not having enjoyed the dish, no promise to speak to the chef or the manager. Nothing but a non-word. I and my husband are now feeling not too great in the digestive department. Was it the duck? I don&#39;t know since I discarded it pretty quickly, but it&#39;s the obvious scapegoat (as it were).

I can&#39;t ever go back here again."

One of the original highways across America, Route 66 ran from downtown Chicago to the Pacific Ocean at Santa Monica, CA, a total of nearly 2500 miles.

It&#39;s also been referred to as &#34;America&#39;s Main Street,&#34; and the &#34;Mother Road.&#34; The highway was instrumental in boosting America&#39;s migration to the west by automobile, and was full of interesting tourist stops, eateries and motels with creative architecture.

I love driving Route 66, the trip evokes memories of a simpler time. I think it&#39;s officially my own personal &#34;happy place.&#34;

The Chicken Basket grew out of a gas station lunch counter in the 30s or 40s, and opened in its present form in 1946. They are famous for - what else - chicken - and they offer it in a bunch of different forms, including a weekend lunch AYCE buffet.

The servers are very friendly and chatty, and the knotty pine room is adorned with Route 66 memorabilia. A basket of fresh baked biscuits is presented when you&#39;re seated, and they were delicious, reminiscent to me of &#34;Boy Scout dutch oven Bisquick drop biscuits&#34; except these were perfect, not burned or half baked balls of dough that we used to have in scouts.

I started with an order of onion rings, large slices of sweet Vidalia&#39;s in a crispy corn meal coating. It&#39;s a large serving, adequate to share between two or more people.

We ordered a couple of meals, the chicken fried chicken, a boneless breast, which comes with fries, gravy, and corn &#34;pudding.&#34;

The menu cautions that it&#39;s up to a 30 minute wait for the chicken, as it is all fried to order. The chicken breast was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside, with the breading having some nice crunch. In the chicken dinner, the coating was considerably different, much lighter and less substantial, and I&#39;m going to venture an uneducated guess that while the boneless breast was actually deep fried, it seemed like the chicken dinner was prepared more like &#39;broasting,&#34; a distinctly Midwestern thing, a deep-fry with less oil that also involves a pressure cooker. Maybe, maybe not.

In any case, unlike many legendary eateries, the Chicken basket exceeds its hype, the food is really great. Two dinners, one appetizer, two beverages and tip, $47.00.

If you&#39;ve never driven Route 66, put it on your bucket list, even if you have the time only to do segments in one or two states. In addition to Illinois, the road crossed Missouri, a smidgen of Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona and into California. It&#39;s a very popular trip with foreign tourists, as well, and there are even &#34;Route 66 Associations&#34; across the globe."

Ambiance isnt the prettiest service was slow n it was empty service wasnt good. Foods decent the best things were the chicken fried chicken n the sides it came with the mashed potatoes n the corn pudding. What i like is its not that expensive if ur in the area its better then going to a fast food place but i wouldnt go out of my way n idk if id go back 

Jalepeno bacon mac n cheese 12.99: i would skip this wasnt good. The macaroni was to overcooked n didnt taste like anything. The sauce that was on the bottom needed salt and seasoning badly it was very bland. The texture of the sauce was odd i think they didnt cook out the flour it was gritty. The top part of the mac n cheese was good there was alot of melted cheese alot of bacon which i liked i jus ate the top part threw away the bottom portion also didnt see alot of jelepenos in it i would jus skip this

Chili 3.99$ this wasnt the worst chili i ever had wasnt the best. There was a lot of meat in it which was good it was tender and flavorful. Alot of vegtables in it. So it is really filling the problem is that there was alot of cumin in it alot so it was really over powering. Just ur basic chili wouldnt order again 

Corn pudding: amaizing but its more like corn bread. This was the best thing we ate! It was nice and moist and supper flavorful. Theirs chunks of corn in it so you can really taste the corn flavor. Then theirs jalepenos in it the spicyness goes perfectly with the sweet corn flavor this is a must order

Mashed potatoes n gravy: the mashed potatoes were nice and creamy liked the addition of the skins but they were bland u definately need the gravy its really flavorful nice n thick. The flour was cooked out so it was a really good gravy only problem was a lil bit to much rosemary. Dry rosemary textually can be awkward n can be overpowering if to much is added really good sides though 

Famous Fried chicken: good chicken better then fast food places like pop eyes or kfc but not the best fried chicken that award goes to long man and eagle. Flavor wise it was good its just salt nothing special, thays my issue tasted to plan but still good just would have liked more flavor. The texture of tje skin was awkward it was way to hard the crackers they used for the coating was way to hard ldk how to describe it. It was really moist but was greasy though Good though just the chicken fried chicken was more flavorful so i would recommend that instead

Chicken fried chicken 11.99$: this was the best thing of the night. It was really crunchy it had a different crust then the famous fried chicken thank god! So crispy but in a good way. It was really moist which is hard to do when its a breast and without a bone in it. The flavor was really good because it had different spices in it this was better then the famous fried chicken!"

We were allowed to come up the the adult section to get to the salad and soup bar.  This historic Route 66 building is a must see for road trippers and chicken loving locals alike!

The main thing here is the buttermilk fried chicken.  Although the breading is very simple and somewhat bland, the chicken underneath is tender, juicy, and fabulous.  (If you could take the breading from White Fence Farm and pop it on this buttermilk soaked chicken, you would have the perfect fried chicken!)

We also had a few appetizers, the highlight being their baseball-sized corn fritters.  Also, I had their soup and salad bar along with my dinner.  Their chicken noodle soup is fantastic, with a perfect broth filled with noodles, veggies, and loads of huge chunks of white meat chicken,  Their salad bar offerings were rather senior-centric, but good:  Vinegar based salads (bean salad, coleslaw, and the required pickled beets,) and iceberg lettuce with basic salad fixings and dressings.

The menu also offers a choice of wings, which will have to be sampled on another visit.  Something tells me they will put the local chain wing joints to shame!"

Enter Dell Rhea&#39;s, which would be a pain to get to during rush hour Friday, but fits the bill.

Around 6 on a Saturday it was busy but we were seated right away. The space is homey and comfortable, and a little kitschy, with chickens everywhere. Ceramic chickens, not real ones - those are all dead in the back. :)

The menu is mostly chicken, of course (even the soups of the day were chicken dumpling and cream of chicken), but there are burgers, seafood, mac n cheese, and... well, that&#39;s about it. Many kinds of chicken.

We went straightforward - you get biscuits to start, and we ordered pretzel sticks as an appetizer and two chicken baskets.

The pretzel sticks were tasty, and the cheese sauce had some interesting note in it I couldn&#39;t quite place. Ah, but the chicken, that&#39;s what you really care about.

It was brought out steaming hot, with a lightly crispy crackermeal style crust. While I didn&#39;t think the skin/crust had a *ton* of flavor, it was still good and not overly salty, and the chicken was juicy, tender and really delicious. The fries with it were hot and good but not amazing.

To be totally honest I think the chicken would be amazing with some hot sauce, and we had some leftovers so when I reheated it the next day that&#39;s exactly what I did. (I did spot hot sauce on a server station, so I could have asked for some.)

To me Dell Rhea&#39;s feels homey, comforting, kinda old-school with good service and tasty food. It was good for what ailed us on a gloomy day."

Now that there is an array of people trying to perfect fried chicken many restaurants really should be aware, improve, and step up their recipes... If one (Dell Rhea&#39;s) doesn&#39;t want to let go of their original recipe than DON&#39;T but at least make another batter option to better please everyone&#39;s palates. 

The chicken was very moist and that&#39;s as good as it gets. If someone really thinks that this is the best fried chicken that they have ever had than they really should get out more and try other recipes. Either that or they are really just trying to hold on to something that they think is special and makes them feel good...

The fried chicken was just salted (slightly over salted), that is as far as the ingredients go. The breading was not impressive, it wasn&#39;t bad, it wasn&#39;t great, it was at best: &#34;just good&#34;... Some may not even care to finish their piece, some may not even find it very appetizing. The darker meat chicken needed to be cooked more so it wasn&#39;t so gooey but the breast meat was cooked properly. Besides the fried chicken being juicy it really doesn&#39;t hold up compared to other places. 

If it is not you saying it than someone will be the one saying, &#34;IT WAS IN DINERS, DRIVE-INS, &amp; DIVES!&#34;

Yes...

BUT relax because it is clear that Guy&#39;s producers, from Diners, Drive-Ins, &amp; Dives may have just chose this restaurant because it attributed to the Route 66 Special (episodes)... If you notice Guy DOESN&#39;T ALWAYS SAY in all episodes that the food he taste is, &#34;super tasty&#34; or &#34;one of the best&#34; and there&#39;s a reason... Because some of people&#39;s recipes/restaurants ARE NOT that great!

If you would like to be the next critic to Dell Rhea&#39;s fried chicken than go for it but do not be shocked if it disappoints. 

Also, do not think you&#39;re alone if you think the $16 chicken dinner is overpriced. 

Dell Rhea&#39;s has potential but it really is not impressive. If one is not a novice than they should know that great chicken flavor is not always just about brining it in salt!

Dell Rhea&#39;s is a nice place (not the washroom), has a great staff (excellent customer service), and they have some history but the head Chef/Cook really should consider stepping out of the box and improving their recipes. Just because it was on television and has survived many years doesn&#39;t make the fried chicken great. 

If they add a new batter style to choose from and touch up (improve) their fries, mac &amp; cheese, mash potatoes, etc. then it might be worth a try but until than it definitely isn&#39;t a top choice.


BTW, they should kick up the heat a little or get the fireplace going.


Also, time for a washroom remodel."

Today a man from another table came over and helped Mom get up from her chair when we were getting ready to leave. Very kind.

They sat us by the fireplace. It was so cozy and warm. I could have sat there all night. I downed a bottle of Route 66 Root Beer. There&#39;s nothing like ice cold root beer. Makes everything taste even better.

Stop here for good food and a big dose of history!"

Chicken n&#39; Dumpling soup: I was not a fan. It was broth based, and the first time I&#39;ve had dumpling soup like that. Not my style. (Was basically chicken noodle soup with dumpling shreds)

Cream of Potato soup: Awesome!! Homemade, delicious, and had a little black-pepper kick to it. 

Biscuits: served at seating. Really good. Crispy outside, soft inside. 

Fries: Ehhhh. Just normal fresh cut fries without much flavor. I&#39;d recommend subbing the fries if you can.

**CHICKEN: A+++    So authentic, juicy, flavorful. I had the 1/2 chicken. I&#39;m not a fan of white meat at ALL. But if you blindfolded me and had me eat the chicken breast here, I would&#39;ve sworn it was a thigh. That&#39;s how ridiculously juicy and tender the white meat was. Now imagine the dark meat. 

Oh yeah...... I&#39;ll be back."

This time I did not upgrade to the all white meat, but was still given two large breast pieces, a wing, and a leg. I feel like the biscuits may have gotten smaller since last time?? The pieces were coated in thick breading, had a super hot and crispy crust and were just perfect, unhealthy, heaven!!

What really enhanced the experience was the fact that it was free soup/salad bar night! In my mind&#39;s eye, I was seeing limp, old ice berg on the salad bar, but alas! Romaine! Decent fresh veggie options, even a cilantro vinaigrette! All parts were delicious. I tried a bit of their kidney bean salad, pasta and potato salad too, and all were great! They had two soup options to choose from as well. I had the chicken and dumpling soup and enjoyed that as well. It was hot and great. Only gripe would be about the cup size... it was pretty small. Obviously, you could go up for more, but I&#39;d be more interested in having more from the get-go. This stuff all filled me up so much that I was only able to eat a wing and fries! YAY for leftovers! There will definitely be enough for 3 meals total (Ok, so I already know this because I had chicken for breakfast and will probably have the rest for lunch-- worth it!!). 

Service again was super friendly. What a great place to have a good meal and relax. :)"

My coworkers have raved about this place for years, and a few days ago I finally got the pleasure of heading out with the group for some fried chicken adventures!

The restaurant is really tucked away down a side road, just a few blocks from the busy Rte. 83 and Plainfield Rd. intersection. You&#39;d never even know that it is there, but I think that word of mouth gets many of the customers to check it out. Then their amazing food gets people to return again and again, bringing friends! It has a weird vibe inside, kind of a mix between a diner, a lodge, and a VFW hall. There is a full bar and casino games on one side and a regular restaurant complete with lunch buffet during lunch hours on the other. Seating and parking are plentiful, and this place does a lot of business with the lunch crowd.

Now, the food. I got the lunch buffet, which includes all you can eat for $10.99. There is a full soup and salad bar, and also a chicken, pasta, pizza, sides (veggies, biscuits), and dessert bar. The food was great - of course, check out their fried chicken, but their biscuits, steamed veggies, and cookies were fantastic too. A few of the items were low or out when I went up for a plate, which was frustrating, but all in all it was worth the $10.99 and I would go back again.

We came in with the kids and got one chicken tenders meal for them, two starters (potato skins and pretzel sticks) and both got the salad bar.  We also ordered an 8 piece fried to go and planned to have that for dinner.  The salad bar is really slim pickings and when it is $9.99 (other than as an add-on to a meal) that is insane.  The chicken tenders were odd - soggy at best, but very meaty instead of covered in breading.  Service was good and friendly, as always.  And the chicken we took home we put in a metal tray and kept on the 160 degree setting in the oven for a few hours and it was perfect at 5.  We need to call ahead and order fried to be happy."

I overheard there was a &#34;triple-D&#34; (restaurant on Drive-in, Diners and Dives) in the area and I knew I would just have to go to give it a try and what do you know, it was pretty damn close to where I was staying. 

Was going to go with the famous chicken basket but decided to go for the platter since it came with the Chicken Dumpling soup that was mentioned on Yelp. Soup - not impressed. The chicken platter came with four pieces of chicken that was well prepared. They were moist and juicy and had a decent fried skin on it but lacked flavor. I thought that although the texture of the chicken was what I would call proper, they just seemed to just be lacking something overall. With the meal I chose the mashed potatoes and the stuffing, both I thought were a bit too salty for my taste.

Service was great but the place was just okay in the end and I think to be considerably overpriced for what it is. If I was not on business travel, I can tell you I would have been pretty upset on what I got and the price that came with it.

My girlfriend observes lent traditions so we are always on the hunt for good fish. On Friday nights they offer AYCE (All You Can Eat) fish, either cod, catfish or a combination of these two in a &#34;basket&#34; that includes cole slaw and fries for $12.99. 
We were seated promptly and the place was still buzzing at 8pm. This is a great place for kids, with the bar in a separate size of the building. The decorations are all about Route 66 and &#34;chickens and roosters&#34;. This really is a fun place to enjoy a meal an not worry about &#34;the show&#34; that goes along with some diners. 
Our waitress behaved as if we were her only table, although she was very busy with several other much larger parties. The drinks came quickly, then the snacks and the food followed shortly there after. Drinks were replaced when they were half full and &#34;would you like seconds&#34; came as I started my final piece of fish. She was amazing.
I had the combo for obvious reasons. The catfish was a little &#34;fishy&#34; but the cod was to die for. Rather than fill up on sides I stuck with the fish. I finished two helpings of fish and was stuffed. I was allowed to take the sides home in a doggie bag for my doggies.
I&#39;ll warn you, this is not a place to take your out of town friends who want to see &#34;Chicago style&#34; pomp and fluff. This is the place you take your friends who like to laugh out loud, eat, drink and have a good time.

It looks precisely the same as it did when my parents would take me here as a kid, and I suspect it looked that way long before that, too.

The service is friendly but slow. The salad bar is fresh but limited. The decor is charming, but archaic. You could find lots wrong with this historical gem, but there&#39;s so much right, too.

I&#39;m a huge fan of the chicken and dumpling soup, that tastes homemade and has dumplings with the best texture I&#39;ve ever eaten. But let&#39;s be real, you come for the fried chicken, and oh man, is it worth it. Moist, fresh, steamy hot, with a crispy-yet-unobtrusive fried coating and served in a very generous half-chicken portion, it is delicious. It&#39;s not greasy, but it&#39;s decadent. It&#39;s not revolutionary, but it&#39;s absolutely done right.

If you&#39;re looking for a spot that is going to do things in any sort of modern fashion, stay away. But if you&#39;re looking for good old fried chicken, home-y service, and a piece of nostalgia, the Chicken Basket is definitely your spot."

My boss suggested we go here for lunch so I was looking forward to it. 
First thing I noticed when I walked in was the decor that took you back 40-50 years and the lighting was very dark. Not what I&#39;m used to but I was there to eat so it didn&#39;t matter too much that the chair was from 1960 as long as the food was good. Most of my team got the buffet, one person ordered off the menu. 
So that&#39;s where I&#39;ll start; the buffet. 
I tried:
-rotini and cheese: 0 
I don&#39;t know if this is a dish people make at home but stop it if you do. Just make Mac and cheese instead and season it. This was super bland and a total waste of calories, I didn&#39;t finish it and everyone who got it at my table left it on their plates. 

&#34;Buffalo&#34; wings- 5 
they&#39;re not buffalo wings they&#39;re fried wings and on the table is buffalo sauce that you have to put on yourself and blue cheese dressing. The wings are okay but I don&#39;t like to construct my own buffalo wing. They should toss them in the sauce in the kitchen and put those out as well as some plain fried wings for people who don&#39;t like the sauce. I wasn&#39;t a fan. 

The other wings- 5 
there were another set of wings i think these were baked they were okay too nothing special. 

Fried chicken-1 
the breading was soggy and falling off most of the chicken thighs that were in the pan. I tried to pick the most appealing looking one but the skin was still very moist. I didn&#39;t even eat the skin, I tried it and it was tasteless and greasy another waste of calories. The chicken itself wasn&#39;t seasoned so it was blah. 

Mashed potatoes and gravy-8. 
They were pretty good..red potatoes I think. 

Pizza-0
don&#39;t...just skip it 
That was all I tried. I went up twice and was still hungry because the only thing worth eating was the wings and mashed potatoes. 
 The people who got the salad bar said it was good and someone ordered a chicken sandwich and she enjoyed it. Maybe I should of ordered off the menu :-( 
My waitress was friendly but she was an incompetent waitress. She let plates pile up..it was 7 of us so plates piled pretty quickly. All she did for the people who got the buffet was bring us our initial drinks and a pitcher of water so we can refill them ourselves. She never asked if we wanted separate checks and it was a hassle at the end when she found out we did. They only take cash if you separate your checks so they don&#39;t have to pay the credit card fee over and over again.  We stayed there an extra 10 minutes so she could calculate our checks, by hand!

I was in the Lombard area again for a seminar, and although I did want to go to DMK Burger Bar again to try the #1 burger on the menu this time, I decided to see if any of my friends were free and wanted to try something else. After some back and forth, we decided on Dell Rhea&#39;s, because it was on DDD and it&#39;s also really close to where I was.

I wasn&#39;t really sure what they were all about, since all the DDD videos on YouTube are being removed at a rapid pace, so I just took a stab at it. Looks like I got 1 of the 3. 

FRIED CHICKEN
I need to preface this like I preface all my fried chicken reviews. If you are a connoisseur of fried chicken, you can probably disregard my review. For some reason, to me, KFC is the best fried chicken. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a familiarity or a nostalgia thing, but I just don&#39;t understand Popeyes, Brown&#39;s, Harold&#39;s, Church&#39;s, Honey Butter, Roscoe&#39;s, Mary Mac&#39;s, Mrs. Knotts, or even Korean Tong Dak. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like them, it&#39;s just that I enjoy KFC much more than all of them.

So, that being said, I first have to comment on Dell Rhea&#39;s chicken meat. This has to be the most moist fried chicken I&#39;ve ever had, maybe on par with KFC or even better! Honestly, at first bite, I thought it wasn&#39;t fully cooked, because it was so moist, but after inspection, it really was. I eventually did watch the DDD video, and he brines the chicken for a day and then deep fries it longer in lower temperature than most. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what does it, but I can&#39;t believe how juicy he was able to get this chicken!

The skin is unique, at least to the ones I&#39;ve tried. The skin is not like KFC Extra Crispy or Popeyes or Harold&#39;s. Those are very crispy, and if a bunch of breading clumps together, then it could get crunchy. Dell Rhea&#39;s is less clumpy, and just crunchy. To use an analogy, most skins are like Lays Potato Chips, and these are like Krunchers. Even though I love crunchy things, somehow on fried chicken, I really can&#39;t say this is an upgrade. It&#39;s just different. There&#39;re pros and cons to both, I guess.

As for taste, it was a little different than most non-KFC types, but not by much. Maybe because they use shortening, it doesn&#39;t have as much of that oil flavor as others. While there were some other subtle differences in flavor, the problem here was seasoning. Even though the chicken is brined, which I&#39;m assuming is standard practice, the skin really didn&#39;t add a whole lot, so it was just a little boring. 

With the chicken being as moist as it was, I think if you added some Louisiana or BBQ sauce, which is essentially nullifying the chicken&#39;s own flavor and depends mostly on the texture, I think we&#39;d have a winner. Too bad they don&#39;t carry either. They carry Cholula, which I hate! 

CHEF PATRICK WINGS
I assumed that because the guy&#39;s name is on these, these must be good. Well, my buddy thought these were great, but I couldn&#39;t see it. For me, they were too salty, so that killed it. Trying to find flavors through the salt, it was almost like a blackened chicken. I don&#39;t hate, but am not a fan of blackened chicken, so I don&#39;t think I would have cared for these anyway. Wish I saw the DDD video before and got the buffalo. 

CORN FRITTERS
These are sized somewhere between a golf ball and a racquetball ball. It&#39;s like a cornbread donut hole with actual bits of corn inside, and topped with powdered sugar. They&#39;re not horrible, but I was very disappointed that the crust of it was neither crispy nor crunchy. There were tiny areas where there might have been a crisp, but otherwise, outside texture is like a powdered donut.

CHICKEN POT PIE
This was almost amazing! This tasted like a turkey dinner in a pot pie...and made with chicken. The chicken wasn&#39;t as moist as the fried chicken, in fact there were some dry pieces, but it had that stuffing flavor throughout that was great. This very well could have been a 9.9 or 10, but the problem was seasoning. It was like 75% of the way there. Just a little more salt, and it would have been awesome. In fact, if I took a bite of the Chef Patrick Wings, and had a spoonful of pot pie afterwards, the lingering salt from the wings would mix with this bite, and would make it pretty good.

JALAPENO POPPERS
Surprisingly, it was very good. These were pretty close to Jersey&#39;s poppers. They&#39;re about 3 inches long and about an inch in diameter. These aren&#39;t your store-bought lightly breaded variety, but their breading is crunchy. Ours weren&#39;t, but I&#39;m sure you could get a very spicy one. Cream cheese filled, but it almost tasted like tzaziki sauce! Delicious!

The chicken tasted to be fried in old oil--it wasn&#39;t quite as crunchy as I&#39;d have liked.    The mac and cheese balls were a bit dry--though better smothered in the cheese sauce.    The key lime tasted homemade and was adequate.  

I&#39;m a sucker for old school family-run restaurants, and this place has a pretty cool ambience--60&#39;s vibe.    

Definitely worth a stop if you&#39;re on I-55--but probably not worth a special trip."

If I could go back in time I totally would.  Got the Chicken dinner and the only problem is that it is way to big fro me to eat in one sitting (although it reheats nicely for leftovers).  Nice selection on the salad bar, great biscuits, and the sides are very good too.  They also have a very nice beer selection which was a surprising bonus."

So yes, my husband and I wanted to go here simply because we saw them on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network. The chicken looked amazing and our taste buds just couldn&#39;t resist.

It is tucked away from Route 83, but you can see old Rte. 66 from the inside of the restaurant. It is a Rte. 66 attraction. It has shabby farm decor that hasn&#39;t been dusted in years. This always worries me... if the dining room is dusty, how gross is the kitchen?

We ordered some famous chicken (which takes at least 30 minutes), so we started with the wings. I really enjoyed the wings! But the fried chicken just wasn&#39;t my taste. The chicken itself was super juicy but the breading they use is greasy, gristly, and there is a ton of it loaded on the chicken. Too bad, because they have a whole page in their menu about the chickens being locally raised cage-free and GMO free. 

They have RC cola, so no Coke or Pepsi products FYI. We just had water, but we saw people with beer so not sure if they have a full bar or just bottles of beer.

I think we&#39;ll stick to another fried chicken place when we get the urge to eat it again."

I was debating to add on the salad &amp; soup bar. I decided not to have the soup &amp; salad bar - IT WAS THE BEST DECISION ! As I waited for my lunch, the hostess put her fingers in the sliced beets from the salad bar and ate it.  As she walked along the salad bar she used her fingers to toss a piece of lettuce laying on the salad bar counter back into the clean salad bowl from the salad bar.  The hostess wasn&#39;t done! She came back to restock the salad plate stacks and used her fingers to toss back something laying between the plate stacks on the salad counter into the the salad bowl.  I thought it couldn&#39;t get worse! A waitress was coming out of the kitchen with a large tray of food. At this point, the hostess approaches the waitress and moves around the cole slaw side on the tray. While she is doing this her fingers go into the cole slaw which is served to a customer!  Then the hostess used a cleaning rag to wipe her fingers. The hostess is handling money, credit cards, etc. SHE NEEDS TO STAY AWAY FROM THE FOOD!!!!!"

Very disappointed. Came in about an hour before the lunch buffet ended (didn&#39;t know about it beforehand ). Mentioned to who I assume to be the mgr that it was our first time there, and wanted to see a menu.  The waitress informed us that any off the menu would be at least 30 minutes. More or less, take the buffet. Turns out that as something runs out on the buffet, SOL.  Asked the waitress if there was more sausage coming and she checked with the mgr.

This place is Americana, salt of the earth, unpretentious, wholesome, and whatever other cliché you care to employ.  And the food, the service, and the cordiality of the staff is fantastic. 
We were the first patrons today, arriving at about 11:15 -  No, we&#39;re not members of the blue hair set, we finished a meeting across the street and opted for an early lunch- and we were seated by the fireplace. It was very nice.
We ordered off of the menu, but based on the popularity of the buffet, I would say that there is a benefit to going that route-perhaps next time.  I might mention that the buffet looked a little cobbled together and ersatz, but you can&#39;t begrudge a restaurant for its physical limitations.  
Anyway, Chef Pat&#39;s chicken sandwich was delicious.  A grilled to perfection chicken breast with a spicy sauce and cheese on a nice brioche bun, and a plentiful supply of very tasty fries.

Overall, we liked our food.  We actually ordered way too much and had leftovers for lunch the next day.   Unfortunately, not everything was worthy of our hard-earned dollars.

Dell Rhea&#39;s is a dive.  The dining area is small, the soup &amp; salad bar is wimpy, and the plastic tablecloths are sticky &amp; wet.  Still interested?  Sit.  Eat.

Although their soda machine was out of order, Dell Rhea&#39;s hosts a decent list of bottled craft beers:  Two Brothers, Bell&#39;s, Lagunitas.  If you get high on nostalgia, try one of their bottled root beers.

We had dinner with my parents, and three of us ordered the Fried Chicken Basket, which comes with four gigantic pieces of fried chicken, fries, and cole slaw.  As hungry as I was, I only ate one piece of my fried chicken.  Although I like my fried chicken a little more crispy, the chicken at Dell Rhea&#39;s is still delicious.  Every piece was meaty and juicy.  They season their chicken overnight, and you can definitely taste it.

For a few dollars more, you can upgrade your chicken basket.  That includes a side of mashed potatoes, green beans, and the AYCE soup &amp; salad bar.  Dominic P. opted in for this, but I saw one sorry salad after another coming back to our table.  No cheese on the salad bar?  What the hell?  The toppings are minimal.  I tried a few spoonfuls of the chicken &amp; dumpling soup - meh.  Progresso&#39;s canned soup is better.  As for the cream of chicken?  ICE. COLD.  

We shared the macaroni &amp; cheese, since it only comes in an entree portion, but it can serve four people easily.  The mac &amp; cheese was creamy, but it didn&#39;t have a lot of flavor.  The baked cheese on top made it a little better.

The appetizer and entree portions are all huge here.  I cannot believe how much food we had to take home!  Most entrees are in the $10-16 range, so it&#39;s affordable for a whole family.  The fried chicken is the star of the show at Dell Rhea&#39;s, so I would definitely go back for that.  However, I&#39;d skip all of the extras.  Four stars for the fried chicken.  Everything else is about a 3."

We were a group of 8 and they take reservations. We were early and were seated promptly. 

They have a decent beer list, some craft brews, some locals and PBR on tap.

Our server was not polished, but she rememebered everything, got it all right and took care of us with to-go containers. The corn fritters were hot and fresh. Biscuits were light and flaky. I did not try the fried gizzards, but some others did and said they were really good. I had chicken fried chicken sandwich. It is my opinion that a good bun holds up to the ingredients it holds, and yes this bun was good and held up. The chicken was great. Hot and fresh. Not salty or spicy. We had a mac n cheese for the table, it was cheesy and piping hot. Most everyone left with a to-go container because we could not finish everything.

It&#39;s a historic landmark that used to be part of Rt 66. The site began in an old gas station by a guy who thought he could improve his business by selling chickens back in the 1940&#39;s. It&#39;s a neat history that you can read online or on their menus.

I always order their chicken because that&#39;s what they are known for, but there are other tempting offerings on the menu. But I also LOVE the old school salad and soup bar, which reminds me of places we&#39;d go to when I was young. Bean salads, celery and carrot sticks, beets, cottage cheese, peppers and other good stuff for a crunchy salad.

Friends who live in the area invited us to meet them there for dinner last night. We enjoy their company.

The chicken is pretty good, but our friends agreed that it isn&#39;t the best chicken they&#39;d ever had.

But what was really disappointing is that waitstaff needs to clear dishes more quickly. Between plates for rolls, an appetizer, my salad bar plate and soup cup and an ever-growing pile of used napkins, it seemed like a third of the table was covered in trash.

We had two waitresses, and one may have been in training. And it was a Saturday night and the dining room was packed, but there is no excuse for messy tables.

We noticed that she&#39;d deliver something to our table or one nearby and walk back to the kitchen empty-handed.

I hope they improve this service and may go back sometime.  But I think we&#39;ll go to the other chicken place first.

Everyone should probably come once, but I wish I could rate it better."

I had the lunch buffet, which included Cajun Pasta, Meatballs and marinara, fried catfish, fried chicken, green beans, mashed potatoes and gravy, their biscuits and a couple other things I&#39;m forgetting.  It included soup (so-so clam chowder and chicken and dumplings I didn&#39;t try), their modest salad bar and cookies.  A decent price at $9.99.

I enjoyed everything I tried.  Cajun pasta was OK.  Fried catfish was amazing with tartar sauce and hot sauce.  The biscuits were killer, and the green beans were really good.  Something interesting on the salad bar was what appeared to be cottage cheese mixed with pimento cheese.  Different, but tasty - I&#39;ve never seen that anywhere.  How was the main attraction?

The fried chicken was very, very good.  The breading isn&#39;t quite to my liking, but isn&#39;t bad - it lacked the complexity of the kind of breading that develops nooks and crannies and amazing spots of crunchiness.  It was more &#34;flat&#34; over the surface of the chicken, seemingly with cornmeal in it.  The chicken inside though?  Amazing.  Some of the best chicken I&#39;ve ever had.

Oh, and they had Oskar Blues Dale&#39;s Pale Ale on tap!  A beer I was excited to try when I saw it on the menu when I checked it out online.  Would I eat here again?  I would - though probably not for the lunch buffet.  I&#39;d probably eat in their lounge and knock back a couple of excellent beers with it.

We brought my parents along this time.  We had raved to them about our first visit and they were dying to check this place out.  However, we were not as impressed this time for the following reasons:

The place didn&#39;t look the cleanest, especially the bathroom.  The bathroom was dirty and had a strong smell which permeates into the hallway leading into the dining room (and it&#39;s a consistently bad, swampy smell which indicates a plumbing problem.  Not a temporary smell).  Another patron warned me on her way out, so it wasn&#39;t just me!  

The salad/soup bar area looked messy and some of the items didn&#39;t seem very fresh (iceberg lettuce with red spots)...I got up there and was almost afraid to take anything.  To me, cleanliness can make or break a restaurant.  

The food, while good, wasn&#39;t as good as the first time we visited.  The biscuits were much smaller, and overdone (black on the top).  The chicken was perfectly crispy and juicy on the inside, but the coating seemed somewhat flavorless.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were delicious and my favorite thing was the corn fritters.  They were devine!

If I ever go back, I&#39;d get the fried chicken basket instead of the dinner.  No need to bother with the salad bar.  I&#39;d miss the mashed potatoes, but they&#39;re not worth the additional $6.00 for the dinner.

We didn&#39;t have dessert, so I can&#39;t speak to that.

Our server was really good.  She was attentive and prompt.  All of the staff seemed very nice and friendly.

All in all, I wish it had been better.  I felt bad having my parents drive all the way from Huntley for that."

I did take the plunge and order it at Dell Rhea&#39;s...and it blows every piece of fried chicken out of the water - in fact, they are not even comparable. 

Dell Rhea&#39;s Fried Chicken Basket is mouthwatering, perfectly crispy, juicy, tender...too good for words. My meal cost somewhere around $15 (an upcharge for all white meat) and it was enough for three meals. The biscuits and to die-for! I barely touched any fries, all I wanted was chicken!

I cannot wait to come back, tell all my friends, bring EVERYONE! So fantastic!"

The biscuits were pretty blah -  the first sign that this meal was going to be underwhelming. Then on to the fried chicken which was overall a  disappointment. Very juicy but limited on flavor. Could have been so much better with more seasoning!! The grilled chicken plate was good but nothing to write home about.

I&#39;d say worth stopping for the old-timey atmosphere alone if you&#39;re on the road and need to stop for lunch. Otherwise not worth seeking out."

It&#39;s called chicken basket at least have good chicken . I had small sad looking pieces of chicken in my half chicken basket ,plus the fries were freezer burnt tasting. For my family of 4 it was 70 dollars for a burger some sad looking fried chicken farm raised fish plate and a appetizer. I have never paid so much for that much disappointment up till now. 
Now on to the good part of the review. The 2 star&#39;s are for the coleslaw. It was really good. Good job at one of the sides. Thanks for the experience."

The restaurant is located on old Route 66, and as such is now hard to find. When they built the Stevenson Expressway (it followed 66 toward St. Louis), it cut in and out of the Route 66 pathway. Dell Rhea&#39;s is on a little piece of 66 that remains out in the western suburbs in Willowbrook, Illinois. 

The inside of the restaurant is split into two serving areas - with a bar/wait staff area between them. On one side you find a family area with a fire place at the end...this room also has the wonderful salad bar. The other side has a newer updated feel that is essentially a sports bar atmosphere. Both rooms are nice and serve all items. This is a nice family place.

Dell Rhea&#39;s was made famous for its fried chicken dinner which is still a nice offering. The dinner biscuits are the best - eat them with the honey provided on each table. The salad bar is small but a standout. Prices are very reasonable. The only trouble you&#39;ll have is finding this place. 

From the south you drive down Route 83 ... cross over the Stevenson and stay on the right to Midway Drive ... you&#39;ll see a sign for the Chicken Basket which is another name for this place. Take a right and follow the road around back toward the Stevenson and you&#39;ll see the restaurant - it is the only restaurant there."

Biscuits were cold. Had to get up twice to ask the waitress to refill drinks. Coffee was cold. All three people in my party were dissatisfied with the meals ordered. Fries were cold, and bland, how do you mess up on fries? The place was not busy only two tables with customers and still service was slow. None of us will be returning. 
Pot roast sandwich came with au jus that was thick and super salty, tasted like it was juice from the bottom of the pot. The cod po boy was served on a very thick and very crunchy bread that cut the inside of my mouth. The tartar sauce was different. I didn&#39;t hate it but was not my fave. The chicken basket was nothing to call home about. I prefer white fence farm to this coating they used.

Now tell me, friends, if ever there was a better place to celebrate National Fried Chicken Day than at Dell Rhea&#39;s Chicken Basket, I do not know it. My best friend and I took a sojourn to celebrate that which is the holiest of all chicken holidays at Del Rhea&#39;s. 

We&#39;ve both been patrons of the Basket in the past, but to give you some background this place does chicken like no other. You&#39;re not getting frozen icky refried chicken like at certain fast food establishments here. This is the real deal.

 I think the first time I tried it I was prompted to do so after seeing it on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, of which I wouldn&#39;t classify this place as any. The dining room is country kitch with chickens and checkerboard table cloths everywhere and you get a real down home farmhouse feel when you enter.

The menu is substantial, but if it&#39;s your first time just go simple with either the chicken dinner or chicken basket. If you&#39;re really hungry, grab an order of the jalapeno mac and cheese and share it with your table. It&#39;s awesome. 

The chicken is battered with an interesting coating. It&#39;s light, crunchy and has almost  a grainy consistency. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s in it (corn meal?) but I like it. It&#39;s much less bumpy than what you get at a drive-thru chicken place. My wife claims it&#39;s the best fried chicken she&#39;s ever tasted, and she&#39;s picky about such things tho doesn&#39;t like to admit it. 

The mac and cheese is made fresh too, and baked so it comes in a little ramekin with crunchy cheese all baked on top of it. The inside is hot buttery and cheesy and the jalapenos give it an awesome flavor without adding much heat.

During the week my waistline has been victim to one too many visits to the $9.99 lunch buffet the Basket hosts. Then not only do you have the opportunity to try their chicken, but also their soups (which are AMAZING! Love the chicken dumpling), their pizza (strangely addicting for a chicken place) and their pastas. 

Bottom-line, the food is awesome. And I always eat too much of it when I visit. Thus, affecting my own bottom...line."

It is an older place and reminds me of soemthing you would se in the 1950s or 60s Northern California or Upstate New York on the way to the Lakes, somewhat unique then for Illinois.

The fried chicken does have a nice skin texture, and the portions are generous. I think the chicken pot pie was less good simply because it should have had More in the filling--more chunks of chicken and veg.

The mashed potatos and baked mac and cheese was lovely--really wonderful.

Service--I feel like for weekends they simply don;t have enough servers.

Overall, a nice experience."

Biscuits with butter &amp; honey were good, but not good enough to rescue this meal.
Unfortunately, my chicken pot pie would have been far better if it had been a frozen Marie Callanders! The version served to me here was almost entirely tasteless. If you are reading this and like pot pie, please, no NOT order it here.
The fried chicken sandwich the gf got was actually tasty. The salad bar had very little real salad on it, although the chicken dumping soup (order a La carte or included w salad bar) was the very best thing we ate the entire evening.

I was a tad confused when I walked in, because I didn&#39;t really see a menu or counter to order at. Once someone saw my confusion I was helped and given a to-go menu to look at. I was lucky enough to see fellow Yelper Osiris V. dining in, so she let me try a bite of her food -- a fried quesadilla (not sure of the real name) and pambazo. Both were really good! The pambazo sandwich was ginormous -- you can definitely split it between 2 (or maybe even 3) people!

I had tacos on the brain, so I ended up ordering 2 chicken tacos (classic style, not American), 2 carne tacos, and a chorizo quesadilla to split with the hubbie. I wanted water to go and at first was upset because I didn&#39;t see any water bottles in the cooler, but then they offered up some pretty delicious options! They brought out two adorable tea cups for me to try their chia seed water and hibiscus water. Both were delicious and refreshing! I decided to go with the hibiscus water and ordered a large. It&#39;s to be noted that a large size drink is a GINORMOUS beverage (think big gulp style) that basically kept me hydrated the whole rest of the day.

Of course I&#39;m sure my food would have been even better if I dined in as opposed to bringing it home, but I still really enjoyed the tacos! The steak tacos were my absolute favorite and I thought the chicken tacos were just okay. The chorizo quesadilla was really good too but extremely greasy. I love that they gave me sour cream, limes, and three different kinds of salsa to go with my meal. I thought the red salsa was very good and it had a nice kick to it!

For all this food it cost me about $16 which was well worth the authentic Mexican taste!

Pro tip: They now have a back patio you can enjoy!"

We had:

- crab Rangoon: this was ok crab Rangoon. It had a decent amount of stuffing and was your standard triangle Rangoon. The taste was off for us and we can&#39;t peg exactly what it is.

- sesame chicken: This was the worst sesame chicken I&#39;ve ever had, and I&#39;ve had a lot of sesame chicken. The chicken was actually moist, but the crust tasted like a dried out roaster chicken with some sesame seeds thrown on it. The sauce tasted like thin, not very flavorful brown gravy. 

- red chili chicken: my husband thought it was ok. It was spicy, but a little on the salty side.

I got the chicken with broccoli,  however it should have been called broccoli with broccoli as there were only 4 or five small pieces of chicken and the rest packed with broccoli I couldn&#39;t finish. 

The fried rice tasted like it had been made with coffee or some other odd flavor. Something didn&#39;t taste right with it and it was barely edible. 

The potstickers were the only good part of the meal as they were cooked perfectly and the flavor combined  with dipping sauce made them even more delicious. 

I don&#39;t think I will be going back. For the price,  it wasn&#39;t worth the effort and food. 

I would recommend trying another place."

New Chinese Kitchen isn&#39;t like your average Chinese take out where food portions are small, and ingredients aren&#39;t fresh; they&#39;re the exact opposite. 

Cheap food, enormous portions, great taste. I&#39;m not talking about a bit bigger than normal, their boxes are loaded with food! This has been consistent for many years, food portions have not gone down at all. 

I&#39;ve tried plenty of dishes from this place but I do recommend the ones I normally get. 
- Fried rice (huge portions, always have leftovers, tastes great.) 
- Crab Rangoon (not too oily, not over-fried) 
- Sesame Chicken, lets just say its not your average Sesame chicken there&#39;s a zing to the sauce and the chicken is never hard. Best Sesame chicken I&#39;ve ever had. 

The cashier Jeffery is very friendly, holds a conversation with you and always has a smile on his face.  And if you don&#39;t know what to get or want to try something new, just ask, you won&#39;t regret the recommendations. 

5 Stars, best Chinese carry-out ever."

New Chinese Kitchen is the fourth one I tried. Thanks for Philip C.&#39;s review. We enjoyed the Red Chili Chicken. 

A tiny place in small mall on Woodward and 75th. We just finished up the shopping at Meijier&#39;s and decided to try this place. I called up first to order the chicken and a veggie dish. The package was ready for me to pick up when we walked into this place about 10 minutes later. 

The old gentleman at the counter was very nice to me. He added the fortune cookies, chopsticks, and chili oil/sauce container into our package once I walked in there. He has correctly assumed I like the spicy food and use the chopsticks.

Red Chili Chicken was basically the chicken breast stripes soaked in chili sauce with red chilli peppers and onions. Spicy and tasty. If you love spicy food,  dipping the chicken in the chili oil/sauce makes the chicken taste even better. It is fairly close to Lao Sichuan&#39;s chilli chicken with bigger pieces of chicken and non-fried. 

The Veggie deluxe was a typical Americanized Chinese dish with a light brown sauce all over over-cooked veggies. Nothing special.

It is a nice Americanized Chinese take out place. I might pay another visit to try something else in addition to the Red Chili Chicken."

It&#39;s typical, nothing really separates this place from your normal chinese food store - fronts. But their food is good, and they give you a very good size portion when you order the dinner; definitely enough for you to take leftovers to work for lunch the next day... 
What I liked: The place seemed clean and their prices were fair. I ordered the orange chicken dinner w/ fried rice. My chicken was good, kind of sweet but that wasn&#39;t a bad thing. My fried rice could&#39;ve been better though, it tasted like they over-cooked it. I can say I&#39;d give them a second chance."

It is a &#34;treat&#34; - the food tastes great, is fast (10-15 minutes), inexpensive (two lg. dishes for under $18), and always hot.  The portions are huge...we usually have leftovers for two more meals- which is part of the fun.

We love:  the hunan beef...tons of very tender beef along with a variety of chinese veggies, the egg foo young (comes with 4 pattties and plenty of gravy), General chicken (feeds 3 people).  The two triple delight is also very good- with 3 kinds of meat and 3 varieties of mushrooms, and the House Special low mein (with thin, crispy panfried noodles) are also very good.   We always have extra rice when we order- so usually end up making our own version of fried rice a few days later to use up the left-overs.
The crab rangoon is great, and our daughter loves their soups (wonton and egg drop.)

They are in the strip mall at Woodward and 75th Streets, a few doors down from Pepe&#39;s.  It&#39;s carry out, but there are a few tables if you want to eat in. 
Note, they are closed on Mondays.

The owner, Tim is friendly and always thanks us for our order when we pick it up.

The man who greeted us at the register when we picked up our food was so nice and positive and smiley, that you yourself couldn&#39;t help but smile. We paid and left with our heavy bags of food. Starving and &#34;hangry&#34;, we tore the bags open. We could not believe the portion size. Holy CRAP. You get a ton of food. No wonder our bags were so heavy. We ordered chicken fried rice, general tso&#39;s chicken, egg rolls, and crab Rangoon. So much food. We barely made a dent in any of it before we started to fall into a food coma. Not only was the portion size more than generous, it tasted good too. Is the food five star gourmet? Heck no. It&#39;s Chinese takeout for pete&#39;s sake. I&#39;m not going to say the food was mind blowing, but it was definitely worth it. You get a ton of good food for way cheap. Do I recommend this place? Heck yes. Try New Chinese Kitchen out.

On the plus side, the order took only 15 minutes, but sadly they&#39;re carry-out only.  Oh well, not that a big deal.

My favorite was the Red Chili Chicken.  Juicy chunks of chicken in a spicy chili sauce, scattered with red chilis.  Spicy deliciousness!  The Jalapeno Fried Rice was pretty good, as well as the General Chicken.  Not General Tso&#39;s, just General.

The one dish the place makes in a very unique way, is their Sesame Chicken.  It&#39;s not your average sweet chunks of crispy chicken nuggets... it&#39;s actually not sweet at all.  You get 3 large crispy chicken breasts, sliced up into huge chunks, in a savory sesame sauce.  Differentt, but very good.

1.  The beef and broccoli was super watery.

3. vegetable egg rolls were very tough and chewy.   

    My Husband however liked the egg foo young  (and only the egg foo young) and did eat the whole thing, but the rest of it I threw in the garbage :(. 

    Do not recommend at all!   Plus they charge you for chop sticks and a few other normal items that you associate with a Chinese Meal.  I understand the prices are decent and maybe that&#39;s how they make back some cash but i&#39;ve never seen it done that way.

In my opinion Tai San Chef  down the street is much better."

The place looks a little sketchy, but they have good, quality food and the owner is ridiculously friendly- he even gives me free food every once in a while! I&#39;ve had Chinese food in Chicago&#39;s chinatown, NYC&#39;s chinatown and at various places around the world and for American-style Chinese, this place can not be beat!

Things you MUST try here:
BBQ pork fried rice
Crab rangoon (best i&#39;ve ever had- somehow super hot, but not soggy- eat it hot, it&#39;s always fresh!)
mongolian beef
fried shrimp
Egg rolls
and the almond cookies- every time I come home (I go to school in KY) I get 5+ packets and they never seem to last me the whole ride home :/

The servers are great and always make a point to say hello and remember us when we go. They are attentive and are very staffed which is great because the service is fast even when they are busy. They are all so friendly and you can tell they enjoy their job- which I can&#39;t say about most servers in most restaurants. 

The food is great! Best tacos I&#39;ve ever had- and Definitely the best tacos in Geneva! I like the al pastor! The esquites is delicious !!!! Their margaritas are fantastic! I get different ones every time I&#39;m there- and I can&#39;t tell you which one is my favorite- because they are all so good! We always get pineapple guacamole as an appetizer too- it&#39;s always delicious and super fresh!

But with every table filled and only one waitress running around, we were often forgotten. 2 other tables that got seated after us had their orders taken before us. Our chips and guac arrived before we even had waters. The waitress was very nice whenever she would come by but she just needed more help! 

Overall food was fine but not great. The chips were really greasy and had no salt. All the food was delivered with nice presentation and we did agree the meal was very pretty. We also both loved our margaritas. Mango &amp; Blackberry, yum!

Also, the interior was surprisingly nice considering the berry houses are a bit...run down, if you will. But the lighting was super bright and it didn&#39;t feel very intimate or cozy. The music was really quiet and we could easily hear neighboring conversations. It just felt a bit awkward."

This is a unique deep fried taco which is hard to find at most Mexican restaurants. The people at the other location claim they will make it for you, but I tried asking for it and they had no clue what I was talking about.  Also the lunch menu is not offered. Even though I think the portions are a little big for lunch you can certainly take something home and at least you will get filled up.  Please don&#39;t let my nit pickiness deter you from experiencing this stellar establishment. In my review of the other location I describe the available menu items in more detail which are available here. Unlike the other location a beautiful outside patio is available for dining el fresco.

I ordered the Mole Enchiladas and they were DeLisH. My friend ordered shrimp tacos and was very happy with the dish. 
Second visit :
Walked in for fried ice cream and horchatas and we told the hostess this. She said ok she would tell our server. We proceed to sit outside and the server comes out greets us and we repeat what we are there for. We order our stuff and minutes go by and still no drinks or even water. Still waiting .......
The Manager ( I assumed because she had to come explain) comes and apologizes they have no ice cream.  She offers ,the only dessert available , the Flan. At this point we are annoyed cause it took so long to be informed of all of this!! I guess the the server had no clue they were out of the ice cream that the only available dessert  was the Flan!? I tell the manager it&#39;s ok we will still take our drinks. Another 10 minutes go by still no water and still no rice waters. We finally decide to get up and grab our rice waters to go.  I walk up to hostess stand and server still had no drinks made for us. They were kind enough to give us the one drink on the house. I do hope to be back and have a better experience."

I was going to stay for a drink while I was waiting for my food, the prices were just too outrageous for alcohol. So I went down the street to grab a beer and wait for my takeout.

The margaritas ($9.50) really stole the show- the cucumber one had a nice flavor and the one with tomatio (?) was black and delicious!  Their specialty seems to be pork because there were so many variations.  
Only complaint was the little burritos only had meat and beans inside."

You&#39;re fooled by the outside deck but the ambiance was lost when the food was so bad...plus my drink tastes like soap! We are ones to always give rave reviews, but let me tell you...it&#39;s a warning to save you time, money, &amp; a stomach ache."

Really slow service, no real continuity by wait staff, had to ask for them to remove bottles from table and at times it was 15 minutes plus for a new drink to arrive or beverages to be refilled.  It wasn&#39;t overly busy, but it was clear they were struggling to keep up.  The worst part was they forgot half the tables dinner sides. Just a real bad service experience with so-so food.  The patio is nice and it was great catching up with our friends- without those items, I would have likely walked out and given my money to other quality places within a few steps away. Note to management: you have a great location, get great service; bring in some experienced folks vs young and cheap."

I am puzzled by the fact that they opened a send spot four blocks from the first.  
Great patio, great food, just needs a little time to evolve.  You can tell this place opened on a shoestring budget:  terrible, small tables that probably came from Menards or Target...way too small for mor than two diners.  No decor at all, except for the super bright, obnoxious neon &#34;open&#34; sign on the patio.  
Getting past that, all was great.  It won&#39;t take long for this awesome patio spot to be filled every night, so get there while you can.    Quiet enough to have a conversation with your guests.  Really enjoyed this place and will be back."
