I chose the sliced ribeye with an egg and loaded up on toppings. I noticed a reviewer or two who took issue with the varying textures of the toppings, but to me that&#39;s one of the great things about bibimbap: no two bites taste the same. It&#39;s supposed to be a riot of flavors and textures. The only slight disappointment was that I ordered my meal in a stone bowl, which didn&#39;t quite crisp up the rice enough, IMO. 

But THIS should speak volumes: I enjoyed my meal so much that I came back again the next day. BOOM."

I&#39;m not going to write home about the authentic Korean food I experienced, but it is a good fast-casual option when you just don&#39;t feel like cooking.  But, the menu is pretty limited.  
Both my husband and I had the Bibimbap, so I can only review that.  We had the spicy pork and it was really salty which was a disappointment.  But, you get to pick out the various veggies, tofu, kimchi, etc. that you want in your bowl, so that was cool to be able to customize it.  Then, a fried egg was added from the kitchen (you have to have a fried egg with your Bibimbap!).  The serving size was gigantic, I probably could&#39;ve eaten it in two meals, but I was hungry.  :)  The actual restaurant is rather small and there were some loud children there, so we just took our food to go.  
Overall, I enjoyed the food, but when I go back, I will get the Bibimbap with a different meat or try their tacos."

I had the Galbi bibimibap which was basically
Marinated ribs with various vegetables of which you can choose. They are warmed up and sit in piles in the bowl. I guess it&#39;s your job to mix them up. Overall a yummy dish but I maybe expected something different. The ribs were the best part!

I also had the garlic soy chicken wings and kogii fries. The fries were kinda like chili cheese fries but not spicy. They offer another kind of fries I tried and they were spicy but had more flavor.

The wings were the biggest surprise to me. They were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. The flavor was cooked into the skin perfectly. If you love wings then don&#39;t pass these up. 

This place is great for a small group but don&#39;t expect to come with a group of 4 or more. They have limited space. Also the food can 10-15 to prepare based on what you want.

Overall an enjoyable experience. I will try to return should I be in the area."

I did indeed see this time that everyone in the front or back room was wearing a hat, so that was good. 

Though one of the messages had invited me for a free meal, for the purposes of a fair and balanced Yelp review we paid our way and got the garlic-soy Korean fried chicken, as well as some dumplings again. 

The fried dumplings were just as tasty as the first time: greasy-good with the chile sauce at the table.

But the star here was the fried chicken wings!! Managing to be both sticky with the sauce yet remaining crispy-skinned, the meat was also marvelously moist: I was using Anthony Bourdain words like &#34;succulent&#34; and &#34;luscious&#34; as we licked our fingers. Also, these wings dwarf the babies at Buffalo Wild Wings or wherever: I couldn&#39;t even finish my order of ten (after the dumplings). I&#39;ve gotta say too: don&#39;t kid yourself, even though this is chicken, it ain&#39;t a healthy meal; as my bf put it, &#34;It&#39;s basically an elephant ear with some chicken inside.&#34; Still, so darn tasty!! 

So we will definitely be back whenever we feel the need for a fried treat!"

Freedom Commons is becoming the go to spot for dining in Naperville as the vast array of culinary selections range from casual to fine dining. My only gripe was the lack of Asian dining choices so I&#39;m happy to see this place open up.

Bibimbap is the main attraction here and Kogii Kogii Express offers a unique make your own chipotle style bibimbap station. For those that don&#39;t know what bibimbap is, it&#39;s a traditional Korean rice bowl dish that contains rice topped with a multitude of veggies, meat, fried egg, and Korean chili paste gochjang sauce that&#39;s all supposed to be mixed up together. &#34;Bibim&#34; literally means mixed up in Korean. Kogii Kogii&#39;s bibimbap is pretty awesome.  My favorite is the spicy pork but you can&#39;t go wrong with the Bulkogii (ribeye) or Galbi (short ribs). I love the fact that I can choose which veggies I want on top. They do charge you $1 extra for a fried egg or stone pot option. I usually skip the stone pot if its a hot day. For vegetarians out there you can have your bowl topped with no meat or tofu as another option.

The fried chicken wings here are also one of my favorite things to eat and in my opinion the best Korean fried chicken in Chicagoland and may even be the best wings in Chicagoland. They are that good. You can choose either garlic soy or Seoul sassy sauce (pretty spicy). The wings are super crisp and very meaty. A small order ($5.99) which consists of 5 pieces and a bowl of rice is enough to fill me up on most days.

Check out the Korean Churros which are pan fried dduk (rice cake) topped with spicy sauce or cinnamon sugar or the deep fried Chocopie for dessert! 

Overall Kogii Kogii Express is a unique and refreshing addition to the Naperville food scene.  Parking is a bit tough to find during weekday lunch rush due to all the office workers nearby but they do have dedicated parking spot for take out orders. Check it out!"

I just have had better korean in the city or in arlington heights.

Chicken wings are actually okay! But like I said I&#39;ve had better.

Bibimbap is a bit bland - i duno what it is but its just not what i&#39;m looking for.

DO NOT GET THE Chapchae - i should have taken a picture but the portion was like 1/8th of the to go pan. All soy sauce - yuck.

Tacos - they forgot to give us sauce sooooo... it tasted a bit bland.

The only good thing is the chicken really."

This is more of a Korean fast food place - the portions are smaller and cheaper. I got the bulgogi and my boyfriend got the kalbi, both came with a bowl of rice (white or brown) and a choice of two sides (we chose kimchi and tofu). The choices for sides are pretty limited and the tofu was cold, flavorless and hard to chew on. Other than that, everything else was pretty good but nothing really noteworthy. Will probably try the wings next time, but I&#39;ll also try the Kogii Kogii in Riverwoods!"

I ordered the bowl and got the beef over white rice. I like that they have a vegetable bar and they let you choose your own veggies. I went with mushrooms, carrots, bean sprouts, bok choy, cucumber, and pickled radish. And of course, I added the fried egg, though I was a little put off by a $1.00 upcharge. but hey, that&#39;s not as bad as guacamole at Chipotle. The flavor of the rice and meat was excellent, especially with a heaping of the chili sauce. I recommend adding a nice portion of the sauce to add another layer of flavor.

The Korean chicken wings were pretty good. They were crispy and juicy, and I liked that they took 10 minutes to come out because that showed that they are made fresh and are not just sitting under a heat lamp. However, the garlic soy flavor was a little sweet for my taste. Next time, I&#39;d try the Seoul Sassy to add some spice.

I would consider returning when I&#39;m in the area. I can&#39;t say it&#39;s one of my absolute favorite restaurants, but it&#39;s a different kind of fast food and very enjoyable for a decent price. 3.5."

We ordered the taco trio,kimchi fries,and the Seoul sassy fried chicken...total was about $20

O.K. I write long reviews so to save you time- eat there,but don&#39;t expect much in terms of great customer service or great tacos.Get the chicken.

We walked in and were not greeted,as we got closer to the menu board the lady just stared at us as if we were Pink Aliens... I noticed a tip jar near the cash register(good luck with that lady who does not smile).

Our food took about 15 minutes.As I waited I observed another customer receiving the same Lack of customer service.

The taco trio was merely O.K. I have a high standard for tacos as its my favorite food.When I travel To other countries I see if they have a version of tacos;It&#39;s that serious.The meat ratio sucked,the tacos were mostly veggies.My issue with the taco trio is that all 3 tacos had the same toppings.All veggies don&#39;t complement all meats. The corn tortilla was awful.My guess is they were steamed in the microwave which makes them mushy. I&#39;m guessing the chef learned how to cook tortillas from the back of the package- but that ain&#39;t how ya do it for tacos man!!!! My tacos came sloppily arranged in a large sheet of TIN FOIL!! Too many mistakes...

The Kimchi fries were good,but once again ratios should be noted.A large amount of fries with a little bit of toppings and cheese sauce. I feel like I&#39;d have to ask for extra cheese/sour cream if I return. The fries were actually good without any toppings.

The best thing was the Seoul Sassy wings. They were crispy,and delicious!! Those wings deserve a solid 4 stars,I even ate them cold the next day and they still held their crunch.

Go for the wings!! The Kimchi fries have a cool flavor- try them,the tacos ehhhhhh."

It defines fusion comfort food perfectly, with a small variety of choices but packed with great flavors.  Their wings especially are amazing and cooked perfectly.  It may be the first time where the juices and flavors literally burst out when I take a bite, and I personally hope it is one dish that they will never change.

Yes, better Korean food can be had in the &#34;city&#34;, but this is definitely worth trying.  I&#39;ve been here a few times, quick thoughts:

- Spicy Pork was tasty, a bit oily but good
- Wings (both regular and spicy) were very good
- Dumplings are also light and very good (kids love them)
- Kimchee fries - good, pretty solid.  Have had better at select food trucks, but worth it.

I was disappointed in the Spicy Chicken - it was a bit dry (need chicken thigh meat!) when I had it.  I haven&#39;t had the bibimbap personally but my wife likes it.  Haven&#39;t had that Galbi yet but that&#39;s pretty hard to screw up.

The owners/waitstaff are super nice and it really doesn&#39;t take too long.  There isn&#39;t much seating and a lot of people seem to takeout.

My only other &#34;complaint&#34; is Naperville Commons parking - completely insufficient so if you come at a busy time, you could be circling for parking for like 10m+."

I ordered doll (hot clay bowl) bimbimbop, I don&#39;t think she heard me because i ended up getting regular.  you pick rice (brown) and protein (bulgogi) and they walk you down the small selection of toppings. which do you want?  I wanted it all.  and she passed it to me.  I grabbed a spoon and sat down.  the &#34;sauce&#34; on the table is spicy, (gochugang) and you mix your bowl all up.  I did ask about my soft fried egg, and she said i did not ask for it. I know now.  Sat down to dine. A little hard to mix the rice up with plastic spoons but it worked. Taste was ok/good.

It was good, but definitely wasn&#39;t the best I had ever had.  I went with a coworker on Friday for lunch.  I have to say that I was very confused by the process, and because the employees weren&#39;t really able to communicate to me what I needed to do, it kind of soured my opinion a bit.  There were a bunch of sauces at the end that I wanted to know more about but the lady behind the counter just smiled at me like I hadn&#39;t asked a question at all.  Anyway, I had the bibimbap bowl with beef and upgraded to the stone bowl and the egg for a 1$ each.  The stone bowl wasn&#39;t worth the dollar.... the rice browned a little bit, but didn&#39;t get crunchy.  I wish I had just had them put everything on, but I didn&#39;t understand that everything was included (If that just makes me a dummy, I guess too bad).

Anyway, the food was fine, once I got over the ordering stress.  The restaurant is very, very small.  The two person tables are JUST barely big enough for two trays.  Trays are required if you get a hot stone bowl.  There&#39;s no room for anything else.  They give you teeeny tiny cups for water.  Seriously - dentist swishing sized cups.  I had to get up a bunch of times to get more water.  The sound of the refrigerators for the bottles of drinks that they sell is also really loud throughout the whole restaurant.  There are a few outside tables, but all of the ones with umbrellas are for a different restaurant.  If its not super hot, then I recommend sitting outside.  It would be great if this business would get their own outside tables.

Anyway, I won&#39;t be going back, I don&#39;t think.  Naf Naf and White Chocolate Grill are better options in that plaza."

Food is decent not too salty as some places can be. Selection of tacos. Rice bowls, entrees, or fried chicken. The fried chicken is amazing and Carmelites like how I ate the Korean Chinese style fried chicken growing up. I recommend the garlic soy unless u can handle a very very spicy hot chicken. Tacos were definitely nowhere near the level of Del Seoul&#39;s. I&#39;d stay away. The rice bowls are done like your Chipotle ones... In a bowl where you choose all your toppings. And definitely do try their fries. Both the kimchi and kogi fries were delish!!! Haven&#39;t tried an entree yet only because I&#39;d rather make that stuff at home. Wish they had a salad bowl option with no rice at all. I don&#39;t remember if they have any type of brown rice either. Never gone when it&#39;s busy but if you&#39;re getting chicken, I&#39;d call and order ahead or call for pickup. They had a lot of bugs flying around the ceiling. We&#39;ve only ordered carry out. Nice decor. Easy to find off the 88 expressway and freedom by diehl. Edit add on: oh yeah other lady mentioned service. For a fast food place not so great but for a Korean place, it wasn&#39;t the worst. Korean restaurants kind of have a bad rep for bad service because of lack of staff or a bad day. Do wish there was a bit more energy. If you are the only employee there be happy. First time I went there was a young girl and she was very nice and helpful. Keep it up!"

We were sooo excited because not only is it wayy closer than the original but this one had Korean tacos!! So happy we don&#39;t have to go to the city for them anymore. 

They are definitely more fast food type. The food was out fast but not so fast where it&#39;s kind of suspicious. The kimchee fries were amazing! They were nice and crispy, which I love, but they were still potato-y? If you catch my drift. The tacos were good, but gotta put the red pepper sauce they have on the table. 

I love my Korean style fried chicken! So I was looking forward to these. They were crispy, meaty and delicious. I personally like my chicken more crispy, but I guess my heart and health would prefer them like this haha. But the flavor was so good I didn&#39;t even care. Also, it might&#39;ve been because it had sauce on it. I usually get plain crispy chicken, so I will try that next time!

The restaurant itself is very clean and modern looking. I like the presentation. Also, there was another man next to us and when he had left the employee cleaned the table right away. Love that they&#39;re on top of their game. Can&#39;t wait to come back and try the galbi rice bowl!! It&#39;s such a reasonable price, doesn&#39;t cost an arm and a leg like other places."

It&#39;s good.  I got the garlic-soy flavoring and it was exactly what I was looking for.  It&#39;s just wings, but that&#39;s not too bad.

Also tried the bulkogii, which was tasty.  My wife had the bibimbap with tofu, and she thought it was okay. She was a bit underwhelmed by the tofu which was cold, and maybe that&#39;s by design but it was unexpected by her.  The jap chae noodles were tasty.

Two small concerns:  The website doesn&#39;t really convey the express menu, it just has the main restaurant&#39;s menu, which is more extensive.  Also, I didn&#39;t see it explained anywhere what &#34;Kogii Fries&#34; were, and I could have asked or taken a gamble, but I had bought too much to try it out as it was. 

Anyway, it&#39;s a quality place, and it seems to beat the somewhat lackluster food court at Naperville&#39;s Super H-Mart."

I got there around 4:45 and there was only one other group of two in the restaurant. The eat-in area is very small so there must do mostly carry-out business. I had never been there before, so I was a little disoriented about exactly how you ordered and how you got your food and the staff didn&#39;t really help. There were three ladies behind the register who all looked at me while I ordered (I got the bibimbap bowl with spicy pork, kimchi fries and a coke) but then none of them told me what was going on, so I just took a seat figuring someone would bring my food to me since there isn&#39;t any spot that looks like a &#34;pick-up&#34; area. Then they had me come back to get the vegetables for the bowl but didn&#39;t explain if they were all included at no charge or if I had to pay extra for others. Then they all left and took my bowl with them. Uh... OK.... Finally one lady brought my bowl back and set it on a counter behind the register. I took it back to a table but wasn&#39;t sure if they forgot my fries or if those were coming later or what. They had a bunch of coolers with drinks in them in different spots but I wasn&#39;t sure if I was supposed to just grab a bottle of coke or what. I finally just took one and no one said anything so I guess that&#39;s what I was supposed to do. I started eating my bowl and about 10 minutes later someone called &#34;order number 44&#34; which when I checked my receipt was my order number, nobody mentioned that I even had an order number when I placed my order. So the place has some obvious order flow and communication issues...

As for the food, everything was excellent. The bowl was delicious, if anything, I put too many vegetables in it. The kimchi fries, when they came, were very good. Everything was freshly made and the correct temperature. Spice-wise, I don&#39;t like things overly spicy and they had toned it down from what I was expecting, so I was happy with it but it might not have the kick you are looking for if you like a lot of heat in your Korean food. The size of the bowl with the fries and a drink were way more than I could eat. If you have two people I would recommend splitting the bowl or the fries because i didn&#39;t come close to finishing either of them.

It was a little pricey for one person for a &#34;fast-casual&#34; type dinner, my total with tax was just under $21. I would probably skip the fries next time which would have brought the cost down closer to $16-$17 which is more typical of what I would expect to spend."

We tried the kalbi bibimbap, garlic soy chicken wings, and kimchi fries.  The bibimbap was the big winner and we enjoyed the big portions and fresh ingredients on the the bibimbap.  The chicken wings were also very good -- not too saucy and very crispy (perhaps the portion size could be a bit bigger for the price).  The kimchi fries were delicious but I would have liked more kimchi on top (just my preference).  Relative to other choices in the area, KKE gets 5 stars from me.

I ordered one and it came out with a perfectly cooked fried chicken with a very crispy crunch (much like tempura), Cole slaw and tasty hot sauce.  It was delicious served hot with a crispy Panko crust.  

I&#39;m going to be dreaming about that chicken zinger tonight.  They also have a $6 dollar combo during the week with a sandwich, fries and a drink so if you&#39;re out in Lombard at lunch time stop in and have one"

Quality food, friendly and helpful service with great prices.  When I am in the mood for a fried chicken sandwich this is the place I always went to while living in Chicago.  The $6 lunch special is unbeatable.  Trust me, get the zinger burger which is a enormous piece of fresh white meat fried chicken sandwiches between a sesame bun.  Make sure to get this thing spicey.   The burger comes with coleslaw on top only the meat which adds flavor and moistness.  The burger comes served with fried which are above average.  Make sure to grab a shocker and add some additional seasoning that&#39;s on the table.  The meal also comes with a can of soda or water.

My only suggestion would be for them to clean the ketchup/hot sauce bottles more frequently.  They are consistently sticky which is a bit of a turn off but other then that this place is great."

So I can&#39;t speak for the rest of the menu. I chose to have the zinger chicken sandwich since it seems that is their premier item on the menu. And I think it lives up to the hype. It was a crunchy yet tender chicken sandwich topped with cheese and a special kind of Cole slaw. 

The sandwich was accompanied by a modest portion of seasoned fries and a drink.

The sandwich was indeed tasty. Though I felt the bun a bit lacking. If you aren&#39;t a fan of spiciness then you might find its mild sandwich a tad bit spicy. It&#39;s nothing intense but it&#39;s not &#34;non-spicy&#34;. 

Overall it was a good meal. For $7 you can&#39;t complain much."

While searching for our snacking joint I found this place nearby with nice reviews..A restaurant with plain interior is not that inviting but their food is !!!

There is a lot to choose from and really hard not to drool upon, but we tried out zinger burger combo (with fries and Pepsi) and peri peri burger and kept others for our next visit.While peri peri burger I chose to be regular, zinger we opted for the spicy delight. 
Zinger burger had a crisp patty of chicken coated with homemade sauce...It was finger licking good.. crunchy,juicy and fully seasoned in a single bite..I would like to mention their homemade crisp masala fries(seasoned fries),very crispy and mouth watering.Peri Peri was all about the spicy grilled chicken...chicken was tender and a moist with after-bite heat sensation.
Overall,I am impressed with this place and their service. It took 10-15 minutes for food to reach at the table, so hold your patience as it will be worth.There is ample seating space for bigger groups of 10-15 people as well..

I had the Philly cheesesteak, after ordering on the phone and just picking up. I liked the bread a lot, but the filling was just way too spicy for me. I eat spices, but my tolerance level is not too high, so I can&#39;t blame them. The meat was not in big chunks, like I imagined it would be, and the bell peppers were cut into very small pieces. I know another reviewer said that there was no cheese on their sandwich, but that wasn&#39;t the case for me. 

I also like the zinger burger. With a soft bun and crispy, crunchy, juicy, chicken, I actually prefer this menu item over the Philly cheesesteak. I ordered it spicy, and it was just enough spice. Not overly done, but a nice level of heat. The only thing I didn&#39;t like was I didn&#39;t know that it was going to have mayonnaise on it, and I don&#39;t like mayo. Other than that, absolutely delicious. 

I went with all of my fellow yelpers and got an extra side order of fries. Definitely a good choice, the fries are amazingly good. Crispy and the perfect amount of seasoning.

someone should tell these knuckle heads that chicken wings in this country are bite sized morsels coated in flavored sauce.  when you order 50 wings, you expect to say... &#34;is this going to be enough for a party of 8?&#34;  We ordered this and none of these idiots told us that these were actually steroid grown supersized real chicken wings fried in tons of oil and without any damn sauce!!!!  We ended up throwing away all that food because how the hell could we finish all that? On top of that... it was SO fried that there was hardly any edible chicken left!!! Why did we even deviate from the tride and true WING BROS down the street. 
To some positive however.... some members of our party ordered things like burgers or philly cheese or gyros.  The gyros were rated as a 10 by a teen in our group. I would give this place just a speck of a star but i dont know how to give less than one!

atomsphere - Typical scummy dirty dining area that no thought was given to.  Tables were probably brought off craigs list from a few restaurants that closed down. 

Employees - One person that barely speaks english.

They had pretty decent food once we started going there and decided to try this zinger burger everyone is talking about. As soon as they became more popular they stopped giving good customer service, they don&#39;t even bother greeting a customer when they come in (especially regulars,) and the last couple times we went there prices seemed to go up each time. The manager or owner is extremely rude, they have no clue about customer service. All these ppl are hungry for is money. Even then they don&#39;t mind insulting a regular customer.

The burger was not very fresh and the fries had a very unpleasant and unusual flavor to them. I couldn&#39;t even eat them and didn&#39;t finish the burger. 
No star for food and one star for the can of 7up.

Lately, I&#39;ve been reading about a spicy sauce from Portugal called Piri Piri (or Peri Peri). It&#39;s made from tiny, blisteringly hot bird&#39;s eye chilis and various savory herbs and spices. Piri Piri seasoning is also the engine that drives Nando&#39;s Chicken in Great Britain, an incredibly popular fast-casual chain.

It&#39;s no secret that I like it spicy, so I immediately chose the Peri Peri Chicken Sandwich (lunch special with fries and drink, $6). Since this place is known for their broasted chicken, I was sort of expecting a fried chicken breast topped with sauce. Instead, I got a delicious grilled chicken breast which appeared to be covered in Peri Peri and then dropped on the grill. It was topped with lettuce, tomato and mayo (which cut the burn a bit). This sandwich may be a bit much for the spice-averse, but chiliheads out there will find it flavorful and satisfying.

Service was very friendly. The food took 10-15 minutes to hit the table, but that&#39;s a tradeoff I&#39;ll take every day of the week for a freshly made sandwich of this quality. Next time I think I&#39;ll try their popular Zinger Burger (another chicken sandwich). If you&#39;re anywhere near Roosevelt Rd. in Lombard at lunchtime, it&#39;s worth a stop."

It a huge piece of fried white chicken breast on a bun with Coleslaw and spicy sauce.  Make sure to add extra sauce to get the zing.  The season fries are awesome and remind me of Checkers/Rally fries.  They have awesome week day lunch specials for $6 which includes the Zinger burger.  The only draw back of this place is the cleanness.  I think they need to work on that area a little bit more.  I will definitely be going back because I can easily see myself having a craving for one of these burgers again.

I&#39;d passed Mr Halal many times driving down Roosevelt, but it wasn&#39;t until we visited the Dairy Queen two doors down that it caught our eye and we thought, hey, let&#39;s give it a try.

I came in around 6:45 on a Tuesday and the place was empty, although it doesn&#39;t seem like an eat-in kinda place -- maybe for a quick lunch. There are two longish tables that seat maybe 20 people total.

Don&#39;t be thrown off by the Halal part -- Lombard and Villa Park have a lot of Muslim families but this is more or less American food, simply prepared to Halal standards, which is essentially the same as kosher -- just blessed by a different religious authority. The chickens are humanely raised, fed a vegetarian diet and humanely killed. Everything is fresh. 

I ordered the 8-piece family meal which comes with a whole chicken (2 breasts, 2 wings, 2 thighs, 2 drumsticks), 4 biscuits and a large side (I went with fries). I was told it would be 15 minutes and sat and chilled out. I heard the guy prepping food in the back and then he came out with a tray of freshly-floured chicken and placed it in the broaster, which is basically this giant pressure cooker. It smelled delicious, immediately.

Sure enough, 15 minutes later I had a box of piping hot chicken, a large takeout container of fries, and a container of biscuits, which was neatly bagged up for me.

All of this is to say it was DELICIOUS. Crispy, great seasoning (a little kick of spice), extremely juicy and tender meat. I devoured mine in no time. The fries had a slightly spicy kick to them as well which I added to by dunking them in hot sauce (which tasted basically like Frank&#39;s). The biscuits were buttery and flaky too.

In short: forget that fast-food place across the street. Please support Mr Halal. I want it to stick around so I can come back for much more juicy crispy fried deliciousness."

Cons:

There is a bit of a wait but it&#39;s because they believe in what they sell. It&#39;s made to order people so call ahead.

Ordered Zinger burger which was good and my my the fried chicken was so delicious and crispy. I just loved it and I guess this is going to be my next favorite place for Fried Chicken. The masala fries were tasty but not crispy and the coleslaw seemed to be a lil overpriced for the quantity.
Overall a very decent place have ZABIHA HALAL fast food. 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"

Surprised to see that they have expanded the restaurant. Now they have about 10 to 15 tables that can accommodate may be more than 50 people! I was so happy to see that, as just before coming here I was nagging about the seating issue! 
 We ordered their zinger burger and beef philly steak for the reviews they have on yelp. The food came to the table fast and  both the philly steak and burger were as tasty as described. Yummy! 
The only drawback was the restroom! It was dirty and should be taken care of. That is one reason why I gave them 1 less star and I will update my review with a full 5 stars if that part is taken care of. Would I recommend Mr.Broast. Yes!!! 
BTW,  they have opened a new place in Morton Grove, IL."

We tried the now famous Zinger burger, Periperi we requested the spicy versions (you can specify non spicy when you order) amazing!!! I love spicy food and this wasn&#39;t too weak. In my opinion the Periperi was a tad spicier but I am not complaining it was juicy and flavorful. The masala fries are extremely tasty as well.

Personally I wouldn&#39;t do a Philly here. It&#39;s like ordering a cheeseburger at a Mexican joint. The people were friendly and even gave me a sample of the pink color drink I forgot the name. It was good, different but refreshing. Only negative is there is no restroom available, I asked and was told sorry but no. I was only looking to take out so it was no big deal since I live close.

Asked the teller if he could still honor the lunch pricing. He was not able to. I understood that, had he done that I would have saved $2 per meal x 5 meals = $10.

Now secondly, we had some guest coming to town who were in transit on their way to Hajj. They only eat halal and were requesting a halal philly sandwich. 

We placed the orders for all the meals, and my friend picked up the food and brought it home. When we opened the boxes we felt like we got the wrong food. Our philly sandwiches were made with panini bread. Not the traditional hogie bun we are use to. I later saw on their menu they offer any sandwich in a panini version but we had not even requested this, so why did they make it with that bread. The bread was grilled but very light.

This was my first time eating her and the reviews gave me high hopes.

PLACE AND PEOPLE:
From the outside and throughout, you notice it is nicely laid out.  Dimmed lights, yet light was in the right areas for you to see your fellow diners and the menu.  The waitress was nice and thoughtfully check-in on us and provided her opinions, although she told me a lot of things were good and didn&#39;t drive home a certain dish (but that wont lose a place stars).

THE FOOD: 
Cheddar Peppercorn Biscuit: think the whipped butter and syrup put it over the top.  It was good at first, but as time went on it started to lose its luster.
(App) Sushi: reminder, not all seafood places make good sushi. Too big of cucumber in the spicy tuna and the shrimp tempura roll was neither hot nor crunchy, but I was TOLD it was all made fresh.
(Main) My mom had the Seafood Mixed Grill, while I had the Seared Halibut. Let me credit the cooks for the food was the cooked correctly, but the dishes seemed to have a light punch; the food didn&#39;t really impress because it seemed it was lightly seasoned and could use a little more finesse (boojie moment passed).  THE GOOD SIDE: the really enjoy and remember the mashed potatoes my mom ordered.  THE BAD SIDE: another lobster mac &#39;n&#39; cheese where the lobster was small and the mac &#39;n&#39; cheese didn&#39;t stand up on its own or compliment the dish.
(Dessert) The Apple Croustade was not really warm or flaky like a fresh made pastry, so I didn&#39;t leave there feeling like it was. The cinnamon ice cream stole the show.

IN THE END:
Took a chance on a birthday dinner and this one didn&#39;t seem to pan out.  Main dishes were fresh, but not very flavorful.  For a seafood place, they didn&#39;t set the hook well enough for me to recommend eating here again.  If I was asked to go, I would go and hope there have been some additions, but no apps or dessert."

My godmother picked the place because it&#39;s one of her favorite places that&#39;s equally convenient location-wise for both of us. There was plenty of available parking in the strip mall parking lot, which I really appreciated. 

The ambiance is rather upscale, dimly lit, and the seating is very comfortable. We enjoyed dining in a booth seat. The fish I had was very fresh, tasty, HUGE portions with good sides. I know that&#39;s not very descriptive, but it was all just a blur of deliciousness. Also, they give you complimentary biscuits, which ended up actually being one of the highlights of our meal! 

Tip: There&#39;s a Yelp check-in offer for calamari (for free!). Definitely make sure you take advantage of that. It&#39;s a really big portion and comes with different dipping sauces!

The service could have been a little better, especially considering we were practically the only people there at the time. It is still a place I would go to again, but only for lunch. The prices on the dinner menu were too much from what I saw."

I&#39;m picky about how fresh it is and about texture (the wrong texture can make a gal vom). I&#39;ve been to Devon a few times and every time there&#39;s a common trend- amazing food! Today my fiancé and I went and started off with oysters (blue pointe are my fav) and calamari (check in! It&#39;s free!). Both were delicious. If you like your calamari to taste traditional, you most likely won&#39;t be a fan of this version. A little spicy/sweet and lightly breaded. Oysters, again, are always perfect from Devon. They&#39;re fresh and you can taste the difference between the options. 

Finally for entrees, I totally messed up. My fault though! I ordered breaded shrimp and it was overwhelming for me, but my fiancé loved it! I typically don&#39;t like breaded shrimp, so totally my fault there. 

The service was good. Our server was polite, checked in on us often. She recommended a few options for us which I truly appreciate!

The only reason I&#39;m giving this place 4 out of 5 is the ambiance is pretty dull. There&#39;s nothing about the place that makes me want to scream to the mountain tops. Everything is good but the atmosphere just isn&#39;t that great. Location is in a strip mall a block or so from Oakbrook. Wish it had a better location and vibe.

Again can&#39;t complain, though! I&#39;m a picky seafood eater and I loved it! Don&#39;t forget to check in on Yelp for the free app!"

Chipotle Grilled Shrimp Enchiladas: This dish is like a rainbow of goodness in your mouth. From the freshness of the salsa, the lather of cream cheese and tang of the chipotle sauce with hint of lime, to the tender bits of shrimp in every bite - the flavors in this dish made it one of my favorites of the evening. 

We opted to split a Lobster bisque - and immediately regretted not getting one for each of us. The lobster was tender and cooked perfectly. The bisque was creamy and flavorful. 

The Bad:
We ordered their 12 oz strip steak medium rare. The steak came out well-done. We let the server known and he had another one ordered for us immediately. 

The Ugly:
Waited 20 mins for another steak to come out - came out medium plus/medium but we didn&#39;t want to be THOSE diners that sent it back yet another time (and also had a show to catch), so we finished our meal and asked for the bill. Steak was okay - not great. But I guess Devon is more known for it&#39;s seafood entrees then steak, or so I&#39;ve heard. We will likely be sticking to their seafood entrees next time - as they were the highlights of the meal."

However the service was a lot better, although my reservation from OpenTable went MIA, we got a table and my party got the food the way they ordered it! 
My mom is 60 something and needs things repeated so usually this is an issue when ordering but Jay H. was very patient with the ordering process, and was clear with repeating the order back to us and with his recommendations. 
I recommend the Joyce Farms  Mesquite Grilled Chicken, the chicken skin is crisp and compliments the parmesan herb roasted potatoes perfectly, the grilled asparagus was fantastic I am a huge vegetable eater so this side was so well done that I would highly recommend having with anything on the menu. 
No hiccups, or getting things I did not order, a plus in my book."

Our group of 3 must have been really duped, because nothing here excelled. From the knowledge of the staff about the meals or drinks on the menu &#34;....uh it&#39;s a beer from Boulevard Brewing and it&#39;s a Tank 7&#34; or &#34;it&#39;s a crab cake made with 90% real crab&#34; to the timeliness of service (over an hour to receive our main course when there were literally two other tables occupied in the entire restaurant.

Even if you chock up the in unknowledgeable and slow service to a bad night, the food was less than spectacular. Bland entrees and over cooked steaks are the name of the game. The highlights of the meals were the lobster bisque and the asparagus that came with the entrée. Everything else was forgettable (except the check that ran about $200).

We knew this place was classy coming in; we just didn&#39;t know that classy was a way to under deliver at a premium."

I cannot lie when I entered this restaurant I had the anxiety.  My husband and I are both stickler&#39;s about receiving not just good food but good service.  So all I could think of was the last bad experience we had.  But this time was a totally different experience.  Our waiter made up for all of the bad service we received with our first visit.  I believe his name was Jay H.  He was attentive, and knew when to back off.  No hanging over our table and food like Janet.  In fact, we witnessed her doing the same thing as she did with our table (too close for comfort) and there appeared to be commotion as others came over to the table to communicate with her guest. The guest did not appear to be happy.

Our waiter got our order correct, and it was delivered quickly to our table.  I had the &#34;mixed grilled seafood&#34; again and it was divine.   I also had some black tea (from forte tea in the cutest tea cups) and the shrimp scampi.  Everything was awesome.  With that said, I will definitely visit this restaurant again, but please know if they seat me in Janet&#39;s section, I will be requesting another table in another section or I will be leaving."

Shortly after being seated, waiter came to greet us. 5  minutes later, he came back to take our order, but we weren&#39;t ready yet. Then he never came back again after 30 mins of waiting....I had to flag a hostess down to help us find our waiter again, and it wasn&#39;t busy at the time. Table next to us had the same problem. Service wise, 3 stars.

New England Lobster Roll: Has a nice refreshing taste, but the way the salad was seasoned, masked the natural sweetness of lobster. I was only able to taste it a little bit, and the rest tasted like cole slaw. 3 stars

Lobster Bisque: had a nice creamy, lobster taste. With a spicy kick to it. 5 stars

Shellfish Bouillabaisee: broth was really good, well seasoned with a wine taste in it. The flavor of the broth went well the seafood mix (clams, mussel, fish, shrimp, scallop, lobster). 5 stars

Seafood Mixed Grill: The grilled shrimp was horrible. It tasted burnt...that&#39;s all I tasted. Scallops were seared fine, but could have used a bit more seasoning. Salmon and crab cake was ok. Overall, the dish was mediocre.  3.5 stars.

Seared Georges Bank Scallops: scallops were again seared perfectly, the lobster risotto was flavorful and delicious. At the bottom of the plate, there is a hint of buttery-lemon kind of sauce that goes well with the scallops. 5 stars.
 
Jumbo lump crab cake: Decent lumps of crab meat in it. Same size as their complimentary house biscuits."

The service was excellent and we had a great time. We were there throughout the entire happy hour duration and although it got pretty crowded at its peak, there were always a couple tables empty for people to be able to sit and eat. It is a pretty large bar area.  

Lobster that day was $13 for a 1 lb lobster. As you would expect, it came with lemon to squirt and butter for dunking delicious lobster meat. We also got quite a number of oysters. Five different varieties were available that day, $1 each. (The Devon Seafood Grill in the city on Chicago Ave are now $2 per oyster and last time I visited, there were only 2 varieties to select from). 

Checked in on Yelp for a free calamari appetizer. Although it seems like a huge pile of fried calamari at first, half of it was fried filler of root vegetables/jalapenos/other things. Still delicious (and again, free) but a little disappointing because I hoped for more calamari! We will definitely come back another Wednesday in the future."

The ambiance is sophistry,  the staff couldn&#39;t be nicer,  they are delightful and professional.  The food is good.  If they added sound in the bar area for the TV &#39; s it would be an outstanding place for an executive sports  enthusiast crowd to go for game watching.  Now, with no sound,  not do much.  

I&#39;m not your typical sports enthusiast,  but I do see an opportunity to attract a larger vibrant and high margin alcohol drinking crowd to their underutilized bar area.  The restaurant area is separate from the bar area so I believe it is possible to host a bar crowd and a dining crowd simultaneously. 

The restaurant investment cost is already a sunk cost,  why not maximize throughput (and profit), appeal to a broader base of customers and give us another great go to destination in the Oakbrook area. I&#39;m sure the wonderful staff would also appreciate the additional business.  I&#39;m still a fan!"

It is like a slow death of a hamster quite honestly, and it is painfully sad but at the same time appealing to see one get out of their misery, that really was my experience at Devon S+S on Saturday night 11/7/2015.  I marked the date because it really will be known as the worst dinner experience in Oak brook ever.

Party of 11, reserved well in advance and we got there 10 mins before our reservation.  I understand there is some private room, and granted it looks nice, apparently a minimum order of $500 bucks.  Not sure what sense this does, but unless they are leasing that space from some other company, i just do not see why they have to reinforce it.  Especially when you have 11 people, and the bill will be at least 400 dollars.  So we wait, and wait, and finally get seated after 40 minutes.  I was already a bit disinterested in the meal but I felt like i had to oblige to the dinner organizer, who is a retired army general and has his stubborn personality....but can be cute in a way.

Now we get seated, beautiful room, very nice and I am thinking - this is not bad after all.  We ordered our food, and it was primarily a couple of key dishes - some seafood items, a couple of beef items and one guy ordered a burger and well the waitress totally blew him off when he ask the type of cheese and she said &#34;This is not a burger place, we just have cheddar&#34;.  The fries that came with the burger were extra hard, possibly not fresh?  We also received some snarky comments again from the waitress regarding the sauce we ordered - and it just went downhill from there.

Decided to finally wrap up the evening and get some dessert, well first we had to ask for the menu since no one seemed to care for us try something from the dessert menu.  We ordered the cookie basket, and a couple of other things.  The cookie basket was pretty much not fresh, it was a day old cookie and wasnt worth it.  Lastly, the coffee we ordered was all burnt up...

Needless to say, very unappetizing experience, part of it was the food and most of it was the service.  Wish I could have written a better review, but this is what I have to conclude for now."

We were drawn to Devon by the glowing fire in the front window.

When we parked, I was afraid we may have been - little under dressed for a place that looked so nice! We sat at the bar and were greeted by a very friendly bartender who set up our places promptly and suggested the whole lobster special they have on Wednesdays. We were not disappointed! Our drinks were amazing and the apps were exceptional. It was a bit more on the pricey side but between the generous drink special and lobster special, I would come back, at least on a Wednesday!"

I had no problem setting up a dinner reservation on a Sunday evening and I told them it&#39;s both of their birthdays and this is our first time eating here.  I&#39;ve heard good things about this seafood chain.  This one is much closer to us.    
The place is attached to a strip mall so there was plenty of parking or you can also valet as well. 
The hostess greeted us right away and took us to our table in the back.  The place has a modern decor, dim with spot lights over each table, very romantic.  They had a fireplace wall that separates the room from the bar.  I also saw a private room for parties in the back.
When we were given our menus from Nicole our server (we enjoyed her, she was a good and very attentive) it was a surprise that they had both of their names on the fancy paper menus wishing them both a happy birthday what?!?  How cool was that!

Since it was a Sunday dinner, we also took advantage of their half price bottles of wine under $100 or 25% off bottles of wine $100 and over!  Yes, it&#39;s every Sunday!
 
Now on to the our meals, we ordered the following:
-FRIED CALAMARI with jalapeños and carrots, a sweet n&#39; sour,creole remoulade.  Basically, all of these items were lightly battered and fried.  This was a pretty good appetizer, I&#39;d get this again.
-GOAT CHEESE BRUSCHETTA tomato-basil cruda, focaccia crisps, kalamata olive.  This was a nice appetizer, the goat cheese was tangy and we asked for more bread yes please.
-ATLANTIC SALMON (Nova Scotia), my mom had this and it was a nice size portion she liked it not fishy smell/taste as all. 
-6oz. CENTER CUT FILET  with PANKO FRIED SHRIMP.  I liked my dish the shrimp were huge, crispy and not greasy at all.  I&#39;d get this again.  
-JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKES creole remoulade, mango tartar sauce, whipped yukon gold potatoes, grilled asparagus.  Hubby got this dish it was really good, two huge patties a lot of lump crab meat hardly any breading which he likes and me too.
-SEARED GEORGES BANK SCALLOPS lemon asparagus risotto, fennel, basil oil, balsamic glaze.  My brother got this dish which he enjoyed.  The scallops were pretty big.
-We also ordered another steak soft and how we wanted the steak cooked (medium rare, juicy soft and pink in the middle) and a burger with fries (that was not on the dinner menu but they were able to accommodate.  It&#39;s a burger, it was pretty good portion...eh it&#39;s a burger ok).
-We also shared sides which is really enough for 2 or more people, ala cart.
-WHIPPED YUKON GOLD POTATOES
-BRUSSELS SPROUTS WITH PROSCIUTTO
We laugh, we ate, we enjoyed our dinner and yes we closed the place out...at 10pm. 
Overall, it was a nice experience especially from the Burbs."

I usually can find something to nitpick about but there was literally nothing about my visit here that went bad. I did end up spending over $100 even with a $15 off coupon though, so this is more of a special occasion place for me in the future now.

Anyway, the wife and I recently moved to Elmhurst and found this place on Yelp. We were celebrating our anniversary and she chose this place. They have free valet if you need it, but we found a spot right in front so parking isn&#39;t too big. I was wondering how it could be so nice since it was connected to a strip mall, but once you go in, it looks like all the other high class steak places around.

I really liked the lighting of the place. Super dark but a spotlight on every table. Makes reading a menu super easy but still give you that secluded vibe. Anyway, we started with the calamari. It sucks because I forgot to check in on Yelp and apparently you get a free app if you do, so that would have been nice. The calamari was good, comes with two different sauces. I would have preferred it to be crunchier but just personal opinion. 

I ended up getting the surf and turf, 6oz filet with the crab cake. I chose the crab cake over the shrimp because the server said that it was 90% crab with 10% bread crumbs. It was pretty good, though just smaller than what I thought it would be. Steak was pretty good though, really well cooked with a smoky touch to it. I got a side for brussels sprouts along with the lobster mac and cheese. Both were pretty good, but for some reason I was just super full and didn&#39;t eat a lot of it. The wife got the scallops and she liked it a lot. The risotto was super lemony for me, but it&#39;s her style. Hers didn&#39;t come with a side.

We finished our celebration with some creme brulee, and though it wasn&#39;t the best one we&#39;ve ever had (it&#39;s our go to dessert and we get it whenever we can) it was still really good. The peanut brittle stick covered in chocolate was a good touch. Our waitress was super nice and filled my water without me even asking. I even got a free sprite for some reason. Either because the forgot my steak knife, or they&#39;re just either super nice. Either way, it&#39;s a win for me.

Sign up for their email service and you&#39;ll get a $15 off of $30 coupon right away."

The food was delicious although the portions were relatively small.  My hubbie ordered the seared ahi tuna.  Loved it.  Served rare as it should be.  My younger son raved about the filet mignon... Best steak he ever had, he said.  &#34;Didnt need A1!&#34;  I ordered the scallops with risotto.  Cooked perfectly but the scallops were smaller than I expected  My older son ordered the mahi mahi.  Just ok, rather blan.  Thumbs up for the following sides, the lobster mac n cheese, green beans with pecans and whipped potatoes.  The asparagus and biscuits (served when you are seated) were okay.  The only thing I would not order again would be the crab hush puppies.  You couldn&#39;t taste the crab.  Overall, we gave the food 4.5 stars.  

When II called to make a reservation, I told them it was my husband&#39;s bday.  They printed, &#34;happy 47th bday, Rex&#34; on the menu.  They also brought us complimentary carrot cake with a candle!  Nice touch.  And for this, I rate them an overall 5!

From the moment I called to make reservations with Marina it was a pleasant experience all the way thru the end of dinner. Juan Carlos was our server &amp; he made recommendations; was attentive but not overbearing &amp; funny!

The food did not disappoint as well. Everything from the appetizers; peppercorn biscuits; drinks to entrees were on point. Nothing to complain about.

Residing in the city &amp; having a variety of restaurants to pick from I deliberately picked Devon &amp; am happy with my choice!

Their attention to detail was noticed most definitely from asking if we were celebrating an occasion; to the happy birthday menus &amp; even the candle on our desert! And being from the city it was ecspecially nice that they offer complimentary valet parking! Nice perk

For drinks we had the sparkling blackberry martini and bourbon basil smash...both were so good! I do not usually drink bourbon or any type of dark liquor for the matter, but the bourbon basil was banging.
Because we checked in on Yelp, we received the complimentary fried calamari (thanks Yelp!) which was a hit. We also had the large spicy tuna roll and again, delish. Because we had already consumed so much food, we decided to split the seafood mixed grill and wow, everything was cooked to perfection. The seafood grill was so much food, I could not imagine consuming that plate solo. The crab cakes were meaty with very little filling, if not at all. 
Of course, we just had to do dessert. We were ogling the apple croustade and frozen flavors. My boyfriend and I have to really watch our dairy intake, so we pay extra attention when we are told that the ice cream is freshly made. The apple croustade was divine, but the frozen flavors stole the night and my heart. The mint sorbet with the fresh mint leaves was my favorite and with three different yummy sorbet flavors, they also include a lemon shortbread cookie. Yes, the ice cream was as fresh as promised and we went to bed happy and without any upset stomachs."

Typically, I wouldn&#39;t bring my infant, but given the holiday, I had my 11 week old with me. Given that he&#39;s too small for a high chair, we brought his car seat in with us. We had a reservation for 10 people, plus my son. We asked for a sling or a high chair that we could just flip upside down. We were very rudely told that there was one slings do it was in use. The hostess then suggested we &#34;just put the baby under the table&#34; and walked away. Again, I understand this is not normally a baby/kid restaurant. But, to be told to put my child under the table while celebrating my first Mother&#39;s Day was the most insulting and rude request. 

The only reason I didn&#39;t give this place one star was because the food was decent. I ordered the maple salmon. It was slightly above average. I would have preferred it to be cooked a little longer, but the flavor was good. It was served with mashed potatoes which were fine. It also came with asparagus, which were not my favorite. They couple the asparagus with a tomato medley, the two just don&#39;t really go together. I will say that the presentation of the plate was pretty neat and unique. Our waiter was the best part of the restaurant. 

You only have one chance at a first impression, and unfortunately our experience was tainted before even sitting down. There are dozens of other restaurants nearby that are $30.00 a plate. I will not be returning.c"

The x-rated martini is really good for any girl, not too strong or sweet. Definitely can&#39;t wait to come back here and also to enjoy their happy hour."

Devon Seafood and grill has been my go to place for happy hour, the best drinks and best appetizers. I practically live at the  downtown Chicago Ave. location and now I know why I should stick to that location. This place left nothing but a bad taste in my mouth. I had a friend meet me for drinks after a long day at work. She was seated in the dining area, had we known that the hostess needs to have visitors ask for happy hour to enjoy happy hour drinks,  we would have asked to be seated elsewhere. I&#39;ve never had this problem at ANY restaurant. After speaking with hostess and manager nothing could be done about our bill, because we should have let them know we were there for happy hour. NEVER AGAIN."

Highlights from the group:  the lobster bisque and the boullaibase.  It just didn&#39;t trip my trigger like its cousin, Bristol Seafood Grille in St. Louis.  This location felt much more like a chai restaurant and not at all cozy.  I thought the pricing was on the high side for what was served.  I am not drawn in any way to go back, but wouldn&#39;t avoid it either."

Her employers were gracious enough to pick up the check to send us out for a fine dinner. After figuring out what places were in the area that took reservations, we had more than enough lines already for one day, we decided on Devon. The food was excellent starting with the lobster bisque, oysters on the half shell and the fried calamari. We actually didn&#39;t plan on the calamari until it popped up on yelp as a check in offer, so we figured might as well try that too. 

My wife ordered the filet of beef with crab cakes and I ordered the seafood platter. The food started coming out rather quickly and man was it good. The lobster bisque was so deliciously rich and velvety, oysters top notch and fresh as could be and the calamari tender and spicy with peppers, really good.

My seafood platter featured huge, perfectly cooked scallops, shrimp, salmon, crab cakes and mashed potatoes. Every bit delicious. You got to love flown in fresh Foley&#39;s fish. I have seen one of their presentations years ago while attending culinary school, and they&#39;re the best.

My wife&#39;s filet and crab cake combo was unreal, perfect steak and succulent crab cake, these were so packed with crab I don&#39;t know how it all held together. Hers also came with a side and she got lobster Mac and cheese. A first for us and we both really enjoyed it.

For dessert we split the carrot cake, very fine as well, not our favorite dessert but I need to make one soon for a party and I wanted to see how they assembled and presented it. It was very nice but a tad too sweet in my opinion. 

Minor complaints, after dinner my wife asked me how many stars I would give my review and I said probably a 5, based on food alone. She said that the meal seemed a bit rushed and reminded me how long our dinner took. She was right, the meal had been a bit rushed which I contribute to the Holiday making the restaurant 95% empty and my calamari add on most likely screwed up the kitchen&#39;s timing. 

All in all it was probably the best seafood meal I have had in years. Was it complicated or inventive food? No, but the perfectly simple preparation of the freshest ingredients made it really stellar in my opinion. Would I spend close to 2 bills of my own money going there again? Yeah, maybe for an anniversary or special occasion. Thanks Devon for an excellent meal."

They have a great beer selection. Service was also great. 

Because we checked in on Yelp, we got a few appetizer of calamari. It was done perfect. 

We also ordered mussels.  Not all of them were open.this is why we are only giving them for stars.  They need to pay attention to quality, and at a minimum, have a manager deal with this.

My fiance and I went with 2 other couples. I was pleased to see the complimentary valet! We were seated right away, as the restaurant was not full. Our server was friendly and helpful. 

I started with the smoked salmon flat bread and it was delicious! The edges of the salmon were darker, which I don&#39;t like, but I just cut around it. My friends started with the goat cheese bruschetta, which was deconstructed. It looked good and they seemed to enjoy it. 

I got the Maine Lobster and for $22, it was a steal! It was a whole lobster, along with steamed asparagus and my choice of side so I went with the roasted potatoes. They give you SO much food! My fiance ordered the filet which also came with veggies and a side. The fries he got are cooked with paprika and pepper and were very delicious. 

Everyone else we were with seemed to like their food a lot. A few of us got dessert as well. My fiance&#39;s only complaint was that he felt like the lava cake was really dry. He left half of it on the plate.

I was glad to have my $15 off coupon for their email sign up. We didn&#39;t drink any alcohol and our bill was still $90 after the coupon. It was worth it, but I think for me this would be more of a lunch place. I want to come back with my mom and get some salads and appetizers!"

I was here for dinner on a Saturday evening. For appetizers, we ordered the calamari. Luckily I checked in on Yelp and received the free calamari appetizer offer. If we had to pay, it would&#39;ve been a rip off. It was very skimpy on calamari. They fry some finely cut veggies as a filler to make the appetizer look bigger than it is. For my entree I had the shellfish bouillabaisse. It was ok compared to what I&#39;ve had in the past at other restaurants.  They serve it with a seafood cracker which I didn&#39;t use at all which made me think why they would provide a cracker if it wasn&#39;t needed. I read the description on the menu which read: SHELLFISH BOUILLABAISSE mussels, clams, lobster, shrimp, scallops, and fresh fish in a tomato-saffron broth, grilled bread, espelette pepper rouille. My guess was it was for some lobster which I didn&#39;t remember having so I asked the server. His response was that they put lobster extract in the bouillabaisse. I was slightly confused and asked again and he kept saying they put lobster extract in it. What in the world is lobster extract? Is that a liquid like vanilla extract? The server was obviously clueless."

FRESH!!! Seafood is genuinely fresh and flavorful.

My wife ordered the shrimp enchiladas which were perfectly seasoned and fresh to the taste. This was by far the best shrimp echiladas I have ever tried!

Sides: Mushrooms were solid and flavorful but the creamed Kale could use a hint of salt. 

Waiter brought us some home made Carrot Cake on the house for desert - which was AMAZING! I&#39;m not into Carrot Cake but I must say... I&#39;d definately go back.

I ordered calamari and caesar salad apps.  Then I ordered the shrimp scampi, crab cakes and asparagus as my entree.  I was overly pleased with everything except the crab cakes, they were just okay.  The calamari is well seasoned, well prepared and more than enough for 4 people to share.  The asparagus were PERFECTLY prepared and the shrimp scampi certainly was no less delightful.  

The crab cakes were fresh, no filler and nothing but crab however way too much mayo for my taste...they were more like lump crab cake salad than crab cakes.  They could probably earn a 5 from me if they do a little more perfecting to the crab cakes because that&#39;s the original reason I chose to go there.  Would definitely go back but not sure if I&#39;d order the crab cakes again...although there&#39;s no need because everything else is soo good.  Oh, did I mention I couldn&#39;t even eat half my food because their portions are pretty healthy?? My advice would be to skip the appetizer and get straight into the entree OR order both and just know you&#39;ll either have to salvage or take some home.

Very friendly and accommodating staff. I particularly appreciated the prompt hot-served biscuits, which reminded me somewhat of a sweeter version of  cheddar bay biscuits minus the cheese.


Grilled seafood combo entree is delicious! Good portion of salmon with a gorgeous crust. Very flavorful. One heavenly delicious scallop (wish there were more), two shrimp - delicious but not much to note. Extremely delicious lump crab cake, good size portion but I didn&#39;t want it to be gone it was so delicious!  


Potato wedges are ok, nothing fantastic. I substituted the asparagus for artichoke which was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious with the Garlic parmesan sauce.  


There was a tasty remoulade. The sweet mango sauce was only ok but my least fave of the 3 sauce accompaniments.      


My boss got the flat iron steak with a wedge salad, the steak portion was VERY tiny but decent flavor, probably not a good value, though, and definitely not good enough to satisfy a hungry man&#39;s appetite.  


A co-worker got the pork chop that was a good portion size and looked mouth-watering with an interesting and tasty looking garnish top. 


Might not be a place I would come normally, considering the price range, but definitely a nice place for an intimate celebration or when someone else is paying!"

Just 2 IPAs on tap and 1 in a bottle /: 
Small list of signature cocktails, too

We ordered drinks and apps for dinner:

Goat cheese bruschetta- best app. Tons of goat cheese, fresh tomatoes (even in February), nice flavor, good crunchy toast

Tuna tartar- a train wreck. It looks like it was burnt in an accident. Good flavor although it&#39;s surrounded by ginger... Was I supposed to eat the ginger? Idk but I did and it was not awesome. The crunchy pita it came with also became soggy by the totally unnecessary sauce on the bottom of the plate. A real dud. 

Mini lobster rolls- nice. Solid. Nothing crazy amazing but not bad and in fact pretty good.   There was plenty of lobster, good flavor. The fluffy bun was warm and buttery.

Spicy tuna sushi roll- really good! A home run here. I eat a lot of sushi and this was pretty solid. I would get this again.

I had 6 east coast dollar oysters. They were prepared perfectly. Lots of juice and sliced off the shell. Good job!!! I really appreciate that! Lemon and on ice. Amazing work. The cocktail sauce was lacking a little more horse radish but no biggie. 

Ambience: very nice.
Service: hostesses were good and got us seated quickly at a nice table.

Server was pretty quick but I do want to note that the menus (there were many) were abandoned at our table and that&#39;s fine but when the food came there was minimal space for them.  When you give a table of 2 about 5 different menus and 4 different apps at once it gets a little crazy.

Also, I loved the biscuit and butler with maple syrup BUT why did the busers leave the empty tray?? 3 came and saw the table getting cluttered but didn&#39;t offer to take take it.

There are some points that can make this place better. Idk why the ratings are so high.... Oak brook tends to disappoint me lately, especially when compared to chicago."

The wine list is well above average, not just the same garden variety labels marked up 50% from what you can buy at Da Jool.  A wide range of price points, too.  I had the lobster cobb salad, and my husband had the seared ahi tuna. Both perfectly prepared. We then helped ourselves to the lobster mac &amp; cheese, which was divine.

I remember when this place was originally called Braxton&#39;s Seafood Grille in Oakbrook, IL next to Crate and Barrel in Oakbrook Mall. They&#39;ve obviously moved since then, and are now located (and renamed) to Devon&#39;s Seafood Grille. When I had dined with them when they were known as Braxton&#39;s it was many years back, I would say 6-8 years back. And I absolutely LOVED the food and quality back then. So i naturally (or not so naturally) I was a little hesitant to try them again many years later. Firstly because I was apprehensive that the quality had remained the same, and secondly because I&#39;ve had experiences in the past where I neglect trying a restaurant I had a wonderful experience at for some time, and when I finally go back, I&#39;ve built up the memory of my previous excellent experience so much, that when I finally try it it falls exceptionally short of my expectations. 

Not this time however. This time it still hit all the marks plus more. 

Ambience: The outside is deceptive. It looks small and not that impressive. But like I said, I knew better because I ate with them in years prior. When I finally went inside I was exceptionally impressed. Modern, sleek, and dare I say sexy? Walnut cherry wood decor, tables and walls, ambient lighting with candle lit tables. This is definitely a date or special occasion place to take that special someone to, especially if you don&#39;t want to fight traffic by going downtown. Tables are not crammed together, but not far away from the next table. The type of clientele this place attracts would be your younger, but still professionally trendy crowd. I would say the 25-45 age group.

Food: The best part of course. 

Appetizers: We got three. 1) Goat cheese bruschetta: Excellent presentation, the tomatoes were sweet and the goat cheese itself was divine! 2) Tuna Tartare: excellent. I was definitely a fan of tropical twist of the pineapple and cilantro implementation. The use of tortilla chips with the tropical spin on the tartare harmonized the textures nicely. 3) Oysters: we got 2 of the Bluepoint, 2 of the Wellfleet. Bluepoint was mild, slightly briny, and the Wellfleet, was slightly briny as well, but not as much as the Bluepoint, and had a sweet finish. Both were absolutely excellent. 

Entrees: Two dishes. One for me and my husband 1) Mine: I&#39;m a big seafood fan so I went straight for the Seafood Mixed Grill. Definitely not the cheapest entree by any means, but definitely the most hearty, and the biggest bang for your buck. In fact, looking back, I could have most likely shared this dish with someone else with a couple of appetizers. Perfectly charred scallops and jumbo shrimp. Perfectly done salmon that was not over done, still had the right amount of moisture. The lump crab had fresh crab meat that was clearly fresh because of the inherent, almost phantom sweetness that comes from insanely fresh sea fare. Asparagus was decent. Nothing too out of the ordinary. I opted for their smoked paprika fries instead of the yukon whipped potatoes. They made a mistake and got me regular fries and the waiter did seem a little flummoxed and confused, but the kitchen knew what was going on and they got me a new fresh order of the smoked paprika fries gratis. It did take a while though, so based off our waiters other mannerisms I am certain our waiter that night was new and was just exceptionally confused as he was still learning the ropes. 2) Husband got the surf and turf 6oz center cut+4 jumbo seared scallops. He said the steak was decent, nothing to special. But in my experience a restaurant can either be a really good seafood restaurant, or a really good steakhouse-- not both. This was one of those times. (If anyone knows of a place that is both please message me haha). 

Side Dishes: Two dishes 1) Lobster mac and cheese: it was okay. Not too special. If anyone is looking for a good lobster mac and cheese Del Frisco&#39;s downtown still holds the trophy in my opinion. 2) Smoked paprika fries: pretty good, the cajun mayonnaise was decent. Fries were fresh, not soggy, so it had the ideal crispness on the outside and softness on the inside. But overall neither side dishes are something I would come back solely for.

Dessert: Carrot cake. RIDICULOUSLY HUGE. Oh my god. Clearly if you got this far into my review you know we already ate a lot, but this was HUGE. I give the cake a 6-7/10. Not to special, but not too bad. Cake was slightly too dense given the frosting to cake ratio. 

TL;DR: 4.2/5. Points off for confused waiter and only center cut not hitting all the marks. Go straight for the mixed seafood grill, don&#39;t get steak here, go to a steakhouse for that. Appetizers were phenomenal and the oysters were on point (Bluepoint to be exact haha!). Skip the lobster mac and cheese. Our waiter was relatively new and seemed a bit confused with a tiny hiccup in our order but the kitchen handled it."

We had never been to the restaurant before. First, the parking lot is terrible!  I have a small sports car and found it difficult to park. The spaces and rows are not wide at all. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and the noise level is minimal. Upon arriving, the hostess wished us a happy anniversary which was very nice for them to acknowledge the reservation was for a special night. Our waiter, Shane, also wished us the same. Shane was very friendly and provided wonderful and attentive service. We started with some wine and shared the prosciutto &amp; gorgonzola flatbread. It was a thin crispy flatbread very flavorful with the cheese, salty meat and fig sauce. Very good. Shane brought us two cheddar peppercorn biscuits, which were amazing. They had a little card on the breadboard with the recipe to make at home. For dinner, my husband had the walleye and chose the asparagus and creamed corn with bacon shareable side dish.  His walleye was cooked over mesquite perfectly, moist and flaky. The creamed corn was full of smokey goodness with the bacon. So good.  I had the 6oz filet &amp; seared scallops with side dishes of heirloom tomatoes and lemongrass asparagus risotto. Everything was very good!  We ordered a key lime pie to share for dessert to end our meal. When Shane brought our check, the key lime pie was complimentary for our anniversary. Such a nice surprise!

I was extremely pleased by their service and the food was even better! I ate the Char-grilled Ahi and it was the best Ahi tuna I have ever had in my life. It was cooked and seasoned to perfection and it came with potatoes, asparagus, and a delish sauce.

I am only in town for a week for work, but I will be back before I have to leave.

I honestly have to stop myself from eating here everyday. EVERY. DAY. Mostly due to the price. But it was worth every penny."

After trying for a table at a couple places near the mall and cringing at the idea of an hour wait, my companion and I drove around and came across Devon. Mutually agreeing upon seafood, we decided that we would wait no matter how long. 

Amazingly, the hostess said it was a mere 15 minutes, but then seconds later we were being spirited to a table. The place was busy yet not noisy, with a dim atmosphere, each table spotlighted with a lamp directly above it. 

The menu holds many intriguing items, but we chose quickly. My companion opted for the maple-grilled salmon, which actually came on a round of wood (as advertised). 

I cobbled together my meal from items on the appetizer menu: a bowl of mussels in lemon and white wine (excellent!) and shrimp scampi (a different approach than usual: a richer sauce, not just melted garlic butter, but quite delicious). 

We had to restrain ourselves from outright gobbling down the signature bread: cheddar peppercorn biscuits with a surprisingly harmonious maple butter. 

Dessert was good but not especially memorable: key lime pie was an actual small pie (nice when two people were sharing :p), but the &#34;marascino-pineapple relish&#34; appeared to be straight-up fruit cocktail, and the mango sorbet was too astringent. The pie would have been fine solo. 

Our server, Mark, was smooth and professional. 

Overall, quite a great dining experience for the seafood lover. Devon is divine; I&#39;ll be back!"

Food was great, there are no doubts about food. Everything was delicious and fresh. They have good champagne. We didn&#39;t know which one we should take but the waitress gave us very good recommendations. 
I really liked their seafood, especially scallops. Steak was not bad, but not the best I&#39;ve ever tried. Strawberry and pistachio salad was good. For the dessert I had lava cake and it was great, I loved it. 
Why I didn&#39;t give them 5 stars? Sure, I will explain. We have seen pictures of their terrace on the website and first we booked a terrace table. But when we came and saw that small terrace near the road and parking, we were disappointed. The pictures are lying. So we&#39;ve got table inside. It was really noisy there, TOO much noise, like in some busy McDonald&#39;s. Also their chairs for children are awful, too small and inconvenient. Your kid will be there like in a small prison and he will not like it, for sure. We didn&#39;t like the atmosphere there, we felt like we&#39;re at some noisy street, there is no privacy at all. Waitress was professional, but I haven&#39;t seen at least the slightest smile on her face. She was not friendly, she just did her job. Also we didn&#39;t have any salt and pepper shakers on our tables, so we had to ask her to bring them. When we ordered tea, nobody even asked what kind of tea, they just brought us black tea. But what if somebody wanted green or fruit tea? That was strange for me. I thought they should give some choice. 
Nevertheless, I can say this place is worth visiting because of their seafood, at least."

During lunch time on a weekday, they weren&#39;t very busy at all, which can be nice if you need to get out of the office for some peace and quiet!

I met Courtney C. here for lunch, who was (luckily) having a slow day at the office.  We both ordered from the Power Lunch menu.  I had the Lobster Bisque and the Crab Melt.  Both were delicious!  The crab melt was served on a buttery toast, which was a little bit greasy, but the half sandwich with my soup was a very filling lunch.

They also served us complimentary biscuits.  Mmm, carbs!

We showed our waiter the check-in deal on the Yelp app for a free fried calamari appetizer.  He looked confused and told us he would have to check with the manager.  This didn&#39;t surprise me, since any time I&#39;ve had a Yelp check-in deal, the staff seem to know nothing about it!  So our waiter went to (presumably) check with his manager.

We then were served our soup, no calamari yet.  Once they brought out our entrees, I told the waiter we were still waiting for our calamari.  I was totally nice about this, but his face contorted and he said, &#34;Oh.  I didn&#39;t know you ordered that.&#34;  He had quite a chip on his shoulder.  I said, &#34;yes, that was the Yelp check-in deal we showed you.&#34;  At that point, it was awkward.  The expression on his face was nothing less than pissed off.  He just said, &#34;oh.  OK,&#34; and began to walk away.  THEN he stepped back to our table (entrees in front of us), and said, &#34;Did you still even want it?&#34;

WTF.

Clearly, not all service at DS&amp;S is this bad.  We noticed another table of ladies had the nicest, most attentive server.  He ran through the specials, answered their questions about the menu, recommended various things.  So it appears we just got the dud.  I didn&#39;t ask to speak with a manager, since my gut instinct said that this kid was just having a BAD day.

The food is great, but we just had an awkward experience with the service."

Our entrees were the Bone-in Ribeye and the 1/2 lb Lobster tail. The ribeye was nothing special. I feel my boyfriend could have gotten a better steak for less money at any of the other upscale places around town. Also, my lobster tail was really disappointing. It tasted similar to Red Lobster&#39;s quality.....no joke. The service was good until it came time to fetch the bill. We thought the waitress forgot about us. The ambiance is great, but we don&#39;t go out to eat for ambiance, we go for a great meal! So we had tried the place and came to this conclusion, and we decided we would not be back unless it was free or heavily discounted lol.
  Then I received a B-day coupon for $25 off and an Email advertising Halibut was in season and now on their menu! Plus they had half off wine bottles on Sundays, so I said what-the-heck, let&#39;s give it a second chance (since we had all these great offers and I have been waiting for Halibut to be back in season for like a year!).
  We went back on a Sunday around 7pm. We asked them as we sat down at the table if they had Halibut, just to be sure, and they said &#34;Yes we just put it back on the menu&#34; and I explained I came special for the Halibut and I have my heart set on it. There was nothing else on the menu I wanted since the lobster was obviously sub-par. Later when it came time to order, I said I would like the Halibut and I thought the girl was literally joking when she said they were out of the Halibut! Really? At 7 on the weekend? We were so disappointed we just got up and left. It may seem picky, but two strikes directly in a row and you are out!  So we went down the road to McCormick &amp; Schmick&#39;s who did have Halibut.

Devon&#39;s food is over-rated in my opinion. If you are looking for delicious seafood, try the Reel Club or even Ditka&#39;s instead. For amazing steaks, Gibsons, Or for overall great value try J Alexanders. Because Devon did not offer any of these."

I usually skip anything with the words &#34;seafood&#34; or &#34;steak&#34; in the name because I&#39;m too cheap for that fancy stuff. The power lunch at Devon was $18.50 and I had leftovers for dinner, so it was super affordable! 

I went with the Lobster Bisque and the Blackened Chicken pasta. The bisque was the best that I&#39;ve tried in a LONG time. I could have ordered another one (but then that would have thrown that whole &#34;affordable&#34; aspect out.) It was piping hot and the flavor, as well as presentation, were so fancy that it made me feel like I&#39;d finally made something of my life. I&#39;m not normally one to order chicken at a seafood restaurant, but the promise of leeks and mushrooms atop a pile of carbs screamed my name. This was one of the best things I&#39;ve tried in ages and the serving was huge. Like I said before, I had enough to bring back to the office. 

Our server was the least personable of all the servers there. We saw a lady and another gentleman and they were both very talkative and knowledgeable about the menu. Not sure if our guy was new or not, but he didn&#39;t explain anything to us. He just asked us what we wanted to order.

Also, don&#39;t really expect the Yelp check-in offer. We asked and ended up never getting it. It wasn&#39;t enough to deter me from coming back though. I&#39;ll be back for another power lunch again soon."

Our server wasn&#39;t much help in picking a wine and after we did be brought it with only two glasses for my mother and I. We didn&#39;t see him again for another 10 min and my father had to flag him down to order a drink. 

Everything else was fine aside from my plate of food came out a few min before my parents and it was missing a crab cake.  Someone with long hair that was almost touching the plate (a manager?) brought it out before I got to ask my waiter about it but I still feel like this shouldn&#39;t happen at a place that is $200+ for three people. 

Our waiter kept running off as though he was extremely busy but the place wasn&#39;t packed and I saw other servers on the floor so I&#39;m not sure what that was about. 

Not sure if we will be back."

Four different types of oysters were offered and they were excellent. I ordered the surf and turf with scallops, a six oz fillet and risotto. The seafood was superb as was the service offered by Brittany and the supporting staff. The steaks were perhaps a bit under seasoned for being served without sauce but, all told, a solid surf and turf. I highly recommend Devon&#39;s side room for your special events."

Twice now I have checked the online menu and confirmed that they had it listed, but arrived at the restaurant to find none. This last time, the manager told me they had stopped serving it because &#39;the lobsters kept dying&#39;, an appetizing thought. This is their right, of course, but then they shouldn&#39;t have it listed on their online menu for $22. I consider this &#39;bait and switch&#39;, and we walked out.

We were so excited to have dinner at Devon.  They tout all fresh seafood, never frozen and their menu looked amazing.  That is where it all ended.  We started by ordering 2 appetizers the mini lobster roll and the tuna tartare.

The Lobster roll was mostly chopped celery, corn?, and under dressed in some type of sauce we weren&#39;t sure what was exactly in it.  The lobster was completely over powered by these flavors and over cooked.  If you are unsure what a lobster roll is suppose to be I suggest you travel a few miles west and go to Parkers they do a traditional lobster roll that will make you think you are on the East Coast.

The Tuna Tartare was saturated in soy and some type of chili sauce that you couldn&#39;t taste the tuna, again the flavor of the tuna  was completely over powered, although it was sliced nicely.  But the bed of thickly sliced cucumbers were difficult to eat along with the tuna in one bit if that was the chefs intention.  If you would like a flavorful tuna tartare I suggest you go a bit east and to to Perry&#39;s there tuna is fresh, light and you taste tuna.

At this point we were thoroughly disappointed but I also can appreciate a chef trying a new twist on a traditional dish so we ordered a 3rd appetizer since we barely ate what we had.  We ordered the shrimp ceviche with sweet potato, black beans, cilantro.  This sounded great and there is so many ways to do a good ceviche we were optimistic.  Unfortunately again the dish was overpowered by some type of catsup based sauce that completely hid any of the flavors of the fish.  

At this point we did not want to try another thing.  The point of fresh fish is just that being able to taste the fish along with other clean light flavors that highlights the texture and flavors.  So we paid the check, and left.  

I know that many people have written many nice reviews about the entrees but at this point we have had 3 awful dishes and there are too many restaurants in this area to stick around and hope for the next dish to be better.  So we left, went to Perry&#39;s in Oakbrook and have a fantastic dinner."

Well with the exception of the Down Town Chicago location, which by the way was the original location. 

The staff there are not like the staff out in the suburbs. Anyways just wanted to share that. This being our first time here in this location I gotta say that I love it! It&#39;s so cute and fun inside with the decor.

I love the picket blue fence that are up between each booth. It&#39;s minimal but I love the homey feel is awesome. There is also an area of about five tables and its surrounded by artificial brick wall (which reminds me of a backyard feel BArbeque kind of way) and there is also an area with large Rick formation around the wall to the floor that I found quite unique from other locations.

The staff was on point, fast friendly and quick with our food. The only thing I was not happy with was the AMOUNT OF MEAT ON MY BIG BEEF SANDWICH. But it was just as delicious as any other time! 

I wish they had this back home in Texas, but now that I live here I am so glad I find it quite a treat. The fee h fries are always nice and tasty. 

We could not go home without a taste of their delicious moist chocolate cake! Soooooo mighty good! Thank you Mr. Portillo for founding such a unique and amazing restaurant! On behalf of all Midwest thank you."

In this case, the latter takes a bow.

Everything about Portillo&#39;s Italian Beef is good: moist, tasty beef, a bun worthy of the beef it holds and your choice of peppers, sweet or hot.  It&#39;s yummy.

Then there is desert.  For years, Portillo&#39;s proudly produced a chocolate cake for which the masses clamored.  The recipe for that cake can still be found on the net with one odd ingredient.  Then they outdid themselves.  They unveiled the chocolate eclair cake.  This is a work of devil foodish perfection.  If the best Tiramisu you ever had could be a chocolate cake...voila! You have it.

No matter how busy they get the service is always friendly and fast, whether it&#39;s dining in or popping through the drive-thru. 

I&#39;m also a super fan of Barnelli&#39;s Pasta Bowl, so gotta love that this location is a combo with my ultimate Portillo&#39;s favorites. 

My go-to items are as follows...

Chopped Salad (Barnelli&#39;s): Absolutely amazing. Get the dressing on the side. This salad is big enough to split for sure! It also comes with a poppy seed muffin :)

Friend fries: Always. My fave fries ever. Perfect texture - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Ketchup cups galore.

Hot dog: With everything on it. You&#39;re not a Chicagoin if you don&#39;t like a Portillo&#39;s hot dog.

Cheeseburger: With everything on it. I have not figured out what it is about these damn burgers, but they&#39;re amaze. They aren&#39;t the thickest, juiciest burgers I&#39;ve had, but they have me comin&#39; back for more. Maybe it&#39;s the poppy-seed bun? 

Chocolate cake shake: Heaven in a cup. I of course am obsessed with the chocolate cake itself, but if you can add in some extras and drink it on the go - why not? This is literally the best dessert ever. Mind you, it&#39;s probably about 1,000+ cals, so maybe don&#39;t indulge in one of these bad boys too often."

Portillo&#39;s was recently sold after Dick Portillo ran the company with an iron fist for several decades. I think I miss that part. 

I am also disappointed by the lack of nutritional information anywhere. We all know that it is calorie rich. Just show us the truth.

Also, I ordered a chopped salad with extra bacon (minus cheese and onion) and was charged a whopping $1. That&#39;s a bit ridiculous."

Definitely authentic Chicago style fast food haha. Soooo juicy.  The chicken sandwich is another choice who wants a little less calories al well as good taste. In addition, lI would prefer if they have other options than regular buns, since these carbs make me dizzy during afternoon work

Another recommendation is the ONION RING, which is worth every bite. I am pretty particular about fried food, but these deep fried and crispy onion ring does not have any oily taste.

However, to be fair, ribs are covered with over sweetened bbq source. Salads are overpriced and not fresh with limited topping choices. 

So just get in and order anything supposed to make you fat and fully satisfied;)"

I don&#39;t really like the Chicago style hot dog but their Italian beef are BOMB! I always get it with the sauce on the sauce so I can dip as I eat and prevents the sandwich from getting soggy.

If I were able to give ZERO stars I would.  I am also going to be fair and balance this out with an excellent review..BUT NOT for this establishment!  

Here it goes (it&#39;s long but necessary): I work for a company that is very well versed in customer service,  my job is to service observe (audit) customer service representative calls. With that being said, I do my best to be as fair a possible, without being subjective when  critiquing anything or anyone for that matter.

The department I work for decided it would be a great idea to order from this particular location. Given that  we order just about every Friday from various restaurants, and there were about 13 people ordering, the courteous thing to do would be to call in our order in advance, right?  Umm.... not so much! 

After collecting everyone&#39;s orders I decide to call it in Thursday evening for Friday pick up. Well, apparently when I called them at about 4:45 or so, the young lady (who did not appear to sound too enthusiastic) proceeds to advise that I would be better off calling &#34;at breakfast time&#34; since she was afraid they will lose our order! When I ask what would be a convenient time to call to ensure my order will be ready for pick up before noon,  she again states &#34;at breakfast time&#34;. The young lady proceeds to ask if I can hold so she can get a pen and paper (which I am thinking she will take my order); asks for my name and number and what time I would like to pick it up. So now I am thinking this is not good, so you can take my info down and not my order? I give her my information and tell her I will call Friday morning.

Fast forward to Friday morning... I decide that breakfast time would be about 8:30 or so, since again I wanted to provide ample time for them to have our order ready. This time a different young lady answers mumbling something incoherent,  I explain that I called the day prior and would like to place a large order in advance.  The young woman asks me to hold, which resulted in an approximate hold of over 11 minutes!  During this waiting period I can hear a conversation between a few employees, which consisted of nonsense and whatnot. At this point it occurs that my well over $100 order is not needed at this place of business. Unfortunately they lost what may have been a consistent biweekly large order. 

I then call corporate waited about another 5 minutes to get to someone,  explained what transpired was promised a call back. This did happen but unfortunately all of the apologies in the world will not sway me to order from this particular establishment. The best the &#34;manager&#34; can do is offer a discount?!?! 
I think maybe a few free meals and we would reciprocate with being a constant customer. Not too savy if you want business a customer should not have to jump through hoops to give them money! 

This place has proven that it does not handle large orders appropriately. 

So, now on to my positive feedback:
After being inconvenienced and having to collect new orders... Portillos in Naperville to the rescue.. knows how to effectively and efficiently run a business as is evident by their loyal customer base. They accommodated my last minute order of 20 (notice how the order grew). They are true upperclassmen when it comes to the food/restaurant industry.  Not only did they take my large order,  they did so accurately and with less than an hours notice!  They also offered to bag and add names to each employees order!  They exceeded my expectations of how a business should operate! 

Hardee&#39;s of Warrenville,  take note of how things should be run,  maybe, just maybe, one day you will have the same loyal fan base. 

Sorry it&#39;s not our group!"

The same logic applies to Portillo&#39;s Hot Dogs.  Portillo&#39;s sets out to provide tasty fast food at reasonable prices, and it achieves that goal with flying colors.  Will eating a roast beef and cheddar sandwich on a croissant damage your heart?  It might.  When I consume a delicious Maxwell Street Polish, am I increasing my risk of a stroke?  Yes I am.  Will the chocolate cake shake make it more likely that I will contract Type 2 diabetes and die without a full set of toes?  You betcha!  But that&#39;s hardly the point.  Portillo&#39;s never claimed to be health food.  Accept this establishment for what it is, and enjoy at your own risk."

But I fail to understand the hype. Chicken sandwiches are dry, stale, and flavorless.  Italian beef is bland without much flavor (Buona Beef&#39;s Italian beef is much better, in my opinion). I think their pasta dishes are 10x better than the other stuff.  But not all of their locations have the pasta.

Took one of my friends here recently from out of town since she wanted to know what all the hype was about. She had an Italian Beef sandwich and said it was really bland (I agree).

Also, my husband and I were here tonight and they were so incredibly slow with our order. The place was more than half empty inside, and we waited 20 minutes for my Chicken Siciliano dish. There was no long line of customers inside. My husband got his meal in 5 minutes, and it got cold while we waited for my darn pasta. Not thrilled with this place and our service tonight. Worst service I&#39;ve ever had here. I won&#39;t be coming back for a long time. 

Lastly, they also cater more to the lazy drive thru customers.  There&#39;s always a line of 20+ cars in the drive thru and they get their food much faster than the people who actually get out of their car and walk inside to place their order."

This in fact implies that everything does indeed come with it! When we got a receipt comma I noticed that she was charged extra for what she had ordered. We went back, and the girl, who look like she was in high school, just stared at us after we asked about this matter. She then rolled her eyes and got her manager who came over, and my wife explain to him the situation. He didn&#39;t even know about the issue, or the menu! My wife asked what comes with the sandwich, and he said the same thing she did, and also stated that it is not a charge. When we looked up at the menu, there indeed wasn&#39;t that an upcharge. That is why my wife ask what comes with it with no extra charge. Instead of saying everything, you should Clearly say these all comes with it for free, and these are what includes an upcharge. Clearly, even the manager, who doesn&#39;t know the menu, how would he be able to train the staff. Just very unprofessional.

Step over to the Barnelli&#39;s side of the line and order a Peasant Pasta.  What? You&#39;ve never heard of such a thing?  EXACTLY!  This dish is probably the best item on the entire menu, but most people didn&#39;t even know it exists!  Peasant pasta is a throwback to an old Italian dish where a little bit of everything is mixed together.  It is loaded with chicken, Italian sausage, and bacon over rigatoni noodles and a flavorful sauce.  The sauce is velvety smooth and flavored with chicken broth, butter, and cannellini beans.  They finish the dish with steamed escarole, fresh parsley, and little parmesan cheese.

If you don&#39;t, well, I&#39;m sorry for you. Portillo&#39;s is absolutely amazing! They have the best service and food ever!

I have been to Portillo&#39;s many times, but one time, my grade went to Portillo&#39;s after a field trip. Since there were a lot of people, Portillo&#39;s had servers go down the line of people waiting to put in their orders and took their orders in line and gave them a ticket. By the time you got to the register, you just handed the ticket, paid, and waited for your food. This made it go so much faster and instead of waiting in line forever. This is also the same at the drive thru. The drive thru normally has tons of cars lined around the building. They do the same thing and go to each car and place a ticket on the windshield and your order gets to you much faster. Although, if this is your first time, do not go through the drive thru. You will most likely already have your food by the time you reach where the menu is, so if you are new, go inside the restaurant.

The food is so unbelievable too. I usually get the jumbo chili cheese dog which has a hardy hot dog covered in warm, savory chili. Their fries are always cooked to perfection and are always warm by the time you sit down. Barnelli&#39;s, which is a salad and pasta place within Portillo&#39;s has delicious food. Their salads are fresh with a wide array of ingredients. Portillo&#39;s also has yummy shakes which aren&#39;t too thick that it can&#39;t be sucked through a straw, but aren&#39;t watery; they&#39;re perfect. I always get the chocolate shake which has a creamy texture with a sweet, chocolaty flavor. Their sizes for shakes are small and large, but my recommendation is to not get the large because it is ginormous.

Portillo&#39;s has such a friendly and fun atmosphere and it feels like you know everyone there. The décor has fun objects from old license plates to suspended motorcycles. It is a great deal too because a meal including fries and shakes for a family of four was under $27. Portillo&#39;s is for any kind of palate, and will make you smile every time."

You can&#39;t even get in the parking lot, the long line of cars in drive thru block your way in. Had to park two stores down at old navy. No one directing people to barbell is or Portillos line so people had to keep switching. I ordered a hot dog, fries and Coke and cashier was charging me $15. What! Then had to wait about 7 min for a manager to swipe his badge. The fries were solid as rock, over cooked, and they messed up my order on top of that. Going to jimmys down street. Cheaper and less crowded. Totally lost the concept of guest service."

The food is really good even though some things have changed since new ownership bought out the restaurant group. I went there this past Friday and waited close to 15 minutes for 2 burgers, a fry and onion rings and they weren&#39;t that busy. Normally when the person calling out numbers sees someone there for a long time they ask what your number is and will actually help locate your order on the line to help move it along. Not this time. Not even a shift supervisor rolled past the window and when that would happen they would apologize and offer you a piece of their chocolate cake. Be aware that any time they mess up that is there go to offering to make up for their mishap. Can&#39;t tell you how many times I have had that offered to me and I found out about this practice from an employee that works at another location. 
But if you are in the mood for a good burger, beef, hot dog, fries, onion rings or even the chicken sandwiches. Stop by Portillo&#39;s and come before the rush. I have seen really long lines at this location for many hours."

They were yelling and screaming whatever they felt like at each other and rough housing around all the cars.  Not very professional, but we told ourselves whatever.  So when we ordered we had to correct the kid twice when calling in our order but figured with the corrections everything would be good... Nope.  We got home and found out there was an issue with every piece of our order.  First, they forgot (and still charged us for) our cheese cups for our cheese fries, then also forgot the pickles we specifically requested on our hotdogs.  Secondly but probably the worst, I took a bite out of my chili cheese dog and bit into what was probably the longest hair I&#39;ve ever seen.  Totally gross.  We&#39;ve never had an issue at other locations but this time was enough to make me never go back to this one.  So upon calling the manager of the place, she seemed to not really care about what happened saying she&#39;s &#34;never heard of any of that happening&#34; and told me she&#39;s forwarding everything off to customer service anyway.

They&#39;ve got a pretty good variety of food, so even if you&#39;re not in the mood for what you usually get here, chances are you&#39;ll find something you like, and you might even end up discovering a new favorite.  They have awesome hotdogs and really good burgers (they&#39;re well-done, but the meat is never tough or dry), they&#39;re not my favorite Italian beef place, but they lure my grandmother all the way out from Texas--she has to eat here (she&#39;s also specific about the location) almost every day while she&#39;s visiting.  They have really good, crispy fries and onion rings, AND if you&#39;re eating in, you can wash it all down with a beer--which is awesome.  The pastas and sandwiches on the Barnelli&#39;s side are also pretty good (or at least better than average), although I have to say I really love the salad that comes with fruit and some kind of poppy-seed dressing.  They offer a really moist &#39;chocolate&#39; cake that really doesn&#39;t pack anywheres near as much chocolate as it looks like it does, but it is pretty good and--as I&#39;ve already mentioned--very moist, so, though it will satisfy my sweet tooth, it won&#39;t satisfy me if I&#39;m craving chocolate.

If you&#39;re looking for something fast, but you don&#39;t like fast food, than you&#39;ve found the place--the drive through and the job they do there are incredible.  The prices are great, again considering that the food is of much better quality than that of fast food chains, which makes this place ideal for dine-in or carry-out depending on your time-restraints or moods."

Their salad dressing containers are now only one ounce vs. one and a half a while back.  Containers for their blue cheese are also smaller.  First they downsize on the bread offering a quarter instead of a half, now they downsize both the salad dressing and the blue cheese containers.  Even though I ordered extra dressing &#34;to go&#34; we could barely taste the two smaller containers on the salad when we got home.  This makes no sense especially with all the customers they get on a daily basis.  I guess the new holding company thinks we silly customers will not notice.  WRONG!  Say it ain&#39;t so Joe!!!"

I like rewards :) It worked and I haven&#39;t bitten a doctor since...

Last night, I had to have my first ever tooth filling.  I called my mom to tell her I&#39;d been brave.  I didn&#39;t even have them numb the area where they were drilling around to clean and fill.  She said she thought I could have a reward! I agreed.  

The dentist said I could eat whatever I wanted...hot or cold! SO I picked a Portillos Italian Beef with sweet peppers and small fries and an ice cold Sprite...It was a reward that rivaled a Barbie!

The wait wasn&#39;t bad at 12:00 p.m. inside, but by the time I left the line was nearly at the door.  The drive-thru lanes are just as bad.  They really should open up another Naperville location, maybe closer to 95th or 111th Streets to alleviate some of the rush.  The employees do everything they can to keep the lines moving, but I&#39;d recommend going just before noon, or waiting until after 1:00 p.m.

The food here is just as good as any other Portillo&#39;s, and there&#39;s a lot of seating.  My onion rings were disappointing this time though, the onions don&#39;t stick to the batter and I ended up with some onion strings and empty &#34;casings&#34; of fried breading that I had to eat separately.  I order my italian beef &#34;dry&#34; at this location, since they tend to soak it in gravy and the bread falls apart.  Just isn&#39;t my thing.

I prefer to drive through rather than go inside (especially around lunch time, holy cow!), which is easy here because this location has two drive-through lanes, and a handful of workers going down the line taking orders and completing transactions. At another restaurant, a long line like that could take forever, but Portillo&#39;s really knows how to get people in and out quickly. And they&#39;ve never, ever gotten my order wrong.

It has a country western theme but otherwise is similar to the other locations I&#39;ve visited.

I&#39;ve never been to Portillo&#39;s when it wasn&#39;t busy. It is bustling and tends to feel a bit chaotic to me. There is a lot of seating but the tables are really close together. It&#39;s usually pretty loud, which is fine for a quick lunch but probably not the place to sit and catch up with a friend.

The staff are VERY friendly, courteous and every single one had a great smile. Very nice service. They are very efficient with a lot of staff that seem hard working- they take your order ahead of time in the drivethrough and at busy times inside of the restaurant to save time.

The fries are the best anywhere- hot, fresh, perfect amount of salt, crinkle cut- delicious! I ordered a hamburger with just lettuce, tomato and pickle (I love how their pickles are thick-cut) but ended up with a hamburger with everything on it- they took it back and made a new one for me and said &#34;sorry about that&#34;. The burgers tast char-grilled to me. 

My husband loves their Italian sausage sandwich.

I often grab a to-go menu right when I get there so I can read up close the ingredients and description of the menu items so that when I get through the line I&#39;m all ready to go. The line goes pretty fast and it feels like you need to be ready quickly. 

I think the salads are fantastic! I also really like the warm lemon poppyseed muffin that comes with all of the salads. My favorite salad is the chopped salad- I order it a little bit different (no cheese, no onion, light on the dressing, add croutons) and it is so delicious! The chicken pecan salad is also tasty- it has a unique WARM honey mustard dressing which adds great flavor.

I was here on a Saturday afternoon and there were straw wrappers and food all over the floor because it was so busy, but several people were cleaning and sweeping the restaurant so got it all before I was done with my quick meal."

Frankly, I didn&#39;t get the hype. (I said so on Yelp, but my review seems to have vanished...???)

Part of it may be that I don&#39;t like hot dogs, which is a major item around which their menu is built. The last time I went, I had a burger and root beer, which were serviceable but not worth waiting in a line wrapped around the building, like there is at any given time.

My boyfriend, however, has lived here a good chunk of his life and has dedicated himself to trying to convert me to the Portillo&#39;s mentality. We went last night for dinner. He suggested the grilled chicken sandwich (I got it on a croissant); my eye was also caught by the pina colada smoothie. 

I&#39;m still saying &#34;ehh&#34;. The breakdown: 
- the grilled chicken was clearly fresh, but a bit over the top on saltiness. The fact that it was so hot and juicy also made the croissant a bit mushy; a harder roll would have been better, actually. 
- fries were awesome. crinkly (but not like Ore-Ida) with a extra-crunchy exterior, they satisfied a salt craving that I&#39;d had all day. 
- the smoothie was a bit too sugary for me; if they&#39;d dialed back the sweetness a bit this would have been perfect. 

As to the restaurant itself, the theme was for some reason &#34;Old West/Gold Rush&#34; (or something like that). This meant (I&#39;m not sure why) that modern country music had to play incessantly (my boyfriend said this is always the case); maybe that&#39;s why so many people choose the drive-thru? (heh) There was a lot of seating space (not only lots of tables to choose from on this occasion, but just a lot of tables in general.)
Overall, between the music, signs, and several counters for ordering/picking up different things, it seemed like a lot of confusion to me.

I will point out that the staff was very polite; everyone we crossed paths with, even for a second, was upbeat and kind. Big gold star for them. 

I still am not a complete convert, but I&#39;m told that their chocolate cake is to die for and I still have to try the Italian beef, so I&#39;ll give them another shot. Maybe someday you&#39;ll see me in that line of cars outside."

Prices are low, food is ALWAYS good ( been coming here for 20 years.. ). Service is wicked fast.. even when the drive thru is packed, its still lightning quick. 

Fries = Awesome

I have been trying to eat more healthy so this is a special occasion for me but the beef is only about 500 calories, so not bad.. Fat is about 27 grams which is a bit high but it packs almost 50g of protein.. so worth it for lunch from time to time.

And they serve BEER!!! AND its reasonably priced!!

Im very glad I did!  The Chicago style hot dog was very good, the best Chicago style dog I&#39;ve ever had.  I enjoy the pickle wedge on top of the hot dog instead of the green relish other Chicago hot dog stands use.  The chef salad with house dressing was also very good, which I find out was just as popular as their dogs!  Another plus: even though the house was packed, and is every time I go in, the service is quick and I don&#39;t have to wait long inside or in the drive thru."

The sandwich itself is pretty good and can be bland if you don&#39;t add the sweet peppers because the beef is not seasoned.  I find the sandwich to be much better when they don&#39;t dip the sandwich in the gravy due to the reason I always get my food to go. The one time I had the sandwich dipped and made it back to my relatives house to consume it, the bread was sloppy soggy. So I would recommend having it dipped in the gravy if you are dining in.

The place works much like a subway, but instead of a sub you are making a pizza. You have a choice of crust, sauce and topping. 

Once you pick all your choices they stick in the wood fire grill and within 5 minutes it is cooked.

You also can&#39;t beat the price as the lunch special is $7.99 for a pie. Regular pricing is around $10 but if you do a check in through Yelp they take $5 off. 

The pizza itself is delicious and the ingredients are fresh. So I had no issues with the taste. 

I went in for Lunch on Monday and the place had plenty of seating and no line. The staff was very quick to serve. So I have no issues with the facility.

The only reason I don&#39;t give this place five stars is because I have tasted much better pizza elsewhere. These are good pizzas but they border on being more of a flatbread with toppings. 

In any case, You won&#39;t be disappointed in visiting here for quick pizza. And the price makes it all the better!"

Before I could fill up my drink, my pizza was ready. When I am crunched for time on my lunch, this is a great spot. One thing I enjoy about Woodgrain over its larger rival is that they don&#39;t skimp on the toppings. When you ask for a topping, they give you as much as if you were only using that one for the entire pizza, not ask you what else beforehand so they can limit you (cough Blaze cough). I do believe they could cook their crust a little longer for a more uniform crisp, but it didn&#39;t take away from my experience. Super cheesey, toppings tasted fresh, and a lot of flavor. I could barely finish it. It was a ton of food for such a little amount of money. They have a killer lunch deal (it escapes me at the moment), but it&#39;s all the toppings you would like at a flat rate. I will be frequenting Woodgrain in the future."

However when it comes to giving one pizza place the crown, it belongs to WoodGrain Pizza. I have a couple reason behind this &#34;pizza crown&#34; as well, beginning with how friendly the staff is. I have being going to WoodGrain for a long time now (aka I don&#39;t remember when I first went) and each time I walk in the staff greets me with a hello. I have gotten to know some of the staff members through my visits and will usually have a quick chit chat with some of the staff.

The second reason is the pizza itself. Yes, there are speciality pizzas on the menu board, but if nothing on the menu fancies your tastebuds you can always create your own pizza - the same rule of thumb also goes with salads! 

The decor on the inside of WoodGrain is very inviting and is cozy. It is usually quiet when I go there so it is easy to grab a booth and have some good conversations over some wood fired pizza. (granted when I go grab pizza it usually at 2 in the afternoon or late at night). They also offer outdoor seating as well which is a nice change from always sitting inside.

The pizza once it is placed in the oven itself is done quite quickly and you then have yourself a hot pizza right out of the oven. Which you can always add oregano, red pepper or cheese from the condiment shakers if you wish.

They also have recently began a reward program where you can earn points on each of your orders at WoodGrain.

The best part of this establishment is the fact that this pizza is affordable for anybody, especially being a college student you get the bang for your buck in my opinion. The quality of each pizza I have had at WoodGrain is always top notch with fresh ingredients and the same sentiment goes for their salads as well."

Be forewarned that if you request Romano cheese, the flavor is a bit overpowering. Otherwise, the pizzas are delicious as are the salads."

First, the good news:  Very attractive space.  I appreciate that they have beer and wine available.  Very friendly, if not particularly knowledgeable staff.  A wide choice of quality ingredients.
Now the bad news: The pizza was terrible. Soft, limp, rubbery crust. The toppings just skate off. Ninety seconds simply isn&#39;t enough time to bake a proper pizza. Halved cherry tomatoes were not even cooked. They were hot, mind you, but raw.
But the deal breaker is the crust. My sister, who is, shall we say, a senior, couldn&#39;t even chew it.
BTW - That &#34;wood fired&#34; oven? The person who cut my pizza admitted that it&#39;s augmented by a gas flame. I call &#34;gimmick.&#34;"

The food here was wonderful and fresh! I really don&#39;t get why this place has been getting such a bad rep. We especially loved the $5 off for checking-in on Yelp :)

The ONLY reason why I give it 4/5 is because their queue system just sucks. So many people lining up right in front of the entrance and no way to alleviate the flow of people waiting in line. This place seems new-ish and they&#39;re still working out the kinks!

My boyfriend and I ordered individual pizzas and for $9.99 you get unlimited toppings - for a topping lover I was in heaven! I created my own with: Garlic Olive Oil as my sauce, Artichokes, Kalamata Olives, Cherry Tomatoes, Mushrooms, Fresh Spinach, Fresh Basil and Mozzarella/Provolone mix. DELICIOUS! My Boyfriend got the Mediterranean pizza and the classic sauce was delicious. I also got a side salad, again, with UNLIMITED toppings!! Such a happy girl right here.

I found out that the pizzas are cooked at 800 degrees for 90 seconds, so by the time my side salad was done being tossed, our pizzas were out. They were FINE! Not soggy, not over toasted, NOTHING. I really think it depends on your toppings as well as I&#39;m sure some of them may release moisture when cooked (i.e. tomatoes..). New Coca Cola machine there with all the soda options. Loved that they had a neat little bar inside as well.

We are definitely coming back!!"

If you&#39;re looking for deep dish, stay away, and go pretty much anywhere in Chicago for a gooey fix.  But if you like tasty thin crust that complements the delicious toppings, this is as good as it gets. 
Prior to this discovery, the best pizza we had ever had was Pepe&#39;s a small chain in Connecticut &amp; Yonkers NY... the only &#34;6-star&#34; pizza, in a class all its own.  That style is being imitated now, effectively, just outside Chicago.  Slightly burnty, bubbly wood-fired deliciosness, that we are now totally addicted to."

Honest to gosh, every type of pizza that you could possibly imagine, because you get to choose the toppings for your pizza. $9.99 gets you anything you could possibly imagine. Do you want to little bit more, just ask. They will put it on for you.

The pizzas are then toasted up in their woodfired kiln within a few minutes. You can ask for it to be a little extra done, or a little less done, however you want.

They also have make your own salads. All the toppings at a decent quality salad bar. 

You can go by yourself and eat at the bar, and watch a game on their television. They have alcohol, but I&#39;m not ordered any, and so I don&#39;t know about the selections. They also have a variety of wines."

Tasted very fresh, only took a couple minutes to cook in their powerful pizza oven. Portion was just right, as it was filling for one or big enough for 2 if you combined it with one of their salads. They do offer a decent selection of beer and wine, as well as having a freestyle Coke machine. 

One small quirk was I had to order the pizza separate from my beer, despite the fact the bar area is next to the oven which is in behind the register. Perhaps this was because most of the staff is underage to serve?

Ambiance wise it is modern with dark wood floors and tables, metal chairs, and white walls. Very sleek and modern! You can sit at a booth, a table, the bar area, or along the window.

I am fan, I definitely prefer this over the other new quick serve pizza chains in the area."

The place is clean and the decor is very nice.  It wasn&#39;t crowded...probably because it was like 2 in the afternoon.   We were greeted at the door and when we said it was our first time there, the guy behind the counter explained everything and how it worked.  

There are specialty pizzas available but we both got the build your own.  An earlier review said they were $9.99 but today they were $10.99 for unlimited toppings.  We both got the marinara sauce since it&#39;s more flavorful than the crushed tomato.  All the toppings are on display for you to pick from and all of them look very fresh.  You can also pick from three or four different cheeses or a combination of them and as much as you want.  I always love extra cheese but I didn&#39;t have to request it this time.  It was piled on  :)   

We paid for our order, got our drinks and sat down and within just a few minutes, our pizzas were ready.  They were really, really good...tasted really fresh and done perfectly.  

The only reason I gave this place four stars instead of five is because I prefer a crispier crust but I suppose being a wood fired oven, a softer crust is expected.  That being said, though, I really didn&#39;t mind it because it was so good overall.  An added bonus is the music played here....classic rock!  

If you&#39;re looking for a really good pizza that doesn&#39;t take forever, go here.  You&#39;ll love it."

Moving on....
I got here around 6pm, and scored the first spot out front.  Plenty of parking, even next to Orange Theory Fitness in January!  This place wasn&#39;t crowded at all so there wasn&#39;t a wait for the pizza or in line or anything like that.  Lots of seating inside too.

So there are two kinds of crust - regular and gluten free.  There are prices for 1 topping, or multiple toppings, there are also specialty pizzas, salads, etc.  The staff here are very friendly and helpful...

I split a pizza and we both got a side salad with our own toppings.  My half of the pizza had chicken breast, which is an extra $1 charge as a topping.  It wasn&#39;t the best pizza ever, but it wasn&#39;t horrible.  I do want to come back and try another kind.  They also serve beer &amp; wine if that&#39;s your thing to go with your pizza...

I&#39;m not sure if it was the door opening/closing but it was rather chilly in there.  My overall experience was good, I do want to return and try this place again."

As a professional food critic and being raised in Chicago, pizza is a huge topic to judge. It is very hard to give a good review on pizza nowadays. 

So without a doubt, this Neapolitan pizzeria surely brought an excellent flavor inside my mouth. I only give 4 stars to restaurants that pack a punch inside my mouth. It tasted very delicious and is highly recommended.


Some cons included the under cooked pizzas. My first orders here brought me an undercooked pizza. It was very edible and fine for some. But as a Chicago style critic, it needs to be more crispy and rich. That could be achieved my leaving the pizza in revolving pizza oven for a longer duration. 

Pricing was appropriate on its menu. And coupons are frequently applicable for checkout and are provided by the establishment itself, but with a very limited time expiration date. 

In total, the atmosphere and mood is great. It has a wooden and rustic look mixed in with a modern tint. It serves a reviewer well. Along with the rare Coca-Cola Freestyle Machines ©, it was a pleasure to eat here."

I ordered my carryout order via app. Yes,  it was Friday night dinner time and assumed it would be busy.  When I entered the establishment I saw the chaos.  If I didn&#39;t already place my order, I would have turned right around. If there were signs indicating order here,  pick up here,  etc. I didn&#39;t see them.   After evaluating the situation,  I was quickly able to figure out the queuing system.  I bypassed the long line where people were waiting to place their orders. I went to the cashier and paid for my order.  Then I waited in the area where a whole bunch of people were standing, waiting for their orders.  I saw a lot since I had to wait so long for my order to be ready.  I saw that most of the tables were empty.  Most of the customers were waiting,  either to order or pick up their food.  Orders were being messed up; most people were complaining.  Staff were kind to customers.  What really turned me off was the pizza oven operator. He kept hollering at the kid working the end of the line as he was in the way when the pizza maker wanted to slide the pizza off the peel onto the counter.  &#34;You have to mooove!&#34; The poor kid was doing the best he could in the mess. The kid was pulled and put at the front of the line.  They put an older, more experienced man at the end of the line.  Probably some type of lead staff.  I never heard the pizza oven operator yell at the older guy. He waited for him to move so he could put the pizzas on the counter. What a bully!  Pick on the kid! Really turned me of. 
I got my pizza, navigated my way out the door,  which was blocked by the growing line of people waiting to order. 
The pizza margharita was very good.  The crust was slightly under-cooked.

We arrived at a busy time so we felt a little rushed to order because there was a line forming behind us. They had several nice sized salads on display. We ordered one salad and two pizzas. The salad was ready right away and unfortunately was about half the size of the display but it was tasty. Our pizzas were done about 15 minutes later. We enjoyed them. Ingredients were fresh, cheese and sauce were great and it was cooked to perfection. We look forward to trying this place again."

I ordered two WoodGrain Neapolitan pizzas online, paying with a credit card. I looked for a carryout sign on arrival, but there was none, so I lined up in a queue and waited and waited.
When a staffer asked what I wanted I explained I was there to pick up online-ordered pizza, and he said to see the cashier. There was a long line. More wait time. I repeated that I was picking up pizza. 
Then the fun really began.
When the pizzas arrived, I tried to leave. Whoops. Even though my credit card was charged 40-plus-minutes earlier, a WoodGrain staffer screamed at me, &#34;You can&#39;t leave.&#34; 
Everyone within 20 feet stopped and stared. More staff got involved. 
&#34;Did you pay?&#34; 
&#34;Yes.&#34; 
&#34;You can leave.&#34; 
Again, another scream: &#34;He hasn&#39;t paid,&#34; even though I had. 
More waiting as the staffer collected from customers who had come in after I had. This went on: One staffer telling me I could go; the other shouting I must wait. The crowd was enjoying the circus.
Finally, I got the pizzas home. An hour and 20 minutes after I placed the order I bit into cold pizza, then pulled out of my mouth bits of whatever paper product WoodGrain Neapolitan Pizza puts between the pizza and the cardboard box. The pizza that had been in the box while Woodgrain staff hurled the verbal abuse had melted into the box, making it inedible.
Of course I complained on company website, and it has not bothered to respond. Yelp won&#39;t allow zero stars. In this case, one star is too kind.
Too many good choices in the area to return to an operation that makes carryout customers feel like criminals."

There&#39;s nothing wrong with the pizza; it just doesn&#39;t shine in any way. With the 2 for 1 coupon I used ( code EBOGO, on their website and Facebook page) two pizzas for $9.99 was a good deal. I would have been disappointed both due to quality and size (they are quite small, personal pizzas) if I had paid full price. Place is clean, staff cheerful and efficient. If you want real, spectacular Neapolitan pizza (and they give you free cannoli which is amazing) drive downtown and go to spacca Napoli. All of my Italian expat friends go there, and having been to Naples myself, I too can attest it&#39;s just like being there."

These build your own pizza places are popping up faster than zits on a teenager.. Most will go the way of Qdoba and wont compete in the face of the originals. The reason this place gets the two stars is because of the service. We had 5 pizzas for 5 people, only one pizza artist was assigned to us, meanwhile another would take orders for those who walked in after us and speed them into the oven. Fine.. first time here, we take some time. They don&#39;t spread the sauce evenly so you have just crust on some of the slices. Knowing what toppings should be sparingly dropped is another must know how. I asked for giardinera peppers, which he loaded up on along with a ton of cheese. The pizza came out with a thick layer of cheese that fell off when picked up. When the end of the line cook pulled out the pizzas, he didn&#39;t know which pizza belonged to who, we had to figure that out, since he pulled off the numbered metal tent off too soon. They have all the ingredients, just need to communicate with each other more effectively and be consistent with the prep line.
 A couple positives, the crust was nicely darkened in the wood burning oven. I like the dining room ambiance and the Coke Freestyle machine."

And as for the cleanliness behind the counter? There really isn&#39;t much. I would&#39;ve expected such a newer establishment to be more on top of it all but that&#39;s not the case as far as I can tell.  Most likely won&#39;t be returning any time soon unless something changes.

1)   The bottom of the crust was soggy - I could not pick up a piece of pizza and eat it without holding it with two hands so the entire ingredients wouldn&#39;t fall off the top
2)   My pizza was swimming with kalamata olives and they were extremely salty.   I had to pick all of them off my pizza - there must have been approximately 1/4 cup on the pizza
3)    The pizza was very hot so at first I wanted to cut the pizza with a knife and fork.  This failed, as the paper under the pizza tore and stuck to the bottom of the pizza
4)    The tomato sauce was very bland
5)    I went to the register and asked to talk to the manager.   Low and behold, he was the person who was holding up the wall behind the bar.   We noticed him while we were eating our dinner and thought he looked like he had nothing to do!   When he came to the register and I told him that there were too many kalamata olives on my pizza, he did not seem very concerned.  I said it ruined the whole pizza and it was as if he could care less.   He said usually they only put a few olives on the pizza - that was all he had to say.   I also asked him if he had ever eaten any of the kalamata olives at this restaurant and he said he had not.   A restaurant manager who doesn&#39;t even try the food?
6)   Seeing that this was a new location for Woodgrain, I would have thought that the manager would be walking around asking the patrons how their food was - but of course, this manager was just standing around in the back of the bar area, looking quite oblivious !"

My family and I came here on a weeknight for dinner. At first I was surprised at how casual the setting is - you walk up and place your pizza order, almost like a pizza-chipotle. Then you serve your own drink and sit down to wait for the 90 second fire to cook your creation. FYI - There is an extra wait for gluten free crust, I waited for at least 10 minutes while others went on to order their pizzas. The plant-based cheese is Daiya, one of my favorites for taste and melt-factor. The pizza was cooked perfectly and the crust was simply amazing. My mom is gluten free and this pizza tasted so good she actually worried that they gave her the wrong crust! I will definitely return for more. I appreciate that they don&#39;t charge an arm and a leg for gluten free or plant-based cheese. It&#39;s $1 to add the Daiya cheese, and no charge for gluten free crust.

Time of my visit: Lunch time

I decided to go to this place based on Yelp! reviews.  There is a huge selection of different options, I chose Hug Heaven.  I had an option of hot or cold, I picked cold and it came with the chips.  I also ordered large iced tea.  Right from the top, I was told, it would be just one free refill (I really appreciated that).  I reached out to pay with my AMEX and was told they did not accept it.  Sorry, but this is such a pet peeve of mine, either accept them all or be a cash only, this selected cards only is none-sense to me.

It did not take long for them to get me my food. While waiting I did notice there was a price difference between what was in the menu and what I was charged.  It was not a big difference, but nonetheless could be a bit confusing.  When my lunch arrived, the sandwich did not look all that big (size wise), maybe a little over 6 inches in length.  Chips were your typical, out of the bag, big brand chips, I was hoping for home style, home made chips.  The sandwich was not anything spectacular or out of this word, your typical deli sandwich, warmed up.  The bread was too soft for my liking.  Overall, I was not all that impressed and for pennies under $10, I was expecting a heck lot more.

I must comment and compliment on three things, efficiency, the food came out fast.  The cleanness, the place looked like you could eat off the floor.  The service, the service was awesome!  The lady behind the counter, the lady who brought out my food, both were very polite, sweet and nice.

However, C- is the best I can do.  It&#39;s almost not worth a drive for me on my lunch."

Located in the strip mall on Lake St., it wasn&#39;t hard to find and sits nicely among the other businesses.

Upon entering to meet Jacqueline B. for lunch, I was greeted sweetly by the lady at the counter. I wouldn&#39;t say the menu is overwhelming but there is a LOT to choose from. You&#39;re not weird if you need to ask for a minute to browse through all of the different types of hot and cold sandwiches and the rest of the menu. I picked up a bottle of water from the open refrigerated section by the counter, ordered myself a chicken pesto asiago panini and took a seat. It was immediately in the middle of a lunch rush so I&#39;m surprised I had gotten a table! This place gets crowded!

I have very few preferences and opinions when it comes to food so I thought my panini was a-ok to me. All paninis come with a side of chips which doesn&#39;t sound very filling but the sandwich was actually larger than I had thought it would be. The chicken was pretty scarce within the sandwich but the panini bread made up for it. The prices were what I expected (and had read from previous reviews). The prices are definitely comparable to a Panera lunch.

The one qualm I have about Crave is that from the chatter and conversations as well as the music throughout, it was really difficult to hear the lady say the order when your meal was ready. From the ambience and looks of the place, I had honestly thought your order gets brought to your table - especially because there is outdoor seating. It may be really inconvenient for those outdoor customers to peek in-and-out to see if their food is ready.

Overall, the space was nicely decorated, very clean and had a nice rustic look to it with the warm colors and dark wood. The employees were really sweet and really take care of the place from the looks of it.  I&#39;d love to visit again and try more on the large menu!"

Unfortunately no stars for the food itself. I really hate giving bad reviews but their food is nothing spectacular. Perhaps I had too much expectations given that this place was 4.5 out 5 stars (33 reviews). It was a total let down for me. I do appreciate the variety of sandwiches they offer. 

They advertise fresh soup which maybe it was but the taste was bland. I had the mushroom soup and it was bland with big slices of mushrooms. 

I asked for their most popular sandwich and the lady said it was the chicken pesto panini. The bf had that and I had the Cuban panini. The chicken pesto was bland with tasteless chicken and same with the pork in the Cuban sandwich. Both meats were tasteless and it could&#39;ve been more tender. The bread... Have you ever had a sandwich that hurt the top of your palate because the bread was too hard??? Yep, the bread on this one surely didn&#39;t make the cut either. I ended up taking out the meat and leaving the bread uneaten. 

The Cuban panini came with seasoned fries. $8.95. The meat filled half of the sandwich, but then again if you don&#39;t enjoy the taste, why have more of it?  Not worth it. Chicken pesto panini came with chips. $8.99. Not worth it either.

Crave Cafe is one of the good choices. The small café has about 10 tables and it&#39;s half full at lunch time on a Saturday. The menu reminds me of Panera Bread, with sandwiches (hot and cold), soup, salads, but there are also at least 5 different kinds of burgers and some &#34;south of the border&#34; choices. 

I decided to go with the special of the day: fish tacos with fries. Each of the 3 tacos had a good-sized well-seasoned fresh-off-the-grill tilapia fillet, not small pieces of unidentified fish like many other fish tacos. I devoured all of them. The crispy fries were the best I&#39;ve had in a long time. If the weather was cooler, I would have tried one of their homemade soups. 

The San Antonio Burger he (by he, I mean my spouse of choice) got was a little messy to eat due to the BBQ pulled pork, but he said it&#39;s yummy. 

Prices are on a par with fast casual restaurants, but you can expect more of &#34;made from scratch&#34; here.

Crave Café is this cute little cafe in a shopping plaza area between a grocery store and other random businesses. We went inside and were greeted by the sweetest lady who talked to us as if we were friends, and she seemed to know everybody else in the cafe as well from the way she was talking to them. Everything on the menu was delicious, I went with one of their daily specials, a panini of some sort ( this was last week so i don&#39;t recall) but it was absolutely delicious. It was a big sandwich and I was told that people usually leave with leftovers, but i managed to finish it. It came with a side of fries which were crispy, hot and perfect. I would totally go back here if I lived in the area."

I got the Asian Chicken Salad for about $8. The size is good, ginger dressing is delicious but my salad is FROZEN. 

Yes, FROZEN. It took the guy all but 3 seconds to put it in a bag for takeout which must mean that they are premade. In any case, a frozen salad is not a salad. All the lettuce is frozen and the chicken as well. That said, the menu said &#34;grilled chicken&#34; and I had hoped it would be warm. Or at least room temperature, or edible. Also, the chicken looks processed.

I would try it again, but would not do a salad."

 The sandwich was bland, lacking real character.   I know you say it&#39;s a turkey sandwich - what did you expect Vince?  There was nothing exciting in the sandwich - the turkey was boring, bacon basic and the spicy mayo lacked zip.    

The chili saved the lunch.   It was smoky, full of meat and was an excellent rendition of chili.   I&#39;d go back for this by itself and try something different on the menu.

Politely advised the older gentleman, I think he was the cook as well. Asked if I could possibly have something else since cheese was melted all over the salmon. He responded &#39;it&#39;s already made.. We can take the cheese off..&#39; which wasn&#39;t an option, it was seriously all over...

Unfortunately had to walk out $12 short and still hungry.

Granted they have a service deliver for them and they don&#39;t have their own drivers. I definitely won&#39;t order delivery again because it takes well over an hour and they even called me a few times because they needed to clarify my order. It wasn&#39;t complicated and it was a small order so getting 3 calls about it was odd to me and made me feel like they weren&#39;t paying attention.

This is a cute, super clean, friendly and tasty, sandwich shop.  They offer a wide array of sandwichs, pannini&#39;s, burgers, salads.  They have pastries and a breakfast menu.  They serve Coca-Cola products from the fountain, but they also have a cooler with water, juice and Pepsi products as well.  This cafe is just west of Caputo&#39;s in the Georgetown Shopping Center in Bloomingdale.  

 First of all, this place is immaculate, clean, bathrooms were spotless, shiny, attractive artwork and a fragrant aroma.  Floors were spotless.  Attendant was very helpful and for only an additional twenty cents I upgraded to a meal for my Bleu burger with carmelized onions.  Food came quickly to our table, the french fries, which I almost didn&#39;t order were fantastic.  Owner buys a seasoned fry, pays extra, but they were crispy, tasty and golden brown.  Just the way I like them.   The sandwich, which only cost $5.29 was GOURMET all the way.  Bleu cheese, was so tasty and not an incredibly strong bite, perfect for my tastes.  The Bleu cheese is a Stella&#39;s product which is an excellent brand of food.  Owner goes high end with all of his food orders, pays extra for a higher quality of food.  

Atmosphere was pleasant, they had a nice run of lunch customers which were taken care of quickly.  We were able to relax, no hustle and bustle, here,   Great mood to enjoy  friends and good food.  Not noisy like many restaurants.  

Be prepared to have a great experience with your cravings at Crave Cafe.  Five stars, period!!!!   Great place to pop in after your dance workout or weight training session or visit to Caputo&#39;s,  stop in and satisfy your cravings."

This place does. See one of the other yelper&#39;s pics - does that look like a nice pressed panini? Ugh wish I had looked myself before ordering it. The beef was so tough I had to wrench it apart after de-breading it to feed it to my cat. Chorizo burrito ( medium) was enormous and a total grease bomb. Of course chorizo is fatty by nature but I felt like I needed a shower after, to say nothing of the heartburn. The rice and beans were good, and the green salsa they give you with chips is actually wonderful - highlight of the meal. Guacamole was flavorless but fresh and substantial - I added some garlic salt and salsa to eat it with plain corn tortillas at home. The service: the girl behind the counter asked if I wanted chips with my guac - I said I can use the chips that come free with the salsa, unless I would need more? She said yes so I paid the extra $1...I got the same total amount of chips as the adjacent table which only had the free chips and salsa. ? Also, it took *forever* to get my soda + the chips and salsa which normally are set out on a table immediately at Mexican places. Then when I was leaving and asked for a container to take the guac home, it took her another 10 minutes to bring one (and she wasn&#39;t doing anything besides packing her purse to leave, I was the only customer at that point - 3pm). It was my first time in the area so I don&#39;t know if there are better local options but as someone who usually gets Mexican in Berwyn and the city - Pilsen etc - this was pretty awful."

Since moving to the Western Suburbs, it&#39;s difficult finding a delicious Mexican spot that reminds you of home. Taqueria Aurelio&#39;s truly is amazing and I highly recommend it for anyone craving a delicious burrito, torta, or enchiladas. Don Aurelio is always there behind the counter being friendly and preparing your food. The sauces are amazing: I personally like both, but prefer the green sauce (salsa verde). To me, the Salsa is an indication of what the food is going to be like. If it doesn&#39;t taste right, then run! Taqueria Aurelio&#39;s/La Villita is a hole-in-the-wall type of joint, but it&#39;s definitely a diamond in the rough. Buen provecho!"

I test Mexican places&#39; authenticity by their tongue taco.  Not for everyone, but a taco de lengua with onions and cilantro is a little slice of heaven for me. I work in Warrenville, and have had trouble finding a good tongue taco until I found this place.  I will definitely return

This place was not easy to find.    I went on the recommendation of a co-worker, who couldn&#39;t remember the name.  Part of the problem is that the name on the outside (Was it La Villita??) is different from the name on the inside (Taqueria Aurelio&#39;s).  Multiple Personalities?  No problem, let&#39;s call it Sybil&#39;s Place.

Decor is not what you are here for - nor air conditioning.  Nope, what you&#39;re going to get is a very good taco."

I have the Chorizo Burrito every time I go.  They offer medium and large.  The medium is so doggone big that I have yet to order the large.  As well, and one of the BIG reasons I go back, is they make their own horchata on site.  If you like horchata...fuhgetaboutit...it&#39;s awesome there.

Aurelio is the guy in the back that you can see doin&#39; the cookin&#39;.  Super nice guy too.

Love this place."

The red sauce is just perfect, while the green sauce seems to have a variance in spiciness. It could be milder or spicier than the red sauce. The enchiladas taste great, but you may want to order extra sauce on it.  I&#39;ve had all the different meats and I am yet to be disappointed. The only reason it doesn&#39;t get a 5 is because they seem to forget to turn on their air conditioning in the summer and their heater during the winter. It&#39;s not unbearable, just a bit uncomfortable. Regardless, it has never stopped my girlfriend and I from eating their delicious Mexican food."

Everything I ate was fabulous. I ordered the Spicy Pork lunch special. It came with a side salad and they didn&#39;t skimp on the spicy part. I actually added some teriyaki into it to cool it down a bit. I also ordered a side of gyoza (potstickers) since I didn&#39;t realize how huge the portions would be and I had a craving.

I had always wondered if there was anywhere to sit in this space. Yes, there is, and they have high chairs too. Entrees are, in general, around the $9 mark, but they give you enough for two meals, so that&#39;s not a big deal. 

Ah, the rice. They must have rinsed the rice a hundred times, because I&#39;ve never had rice so clumpy yet not starchy. Perfect chopstick-compatible texture. 

Me and the baby split a standard chicken teriyaki, as well as a pineapple chicken teriyaki plate. The pineapple chicken teriyaki wasn&#39;t bad, although next time I would stick with the standard teriyaki plate--teriyaki sauce + sweet and sour sauce doesn&#39;t taste quite right. 

Happily, the teriyaki sauce they do have is quite good. Nice and simple, not too mirin-y, not too sweet.  The chicken was cooked nice and tender, and just the right bite size for everyone at the table.

I also appreciated the house salad, which was fresh, though I couldn&#39;t tell you much more about the dressing.

I don&#39;t know the difference between great teriyaki and bad teriyaki. All I know is that its suppose to be like a sweet soy sauce. 

Located next to an Aldi and a Chinese Buffet, this place is a small little eatery in a strip mall. 

Their claim to fame is their teriyaki sauce which I found to be tasty. I got the:

Chicken Teriyaki: (8.99) Chicken was juicy, it comes with salad and rice. It was sweet and salty and tangy. The salad had some sort of sweet creamy dressing which I like and the rice was a shorter grain than most Asian take out places which was a nice touch. 

What really stands out about this place is the HUGE portion. (See Picture), I got like half a chicken&#39;s worth of meat and a pound of rice. It all comes on a gigantic plate.

They also have extra teriyaki sauce bottles everywhere just in case you wanted more.  

Overall I would say if you&#39;re a teriyaki lover, this is the spot for you. I&#39;m pretty indifferent about it but I do recognize good quality and clean service which this place certainly does have. 

Keep in mind the food takes some time to come out because its cooked to order. 

Will definitely return."

The spicy pork was more sweet than spicy, and I liked the portions to this because I was full after half. There was a slight smokiness to it too, which I enjoyed, but it was too weak for me in spiciness. However, my tolerance for spicy foods is higher than average so.. haha.

Fast, efficient service. I had called in my order 30 minutes ahead. Google&#39;s navi directed me over to this pizza place on the other side of the street (-.-); thankfully a yelper posted tips on how to get there correctly hehe.

I&#39;ve visited other businesses in this strip mall. But until yesterday, I never stopped here. 

I had a pounding hunger headache and I needed to hit the auto parts stores over in this area to look for some parts. Yelp reviews told me about how this place had fantastic homemade teriyaki sauce. As a longtime Japanese food fan, I&#39;m usually not the biggest fan of teriyaki -- mainly because a lot of people get lazy with it and just use store-bought sauce. If you&#39;re going to do it in a restaurant, make it your own. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s too much to ask. 

This place does. Also, as soon as you walk in, you see that they have two things on every table: a bottle of their homemade teriyaki sauce (so you don&#39;t have to ask for extra if you eat in), and a bottle of Sriracha. (Proper Sriracha -- no Lee Kum Kee bootleg cocksauce here!) 

Lunch special is great. You get a little salad with a nice homemade creamy dressing, fluffy rice (white rice is included, but you can substitute fried for an additional charge), and your meat of choice. I had chicken. I&#39;ll upload photos in a moment. 

Drinks selection is your typical fountain stuff augmented by a cooler full of iced tea/energy drinks/Vitamin Water/Sobe. I wish they offered hot tea, but that&#39;s a minor quibble. 

Their homemade teriyaki sauce is great. Add Sriracha to the fluffy white rice and contrast the layered spiciness with the sweet/salty teriyaki and have a very happy party. In your mouth. I heard what I said. 

They also offer free samples if you&#39;re not sure. Stop in and give it a try. I want to try the spicy pork next time. :9"

First off let&#39;s touch on the chicken teriyaki. The foam container had the chicken and some sauce in two pockets and a main pocket of white rice. The chicken itself was well grilled while still retaining a tender texture and the sauce was a very nice compliment. The overall taste was excellent and the portion size was very reasonable for the money. The white rice included was just regular white rice so there&#39;s not much to note there. 

The gyoza&#39;s included were pretty good as well but a little on the small side. For those unfamiliar with gyoza, it&#39;s a variation on the pot sticker. These seemed to include a seasoned white meat of some type (possibly pork). These were nice as an appetizer but I&#39;ve had better.

Finally to comment on the fried rice. The fried rice I had was pretty good there were chopped up vegatables and a lot of egg mixed in. I liked the overall taste though I would probably not order it as a standalone side again, but would instead upgrade the white rice bundled with the entree to the fried rice if possible. 

Overall I liked my food and will definitely be coming again. I&#39;ll give this place five stars for being great food at a great value."

The chicken seems to now be processed judging about how it is pressed and small. Also it looks like instead of buying bulk sriracha and refilling the bottles; they add water to the bottles making the consistency noticeably watery. wack"

The bulgogi pork is right and have a lot of flavor. I cant comment on up charges, i always get white rice. The rice is good, not too sticky not too wet. Homemade salad dressing is tasty. I can usually make two meals out of one plate. Great left overs. The chicken breast is tender too."

The chicken teriyaki plate was good, and he enjoyed the chicken katsu plate.  The salad came out from the kitchen with a delicious dressing on it.  We decided to try the variety of sauces they had bottled near the kitchen.  We identified one of the bottled sauces as the salad dressing and I added some more to my salad.  WHOA, bad idea!  It&#39;s apparently a dairy-based sauce and is NOT good after it&#39;s been sitting out and fermenting.  Gross.  Please, PLEASE Joy Teriyaki - refrigerate your dairy-based sauces so they don&#39;t sit out and get rank.  That&#39;s a tummy issue waiting to happen!  I ended up having some tummy gurgles afterward. :( 

Aside from the foul-taste of the Sitting Out Sauce, the rest of the dining experience was good.  Joy Teriyaki was a no-frills place with fair-priced lunch specials.  I&#39;ll be back, but if I want any more salad dressing, it won&#39;t be from the bottle sitting out on the counter!"

Food - Wonderful.  The best teriyaki place I&#39;ve ever eaten.  Their spicy chicken teriyaki makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside its so good.  The perfect blend of sweet and spice.

Service - Sub par.  The latest complaint comes from my experience at lunch this afternoon.  I called an order in as I typically do at noon.  The woman on the phone struggled to comprehend what I was telling her and didn&#39;t understand my name even after providing it to her a 3rd time.  Once the order was placed I was told 15-20 mins for pickup, which pleased me since I work 15 mins away from their location.  Upon arrival at 12:15-12:20 the food was not ready so a coworker and myself paid at the register and found a seat to wait for our order.  12:30 rolls around and still nothing.  12:40, still waiting.... 12:55 was the final straw.  I went back up to the counter and kindly asked what was the reason for the delay.  You could tell by the shocked look in her eye that our order had either been given to someone else or forgotten, keep in mind several other people that came in after us who had not called in orders had already gotten their food and almost finished.  1:00 and our food was finally up!  Thinking they might offer us a discount or a credit on our next meal I was immediately overwhelmed with disappointment when she placed an order of egg rolls in front of us as compensation for the inconvenience.  Some of you are saying to yourself, &#34;I don&#39;t know, that seems fair.&#34;  If you have ever had the egg rolls from Joy Teriyaki you would have been just as disappointed as we were, especially after this last price increase cost us 15.00 an order for a plate of fried rice, chicken, salad, and a fountain drink.  I am not one to complain but I have had this happen to me several times in the past and nothing seems to change except for the price, which is now higher than ever.

To sum all of this up.  Joy Teriyaki has always been a favorite but I will no longer continue to give them my business given the current prices.  There is a great chinese restaurant in Glendale Hts off of North Ave called China Chef where the food quality is just as good if not better and the portions are larger for half the price, its not the same food but similar cuisine.  If you have had a similar story or are just fed up with prices like myself please join me in boycotting this establishment."

I love the hole-in-the-wall feel of the place.

Their teriyaki is very good, I love that there&#39;s a bottle at every table and also several other bottles of various sauces available for your dish. 

I&#39;m glad they don&#39;t have too many choices, because I would never be able to make up my mind. But one day, I decided on the simple chicken teriyaki and I was very surprised at the portion I got...HUGE! When I was paying, I was thinking it was a little pricey but I then saw the amount of food I payed for and it made it that much better. 

All of the chicken in my dish tasted fresh and not very fatty, which is what I like.
The woman at the register was pretty friendly, which is always a plus.

I&#39;ll be returning! :)"

I had the 7.99 teriyaki chicken lunch special. Came with a big portion of chicken, white rice and a side salad with what i want to call a sesame, rice vinegar dressing. Not a fan of vinagrette dressings but this one was really good. The chicken was tender but had a nice carmelized char from the sauce, the sauce itself was amazing. Each table had a bottle of teriyaki sauce and a bottle of sriracha, two very essential things to me when i eat teriyaki, so you have controll over the heat or sweetness. 

The portion size is pretty big for the price..i ended up boxing up almost half of it because i got full. One negative thing is they take a bit of time to get your order out, my lunch break is an hour long, it took me 15 minutes to get there around 15 minutes for my food to come out, 15 minutes to eat and 15 to get back. This being my first time it really isnt a big deal, next time ill call ahead, as i suggest anyone on a time frame to do so. Other than that, it was a great meal, the only thing id add is some sliced avocado, i dont know if thats just a california thing, but it makes a huge difference, also lookong forward to trying the teriyaki beef and spicy pork. Will be a returning 100%"

So she asks if she can get everything without sauce.  I think she missed the whole point of this place, uh derp? I believe they were willing to accommodate her.
Anyway, even though I pass this place several times a day, I&#39;ve been avoiding this place, as a typical Chinese cuisine place.  I remember, and liked when this location was a Caribbean(?) cuisine joint, which I liked, but didn&#39;t last. I figured this place wasn&#39;t going to last either.  Finally I took a look at the reviews and was intrigued, especially since it has lasted so long.  
I had the spicy pork, based on the recommendations here, and it did not disappoint!  The lunch special was a little pricey, but the portion was huge.  Another reviewer indicated they make their own sauces, which is a plus in my book; it all tasted freshly made.  
I am glad I decided to try this place.  A local hidden gem.  Will quickly become a go-to spot for a quick meal out.  I will be back."

&#34; yup, call in a spicy for me &#34; 
It&#39;s about the best lunch around and since I&#39;ve been there often, I can say it&#39;s consistently good. 
The &#34;call in&#34; part is key, as it appears all orders are made on the spot and not just scooped out of some vat in back . At lunch time, the wait can burn up a lot of your git ta&#39; et&#39;n time, also the place fills up quick. I&#39;m unfortunately creature of habit, so the chicken Teriyaki lunch deal is my thing- but I have dabbled in the spicy. And it&#39;s spicy spicy. Not OMG spicy, but just enough heat to remind you what you got with every bite. 
If you are dining in, lunch is served on a china plate, or a foam box if you get it to go. Bottles of teriyaki and Sriracha  are on the tables and real silverware is available. Unless you are one of those fancy know it all metro scooter riding types, then chopsticks are available to fumble with before grabbing a damn fork and eating like the rest of us. 
Not that I&#39;ve ever done that. 
Ok it was me. 
Tips: they like cash, and reward cash payments with a punch card, although I&#39;m not in the club so I&#39;m not sure what it gets ya. 
Enjoy Joy!"

This place should be called Happy Happy Joy Joy Teriyaki.  Located in the weirdly unholy Bermuda Triangle of good Asian food near Army Trail and Bloomingdale Road which has Pho Ha, Hong Ning and Joy Teriyaki within a 1 mile radius of each other,  this place managed to break a couple of my resolutions, nay three of them, thus keeping with the tri-themed review. 

First of all, as with 80% of the country, I resolved to eat healthier in 2013.  Less red meat, namely pork, which is the best meat in the galaxy.  I also resolved to exercise more in what free time I have, and to eat less, as in, eat until satiated.  Not, &#34;Eat until food bypasses digestion phase and escapes oral-gastric tract by means of nostrils.&#34;  Yes, eating until food comes out the nose is NOT the plan.   
So how did I come to squash these resolutions?  A fateful Friday where I dropped the wife off to visit a friend, and I was to kill a couple of hours in whatever way I imagined.  Go to the gym?  I could have, but I didn&#39;t bring my bag.  I suppose that couldn&#39;t stop me from finding a trail, or even a sidewalk to just walk off a few calories.  But no. I contemplated going to the Avalanche to have a drink and catch the Bulls game, but I thought I might get thrashed if I walked in there with tall Hunters on my feet.  SO, I went to Half Price, picked up a stack of 50 cent Cook&#39;s Illustrated issues and read some in the car while waiting for the call to pick up the wife.  When the approximate time came, and the call didn&#39;t come through, the hunger buzzer in my belly alarmed.  

Deciding on Joy Teriyaki out of the three restaurants named above, I opted for the Spicy Pork and Chicken Breast Plate.  It took about 15 minutes for the food to be ready, but good things come to those who wait. Time food was ready - 08:11pm.  Time wife called for car service - 08:13pm.  Went to retrieve her and ended up going to Target before heading home.  Ate salad portion of meal while walking around Target.  Home at 10:20pm.  Watched Netflix while eating my delicious Spicy Pork and Chicken.  From what I remembered, the pork was tender, with minimal fat.  And it was my favorite cut of pork - SHOULDER.  The Crash Test Dummies comes to mind.  Mmm mmm mmm mmm.   Wasn&#39;t too spicy, but it tasted great and the chicken was also very clean tasting.  The rice, I could have used more of it, but it was cooked well.  The best part of it all?  The teriyaki.  Holy shabazz.  Talk about unctuous in a good way, this stuff had mouth-feel galore.  I mixed a little sriracha into mine and fell asleep while eating.  Kind of sad, no?  I woke up rip-roaring full, and sad, because I had to admit defeat and put it away in the fridge until the next morning.  

2 days later, I&#39;m still saving it in order to prolong the joy."

From the outside you would think that it was like some low quality restaurant since the sign is so plain and the parking lot in front of it it getting pretty poor. But yeah, not too shabby.

I thought at first the prices were a little high, but then after getting the food I was just like, WHOA! I ordered the beef and they seriously give you about two handfuls of beef. It wasn&#39;t like amazingly  tasting beef teriyaki but it wasn&#39;t horrible either. 

Went here once and it was packed but I guess it all depends on the time of day because this last time I went, it was afternoon and it was like dead. Guy at the register was literally staring at the window. Good place to go if you want quick Asian style food with rice that&#39;s not americanized yet."

Its was excellent.  I went for the fried rice instead of the white rice this time as well.  All around good food.  The eating area does need work though as the walls in some places look like they might have small holes in them.  Kind of gives the saying &#34;hole in the wall&#34; a whole new meaning LOL.  It&#39;s really not bad and the place is pretty clean.  Other then the simple seating area, the place has good food.  You can see the kitchen area and it looks clean and organized which is the most important. They make their own teriyaki sauce and its very good.  I did see an small sign that said they were going to raise the prices on the menu in January 2013, I was bummed but if its only a buck or two, its still a great deal.  Overall good food!

After eating at Joy Teriyaki you will feel fat and you will feel full. 

You definitely get what you pay for here...in food and in flavor, especially for a &#34;fast food&#34; type of joint. I always go for their specialty, the chicken teriyaki. The chicken is always tender and you probably get about 10 ounces worth. I opt to either split the dish with someone, or else I find myself with lunch for the next day.

Yays: 
- Massive portions. When I say massive, 2 people could easily share a dish.
- Killer teriyaki sauce. And bottle of it at each table.
- Love the fried rice &amp; veggie egg rolls. And the gyoza.
- Spicy pork. It has just the right kick. 
- Salad comes with every plate. I suppose that&#39;s their effort to make you feel like you&#39;re eating somewhat healthy.

Nays:
- Service blows. It&#39;s not fast, and it&#39;s not friendly.
- I question where the chicken comes from. It tastes good, and it&#39;s tender. However,  I often wonder how much of  &#34;real chicken&#34; it is. ((I think I&#39;m jaded after watching &#34;Food Inc.&#34;))
- Kinda grimy inside.
- Gets very busy during peak hours. Expect a 15 minute wait for &#34;fast&#34; food. 

Overall, Joy Teriyaki isn&#39;t bad. It&#39;s not the best I&#39;ve eaten, but for a quick bite, it definitely does the job!"

The plates they use for dine-in are basically a serving platter in size and the food servings consume the majority of the plate surface.  I enjoyed the Spicy Pork the most, but it wasn&#39;t really that spicy it was more of a savory type sauce.  Pork was just the perfect texture.  It was cooked just right to still be tender.

Their teriyaki sauce is absolutely the best. Drench everything in that stuff.

So I&#39;ve told you how good their teriyaki sauce is- but let me tell you- their fried rice is AMAZING. It is quite different than your typical asian fried rice. Especially good if you squirt some of their teriyaki sauce on it. I highly recommend Joy. If you live anywhere in the 30 minute radius, it&#39;s going to be worth the trip."

It was my first visit and I had a mixed combo of Chicken Breast and Chicken Teriyaki. The dish came with Fried Rice and Salad. The chicken was hot, fresh, and so god damn TENDER.... It was complemented perfectly by their homemade Teriyaki sauce. The sauce wasn&#39;t too sweet either which is a problem most Teriyaki dishes have. Not too strong either... Just right and they hand you a whole bottle for dine in! The Fried Rice and White Rice deserve a special mention as well. They don&#39;t use the typical bulk cheap rice. They use legit Japanese rice that is more pricey and has that hearty texture. You can taste the freshness of the steamed vegetables in the Fried Rice. The Rice and Teriyaki go so well hand in hand! The Salad is okay. It&#39;s just there. It&#39;s not bad. I am definitely coming back for the food!

Service:

Nice Counter lady. Food came out under 7 minutes when I came in while it had a decent amount of people in which was nice. Can&#39;t really say much else, it&#39;s a Walk in food place. The lady gave me good directions to find the place as well. 

Atmosphere:

Hole in the wall place. Not going to lie, the place is kind of depressing. It looks like it hasn&#39;t been renovated since the 80&#39;s. The walls literally have 80&#39;s convenience store wallpaper that is peeling off. You get used to it fast, but I would not take any girls on dates here. Good for groups of hungry college students for sure lol. It&#39;s also kind of hard to spot. It&#39;s located in the Walter E. Smite parking lot area and right next to Subway.

Overall, I will go here for the epic food! I was really satisfied on my first visit, I hope to update my review when I try out the other menu items."

I had the chicken and beef teriyaki combo ($10.50) and everything was excellent! I will say that I&#39;m not comfortable spending $8+ on work lunch usually so I probably won&#39;t make it habit, but I&#39;d spend $20 on this at a restaurant dinner and leave with a smile on my face.  Overall the price IS fair (most plates are $9 or more), but it&#39;s a bit high for my daily work lunch budget."

The biggest problem I had was how much everything costs. They nickel and dime you on everything. My girlfriend and I ordered two lunch specials, chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu at $7.99 a piece. We wanted to get it spicy at .50 cents more for each meal. A fried rice substitution was $1.75 more per plate. Egg rolls were $1.99 each. Plus the two drinks ran for a total of $30.09. For that price we could have had better lunch somewhere else."

Surprise, it&#39;s actually the crack-like teriyaki sauce at Joy Teriyaki that defines modern addiction. (full disclosure: i do not know what crack is like).

I really wish I were kidding about this, but I&#39;ve been to this restaurant nearly three times weekly for the last six months. It is a running standard for my office, friends from the city, nearly anyone if they are hungry and within twenty miles of this location. The service is pleasant, the menu diverse (even though I always order the same damn thing), and they don&#39;t mind if you use an entire bottle of sauce, which my boss and I are prone to doing.

The food... After comparing it to drugs and addiction earlier in the review, it&#39;s hard to go up from there, but put simply, it&#39;s massive, massive portions, cooked perfectly, with a boatload of sauces and seasonings to tickle any palette. The store is not really all that much to look at, but if you&#39;re looking at anything other than the food, something is horribly wrong with your brain and it needs a checkup.

If you&#39;re remotely close to Glendale Heights, for any reason, this should be a top priority to visit. Drugs are bad. Joy Teriyaki is good.

PRO TIPZ:
* Call ahead. The wait isn&#39;t bad, but since they make everything fresh, if you let them know when you&#39;ll arrive for dine-in it can shrink the delay between you and your saucedrugs.
* The salad is fine, but I recommend opting for extra rice instead.
* If there&#39;s a big group, the quality does start to suffer as their small kitchen fights to keep ahead of the orders.
* There&#39;s nothing wrong with the standard Chicken Teriyaki, but I prefer the Chicken Breast, which is cents more and all white meat.
* Seriously, about the whole addiction thing. I&#39;ve had people tell me, after one visit, that they&#39;ve been craving Joy months after the fact. There is something really really unusually amazingly addictive about this place."

A bottle of the teriyaki sauce is on every table so you can drench the dish and rice (and I recommend you do).

The only downsides are that it can get quite crowded at lunch time and during the winter it stays pretty chilly with the door always opening and closing."

My dad recommended this to me and my family, so we went together for dinner.  I have to rave about that salad dressing like everyone else.  What is it that makes it taste sooo good????  I could eat salad all day with that dressing!  We usually bring some home with us.  My kids (1 and 3) love it too and I&#39;m thrilled that it helps me get them to eat veggies.

I definitely recommend the fried rice, gyoza, katsu, and their fried chicken (wings) platter.  My husband likes their teriyaki and kalbi.

You get a generous portion whatever delicious meat you choose, and a generous amount of rice with a nice fresh cool salad (dunno what that dressing is but it is delicious).  

I normally get the spicy pork!  Wow it has a smoky flavor to it, tender and stir-fried in a spicy sauce.  I love it!  The chicken is good as well, very tender and grilled.  The teriyaki sauce is sweet but not too sweet and flavorful.  The beef is bulgogi and was good as well but not as great as I thought.  Stick with the chicken or spicy pork.

Also their gyozas are amazing.  Its fried and crispy with nice flavorful pork and veggies inside.  I love those as well.

My first impression was that it was very clean!  The cashier greeted me warmly and the menu was very straightforward.   They had chicken teriyaki on special, like $5 or so.  We had our 2-year-old son, so I was relieved to see that they had high chairs.  The Beatles were playing non-stop, and it was a happy little detail for me.  Our food arrived on big white platters, arranged beautifully in ample portions.  From first bite to last, the food was amazing.  The rice was cooked perfectly, the teriyaki was just right.

Located in some strip mall next to Aldi and Subway, this place didn&#39;t really stand out too much at first. Not inviting, to be honest. My friend took me here one time and now after more than 2 years later, I still come here regularly with my husband. We are devoted customers - we have brought friends to this place. We even ordered their catering plates when we had a gathering once. The husband always get the spicy pork, I sometimes switch around between chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu. DELICIOUS. Salad is fresh, the dressing makes it super yummy. We always try to grab the salad dressing and sweet &amp; sour sauce bottles from the counter but sometimes, no luck.

Our food order usually consists of a big beef, large onion ring, and large cheesy fries (well done), with a piece of chocolate cake for dessert.  
If you don&#39;t ask for your fries well done, they come out soggy and gross a lot.  The onion rings are very good, but you get less than a dozen in a large which I think is four bucks!
I used to love the Caesar salads, but the lettuce is mostly iceberg and not romaine which ruins it for me at least.  I haven&#39;t ordered one in over two years now so sorry if you fixed this issue.
The chocolate cake is amazing, but be careful when you take it out of a carry out bag...chances are the lid isn&#39;t attached to the plate properly and a giant mess is incoming.  And avoid the chocolate cake shake unless you are a fan of warm ice cream with giant chunks of frosty floating in it.
Even though our order is always simple, they find a way to miss something half the time (forget the cheese dip for my fries most recently, and two visits ago hot peppers were forgotten on my husbands beef.) When I tried to call just to get my name down for free cheese next visit, the phone rang indefinitely with no answer.  I know how many folks work there...you&#39;d think at least one of them could answer after twenty plus rings!

What I like about each location is that it&#39;s a fast pace atmosphere and there are people lined up in up to three separate lines but staff are taking orders while in line and then one you head to the front of the line, you hand your doggy bag that has your order to the cashier. Then the cashier will ring you up and send the doggy bag to the food preps and then shortly after that your order comes out. 

I am not sure how the drive thru works, but every time we come and it does not matter which location the drive thru is always busy with double line of cars and staff walking by each car to take their orders. I can imagine that it must be very similar to the inside ordering process. Either way it works for me. 

I have not tried their burgers or salads, pastas or anything else other than their Famous Italian Beef Sandwich! It&#39;s just to darn good to change it up. Maybe in the near future I will check it out but for now, I will continue to stick with the Italian Beef Sandwich.

It was recommended to me by the guy at the rental car place and it looked pretty well liked on yelp so I thought I&#39;d give it a try. I&#39;m glad I did. 

Fast service and great food for a fast food type place. I had the Italian beef sandwich with extra gravy, which was awesome. Savory beef with sweet peppers and just enough gravy to moisten the bread and infuse it will great flavor. I devoured it and was wishing it had been bigger. Fries were good too but nothing noteworthy. 

I also finished my meal with some chocolate cake. Pretty sure I didn&#39;t need those extra calories but it was worth it. The cake was moist and chocolatey and very smooth going down. Next time I&#39;ll have to try the chocolate cake shake. 

I&#39;m back in Chicago in 2 weeks. It&#39;ll be hard to avoid Portillo&#39;s next trip. See you soon."

Oh, you mean the fortress of awesomeness and staple of fast-casual food in the Western suburbs? Yeah. That place. It&#39;s busy, but the wait times are not bad. And, it&#39;s busy for a reason.

Let me just count the ways:
- Hot dogs
- Burgers
- Italian beef (sweet and hot peppers, and DIP that shiz!)
- Cheese fries
- Onion rings
- Breaded chicken sandwiches (droooool)
- Barnelli&#39;s Chopped Salad
- Barnelli&#39;s Chopped Salad (I said it twice because it&#39;s incredible)
- Barnelli&#39;s Chopped Salad (yep)

This location is particularly awesome because they give you a huge wedge of fresh bread with your Chopped Salad. Everything just tastes so good here!

Okay, we know the food is good. Let&#39;s build on it:
- Desserts (chocolate cake, cake shake...shut your mouth!)
- Beer (whaaaaaaaaat!)
- Drive thru
- Tons of seating

Finally, if you like cowboys, this place is Wild West themed. I have a showdown with my cheese fries whenever I go there and I WIN. Every. Single. Time."

It was my first time eating there so I wasn&#39;t sure what exactly to order but the girl at the register was really helpful with the menu. I decided that since I was in the Chicago area I would order a Chicago style hot dog and onion rings. I was afraid that one hot dog wasn&#39;t going to be filling but with all the toppings that come on a Chicago dog it was just enough! It was so delicious and the place was so kitschy that I can&#39;t wait to take my family here when they come into town!

I always go for the hamburger because it has the grill flavor. Their Halibut Fish Fillet sandwich is also worth trying. The tartar sauce and the meatiness of the fish fillet makes it worth the $5-ish sandwich. The atmosphere is decorated with an old-west type of decorations which bring about a unique eating experience. Will come back again!

Service and quality at Portillos are always exceptional. This location does get EXTREMELY busy at lunch and dinner and most hours in between but that place is a well-oiled machine.

I went through the drive through which maybe had about 5 cars in it.  They were getting ready for peak hours which I understand.  Someone takes your order via paper hands it to you give you a ticket.  Next person reads it off and then you go to pay.  This is where I was a little ticked.  These two Spanish ladies were more interested in talking to each other vs taking my credit card which I had out for about two minutes.   She walked as I followed the car in front of me to almost the window.  She finally then stopped talking to her friend and took my credit card.  Then someone else came running out to his post to help out and she had the audacity to say to him &#34;Finally Louis!!&#34; I was a little shocked because it took her 3 minutes to finally talk to me to take me credit card.  So I finished paying and got told to pull up to the window.  I am sorry but I hate when I have to go to the window to get my food.  The reason I go through the Portillo&#39;s drive through is to get served my food by an employee not me having half my short body out of the car because I can&#39;t reach your four and a half foot high window.  Oh and also I asked for no ice and I got ice.  Not a good experience today.  I get it, it was peak hours.  But you shouldn&#39;t be talking to someone when there is a customer in front of you waiting for your to finish your conversation.

Stopped by here, since I thought I heard(and I ended up being correct in the end) that Solemn Oath Brewery was BYO food, and I didn&#39;t want to go there on an empty stomach.

Friendly service, didn&#39;t take too long, and my chicken croissant sandwich and onion rings(decided to try that, instead of the usual fries. and I also view how good onion rings are, as a benchmark of how good a fast food place is....) were both really good. The onion rings definitely didn&#39;t disappoint, and passed my test! I don&#39;t like their policy of charging for bottled water(and decided for water, I&#39;d wait till I hit Solemn Oath to take care of that factor...), so that&#39;s the only small factor that sways me away from 4 stars. As it currently stands, 3.5 stars. If my review was alone about the food I ordered, I absolutely would&#39;ve went with 4 stars, since my food greatly hit the spot.

See you guys (more than likely, I wasn&#39;t too fond of the closest competing chain options for food) next time, whenever I choose to rehit up Solemn Oath and need to pregame with food beforehand. :)"

While they made the pasta they told me I was mistaken. The bacon was really a tomato. Sure. Tomatoes smell like smokey bacon these days. Very poor customer service. I am pretty sure the pasta was less expensive as well but I did not get a refund. I really liked their chopped salad too. Too bad. I will never return. Try The Patio instead.

I hadn&#39;t been there in many years, n when i asked him to point out a place to have dinner. He suggested to go to Portillo&#39;s.
The first thing i did was Yelping it. I was like ok, sounds good but it&#39;s fast food.
Went there not expecting much. Boy was I wrong. I ordered their signature Beef Sandwich. The beef was melt in your mouth good. 
What we really enjoyed also was the fact that this location had both Portillo&#39;s and Barnelli&#39;s Pasta Bowl. My friend was with me and she doesn&#39;t eat much meat. So we hopped over to Barnelli&#39;s to get their very delicious Veggie sandwich.

Plus
- Super cheap for what you get
- sandwiches are awesome including Veggies
- Has both Portillo&#39;s and Barnelli&#39;s in the same location
- Drive thru available
- Way better than expected for &#34;fast&#34; food.

Minus
- Cheese fries were super disappointing, i was hoping the cheese would be poured on the fries, but they give us a side of Cheese...
- There was a large LCD monitor that was scrolling through menu items, we got confused because as to what item belong to which restaurant (but again we were noobies to Portillo&#39;s)"

The Chopped Salad is also excellent and quickly becoming one of my favorites.

Portillo&#39;s has it down though. The drive thru is run like a military operation. You get in and out and no one gets hurt. Same goes for ordering inside as well. 

This place gets crowded though and finding an open table can be hard.

PORTILLO&#39;S has amazing buns, juicy wieners, and fantastic crinkle cut french fries. You&#39;ll put your order in at the Northeast corner of the restaurant, get handed a number, and have your meal ready within 5 minutes almost every time. I&#39;ve never tried the drive-thru, but it does seem to get very long. The inside is great though because they are pretty quick and the decorations are neat to look at while you eat.

I recommend the Jumbo hot dog over the regular sized for just a few cents more--definitely worth it. The chili dog is also fantastic, albeit very messy."

Why are some Portillo&#39;s better than others?  Let&#39;s admit that the food is pretty much the same, the offerings are pretty much the same (if it also has a Barnelli&#39;s).  So here&#39;s why this one is a cut above:
* Order Recognition - One of the best Portillos for ensuring you get the correct order even in the biggest of rushes.
* Private Room - A private room is stuffed off to the back right that is good for small gatherings.

Other than that, it&#39;s the same as most other Portillos!"

I don&#39;t want a Chicago Dog or a Polish, I want a simple double cheese burger with ketchup only.  I like the big beef sandwich of course who doesn&#39;t, but that does not tend to provide me the same sense of elation that this burger does.  When I compare the Portillos double cheese burger with Five Guys, Meatheads, or Smashburger... Portillos wins hands down every time.  The meat patties are large and the double gives you 2/3lb of burger.  The cheese slices are thick and are always slightly under-melted, so it isn&#39;t gooey and has a bit more flavor and bite to it.  The bun, which tastes like a potato bun, if probably just a white but provides the burger a bit extra sweetness and added structure to the mound of burger and cheese inside.  

I rarely ever get a side order since the burger is so large, but when I do the cheese fries hit the spot.  Also, for those who like malts and shakes, then strawberry malt is delicious and is a great way to end a meal.  

Portillos continues to be a place I crave and I look forward to eating here again very soon."

The decorations, lighting, and table set-up give this Portillo&#39;s a really nice, comfortable, and causal feel. It&#39;s one of those places that you would rather dine-in than get it to-go, just because being in there makes you feel so &#34;at home&#34;. Plus they have a lot of booths and closed-off areas that add to this feel. The interior and bathrooms are clean and taken care of, so no complaints there.

I usually get either the Italian Beef or the Chicago style hot dog with everything on it + fries (delish!). The great part about Portillo&#39;s is that your order is super customizable. You can add/subtract pretty much whatever you want and it doesn&#39;t really inconvenience anyone. The cashier takes your order on a Portillo&#39;s bag, then calls it out to the rest of the crew over mic. The staff has always been really friendly &amp; helpful, and they&#39;re pretty spot on with getting your order right.

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever ordered anything from the Barnelli&#39;s side, but they have a big selection as well."

If I could go back in time to my first trip to Chicagoland, I would punch my past self in the face and then offer a Portillo&#39;s Big Beef with hot peppers as amends.  I&#39;m pretty sure I could forgive my future self for showing the error of my choices.

I visited the frontier-themed location in Naperville.  The staff was friendly, my order was taken quickly, and after a short wait my number was called and I picked up my food.  The sandwich I ordered (Big Beef) came out on bread that had the perfect consistency of crusty/chewy with that burst of au jus without falling apart.  The beef itself was good, but was sliced so thin that it disintegrated before I could savor the flavor.  The hot pepper/celery/carrot/onion/cauliflower pickled mix was very new to me, and I don&#39;t believe I can go back to what I considered &#34;hot peppers&#34; prior.  Looking around there were a lot of customers, the traffic director in the drive-thru should have been my first clue to this place&#39;s popularity.  I appreciated that even with the amount of customers, the restaurant was clean, thanks to the staff that was working hard to keep it that way.  I look forward to my next trip, and if you are visiting the area- make sure to stop in and experience it for yourself!"

The staff does a great job keeping the place clean. I had the arrabiata, my wife had the chicken parm sandwich. My pasta was cooked just right, the sauce was spicy but very flavorful. My wife said her sandwich was really good and did not need anything at all.

My only complaint is that I cannot order from the Portillo&#39;s side while placing an order at the Barnelli&#39;s side. I was really in the mood for a beef sandwich but I did not feel like waiting in line a second time. This is the only reason I gave this place three stars."

And if I have to, it better to be California close enough to the one or two there.

Italian Beef, best around.  Dogs, be them hot or chili, best around.  Great fries, fantastic cheese fries.  It&#39;s the standard by which all other food is judged.  Just today I got a beef sandwich and thought &#34;this is really good, but for a dollar less I could have gotten it in half the time at Portillo&#39;s&#34;

Chili Dog, Italian Beef dipped with hot peppers, fries and a drink.  Delicious lunch, and if you play your cards right you have enough left over beef for a delicious midnight snack.

Food is ALWAYS prompt.  Tables ALWAYS get cleaned fast.  No exceptions.  And that&#39;s for EVERY Portillo&#39;s.  I&#39;ve never seen the service or quality of food slip; ever.

The few times I can pry myself from the Portillo&#39;s line into Barnelli&#39;s I&#39;m NEVER disappointed.  I can remember when I was a kid and it was Barney&#39;s Ribs.  And boy are those ribs goooood.  But even since the re-branding Barnelli&#39;s focus shifted from Ribs to Pastas and Salads.  All of which are great.   Salads are great because if you&#39;re eating light you can easily half the salad now, and finish it later.

Large mug of Miller Lite, slice of chocolate shake from the catering counter, and then send a tub of beef to my unfortunate friends who had the misfortune of moving from Chicago.

Let&#39;s face it, the first thing a college kid says when they come home is &#34;we&#39;re going to portillo&#39;s&#34;

If there was a 6 star rating, I would give it."

Which is why I&#39;m writing this review for all the non-midwestern travelers out there looking for some darn decent Chicago food!

Hubby &amp; I come here as a last resort when we&#39;re hungry or just in the mood for portillos. Fortunately this portillos also has a barnellis which has pastas and salads. Here are my recommendations: 
- Italian Beef (a MUST for a portillos newbie)
- a decent HAMBURGER . . . I love portillos hamburgers! they&#39;re lean, with huge slice of lettuce, tomato, topped with a darn good buttery bun and only $3.75! (*cheeseburger additional $.50) 
- chopped salad at barnellis (delicious! no other salad beats this one ---i swear by it)
- pesto pasta bowl--my favorite pasta at PORTILLOS
- Portillos award winning chocolate cake --- i&#39;m not a huge fan of cake, but this cake is delicious!!! seriously makes you want more. 

ALSO, the staff at this portillos is amazing! They are always friendly, quirky and funny when they call out your numbers. There&#39;s this one lady that will actually sing a rhyme when she calls out a number like &#34;number 5, it&#39;s time to fly high, your order has arrived!!!&#34; She&#39;s so hilarious...LOVE the enthusiasm of all the workers here. =)"

There&#39;s a few different ways to do it, but when you find it, it&#39;s manna from heaven.

Portillo&#39;s (10/9/2007) does their beef in the way I was raised to enjoy it.  Gonnella bread filled with slow roasted Italian beef and only the clear dark au jus.  I do mine &#34;dipped, no peppers&#34;.  This means that once they assemble the beef, they actually dip it into the vat that contains the au jus.  The messier the better!

My wife had the Double Cheeseburger with Bacon.  Burgers are FLAME grilled here and only made when ordered, so they are fantastic.  A double is 1/2 pound of meet and it comes on the ol&#39; corn dusted kaiser bun.

I think I&#39;ve seen numerous reviews of Portillo&#39;s french fries.  Crinkle cuts, always fresh (they must sell tons of fries a day) crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

This particular Portillo&#39;s is one of their hybrids, where they have regular Italian food available also through their Barnelli&#39;s window.  When you walk in the restaurant, you walk down the main center aisle and you go left if you want Portillo&#39;s and right if you want Barnelli&#39;s.  I think this is where this particular spot of theirs goes wrong (thus only 4 stars, not 5).  I do believe they aren&#39;t doing this moving forward as they open new locations, but if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that my wife and I both wanted Portillo&#39;s tonight, we would have had to stand in separate lines, pay separately and order our food.

I saw several families who had to order in shifts, or the parents split up and went in the different lines.  However I saw one couple where the woman actually reached across the velvet rope separating the lines to grab her husbands credit card, only to give it back to him as he went to place his order for Portillo&#39;s.

Otherwise, Portillo&#39;s is consistent, ALWAYS and the food makes me remember back to this little old stand in Chicago called Chick&#39;s, where you&#39;d get your beef and they&#39;d roll up a huge helping of fries with it all in one huge package.  Ahh, the old Vienna dog stands of old.  Where ARE they all going?"

I had to remind her about our cheesy bread after waiting 15 min and she forgot my brother in laws coke re fill. She also over charged me for an extra beer when we received our bill. I am not a friend of inconsistency but other then that she was ok.

Going back to the food we ordered Lasagna, and a 15&#34; sausage pizza and it came out in a timely manner and was very good. I really enjoyed the Lasagna my wife ordered and can say it was in my top 5. The pizza was pretty good but the crust was a bit thick for my liking and lacked favor. Overall, i was satisfied with the food but probably won&#39;t be a regular as the price is  high for Italian food in the area.

First time for me and second time for my husband but it&#39;s been a long time. Thought a quick dinner before the Hawks game sounded fun. Pizza seemed like a safe choice based on Yelp reviews. And we figured if you can&#39;t make a good pizza, we&#39;re not investing in the pasta/entrées. We had the Abbondanza pizza. Two people + 12in pizza=lots of leftovers. Very filling and tasted great! 

8 smaller booths and 2 long tables. It really is small inside. Bottled beer, wine available. Pasta, entrées and sandwiches available. We&#39;ll be back to try the pasta and entrées. 

Service was good. Really nice and friendly. Restaurant was full so we stood at the bar for a few minutes until a booth opened up. Short on time and parking lot is full? Order out. Definitely worth stopping in."

I did not eat;  not for any reason other than, trying to stay away from pasta. I know...an Italian restaurant-really? Well, I had thought I might be able to get eggplant parmigiano and nix the pasta. No luck. They do offer a chicken parm. but I just wasnt interested. 

Hubs had a penne abruzzo with spicy sausage (14.95), which was a fair portion and came with soup or salad and bread.
It was disappointing that the bread was not warmed. It was served with foil wrapped pats of butter, rather than the traditional olive oil and parmigiano.

Service was very good and quite attentive without being obnoxious.  It is the smallest restaurant we have been at in a while, if not, ever. You really feel as if you are having a home cooked meal at someone&#39;s home.  The owner puts on his playmix and makes the rounds to the regulars, who seem right at home. 

I believe we will return to try the pizza which looked rather hearty and delicious. The atmosphere is very homey but could do well with a good freshening of decor.
This is a no frills restaurant where you can get a simple meal, that is priced just a bit higher than what is appropriate."

Well I finally decided to place an order an pick it up, since it was on the way home from my wife&#39;s work. We ordered what yelper&#39;s talked most about, stuffed shells, cheesy bread, and a small half pepperoni half cheese pizza. Everything was pretty good. The stuffed shells came with 3 large shells covered in marinara and topped with a mountain of melted cheese. Delicious. The cheesy bread, which I thought was the star of the meal, was this French bread with butter and garlic topped with again, a monstrous amount of melty cheese. It was amazing. Lastly the pizza, you guessed it, cheese central. I really appreciated these guys don&#39;t skimp on the deliciousness and the quality. I mean if you&#39;re going to put pounds of cheese over everything it better taste good. I was a fan. The food is heavy and this a great joint to go to or pick up after a night of drinking or you just want some good ole cheese sauce and grease.

Yes, it is small inside. But it is comfortable and it seems most people pick-up, so getting a table is not a problem. From the second I walked in the service was great...both friendly and quick. I tried some of the bruschetta, antipasto salad, a shrimp pasta dish, their pizza, and tiramisu. I have not one complaint or criticism about any of what I tasted!

The staff were friendly enough. The food was okay, but reminded me more of a homemade style and less of restaurant quality. We tried the stuffed pizza. The pizza itself was ok, but the sauce tasted like it came out of a can and the crust was nothing amazing. The garlic bread was pretty good and the wings weren&#39;t bad, but then there was the Tiramisu. I think it was covered in Hershey&#39;s chocolate sauce and then had cherries and whip cream on top, kinda like an Ice cream Sundae?? The Tiramisu itself was ok, but I&#39;m pretty sure it should never be topped that way, just strange. At the very least no Chocolate sauce... 

My only other question is why they have an enormous bar that takes up a large portion of the dining area, when the restaurant is clearly not a bar!?!?

Overall, it&#39;s okay, but nothing extraordinary."

It&#39;s a small, quaint restaurant with no decor to write home about, but it&#39;s cozy and comfortable. Dim lighting and a darker interior just make you feel like you&#39;re in your living room eating Italian food! Nothing on the menu stuck out as my favorite and I haven&#39;t dined-in in years, but would definitely return.

The people who deliver the catering are very helpful in assembling all the food in the right way. Salads are huge with great dressings! I&#39;m note a huge mostaccioli fan but it&#39;s a standard catering dish, and they do it well."

We&#39;ve been patrons of Danelli&#39;s since the early 90&#39;s, and at their Yorkville location (which is unfortunately now closed).  This place is just so charming and quaint.  Their food is a bit bland, but has always tasted fresh, with super generous portions.  Their bread could be a bit fresher - or oven heated would be a nice touch.

Frankly, we think they may be struggling to stay open in today&#39;s economy, and would not be surprised if the order-taker is also the cook - thus the rather harried service.  But that only makes us want to patronize this place more as it has become a fixture in our culinary rotations over the years, and it would be a real shame if it were to ever close as there just aren&#39;t any places like this around any more in this area.

I had the lasagna which appealed to me based on using Italian sausage instead of ground beef.  It was tasty, but needed seasoning as other reviewers have mentioned.  Maybe a little oregano besides the parmesan cheese in the shaker jar.  It came with sliced italian bread that was a little on the stale side.

We also had a small cheese/sausage/pepperoni pizza.  The lasagna portion was so large we took most of the pizza home, which was very tasty the next day.

As another reviewer commented, it was cold inside the restaurant and not very comfortable."

We were waited on by a man who I suspect may have been cooking as well.  We asked for recommendations and was told the Lasagna was a favorite. We ordered the cheesy garlic bread for an appetizer and it was wonderful. Although the pizza smelled good we went with entrees. My husband ordered the lasagna and I the Chicken Parmesan. The lasagna looked nice but my husband thought the sauce could use a kick of seasoning. He did like the Italian sausage that was in it. I did not care for my Chicken Parmesan at all. It was just a cooked chicken breast, no breading, under sauce and cheese. It was dry, tough, and tasteless. The price for a glass of wine was a bit extreme considering the size of the glass. The room was a bit stuffy and humid making it a bit uncomfortable in there. We will probably go back and try the pizza. 

Don&#39;t get me wrong. The place is cute and has charm but the two entrees lacked that something special."

It&#39;s a very small, red-checker tableclothed neighborhood restaurant run by brothers.  The pizza and calzones are very good, as are the pasta dishes.  I did not care for the chicken parmesan as it was bland unbreaded chicken tenders, not a flavorful breaded chicken breast.  That is the only negative.  They recently revamped their salad which is much fresher and a nice mixture of greens, and the bread came out warm and crusty.  I would recommend having a bottle of olive oil and parmesan cheese at the table for the bread in addition to the little butter packets.  Being 100% Italian, I know good Italian food as my grandmother from Italy had a restaurant and was a great cook.  Danelli&#39;s provide good homemade recipes.

We live literally five blocks from the place and our landlord kept telling us that we must eat there. After driving by it, at least 100 times, we decided to try their menu. 

When we arrived there was NOT ONE OTHER PERSON in the place, which would seem indicative of the caliber of food. As we entered&#39; we noticed there was only one waitress working. From the moment we walked in she was eager to help and gave use great service. My husband asked for food suggestions and wanted to know what Danelli&#39;s is known for amongst its patrons. She let us know that if we were looking for something other than pizza, go for; the lasagna, sausage and peppers, or chicken Parmesan. Boy was she dead on! I do have to add, that when we tried to get our ticket it was difficult to find our waitress. I think that she felt that since we were her only customers, she could work on her other job duties and retreated to the kitchen. It was at least 5 -10 minutes before we saw her and could flag her down for our check.

My husband had the lasagna and said that he couldn&#39;t even identify all the different cheeses. The lasagna was obviously made from the freshest of ingredients and after it was cooked it was covered in, yet another layer of yummy cheese. After the lasagna was made, it was put back in the oven to bake and brown the cheese. Hot, fresh, and yummy. 

I ordered the Chicken Parmesan, which was also made from the freshest ingredients. Although it was tasty and the chicken did not seem processed was a little dry and there was no breading. The pasta and cheese were also seemingly made from love, then put in the oven to bake and brown. Again...hot, fresh, and kind of yummy. 

Overall... 

Service: Great. Yet I am not sure if it was great because we are the only ones in the joint or it is always that way. 

Food: Amazing Lasagna, Good Chicken Parmesan 

Beverages: Only Beer and Wine (and not a good selection)

A previous reviewer was spot on about the wine.  $5-$6 is not too bad a price for a glass of wine, but if it is vinegar-y old Woodbridge, then it&#39;s too much!  We may go back to try the pizza.

It was still almost 90 degrees outside but very pleasant inside.  The dinner salads that came with our meal were remarkably fresh.   I had the broccoli chicken cheese Alfredo that was on special.  It was delicious. Pasta was done just right.  My man had the spaghetti and meatballs (his stand by at Italian places).  He said the sauce was somewhat bland.  The portion was large and the pasta was done just right. (I hate soggy overdone pasta) good old chewey Italian bread came with the meal and was delish.

Flow: This is fast casual BBQ.  You get in the line and the food is provided to you as you move along.  There were a few folks in the line ahead of me, but it moved fast.  You pay at the end of the line. You can get bottled pops or fountain, if you get fountain, you&#39;ll make your way over to the self-serve pop dispenser.

Table/Utensils...  After that, get your own utensils from the handy dispensers near the pop dispenser.  I like this because they are sanitary.  No reusing utensils here. The tables hold a variety of BBQ sauces with explanations printed on the holder.  Plenty of rolled paper towel napkins are available.

Surroundings: The place is usually very clean, except for the trash area.  You&#39;re responsible for emptying your own trash, which is OK, but because meals are served on paper lined metal trays, and because this is BBQ, stuff gets a little yucky. The holes to peel off your paper into the trash are not big enough.

Service: The folks behind the counter are pleasant and helpful, and most importantly, smiling, and not on their phones!

Food: I went for the &#34;two meat&#34; combo and took the burnt ends and the brisket.  Comes with two sides.  I got baked beans and pecan cobbler.  The burnt ends were crisp and tender, and not fatty - loved them.  The brisket was just a tad dry for me, but had excellent flavor. Baked beans are top notch, and the pecan cobbler was moist and tasty. Oh, my Chocolate Cherry Almond milkshake was good enough to go back for all on its own!!

Bathrooms were clean and stocked.  Men&#39;s room has one little unusual thing, and that is that the urinals are mounted like six inches from the floor - they still do what they are supposed to do. 

Fast pleasant service, good food, good surroundings. Go check this place out for yourself.  A very good choice for fast BBQ."

Ordering the turkey was easy enough - and I selected this location for pickup since it&#39;s closer to me. The morning of the pickup, I ordered some additional items through their online system and planned to just quickly pick it all up at the scheduled time. Upon arrival, the staff was very nice and the turkey was ready to go, but they had no clue about the online order. I showed them my confirmation email and they were able to pull it up manually in their system, but needed some time to pull together the order. It was an additional 15 minute wait, so no biggie. 

The food itself was just ok. The turkey was pretty dry before we even reheated it. And it only had a very slight smokey flavor. For the most part, bland and dry throughout though. Even my 6 year-old noticed. We reheated it in our steam oven, which helped a bit but I was hoping for more...especially paying $74 (incl tax) for a small turkey. The St. Louis dry rub ribs were ok. The meat was difficult to get off the bone though. Actually, pretty tough. I had to tear meat off pretty forcefully with my teeth. Fries and chicken tenders were all fine. Pretty basic, nothing worth noting. The spinach and sweet potato sides were pretty good. 

These fast casual bbq dining chains seem to be hit or miss. I really was hoping for more here, after hearing those commercials quite often. You can definitely find better ribs in Chicagoland though..mostly from the hole in the wall spots. And I&#39;ll just stick to handling our turkeys at home. I really, really was hoping for better here."

I like the interior and atmosphere of the place-lively but not crazy.   Drink station had a lot of choices and they have a lot of varied sauces.

The meat was o.k.   Ribs, pulled pork and burnt ends are what I tried.   The burnt ends were less &#34;burnt&#34; than most I&#39;ve had but were tasty.  The other two meats were just average.  Spicy sauce was good on top.

Sides were good (the bbq beans) and subpar (mashed potatoes and gravy, which was blah) while my boys said the mac &#39;n cheese was good as were the home cut fries.  Brussels sprouts were o.k.

It&#39;s just east of the Oak Brook Square area on 22nd Street-easy to get to and a lot of parking-great location here as there aren&#39;t many similar places in that part of the Western burbs.  I&#39;ll go back again for sure as their menu including side choices is big."

Call it cheating -- but it was a huge hit with everyone. It was cheaper than getting all the ingredients and attempting to cook out own. And it was 100% better! Even the people who don&#39;t usually enjoy turkey had second helpings of it. It wasn&#39;t dry. Deliciously moist. We hardly had left overs. It was ready exactly when we wanted it. We brought home a hot turkey and it was ready to be eaten. Easy clean up for us too! We will be doing this every year now. Definitely recommend it!

I&#39;m definitely a fan!

Upon walking in there was so much to look at - the pig decor, the large menu and the silver cafeteria-style counter they have set up to order at. Previous reviewers were right, it will take you a hot minute to come to a decision on what to eat. They have several meats to choose from, a lot of delicious sounding sides, desserts, drinks, etc. 
The line went quickly and the folks at Real Urban were very nice. Instead of them assuming you&#39;ve been there before, they made sure to ask what kind of sauce, if you&#39;d like pickles/what kind of pickles, etc. They actually seem to care about your order which is definitely a plus.

I had ordered a pulled pork sandwich, a side of mac &amp; cheese and a side of cornbread. Everything is put on a shiny silver tray and looked absolutely delicious. They gave me tons of meat, a perfect amount of sauce, the mac &amp; cheese was decent and the moist cornbread was to die for. Overall, I REALLY enjoyed my meal. Ricky, my boyfriend, had ordered brisket, rib tips, a side of baked beans and the mac &amp; cheese and he enjoyed his food as well. I feel the prices are pretty fair for how much food you get.

The restaurant itself is very clean, spacious and the decor is very fun to look at. I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say I felt like I was in the South being there, but I loved the &#34;hip&#34; atmosphere and take on a barbecue restaurant. 

Overall, I really liked this place! I definitely recommend it if you&#39;re in the area and want some comfort food."

With the proteins, I have tried the burnt ends, Texas sausage, beef brisket, and pulled pork. The burnt ends are a delicate treat and personal favorite. With the higher fat content and collagen, the meat is particularly flavorful, tender, and juicy. So since they&#39;re the point ends of brisket, there is a limited quantity for serving and it does come with a slight premium price compared to the other items. The Texas sausage are a bit similar to kiełbasa Polska while the beef brisket and pulled pork can be a tidbit dry at times. I typically order my meats without the sauce so I can taste the smokiness first. For anybody dining in, bottles of barbecue sauce can be found on the tables. 

For the sides, I have also tried a variety: french fries, sweet potato souffle, golden corn bake, and mac and cheese. So you can either stick with the basics or try a little something different. I like all of them but I did leave wondering if the sweet potato souffle could include chopped pecans to give it a boost."

Fries, green beans and something called Hoe cake (which I believe is their version of cornbread).  Sweet, savory cornmeal with chunks of corn pieces.  It was moist which I liked.  Not too dry.

The total was $14.76 which is part of the reason for the two stars rating.  (In all honesty, even if the cost were more reasonable, my rating would have been no more than 3 stars.)

The brisket sandwich was just OK.  A nice smoke ring with subtle smoke flavor which is fine.  I don&#39;t need my taste buds assailed by smoke.  I couldn&#39;t detect much flavor from the bark rub which is too bad.  It&#39;s obvious that the brisket was slow cooked nicely but then put in a warmer grill because by the time it was served it was dry.  I always order Q dry and like to apply sauce as a condiment.  In this case, I had to use more sauce than I normally would like to.
The creamed spinach was a nice compliment to the brisket.

In summary, average BBQ at a premium price."

I can forgive expensive BBQ if it&#39;s worth the money, because I know it&#39;s hard to find here in Chicago. But $16.99 for a BBQ platter with maybe a quarter pound of brisket and a quarter pound of &#34;burnt ends&#34; is pretty hefty. My major gripe with this place is that they claim to have &#34;burnt ends&#34; when in reality it&#39;s just glorified chopped brisket.

Burnt ends should be the charred ends of brisket and should be carmelized and chewy. They grab their &#34;burnt ends&#34; by the handful out of a metal container and it&#39;s cold and limp with no caramelization or char whatsoever. Dousing it in BBQ sauce isn&#39;t going to let me forgive your sins."

The problem was, we went in around 6:30 pm for dinner and most of the meats were sold out, so everything he suggested I try wasn&#39;t even available. Pork, pulled chicken, turkey, brisket, burnt ends, and ribs, were all sold out already. They still had another couple of hours to go, not sure what they would have left by the end. 

The restaurant was clean, nice layout, and the staff was really friendly and helpful. 

We ended up getting 1/2 chicken and some sausage. I&#39;m not a super huge sausage fan, it&#39;s not something I&#39;d order for myself, but it was good. The 1/2 chicken was decent but nothing really stand-out. The price for the chicken was reasonable at least - $8.99 and included 2 individual sides. 

Normally in a BBQ place, I am not crazy about the sides. But these were probably some of the best sides I&#39;ve enjoyed. I tend to be a sucker for mac and cheese sides in general, this one was enjoyable. The cornbread was good, on the sweet side, with pieces of corn in it.  My husband ordered the nachos, which comes with your choice of meat (of what&#39;s left to choose anyway...), but we&#39;d probably pass on getting that again if we revisit. 

But we aren&#39;t really aren&#39;t driving to a BBQ place for the sides, and there wasn&#39;t enough of a draw from the BBQ side of things to reel us back in. Maybe if we can get there earlier in the day sometime on a weekend, we would give it another chance to hopefully have more meat options to try. I don&#39;t know if their dinners usually have such slim pickings or we just had bad luck."

Slab of Ribs - the first time I ordered them as &#34;perfection&#34; (Sauce and Memphis style BBQ rub). 2nd time I forgot and only got the sauce (wet) Will never order it again without the BBQ rub.

Burnt Ends - Was good wouldn&#39;t mind coming just for this by itself as well. 

Brisket - Probably would have like it better had it not been slathered with sauce on top but bbq cooked on it.

Sweet Potato Soufflé - my fav side sweet potato with marshmallows melted on top. it&#39;s...SWEET!

Golden Corn Bake - I actually don&#39;t really like the corn inside lol but love everything else about it. (slightly feel a little cheated as other BBQ joints like this give you a cornbread while letting you choose your side)

Onion Strings - Will get them in with ever order from now on.

Smoked Baked Beans - Shrug

Home-style Mac &amp; Cheese - Didn&#39;t like it however I&#39;m not a fan of the &#34;traditional&#34; creamy mac and cheese 

BBQ Sauce - Weird but I don&#39;t really like the BBQ sauces. I do like the Memphis rub which works with the original BBQ sauce but not without it for me.

The picture makes it look like much more than it was.  The brisket was good and the burnt ends are okay.  We also had a brisket sandwich which is a good size.

I like the pickles they serve.  They are sweet with a little spice to them.  The sweet potatoes are like the filling of a sweet potato pie whipped up and topped with marshmallows.  We consider them more like dessert than a side.

I was a little shocked at the price this time.  My son and I shared the combo which came with two sides, my daughter only had a side of mac n cheese, my husband had the brisket sandwich and a side, we also got an order of onion straws and 4 drinks.  It was almost $50.

I ordered the redneck taco.  It was a hoe cake with pulled pork and sauce. The hoe cake was delicious! I also ordered baked beans and Mac and cheese. The sides were good but I paid $3 for a 1/3 cup serving. They weren&#39;t $6 worth of good in any stretch of the imagination.

The pulled pork was dry and some pieces were hard they were so dry. There was very little smoke flavor but they&#39;re cooking on a pellet smoker so that&#39;s expected. The sauce is thick and overpowers any flavor the meat might have had.  It was not enjoyable.

Gave them a try the other day for lunch. $20 for their &#34;three meat combo&#34; plus two sides. Comparatively speaking, the price is about average, but that&#39;s considering the quality of product to be above reproach. Went with the Burnt Ends, 1/3 slab ribs (Baby Backs), and sausage. Visually appealing, albeit the portions were on the small side. Mac &#39;n cheese and brussel sprouts completed the combo. Here&#39;s where they fell:

BURNT ENDS - Decent, less seasoning than other respectable joints, more fat than most, only about a handful portion.
BABY BACKS - Ordered dry, only came with 4 ribs. Undersized, under-seasoned, overcooked. Thrown on the grill to warm up only dried them out more. Sucked.
SAUSAGE - Under-seasoned, undersized, only a tad bigger than a freaking hot dog with no bite. 
MAC N CHEESE - Reminiscent of Old Country Buffet&#39;s powder mac. Freaking atrocious.
BRUSSEL SPROUTS - Very bitter, bacon was inconsequential. No seasoning.

After the underwhelming combo, I checked out their ST. LOUIS SPARE RIBS - rubbed. $13 for a 1/2 slab was lofty, and they hardly lived up to expectations. Again, thrown on the grill, dried out and overcooked. Rub seasoning and flavor were decent, but again the ribs were undersized and overcooked. 

First, and last trip, to Real Urban Barbeque. Overpriced, overcooked, undersized, under-seasoned, and well below their competition. I guess when there&#39;s not much else around, they&#39;re bound to get some business. Hard to believe there&#39;s many repeat customers.

Its kind of hidden from the main road and tucked in back. They have cafeteria style serving like going on. A lot of options to choose from including chicken, beef brisket, and BBQ beef. Plenty of sides at a typical BBQ place like cornbread, Mac n cheese, and veggies. Portions are on the small side however."

I walked in and it smelled so so good I wanted to try everything. I was just staring at the menu when I spotted what looked to be a couple of regulars. I asked them for HELP, they both suggested the turkey and the chicken. I really wanted to try some ribs so I settled on the 3 meat combo for $18.99. This meal included 1/3 slab of ribs and then a choice of 2 other meats, I went with chicken on the bone and the turkey.

 Well what can I say? Two outta three ain&#39;t bad. The ribs we&#39;re tough and chewy, the turkey very dry and salty,  the chicken perfection. I would go back as the sauces we&#39;re great, service was great and the sides were wonderful. (Beans and brussel sprouts were my sides)

Portions could be bigger for the prices but like I said I would try this place again as the menu was full of choices."

Today it was nothing special unfortunately. Got the 2 meat combo. Turkey is very good seasoned and tender. Pulled pork is so bland and stringy. Not good at all. Mashed are a little loose with not a lot of flavor and gravy is boring in flavor. Wish I didn&#39;t make this choice today. $20 lunch was a waste. I expect much more tenderness and flavor for this price. A chunk of something dark flew out of the lemonade dispenser. Not as much care in food here as their other locations.

This is a really great spot.  We both got two meat plates and ordered some peach cobbler and a side of 3 hushpuppies.  All in, with drinks, it was about $45, but everything was excellent and the place is VERY clean.  I love that they have a sink in the open so you can easily wash hands, etc without having to go in the bathroom.

I had the turkey and burnt ends - with sweet sauce. Sides were the corn bake and sweet potato soufflé.  I kind of wish the sweet potatoes were more &#34;lumpy&#34; and less &#34;puffy&#34;, but the taste was good.  The corn bake is essentially a softer corn bread - could use a little more sugar, but also good and the kids loved both of these sides.  The sauce that comes with the hush puppies is like a siracha or jalapeno creamy heaven - SO GOOD, but be ready for some serious heat!  The husband had the brisket (he thought was just okay) and the ribs (he thought were amazing).  His sides were potato wedges and sweet potato.  Peach cobbler also very tasty, as was the &#34;lemon shake&#34; drink.  Pickles are offered on the plates - so many and so good!

Nice to also have an assist from staff in getting two high chairs to the table - and that they were clean (although the place is pretty new, so that helps)"

I had some issues the first time and these same problems were there the second time.  First off by the food was hardly luke warm.  The brisket was very good but very dry.  I shouldn&#39;t have to sauce the brisket to swallow it.  The ribs tasted awesome but we&#39;re kinda of dry.  The sausage was good.  I did not notice any steam coming out of the warmer where the meats sit in. Flavored were great but temps and moisture were off.  The hottest part of our meal was the cornbread.
Pulled pork sandwich was good but again it wasn&#39;t warm. Kids chicken tenders were great.  Sevice was great and very friendly. $7200"

I came in tonight not really knowing what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised with their contemporary &#34;BBQ house&#34; decor, tables and atmosphere,  The unmistakable aroma of bbq hits you right away as you enter and instantly makes you drool for everything they have to offer.

I ordered the burnt end and 1/2 chicken entree.  Both entrees were great.  The chicken was not as dry as I thought it would be, and with the BBQ sauce, it&#39;s so yummy.  Burnt ends taste so good, and so easy to eat, although I will definitely try a slab next time around.

Sides:

cole slaw - lightly dressed and not creamy like you find at your fatty fried chicken joints.  i like it!

golden corn bake - i would love to be buried in this and eat my way out ... 

brussel sprouts - great!  seasoned well, a tad over cooked ... maybe from sitting out, but still good

baked beans - pretty good, i would rather have two orders of the golden corn bake though

Must get - the spicy pickles!!!  the spice comes as you are finishing the pickle.. it&#39;s awesome!

I&#39;ll be back and can&#39;t wait!!"

So my son and I shared burnt ends and ribs with 3 sides.  Neither of us was a fan of the burnt ends.. it was super dry and stringy for us. The rib on just on the verge of being over cooked but that is mostly what we shared with their texas bbq sauce and their bbq mango sauce. My son loved the mac &amp; cheese, I was a fan of the corn pudding, and the cream of spinach was pretty good too.

The place is huge and each table had a good supply of paper towels, wet naps.and bbq sauce to try.. but what really stand out that I thought was a nice touch was the yok patty you get at the register.. and the open sink to wash your hands."

Very happy that we did.  Casual spot that serves a wide variety of BBQ and sides.  Tried the 3 meat combo and the fish tacos.  Ribs, brisket, burnt ends were all very good.

Not the best I&#39;ve ever had cause that was in the south or in texas. But overall very good. Unusual corn bread but I did like it. Mac n cheese not as creamy as I&#39;d like but good.

Didn&#39;t want to take a break from eating to breathe....  I decided to try Real Urban BBQ tonight on the recommendation of a friend...   He just moved up to best friend!!!!

Burnt ends are some.of the best BBQ meats around, but here in the Midwest, it seems like no one can cook them right...   

Until I came here....

Not only can they cook them right, they are masters of their meat!!!!!

BBQ sauce??  Don&#39;t even think about it...  You want to eat these burnt ends in all their &#39;naked&#39; glory!!!    Every bite is full of flavor.   Every bite is super tender, with the perfect ratio of crispy edges!!!

I chose Mac and Cheese and the creamiest, most delicious cole slaw that I have had in years!  Parking is abundant and there&#39;s easy in and out from their location near the intersection of South York and 22nd Street.  I would give this five stars, but I took a star away for not serving a bread like Texas toast or cornbread on the side.

Heard the owner on the radio &#39;raving&#34; about how crowded they are at lunch and how many smoked turkeys they sold over the holidays.  I don&#39;t get it.  Maybe the turkey is better than what I had.

We had ribs that required wrestling to get the meat.  Me.  .  .  I like the meat to fall off the bone so I can enjoy my meal and not focus on how quickly I will have to find some dental floss.

The &#34;creamy&#34;  cole slaw was on the vinegary side with large chunks of carrots, not creamy.  The French fries were so soggy and under cooked they went into the garbage.  Hubby thought the baked beans were just okay.  AND, even though the web site says that ALL  BBQ entrees come with 2 sides, that doesn&#39;t include the ribs, BUT includes the fish tacos.  They tasted barbequed to me.

IF  I ate here again, I would try one of the sandwiches and most likely skip the sides. although they might come WITH 2 sides."

I&#39;d been meaning to try this place since it opened and finally had the opportunity today. What I found was a great looking place with super friendly folks behind the counter and tasty food. 

I tried a two-meat combo with the burnt ends and the ribs. Both portions were plentiful. The meat was tasty and tender. Not over-cooked or under-cooked. 

The sauce was slightly sweeter than I would have liked, with a sugary after-taste. Maybe I just had too much, but next time I&#39;m going to order it on the side so I can add it myself. 

Next time, you say? Yes, absolutely. I would definitely give them another try. Some bbq places I&#39;m one and done with, but this one has definite potential and I&#39;ll be sure to work my way through the menu. 

Sides are good too. I did the brussel sprouts and corn cake. Both were good. Not the end-all, be-all, but definitely good and a great accompaniment to your meal. 

Prices seem pretty fair too. You&#39;re not going to break the bank here. Give them a try and enjoy some great food."

Now the major issue was I decided to return the ribs and asked them to just give me chicken instead.  They took the container and threw it away and have me another piece of chicken.  But,  my container still had chicken in it!  I only wanted to exchange the ribs.  I told the girl and she said it was nothing she could do.  So I asked her why did you throw it away in the first place?  She was like sorry I&#39;ll put some pulled chicken in there,  it&#39;s the same thing.

I had the pick three combo.  I chose a 1/4 dark smoked chicken, Texas sausage, and 1/3 rib made &#34;perfection&#34; style.  Perfection meant the ribs were prepared with a Memphis style dry rub and sauce on!  The smoked chicken was pretty good.  They serve smoked chicken wings with Franks Red Hot sauce - which is one of the best bottled buffalo wing sauces out there.  This combo also came with two sides - so I chose buttermilk mashed potatoes in chicken gravy and homestyle mac &amp; cheese.  They have a shit load of sides - sweet potato soufflé, hoe cakes, fries, grilled veggies, cornbread, baked beans.  Too many to try on your first visit.  


They have soda - like every classic soda that ever came from a glass bottle.  Everything from Green River, to Cherriwine, to Cream Soda, to Sarsaparilla, to Fanta. They also sell house made iced tea in Mason jars and get this....

you can bring that Mason jar back to the restaurant for FREE refills FOREVER!  I chose the watermelon iced tea.  My daughter chose the sweet tea with lemon.  We&#39;ll be back for our free refills!

For dessert - they have an assortment of yummy baked goods.  I chose a watermelon cake bite that tastes EXACTLY like a watermelon.  My daughter choose their red velvet cupcake.  Next time, I&#39;d like to try a whoopie pie.  Or some pie!  Or better yet - their pecan or peach cobbler!

I recommend the lemon shake up instead.
I got the BBQ Brisket, Smoked Baked Beans and french Fries.
The Beans were the best part. 
I had better BBQ from holes in the wall. 
I think because I did not notice a smoker (I&#39;m spoiled I had real BBQ)
that the taste was off.
It was like the BBQ you make in your oven, not at a traditional BBQ
not really worth the money."

After figuring out the menu with the Carvers help we chose to three meat platter along with the Hush puppies ( because they were mentioned here) the roasted Brussels sprouts the green beans and the corn bake.  

Portions were weak, the brisket could have has some moisture left in it.  It wasn&#39;t overcooked it was just sitting for a while.  That&#39;s why I said, we got in at a later time.  The burnt ends were real fatty.  Cut off the point is fine but some of the pieces were just not edible like a hunk of fat with BBQ sauce on it.  The ribs were the highlight, they have a great rub sprinkled over them which really sets them apart.  It&#39;s a sweet rub I&#39;m thinking dried brown sugar but that&#39;s what made the ribs.

The sides were good, we both liked the Brussels sprouts with the bacon, nice caramelized pieces, some were more done than others but that was just due to the sizes of the sprouts.  The beans, hericot verts were so much better than getting the thick commercial green beans like you find all over.  We both really liked the corn bake it was similar to fresh corn, creamed corn and jiffy corn meal mix all baked into a steam table pan.  The corn bake was a good addition.  Staff was attentive, upsold and just pleasant. 

Love the slop sink idea that&#39;s a good addition for us not so neat BBQ fans.  The ribs were good so go for the ribs.  I&#39;ll try them again but not for at least a couple months."

They have had their share of hurdles to get this beautiful location open. I&#39;ve experienced RUB&#39;s at Rib Fest Chicago (they took 2nd place and were featured on &#34;Anthony Anderson&#39;s America Eats&#34; on The Food Network) and recently at the Windy City Barbecue Classic. I&#39;ve had their Highland Park location bookmarked since they were on Chicago&#39;s Best TV, but never made it out there.

They offered free bbq for a year to the first in line and was certain if I got there before 8 am on this frigid morning I&#39;d be a shoe in. As soon as I rounded the corner at 7:45 am I spotted a guy walking towards the front door with a couple blankets... dang it, I should have got my breakfast to-go this morning. I decided to stay and keep Rick company, after all, we both did have a passion for good bbq.

Once the doors opened at 11 am the first 100 people received a free sandwich. I just had to buy a couple of their unique sides. Never seen Brussels Sprouts at a BBQ joint so those and their Sweet Potato Casserole made it to my tray. Love the cafeteria style service and they shuffle you through the different stations efficiently. They did add a nice additional dining room, with plans for a large outdoor patio come spring. 120+ seats inside with hopes for another 88 seats, once the patio is complete. 

Owner Jeff has a great crew and with this being their 3rd location, expect great things to come. They&#39;re adding new items to this location and I look forward to them adding Prime Rib to their menu. Great pickles too... there must be some horseradish in them."

Best for those looking for something fancier than McD&#39;s or Potbelly for lunch, but don&#39;t have the time for a full service meal. 

Ribs taste great, even if they are somewhat pricey. You also get free fountain drinks for life if you buy a mason jar drink. Not sure how they can tell the difference between their mason jars and any jar from Home Depot though..."

We frequent many BBQ places and this place was not impressive. First, bad country music is blasting, which doesn&#39;t align to the &#34;urban&#34; name.  The menu and ordering format is a bit confusing. Has a cafeteria style feel to it.  Our food didn&#39;t all come out together, so our kids were fidgeting while our sandwiches were getting cold. Once the food all arrived it was just ok. Pulled chicken was tender but the sandwich was too messy to pick up and eat. Sauce was tasty but very thin and runny, adding to the mess. Burnt ends were very fatty and not crispy. Mac n cheese was overcooked mushy slop. Fries were just ok. Chicken tenders were dry and chewy. Our kids love Q BBQ but they barely touched a bite of their food at RUB, which we understood why after we tried their meals. We will stick to Q next time."

The Brisket was well flavored and I had the sweet sauce who had a good flavor. The ribs were nothing special (better at the Patio) and they are clearly just heated up and slathered with sauce. The sides we had included cold slaw, baked beans, corn bread pudding which were edible. The inedible were mashed potatoes and hush puppies which were so over cooked. On the upside the onion strings were made to order and very good which combined with the brisket is why I gave 2 stars. Additionally it is pretty pricey for a cafeteria style environment."

It was terrible, but certainly not great. But the sides were fabulous. Corn bread and mac n cheese are both really good.

Hub and I both tried burnt end sandwich. To call them burnt ends was stretching it quite a bit. They weren&#39;t &#34;burnt&#34; and I don&#39;t think they were ends. They were 1.5 inch cubes of brisket that were not cooked enough. Bummer.

Food wasn&#39;t very hot. I enjoyed my sides (corn bake and dill potato salad), my son liked the prime rib special although it wasn&#39;t heated through and looked suspiciously premade (perfect grill marks yet cool). The shakes are good according to the boys and the lemonade was good too. 

Might give them a few months and try the pulled pork but was kind of bummed we spent $60 and no one was really happy with their meal."

We had the Memphis Rub, which was sweeter than I prefer. I might just go for the plain ribs as they have a nice selection of sauces at the tables. The coleslaw was good, but we did not try any other sides. They looked good. It was pricey for a casual step-to-the-counter place."

I really should have left at this point.  Good bbq doesn&#39;t need sauce, especially not that much.  I ordered a brisket sandwich without sauce and it was really flavorless; they clearly dump all of that sauce on the meat to give it some flavor.  The meat didn&#39;t have smoke rings and tasted like pot roast and the bark didn&#39;t even have any flavor.  To make matters worse the fries I ordered were undercooked.

I ordered a beef brisket sandwich with 2 sides. I of course forgot to mention I didn&#39;t want it on a gold plate, but they charged me for that anyway. 

I was charged $14 for a sandwich, a 1/3 cup of coleslaw and a 1/3 cup of mac &amp; cheese! Anywhere else the meal would have been at most $9.

The mac &amp; cheese was exceptional, but the coleslaw was vinegary and the meat was dry and overcooked. I just can&#39;t say the same about the sandwich, though. The server asked if I wanted some sauce on it. I said sure, not realizing that I would get so much sauce that it would overflow the container and my sandwich would be floating. The sandwich was so soggy I had to eat it with a fork.

RUB needs to refigure their recipes, pricing and portions. Their food isn&#39;t that exceptional that I wouldn&#39;t consider going to another BBQ place that&#39;s better and cheaper."

Then the sides area, filthy was where all of those side items were, asked if I could get the hush puppies for a side, told NO, it was an appetizer, cost the same 3 for 1.99.  Don&#39;t waste your money, they were the size of a quarter, with a spicy sauce, why a sauce for hush puppies?  Then got the baked beans.  When do you see red kidney beans normally in baked beans.  Terrible, everything cold.  The pulled pork was very fatty.  No one in the place and the fact that they cannot appease a customer was ridiculous.  Won&#39;t be back.

Pulled pork was chunks of rubbery pork not really &#34;pulled&#34; to my liking and the sauce was not very good.

Luckily no one was in so I could talk to Nicole and find out the story and understand her objectives. Since I vegan she ran me through the options I could work with but after chatting she offered to make me a veggie wrap using the gluten free brown rice wrap that is usually used for the sweet wraps. Spinach, Kale, Onion, Tomato, avocado, cabbage. She tossed it in grape seed  oil, lemon and pink Himalayan sea salt. I foolishly asked for hot sauce before I tried it and luckily she didn&#39;t have any. It tasted so fresh but not too veggie tasting. It was phenomenal.

Now you&#39;ve got me going she makes a broccoli vegetable soup, lentil soup and bone broth soup. All delicious! And if you haven&#39;t had enough healthy yet do a shot of wheatgrass. Just make sure to swish it around in your mouth for at least 15 seconds before you swallow it. That&#39;s for the person who has never done it yet it tastes much better when you neutralize the acid in your mouth by switching it around for 15 seconds before you swallow.

A small and chill Greek place that definitely gives you bang for the buck.  Great gifts can come in small packages. 

Decor:
The place isn&#39;t a fancy decorated place nor does it need to be since it&#39;s very clean and organized.  Depending on how busy it is it can be hard to find a seat but we were able to find a booth.  It was definitely packed which could attest to its popularity. 

Service:
Thr service is quick and to the point. You pick the food you want and you ask some questions and they answer it.  There is no wait service. So you&#39;re definitely telling them what you want on your plate and they fill it as you go. Think Subway. 

Food/Product:
The food was good.  The portions were definitely a very good size.  There were potatoes, meat, salad, rice and so on.  They definitely cover all the major food groups. 

Price:
This is the where this place truly shines.  Hard to find a place where you can get that much food for around $7. 

Overall experience/Conclusion:
Definitely a place where I&#39;d visit again.  They have a decent sized menu so they&#39;re definitely a lot of good items you can get for an excellent price."

Only $6.89 for a plate of 2 chicken kabobs, rice pilaf, 2 large wedges of potato, pita bread, and side salad.  Ridiculous prices.

The chicken was a little dry for my liking, but had a nice char grill flavor.  Everything else was good.  I wish I had some hummus or tzatziki sauce (is that how you spell it?).  Would&#39;ve made the chicken better.  I am going to try the beef next time.  Great value!"

While shopping in Geneva, I ate lunch at Just Kabobs and ordered a combination plate that comes with gyros and your choice of another meat (steak, pork, chicken or shrimp), so I went with the chicken. You get a nice pile of gyros, a skewer of chicken, rice pilaf, a side salad, potatoes and pita bread - but the real kicker is that it&#39;s all for $7.39. 

It seems that they are constantly grilling kabobs and have them hot and ready so you don&#39;t have to wait. 

OMG - everything was excellent. The gyros was probably some of the best I&#39;ve ever had (and I&#39;ve eaten at almost every Greek restaurant in Chicago) and the chicken kabob was so juicy and flavorful. I just wish this place was closer to home and I&#39;d be able to make more frequent visits.

The food was quickly prepared and delicious. Basically it was like eating at a family BBQ but in a McDonald&#39;s. I ordered some Nicky chicken and beef Kabobs resting nicely on a pile of rice with a boiled potato on the side. For the combination plate they also give you gyros meat and tiny pita slices.

Each plate features a huge helping of roasted potatoes and white rice and you only get a few bites of salad. The kabobs are good but they don&#39;t send me off into the stratosphere of kabob excellence. If you get more than one, I highly recommend getting a different kind (beef, pork, or chicken) as they are all good in their own way. My Mom is not diabetic and she would rate this at least four stars, but Mommy is not writing this review. A value oriented fast food experience is featured, so if you are already getting two kabobs it is inexpensive to add a third. They are good left over. Due to the fact that burgers, hot dogs, and falafel are not available the menu is limited."

2 grilled chicken kabobs, pita bread, sliced potatoes, rice, and a Greek salad for $6.39. The chicken was juicy, the salad was fresh and had a great house dressing, and warm pita bread always tastes great. Also, the grilled vegetable are really good. On a side note, I got an extra beef kabob for my dog, and suffice to say, it was gone in about ten seconds. For one thing that could be improved, the rice could use some more seasoning."

My mother-in-law mentioned that she enjoyed this spot, so I bookmarked it a while back. We were trying to decide on a casual, new to us spot and I saw Just Kabobs in the list. We took the 25 minute drive to give them a try. 

At first glance, I was nervous. They have a drive up window and the interior was similar to a McDonald&#39;s, Wendy&#39;s or a Taco Bell. I took one look at the food and my nervousness turned into joy. The food was very appealing to the eye. 

We ordered a combo plate with gyros and a chicken kabob and a steak kabob plate with an extra chicken kabob. Each plate comes with rice, potatoes and a salad. I preferred the steak kabobs to the chicken ones, but both were good. I preferred the rice to the potatoes. And the salad was fresh with a flavorful dressing. No complaints from me other than the non-exciting pita bread. I wish it was a little fresher. 

Overall, the meal was hot, fast and fresh. We will definitely add Just Kabobs to our rotation!"

I usually turn my nose up when my suburban friends rave about some &#34;amazing&#34; restaurant in the &#39;burbs. On occasion,  I&#39;m put in my place when I experience a suburban restaurant that far exceeds my expectations. Enough about my pompous personality, let&#39;s get to a restaurant review. I visited  my brother-in-law&#39;s house in Geneva, IL and he picked up some food from Just Kabobs. We had beef kabobs, chicken kabobs, rotisserie chicken, spicy feta, tzatziki and rice pilaf. I took my 1st bite of a beef kabob and wow....just wow. I&#39;m a beef guy but I decided to mosey over to the styrofoam container with the chicken kabob and took a a chunk of kabob and popped it into my mouth. It was juicy and just perfect.  It&#39;s not often that I prefer chicken over beef but Just Kabobs turned another one of my presumptions on it&#39;s head. The rotisserie chicken, spicy feta and tzatziki were excellent as was the rice pilaf. I am hard pressed to name a downtown Chicago Mediterranean restaurant that can compete with Just Kabobs. Now it&#39;s time for me to beg forgiveness from my suburban foodies.....this time."

Don&#39;t go during peak lunch/dinner hours or you won&#39;t be able to park, but don&#39;t let that stop you.  Find another time to go and you won&#39;t be disappointed.

I found it on Yelp a few years ago, but didn&#39;t even think of giving it a review for some reason.

This place is one of my favorite fast food places that I have ever been too.  If you are ever thinking to yourself that you wish there could be a fast food place that is actually on the healthier side... This is it!  It is healthier, but not at the cost of taste.  The food is amazing!!

So I was and often do some kind of Low Carb diets and wanted to find places where I could get some meat and salad.  They got that!

I wish they used romaine lettuce in their salads, but it could be better off that they don&#39;t cause I wouldn&#39;t want to eat anyplace other then this place... ever.  Their salads are a good size with low cost.  They only have two dressings, some kind of house (which I don&#39;t recall what type it was) and ranch.  The ranch is very good, thinner then most but tasty.

For the meats, I love their Chicken Skewers and often buy some to take home for a weekend, don&#39;t wanna do anything but throw something in the microwave and just veg out.

The best part about this place is that it is really affordable for the quality of food you get.

I do have to say that there was one time that I didn&#39;t find their bathrooms to be as clean as I&#39;d expect... but that was 1 out of at least 20 times going here.  So, I don&#39;t hold that against them, it could be I just walked in after some poor slob left."

They are always smiling, create a little bit of chit chat (the non-awkward type) and make sure you have everything you need.

It&#39;s all so simple but cooked and seasoned to perfection.
I adore their gyro and the pita they service with it.
I&#39;ve never had chicken, steak or shrimp here that was dry and over-cooked.

Roasted potatoes, what can you say about them, nothing special.  On top of being tough, the chicken was incredibly dry and totally lacking in any kind of flavor.  I asked them for a side of bbq sauce in the hopes of adding some flavor/moisture to the horrendous chicken, you would&#39;ve thought I was speaking another language, the guys behind the counter looked at me with a blank stare and gave me about a teaspoon of bbq sauce in a ridiculously tiny cup.  I asked for another little side of sauce, they gave it to me but not without a dirty look. Then in Spanish the guys behind the counter were saying, &#34;why does she need another sauce?&#34;  (Unbeknownst to them I speak Spanish fluently.).  On top of that their parking lot is ridiculously configured, I entered the wrong way and the guy behind the counter took it upon himself to call me out on this and said that I need to drive more carefully, I entered the wrong way.

Horribly dry, inferior food with poor customer service, employees who totally lack any people/customer service skills.  Heads up to this ridiculous place, Next time you want to talk about a customer in Spanish don&#39;t assume that they don&#39;t know Spanish merely because they have blonde hair/are light skinned."

Firm, fresh, and seasoned perfectly. The vegetables in the salad were also fresh and extra crispy which I love! The grilled vegetables too were perfectly seasoned and grilled. The assortment is full of veggie lovers favorites; mushroom caps, zucchini, peppers, and onions.. No skimping on servings here! And of course the warm pita brought it all together!!

I thought the house dressing was delicious too.

The meal was extremely pocketbook friendly- I paid $8.00 and that included a fountain beverage, and I was unable to finish all of the food.

Items that I&#39;ve tried:

chicken kabob value meal ($3.49) - chicken was seasoned and not dry. I opted for rice pilaf and potatoes rather than a salad or fries. The rice pilaf and potatoes were simply good, nothing complicated flavorwise.

shrimp kabob value meal (4.59) - good, but the chicken is better. The salad was satisfying with cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers. It comes with an Italian dressing if you don&#39;t mention a preference.

chicken tender value meal ($4.29 with 20 oz drink) - great value. It might be a small meal though for my brother, but the portions work for me.

I&#39;ve also tried their pork and beef kabobs. The pork was good, but the beef wasn&#39;t tender.

Heads up, they&#39;ll split a tray of 1/2 rice &amp; 1/2 potatoes if you dont want full one of each. Also, they used to do veggie kabobs, but they wouldn&#39;t stay on the sticks so now you can just order a tray of veggies, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s listed on the menu."

$ (Cheap Eats - Think McD&#39;s, BK, Wendy&#39;s, etc.)

Awesome local spot. I avoid fast food but this is a place worth stopping. It&#39;s different from the rest of the greasy fast food joints. The service is always quick and friendly, the food is refreshingly affordable and best of all, the food is delicious. I have eaten here four times and have only had one issue (hence why the 4 stars). One piece of chicken on one of the kabobs was hard, bony and cold. It was weird because the rest of the chicken on that skewer and in the rest of the meal was warm, seasoned, tender and delicious. It grossed me out but is the only time I&#39;ve had an issue like that here so I&#39;m still a fan! I definitely recommend if you&#39;re looking for a &#34;one dollar sign&#34; place to eat (as my wife and I like to say)."

We&#39;ve been coming to this restaurant for many years. The food is high quality! Our favorite server is Amy...she is wonderful!  She came to my rescue one time when I accidentally spilled a drink on our table. 

Every meal has been delightful. My favorites are the flatbread pizzas, the jambalaya and the sea bass. Amazing!

The martini&#39;s are amazing too...and the atmosphere is warm and inviting."

The Peaches and Cream pizza did not disappoint; the flavors of spiced peaches, macerated cherries, garlic cream, blue cheese, and arugula all complemented one another.  The crust is crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside, and not too thin.  I could not finish the pizza alone, so I took the leftovers home which heated up nicely the next day.  I devoured the goat cheese cheesecake (just TRY it!) it was not overly tangy as some described, the goat cheese flavor was extremely mild, and the cheesecake itself was creamy with a sweet and crunchy graham cracker crust.

Our server raved about the lobster bisque and pumpkin bisque.  I ordered the pumpkin bisque, which is a seasonal item, and if you&#39;re heading to Turf Room before the seasons change, you must order this!  He kindly warned us that there&#39;s a dash of jalapeno, which added only a slight spicy kick - you&#39;ve just got to be ready for it.  The bisque itself was thick and creamy, more like a pumpkin puree than bisque.  The spices and texture made for a delightful soup though.

I was disappointed with the parma ham appetizer.  This was a plate of prosciutto slices, a dab of whipped goat cheese and honey, and 4-5 small figs.  We were told the figs &#34;would go a long way&#34; if we cut them, but they were rock hard and too small to cut with butter knives.  The ratio of cheese &amp; figs to the prosciutto was way off.  I would not order this one again, and it especially was not worth $13.

I tried two cocktails.  I loved one, the &#34;Love Me Long Time,&#34; which had a laundry list of ingredients including sake and champagne, but the table side presentation was a bit elaborate and showy.  I just sat there, waiting...waiting...OK it was worth the wait.  I didn&#39;t like the &#34;Cool as a Cucumber&#34; at all, but I normally enjoy drinks like this.  It tasted way too strong, every sip was burning alcohol in my throat.

It&#39;s a breath of fresh air in the western suburbs since finding a restaurant for a proper celebration usually requires going a little farther from home.  The drinks are, without a doubt, overpriced for the area.  Freshly made cocktails or not, $13 a pop is downtown Chicago territory.  The dinner menu is a mix of items from sandwiches and pizza to steaks and chops.  I would have liked to try the lobster mac &amp; cheese, but $20 for a side dish is absurd. The two of us spent $100+ before tax/tip.  I would have not experienced sticker shock if I were in Chicago - so I can only imagine how many locals feel (especially those who rarely leave the Kane/DuPage area) when they see the menu.  Honest assessment:  the food is DAMN good and the prices mostly reflect that.  The drinks not so much - stick with their daily $4.50 beer and wine option!

The atmosphere is like a supper club.  The lighting is dim and casts shadows on faces.  A couple cozied up in the lounge by the fire pit.  The fire pit is pretty, but it is not practical.  After we got home, I immediately threw my clothes into the laundry.  My hair, and even my purse, absorbed some of the smoky odor.  It wasn&#39;t necessarily a bad smell, but getting dressed up to go out on Friday night, I did not expect to come home as if we&#39;d just enjoyed some Jiffy Pop and s&#39;mores.  The booths were like sitting on church pews; the seats were positioned far enough from the table that I was hunched over my plate.  

The Turf Room succeeds because of their excellent food, good drinks, and upscale atmosphere.  There is literally no competition in the area.  There are some comparable restaurants in Geneva and Naperville, but nothing in Aurora or North Aurora like Turf Room."

Our waitress looked annoyed everytime she came to the table and completly ignored my wife.

Nothing like having a meal with someone literally over your shoulder for the entire meal. 

Coffee and Juice not included in the price! WTF, Ive never been to brunch where i paid extra for coffee and juice. Hell you get that at cheesy hotel breakfast bars. 4.00 for a mostly ice filled glass of juice and 2.00 for an average cup of coffee at best.

So what did this wondeful experience cost? Just the high high price of 58.00. This was beyond ridiculous!

I cant recommend enough to stay away from this place for Brunch.

We have been coming here for years - our last visit was in the late summer.  We have always brought a bottle of wine and if you let the waiter taste your wine they will waive the corking fee.  Well when we came on Thursday the hostessed told us NO - we never do that.  We said we have been coming here for years and they always do that and she said NO - I am the OWNER and we NEVER do that EVER.  SHe was extremely RUDE - to the point that she told our waiter to specifically make sure that he added the $20 corkage fee and that it was not debatable.  She was the RUDEST OWNER I have ever met.

Now I do wish I would have spoke to her myself since this was my brother that brought the wine because I would have given her a piece of my mind - AND would remind her that her attitude was unwarranted and unnecessary.

We will NOT visit the restaurant again.  The food portions have gotten SMALLER and our turkey was cold when it came out - and really nothing special at all. Because of this women - you have lost three families that you to frequent your restaurant but no more."

The indoor sunken fire pit is my favorite place to grab a drink, app, and relax. The outdoor area has fire pits as well, which all offer heat when the night becomes a bit cold.

I went here for dinner with a few of the ladies from work and I was taken aback by how much everything was. I don&#39;t think any of the entrees were under $10. I settled on the ahi tuna salad, which has seared ahi tuna, fried brie cubes (that still had the rind on... ick), sliced apples, nuts, and spring mix. It was pretty good but I don&#39;t think it was almost $20 good. My co-workers got everything from the flatbread to the pastas, and they all seemed happy. I might have just picked a dud or let my cheapness influence my decision.

I will tell you one thing though: that goat cheese cheesecake is legit. It sounds disgusting but the goat cheese is so subtle that it just adds this little bit of earthy tang and it&#39;s rounded out by the blueberry topping. That was worth every penny."

I had made reservations for 2, and although there was a nice open table near the big fireplace, we were seated away from the fire near the back of the dining room.  The service was slow and impersonal.  We asked for a minute to look over the menu and didn&#39;t see the waiter for another 10 minutes.  He got our beer order wrong and the food wasn&#39;t as impressive as my first time here.

Filo Chicken $16 - The actual chicken was boring, but the sauce was good.  Unfortunately, the waiter didn&#39;t pack any of the sauce when I took my leftovers home.

Duck Pasta $18 - It looked really good, the noodles were cooked well, but I didn&#39;t enjoy the taste of the sauce that much.

Lobster Mac &amp; Cheese $13 - This was my favorite dish of the night!  It was buttery and delicious.  They should make one that&#39;s a dinner portion."

They also have a outside fireplace too in the summer, but it doesn&#39;t keep away the mosquitos.

The only place I found in the last 20 years that knows how to make a proper Lobster Bisque ... No flour thickner.   Whether the chef used the high end cheesecloth method or a touch of cornstarch, I couldn&#39;t tell, but as a GF option, omg, thank you.   It wasn&#39;t served in the traditional thin layer in a large bowl, but rather in a bowl that actually appeared to provide a substantial amount.  Again, thank you.  The only place that might compare is Brigtsen&#39;s on Dante Street in New Orleans.

I also had the Apple and Cheese Salad.  Wow.  Also not what I was expecting.  Thinking of some apple slices and cheese atop a green salad was my mistake.  I was served something that appeared to be an Asian Cole Slaw.  Holy cow, it was all julienned thin apple strings with similar Manchengo cheese interspersed.  I don&#39;t know how they did that, but my goodness, what a great combination of favors.     I also had the chicken on top ... It didn&#39;t need it."

As you arrive, the steel-etched sign with live flame welcomes you in. This theme continues whether you dine outside or eat in the dusky, comfortable dining room (so dusky that every other table was using their flashlight app to read the menu, but that&#39;s romantic, right?), as there are multiple wood-burning fireplaces throughout. If you enjoy a glass of wine, you&#39;ve come to the right place as they have a huge wine library. Their bar also mixes a delicious cocktail, many of them unique to Turf Room. 

The server welcomed us right away, telling us about their evening specials and answering all our questions. She returned almost immediately with drinks and hot bread (lightly sprinkled with smoked salt and served with maple herbed butter). I ordered Spanish Filo Chicken, my wife had Chicken Pesto Tortellini. Both were absolutely delicious. My chicken was made more delicious because whatever spices the chef used were very aromatic, adding to the amazing flavor palette. We were stuffed (the portions are very generous), so we skipped dessert, but the tasty treats at neighboring tables looked great.

If you plan on going, reservations aren&#39;t a must, but they are a good idea for a Friday or Saturday night. The atmosphere is a little upscale, but still casual. Diners were dressed in everything from jackets and ties to jeans and polos. A heads up, plan on spending $30-40 per person, add $10-15 if you&#39;re having drinks."

It was very disappointing, unfortunately. We&#39;ve been for dinner once and the food was phenomenal. Given the price of the brunch buffet, I&#39;d suggest ordering from the menu.

First, the food was lukewarm to cold. It seems that the chafing dishes (aka Sterno cans) weren&#39;t actually lit in many cases, probably because they didn&#39;t want the food drying out or overcooking. The prime rib was kind of hit-or-miss. The first piece I had was decent, but later portions were carved thin and were tough. We tried the made-to-order pizza, but sent it back - twice - because it was undercooked in the middle and doughy (I can just see the judges from The British Baking Show tearing it apart).

The manager comped both our meals, which I didn&#39;t think was necessary, but it was a nice gesture.

We&#39;ll be back, but probably not for brunch.

Some recommendations for the management:

1. Invest in some steam tables to keep your food hot.
2. Prebake your pizza crust a little, so the dough is fully cooked when it&#39;s brought to the table.
3. Add some more standard fare (fried potatoes) instead of the odd/fancy quiche-like thing.
4. Make the area where you serve the buffet a bit more conducive to traffic. It was as if you just shoved a few tables out of the way and crammed the buffet stations into a very tight space.
5. Make sure the prime rib isn&#39;t overdone. It&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s partially justifying the high price."

I love the Tempura Mushrooms as a side....mushrooms, bleu cheese, drenched in batter and fried?  Yes, please.  The meatloaf flight is a huge serving of three different meat loaves.  The drinks are generously stumble inducing.  I have a friend that can attest to this.  A couple martinis at The Turf Room and we need to prop her up to get to the car!

They are also quite accommodating for those with special dietary requests.  We have a friend that was (but no longer is, thank you!) vegan. They will also make a special dish to accommodate the diner.

I am only giving them 4 stars because I have had a dish where the chicken was dry and bland, but usually all is great!  Oh, and if you go, try and find the bathrooms.  I never know what to do.

Overall, it was a very positive dining experience with a nice menu that takes some creative risks that you don&#39;t often see in the suburbs.  We started with the Athena wantons, and they were good.  The flavor was unique.  My husband tried the pork chili (which I also sampled) and I had the lobster bisque.  Both were layered with flavor.  I had the jambalaya pasta.  It was good; the sauce was rich and flavorful with obvious Cajun influences.  My only complaint was that the texture of the andouille sausage was not as tender as andouille one would have in the south; however, this is certainly not a deal breaker for the plate.  The service was also fabulous.  Our server was attentive, and the restaurant staff takes dishes away at rapid speed.  I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back."

Our waiter was very friendly and pleasant . He told us all his personal favorites in each food category. The drinks took forever and he apologized , commenting that the bartender was very backed up. The martinis were huge and all in all, were spot on. 
Our two appetizers, the wontons and roasted grape crostini were very very average. To tell u the truth, no one at our table thought they were worth the price or anything special. 
Two of us ordered the pasta with scallops. It was tasty , but way too el dente. I had ordered a pear side salad, which was totally forgotten.  My water glass arrived with a big crack.

From the moment we arrived, the hostess (who may have been the owner) was so kind. While he had reservations via open table, we were about 20 minutes early. We bellied up to the bar and asked the bartenders thoughts. She was so helpful and ended up steering us toward an incredibly delicious margarita the don quijote. All drinks sounded delicious and I&#39;m not sure you could have gone wrong! All juice was fresh squeezed and the drinks shaken to order.

Our table was secluded and dark and just perfect for our evening away from our little ones. Michael, our waiter, was knowledgeable and genuinely wanted to help make the best of our dining choices. His suggestions were right on. Tuna tacos for appetizer was fresh and clean. So tasty!

I had the short ribs with magical potatoes. The terrine (sp) was so delicious I wanted more and more. The short ribs melted in my mouth. Husband had the prime rib with mashed potatoes. Delicious as well! 

Goat cheese cheesecake for dessert is a must. Holy cow. Unreal. On our reservation, I had noted it was husband&#39;s birthday. While I never mentioned it to the staff, the dessert arrived with a candle atop. What a great ending!

All in all, we had an exceptional experience from top to tail. The staff, proprietor and chef are top notch. The food is delicious and we&#39;ll composed. It was the perfect birthday dinner! 

Did I mention the magical potatoes? And the cheesecake? ;)"

I asked my server about vegan options and she recommended this forbidden black rice and vegetable dish that the chef whips up for vegan patrons. Oh.my.goodness. It was absolutely delicious! Perfectly spicy with crisp broccolini, mushrooms and a few other veggies. I was pleasantly surprised that they were so accommodating. My friend said her dish was really good too.

Have eaten here several times and have come to the realization that drinks, calamari and steak are the only thing I&#39;ll order in the future!
Appetizer of scallops were very under cooked- returned twice but they were still served &#39;gelatinous&#39;
Moroccan Kale sale was unique but interestingly crunchy. Raw sweet potatoes severed on a bed of kale with dried pineapple. That&#39;s how the menu should read!!
Tempura mushroom were good but I think they forgot to add the blue cheese...unless the menu is wrong. 
And the lobster mac had no flavor. Kraft Mac n cheese would have been an upgrade, and I&#39;m serious. Watered down with no flavor. 
On the upside our ribeye was cooked exactly as ordered (although the cut was all wrong at well under and inch thick) and the bartender made great drinks. Honestly the 1 star I gave was only because of her."

The food is very good, my biggest complaint (we have been here at least 5 times over the few years it&#39;s been there) is that the menu is just too fussy. Too many weird things in the sauces and every time I dine here I have a hard time finding something to get excited about. I am a bit of a closet picky eater and it seems like everything has one thing in it/on it that I don&#39;t like. I will say the flatbread we had, Margharita, was very nice. Big and delish as an appetizer then I had the chicken Caesar salad. Big and the chicken was nicely grilled. Service was good, very professional. I like this place, just not sure it&#39;s worth the high price tag. I have a pretty high tolerance for an expensive meal now and then, I am just not convinced this is a good value....Two appetizers and the salad, and one iced tea was $50 with the tip."

I had NO idea what to expect when I picked this place. I wanted a nice dinner for four people to celebrate an anniversary and two birthdays. I had skipped over this place in my research because it is an off track betting place and I didn&#39;t think it would fit the bill. It turns out there are three separate areas. The first is the off track betting, which we didn&#39;t try, the second is the wine bar, which we will be back to try, and the third is regular dining room where we sat. 
The service was fantastic! Kate got to know us throughout the meal, learned our pace and was happy to stick to it without making us feel rushed or wanting. She brought us tastes of wine when we were unsure and made fantastic suggestions when asked. She understood her menu and what a food / wine paring should be! Her suggestions were always stellar. At the end of dinner when we asked for a dessert menu, she brought us the two desserts she thought we would like with a candle in one for our celebration. She was so right! The French toast was melt in your mouth amazing! 
The little extras really made it special! Each Friday and Saturday night the chef tries new things and brings them out to the guests as complimentary dishes. They are small tasters. That night was a pea truffle puree, with peas and something green on top. Oh, so yummy! 
The wine selection is fantastic, if you want to order a bottle there are about 700 selections from which to choose. They have many lovely things by the glass including a chateauneuf du pape which is rare to find served by the glass. 
I wasn&#39;t given a steak knife with my filet, and I didn&#39;t need it! Just the way I like it! The Ahi Tuna was served on a bed of rice which was so unique and so good, that I never want it any other way. We also ordered the meatloaf with the wine flight which is totally worth trying! 
The atmosphere is dark and cozy. There is indoor and outdoor seating with fireplaces which is more casual, but a great place to have a drink and a long chat. The dining room is a little more dressy, but could still be casual as there is no official dress code. 
This place is a must visit if you like unique, high quality food with great service."

We made a reservation for 3pm on a Sunday, which was not needed. The hostess was friendly and we were sat in a nice booth towards the center of the restaurant. Since it was a Sunday, I was happy to find out there are T.Vs throughout the front part of the restaurant because even though we were not at the bar, my boyfriend and I could still glance over at the football games! (always a plus).

I loved the menu right away, it is like an old newspaper, really unique. What popped out to me right away was all the amazing martinis. They have something for every taste of martini or just cocktail lover. Alll totally unique, mixing ingredients that you might not think to mix together. I ordered the &#34;Love you long time sake sake&#34; (That name though haha ) It was perfect, all of my favorite things. Plum, Vodka, Sake, and champagne? YES PLEASE. My boyfriend is a beer drinker and they had a good selection of that as well. 

For lunch, we decided to split a few appetizer-sized items from the menu. Our waiter was very helpful with deciding on what to get an assured us that the three things would be enough (and they were!) We ordered the Calamari, Oui Oui little piggy flatbread, and the tempura mushrooms. Great choices! I try Calamari everywhere I go and this one was not too breaded, crispy and good. The flatbread was very flat, almost like a cracker, which, I also love. And anytime there is brie on a pizza I will get it. I was disappointed that the ham was in cube form, not really shaved, and it could have been cooked just a bit more to brown the cheese. The mushrooms were excellent, crispy, not greasy,and you usually can&#39;t go wrong with blue cheese. The aioli served under the mushrooms was AMAZING as well. 

This outing was for my birthday, the waiter brought out a complimentary dessert. I told him I was not a chocolate lover and he brought out a goat cheese cheese cake with blueberry gastrique. YUM.

Other Positives: Really cool, private bathrooms, each labeled for a different &#34;Old timey&#34; person. Fireplace and seating around it. Flat Screen t.vs in the bar and dinning room. Dim, romantic lighting. 

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the western suburbs, its a real treat to not have to go all the way to the city for a place like this. I can&#39;t wait to try the brunch."

There were 5 of us so I requested a table when they called to confirm and they told me no.  We were already assigned a booth.  Ok...today we were in a booth next to a table and every time they sat people at that table they requested to move.  They also added extra tables so where we sat in the bar we were blocked by tables and had a hard time getting to the buffet.

The food was ok.  I expected a lot more from them.  They only had plates on one of the buffet tables which was ridiculous.  I felt sorry for the one chef making the omelets as he was the only one doing so.  The prime rib was so rare that it would hardly cut...the fat was all left on too.

I&#39;ve been there numerous times before for drinks, appetizers and lunch but I&#39;ll never go back again.  They can keep their carnation...it wasn&#39;t worth it.  It was a great disappointment for my daughters first Mother&#39;s Day.

The service here has been consistenly terrible..

Last night was it for me. I went in there with my BFF for appetizers before going to a comedy club. The waiter was not only rude, but advised that there was a $4 up charge for carrots with our hummus. And, they would not give us the pita with it. So, essentially they want to charge us double for carrots and not give me the pita too? I&#39;m not sure about you, but last I checked, I could buy a large bag of carrots for a buck.  My friend got a little snippy with him as we have been coming here consistently for a while and this has never been the case. He was snippy back (customer is always right, no?) 

3 weeks ago I was here and had a filet with burnt sauce on it that tasted like garbage.

This place is amazing.  It&#39;s gourmet dining good enough for any foodie in North Aurora, of all places.

The menu changes periodically, but the staples stay on.  I&#39;ve been here for Brunch, Lunch and Dinner.

Brunch is awesome, with a great Prime Rib buffet.  They make you waffles fresh and the spread is just amazing in size.  I really need to go back one day, it was so good.

Lunch is great too... They have Kobe Beef Burgers that you call the toppings.  From traditional to Strawberry aioli.  So many different cheeses you won&#39;t believe it.  And, I love their home fries served in a can.

Dinner is good, but can get pretty pricey if you are throwing caution to the wind.  My wife once got a meatloaf flight, that had kobe beef and buffalo.

One identity is for race horsing enthusiasts.  It has an overall race horsing motif, with bathroom doors that look like stable doors, there is a bronze horse welcoming you into the bar.  And there is a complete bar section just for serious off track betting.  

Another identity is fine food and wine.  The meals are upscale dishes and the place has an impressive wine list.  There is even a bar in the back that&#39;s specifically dedicated to wine.  

Still another identity is a comfortable place to hang out.  There is a large stone fireplace you can sit around, a TV showing cable programming and blues music playing on the overhead speakers.  

The strange thing is each identity bleeds into the next, so while you are dressed up sitting enjoying a fine meal and wine, get down blues music is streaming overhead and there&#39;s a TV within eye shot showing something you&#39;d probably watch if you were eating left overs on your couch in your family room.  

And although the meals are meant to be upscale, I wasn&#39;t impressed with my prime rib-eye steak.  (I usually order filet when I get a steak so maybe rib eyes are just normally 10% fatty and less melt-in-your mouth tasty than a filet.)

Chef Sean was amazing, and when he left last year there was definitely a period of time where the new chef had not quite gotten his bearings. I can definitely say that is no longer the case. If you want delicious fine dining, this is the place. And the fact that a place like this is in North Aurora is the best.

First, the cocktails. They are expensive but worth every penny. They are larger cocktails, and they fill them to the brim. I mean that literally. They will eek every last drop out of the shaker. And they are fabulous. I have had the watermelon one which is refreshing and delicious, but my favorite is always the Mommy Dearest. My husband gets the Rye Go Home every time, and if you&#39;re a whiskey drinker that&#39;s the one.

The food is fantastic as well. Their menu changes throughout the year. For the appetizers, the flatbreads are just okay, but the hummus trio and the croquettes are pretty much standard for us when we go. For the entrees, the meatloaf flight is always a hit, even for people that aren&#39;t fans of meatloaf. They have different kinds of meat and sauces and sides and it&#39;s a great taster. The duck stroganoff is probably my favorite thing on the menu. Yes, it has grapes, and yes it has brussel sprouts and it may sound weird but trust me and get it. It&#39;s amazing. Their filet and the chilean sea bass are also delicious. I don&#39;t think I have had one bad thing on the menu. And they will often bring out tasting dishes of stuff the chef is trying out and that&#39;s always fun to try too. 

And finally dessert, I have had the sorbet and it&#39;s great, but if you get anything get the goat cheesecake. Who would think to put goat cheese in a cheesecake? And if you&#39;re not a fan of goat cheese don&#39;t worry about it, it does not taste like that, it just creates a more luscious and creamy cheesecake."

I&#39;m giving only 3 stars based on service and food quality/price point. Our dirty appetizer plates were left on the table after our entrees were delivered - the server never made an attempt to pick them up. Then we had to ask for clean silverware for our entrees.   Sounds picky but it&#39;s the small details that make a great dining experience. 

The food was ok but not what we expected based on the price and some of the other reviews. My sea bass was a nice cut and portion but lacked seasoning which was really too bad because it could have been awesome. At a $30 price I guess I was expecting something more. My husband had the meatloaf flight that he said was good. 

After dinner we had a cocktail by the great fireplace. Super cozy on a cold night. 

With all the great restaurants in the area I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ll be back. Wish the food was better and the staff gets some more training. So sad because it&#39;s a cool place."

Even though I had made a reservation, there was still about a 15 minute wait, they were apologetic and kept us posted.
The waitress rattled off the specials, was very courteous and efficient. I tried the crab ravioli and the reviews I read about it were spot on. My wife enjoyed the butternut squash gnochhi. The menu had an impressive selection and I&#39;ll make sure to return in the very near future to sample their other dishes.
Even though they were quite busy, appetizer, soup, bread and drink refills, and entrees were brought out in a timely fashion. We never felt rushed to leave the table, and our friends were very impressed.
It&#39;s always a very nice touch when one of the owners stops by to check how everything was and said a heartfelt thank you.
The place was a little pricey, but I felt I got my money&#39;s worth and will make this place a regular spot. It&#39;s a great place and very rarely do I tip in the 30% range...yes, the food and the service were that good."

It was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay smaller and down a few store fronts, if I remember correctly.  It  has expanded, added catering, and an outdoor patio, albeit in the parking lot next to the liquor store.  Fortunately, we had reservations because it was almost completely full.  We chose to dine inside.  Was that the best choice?  That&#39;s debatable.  They have as many tables as they possibly can inside.  That means the staff is constantly trying to avoid bumping into you.  They rearrange the tables to accommodate large parties.  All those people in a small space makes hearing close to impossible.  Noise level is very loud.
Now, to the food.  Not the best Italian I have ever had, but not the worst ~ it was okay, just okay.  They seem to serve their dishes with an abundance of olives and mushrooms.  Not 2 of my favorites.  They kindly prepared my dish minus a few items ~ that was nice.  Others had 2 different chicken dishes, which my husband reported as  &#34;just okay &#34; (and he&#39;s Italian).  We did enjoy our gelato for dessert.

We had the opportunity to work with John from Angeli&#39;s Restaurant and he was a complete pleasure to work with!  He was kind, responsive and very organized.  We felt completely at ease when we met with him and could tell that we were in good hands! 

The day of the wedding, the food was even more delicious than I remembered from our tasting!  We chose 4 appetizers to serve: butternut squash gnocchi, asparagus and prosciutto, bruschetta and bacon wrapped dates!  Each of these was mouth-watering good!  For dinner, guests had the choice of ordering either eggplant parmesan or chicken margarita.  We also served family style pasta at the dinner table.  Friends and family came up to us throughout the night and exclaimed how delicious the food was and some even said the eggplant parmasean was the best they ever had!  I ordered this for my meal and would have to agree! 

Throughout the evening John checked up with us to see if we needed anything and just made sure we were having a wonderful time.  I thought this was a nice touch.  His staff was also very professional and courteous.  One of the staff even brought an appetizer platter out to us while we were taking pictures during our cocktail hour!

We had a wonderful experience using Angeli&#39;s Restaurant for our wedding and highly recommend them to for weddings or a delicious meal in their restaurant!"

We have an infant at home, so we decided to order take out, which is typically something of a risk, but we figured good Italian should be fine in the 5 minutes it would take to bring it home. However, the problems we had were definitely not from sitting too long in the car. 
We ordered the mozzarella sticks, chicken parmigiana, and gambretti and broccoli with white wine sauce. It came with minestrone soup, which was actually quite good. However, once we opened up the rest of the food, it all went quickly downhill. The mozzarella sticks were hardly warm and didn&#39;t look like they&#39;d ever been melted. But the kicker was the bed of &#34;lettuce&#34; they sat on. It was completely brown, and looked like it&#39;d been days since any of it was fresh. Then came the entrees. The chicken parmigiana was a little too salty, and didn&#39;t really have any great flavor besides that. The gambretti and broccoli was just terrible. The pasta was really bland, with hardly any sauce, and the shrimp and broccoli were just placed on top of the pasta without any attempt to mix flavors. The broccoli was steamed and tasteless, though the shrimp by itself was actually decent. Also, the bread that it came with was stale. 
All in all, a disappointing experience, especially when celebrating a birthday. Not sure if they gave us sub-par food due to it being a take-out order, but we were thoroughly unimpressed. Olive Garden or Maggiano&#39;s would&#39;ve been better choices."

Joe&#39;s recommendation on the cabernet I ordered definitely hit the spot.  I ordered the lasagna.  I would definitely pass on it next time.  Too much salt was thrown on it after it was baked.  I could definitely taste it.  The good news is the portions are huge and the food tastes better after taking it home.  I had a relaxing evening and would&#39;ve stayed longer if I was there with a date or even a group of friends.  Definitely a warm and welcoming atmosphere. I&#39;d drop by again to try the other dishes.
angelis-restaurant-naperville,Heidi K.,oz-Kfz_tDfPQE19CsZy_tg,"Naperville, IL",1,1,1,41,98,HwpMz24dvRA1uUAu0D8fjA,4.0,2015-02-08,"Angeli&#39;s was &#34;my&#34; pick for our monthly dinner with the MIL. After last month&#39;s disappointing experience, I was apprehensive about my selection. Luckily for me, our expectations were met and my choice was validated.

We arrived around 7:15 or so on Friday night.  We had a brief ten minute wait, so we stood in the bar. The bar area is beautiful, and was full of patrons enjoying appetizers, drinks, and the Blackhawks game. When our table was ready, a nice gentleman (who I presume to the be owner) escorted us to our table.

Now, yes- the dining area is extremely crowded. You can almost brush elbows with the neighboring tables.  Luckily we had a table against the wall so it wasn&#39;t so bad. And yes, it&#39;s a bit dated. But I loved the lights strung across the dimly lit room; it created quite a cozy and romantic atmosphere. 

Our waitress was Tiffany. We browsed the menu (which contains more items on it than the online version), ordered our drinks and decided to place our appetizer order at the same. We tried:

Artichoke Alfredo - a HUGE platter of artichoke hearts and Parmesan cheese in an Alfredo sauce, with slices of garlic toast for dipping. This was so incredibly good! The garlic toast was perfectly crisp and the dip itself was flavorful and the perfect temperature. 

Antipasto Della Casa - a nice assortment of green olives, peppadew peppers, cheeses, and meats (salami and capicola, I believe). There was a small bunch of purple grapes as well. The fruit was fresh, the quality meats and cheeses were savory, and the peppadews were amazing. They were the mild variety, so they were sweet with barely detectable heat. 

Grilled Calamari - Oh. My. GAWD. This had to be the best appetizer I&#39;ve ever had. The calamari was grilled perfectly and was garnished with capers and tomatoes in a lemon butter sauce. I could have eaten this stuff all night. Highly, highly recommended!

All of the appetizers are large portions, no stinginess here. It&#39;s easy to fill up on them alone.

Tiffany returned to take our entree orders, and although I had my eye set on a particular menu item, I decided to try something off of their &#34;Sneak Preview&#34; menu, which are new items to be introduced this year. Entrees:

Chicken Giardiniera -Two enormous breaded, boneless chicken breasts in a garlic wine sauce. Sitting atop a large bed of angel hair pasta, the dish is generously sprinkled with a house made giardiniera. While the giardiniera was described as semi-spicy, I thought it was very flavorful but not spicy. But that&#39;s my taste buds. I opted for the house salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing over the soup choices.

Filet Pepe Verde - a grilled filet sitting in a beautiful pool of Brandy cream sauce and garnished with peppercorns. This was M&#39;s pick, and he chose the pasta e fagioli soup (no &#34;rabbit food&#34; for him).

Crab Ravioli - this was my MIL&#39;s entree. The ravioli is topped with shrimp, scallops, and peapods in a lobster cream sauce. She decided to have a house salad with a garlic dressing.

The salads and soup arrived and we dug in. The salads were fresh, crisp, and refreshing. M stated the soup was quite good, but didn&#39;t finish it, trying to save room for his entree.

Our meals arrived about ten minutes after we finished the salads and soup, which was perfect. We managed to eat as much as possible, but thanks to the appetizers, we hardly put a dent in our meals. However, we thoroughly enjoyed the leftovers the next day.

Tiffany was wonderful. She was didn&#39;t hover over us constantly but didn&#39;t disappear for periods of time, either. The busboys kept our waters filled and promptly removed our spent appetizer dishes. 

Overall, we really enjoyed our experience at Angeli&#39;s and I look forward to returning soon."

Easy parking in the adjacent parking is always good and appreciated on a rainy night.

Friday was crowded but found a spot at the bar. The bartender was super friendly and quickly took our order.  

A very short time later we were seated. Our server was nice and efficient.

To the important part- the food.  We ordered pasta with peas, scallops with pasta and a fish dish.

The pasta sounds odd but was delicious  with a vodka and sausage sauce. The scallops could be the biggest and best I have ever had.  Of course the price tag goes along with colossal sized scallops.

Excellent wine selection.

One thing happened that I always appreciate.  The owner stopped by to check on us and to chat. Nice touch.

So what has transformed here?

Ambiance baby. Ambiance. 

The restaurant itself is expanded, redecorated and more spacious from one table to the next. Good place for a date. 

The patio is also expanded. So while you are in a strip mall, at least you&#39;re outside in a covered deck. Nice. 

Finally the bar itself is huge. Plenty of tables and seating around the bar. Music piped in and bartenders that pay attention to you.

The service as far as keeping our water filled and bread basket, that was great. As far as our waitress, I felt a bit rushed. I was barely done with dinner and they were cleaning up our plates with our bites still in our mouths. Our drinks were taken away before we could finish and the waitress was counting her money while we were still sitting at the table. As far as the atmosphere, it feels cozy, however, it def needs an update. The ceiling looks likes it&#39;s going to cave in from being old or maybe water damage.

We were really worried that the wait was going to be long, but fortunately, it was only 20 minutes. Previously, we wanted to try out Clara&#39;s at Seven Bridges, but the wait there was 45 minutes to an hour (yuck). So, we looked online for another Italian place and found Angeli&#39;s. 

I think the wait is really the only reason why I knocked a star off. We were there around 7pm, and there was absolutely nowhere to sit and wait. The bar was too full, and people were lining up against the wall at the front desk. I really recommend that they re-arrange the waiting area, maybe offer some chairs or even just a corner for people to wait at. It becomes awkward pretty quickly when you&#39;re shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers, waiting for a table. People also seemed to be really scattered, trying to find some place to wait. The host (possibly manager) had to run around a few times to try and find the next group of customers to seat. So clearly, there&#39;s some opportunity to organize traffic. 

Once we were seated, the rest of our experience was fantastic. Our server was just an absolute joy, and he was extremely knowledgeable about the food. The dishes we ordered were amazing. I had the Pescatori, and my boyfriend had the Eggplant Parmigiana. The seafood in the Pescatori was cooked to perfection, and my boyfriend swears it was the best parmigiana he&#39;s ever had. We were absolutely stuffed by the end of our dinner, but ordered two cannolis to take home. Order the cannoli. You NEED to try the cannoli. No joke, one of the best we&#39;ve ever had. The wine list is also fantastic. You won&#39;t be disappointed with their choices. 

Overall, we will definitely be coming back whenever we have a craving for Italian again. Hopefully next time, we can come in on a not-so busy night."

I ordered the Chicken Gardinara.  It was a single pre breaded, frozen chicken breast cut in half on top of some angel hair pasta.  Can you say lazy chef.. Who uses a frozen chicken patty as an entrée in a real Italian restaurant?  So sad, my wife had the chicken vesuvio but it  was off as well, overloaded with black pepper.

I&#39;m sad to see this decline in food quality, maybe we just got a bum deal on a Sunday night."

They recently built a new side with a great looking bar and lots of tables. Italian food can be hot or miss but this place hits home runs. I love family runs businesses because of the attention to detail. This is someone&#39;s baby which sometimes gets lost in corporate run establishments. The service is great and the owners are there most of the time and have the awareness to remember your name when you become a repeat customer. Great touch. The food is spectacular. Great portions and flavors are spectacular. Always love coming here. Don&#39;t pass this place up

John even showed up during the evening to make sure things were going great! Andy (one of the owners) was part of the staff and went above and beyond!

Winner. Sat at the bar on my first visit and watched the Cubs game. Had 2 glasses of wine at $7 each and the chicken piccata ($18.95) which came with soup or salad. I went with the salad (generous size) and house dressing (a delicious balsamic vinaigrette).  The chicken picatta was delightful, smothered in capers (yum) and served with fettuccine and fresh steamed veggies. I also couldn&#39;t help but eat 3/4 of the warm Italian bread they brought me- the best.  Will def be back."

If you&#39;re a fan of Italian, it&#39;s well worth the trip. It isn&#39;t too pricy, has a nice wine list, has a varied menu (that takes it beyond just pasta and classic sauces that some Italian restaurants get stuck on)."

Wonderful service, friendly old fashioned ( unfortunately) servers who really care that you have a good time at the restaurant, owner who makes a point of walking around and introducing himself.

I had the artichoke ravioli once and it was great, had the shells next time and they were ok. The salads and soups are very good and bread yummy.

We walked in and were quickly seated. Our waitress was very nice, but made mention that we were at a table that was reserved for a party of 6 coming in 45 mins. No big deal as we were kind of in a hurry anyhow. 

We placed an appetizer order of their house trio. The calamari was FABULOUS! Meaty, thick chunks lightly breaded and fried - delicious. The toasted ravioli was okay. The bruchetta was a bit oniony and seemed to lack a lil balsamic kick. 

Hubby ordered Chicken Vesuvio. Not bad - but the potatoes were the star of his plate. I ordered Chicken Marsala. It was passable. The chicken was a bit tough and there really wasn&#39;t much sauce.  

I was disappointed because I feel like the kitchen really wasn&#39;t making the plates to order.  I figure they had a chaffing dish of cooked chicken breasts, and then had pans of sauces. The flavor wants cooked in at all. 

We won&#39;t return."

Obviously well trained. Four young people clearing plates and filling waters, in a relatively small place. Wait person was polite but not too chatty. Nice wine list. Great bread. Owner stopped by to check on things, and seemed like he was genuinely interested, as opposed to glad handing. I&#39;ll be back. Too well executed to not give this place more business.

This is a traditional old school Italian restaurant with delicious food.  I came with a group of 20 and everyone&#39;s dish made me want to come back. They have warm crusty bread with oil/cheese that keeps coming noon stop. I had salmon with artichokes, spinach and asparagus very good if you like cream sauce. I tasted the spicy shrimp over bow tie pasta in spicy diavolo sauce that was worth going back for. The filet with spinach and a side of pasta was a gorgeous plate very generous portion that I heard was amazing. Yes I will be back!!!"

My first time there I got the lasagna which was good but rather plain actually. The ingredients were good but they came together to really not taste like much. It didn&#39;t help that the dish came with some steamed broccoli and carrots - plain plain and more plain. It was a decent portion, but I couldn&#39;t recommend getting it because it lacked flavor.

The next time I was there, I had the penne vodka which was much better than the lasagna. It was a very good vodka creme sauce and the penne was cooked well. I would definitely get it again.

I also want to comment on the atmosphere - it&#39;s really rather strange. On the one side you have a bar which is small but nice. On the other side you have these tables that are trying to be formal but end up rather strewn about the room because they are so easily moved. You also end up sitting awkwardly close to everyone around you because it&#39;s a small place. I suppose that is the homey Italian feel, but Angeli&#39;s doesn&#39;t actually have that homey Italian atmosphere, it just doesn&#39;t."

We made reservations, which I recommend. There&#39;s a kitschy mural on the wall. I&#39;d say on the &#34;dress-up-o-meter&#34; this place is Olive Garden level. You sit down with a loaf of bread -- oil and parmesan are on the table if you&#39;re inclined. No beer on tap. There are gluten-free options. I had soup before my meal which tasted like it was out of a can. The &#34;Nonna&#34; is like a deep fried calzone -- my husband likes it, but it takes a long time to cook, and he passed this time. I had pasta with vodka sauce and Italian sausage. It was good but unremarkable. The service was pretty bad, including a waitress who never came around to fill our drinks or check up on us. 

Overall, if it&#39;s Italian food in Naperville, go to Francesca&#39;s or Rosebud. Sure this place has some charm and is family owned, but your dining experience will be more memorable."

As Out-of-Towners, we arrived at Angeli&#39;s restaurant stressed out, hungry and in a hurry.  We left well fed, happy and relaxed, due to the amazing staff and delicious food.  

We had tickets to a 7:30 show and arrived at another restaurant at 5:45 only to find standing room only and no promise that we could be finished by 7:30.  That staff couldn&#39;t even recommend any other restaurants in the area to try.   

Discouraged we took to the road with no idea of where to go, with a hungry teenager and running out of time.   Luckily, we found Angeli&#39;s, and they were busy too, but with a understanding and helpful attitude.  We explained our story and they got right down to helping us out.  

The wait staff was professional and quick to help us get going.   We ordered a fried calamari that was served piping hot, a Special Angeli&#39;s Pizza, that was delicious, and a perfectly dressed Caesar salad.  

Thank you to everyone who worked last night for your understanding and comforting way.   I only wish we lived close enough to enjoy your hospitality and great food on a weekly basis."

We had reservations, which weren&#39;t really necessary, but since the place is kinda small, make &#39;em if you want to be assured of a table. A seat in the back area provided some quiet and removal from the chill by the door. 

Our waiter was knowledgeable but casual, swinging his pepper mill authoritatively like a beat cop with a night stick. 

The food was very good. A seafood bisque to start was good though definitely not the star of the show. As for the entrees, my companion&#39;s chicken marsala had an incredible depth of flavor and was accompanied with a tangle of veggies. I made the unusual choice of butternut squash ravioli in a cream sauce: if you like sweet dishes at all, take a chance on this one! While very rich, it was very unique, filling, and almost like a combo of dinner and dessert! 

In a world of too many chain restaurants, this little place is one to remember. Check it out; you may well have an angelic experience."

We started off with the artichoke alfredo and were absolutely blown away... not to mention full!  But of course saved room for a few bites of our entrees! My husband got something with the vodka sauce which was amaze.  But I gotta say, my butternut squash gnocchi stole the show. Holy hell, I have never had such good gnocchi in my life. My mouth literally waters every single time I drive past this restaurant and think about it.  I cannot wait to come back !!

Our server was a little awkward and kept telling us the price of each item and each additional item we wanted.  I didn&#39;t see the need for him to keep pointing out the prices over and over.  But whatever, I&#39;m def coming back regardless !

The older woman in the front was really sweet as well.  She informed us that they were going to expand the restaurant in the future, which will be a great step and will hopefully add some needed windows to the restaurant.

We called ahead and made reservations for 7:30PM.  When we got to the restaurant, it was pretty packed.  We let the host know we were here, he told us he would be with us in just a few minutes, and directed us to a small bar area to wait.  There were a few other people waiting before us (groups of 4 or 2), and a few other people arrived after us as well.  We waited... and waited... 45 minutes later everyone else had been seated but us.  Not sure if they were &#39;regulars&#39; and therefore took precedence over us (as this was the first time ever dining at Angeli&#39;s) - the atmosphere in the bar was very friendly, but I&#39;m not sure if that really made up for the long wait.

When we were finally seated, the host did offer us a free appetizer or set of desserts, which was nice since we had such a long wait.  We ordered the grilled calamari, the bf had the pizza with chicken, basil, and fresh tomatoes, and I had a pasta dish called &#39;Angry Butterfiles&#39; - which had a spicy arrabiata sauce, italian sausage, and porcini mushrooms.

Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, despite bringing us fried calamari initially, he checked in on us frequently, but did not make us feel rushed.  The calamari was good, very tender with a good grill flavor (accompanied by capers, lemon, and tomatoes).  Our entrees were mediorce - tasty, but nothing to write home to mom about.

Overall, Angeli&#39;s is probably not a restaurant I will be returning to... although it seems that if you are a regular, the staff does treat you very well.  Give it a try, maybe you will have a different experience than we did."

At his suggestion I ordered the chicken Parmesan and my date ordered the veal special. The chicken parm was underwhelming.

Given that I was on a date, I didn&#39;t make a big deal, but over all NOT very impressed with Angeli&#39;s."

Next my bf got the crab ravioli and I the butternut gnocchi which was also Delish! Everything we ordered was great which i think is hard to come by these days.

But the problem i had was with the food. D had the pasta with marinara and i had arridiata  with angle hair. Being raised in a sicilian family most of the sauce my grandma made were well balanced acidly. I found that both sauces were not cooked long enough to get rid o f that bite. Plus it can be a bit pricey . I will go back to try one more time because they do have a extensive menu. One last thing, you have to try the New England clam chowder it is amazing"

It looks like nothing from the street - it&#39;s a strip mall business with dark windows that evoke images of heads-down, hushed meetings among elderly tough guys.  Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with that.

It&#39;s a charming place and the service is so hospitable and friendly.

The clincher was the gnocchi - amazingly fresh, filled with roasted red pepper, I blow a kiss to its memory.  Fabulous.  My husband loved his artichoke ravioli.  The pizza is mighty good too, so chilluns were quiet and happy.

Oh screw it.  5 stars."

The service was impeccable.  Even though it took a while for the food to come out, there was fresh crusty bread on the table, and lots of water refills.  

The appetizer was really good, however my entree, which was chicken --was overcooked.  So much so, that I could barely cut it into bites.  I was very disappointed.  

I was hoping to be able to add this cute little place to one of my favorites.  But, no, it just didn&#39;t do it for me.  Maybe a new chef ???"

This is a cute little place.  A bit small on the inside, but solid food and very nice people.  I plan on returning soon, as stuffed gnocchi is something I haven&#39;t found anywhere else.  I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re making it in-house, but it sure is delicious."

Couple questions were asked about the various sauces.  The waitress excused herself and after several minutes came back with samples of each and a free flatbread appetizer (she said to make up for the wait, but we were busy scarfing the nice warm bread and didn&#39;t notice). We ended up ordering a few different dishes and appetizers, all of which were fantastic.  Carbonara, Vodka, Pesto, Arrabiata...muah.  Our guests were thoroughly wowed by the food, service, wine offerings, and recommendations and said it is now on their to-do list for all future visits.

I love Italian food and I always judge a good Italian restaurant by it&#39;s bolognese sauce. It should taste meaty and make me think that it has been cooking all day on a stovetop, stirred lovingly by a little Italian Grandmother named Nonna, as she is standing on a small wooden bench singing Santa Lucia. ;-)
Angeli&#39;s sauce, sadly, just tasted like canned tomato paste, plopped precooked sausage and crumbly ground beef. It lacked any depth and was just so-so. 

I ordered the lasagna, but the noodles were so overcooked that they kind of disappeared in a meaty mess of sauce! Also noticed that there was no ricotta cheese or mozzerella on the inside layers of the lasagna. Weird. This is how it was served... meaty mess in a sauce, overcooked noodle, meaty mess in a sauce, noodle. Broiled cheese on top.  See?! 

There was some steamed broccolli on the side, not sure why since it just ended up making the lasagna taste even weirder.

So, I am hoping that maybe I just went on an off night or maybe the chef in the back was on a ciggie break when my order came up. Not sure. I might try again, but I think i&#39;lll try ravioli."

While the dinning room here is very small and tables are close togather it has a nice family style feel to it. The service here was very good on refilling cold drinks also. only complaint about the service was they never refilled my moms hot tea. Fod dinner I had the cheese pizza. The pizza here was pretty good. It was served nice and hot and had plenty of cheese. I also really enjoyed the homemade bread. The bread was brought out piping hot and has a great crust. For dessert i had the Canoli. It was one of the best Caloli&#39;s I have had. My sisters turtle pie also looked very good. All and all a nice Itialian place with good quality home made food.

I have been a huge fan of this place for years.  They initially won me over with their lasagna.  It is so good and large enough for two meals.  Then I met the crab rotolo.  All I can say is--OMG.  It is so rich, though, that you should either starve yourself before eating it or eat very light during the day.  It is just a nice, little storefront restaurant that has EXCELLENT service and a great chef.  The Angeli&#39;s bruschetta is also a special treat.  Wish they would serve it more often!

A friend of mine recently had a family party and didn&#39;t feel like cooking for it.  Although I had never had their catering, I mentioned that their food was amazing at the restaurant.  She went with them as the prices were good and she was impressed with the service from Joe via phone.  After the party, she could not stop raving about the experience.

Having said that, I will never go back, as I am fed up with the prices, the quality of the food and the cleanliness.  During this last occasion I found a pretty large bug in the my water glass and showed it to our waiter.  He showed it to the owner who swiftly got up and took it to the back.  Why?  I have no idea.  He came back to our table and said something like, &#34;what do you expect, it&#39;s summer.&#34;  By the way, this was during the second week of September and we were sitting inside which one person in my party pointed out to him and he was just like . . .&#34;oh well, stuff happens.&#34;  During the visit prior to my last visit, my friend and I ordered food for carry out.  We ordered a caprese salad and two orders of buttered noodles for our daughters.  The bill was over $30 and we received about four slices of tomato with the smallest slices of mozzarella on them I have ever seen and two 8&#34; round take out dishes with bow tie pasta in them that barely covered the bottom.  Really . . .20 cents worth of pasta  and $2.00 worth of tomato and cheese for over $30.00?

Angeli&#39;s is practically invisible: its in a little strip mall off Naper Blvd and Chicago Ave, but it had the BEST Italian food in the Naper-Bubble area. It&#39;s a stone&#39;s throw from Benedictine University and Downtown Naperville, so if you&#39;ve got a special occasion, definitely search this place out!

Decor: The walls are painted with cute murals of vineyards and other stereotypical Italian settings. They usually have some jazz crooners playing over the speakers, but not loudly enough to be obnoxious. Do expect things to be a little crowded: the space is kinda small, so the tables are kinda packed together. The lighting is usually low and the table sparsely set, so this is definitely a place to visit with the sweetheart: lots of room for hand holding, eyelash-batting, and other such revolting displays of affection.

Staff: I LOVE coming to Angeli&#39;s because the staff is so darn friendly. They are always so personal and are really helpful on crafting your perfect meal. From what I can tell, they&#39;ve got late high school and older people working the wait staff, while younger kids are usually the runners and bussers. Even though the staff is young, they are really attentive to your needs. When one water server (who must have barely been sixteen) saw that my boyfriend was not digging the bell peppers in his dish, the kid arranged for him to get a new dish, sans bell peppers. Bravo on water minion selection, Angelis!

Food: Oh god, the lobster crab ravioli. Or the gnocchi. Or just the freaking fettuccine alfredo. Everything here is delicious and fresh; whenever I know I&#39;m going to Angeli&#39;s, I abstain from eating all day just so I have enough room from the massive amount of yumminess that is the Angeli&#39;s menu. The desert is also to die for: they usually have desert specials that will rock your socks off without hurting your wallet. My recommendation? If it has chocolate in it, get it. Angeli&#39;s know what they&#39;re doing in this arena; they are chocolate desert pros!


Just a note: make sure to get a little dressy before coming in. This place isn&#39;t for the jean-clad. :)"

Well after eating here, I think all those people that gave it good reviews need to get out more!  The drinks were very small and over priced.  The salad was warm and wilted.  The bar was very small and too crowed to enjoy a drink while waiting.  The wait was pretty long.  The food was pretty good but a bit pricey.

My absolute pick for REAL Italian! 

A++++
-  Quality of Food
-  Service
-  Variety

Their Pesto Pasta meals are the same as in northern Italy.
If you are anything like me, and love spicy food, try the Santa Fe Chicken Pasta. It is not on their menu, it is usually a special. However, they always make it upon request. AHHH!!!!!!  It even makes MY eyes water at times! I LOVE IT!!! 

I am not sure what kind of olive oil they use for their bread dipping sauce, but I&#39;m a fan! Portions are rather large, so figure you will have leftovers for the next day.

My recent trip here reminded me just how much I miss this restaurant. The food here is always good whether you eat here or bring it back home. The service is friendly and they always get my order right. Definitely the best Chinese restaurant in town!
golden-sea-chop-suey-aurora,Daniel N.,YaGtDIetZp4SCRnTFz1qdA,"Chicago Ridge, IL",0,1,0,0,49,CJxNYchRKv_k20NF1MTi6w,1.0,2016-11-15,"Beware of this place!! I come here all the time and after my experience this weekend and today, I will no longer visit. THEY SCAM PEOPLE WHO USE CREDIT CARDS. 

This weekend I had a big order and I went in ahead to make sure I knew how long it would take for a bigger order. They guaranteed me 10-15 minutes. I placed a larger order appropriately should have cost around $65-$70. I got there in 15 minutes they said it&#39;s done. I was surprised so I asked how long would it take if I order crab Rangoon. The lady said 3 minutes. I said ah it&#39;s okay I don&#39;t need them. She said it will be quick don&#39;t worry. I caved and said yes I&#39;ll order as long as it will only take 3 minutes because I need to go asap. I waited addition 20 minutes. I was upset that they would lie. I wanted to say forget it but lady never came back out. After it was all said and done, there credit card machine wasn&#39;t working and they swiped my card so many times they locked out my card. I then had to proceed to pay a different way which I did not want to. Then they charged me $85. I didn&#39;t question it even tho it seemed hirer than I expected. After I got my food, I kindly told them that it was okay to tell someone it would take longer than it actually would. The lady then started to yell at me and said it was my fault it took so long since I order the crab Rangoon. I told her that I was advised it would only take 3 minutes. She just kept on saying &#34;it&#39;s you fault sir it&#39;s your fault sir!&#34; I let it go and just asked is she 100% sure it&#39;s all there and she said yes she put it all in so I quickly left since I was already really late. 

When I got there, I was missing my rice. The biggest part of the dish. I didn&#39;t know this information until later in the evening since no one told me it was missing. The didn&#39;t know it was missing because I placed the order and they just thought I may have forgotten to order rice. I noticed they never gave me a detailed receipt. So I didn&#39;t want to accuse them for charging me for something I didn&#39;t receive. 

I went to visit them today to Get a copy of my receipt. They printed out a copy for me and I was in fact charged for the rice but I then also Noticed I was charged an additional $5 different from what my credit card total was. I question this and she just started to yell at me. She said we didn&#39;t over charger you and she said she would pull the credit card receipt from the weekend. An older couple walked in to sit down. The lady proceeded to walk over to them to tell them I was trying to steal from her. This really upset me. She finally found the receipt and she then saw I was charged more than I should have. She then started to blame me for ordering crab Rangoon and that&#39;s why it was different. I looked at the detail receipt she provided and it showed i was charged. She then tried taking the receipt from me and stated that she wouldn&#39;t give me a refund for my missing item or for being over charged until I gave her the receipt that proved she was scamming me. I took a pic of the receipt witout her knowledge and said I&#39;d give it back to her. She told me to shred it and I said no. She said she wasnt going to give me my money back until I shredded it or gave it back to her. So I gave it back to her she gave me cash back. I then told her that it wasn&#39;t right that you would do this to me or any customers and showed her I took a picture of the receipt scam she had going. She begged for me to not leave. I left, writing multiple reviews and will be reporting this company to the BBB.

Update: 
- I wasn&#39;t aware or told of an up charge for swapping chicken for beef (as it shows on your menu the same cost in the area) 
- When I asked for a copy of the receipt, the lady working provided me with a copy. I questioned her and stated this is not the exact receipt for my order and she continue to lie over and over stating this was my receipt. So when the owner reaches out and says she didn&#39;t give me a copy of the receipt, I question why she continue to claim over and over that the one she gave me was not the actual copy. 
- I also was told they &#34;tried calling me&#34; I check my phone record and no call was made. In addition, no voice mail was left. Another lie.
- I came in simply for a refund for a product I didn&#39;t receive and was going to turn around and buy to lunch specials from you. Instead the lady said that your company does not do refunds and became hostile when I would question the integrity of this business for charging for something I didn&#39;t do. 
- I wasn&#39;t refunded for my time or gas, I was refunded the amount for a product I didn&#39;t receive + a fee that was scammed into my charges. If I was told that swapping chicken for beef was a charge, I would be fine with that. The issue is that your company in one day continued to over promise and under deliver. 
- I don&#39;t mind paying additional for what I want. I just want to know what I&#39;m being charged, given all the food items I paid for, with the correct amount of time it would take."

We were running errands on the east side, it was going to be a late night, so we were craving Chinese take-out.  

Golden Sea has mixed reviews, but I was very happy with our meal here.  Food was ready in 10 minutes, everything was still hot when I got home 20 minutes later, and the couple working here weren&#39;t overly friendly but they weren&#39;t cold to me either.

The food was above average.  I could easily eat fried rice and egg rolls as a meal.  Throw in the crab rangoon, and I&#39;m content.  The chicken fried rice was perfect, and the order of crab rangoon was a generous portion for the price.  The crab rangoon were crunchy on the edges and stuffed with filling.  The hot and sour soup was a huge container and full of veggies, tofu, and beef.  The egg rolls were a bit more peanut buttery than I like though.  We shared the Kung Pao Chicken, which I ordered extra spicy.  There were lots of veggies AND chicken, and we were satisfied with the entire meal."

I&#39;m in the food service industry and that is unheard of especially when we are new customers.

The food was finished in ten minutes which is always a plus when you can get it quick!! 

The crab rangoons were amazing and a great price!! The egg rolls were great too and had pork and shrimp inside. I got the chicken and broccoli and my husband got the Hunan beef.  My chicken was a bit bland, but my husbands has great flavor.  On the menu it said spicy, which I thought it was the perfect amount, but he wanted more spice.  I was a little disappointed that they only gave us one box of rice since we ordered two entrees, but it was a bigger box than we normally get. 

I would definitely order from them again, but I would get myself something more flavorful for sure!!"

It took three phone calls, going on site again, stating my case, and getting some cash back for the food they got wrong.  No experience is worth that.  What was most surprising is that they didn&#39;t even care that I was a new customer.

I ordered take out and got the standard fare. General Gau&#39;s Chicken, pork fried rice, beef teriyaki and crab rangoon. I should have returned it, it was gross. It actually made me sick.

I had somewhat of a long wait which I didn&#39;t mind too much since I didn&#39;t order ahead. I ordered sesame Chicken and a few other items.
 When I arrived home I opened the &#34;sesame&#34; chicken and realized that it was actually orange chicken that they just put a scope of sesames onto of it. The chicken was very sweet and not what I ordered. I called and made this known and was told that sesame and orange chicken was the same thing. REALLY???? 

Then why does it look different on the ordering menu and why does it have two different names. I was told I had two choices drive all the way back and return the food and receive my money back or get another order of sesame chicken. This in itself confused me because they just told me it was the same thing. Why then would I drive back to get the same thing? Why because after ordering from this place many times over the years I can tell you that sesame chicken is not orange chicken that&#39;s why. If you were too busy to make what I ordered and decided to just throw sesame on some orange chicken you had ready that&#39;s not my fault.

First, I&#39;ve Never had tomatoes in vegetable fried rice before. :-/ minus the 2 tomato chunks, the veg fried rice was not bad, but it wasn&#39;t amazing either. 
Crab rangoons = cheese cream in a deep fried wonton. 
My chicken Kung pao was nice (sauce wise) but the chicken did not taste fresh/ was too thick and dry (tastes like it was cooked too fast, which can leave a heavy poultry smell). The water chestnuts in the Kung pao chicken were old and tasted slightly sour. 
Now for the noodles, at this restaurant Lo mein was described to me as thin noodles when ordering so we were shown a picture of the egg noodles that had chicken and veggies. The noodles were good, but the chicken had the same problem as the kung pao, dry and smelled like poultry. 
The Mongolian beef was very soft and tender, came out sizzling on a skillet with onions and mushrooms etc. (no complaints)
Per the past reviews, I tried the watermelon smoothie and it was on point! Amazing smoothie. 
I haven&#39;t explored any of the seafood options here, but am optimistic, so I might come back for that only. Service, our waitress was quick, accommodating and helpful."

It does not get any better than Golden Sea. Before you shrug me off as a raving lunatic who seems to like Chinese a bit too much, even uncomfortably so, experience it for yourself. I am the definition of &#34;regular&#34; at this place, usually going once or twice a week. I&#39;m not terribly proud of it, and I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;re sprinkling heroin into their gravy because their food is addicting. 

The restaurant is always very clean, and the team that runs it is about as friendly as it gets. The service can be questionable at times (but I&#39;m a server, so I may just be picky), especially when it gets busy, but you&#39;re always greeted with a smile. Excuse me while I oil my thighs for the next segment....

THE FOOD

Okay, I only eat one of three things whenever I go in, but I can attest that these recipes were made from the decendants of Zeus because it is fit for the gods themselves. The lunch portions are massive and pretty cheap, but I always spring for the dinners because 1) I&#39;m not a fan of eggrolls sadly and 2) I&#39;m a fat ass. 

Garlic Chicken - Sublime

Kung Pao Chicken - Transcendent

Curry Chicken - Rubbing it all over my naked body as we speak.

One injustice is that they don&#39;t deliver, but I would probably be way out of their range anyway (Aurora is huge). 

Also, this place isn&#39;t open on Mondays, and a Monday without Chinese food is like a Friday without dressing up in a pig costume and  rooting through garbage for sexual excitement. Wait... I mean....

It&#39;s just good, trust me."

Staff was friendly and the food was fresh...unlike a lot of places similar to this type of food. The atmosphere is bright and clean looking, ( don&#39;t let the outside fool you). 

I ordered the chicken Gyro plate with the salad and fresh cut fries. It came with a honey mustard sauce which is good, but I asked for a Tzatziki sauce and it was given to me at no extra charge. 

Lastly, the only slightly negative thing I can say is that the Tzatziki sauce was too garlicky for my taste, but still very good."

In this case - pictures appear deceiving...

I&#39;ve been wanting to try Oh My Pita for some time since they recently opened...
It&#39;s a new spot in the area, located near the industrial section of town and not really easy to find..In fact, its super easy to miss.  There isn&#39;t large signage and its located right next to Mexico 2000 (in a connected bldg.) off of Fullerton...They specialize in Gyros, Shawarmas and Greek sides...A mix of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern...

Walking in, there is ample room to eat-in with many tables &amp; even a flat screen.  You can instantly see the various Spits behind the counter and everything is prepared in front of you behind the glass...Place is cute and looked brand spanking new &amp; spotless...
Owner was friendly and engaging.....

I wanted to try a few things. They offer a few types of Gyros meat: regular, Chicken &amp; Pork.
Shawarma:  Beef &amp; Chicken.  I went with the Beef Shawarma plate (comes w/2 sides).
I&#39;ve had Shawarma at various Middle Eastern restaurants and always enjoyed it..
Sides:  Greek French fries (thin cut fries topped with feta &amp; oregano and slice of lemon) and
Falafel.  Plus gyros...Friend had the Gyros plate, side of potato salad and falafel.  Ordered a side of Hummus also.  I asked for tahini and tzatziki on the side...

4 cut pieces of pita were included w/my hummus.  All plates came with one fresh pita. Meat portion was generous. .

I dove into my beef Shawarma first....

First bite - very tender, flavor &amp; marinade was different, not like anything I&#39;ve tasted in the past.  Meat texture was off-putting - odd texture.

Second bite was a mouthful of very fatty and tough meat - total opposite of first bite..
I discretely put a napkin over my mouth and disposed of it..
And that&#39;s pretty much how the *bites* went...I either had a forkful of oddly textured tender meat -  OR fatty, tough, inedible meat.  I couldn&#39;t eat another bite.  I was done.  The Fat Lady sang...

The Falafel presented itself as such, but texturally dense and uninspired in flavor.
Hummus tasted just like Tahini to me...no lemon or garlic to be found...The Greek fries were ok...crispy w/feta.  Tzatziki was very thin.
Moving on to the Gyro....pretty good, not bad - let&#39;s just say it SAVED the meal.  

My friend thought the Gyro was ok.  Said the potato salad was bland.  I had him taste my Shawarma and said it left a strange taste in his mouth - he agreed, the quality of the meat was more than inferior.  This place closes at 6pm.  Had they still been open, I would have brought my shawarma back - it was simply unacceptable.

The last thing I&#39;d want to see is a local business owner struggling...
I can only hope some improvements will be made in the near future...

I&#39;ll stick with Stav&#39;s gyros in the meantime. .."

The location is among factory and warehouses on Fullerton Ave. I am hoping that they will be successful here because the location does not have the best visibility since the location is kind of like an oasis in a desert. Could be a tough go.
Anyway, on to the food. Ordered a Gyros and a Chicken Shawarma sandwich to go. I talked about the place with the fellow who was making the sandwiches about the business and how they were doing, the biz, the location, blah, blah, blah.
The sandwiches themselves were very good. Fresh ingredients and they were not skimpy on them either. The place is nicely decorated and very clean inside. Service was friendly and efficient. Give them a try.

Nice staff and clean even though they mixed up my order. Not a big deal but rather than making me a new gyro they opened it up, picked the ingredients out that I didnt want into the garbage can, then wrapped it back up again. Gyros are good but both times felt they were too tiny with barely any sauce and was charged for additional. Not worth the drive for me. If you&#39;re close then it&#39;s fine but order 2 if you&#39;re really hungry. I live near a place that makes them way more generous so I won&#39;t be going back."

The beef shawarma is seasoned perfectly with just the right amount of veggies and tahini sauce. The Greek fries are fresh cut fries cooked golden brown, lightly crispy, and topped with a generous amount of feta and oregano, served with a lemon wedge. I got a second one cuz I like extra lemon. The Greek salad is big served with any veggies you want. I had mine topped with gyros which is probably the best gyros meat I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s also served it with a pita, so even better you can make a sandwich with your salad. Remember to order a side of tzatziki sauce if you go that route. The falafel sandwich is a must try.

There is a lot of competition in the &#34;fast pizza&#34; category within 5 miles.  There are Woodgrain Pizza, Block Pizza, Pie 5, Mod Pizza, Blaze Pizza, Pizza Barra, Standard Market, Whole Foods, Mariano&#39;s, Caputo&#39;s, etc. within 15 minutes, not to mention other not so fast pizza places.

The good:  Price is $7.99 for up to 4 toppings, different sauces (garlic sauce mmm good).

The not so good:  Skimpy on the cheese.  There is barely enough to cover the pizza, but I guess it&#39;s o.k. for $7.99

Woodgrain is $7.99 for 1 topping and unlimited for $9.99.  If Cucinova could make it cheesier, then it would be much better.

If you want pasta or salad, they have that also and it is similar to the way the pizza is created.  Choose your base, the sauce/dressing, then the meat/cheese all for $7.99

Got a BOGO coupon in the mail this week and decided to try it. It was really good! Very similar to the concept of Woodgrain a little further west on Ogden but I think Cucinova pizza has better crust and higher quality ingredients. Build your own can be daunting, but plan ahead and you won&#39;t be hemming and hawing in line. My husband chose to build white sauce with bacon, mushroom, and artichoke hearts. I built mine margharita style with fresh mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes. They were both great!! The bacon chunks were thick and meaty, not some little teeny bacon bits. I like that they take this concept to salads and pastas. I&#39;m thinking about ordering these pizzas for my next get together with friends."

This past Sunday we decided to go for there Brunch and bubbly.    We ordered a nice cava and glass of OJ  and made our own mimosas.   We shared the egg scrambled and French toast.   They were terrific.     My only negative would be that the potions were a little  small, maybe it&#39;s me I&#39;m a big guy,  but still delicious.    Their location is great and the outside seating is terrific.

This downtown area has many stores and eateries to recommend it and it&#39;s really nice to walk around in. We stopped in at TCC for a celebratory lunch. Sat on the very pleasant patio and put our order in. I glanced up at the umbrella and noticed a wasp trap with several live inhabitants. Well, it&#39;s that time of year and I know the hazards of outdoor dining in yellow jacket season. Sure enough, when the cheese plate came, with its lovely drizzle of balsamic, the wasps came on settled on the plate and refused to leave. We couldn&#39;t enjoy it under those circumstances, so we moved inside. The waitstaff distinguished themselves by quickly easing the transition. 

So enough about insects. The food is really worth the journey and reasonably priced, to boot. We had the aforementioned Chef&#39;s Cheese and Charcuterie Board, subbing out the sopressatta for duck sausage. Three types of cheese, duck sausage, fig preserves, cornichons, crackers and olives. Beautiful presentation. I had the Smoked Salmon Carpaccio, which starred an excellent lox (and lots of it) with capers, onion, greens, and a lovely portion of mascarpone, all set to pile on the warm loaf of french bread. We shared a Red wine flight, with generous pours of Tempranillo, Cabernet, and Shiraz. They were all appropriately light selections for summer. 

All in all, we were impressed with the service, quality, and selection. The inside is super cute too with cozy seating areas and high top tables. Definitely stop in for wine, cheese, and that lox!"

Started by two gals (hence the name TCC == Two Clueless Chicks), this is nice petite spot, where you can relax, enjoy the fine wine selections, sample different cheeses, be waited on by knowledgeable staff, get a lot of personal attention. They have a European style cafe menu and do lots of wine tasting and samplings quite often. We went here at least once a month for a couple of years and enjoyed ourselves each time. Very reasonably priced. Parking is a bit tight in the general area but is available. Has a nice cozy feel to the place. I recommend the baked brie. The Chef&#39;s Cheese and Charcuterie is also a good choice here for appetizers style stuff. The Mac-n-Cheese is often chosen and is plentiful. You may bring your own wine, but there is a corking fee. They do also sell just a few wine accessories and decorations pieces. Limited seating and perhaps a few seats outdoors when the weather is fine."

Four of us came here and were happy with our experience. Our waitress was so friendly and accommodating. We each did a wine flight, both white and red, and we all loved our selections. The food choices were diverse and delicious. We had the flatbread, salmon platter, and bruschetta. The desserts, however, get mixed reviews. We had the small chocolate mousse (can&#39;t remember the actual name), and the cinnamon cake, and those were great. We had the blue cheese cheesecake, which is an interesting concept, but the tastes didn&#39;t mesh well, in my opinion. Everything else was fantastic, and we&#39;ve recommended it to many people and have since been back."

If you have never been there I recommend the wine flights and chef&#39;s board to start. They have three wine flights: red, white and sweet. The chef&#39;s board includes three cheeses, one meat and comes with nuts, fig preserves and bread. For dinner I would suggest the BLTCC or the Grilled Cheese with tomato and prosciutto dunked in tomato bisque. They have many other selections and their menu is always being updated. They stay up to date with food trends. In the summer they make their own sangria!! YUM! The best part is they take reservations for two! Free wine tastings on too! If you like cheddar cheese order prairie breeze. Asp, the owners are the two sweetest ladies! Feels
good knowing my money is going to them when I am there. The staff is also super sweet and great at giving recommendations for wine. If you like Zins: Zynphomaniac is just to die for. If you like sweet wine: order Serena. Whatever your fancy you will find something you like!

Our favorite bites were the &#34;Adult&#34; Mac N Cheese with Bacon and the &#34;stinky&#34; Bleu Cheese. Also the Habanero jam was amazing. The atmosphere was very cozy and inviting.

It shares the street with one of my favorites MoJoes Cajun and it is immediately next to Capri Sogno which is no slouch. Also, it appears that it will have some more competition very soon( Sovereign &amp; The Spaghetti Bowl). As far as I&#39;m concerned, it should be able to hold its own against any restaurant, especially if it sharpens up a few minor details.  Service and menu expansion.  Menu expansion to offer new and different shareable plates every season.

We were able to get an outside reservation for 7:00 at 6:30 on a Tuesday.  We didn&#39;t realize the whole street was shut down for a car show!  We got to sit right on the sidewalk and the people watching was first rate!  
 
I&#39;ll go ahead and get my one negative off of my chest... The service staff seemed unprepared and understaffed.  Very nice, but long waiting for nearly everything. This is not the servers fault, it is the management.  Have an extra server working that you cut if it&#39;s slow, simple.

So we picked a nice Barolo out of the store and ordered an assortment of cheese and charcuterie that was top notch.  The smoked duck breast and the wild morel and leek cheese are not to be missed!! A++

Second course was;  

flatbread with roasted artichokes, arugula, chèvre and something else. A (careful if you don&#39;t like goaty cheese, chèvre is goaty!) I loved it!!

Baked Brie with raspberry sauce A (classic )

Salmon Carpaccio. A. They had a wad of fresh mascarpone that made the dish crazy good!

The Ambiance, weather, food, wine and people watching deserved 5 stars.  I look forward to eating here again soon and will be bringing friends here as well!

I&#39;ll preface to say that we are return customers. We&#39;ve been in countless times for gifts of wine and cheese and always have found a great selection and a great variety that you can&#39;t normally find in the area. 

My fiancé has eaten here before for dinner so I joined her, here is the story

Food - 5 stars easy.  My fiancé and I went for dinner on Saturday and were not disappointed.  We ordered a cheese plate, cured meat plate and a salmon carpaccio. Needless to say, there were leftovers.  The cheese selection alone is easily some of the best in the area. We splurged with some 14 yr aged cheddar and it was phenomenal. 

The prosciutto at this place is insane. We had the prosciutto, two salami&#39;s (which were awesome) and the andouille sausage which I was a big fan but was a bit too spicy for my lovely last. 

The salmon carpaccio was very good. With the sourdough bread that we loved we made a tcc sourdough and locks which is highly recommended by us.

Now the reason this place won&#39;t get 5 stars...... Service

Our waitress was very friendly but was slow. The food came out quickly, but we were empty for a majority of the night and the table next to us told us that they had specials for $5 / glass.  Our waitress didn&#39;t tell us which it rally have nobody to blame but myself, but I think it&#39;s pretty standard to let the customers know the specials. 

By the time that we were done eating / drinking to the time we paid and left was more than 35 minutes. Other tables that had a different waitress were in and out by the time we had paid our bill. 

GO HERE! We love this place and will return. I&#39;ll follow up after the next time we come to see if its improved."

Can&#39;t believe it took me so long to finally get here!  Cafe has an unpretentious, but slightly European feel.  Sounded like there was Brazilian jazz playing in the background.

We have dined there nearly a dozen times throughout the years and have never left without saying, &#34;That was really good. I am stuffed. When is our next date night?&#34;  

We thank God that Wine &amp; Cheese by TCC calls Plainfield home as Plainfield would be less without TCC."

If you find yourself wanting to go out and try something different, not full on dinner, but not the &#39;bar scene&#39; either try out Wine &amp; Cheese by Tcc.  

The selection of wine is impressive, she has everything from locally produced stuff to imports.  I was excited to see that she carried some of the wines from Lynfred Winery, one of the best local wineries.  She also carries some of the tastiest cheeses ever, my FAVORITE being the St. Peter&#39;s Blue.  I love cheese and the St. Peter&#39;s Blue is one of the top 5 best cheeses I&#39;ve ever had.  

W&amp;CbTcc also has wine and beer tastings a few nights a week so be sure to check them out!!"

Whenever I go in I order a cheese plate with a couple of meats. I usually know off the top of my head a couple of the cheeses and meats I want but I always have them pick one or two for me and they are always so good! I can&#39;t recall ever having something I didn&#39;t like. When I was first starting to really like wine I was pretty overwhelmed when I tried to pick one, they helped me pick a wine based of what I was looking for and it was delish. Based off the other reviews I&#39;m clearly missing out by not having actually dined in so I will defiantly be dragging my husband here very soon!"

My daughter and I visited yesterday for lunch, both enjoying 1/2 soup and sandwich. Food is always fresh and staff is very knowledgeable and helpful, I always let them select artisanal cheeses for me and am impressed and happy with those selections. They introduced me to GUS soda and several very good wines....we just bought a Lynfred  Sangria yesterday for my daughter who only enjoys very sweet, fruity wines. After asking a few questions and listening to my daughter, the server brought out wines to taste, making it an experience instead of just a purchase. She has a wine she is happy with instead of a roll of the dice. This is typical of the service at TCC.
The interior is small, but this is part of the apppeal to me, on a stressful day, TCC is a little sanctuary of sorts, cozy and friendly.  Lastly, it is the perfect place to enjoy a nice summer day. Grab a table with your friends, good food and drink, ahhhhh."

However, my recent visit only permits me to grant 2.  I think this is a great gem in downtown Plainfield and love it for what it is:  a quaint location to have a drink or two and some fantastic appetizers.  We walked in last Friday and to our dismay the 3 tables they have up front were all reserved.  What?  We arrived before 5 pm, which we have done before, and there was nowhere to sit and have a drink.  The 2 front window seats were also taken, likely because there were no tables available.

We were ushered to the rear lounge area, given menus and essentially forgotten about.  We walked out and gave our money to a neighboring establishment that gave us a seat immediately.  Sorry, Wine &amp; Cheese, I&#39;m not sure how excited I&#39;ll be to come back.  

I really don&#39;t believe this location should honor reservation requests.  Even up front, the staff member said &#34;sometimes reservations don&#39;t show&#34; so why do you even entertain a request to hold tables?  Wine &amp; Cheese isn&#39;t big enough to do reservations AND seat walk-ins.  How much potential business did you lose by turning walk-ins away while those tables were reserved?  Might want to re-think the strategy."

Usually we would go run to W&amp;C and take some stuff to go and make our own cheese plate but one Friday we decided to stay there and try the place out. 

It is very tiny so it does feel like you are right in the center of everything but it bothered me a lot less than I thought it would. Our server was pleasant and it only took a minute for our wine to arrive. They do things a little differently with regards to creating a meat and cheese plate.  I believe you pay a charge (maybe $5) and then you pay for each cheese by the ounce or two ounce portion. I think it was around $18 for four meat selections. So when we were done, we had a monster of a plate with four meats and four or five cheeses. Don&#39;t worry we took it all down. Our motto is &#34;leave no cheese behind.&#34; :) 

Overall, it was a nice evening. For our meat and cheese selections and four glasses of wine it was around $70. We will return because it is so close to our house and I feel everything we had was of fine quality. It won&#39;t be for a while with the weather changing but it would be nice to sit on their patio next time."

Very small inside but it looked pretty quaint and nice.  I liked the effort of including craft beers into their fold.  Granted, their selection for their beers weren&#39;t much (about 10 various domestic and imported 6 packs and bombers) but, their selection seemed to changed with the weather as the focus were on summer styles like wheats and hefeweizens.  

Service was non-existent as I wasn&#39;t approached by any of the employees for as I was looking in the same area for 5-10 minutes, not sure what to get.  However, the place was packed and everyone seemed to be very busy so I wasn&#39;t too turned off by that.  They have the perfect location, being right at a four-way stop, right in the center of town, and next to Finnegan&#39;s, which is packed most of the time.

We needed a nice night to do a lot of catching up and enjoy a glass of wine together.  We sat in the front corner on 2 cute modern couches with candles and a very warm atmosphere.  It was the perfect spot for us.  

Our $7.00 glass of Pinot Noir was nice, but a pathetic excuse for a pour.  I know the glasses are big, but I watched our server use a plastic wine cup measure the amount, and for a wine shop - I was very disappointed.  We saw the pour and thought that we would move on to the next bar rather quickly.  

We ended up staying a bit longer because the menu was so nice, we had great service, and it was the perfect place for us to talk.  The menu was fantastic and overall, I enjoyed the experience.  I&#39;ll probably keep looking for a similar place - with more bang (wine) for your buck."

I not only appreciate their fine cheese selection, which has something for everyone, but I love the wine and beer variety as well. It is always so clean and organized inside, making your experience that much better. 

Since they now serve actual food, let me tell you...

I find that the sandwiches are TO DIE FOR!!!! You can tell that they do not have some guy schlepping the food together. This guy is not even a mere chef. He is an ARTISAN! Each sandwich is picture perfect, very fresh tasting (ingredients top-notch) and delicious. Also a must is their hummus. Mmm...

It seems that each month they have a several tastings and other food/wine events pre-scheduled.  Each event seems to cover a different wine region or type of food. They all looked interesting, if only we had that amount of time.

The store is small and quaint with a nice selection of wines, cheeses, and other specialty items.  The staff is very knowledgeable about their products and are very helpful.

These sort of shops seem to be the current rage and I haven&#39;t been very impressed with most to this point.  However this shop is different and I very much enjoyed it and will be going back.

My boss put me in charge of supplying appetizers for our (managers) company Christmas gathering (for about 30 people). Anna, the owner, was extremely helpful. She set us up with a tasting. We loved everything she suggested (especially the little, stuffed red peppers). Anna beautifully arranged 3 different cheeses, 2 types of sliced dried meats, crackers, grapes, olives and of course...the little, stuffed red peppers. My co-workers thoroughly enjoyed our selections. It was a great success! Thanks Anna! You passed the ultimate test! See you soon!"

They&#39;ve always got a nice selection of cheeses that rotate and change with the seasons and some tasty wines (at a good price).

    Further more the wine recommendations are usually spot on.  Just describe what you&#39;re cooking and I usually get a spot on recommendation (Jason there is really helpful with his recommendations).

    They&#39;ve recently been getting interested in prosciutto, and have had a nice jamon Serrano (There are almost 2,000 Serrano producers in Spain.  So please, if you try one do not assume another one has to taste the same.  There can be large differences in quality from one producers to another)


     Now for the good news.  W&amp;C by Tcc has started to carry Iberico bellota paleta (shoulder).  If you&#39;re not familiar with the Iberico bellota products it is from a very specific breed of pig (the iberian pig) and the bellota products graze on primarily acorns.

   The result is the highest grade of jamon with a deep complex flavor and a resulting fat that literally melts away in your mouth.  I&#39;ve been traveling up to Chicago to purchase my Iberico ham and I am simply thrilled that a local business has decided to start carrying this product.

   It does cost a lot, but remember that even a few slices can satisfy your Iberico needs.

   enjoy the food!

It can be daunting for a novice to read a menu and dread asking what is??? Bhature, utappam, chaat, Roti, chapati, dosa, paneer and the list goes on.  One of the delights at Tandoor Hut is the friendly and helpful staff, and the tasting they encourage.  Small tasting cups are stacked on top of the counter, food is on display in a steam table but replenished often.  Of course there&#39;s tandoori chicken, tikka masala, dal and naan bread.  There&#39;s sweets on display and chaat (snacks/street type food).  I crave the onion pakora, a deep fried crusty onion snack that&#39;s delicious.  Located in a little strip mall, you can eat in or get it to go.  There&#39;s a lunch and dinner special every day.  Lunch for $5-$6 is a reality.  It&#39;s base board licking clean in here.

Never had a problem with the food; it&#39;s always well portioned and well priced (every so often I find myself needing another naan, but that&#39;s a rather minor problem). Definitely consider getting take-out from here if you want to spice up (no pun intended!) a family dinner that otherwise would be pizza, burgers, or sandwiches."

My only suggestion to get transparent plastic lids so that Indian food novices can see the various dishes or put more of then up on the 8 tvs they have."

- It&#39;s kind of crusty on the inside, and it&#39;s cafeteria-style, sneeze guards and all
- If you&#39;re an Indian food novice, it&#39;s a little intimidating

But it&#39;s so good. The staff was really helpful when we were trying to decide on what to order. You can get free samples to taste stuff! And the best part is, they totally trusted us enough to pay for dinner after we ate. It gave me warm fuzzies.

The highlights of the meal for me were the naan and the chili chicken. The naan came on a huge plate all warm, buttery, and awesome. The chili chicken was chunks of chicken fried with some peppers and then totally covered in red pepper flakes. So hot, so good, but not for the faint of stomach. 

This b has an iron stomach, so I am in love."

The first impression was pretty sad-- random strip mall, no decor, sneeze guards, etc. The staff was very friendly though and let me sample a few things while I figured out what I wanted to order.

I got the butter chicken (tikka masala), veggie samosa, and an order of naan. I was a little surprised at the small portion size given the price, but the portion of naan was pretty big so I guess that&#39;s fair. They did have a dine-in lunch special, which gives you five (small portions) different entrees for $8. Honestly, I would love to have gotten that but I really didn&#39;t feel like trying all those dishes alone in that kind of atmosphere. The samosa was good; I might start stopping by here to get them for my afternoon snacks. The naan isn&#39;t as fluffy as I usually like, but the only real problem I had with it is that my stomach is too small to fit all of its buttery goodness. Sad.

Nothing about Tandoor Hut was mindblowing, but if you&#39;re looking for a quick fix for an Indian food craving, it&#39;ll do just fine."

It must have been between the lunch and dinner rush, because there were no other customers around and some of the workers looked like they were chilling out watching some Indian TV program.  (Sorry to ruin your break, fellas!)  

Now, if you can get over the fact that they have fly paper that needs to be changed hanging precariously over the serving area, then do give the food a try.  The folks behind the counter were very helpful in helping me choose what to get.  I had a two curry combo, butter chicken and an eggplant curry (along with rice and naan).  Both curries were awesome.  The mango lassi I had with the combo was a bit lackluster, but hit the spot on a hot summer day.  The butter chicken was so good I had a double order to go.

Aside from the bad tasting food, the service is some of the WORST in Naperville. The people who take your order act as if you are an annoyance or bothering them. They do not seem interested in serving you.

Particularly, the naan wasn&#39;t that amazing (a little hard and not as fluffy as usual), but it was sufficient.

I&#39;ve always thought that there aren&#39;t enough fast food Indian restaurants, so I&#39;m glad this one is around.

The buffet was not accessible to the customers , you had to go to the counter and ask the server to bring out the buffet dishes , which was odd. The second thing that was extremely appalling was that 4 items in their Buffet menu were not even available.

I&#39;ve had Indian food in several states in the US and have never before  been sufficiently satisfied by any restaurant experience. Also, I&#39;m a hard-to-please Indian-food snob so I religiously looked for areas for &#39;constructive criticism&#39; but was completely won over by Tandor Hut! I agree with the previous reviews - it can&#39;t get any better than this !

The owner and the chefs are cheerful, friendly and passionate people. They let me take my time in deciding which item to taste (test) and even asked for preferences to help me choose better. I started with the chicken roast, moved to tandoori chicken and then chicken biryani. All three items were simply, heavenly delicious. I especially recommend the succulent tandoori chicken - for the first time in this country, the meat beneath the glossy-red exterior was full of juicy flavor. 

I went back the next day and with great difficulty stayed away from the chicken dishes, to try out fresh-off-the-tandoor naans ( it was such a pleasure to be able to see someone make your food with such care, and not to forget - hygeine) dosas, pani puri and samosa chaat. They actually encourage you to customize your  chaat ingredients and have an open grill to make you your samosa chaat/aloo chaat right there - fresh and hot !! 

I have to make a special mention of the Mango Lassi - In all my many experiments with cooking, I thought I perfected this easy drink, but Tandoor Hut put me to shame. The rich ORANGE(not the cheap yellow fare we usually find in desi restaurants) concoction seemed like the perfect accompaniment with practically every dish there. I painfully put my pride aside and asked the owner what they did, to make it so special and he was so kind to share the secret with me. No, I&#39;m not as large-hearted to share it on the internet - go ask him yourself!

Bottomline - Naperville/ Chicago folks, listen up! You have a precious thing here, make the most of it.

We&#39;ve tried everything from the take-out sweet shops to the full service &#34;fine&#34; dining. I was really hesitant to make the 15 minute trip here, as it is primarily take out. I am sure glad we did. The place comes across as a fast food place, and that&#39;s pretty much what it is. But that&#39;s ok, because the food - wow. It beats most or all of the places we had already tried - including the most expensive of the full sit-down establishments.

Many times, I come away from desiraunts wondering if maybe they all get their food shipped in from one central commissary, and just heat it up.  There just seems to be no variation in the selections or the taste.  Not so here.  The curries that we tried (four of them on this visit) were all very individual, with truly unique and vibrant flavors.  Others have mentioned the naan, and I&#39;ll put in a word for that, too.  Everywhere else, you fork over $2 for a small and quite so-so portion.  Here, it is included with the meal!  And what&#39;s more, it&#39;s probably the best you&#39;ve had anywhere.  Yeah, it&#39;s just bread.  But, it&#39;s the attention to the little seemingly insignificant things that helps define what a place is all about.  

It&#39;s obvious that the owner has a business plan for success, and he&#39;s certainly following it.  In fact, take a look at the sign on the front window.  It spells it out in black and white.  And on our visit, it was being followed to the T.  

The place was really clean, too.  Both the kitchen and dining area.  The seating fast food style, but my rating is based solely on the food.

Highly recommended if you&#39;re looking for excellent Indian cuisine, and don&#39;t need the comfy booth and waiters."

There are some tasty curries, some amazing spicy samosas, excellent chapati bread, and nicely done biryani rice. 

The food is pretty tasty, and although most is sitting in warmers already prepared the flavors are pure authentic Indian.  I am a bit of an Indian food fouchebag (snob). 

I want to give them a 4 star on food, but since the review is based on the restaurant overall, I&#39;ve settled on 3 stars. :( 

The service is a little bit lacking, there was alot of horsing around between the kitchen staff and the front of the house and it slowed things down while things were pretty busy.  I&#39;ve yet to eat in, but I will be back to try some different menu items and hopefully do an updated review!

Once we felt that chole was very little for 2 people, he apologized and next time he gave us very good amount .
Majority of Indian places increase prices and shortchange you in quantity of food. This is the 1st place we feel that the food quantity is very good . The place is clean, restroom for a change is always clean too which is a shock for an Indian place.

We recently tried their aloo ka parantha and loved it . Their mango lassi, plain lassi, bhelpuri,dahipuri,thali,chole batoore and paav bhaji is what we have eaten and have really enjoyed all of the food items. We are not fans of their samosas (tasteless)  , those we only buy from Krishna on 111th.

Clean, diner-esque atmosphere, with brushed aluminum counters and everything is right there for you to see.  The owner was super helpful on choosing items.  I ended up getting the vegetarian combo, a couple of Samosas and the Onion something-or-others (little round bready balls of something) that were excellent.  I&#39;ve had Indian several times, and I&#34;ve always liked it, but this, ...this was out of this world!  The Nan, fresh out of the tandoor oven (I walked around the side and peered into the back and watched a younger man cooking it in the oven) was amazing, just enough chewyness and the flavor, wow!    I actually didn&#39;t start eating this stuff until I was on the road, and when I did start I was amazed.  I pulled over down the road, and turned around and went back and got another order of everything for my girlfriend and her daughter.  It made the trip and they had it that evening and THEY loved it!  I&#39;ve been back once and was still impressed.  I wish he&#39;d open one here in St. Louis.  The flavors are indescribable, but just fantastic.  Cheers!

Also, look at my other reviews notice that I don&#39;t always give good ratings to restaurants, but this one deserves it.  Inexpensive, flavorful, unique, and the owner is passionate."

We were a party of 4.
Started with the local brewery draft and one member had a Riesling that she really enjoyed( 2 choices available, rare to have more than one )
The cheese curds were very good with a 
Nice complimentary sauce.
Here&#39;s our choices:
Pulled pork sliders with fries
French onion grilled cheese with gruyere
Smash potato burger with fries
Toasted apple chicken Brie sandwich
All agreed they made the right choices and would all return.
The staff is very young but so incredibly polite and genuine. They worked as a team and we felt so comfortable. The owner (manager) came by to see how everything was. It was an easy conversation since we were all so pleased.
The dining room is small but so beautiful 
with tall tin ceilings and old time lighting.
Boy I wish those old walls could talk.
As we left we received several thank yous from the staff. Again genuine.
Delightful!

Only word of caution:
Not wheel chair accessible. Very tall old time steps."

The interior of the restaurant is like a hybrid of a 1930s farmhouse kitchen and a diner.  The menu is soda fountain meets gastropub.

This restaurant is small, so be prepared for a wait on Friday nights.  I waited about 20 minutes for a party of 2.  There isn&#39;t much standing room to wait, so I felt like I was hovering over other diners.  When I walked in, I didn&#39;t know where to go, and I certainly didn&#39;t appreciate the one employee look at me at least five times without saying something.  If someone walks in with a blank look on their face, especially into a brand new establishment, say something!  I finally noticed that there is a counter with a register and walked over where someone helped me.

Their beers are mostly local, including options from Noon Whistle which is only a stone&#39;s throw from Babcock&#39;s.  I had the &#34;Fuel Cafe,&#34; a coffee stout from Lakefront, a brewery still local to the midwest. 

The food is mostly burgers and sandwiches, but that didn&#39;t make it any easier to choose.  I had the French Onion Grilled Cheese with fries.  Honestly, the sandwich didn&#39;t &#34;wow&#34; me.  The cheese wasn&#39;t melted all the way and the onions were clumped in the middle of the sandwich.  The fries were really good though.  My friend had the smashed potato burger which looked really good.  We also shared the cheese curds which were lightly battered and done really well.  The spicy mustard dipping sauce was an interesting twist too.

So I didn&#39;t love Babcock&#39;s, but I really did like it enough to consider going back to try the chicken apple brie sandwich, macaroni and cheese, or something else.  The location is a nice halfway point between myself and many friends, so I can see myself going back to try again."

We were greeted right away with a big smile. We were there for a late lunch. We ordered at the counter and took a seat. They brought our drinks and food out to us. The menu is wonderful, varied, and casual made with good ingredients. 

We shared a Sweet Potato burger and the smashed potato burger. The sweet potato burger was my favorite... just wish it had a tiny bit more avocado. The fries were awesome! Crispy and perfectly salted. Beer and wine list had a nice variety too. 

We went on a nice fall day and chose to sit outside. The chairs are very comfortable for outdoor furniture. However the inside looks comfortable as well. If you haven&#39;t tried this spot, don&#39;t put it off any longer... just go."

I was totally nerding out over the rustic and classy decor. So much so that I took a panoramic video of the place, because I wish my house looked exactly like this.

I met Kate S for lunch and had a great experience here. Located in downtown Lombard on a busy corner, Babcock&#39;s has outdoor seating and inside seating. During the day you order up at the counter and they&#39;ll bring out your food; at night it&#39;s a full service restaurant. 

Their fall lunch menu offers a lot of great options. I decided to go with the french onion grilled cheese with a side of organic mixed greens. This sandwich cost $8.50 and had swiss cheese, gruyere, caramelized onions, and parsley. It was so delicious and tasted exactly like French onion soup! Perfect for a cool fall day. The other option for a side is their Belgium style fries, but I definitely suggest the greens with this sandwich. It&#39;s a nice light balance to a very cheesy lunch.

I will definitely be coming back to Babcock&#39;s Grove House and can&#39;t wait to try out their dinner menu. They also offer beer on tap and in bottles and wine too. Sounds like a relaxing evening to me!"
babcocks-grove-house-lombard,Kate S.,XBomRKII_TfQbKkL8QH9rQ,"Elk Grove Village, IL",1,1,1,47,174,aAGafcVb0xySSTZMRdROwg,5.0,2016-10-13,"Let me start off my saying I&#39;m sadly unfamiliar with the city of Lombard and all the businesses within it but if it&#39;s anything like Babcock&#39;s Grove House then Lombard will definitely be seeing a lot more of me. What an adorable restaurant. I fell in love with this establishment even before I had visited for the first time. Viewing the photos and reading the reviews here on Yelp was enough for me to decide that there was a very likely chance of me loving this place - I was right!

Like several other Yelpers and visitors of Babcock&#39;s have mentioned, this place is damn cute. The decor is a sort of woodsy chic and I&#39;m obsessed. Before I had ordered my lunch with Jacqueline B. I looked around the space as if I was a kid in a candy shop. The Babcock employees were very friendly and pretty attentive from my experience.

Now enough about the cute space, the food was good too! I had ordered a chicken, apple and brie sandwich with a side of fries. It was pretty satisfying and very nicely plated! Because it had been just a casual lunch (and they didn&#39;t have their dinner menus out yet) I didn&#39;t dive into their drink menu or anything of that nature. They had a pretty good selection to choose from for just lunchtime though.

One thing that was different for me was the fact that you order/pay at the front counter before you get your meal. I learned later on by an employee that they have a regular &#34;dinner&#34; style menu and serving. I think that means a waiter/waitress takes your order at your table and you pay after you&#39;re done eating like most restaurants? I&#39;m not sure. It didn&#39;t bother me either way.

I would absolutely love to bring the boyfriend here to grab dinner and drinks in the future. I can see this place being nice for a date night! It&#39;s small, cozy and the price range is not bad at all."

Steampunk diner?  Farm fresh speakeasy? While they do have a few outdoor tables, I think the decor inside is much more interesting. And I am not one to turn down al fresco dining!  So,  arrive early and dine in!  Plenty of stools at the bar too! 

As for the food,  I had the sweet potato burger and already went back for another!  Thank you from all of us vegetarians for having some serious non meat options!  We also had the carrot soup with side salad which is super light, but also somehow hearty.  Carrot soup sounds like a winter food but it&#39;s actually perfect for summer too.  The turkey burger and chicken schnitzel are also solid choices.  

Our little guy had the mac and cheese.  He was pretty happy about it.  Nice and creamy.  I will caution you to arrive at senior citizen/toddler dinner time (5pm)  if you want to snag a high chair.

Now,  let&#39;s talk about the drinks.  Craft sodas like birthday cake flavor (perfect for cream soda lovers),  lemonade and the craft beers!  We had some kind of delicious double IPA on draft.  They also have a special local Lilicia beer named for Lombards beloved lilacs.  It&#39;s on the light side. 

And lastly, a note to the genius designer that created and hung the lighting. We love those single bulbs that are hung like octopus arms in the middle of the ceiling.  The cage lights are fantastic too. 

Room to Improve :
1) add a side of fruit or veggies to the kids meals
2) add a high chair or two to the fleet
3) where is the dessert menu?! Dessert please!"

I came here with my family tonight and was thoroughly impressed.  It&#39;s a relatively small restaurant and a bit loud when crowded, but the decor is cute, the service is kind, and the food is amazing!  

Our waitress was efficient and friendly, and the manager stopped by our table several times to check in and chat.  The food was truly excellent.  We split the Bell&#39;s IPA Battered Wisconsin Cheese Curds, and then I couldn&#39;t make a decision, so I ordered both the Roasted Butternut Squash Hummus and Mrs. Peck&#39;s Savory Skillet Mac N Cheese.  My family members also really enjoyed the food they had, and my Autumn Cider Palmer to drink was tasty as well.

I am looking forward to returning!"

Every time I drive by the restaurant is busy with people, dining inside and outside. I had read reviews and I was excited to check them out. 
Last night on my way home from work I decided to stop there for a very late dinner and a glass of wine. I walked in a little past 8 pm and there were a few people sitting at the bar and a few tables were occupied. That late there was no wait. 
I got seated and was given a menu. I was dining alone, something I enjoy quite a bit, and my server must have found that strange since he asked me if I ordering to go. 
I ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and he brought it over right away alone with some water. 
I looked over the menu and everything sounded amazing. I ended up going with the turkey shallot burger that comes on a wheat bun I believe it was. I refused the fries and went with the mixed greens salad that came with a fantastic vinaigrette type dressing. 
My burger was unlike any other burger. It was not greasy at all, it was full of flavor, cooked perfectly and simply delicious. I don&#39;t even know how to explain it other than perfect deliciousness. I pretty much devoured my meal. 
The server checked on me a few times, there was also a gentleman with glasses that was walking around and he came over to ask me how everything tasted. He caught me mid bite so all I could go is give him a thumbs up. 
The food was good, the restaurant is trendy and inviting. 
It&#39;s been a while since I  enjoyed a simple meal as much as I enjoyed my late dinner here. 
I enjoyed my glass of wine and my meal after a stressful day at the job. 
I can&#39;t wait to go back and enjoy more deliciousness."

I believe it opened about two weeks ago. My fiancé and I were looking for new places to eat in Lombard, and we were ecstatic that this new restaurant is a 5-minute walk from our house. We&#39;ve only frequented Babcock&#39;s once so far. However, after one visit, we are certain to become regulars. Babcock&#39;s has a warm, inviting atmosphere and is located in the heart of Lombard by the Metra station. 

The staff is friendly, courteous, and prompt. I can tell they actually enjoy working for this new restaurant. One of the owners came over to our table and talked to us for quite a while. It felt like home - she seemed to know everyone in the restaurant, and she seemed to know every family and business in the area! 

They had a vast selection of sodas and beers, and their food menu had some unique and delicious offerings. I had the Smashed Potato Burger. It was a 1/3lb burger with cheddar cheese and mashed potatoes on the burger. This burger was fresh, filling, and satisfying! The taste of mashed potatoes, cheese, and the burger together was a mixture I hadn&#39;t considered before. 

I asked one of the owners about a breakfast/brunch menu, because Babcock&#39;s would be an absolutely perfect Sunday Funday brunch location! She said they had plans to roll one out, and they are still ramping up their employees since they are so new. I am very excited to try that new menu when it comes out!

Overall, Babcock&#39;s is a fantastic new restaurant and it will surely become a Lombard staple before too long!"

There are so many options for all kinds of people. Vegan, vegetarian and omni. 
I had the sweet potato burger. The avocado was a perfect amount. The garlic sauce was good. My mom had a beef burger and loved it. You get to pick a side salad or fries. The fries are a bigger portion but the home made balsamic dressing was really delicious with the salad. 
The only thing different was that you order inside and they bring your food to your table, kind of like noodles and company does.
Overall everything was really fresh. I will definitely be back for the soups and the caramelized onion grilled cheese! Oh and beer of course :)"

I tried the cheese curds, buffalo chicken salad and I had a couple bites of my boyfriend&#39;s smashed potato burger. Everything was great and tasted homemade.

The place is lovely and authentic vintage. Seems like they take great pride in what they do.  I appreciate a non-styro take out container (well done).   

No issues except that ...

I wish desperately that they had at least 1 or 2 real comfort food dinner options on the menu.  Example: stuffed peppers,  or beef stew, pork chops, roasted potatoes, baked potatoes, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, roasted veggies, salisbury steak, stuffed cabbage rolls. 

I am just not a burger person, and can only eat so many salads.  With Shannon&#39;s Deli right across the street, I feel they have more options for me.  There is so little in the way of food in downtown Lombard, and some affordable comfort food would be very welcome."

Everything I&#39;ve tried has been delicious - no joke.  They offer a seasonal food menu with &#34;mostly local&#34; beers. Their salads are nice and fresh, the burgers are nice and juicy, and their beer and wine selection is great. For first-timers, I&#39;d recommend the pretzel and beer cheese appetizer, the green goddess salad, the turkey shallot burger, or the stout pulled pork sliders with chipotle cheese.

We arrived at 5:40 or so on a Friday, and 45 minutes later the place was full with people waiting. We were seated immediately, back in a corner. I know a historic building has its challenges, but I will say the acoustics back there were a little rough, voices echoed back toward our table. The tables are also quite close together. But who can blame them wanting to fit as many people as possible in?

The menu is not big but this is a good thing. Everything sounds very good. We started with cheese curds. They are clearly homemade and all different shapes. And delicious! The dipping sauce was tasty too.

My husband ordered the beer cheese burger and a fancy grape soda; I had the chicken schnitzel sandwich and a peach tea palmer (with lemonade). My husband said his burger was perfect, and devoured it before I got a taste. My sandwich was also very delicious, and the fries were quite good as well.

Service was a little tentative at times (I think the young woman serving us is new, but she was friendly and competent) but overall good. It&#39;s a new restaurant so no harm there.

Ate there with three people...had the pretzel and beer cheese app, pretzel was huge...cheese was solid with a little horseradish kick.

As far as entrees, had a smash potato burger which was reportedly very good and then split both the chicken, apple brie sandwich and the chicken schnitzel sandwich with someone. Both were good but extremely bland and grandparent-ly safe in flavor. Definitely could use some kind of contrasting flavor...both of them were satisfying but forgetful.

Main problem was, even though it was admittedly a warm day...it was stuffier than hell in there...could use some more air moving around. There&#39;s a back corner that&#39;s like a sauna. 

Also, no fault of the restaurant, but there were also a couple of blow hards that apparently had mistaken it for the corner bar. Older locals monopolizing a table and the poor server over several beers and loudly regaling her with tales of Lombard past and how many beers they drank and tracked in their phone app over the years. Literally seizing her for 5 minute stretches while they explained how they were drinking &#34;x&#34; beer before it was even available in stores like anyone cared. Don&#39;t be that person."

I had the burger with bacon and beer cheese. It was delicious! My husband had the burger with mashed potatoes on it. He expected it to be a little better since there were great reviews on it, but it wasn&#39;t bad. We would gladly go back to try more! Though if you&#39;re a vegetarian, there aren&#39;t a lot of options. They have a sweet potato bean burger for vegetarians, and a rabbit plate (raw veggies w/ humus) and maybe a salad or two I think.  How about adding grilled veggies to the menu, or even a grilled veggie sandwich"

My fiance and I are committed to becoming regulars. We&#39;re obsessed and want to try everything on the menu. I&#39;ve been here with him, my parents, and even my grandmother.  Getting my grandmother in was somewhat of a challenge because it&#39;s not handicap accessible (however, the owner says they&#39;re working on that).  Some other patrons were nice and helped me get her up the steps so it worked out just fine! 

Some food highlights: the Sweet Potato Burger and the Turkey Shallot Burger.  I&#39;m shedding for the wedding, so it&#39;s nice that they have some healthy options. The mixed organic greens they have as a side option are also very good. Through other people I&#39;ve tried almost every other dish on the menu, and noting disappointed me! 

Downtown Lombard needed something like this.... we recently moved from the Lakeview neighborhood of Chicago (land of amazing restaurants on every corner) and this is so cute and hip that I almost think I&#39;m back in the city and not in Lombard. I grew up in Lombard, and am pleasantly surprised with new restaurants and bars popping up. Babcock&#39;s Grove embraces its downtown Lombard location and the decorations center around the history of Lombard. 

The owners hit one of the park with this one. Definitely try it if you haven&#39;t yet!"

We started out with delicious craft beef and glass of Cabernet and the roasted beet humus. The burgers are handcrafted from Allen Brothers ground chuck perfectly done. The fries are hand cut and of a large portion. 
Looking forward to going back. Extensive wine and craft beef offering. 
Too bad we did not have room for their signature ice cream floats with there fountain crafted cane sodas. Next time for sure!"

Customer service comes first only to the excellent locally sourced food which is always fresh and full of flavor. We&#39;ve worked our way through everything on the menu and love it all...however I am particularly partial to the pork sliders.  The team always makes you feel like family, remembering your name and updating you on specials and menu items. What a Lombard gem. Bring your friends for a great meal, or sit at the bar for a beer and cheese curds. Either way you&#39;ll love it all."

They&#39;re still learning to improve their service.  (Weird to ask you to pay beforehand).  But, their niceness makes up for a few inconsistencies.

was generally how I reacted so won&#39;t rehash what everyone said.

Nevertheless, I do have one comment that might matter to some people. I had their classic burger and it was good, no real complaints. Except the burger was slathered with mustard. I&#39;ve never had a burger at a restaurant that had mustard on it. It may be a personal thing but I hate mustard on a burger. Possibly my fault if that ingredient was mentioned on the menu - I didn&#39;t check."

babcocks-grove-house-lombard,Rebecca C.,Vv921iDdazUHJqPCBzJnUQ,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,82,14,BiuB-KIu4ts4YT3QaQG62A,5.0,2016-06-01,"While nothing holds a candle to Chicago, there are huge nuisances such as parking and tiny annoyances such as crowding. So, when wanting a slight break from the gritty city, but rather not come face to face with an obtrusive strip mall, Babcock&#39;s Grove House is brand spanking new to downtown Lombard and their induction to town is FABULOUS! The talented owners took the old Cafe 101 and brought it up to the standards of super cozy cafe with charm out the wazoo! It probably doesn&#39;t hurt that the lilac village has been hungry for someone just like the new owners to dust off the pre-civil war limestone and polish the wood. Every inch is charming and it&#39;s so nice to have several months to bask outside, European cafe style, in the middle of the Lilac Village. Lots of seating outside, decent amount of seating inside. This locale is just so darling it deserves a big hug! 

Like European cafes, there&#39;s a huge wine list and a lot of local beers available. We weren&#39;t in the mood for alcohol, but I will definitely try one of their wines the next time I&#39;m in (which will be very, very soon). 

Food - after all, that&#39;s the main reason to come here, and Babcock&#39;s has very yummy organic, locally sourced, healthy yet delicious comfort foods. To begin with, on a warm Spring weekday, the best drink is unsweetened iced tea which they have down to a science, for a measly $2.25. One can drown themselves in a sea of refreshing, pure tea, and it&#39;ll still cost less than $.10 per ounce. Don&#39;t need to go back to Brussels, folks, if that&#39;s all you&#39;re going for are the fries. Babcock&#39;s Belgian fries are to die for and then to return for another order, or 2 or 3. The beer battered cheese curds - my oh my oh my. Wisconsin, step right up in Lombard &#39;cuz there&#39;s a new contest and Babcock&#39;s might win. These addicting little critters are wonderful and from the ooh&#39;s and ah&#39;s from other tables, I think they agree. Amazing, in that everything appears to be under $10, and that includes all the entrees. Portions are more than ample, plated beautifully and there&#39;s more than enough on everyone&#39;s plate to share.  

The chicken Caesar Salad was delightful and delicious, with a mixture of the tastiest romaine (not bitter); kale (yay!), croutons &amp; lime Caesar to add a scrumptious fresh flavor that&#39;s also sneaking in those healthy nutrients. This isn&#39;t a typical Caesar salad, yet it hits normal where needed while adding something different that forces me to want to order it again and again. I had a taste of the Smokey Sweet potato burger that is just wonderful, especially for a veggie burger. With bean puree, roasted garlic yogurt, avocado on a sprouted wheat bun that brings all the deliciousness together - that was one amazing &#34;burger.&#34; Good for Lombard, since this new gem is gonna make Lombard proud. In fact, I think they already have!"

The fries were very tasty, but they need to have a bottle or two of malt vinegar behind the bar. 

We sat outside due to the crowd inside, but from what I could tell the decor is very pleasant. I look forward to seeing how they change up the menu as the seasons change."

good to see some serious vegetarian options - i tried the

the butternut squash humus is really good.

Still great menu, still great service, and now I am addicted to their french fries. Judging from our frequenting this place, we are in good company because we have run into the same people over and over. The owners seem to know everyone in town and even the mayor was there!

I had the grilled cheese with tomato sandwich which wasn&#39;t anything spectacular or fancy - just cheddar on sourdough, though it was grilled to perfection. I&#39;d like to see Babcock&#39;s &#34;kick it up a notch&#34; by using two different types of cheeses, such as provolone with the cheddar. The side of greens was plentiful, but again, no imagination. Just a small pile of green and purple greens (same variety). It&#39;d be nice to have at least a little bit of cucumber and tomato. The balsamic dressing on the side was very good; nice and tangy. My husband had the evening special: chicken salad on whole wheat. The waiter told us this was the first time having chicken salad on the menu and came back later to ask my husband how he liked it. Hubby gave it a thumbs up. I had tasted a bite too, and it was good. Not saturated with mayo and had a little bit of tarragon. My son had the basic burger and we were impressed to see it was free-formed, not machine-pressed and &#34;perfect&#34;. He said it wasn&#39;t greasy at all and had great flavor. I tasted his fries and they were amazing - some of the freshest fries I&#39;ve ever had.

Our waiter was a young man (looking around, I noticed all the waitstaff was very young) who was very courteous and friendly, checked on us just the right amount of times, and refilled our drinks just as they were empty. You could tell he was inexperienced and a little awkward, but that was OK.

As for the restaurant itself...when we first walked in, we were confused as to what to do. You literally walk right into the restaurant. There is no host and no sign that says &#34;seat yourself&#34;. There was waitstaff buzzing around, but no one greeted us or showed us to a table. So we took it upon ourselves to find a table in the back of the restaurant. By the time we left around 6:30, the place was mobbed and there were people waiting for tables. This was a Thursday night, so I can imagine it gets very crowded on weekends. The place is small with not many tables. In fact, you have to really squeeze by some of them to get to the back of the restaurant. And, in the back, some of the tables are so tightly packed that the servers were having a tough go with trying to wait on the tightly packed tables and with the customers going to and from the bathrooms, which are right by the kitchen in back of the restaurant, too. Speaking of the bathrooms - meticulously clean, which is greatly appreciated and also a good sign of a clean restaurant! I will be recommending this place to friends and family who live in the area - the positives definitely outweigh the piddly negatives. Food and waitstaff are fantastic!"

Booze: Good list of local beer. They have the BEST gluten-free beer, Lakefront New Grist...which made me immediately love this place.  Most restaurants don&#39;t stock New Grist and they really should. Wine list was perfect too!

Food: 
Excellent options. Excellent ingredients. There are far too few places in the burbs with a menu focusing on local, organic, quality ingredients. High-five. And prices were perfect. 

Service: you can tell it&#39;s a newer place. Our server didn&#39;t seem to have lots of experience. Would have like a quicker check-in with us after our food came because we realized we wanted a few more items. But this was nothing major. 

Overall, excellent. Fabulous. Want to be a regular."

Babcock&#39;s Grove House offers a unique, tasty, fresh (no freezer except for the ice cream!), inspired menu with plenty of options for all.  Thus far my family has tried and highly recommend the following:
   * the turkey burger - so moist and flavorful with shallots and portobello mushrooms in the mix - the best turkey burger my husband has ever had
   * my potato loving daughter raved about the smashed potato burger
   * my other daughter can&#39;t stop talking about the Babcock&#39;s Classic burger 
   * chicken apple salad - yum
   * sweet potato burger - great vegetarian option; huge - didn&#39;t need to eat it all, but couldn&#39;t put it down!
   * the Green Goddess sandwich has such a fresh unique flavor
   * as tasty as the raved-about fries are, I opted for the organic greens served with an incredible balsamic dressing on the side (and was still able to steal a few fries from my family&#39;s plates!)
 
Drinks (all &#34;made in the USA!&#34;): 
   * a very comprehensive beer menu which offers something for everyone on tap or bottled
   * The wine list has a nice selection of varietals all offered by the glass or by the bottle. 
   * unsweetened peach tea is to die for!
   * craft sodas are fun for the kids and sweet-toothed adults (you have to try the Babcock&#39;s Birthday cake soda)

Lastly, the staff is plentiful and eager to attend to diner&#39;s needs.

It&#39;s so nice for Lombard to have another restaurant that not only locals can enjoy, but one that will surely be a destination for people from neighboring communities and beyond. We can&#39;t wait to watch Babcock&#39;s evolve over time as we taste our way through the menu. Bravo for a job well done!"

The chicken schnitzel sandwich is fantastic as well. The banana split sandwich is a fun dinner for the kids. Everything is loaded with flavor and you can tell it is made with fresh, local ingredients. The wine selection and local beers on tap are the perfect compliment to the food. There is even a wide selection of Illinois-made soda choices, which is a fun retro addition. 

Everything is reasonably priced and worth every penny.

This restaurant has a great ambiance with fun historic photos of Lombard and famous Lombard residents and politicians. There is also a cute bar serving a nice variety of local craft beers. The waitstaff was plentiful and eager to help. I had the smashed potato burger with buttermilk mashed potatoes. It was cooked perfectly and those mashed potatoes were a quirky, tasty addition under the moist and buttery brioche bun. I also tried the buffalo chicken wedge salad ordered by my dining companion. It was spicy with a great twist on the traditional wedge. I really like this place, and will return again soon! I&#39;m happy to see more great places moving into downtown Lombard."

They&#39;re still working out a few kinks, being fairly new, and the servers are young and learning, so be patient. But I Love every item I&#39;ve ever tried! My top favorites are the cheese curds, smashed potato and shepherds pie burgers, and the green goddess sandwich. Hoping their expanded seating gets here before the cold weather, I could eat here every day! My only major complaint is the side of mixed greens. They could REALLY use something more than just leaves. Something as simple as a tomato, cucumber, or shredded carrots would make it feel more substantial."

The interior is very chic and cool. We didn&#39;t have to wait long to sit outside, despite there not being enough outdoor tables. The hostess was attentive and lovely. Four of us came, and we had the turkey burger, mashed burger, schnitzel sandwich, and blue cheese burger. We all loved our choices; so good! Everything was fresh and seasoned to perfection. I personally had the turkey burger, and it was, by far, one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. Our waiter was Nile and he was friendly, accommodating, and efficient. I do wish they had a full bar; at least some mixed drinks. Overall, awesome location, cool concept, and great food. We will be back!"

I wonder if people will agree that the comments left by the owner were a little condescending. I also feel as if my review wasn&#39;t read at all..

A. I do not work at Drytini, Sorry that you assumed that and tried to throw a little sarcastic remark as if you know who I am now.. attempt failed. 

B. I did request the dressing on the side. I said that I was trying to lose weight and my choice is to dip my fork in the dressing. That has zero relevance to anything I already said.

C. I clearly watched the person take it from me and walk toward someone else to hand it to them. Don&#39;t lie to try and come back from this. Your silence would have made much more of an impact. Word of mouth, and my mouth especially, is so much more powerful!

Such a Shame."

We started with an order of Bell&#39;s IPA Battered Wisconsin Cheese Curds. Wonderfully greasy and very tasty with the Honey Mustard Aioli. The four of us each got a different burger and we found them all to be delicious. We got the Classic, Bacon Beer Cheese, Smashed Potato and Shepherd&#39;s Pie (really a Cottage Pie since there is no lamb in it). The burger menu is not as extensive as burger houses but what they have are solid. The buns were well toasted, the patties are hand formed with meat (fresh only) from Allen Brothers Meats in Chicago, nicely cooked on a very hot grill top with a perfect char and well seasoned. The only mark against the burgers are that the patties could be a little thicker and they would be a little better if made with a blend of beefs rather than just chuck (albeit 100% Angus) Doing those things would let us rate Babcock&#39;s as a solid 1 (it got a &#39;wobbly 1&#39;). Their Belgian Fries are nearly perfect. They cut their own fries and fry them twice - first to cooked them all the way through and then again just before serving to make them crispy. That&#39;s THE way to do fries. Probably the very best &#39;regular fries&#39; we&#39;ve had so far, and the portion was larger than most. Draft beer list of &#34;mostly local beers&#39; although not extensive, is a good one. The Buckledown Belt and Suspenders was excellent. Our server was delightful and the staff overall was quite friendly. They were attentive without hovering. Overall we had an excellent dining experience and would recommend this place to anyone."

Great job by the new owners who have clearly put so much heart and soul into creating a special place with a fantastic locally sourced menu.  We went with a group of 8, so we had a lot of feedback and different plates. The good news is that everyone really enjoyed their meals and there were definitely a few standouts including the Turkey Burger and the Green Goddess sandwich. The kids all ordered floats made with various soda flavors and the adults sampled some of the beer selection.  Really unique!    Can&#39;t wait to come back and try some more soon!"

Not what I&#39;m used to. Luckily they put the sauce on the side. I tasted it and didn&#39;t really care for it. It was very sour cream-y tasting. So I ate the sandwich plain. There were tomatoes on it but they were not very ripe so I took them off. So the sandwich was okay, nothing special. Definitely missing something without honey mustard in my opinion. I also ordered a garden salad. I actually wanted a side salad but they don&#39;t offer those so I got the full sized garden salad. It had feta cheese on it which I&#39;m not a fan of and I was surprised to find it on there since it wasn&#39;t a Greek salad but I didn&#39;t ask what came on it so shame on me, I guess. There wasn&#39;t much else on it. More of the bad tomatoes like on the gyro, that&#39;s about it. I said I didn&#39;t want onions or green peppers but I figured there might be something else. Oh there were a few cucumbers on it too, almost forgot! And those were good. Ranch dressing which tasted more like garlic. I did get an unsweetened iced tea and that was quite good! All around it was a pretty subpar meal and for almost $16 I don&#39;t feel inclined to give it another shot."

I used to visit regularly when I lived closer and the service was great, good atmosphere for sports and night life. When I decided to come back it was on a Friday night and there was hardly anyone there, even though there were only a few tables the waitress was rude and seemed like she was pushing my table out. The drinks werent good and when I mentioned this to our waitress she simply asked if she can get me something else. I still had to pay for the drink I did not like. The food seemed as though it was sitting and I had to ask for napkins and silverware. For it being a slow evening I expected great service and good food and drinks. I got the complete opposite. The manager never came to my table to ask how food or service was or to see if we were ok. The bartenders were on their phone the entire time and it took forever to get anything I ordered (which was a long time given that I had to hunt my waitress down).

But the food wasn&#39;t the problem honestly. It was the wait for the food that was the real problem. 

I ordered through GrubHub at just after 6pm and received a notification saying my food should be expected sometime between 730-740pm. Well around 755pm I called the restaurant to see where my salads where. Management told me he would&#39;ve there any second......

So I call again nearly 15mins later and let management  (Jimmy? Maybe Timmy? Sorry I suck with names) know the food still isn&#39;t here. So he calls the driver and finds out it will be an additional 10 mins til the driver will get to me. All I can think of is how shitty my salads are going to be after 30 plus minutes past the expected delivery time. 

Now here&#39;s the only reason I am giving them 3 stars: the manager made 2 brand new fresh salads and drove them to me himself with a conciliatory piece of cheesecake. He got to me by 830 and was polite and apologetic for my less than stellar experience. I can appreciate the effort to make things right."

I&#39;ve come in here to order a quart of bruschetta which I&#39;ve paid $10 for in the past.  No bread, just the bruschetta, a quart mind you.  Ordered today, my bill was 25$, really?  Was told the manager said was the price.  I said thanks but no thanks and they acted as such an inconvenience.  The &#39;senior&#39; waitress yelled at the person who took my order (who seemed newer), to cancel the order, so uncalled for."

Just never made it there. On Easter my family was talking about the wonderful pizza.... And the restaurant being owned by The Salerno&#39;s.... So my friend and I decided to try it out today.....  Neither one of us have never been here.... We walk in and stand there? Are we supposed to wait for someone to seat us or just get a table ourselves? No one said a word or acknowledged that we were there so we sat down at a table.  Finally a younger girl with a tattoo came over and greeted us... Brought menus... Took our drink order. This was about 3:00 p.m.... There were a few people at the bar and a few tables with customers as well. This is not a big place.  I got my Sierra Mist. My friend had to wait as they were brewing a fresh pot of coffee. A different server Valerie came and took our order. Pasta for my friend. Gluten Free Pasta Primavera for me. Usually a $3.0 up charge? That&#39;s a bit steep. I asked for my veggie well cooked. I got broccoli cheese soup which was light &amp; tasty and my friend salad. Finally her coffee comes! She opened up a small cream container and dumped it in.... ICK! MOLD floating on the top of her coffee....I wish I would have taken a picture;-(;-(... This just about turned my friend&#39;s stomach ... And could no longer eat her salad.... It was pretty gross looking.... Blue &amp; White glob just floating on top of coffee? We finally got the attention of one of the servers.... Who looked at it like &#34;what&#39;s wrong&#34;... Then she said...&#34;oh you must have gotten some old cream...&#34; She whisked away the coffee and brought out new with new cream she got from the cooler herself. Then we got our food. My friends was good but my Gluten Free Spaghetti Noodles were not cooked all the way through. I took about 4 bites and then decided to wait to get our server (Valerie&#39;s) attention. I told her about my chewy pasta and she took my food back to the Kitchen.  A few moments later marching over with my food in hand. &#34;The Chef says he cooked the GF Pasta.. The Normal Time.. Like always.. You must be used to a different type of GF Pasta&#34;...
Really Now..... Hmmmmm..... I&#39;ve been eating Gluten Free Pasta for 5 years now.  I eat GF Fusilli from Noodles &amp; Company about once a week. I&#39;ve eaten at Macaroni Grill, Maggiano&#39;s...Olive Garden. Biaggi&#39;s. Traverso&#39;s. Fiamme. Clara&#39;s.... All of their GF Pasta&#39;s. 

It would have taken a minute to cook my pasta in a microwave(if they have one). That what I did at home. It was much better tasting tonight. It was the attitude that got me. Just.. Sorry.. You&#39;re out of luck. Valerie never came back with my friends coffee later.... In the end she did deduct the $2.50 off our bill for coffee. The right thing to do would have been to comp my friends meal;-(. I didn&#39;t get the $3 up charge for chewy GF Pasta and Valerie asked us to PLEASE try the restaurant again. She Promised to make it better next time.? Why not make it right the 1st time????My food was great tasting. My husbands Pasta great as well but not too sure I will be going back anytime soon..... Who knows what other moldy ingredients are lurking behind the kitchen door??????The Music was So Freaking Loud you could barely have a conversation? Mid Afternoon on a Weekday?  Of well.. Better luck next time....."

Initial impression: parking is street, and there are a million doors on the building but the actual entrance was not clearly market, or maybe we were having a serious blonde moment, but we seriously walked around the whole building once before it was clear where the front door was.  Ha!  

Anyway.  I ordered the gluten free pizza.  Anyone who eats gluten free knows that pizza kind of becomes just a shadow of a memory, and GF versions are usually just shades of tolerable.  HOWEVER, this was excellent.  I actually became suspicious that they were lying to me and giving me non-GF pizza, it was so good.  Nope, no getting sick.  It&#39;s GOOD.  Flaky, flavorful.  More like what I remember real pizza tasting like.  I need to get back there one day.  High recommend."

It&#39;s decent, but is a bar with tables jammed together that is really loud, which is a combination of bad acoustics (open joist space) and patrons yelling over each other.   Music came and went, then a Hawks game came on and no game or music, so we were entertained by &#34;fascinating&#34; conversations of our fellow patrons on all sides of us.

Food was just o.k. I had a burger with blue cheese crumbles and a side salad which came 5 minutes after my burger.   My wife&#39;s entrée salad was just o.k. as well.  The toasted ravioli appetizer was not worth the money or calories.   The filling was not good or flavorful at all.

We&#39;ve tried to go occasionally through the years, but there is usually a wait to get a table and no where to sit to wait.  It&#39;s a bar that happens to serve food, and that&#39;s fine."

I have not noticed the lack of service other reviewers have experienced. Perhaps the manager is cracking the whip more often but most of the girls seem to hustle quite a bit. Everyone is friendly, music not too loud, plenty of TV&#39;s to watch, local clientele who engage you in conversation. All good. 

The only thing that kept me from offering 5 stars was the experience with the pizza. First time I ordered it, I got the traditional crust. The crust was too hard, chewy, and not easy to cut with the side of a fork. That&#39;s not my thing, but otherwise the ingredients were fresh, the pie was crafted reasonably well, and while it wasn&#39;t unique in any way it was okay for a local tavern. 2nd time I ordered it (can you tell I like pizza?) I ordered the &#39;thin&#39; crust, and basically got almost the exact same crust. Hard, chewy, and it didn&#39;t seem any thinner than the first one. A good pizza place has strict regimens for creating their food, and the quality control here is a little out of whack. Otherwise the pizza was good, not great. Typical ingredients but nothing extraordinary. Go ahead and order it; the grandkids will totally like it!

I can&#39;t comment on the rest of the food at this point. Suffice it to say the place is almost always busy and the kitchen is working overtime trying to keep up, a good sign of satisfied customers since it&#39;s a destination and not a place you&#39;d wander into. Bon appetit!"

We sat outside on the patio. The train station is directly across the street, so if you have little ones, it&#39;s perfect entertainment, but if you&#39;re going for a more intimate setting, sit inside. Eviva is in the heart of Lisle, and being right by the train station, there&#39;s lots of street and foot traffic.

I had to go inside to get menus and to alert staff we were there. Service was a bit slow, but it was 6:30p and business was starting to pick up, especially near the bar. They had great drink specials. We chose the $2 light drafts, but they also had $5 domestic IPAs and $4 Bacardi you-call-its.  We picked a large pizza with traditional crust. You can also choose a thin or even an extra thin crust. The pizza took about 20 minutes and it was just enough to feed 2 adults and 2 very hungry preschoolers (who have large appetites). 

When it was time to leave, it took longer than we anticipated to receive our check to get where we needed to go. But our server was sweet and apologetic. 

Will we be back here? Absolutely! It&#39;s a great place to go within our small community to see friends and neighbors and to meet new people as well!"

So after a frustrating morning of shopping we stopped in.

For drinks, we weren&#39;t in the mood for beer so we chose Bloody Mary&#39;s. They are 25 ounces, and are $9 with $7 refills; I can dig that. On Sundays they have a &#34;Build your own Bloody Mary Bar&#34; but our server never elaborated when we placed our drink order. After deciding to skip appetizers, we ordered a large Evviva pizza and waited anxiously to taste deliciousness.

The inside of Evviva is your typical sports bar- multiple flat screen t.v.&#39;s, a Touch Tunes music player,  and a combo of both low and high-top tables. It obviously is decorated for Christmas with lights strung around the ventilation system and mini Christmas trees hung upside down from the ceiling. 

The Bloody Mary&#39;s are very spicy, which is awesome. Between the pizza and the Bloody&#39;s (I had two) I left with a serious case of heartburn, which is was fine with me. It was well worth it.

The Evviva pizza was phenomenal. Who knew artichokes would go so well on a pizza? And of course, you can&#39;t beat black olives and bacon. The chicken was exceptional; the flavor was so good. I don&#39;t know what they seasoned it with, but it was very tasty. The pizza crust itself is like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced. Crispy, but not too crispy and chewy but not too chewy.

For a Sunday, it was fairly quiet (we arrived at noon when they opened) but our service was a bit spotty. It wasn&#39;t a huge issue, as we were in no hurry.  I can imagine during peak times it can be frustrating. Today was an enjoyable experience between a small crowd (less than 15 patrons), football games, and country music (my fave) playing throughout the speakers.

Regardless,  we will be back. In the bf&#39;s words &#34;any place with awesome pizza and 25 oz Bloody&#39;s is okay in my book.&#34;"

Then my fiancé finally remembered Evvivas. He said he had been there back in the day and it was good. I said ok as I was willing to finally get good pizza. 

The food was amazing. We had a pizza which was gooey and cheesy. The crust was traditional which was a pan pizza I think. So good. No complaints at all.

A number of reasons I can&#39;t give a 5, but the #1 is the inconsistent customer service. Sometimes it is spot on and above; other times it is deplorable- just depends on the luck (or, unluck as the case may be) of the draw. Generally, the bartenders are highly skilled, but the floor staff is young and lacking. 

That aside, the food here is great. Highly recommend the pizza (especially Italian beef and giardiniera) and almost all of the appetizers. Burgers are decent and so are the rest of the sandwiches. The weekday specials can&#39;t be beat, and the location right off the train makes Pazzos, n/k/a Evvivas, a must-try.

Ask for Katie V. as your server, Jen (friendly blonde) or Camille (doe-eyed brunette) as your bartender, and if Rob the manager/owner is in, say hi and tell him how much you are enjoying yourself"

I ordered their barbecued ribs dinner  after talking about the sauce and cooking procedures with the waitress.  Their ribs are over steamed and came out two different colors (uncooked in middle) and because of the over steaming the meat is watery(soupy texture).
After talking to the waitress about my dissatisfaction to see if they were going to bring a manager to discuss the situation she simply just asked me if I wanted my check.

He apologized for the delay and offered us a drink but we declined because we were starving. He assured us that he would adjust our bill for the aggravation and get the order out ASAP. The order arrived 15 minutes later and was thick crust and not the thin we ordered. We assumed that the manager would deduct the pizza from our bill but instead he only deducted $5.00 for waiting over an hour and 20 minutes for a pizza that usually takes 20-30 minutes to make.

HOWEVER,  the service is notoriously awful. Waitresses are inattentive and forgetful. And in the warmer weather they seem to have a fruit fly problem.

They are always crazy busy so don&#39;t be surprised if it takes longer for your food to be made than what was told to you over the phone. Personally, I don&#39;t mind waiting the extra minutes given how delicious their food is. 

Customer service is on point, too. 

Definitely try the Tony Salerno&#39;s Special! We order it every time."

The waitresses worked together to take orders and everything came out at once! The appetizers, pizza, and sandwiches were very good.

A Salernos family pizza place which says a lot,  and of course the tastes are reminiscent of old time Berwyn  Cicero. Apparently these kids haven&#39;t learned anything about service from their parents and grandparents though. Pizza came out first,  then fried mushrooms about ten minutes later,  then five minutes after that my kids&#39; sliders. Not one stop at the table to see how we were doing,  and never did get a drink refill. The place is grossly understaffed and pretty much filthy. I guess that&#39;s what kids of successful entrepreneurs do- get lazy, and maybe greedy. It&#39;s a crying shame this place is the way it is. With the food it serves, people will come.  However,  I believe there would be double the people if they clean and get people in and out in a timely fashion. All that said,  I will probably still order delivery and try to forget what it smells like in the restaurant. 

If you go bring some baby wipes and make sure you use the bathroom before you leave the house. As far as the food is concerned,  if your pallette is still enact after smelling the place you will thoroughly enjoy a classic Chicago Italian tradition."

My selection of pasta with vodka sauce ($11.00) came without the added chicken ordered (another $3, for a total of $14.00).  I contacted Grubhub and oh, how nice.  The restaurant credited me for $3.  How about a full credit of $14.00?! 

Rigatoni with vodka sauce and no chicken as ordered, is a completely different meal.  And worst yet, as I explained to Grubhub, the sauce was BLAND.  I could&#39;ve thrown some pasta in a pot in less time that I waited for the order and my jarred sauce would&#39;ve tasted better!!!  The mozzarella sticks were fine, albeit really salty.  Not sure about the chocolate cake as I haven&#39;t tried it (I was starving).  

Will not order from this restaurant again.  I wish I would&#39;ve looked at the reviews before ordering.... Bland taste and lack of seasonings were mentioned before.  And I&#39;m not happy with grubhub (who I really do love) even though the did give me a $5 credit for a new order.  I reached out to them a 2nd time saying I&#39;m not satisfied bc plain pasta vs pasta w chicken are two different meals.  The noted that all Evviva would credit is $3... NOT HAPPY!  Taste your food before serving, Evviva and make sure the orders are right!!!  To err is human but how about making customers happy???

***Response to Owner&#39;s Comments to my Review***
1) Regarding your manager not correcting the situation as well as you would have...This is not an extraordinary complaint.  Clearly there has not been proper training of management on customer service which is key in any business.  I ordered my food at 4:45pm and complained about the error shortly after delivery.  Busy or not, a good manager should know how to handle this sort of complaint without much thought.  And...I find it insulting that you would even mention that many people complain in order to get free food.  The mistake was clearly yours.  I do not need a free meal from you or anyone else, thank you.

2) As to my statement/opinion that the vodka sauce was bland, I stick by it. I am no stranger to vodka sauce - it&#39;s one of my absolute favorites.  Therefore, I consider my palate to be a fair judge on what has a good taste and what is bland.  My assertion was honest and in my opinion, correct.  Not to gain a &#34;free&#34; meal as you suggested in your comments - AGAIN. 

3) As far as criticizing my rating of your restaurant goes, I&#39;m in awe.  As a consumer, I am entitled to my opinion.  That&#39;s what the Yelp community is about.  And yes, you are entitled to rebut. But you don&#39;t have the right to challenge how I felt about my experience.  Most people will take the time to review a restaurant when they are either over-joyed or very disappointed.  It&#39;s an opportunity to improve, not complain that you will now need two 5-star reviews to counteract that.

4) I would strongly suggest some customer service training for both you as the owner and your staff.  I have been in high-end sales for 20+ years and have been extremely successful not only for my consultative style but also ensuring stellar customer service.  You can turn a problem into an opportunity to build a stronger relationship with a client/customer simply by demonstrating care and taking extra steps to correct the situation.  Not by providing excuses and insults strewn within a half apology... 

Thank for the offer to try your restaurant for a 2nd time but there are just too many other options and your comments actually made me feel that much more strongly about my 1 star review."

Unfortunately, I don&#39;t drink so I was forced to suffer through a bland at best meal (ever heard of herbs and spices?) in a loud and unappealing bar. I ordered tortellini with ham and mushrooms and the ham was literally thinly sliced sandwich meat. The Mac and Cheese gave my son diarrhea, and I am totally unsure if the cheese it was made with was even real. Anyway, I&#39;m sure this place is fine for booze and wings but don&#39;t recommend ordering anything that resembles a meal."

Unlike other reviewers I&#39;ve always experienced  stellar service but it&#39;s usually from one server in particular.

I believe her name is Tabitha. She&#39;s outstanding at what she does always on top of refilling drinks and has a great personality. Not to mention she&#39;s pretty easy on the eyes :). Besides Tab, the pizza and drink specials make this place great. 

Do yourself a favor, drop what your doing, request Tabitha to be your server and order a traditional sausage and pepperoni. It&#39;s the perfect combo."

I came home from work very tired, and very hungry; so I decided to order for delivery.  I ordered the Steak Sandwich with cheese, which also comes with a side of Fries.

The cut of steak that I was served was 60% meat and 40% fat, which really irritated me.  If you ask me, that is terrible service; what kind of chef/cook would serve a cut of steak that had so much fat on it.  He/she should have thrown it out and cooked a new one, but instead they decided to serve it to me as is.  I have a feeling that had I been dining in the restaurant, they would have never served me that cut of steak --as I  surely would have sent it back.

Additionally, the steak was seemingly unseasoned.  It lacked flavor, and I can tell that it was neither seasoned before cooking, nor afterwards.  Simply putting sauce would have made it much better, but there was none.

All in all I was very disappointed and will not be eating from this establishment anytime in the near future.  You do not serve steak that is nearly half fat, and you should at least season the steak with salt/pepper --or at the very least forewarn us that it is served unseasoned."

When I disputed my bill I was told that drinks were already taken off.  I wound up explaining my situation to my server then the owner, who informed me that two of the fireball shots on my bill were from me buying him and his employee(a friend who was sitting with us) a shot.  After I informed him I didn&#39;t buy him a drink, he said he&#39;d take care of it.  A few minutes later he handed me back the same the same tab with a dirty look and not a word left his mouth.  He glared at me a few more times before I left.  

In all seriousness I didn&#39;t think customer service this bad existed..... Pizza&#39;s not bad though."

I&#39;ve also had the pleasure of dining in as well. It&#39;s a nice space with exposed brick. Gone a few times on the weekends never had any problems getting a table. The patio is also nice. 

Prices on the menu are very good. Plus they offer lots of weekday specials. 

My one complaint is sometimes they play music to loud. I don&#39;t like having to shout at the person across from me when we&#39;re having dinner.

The cocktails were always their strength, albeit they seem to be increasingly sweet over time, so I&#39;m assuming that they are engaging more and more in concocting high-fructose delights.  I must comment that their pizza is definitely one of the best in Lisle, so they have that going for them.
I visited a couple of nights ago, and first of all, the room was ass cold and not comfortable to sit in for very long.  The cocktails were lip-pursing sweet.  The service was slow.  Our server definitely put the &#34;wait&#34; in &#34;wait&#34;-ress.  Usually, we munch on the tasty pizza, but this time we decided to give the pulled pork nachos a try.  Granted, the pork on the nachos was pretty good, and the chips themselves seemed to be made in house.  However, the chips were slathered in cheese (perhaps &#34;slathered&#34; is an understatement; let&#39;s go with &#34;drowned&#34;) whiz, and some sort of dressing that I think was supposed to be sour cream but just wasn&#39;t.  We didn&#39;t particularly want to finish them, and tried our best to find some stray diced tomatoes and green onions that were tainted with orange fake cheese.
I&#39;ll probably be back to Evviva, but will stick to the pizza exclusively from now on, and forget the drinks."

The beer Celsius wasn&#39;t gigantic, maybe 20 beers, but they have alk if the bases covered.  Anywhere with at least some Lagunitas on tap scores ok in my book!  

We had some fried ravioli and 2 pizzas.  The ravioli was good, and the pizza was great. We did wait almost an hour for our pizza, and the previously attentive waitress went M.i.a. For a short while in that timeframe. I&#39;m guessing she had a break and nobody covered for her. 

Overall, service was ok and the food was pretty good.  It&#39;s a loud sports bar atmosphere, and plenty of TV&#39;s everywhere to see the game"

I was wrong in the best possible way. Perfectly divey on the inside, this bar/restaurant has wonderful specials (at least during the day) and delicious food. My seafood loving friend said it was a unique grilled calamari that happened to be the best calamari she&#39;s ever had.

Evviva&#39;s pizza is my go to pizza for a few reasons:
1.) I live very close. 
2.) My wife is Gluten-Free and their GF Hawaiian Pizza is down right delicious.
3.) Best thin crust pizza due to their cheese choice and plentiful toppings.    

Evviva&#39;s Atmosphere is similar to a frat bar with 40 year olds in it, instead of college students. I&#39;m 27 and hate how the patrons of this Eatery act. Not very friendly. 

Overall, stay for the pizza and leave for the snobby a-holes."

He and my sister-in-law always talk about how cool the place is and how great the food is. The drink menu seemed decent and with a wide selection of drinks and specialty beers, and the food looked pretty good ... except we ordered an appetizer sampler and everything was obviously frozen food, nothing special, including overly rubbery calamari. Oh, and a long, black, curly hair in it.

The waitress was apologetic and the manager did offer us a new platter, but then we had to wait until half hour for the second platter. They offered us free &#39;house&#39; shots and it seemed pretty nice, until I realized that all the staff were doing these shots with the patrons. Multiple times. I agree with the folks who&#39;ve already reviewed the atmosphere as older folks trying to act young again. About 5-6 40-year-olds were hanging in one corner doing these free shots all night while the manager joined in on the fun. 

Our waitress was okay ... she seemed to be ready to ask me for refills whenever I was low, but we always had to flag her down to get my brother a refill. One time, we were both ready but she only asked me then walked away - didn&#39;t even look at him.

A week or so later, my sister-in-law ordered delivery pizza for my niece&#39;s birthday and we were fairly satisfied. I had the sausage, which was flavorful. I also tried the margherita, which was bland with giant pieces of basil that I couldn&#39;t really chew through and had to pull out of my mouth. The tomato pieces were huge and after 1-2 bites, all ingredients were off the crust and I was left with really bland dough."

A few months ago we discovered Evviva Bar and Eatery and are sure glad we did. Going in, as a Restaurant/Bar place I expected the food to be just okay but was pleasantly delighted to find out that the food is very, very good. 

Today we were greeted by Tattiana with a smile, and she remembered our preferred drinks from the last time which was nice and made us feel welcome. We like going in there on Sundays since the appetizers are 1/2 off. Not only that but it is the only place in the area that we know of that has Grilled Calamari on their menu and is it ever tasty. 

To go along with the Grilled Calamari, I had a Blackened Salmon Salad which was very tasty and my brother-in-law had a delicious burger. 

Not only is it a great place to catch a game as they have a great deal of HD TV&#39;s in the establishment but it is also family friendly and conveniently located with convenient parking.

I want to say &#34;it&#39;s me, not them&#34;, but I think it&#39;s them.

Now don&#39;t get me wrong, lunch is 50% off, for that price I can occasionally deal with the slow SLOW service and indifferent attitudes of the staff. 

But anything other than lunch, it&#39;s not a good experience at full price.
 
An typical example would be last night, I seat myself outside and sit 15 min before the staff notices I&#39;m there. 
The waitress acted as if she had never heard of the beer I ordered, even though it was on the menu. She even brought me the bottle and asked me if it was the right one. 

I guess no one has ever pronounced &#34;Hacker Pschorr weiss&#34; properly in this bar so the staff doesn&#39;t know that&#39;s the beer I want. 

We ordered the thin crust tomato cheese pizza... it was... bad... no flavor at all. After raiding their cart of spices, we made it edible by dousing it in Olive oil and pepper. The cheese on the pizza had no pieces of spice anywhere.  for 20 bucks, I really was expecting tasty pizza, but no.

In the middle of dinner, workers decided to start drilling into the building. They were putting up 4 TVs. Why can&#39;t this wait till you don&#39;t have 10 + people on your patio? 

In general, the parking is a PITA, the service slow and indifferent, the food just ok. 
And it&#39;s noisy than a coffee can of angry hornets inside in the  bar. With the occasional train and now the TVs outside,  the hornets will now be outside too. 

I recommend you take a pass."

There are a LOT of TV&#39;s here which is great to watch games and they&#39;re really good about changing them for you. 

They have recently updated their taps and have a lot of craft beer to choose from, including one of my favorites, Purple Haze. The wine list they have is actually pretty good for a &#34;hole in the wall.&#34;  They have a lot of different events including the block party which is a lot of fun, but it&#39;s crawling with people... i would totally suggest going to anyone!

Here&#39;s my issue. A lot of the girls there... are not great. It&#39;s a seat yourself atmosphere, and sometimes seat yourself is a gamble. You can be sitting there for a few minutes before anyone comes over (busy or not). More often than not, you&#39;re sitting with an empty beer before they even come back to see if you want another one.  The bartenders are extremely self-absorbed, but AWESOME at what they do. It&#39;s hard when their boyfriends / regulars are sitting at the bar to get any sort of attention. It has gotten better over the years, and i think the service will get there eventually, i just wish it got here now :) 

Go here if you want some awesome comfort food and a good atmosphere!"

Our bartender/server, Stacy, was so attentive and nice. She was so helpful recommending items on the menu. I really appreciate it when servers can honestly tell me which items are good, and which items are not preferred. 

Sure seems like a neighborhood bar - but not the kind that is unwelcoming. Everyone here was really really nice and fun to talk to. We will definitely be back to try more on their menu. 

Also - prices are very, very reasonable. Solid find."

We got the chicken wings for our app, and by the suggestion of a someone in the group who frequents this bar, asked for the &#34;tequila flavor&#34; (not on the menu). They ended up being dry, tough and had very little meat overall.

The sausage pizza for our entree was an improvement. There was a lot of meat and just the right amount of gooey cheese. However, there was little seasoning so I topped it with whatever shakers of spices were on the table. Plus the crust had a bit of a cardboard texture.

In the end, the drink specials and friendly/divey atmosphere made this place semi-worth the late night visit."

We arrived about 5:30 on a Friday.  The place was almost full.  We were greeted within seconds of walking in.  We picked a table and a minute or two later, Maria was there to take our order.  We started with the much hyped wings.  They were good.  Crunchy skin and moist on the inside.  We got the &#34;mild&#34; which had the right amount of heat for us.  We followed this with a burger, well done, and the combo sandwich.  The burger was cook properly but not dried out.  The combo was OK.  The fries were average.  While we sat there I looked around the room.  I noticed that, not counting staff and my wife, there were only three other women in the place.  And as someone else has said it is LOUD in there.

Bottom line: Average food, good service.  Give it a try when you are in the mood for a bar atmosphere."

Yep, you heard right. The boobage here is off the charts. I guess that&#39;s great if you want to see some bewbies but don&#39;t want to tell your significant other that you went to a more blatantly named restaurant, like say &#39;Hooters&#39; or &#39;Jubblies&#39; (hypothetical), but I don&#39;t know. It made even this former queen of inappropriate cleavage a little uncomfortable for them. But hey, if you feel good about yourself and your boss is okay with it- get that money, gurl.  

Speaking of jugs, they&#39;re one of the few places in the area that offer mixed drinks in fish bowl sized jugs. I, personally, am not a fan because I don&#39;t have health insurance and I&#39;d rather not get sick from sharing some super sugary novelty drink but the place was packed so obvi there&#39;s a market there for it. 

It would&#39;ve been nice to see some better quality beer but judging from the large crowd on this particular night, they&#39;re doing alright with what they&#39;ve got. 

All in all, it wasn&#39;t my kind of place but it seemed like it was a hit among the college aged crowd so I&#39;ll let the kiddos have this one."

One huge plus...all lunch items are half price every day.  I got an enormous buffalo chicken sandwich with fries and a coke for $8.00.  That $8.00 included a $2 tip!  The food was pretty darn good, I must say.

There are a couple of downsides to this place.  One is, the parking is a nightmare.  The other is, don&#39;t go here if you are limited on time.  Service is extremely slow.  We were just lucky that our boss was out of town and we didn&#39;t have to be back so soon."

Decent place, patio is good for people watching, pizza was also very good.

We arrived towards the end of lunch. Someone cleared an empty table for us and we sat down. It was almost 10 minutes before anyone realized we hadn&#39;t been helped.  We ordered our drinks and they were delivered fairly quickly. However, the soda my friend got was flat.  When she mentioned it to the server she said that she had noticed that it looked flat.  So you brought it anyway? Awesome. She also had to ask twice for water.

Two of us were craving pizzas so we asked how long the individual pizzas took to cook and were told about 15-20 minutes. Ok, so we ordered.  About 30 minutes later the server came and told us that there had been a problem with one of them and they&#39;d be up in 5 minutes.  17 minutes later they finally came out. This is my lunch break, I don&#39;t have all damn day.  The pizza was pretty decent, lots of toppings, too much cheese for my taste. 

Since we were running so late now, my friend said we were going to need the check soon even though we were only halfway done eating.  One could infer that maybe we were in a hurry? The server brought it pretty quickly, we put the credit card in the folder and set it back on the table. The server walked past several times with out looking at it, then vanished into he kitchen.  We didn&#39;t have cash so we had no choice but to sit there.

The only saving grace is that they do half price lunches. So two soft drinks, one appetizer, three lunch entrees only came to $18. But it took an hour and a half which is ridiculous. They also don&#39;t have their own parking which can be a real pain.  We might go back occasionally, but most likely not for lunch and definitely not when we&#39;re in a hurry."

It was packed, there&#39;s no one greeting anyone at the front so my boyfriend and I were confused as to if it was seat yourself or if we had to wait for someone.

This would be a fair to good bar if the gals tending the bar were all sat down by management and informed that their prime responsibility was to wait on customers rather than fluff their hair, text on their phones, pose for photos and other personal activities that have nothing to do with waiting on customers.

It&#39;s a good thing that they have TV&#39;s with sports on because odds are you are going to be waiting a lot.

If i should happen to go back-i&#39;ll check the menu on their website so i can avoid having to ask for a menu and then waiting again.

I felt their food is better than average with a good menu of choices, drink specials are good and the pour on mixed drinks is on the generous side.

@Candice- I am wagering that the melons on display are store bought rather than home grown; It sort of ruins the experience for me. What say you?"

I have no complaints about this place, even when the service is less than average because it&#39;s so good, close by, and I keep coming back.

Once in a while they have theme nights, or live music...it&#39;s not overly crowded after work as it&#39;s near the metra and also has outdoor/indoor seating.

One of our last visits there we got a coupon from Matt (one of the Managers) for a free pizza on our next visit as we informed him of what good service we got from the bus boy.  Our waitress took our order and was never heard from again...apparently she had a family emergency and left so the bus boy took over but even he gave us great service.

Early dinner on a Sunday night,  they had a decent crowd but it wasn&#39;t busy. Our server Lydia didn&#39;t seem to keen on us being indecisive about what we wanted in our first 5 minutes of sitting down. She frequented the table enough but the service wasn&#39;t on point and below basic standards. 

Firstly, she brought out everyone&#39;s order but the wings I ordered and walked away without mentioning anything. When we asked about them she said they didn&#39;t have enough clean dishes. I don&#39;t understand what kind of excuse that is but my wings came out 15 minutes later with no apologies and I had to eat while my friends were done eating. Then, to top it off she brings the check and we have to ask 3 times to bring out a to-go container for the wings that I obviously didn&#39;t really want to pay for. 

Overall,  the food was ok. Nothing special, if we had better service or at least a smile. Maybe I wouldn&#39;t mind coming back. Sorry but I&#39;ll take my business to Shanahan&#39;s. At least they can get my order out on time and the crowd and servers are much friendlier."

It&#39;s a little embarrassing when your friends drive a distance to meet you there and the place tries to kick you out way before they close because the want to go home. I had this happen a couple times but this was the worst one. It was a Sunday and they were open till 1 am. I get it if it&#39;s empty and the staff wants to go home but you shouldn&#39;t make paying customers feel rushed and give them attitude. It was like 10:30 pm and I could tell they wanted to leave. All the chairs were stacked up on the tables and instead of coming over to us and saying &#34;hey we will probably close early so whenever you finish we will close down&#34; the bartender shouts at us and says &#34; ok time to go...get out.&#34; And I looked at my friend in disbelief. Like you aren&#39;t going to thank us for our business but instead say get out! Honestly we probably would have left on our own within 5 minutes because there were a few people who just left and it was obvious they wanted to leave. But to shout at us was not only unprofessional but rude. Maybe they should change their hours. Just a thought!

This weekend they had a cowgirl contest and you could win a $250 cash prize. So, my sister and I grabbed our cowgirl hats and got ready for some line dancing. We heard this place was a cougar bar and figured we&#39;d have it in the bag (which we would&#39;ve if they ever bothered to do the contest!).

When my sister called the place to make sure it was happening, the guy on the phone said it would be from 7:00-8:00pm. Great. At about 8:30pm we asked our waitress (some lady who was too eager to get the bill jacked up. she must&#39;ve asked us 10 times in 12 minutes if she could get us anything else) when the contest was. About thirty minutes later she said she&#39;d ask the manager. Meanwhile, sister and I learned some line dances which were easy and fun but we were like 2 of 5 on the dance floor so that made it pretty lame. 

Then, at around 10:00 our server said the contest is happening at 10:30. Fast forward an hour later, still no contest. They advertised 8:00pm an event would happen and over 3 and a half hours later it had not.

Unlike some restaurants, where they will serve the main course and then our appetizer will be served. Chilli&#39;s is unique and the customer service gets more than 5 stars.

Do the servers that work here even care at least an ounce towards their customers? The server I had sounded so empty and not welcoming. Not to mention the fact that he was too busy talking to other servers to pay attention to anyone else.

My sister asked for the bill and then he said he would bring it. While we are waiting for the bill, we see him talking to other servers and totally disregarding our presence. I had to remind him again after ten minutes of waiting and then when he brought over the check, he just dropped it on the table with no care whatsoever.

Our server was so friendly and helpful, knew the products, had great recommendations, good timing, and always had a smile. It seems rare to find this kind of service much anymore. It was even nicer to find it right here at Chilis. Enjoyed the food, good deals for the amount of food we ate! I would return to this one and hopefully get our cool server again."

It wasn&#39;t busy but they seemed to have a full staff fooling around in the kitchen from what I could hear.  But the worst of it was my salsa. I got home and we started eating it until we found a soggy old chip in it. They seem to have all their chips pre-packed. So there should be no way a chip could fall in. Unless they are recycling their salsa from the dine in tables. Which seems to be how this location would operate. I&#39;m disgusted and done with this chilis for good.

This location has had such bad service to the point where I was just tired of complaining and gave up and started going to the one in Oswego that renewed our hope in Chilis. The food at this location is almost always cold. We continued to have an issue with rare burgers, including the kids meal burgers. We kept having issues with cold fries. I even had a waitress tell me that I couldn&#39;t get soup with my meal if I was going to give it to my daughter because only the person who ordered the meal was supposed to eat the soup. My daughter was 5 at the time and loves soup. She was trying to make me pay extra for a cup of soup. I did complain to managers and I even got a gift card and kept giving it a try but the service was just too bad. I hate complaining to managers because I don&#39;t want to come off as someone who is trying to get free food. So I just gave up on this location."

It used to be a great meal and great environment, a destination on route 59 for dinner. Now I am genuinely worried every time that I go in with my family that something will go wrong.

We go out to eat as a family once to twice a week in Naperville. Family of 3. We have visited this Chilis 3 times in the last 3 months and twice had a poor experience.

From under-cooked steaks, to slow service, to waiting at the door for two minutes before a hostess greets you when the restaurant is empty, to 45 minutes to prepare your food and not even an apology even though people who came after you are eating before you, to dirty tables, to not being allowed to sit in a booth because no one is assigned to that section (its five feet away from where you are going to seat us!), to burnt kid&#39;s meals. I can go on all night.

This Chili&#39;s has seen its standards drop. Construction hurts business, but that doesn&#39;t excuse filthiness, food that isn&#39;t prepared correctly, or service that forget what the word service means.

Hopefully one day Chilis will care enough to go inside this restaurant and fix it. Get it back to what it once was, a fun clean and well staffed place to go for a good meal."

Obviously their business model works, they are a chain restaurant and people keep coming.  A few years ago, they took mozzarella sticks (excuse me, fried cheese) off the menu.  Then it came back.  Now the Southwest chicken wrap is off the menu.  Curse!

I had lunch here with my parents on a Saturday afternoon.  It was very busy, and it appeared the waiters had a little trouble keeping up with the tables (mostly families with small children).  It could&#39;ve been a kitchen issue, as it took a long time to get our food.

The food was good.  I really like the Triple Dipper (choose 3 appetizers) when I can&#39;t decide what I want, and when I promise myself I can&#39;t eat an entire plate of chicken crispers.  Chicken crispers alone are delicious, but it&#39;s a massive, artery-clogging meal.  The Triple Dipper is too, I can&#39;t lie about that, but I love their southwestern eggrolls.  I usually get the fried cheese (eyeroll) as my 3rd choice and it makes a perfect, guilty-pleasure, I-eat-like-an-American, meal.

This time I had the eggrolls, spinach &amp; artichoke dip, and the mini burgers.  The burgers were terrible.  Dry bun and patty, with a teensy bit of cheese and some bacon crumbs.  Blah!

Great food, good service, overall not a bad option in the Fox Valley mall area."

The server was good about bringing me some &#34;hot&#34; fries, but these had the same bland leathery taste.

Well---I love this place. Especially if I just go with one of my girls...when we can&#39;t decide on a place to eat on 59 ..we go here....it&#39;s in the middle of all the restaurants on 59 and there is never too much of a long wait. 

They got a good deal right now! 2 people eat for 20 dollars...really? Can you beat that? I know these kind of deals are popular right now but still...you get to sit, customer service is delightful, and this place can leave a you enough food to save for lunch the next day!

I always love their wings and eggrolls (similar to the one at Cheesecake Factory!) and my absolute favorite is their Cajun Chicken Pasta (I like spicy -and this is spicy-yum!) My girl is a Vegetarian and even if she smells meat in her food she does not eat it...and once she smelled it, they apologized after doing their research and finding out that the oil is cooked in with the same food they made for her and they without her complaining took it off the bill and she got something new! 

If you are a VEGE lover, you can get the cajun pasta with veges like broccoli, tomatoes, whatever (they add it without trouble!)

- Omit the red bell peppers
- Substitute crispy chicken for grilled chicken

The specialty drink I ordered tasted like water from the first sip. The glass was filled to the rim with ice so perhaps the liquor, ect was all in the sticky overflow napkin mess I was handed. My steak was undercooked &amp; my daughters food cold. We did not bother to stay for desert as planned. The waiter was sub-par during service &amp; charged us incorrectly for our meals. As my husband paid I went to the bathroom but found it, along with the back of the restaurant, unclean. It did have a surface clean to it which reminded me of how the kids &#34;clean&#34; their rooms. Given the caked-on gunk in the floors I doubt it had been cleaned in days. Or weeks.

But my Honey Chipotle BBQ Chicken Crispers are absolutely wonderful, with fries, and corn on the cob (which at first I was hesitant to try, but turned out really well).

The chicken chile soup was AMAZING.  The first soup I got was the broccoli cheddar, and upon tasting the chicken chile soup, I was instantly envious and I knew that would be my next bowl! :)  My salad was good, and my daughter loved her cheese pizza.

As always, the fries were phenomenal, and my husband&#39;s chicken fajita sandwich was DELICIOUS as well!!  The only thing that was a down side was our waitress.  She was attentive, yes, but I was sort of put off with her attitude--she never smiled and sort of acted like we were always bothering her.

We Asked for an extra plate to share one of the meals, the plate never showed up; however she was there immediately to clear my plate? As I took my last bite and as I set my fork down she snatched the plate away. Oh and don&#39;t expect to have any drinks refilled ever, ever, ever. I do recall our waitress stopping by the birthday party table next to ours a few times to check on them. These check-ins at the birthday party table stick out in my mind because she shoved my chair in every time she squeezed her way over to the far side of their table. I guess we were in the way. I have to assume that the waitress was inflicted with a bad case of diarrhea that kept her busy for the duration of our visit. Regarding the food: it was fine, not exceptionally good or bad. The Oswego IL Rt-34 location is far superior to the Naperville IL Rt-59 location. I am consistently a 20% tipper for reasonably good service, but this was so bad that I just left the difference to the next dollar and felt that maybe that was still too much.

The one time we ordered online, we were told the food would be ready for pick up in approx 15minutes. We arrived in about 20 minutes, no one was at the counter (which is normal, we&#39;ve found, at the pick up station), and when someone arrived and looked for our food, discovered the online order was never cooked. So we waited. And waited. No discount was given, but I think they gave us some free extra chips for our queso. 

The queso is definitely the redeeming quality of any Chili&#39;s. It&#39;s like a non-spicy chili cheese dip with chips. If we have leftovers, I even like to dip cold fries in it the next day.

Generally, I&#39;m also a fan of their Texas Cheese Fries - unless overcooked (as they were during our last visit). Steak fries, melted cheddar, bacon, jalapeno slices, and ranch. Good stuff. Good boneless buffalo wings, as well.

In short: Dine in&#39;s generally ok. To Go can be spotty. Don&#39;t order To Go online.

Also, the To Go area is NOT wheelchair accessible. There is a large post blocking what would be a wheelchair entrance, but alas, steps and wheelchairs don&#39;t mix."

This review can be directed to the entire Chili&#39;s chain because of them cutting down their portions and raising their prices! Especially with the Chicken Crispers and other popular dishes. By the time you tip, you are spending $15 on your meal and taking no left overs home. 

This specific location was bad because the heat was on so high that I felt like I was in a sauna. I asked the waiter to turn it down 2 times and then the manager once. It was really annoying and uncomfortable. The food wasn&#39;t even good because it came out cold. Maybe they thought the temperature in the room would cook the food.

There was no one in the front so we waited for a few minutes until a waitress came and sat us down. We had yr four month old, in her car seat, so she sat us in a booth. She took our drink order and gave us a few minutes to decide what we wanted. Our drinks came rather quickly. No straws.... Okay. My boyfriend&#39;s friend had the yelp app which guaranteed he&#39;d get ffree chips and salsa if he checked in. When those were brought out she took our order. My boyfriend got the taco  pizza, and his friend and i split the 2 for $20. We both got the 6 oz steak, his medium rare mine medium well, and half an order of the fries. The food arrived in about ten maybe fifteen minutes. The pizza was... well a taco pizza. but my boyfriend said it was good. Our plates had mashed potatoes, broccoli and garlic bread. Because i got my meat medium well it was a bit dry. Over all it was good, my daughter enjoyed the mashed potatoes. Halfway through our meal our waitress refilled the guys&#39; drinks. Shortly after i finished mine but it sat empty for another ten minutes... Awesome..... When she did realize it was empty she said she&#39;d bring another out but that took another five minutes while she cleaned a table and brought another order out. There were other employees, my guess busboys, who were just walking around not helping the Two waitresses clean anything. It wasn&#39;t very busy but having worked in a restaurant i know how hectic it can be to have tables close to closing and having to clean up as well. So i didn&#39;t really mind too much. Our bill came and it was a little over $50. Not too bad, but still a bit pricey considering what we ordered. I might be back with other people but not as a first choice for a date night."

The last straw was when my significant other ordered a fish dish and it came late, and semi-frozen... I can understand that Friday and Saturday nights are crazy busy, but semi-frozen food? Please.

Also, it&#39;s just a huge old ribfest, or they try to be. I&#39;d rather go to a real BBQ restaurant for ribs than to a Chili&#39;s. Service is also mediocre because, to be fair to the staff that&#39;s above the age of 20... they&#39;re overworked and just can&#39;t split their concentration in that many ways and do a good job at the same time."

He didn&#39;t seem that busy, but other than a couple perfunctory checks on our well being, he was absent from our space. And what is it with the young college age people who wait at these lousy chain restaurants in the north and western suburbs? His attitude was polite but icy, like he was doing us a favor by being our waiter. I have gotten this before at other chain restaurants in the more upscale suburbs. I am guessing these are young people in one of their first jobs, resentful that they finally have to work for a living. Guess what, kiddo, attitude doesn&#39;t earn you a tip.

P.S. And like the other reviewers, we came here because it was the only restaurant open. You would think the western burbs would have more variety for dining. It can turn into a ghost town quickly."

Every single item is served cold or without any flavor. Every time I go there, I will convince myself that the food might be better now, but nope, it is never. The management has to do something.

The service was abysmally slow, the food cold, and just generally tasteless. The tamales had obviously been reheated and were dense, chewy, and dry. The cheese was barely melted on the top of any of the food. My dad had one beer and the waiter never came around during the meal so that he could order another.

This was our staple! Towards the end, we started noticing a change in the business and quality...I withheld updating my review because I thought it was just a few bad experiences. But now it&#39;s been one too many.

We visited this Monday and it was likely the last time we&#39;ll go. It&#39;s a sad realization, because we truly loved Rito&#39;s but Monday&#39;s experience was just horrible. 

Long story short: it was a MONDAY night but you&#39;d have thought it was a Friday. Two servers for the entire restaurant. We waited over an HOUR for our meal from when we ordered it. We ordered an appetizer - asked for AN order of guacamole. When it was delivered, there were two cups of guac and we assumed one order was just split up - nope...the server took it upon himself to order us TWO apps and charge us for two as well. He also delivered the guac but no chips...and we sat for 20 minutes waiting for chips. My husband&#39;s meal was also incorrect.

Very disappointing service. Our server was clearly frustrated and rushed but other than an apology, we got nothing. This is a situation where a manager comes out or we&#39;re given a cheap dessert for free. We saw other tables walk in after us, and leave before we even received our meal. 

Adios, Rito&#39;s. It&#39;s been real."

We opted to try the table side Guacamole, prepared right then and there with a chattering server who kept us entertained. Very fresh and tasty. In  fact we did this twice as a few folks came late and it was worth the repeat performance. We also had them give us a &#34;flaming&#34; con queso demonstration too! Plenty of salsa (I of course asked for the super hot versions) and tortilla chips. That nearly filled us up, but we had room to try the Ritos combination (little bit of everything) and one of us ordered the Casa Del Mar (large sized shrimp cooked and served on top of rice). Interior did feel a little bit like we were in Mexico, plenty of family tables. Since we had time and were in no hurry, did not worry about the service too much (they were busy!)."

We tried the burrito sumbrosa, enchiladas, taco salad and tacos. All got thumbs up!! Their chips are delicious and salsa spicey. And most important, the margaritas delicious!

Let me start with we have only been here for lunch and only 5 times but we have only been out here for a year. The lunch service during every meal except the last time we went was awful!! We waited for a check once for over half an hour after our plates were taken!! We always seemed to get the same guy serving us also. This is just my feelings and I have absolutely no idea if it is tue but it kind of felt like he was a relative of the owners and the owners just did not want to have to deal with the rest of the family if they fired him.

On to the food. I found it good enough to keep going back. I like the burrito and tacos. My husband like the salsa and chips and is hooked on the steak tacos.  We also tried the guacamole and I was impressed, my husband who is not fond of guacamole even enjoyed it."

I know what you&#39;re all thinking, &#34;oh she&#39;s one of those &#39;the service was awful&#39; people&#34;.  I&#39;m not, though. I have no problem if someone doesn&#39;t check on my meal and refill my water glass every time I daintily sip from it.  This was a case of waiting 20 minutes to even SEE any sort of server-like creature. I didn&#39;t get a margarita until I&#39;d been sitting there eating chips for 30 minutes. We waited another 35 minutes to try and order additional drinks and/or dessert. Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t have the opportunity because someone (not our server) just brought our check. I even tried to talk to someone (Rito, who is frequently there, or a manager, which they don&#39;t really have) but they told me it&#39;s because we were sat in the wrong room. Ummm. You sat us!

The re-fried beans at Rito&#39;s are fantastic and one of my favorite things about this place. What is normally an afterthought of a side dish at most Mexican restaurants, Rito&#39;s really excels with its beans. They&#39;re amazing in texture and a perfect level of saltiness that I have yet to find replicated. The flaming margaritas have a bit of performance flair while tasting great, but be warned they are big and one will most likely take you out. Fresh quacamole made right at your table is wondeful and we have had great success with the service during all of our visits. Obviously, I highly recommend this place."

Finally we were seated and 2 small red and green salsas were brought to our table with a basket of chips. The green salsa was stale but our waiter did not look very friendly so I didn&#39;t want to say anything. 
After waiting a long while for our food and looking at the chips in front of me, I finally mustered up the courage to tell him that the salsa was not good. The waiter looked perplexed, took the green salsa behind the counter and took a taste. He made a &#34;there&#39;s-nothing-wrong-with-this face,&#34; topped off the same salsa, gave it another taste with the same expression and brought it back to the table.
Two glasses of water later, the food came! I got the Flautas with chicken and my husband ordered the Green Enchiladas with chicken. The rice was great, the Flautas were good but the beans were bland. Also, I didn&#39;t like how they covered half my Flautas with guacamole, I don&#39;t eat them like that, I would have preferred it on the side. My husband said that his Enchiladas were just okay. 
All in all, the service was mediocre and the food was passable. I will not be returning to this place since there&#39;s actual authentic Mexican restaurants out there with better service."

I was starting to think I had to go to the little taquerias to find good Mexican around here. The tableside guacamole was a nice touch. And how can you refuse when it&#39;s offered to you by a bubbly, joke-telling young fellow.  Great place to take the family or some friends for a casual and inexpensive sit-down Mexican feast,"

The table side guac and a specially prepared Margarita with my favorite blanco tequila topped off a wonderful evening.

This place is always busy and had heard good things about it, about their margaritas and food and they both were just ok. The food lacks flavor and also the spice. It&#39;s not much different then what you&#39;ll have at Pepe&#39;s. Chips and salsa are generic,  nothing to rave about. Service was mediocre at the best.
I have had better margaritas and mix way better myself,  then what you get here.
I understand it&#39;s reasonable prices on food and a good neighborhood place,  without going to go to downtown Aurora,  but it didn&#39;t hit the spot for us."

Love most things on the menu. Margaritas are a bit pricey except on Thursdays. Wish they could figure out the service issues. 

Changing my review to 1 star. We had a drink at the bar and paid the bartender. At the end of our meal, the waiter basically called us liars and said we should be honest next time. Meanwhile the bartender is pocketing the money for my drink. Never coming back here again."

We pass this place everyday since moving to the area about a year ago. We do not go out to eat often but decided it was time to try this joint after hearing such awesome things.

We originally were supposed to have 6 people in our party. My boyfriend and I showed up first and thought we would get a table. The hostess said she couldn&#39;t seat us until our entire party showed up. I could understand that, as we walked in right in front of three parties. Eventually the hostess sat us at a 4 top and said we could move to the 6 top next to us when the current people had left. Turns out one of the couples had to cancel so it was just four of us, so we stayed at our original table.

We ordered the tableside guacamole, which was fantastic! The gentleman who was making it was very friendly and asked us exactly how we wanted it; spicy or not spicy, lots of onions or light onions etc. The chips and two salsas were also great! I am a fan of a smoother salsa vs. chunky salsa so I really liked both of these. 

We had heard that we must order the flaming margarita, which is a normal medium sized margarita with added alcohol that they light on fire and pour into your glass. I am not entirely sure exactly what was in the flaming part, I would assume maybe Bacardi 151 or the like. I had heard from multiple people that you will not be able to drive home after one of these margs. I was a bit disappointed that I didn&#39;t feel much after drinking the entire thing. After receiving our bill and see the hefty $14 price tag, I was even more disappointed. For $14, I should be a bit more drunk. 

Now onto the food. I ordered the beef tacos, with no tomato. I was expecting the tacos to come with the beef, cheese and lettuce, as described on the menu. I received my meal with carrots, onions and what looked like celery on the tacos. I hate onions so I had the task of picking those out. I also thought it was just weird that they were not as described on the menu. Overall they were very tasty, along with the refried beans and rice. 

Overall the food is very good. Disappointed in the margarita but I will definitely come back to have another try, as sometimes restaurants have off nights."

It was after 1:30, so post lunch rush and pre dinner rush. I was on the phone when I walked in and sat myself as the place was empty. They brought water and chips as I continued my call. Ten minutes later I was done and the waiter promptly came over to take my order. The lunch menu is quite simple: I ordered two steak tacos with rice and beans. Also ordered the middle Margarita- 26oz. It is $9 but on Thursdays they are $5! 

I conducted two conference calls in the nearly empty restaurant.  The staff is attentvie but courteous.  Juan was my server and he did a nice job, and was pleasant to speak to. I understand how things might get busy on a weekend as they have 100 seats and the arrangement is tight in the front dinig section. 

A nice lunch experience."

The times I had been there the only thing that impressed me were the margaritas. My bf and I decided to give them another try since I live down the street and see that this place is always busy and I read good the Yelp reviews. 
We went on a friday night and it was very busy. Hostess said 25 min wait. We decided to go to the bar and ordered margaritas. I had a regular frozen margarita and I must say that I liked it better on the rocks. We waited for maybe 15 min and then were seated. Water and chips and 2 different kinds of salsa were brought over right away. The salsas were ok, one was spicy and the other medium. 
We waited about 10 min for our waiter to come take our order. We were ok with that because it gave us time to look through the menu. 
I ordered the Bistec Cazuela which was chopped steak with onions, tomatoes and green peppers. My bf had the combination fajitas. We were both very pleased with our food. My dish was perfect, the steak was tender and very flavorful. The rice was good too. 
We didn&#39;t get the table side guacamole but it looked good and the guy was super friendly and entertaining. 
I am so glad that I gave them another try. I will for sure go back. I&#39;m already craving the bistec. 
I would have given 5 stars but the server was not very attentive. We sat without anyone checking on us for a while."

The table side guacamole isn&#39;t a new concept but Ritos does it well. I haven&#39;t personally seen a slip in service quality between when it is busy and not, but would hope that others who do just try to be patient as when the food does arrive it will be worth it. Be sure to try the flaming margarita, the steak fajita and the fish tacos. These three items are great standby items.

It&#39;s a tiny little place at the end of a strip mall, so you might pass right by it, not knowing the awesomeness that is tucked inside. But it is definitely worth the visit!

Our group of 5 stopped in on Sunday afternoon for lunch. All the lights were off. The restaurant was open but they didn&#39;t have any lights turned on. That just didn&#39;t say welcome to our restaurant. I felt like I was bothering the staff by being there.

Our server was just meh. I&#39;ve gone here and the service has been excellent. But apparently go on an off time and it&#39;s bad. I wanted to order a beer-margarita. The table next to me had one and I&#39;m even pointing to that table (&#34;I want that one!&#34;). He kept pushing me to the flaming margarita special. I understand there&#39;s a communication gap but c&#39;mon. Finally I gave up and ordered a frozen margarita.

I really liked this place but the service was awful. I guess if you don&#39;t go during the rush of Thurs-Sat, expect crappy service."

        We were the only ones in the restaurant because we arrived when they were going to be closing soon. Our server greeted us, and pretty much never came back. I understand if they are busy that their service slows down, but we were the only ones in the restaurant and it was completely unacceptable for how long it took. Also, when he finally did come back, it took him an ENTERNITY to take our order.

       When we finally got our food, the food was good. I enjoyed my food and that was pretty much the only part of the experience that mirrored my first experience at Rito&#39;s. I not positive I would be coming back. After that bad service, I&#39;m really not wanting to come back."

I recommend the Tacos Al Pastor!  For drinks, I usually just have a Modelo, though I&#39;m told the margaritas are outstanding. 

One small warning: it CAN get really packed in there from time to time (I guess that&#39;s what happens when you serve good food!)  Also, the restaurant is located in a strip mall, so parking kinda sucks sometimes...  It&#39;s worth it!!!!

The one hit on this place is that it&#39;s typically REALLY busy and as a result, can be slow--usually a wait for a table and then the service is slow.

Everything was nice. I don&#39;t know why the rating is only 3.5 on yelp. I&#39;m glad I finally checked Ritos out. I will be back soon.

From the food, to the drinks, to the atmosphere, to the amazing Señior Rito himself (who is one of the most friendly and genuine restaurant owners I&#39;ve ever met), if you live within a decent vicinity of Rt 59 &amp; Montgomery Rd, this place is a must!

Prices are fair, food is fresh, the $5 mega margaritas on Thursdays are tasty and strong (get there early, Thursdays = long waits &amp; standing room only). Absolutely start out with the freshly made guac when the cart is wheeled over to your table. And make sure to visit for birthday celebrations. Rito is known (99% of the time) to trot out with a staff-parade who are shaking maracas, singing and clapping, while Rito slaps a hilariously gigantic sombrero onto your head, tilts you back, and pours a tequila shot into your mouth while restaurant on-lookers cheer and smile. 

The only &#34;negative&#34; (which isn&#39;t even that, it just needs to be made a forewarning to the impatient diners)... Rito&#39;s is a laid back place! Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s lunch or dinner, weekend or not. If you&#39;re in a rush, don&#39;t even bother. Rito&#39;s is about taking a breather, relaxing, enjoying good company, good food, good drinks, and good times, etc. We are regulars and recommend Rito&#39;s to everyone."

I&#39;ve been here on nights other than Thursday and it&#39;s like a totally different world!  Ghost town. I always get one of the steak meals when I come here.  They are very good.  I think I get the carne asada gratinada or something like that.  The guacamole is amazing too...  And I always get that margarita on fire!  Boom!

The Chile Relleno was AMAZING.  I enjoyed the enchiladas quite a bit as well.  I think I inhaled a basked of chips with their salsa too.  They had margaritas on special-  wow-  it was so tasty and really strong.  
They were also really accommodating to my friend&#39;s 2 year old- gave her things to color, had a kids menu, and even made a fake kids margarita (pink lemonade with limes on the rim of the kids styrofoam cup.)

Got seated right away and our drink order was taken right away.  Good start I thought. Well that&#39;s where it ended! I ordered a mixed drink and I&#39;m not to sure what I got but it definitely was not a Jack and Coke. Got the chips and salsa, they were ok at best. No flavor at all. After a long wait we were finally able to put in our food. I ordered three beef tacos with lettuce and cheese only. My friend got chicken quesadillas. Nothing hard to put together at all. It took 50 minutes to get out food. When the food finally came it was wrong. My tacos had everything you could imagine in them. Not cheese and lettuce only! Meat had no flavor,  and the beef in my taco tasted exactly like the chicken in the quesadillas.  Not sure how they pulled that off! I also ordered a water to go with my meal ( plus I could not even drink my mixed drink) they bring me a sprite. Can&#39;t even get water right at this place! Over all very bad experience,  I&#39;m sorry I had to pay $40 for all the wrong stuff."

They also have specials on Thursday for $5 Margaritas the are so delicious!  If there is a down side to this restaurant it would be that they are so good that you might not get a seat if you go past 6:00pm on a Thursday.  Also if your in a hurry don&#39;t go here on a Thursday the waiters are so busy serving that paying your bill might take a little longer.   Definitely going to keep returning to this yummy restaurant.  Oh by the way the staff is so polite and the owner Rito is super friendly and always comes out to greet his returning customers he is a great business man!

No Service, No Taste, No Value.

Seated at a table against the wall.  The bench seats on the wall are 6&#34; too high so that peoples thighs were against the bottom of the table.  We should have left right then and there.

10+ minutes to place a drink order, 15+ more to get an entree in, 7+ more to have table-side guacamole (not bad, but tiny).  15+ more to to get the order.  4 top set with 3 plates and glasses.  Waiters had to be flagged down for water, salsa, everything.

The guacamole consisted of 1, yes, 1 medium avocado for a table of 4 people to the tune of $6.95.  You&#39;re kidding right?

I had the sample plate and couldn&#39;t believe how bad EVERYTHING was.  They tore the taco making it, so just added another tortilla around the outside instead of starting over.  The mini chimichanga was literally 2 inches long and I had to search for any filling.  The Tamale was also nothing but corn masa.  The enchilada was barely filled with dry, tasteless chicken.  The Chile Relleno was the absolute worst I have ever had.  No taste, bad cheese, soggy breading.  The rice was dry and tasteless while the refried beans were not even as good as the junk in the cans.

Another at our table had the mole chicken, and while the chicken was moist, the mole was way too sweet and straight out of a jar.

Finally, the $9.00 medium margaritas were short on cheap tequila and long on Kool-aid margarita mix.  If you like these, you have never had a real margarita.

They cleaned up our 1/4-1/2 eaten plates and never even asked if we wanted to take it home... they obviously knew better.

Again, nasty nasty nasty.  Without a doubt, the worst Mexican food I have ever had in 50 years on the planet. 

You&#39;ve been warned."

For a corner of a strip mall location, they really are trying to be unique.  Lively atmosphere in a good-sized location.

We just had chips, salsa and appetizers, but they were good.  Having someone go around to offer table side guacamole is a great idea.  Much easier to sell that with a cart of fresh ingredients at the edge of the table than trying to describe it on the menu.

The drinks were good as well.  Some at the table got the flaming margarita and that was a nice, festive touch.  Drink prices were very reasonable and didn&#39;t necessarily appear to be on special ($3 for a bottle of all of the main Mexican beers).

A good place for this sort of gathering-the entrees looked just o.k. but I&#39;ll give it another try one of these days."

The puerco guisada was spectacular and the yummy green salsa it was roasted in was made fresh not from any can. The rest of my table had a wide variety of dishes including mole and fajitas. All were really good and at a fair price. It was my first trip and I met the owner, Rito,  who was not only making sure everyone was happy, but was quick to help his attentive staff. The margaritas were also made fresh and perfectly too. I have not had a margarita this good since my recent trip to Mexico City. 
 We need to support restaurants like this because they are part of our community, they deserve the same dinner dollars I would spend in the city,  and they have earned my return. Great place!!!"

As usual, beans were tasty. and sometimes at Mexican joints, the chips are not fresh? Well, they have always been very fresh here. and the marg&#39;s are also whipped up fresh upon your order.

I just moved back from Texas and I can say this is better Mexican food than 98% of the &#34;Mexican&#34; places in Texas,  due to the fact Texas really only knows texmex,  which is completely different and subpar.   I was pleasantly surprised they served horchata, which was delicious,  and I later asked if they made micheladas and the waiter said yes (I have to go back and order one to try). I had ordered the skirt steak which came out juicy and tender. The salsas were fresh and great.  I&#39;ll definitely be going back to try other things on the menu.

What was once my favorite Mexican spot in the area has gone completely down hill. The service here has been awful on my last few visits. One time I understand but it has been 3 times and the service has been awful. Tried to take my boyfriend to eat here last weekend and we stood by the desk for over 10min and were not helped. Moved by the door since a few other people were waiting (and figured they weren&#39;t taking names) and two other people came in and there names were taken ahead of us. Really we were there 10minutes earlier how did you miss us. The food here has also gone down hill. It has come down to a place to go for Guacamole (still the best in the area when the guac boy is working) and the &#34;Rito&#39;s special Margareta&#34;. Don&#39;t think I will be going back for a while after my last few visits. Time to get your act together guys!!! This service is unacceptable.

Wait to get seated, once you are seated wait some more to get your drink orders in, drink orders take forever, wait a little bit more to order your food. God forbid you need a waiter to bring you another round of drinks or even just a glass of water or some extra napkins. Want your bill, be prepared to wait and wait and wait for that too.

Rito&#39;s is really good Mexican food.  I won&#39;t say great, because I&#39;ve gotten a couple of dishes that didn&#39;t wow, but by and large, I appreciate the restaurant as a whole.

One of the best parts is the tableside guacamole service.  As soon as you sit down, a young guy shows up and asks if you&#39;d like guacamole.  Say yes.  He makes a mean guacamole customized to your tastes (mild or hot, onion, no onion) and is very friendly and talkative.  FYI, he&#39;s a college kid studying accounting.  Tip him and support education.

The other best part is the two brothers who run the place.  These guys know how to create customer loyalty.  Everytime we visit, they both stop by, shake our hands, tell my wife she looks lovely (making my day better) and make sure the food is good.  If I ever owned a restaurant, I&#39;d want guys like this managing the floor.  

The margaritas are pretty good.  Not the best i&#39;ve had, but they come in big glasses, aren&#39;t obscenely expensive and get the job done.  However, I advise caution on getting the golden margarita which is the usual margarita with a flaming shot of Cointreau.  This drink is friggin&#39; delicious.  And considering it has that extra kick of alcohol, it&#39;s also deadly serious.  I only discovered this one night when, not paying full attention, I drank two and ended up taking a cab home and falling asleep (see: &#34;pass out&#34;)  on the bedroom floor.  There are other details that are hazy and better left undiscussed.

Try the hangar steak.  Love it.  They used to have Norteno Tacos with a bacon-chile sauce that was fantastic, but it&#39;s been off the menu for awhile.  Hoping they bring it back.  My wife orders the veggie burrito and loves it everytime.  The beans and rice are eh, but then again, these dishes aren&#39;t exactly expensive, either.

Ritos is in a strip mall on 83 just west of 59.  I wouldn&#39;t have stopped here if I hadn&#39;t been recommended on a few occasions.  The inside is nothing special and the bar really needs to be rehabbed.  If they had a remodeled bar that was more friendly to socializing, they&#39;d be kicking serious tail.  If you&#39;re going there with 2-4 people, you probably don&#39;t need a reservation on most occasions, but if it&#39;s a larger group, it wouldn&#39;t hurt."

They were muy bueno.  For an appetizer I had the queso fundido.  A great choice along with some tortillas.  All in all, good cuisine.

The restaurant itself leaves something to be desired.  The seating is poor.  There are benches along the walls that are hard and the &#39;back rest&#39; is the wall.  Additionally, it&#39;s a family restaurant but there&#39;s arcade games there which are a bit distracting during your dinner conversation.  Another complaint is the lack of quality margaritas.  The basic margaritas are passable, but no top shelf selections 

Only three stars.  I would return to give them another shot because the food is so good.  Because of the atmosphere, I might try a few other restaurants before returning."

I have NEVER been treated so badly.  Federico the bartender  waiter was not even apologetic when we found a quarter size chunk of plastic in our food.  The manager acted like we put it there ourselves and was extremely rude.  A nice restaurant would have comped the appetizer or bought us a drink as mistakes do happen. Not Ritos.   The food is not that great and is overpriced   they just rearranged the nachos and put them back in the oven for a minute and then said they &#34;would never do that&#34; when clearly that is exactly what they did.     ugly, cheap atmosphere.

Since we only had 40 minutes between the activities, I decided to get the dinner for us here. 

We got the dinner comb with Fish and veggitables. This place is a typical take out place so I didn&#39;t expect the fantastic food. However, the fish fillet was too small to be found. Usually this means both the quantity nor the quality were not good. Since the fish was frozen for a long time so it broke to small pieces when they cooked it. The broccoli tasted OK but not the baby corn nor the carrots. The side is the chicken fried rices where was totally dark due to the excessively used soy sauce. Didn&#39;t think Chicken was fresh enought neither. 

Maybe just one time glitch for this place where other visitors had a better experience. I will just leave this one alone."

It is a small place so we normally do take out. I wouldn&#39;t worry about calling in your food ahead of time either. They are so fast when it comes to making the food that your wait is normally only five to ten minutes at most after placing your order. It&#39;s definitely one of the better chinese places I&#39;ve eaten at in the area. 

They have a large menu with a great variety and I was extremely surprised at just how cheap they are considering the large portions they give you. We always order the dinner combo: for $9 you choose an entree and you also get a huge side of chicken fried rice, one crab rangoon, one egg roll, either egg drop or hot and sour soup, and a soda. It&#39;s soo much food that you could definitely share one dinner combo between two people without a doubt.

I&#39;m not going to lie to you...the soup is awful. Way too thick, almost like syrup. But the beef entrees are awesome (especially the hundred flavor beef, soo spicy and delicious) and the egg rolls and crab rangoon are perfect. Plus, the fried rice is the real deal.

The people who work there are friendly, although seem to strictly abide by &#34;Chinese takeout time measurement&#34; where no matter what you order it&#39;ll always be &#34;fifteen minutes&#34; even though it might be ready in as little as five. When I go here, I don&#39;t eve bother calling as I&#39;d rather stand around for five or ten minutes and have my food hot and ready than planning on being there after the pre-designated fifteen minutes only to have had my food getting cold for the last ten.

Here&#39;s some tips:

-There&#39;s a unadvertised dollar menu that you&#39;ll see when you go to pick up your food. On this menu there&#39;s things like single egg rolls, plain fried rice, and other single-serve basics. All of this stuff is prepared almost instantly too, so if you want something quick and don&#39;t care about getting fancy, you can buy yourself a feast for like $4.

-Insist you want them to go &#34;easy on the sauce.&#34; China Kitchen is yet another Chinese place that&#39;ll go absolutely insane with saucing your food, leaving your chop suey swimming.

-Avoid the chicken, I&#39;m not sure why, but it always seems to be weirdly rubbery and full of gnarly bits that you can&#39;t really identify.

-The potstickers, eggrolls, and crab rangoon are all great.

-If you order a small fried rice, ask for it in a large container. Instead of a container that&#39;s bursting out the top barely held together with a staple, you get a much more sane packaging option."

We decided to give it another try. The egg rolls were overdone and almost burnt with little taste. I have never gotten chop suey without one mushroom in it until now.

When we ordered for the first time, we didn&#39;t know what to expect, except the menu was cheap. It&#39;s a very plain storefront in a strip mall, really basic. 

The portions are HUGE - the &#34;small&#34; is a standard size....I&#39;m sure the &#34;regular/large&#34; could feed a small army.

We had an order of tofu &amp; veggies, general tso chicken, egg drop soup, wonton soup, 2 egg rolls, all for $20!! And since we spent $20, we got a free order of Chicken Fried Rice. (If you spend $10, you get a free egg roll!)

I highly recommend this for cheap chinese in Naperville!"

I got a coupon printed on the back of a grocery store receipt that said &#34;buy one entree - get one free&#34; for China Kitchen at this exact address, this exact phone number, with NO expiration date. I decided to use it recently. I ordered 3 dinner entrees, soup, 2 appetizers - around $45. When I gave the cashier my credit card and coupon, she refused to honor the coupon! She said they don&#39;t take coupons, it wasn&#39;t valid, it wasn&#39;t theirs, etc. etc... Really? They printed these coupons and now won&#39;t take them? Is this their idea of bait-and-switch? When I asked for the manager, the cashier offered me 10% off the total instead. The price of a free entree should be $10 off! - but I didn&#39;t want to argue and my kids were waiting, so I took the 10% and left.Won&#39;t be coming back for this kind of treatment.

The only caveat is the location is kind of hidden in the strip mall where the DMV is. But rest assured, if you find this gem, you won&#39;t be disappointed. There are other pho places around here as I&#39;ve written in my prior reviews, however this one thus far has won by a landslide and here are my reasons why. 

Service, with food sometimes taking over, service sometimes (and oftentimes) dwindles among certain cultural communities. This location doesn&#39;t sacrifice this. The staff has always been very tentative and always speak to you, not at you. I&#39;ve been here about three or four times and this has never been an issue. I&#39;ve always felt very welcome to come back. 

The food here is above par, I would say it&#39;s not far off from Viet town in the city. All dishes are appropriately portioned and they have a wide variety of authentic Vietnamese dishes, including smoothies and coffees for you to quench your thirst. Their sandwiches are always fresh from the bread down to the spices they use. If you want to talk about flavor.. it really doesn&#39;t get any better!

Pricing is beyond fair and you get quite a good amount of food for the price you pay- which doesn&#39;t hurt your You wallet so bringing a small group of your friends here should be no worries. 

The establishment here is always clean. Well kept, constantly swept and unlike many other places I&#39;ve been to that are authentic- there are no bugs constantly flying around. 

Take a trek out here. It&#39;s well worth it. You&#39;ll be glad you did!"

Reasons its a great place to check out: 

1. Their Pho is phenomenal. Great tasting broth that doesnt over kill the quality and taste of the meats. 
2. They give you plenty of options fish sauce on the table, crushed red pepper puree, red pepper oil if you ask for it, anything you can ask for really.
3. Their service is personally really comforting compared to another pho place on rt 59 which i wont mention these guys are Superior. Always welcoming, cater to what you need, checking up only when they see that we&#39;re ready. You know when you start looking around and they&#39;ll pick up on it. 
4. The rice dishes are just as awesome as the pho. I have some pics but that doesnt do it justice. 
5. Ambience. Music is key to my heart and Pho Thien always has a good selection. Plus tv&#39;s if youre feeling antisocial.

Thats my 5. Good luck! Hope you enjoy as much as i did. I typically go a couple times a month."

The broth is the most important part and we did not have to add any sauce because the flavor is spot on.  

In addition, I also really appreciate the effort on making the chicken pho delicious as well because usually at pho places the beef broth takes the priority.  I was pleasantly surprised by my rich flavored chicken pho with perfect tender chicken breast pieces!  

We also ordered spring rolls (which the flavor and texture can be improved) and an out of this world mango pineapple smoothie.  We will definitely return!"

The customer service at most Asian places are poor, with the exception of this place. My friend and I was seated right away and our waiters were extremely nice. Free soda with a check-in on Yelp with a purchase.

The spring rolls at this place are equivalent to Green Basil. I was planning on getting Pho, however, they had a weekend special on Bun Bo Hue so both my friend and I ended up getting it. When the Bun Bo Hue came out, the broth was so clear and the first thing came to my mind was &#34;OMG, this gonna tastes like water&#34;. But I was mistaken, the broth was actually favorable (actually tasted better than Green Basil) As for the drink,  I got an avocado smoothie and it was refreshing since they actually used real fruits.

I&#39;ve had the pho and it&#39;s okay - broth is a little weak in my opinion, but there&#39;s plenty of stuff in the bowl, so I&#39;m definitely stuffed when I leave. The last time I went, they also served regular basil instead of Thai basil, which was kind of disappointing. My son once got the Bun Cha Gio Thi Nuong (grilled pork and egg roll on rice noodles) and it was ridiculously awesome. 

But the best part about Pho Thien? The soundtrack. The jamz were so strong, I couldn&#39;t help but bust out the ORIGINAL running man in my chair (not this fake, running man reboot dance I see on the YouTubes). They were playing TLC, the Fresh Prince before he was in movies, LL Cool J, basically every incredible early 90&#39;s jam that I loved and listened to in my formative teen years.

The pho is really good. 
They have Bánh mì!  Also really good, and they put a fried egg on it if you want.  Multiple meats available.
The pork chop is really good,
The people are really friendly.

It is slightly hidden behind Play It Again Sports (we missed it the first time). There is a lot of seating, nice atmosphere, and family friendly. Their pho was not as salty as I would like, but the fish sauce was already on the table to fix that right up. They even brought out some food scissors so I could cut up my daughter&#39;s noodles and a kid-friendly cup of water without even asking. My husband also got a Thai iced tea which was delicious and came in a cute mason jar. But I did think $4 was a tad bit overpriced for it. Overall, we had a good experience. We will definitely be returning."

The pho broth is made by simmering various beef parts with aromatics in water (for 10+ hours), served with the cuts of beef (brisket, flank steak, tendons, etc) used for making the broth along with some vegetables( raw onions, bean sprouts, mint,and basil), served with with condiments ( cilantro, limes, jalapenos, sriracha, hoisin, etc)   to accompany the broth. I love and appreciate a good bowl of pho. A good broth is hard to find. I was very excited to try this place. While I can appreciate a small family own business, it is an appropriate fix if you are in need of some pho, in the burbs. I ordered the Pho Dac Biet priced at $10.50 a bowl. The bowl itself is quite large, you get lots of soup, a ball of noodles about the size of a softball, and 3-4 bites of the different cuts of meat(steak, flank, brisket, tendon, and beef meat ball). What I really enjoy about pho is the broth. The taste of hearty beef flavor with the complexity of cinnamon, cloves, fennel, and star anise mingled into each slurp. Which I felt that the broth here was a little watered down. I think I read in another review here that if you come during lunch, the broth is great, but gets a little bland towards dinner... I will have to make it a point to visit here during lunch and order some appetizers and rice dishes."

Nem nuong cuon- this is similar to Brodard in Garden Grove, CA. Has more lettuce than Brodard&#39;s and less nem (Vietnamese sausage) but solid. No orange dipping sauce like Brodard&#39;s but still really good. If you love spring rolls give this wrap a try!

Goi cuon- Viet shrimp spring roll. ubiquitous at Vietnamese restaurants. Good.

Bo Kho- reminds me of my childhood. It&#39;s a beef stew but thinner in sauce. Love it with the French baguette. Homemade bread 

Banh Beo - solid. It&#39;s close to the quality you&#39;d get in Houston or Cali. It trades the chewiness for tenderness but this is a matter of preference. I prefer chewiness and others prefer tenderness which is what you&#39;ll get here. These are little steamed tapioca flour cakes with shrimp, chicharron, and green onions in top. Put a generous amount of fish sauce on it and eat. 

Flan- get it without the ice and ask for some viet coffee on it. The ice to me dilutes the flan flavor. Vietnamese flan by the way is much softer than Mexican flan. Viet flan is similar to creme brûlée without the burn sugar on top. 


Pho- this is the reason you&#39;re probably going here. The broth to me is lacking spice. I&#39;m a Viet northerner so the style of pho I&#39;m used to is less sweet in broth, thicker, and heavier on spices. That said I thought it was a good southern style pho. The bowls are huge as usual and they don&#39;t skimp on the ingredients. Fresh noodles not the dry noodles which makes a big difference. 

Given the style of pho here I think I will try their chicken pho Bc style wise Northern Vietnamese make this sorta similar to Southerners. Chicken pho is light and  clear like chicken  consommé. 

I&#39;d definitely come back and plan to tomorrow! Can&#39;t believe they have a place that makes Nem Nuong cuon here !"

They offer it on the menu in variations. The menu lists each dish in Vietnamese while showing the main ingredients  in English. If you like beef noodle soup, you will love the complex and satisfying flavor of the Pho. It is served with a selection of tasty add ons. You can spice it up with a varity of condiments.

(I will not advertise the restaurant I work at as it would be very unfair and unprofessional to do so on another business&#39; Yelp page).

My friend and I order an appetizer and a couple entrees to share. We orders the House special wings, pho tai gan (sliced beef and tendon) with added meatballs and bun Thit Nuong cha gio (rice vermicelli with grilled pork and egg rolls).

The server brought out our two entrees first and immediately came back with the appetizer. I was confused cuz I would assumed we would be eating our appetizer first but I got over it. The wings were really tasty. It&#39;s a dry rub spicy wing as opposed to a saucy wing. I prefer the dry rub so I loved it. My friend likes saucy wings so she said it was ok. 

The pho was also ok in our opinion. The broth didn&#39;t have much flavor to it. The slice beef was tender and so was the tendon. The meatballs were... let&#39;s just say I&#39;ve had better, homemade meatballs, rather than store bought, processed meatballs. 

The bun dish was also ok. The noodles was served cold, not my preference but the grilled pork was tender and flavorful.

The staff was all very friendly from the moment we walked to the time we left out the door.y"

Having a Vietnamese wife with amazing culinary skills, I am no stranger to the flavors of traditional Viet cuisine. She has insisted we try many of the Vietnamese restaurants in both Chicago and the surrounding suburbs, despite the fact that we almost always leave dissatisfied. Unfortunately, Pho Thien was no exception. As a someone with a major preference toward eating pescetarian, I was very disappointed to see that the menu offers no vegetarian or strictly pescetarian entrees. It is 2016 now and vegetarians or pescetarians are no longer anywhere near the extreme end of the restrictive diet spectrum. I know plenty of vegetarian Buddhist Vietnamese as well so traditional ingredients is not an excuse either. I really didn&#39;t want to order anything, but given that it was well past dinner time, and I hadn&#39;t eaten for most of the day, I reluctantly did so. I opted for the Bun Dac Biet, asking that the grilled pork and pork containing egg roll be omitted, and the Banh Beo Tom Chay as an appetizer. I thought the appetizer was tasty, my wife on the other hand did not, citing the lack of fried onion and substitution of sauteed shrimp for what should have been dried shrimp. This Bun Dac Biet dish was neither amazing nor terrible (not that it could be given its very basic ingredients). However, my wife was very disappointed to see that the wide variety of mints and leaves traditionally included in this dish had been severely scaled back to only cilantro. She ordered a bowl of beef Pho for herself, and a bowl of chicken Pho for our sons. They aren&#39;t old enough to to know how bland the soup was, but my wife certainly did and she forced me to try a spoonful of the beef broth. There was merely a slight aftertaste of the cinnamon, cloves, fennel, and star anise that define the distinctive Pho flavor. Coincidentally I asked my wife what Thien meant, she informed me that it indicated this place was claiming to be Pho Heaven. If this is the case, an eternity in Pho hell should be something they threaten all badly behaved Vietnamese children with. The only thing that saved this experience from being one star was the service. Both our waitress and the manger were very attentive and pleasant."

Some of us were craving pho so we decided to look for a Vietnamese restaurant nearby and stumbled up this newly opened one. Upon entering, we were immediately greeted with friendly smiles by their staff who wore traditional Vietnamese dresses (which we found really cool!) While my friends ordered Pho, I ordered #3 and #32. The pork spring rolls and the sauce, I might boldly add, are better than the ones from Brodard&#39;s in Los Angeles. The vermicelli noodles and grilled pork were full of flavor and had me debating whether I should take another round to-go.

I received one and really liked the variety and quality of the samples. Later that week, my mom went to the opening day celebration to try the food as well. 

My mom and I went into the restaurant again for a late lunch yesterday. When we first entered into the restaurant we were immediately greeted by the waitresses and quickly seated and served. I was also impressed by the cleanliness of the restaurant. We ordered a Pho Dac Biet, Bun Dac Biet and Com Tam Dac Biet (a special pho dish, rice dish and vermicelli dish). The Bun Dac Biet and Com Tam Dac Biet were to-go. Though service and the quality of the food was good, my mom and I were disappointed by the quantity of the food. My mom had also tried the pho, pork rice dish and a banh mi on opening day; however, she told me that the quantity and variety of items during the opening day were greater than when we tried it yesterday. The pho we had yesterday was mainly soup and noodles but there was only a few thinly slices of meat and only two halves of a meatball, one small tendon and a tiny sliver of tripe. Though there were a lot of listed meats on the menu, we did not seem to get that bountiful display. 

Additionally, after taking our to-go orders home, the first thing my mom commented on was the fact that the pork rice dish was missing some items that she had seen during opening day (such as grilled shrimp). And once again the quantity of food was low. On the vermicelli dish, we only had two grilled shrimp and a few small cuts of meat and some pickled vegetables as well as some cucumbers. The rice dish had one slab of meat, a salad, pork skin, a sugar cane shrimp and an egg. Though the flavor was very good, the amount of food that we were getting for the price just did not seem to add up. Back in Oregon, we used to go to a few different Vietnamese restaurants and the costs there were lower there and the amount of food we got was also more. However, since they are a very new restaurant, the consistency and quantity of food might just be something they need to work on for next time! 

Pros:

-Good and fast service
-Clean restaurant 
-Good tasting food 

Cons:

-Overpriced for amount and variety of food you get
-Consistency of food day to day"

Several times I&#39;ve ordered it and it didn&#39;t come out piping hot it was just warm.  I think the rice dishes are better.  May be on my next trip back I lol be surprised and adjust my review.

The pho is too salty and too much msg. The bi smell. The special rice plate have too much food and not enough rice. On the other hand, the grilled meat rice plate have too much rice and not enough meat. I think Joy Yee have better food. Also, there is no napkins on the table or sweet and Lo packs for tea.

Standard market does a generally lovely job of making a grocery store a place you&#39;d want to hang out. The Cube is a great concept- it&#39;s isolated enough from the regular grocery section (I&#39;m looking at you, Mariano&#39;s), has dedicated staff, and a simply impressive wine and cheese selection. 

I&#39;ve had a good experience during the day with the cheese mongers. They are experienced and knowledgable.

By night, however, the servers get crabby and scarce. It is hard to get a server to come to your table, and on two occasions, it&#39;s been nearly impossible to get your free cheese board on ladies night. Due to slow service, not large volume of business. There can be some great deals, it&#39;s a nice atmosphere, but just don&#39;t have high expectations for customer service!"

Who would have thought. It&#39;s an excellent date spot! We missed the memo on being able to buy liquor, and drink it at your table. Therefore we paid way to much for 3 glasses of wine. The grocery store is very expensive as well, but it looks like they have some high quality produce.
This was made evident by the amazing Sopressata. the Prosciutto was also good, however these 2 meets, +3 cheeses, equate to a $24 board... We shared the 16oz Ribeye which was to die for, and also around the $25 price point. The waitress made a point to said they prefer to cook it medium rare, though it appeared to be very medium, and we both would have preferred it more rare. The Brussel sprouts came out way overcooked, literally blackened. We should have taken a picture because it was almost a joke how crispy and oily they were. 
Don&#39;t get me wrong, we&#39;ll be back, abusing the beer wine purchase program, and savoring another Ribeye ;-)"

Last time we were in we bought a bottle of red wine at the retail price and we were able to drink it while sitting at the bar; they&#39;ll also package it up for you to take home if you don&#39;t finish it.

HOWEVER, because I tend to find what I like on a menu and stick with it, I keep going back for the wine and the rainbow sushi roll!  It.  Is.  Amazing.

The Cube is a GREAT place to go to watch sports without a sports bar feel and it has great wines and, aside from the macaroni and cheese, which is just my opinion, has a very nice menu.  The service is good and the atmosphere is trendy and classy casual.  I feel that if Frasier and Niles ever had a bar they frequented, The Cube would be it!"

Misleading advertising on their wines. They placed a $40 dollar bottle of wine under a $15 dollar of wine rack and once we drank it, they would not acknowledge their mistake.

In other words, after we received the bill, we told tell them about their mistake in placing the $40 wine bottle under the $15 wine bottle rack and they brushed us off (actually, they quickly went to the wine rack to fix their mistake; they placed the bottles in the correct place). We had to pay the $40.00 since we did not make a fuss.

We wrote an email after the fact to explain--since we thought it was not our waiter&#39;s fault in the first place--and they never wrote us back. We would at least like to hear &#34;I am sorry for your experience.&#34; 

Standard Market used to be a classier place, or at least they should own up to their mistakes.  After all, we are sure they are making a good profit.

We decided to try this place for a late lunch and went with a charcuterie selection and the mussels. They have prices for single serving, 3 selections, 5, and I think one more. We went with five because we were hungry and so often restaurants will kind of skimp on the portion size of a charcuterie board. Not here. Holy crap was that a lot of cheese. Not only were the meats and cheeses all delicious, you literally get a nearly full wedge of cheese plopped on the board for each choice. So, I&#39;d say for the prices (I think $15 or so for 3, and $24 for 5 selections) it&#39;s an amazing value. Meat portions were not as generous but I haven&#39;t found any other place in the area that serves Olympia Provisions meats. 

The mussels were also delicious. My wife&#39;s a bit of a mussel fanatatic and said this is probably in the top 3 mussel dishes she&#39;s had.

Service was very attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly without being too overbearing. 

We ordered drinks off the menu, but you can also purchase a bottle of wine or beer from the grocery right there at retail price and drink it in the bar. 

Definitely will be coming back here."

The sea bass sushi was really good, as well as the  sashimi.  Cold and delicious.  I like the fact that if you do not like what they have on tap you can grab a single bottle and drink it at cost. Aaron the chef is very distasteful in the fact that I ordered quite a bit of food by myself, but he let the &#39;men&#39; around me sample some of his dishes, while ignoring me that probably spent more then the others that were around me, making me feel alienated.  The mussels must have been over cooked because the mussel was so tiny inside.  All in all, a good experience."

There was a hot dog place right next to the drive in, but it&#39;s reviews were pretty sad so we looked for something close by that wasn&#39;t the normal Portillos (nothing against Portillos).

Happy Dog was AWESOME. I got the happy dog and fries and my husband got a chili dog. Note: Chili dog is very messy but he said it was one of the best he had ever had. My happy dog (ok fine, happy dogs, OK? I ordered two) were so good. The Happy Dog, BTW is just a Chicago style dog. The fries were not too thick, not shoestring and very crispy - perfect! The prices were very reasonable, the staff was nice and friendly. It is pretty much literally a hot dog stand: there&#39;s a slim counter to sit at indoors. Otherwise, you are dining out on the picnic tables which means their winter business must be minimal and completely limited to take out.

And...real fresh-cut French fries... excellent ones at that. The other traditional items such as Hot Tamales are also available.

The fries are what gives this place its solid 4 rating. I would normally never recommend this, but chili cheese fries aren&#39;t the way to go here. These fries are best on their own, with cheese on the side if you must. 

The hot dogs are of above average when comparing to local suburban dogs. For me, relish, mustard and onions with the celery salt is good enough. The tomatoes made it a bit soggy. 

Everything else is just about as good as it was at Happy House except for the lack of corn dogs and what Happy House called a &#34;fire dog.&#34;

Edit: they do have corn dogs."

No cheese pizza puffs, only sausage ones which I loathe. 

I do like the fresh cut fries as opposed to the last establishment, but the prices here are higher than Portillo&#39;s. A Chili cheese dog with no fries was $3.99, and it was just okay.

We tried it for the first time last night.  My husband stopped on the way home from work and ordered 2 hot dogs, 1 beef sandwich and 2 fries. Not a very complex order.  He said there was one person ahead of him and one behind...so not jammed with customers.  Out of 5 items, only four made it home...for whatever reason the beef sandwich never made it into the bag.  So...he had to go back out again...this is not happy making in our house !  By the time he got home the beef was barely  warm and the bun so soggy that when I unwrapped the sandwich it just fell apart...I ate the beef with a fork.

To be honest, I don&#39;t think the food is better than Happy House, but I think it&#39;s at least as good.  The beef was flavorful and the fries were tasty...

I can&#39;t see us going back any time real soon, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll give it another try....maybe just not on a frigid night in rush hour traffic on Rt 38."

This place however has to step it up.  I have ordered 5-6 times this year and it is a struggle to get the pizza ordered!  How hard is it to take an order?  I shouldn&#39;t have to repeat my address 3 times, be put on hold, repeat it again...repeat my phone number.  I&#39;ll finally had enough after a simple order took more then 5 minutes ( I know, is 5 minutes really that long?, it can be when you are talking to a HS kid).  I finally order from Lou&#39;s and guess what?

The same order was $10 cheaper!

I googled Naperville pizza online ordering, wanting to try a new place. Aurelio&#39;s came up, and even though I wasn&#39;t thrilled with the pricing, I liked the selection and placed an order to be delivered to my office. That was around noon.

The website said I would receive a call within about 15 minutes and my food would arrive in about 45 minutes. I was busy at work and didn&#39;t look at the time, until it was 1:30pm and my stomach was growling loudly.

I looked up the website again, found the phone number, stepped out of my office and called the restaurant. The girl who answered asked my name, then acted like she knew who I was and said she knew my &#34;cheese fiesta&#34; hadn&#39;t gone out yet. My what? I told her that wasn&#39;t what I ordered, then repeated my actual order back to her. 

She told me they never received my order, and that that happens sometimes. She said if you place an online order, you then need to call the restaurant to make sure they got the order. So tell me then, WHAT is the point of online ordering if you still have to call?!

I believe it&#39;s been under the same ownership for all this time. Their food is alright (we tried a couple of bento boxes and something from the Kitchen). But their service is quite dodgy.  
In our party of 3 they brought out the food for 2 of us right away, while the last person got his food 30 min later.

The sushi fish is high quality and delicious, but the rolls are about 3.5 stars. I highly recommend getting nigiri: you get big beautiful slabs of fish, so tender and delicious! Five stars for nigiri!! Two pieces are only $6-$7 which is very reasonable. I&#39;ve tried a bunch of different rolls, and while the fancy rolls are interesting and flavorful, the simple maki is way too padded with rice.

Hibachi is good- nothing outstanding compared to other Japanese hibachi restaurants, but there&#39;s nothing to complain about either. 

Tairo likes to do little things different that you&#39;ll catch here and there: they don&#39;t give mustard sauce instead a spicy horseradish sauce, extra shrimp at hibachi dinners, interesting veggies in the sushi roll (fancy leaves whaaaaa?)

The most dominating feature of this place is the neat building, lots of windows, and a big open space. I like feeling like I&#39;m going to a nice place, and Tairo does it for me! Most Japanese or sushi places are in a strip mall or another type of suite, and the big stand-alone restaurant feels special. 

I recommend it for a nice date! Please don&#39;t bring babies to spoil it though... They tend to cry at the hibachi heat and fire. Leave your kid at home!"

When you walk in, there&#39;s a koi pond and a waiting area to the right.  My friends and I had a good teppanyaki experience here.  The chef was entertaining, but I&#39;ve had better.  We were seated upstairs at 1 of the 2 hibachi tables.  It was loud with the fan on, which made it a challenge to communicate with our waitress.  She got 1 out of 7 orders wrong, which isn&#39;t too bad.

Hibachi Shrimp $24 - Always get the egg yolk sauce (a.k.a. golden sauce)!  It&#39;s just truly amazing and heart attack inducing, but worth it.  The sauce is so rich and creamy, and would make anything taste good, but especially shrimps.  The amount of food here was a little larger compared to other places.  This dish came with miso soup, fried rice and vegetables.

On Groupon, there&#39;s a &#34;Steak and Shrimp Dinner - $45 steak and shrimp dinner for two special&#34; that you can get by asking for the special at the restaurant.

I ended up getting an order of General Tso chicken with a side of fried rice and an order of their Smokey Mountain Roll.

The fried rice was ok at best. The cuts of chicken were very small and it lacked any real vegetables. I prefer a fried rice with onion, string beans, and even some egg. But oh well. The General&#39;s chicken was pretty good. The sauce was the perfect balance between thick and sticky and watery. It included some fresh pepper and onion slices too. I only wish it were more spicy. 

The sushi was the real treat. The flavor of the sushi I had was out of this world. It had salmon, avocado, and cucumber inside. With smoked salmon, lightly charred cream cheese, dry garlic and gomapon sauce on top. The only problem was the portions were waaaay to big! I hate to complain about big portions but....with sushi it needs to be a single bite portion.

Either way the sushi was awesome!! I suggest you try it."

My second experience, we dined-in today. After lunch on a Saturday, we were the only diners there the entire time. Pretty good service. OK miso. Dining companion enjoyed their house salad with ginger dressing.

Tried to ask about quail egg on roe, ended up with tamago nigiri instead. Their sushi rice is fantastic however, so it ended up being some of the best tamago I&#39;ve ever had. The eel? Not so much - seemed a little less than fresh. The maguro? Pretty solid. The &#34;white tuna?&#34; Freakin&#39; excellent, melt in your mouth.

We definitely enjoyed the nigori sake, but wish they had more varieties of nigori available.

The bacon lovers roll? Will pass next time.

-This is a neat looking place. The interior matches the exterior; very ornate. There are multiple areas - those specific to hibachi, sushi, and Chinese food. The bar is also really cool, and lots of televisions are displayed around the restaurant.
-On a Saturday night, we thought for sure we&#39;d need a reservation. Surprisingly we did not, and ate hibachi with only one other couple.
-Check out their website! They have loads of free coupons/offers. We just mentioned the offer, and got a free Dragon roll as an appetizer, which was delicious.
-THE PRICES OMG. I can&#39;t believe how incredible of a value this place is. Move over, Shinto, because you have competition not only in price, but in taste as well. Fried rice (with chicken, no less) is included in the meal price (instead of an upcharge), likewise for the golden sauce (also included). 
-The food is delish. The lobster tail was cooked perfectly, steak was so tender and cut like butter - and I ordered it well done! 

You&#39;re now probably wondering why I rated Tairyo two stars. 
-Let me preface this by saying: At 7.5 months pregnant, I&#39;m definitely showing. There is no question on if I am preggers or not.
-We had two servers all night - the hostess came by several times, as did another server, who did not speak English very well. At all. Service was sparing - not consistent but not horrible.
-Hubby ordered an alcoholic drink when we first sat down, I ordered water.
-About 15 minutes later, I decided to order a NON-alcoholic drink. I pointed to the page with non-alcoholic drinks (an entirely different page in the menu than the cocktails) and ordered the Fruit Punch.
-I tried a few sips of my drink (delivered by the server) and something just didn&#39;t taste right. I didn&#39;t taste alcohol, but it just...didn&#39;t taste like I expected. Several sips later, I was lightheaded and concerned. Hubby tried the drink and couldn&#39;t tell. Hubby then asked the hostess if there was alcohol in it, and she said yes - as if, NBD. Asked if that was a problem. A problem? I&#39;m not much for hard liquor while pregnant.
-The rest of the night had quite the damper. The hostess and server apologized, and even the hibachi chef was visibly concerned. They tried to give me a non-alcoholic drink, but I declined.
-AFTER our meal, the manager came out - he comped my drink (that I didn&#39;t drink...) and hubby&#39;s drink. I realize that the meals are expensive - and I didn&#39;t cause a scene (though I could have), but I guess I expected a bit more than my husband&#39;s drink to be comped for serving not only the wrong drink -- but an alcoholic drink to a pregnant patron.

That all said, I&#39;ll likely still return. It was a bad experience, but the food and prices were enough to bring me back....albeit, I likely won&#39;t be ordering a drink. Or I won&#39;t go back pregnant!"

This special included 2 miso soups, 1 appetizer, 8 pieces of sushi, and 3 maki rolls. Again, good value. I should also note that if you opt for this special, you are given a separate, limited menu. 

The soup was great, but our vegetable tempura appetizer was slightly undercooked based on the batter. I enjoyed the individual pieces of sushi. The maki rolls were mediocre; but to be fair, these weren&#39;t their signature rolls, which I&#39;m sure are better. For really good rolls, I would recommend Chef Soon in Lisle."

They had the most delicious pseudo-Chinese version of General Tso&#39;s chicken I&#39;ve ever had, and I&#39;ve been on a quest for sweet, crunchy, unhealthy, neon orange morsels of delight that could compare ever since, without much luck. 

For what it&#39;s worth, Tairyo is getting me closer.

We ordered takeout from here this week and appreciated the array of menu items, from sushi to hibachi to standard Chinese fare. I ordered the Orange chicken and potstickers, the husband got a myriad of sushi rolls - a Caterpillar, a Dragon, and a Philly. They were doing pickup only, but our food was ready in 20 short minutes.

The sushi was delicious and fresh tasting. The caterpillar roll especially was excellent - it was topped with some sort of delicious and inauthentic creamy sauce and fish roe which I loved. The potstickers were crispy without being too greasy. And the Orange chicken took me back to my college days, with its delicious, not-of-nature colored orange sauce, errant red peppers, and crispy, fatty, addictive chicken morsels. YUM. The entree size was good for two full dinners and was just exactly what I wanted - comforting, a bit gluttonous, and tasty as heck.

I have never been IN this restaurant but the other reviews make it seem like it&#39;s worth the stop. We&#39;ll definitely order takeout from here again soon. Nuclear orange chicken is one of my great weaknesses, and I&#39;m glad to find one that satisfies so close to home."

Service. Hahaha so I came with my dad who is actually a regular here, don&#39;t ask me why. When we came in the hostess greeted my dad and us (my mom was there too) so nicely and well. Our waitress on the other hand was just. Apathetic? The manager came a few times to ask how everything was since he knows my dad comes often but if he wasn&#39;t a regular we would have had minimal service. 

My parents got hibachi stuff. And our chef was great and his food was good. Really not much to say."

The hibachi is very well done and consistent after a few visits. They cook the food as you want it and always put on a good show. The kids at our table loved it.

The decor is beautiful. It&#39;s very warm and inviting, no tacky decor or worse for wear furniture. We did not sit at the bar, but it looked very nice, as did the sushi bar. I loved the koi pond near the entrance too.

For a place that generally looks busy, the night we went it was very cold outside and I think contributed to the few customers there dining. Our waitress was really kind, she made sure we understood the menu, and gave us some time to make our decisions. 

We ordered dumplings as an appetizer, steak and chicken for me, filet mignon and chicken for my boyfriend. First came out the soup, which was nice and warm, but not something I really enjoyed. It&#39;s a traditional broth soup, which doesn&#39;t seem to be my thing. Next was the salad with homemade ginger dressing. I don&#39;t love ginger normally, but this was really good. My only complaint with the salad was that it seemed very watery. Once I got through the top layer, it was soggy with a pool of watered down dressing at the bottom.

 Dinner was fabulous. Our hibachi chef was very polite and entertaining. Everything was cooked to perfection. I can&#39;t say a bad thing about it. Portions were not tiny nor overly abundant. I was full when I left. 

I look forward to dining here again!"

We went after getting a groupon and/or a restaurant.com gift card.  Even after getting the $50 off, we still spent another $100 in cash for our time for 5 people.

The food was on par for what you would expect, but I felt that the prices were a bit higher than what they should be.

It was busy and the food was good, but not necessarily good enough for what I paid, even at a discount.

The hibachi style show is always great, although this was pretty textbook, run-of-the-mill hibachi. Our chef did the onion ring fire and the off-beat clang-a-lang spatula banging thing, and he seemed to really enjoy it. It was nice and theatrical. I will say the prices are slightly high for the actual amount of food you get, and the steak my companion got was slightly more on the rare side than the medium rare. The rice was tasty and I don&#39;t have any real complaints about the seafood I ordered (scallops, calamari, and shrimp). I do wish the food was completed and plated around the same time, though, because it&#39;s awkward eating the fried rice while you&#39;re still waiting for your main meats to cook up. I know it&#39;s hard to get that timing down with the theatrics of it, but it&#39;s still something that I struggled with a tad.

The husband and I came to celebrate our anniversary -- side note, this seems to be THE Lisle birthday spot, there were at least five while we were there -- and were seated promptly. The place was busy but not packed. I liked the atmosphere, it was modern and cool looking. (Though it&#39;s true, the outside looks like a Chinese restaurant.)

Food: Very tasty. We both got hibachi steak. The soup was nice and oniony, the salad dressing so good I wanted to drink it, the fried rice, veggies and meat all nicely seasoned. I&#39;d never seen horseradish sauce offered before. My steak was cooked well and juicy and tender (although I think it was closer to well than medium, but, eh). Plenty of food but not an obscene amount. 

Service: On point. We never had to wait long for refills or plates clear. They were very efficient but not annoying. Everyone was friendly and personable, and the chef did a number of cool tricks including a few I hadn&#39;t seen before. 

The only small problem I had was that it was noisy, especially with the fan on and the chef cooking, and so I had a hard time hearing the wait staff at points. But they were patient with me.

It was a typical Monday, very slow, I guess, but were seated at the grill with 3 others.

The atmosphere is interesting and delightful but my main interest is taste, you can ooh and aah all you want on decor and ambiance but if food and service suffer, so will I.

We started off with some sushi rolls which I must say were DELICIOUS and fresh, wonderful, I could have made a meal with those.  The rice was not sticky and tender, cooked perfectly, I cannot rave enough and the boat they were served in was interesting and different.

The hibachi chef was the highlight, skilled and funny.  A job well done with the food and entertainment!  

On a sour note, service was NOT the highlight of the evening.  A little retraining is much necessary for our gal, Gladys.  She seemed sweet but very slow and inattentive.  Took too long to pick up dirty plates, had to ask for water refill, would I like sugar with my tea (why yes, I would but didnt bother) and was clueless about what gluten or wheat free was.  Also, our salads were drowning in water :(

We asked if any of the items had wheat, to which she looked confused and had to find out, in addition to inquiring what Tamari sauce was.  She never responded and we could figure from what we ordered that there shouldnt be.  Thankfully they had Tamari and was impressed that the hibachi chef knew that we may have  allergies and used it for our meal.   By the way, not a fact that we do, but we prefer a wheat free diet.

I ordered the shrimp hibachi and was asked by the server if I wanted a soy sauce or garlic sauce, I told her, garlic, I LOVE garlic.  Instead, unbeknownst to me, she had no idea what she was talking about because the chef made shrimp with a bread crumb topping.  Wish I had known that was for me, otherwise, I would have pointed out the error immediately.  I thought it was for the other patrons.

Once he placed them on my plate, I asked what the topping was, ugh, bread crumbs.  Yes, I dont want bread crumbs and why I asked if anything we ordered had wheat.  I dont want to be one of &#39;those&#39; snobs, but if you know people may have allergies to things, your staff should be educated on it, very important.  The chef was very aware our server was not.

The manager was allowed for the replacement though he didnt look thrilled about it, sorry, not my bad.  That one totally on your server, ask more questions and I am at the hibachi grill, I want hibachi shrimp not fried shrimp with bread crumb topping, common sense, in my opinion

The evening ended with a happy birthday sung to a scoop of complimentary ice cream and birthday picture.  This was a very nice touch :)

Only three stars because of service.  Will we be back, definitely, different server, of course and more sushi!!"

My sister uses a cane and is a Senior Citizen in her 80&#39;s. After walking up a long flight of stairs she was tired. Hard for her. We came in for Chinese. We were told we could not sit at the Hibachi table for just Chinese food so she sat us at the Sushi Bar which had high top chairs. My sister cannot sit at high tops with her bad legs. There were no other seats in the room. So I asked again if we could just sit at a hibachi table to order Chinese. One hostess said yes and then the other started arguing with her in a different language. Then the answer was no. So we just stood there, my sister with her cane. So then the angry one told us we would have to sit upstairs. More stairs for my poor sister. At this point we should have just left. My sister looked at me as I was ready to leave and she said she would climb the stairs. She was hungry. She made it up yet another set of stairs. We ate and we had 3 different servers. No one asked us how it was or refilled our drinks. Then one guy takes the money for the check, I told him I needed change and he never came back with it. Finally, had to call him over and he said that I had said to keep the change which would have been over a 25% tip. I usually leave 20% for good service, this time I only left 15% because they are rude. The bathroom is 2 floors down at the entry level. How do they get away with this? If you are disabled do not come here as they are breaking the ADA law by not making their public restaurant and bathroom facilities easily accessible for disabled people. Yes, they have a disabled entry in the back of the building FAR from the handicap parking. But my sister cold not walk that far so she struggled up those stairs and then even more stairs when we were denied access to seating on the first floor. Finally, the bathroom smelled sooooo bad that I almost threw up. Too bad because food was not bad. Never Ever Ever going back."

I experience was a bit isolated, I was only one of two tables in the place and, again, it was near the end of the night.  I sat at the sushi bar, had a seaweed salad and order some sushi.  The salad was lacking, as it was seaweed on top, but what seemed to be kale on the bottom.

The sushi was good, not great, as were the prices.  In the realm of Yelp, the 3 star, A-OK, seems to fit this for me well.  I am not dying to go back here, but I certainly won&#39;t rule it out, and if I am looking for food later again, and they are one of the only places open I would certainly give them a go.  

I did not try any of the hibachi fair.

I liked a couple differences here from the competition - the horseradish sauce served, the nice burnt rice green tea, and the relaxed dining.  The seats though were all short for the grill table, but it was tolerable.  We found all the servings to be fresh, not over salty, and nicely done.  The chefs were also a tad more artistic than at other local places.  I had the spicy onion beef hibachi (medium rare as requested) and wife had the chicken hibachi dinner.  We were enticed by their restaurant.com participation.  They weren&#39;t particularly busy for their capacity (what Teppanyaki is these days?), but it made for a nice comfortable and relaxed dinner, and we&#39;ll be back."

Ambiance:  Wow.  Very nicely laid and out taken care of, the whole place is beautiful to eat in.  Teppanyaki is the focus, with multiple teppanyaki tables and only a small non-working revolving sushi bar... but don&#39;t be fooled...

Agedashi Tofu:  Nice crispy exterior, soft lush interior... this dish was made well, wtith the exception that the tofu pieces were cut too large making it hard to handle for dipping into the broth and enjoying.  If only they were to cut each tofu into half or fourths, and then coat and fry, this would&#39;ve been perfect.

Firefighter&#39;s Roll:  With spicy mayo, jalapenos as main ingredients (along with white tuna, eel, etc.), we expected a lot more spice and kick.  It was fairly tame with a little bit of spice.  Tasty roll, but not as much heat as I&#39;d like.

Nigiri:  Stand out pieces here were the sake (salmon) and white tuna.  Especially the white tuna... fresh and creamy, excellent for enjoying.  Saba (mackerel) is cleaner tasting that some other places, so not the best or worst.  Tamago was not as sweet as I would have expected.  Sweet shrimp with the fried shrimp head was tasty, and as an added bonus, they place some tobiko (fish eggs) on top.  Unagi (eel) tasted pretty standard.

Verdict:  It&#39;s on a potential list to come back for.  The pricing/value isn&#39;t as great as some places, but the sushi quality is good and the ambiance is great for a date or family gathering.  We haven&#39;t tried the teppanyaki yet, which seems to be the main entertainment and draw for people, so will update the next time we&#39;re here.

Additional personal opinion:  By having both a revolving sushi bar AND teppanyaki, they may have inadvertently weakened their potential sushi business...  while part of it may be location, you can see the revolving sushi bars in Rolling Meadows that are focused only on sushi tend to do well, while this place almost never has it on (relative to all the Yelp reviews I&#34;m seeing).  To clarify, I believe sushi and teppanyaki can work together fine in a restaurant... but the revolving sushi bar specifically is a very niche market, where it may only work as a specialized store."

(I hear their normal Japanese fare is good but cannot comment on it as I&#39;ve actually never had it before).

First off, Wing, the manager is the epitome of a hard-working Chinese person. He was extremely accommodating and frequently went the extra mile to make sure that we were happy and relatively worry-free. That man deserves a big, fat, hefty raise.

There were three set banquet menus to choose from, the cheapest one had the simplest dishes (salt/pepper chicken, steamed fish, etc) while the most expensive one had higher class food (shark fin soup, abalone, lobster). We went with the middle menu which was, for us, a perfect combination of food and price.

The banquet was held in the basement (old karaoke room when the restaurant was known as Grand Mandarin) which doesn&#39;t seem that great on paper but comfortably held 150 or so of our guests. The sound system was great, there were several flat screen TVs mounted on the walls and they even said we could use their karaoke machine on the night (but we didn&#39;t). They gave us access to the room the Wednesday before our Saturday wedding so we could arrange and decorate things. They even gave free food and drinks to our friends when they went there the night before to set up DJ equipment and do sound tests.

In addition to the basement, they let us use the waiting area (to the right and over the bridge once you walk through the front door)  as well as one of their lockable storage rooms for my wife to use as a changing room when she slipped into her Chinese dress halfway through the reception. 

The bulk of the cost came from the food, which was charged by the table (at ten people per table). We were able to negotiate a slight discount on the menu, then they factored in the tip, tacked it on and that was our bottom-line bill. Service was all-inclusive, they said. No charge for soda and a bottle of champagne for each table, no extra charges for cake cutting, cake serving or cork pulling. Absolutely no sneaky extra fees AT ALL.

The wedding banquet was in the traditional Chinese style and the food was absolutely amazing. It turns out that the chef (who, I believe, is the owner&#39;s father-in-law) used to be head chef at the Hyatt Hotel in Hong Kong before retiring and coming to Chicago. We had countless guests come up to us that night to tell us how stunning the food was. In fact, eight months on, we STILL have people telling us how good the food was.

All said and done, we had an amazing reception with unbelievable food at a modest but charming venue for a fraction of the cost of the average reception at a western banquet hall where guests are served a grey slab of meat with a side of overdone vegetables. This was an absolute no-brainer."

We were greeted by a hostess that was either trying to hard, didn&#39;t know how to talk to guests, or it was her first day on the job. She sat us at a large table for the hibachi grill, we took a look at the menu and decided that we&#39;re more in the mood for sushi, so we say by the rotating sushi table. Maybe since this was a Wednesday night, but there was no sushi on rotation, only seaweed salads and mushroom salads. We settled on the all you can eat sushi for $20.

The waitress just plopped down peaces of paper for our orders and marched off without much explanation. We searched for descriptions of the sushi through a different menu we found, and when the waitress came back we wanted more details on how the all you can eat work, because it is different in place. She either did not understand English or had no idea what we were talking about because she had to go back in the kitchen like 3 times to answer us... And all we wanted to know if we would get charged for the sushi we dont eat, and yes you get charged for the pieces you do not finish.

I settled on the crunch roll and dragon roll with seaweed salad. The also menu is clearly states that before your meal you receive a soup, salad and green tea. 

Our waitress brought me my seaweed salad, but when we asked her about our soups, salads and tea she once again had no idea what we were talkin about. She had to reread the menu a couple of times. She did end up brining the soup and salads out, which were actually pretty good. I never did get that green tea :-/

The sushi was all good, the wasabi was a little overpowering on the crunch roll, but I scrapped some off and it was delicious. The dragon roll tasted different than what ive had before, there was a LOT of eel and it was good. My friend got the mermaid and an assortment of sushimi, which was all very good. I was extremely happy with the taste of the fish, very very fresh. 

After our bill was bought out, the waitress simply hunched over my back when I was putting cash in the holder thing, and she barely gave my friend time to sign the receipt before taking her holder thing. Very unprofessional!

Aside from the horrible waitress we got, we loved the place. The decor is very...Asian and clean and pleasant to the eye. The sushi maker was funny. The food is delicious. Next time when I will make my way out to Naperville, I will make sure to try the hibachi."

My kids loved the food and &#34;the show&#34;.

We ordered among Filet Mignon, Shrimp, and chicken on Hibachi. All meat were fresh and cooked with right amount of seasoning. I would say it is quite comparable to Benihana&#39;s Hibachi if not better. Also tried the Seafood Udon and some sushi which are fine but not exceptional. 

Kids were amazed by the chef&#39;s cooking. The chef was flipping the raw eggs in the air with his cooking thing and catching the eggs with his pocket or the hat. The onion ring volcano was moving on the grill like the Chu chu train. The fried rice was made to the shape of heart before it was served. The chef actually flipped the bowl with rice in it using his cooking tool. Thanks for &#34;the show&#34;, I was able to enjoy the Mojoto which was excellent. 

Like in other reviews, it is a very clean and nicely decorated place. Services was great except we have a bit argument when we were using the Restaurant.com certificate. Even with that, I think it is kind pricey to dine there but my kids loved it so we will be back."

I go to a lot of these Japanese food at table places cause a family member is crazy about them. I generally do not like them cause they serve the different foods so far apart - veggies vs meat - that everything is cold and they do not understand what rare meat means. 

BUT suprisenly enough, this place cooked everything FAST enough, that I actually could eat my meat, veggies and rice warm  together for the first time. And when I made panicy motions that my steak was being cooked too long to be really really rare, the cook actually took the meat off and gave it to me immediately .

A normal meal at last!   I have never had that happen at Beni Hani, or Domo 77 ever.

The service was good and unlike lots of these places I did not get the sideways look for ordering white rice or refusing the shrimp toss.

Normally the waitress explains I get fried rice when I say &#34;white rice&#34;, I get the lecture... and I end up explaining the gaijin hates fried rice and then I end up explaining the gaijin hates seafood and no, shrimp is seafod too, so don&#39;t put it on my plate when they throw dead sea life around the table.

All in all, A good experience and I will be back."

I ordered 2 house salads and asked to add onion, disney roll, and dragon roll. The house salad were covered in an unreasonable amount of onion. Between the 2, there must&#39;ve been an entire raw onion on my salads. It stunk up my entire hotel room. After removing the excess onion, I gave the salad a try. I was still highly disappointed. The dressing was very watery and very lacking in flavor. I ate only a few bites before deciding it was a lost cause. The sushi was about the same. Both rolls were drenched in sauce and the texture and flavors were not good. Again, I had a  few bites after scraping some of the excess sauce off before I gave up and calleed the whole thing  a loss.  I promptly threw it all away in effort to rid my hotel room of the terrible smells. Later, I kicked myself for not thinking to take a picture of the insane amount of onion on the salad. I felt like someone must&#39;ve been p[laying a joke or giving me an FU for making a special request. I spent $48.65 including GrubHub fee and generous tip as I always tip well even when I&#39;m forced to tip before receiving any service. Again, I actually ate only a few bites and I enjoyed none of it. I ended up ordering room service from my hotel. I advice you to never order carryout from this place, you will likely be extremely disappointed and will just have to order another dinner that it more edible."

The presentation was nice and the fish served over rice was wonderful. The flavor was mild and the next time I have lunch there, I will be sure to get something from the Sushi bar!

The chicken didn&#39;t seem cooked enough and the waitress spoke such poor english we were not sure she had the order correct.  As much as I liked it the first time I was there, I disliked it the 2nd time.

The place is very neat, on the outside &amp; inside so great atmosphere for starters.  I do eat sushi with chicken teriyaki so I opted for that.  I had something similar at a sushi place in Boston.  It was very good, up to par for sure only I wish they would&#39;ve waited to bring out my food when the two people I was with were ready to eat their main course, which was steak and I will definitely be trying that out during my next visit.

We did have a reservation (as recommended by our Groupon) and Sundays are known to be a bit slower in restaurants, especially during the school year. 

We were seated immediately and the only ones on our side of the table. We were served drinks and our appetizer promptly. Luckily, the rest of our table (must all be seated to get hibachi started) came within 15 minutes and we didn&#39;t even notice they were waiting to start! The show was fantastic and I was pleased he didn&#39;t try to throw shrimp in my mouth. Yuck. The show was nice and entertaining. We were served tons of food! I ordered the vegetable hibachi and my husband had the chicken. We each received a soup, rice, salad with that incredible ginger dressing, our meals, shrimp appetizer, and ice cream for $16 and $17 each. We were SO STUFFED. The wonderful server knew that I was a veggie because I told him I&#39;d prefer steamed rice instead of the fried rice (w/egg). He then told me that the soup is made with chicken broth and if I&#39;d prefer a miso instead! How nice of him to make the effort!

We ordered edamame, two hibachi dinners, 1 large Asahi, 1 soda, 1 pineapple juice... all for the price of our groupon = $25! I thought it was an exceptional price for all we received. Of course originally it was $50 but not for us! For those without groupons, they offered 20% off just as customer appreciation for EVERYONE else no matter what they ordered. People were happy all around us.

We thought the service was great, the place was spacious and clean, and the food was great! We were a bit confused by the Chinese look with Japanese food inside, but whatever... glad this building was taken over and not left vacant like so many other buildings.

Get one, get them all, they&#39;re all tasty. For me, if I can savor the flavor of the piece without actually tasting the ocean, I&#39;m sold. 

The &#34;spicy rolls&#34; were all prepared similarly and had their own unique flavors. I&#39;m usually not a fan of the white tuna, but this one satisfied my buds of tastes, indeed, right down to my belly. Salmon is usually hit or miss wherever I have it, but it passed with swimming colors. As the spicy tuna is always my go-to, I was heartily satisfied with Tairyo&#39;s.

The Dragon and Firefighter (a Tairyo specialty) Rolls were excellent as well. My wife has got me hooked on unagi (eel), and it was prepared in these rolls to my liking.

The sushi chef, being in his late fifties early sixties, knows what he&#39;s doing. (We watched him prepare a number of pieces from the sushi bar.) It is apparent that he has much experience in this fine art.

I wouldn&#39;t consider myself a sushi snob, especially since I&#39;ve been to only about a half a dozen places. With that said, this is the best sushi I can recall having. Ambiance is open and inviting and the service was excellent, to boot.

As I came here with my dad for Fathers&#39; Day, I plan on returning with my wife and friends to try more sushi, as well as the hibachi. Looking forward to it...

The chef was very entertaining and put on a good show while cooking our food, which was excellent food by the way. The drink service was a bit slow, but it wasn&#39;t a huge problem. 

Like everyone else mentioned, the sushi conveyor belt had basically nothing on it, but there were only two people sitting up there anyways. 

The fried rice was provided at no extra charge, and we were even given some shrimp at no charge. 

The drinks we got from bar, where they told us to wait,  had to be paid for with the bartender, rather than just billing them with our dinner. That was kind of annoying.  We also sat for at least ten minutes after our food was boxed up, waiting for the bill. It took about another ten minutes for them to come back to the table for me to sign for the bill too.

    Decor:3/5  Don&#39;t let the Red and Gold Pagoda Style Facade  fool you this an&#39;t no run of the mill Japanese food. 
    You step in side and your greeted by a Koi pond and water fall feature that is really unexpected... with a little bridge and waiting area. 
     This place is not so modern and minimalist that you could not wear flip flops and your jean shorts, but nice enough were you would not want to. I really loved the bamboo railing, that lead you to the Main bar/ Dining room/ Sushi Bar. Lots of windows make this space feel open and clean!  Red and black decor with blue subway tiles? Not something I would of picked myself but I digress. 

   Wait Staff: This place gets a 4/5: Initially we had stellar service, we had thee waitresses that were all up in our water cups, and clearing our plates,then around ice cream time we reached a grinding halt, nothing for 10 minutes. Finally the manager came to us and asked it we had been served, and rushed to get us our ice cream and check. Our waitress was no where to be found! We used our yelp discount!

  Taste: 5/5 This is where this place really excelled: I could write a romance novel about the horseradish sauce, It had a great kick! Plus it&#39;s creamy and flavorful! Really Well Done! The ginger was also above average, and was great on the salad, which had broccoli in it!. The soup is chicken and mushroom, I prefer miso but will live! Another perk, is you get chicken fried or veggie fried rice for no up charge! I ordered the chicken and golden shrimp, although it came w/o mushrooms, they did not smother it in teriyaki sauce, and it was perfectly cooked. The golden shrimp was on point! He Ordered The shrimp chicken and Filet. The filet  was huge! He likes his steak well done, and the cook actually let him taste a piece before they took it off the grill, I know that seem like a no brainier but is a service that is rarely offered!"

We were not sure if this building had anything going on in it since it had changed restaurants a few times. 

Right away the restaurant sticks out like a sore thumb to traffic of Ogden Ave, because of its pure ornate-ness. One would think that the building would have been more likely placed in China or Japan. 

I was especially pleased with the entrance way, there was a mini coi pond and fountain. Overall the interior decor was pleasing to the eye and not cheap. We were asked where we wanted to sit, seeing as they had a regular dining room, 10 hibachi tables, a full bar, and a full sushi bar. Also, downstairs is a full reception room and dance floor for any large occasion. 

My mother was greeted with a flower and a glass of champagne for the holiday. Upon receiving the menu, I had noticed that it was a special Mother&#39;s day menu with nothing but specials and cheaper pricing. We decided to get 3 rolls of sushi along with three entrees on the hibachi grill. We got the Godzilla roll, the Canadian roll, and the Grilled chicken teriyaki roll. All three of the rolls were freshly made and very tasty. We sat through about 10-20 minutes of preparation by the hibachi chef before we got all of our food. My parents got the steak, while I got the chicken and shrimp. 

I would have to say that I was not disappointed with anything I ate at Tairyo. However, on the flip-side, the service was not as expected with such a nice venue. The waitresses could barley understand the questions we were asking them, nor did they check-in frequently. However, the manager was very nice and could understand us just fine. He gave us a coupon for 25 dollars off our next visit and we were able to use the yelp discount coupon as well. 

One thing I must say before I end would be that this place is not the cheapest place to eat. I would suggest coming for be occasions.

I give Tairyo a 4/5 for its fabulous food, but for its not so good waitresses."

We got there around 6:45, no reservation and were told the wait would be about 20-30 minutes. It was pretty busy so without a reservation half an hour wasn&#39;t so bad of a wait. I gave my name and said we would be back because we wanted to go to H Mart nearby for some groceries. 

We got back around 7:10 and we checked in to see if they called us but they said no and that since our wait time of 7:20 hasn&#39;t happened yet(!), we would just have to wait. Ok. 7:20 arrives. Still nothing. Another 10 minutes pass by and bf asks if I would be mad if we just bailed cuz we&#39;re getting kinda hungry here. I said no but he goes to check again. At this point this lady who was waiting with us asked me if we had a reservation. I said no and she said she and her family did....at 6:40. Both our parties got seated at the same time, close to 7:30. She had a reservation and we didn&#39;t. You do the math.

ANYWAY. The wait notwithstanding, the food was very good. The service was pretty attentive. I&#39;m allergic to shrimp and everybody else at the table ordered shrimp. So I made it clear to our server that I didn&#39;t like shrimp, I&#39;m allergic, I will die if I eat shrimp (not really, just get super itchy) and that shrimp must not touch my food. Ok I&#39;m exaggerating but I told her I&#39;m allergic and she said ok then we&#39;ll have to cook your food first so it doesn&#39;t get contaminated. Talk about service! I felt so special and that they really cared about me and didn&#39;t want me to be all itchy. =) 

Bf and I both ordered the scallops and filet combo. With this you get soup and salad, choice of veggie or chicken fried rice, and a good portion of veggies. We ordered gyoza and agedashi tofu also, the former being ok nothing special and the latter kinda mushy. =(

The scallops were tasty and a good-sized portion, at least 6-7 pieces each. Both of us were surprised at the size of the filet. They were thick pieces of meat instead of the usual skimpy pieces at other places, seasoned just right.

All in all it was a tasty meal. Would I come back? Yeah, with more people cuz it seems more fun with a bigger group."

The remodel really did the space justice - 4 hibachi centers, each with 2 grills, a huge center bar, and a really cool sushi bar. 

I&#39;m not a huge fan of hibachi because I my only experience has been Benihana - I&#39;m still hungry when I leave, and the food wasn&#39;t that good.  

Not this place - soup and salad, and plentiful portions of meat.  Excellent service."

My boyfriend and i live across the street from this place and have watched it come to life over the last few months, eagerly awaiting a new hibachi place for us to try. We are loyal Domo 77 fans and weren&#39;t quite sure what to expect. 

First of all, the decor is wonderful. the colors mix well together (sort of a ruddy orange mixed with black is the theme, with a sprinkling of bamboo green thrown in). They have a charming little goldfish pond (not koi, actual goldfish) and the whole place is well lit and very open. The seating is like Domo 77, where you have multiple seats at the hibachi. The only improvement i would make is that the tables are a bit too high. Not annoyingly so but i noticed it at once when we sat down. I&#39;m 5&#39;4&#34; and it came up to about my chest. Just a minor note and it by no means spoiled dinner

Second of all, the waitstaff was very friendly. This was only their second night, but they were professional and eager to please. Almost everyone came by to ask us how we were liking everything. The owner, the manager, several of the waitresses and a nice woman named Jennifer (one of the owners?) came by to talk to us and make sure everything was good. She explained that they wanted to make their restaurant a little bit different than other places, from the food to the atmosphere..

Thirdly, the food was fantastic! I had the filet mignon and shrimp and my boyfriend had steak, shrimp and chicken. Pretty much the same deal as other hibachi places. You get a mushroom soup, salad, fried rice and shrimp appetizer. The food looked great and tasted even better. I am in love with that clear mushroom soup they serve. The beef was melt in your mouth delicious and the drinks were reasonably priced. Then, there was the sushi. I had the philly roll and 2 tamago. The boyfriend had our usual spider roll. It was fresh and cool and very tasty. My philly roll was velvety-smooth and the spider roll had a hint of sweetness that he loved. Just as we finished stuffing ourselves, the waitress came and mentioned, oh, by the way, you get ice cream with your meal too. And we got a plate of oranges (probably because we kept telling them how great it all was!). 

We will absolutely be back and i would recommend it to anyone who loves hibachi and/or sushi (they have a cool little sushi bar in the back and the pieces are on a little conveyor belt.) It&#39;s a little pricey, as most of these places are, but it was our anniversary so we spoiled ourselves."

We usually dine at another HIbachi restaurant  in Wheaton. The only thing that i hate is why I leave there my clothes and hair reak like grease. This place (Tairyo) must have some great venilation because I have not smelled like that at all coming out of there.
The only suggestion is: if you go there for a Hibachi dinner, dont expect to eat right away or get out of there quickly.
Last time I was there we waited for about 45 minutes- hour for a seat. The whole dinner process was like a 2.5 hour ordeal!!!
Great for a social night out with time to kill."

I used to eat here when it was that Chinese place.. I was skeptical to stop in because I remember the other place being kinda dark, dirty, and run down.

Alas! Tairyo is nothing like any other Japanese Hibachi experience that I&#39;ve had. It&#39;s very trendy, clean, nicely decorated. Huge bar, many many hibachi tables for groups. Also, unlike lots of places, you have the option to just order your food- without the &#39;show&#39;, and..they will do take-out unlike Domo..

Our chef was really friendly, engaging, and talented. He truly made us feel special, not like he was just doing a mundane routine (which I&#39;m sure can get tiring..).

Typical menu with all the great staples. I highly suggest the egg yolk sauce (don&#39;t even look up the calories..) and the side of garlic. Each side is a PERFECT topping for anything that you will order. The portions are huge, we went here for lunch, split a meal, left full, and still had left overs.

We will definitely be back, as a matter of fact.. we&#39;ve already booked their private party room for an upcoming birthday. Can&#39;t wait!"

Food is always delicious.  I like that they added shrimp fried rice to the menu. Best part is they make special rice rolls (just sushi rice with seaweed paper) for my son.

We have eaten Hibachi in almost all the western suburbs a number of times and this one is the best by far! Actually best all-around restaurant! Great service, comparable prices to other Japanese steakhouses, but superb service that surpasses any other place.
We also have gluten allergies and can&#39;t have soy sauce, usually the servers and cooks don&#39;t understand or have sympathy when we tell them we have special requirements. But at Tairyo they were awesome! They were happy to make everything with the special soy sauce we brought and they also made sure to double check with us for everything before serving it!"

I would avoid high-end drinks. I ordered what I thought was a reasonably priced $11 scotch. I said light ice. I watched her measure a 1 oz shot and poor it over a half glass of ice. It was the stingiest portion of scotch I have ever gotten... When I refused to except it she said &#34;That is light ice&#34;. To that I replied it is also light on the scotch.

The service was extremely attentive.  I nearly felt like I was being stalked as they watched for my tea cup to empty so they can refill it.

The cooking was typical teppanyaki, with the same tricks and jokes (that&#39;s not a complaint, just more of an observation).

The food is excellent.  Fresh ingredients, great taste, and a lot to eat for the money.  In addition to the steak, I also tried a piece of sushi.  I&#39;m basing this review on the teppanyaki and my steak (I&#39;d probably knock a star off based on my one piece of sushi [not quite fresh enough for my liking] - however their sushi bar had a  covered conveyor like one I&#39;ve seen in Japan).

The building is an old Chinese restaurant built with over-the-top Oriental style, but the inside is significantly improved.  They did a nice job inside.
I also noted that their china was really nice and had more style than even more expensive places of any ilk.

It&#39;s worth checking out and I&#39;d go again."

There is just one thing that I can&#39;t figure out.  The half dozen or so times that I have been here, the place has been relatively dead with only about a dozen or so customers in the place.

The food here is absolutely fantastic.  I usually order the steak, chicken, and shrimp dinner.  The amount of food for just over $30 is unbelievable.  On average, I always receive roughly eight ounces of filet., in addition to the generous portions of chicken and shrimp.  The chicken fried rice is the best I have had at this type of restaurant, and they serve it with no extra charge.

The service here is great and they always keep glasses full of whatever you may be drinking.  So far, this is the best Japanese Steakhouse that I have been too, even eclipsing my old favorite, Kampai Japanese Steakhouse.  I just wish Tairyo would develop a spicy garlic sauce too!!!"

I had the ham and brie sandwich.  Delicious! it was carved and browned ham with warm rich brie on a croissant smeared with spicy mustard. Atop the brie was an apple-golden raisin compote.  
A lovely salad accompanied the sandwich.  Romaine, baby spinach, baby beets, tender carrots, thinly sliced radish, halved grape tomatoes and large capers.  On the side was a generous dollop of moist and creamy goat cheese.

My impression is that the the two chefs try to do the &#34;front&#34; business as well as cook, and they may not temperamentally suited for doing the server jobs, especially when it&#39;s busy.  They are artists in the kitchen!   We went to the ST with friends for lunch, and it took them an hour and a quarter to get the food on out table.  My wife will never return.  

That being said, the food is excellent.  I stop in for breakfast occasionally, usually in the early afternoon when there are few diners.  Eggs, omelets, toast, potatoes, bacon are all excellent.   I occasionally take home sandwiches for dinner.  Yesterday it was the ham sandwich - ham, greens, mustard, and sauteed apples.  Very tasty.  Accompanying any sandwich is an excellent salad which is a meal in itself, plus a serving of soup.  It&#39;s all been very tasty and well prepared.   Coffee is Americano, so it has plenty of body and flavor.

We had to ask for to go boxes (multiple times) when they delivered the food because we&#39;d already been there an hour and needed to go. Our boxes took another 15 minutes and by this time we were going to be late to our next meeting.

The chili was excellent and a marvelous way to start our feast.  After the soup our salads arrived and were excellent as well. 
The salad was a medley if mixed greens, fennel and green beans.  Gorgonzola Cheese and a Raspberry  Vinaigrette Dressing topped this salad.  All the vegetables were fresh crisp and outstanding.  Our pizza was the best I have had in a long while and was very different.  The crust was cracker thin and the topping of cheese and roasted vegetables was fantastic.  When it was time for the bill we were each given a cute take home bag of fresh warm cookies.

The quality of the food is unbelievable. I ordered an omelet with peppers and herbs and it was divine! It came with a side of crispy potatoes which were to die for. Also, the ginger lemonade is amazing! Everything was so fresh.

Although the place is small, the atmosphere is very cozy and inviting.

The man serving us was one of the owners. He was so friendly and helpful. Some people say the service is bad, but I completely disagree. The business isn&#39;t run by that many people because all their money and energy goes into the wonderful food they make! They are also slaving away in the kitchen preparing huge catering orders too so people seriously need to cut them some slack.

Can&#39;t wait to come back!"

The offer was soup, salad, bread for two. The squash soup was very flavorful, spicy.  The salad and dressing were delicious. My husband loved the sourdough bread, and finished the small piece I couldn&#39;t.

But other than that one time I have never been able to successfully place an order. They have told me they &#39;ran out of food&#39; or just aren&#39;t open during normal business hours. Today though has to take the cake. I ordered well ahead because they are known to take a very long time. When I went to pick up my order I was immediately met by the rudest man I have ever had the displeasure of speaking to. He told me I never actually placed the order and that I could order my sandwich but it would take at least 30mins to make. I told him I was pretty sure I ordered and he immediately snapped at me that he &#39;isn&#39;t hard of hearing and I NEVER ordered&#39;. He made no qualms about hiding his anger with me. I have never had a place i am trying to give my business to be so incredibly rude to me. The immaturity continued as I was walking out, confused and disappointed, and he yelled after me waving his hand &#39;BUHBYE&#39;. I still can&#39;t even believe a restaurant would conduct themselves in this manner.."

Not only is the food consistently delicious with a gourmet flair, the menu is constantly changing. The restaurant menu is informed based on the catering side&#39;s overflow of ingredients, so you&#39;ll get to try combinations of things you may have otherwise skipped -- and you&#39;ll never be disappointed! The prices are reasonable for the amount and quality of the food you get, and the owners always strive to give out little extras (chocolate covered fruit, delicious cinnamon toast). Although this is a different dining experience since smokey tomatoes&#39; main business is catering, the food makes up for any missteps people may  notice in the service (the owner/chefs often wait on tables personally, so their attention is divided between serving and cooking!). Bottom line, go there!"

It&#39;s amazingly fresh, flavorful, and delicious. We came on a weekend soon after it opened and had breakfast. The food was to die for. 

However, the service isn&#39;t the greatest. Perhaps a two star. The girl assisting was friendly but forgetful. There was a small rush and I could tell she was having a tough time getting everything done. She forgot drinks, almost gave inaccurate change back,  and just seemed frazzled. 

Also, the hours. What hours? It&#39;s so confusing. I&#39;ve tried stopping back three+ other times for breakfast/lunch and they aren&#39;t open. 

And it&#39;s frustrating to see another table sit 10 minutes after you and yet get a pizza 10-15 minutes before you get your omelette.

Fast forward three months to me trying to possibly order some catering for Thanksgiving. How can that possibly go wrong?! I call and inquire if there is a menu to order from and the guy who answered the phone was incredibly d-bag rude. Hello, I&#39;m a freakin&#39; customer prepared to spend $$$ at your establishment and you are flipping&#39; rude on the phone?! Next time you put a menu on your Facebook page, take into consideration that a person is not going to scroll down through a page or more of comments to find said menu... If you comment about individuals placing an order for Thanksgiving, post the damn menu again as well. 

Yes, the food is good. But service, seating, friendliness, and being open like maybe some set hours are kind of required to have a truly successful eatery/catering spot. 

I&#39;ve given up on this place."

What makes this place so especially unique is the fact that you never know what is going to be available, as the menu changes from one day to the next. The serving portions are plentiful so no bird appetites need bother, unless you wish to take the leftovers home (which, I always do). 

The prices are extremely reasonable, the service always amasingly pleasant, and the atmosphere very relaxed within this very cozy little place. However, if you are in a hurry, forego a visit until you have plenty of time to spare. It is not an &#34;assembly line&#34;, fast-paced restaurant. There is never a rush which is part of its charm. In many aspects, it reminds me of the small bistro-style cafes you will find in Europe, only nicer. 

I have been a guest in many of the world&#39;s most renown restaurants over the years and this place is definitely one of my all-time favourites."

It does have some quirks though, but if you want a fabulous meal and don&#39;t mind the anticipation of waiting for a truly artistic meal, this is your place!
(if you have the patience of a 2 yr old and are just as sensitive- then head to the nearest  fast food chain where you&#39;ll get your meal within seconds of ordering, with no personal interaction from the &#34;chefs&#34;.)

My friend took me here, just raving about the food.  
We sat ourselves outside on a gorgeous afternoon and after a few minutes one of the owners/chefs came out and asked if this was our first time...as it&#39;s kinda &#34;self serve&#34;.  So we went inside and got our own water cups and silverware.  
No big deal.  (my friend filled me in that they usually had a girl working there as hostess, and that this particular gentleman was a bit gruff, but the other guy was more friendly.)
While inside, we asked for a menu- which was a cute little parchment on a clipboard.  Menu was small, but there was a great selection w/ salad included with the meal.   My friend warned that they usually are out of items, so I was not surprised when she ordered a steak sandwich and was told that they were out of the steak.  No big deal, many other options to choose from.
(perhaps because their business is mainly catering, they run out of items unexpectedly.  Still, no big deal.) 

She ordered the lemon chicken sandwich, I ordered an omlet.  I&#39;d asked what veggies were available and he loaded it up!  (I brought 1/2 of it home for tomorrow)   I&#39;ve never had a salad that was so flavorful... it had fresh corn, dill, dandelion, some type of soft cheese and a dressing that was barely noticable- yet made all the flavors pop!  I will go back just for the salad.
And if you go- definitely order the ginger lemonade...it is to die for!  SO fresh (w/ mint and lemon zest) and it&#39;s made as you order- so don&#39;t be alarmed that it isn&#39;t delivered to your table within a minute...It&#39;s FRESH SQUEEZED!

We were given a bag of fresh, hand-crafted cookies with our bill.
After the meal, my friend decided to have them create a picnic for her to take to Ravinia next week.  She told them what she and her husband like, and they wil created the meal with whatever they have on hand.  These guys know food!
As a few other reviewers mentioned- they are culinary artists!  
You will not soon forget your meal."

Anyway.. I tried their roasted vegetable sandwich on ciabatta with monchego cheese, couscous side and fresh salad (it was all included- for under $9 I&#39;m not lyin&#39;!)
  It was Absolutely DELICIOUS.  
I adored the food, the atmosphere, and Mickey.  He&#39;s fantastic.

Their service is slow as compared to a regular establishment but this is no ordinary place, it is extraordinary and if you go expecting normal you will be dissapointed.  Go expecting great food and delivered in a not so normal fashion in the best way possible.  Follow them on Facebook would be my recommendation so you can opt in on any daily soups and stuff.

They had things under control the whole time and served wonderful dish after wonderful dish.  Mickey and Roberto had a great handle on what we needed.  We gave them a general idea of what we had in mind and what we liked and they worked with us to create an eclectic menu.  We did 5 diferent types of grilled pizzas and 5 different varieties of tasting spoons.  People were raving all night (and the next day) about the food.  Many said it was the best pizzas they had ever tasted.  Smokey Tomato is very creative and uses only fresh, in season flavors so everything popped really well.  They used figs, goat cheese, proscuito, fresh corn off the cob, pulled pork, polenta, chicken, apple cider slaw, avocado, herbs galore, mushrooms, amongst what seemed to be a million other ingredients.  The homemade ginger mint lemonade was a hit - especially when spiked with tequilla :)

The table was at such a slant, we had to set our water glasses on the ground to avoid water falling off the table. At the end of the meal, we got our check and were charged $18 each, not the $15 promised in the email. When we questioned the bill, we were told the extra $3 was for the lemonade. We did not order lemonade, but they did bring it to us, and it was included in the list if items promised for $15 in the email. The check was changed to the $15 promised, but when we handed 2 credit cards and asked to split the check, which they apparently don&#39;t do.

The patio is dog friendly. 
We just had some beer, and did not order any food, so no review of that. 
The river is fun to watch, although we saw a 4-5 ft watersnake swim by, not so fun, along with carp, bass, and a number of kayak ers.

That being said, I understand everything that goes on behind the scenes and usually give restaurants and servers the benefit of the doubt if my service wasn&#39;t great.

My friends and I went to peanuts yesterday on a slow Saturday night (I know it was slow because I had just gotten off work early as it was slow there too) and from the moment we walked up to the door, this place had one of the worst attitudes and vibes I&#39;ve seen in awhile.

We asked the guy at the door checking id&#39;s if there was space on the patio. He replied &#34;no. You can stand and drink...like you would at home&#34;. Ummmm okay?! Clearly you don&#39;t want us here..
Got a drink at the first bar then headed outside where there were plenty of tables open. One guy brought us a late night menu then told us he&#39;d get our server for us. No one ever showed up and by the time we asked someone to order food, I guess the kitchen was closed. 
I&#39;m not writing this review based on the door man or the poor service. I gave this place one star because of the manager. I made sure that peanuts closed at 2am because we got there a little later and I know naperville businesses lock their doors one hour earlier than posted closing times. At 1:07am I heard the manager telling the staff that it was last call. I&#39;ve never seen a place go any earlier than half an hour of closing time for their last calls. My friends and I got our last drink and sat outside continuing to talk and finish our drinks
At 1:40am we heard this guy barking at us &#34;okay guys finish your drinks and go home. Go to work tomorrow. Finish them&#34; we looked at the clock confused as he continued to be SOOOOOO rude to us. We all had three drinks and we&#39;re in no way being rowdy so why would you treat paying customers that way? This guy was also grabbing the bartender and just over all being a greasy slime ball. I will never go to this place again because they have absolutely no respect or desire for customers. Sorry this was so long but it honestly baffles me how a manager would think that behavior is acceptable. I sometimes stay an hour past closing time for my tables."

When the bartender found out one person was under 21 she stated rudely that &#34;she would have to keep an eye on us, just to make sure.&#34; We didn&#39;t even intend on drinking, only came in for lunch. First time there and I won&#39;t be back. I understand being careful with who you serve, but don&#39;t make diners feel like criminals when your dining room is empty. If you only want patrons above 21; put a sign up and we won&#39;t waste our time, or yours. Bar Louie across the street was a much better choice anyway."

I went on a week night so it was pretty chill. They have a decent beer selection and some pretty good week night drink specials. The service was okay but the staff wasn&#39;t particularly friendly.

It&#39;s a little hole in the wall, but not exactly what I&#39;d consider a dive bar.  For one, it&#39;s pretty small, the actual bar is small as well as the space.  I guess I&#39;ll have to come back in nicer weather when I can check out this patio as I&#39;ve heard better things about that.

This was the last of several bars I tried St Patrick&#39;s Day weekend and it wasn&#39;t a place I loved or anything...in fact I decided to end my night after hanging in there a bit.   It was big crowded, for one. The service was fine, it just didn&#39;t do much for me."

I haven&#39;t had a chance to check out the patio, but it&#39;s not a bad spot for a bar crawl or a quick drink.  There is no drink menu, but there is a full bar and at least one cheap beer special.  There isn&#39;t a lot of seating, so I wouldn&#39;t recommend this for large groups.

But there is nothing unique about Peanuts.  It&#39;s laid back (so no pulsating, obnoxious DJ competing with the TVs) but other than a bar crawl, and the one time I came here with co-workers, I can&#39;t think of an appropriate occasion for this place.  They have TVs, and even though I don&#39;t care about sports, I can definitely say that a game can be better viewed elsewhere.  I really prefer Jackson Ave Pub over the other casual bars in the area, because their food and drink options are better.

I&#39;d pass on Peanuts in colder weather and wait until the patio opens up.  They need some kind of kitsch here like a signature drink or inventive food menu."

They wear what they want to, which I&#39;m really not a fan of at restaurants no matter how casual, and most of them have poor attitudes. But I do enjoy Peanuts. I love their patio on the Riverwalk, they have great drink specials every day of the week, and they have an awesome menu. Unlike Jimmy&#39;s across the street (I hate Jimmy&#39;s so much), their menu actually consists of real bar food: wings, nachos, potato skins, bosco sticks (sooo awesome!!), sandwiches, pizza, etc....The stuff people actually like to eat when throwin back some beers, not hummus, fruit, and deviled eggs. So take some notes, Jimmy. They also have great prices! Appetizers ranging anywhere from $5 to $12 bucks and entrees from $10 to $15.

I ordered the nachos and they were outstanding. They came with all the toppings nachos should have like chili, cheese, jalapenos, tomatoes, black olives, onion, guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gallo. They were on point! A friend of ours ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza. It was thin crust, just the right amount of cheese and sauce, and was the perfect size for an individual portion. He was able to finish it no problem. The waitresses did annoy me, but despite the fact that they were not friendly, they got our order right, they stayed on top of refills, and they continued to clear off our table as needed.

Peanuts is definitely one of the better bars in Naperville. I will be back soon!"

What is its big appeal?

OLD PEANUTS: Never crowded, could always get a drink (like shots or PBR). But That&#39;s about it. There was nowhere to sit in the back patio, except for a few chairs/tables. It had a great deal of potential, but it clearly was one of those places with regulars and served as a pit stop for people looking to do a shot or two.

NEW PEANUTS: Always crowded. ALWAYS crowded. But they have a sweet patio out back! And they actually give you MENUS now! There&#39;s food and drink specials, and theres even a bar out back! Why the change? Don&#39;t answer that question, Peanuts, it&#39;s definitely bringing you some business at a low expense. They just added a few plastic patio table sets, some umbrellas, and set up a bar, and VOILA! This place is your standard, happenin&#39; Naperville bar now, with corn hole sets and all. 

I feel like I needed to note the new and old Peanuts, because there could be a varying level of reviews here. I have never ordered food here, I&#39;ve just gotten very drunk here. The service is usually good, and the drinks are cheeeeeap. You can get a tallboy of beer for a few bucks (don&#39;t look for anything craft, though...it&#39;s all swil). If you want to sit outside and enjoy some drinks and you abhor Jimmy&#39;s as much as I do, then head here."

Otherwise, it&#39;s a plain old sports bar with BAD food. I ordered a grilled cheese, and it was literally made with wonderbread and those kraft single cheese sheets. I mean, I hated those when I was little, let alone as an adult. Sick. I realize it&#39;s a bar, but I stand by my belief that a bar shouldn&#39;t have a menu if everything on it is awful. And the waitress, though nice, was a total space cadet.

I honestly, have passed this bar so many times, and was more surprised by it when I finally went in. It&#39;s one of those--don&#39;t blink otherwise you&#39;ll miss it, unless you&#39;re looking specifically for this or are on a bar-hop.

Low maintenance is the key word. A bar like Peanuts in Naperville is kind of a treat. I like the glitz, and the glamour like the next girl, but give me a beer on tap and a whole lot of whatever in the mix and we&#39;re even stevens.

Inside, is a standard local bar with service a go-go. The staff is friendly and on top of their game. There&#39;s enough seating for any size of a group. Outside is a whole other ball game. There&#39;s plenty of seats, another bar, bags, flatscreens. Oh and did you know you can smoke outside?

For all you smokers--there &#39;ya go. Not that I smoke, but smokers are the fun crowd and this makes the bar feel like you&#39;re not at a bar, but hanging out in someone&#39;s backyard. With service.

I was approached by someone I didn&#39;t know who apparently knew my band from when I still lived there.

The prices here were pretty decent.  I was drinking bottled Old Style the entire time, which excited me.  Definitely a Chicago style bar if they have Old Style!

The music is not what I like, but the crowd was into it.  I spent a bit of time on the dance floor and met a very interesting woman who thought  I would know an album released in 1982.  &#34;I&#39;m 23.&#34;  &#34;Oh, I&#39;m 30.&#34; &#34;that&#39;s nice, goodbye.&#34;

In other parts of the bar, the music wasn&#39;t as loud and facilitated easy talking over beers.  And the outdoor patio was just amazing.  Sitting out there drinking Old Style and smoking was a good time at this place.

The salsa was perfection. Not too hot but not too bland. My friend ordered their BBQ Chicken Sandwich with fries while I ordered their Chicken Kabobs that came with a small Greek salad &amp; fries with olive oil and feta cheese on top.

The drinks were comparable to just about everywhere else of similar description, but the people it attracts are far nicer than just about everywhere else downtown Naperville. It wasn&#39;t full of a bunch of pretentious snobs or over-tanned rich kids either like many other of the downtown Naperville bars. The food was good-typical but quality comfort style bar food.

There is little that distinguishes it from elsewhere. I mean, 3.50 Miller Lites can be found elsewhere in downtown Naperville. The location is what helps this business stays afloat in the warmer months by having an outside patio that overlooks the river. The drawback about that, patrons out there can not have peanuts out there due to the wildlife that is present. 

Anne works hard to keep everyone lubed up. She does a good job, albeit that I dislike this place.

In other words, if they quiet down, this could be a nice, great, homely, hang out with my friends sort of place.  But instead, it turns out to be a rather small, way too loud place to have one drink (if you can handle the noise) before going out in what is lame as an f-ing suburb."

This is a good bar if you want to relax and make conversation with your friends over a few good pints.

This place is kinda &#34;hidden&#34; from the rest of the popular places in Naperville, even though it is on Chicago Ave like many others.  Smaller bar, smaller sign.  People may look away at first because right next door (and sharing a porch with Peanuts) is an ice cream parlor that&#39;s open pretty late, teens and tweens hang out here right in front of the bar.

My favorite part of the bar is the JUKE.  Good stuff, lots of classic rock.

Every night they have specials, everything from cheap beefs to burgers, pizza on fridays (AWESOME one-person pizza, fits on a plate, nice and crispy crust) to bloodys on Sunday.

They usually have live music 1-2/week and for the days that they don&#39;t they have a great jukebox full of classic rock or the bartenders will hook up their ipods to the sound system--or yours if you ask nicely and have good taste.  

The owner, who often watches the door, is unbelievably good about taking care of his customers and really watches to make sure that some of the regulars (not regulars in a good way) don&#39;t harass any girls which really makes coming here a welcoming experience.  I never hesitate to stop into Peanuts whenever I&#39;m visiting friends in town."

There really isn&#39;t much to this bar.  Its pretty tight fit in the front with a few tables a small bar and a corner for live music on occasion.  And out back their is a real nice patio on the DuPage River.  the back patio and the local feel make this place a 4 star in my mind.  And of course free PEANUTS!!!   Overall it&#39;s a great place to chill out with some friends and have a few beers.

What a fun blast from the past this downtown diner is, and yummy breakfast to boot! My friends and I stopped in for breakfast one morning and noticed the menu was fairly standard. My friend ordered a Canadian plate that was disappointing as they were out of everything he tried to order with it. I had a Mexican chorizo breakfast plate and aside from it being a little too spicy (with tons of jalapeños) for my liking, it did pack a flavor punch. The pancakes were perfect though, hands down the highlight! If ever in Oswego again, I&#39;d stop in again."

Even so, we were seated in less than ten minutes. The waitress was prompt and friendly, taking our drink orders immediately. She came back a few minutes later and I ordered the Canadian platter (Canadian bacon and peppers and onions cooked into the hash browns). 

The waitress brought the meals out to our group and apologized to me because they were out of Canadian bacon. She offered ham, bacon, or sausage. I chose ham and began to eat. She came back and told me they were out of ham. I went with bacon this time. It came out a few minutes later, cooked to perfection. At that point, I realized there were no onions or peppers in the hash browns. Hungry and exasperated, I just finished my meal. I will say that the pancakes were fabulous, however. The rest of our party enjoyed their meals, but weren&#39;t particularly blown away by anything. Average, hearty diner fare.

My most recent experience here was, sadly, my least favorite. If it had been my only experience, I&#39;d have probably gone with two stars, but previous experiences even things out. I&#39;ll be honest and say I&#39;ll likely return."

You cannot go wrong with breakfast or lunch anything. The prices are so reasonable you will think you are in Mayberry circa 1961.  My husband loves biscuit and gravy.  I don&#39;t, I call that dish prison food but he says this place has some the best he&#39;s ever had.  They have a Friday Fish fry here that will rival any Wisconsin Fish Fry.  Perch you ask?  Yep!  For breakfast I usually get eggs benny and the eggs are always perfect.  You can customize your hashbrowns so if you like them extra crispy, just nicely ask for them that way.

This is clearly a place for locals to meet and greet. Everyone in the restaurant seemed to know each other and if you weren&#39;t &#34;in&#34; then you were given strange looks. We had to wait for a table and everyone in the place was staring at us...very awkward.

We didn&#39;t realize it was cash only...there are no signs...again, it must be a local place where &#34;everyone knows&#34;. Luckily I had some cash on me, but that is a rare occurrence for most people these days, I highly suggest some signage.

The food was nothing great. It was breakfast food, nothing on the menu was unique or special. The service was alright...not bad, not great.

And they do not say so anywhere on the door, inside or on their menu.  Any place that does not accept debit cards is a serious rudeness in this day and age in the US.  I want to boycott them just because of this.  I&#39;m still extremely angry that we got surprised by it only at the end and then had to walk a couple blocks to an ATM.  This is a ridiculous and archaic policy of theirs and I wonder why the owner chooses to operate in this backward business model, unless it is for some tax advantage?
Having given it a FIVE STARS, however, it is obvious that I am stuck to going back there again and again.  They put an aphrodisiac in the hash browns or something. My Skillet Special was perfect in every way, the gravy was neither too heavy, greasy or salty.  The Canadian bacon?  It was thick, as in I&#39;ve never seen it so thick, and there wasn&#39;t a gristly piece or dry piece on it.  Eggs, perfect, service outstanding! Atmosphere very pleasant.
I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ll get over my debit card/cash issues the next time I want the perfectly made breakfast.  Zero complaints.  My wife, who is a notorious complainer (bless her heart.  She is NEVER happy with anybody or anything) LOVED this place.  She did not have one bad thing to say about her eggs Benedict.  Best hollandaise she&#39;s ever had and she raved about the Canadian bacon.

I&#39;m especially partial to their breakfast food, which is just about the only time I&#39;ve gone there - weekend mornings. I can vouch for their omelets, specifically their mushroom, cheese and spinach offerings.  I have it on good authority that the sausage skillet is also very good.  You can&#39;t go wrong with the food.  The service is attentive and they work very hard to keep up.  There just simply isn&#39;t enough of them to go around during the peak weekend morning time frame. 

About the only issue I have with the place is its size.  Tables and aisles are too close together. On weekend mornings, it feels as if the entire town of Oswego is trying to have breakfast there at the same time.  There is always a wait to get a table during that time and depending when you arrive, it could be lengthy (20 minutes or more).  I suppose it&#39;s a nice problem to have if you&#39;re the owner of OFR but you have to wonder how much more business the place would do if it were a little larger.

It is also a cash only business so bring greenbacks as they don&#39;t accept credit or debit cards.  Prices are VERY reasonable.  It&#39;s a great addition to Oswego and it&#39;s definitely worth the drive  - and the wait."

It was one of the worst breakfast meals I&#39;ve had in years. The bacon was almost black, the sausage links had a strange color and flavor, my scrambled eggs looked more like an omelet, and my french toast was bland. You get what you pay for! Speaking of paying, it&#39;s cash only. I didn&#39;t even know cash-only places existed anymore! There is no sign posted anywhere, so we had to go to an ATM. Only reason I gave 2 stars is because the staff was friendly."

Ok i am going to say this, but i mean it 100% in a complementary manor.  You know when you see an IHOP or Denny s commercial and you think to yourself &#34;WOW that look SOOOO GOOD!&#34;  Then you make the mistake of going and what you get looks nothing like the commercial and tastes less then mediocre.  Well this place serves breakfast that looks like TV commercials and adds.

The corned beef hash is fresh corned beef and not canned...that is always a relief for me because i consider myself a corned beed hash connoisseur.  

The menu is very traditional so don&#39;t expect anything unusual here.  Traditional farmer breakfast, nothing fancy here.  Good old fashioned breakfast."

There&#39;s always a weird funky smell in the place kind of like old grease.  I&#39;ve always heard never to order specials in restaurants because that&#39;s usually old food the kitchen staff needs to use up.  They were right.  I ordered the sirloin steak special medium rare and it came out well done.  The steak also tasted funky like it was old and starting to spoil.  Frozen vegetables....not impressed with that......overdone to complete mush.  I said I didn&#39;t want any butter and sour cream on my potato and it came out with both.  My wife also asked for no pickles on her sandwich and it came with pickles.  I wanted soup of the day to go and the waitress forgot to give it to me.  And lastly it took forever to get our bill and it was slow as hell that night.  I will not be returning.  It&#39;s so frustrating spending hard earned dollars on food that tastes like garbage.  I could have cooked a better steak dinner at home for half the price.  This place deserves to go out of business.

I had the fried shrimp dinner and there were 8 butterflied shrimp with a light crispy breading, quite the large serving with fresh steamed carrots and broccoli and a baked potato that was baked to perfection!  I am going back one of these Mondays for a half price burger, advertised in the menu as 12 OZ!!! I thought the prices were very fair, even low for the portion sizes. Lots of salads too that I will have to try...

I had hesitated going here, because when it was Tommy O&#39;s it was nasty. But a friend went and said the food was good, and I am glad I listened. We will put it on our &#34;don&#39;t feel like cooking go-to list&#34;..."

Sat at the bar on a friday with a buddy and had a few good beers. All was good until a kid started cleaning a cooler directly in front of us. Now that both of us are management in the industry, we sit back and watch the brown slim coming off of the one towel he was using. The manager cane over and talked to him and told him not to stop until he was finished.... Maybe doing this before the day starts would help.
The bartender came over and asked if we wanted food and after seeing what was taking place in front of us we said know. Her response was &#34;good&#34;.

As a part of the weekly trivia event, &#34;tasty prizes&#34; (shots) are awarded to teams who guess certain answers correctly. I can&#39;t drink alcohol, and each week the trivia host instructs the teams that if any of the prizes are not wanted, we can bring them to his table to share with his team. We gave the unwanted shots to the host, and were approached by a waitress a few minutes later who threatened to *ban us from the bar* if we were to ever do this again. Um... what?

We asked if she was aware that we were told to do this by their host, and she said that she was. &#34;Management, however, doesn&#39;t feel comfortable approaching the host and telling him he can&#39;t do this, so they&#39;re just telling the customers. The trivia staff drink for free and are paid to be here, so they don&#39;t need your shots.&#34;

The manager doesn&#39;t feel comfortable talking to his own contractor? So he instead wants to threaten to ban the customers? Brilliant. And if the staff drink for free, what in the world does it matter if they have my shot or order their own?

No problem. Weekly customers for years, and we won&#39;t be back to Oak Street. Though I do thank the bar for giving me a little &#34;street cred&#34; -- I&#39;ve never been threatened to be banned from a bar! :)  Ridiculous."

I found a review that told me this place had Karaoke on Thursday. I thought I would be smart and check. Many places cancel Karaoke and it still shows on the web sites. I called and asked about Karaoke. I was told that it would start at 9 PM. I showed up early and ordered my food. I asked again if Karaoke was tonight since there was no one setting up. I was once again reassured that it was Karaoke night. I ate and someone finally came in around 10 mins before 9 and started to set up. At 9:30 I was told by the bartender that it would start any minute. After 9:45 I paid my check and left. I noticed that the manager was playing slot machines so I didn&#39;t interrupt him and was angry the whole way home. I called and asked for the manager, I was told &#34;Who is this and why do you want the manager&#34; I found that very poor. I waited a few minutes,(my guess is for him to finish his game) told him my story and told me that the person that i spoke with was misinformed. I could have asked which one since i spoke to someone earlier and to my bartender that was there tonight. This is really sad because he clearly doesn&#39;t realize that no mater who was misinformed it is his fault for not properly educating his staff. I live 2 miles away and love to do Karaoke. I will never be back. Restaurant owners try things like Karaoke to increase their business and are surprised when it doesn&#39;t work. But the problem isn&#39;t Karaoke or the band, or $5 martini night that they try. it is simple, give good service, provide quality food, and do what you say you are going to do. it is service that brings people back. This place has no clue as to good service. 

I cant believe the manager didnt say please come back sometime, or tell me that they will do better. He just blamed his staff. What a loser!"

Not that it would take much, but what a huge improvement over Tommie O&#39;s.  Once we arrived and the front of the building was devoid of the street pharmacists that plagued Tommie O&#39;s, I knew Oak St. was already moving in the right direction. 

Casual, simple and bright are the first things that popped into my head.  The &#39;stone&#39; that now dominates the entire back wall looked nice and all the partitions and other crap was gutter to create a large open dining space separated by an open wall with a large bar area next to it. We arrived around 10 p.m. for a late dinner and joined a couple of other tables dining and a fairly large crowd at the bar. I would say the vast majority of folks were 20 -30&#39;s and were dressed as if Oak St. was pregame for some other late night spots.  Pleasantly surprised to find a young-ish crowd in North Aurora at somewhere not named The Turf Room. 

Good selection of beer and wines, I got a personal favorite Fat Tire and my companion got a Ecco Pinot Grigio.  We started with the buffalo shrimp appetizer which was a great start to the meal.  We followed that with her getting the french dip and I got the BBQ pulled pork.  Not only did we enjoy both our sandwiches but both meals came with a salad.  Apps, salad, sandwiches and two drinks each for under $40, wow. 

Our server was dead on all night.  The app, salads, entrees and drinks were like planes at O&#39;hare coming and going with perfect timing.  He was excellent and only made the experience that much more impressive.  He got well over 20%. 

Next time I will try a pricier entree and further explore their draft beers.  Great addition to the neighborhood."

I ordered the chopped steak dinner, it was great. My better half ordered the broasted chicken and it was far superior to the broasted chicken that used to be served when this location was Tommy O&#39;s!!! We will be going back for sure!!!!

The food and service has been consistently good. I usually get the turkey burger which has a delicious bun and flavorful pesto. This time I opted for the sweet potato fries, which didn&#39;t disappoint. However, I often get the truffle fries which are delicious and a definite step up from plain-ole fries. I realize that they are a brewing company, so they promote their own brews. But, I&#39;d like to see a listing of other brews offered. 

Finally, as a mom of two toddlers, I absolutely love their kids dinners. Not only do they offer a variety of meals, but they come with a little TOY!!! This is always a treat for the kids, is appreciated by me, and keeps them entertained during dinner."

It really left a good impression, so I agreed to leave an updated review after giving Emmett&#39;s one more try.

A friend and I went around 8pm on Friday evening. There were no sports games on at all (I thought this may affect the bar population), but the place was still packed 100% with people waiting in the over-crowded lobby area.  We waited about 20 minutes near the bar area as we saw some people were getting ready to head out and we preferred to sit on that side. A guy with his 4 friends in tow blasted right past us, looking for a seat.  When he saw it was fully packed, he proceeded to stand right in front of us.  When my friend finally got irritated and told him we were waiting, he gave us a crappy look (it&#39;s a &#34;first come/first serve&#34; seating arrangement).  He basically ignored her and kept walking around looking.  She elected to ask for the manager, as she felt that was rude and I can&#39;t say I disagree with that. She mentioned we were there with a credit, as we already had one bad experience.  He assured her this experience would be better.  We found a table, but pretty much had to run over and sit down before the other guy got there... so thanks but no thanks to the manager for his help (or lack thereof).  The guy even made a comment &#34;there&#39;s only TWO of you and MORE of us&#34; as we walked by.  Classy.  We got there at least a half hour before they did - but apparently that did not matter.

I like the atmosphere in the bar, it was a fun vibe and not so crowded that you feel closed in on top of one another.  The tables and chairs are the high top kind and wooden with higher backs on them. There were multiple TVs with different things on, but the music was on the speakers and it was a really nice variety of 80s, rap, a few older songs, etc.

Our waitress was nice.  I had the reuben sandwich, which was pretty darn good.  My friend had a turkey sandwich, it had bacon on it.  She liked it as well.  Also, the food was out in minutes.  We both went with the Octoberfest beer which was extremely good - I would absolutely recommend it.  However, once again... none of the beers were explained to us... and none of the specials offered.  I&#39;ve been to many breweries in my lifetime and I always have heard the specials or at least a recommendation or something.  We were given a menu and asked what we wanted. 

The service was good.  The atmosphere was not too loud, but not too quiet either.  We were offered a dessert menu this time, we had no idea it existed as the previous waiter didn&#39;t mention it.  They had a nice variety of creme brulee, ice cream, snickers pie, etc.  As badly as I wanted to get something, I was too full off just 1/2 of the sandwich and fries.

Overall, it was a decent experience... but once again... I wasn&#39;t so blown away that I&#39;m dying to go back.  In fact, I probably won&#39;t, to be honest.  The beer is good, the food is decent, but I still maintain that there are cheaper places with more convenient parking and at least 2 seats available that late at night.  Finally, if the manager had come back to check on us (knowing we were there specifically because we were given a credit to return once more AND were being bulldozed by a rude man and his posse), it probably would have made a giant difference to me.  I am so/so on this place.  Still just don&#39;t see what the hype is about."

I told the host that we had a dog and he said that we could sit on the patio. Shortly after reviewing the menus we were asked to leave because dogs were not allowed on the patio. Now, this dog is the most well behaved, quiet dog you would ever meet. Certainly did not cause any problems. Many of the people sitting around us loved the dog. 

We walked down the street to another bar and our dog was welcomed with a bowl of water and treats. I have lived in Downers Grove my whole life and anyone who has been there would agree, this is a family oriented, smaller town with a very warm welcoming culture. Dogs are family and to be asked to leave because of him is very disappointing. Shame on management for this antiquated rule in a family oriented culture."

My boyfriend and I decided to sit at the bar instead of in the dining room so we could better see their different drink options. The bartender, Elvin, attended to us immediately and took the effort to ask us what we normally like to drink so that he could make recommendations. We were lucky to have stopped in on such a good night for specials...all of their draft beers were only $3! We tried their stout, red ale, and pale ale...all were delicious! I also ordered their classic cosmopolitan, which was arguably one of the best I&#39;ve ever had.

Although we weren&#39;t incredibly hungry, we did share a few dishes. First, we had the walleye bites appetizer. The batter on the fish was light, flaky, and perfectly seasoned. They came with a sriracha aioli, which was incredible. After that, we split the brewer&#39;s chicken sandwich with a side of their house-made blue cheese &amp; bacon potato chips. The chicken was juicy and thinly sliced. It was topped with bacon, Swiss cheese, and a tasty pale ale mustard sauce and served on a pretzel bun (can&#39;t go wrong there). As much as I loved the sandwich, I think I loved the chips even more! They are served with a side of this magical creamy horseradish dip that I would literally put on every meal if I had access to a jar of it. 

To anyone debating about whether or not to try this place...go! I refuse to believe that the negative reviews are legitimate. If possible, go on a Tuesday evening when Elvin is bartending because he is the very best!"

I think it&#39;s a good idea as one side is more family oriented and the other is a friendly, fun atmosphere.  The service was pretty good, not spectacular.  It was also quite warm in there.  They had a wing special that was $0.50 with a dozen minimum.  They were good.  I especially liked the jerk sauce.  The spinach artichoke dip was good but nothing special.

I will continue to stop in from time to time for a cold pint, but I probably won&#39;t bother trying to order food. :("

And here was an unexpected great experience waiting for me in Emmett.
As I went in it was mostly empty with few people in dining and bar area.
I was received nicely at reception and seated comfortably in dine-in area.
Patrick was our the server on that day and he suggested to try German Kolsch as a cooler and refreshing beer for the hot afternoon.
As this was my first experience in a brewery so I ordered a beer paddler which is a combination of 5 beers (Munich Light German Lager, 1 AM English Ale, Emmett&#39;s Pale Ale, Emmett&#39;s Red Ale, Porters and Stouts). I personally loved German Lager which was crisp and refreshing.
For food I ordered Three Wings Sampler(one of each buffalo, Jamaican Jerk and red ale BBQ) and Emmett&#39;s Nachos with Emmett&#39;s Club Sandwich.

Emmett has a brewing factory next to its bar and you can see the big beer silos from the bar area. My friend and I enjoyed our beers and soon enough, our table was ready so we moved to the restaurant side for the rest of the night.

The bar is pretty spacious with lots of small tables with stools for you to sit and I believe you can order food here, too.

I was pretty psyched, since A.) I love a good pub burger, and B.) my husband&#39;s name is Emmett, so I was hoping to score some Emmett swag.

We arrived to the sound of live music and a pretty lively scene. Though there appeared to be quite a few parties going on in the private areas, we didn&#39;t have to wait too long for a table to become available (maybe 10 minutes or so). However, the live music was WAY too loud. I enjoy a band to liven up my dining experience as much as the next person, but it was so loud that we were not actually even able to talk to one another. We resorted to charades and miming in order to carry on our conversation, which was frustrating because we had met up with two friends that we hadn&#39;t seen in a while, and I had left my mime gear at home. We did complain to the waitress who seemed equally frustrated but unable to do anything about it. About 3/4 of the way through our experience we did get moved to another table and were finally able to chat, but by that point most of the evening was gone.

I didn&#39;t love the food, which was probably the biggest let down for me. I honestly expected to freak out based upon the ravings of my Emmett-fanboy coworker. However, when I have only eaten at a place a few times I feel that it is entirely possible that I just haven&#39;t found &#34;my&#34; dish there yet, so I&#39;m definitely willing to give it another try and update my review when I do. But so far, I&#39;m sitting at about a 2 star experience - I&#39;ve definitely had better, both for weekend-out ambiance and for pub burgers and brews.

Now I am older and more particular and while I&#39;m not much of a beer drinker, I&#39;m so happy I came back to try the food one more time.

I swung by here with my mom and hubs for lunch on Saturday and the place was nicely emptyish. I really liked that our server was still amazingly attentive even though we were one of maybe three tables he had. He was polite, courteous, paced our meal excellently, and didn&#39;t smother us. Hard to do, and done well!

The menu seems to be completely revamped! My eyes gravitated immediately to the fantastic small plates menu - specifically the bleu cheese and bacon potato chips. The menu said they were served with a horseradish dip that we sadly didn&#39;t get, but the chips were still deeeeelish and I coulda eaten a whole bowl of them. I&#39;m glad we shared amongst the table. Then I ordered a crock of the baked french onion soup, which was awesome, and my mom got their cheddar ale soup, which I sampled and also loved! It wasn&#39;t just cloyingly cheesy, but had well developed flavors and didn&#39;t feel insanely heavy.

For lunch I really wanted to get a salad, but then I noted the pork belly tacos, and I&#39;m a sucker for pork belly, so I ordered that. It wasn&#39;t my favorite - the other flavors on the taco were so strong I could barely tell there was pork belly on it - but it wasn&#39;t terrible. My husband got the sunrise burger and holy crrrrrrrap I wish I had gotten it - SO AMAZING and perfectly cooked and had BACON JAM on it. BACON JAM. What more do you need. 

After all that, my mom and I were stuffed but my husband pressed on and ordered the raspberry tiramisu, which looked completely beautiful and he adored.

It&#39;s a nice, cozy place and the bar area is well set up with TV&#39;s, high tops and plenty of bar stools.   We didn&#39;t have any drinks, so will likely update this review down the road when I do.

Good service overall and the food items were either very good, or in some instances, subpar.   The ale cheese soup was a hit, as were the soft pretzels, which came with a honey mustard sauce and horseradish cheese spread.   My wife&#39;s Reuben, son&#39;s shrimp boursin pasta, and dad&#39;s rigatoni pasta were well liked, as were the homemade chips.

Two of us ordered tacos-my ahi tuna ones were o.k.-the fish was good, and I like that they offered corn or flour tortillas (always corn for me!) but overall, they were dry-recalled reading about a chipotle or similar flavored sauce, which wasn&#39;t there.  My mom&#39;s steak tacos were a disaster-there was almost no edible meat present.  The server and manager were understanding and handled the situation well.

Chris, a former bartender for Emmett&#39;s, was very knowledgeable about the products, and interacted with everyone in a friendly, accessible way.

Reservations were made the same day without a problem. Parking in the area is a little tough &amp; their lot in the back is a tight fit but we made it right on time.

We arrived &amp; were greeted and seated right away. That&#39;s always a plus, right? Right. 

I noticed that the music and noise level from the bar side is something you cannot ignore while sitting down for dinner.. eh, I&#39;m not sure how I feel about this..

Moving on... I ordered a cucumber gimlet for a pre-dinner drink (it&#39;s pretty much a gin martini) which was good. Not too strong &amp; pretty much right on point. Yes, I know I was at a brewery BUT I had my eye set on the prime rib &amp; knew there was no room in my stomach for both! 
Soooo . . . I ordered the prime rib dinner special - cooked medium, baked potato &amp; split pea soup of the day. 
 
The split pea had good flavor but the chunks of ham were not what you&#39;re use to getting in split pea. I am pretty sure it was deli ham, which made me a little sad. Oh &amp; there were no croutons in the soup... Really?! What a let down! 

I ordered a glass of the Sycamore Lane Cabernet Sauvignon &amp; I think that was the best decision I had made about the meal.
When the prime rib came out, it was exceptionally pink &amp; I mean near rare. I seriously tried to eat it but ended up sending it back .. I just couldn&#39;t do it. When it came back from the kitchen, it wasn&#39;t rare or medium or medium well for that matter, it was almost well done. Needless to say, I ate more towards them middle &amp; set it to the side.

The Bleu cheese dressing was generic and tasteless. There were two pieces of fish on each plate. Not bad flavor but way too much batter. The cole slaw was not good - too much mayo. The waitress didn&#39;t offer more fish; my husband had to ask for another piece, thinking another batch might be better. The fries were good. 

We had water to drink and the bill was over $40. I doubt we&#39;ll be back to do anything but stop in at the bar. Disappointing."

I personally think their food is better than the beer.  The food fare is normal American cuisine and they don&#39;t overcharge for the food in my opinion.  It is well prepared and presented and the staff if courteous and polite.  The beer is &#39;eh&#39; in my opinion; I&#39;ve had a lot better.  Some of the prices of their beers also cause me to not drink when I go here.

Seating is a non-issue with their bar and plenty of tables.  The girls at the front are always nice when it comes to hospitality.  

I would like to see an improvement in the beer prices.  I think they are a little on the high side for what they are worth.  Overall; a fine establishment but they need to add a little bit to take it to the next level."

I never give a bad review on a singular experience, that sort of thing.

This was our second time there, the first was somewhat forgettable so we thought we&#39;d try it again. It was busy on a Friday night at about 8, but not crazy busy. We ordered drinks and food pretty quickly, and my first clue that our waitress was not very professional was when she wrote our food order on a cocktail napkin. No kidding-we waited 50 minutes for our dinners. Really? A salad and their all you can eat Fish Fry??? A couple of excuses from our waitress as table after table around us were seated, got their food, ate and left. Finally we asked for a manager and she said she would check on it real quick and after 5 or so minutes, out comes the food. The food wasn&#39;t bad but when it takes that long, really, who the heck cares?

The one that really got my husband is they seated a very large party near us so the chairs were right up against us, and the waitress at that table kept plowing into my husband with not word one of an apology. Inexcusable.

They tried to make it up by comping our meal, but we will NEVER return. EVER ever ever!!!!! It was exhausting being that upset over what should have been a nice date night..."

Tried a couple beers (German Altbier &amp; Roggenbier) that were pretty lackluster. Watered down, hard to drink even. Dinner house salad was LAME. Thin shreds of carrots, two slices of tomato, cucumber, onions, a handful of croutons, all topped some pieces of iceberg lettuce. No doubt the most unexciting, boring house salad I&#39;ve ever seen. The entree of BBQ Baby Back Ribs continued the mediocrity. Small ribs, very fatty, slathered in sauce completely erasing any flavor the pork may have had. I&#39;m sure they picked them up at Costco or Restaurant Depot. I expected more than generic for $25. Definitely reminded me why I dislike boiled pork baby backs. The accompanied &#34;loaded&#34; baked potato was the SADDEST thing I&#39;ve ever seen. Small, slightly cut down the middle, with only pinches of cheddar cheese and bacon bits attempting to grace the interior. I can honestly say, Emmett&#39;s served THE WORST baby back ribs, side salad, and loaded baked potato I&#39;ve ever eaten. If the food and drink weren&#39;t sad enough, our waitress (although friendly) seemed as clueless as the chef. For working in a brewhouse, she couldn&#39;t describe their beers. For serving steak and prime rib, she couldn&#39;t tell the difference between rare, medium-rare, medium, or overdone. It was easy to see that Emmett&#39;s is NOT the place to go for food; it&#39;s overpriced crap (ala Chef Ramsey). I&#39;d hasten to say it&#39;s not the place for beer either. In a time of gastropubs and independent, home-grown micro-breweries, this place falls to the wayside...next door to Applebee&#39;s and Chili&#39;s. WEAK!"

As I walked in, the hostess at the desk walked away... &#39;Soooo I&#39;m thinking I should seat myself??&#39; I thought. The place was starting to empty out. We chose a seat on the bar side- nice high top tables, a view of the brewing equipment, great music playing- and settled in. 

We waited. And waited.

I started to doubt the fact that we were supposed to seat ourselves. New to the place, I didn&#39;t know anything about the beers, and after 10 minutes, noticed an abandoned drink menu to look at. Finally a waiter appeared and got us waters. 

12 minutes later our friend arrived and the waiter appeared again and gave us helpful drink ideas. I had the 1am ale. It was decent, not super memorable though. It seemed like all of us had to work to finish our beers in the end. 

I was interested in trying one of their cocktails, but things ended up taking too long so we decided to take our business elsewhere. The beer prices were reasonable-- I think mine was 5.75 plus tax. 

I probably would try the place again, but it&#39;s not at the top of my list for the dg area."

We signed up for Emmett&#39;s annual Spring Brewmaster Dinner on April 18, a five-course menu chosen by the chef (not available on the regular menu), served with different varieties of Emmett&#39;s brews specially chosen to complement each course. After an on-the-house beer and a tour of the small but busy brewery by Brewmaster Rob Hunter, we enjoyed:

* An appetizer of thin slices of pan-seared duck breast (nice and rare) served with orange-cranberry chutney and a tabbouleh patty of roasted tomato quinoa topped with black-peppered goat cheese, paired with Emmett&#39;s Belgian Abbey Ale. Nice balance of sweet and smoky flavors.

* A lobster and arugula salad with slivered jicama, served with a hoppy Citra IPA to complement the tartness of the lemon thyme dressing.

* For a palate-cleanser, a scoop of sorbet flavored with Apple Pucker schnapps, garnished with a slice of green apple and a drizzle of caramel (could have used A LOT more caramel!) 

* An entrée of rosemary roasted lamb chops in a basil pesto demi glace, served with candied baby carrots and purple potato puree garnished with a leaf of fried basil, paired with a hearty, malty Dopplebock. (This was my first taste of purple potatoes. Yum. Gotta find me some of those in my grocery store.)

* A Chocolate Bananas Foster dessert of caramelized bananas and chocolate ice cream garnished with mint leaves on top of a slice of vanilla pound cake, washed down with a chocolatey Java Stout. (This dessert was a little heavy on the chocolate and a little light on the bananas, but no complaints from me since I&#39;m a chocolate lover.)

What I liked the most about this dinner, aside from the great cooking and beer choices, was that the portion sizes were just right. We left pleasantly satisfied, but not so overstuffed that we couldn&#39;t enjoy a few more after-dinner beers. The only thing keeping me from giving this dinner five stars was the price -- $60 per person. While this is not overly-expensive by any means, it&#39;s still $20 more than the beer pairing dinners we&#39;ve had at Tribes Alehouse in Mokena, with the same number of courses and much bigger portion sizes.

Since we also signed up for Emmett&#39;s Beer Club, however, which gives us a 10% discount on future Brewmaster Dinners (along with free lunches on your birthday and a special Beer Club mug every time you visit), it&#39;s not a bad deal at all!"

We are pretty laid back people that have both spent a very short time in serving so we know what it takes and what servers go through on a daily basis.  We are normally out for the night and never in a hurry.  That being said, we have not had slow service and the food is always been very good.  When things are busy we normally order a beer and tell the server to come back when they get a minute.  Good beer and good conversation makes time fly.  The beer selection is always changing as well as having their usual standard choices.  My wife and I had our rehearsal dinner there 8 years ago in their private room and that was also a well run evening.

I had the special of the day, pork chops with pineapple.  The pork chops were very good, nicely seasoned and cooked well.  The pineapple was grilled, but I could tell that it was freshly sliced and not out of a can.  The green beans were cooked nicely, not at all mushy.

I had the steak and black bean chili, which was flavorful, but not spicy hot.

My only complaint is that service was a bit slow.  Our server was very attentive, so I&#39;m thinking that the slow pace wasn&#39;t her fault, but rather the kitchen being a little slow, since all of the food was hot, when it arrived at the table.  Certainly, I was able to enjoy the dinner conversation, but it just seemed that it took a little long for our soups/salads and entrees to arrive.

I do plan to include Emmett&#39;s in our regular rotation of restaurants."

We started with the Emmett&#39;s Baked Pretzel Twists Horseradish Cheese Spread, Pale Ale Mustard for $8.99 and a couple cups of Cheddar Ale Soup w/ a Pretzel Twist for $3.50.  On their own their both great and together they&#39;re even better!  Very good starters!

Our friend ordered the Brewer&#39;s Chicken Sandwich w/ Swiss, Bacon, Pale Ale Mustard on a Toasted Pretzel Roll &amp; a side of Sweet Potato Fries for $9.99. She said it was a great tasting sammich and she schmeared on some of the mustard from the pretzels.  She also enjoyed the fries!  It was a pretty thick sammich which is a good deal for the price!

The boy ordered the Brewhouse Angus Burger 8oz burger, Brioche Bun for $9.99.  He asked for bacon on his burger and a side of their Truffle Fries.  This was an additional $2.25; however, for the price of the burger I think it was worth it.  The boy said that this was one of the better burgers he&#39;s had as it was well seasoned and very well cooked to his medium rare preference!

I ordered the all you can eat Beer Battered Cod w/ French Fries &amp; Emmett&#39;s Slaw $16.99.  What a perfect Friday night special!  It was a serious toss up between this and the Prime Rib, but for the extra order to take home I was all for the fish fry!  It was a little on the oily side.  However, the flavor was spot on and it was a good flavor!  

Our server, Dave, was great!  He had a really good sense of humor and kept up with his tables even when the bar got bomb all at once!  I would totally recommend that anyone hit this place up for a good night!"

I&#39;ve had great burgers, salads and sandwiches here plus you have the option of sweet potato fries, sweet!  On my last visit I had a special sandwich, Chicken Bruschetta, that was delicious.

I went on a Thursday night for dinner. The restaurant was decently busy, but there were seats open at the bar and that&#39;s where I sat. 

I ordered the blackened steak sandwich with truffle fries and one of the seasonal beers (Belgian Stout). The sandwich was downright awful. If there was any blackening seasoning, I could not taste it and the steak itself was borderline inedible. It was probably a 8oz cut and I would estimate that 3oz were fat and gristle. I could not bite through the sandwich and had to resort to eating it with a knife and fork and even then I had trouble cutting the &#34;steak&#34;. The beer was okay at best, not much going on with it. 

I would have sent the sandwich back and ordered something else, but I could not find the bartender or a server to talk to, with was a theme of the experience. Out of my time there I interacted with the bartender 3 times: 1) to order my food and beer 2) when my food arrived and 3) 10 min after I finished my beer and food and requested the check. Not once after I received my food did anyone check on me to see how everything was. 

I would give the experience 0 stars if I could, because that is truly what Emmett&#39;s deserves. Absolutely abysmal experience, I will probably not be returning."

The place was busy but not packed.  The food is so so in quality especially for the prices.  My husband ordered a large plate of beef nachos.  For a pub they should be embarrassed.  A generous pile of non cooked chips, with a scant amount of some type of liquid cheese substance , a scant dab of guacamole, and a few scattered bits of tomato and a scant amount of ground beef.  Definitely overpriced, and really not appetizing in any definition of nachos.  I ordered the walleye bites, they were good, tasty , generous portion for an appetizer not badly priced.  we also ordered a bowl of french onion soup, the portion was not a bowl size it was more a cup size, watery, fair tasting, overpriced.   We also had a cup of chili, average tasting, but not bad as an appetizer.   My 3 year old grandson ordered mac and cheese, and it literally states on the menu &#34;kraft&#34; macaroni and cheese, it was $6, very overpriced.   I had a pub burger, was tasty but a little undercooked, on a nice bun, minimal toppings:  a slice of tomato, onion and a piece of lettuce, $10.  We both drank water only since they only serve pepsi products other than the beer.  Total bill was almost $60. Our waitress was not friendly or even polite.  She did come and refill my husbands half empty water glass, but not my completely empty water glass.   For the money have had much better food and much better service. Not recommending."

But hockey hysteria aside, Emmett&#39;s is a great bar and restaurant.  They brew some good beer and their food is quite tasty.  I can recommend their truffle fries, pretzels, quesadillas, and burgers.  I wouldn&#39;t say its gastropub food nor dive bar food....

Although they brew their own beer, I had to go for the Lapinette, a local cider I&#39;d wanted to try. It was delicious. 

We started with nachos, which were very good with crispy chips, cheddar beer sauce and pico plus a solid lime-y guac. My compadres ordered a burger and a chicken sandwich and I had fish tacos. I liked that I was able to get one with fried cod and one with grilled ahi. I was offered my choice of side and had house-made potato chips.

My tacos were delicious and messy. The ahi was a little dry on its own but the toppings saved it. The cod was nice and crispy. The chips were good, solid though not exceptional.

Service was very good, prompt with refills and plenty of checking in, but not overbearing. 

This seems like a great place for a beer and a burger or a classy night out with a date or the fam. Glad to add it to the list of options."

The service was quick, though the servers seemed a little confused. Just a little confused as to who was bringing the food and who was picking up the check. It wasn&#39;t always our waitress. Sometimes it was another. And after we paid, our waitress asked if we had paid or not and who took our check. 
The bar area was pretty busy, so we ate in the dining room. We were seated at a gigantic booth. The two of us. It looked like it would be big enough for 4-6 people in reality.
Anyway, the food was good. I had tuna tacos &amp; Fred had a chicken &amp; bacon sandwich. They were good, but not our favorite. The tuna seemed like it was a little overdone.
So pretzels are trendy and we had them. Meh.
It seems like 75% of places that have pretzel sticks all use the same pretzel stick company. Same shape, some color, same taste. Going from restaurant to restaurant it seems as though it just depends on how long they were frozen and how long the frozen sticks were in the oven. Some places don&#39;t use frozen pretzels. This place does. It comes with a sweet mustard which was tasty and also a &#34;horseradish cheese spread&#34;. The cheese spread was very horseradish-y and it would&#39;ve required a knife to spread it on the pretzel. Not optimal for dipping.

Overall, not my favorite. So many places in the area, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d go back."

The place has lots of potential, but it just isn&#39;t reaching it. 3 of us adults went for dinner on a Sunday evening (it wasn&#39;t very crowded) and dinner took 2.5 hours. We all order soup or salad, which took about 25 minutes for one of us to get our French Onion soup. We then placed our order and one person ordered fish, the others order a chicken dish and a burger. After about 30 minutes (after we got our soup/salad) the waitress came out to tell us that our food was coming soon but they forgot to cook the fish. We finally got our mean about 10-15 minutes later but the burger and chicken dish were cold because they clearly had been cooked a long time ago and sat in the kitchen while they made the fish. The restaurant did a good job and offered us a complimentary dessert. We ordered a slice of carrot cake (huge slice) to split. The cake took about 20 minutes to bring out. Two people ordered coffee, and the de-caff coffee they were freshly brewing took another 20-25 minutes. 

In the end, the food was good (although much of it was cold) and the craft beers were also great. But the service made us question if it is worth going back. We were actually there testing the food to decide if we should hold a rehearsal dinner in their banquet space, but after the experience we had, we quickly took our business to another restaurant down the street."

I rarely write bad reviews, because I prefer to promote good places, not be snippy about so-so ones, but this was an outstanding exception.

Went to Downers Grove location for a special night out with my friend, and decided to try Emmett&#39;s because from the outside it looks a little fancier than Ballydoyle. The martini and potato were good. That is all. Horribly rude and oblivious wait staff.   We had three waiters blatantly ignore us for a good 10 minutes, and we finally flagged a staff person down, it took them another 10 minutes to find &#34;our&#34; waitress instead of asking if he could start us with drinks and then track her down!  Really??  Our waitress was unapologetic, rarely came to the table, and the smallish bar was only half full with a staff of FIVE!  I tried not to be the &#34;witchy&#34; patron, used my pleases and thank yous, but even my friend was like, &#34;It&#39;s like she&#39;s purposely ignoring us.&#34;

My martini and water were empty, so I had nothing to drink with my meal and I didn&#39;t want my expensive dinner to go cold.  I flagged her down to get water, since a different server brought us our food, and didn&#39;t ask us if we needed anything.  I waited, and waited.  I had to walk up to the Idle bartender (no one up there ordering drinks at that time) and immediately refilled my water.   After serving two other tables water, she came by and said, &#34;Oh, someone got your water?&#34;  By this point I got snippy and said, &#34;I went up to the bar and got it myself.&#34;  She said a flat toned sorry, shrugged her shoulders, and said, &#34;Want a martini?&#34; She ignored my friend, didn&#39;t ask us if there&#39;s anything else she could get us, just wanted me to buy another high priced martini after being treated like subhuman the whole dinner.

I got a &#34;queen&#34; prime rib, thinking I&#39;d treat myself.  It tasted like tough rump roast from a crock pot.  Prime rib is supposed to be cooked in seasoned juices, really tender, and this was gross and bland.  It&#39;s the Friday and Saturday special, so maybe it was dried out leftovers?  I only ate about 5 bites, and I felt sick later!  When we waved the waitress down for our check, instead of noticing I pretty much left a $20 prime rib on the plate, she asked, disinterested, &#34;want me to box that?&#34;. We even put our credit cards on the table at the end, to get out faster, and our waitress plopped the bill on the table and walked away, not even noticing our credit cards were sitting right beside the bill.   Won&#39;t be back, ever, thanks.  We should have eaten across the street at Ballydoyle where the food is reasonably priced, staff is friendly, and ambience is less pretentious."

The tuna steak used on the tacos is not only fresh, it&#39;s expertly prepared (cooked a bit more than seared, yet perfectly pink inside).  This place is a Pescetarian&#39;s delight!!   The only thing I would change is the white sauce on the tacos - I prefer a red, more salsa type.  But hey, to each his own.  

Also getting high marks are  the seafood appetizers (walleye bites &amp; seafood platter) - both exceed expectations for a brew pub.   

The one item on the menu that disappoints, the Mac &amp; Cheese entree - for a brew pub this should be much better.   Oh well, stick to the seafood and you won&#39;t go wrong here."

Let me start with the good, because I don&#39;t want to forget the good points. They have a parking lot out back in case you can not find street parking on Main. Their restrooms are pretty nicely maintained. And the overall interior of the bar/restaurant is clean and very comfortable. The hard wood and dark tile make this place very relaxing and probably a good after work hang out for the locals. 

Now, sadly, I have to let you know the crappy stuff. When we got here, I went right to the washroom. My fiance and his sister grabbed a high top table in the center of the bar area and planted themselves so we had a place to sit.

When I returned from the restroom, my fiance&#39;s sister had a beer in front of her and my fiance had a mixed drink in front of him with a bill sitting next to it. I asked, &#34;why is there a bill? Can I order a drink?&#34;  At no fault of ours, the extremely unpleasant cocktail server dropped the bill with his drink, did not ask if we wanted to run a tab or if anyone else may want to order a drink that is joining them. Right when I sat down at the table, this woman walked up to my fiance, lifted up the bill for his drink and slapped it back down on the table and said, and I quote: &#34;we can close that out now.&#34; WTF?!? Hello??? Do you not see me? Am I invisible?? 

Well, let me tell you. I ordered from the bar. Ran a tab with them and let them earn my tip. I was appalled by her behavior. Could not believe that she treated this in such a manner. My fiance, who rarely complains about anything, even was shocked. 

In no hurry to return."

The inside areas are large and inviting. Bar room might be a little bit dark. Who cares really? Outside is a small area with only a handful of tables.

It was a warm evening, so we opted to sit outside!  Service was adequate. We received our drinks in a timely manner.
The food order, was another discussion. First of all, we both ordered off the gluten-free menu. My friend ordered a salad and expected the croutons. She was disappointed when there were no croutons. Our server told us that you don&#39;t have gluten-free croutons. So why were croutons listed on the menu? Okay, now let&#39;s discuss my Rehberger. Have you ever tasted the gluten-free buns you&#39;re using? They are terrible!  Eating gluten-free, doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m desperate to eat anything! They were tasteless dry etc. etc.

Now for the meat,  if you&#39;re asked how you want your meat cooked. It would be nice if you got sort of close to the temperature you requested. I ordered my burger RAW, so that may be came medium rare. No such luck! It came well done. Very disappointing! I can&#39;t eat well done meat. So I sent it back! I thought that maybe I come back better?? Well this time it came back medium. ALL I can say is I was disappointed. I expected better from your restaurant"

They did let us park in the church though and street parking seemed ample (4 hr limit).
The food was good.  I believe they brew their own beer, which is always a cool thing.  They had a nice selection of fish chicken and beef.  Their sides were also delicious.  I would definitely go here for a meal sometime based on this."

I went here with a friend after work and got a very good heavy stout. While there, I learned that they had a $0.50 wing night on Wednesday. Given my positive initial experience, I had to come back.

We decided to come back to watch the NHL playoffs. The atmosphere was great: lots of TV&#39;s, friendly staff, and great food. On Wednesday, they have $0.50 wings as long as you buy a drink and buy 12 wings. They have daily $4 specials of their freshly brew that varies by the day. I got a McCarthy Red, which was fantastic and went well with the wings.

The wings (see photo) were as big as I&#39;ve gotten and they were very meaty. There was just enough sauce and the sauces were great: I got bourbon, a peanut sauce (I think), and hot sauce. Since I went with my buddies, I traded to get their BBQ sauce too, which was equally impressive. These are some of the best wings I&#39;ve had, which is saying a lot. $0.50 a piece is a great deal (although, you have to buy a drink).

The atmosphere was lovely. Lots of great TVs playing all sorts of games. During the course of the evening, we saw the Heat Boston game, our hockey game, the US vs Brazil soccer match, and the Sox and Cubs games. The atmosphere had some kids and many older adults, which allowed us to enjoy the game. All of us had a great time: great beer, great food, nice atmosphere. We will definitely be back!"

We moved to a table when friends joined us.  The waitress was friendly and fairly attentive.  The Walleye appetizer was very good - however - we got 4 small pieces for $11.99.  Way to pricey.  The burger and turkey burger were both tasty, but again way over priced.  Hard to believe there&#39;s a $.75 charge for grilled onions.

As the evening lengthened (we participated in a Wine and Canvas event), the temperature increased and the service declined (one server for a group of 25-30 people) though she tried to keep up. Being an Ale House, I suppose I shouldn&#39;t have ordered a Patron Margarita (though it WAS on the drink special list). It was awful (premix maybe?) And unsalted.

In the past I would have reviewed this as a 3 because the menu was just not overly interesting and their wait staff can be hit or miss.  

The new menu on the other hand is a great improvement.  Small plates, which aren&#39;t trying to be tapas, but just smaller servings of their normal meals at a reduced price are great.  I always felt the tendency to overeat there because I couldn&#39;t find what I wanted at the size I wanted.  Now instead of ordering appetizer of giant pretzel sticks you can get one with a soup or to add to a salad.  The small plate sandwiches are good too because they come with a small version of the fries too.  The dessert menu has also been changed around.  They still seem to be mostly huge desserts so if you don&#39;t want to leave feeling like you&#39;ve eaten your weeks&#39; worth of calories in one day, share it.  :-)

They are pretty accommodating and pretty forgiving about our game group if we have a bigger group than they expect and spread out a little further into the room due to the wall table being occupied.  

I can&#39;t touch on the beers but as far as ciders go there isn&#39;t too much of a selection.  Just Strongbow in bottles all the time and an occassional one on tap."

That&#39;s partly because there are so many places like this in the area, and because the food isn&#39;t really anything special. I do like the dining room, bar area and outdoor patio, and every time I have been here it has been very clean, which is a huge plus.

On our most recent visit, our party of five was seated quickly and all the staff, from the hostess to our waitress to the food runners, was extremely friendly. Our waitress aptly described the homemade beer selections and outline the drink specials of the day.

I tried samples of a couple of the house beers; they were OK. A red ale had a bitter finish, but the pilsner I ended up ordering was better. I know they&#39;re trying to sell their own beer, but I&#39;d like a larger selection of non-Emmett&#39;s beers on the menu just to balance things out.

A member of our group ordered the garlic and white truffle fries appetizer, and they were awesome -- crisp and flavorful without the garlic being overwhelming. I would definitely order these in the future.

My entree was the Firestarter Burger. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve obliterated my taste buds with spicy food over the years, but I didn&#39;t find this spicy at all, despite the roasted jalapenos and Sriracha mayo. Roasting the peppers took some of the bite off, and they really skimped on the mayo. The burger itself was decent, but not the kind that would keep you coming back. That being said, I was in the mood for a smaller meal I could finish in one sitting; the chicken sausage pasta, fish and chips, and sherried chicken breast were other dishes I was considering before settling on a burger that I knew I could finish at this meal.

Emmett&#39;s might be getting pressure from Ballydoyle and Another Round across the street, but their menu is a little more diverse. Ballydoyle is basically Irish pub food and Another Round is basically American Pub food (with amazing pizzas). Emmett&#39;s is a pub, but their menu is a bit more grown up, i.e. it&#39;s not all just dumped into a fryer and served to you a minute later. In that sense, Emmett&#39;s certainly has its niche and their service is better than the other two places put  together."

After what felt like a day-long road trip, we stayed for dinner. It&#39;s a nice place, although I was surprised to find the bar virtually empty at almost 7:00 pm. Do Downers Grovers not eat out on Wednesdays? The dining room was even more of a ghost town.

They have a nice beer selection, a few in-house brews as well as guest breweries. I had their 1 AM Ale; hoppy and a little sweet, and quite good. We split the blue crab stuffed mushrooms, which were really good. I hadn&#39;t expected to like them, because mushroom apps always seem to be overwhelmingly mushroom-y. These were not, and all of the flavors were distinctive. I had the Kobe burger, and hubs had the fish &amp; chips, both with the homemade chips. My burger was perfectly cooked, very tasty, and the homemade chips were really good. Our waiter has a hoot, the service was great, and they even had the White Sox game on. Only 3 stars, you say?

Food options are limited for vegans. I got the truffle fries; they said the aioli was on the side but forgot to mention there was flakes of cheese on top. Thankfully it wasn&#39;t melted in so I picked it out and gave it to my non-vegan friend. Unfortunately I think a lot of the truffle oil went with the cheese, but there were still several addicting bites.

I&#39;ve been here a couple of times now (only in the bar area) and it has always been the same.  Pretty good beer, pretty good food, and pretty bad service.  First off, let&#39;s talk about the beers:  I have tried the Victory IPA (which is also sold in bottles at Binny&#39;s in Bloomingdale! Yahoo!) and it is really good.  I like super hopped up beers, so I wish it was even hoppier, but it&#39;ll do.  It has a good, strong malty backbone so the hops don&#39;t seem that bad.  Good bitterness overall.  I also tried the McCarthy Red Ale.  This one is more carmelly and toasty (because it&#39;s a red ale...duh), but still has a pretty good hop bite.  Last, I tried the Oatmeal Stout.  This stout is nice and dark with strong coffee notes and a nice creamy finish.  The food is good too- I&#39;ve tried the pretzel twists (YUM), the Cheddar Ale Soup (Cheese? That you can just slurp? AWESOME.) and the Firestarter burger (yes, you have to sing Prodigy when you get that...how can you not?).  The burger has come out overcooked a little each time, but it is still good because it&#39;s covered in Sriracha and bleu cheese (I add the bleu cheese as an extra. DO IT.), my two true food loves.  You HAVE to like spicy food to get this though...your lips will be on fire.  Thus the name.  Emmett&#39;s don&#39;t mess around.
Overall, I would go here again if it were closer, but since the service is so crappy most of the time, I will probably buy my beer at Binny&#39;s instead and call it a day."

Glad I did. 

Emmett&#39;s is more than just a pub. Half the place is indeed dedicated to the bar atmosphere: dimmer lighting, with smaller tables and, of course, the bar to belly up to, as well as the brewing equipment in the window. The other half of the building, however, is a restaurant proper: brighter lighting, larger tables, and table service. The room is a mix of sophistication (with cocoa-colored walls, curlicued chandeliers and dark wood accents) and rough-hewn accents, such as the unfinished ceiling beams. 

There wasn&#39;t anyone at the hostess stand so I hovered for a few minutes, not sure if it was a seat-yourself situation, but one of the waitresses came and took care of me after a moment. My waiter was a nice fellow, and I quickly figured out what I wanted: the first thing on the menu, Baked Pretzle Twists brushed with garlic butter and served with cheddar cheese spread, as well as a cup of corn chowder, and a root beer. 

The root beer arrived first, as drinks do; I kinda figured it might be home brewed, as it often is at these brewery places (Goose Island, Gordon Biersch, etc.), but if so there wasn&#39;t a lot of pomp and circumstance about it, and it wasn&#39;t mentioned on the menu. In any case, it was rather flat and also tasted rather sweet. So I hope it wasn&#39;t representative of their own product. 

The food was much better. The chowder was happily hot (oh how I hate to get a bowl of soup in a restaurant that is pathetically tepid!), and had the taste of fresh corn, the bracing flavor of peppers and the smoky essence of ham. 

The pretzles were nothing like your shopping-mall-Auntie-Whoever concoctions. Tightly twisted and burnished brown, they bore the kiss of garlic and salt. There was no need for the cheddar spread. Carboholics unite: this was a fabulous feast, though $9 seems a bit steep for 4 pieces of bread. 

Overall, good food in a nice setting; would be a suitable place to bring the beer connoisseur in your life."

I&#39;ve given this place numerous chances (I live in Downers Grove) and I always leave disappointed.  Let me say it&#39;s a very nice location, with good service.  The beer selection is &#34;OK&#34;....their brewed beer is alright, nothing spectacular.  They don&#39;t have a very big selection of total beers though.   

My biggest complaint is their food....it&#39;s really bland and average at best.  I&#39;ve tried a lot of their dishes (pork sandwich, meatloaf, baked mac and cheese, burgers, pasta, cheddar soup, wiener schitzel) and all have been average at best.  I don&#39;t think they use very good ingredients.  I recently had their 3 tenderloin medallions with different sauces.  The beef was just awful....really bland and almost cafeteria-like.  Is this low-med grade Sysco food?  I  felt ripped off leaving there.

For the record, I want to see successful dining in downtown Downers.  We certainly have the Italian food market covered, and the brewpubs, although Ballydoyle does much better pub grub than Emmetts.  I was hoping Emmetts would evolve into some classic American dining place, offering steaks, chops, etc....but it never happened."

If you read the menu it all sounds great. The only explanation I have is that they spent their money on a great writer instead of a great cook. most of what we had tasted like it was cooked in a microwave. Fries overcooked and dry. I will not be eating here again.
Drinks - this is their savior. The fresh brewed beer is great, with some very traditional twists. HOWEVER, I am a part of their MUG CLUB and they recently decreased the sizes of their large mugs to probably save money. 
Atmosphere - overall has a great look. Lots of classic wood among the large brewing containers. 
OVERALL - Downers has some great bars now and this poor quality food will not cut it anymore. Go for drinks and thats it."

Service was very slow and seemed frustrated. The restaurant was very loud. The soup came out at the same time as the entree. The pretzel appetizer was very good. The menu seemed pretty limited. We asked the server&#39;s opinion about two menu options and though I appreciated his honesty, it seemed strange that he said straight out that he didn&#39;t like the Maui burger and said he thought there were better entrees than the pork tenderloin (but didn&#39;t say which ones or make any suggestion). I got a chicken sandwich on pretzel bread and it was very good (great mustard sauce) but the chicken only took up half the roll which was strange with so much bread leftover. The chips are great. Overall I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the money for the frustrating service and options."

Emmett&#39;s was not at all busy, with plenty of empty tables to choose from. Score! Then again, the fun loving atmosphere was a little lacking because of the minimal people but the crowd was still a friendly one. 

We saw that they have a little brewery and got some of their house beers. Both were pretty good, mine a little more hoppy than I was expecting (made me crave rye bread) but it was still darn good. 

The staff was so very friendly and inviting, offering us a chance to taste any of the beers right off the bat. They had baseball on several tv&#39;s and one projection screen which my bf enjoyed (but would have enjoyed more had his team won). 

We checked out the appetizers and I was between the nachos and the homemade potato chips... I wish I would have gone with the nachos. I mean, the homemade chips were really good and came with a horseradish aioli but the nachos were only $1 more and looked sooo much better after we saw the other tables around us get them. Ah well. The homemade chips were also a bit pricey at $8- yikes! The nachos appeared to be worth all $9 though. 

Overall, we would go back again, get the nachos, enjoy the beer, and brings friends."

The beer selection was the same as the other locations. I was only planning to have lunch and a quick beer, so I went with the one that I knew I liked. The McCarthy Red was good as usual. My wife tried the seasonal which was a Beligian Wit. It had a nice citrus hint and the flavor went well with food.

I have found that the &#34;high end&#34; entrees at the other locations have been disappointing to me, so I decided to keep it on the simpler side. The salmon sandwich was pretty good. It had a nice grilled flavor and the fish was still moist. My wife had the spinach and strawberry salad, which she said was good.

The atmosphere in this Emmett&#39;s was similar to the other locations with lots of dark wood. The number of TV&#39;s was less than obnoxious also. It was about noon on a Friday of the July 4th weekend, so the place was pretty dead. This made for a nice quiet dining experience for our visit, but I don&#39;t know what it would be like on a busy Saturday night.

Overall this place is acceptable, but I am still underwhelmed by the beer selection. When considering the driving distance, I would have done better to go somewhere else."

I really wish that they were better because it is such a nice looking and pleasing facility. Why can&#39;t management put some more focus on their overall quality? Oh well.
Was there this past St. Patrick&#39;s day and was able to get a table in the bar area. This day the food was fabulous. You would hope that the corned beef would be top notch on St. Patty&#39;s and it was. Lean, thick sliced, tender and moist. Absolutely wonderful.

When I walked in, the bar area was all but empty.  When the bartender saw me she decided to ignore me and walked into the back instead.  Meanwhile, one of the waitresses said, &#34;someone will be right with you&#34;.  
The waitress actually came back and rung me up.  Meanwhile, one of the obvious bar regulars sat down next to me and immediately was waited on by the bartender.  &#34; Oh, how are you... so and so&#34;, she said.  All the bartender could say to me was, &#34;you&#39;ve got to pay&#34;.  &#34;Twice&#34;, I asked?  Well, appartently the waitress had not actually rung me up, so now there was additional aggravation and confusion.
Once I was rung up, I walked out and spoke to the waitress.  I told her I was thankful for taking care of me, but the reason I do not come here anymore is because the service sucks.  She apologized.
I can say that at Emmett&#39;s has at least one employee who cares.

Meanwhile, I attempted to contact Emmett&#39;s via email regarding what had happened, but of course, there&#39;s a problem and you are unable to send an email."

We have been to Emmett&#39;s twice in the past two months, once for appetizers and drinks and happy hour and once for dinner.

Both experiences were enjoyable, but I&#39;d have to say that happy hour experience was a little bit better than dinner.  During happy hour the bartender was more than happy to offer samples and suggestions to help us decide on a beer selection.  The staff was all friendly and the environment was warm and comfortable.

When we came back for dinner we both enjoyed our food and drinks but the service wasn&#39;t QUITE as good.  The restaurant was busier and things were a little rushed, but I guess that&#39;s expected at dinner time on Friday.

The only really downfall...I am a dessert-a-holic and nothing on the Emmett&#39;s dessert menu tempted my palette :(

I really enjoyed the unique veggies and the tang from the sun dried tomatoes! I wish there were a few more veggies since it was a tad imbalanced: mostly eggplant and sun dried tomatoes.

+ Verde - 4/5
The three cheeses really lent some great flavor..I just wish it had a teensy bit more. The heaping topping of peppery arugula was so fresh!

The pizzas cost about $10/ea. You can add a bunch of different toppings if you want. The pizzas have that authentic Italian taste to them. If you&#39;re looking for Chicago deep dish, go someplace else, but come here if you want flavor and quality."

They have great daily specials, my favorite is half off brick oven pizzas on Monday, you really can&#39;t beat it! And $4.99 Chicken Parmesan Sandwich Wednesdays.

4 Stragione is my favorite (and only one I&#39;ve had) - Ham, artichoke, mushroom and black olive...all my favorite toppings on one very affordable pizza! The sauce is savory and I like the little charred pieces on the crust, you can tell this is a fresh-made brick oven pizza and not just some slab of processed junk cooked on a conveyor belt. I always get extra cheese, though, because I like it nice and gooey and they just don&#39;t put enough cheese on for  MY taste.

The chicken parmesan sandwhich is really good too, there&#39;s really nothing on it except for the chicken breast, cheese and sauce, and yet it is far more filling than a sub from Subway and by far more tasty!

The only problem I have with Serino&#39;s is that they have all these other delicious things like cookies, salads, deli sides etc. all displayed temptingly near the checkout, so I&#39;m always tempted to buy more than I need...I&#39;m a real sucker for their peanut butter cup cookie. OMG it&#39;s so yummy and big!

This place is, by far, worth driving a little out of the way to pay about the SAME amount you would at a fast food place. You definitely get a more satisfying meal, that&#39;s for sure!

The parking lot is a bit scary, especially with the construction on Army Trail, but, again, worth it."

Prosciutto on pizza = yes please. I&#39;ve had a bunch of the different paninis and the normal sub sandwiches. Gotta get the Serino dressing.

I took a Friday off and decided to pop in for lunch. YUM! YUM! YUM! 

The place was packed. I grabbed the only open spot in the lot. I ordered the 9inch Italian and a garden salad to go. The sandwich was so delicious!!! The best I have had in years! The garden salad was HUGE! It was two servings for me. 

As I grabbed my food from the cashier to leave, I asked if they had packets of mayo. Instead of pointing me in the direction of where they were located, he ran over to the other side of the counter and reached over to one of the condiment bins for customers to help themselves and came back with some mayo. That was so nice of him!

It all started when he brought home a sandwich from Serino&#39;s along with a jar of giardinera.  The bread on the sandwich was nice and crusty, in the best possible way, with just the right amount of not-too-salty meats and some nice, soft cheese.  Who could be mad at that?  And then you throw in the giardinera...  I grew up watching my grandfather spoon giardinera on to everything and I would like to think it was this stuff from Serino&#39;s that he was using.  This is the best giardinera I&#39;ve ever had, to the point that I was eating it out of the jar with a spoon and using the leftover oil in a vinagrette.  Awesome stuff.  We repeated this and dined inside a week or so ago.  Friendly, quick service, and the bread was nice and soft and fresh.  I like that you can pick yourself up some sides from behind the counter or grab a bottle of pop or a fountain drink - self service with a fair amount of options and even some service.

So I was wrong - wrong to resist for so long and now I dream of Serino&#39;s on a daily basis.  Go there.  It is well worth the effort  in getting there."

I am willing to try it out again with all of the great reviews but it would have to improve quite alot.

I ordered one of the specials of the day which was a hot pastrami on rye. My first issue was that even though I enjoy a bit of fat on pretty much everything this needed to be trimmed more. When you bit into it and your teeth wont go all of the way through resulting in pulling most of the meat out in your first bite - no good in my book. Secondly it was on the small side portion wise. Other delis in the area pile it on and this is not one of the places. Looking past that the flavor was good and the bread was fresh.

The second sammie that we ordered was a panini that had tomatoes, fresh mozz, pesto, and some greens i think. It would have been great if it was warm enough to melt the cheese. If your gonna have a panini it at least needs to be heated long enough to melt some of the cheese.

Like I said I hope it was just a bad experience during a lunch rush hour because I wanted it to be good. The price was reasonable and the line moved quick. During lunch it was a bit of a problem to park but you can circle the building and eventually find one. Im gonna hit up a couple more delis and then head over here again. Wish me luck this time...if I can find a parking spot."

Their Italian deli is very good for the small space- they have another location in the Roselle area.

Good morning energy to get you thru a long day of work.  The Deli sandwiches are fresh and taste great also I usually get the american with hot peppers.  The employees are always nice and greet me like family even thou I just met them a few years ago.  If you have heartburn they have some real old school Italian Seltzer.  Kinda like Alka seltzer but without the additives.  Pick up a bottle and pour it into some ice cold water after your worst heartburn kicks in and you will thank me.   I still have yet to try the brickoven pizza I will try that next."

Growing up on the NW side, I used to pedal my bike to a little storefront sub shop at the corner of Belmont &amp; Central Pk.  Jimmy&#39;s had a small menu with maybe 7 or 8 sandwiches and the only &#34;sides&#34; were your choice of Jay&#39;s chips. But, man did Mr. Jimmy make the best subs around.  He used Gonnella French bread, the kind that Mom used to grab out of the tall barrels at the A&amp;P or The National.  You know it had that hard crust but tasted so good on the inside.  I loved the end pieces and would ask Mr or Mrs Jimmy if I could have the end piece.  They were always so nice to us little snot-noses as long as we behaved in their shop.
Mr &amp; Mrs Jimmy&#39;s really built a heckuva sub sandwich.  It&#39;s not like the corporate sub chains where you get precisely 3 slices of meat and two slices of cheese BUT you can have all of the iceberg lettuce you want!  And some of these chains brag about how they bake their own bread &#34;so many times a day&#34;.  Yeah, big deal, it still tastes like doughy fluff.  How boring...

OK, that&#39;s right, I&#39;m reviewing Serino&#39;s.  Sorry for the time warp.  We&#39;ve had subs from Serino&#39;s at least a half dozen times and we love &#39;em.  I&#39;ll drive past 2 Subway&#39;s and a Quizno&#39;s just to go to Serino&#39;s, they&#39;re that good.  Let&#39;s see, I&#39;ve had the Italian, American, Serino Special and Paesano.  You know, I can&#39;t say that I have a favorite.  I love them all.

Veggie friendly?  Serino&#39;s has you covered.  The Caprese (grilled eggplant, fresh mozzarella and tomatos) is fantastic!  They also have a &#34;Veggie&#34; which is mostly cheese.  My wife isn&#39;t a big meat lover and loves it when I surprise her with a Caprese for dinner.  I even like them especially with a glass of Pinot Noir. 

They have a nice little deli area where you can buy meats, cheeses and specialty salads.  I have bought the small containers of salads to go with our subs and have never been disappointed.

Here&#39;s a little tip when you want to cook up a quick pasta and red gravy for a fast meal.  Try Serino&#39;s Marinara or Meat Gravy that they have on the counter with a box of Barilla pasta.  Their pasta sauces are cooked right there by a lady that could be &#34;Mama Serino&#34; and are better than anything you can buy in the store. 

Geez, this was an awfully long review for a sub shop.  Sorry about that but I really like the place.  The only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars is they don&#39;t use that crispy, crunch Gonnella bread that I love.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s pretty good bread but just not quite Gonnella.  If they ever switched to that great bread, I think I would have to find me a Schwinn Stingray, put a baseball card in the spokes and travel back in time to 1971."

The food here is simply fantastic. When I worked out in this area, I would go to Serinos at least once or twice per week. My favorites were the Cajun Turkey, the Caprese, and the Tomato &amp; Mozz Salad. The adorable little old man taking the orders will greet you with a smile and will probably start to recognize you on your third or fourth trip to Serinos.

However, parking does suck during the lunch rush and you often have to do a few circles around the building before you find somone leaving. I would recommend going during off times... like 12:15 or 12:45 as opposed to 12 or 12:30.

All in all, Serinos is fabulous."

I saw the awesome Yelp reviews so decided to grab a few sandwiches at Serino. It&#39;s hidden behind a gas station and doesn&#39;t look special from the outside. When we walked in we were immediately greeted with smiling faces and made some quick menu selections (meatball panini &amp; Italian panini). We asked to sub the chips for a pasta salad &amp; although we later learned he was not supposed to, the young man agreed so we were delighted! The sandwiches were very tasty! I regret not getting some hot peppers on my Italian but it was still great. The sandwiches are a good size and I had trouble finishing mine. I wish I lived closer so I could frequent this place and try some of their other wraps/sandwiches and order some deli meat. I was shocked there were only a few people there considering how delicious our meal was (perhaps this is due to the construction immediately out front or the fact that it was 3pm)!"

This place gets pretty busy around lunch time and sometimes parking can be a pain, but it&#39;s worth it. 
 The staff that works here is always very friendly and enthusiastic about their business. You can tell it&#39;s a family run place and you will see a lot of the same faces if you eat here often enough. After years of driving past Serino&#39;s wondering how it was, I finally visited a few years ago and they haven&#39;t been able to keep me away since.

I love that you can buy little antipasto&#39;s for about a buck!  You can also get mini tiramisu (which I skipped today but will try next time) and the deli area is packed full of awesome homemade sopressata, capicolla and salami!  Just wonderful!  I can&#39;t wait to go back!

Because the French fries at Shrimpy&#39;s are pretty close: cut in long, perfect blocks from fresh potatoes, steamed, slightly dehydrated in a low-temperature oven and then finally boiled in a bath of beef suet and peanut oil until they are tawny and crisp.

You may be familiar with the process of French fry triage, in which you eat what appears to be the crunchiest fry on a plate at the Apple Pan or somewhere, then the next crunchiest and so on, until you are left with the pale, mealy also-rans that you hate yourself for eating. The fries at Shrimpy&#39;s are all the best one on the plate, crisp, slightly hollow and a bit creamy inside, straight and uniformly hot -- a kind of perfection that can take a minute for the mind to process. Fries aren&#39;t meant to be this good, or at least not this consistent.

The herb-frosted New Orleans style shrimp that the fries come with isn&#39;t supposed to ease itself under your teeth quite the way it does -- outsourced shrimp is usually chewy and dry. You don&#39;t really need the tartar sauce, but damned if you are going to let it go to waste, so you essentially self-baste with the stuff and promise yourself that you&#39;ll spend an extra half-hour at the gym tomorrow morning.

If you are a restaurant-goer of a certain age in Naperville, you certaintly already have feelings about Shrimpy&#39;s, whether you&#39;ve been there or not. The restaurant occupies the building formerly occupied by the beloved Long John Silvers. Its Catalina-tile fountain was moved out into the area in front of the restaurant, old-school creole jazz blares from the sound system and an oyster bar sits where the bakery counter used to be. Josh Schweitzer&#39;s iconic blocky lintels have been blown out in favor of sheer open space -- the former apartment court, which Charlie Chaplin built for his child bride in 1929, now resembles a soaring medieval banquet hall, dominated by wooden booths that stretch the length of the open kitchen. Prime-time reservations are exceptionally hard to snag.

The chef, whose polished, modern cooking you may remember from Bastide and Church &amp; State, and maybe Patina before that, is one of the few people in Chicago capable of orchestrating a proper New Orleans tasting menu and commanding multiple Michelin stars. More than one of his followers assumed that Shrimpy&#39;s was going to mark the chef&#39;s return to the haute cuisine game after his detours into bistro cooking, the abstracted tacos at Petty Cash and the informal cafes in the Philippines. Fine dining, as opposed to cooking that includes sea urchin in the guacamole, is a neglected art in Chicago at the moment.

Shrimpy&#39;s signature, if you can call it that, is the elevation of familiar dishes through mastery of detail. Cajun shrimp, lightly fried in rice bran oil, are tucked between the petals of a nicely folded napkin flower, a presentation both attractive and practical. &#34;Fried Catfish&#34; turns out to be a paper cone of the feather-light chicharrones served with diced raw Tasmanian sea trout on a smear of drained yogurt with cucumber and mint, like a Mexican/Japanese/Lebanese take on surf &#39;n&#39; turf.

You do find a lot of big-flavored bistro tropes here, including fried , Raclette-drenched Alsatian tarte flambé scattered with a handful of chewy bacon, and tiny crocks of snails drenched in garlic butt. It is all fantastic.

Will Shrimpy&#39;s remain populist and delicious? At this point, we can only pray it does."

And because I was never a huge fan of LJS, I never managed to stop into Shrimpy&#39;s until today, when my mom and I wanted something a little different before our trip to the mall.

But LJS never had scallops, dungeness crab, crab cakes, crawfish, crab legs, or lobster, all of which are on Shrimpy&#39;s menu, along with an abundance of shrimp. You can get it fried or boiled and with assorted seasonings. Cajun is the theme here (from the zydeco music to the mardi gras beads to the flavorings). 

We went with fried shrimp, which were large, simple and tasty with a light cornmeal batter, and the crab cakes, unassuming-looking pucks that yielded yummy seafood as well as some spice and bits of bell pepper and went well with the remoulade. 

The two staff members we interacted with (lady at the counter and guy who had been in the kitchen but came out to clear our table and asked how we liked the meal) were both very friendly.

Shrimpy&#39;s has a drive thru, but it did take a few minutes to get the order inside (not a big deal; I don&#39;t think of seafood as being &#34;fast food&#34; the way a burger is), so I would say plan accordingly if you are hoping for a to go order. I feel like fish tastes best when freshly prepared, so I would rather eat in anyway!

Decor is a combo of Mardi Gras and craft store sign extravaganza. 

I will definitely return to try other menu items!"

Not terribly hungry, I ordered the &#34;adult&#34; Fish and Chips dinner. First of all,  the signage is a bit misleading as the meal does not come with a drink as shown. Secondly, with only one family (5 people) in the store, you would have a thought there would be a short wait time. Not so. After at least a 10 minute wait, my food was finally ready. Granted, the fries were good, but the fish was absolutely tasteless. Perhaps other menus items are better, but I&#39;ll never know because I&#39;m one and done.

Shrimpy&#39;s looks like a fast food joint complete with drive thru, so I&#39;d passed it by for a long time.  I heard it was the former location of a Long John Silver.  It&#39;s not fast food, the menu is replete with every shellfish except I don&#39;t remember seeing oysters.  Blue crab, crab legs, mussels, clams, lobster,  shrimp (head on or off), calamari, cat fish, cod, etc. There are sides like hush puppies, corn bread, garlic bread, corn, and the ubiquitous fries including sweet potato fries.  The first night, a Friday, there was a wait of 20+ minutes for a fried shrimp dinner that included 6 &#34;jumbo&#34; shrimp, fries and two sauces.  Seafood by the pound both fried and boiled, seasoned boiled included garlic, Cajun, and  one other I can&#39;t remember.  It showed promise.  You can eat in or carry out, no delivery.  My order to go was sad, limp fries, only 5 shrimp that were borderline &#34;jumbo&#34; and I paid extra for 6 oily hush puppies.  Second visit I told them I got only 5 shrimp, (no comment) ordered 1/2lb steamed shrimp with rajun Cajun sauce and garlic bread.  The garlic bread turned out to be a short bread stick for $1.89, which should have been free and in no way simulated garlic bread. Problem with food like this is it&#39;s not heavy and overly filling.  The satisfaction of seafood is taste.  No taste, no satisfaction.  The steamed shrimp were good, not enough alone so it needs a side or 1/2 lb of another fish!  Should I give it a third try for a third star?

The seafood here is excellent.  I ordered the cajun shellfish combo, which was served in a steamy plastic bag: shrimp, crawfish, crab legs, red potatoes, and corn on the cob.  The sauce everything was served in had just the right amount of flavor and heat to it and didn&#39;t take away at all from the natural deliciousness of the insects of the ocean.

Service was excellent--the staff were very friendly, had character, and were quite interactive.  The place was clean.  Even the bathroom smelled delicious, not even kidding.  There was a little bit of a wait time as it was a Friday night during the Lent season, but it was all worth it from the second I opened that steaming bag of fresh seafood to the moment I dropped the last empty shell at the top of the boneyard I created.  I&#39;ll definitely be back."

The first time the food was fresh and tasty, but today I was served pre-breaded &#34;catfish steaks&#34; which were neither fresh or tasty. They tasted frozen. The first time my fries and hush puppies were great, today the hush puppies were dry and the fries were warm and unimpressive. 

This place has really great tarter sauce, but I asked for tarter sauce today and I was told to &#34;try the &#34;special sauce&#34; He did not want to give me any tarter sauce because he was so excited about his &#34;special sauce&#34; which was anything but special. The sauce tasted exactly like ranch dressing mixed with hot sauce. I don&#39;t like ranch dressing on my fish.

While the food was good on my first visit, the prices are still too high for the amount of food that you get. I paid $10 for the 4 piece &#34;Jumbo Shrimp&#34; basket and my child was still hungry after eating the tiny portion of food. I knew that there would only be 4 pieces, but I thought that there was some new Giant Alien Jumbo shrimp that I&#39;d get to justify the price-It was just a regular sized shrimp.

The employees are very nice. The restaurant has sit down prices, but its setup like a fast food joint, that might not work if it ever gets busy because you&#39;ll have 15-20 people waiting near the registers in a tiny space for their order. My orders took about 15 minutes each time so be aware of that if you are going on your lunch break.

I really wanted to like this place, but the setup is wrong, the prices are too high, the portions too small, and if I&#39;m going to wait 15 minutes for my food I want it to be hot and consistent.

UPDATE- A &#34;MR. G&#34; sent me a message saying &#34; Hello young Khalilah would you like to see the kill dates?&#34; WTH? I hope that he is referring to the fish and not my untimely &#34;young&#34; life...Dude is Cray Cray for harassing anyone who leaves a review. Mr. G you should read Yelp reviews as constructive criticism and not as an attack- take this time to improve."

All the dinners came with fresh cut fries and hush puppies that were good and everything was cooked fresh.

The taste of the fish, chicken and shrimp were very good, the seasoning was excellent.  The customer service was very good and welcoming, they took time to explain the menu and how  everything was prepared.

My only gripe was the portion sizes for the prices, I paid almost $10 for 4 shrimp, fries and two hushpuppies. The chicken wing dinner consisted of 5 wing sections (not 5 whole wings) fries and 2 hushpuppies and cost about $7

All and all the food and service were good, but if they want to compete with other places in the area they will have to either adjust their prices or increase the portion sizes. Too expensive for what you get."

I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t have the same negative experience others have complained of.  My experience was so different that I&#39;m thinking this restaurant may have just attracted a few crabby complainers. ;)

I was greeted by a girl in a chef ensemble at the counter. She was friendly enough.  I ordered the popcorn shrimp basket and a drink. My total came to just under 10 bucks.  It took about 10 minutes till it was ready. My basket had a hefty serving of extra crispy crunchy popcorn shrimp, a fair size portion of delcious skin-on hand cut fries and a cup of coleslaw.  My basket came with a side of fry sauce (i think it was a mixture of mayo and tabasco) and a side of cocktail sauce.  They also offer packets of various other sauces at the condiment station, but we didn&#39;t see ketchup anywhere- little strange.  I would definitely go back and hope to try something different and more adventurous next time like one of the 3 fishes they offer."

I had seen this place for a few months ago and I had made a mental note that I should try it. 
So on a Friday evening I decided to pick up food for dinner from this place. 
Like I said before, the wait was a little over 30 minutes. I ordered two shrimp meals. It included fries and coleslaw and also a kids meal fish and chips. 
I knew I was in for a lengthy wait when I was offered a drink while I waited. I took a Sprite and it was served in a small cup. I sat and sat and sat waiting. I could see through the window that bags of food were being packaged and each time I would be hopeful. Each time I was disappointed. I waited for 30 minutes!! Did I say that already? Ugh.. 
I had a 3 year old with me who was being impatient so after 20 minutes the drive they girl asks if she can refill my drink. I declined but asked how much longer, she asked the cook who said my order was next. That was an additional 12 minutes later. 
After I finally got my food and got home I opened up my to go box and I was disappointed. The food just did not look good. I have to admit that the shrimp tasted better than they looked. I ate my dad looking shrimp and fries and called it a day. I can tell you that my meal was not worth the 30 minute wait. I can go to culvers and get the shrimp meal in about 8 minutes. 
I won&#39;t be returning. I can&#39;t justify sitting in the drive thru waiting for 30 minutes. Food was not worth the time. 
The drive thru girl was pleasant."

Although I have never had the hands to just sit down and eat here but from the looks of it people seem to enjoy themselves while their there.  I have eaten from here about 3 times now and I can honestly say that at first they reminded me of the angry crab restaurant on the north side of Chicago because the concept is the same. They serve you seafood in a bag by the pound or half pound but they also have other dishes too. However I am not truly in love with the food lately. I think for the location and I guess seafood market prices they are fairly priced but as far as flavor is concerned, I think it&#39;s lacking in that department.  When you crack into a crab leg and dip it into the sauce the flavor is just suppose to burst in all over your tastebuds but lately I did not get the same quality I did when I first visited. Who knows maybe it was an off day or something. I am still willing to give them a shot. By the way the young ladies at the counter are always so friendly."

We had a couple of the shrimp dishes and they were excellent both in terms of flavor and quality.

This joint would make money hand over fist in downtown Naperville but I worry it won&#39;t last due to poor visibility, parking and general expectations of what the place should be.

There is a problem with the service. It took too long for the food to be ready. We were the only people there the afternoon we visited. I can only imagine how it must be when they are really busy. This is something they will need to overcome to survive. Part of it is the expectation that they are serving fast food, which isn&#39;t really the case. I think the management would be rewarded by giving every table some kind of freebie appetizer, like hush puppies or something, to keep patrons distracted while they wait for their food.

True, the prices are a bit spendy but the quality and flavor of what you get in return was one of a kind in this area."

The one from auroraf was the most ridiculous review I&#39;ve ever read on Yelp. Seriously, you never even tried to place and you gave it the lowest stars? BOGUS


anyway, i felt compelled to add a positive review because this place is definitely not the place some misguided reviews paint it to be. i ordered a pound of the head on shrimp in the bag, a pound of the crawfish, and the chicken planks with fries. the head on shrimp and crawfish were so good. very fresh, naturally sweet and the sauce was very good. head on shrimp spoils very quickly so this was a great indicator of freshness. the chicken planks were ok and the fresh cut fries were good except they sprinkled a great spice mix on it but too spicy for my kids. It was my first time here so i&#39;ll know next time to request it without.

as for the price, i had nothing to complain about. seafood is not cheap, but this was a bargain. a pound of head on shrimp was 16.99 that day(i imagine prices fluctuate often due season and availability) and came with corn and potatoes. you&#39;re not going to get much shrimp at red lobster or any other chain. 

great seafood in the bag for a good price. ill be coming back as long as the quality remains."

Trying the recommendations from the owner we order the Basa fish basket and the jumbo shrimp basket both with come with fries and hush puppies. Hush puppies were delicious, but the fries were very soggy. The jumbo shrimp had a plastic kind of taste to them making them inedible. The Basa fish tasted good but it was very greasy. Along side the soggy fries it made for a bad combination. The portions of cocktail and hush puppy sauce were so tiny it made for only one or two dips. To top it off the same song played on repeat throughout our entire meal. As much as I wanted to like Shrimpys I was disappointed."

The Naperville/Aurora area has been lacking a QUALITY Cajun Seafood restaurant for quite some time.  I&#39;m beyond pleased with the quality of food here, and will officially become a regular.

I ordered the Shrimp basket and added a piece of Basa fish.  Food took a little time to be prepared, but this was a good sign... I knew right away the food is made to order.  

They brought the food over, and the appearance was quite pleasing.  I was also provided some homemade tartar and cajun sauces for my seafood choices.  First thing I took a bite out of was the hushpuppies.  I have NEVER eaten hushpuppies this fresh and this tasty.  I was also happy to see some corn niblets and some scallions inside.  

Next thing I tried was the shrimp.  Soon as I bit into the shrimp, I immediately knew by the texture this was some seriously fresh shrimp.  It had the desired &#34;snap&#34; when your teeth sink into it, and the taste was extraordinary.  It was also juicy, and not dried out as you commonly experience with frozen shrimp.  The shrimp itself (ignoring the breading) had that fresh taste.  I did see on another review that it tasted &#34;plasticky&#34;... no no sweetheart, that taste is fresh shrimp.  As for the breading, it was perfect.  Just enough to coat the shrimp, and provide the wonderful cajun seasoning to compliment the freshness of it.  The cajun dipping sauce was also very pleasing.  It had the right balance of seasonings, and had a nice kick to it as well.

Next up was the Basa fish.  Until today, I&#39;ve never heard of this fish before.  I was very happy with the texture of the fish.  The breading was just right as this filet is thinner (similar to tilapia, but had a grouper texture), and it wasn&#39;t heavy or greasy.  Also, the seasonings were mildly added, which is exactly what I&#39;d want out of a fish filet like this.  I could still taste the fish, and it wasn&#39;t overpowered by the breading/seasonings.  The homemade tartar sauce was a delightful compliment to the fish, and also liked that it was not too salty...  I&#39;ve had my share of tartar sauces that always are heavy on salt or onion seasoning.

Now, for the fries.  Folks, these are FRESH CUT fries.  So, if you&#39;ve never had them before, don&#39;t be surprised as they will NOT have the crispy outside you would expect from treated frozen potatoes served at your chainy fast-food restaurants.  They tasted excellent, and again, the ratio of seasonings was just right.  I could still taste the potato, but yet it was nicely complimented by the cajon flavors.

The staff at this location are very friendly as well!  It was a pleasure chatting with the owner about how much I loved the food.

Overall, I&#39;m very pleased and will without a doubt be returning to try the other offerings."

We got the fried sampler platter and the 1/2 pound seafood combo boil. The service was awesome and the girl at the counter recommended what we got and it was fantastic! She did a great job advising us what would be the best order in order to try as much as possible. We got a lot of food for $30 total. The fried sampler was great - Basa fish, shrimp, wings, fries, and hush puppies for about $10.99.  It was a huge piece of fish and with the the boil combo, it was the perfect amount of food.  The seafood combo boil had crawfish, shrimp, and crab legs for about $13.  We chose the butter garlic sauce and it was delicious. There was also the option to add corn and potatoes, but we decided to just go with the seafood. 

The service was great, the food was enjoyable, the only reason I marked down was because of the decor/cleanliness/atmosphere. When you first walk in the decor and cleanliness, may make you think twice, but I definitely recommend sticking around for the food. Worth the trip!

Definitely would recommend the owners do a restaurant makeover to help bring it up to par with the food."

Either they should give more food for the price or lower the prices. It is set up like a fast food restaurant but everything requires a wait so the set up is strange. But hey to each its own. The food is good enough for me to go back but the prices will make sure that I dont go back too often.

The decor is pretty cool because i&#39;m a big fan of new orleans/cajun. They also have a lot of ragtime music playing which i like.
     As for the food. I ordered the pound of crawfish and i really liked it. I had the cajun flavor and it came with a piece of corn and potatoes, all made together in a bag. I really liked he cajun flavor. It was not too spicey but had a really distinct flavor. At $13, i thought it was a fair price. It came with a creamy sweet cajun sauce that took me a while to get used to. My girlfriend went with the fried catfish basket and she didn&#39;t hate it but she felt it wasn&#39;t worth the price. I agree because her basket was $8 but only came with 1 piece of fish and a small order of fries. She enjoyed the fish, but felt the value was not there.
   We feel this is a good place to check out and see if it&#39;s you&#39;re type of restaurant. Especially because it won&#39;t cost you an arm and a leg. 
    The reason i feel this is 3 stars is because even though i liked my crawfish i can see how the catfish was a bit dissapointing and did not stand out in any way."

I have driven by the place numerous times and finally decided to give it a whirl. I tried the shrimp basket, which was beyond what I expected. For 8.99, you get 6 large shrimp, what seems a pound of fries and cole slaw (along two dipping sauces). The shrimp were great with a little bit of spice. The fries remind me of larger cuts from Great Steak &amp; Potato fries. Overall, I&#39;m impressed and would come again."

However there are glaring problems with the restaurants processes or lack there of. I went to Shrimpys a Friday during lent so I understand that a fish establishment will be busy.  However the gentleman working the register was also trying to expedite the food.  I watched food die in the window as he took orders and I watched people grow impatient as they waited to place an order. As I waited for 45 min I heard them continuously promise waits of 10 min to the new tickets. While I was there they lost a couple tickets and saw at least three people complain about incorrect orders and one who demanded money back after waiting a hour. I spent much of my 45 min exchanging looks with other customers waiting as we watched the glaring organization problems. I think much of the frustration came from customers being misled on ticket times. I appreciate that things are being cooked to order, but I also appreciate honesty.

I finish by pleading with Shrimpys to fix some necessary issues because I would like to see them succeed in the nitch they are trying to fill. I will return to Shrimpys because the food was enjoyable and because I will give them the benefit of being a young business. I hope they are able to iron out the kinks."

The first time we got the shrimp basket. Nothing special. The shrimp was mushy and flavorless.  The fries were mediocre at best.  I was unimpressed and disappointed,  as I really wanted a great seafood place in the neighborhood. 
The second time just solidified that we will never eat there again.  I ordered the crawfish (why do they stuff the fish into 2 huge plastic garbage bags?) and it was disqusting.  It was like looking at a plate of large red crickets that tasted worse than they looked. The only way I&#39;d ever eat that is if it were the apocolypse and I was running out of dead frogs to eat. Gross. 
It cost $50 for some bland, soggy shrimp,  a garbage bag full of dead red crickets and some lifeless lukewarm fries.  It took 2 days to get the stench of their food out of the house.  I tore up their menu.  Return? Never again."

I tried the jumbo shrimp basket. They should notify the customer that all their food is SPICY!!!! I&#39;m extremely sensitive to spices. I could not enjoy the &#34;average&#34; size &#34;jumbo&#34; shrimp because of the heat. Owners should consider offering a batter for their fried foods with no heat. I added on hush puppies which were really good. I also added on corn on the cob which was a 5in. Ear for $1.89.....really? Finally, you would expect a really good tarter sauce at a &#34;Sea food&#34; restaurant. Unfortunately, they only had a generic store bought package of tasteless tarter sauce.....disappointing.

Used to be good, I was willing to cut our server slack, he seemed new, not sure of anything, screwed the order up, and took for ever.
The main issue was the fish I ordered was not even edible! Super dry, came in a bunch of small pieces like it was whatever they could dig up at the bottom of the freezer. It was supposed to be sautéed? Not sure what they did to it. Sweet potatoes tasted weird as well. My wife asked to see the manager, took him 10min plus to show up adding to our 2 hour saga.  And he seemed disheveled, just said they would take it off my bill and that was the extent of it. Truly couldn&#39;t care less. 
Just a bad experience start to finish, to bad.
Honestly the only positive was they bought out the water quickly and had bread to eat while waiting an hour+ for food -although whats with 3 rolls for 4 people??"

We did 6:15 on a Saturday night, and while it wasn&#39;t utterly packed, there was a healthy crowd.

I like how the place doesn&#39;t pack you in like sardines, as they do at the Wildfire Grill. Plenty of room, and you don&#39;t run into other people when you pull your chair out.
We started with a server named Emily, who was fine, but then we got switched to a guy named Greg. He offered some excellent suggestions on wine and entrees that turned out to be spot on.

Everything was prompt, service was great, food was phenomenal. We started out with a round of drinks and the grilled calamari, which is the best anywhere. A little spicy, so be warned, but I love it.

Minestrone was fantastic, and everybody else had salad, which they were pretty happy about. The bread is dangerous, because it&#39;s soft and warm and easy to fill up on. We specifically reminded each other not to go nuts on the bread because it&#39;s very good and they keep bringing it.

The family ordered, respectively, shrimp Bellagio, linguine with clams, and honey-glazed salmon. Everybody seemed more than happy. I went for the filet mignon, and killed it. Perfect medium, with asparagus and outstanding garlic mashed potatoes. 
We got some dessert to go, since we had birthday stuff to do at home.  On the way out I was fortunate to meet the owner, who&#39;s one of those guys who is personally involved with the business (which is great for places like Absolutely Delicious and Sweet-and-Savory in Westmont, and killed the local Brat House). I was happy to tell him, dinner was a very happy experience, and our server was great. 

In fact, I thought I had tipped well, and when I got home, I realized I had made a boo-boo, so I went back and threw some extra cash at Greg. 
This was yet another good visit, a highly successful birthday dinner, and everybody went home more than happy."

Whatever you do, don&#39;t order the sautéed perch. My husband ordered this and it was fried, dry and tasteless. My kids had cheeseburgers and that was probably the only predictable items. The sweet potatoes tasted like they had lemon juice in them. Talked to the manager and he took the nasty perch off the bill but didn&#39;t seem to concerned we asked him to the table. In addition, we were late receiving our Italian wedding soup and it was &#34;freshly@ made but undercooked and the pasta in it was a bit too el dente. Even my kids noted the pasta was undercooked. Sorry I will not be returning ever again."

I can&#39;t remember having quite as flavorful fish dish. The minestrone usually a throw away was also flavorful and served piping hot. The missing 5th star is due to the amateurish service."

We had no reservation, so we got seats next to the bar. The restaurant looks classy and have nice decor with full bar.
Many options in menu and we opted for Vodka chicken thin crust pizza as the name sounds unique.
For drinks they have good collection of wines and I opted for Little Black dress Merlot.. 
Scapa Kitchen serves variety of pastas and we ordered Cavatelli Carlita and it was not at all good.. 
Personally, I didn&#39;t liked this pasta, it was undercooked and flavors were missing. So,Vodka chicken pizza became our dinner savior. I would also like to mention the Balsamic salad which comes with pasta was totally bland.. 
I&#39;m not going to visit this place again.."

I booked our reservation through Groupon, I received a written confirmation and at least 4 phone calls to confirm our reservation, including one on Thanksgiving Day.  Surprise, they did not have our reservation.  However, we were early enough that we were able to be seated.  When you enter the bar is to your right and then the dining rooms begin on your left.  Yes, rooms.  They even have 2 booths surrounded by draperies.  These are clearly visible right next to the stairs to the basement.  We were seated at, what we were told, the warmest table in the place.  Thank goodness I was wearing layers, not very warm.
Our server greeted us and explained the way they redeem their Groupons, it&#39;s different.  Since we had not been here before, he constantly stressed how fresh everything is made, after order is placed.  Okay, so the sausage and peppers were lukewarm at best, why?  I will say the rolls (3 for 2 people) were very tasty and the garden salad I had was excellent.  My husband said the Caesar salad was just okay.
We frequently dine in Italian restaurants and in all the years have NEVER had veal Francese made with a cream sauce.  It did not taste good and if you scraped it off, the veal had NO flavor at all.  My chicken parmigiana was not warm and I found a bone in my pasta side dish, that was served at room temperature.
One server in this particular room and our used dishes sat in front of us until the next course was brought out.  Just after we received our entrees, a bus boy did refill our water glasses.
Not a positive dining experience.  We will stick to our usual place for good Italian food."

I will say the staff has been apologetic, and nice (comping another order for instance), when the dish has been unavailable,  but come on guys!!

I was very pleased with the beautiful ambiance this restaurant had. The food was very good and the staff overall was friendly. The host and busboy were especially welcoming and accommodating. However I have to knock this place down a star because of our waiter Bernard. His unpleasant and unwelcoming demeanor was very felt throughout our meal. It shouldn&#39;t feel like ordering, or asking for something extra is a favor the waiter is doing you. Maybe he was having a bad day, but never a hint of a smile was given or any kind of energy that would make anyone feel welcome.

Tried to order veal limone but they were out of veal, so I tried the chicken limone.  To be honest, it was delicious and while I can&#39;t say for sure, I probably enjoyed the chicken more than I would have the veal.  The chicken, of which there was plenty, was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of artichoke, lemon, and capers.  The dinner salad that was served with it was also a nice salad with lots of tasty tidbits in it.  My dining partner had a bowl of minestrone soup which was good, but the bowl of soup was a small bowl - hardly a meal-sized serving.  I would love to try some other things on the menu. The service was good."

First you are given oil and an entire bowl of parmesan for the table. So no awkward waiting for them to scoop/shred it for you and feeling like you should say &#34;ok&#34; but you really want an entire cup and a half on your plate. The bread is a soft warm roll with herbs and butter on it. Each meal comes with soup or salad so we got the pear salad which was good. It looks like the sliced the pear with a mandolin but in the center of each slice there was a thin layer of cheese. I loved the salad, the dressing was a little too plain and oily for my taste though. Then I ordered the lemon chicken and angel hair pasta with capers and cream sauce. Very hearty and creamy but delicious! For desert the tiramisu was perfect. We also got cappuccinos which didn&#39;t taste that great- coffee tasted burnt or left out too long or something. But everything else was amazing- will definitely be coming back. Also, they have tables that are surrounded by curtains so its very private- request if you are making date reservations"

It&#39;s not your 1960&#39;s kitschy Italian restaurant (what Buca di Bepo goes for.) Yet, when we came recently for my dad&#39;s birthday, he found pieces of that Italian American nostalgia that he grew up with, AND the gourmet modern touch that keeps the dining experience fresh. Basically what they achieve here is the right blend of modern and rustic that is so en vogue these days. It reflects in the dishes offered (pastas, steaks, fish, etc) the flavors, and the restaurant decor (You won&#39;t find the walls lined with silly faux family photos, rather a combination of simple art work and trendy Edison bulb light fixtures.) Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Impeccable sauces, if you have Italian heritage, you know how important it is to get sauce right. The first item I ever ordered was a simple pasta with meat sauce..basically THE benchmark. It was right on! I&#39;ve been a fan since. Go dine and enjoy!"

Thought early would be a good idea, since it was likely to be a busy night. 

From the moment we arrived, every employee we encountered was in a complete tizzy. Manager trying desperately to correct lights that keep blinking, waitress informing us that: the wine we ordered was not available/neither were the Italian sodas my kids came here for/and the calamari my 6yo ordered for her entree which arrived very early shouldn&#39;t be sent back because &#34;it was a very busy night and I am not sure we have any more calamari.&#34;  Really?! An Italian restaurant is going to run out of calamari at 5:30pm on Valentine&#39;s Day? Also, the dining room was freezing. My kids kept their coats on for the entire meal.

I will add that the food was hit or miss.  Calamari was good, dinner salads were tiny, Shrimp Portofino pasta was under sauced. 

We will not rush back to Scapa.  It&#39;s really too bad because the location is great as is the interior of the restaurant."

I had been there once for a communion party for my nephew and decided to try it for myself.  My daughter is a pretty picky eater, so I wasn&#39;t sure how she would like it.

We arrived early (before 5 pm) and it was not very busy at that time.

We were offered a seat at a semi-private table with curtains that provided a certain amount of privacy.  My daughter liked the bit of privacy and seemed to be impressed.

Our server, Bernard, was courteous, friendly and helpful.  He gave us just the right amount of attention. 

We both ordered gnocchi.  She ordered the country version with gorgonzola cheese, sausage and vodka sauce.  It comes with soup or salad and she ordered the salad (balsamic dressing).  She enjoyed her meal very much.

I ordered the gnocchi carbonara, with smoked bacon, peas and a crème sauce.  I also ordered the salad (blue cheese dressing). The salad was good, and the gnocchi was outstanding!  It is definitely a new favorite.  

We shared a dessert of bananas foster, a dish we make at home periodically.  It was extremely good and the server flamed out the alcohol at the table - a nice touch.

When we left the restaurant, it had become quite busy, both in the restaurant and the bar. It seems to be quite a popular place in downtown Clarendon Hills.

The price was reasonable, service was great and parking plentiful.  I would very much recommend this establishment!"

The pasta is either very good or lukewarm. Every dessert has been good and the service is fair. The carbonara has been hit or miss but the vodka and Alfredo have been delightful.

First, we had called about 10 days in advance to ask that a certain dish be available as typically it would be in short supply.  After our server took our order he came back about 10 minutes later because he had forgotten one of the orders, which happened to be what we called  in advance for to make sure would be available for us.  Another 10 minutes goes by and a different server comes in to tell us that they are out of the dish!! Then the owner comes out to apologize..unacceptable.  Our server was very slow and generally unattentive.  After dinner a few coffees and desserts were ordered.  The coffees came...with no dessert.  Then, heres the best part.  Another manager type lady comes in to say. &#34;Ive got some bad news.&#34; This room has another reservation so you need to leave!!!! We never even got the dessert!

Scapa is a good place to eat, no doubt. We had good service, too, so no real complaints. I&#39;m happy we tried a new place - one of the few in a 15 mile or so radius with both rigatoni AND vodka sauce on the menu. :) 

Sunday is BOGO apps - yay for us. We had the shrimp with polenta - delicious - and the grilled calamari - also good if you can take your calamari naked! Ha. As for our meals, I got the rig + vod with italian sausage. Yum. I had the salad on the side and it was not good, though his minestrone was great. His lasagna left a bit to be desired but it was pretty good. 

We did an early dinner to avoid the crowd (and cause we had a late breakfast). And, by the time we left, it was incredibly loud and there were way more preteens than I&#39;d expect to see on a Sunday night.

I have tried much of the food and drink menu as it exists today and as it did in the past. I find it difficult to write a concise review of Scapa but I very enjoy when people get to the point in reviews, so here is my best attempt.

Food (4 Stars): Pretty standard Italian fare that will not underwhelm but will not blow you away. I am a fan of the recent cutback in portion size. I always leave full but never so full that I regret my meal. I would recommend the Pasta Bruno, the Lasagna Bolegnese and the Almond Crusted Tilapia.

Decor/Ambiance (4 Stars): Nothing too crazy. The feel is what you would expect. I find it difficult to give a poor rating or an exceptional one. It can get loud on weekend nights with families and the lighting can be a little dim but by and large, a quality atmosphere.

Price (3 Stars): It&#39;s a little pricey, especially if you order drinks, but not so expensive that it&#39;s unreasonable. People complain about the price given the portions, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s justified.

Service (4 Stars): Since an ownership change a few years ago, I have yet to have a bad service experience. I never put too much weight on service though, because it is the most volatile aspect of rating a restaurant in my opinion."

Our waiter was great but harried as well. The restaurant was quite warm as if the AC had not been turned on yet. Our meals were very good as usual but cocktails odd which is not typical. ( I.e.

She usually treats us to birthday dinners at Scapa because it is just the right blend of upscale, friendly, cozy, and tasty!

Since moving back to the area with my husband, he and I have really grown to love this restaurant. They have these &#34;private&#34; tables that are separated with a huge curtain, so it doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;re eating with everyone else in the restaurant - very cozy, private, and fun for a date night.

The food is consistent - we&#39;ve yet to have a bad dish here. We ordered the fried calamari one night, and it was quite salty (but delicious!). The bread that comes to the table is always hot and fresh, and the olive oil and parm. cheese is a perfect pair for the bread.

We went on a Monday night a few weeks ago and they had BOGO appetizers. I had the Caprese salad and he ordered a sausage platter - both very good!

Overall, the staff is friendly (the owners often go table-to-table to check in on guests which is a nice touch). The bus boys are incredibly attentive (you&#39;ll never need to ask for a refill of water - they are great at refilling your glass). 

Lately it feels like we have been hit-or-miss when it comes to servers. Some are really attentive and friendly, and we have had one (on more than one occasion) who comes to the table with smokers breath and seems to play the &#34;cool&#34; card more than we&#39;d prefer.

If you haven&#39;t been there, give them a try! It&#39;s a great place for date night, it doesn&#39;t break the bank (one appetizer, two entrees = about $40), and it&#39;s always nice supporting a local restaurant."

My wife and I went to dinner here last month to celebrate our 16th anniversary.  I requested a private &#34;cabin&#34; booth when I made the reservation.  Given we were going to be there on a Friday night, I assumed they would respond with a stock answer that I typically get from most restaurants like &#34;we can put the request down but can&#39;t promise.&#34;  Instead, they said  that it would be no problem, and when we got there, they gave us the best private booth.  A few of the staff stopped in to wish us a happy anniversary and they even provided us complimentary desert, which I had not expected.  

We both had the almond-crusted tilapia and mushroom soup, which were very good.  Service as attentive but not annoyingly so.

Definitely, definitely going back!"

The rest of our group was seated when we arrived, and the waitress was over asking for our drink order as we were still trying to sit down (mind you we were still 5 minutes early for our reservation, so we weren&#39;t putting anyone behind). I appreciate the attentiveness, but I&#39;m not sure anyone could know their drink order that fast! We had the caprese and sausage and peppers for our appetizers, and both were great. The rolls were good and I appreciated the bowl of parm on the table. Our meals came with choice of soup or salad - we all chose soup, and enjoyed it. Everyone enjoyed their meals - my grandparents both got the scallops and risotto, which they both said was excellent. We also had the pesto chicken (some pieces of the chicken were a little dry, but overall, I enjoyed it), chicken parm, veal parm, and lasagna. They have my grandpa a free cannoli for his birthday which was a nice gesture. Service started out quick and then got a bit slower as the night went on, I think because our server had a lot of larger tables. Only complaint - it was SO loud. We had to shout to hear each other. We&#39;ll be back!"

It took quite a while before anyone ever came to the table.  When we ordered our food they asked if I wanted soup or salad and I passed because I didn&#39;t want to fill up before the meal.  The person I was dining with suggest I get the soup to go, so that&#39;s what I did.  I guess they missed the to go part.  The meal I ordered was the Chicken Saltimbocca.  It took about an hour to hit the table I would compare it to S&#39;barro, but that would be insulating to S&#39;barro.  The chicken didn&#39;t quite taste right and it was a very flavorless.  It makes Olive Garden look good.  At that point I really wished they didn&#39;t take my soup away as it had to be better then this, even though it probably would be cold after an hour.  And They didn&#39;t even ask to take my soup away that I hadn&#39;t touched yet, they just took it when I went up to the bar to get a drink since we didn&#39;t see out waiter for about half an hour.

All and all it was just a terrible experience from beginning to end.  For the prices they charge and the ratings they get I expected a whole lot more than terrible service and flavorless food."

Our usual table for ten (mostly freeloaders). The ambiance was warm and cozy and holiday themed. Friendly staff and we were seated immediately.  We were well attended to. Two orders of Chicken Francese, crispy polenta cakes with spicy shrimp and an assortment of pizza&#39;s and pasta dishes for the kids. A new menu offering of &#34;simply grilled&#34; fish was a welcome addition for the Paleo type. The complimentary garlic oil (?) coated bread is very good. Prices are reasonable and the portions are generous (we all brought leftovers home). The bar is a wonderful spot for a cocktail and keeping your eye on a game.

Really nice restaurant that accommodated our party size well.  That&#39;s about where the good feelings end.  For starters, they have gluten-free options noted on their menu with an official-looking &#34;GF&#34; logo.  When you ask how these items are prepared, they come clean and say that they are not prepared separately and can have some cross-contamination.  While I applaud their honesty, that should be disclosed on the menu itself.  People with Celiac disease tend to have high sensitivity to gluten, so they need to know that what they are ordering was prepared properly.  This is not some fad diet, it actually impacts people&#39;s lives.

We all ordered, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited (took an hour).  Then a manager stops by and says &#34;sorry for the delay, your meals are literally coming out right now.&#34;  Fifteen minutes later (yes...fifteen!!!), the meals come out.  Of course, they forget my wife&#39;s meal and then say &#34;it&#39;s coming out right now&#34;.  Again...almost 10 minutes later, her food arrives.  It was just pasta and veggies...how long does that take to make?!!!  Why was that not placed as a priority when they realized they screwed up?  Why am I asking rhetorical questions?!!!

I had the Chilean sea bass, which was cold by the time it was placed in front of me.  Seriously...we waited this long, and you bring out cold food?  Then we get the bill (this is not a cheap restaurant)...and...no discount or anything taken off for our troubles.  They just hand me the bill (with the gratuity baked in for good measure), and I just had to pay it.  There is a line for additional tip, to which I would normally add, but not this time.  That&#39;s pretty insulting, considering how much we ordered and spent.  

I am not the type to sit there an argue, especially since this was my family and I was paying for everyone.  I did not want to cause a scene, but I was furious when I got the bill.  I could feel the steam pouring out of my ears, but I just bit my tongue and swallowed the blood (best part of my meal that night).

We are not going back.  The food was not that good, overall service stunk, and the prices do not warrant all of the above.  I am willing to pay a higher price for great food &amp; service.  This place does neither.  

There are too many good restaurants in the Chicagoland area...don&#39;t waste your time at this place."

That&#39;s how bad of an experience my husband and I just had there. It was not our first time there but will for sure be the last. The first time we had awful service but the food wasnt that bad. We decided to try one more time since it&#39;s close to the house and we saw a groupon that was a great deal. Now I&#39;m regretting buying the deal because we didn&#39;t even use it so a huge waste of money. Everything started off ok. Appetizer was good (fried calamari) wine good...service was slow but we weren&#39;t in a big hurry so it didn&#39;t really bother us until we ordered the entree. After a half hour we realized we&#39;d been sitting for almost two hours and and still no entree. Finally it came out. My husband ordered the cavatelli con carne which is cavatelli and short ribs I ordered chicken limon. Omg can you say the WORST meals I ever had at an Italian restaurant. I&#39;m not exaggerating. My husband is Italian so we eat out at a lot of Italian restaurants . I&#39;m pretty picky so I usually order similar items on menus. One of them, being cavatelli. I tried my husbands and it was so undercooked and flavorless I couldn&#39;t take a second bite. I mean it may have been taken right out of the package and put on a plate. That&#39;s how hard it was. My chicken limon was even worse. The chicken was fine but the sauce was so thick and smelled so awful I&#39;m not even sure lemon was used in it. It tasted like mayonnaise based or Dijon. I have never in my life had chicken limon like this.  I have never in my life sent back a meal let alone two meals! We kindly asked the server for a manager. It took about 15 min for tony to come out. Really?! Talk about the worse customer service ever.he instantly had an attitude before we even talked and pretty much told us we didn&#39;t know what we were talking about and the food is fine. They did take off the two entrees  from the bill but we bought a groupon so that did not benefit us at all. Now we still have this groupon we will never use. I will never step foot in this place again after being treated so awful and will make sure everyone I know doesn&#39;t either. Tony I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you are out of business by the end of the year. There is No way this is the same owner that&#39;s been there for years. I had been to Scapa with my parents many years ago but never were treated like this and the food was never this awful. Good luck"

For my starter, I had the scallops with risotto. The scallops were good size, cooked perfectly, but overly salty. The risotto was a bit bland, so if I ate a bite of scallop with risotto, it balanced out. Scallops also had sand in them. If not for the sand and too much salt, would&#39;ve been a nice dish. For my main I had the braised short rib with tagliatelle. The tagliatelle tasted homemade and had a very nice bite to it. The braised short rib was again VERY salty. It was as though the chef solely used salt to season the meat. I left 90% of the dish on the plate. The main entree came with a house salad that had fresh greens and vegetables. 
Service was the best part of the meal. Our server, Mark, was very friendly, showed the right amount of attentiveness - attentive to our needs but not overly annoying and coming back every bite we took. He had a great personality and was a fun server who clearly enjoyed his job!
Overall the prices were very reasonable and if not for the over salting of my food, I would&#39;ve given it 4 stars."

I tried the calamari, but I think you can skip that, along with the eggplant rolltini, get the caprese and the lobster mac&amp;cheese instead.

The waiter was attentive and helpful. The wine selection and menu were great. 

Everyone enjoyed their food and the service was really spot on.

I had the Rosemary Whitefish, which was really great and enough for three servings. My boyfriend had the 8-finger cavatelli , which was something none of us had tried before and it was delicious! My friend had lobster ravioli in lobster sauce, which was AMAZING! I enjoyed my dish, but when I come back here I&#39;m definitely getting this ravioli. 

They also knew it was my college graduation party, so they brought out molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. Delicious! But be careful... my sister burned her mouth since it was fresh from the oven haha.

The first time (close to when it opened) was great! Loved the food, especially the soups, the service was good, and the ambiance is relaxing but lively.

 The second time we ate there was a stark difference from the first. The food was noticeably lower quality (canned green beans) but service was fine. So, we stayed away for a long time thinking it was already going down hill. 

We returned again last night to be pleasantly surprised. The food was back to where it was the first time we dined here. I had the braised short ribs and parsely pappardelle that was fantastic, Italian Wedding Soup, homemade, light, and delicious.

The atmosphere is rather generic, the decorations outdated and have a chain feel to them.  When we dined there they had live music but unfortunately the musicians weren&#39;t very good. 

Our server was very friendly, but incredibly slow.  In fact, we ended up paying with cash as he never came back to our table to pick up our credit card to pay for the meal.  In hindsight, we probably could have left without even paying!

The food was fine, nothing to write home about but not terrible.  My husband had the pizza which had a nice flavor.  I had the cavatelli; it was flavorful and made with fresh garlic (which I love), but I wasn&#39;t wild about the dish on a whole.  Our bruschetta appetizer was adequate but seemed to be made from a bunch of pre-packaged ingredients.

All in all, Scapa&#39;s is &#34;okay.&#34;  If you are looking for a quick bite to eat for a casual evening out, I&#39;d recommend."

My first time I got the chicken parm with their vodka sauce and the proportion was huge!! I had left overs for lunch then next day and dinner. Their vodka sauce was very creamy but not too thick. 

The next time I went was with a group of women so we split a bunch of the appetizers. I got the white pizza which everyone loved! Another fan favorite was the calamari and the eggplant parm.

The last time I went I just got the chicken caesar salad. It was really good. The chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly and was not burnt. The ceasar dressing was also up to par! 

I will definitely be going back every time Im craving Italian."

The key factor to Scapa is the customer service. They always take care of our sometimes extremely fickle needs. When I train my staff on customer service, I use the staff at Scapa as an example. 
My fiancé also loves the little booths with the curtains, it&#39;s a great touch.

My boyfriend and I first came to Scapa about a year and a half ago and we have loved it ever since!  We are city people at heart, but (somewhat reluctantly) moved out to the suburbs two years ago, and don&#39;t really care for the big chain restaurants at the malls.  We like restaurants/bars that have more of an intimate, downtown Chicago feel and atmosphere--where we can jut sit and relax and have a glass of wine, or get an actual meal, so when we found Scapa, we were thrilled!  They have a nice bar with some high-top tables to sit at (where you can usually find us!) but they also have a lot of space in the back with booths and tables.  It can get crowded, but never overwhelmingly so.  We moved to Clarendon Hills this past summer and now we go to Scapa at least once a week, we just love it there.  

Only complaint is that they don&#39;t have many &#34;healthy&#34; options for appetizers...don&#39;t get me wrong, all the food is DELICIOUS, but I really wish they had some lighter items available...."

I should have known when a 6:30pm reservation was not a problem at 4pm on a summer Saturday, but we gave it a try. Hard to find running parallel to the Burlington railroad tracks, the place looks decent from the outside with outdoor dining You enter into a long bar almost running the length of the room, and not a human being there. Gulp. We were escorted into the dining room with zero ambiance, not even a picture on the walls. The server was nice enough, albeit for dessert she took the other couple&#39;s order and walked away while the four of us looked at one another in disbelief that we were not given the opportunity to order anything.

As of this week, Tony &amp; Kristin Swegen have taken over this popular restaurant in downtown Clarendon Hills. 

I had dinner at Scapa last night and met the new owners. Tony has a wealth of experience in the restaurant business. His talents range from being an accomplished chef to have been on the managerial side by serving a general manager for Cheescake Factory for over 10 years. 
Kristin&#39;s expertise is in public relations. I think this is important. As he local people know, Scapa is definitely the best local Italian restaurant. However, if you are not familiar with the streets of Clarendon Hills (think spaghetti bowl), this could be a difficult place to find.

Tony &amp; Kristin do not propose any radical changes right out of the gate. However, expect improvements to be forthcoming. Initially, the servers will be wearing plain black shirts as opposed to the uncomfortable chef jackets which they now wear. Soon, Scapa will be open for lunch, too. A better beer selection is already available at the bar. Expect some tweaking of the menu to occur as well.

All in, I anticipate the new energy and balanced corporate experience to have a profoundly positive impact on my favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant. Come taste for yourself (and order the Chicken Giuseppe)."

I was prepared to have so-so service based on what I read on here.  I have to tell you the service is some of the worse I have had anywhere, which is very strange because it looked like they had plenty of help.  We got to the table with no napkins or silverware which we had to ask for.  The waitress was nice but was very hurried.  It took us 45 minutes from the time we ordered to get our soup and salad.  The food got mixed reviews. My husband had the linguine and clams but was still hungry afterwards. For $22 you should be full.  I had the almond crusted tilapia which was good.  Everyone else at the table had mixed reviews.  You would think with all of the negative reviews about service that they would improve.  Don&#39;t think we will be going back unfortnuately"

The experience started with a waiter (we&#39;ll call him Lurch---because he never smiled or showed any indication of being a part of the human race via smile or personality).

Hubby ordered baked clams and fettuccine Alfredo----what Italian restaurant screws up alfredo sauce?  It was like milk with parmesan cheese added...really poor quality.  And the baked clams, fahgedaboudit...really small, boring for an outrageous price.

I should have done this review sooner, because I&#39;ve forgotten what I had (not very memorable).  But we both remembered the fettuccine Alfredo fiasco.

The owners would come into the small dining area and schmooze with a table of their friends, but not go around to any other tables to see how their guests were faring.

Forgettable. Overpriced.  Absolutely the poorest service ever."

Great for parties! 

I was at a party at Scapa Italian Kitchen last Saturday night that was held in a private banquet room. I was extremely pleased how they handle larger parties.  My group was a neighborhood babysitting coop that my wife and I are a part of (ask me later!), many of the parents know each other quite well, so it wasn&#39;t uncomfortable being in a room figuring out drink tabs and such.  Scapa makes the space quite comfortable with family style tables, heavier window treatments and a well sized plasma TV tactfully positioned for guys like me to sneak a peak of the game.  It was perfect since an NFL playoff game was scheduled!   We were served bruschetta and fried calamari for appetizers the main course a terrific Vesuvio style chicken and a Cesar salad.  Two servers were reserved just for our party so there was never any waiting for drinks or anything we needed.  It was a reasonably priced party for sure and the food was delicious!  

I have eaten at Scapa Italian Kitchen too many times to count, spent various times sitting at their charming bar for a quick bite and ordered out many times as well.  The food has always been excellent.  I&#39;m excited for the new owners to put their special twist on their favorite dishes.  My favorite for a lunch or quick bite at the bar has always been the meatball salad (Two good-sized meatballs with marinara sauce and a house salad).  My recommendation for dinner is the Scrimp Siciliano. 

I first met the new owners, Tony and Kristin at the Clarendon Hills Christmas Walk when Tony was cooking up Fettuccine Alfredo for the masses of people trying to get into the restaurant on a cold winter night.  If you have ever been to a Clarendon Hills Christmas Walk, you know then, it is a mix between a festival and a free-for-all.  Owners of businesses in the downtown area roll out the carpet for anyone willing to come into their shops and sample, drink or say just say hello.  It&#39;s really a unique event that everyone should experience.  The chamber of commerce puts on the event where the kids can see Santa, ride in a sleigh and sing along with carolers and the adults."

They recently changed owners and the bread they put out on the table is to die for (I may have cheated my GF diet for a piece once or twice) and I wish they could make a GF option for the bread.

I must say, we had a very good experience, start to finish.  As we were taking my elderly mother I figured I&#39;d see if they took reservations, as she would not have been too keen on waiting in the bar for a table.  Yes - they take reservation - - even confirmed it via email.  (Although we really didn&#39;t need them on a Wednesday night - plenty of tables available.)  However, the reservation did score us one of the three &#34;curtained-off tables&#34;, which made the dinner more intimate.

Wednesday / Thursdays are $5 Martini nights, so we got an added bonus here!  Good sized drinks that are well made.

As for the food, our entrees included soup / salad.  The house dressing was great!  Our dinner portions were very generous.  My Mom&#39;s Eggplant Parm was HUGE.  She had enough for another meal.  Same with my wife&#39;s Chicken Saltamboca.  She loved it!  I had a pasta dish that was large and tasty.  Next time I will try a chicken dish or house specialty.  Waiter and staff were very attentive.  Also met and talked with the owner.  Overall a great evening.

Will come back for the bar, as there was plenty of room to eat and drink there, as well.  Also looks like a great place on a warm summer evening with outdoor dining."

This is a neighborhood red-sauce joint dressed up as something more high end. My wife and I both had pasta dishes.  The pastas were overcooked and the sauce painfully bland.  I had calamari over linguini, which is pretty hard to mess up, but the cheap salad-bar black olives and lack of fresh garlic managed to disappoint.

Scapa&#39;s food is delicious. The food deserves at least 4 stars (but keep reading to see why I gave it 3). Especially the special cavatelli, giambotta, sauteed spinach and their mussels-  their red sauce is really good and spicy. Meatballs are also great. (We&#39;ve been here a lot!) 
But my favorite on the menu is their &#34;Braciole&#34; (pronounced &#34;bra-shol&#34;). It&#39;s flattened flank steak, stuffed with Itaian herbs and breadcrumbs, tied, sauteed and then slow-cooked in their red sauce until it&#39;s super-tender. I&#39;ve made it before at home (it requires some skill and attention) and theirs is outstanding. They only offer it as a side dish and I don&#39;t know why- it&#39;s that good. Which leads me to one of the reasons I gave this place 3 stars- and almost gave it 2.

I don&#39;t understand the business decisions the owners of Scapa are making . Recently my husband and I ordered some take-out and we placed an order for a side dish of braciole. Normally it comes with 2 pieces (price is $6.95). We ordered 2 orders (totalling 4 pieces) so we could enjoy it with our special cavatelli and salad.  After we get home with the order, we look in the bag and there was only 1 piece of braciole per order. We thought it was a mistake and called the restaurant. The woman on the phone told us that the menu had &#34;recently changed&#34; and now it was 1 piece per order. Basically they halved their order of braciole on the menu - but still decided to charge $6.95! 
  I haven&#39;t run a restaurant before, but if you have a hit on your menu, you don&#39;t half the order after a year or two and still charge the same amt! I&#39;ve heard of people upping the price after a while but doubling the price?? They should have just made it an entree with some sides and charged more- at least that would have made sense.
Also, another complaint I have is the value of one of the appetizers- their toasted ravs. We lived in St. Louis for 4 years where toasted ravs are on every menu and beyond plentiful. They must grow on trees down there. Yes, some places just buy them frozen, but some make them homemade.  When we&#39;ve ordered this before at other restaurants, places (homemade or frozen) usually give you at least 10 or 12 pieces for about $7-$8. At Scapa, 6 toasted ravs cost $6 bucks! A buck a toasted rav? please. Toasted ravs are really cheap to make. Scapa is trying to nickle and dime in all of the wrong places. LIke I said, I just don&#39;t get it.  I really hope Scapa figures this out!"

And what&#39;s with the 50 cent  &#34;snifter charge&#34; when you order Sambuca?  I didn&#39;t catch that item on the bill until the next day, and when I called to inquire, was told it&#39;s added because Sambuca is a heavy pour and to let the bartender know what glass to use.  Now, most restaurants seem to be able to hire competent bartenders and know how to program drink prices in their POS system, but I didn&#39;t press it.  It&#39;s not the money, it&#39;s the. . . I mean, what&#39;s next, a &#34;martini glass&#34; charge?  That&#39;s a heavy pour in a specific glass.  Hell, maybe they do, but no one at our table ordered a martini."

The table offered small sliced Italian bread with a spicy (not too) parmesan for dipping. OMG... if I actually cooked, I&#39;d want that recipe. 
I think my friend ordered Veal Parm... which she loved. (I was too busy enjoying my food to know what she was up to).
I wanted something light, but filling, so opted for eggplant ?? Rigiletto?? How refreshing to have a real Italian flavor, not the version made by Mexican cooks who think food is only good when it has heat. 
FLAVOR... that&#39;s the secret to good food. Well, they certainly offer flavor at Capri. I look forward to going there again... and again... and again.

We started with riesling and some complimentary warm bread. Loved loved the olives came with the bread. The spicy mussels was no so spicy but tasted great. We all loved the seafood risotto which had the plenty juicy seafood and rice was even better. 

We tried the lava cake and Hazelnut gelato. Both are heavenly but I loved the gelato just a tiny tiny more.

Idiot me, posted this for another Capri... Meant for this one...

So let me start by saying... It was rough Saturday evening when we went to see Superman vs Batman...

7pm 8pm and 9pm sold out whaaaaat?!?!?

Then we see Capri right next door -- so my BF and I decided to just eat dinner... 

My BF is half Italian half black and went to culinary school -- so he is very critical of Italian cuisine 

We see most customers going inside,  were older Caucasians/ Italians.... So we were intrigued...

I was greeted warmly by this lady.. She told me their full but could be seated in 15 minutes or we can sit at the bar. We opted for the bar... There is live music tonight.

The moment they served warm bread, they also served olives... My BF was almost in tears...

His grandma.... Pure Italian who lived in Berwyn (mist Italians did) died recently at age 90, and would always serve warm bread with olives... So my BF felt at home right away.... Two stars for that... And mind you... Not a midget size but a decent size platter.

We ordered bruschetta -- supposedly free as I checked in with Yelp --- they still charged me -- so watch your bill 

We ordered Cozze Capri -- we ordered spicy sauce -- mussels were fresh and delicious

Escarole soup --- ohemgee to die for... 3rd star

My BF ordered Vitello San Guisippe -- really good

I ordered Homemade rigatoni -- this is the other 2 stars - I can eat this all day... Noodles with a bite ( al dente ) and oh so flavorful without being salty.

Oh damn I can only give 5 stars right? 

Well the homemade tiramisu was exceptional too... Not too coffee-ish tasting but very delicate.... I love it

With the cappuccino -- wow outstanding

Giovanna and joe ... They were the owners -- both were very friendly ... I am the only Asian there and again my BF is half Italian but looks black.... So we were basically the only minority there ... But treated warmly by the owners 

The singer serenading us with Frank Sinatra songs and old school songs were a delight too especially after a couple of drinks....

Kudos to Tammi the bar manager and Crystal......

We will be back for more...."

have the heart to tell him how bad the food was until those that went Friday 
met up on Saturday. $$$ and not worth it, go to Capri Burr Ridge."

Again, everything was amazing. Hubby had a dish off of the specials menu... something with chicken, fresh pasta &amp; peppers. There was a ton of food in fact I packed the rest for his lunch today. He said it was amazing!!! (I don&#39;t do peppers so I didn&#39;t try). I ordered the gnocchi (lots of gnocchi) with a huge meatball!!! First off I&#39;m a foodie and really picky about my gnocchi. They better be pillowy soft &amp; melt in my mouth not just a pasty, dough ball and let me tell you.... Capri delivered!!!! The only gnocchi better that here that I&#39;ve had was homemade at an Italian Chef friends house (sorry Capri, lol). Seriously, I&#39;m in love with these gnocchi!!! We ended our meal with a molton lava cake that&#39;s sure to please any chocolate lover. Keep the amazing food coming out of that kitchen Capri!!!!!"

Tables and only 5 or six are emty and you still wait that long for 3/8 thick steak that they claim it takes 45 min plus to cook. Ok.
I think thats enough i don&#39;t need to go into the food.
So to recap the intertainment  was good they had Vito Zato server was good,  food and time ifor it to come out not so good."

It is located right next to the HOLLYWOOD BLVD. CINEMAS.  (It used to be an Asian  restaurant). Only 3 other tables with us, on a gorgeous  Sunday afternoon. 

We both had the escarole &amp; white bean soup, which was excellent. 
My husband ordered the chicken  Vesuvio ,  which was very tasty. 

I started out with the veal colculetta, and  spinach.  The veal was dry, over crispy, and  bland.  I sent it back , and  ordered the veal marsala, instead."

One big problem my husband and I have had is that we had yet to find good Italian food. That was until last week. We happened upon this restaurant sheet seeing a movie one night and liked the menu very much. I have been looking for some good veal francese. We ordered or food to go. I was not expecting what I got. What I got was the best veal francese I&#39;ve ever had in my life. That&#39;s even comparing to Little Italy and Mulberry St in NYC. My husband ordered chicken parm with penne. It too was amazing. Now I find myself craving this food every minute of the day. I am going on for a kidney transplant next week, but you better believe this will be my last big meal before surgery. I can&#39;t wait! I am in love with this restaurant. P. S. Even the pasta fagioli was great."

They now open at 4pm except Sunday when they open at 2pm.Their web page has not been updated with this change and neither has Yelp. Found this out the hard way. Food is very good as I have been there several times and will go back. This review is just a warning to others not to waste their time driving out to this restaurant for lunch. There should at least be an update to their webpage regarding their new &#34;summer hours.&#34; Maybe some more bad reviews will spur them to action.

Our second visit surpassed the first. We gathered a group of friends and descended on them for lunch. They escorted us into a private room that was so cozy and comfortable. This time my husband and I had the veal parmesan and it was superb. Not only was the food great but a basket of warm bread, olive oil dip, olives and a plate of cheese, salami and peppers with balsamic vinegar was served before the meal. Who does this? Capri."

Surprised at reviews since I found the portion sizes to be rather skimpy for an Italian restaurant, with the exception of a chicken dish.  Furthermore, the house salad was disappointing - there must have been 3 lettuce leaves, max.  Unfortunately, I found this place to be just ok.  Much prefer the Capri in Burr Ridge which I find outstanding every single time."

The food is delicious and I&#39;d come here often all the time over the weekends. I&#39;d recommend the creamy soup such as chicken or broccoli and little did you know if you order a full dinner you can replace the salad with an additional cup of soup if you don&#39;t like salad. I also recommend the steaks cooked medium it is delicious. 

Coming back soon :)"

Howeveeeer... This place is really outdated. Would not mind it but there&#39;s a strong smell right where you walk in: stinks. Then the bathroom (ladies) could definitely be more clean. 
And something else that bothered me is that the chairs are so big that people walking behind anyone at our table would have to squeeze by and still bump into us."

I hate giving small businesses bad reviews because they&#39;re so important to our economy but this place was just not good. Dirty floors, poor service, and greasy breakfast. I asked specifically for no oil or butter because it really upsets my stomach and I had to practically strain the oil off of my potatoes.

I ordered bacon  (limp-not burned), eggs over easy with hash browns and pancakes.  My daughter ordered bacon (well-done) scrambled w/cheese, well-done hash browns and well-done toast. Surprisingly,  everything came as ordered. Coffee cups were attentively refilled.

Wrong omelette came out, so I just had coffee while other person with me ate. We were in a hurry. Waitress took omelette away but left English muffin on the table. So, being hungry, I ate it dry. When check came, I was charged for the muffin a la carte and coffee. I asked if they planned on giving it to someone else. I asked why it wasn&#39;t removed with the omlette. I explained that since she left it there, I was sure it would be thrown out anyway. Absolutely no response. When I got to the register, the woman taking money was ruder than the waitress about it.  She made me pay. No apology from anyone for the wrong omlette either. This place is absolutely pathetic. I&#39;ll never go there again. Ever!

We enjoy driving past the restaurant and reading the menu board to each other over the phone since their 3 specials always seem to be so hilariously incompatible with each other (for example - Chicken Teriyaki, Stuffed Cabbage, Pork Fajitas). OK, maybe we&#39;re the only ones that find this hilarious. But all of that menu reading made us eventually want to try the place.

We ended up going for breakfast on Friday and it was good. The bread basket they bring before the meal was some tasty bread. I got the egg white veggie omelette. It was good, not great, a little less flavor than I&#39;m used to. I asked for a little bit of cheese and I got a lot of cheese, but that was easy enough to eat around. The fresh fruit I got on the side was actually a better variety than I expected - probably a good 6 different types. My husband got a pineapple filled with chicken salad. His brunch was much better than mine, it was a half pineapple cut up with this really awesome chicken salad inside. I don&#39;t even like chicken salad and I could&#39;ve eaten it all.

The waitress was nice, nothing special bad or good about the service.

Overall, I&#39;d say most everything was right in the average category except the delicious chicken salad in the pineapple. So order that one. Maybe it&#39;ll be on special with spaghetti bolognese and samosas next week."

If I am not craving anything specific, I enjoy going to a standard diner/family restaurant. Their menus are never all that different from one another and you pretty good idea on what to expect when you step in the door and sit down for a meal. This place is the poster child for this kind of establishment in my mind. 

The place is a good size and kept clean. The booths and the dining area were very comfortable and not crowded together. There was not anything at all that particularly stood out in this place as far as decor is concerned but I really didn&#39;t care. Our server did a very good job taking care of us. I have absolutely no complaints.

Their menu is quite extensive as typically found in these types of places. I ordered two eggs over easy, gyro meat, hash browns, and pancakes instead of toast. As far as flavor is concerned, nothing really blew me away but everything was very tasty. Although I was hungry when I walked in here, by the time I was  of the way done, my belly felt like it was going to bust! I was a very satisfied customer. I was even more satisfied when bill came. I was very pleased that I was able to partake in that size and good quality of meal for such a reasonable price.

I can officially add this place to my mental list of solid places to go for a good meal at a reasonable price. It did not let me down and I am looking forward to my next visit when I am in the area!"

The chocolate pie was nasty, can&#39;t believe I wasted $14 on it. Should&#39;ve just drove to Jewel and got their actual french silk for $8. It&#39;s much better.

I especially enjoy the greek salad, the rueben sandwich, and the top flite gyros.  The soups of the day are usually cream based-cream of brocolli, cream of mushroom,etc.  They must buy cream base in 55 gallon drums, and I would agree with a previous review relative to the hesitancy to dispose of stale rolls.

I have been to other tapas restaurants in the Chicagoland area and this is the best I have ever had.

The restaurant isn&#39;t huge and reservations are taken and recommended.  Because tapas is an experience, dining can take awhile.  

We got a variety of things to try and everything was good and would be worth of a second order should the opportunity present itself:  The dishes we had were the sauteed escargot, dates wrapped in bacon, grilled calamari and something they had on special that were venison empanadas.  We also had the sangria, which was delicious and the baked pineapple dessert which was interesting.

Red Sangria was tasty-good balance of sweet and alcohol.   

Food was really good with one great item-the bacon wrapped dates, which were perfect-larger and better cooked bacon than at the best tapas restaurant in Chicago and the entire area-hint, it&#39;s in Naperville.

The garlic potato salad was excellent and the baked goat cheese and tomato dish with toast points was as well.   Meat items were tasty-well cooked tender selections with great sauces and vegetable garnish.

Let&#39;s get wild and pass some plates around!

Emilio&#39;s has hosted several family gatherings for us over the past decade, and on every instance the visit has been met with the consistent quality and friendliness we&#39;ve come to expect from them.

I should mention, though, that my mom&#39;s social circle of restaurateurs and foodie acquaintances allows me to say that I know the owner.....by a few degrees of separation.  As it turns out, our good friends Jeff G &amp; Janet G knew the namesake proprietor back when he first opened this Spanish eatery back in 1988.  They dined here nearly every week and my parents joined them on many occasions, so my family&#39;s affinity for Emilio&#39;s runs deep.

They pride themselves on a kitchen that offers plate after plate of delicious share-able food.  While main entrees are available, I highly recommend getting a bunch of smaller items to split amongst the table, as this allows you to try a greater variety of unique and delectable dishes.

Most recently, we came here for Sunday night dinner and once again enjoyed some of the best tapas in the Chicago area.  I arrived late (what a shocker!) but was happy to sample a small dish of garlic potatoes and another of chicken curry.  Following that, our table ordered a carne asada which was cooked medium rare and served with potato shoestrings and mixed greens.  Dessert is what impressed me the most, though.

The five of us ordered a tasty trio: molten chocolate lava cake, caramelized banana, and a blueberry bread pudding.  The latter got rave reviews, which was the perfect amount of sweet/tart and came served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Molten choco cake was on-point, and I&#39;m told the banana was great (I missed out, because I&#39;m slow &amp; clueless).

Our server did a nice job, whose mother had apparently been the first employee Emilio ever hired some 27 years ago.  So that&#39;s a pretty cool snippet of history.

Bread = 4.5
Circuses = 4.5

Out of 270 reviews, a 4.5 aggregate rating for Emilio&#39;s is pretty damn good.  This indicates user opinions are &#34;very favorable&#34; and nothing I&#39;ve experienced here would lead me to say otherwise.  Food&#39;s great, staff is great, and chances are your experience here -- be it a birthday celebration or casual dinner -- will also be great.

This family favorite in Hillside has been around for decades, and I&#39;m very happy to hear that they&#39;re reporting great revenue figures for 2016.

It a bit of a drive but well worth it.   Everything was delicious.  I wish I can make some of these dishes @ home.  But preparation would take a while. So it&#39;s easier to be served.  It&#39;s almost as good as going to Spain without a he flight

There were about 8 of us for many of us it was our first time at a tapas restaurant. What a great experience who would have thought that so many small plates will fill you up to the extreme. The Spanish paella was fantastic that alone could be a meal by itself. The selection of wines was very good and our server and the rest of the staff were awesome highly recommended.

Every single plate we ordered was really good. I dont even know what to write. Just go here and check it out. It isnt super expensiveness and the portions are  normal Tapas sizes. Patio area is super cool and made eating there even better. 

Only funny thing is the bathrooms are marked in Spanish. But they are big Spanish words I didnt know. I have no clue what bathroom is guys or girls."

We were looking for a nice place to eat and came across Emilio&#39;s Tapas and I am so glad we did! The food and service here is outstanding. So great, we came back here the following month during another conference. 

For starters, you get some bread and butter. You also get a bite size dish for each person as an appetizer that varies per day.

Things to try:
Calamari con ajo y limon (grilled calamari with garlic, lemon and EVOO) - This dish is possibly the best calamari I&#39;ve ever had. I got this on two separate occasions. The calamari is so soft! The garlic, lemon and EVOO goes perfectly with it and is so good, you&#39;ll be tempted to lick the plate! (Just use the bread instead!)

Paella - Very delicious! Lots of flavors and textures. There was a lot of it even for a single portion. 

Sangria - You can get a great sampler trio of these. 

Overall, a great place for a meal. Excited to go back!"

Patatas bravas horrible!!! They were undercooked and the sauce was like minestrone sauce on top of them. Not spicy no mayo nothing to do with traditional patatas bravas. 

Tuna stuffed canelone was good but 9 dollars!!!! It was a sheet of pasta stuffed with canned tuna the size of my pinky finger. It had diced tomatoes on the side. This dish was good but it&#39;s worth like 4-5 dollars it&#39;s ridiculous. 

Gambas al ajillo Were gross !!!!! They were swimming in grease and had absolutely no taste they were bland!!! Another rip off dish 5 shrimp for 9 dollars!!! Seriously 

Seafood pasta was another joke. It was so bland I finally gave up and asked for a salt shaker!!  

Stuffed mushrooms were ok, pulpo a la plancha was ok, flan was ok. 

I had never had to reach for a salt shaker at a tapas restaurant. They are removed from the table like it&#39;s an insult to add salt to their horrible bland food.

This is another gimmick well located restaurant. There is nothing around for miles. If you want good tapas you have to go up north. This is like the senior citizen version of Cafebabareeba !!! Insult to tapas..."

I was very pleasantly surprised to enjoy Emillion&#39;s in Suburbia!! 

My favorite was sautéed scallops in tomato saffron sauce, what a amazing combination!  Everything we ordered was delicious.  Ambiance isn&#39;t world class, and from first look restaurant might appear small, it&#39;s pretty big with back room which isn&#39;t visible at first.

Staff is very friendly, they noticed our group liked extra spicy food and sent a plate of grilled peppers on the side.  We also received one tapas which wasn&#39;t on the menu as complimentary to try from the chef.  

This type of service, taste or friendly staff is unheard of at any Chicago Locations!!  I&#39;ll be returning to Emillio&#39;s in suburbia if i&#39;m in the area again!"

I&#39;m really not sure Louis G ate at the same places. We all loved the patatas bravas and loved them!

I had a flight of sangria, since they have 5 flavors: that was fun, but I still preferred the red one. :-)

We ordered a selection of the desserts too, all fantastic. I would say this place is family friendly because of the atmosphere and the noise level (high) but the toddler that was with us didn&#39;t like the food too much, picky phase maybe.

I think the typical age range that I notice is usually 30-60 years old. Which is probably what kept me away for so long...(I&#39;m old now so I fit right in lol) I don&#39;t remember the food at all the first time. The only thing I remembered about this place was my sister telling me about the guy sitting behind her who was on a blind date set up by co-workers and for whatever reason he kept talking about how he really enjoyed having sex....lol..at 17 this was straight hilariousness to me. (Is this what I have to look forwarded to when I grow up? lol)

Being that this is a  5 min drive for me. Yelp kept throwing it as the number 1 spot in my face every time I searched with the app...so they got me to look lol Read something about Happy hour and figure why not update my experience with this place.

The food was amazing. Sharing 10 tapas across two people for only $20 was pretty sweet deal to me. I&#39;m always disappointed I can never find a place within a 5 min drive that basically isn&#39;t everyday fast food joints. So I&#39;m very ecstatic that I&#39;ve rediscovered this place.

I think the happy Hour is a great way to test out the food to give you an idea of what to order for lunch/dinner. I&#39;m pleased with this place where I&#39;m already thinking about coming here for my birthday....8 months from now.

About 3 minutes after ordering I asked for one of the tapas (garlic potato salad) to be replaced with a different tapas. When the food was brought out I was for sure that tapas had not been replaced. Although my waiter assured me it wasn&#39;t the potato salad. I was still skeptical up until trying it out while she stood there and I was wrong lol my fault.  What surprised me was the waiter brought out the potato salad free of charge just to point out the difference and why it was good. (and it was)

I had the peach margarita that I thought was good and refreshing. Not everyday you see peach on the menu. Wanted a mango for 2nd drink but was told they had ran out. Most  specialty drinks cost $9.Beer about $5 The only slight drawback I had with my drink is that I thought the highball glass was small for a margarita. for $9 I was expecting a 24oz glass not 14oz (not a bartender so I&#39;m guessing don&#39;t quote me :D )"

Tables are close together in a relatively small space.  The foods ordered when we were there were a fish-based soup which was quite good, and a number of tapas plates which were shared.  Included in the selections were halibut, mushroom, and chicken wings as well as a tomato-based dip which was soaked up bits of bread.  The wings and tomato-based dip were quite good.  Also, ample amounts of bread and butter are brought to the table to help fill you up.  For a satisfying meal, sodas - but no desserts - for ten people, the bill was about $200 plus tip.  The service is adequate.  The biggest drawback is the crowded tables."

I don&#39;t know if I should be annoyed with Yelp or the business. I&#39;m all excited to taste the food that has rave reviews and I place the order for take out and I ask for the pork medallions with potatoes dinner.  When I get home I have something totally different, so I call and it seems the host doesn&#39;t know the menu so in addition to trying to find out what it is I have, I&#39;m being placed on hold several times..... why she finds out why I didn&#39;t get what I asked for.

I kind of blame myself because I should have checked before I left but she should have told me that they didn&#39;t have it when I ordered it. 

I don&#39;t even know how the food tastes because I&#39;m soo annoyed right now that I don&#39;t even want to eat it. I don&#39;t get an apology just, &#34;the menu I ordered off of is an old one and they can make me what I asked for if I I want to some back and get it.

They lost a customer before even getting one.

My wife and I were fasting for Ramadan and asked the waitress if she could try to have the food ready according to the time that we break fast. The timing and service we received were more than we could have expected. We obviously understand food preparation times cannot always be coordinated as we wish, but it was perfect! 

The family and traditional vibes were priceless. We were having conversations across tables with other guests, it was such a nice open atmosphere. We really had a lot of fun.

I&#39;ve always enjoyed dining there but I was very curious to see what a true Spaniard would have to say about the food. I was told by him that the food was not only genuine, it was also outstanding which is high praise indeed as he travels the world and his dined at many excellent restaurants within his home country.

Chef Emilio himself was there to greet us and the bread and circuses were both phenomenal. My favorites were the Paiea, the bacon wrapped dates, and the banana dessert but once again, everything was well prepared and tasty."

But it&#39;s well worth it. The atmosphere is very Spanish with a bar, another room of tables, and some outdoor seating. Great casual ambience for a date or talking with friends.

The service is very attentive, and there is constantly someone taking empty plates from your table or filling your water. 

I&#39;ve been here twice and I highly recommend the sangria (any of them. They have like 5 kinds), or the unique Spanish beers they carry that you don&#39;t see very often. 

In terms of food, I adore tapas. I always want to try everything on everyone&#39;s plate anyway, so this gives me a socially acceptable excuse! I love that there are always plenty of little plates piled in the middle of the table so you can switch out whenever you need a new one. 

First, if you love garlic (I do) get the garlic potato salad. It is garlic extreme, but it is also amazing! The grilled shrimp are great, the cannoli with tuna that also had other ingredients mixed in was fantastic, and came with a very mild, yet  complimentary vinaigrette and tomato pieces. Basically, both times I&#39;ve been here, I was never disappointed. I don&#39;t think you can go wrong with selections. They do also have nightly specials, which we got the smoked salmon with dill sauce, capers, red onions, and toast points. Fantastic .

For dessert we had the puff pastry filled with vanilla ice cream and covered in some sort of heavenly chocolate sauce. Along with that we both had the cafe cortado. The espresso was wonderful with great flavor. 

In summary, if you&#39;re anywhere near here, this place is wonderful, relatively inexpensive, has great service, a great bar, and is a very tasty dining experience you won&#39;t forget."

 We were seated by the hostess and as we are walking to the table I said,  I brought gluten free bread for my child and she said &#34; I guess we can make an exception this time&#34;. What??? She was serious too! That irked me a bit andi thought it was an odd thing to say.  If you don&#39;t have a gf bread option what&#39;s the big deal? 

Our server came by after a while and took our drink order then went back to the bar. It took forever.  Then she took our cold tapas order.  The pacing was so slow so we ordered another drink.  I realized after she was gone a while that she was making drinks for all of her tables behind the bar... while the hostess stood around doing nothing.  Not pre-bussing. Not filling water.  Nor helping bartend. I&#39;m giving 3 stars because the cold apps were delicious. 
After cold apps were done it was 8pm and we had been there over an hr having yet to order hot tapas . We asked for our check, told her it was taking too long, got in the car and got a couple of chik fill a&#39;s from Lombard on the way home.  Now that&#39;s a 5 star place!"

Ambiance was quiet enough for normal conversation, and lighting was low. White table clothes (with white paper covers) and attractive place settings lend a refined feel. Dress was casual--more towards business causal than T-shirt and shorts, however!

Service was excellent--empty dishes were instantly cleared, and at no time was our conversation abruptly interrupted by a server. The courses came out at a good pace--bread, cold tapas, hot tapas, desert.

My coworker and I shared 6 tapas (3 cold, 3 hot), and we each had our own dessert. Honestly, this amount would have fed three, but was just right for two hungry men.

No two tapas were remotely similar--the variety was truly wide-ranging.

The Spanish Tuna Salad over avocado was a surprising standout among cold tapas--topped with a hint of lemon and a large shrimp, it made a flavorful mouthful from ingredients I wouldn&#39;t have imagined in the same meal, let alone the same dish.

The roasted salmon over artichokes was another standout--this one among the hot tapas. I would have this for the salmon alone, but a bit or two of artichoke was definitely complementary. Fish was crisp on the outside and moist in the inside, and crusted with a very mildly spicy rub.

Finally, the flan was the genuine article, flavorful and sweet without overwhelming the tastebuds with excess sugar.

A gem of a restaurant, and on a Thursday evening the place was buzzing, but not so busy we had to wait for a table."

Service was awesome.... Luz, our server... Was friendly and gave us lots of recommendations ...

We started with a Tapas Frias ( cold tapa appetizer )

Cecina de vanado $10.50 -- lightly smoked venison w cranberries manchengo cheese cherries 5/5

This is delicious... It&#39;s carpaccio style.. Refreshing and no game-y taste at all...

Then we got a couple of Tapas Calientes ( hot appetizer )

Queso de Cabra Al Horno $8.95 -- baked goat cheese 4/5 ... We love different kinds of cheese... Goat cheese is one of our favorites ... Baked goat cheese is just a whole upscale level

Caracoles Emilio $7.95 -- escargot on croutons 4/5...
Tad bit salty for my taste but definitely tasty

Datiles con Tocino $7.95 -- dates wrapped in bacon 
5/5.... Anything with bacon is good right?!

Paella a La Mariscos $19.95 -- seafood 5/5.... Anything that&#39;s flavorful without being salty is impressive to me... 

Btw... This needs to be pre ordered... Takes 30 mins to cook -- perfect timing though.... If you order maybe 4-5 small plates before expecting this dish to be served....

For some odd reason .... The timing of all the plates were served perfect timing... We were not rushed at all....

Then we ordered Delicia de tres satires $7.50 ... Three layered chocolate mouse of some sort with raspberry sauce on the side --- light and decadent 4/5

Cappuccino was good with this dessert...

Our bill was $103.... With a Castillo de Monjardin wine bottle --- not pricey at all... 

Noticed that 95% of their guests are Caucasians .....  We were the only minority.... Me being Asian and my BF being black ( half Italian )....

Very interesting .... We do not go to Hillside much... Don&#39;t know the demographics ... Just an observation though .... Everyone was friendly here --- both the servers, managers and guests....

I cannot wait to try everything else... Will be back!!"

Tried the paella Valencia last night.  It was quite good featuring chicken,  shrimp and some very large mussels.
We sat in their outdoor patio and there was live music,  something we didn&#39;t recall evr seeing before. Two musicians who go by the name Montage played a great assortment of Spanish flamenco and other styles.  We&#39;ll try to get back soon on a Friday just to hear those guys."

Our server tried her level best to make sure it went well but not upto the level of service you would want. 
A table which sits 4 people was fairly small and hard to keep more than one dish. 
The patata bravas was one of the worst...we have tried tapas at lot of restaurants and also in Spain and this was not even close to any of them. I give it a -5 points for this dish.
The other dishes were fairly okay not great. 
The paella ordered by our server was the wrong and she came in and told us it will be 15 more min to get the correct one.
At the end the check was messed up too, she charged us for the wrong paella luckily we checked and realized. 
Overall not worth going again!!"

I was am very fortunate to have an amazing family that loves food as much as I do.  My cousins drove in from the city to take me out, one snowy Saturday night.  Luckily they made a reservation.  The place was still busy at 8:45pm, but it was the day after Valentine&#39;s.  

1. QUESO DE CABRA AL HORNO - baked goat cheese in tomato sauce w/ garlic bread
2. PATATAS CON ALIOLI - potato salad was way TOO GARLICKY...you know when it&#39;s actually spicy, so there&#39;s no way anyone would even consider kissing you?
3. DÁTILES CON TOCINO - dates wrapped in bacon.  I&#39;m usually not a huge fan of dates EVER, but these were AMAZING!  Sweet dates - crispy outside and soft inside and crispy, salty bacon that are accompanied by a perfect sauce.  
4. PAELLA A LA MARISCOS (for 2) - **This was ordered first, since it takes 30 minutes to make.  Worth the Wait!  Loved the seafood.  It was really unfortunate, the three of us were pretty full when the paella arrived.  I wished I had saved room for more.  

The sangria was disappointing.  3- 2oz. tastings for 10.95?  not worth it.  I&#39;ve had sangrias all over the country.  The ones I tried were how to put it??...boring.  I had the red, white, and raspberry - all simplistic and one-dimensional."

Perhaps it was a combination of the company, food and the patio. Either way, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll take their 5 stars any way they can get it. 

 I&#39;ll start by saying the menu is humongous. There are way too many items to choose from. Seems like we spent 15 minutes reading the menu like you were trying to find the answer to the teacher&#39;s question before everyone else did. If you did not participate on class, just play along. ....We almost fell into the trap of ordering way too many because everything sounded so good. It&#39;s a relief that we narrowed it down as not to ruin the rest of our evening with stomachs tight enough to pop. 

Friday night dinner date. We arrived around 8p and the place was packed. There was a ten minute wait or immediate seating available at the bar or on the patio. We chose the covered patio and hoped for no drizzles. After all, the forecasters could be right some of the time. 

The weather was ideal and the soft music piping through the outside speakers was a real treat.

Here&#39;s our list: 
Traditional Paella = 4 stars
Chicken, chorizo &amp; mushroom = 5 stars
Grape leaves w/ rice = 4 stars 
Tuna salad and avocado = 5 stars
 

You are given bread, butter and marinated mushrooms to start. I only tried the mushrooms and they were knock your socks off good."

As a celiac disease sufferer, Emilio&#39;s Tapas is one of the very few restaurants I trust. Chef Emilio and his kitchen staff are well-versed on the ins and outs of proper preparation. Not to mention the fact that chef Emilio has always used premium ingredients for all his INCREDIBLE recipes!

Recommended dishes include the bacon wrapped dates with heavenly red pepper sauce, patata con aioli (how do they do it?!) the charcuterie board (that Serrano ham! The olives! The Manchego cheese!) and oh yes, the beef croquettes. Not to mention whatever specials the chef recommends AND the sangria. OH, also, they have the best tawny port I&#39;ve had in my life there.

My wife and I decided to come over to Emilio&#39;s about a month ago. I&#39;ve lived in the area my entire life yet have never decided to stop in. Thanks to Yelp we saw the positive reviews and decided to give it a shot. We were seated instantly on a Thursday night by a polite hostess. The wait staff was great - the explained the menu and gave great recommendations. 

Not only is the food gah damn fantastic but it is priced fairly. The biggest problem I find is that you just want to gorge yourself when you look at the menu because everything looks good - and frankly you don&#39;t have to because I feel the portions are generous - even for tapas. 

If you&#39;re on the fence about it, just cross on over. It&#39;s a great experience that I would highly recommend. As far as I&#39;m concerned they have my patronage for life."

My favorite was the tomato and goat as it was creamy and I like the olives if you wanted it a little saltier, also they gave you a good portion of goat cheese.  My next favorite was the grilled calamari, cooked to perfection and lightly season. You can&#39;t go wrong with bacon wrapped dated but I wasn&#39;t a fan of the potatoes bravo, a little mushy but good favor. The least favorite and I probably would not order it again was the lam chop, it had a strong gamey odor and favor so that ended my taste for lamb for several months."

The good:
I feel like at a Tapas restaurant is when reviews come most in handy since you&#39;re buying several items some of them are bound to be great and some not to your liking. My favorites were the warm tapas on the specials menu; Lamb Chops and Goat Cheese on Eggplant. The Lamb Chops had good fat marbelization that made it especially tender and juicy. I really like the combination of goat cheese and eggplant because they are both so soft. The orange sauce they put around it is delicious!

Could have been better:
There were a few tapas that were not so great either. I was not a big fan of the bruschetta served on a yellow tomato although it would have been better at the start of the tapas rather than after all our meats. I liked the cold tapas Serrano Ham and Manchego Cheese but thought it was a bit much for $16.
Although the marinated octopus was good I felt like the veggies and sauce around detracted from its flavor.

I am not a big fan of the décor although I don&#39;t&#39; think it detracted from our experience, it reminds me of the wild style at Bucca di Beppo.

Desert:
I&#39;m really into chocolate and thought the chocolate raspberry dessert was to die for. The chocolate is fluffy like a mouse and goes well with the raspberry puree around it.

Overall great place will definitely be back again."

Our server Alfredo was standing,  patiently waiting to serve us. I had asked about the wine list and he said no you want to order from this list here they are all 50% off tonight.   Well later on after we had enjoyed ordering several small entrées we decided to get another bottle of wine. When he brought it back to the table he said you do know this and the last bottle are $32 per bottle.  Right then I realized we were mislead. The price on the menu was originally $32, according to his statement they should have been $16 per bottle, mind you we found those bottles available for $7.99.
That was really the only thing that ruined my night. I left there feeling I was taken advantage of. :("

I love getting blotto on sangria at the bar while eating the tapas on a quite Saturday afternoon.
And finally, I love the banana dessert.
Oh, and I love that the staff makes fun of the drunk blond girls at the bar sharing the very phallic banana dessert covered in nuts and caramel with a dollop of ice cream on either side of the banana. 
Well played kitchen staff, well played.
I happily play into stereotypes for a good laugh.

Wonderful, classy, cozy establishment. Good vibe inside. The staff is friendly and helpful, and they know what they are talking about. We like to ask their preferences. Sangria is tasty, and the tapas selection is broad. One of my favorites is the Pinche de Pollo al Mojo (chicken with a garlic &amp; cumin sauce). Simple and delicious. You could dip your shoe into the garlic cumin sauce and it would be delicious. Last time we tried a dish that may have been on their features menu - it was similar to chicken piccata and was absolutely divine. The potatoes that came with the dish melted in our mouths. I hope that this is a dish that is there again when we go back. I&#39;d also really like to try their paella. 

We try a range of dishes and are impressed every time. The first time we visited Emilio&#39;s we had a fruit flan for dessert and it was so good I wanted to order a second. Freakin&#39; wonderful.

What makes the  experience different?  I&#39;ll start with the physical space.   Mariano&#39;s is open and inviting.   There is something about walking in the main entrance that makes you aware of all the exiting options that lay ahead, depending on which direction your fee carry you.  If you are lucky you will be greeted by an employee offering you a sample of their famous fresh squeezed orange juice.  They are wisee to do this; it is practically inhuman to take a sip and not follow it up by tossing a container or two into your cart.   

Are you hungry right now?  They say never shop on an empty stomach.   No problem.   You have your pick...fresh salad bar, hamburgers and other meats made to order, enticing baked goods, a sushi bar, freshly made smoothies...the list goes on.  Help yourself and choose where you would like to munch .  My favorite is the atrium reminiscent of the  tropical dining area at navy pier. 

Marianos is set up to please today&#39;s eating culture.  It offers many partially or fully made dinner options at fair prices.   The employers all genuinely seem to be happy to be there and help you out.   They are knowledgeable about the products in their area.   

Obviously, I could go on amd on singing their praises.   Instead, I  encourage you to indulge in the experience yourself.   I&#39;m guessing you will be hooked, too."

It&#39;s Mariano&#39;s; the place that has had every grocery store in the area shaking in their boots while the new location was under construction. The place with the ridiculously legit food court, a trail mix station, a guac station, an oyster bar, and the second snobbiest cheese area I have ever seen (shout out to Standard Market for the cheese cave!) 

It&#39;s Mariano&#39;s; the place that has all of these awesome (and questionably useful) amenities yet still manages to have comparable prices to the Jewels of the world (still hate you, Jewel!!) The staff is always friendly. The LaCroix displays are impressive. The popcorn is good. The fresh juice is verrrrry good.

I noticed people were MUCH more cautious with this issue. Team Members seem more attentive to the hot bar &amp; grill areas as it relates to this subject. 

As for the rest:
1. Cheese selection is fantastic.
2. BIG fan of the Sicilian pizza. It&#39;s almost a cousin to the deep dish but different crust. 
3. Nice spot to get peppers (hot in particular). Some places are somewhat beat up, not here. 
4. The brisket and (in particular) the sauces are also good. I don&#39;t think other grocery stores can come close to this. Same with the pizza.
5. MAYBE beef up the staff (e.g., more bodies) working in the deli during peak times. This may help with the longer waiting times but it&#39;s about the same wherever you may go. 

No place is perfect, but this works for me. Great selection and a good flow to the place. A keeper for me."

If you&#39;re familiar with the Wheaton store the layout will look somewhat recognizable to you, with a few additions: the Naperville location also has an oyster bar, wine bar and spice market (it seems a little weird that open baskets of rice and quinoa are just sitting out; the spices are in big open dishes but are covered by a salad bar sneeze guard kind of thing from the general open air). Like Wheaton, there&#39;s sushi, BBQ, a smoothie stand, and gelato.

It&#39;s a testament to the functionality of the store&#39;s traffic flow pattern that on today, the first day when it was mobbed with people, it was still fairly easy to maneuver around and we were never completely stymied or bottlenecked, even in places where vendors were giving out samples and taking up space with tables. 

I previously shopped in the Wheaton and Aurora stores, and this location seems to be consistent with brands (among other things, I was glad to find Vernors ginger ale by the case [vs. 2 liter] here: Wheaton stopped carrying it, but Aurora still has it). I particularly like Mariano&#39;s for meat and indeed bought a chuck roast today, and their bakery is also top-notch (try the all-butter chocolate chip cookies!)

Service was a little harried today, which isn&#39;t surprising as it was pretty crazy; in her haste, the clerk who checked me out forgot to run my coupons (which ended up being a couple of dollars). But the customer service desk was able to painlessly do a refund for a simple solution. (Still, be mindful...) Overall, though, they really were on top of things: staff was everywhere, even the Executive Chef!

Another big plus to this location: parking is SO much better than Wheaton or Aurora!! 

Well, I know already that I will be here all the time. See if you agree with me! Welcome to Naperville, Mariano&#39;s!!"

For example, someone was checking the stock of the cheese in that department and when I was wondering if they had a particular kind, she immediately wrote it down so they could order it. They have all kinds of interesting little departments and places to eat and drink, including a nice bar. Need olive oil? I&#39;ve NEVER seen this many kinds in one place.

Minuses: The meat department. I had to wait forever for them to bring out more ground chuck, although they were very nice about it. But I really feel like the staff in the meat department doesn&#39;t really know anything about meat. One tried to sell me some little fatty piece of brisket to add to my other piece so that I&#39;d have enough poundage as requested. I would have had to throw that away. And today I paid about $15/pound for organic Scottish salmon. When I opened it to make it for dinner, it was obviously nowhere near fresh. Pee-yew. 
Other minuses: the store layout is weird, and you get trapped in the floral department. The international aisles require that you just go in and look because the signage in there isn&#39;t clear at all. Does &#34;Pisa&#34; mean that the Italian items are here? Not necessarily.
Biggest minus: price. I price check, and they are consistently a little or a lot higher than other places.

Why do I come here? Convenience. When I am in the area, or short on time, I&#39;ll go to Mariano&#39;s rather than make separate runs to Trader Joe&#39;s + Fresh Thyme + Casey&#39;s + Target. All those other stores beat Mariano&#39;s hands down for various items. But sometimes, you just don&#39;t have time to run all around! Plus grocery shopping isn&#39;t entertainment for me; I&#39;d like to get my things and get out."

They also have salad bar, hot bar, bbq and grill court, oyster bar, and a wine bar.  Plan to try them in the coming weeks.  

Tried the hot bar.  Not bad.  Had mostly fried cod.  It was very good (hard to find a decent fried fish these days.  This was as good as most restaurant fish offerings.  If there IS a good one somewhere, please tell me about it).  Also good were the mac and cheese and roasted brussel sprouts.  They did not have malt vinegar for the fish@  Seriously?"

Since Mariano&#39;s has opened, I&#39;ve noticed that other nearby chains have stepped up their game to compete, offering sushi, fresh squeezed orange juice in almost the same exact bottle with label, hot foods bars with similar items, etc, etc, etc...

So Mariano&#39;s is great for the neighborhood. But what I like best about Mariano&#39;s is the warm fresh ambiance that sets it apart from the typical chain. My favorites are the 3 flavored popcorn that they sell near the fresh breads, the salad bar where I load up on various toppings, and the rotisserie chicken that is tasty like no other.

The employees are generally efficient but I have found them to be a bit impersonal and standoffish, and the prices are a bit high. However, I enjoy shopping here and I&#39;m glad to have another option in the neighborhood!"

While I&#39;m glad to see Dominicks gone and Mariano&#39;s take it&#39;s place, I&#39;m only giving this store a 3-star rating for the time being.  They really need to work some kinks out of the service before I give them any more.

The good: brand-new store built from the ground up.  They hired lots of really good employees- I find the checkout people to be really friendly and quick.  There&#39;s a huge selection of everything, and the store layout is like every other Mariano&#39;s.  The popcorn stand and the cheese &#34;cave&#34; are definitely the two best parts of the store.

The OK: the produce section is really well-stocked.  I have found frequently that produce I buy here goes bad after only one or two days.  This is not acceptable.  I don&#39;t have this issue with the Wheaton or Westchester stores, but I have also found that Aurora&#39;s store has this issue.  Why?  Prepared foods are average, sometimes they are lacking both variety and quality.  I have gotten to the point that I rarely eat here anymore since the quality is hit-or-miss.

The bad: the deli.  There&#39;s never less than a 10 person wait.  It&#39;s like going to the freaking DMV.  I think they need to really train the people at the deli counter to work a little quicker or something.  It&#39;s beyond annoying.

Overall this store is a huge step-up from Dominicks and it&#39;s definitely better than any Jewel, but they shouldn&#39;t rest of the laurels of their reputation.  The other Mariano&#39;s in the area (Wheaton, Westchester, and Elmhurst) are better."

Biggest complaint was ordering a LB of brisket and getting a 1/2 of brisket and a 1/2 lb of sliced fat , I literally had 1 piece that was 90% solid fat., The person who made it had no care what she was giving me.  She also shorted me 1 side and I had to repeat my order 3-4 times.

I clearly remember the day that the Dominick&#39;s on that corner closed, just after Christmas, in 2013. It was predictable, as the lot had been nearly empty for many years. The service and prices at Dominick&#39;s were consistently deplorable! The parent company had lost their way in understanding Midwesterners.

It has seemed like every other suburb, from 2010 to now, was getting a Mariano&#39;s, except for Naperville, which perplexed me immensely. The first Mariano&#39;s that I visited was the one on North York Road in Elmhurst. I knew right away that Naperville needed one.

So, to this location in Naperville, I went with my partner, late on grand opening day. It was kind of crazy, but no regrets. I am most familiar with the Wheaton Mariano&#39;s, which I like immensely. This store has a similar layout. The polished concrete floors are beautiful.

The staff was consistently helpful and courteous under the very busiest of conditions. The south end of the store, where the Todd&#39;s BBQ is located, was the most packed. They were giving away free stuff, and samples, left and right. The liquor department is incredible, as is the deli and just about everything else. Even on OPENING DAY, we did not have to wait in line to checkout! Trying doing that at a Jewel store! If a staff member catches your eye, they will ask if you need any help.

In many ways, it seems like Mariano&#39;s has managed to keep the prices of its offferings in the reach of the middle-of-the road customer, AND maintain an upscale, bright and diverse shopping environment. There are plenty of gluten-free choices. While it offers some of the amenities and the vibe of Whole Foods, it is not the least self-righteous like Whole Foods, neither is it pricey. You&#39;ll find products that contain Aspartame and extra caffeine right along with stuff that is more &#34;natural&#34; in its composition.

I think that it was most appropriate that Mariano&#39;s chose to tear down the old building rather than just convert it, as they have with some other properties.

Even if you are a diehard fan of Jewel-Osco, challenge yourself to step away from the one across South Naper Boulevard, even just once, and give the new place in town a chance.

(May 30, 2016) Since I wrote the first part of this review, I have been frequently utilizing the service whereby one can choose a meat or piece of fish, and then have it properly grilled at Todd&#39;s BBQ. So far, the results have been restaurant quality delicious and grocery store inexpensive. I&#39;ve tried ribeye steak, seasoned salmon and burgers, and they have been grilled as desired. I can&#39;t wait to try more selections and to check out an alternate salmon selection. It&#39;s like getting quality restaurant food minus the big waits for a table, slow service, higher prices, ridiculous sales taxes on prepared food and guilt-driven tips for incompetent servers. Also, while the food is on the grill, it allows for time to shop for some tasty sides at the deli."

I rather just order sushi from a sushi place instead. It is not worth spending your money at Mariano&#39;s sushi place. 

This market is great but everything is overpriced in my opinion. If you afford spending a lot of $$ for groceries then go for it. The market is very clean and fresh. It is like another Whole Foods."

One of its much admired offering is a wide variety of prepared foods than can be consumed right there in a food-court like setup.  Many families use it during lunch and dinner times instead of going to a restaurant.  

We were there on a Saturday evening (around 9 PM) for a dinner of fresh sushi and the salad bar.  We were sitting and enjoying our meal when at an adjacent table 2 couples started to have a very heated conversation, one particular person in that group was very belligerent using extremely profane language that was offensive to many.  It appears they had consumed at least  2 bottles of wine which they bought at the store which also provided them formal stemware to consume it in the store.  

Apparently, the store does not have any restrictions on where and how the alcohol is consumed incl. in the food court where many young children are also present.  There is no monitoring by the store of drinkers on how much alcohol is consumed.  We were not the only people disturbed by the presence of this table, while others decided to pick up their food and move elsewhere, we decided to bring the matter to the attention of one of the store managers (James) who offered to call their store security.  We left the store since we didn&#39;t want have showdown so I am not sure if any things was done, but this has left a really bad taste on our mouth about eating in the food court (one of the only bright spots in the store)."

Plus a full grocery store.  Great produce selection, nice looking meats.  Delicious hot bar and soup bar and salad bar.   Great cheese section.

Several sampling stations.

Like a Whole Foods without exorbitant prices.  Very reasonable.  Will be heading back for sure"

Pros - Tons of choices for something to eat if you want to grab some dinner.  
-Food is usually good. 
-Good coupons in the mailer.  
-Really good deserts by the bakery (especially the cheesecake).

Cons -Stood at the sandwich counter for about 5 minutes wondering if I needed to take a number or stand somewhere else because no one was offering help.  
-The french? bread they use for sandwiches has a really strong taste that overpower anything and everything on the sandwich.  
-The 2 times I actually done shopped here (as opposed to just grabbing a quick something to eat) I waited about 5-10 minutes in line, and then they shut down the register I was waiting at due to technical difficulties.  Update: Make that 3 times.
-Managers take about 5 minutes to come ring up alcohol for the kids at the register. 
-And lastly the staff seems to have no clue what&#39;s in their circular.
-I saw a manager through a garbage bag on the ground right in a high traffic area.  I still can&#39;t fathom what she was thinking."

A couple of seats opened up so we sat at the bar to eat.  We started with cheese curds and fried pickles. Both were great and the appetizer portions were substantial.   After another round of beers (including my Nitro Old Chub), my buddy had the duck reuben and I had the filet mignon sliders.   He raved about the duct and my sliders were excellent.

My coworker and I went there to eat and watch the cubs game. The place was crowded! Having joined a larger group, we sat down and ordered an appetizer.

Having finished our appetizer, we placed an order for dinner. During that time, the larger group left. Not soon after does the host come over and say &#34;you guys need to leave, we need this table for a larger party.&#34;

Ok... I get it... it&#39;s a large table and only two of us remain. So we ask where we&#39;ll be reseated. She goes we don&#39;t have tables available, I&#39;ll go get the manager. The manager comes over and confirms that there are no tables available and we needed to leave the table.

So at this point, I&#39;m thinking as a courtesy, she&#39;d offer to pay for our appetizer or ask if she could box the food we just ordered and take it with us. NOPE! Not this women. She goes, of course you have to pay for the appetizer.

... if I had EVER asked a patron to leave their table, I would instantly pay for their $8 appetizer and offer them a drink at the bar while they waited for the next available seat.

Ooohh, in the name of beer.  

If you can excuse the Def Leppard pun, perhaps you too can have a rockstar experience at this Oak Brook bar &amp; restaurant.  Although it&#39;s not cheap by any means, it&#39;s far less likely to send you to the _poor_ house than the other nearby eateries (Perry&#39;s Steakhouse, Wildfire, Reel Club, Mon Ami Gabi, etc).

Meeting up fellow Brand Ambassador Olivia B for dinner one night, we sat &#39;al fresco&#39; and were thrilled to find that the outdoor patio was very lively.  Several other tables were already enjoying beer flights and we quickly followed suit.  OTPH features beer flights (4 brews at 6oz each) that can be grouped together by type -- wheat ales, porters, fruit/sours, pilsners -- or you&#39;re free to create your own.

The coolest part isn&#39;t the serving caddy (which itself is admittedly cooler than a wooden paddle) but rather the customized printouts that accompany your beers.  So regardless of whether you order a preset flight or pick-and-choose, you&#39;ll get a paper that identifies each one in turn, along with a beer-related quote by Benjamin Franklin, a well documented drinker/genius inventor/founding father/notable pervert.

After catching up on all things Yelp, we placed an order for food.  A very short time later, our crab fondue arrived.  It consisted of jumbo lump crab, goat cheese, chives, breadcrumbs, and came with garlic crostini ($14).  Delicious and surprisingly filling, something I&#39;d definitely order again on a future visit.

Not long after that the rest came out, to the tune of a wedge salad &amp; chili for me and a turkey burger for O.  Alas, my eyes were bigger than my stomach, so the majority of the wedge salad ($8) + chili came home with me to be consumed the next day.  Even ~18 hours later, the lettuce was still of passable quality and the blue cheese was ample.  Came with house cured lardons, a fancy term for premium bacon cubes.

The &#34;1871&#34; chili ($8) was made with angus steak, pork, chipotle peppers, flavored with milk stout, topped with crème fraiche and red onion relish, and served with a cornbread muffin!  It was an excellent value and totally delicious, something worth getting.

Unfortunately the good news ended there, as O&#39;s turkey burger had a piece of either plastic or bone in it which has a tendency to ruin one&#39;s appetite.  I felt bad for her (as did our attentive server, Elliot) so it got comped and came off of the final bill, which was the appropriate thing to do in this instance.  Aside from inedible bits of questionable origin, it came with mozzarella, avocado, cranberry chutney and fries ($12).

Bread = 4
Circuses = 4.5

I was impressed enough with the menu and atmosphere to warrant a return trip, and the beer flights were priced reasonably enough as to not break the bank.  Old Town Pour House is actually quite affordable if you order items to share, which is a great idea since the portions are sizeable.

So do you take your ale, 1 pint or 2??  Grab a bottle, mix it up!"

I ordered a New Holland Dragon&#39;s Milk and Fish n chips. When the food arrived i asked for extra tarter sauce and ketchup but the guy never came back and it took a while before my server came back for me to ask her for it.

The actual fish n chips came together in a small basket and looked more like cheese fingers. I also waited a hell of a long time for the bill.

All and all, be prepared to wait, the fish n chips and service were a bust but the beer was good."

Life has finally slowed down enough for me to write reviews once again :) came out to Pour House for a little family send off. First of all, kudos to them for handling a party of 20 on a Saturday night! Our server was great, offering great suggestions and was pretty knowledgeable about the cider menu. Personally I would have liked 2 servers since it took him a while to get through 20 orders while still taking care of another table or two, but again he did well!

I started off with a short pour of the Original Sin Cider. I appreciate that they have short pours of all their beers! This one was a great suggestion from our server, with a nice crisp green apple flavor. Ended up also trying sister&#39;s peace cider, which really tasted like biting into a ripe peach!

The table ended up ordering quite a few appetizers and starters:

Pretzel bites: pretty good bites....pretzels were soft and you could really taste the IPA in the sauce

Cheese curds: if you&#39;re looking for your good ol Wisconsin cheese curds, you will be disappointed. I think they should rename these as cheese fritters, to be more accurate. Delish....yes. Sadly, squeaky cheese curds they are not:(

1871 chili: ok....by FAR the best chili I&#39;ve had in a long time! This is a true Texas chili....aka NO BEANS! The addition of the creme fraiche is delish!

Short ribs: I had a hard time picking my dinner, but our server gave me great suggestions on everything I was considering. The short ribs were definitely the stick-to-your-ribs meal I was looking for since it was chilly today. The ribs were pretty tender, although a little dry on the outside. The bacon tomato jam was a good accompaniment to the beef, and it came with a pretty tasty au jus gravy which I&#39;m glad I got on the side. The star of the meal, however was the shrimp grits!! I could have eaten a whole BOWL of the grits and been perfectly happy! I&#39;m not sure what cream/cheese concoction they used for the grits but they were so creamy, seasoned perfectly, and came with pretty large pieces of shrimp!

The one downside was where we sat, which was right next to the door of the patio. Although perfect for corralling a toddler while still allowing her to roam around, the opening and closing of the door made for a chilly dinner :( 

Is this a keeper? Yes! And since the menu seems to change pretty frequently, it&#39;s always worth a try for some new flavors!"

When it first opened the service was terrible, food was disgusting and drinks were watered down. They&#39;ve come a long way and earned four stars easily! I stopped in Sunday evening for drinks on the patio. Love the patio because it has two fire places, TVs to watch sports (if you&#39;re in to that, I&#39;m not.) and wonderful service. We started off w/ the Chicago hot dog appetizer. A little funky, but good nonetheless. I ordered the basil lemonade drink, so delicious and a great size! Finished with the BBQ chicken salad, the chicken was great and seasoned perfectly with a slight kick. The crowd isn&#39;t the best, you get a pretty broad mix of annoying drunk girls and then also stuck up burb ladies.

old-town-pour-house-oak-brook-4,Nichole C.,6KWsC9r8s7aJZV4YUSuphQ,"Itasca, IL",1,1,1,221,37,2GGQn7RhtJilwr1xokBpxA,3.0,2016-02-07,"Man, I don&#39;t know if I hyped this place up too much before I came in but it totally fell short of my expectations. Here&#39;s why:

1. They do not have high chairs. Yes, I realize this isn&#39;t a &#34;family restaurant&#34; but people with babies like craft beer too. How are you going to have changing tables in the bathroom but not have high chairs to contain the beings who need said changing tables? (They do have boosters...which we never got either. I suppose we could&#39;ve asked again but it probably wouldn&#39;t have worked for us anyway.)

2. The beer list is extensive but if you&#39;re a beer snob you&#39;re still probably not going to find anything you haven&#39;t already tried. 

3. The food was just okay. I was expecting some gastropub worthy stuff and instead I got some overpriced bar food. The cheese curds were gross...too airy and salty and greasy. (And I love grease. It&#39;s just the breading was soaked in it. BLECH.) The Mac and Cheese was decent but not really truffly or big enough for the price. The only thing I was really impressed with was the filet sliders. If I ever come back here again, it&#39;s likely the only thing I&#39;d get. But again, they were overpriced. Seriously, we dropped $80 on three appetizers and two beers. That&#39;s just ridiculous. 

4. Service was good but not friendly at all. Everyone who works there pretty much hangs out at the bar or at that douchey station that I assume is for the front of house manager to sit in. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t want service to be in my face the entire time, but for the money I&#39;m putting down it would be nice to have it a little friendlier in there. 

5. Last is the parking situation. What the hell is going on over there? You pretty much have to valet for $4 (plus tip!) or park faaaaaaaarrrrrr away and walk because there&#39;s like 5 restaurants in a row with a parking lot big enough for 1 restaurant. 

Honestly, this place reminds me of an overly hyped Chicago &#39;gastropub&#39; that misplaced itself in the &#39;burbs and it&#39;s not worth your time. Or money. Unless you happen to be at Oakbrook (already parked elsewhere) and want to drink a good craft beer to dull the horror of shopping."

We sat outside in front of the fireplace and it was lovely, very cozy and intimate.  However, the ambience does not make up for the price tags of food.  The veggie burger was not flavorful and depended on the spiciness to make up for it.  It tasted like someone opened a can of beans and fried them up. The accompanying French fries were also overdone and limiting in taste.  Definitely not worth the $12 price tag.  My husband had the duck Reuben and stated he did not enjoy it.  $14 was definitely overpriced.  I may or may not go back, but if I do I will not order any food, only beverages."

We decided to make a reservation there based on their extensive craft beer menu... So many options! Loved that you could order samples of any draft beer. Tried several! 

As for food, we started with calamari and cheese curds for an appetizer. Both were good, but the cheese curds were my favorite! For an entree, I had the Duck Reuben. The flavor was most definitely there, but the duck was way too fatty. I wouldn&#39;t order that again. 

The restaurant seemed to be a hot spot around 5:30, though by the time we left, the rush seemed the be over. There were barely any reservation times available several days ahead (the options were 5:30 or 8), and there was pretty much no parking available anywhere near the restaurant. Another small complaint - the tables are super close to one another which was a little uncomfortable.

Overall, the experience was decent - would probably go back for drinks and an app while shopping at the mall. Not sure if I&#39;d go out of my way for a reservation though."

Expect the Oak Brook Pour House to be crowded during happy hour and evenings, just like the one in Old Town. However, because it is the burbs, the crowd starts lightening up at around 9 PM (sweet!)

Pour house has nearly 100 beers on draft which is way awesome. This is what keeps me coming back! It&#39;s so cool to see all the beer on tap behind the glass at the bar. I can&#39;t imagine what their energy bill is keeping all those kegs cold.

If you are overwhelmed by the selection of beer in the menu, just look for the card with seasonal specials! My recommendation is to get a beer flight, choosing 4 beers off this menu. 

I&#39;ve gotten a few of the food items off of the appetizer menu, and I remember them being good. I loved the filet sliders- they were fresh, and cooked to the perfect medium rare. My coworkers and friends talk about how good the food is too!

Highly recommend Pour House for a fun place for beer &amp; happy hour in the west burbs."

1st time I got the grilled cheese and truffle mac and cheese. Not a fan of either of them. No way.

2nd time I shared some appetizers:

Chicago Dog: YUM absolutely love this. A deep fried hot dog with unhealthy but tasty seasoning and awesome relish sauce

Pretzel Bites: Meh, average

Cheese Curds: Not really a fan

3rd time I came here again for appetizers:

Chicago Dog: Delicious as I remember!

Cheese Curds: Honestly, I forgot to write a review last time so I forgot that I do not like them. Now I will remember. =)

The only thing we ordered that was actually good was the cheese curds. 
I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, while my friend ordered their Pour House burger. We ordered some drinks and chatted for a while. The cheese curds came quite quickly. However, it took literally 40 minutes for the food to come. I don&#39;t know why it took so long, because it was 4:00 on a Saturday.
I was not impressed with the food at all. Pretty disappointed with it. 
My friend&#39;s burger looked sloppy. Just looked like a regular burger. The description of the Pour House burger was described as &#34;Handmade 8oz angus beef patty, aged white cheddar, lettuce, dill pickle, beer-battered onion ring, vine-ripened tomato, white grain bun&#34;.... and it lacked the onion ring and tomato.
Our waitress was no where to be found. 
Let&#39;s go to my pulled pork sandwich... I felt like Costco did a better job with this. Their sandwiches are only 5.99, and this place? It was 13 dollars. The pork was dry, the bun was hard, the Cole slaw was tasteless.
Maybe I&#39;ll give this place another chance... maybe not."

I noticed in in open table so I thought I would make a reservation and check out their lunch menu. 

I arrived and was seated right away. I was there as they were open so there were only a few people seated. I went ahead and order a 312 beer--I was shocked at he price! $8! They do have a large selection of beer. I would recommend taking your time with the drink list. 

I ordered the chicken caesar wrap for lunch. The menu listed a lime Caesar dressing and I thought that would be a nice twist. The wrap was ok but pretty dry. I think I will order something else if I return for lunch or dinner. My husband ordered a burger and that looked pretty good. 

Our server was just ok. He was very sarcastic in the beginning...not the best way to greet his table. He brought the food and drinks but I did notice all the servers standing around near our table. Maybe it&#39;s a different atmosphere on a busy night.

I made a reso on Opentable and requested outside.  Often times, the restaurant doesn&#39;t get that or is unable to accomodate but they actually greeted me and said &#39;did you still want to sit outside?&#39;  Why yes, yes, I would!  It was a beautiful day out.  We went outside, which was about a third full at 11:45 and asked to be in the shade (sun was also out), which they did.  The exterior is brick with multiple TVs.  TVs outside!  I was impressed.  The service was good most of the time and our server was actually very friendly but there was a period of time that she disappeared for about 15 minutes and I needed a drink refill.  Other than that, very good.  FYI, they do not have their awesome bloody mary on Mondays  (this was Memorial Day) but apparently it&#39;s the same as the awesome one just without the skewer.  Since I enjoy bloodies for the drink and not the skewer, I&#39;m totally okay with this.  The bloody was pretty good; not the best but not watered down either.

They have a really good beer list and my friend always gets some raspberry cider that she says is amazing and hard to find.  They have an okay wine by the glass menu as well.  Decent pricing.  As far as the food, this is where I was really impressed.  I&#39;m a city girl and it&#39;s hard to find what I have come to expect in the city in the burbs.  I want to pay for quality, not quantity.  Given that portions in the burbs tend to be much larger that what I&#39;m used to, we decided to split two items for lunch between three of us and it was the perfect amount.  The duck confit nachos were awesome.  The duck itself was very tender and it came with a good amount of other fun things like onion, tomato and jalepenos.  I could have used a bit more of the other stuff but it was still a decent amount.  The jack cheese sauce was tasty and the white bean was an interesting pairing.  I wasn&#39;t sure I would like it but it went very nicely.  The wonton chips are perfect because they are light and not greasy and hold up well to the duck and cheese.  They were perfectly crispy.  The only suggestion I would make is to perhaps shred the duck instead since the chunks I had were hard to eat on the nachos themselves.  We also had the filet sliders.  These were outstanding.  They were good size for a slider.  When we ordered them she asked how we wanted them prepared (medium rare, of course) so I knew they would be real filet and this made me happy.  They were and the filet was perfectly done and I mean tender.  You didn&#39;t need to knife and fork these; you could eat them just like a slider.  I could have perhaps used some more of the horseradish and onions but overall, very well executed.  The fries that come with were solid too.  I will definitely come back to try more."

They have an awesome beer menu with rotating options. I haven&#39;t had much food, just a few appetizers, which I loved.

They keep the sound on so you always know what&#39;s going on and then during commercials and intermissions, they play YouTube videos! It&#39;s a great place to hang out for a couple drinks. That being said though, it&#39;s pretty expensive. They never have any drink specials and the lowest cost I&#39;ve seen is $5 for a Miller Lite. Then there&#39;s the food... I&#39;ve tried a few different items and my husband and I just decided if we plan to go back for a game or something, we&#39;ll just eat before we go. I&#39;m not saying their food is awful, it&#39;s just not as good as other restaurants that offer the same types of food. The truffle Mac n cheese is literally a joke. Very bland tasting and the mix ins are hard to find. The mushroom flat bread was decent, but the amount of arugula thrown on top was just ridiculous. My favorite part on the flatbread was the caramelized onions which were very well hidden. My husband got the pulled pork and I had a bite. He said he thought it was alright, but we agreed there are many other places that make a much better pulled pork for the same price, if not cheaper. I guess I could just say that Old Town Pour House was disappointing on the food and specials front. The environment is really the only thing to go there for in my eyes. If they could just kick up the rest a notch, they would easily be beyond 5 stars."

From a few months ago:
I am gluten free and had the gluten free tacos and sure enough shortly afterwards I got sick!  That was very unpleasant and the worst part was the tacos just tasted okay.

Service speaks for itself: they&#39;re going to get you the beer you want A.S.A.P.

I admittedly have lost step on beer culture, as I am not up to date on the most current releases.  However, this location had new releases and old standards alike from both the &#34;craft&#34; beer culture as well as the standards we all know and love.

I suggest bringing a friend, watching your Blackhawks, and cheering with your fellow fans for an overwhelmingly worthwhile experience.

See, there is nothing old in Oak Brook.  Nothing.  Nothing at all.  Unless you consider a black Benz from 2009 old.  You may spot one of those in OB.

This place though, I like...a lot!  It&#39;s in the mall so if dining in a giant mall ain&#39;t your thing you won&#39;t like the vibe here.  I&#39;m pretty sure my mom delivered me in a mall so this place works for me.

You&#39;ll find lots of young OB moms with the friends here, lots of peeps that work in the area and a few families but I wouldn&#39;t say this place is great for kids.

Huge ass menu and even more beer selections.  IDK how they did it but their lobster roll is very, very good.  You can graze here or be a fattie.  I enjoy their duck nachos and filet mignon sliders.  My husband likes their fish tacos.  Comfort food?  Yep!  The braised short ribs with a homemade tomato confit are awesome and the meatloaf got rave reviews from another diner.

If you have jumped on the trendy beer bandwagon, you&#39;ll like it here.

The food was decent.  We started with the buffalo wings.  They were more spicy than most, so I was definitely pleased here.  I also ordered a chili, and wasn&#39;t thrilled.  It was made with smoked brisket.  All I could taste was the smoke and burnt ends of the meat.  Not the best chili I&#39;ve ever had to say the least.  My husband got the meatloaf.  He thought it was just ok on the flavor spectrum.  The gravy on the meatloaf was pretty good, however.

The service was horrible.  The place was far from packed because we came early.  The guy that took our order never looked at us.  He stared somewhere off in the distance the whole time.  We had to ask for water 3 times, and when he did bring it, he only brought one glass.  I figure he probably wasn&#39;t sure there were 2 people at the table because he never looked at us.  Also, I specifically asked for my bowl of chili to come out with my husband&#39;s meatloaf because the chili was my dinner.  They brought it out with the wings.  I asked guy to keep it warm and bring it back with my husband&#39;s meatloaf, and he seemed irritated.  Sorry to upset the balance man, but it&#39;s not really a big deal.

Would only come back for the beer."

While OTPH&#39;s service isn&#39;t exactly bad, it isn&#39;t good. Back up to December when the restaurant had a holiday freebee promotion. Our waiter had 6 of us open envelopes he gave us to see what we won for free at our next visit. I won an appetizer. Mind you, there was no expiration date and nothing specifically stating how long the offer was good. In mid-June, my mom and I dined outdoors at OTPH, telling our waitress we had a coupon. Not a word regarding an expiration or she wasn&#39;t aware of a coupon. Nada. We ordered the $13.00 smoked wings app along with two burgers, 1 non-alcoholic drink and bread pudding. Come time for the bill, our waitress returns in a snap to inform us that she&#39;s charged us for the wings as she was supposed to open the envelope and the promotion ended in February. Not to get in an argument over chicken wings or 13 bucks, I reiterated precisely what the 6 of us were told in December, and that I didn&#39;t see anything written on the envelope, or I would have read what it said. Our waitress, Diana, tells us again, that I&#39;m wrong, and that the promotion is over and we weren&#39;t to open the envelope - she was. On a $53.34 bill, we gave her $9.66 for a $63.00 total. I know we can do a lot better for lunch elsewhere, especially around Oak Brook Mall and for outdoor seating as well. All this establishment needed to do was to either catch the mistake BEFORE we ordered the app, or give us the app for free, just as the coupon card stated. So, for $13.00, OTPH lost at least these 2 customers and the 5 friends I dined with here in Dec."

It would be nice to have servers remind tables that it&#39;s not $12 as it was easily over looked at the bottom of the menu.

I came here with my daughter for the mac n cheese competition.  
Here is how I rate the 4 competitors:

WINNER - Quack &#34;n&#34; cheese from Seasons 52 - I read this going in and thought...really, duck confit?  BUT yes, it was amazing.  The Korean glaze worked well with the cheese and duck, a touch of spice would have been nice though.  this one actually won the whole competition.  

#2 - Pumpkin Gouda from Redstone - so good, fantastic taste and texture.  

#3 - Truffled Mac from Reel Club - whatever crumbs where on here complimented the mac n cheese so well.  The taste of truffle is always good, but now it&#39;s getting kind of old news ...

#4 - Baked truffle from the Pour House - bland beyond belief - just because you add a sliver of black truffle on it doesn&#39;t make it any better.  one sliver can&#39;t really add the woodiness taste to everything.

Is it so bad that on their facebook page I posted that I was happy that the quack n cheese won and that I voted for them?  They deleted my comment for some reason...??  Service was great except I ordered a soup that I never received.  My daughter enjoyed her plain American mac and cheese.

Best part is that instead of the same ol&#39; crayons they give wikki stix out for the kids.  These are awesome and kept my daughter entertained, so thanks for that.

I love the place itself all the way around. Great drink selection, a variety of beers, the food is good, it is a great place to start out your night or go catch a game since they have TVs all over.
I mostly always sit at the bar, I have not had a bad experience there. The bartenders are always attentive and take care of everyone fairly quickly, even when it is super crazy. It can get very busy on the weekends or a night that a major sports event is on so get there early to get a seat at the bar or make a reservation. The crowd is always fun and their little seating area outside with the fireplace is pretty nifty. I have ordered a few of their appetizers and salads and I have liked everything I have tried. I was there this Thursday and the guys seated next to me ordered the pork chop and OMG did it look absolutely delicious!! They were both raving about how great it was. It made my little salad look pitiful, lol.  I will be ordering the pork chop and bringing my appetite next time that I am there."

Also when the server refused to serve my table I went to the bar and asked for a pino noir. I watched the bartender pour me two glasses of A to Z ... She then charges me $36 for two glasses of wine. I was in my server uniform so I don&#39;t understand why she thought she should up sell me. I clearly know the business and I didn&#39;t appreciate her not giving me the house. If the house is A to Z then there&#39;s a problem with the menu and having decent price points. I highly doubt that is the case. Be careful when ordering here... This is not the first time this has happened.

It&#39;s been a mix of customer entertainment and dinner with colleagues,

Last night we ended up sitting in a booth by the entrance and the waitress havppened to be our bartender from the evening before.  She actually remembered what I was drinking. That is excellent service!

The brisket sandwich is also very nice.  The cheese sauce along with the BBQ side is well worth the price!"

Unfortunately, our second visit has officially become our final visit. On a positive note, the hostess was very friendly, as was our server (I believe his name is Andy). He timed our courses well and didn&#39;t pressure us to fly through our meal given how busy they were with the Cubs and Blackhawks games on TV. Quite honestly, the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 was because of our server. 

When we were waiting for our table, my husband and I went up to the bar for drinks. We waited for a solid 5-10 minutes without being noticed by the bartenders...there were 4 or 5 of them and they weren&#39;t particularly busy at that point; they seemed more concerned with talking to each other and chatting-up the men sitting at the bar. 

When we were seated, the food was a disappointment. The cheese curds were great, but the fish tacos were bland and overpriced. The Kobe beef burger was just sad...I ordered it medium, and it came out completely overcooked. To overcook Kobe beef like that is to ruin the integrity of the food, and I couldn&#39;t believe we had to pay $18 for that (and some fries &#34;fresh&#34; out of a frozen bag). 

While the ambiance and beer selection were the motivators to return for a second chance, there are dozens of other restaurants in Chicagoland that offer craft beer and food with flavor and integrity. We will not be returning to Pour House."

The buffalo shrimp, pretzel bites with IPA dipping cheese and sweet potato crème brûlée were to die for. I highly recommend the sweet potato crème brûlée for fall weather dessert.

We went last night on a quiet night in oakbrook and sat at a great booth, but the service and food were not great, hence the 1 star. My husband ordered the duck Reuben, which he said was good, but not a ton of meat, and I got the truffle chicken sandwich- so gross. Dark meat, weird after taste, and dry! Stacked high on a Hawaiian bun (which was good), but 1 bite, and all the fries later- the waiter asked me if I wanted my once bitten sandwich packed up (no...), and I declined bc it was not good, he didn&#39;t ask how we liked our food once- and I am not one of those people who goes out to complain. So we paid $13 for fries and a side of 1 bite of pretty gross chicken salad sandwich. 

Place was sort of busy, so I can see the lack of attention w/service, but $45 bucks before tip for 2 $8 beers (healthy pours- but one special of the yum yum that they advertised as a seasonal- was out), and 2 pretty gross sandwiches on the tiniest plates was a rip off.

The largest in the Midwest... or so their telephone on-hold recording claims.
I&#39;d believe it.
And boy will you pay for it.

Buffalo Shrimp. 
Just get like 3 orders of those. Done and done.
(and then hope someone else picks up the tab because it&#39;s like $15 for 5 shrimp)
(but I gotta say, TOTALLY worth the splurge)
Trust me. I know my skrimps from Buffalo.

The Chef here. He knows what he&#39;s doing.
I can&#39;t wait to come back. 
I&#39;ve got my eyes on you, Lobster Roll. 

The only neg I can grasp at is that you pay about $2 more per beer than you&#39;d be paying for that same exact beer at just about any other bar in the tri-county area. It seems especially high for a place that specializes in craft beer, but they do have the best draft selection I&#39;ve seen, so I&#39;m sure keeping all those kegs stocked costs a pretty penny... not to mention that they&#39;re actually located (sort of) within Neiman Marcu$ at Oakbrook Mall, and I&#39;m positive their rent tab is astronomical.  

If the higher price point beer offends you, you can of course go to any number of other Chicagoland businesses who cater to brew-minded folk, but if you&#39;re already at Oakbrook Mall and need a good beer, Old Town Pour House is a REALLY nice option to have and I, for one, have to say that having OTPH here makes going to the mall a little less stressful knowing you can kick back with a high-quality cold one, and a lot more appetizing knowing I can hoard a plate of buffalo shrimp here.

Parking can be a pain in the ass if you don&#39;t know the parking trick (which I&#39;m not openly sharing because I still want to be able to do the trick the next time I come here and want to park), but you can also valet for something like $4, which is probably worth it to avoid the headache. 

I came in during a weird off-peak hour (2pm on Tuesday) where the whole place was basically empty and still got the same great service and atmosphere that you&#39;d expect to find during peak restaurant/money-making hours. I think that says a lot about the quality of the staff with how well they uphold standards of service throughout a long day with many ups and downs in seating and turning tables.

Had I done a full meal here with a beer I could have easily ran a tab of $50 just for myself,  so that&#39;s something to know going in. Don&#39;t expect pubs-style pricing or eats, think gastropub and know that while your wallet may be lighter upon leaving, your stomach will certainly be full of happy and hoppy vibes."

After enjoying a picturesque Fall day with my momma pursuing the shops, we stopped in for a late lunch. Large TVs line the wall of the bar above the mile long row of beers on tap. This is a great bar for watching a game while sipping on a more unusual beer. Add the fried pickle chips to that and your heart will be content.  
  
Our entrees were not the highlight of our experience. My moms fish tacos were a messy, unable to be picked up as the single corn tortilla was soggy. My chopped salad was satisfactory, needed a little something more.

What waiter would ever say that in this business? Not mention this place is a gold mine for folks networking after work. Bad customer service my friends. You need to train your staff better.

As the night went on and the tabs went up, they decided to hold my other co-workers coat hostage because another person at her table didn&#39;t pay his $20 bill. How is that her fault? And how can you legally hold a coat for ransom?!?!

Our waitress was Elizabet and she was fine at first, but as soon as we mentioned we were just drinking and not eating, it was like a switch went off. Instead of cramming a bunch of people into the booth side of the table, we asked if we could get 1 extra stool. She made a big production about it and went over to the host stand, which we were right next to, and started talking about our table. She did finally bring another stool over but said nothing when dropping it off. The place was full, but there were a few empty tables and it&#39;s a bar, not everyone eats, so I don&#39;t know why she was so bothered by us. 2 friends joined the party after we had ordered a round of drinks and when Elizabet finally came back, she only asked 1 of the newcomers if they wanted a drink. My other friend couldn&#39;t even order anything before she was gone again. A few of us wanted another round of drinks but she did not come back for over 20 minutes. When she finally did come back, 1 person asked for their tab. Instead, she brought over the entire bill for everyone thus effectively ending our night.

Beer bar restaurants often underwhelm me because beer food fare--meat, bread, fried stuff--doesn&#39;t interest me. I&#39;m at these places to be supportive of my boyfriend&#39;s preferences, which means I order the veggie burger that is rarely anything to write home about.  

Old Town Pour House, however, has a gem of a veggie burger! It may even be the *best* veggie burger I&#39;ve ever had (top honor previously went to the quinoa and black bean burger at Nashville&#39;s Burger Up). The burger is made with a savory mix of garbanzo beans, black beans, and red quinoa and covered in a lovely crushed tortilla crust. It reminded me of falafel, only in beautifully-presented colorful patty form. I wish I had taken a picture, but I&#39;m sure I will when I return to Pour House in the near future. 

My PSA for vegetarians aside, here are some other comments: 
-My beer nerd boyfriend was pleasantly surprised that the encyclopedia of beers in the menu were all available on tap. Even I took advantage of the beer menu and ordered a 6 oz. of Finch&#39;s delicious Secret Stache stout.
- The appetizer of pretzel bites was comprised of little balls of dough very similar in size to Dunkin Donuts Munchkins. I found them to be a delicious way to enjoy pretzels yet also limit portions before the meal.
-There are three desserts on the menu, and my party ordered and enjoyed them all: baked cookie dough, bread pudding with rum raisin ice cream, and peanut butter chocolate pie. All very rich and indulgent! 
-Very friendly service that was just attentive enough. We went on a slow Sunday during lunch time though, so I can&#39;t comment on how it is during peak hours."

They have to have at least 30 micro brews on tap. I would call it upscale pub food. I had the pourhouse burger my daughter had the pork chop. Huge portions and tasted great. The staff was friendly and my glass was never empty. Situated in a shopping center among other upscale eateries such as Maggiano&#39;s and the Cheesecake Factory.

We asked to move our tables together and they said it was restaurant policy for that not to happen, and we were not allowed to sit in seperate tables so we basically got moved to another table in the cold. When we moved, writhing 15-20 minutes, a group of guys were seated in our old seats with the tables together. Could not believe they allowed this and asked for an explanation when we were told that they asked for sitting like that, when we asked for a manager, no one ever came. I could not believe how I was treated and was definitely not happy."

It&#39;s right in the oakbrook mall so perfect place to fuel up before or after some intense shopping. They have outside seating with tv and fireplace as well. Staff are always friendly as helpful on beer choices.
I&#39;m not a big beer drinker but I love their cider. I like the cherry one but just tried the pumpkin flavored for fall and I definitely approve. They have a million selections- banana bread beer! 
We love the chili and corn bisque (with real corn) to start. It&#39;s a must! I&#39;ve tried the beet salad and it&#39;s really good, dressing is perfect. Always try their specials- today we had BBQ quesadilla and it was good- it came with a BBQ dipping sauce which was too much BBQ if you ask me but still yummy. This portion was huge- enough for three people. 
Come here to watch games, they have upscale bar food and large beer selection!"

Haven&#39;t really found anything that&#39;s too fond. Burgers are rally sub standard. Calamari was hard and didn&#39;t taste fresh. Small food selection in general.As pretty much any restaurant in the mall parking might be a pain u less you want to resort to valet. This place is not five stars because it doesn&#39;t offer beer specials or happy hour. Service is too laissez faire nothing that compares to places around. Water refills took quite long, greeting a table too a while as well as getting our drinks and checks. Nice place to try craft beers and hang around the fireplace and catch a game but nothing more to this place. Crowd and music are decent 30/40 crowd type the times I been there it seemed."

The pretzel bites were served warm and bite sized.  Not a fan of the Gouda cheese sauce they were served with, but just a personal preference.  My smoked brisket was tender and flavorful.  My dining partners could not say that about their filet mignon smalls, which is their fancy name for sliders.  I am told they were too chewy and not cooked properly.  Dessert menu is limited, there were 2 choices offered to us.  The one selected was something like a butterscotch bread pudding, my dining partners ate some of it.

Ambiance:  it has a warm feel to it.  Large bar area with TVs, dining area, a separate room for a small, about 14, party.  There is an outdoor dining patio with a fireplace.  Very welcoming, but remember that is in a parking lot next to delivery area and garbage receptacles.  I would think the fumes from the deliveries would spoil ones appetite during the afternoon, but be more enjoyable in the evening.  There were at least 2 deliveries during the time we were eating lunch, we ate indoors.

I would visit again."

Nice beer selection. Friends loved the fish tacos but my brisket was very fatty-so much that I sent it back and while they replaced it with a salad at my request, it made me hesitant to agree to return when planning another dinner out with DH. I do recommend the friend pickle and it was my favorite part of the meal! I can say that we will give this place another try as the ambiance and sticks are well done.

Located in the mall, I can see this becoming a quick stop after shopping and especially during the summer months!
We tried a variety of items that included the pretzel bites which were so good, the cheese curds which I think may have been the best I&#39;ve had! Both the curds and bites came with dipping sauces which I didn&#39;t think much of, but that was ok because both were good on they&#39;re own. The buffalo shrimp were great and the filet sliders just so-so. 
Did I mention they have beer, beer and beer?!! For someone who loves craft beer you have to come. If your a newbie to the world of craft beers, they offer beer flights. I&#39;ve never seen so many beers on tap! They have cider and wine, and cocktails too.
A good spot after shopping to relax and enjoy."

The other two times we had a conflict and well, couldn&#39;t seem to make a reservation for that date/time either for some reason and I&#39;m not sure what they had going on at the place on those particular times.  I&#39;m glad we made a reservation just because of the area, and lots of offices in the area, etc.  I didn&#39;t notice a wait on a Thursday after work but reservations are just good to have no matter what so yes, you can make a reservation on their website.

So I guess they have a big beer selection here...I&#39;d say so, just because it takes up most of the menu, the food section is much smaller.  It was a big loud as the blackhawks playoff game was on.  They have a nice patio in front too.

This place is a bit on the pricey side, I want to say it cost about $16 for a flight of cider beer, $8 for a glass.  I had both.  I had filet mignon sliders for my dinner that came with a side of fries...good, but more on the appetizer side.  There were many things on the menu I&#39;d still like to return and try - both beer AND food so yes, I want to come back here."

I came on a Friday night with my main squeeze around 10pm and the place was pretty packed but there was no wait, which was good.  I had a glass of wine (weird, I know since this place has many beers, but I was craving a glass of wine), and the cheese curds.  I really enjoy trying cheese curds at different places.  These cheese curds were perfectly fried and not too greasy.  I didn&#39;t have any other of the food since I had dinner earlier in the night, but my boyfriend&#39;s burger looked good and large."

I rarely drink beer and went out with my daughter, her girlfriend, and her mother. A sort of Mother/Daughter night out! Company was great but food and atmosphere were below par.

I ordered the lobster roll, which at $18.95 should have been decent. There was less than 2 oz of any fish and question if it was really lobster? The roll was too buttered.  The side of fries were over salted and cold. Ordinarily I would have complained but it was noisy, busy, and I was with other people so I let it slide. My friend&#39;s mom ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which was not much more than 3 ounces, was also cold and cold fries.

After all, I am the one who booked this reservation on Open Table, which is a necessity to get a table on a Friday night at 7pm., ANYWHERE in Oakbrook center Mall!  BTW, most tables are bar height. I am 5 feet tall so I literally had to climb onto the stool/chair! So short people, beware!

If you love beer, are under the age of 40, then you might a like this place, which is a step up from a local college bar. Plus, you better have a Champagne wallet because this is not an economical place to eat/drink.
But, hey this is the western burbs of Chicago and it is a price to pay.
Even Valet parking is $4, which is ridiculous since there is no place to park because of ALL the restaurants: Perry&#39;s Steakhouse, Wildfire, Maggianos, Mon Ami Gabi, Cheesecake Factory, and now Old a Town Pour House.

The only way to enjoy this place would be to meet a friend for a beer and sit at the bar. The beer selection is pages long, too!

On a positive note, our waitress was very efficient and brought us extra water and allowed us to sit and chat and not clear off the whole table to get us to leave! We left her a 30% tip!"

Old Town Pour House has beer. *Cheer!*
They have at least 80 different kinds of beer. *Cheers louder*
And they&#39;re all on tap, making it easy to have short pours, sample different brews and my favorite, the beer flights. *Cheers, whistles, standing ovation*
*has to shout over cheering* there&#39;s wine and a fully stocked liquor wall for those that don&#39;t want to drink beer. 

Now that I have your attention...there&#39;s more.
There&#39;s an nice menu of eats too. Danielle S tried this wonderful-looking bacon and caramelized onion burger. *Intrigued*
And there&#39;s other good stuff. For example, the Grilled Cheese *Cheer!*
There&#39;s Pork Belly in it *Cheers louder*
And a sunny side up egg *Incredulous Cheering*
And it&#39;s served with a side of the creamiest/flavorful tomato bisque for dipping. 
It was pure heaven. *Cheers, whistles, standing ovation*

Service is great. Knowledgeable about brews. Glad to see they have a short list of seasonal brews too. That&#39;s how I got to try 4 Elf by Dark Horse and the Christmas Ale by Great Lakes. 

If you have to catch a game, there are many Flat Screens for your viewing pleasure, but no worries non-sports people, it&#39;s not intrusive. Great space. I&#39;ll be visiting again soon."

Came here for an late Brucs- my friends and I wanted to get some burgers and we all like going to this bar downtown so we figured we would give it a try. Maybe two other people in the whole place and it took forever to be served. I will say our group was a bit difficult ordering and changing up the menu so I totally get the kitchen time being longer but our waiter was inattentive and never checked on us or our drinks. My burger was severely overcooked to the point it was actually charred and tasted like charcoal. I didn&#39;t want to make a scene in front of my friends so I just ate the fries and picked away at the small part of my burger that was salvageable.

First off, this is located in the Oak Brook mall (across the parking lot from the Cheesecake Factory). Parking isn&#39;t fun, but you&#39;ll have that.

When I first walked in and saw all of the beers on tap, I thought I died and went to heaven. there are 84 (YES) beers on tap. Nothing is bottled. They are from local breweries from around the country. There is literally something for everyone. If you don&#39;t like beer, there is a nice wine selection as well as liquors. You can try any beer you want, or create your own flight. They have suggested flights in their menu as well. I ended up trying the Tangerine Wheat (almost like a Blue Moon with orange...only more orange tasting). It was very good!

They have a nice food selection with a variety of treats. Aimee M. ordered the pork belly grilled cheese and said it was very good. I ordered the Angus Burger with blue cheese and caramelized onions and bacon. Holy cow...it was amazing. Good food paired with good beer!

Our waiter was very helpful (in his words they are all beer geeks there, so ask any questions you have!). Everyone was friendly and the service was quick. The atmosphere is nice as well - dimly lit with a large bar, plenty of other seating, and TV&#39;s scattered. It&#39;s like an upscale sports bar.

I can&#39;t wait to come back and make more of a dent in those 84 drafts!"

Always wanted to try this place and was able to stop for a drink after having my birthday dinner at Wildfire next door. My husband ordered a craft draft and I asked what red wine they had. The bartender told me Cabernet or Pinot Noir. I chose pinot noir. He then asked bottle or on tap. Weird to have wine from tap so I said bottle. It was A to Z pinot noir. We finished that drink and got our bill. It was $21. MY GLASS OF WINE WAS $15! You would think that could have been mentioned. I will not be returning."

I was skeptical that they could pull off the same upscale, sports bar vibe in a location that is basically in a mall in the burbs.  Part of what I like about the Old Town location is the constant activity, the whir of people coming in and out and the windows that open out to the street.

So how did this newest sibling fare during my recent visit?  Pretty good.  And given I work right across the street and am always looking for somewhere to meet up with friends in the area, the Pour House will certainly go on my list as a choice for both lunch and dinner.

The interior, while smaller than it&#39;s sibling, is contemporary with copper topped tables.  There is a large patio out front complete with a couple of fireplaces that will certainly see it&#39;s share of business during the warmer months although I&#39;m hoping there will be a ton of greenery to block that you are basically looking out at a filled parking lot.

We were warmly greeted and shown to our table.  They have a ton of beer (about 80 different types) but also a great selection of whiskey so my whiskey lovin&#39; friend was very happy.  The other nice thing is that it looks like the menu is the same as the one at the other location so my chopped salad was just the way I remembered it and my friends brisket sandwich was also to his liking.  They also have the pork chop that I&#39;ve had at the other location so that will be mine to eat at a future visit!

People watching on this night was limited as there were only a few other tables that had people at them, but given it had only been open a week, I am sure that is going to change.

The only down side?  If you are going to open a restaurant about beer . . .then the servers need to understand the differences in the beers.  My friend is maniacal when it comes to beers so he will ask questions just to see if the server, bartender or sometimes even the manager know their stuff.  In this case- the server got a failing grade, but a quick trip up to the bar restored his faith in the place as the bartender was on his game.

Speaking of games- you can be sure to catch your favorite one here as there are plenty of TV&#39;s for you to watch without a bad seat in the house.

And know before you go- that unless you want to add exercise to your evening&#39;s activities you should probably use the $4 valet out front.  Sure- it&#39;s in a mall with tons of parking- but because this sits on the east side of the mall with many other restaurants and limited parking- parking is very hard to find.

Dinner with drinks ran about $80.  

Always nice to see a familiar &#34;city face&#34; find it&#39;s way out to the burbs.  Just makes the burbs a little more interesting.  Check it out!"

They hand you a menu that I mistakenly took for a food menu. Turns out, there are 6 pages of beer, 4 pages of wine, 1 page of whiskey and only 2 pages of food. Plus, there&#39;s a seasonal beer menu, as well. Feels like home. I love that you can try pre-made beer flights or MAKE YOUR OWN BEER FLIGHT!! The servers and bartenders know their way around a keg and speak beer. So far, so good on their recommendations. 

My companion says they have a shockingly good whiskey collection; something foreign to me, so I&#39;d take his word for it. He happens to be a bartender, as well. Oh, there&#39;s also a &#34;DJ.&#34;  Or a dude with a MacBook playing music. Either way, not disappointed!!

5-star rating if it weren&#39;t for just one thing... It&#39;s located under Neiman Marcus next to 4 Lettuce Entertain You restaurants and another brand new joint. Translation: no parking.

Old Town Pour House now has a location in Oak Brook Mall.  My city friends were raving about how much they loved Pour House so when we had the chance we quickly took advantage of their 90+ taps and American menu. 

We had a reservation, but arrived 30 minutes early and we were seated in minutes.  They do not have a lot of room at the long bar for you to stand and wait so I was glad that we didn&#39;t have to wait long.  The atmosphere is very LOUD.  It was difficult for my boyfriend and I to talk to each other with how loud the music is playing in the place.  It grew frustrating as the night went on because it&#39;s hard to have a date without conversation.

They had an incredible beer menu, but our waiter clearly had not been educated on the menu.  We asked the question, &#34;What specials do you have?&#34;  We were met with a blank stare until he started reading off of the specials menu we hadn&#39;t noticed on the table.  We asked, &#34;What pairs well with the brisket or pulled pork?&#34;  Blank stares.  We knew that the place was newer so we decided to just make our own beer decisions since we were causing our server distress.

Their food menu takes what you know about American food and turns it upside down.  We ordered the fried pickles, bbq pulled pork, and the brisket.  The pickles were sliced too thick and breaded too heavily for my taste.  The batter had great flavor, but it was very difficult to eat the pickle slices because they were so large.  The BBQ pork had a smoky heat that filled your entire mouth with heat.  It was very flavorful, but the seasoning was more than I could handle.  My boyfriend had the brisket and we both agreed that it was very well prepared and the Hawaiian roll was a great choice for this sandwich.  We were both disappointed with the French fries.  There was nothing special about the fries at all.  They need an aoli or a fried egg on top to call themselves &#34;American with a twist.&#34;  

I&#39;m interested to see what becomes of this restaurant as it settles into it&#39;s new location.  The suburbs need more restaurants for beer and food pairings."

The filet sliders-dry, tiny and shriveled. Pork belly burger-sounds delish, right? Nope, the pork belly wasn&#39;t at all crisp so it tasted like a big pad of fat on the burger. Sigh. Pretzel bites-pass. The cheese served with it tastes like a big dunk of bland. I had some sort of beef sandwich last fall-also not impressed. Nothing tastes like anything. To be fair, my colleagues all love the fish tacos, so maybe those are good. So that&#39;s one meal from the menu that may be tolerable. Boo. The cocktail also leaves a lot to be desired.

This was my first time trying the rotary sushi experience, and it&#39;s AHHH-MAZING! 

My group and I had an absolute blast! Great experience, honestly. This would be a really fun date experience or for lunch or dinner or breakfast or family dining or anything! A great experience to show anyone! 

It&#39;s pretty affordable in my opinion because each plate is priced at different amounts, so you really get to try a large diversity of dishes while maintaining your budget! At all-you-can-eat sushi, it would be $20 per person, and my group and I paid less than that each when eating at rotary sushi! I felt just as full &amp; satisfied afterwards too! **There are desserts on the conveyor belt too, and they&#39;re delicious! I recommend the green tea cheesecake because that&#39;s something you can&#39;t get just anywhere!

The environment is very clean and unique. The table has a little drawer to keep menus in which I think is bomb because the menus are always in the way, and the little drawer is super cute!

The servers are EXCELLENT! They work so quickly and efficiently! I never had an unfilled glass of water, and the table was ALWAYS cleaned up of unnecessary lids or straw wrappers or any clutter. They were very conscious of when I needed anything! I pulled out the menu &amp; chose what I wanted (you have the option of ordering from the menu if you can&#39;t find what you want on the conveyor belt), and before I could motion a server over, she was already on her way! So aware! Love it! All of the servers were very KIND as well. Very amicable people.

Bathrooms are clean as well, and my grandpa always told me that you can tell how good a restaurant is by the cleanliness of their bathroom, so this place is the BEST by those standards! 

Such a great and fun experience! I had lots of fun, and I recommend everyone to try it! I would love to answer any questions about it if anyone is confused, lol!"

1. Great ambience, food comes to you! You can choose out of the menu or decide on the rotary sushi bar.

2. Plenty of options. Im asian and i dislike sushi with a passion... i only eat certain meals. Here they have tons of options including Binto Boxes and Ramen ^_^!!

3. I am a music lover and they typically play todays music. Which i am a fan of.

4. Great seating, plenty of room for over 4 people 6 people easy fit. 

5. It is nearby. I live in Warrenville and Naperville is very close. 

Customer service is decent, a little hard on the english but they keep close attention to your water level. They make sure to swing by to check up on you. Overall satisfaction 4/5 as well as the review im making.

My one dislike/concern inconsistent cooking/chef work. When i first went with my girlfriend we both got Binto Boxes with beef. It was phenomenal! Great taste, flavor, plenty of juicey goodness! This most recent visit that wasnt the case... Dry... not flavorful, very dull. So beware your food may not be consistent. My only flaw. Otherwise ramen is dead on each time. Same thing with the sushi! 

Good luck!"

We stopped here with our kids, and they LOVED the concept, so much so that we even got them to try stuff they wouldn&#39;t normally eat. So now we can convince them to go out for sushi which is great. They were also eying the desserts as they went by and we used that as incentive for them to eat well.
The maki rolls are pretty Americanized, but whatever, there is something for everyone. And if it&#39;s not on the conveyer belt, you can order it off the menu. The service was very attentive and friendly.

This is great for eating without waiting, and getting just as much as you want without over ordering. In the end the bill was very reasonable for what we all got.

I can&#39;t wait to come back here even though it&#39;s really far away from us, as we live in the city."

The inside of this place was so cute! There was a sushi train that was going around the whole restaurant and you were able to grab anything off the train or order off the menu. I was not feeling adventurous enough to grab anything off the train but I surely ordered off the menu. 
If it says &#34;spicy&#34; on the menu, it is actually spicy, don&#39;t take it lightly like I did! But even the spicy roll was amazing even though I don&#39;t like spicy food. 

The sushi was good and the desert was AMAZING, 
I would definitely come back and eat off the train next time."

The service was great. Our waiter was attentive and on top of clearing our plate toppers.

The only downfall was the sushi pizza. The photo provided in the menu was quite misleading and I did not have any mango on my Adventure pizza. Honestly, with the slice of cheese, tomato, and globs of mayo, it tasted more like a sushi burger.

Otherwise, the sushi was fresh and plentiful. Seaweed salad was great! I&#39;ll be back but will skip the sushi &#34;pizza&#34;."

.......yellow plate green plate empty plate sadface :(

I happened upon this restaurant during their soft opening several years back, and having returned on 02/13/16 I can say that things seem to have improved greatly.  Better variety of stuff, more diligent service, overall a more polished dining experience, really.

For those of yous unaware, this is the place with the sushi conveyor belt.  Yes, THAT one.  A refrigerated conveyor transports various sushi rolls--along with appetizers like edamame and spinach salad--around a track that snakes through the dining area twice.  If you find yourself fancying a particular roll, you simply open the plastic shutter nearest to you and grab the plated item off the belt.  Voilà.

Sushi+ uses a clever pricing system that can totally sneak up on you if you&#39;re not making a mental tally as you go (and I mean really, with moving sushi plates going on in front of you, who&#39;s got the time to be doing crap like adding numbers together?)  Most sushi items were 4 pieces/plate and were on either red, blue, or green plates.  Each plate color denotes a different price to pay.  White is the cheapest, with things like plain albacore sashimi ($1.50/plate), while purple was the most expensive ($6.50/plate) and had items like dragon roll maki and something called &#39;white devil&#39;, among other specialty handrolls (sidenote: why is it that whenever I hear/see &#39;white devil&#39;, I keep thinking of Ace Ventura When Nature Calls?)

The best plate I had was called &#39;Snow White&#39; and was shrimp tempura with crab, mayo, avocado and crunch topping.  The &#39;sunrise&#39;r&#39; was creamy white tuna wrapped in soy bean paper, and the &#39;volcano&#39; was spicy salmon maki topped with flaming hot cheetos.  That last one was pretty gimmicky, I gotta be honest.  Things like your basic California or Philadelphia rolls [cream cheese, cucumber, salmon] were on green plates, priced at $4.50ea.

What surprised me the most was Sushi+&#39;s selection of desserts.  They had a green tea cheesecake that was thoroughly underwhelming, but the real treats were the Crème brûlée and the coconut pudding that made a few passes in front of me before I said &#34;ahhh why the hell not?&#34; and snatched them off the conveyor.  The Crème brûlée was a smooth custard with a nice hard top, and although the coconut pudding was far closer to coconut Jell-O it was pleasantly refreshing nonetheless.

The dining area was impeccably clean.  As in, if I dropped a piece of sushi on the ground I&#39;d have no hygienic concerns about picking it up again within 5 seconds and eating it.  Staff maintained a pristine bar for patrons and the general look &amp; feel was just very tidy.  Servers were efficient in refilling my hot tea and in clearing away debris.

Bread = 4.5
Circuses = 5

The bill came to something like $50 and considering the borderline disgusting amount of food I ate, I&#39;d say the pricing scheme was fair.  If you keep a running track of plate colors, then your bill won&#39;t spiral out of control, because a hungry date like me can cause that to happen in a heartbeat.

I love Sushi+ and would highly recommend it for lovers of all things maki.  But heed this warning: when your stack of colored plates hits the ceiling, it&#39;s probably time to ask for the check."

First off, when I&#39;m hungry, I like to eat ASAP. Here, there is no ordering, just grabbing what you want! The plates are covered and the case is closed as it goes by, so as a bit of a germaphobe, this place keeps their food safe!

You get points just for checking in that you can redeem for things like a free blue plate for $30 for your check. I use it and I&#39;m almost to getting $30!

I love the concept of the rotary bar as you can choose multiple plates of smaller maki, sashimi, salads, etc.  You also can order off their very extensive menu.  I loved the chuka idako, which is a marinated baby octopus salad, the white devil, the sunrise roll and of course just the fresh sashimi of tuna, red snapper and yellowtail.  The service is quick and friendly.  On Tuesday, they have $3 specials like spicy tuna chips which were yummy or gyoza.  Their desserts are smaller more manageable portions and look good; although we have yet to try them.

And since those first two reviews, I have been to Sushi+ about 6 more times, with all them happening within the last two months.

So of course, why did I change my mind?

Well, the main reason I gave this place another chance was mainly because I was starving one day and I was craving sushi bad. And I knew that this was a place I could come to and get my food quickly, while also not looking like a weirdo if I was eating alone. So I gave this place another shot and I had a pretty good experience.

Before, when I wrote my past reviews, I was just a &#34;kid&#34; - granted I am kind of still a &#34;kid&#34; today, but I have a college degree and a real job/steady income so I can afford to spend a few extra dollars here and there now. Back then, I was just looking for the best bang for my buck, and that essentially meant eating at All You Can Eat sushi joints. However, what really convinced me that this place wasn&#39;t too expensive when compared to AYCE places was the Tako aka boiled octopus nigiri, which was only 2.50$ for two pieces - which I thought would have cost way more than that. 

For those of you who haven&#39;t been to a AYCE sushi place around here, like Sushi City or Sakura, they typically cost around 25$ for dinner after tax and tip. If I were to eat like that at Sushi plus, we&#39;d be looking at around 30-35$. So it&#39;s not too much more, and you get a bit more variety here. An example is the Ramen - which taste great and is around 10$. I also love the sushi sandwiches; the Tokyo Sandwich and the Rotary Sandwich. I dont know why but they both taste great. Another thing to note is, if you are a smaller person (I am over 6 feet tall and over 200lbs), eating here where you can pick in portions of 2 or 4 pieces, will be cheaper than eating at a AYCE place because you probably can&#39;t eat $25 worth of sushi anyway.

In addition, the conveyor belt style of sushi is also iconic and people love going there just for that. So a nice place to take your friends or date as well.

What bothers me is still the wasabi packets - fresh wasabi would really be a nice touch. That, as well as the cost, is keeping me at 4 stars. But still an improvement. Check it out if you like sushi or japanese food, they have more than just sushi!"

The next time was yesterday, my husband and I went because I wanted to see if he liked the place too.

Their customer service is top notch with the right amount of attentiveness. The ladies remember me and that always makes a customer feel welcomed. The gentleman are also wonderful. They know the food well and can describe the taste. That helps because I can be indecisive. 

My favorite dish here is the Hama Kama, Grilled Yellow Cheek. It&#39;s just so good with rice and soy sauce. Pair it with salad and it&#39;s perfect.  Another great is the Spider Roll. The combination of the crunchy soft shell crab with the avocado and other ingredients all come together really well.  Otherwise their bento boxes are also great. The portion is perfect."

I recently started ordering the tuna poke bowls (they have other types as well), and they are delicious! It comes with miso soup, which is always welcome. Very affordable and quick! 

The unfortunate part is that I just ate at Sushi Nakazawa and saw Jiro dreams of Sushi...so the sushi board style restaurant is going to be hard to come back to. :( but this still a great lunch option and is very reasonably priced."

Husband and I decided to try S+RSB on a whim after hearing a few things about it from friends. We went on a Sunday afternoon so it wasn&#39;t too crowded. We got a table right away and were greeted with hot towels and tea immediately. We picked a few items off the conveyor belt and munched away.

The taste was decent - not the best by any means but certainly not the worst. Everything was freshly prepared. The servers were always on time and swooping up any covers we took off the plates or any paper trash we made from used napkins, etc. They were the real stars of the show!

Prices were decent for what you get but there are better options out there if you&#39;re really a sushi fanatic like me. Great job to the staff though! You&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re being pampered :)"

The cousins and I decided to drop by here after a visit to Centennial Beach. Overall it&#39;s pretty good value, and once you get the hang of pulling out the sushi from the belt not spilling octopus salad all over yourself, it&#39;s actually kind of fun to boot.

I don&#39;t remember all of the dishes that I grabbed, so I&#39;ll note the ones I remember:

Egg sushi - the cheapest plate on the belt, this one was sweet and tasty.

Oyster shooters - okay, bear with me here. Three shot glasses of raw oyster served with over an ounce of different vinegars.

This. Was. Awesome.

I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re supposed to chew on the oyster. I don&#39;t care. It was delicious. Briny, vinegary, lively, worth the purple price.

Route 59 - Because every sushi restaurant needs to name a dish after the street they&#39;re located on, this mixture of crunchy, tuna (I think), cream cheese and something hot worked very nicely.

Adventure Pizza - My brother is insane, but this avocado-laden sushi pizza actually tastes good, especially the crispy rice on the bottom.

Some Sort of Soup - best miso soup, if that&#39;s what it was, I&#39;ve ever had. Deep, intense flavored broth with right-sized noodles.

Anything That Comes With That Special House Sauce, Especially Sushi - delicious. A thickly sweet teriyaki sauce with a hair of soy sauce in it, it&#39;s used to great effect on one particular dish on the belt.

The servers were very attentive and kept bringing fresh, cold green tea. If you&#39;re looking for fresh fish that never stops moving, Rotary is for you."

We dine hear about once a week, in fact, since we enjoy it so much.  A lot of choices and all are wonderful. Our favorites are the crab maki rolls, Godzilla rolls, and the Route 59 rolls. 

Polite, super attentive, staff in a modernly decorated, trendy, and clean restaurant makes this a great place to bring friends and family, or for a date night. We also like how the sushi is freshly made near the tables and then presented on a covered dish that is rotated on a belt that passes right by each table. You just lift the door at your table as you see a dish that appeals to you. A fun way to try new dishes too. It&#39;s easy to budget because each dish has a colored ring around the plate which tells you the price. At the end of your meal, the waiter tallies your plates and presents your bill. I wish all restaurants did it this way!

Besides the items on the conveyer belt, there are great choices that can be ordered on the menu too. We especially  enjoy their beef skewers, tokyo sandwich and mango rolls. You can tell that the owners and employees are proud of their restaurant and really want to make their diners happy. They greet you with a polite smile and are genuinely glad to see you.

One word of caution. This place might seem cheap since they advertise plates for $1.50, $2.50, etc. However, unless you really only want low-end items, the bill can add up real quick. I&#39;m not sure I saw any $1.50 plates."

I think the food is probably more like a 2 star deal, but I had so much fun staring at the rotary belt and reading all of the signs that it has to get the third star.  Seriously, sushi is such a beautiful food.  It&#39;s really fun to watch all of the little plates moving past.  Everything comes out immediately, so it would be a great place to go for lunch if the food were just a little bit better (or maybe 20% cheaper). Despite being unimpressed with the food, my husband and I had a ton of fun with this meal.

I don&#39;t know if this is a universal thing, but there are some sushi rolls that I have just come to think of as more Americanized (i.e. anything with cream cheese... but seriously they have a roll with cheetos on it) and if you stick to those exclusively, then I think you might actually be in good shape, but avoid the things that rely on the quality of the raw fish.  For example, I tried the red snapper sashimi, and definitely regretted it.  It was a little bit rubbery and mostly tasteless.  The thing that I thought was the worst was the spicy tuna roll - mushy and bland!

We didn&#39;t try anything on the menu that you actually have to order, so maybe that&#39;s better. I won&#39;t be back to try it.

Here&#39;s a tip - try to sit as close to the beginning of the belt as possible!  It goes clockwise from the perspective of the sushi makers."

We drove an hour each way to eat here and we ended up visiting twice. The first time was on black Friday when they happened to be having a 20% off your bill promotion. I had planned on visiting anyways so this was just a bonus! We arrived and they were packed with a line. They asked if we were okay waiting for a seat at the bar and I told them yes. I was chatting with the lady and I told her I was from Omaha and I was visiting my husband and had been looking forward to eating here for like 3 months. (My husband just completed Boot camp for the Navy Hooyah!) She was just amazed we would drive that far. We sat at a booth in the middle at the bar. The sushi was fresh and they kept it coming fast. The selection was good, and I also ordered some Inari and masago. The only roll I didn&#39;t enjoy was the spicy crab, but (funny enough) I&#39;m not a fan of fishy tasting things. The maguro was AMAZING and fresh. I&#39;m a fan of big eye tuna so I looked forward to it. 
We ate a lot (mostly my husband) and we tried many different things. I kept forgetting to take photos because I was just over the moon happy with my sushi. 
The bill came and the same lady I talked with told us they were giving us 25% off instead of 20% because we drove so far. Honestly I think it was because my husband was in uniform, but either way I was appreciative. She also helped me get one of their loyalty cards set up which is pretty cool. 
Well I loved it so much that on my last day there (the next day) we drove back again. The guy (who might be the owner/manager?) was surprised to see us. I told him we loved it so much I had to have it again.
My only complaint would be the lack of maguro slices until when I was leaving, but it&#39;s my own fault because I didn&#39;t feel like ordering it special. Didn&#39;t take any photos this time... too busy eating sushi. Both trips were like $40 bucks give or take. 
Prices compared to everywhere else I&#39;ve eaten are dirty cheap and usually when you&#39;re talking sushi that&#39;s not a good thing. It works here. I also found out they DO have sashimi (even though it&#39;s not on the menu). As I was leaving and so full I might have to be rolled out to the car I saw tuna sashimi on a purple plate ($6.50) If you eat sashimi you can appreciate how cheap that is. I know what I&#39;m getting next time.

Hopefully I&#39;ll be moving to Chicago soon and I can&#39;t wait to eat here probably far too often!"

Signs and descriptions of the items are large and clear.

I tried a few rolls and ordered tonkatsu ramen spicy with pork belly. The pork belly was grilled and flavorful. Ramen broth wasn&#39;t too spicy. Overall very delicious.

Came in about 7:30pm and no sushi going around the conveyor.  We we told since they weren&#39;t busy they will not put any out.

I noticed that the fish was all sliced too thin.  Even the scallops I ordered show a picture of 3 thick full size sea scallops when the arrived I saw what looked like one scallop sliced into 3rds to get three thin pieces.  It tasted great but I showed the photo on the menu to server/manager who told me &#34;do you know how much one scallops costs?

Rotary sushi is hard to come by in the Chicagoland area and my kids were jonesing. A trip to the Paramount Theater brought us to Aurora and Sushi + Rotary Sushi Bar kept us in town for dinner.

Nope, it&#39;s not the best sushi I have ever had - not by a long shot. BUT, it is good sushi served on an awesome rotary belt. Beat that, boring sushi restaurants! We got there early enough to get one of the coveted booths adjacent to the rotary and set our kids free. The food was good and the fun of rotary sushi just can&#39;t be beat. There is something about stacking up those colored plates that just makes dinner taste better.

The decor was sleek/modern and the service was excellent. There is also a lot of good Japanese food on the menu for non-sushi eaters and you can order sushi items a la carte as well. When life takes us to Aurora, we&#39;ll be back for sure."

I was estatic when I found out there is another conveyor sushi joint! We&#39;ve been to Sushi Station a bunch of times but the quality seemed to be getting worse and worse with each visit. Luckily, I had my car and was able to venture out to the burbs for a visit. 

The place is pretty schnazzy inside. Everything is brand new and clean. The restaraunt is pretty open and you are not squeezing around everyone.  They move around the seating I&#39;ve noticed on different visits. The nice thing is that they&#39;ve boths along the conveyors. So much easier when dining with groups.  

The service here is great!  I don&#39;t think I ever had to ask for a refill and my glass was magically always full. The waiters were very attentive that any trash, wrappers, lids or empty plates were taken away within seconds. In addition to being attentive, the waiters were very nice and happy you are there.  Been here over 3 different times and always had excellent service. I think the service here is better than some of the fancy sushi places I&#39;ve  been to in the past. 

Now lets talk about dem rolls!!!  The selection of rolls and nigri is pretty darn good.  You can grab off the conveyor or order from the menu.  FYI...They&#39;ve a sushi pizza that looks pretty cool. The sushi taste fresh and portioned appropriately.  They&#39;ve a bunch of speciaity rolls and constantly changing the menu up. In addition to sushi, they&#39;ve added ramne to their menu!

I came by myself with a Groupon for lunch. By the time I made it, it was late afternoon and the place was pretty empty. I was seated right away at a spot at the belt. I presented my Groupon to the friendly server, just to make sure that I was able to order anything that I wanted off the menu and that there weren&#39;t any stipulations. She said it was valid for anything off the belt and anything on the menu. Since I&#39;m the kind that has to scope out the menu prior to dining, I already had my heart set on the American Idol roll. I decided to only order one thing from the menu so the rest of the food could come off the belt. I waited and watched everything for about 15 minutes before grabbing just so I could see everything they had to offer. I was surprised there was still a nice variety on the belt even though there weren&#39;t a lot of people dining.

I first took the squid salad (green plate = $4.50) This was one of my favorite items that I ordered. Sometimes I feel like it&#39;s rice overload when devouring sushi, so I like to get a salad to feel better about myself. The flavors were great and the squid was strangely addicting. Next, my American Idol roll was placed in front of me from the kitchen. This was absolutely heavenly and really huge. Had I not had a minimum amount I needed to spend for the Groupon, I probably would have just ordered that particular roll and the salad. However, to get all of my money&#39;s worth - I also grabbed the Snow White Roll off the belt (red plate = $5.50) This one was pretty standard and not my favorite of all the kinds I&#39;ve tried, but that was just preference. I usually prefer the ones with a little bit more of a kick.

My server was really great about explaining how the whole &#39;conveyer belt&#39; thing works and she was even nice enough to box up my last roll since I couldn&#39;t finish it. 

I wish I would have brought some friends along to experience the coolness of this place with them, but that just means I&#39;ll have to make plans to come back here soon."

Service is fabulous and I can&#39;t fault them at all for that. My usual conveyor belt sushi spot is Sushi Station and so I can only draw a comparison between the two. Sushi + Rotary has less options overall, a few creative options but overall less inventive rolls and the prices are quite a bit higher. Alas, my heart still belongs to Sushi Station.

My buddy and I had:
Japanese green tea $2
Diet Pepsi $2
Beef skewers $3.50
Chicken skewers $3.50
1 Dragon Ballz Nigiri $5.50 - Little balls of rice topped with fish. Cool to get one time but overall more rice than a piece of nigiri should have along with it.
1 Veggie Sushi pizza - interesting concept, liked the crispy rice and it really was interesting having a rice pizza.
4 Yellow Plates $10
2 Blue Plates $7
2 Green Plates $9

$52.30 + tip, of course. Everything I had was decent but I wouldn&#39;t call it amazing. I had various rolls like crispy spicy tuna and a dream roll, as well as trying skewers but I thought the best thing of my night was the Veggie Sushi Pizza. 

I wouldn&#39;t shy away from eating here again if I had friends interested in but am going to stick to my usual conveyor belt sushi spot."

The sushi slowly tantalizes you as it rolls around the track. Plates are color coded so you know the price, and there&#39;s little description cards telling you the goodness inside. There&#39;s also an a la carte menu if waiting for something you like to roll by isn&#39;t your style.

It isn&#39;t a buffet, but why do you want to subject yourself to all that rice and stuffing yourself? With Sushi Rotary, you pick from a wide assortment of sushi on a conveyor belt that is filled with freshly made sushi. If there&#39;s something you don&#39;t see, you can order directly from the menu.

I&#39;ve gone here three times so far, and each time has been excellent. The seared scallop absolutely melted in my mouth. The same for the rainbow roll. I like that this place doesn&#39;t load up on the rice, but really lets the ingredients speak for themselves. The white devil roll was also a nice combination of spicy tuna, avocado, and crab though I&#39;m a bit disappointed that they&#39;re using imitation crab instead of soft shell crab.

I&#39;d come here strictly for the sushi. The bento boxes are ok, but I&#39;ve never been the biggest fan of these. If you&#39;re afraid of sushi, these are a consideration. On the other hand, the fish here is not fishy! Good sushi should not smell or taste fishy.

Decent sushi at a good price. Eating in is a lot of fun with the rotary bar. You just select the plate you&#39;re interested in from the conveyor belt and get charged based on the color. They also participate in Belly rewards and have great offers.

We came on a Friday night and waited about 15 minutes for the first available spot.  There are 2 seating options - straight across bar style or in a booth.  The decor is very futuristic looking and clean.

You can order off the menu or just start picking out sushi from the conveyor belt.  The sushi/food are on colored plates that represents different prices (white plate = $1.50, purple plate = $6.50, etc.).  There&#39;s a plate with the name and description preceding the actual dish so you know what you&#39;re picking up.  The options include maki rolls, nigiri, seaweed salad, edamame, mango pudding, etc.  

Here are some of the ones I tried:
Ocean 13 (4 pieces, lobster salad, avocado, crunch top with seared salmon and spicy mayo) - My favorite, has very good flavors.
Volcano (4 pieces) - Good, love the flaming Cheetos on top
Red Dragon (4 pieces) - There was some flavor I didn&#39;t like in this one and was glad I didn&#39;t have to eat the rest
Sake (2 pieces of salmon) - Disappointing.  Looked good and nice portion, but the actual fish didn&#39;t have much flavor
Seared scallop (2 pieces) - Meh
Mango Pudding - Or was it called mango jello?  Not bad.

I would definitely stick with the specialty rolls here.  They have a frequent custom program called &#34;Belly Rewards&#34; to gives you 5 points per visit.  You can use points to redeem a free plate of food or 100 points will get you a $25 gift card.  I saw a bowl of the rewards card by the front door.

Between the 2 of us, we spent about $50 on food and were stuffed.  That&#39;s comparable to what we would spend at an AYCE."

Also my iced green tea was tasteless I had no flavor at all.  The worst thing was the ramen.  Really???  The broth was bad it was a rotten pork smell.  I was horrible.  I almost spit it out.

You notice the really cool ambience right away (they had me at sushi on a conveyor belt)! We were seated immediately and they gave us warm, damp napkins to clean our hands. Prices range from $1.50-$6.50 per plate of sushi from the conveyor belt, you get around 4 pcs (there&#39;s also a choice of different desserts and salads). *Side bar: they had a spicy crab roll topped with flamin&#39; hots which creeped me out, haha! The Godzilla &amp; White Devil rolls were among my favorites. Also the seaweed salad w/cucumber was pretty tasty. We also ordered with our waiter a tempura mix with shrimp, sweet potato, mushroom and one unfamiliar (the batter was so light and fresh), sumo fried rice (had corn in it), and the hamachi jalapeño (be prepared for the jalapeños to have a serious kick- but spicy foods are my thing ). Prices from the regular menu are also very reasonable. To drink, we ordered green tea (hot) and a soft drink- the wait staff was very attentive with refilling our drinks that the drinks hardly reached empty the whole time.

Starring: Me, Andrés D, and conveyor belt sushi topped with Flaming Hot Cheetos. 

In the great words of Haru, The Great White Ninja (RIP Chris Farley): &#34;Holy Shinto!&#34; 

It may very well have been the best day of my life. I mean, it&#39;s easy to assume I&#39;m being facetious, what with with the combination of fish, dairy-product, and vending machine novelty snack all wrapped up in one roll, but I assure you, I&#39;m dead serious. That (f)ish was gooood. 

By far the best thing that we ordered was the Sushi Pizza, which you won&#39;t find on the conveyor belt, you have to order it from their menu and there&#39;s 3 different options. We went with the traditional and at only $5.50, it was phenom. 

The conveyor belt experience was what I was most looking forward to and it was a blast to begin with, but having my bestie, Andres D, there and racing with me to grab the plates we wanted was the most fun. It&#39;s a test in your reactive time for sure and you&#39;ve got to be on the ball and keep your eye on the prize. It felt like foodie Disney World... but more fun. And they basically play the soundtrack from the arcade version of Dance, Dance, Revolution... which is only one of my most favorite past times. 

I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the sushi here. A part of me was worried that the experience would be more about the novelty of the conveyor belt, and that for sure makes up a HUGE part of my excitement about our experience, but the quality of sushi, though not up there with Michelin-rated restos, was better than All-You-Can-Eat sushi place&#39;s sushi (and a much better deal here) and better than most standard Midwestern sushi locales. If you&#39;re a sushi snob, don&#39;t plan on being wowed with the fair, but expect an amazingly fun time with better than average sushi and some creative flair as well. 

As far as sushi I grabbed off the rotary, I was really impressed with my super white tuna nigiri. It was super fresh a majorly generous cut, and just melt in your mouth stellar. I don&#39;t often do nigiri when I go out for sushi, but for places I have tried, Rotary had the best super white tuna. The spicy scallop roll was also the best I&#39;d ever had of that sort. It had avocado in it but I could still taste the scallop and the spice was definitely in there, which was a nice change of pace because normally when I get that other places it&#39;s not spicy at all and I end up being disappointed, but not here. 

Our servers were on it. Andres and I must have gotten 40 refills on our hot green tea and they were always on hand to remove the plastic covers form our many rotary sushi pulls, that would&#39;ve otherwise really piled up. 

Andres and I normally do All-You-Can-Eat sushi places for lunch and the pricing usually runs around $16-$25 per person. Here, our bill was $35 TOTAL, for both of us, and we left stuffed. Like whoa. We wasted nothing and everything was fresh. We did arrive right at 11:40, only 10 minutes after they&#39;d opened, so I think we got the best selection possible based on our timing, but there was no point where your rotary options dwindled, though the plates and option did change in the hour or so that we were there, so if you see something you really need to have, grab it, but if you do happen to miss something you want, you can order it off the regular menu for yourself for the same price as it would have been, and it&#39;ll just take 5-8 minutes more. 

I literally just text Andres about going back this week. Our experience was a blast and everyone who worked here was eager, smiling, knowledgeable... I&#39;m so excited to have this new addition to the Aurora/Rt 59 strip... it&#39;s (and I might be crazy saying this) worth sitting in the god-awful and perpetual Rt 59 traffic/construction/mayhem for... but obviously if you have the option to take any way but Rt 59, do that, because that sh*t is insane."

Plus most of the items were made with imitation crab meat and catered to the American Sushi style of adding cream cheese and even one with flaming hot cheetos. The scallops we ordered on the side tasted good but not where I would go for quality sushi (though it probably isn&#39;t trying to lure in that population anyway). Gimmicky, good for kids or those seeking an intro to sushi only."

I know that conveyor belt sushi is often not the best idea, but I am a total sucker for it.  It&#39;s just so fun to see the sushi going around and around.  This one is a little more sanitary than others I&#39;ve been to because of the doors that separate the diners from the sushi.  Plus, the plates have covers over them.  So, the appearance of the place is definitely clean and neat.  

The sushi itself is pretty good, particularly because it&#39;s conveyor belt and the prices are so reasonable.  Against my better judgment, I ordered some nigiri to try based on the comments about good fish quality.  They were not bad, but certainly can&#39;t rival a much better (and much more expensive) sushi restaurant.  I tried escolar, marinated salmon, and saba.  The escolar and salmon weren&#39;t bad, but I wouldn&#39;t get the saba again--it was over marinated and a little tough.  I also tried some maki sushi that was pretty good.  They definitely have a lot of the Americanized type with a gazillion ingredients and sauces.  There was even one topped with flaming hot Cheetos when I was there!  I am more of a minimalist, but I am not too much of a snob to admit that Cheetos on sushi might taste good, though it&#39;s kind of silly (didn&#39;t try it this time, though).

Service was very friendly and prompt.  I went with a friend and they did separate checks for us, but only took one Groupon for the table.  I&#34;ll definitely go back to try some of the items that you need to order off the menu."

The service was fast and friendly, we had several sushi rolls and they were excellent, price was right. The atmosphere is bright, clean and lively. The only downside here is there choice of alcoholic beverages, they only have Japanese imported beer, which I notice a lot of sushi places have. You&#39;d think in this day of craft beer craziness they&#39;d have a few of those. They also only have bottles of wine, no by the glass wine... girlfriend didn&#39;t like that. They do offer sake, although neither one of us cares for it. We&#39;re definitely going back!"

Okay, my life is a little bit unexciting at times, but for me, this was a pretty exciting night. 

I loved this experience 100% and my wife and I already have plans to return another time. Now, admittedly, I found out about it from Andres D. and Candice G. who held an epic sushi throw down and Yelped about it. 

So we tried it this past Saturday night and it was just as awesome as they said. Conveyor belts that wound their way through the dining room with small plates of sushi (usually 4 pieces, but some had 2), incredibly attentive servers (we ordered one dish off the menu- the beef &amp; asparagus yakitori - amazing!) and a fun experience (when you see something you like, you open the little doors on the dome over the conveyor belt and grab it). The prices are determined by the color of the plate, and everything is pretty much under $7. 

You can have a little or you can have a lot. Being the pigs that we are, our meal was fairly expensive, but no worse than going out to any normal priced sushi restaurant. And due to my wife&#39;s fin-fish allergy, this way she was able to see exactly what she was about to eat without worrying about something she can&#39;t have. The descriptions of each plate roll by on a little sign prior to the actual dishes themselves. Totally user-friendly. 

The sushi was fresh, the prices were decent, service was awesome. Looking forward to a return trip."

The staff knows us, and caterers to us with attentive and welcoming service. We generally order large amounts of sushi directly from the kitchen and pick our maki-rolls from the conveyer belt. The place is fun, and it reminds me of the sleek sushi houses in Asia. Over the prices are extremely affordable compared to sushi restaurants in the area. I highly recommend Rotary.

It is so cool and such eye candy that I take my friends and family with young kids for their birthdays and for a nice enjoyable meal.  They all get a kick out of it!  

When I first heard of it, I was kind of turned off.  I had questions---like what if nobody wants the sushi on the belt, does it just keep revolving around until it&#39;s...gulp...spoiled???  No qualms!  The conveyor belt is in a refrigerated clear plexiglass tube that is enclosed, so no real reason why anything would spoil.  Each table has it&#39;s own &#34;door&#34; to open into the tube, and that&#39;s where you can self-serve your own plates of sushi.  I love how each dish is &#34;labelled&#34; with a sign that tells you what it is.  They certainly do know how to make each dish appetizing looking!  The dishes are each color-coded so that you know the price of each.  At the end of the meal the server will come by and add up your total that you own.

There is also a hot menu with skewers of beef and chicken, and also combo meals that you can order.  I personally prefer the chicken as I feel the beef is a bit tough the way they cook it.  All of the sushi items can also be ordered from the server off of a menu if you don&#39;t see what you want circling before your eyes.  Finally, various cheesecakes are offered too and they are located on the conveyor belt for you to peruse as you eat your meal.  

The food here is fun!  The atmosphere is fun!  It is nice a contemporary &amp; modern-looking and clean.  No worries!  What better way to enjoy a meal with friends &amp; family???"

Then in the span of a couple weeks I find out about this place and that Kampai in Elk Grove has it too. I had been to conveyor in Seattle and LA and was longing for a similar experience here.

Sushi + Rotary Sushi does it for me. At Sushi Station I&#39;ve experienced things like no food on the belt and icy salmon. Fun but way too inconsistent. Rotary has a clean but fun modern feel, helpful staff and surprisingly good quality sushi. Also the chefs were diligent about keeping the line stocked even though it was only lunch. Sushi-wise, I&#39;m usually wary of mackerel, but here it was fresh and not too metallic tasting. The smoked salmon was also great and probably my favorite plate.

I&#39;ve been to Sushi Para all you can eat far more times than I can think of, and while it&#39;s not unlimited at Rotary, I was still satisfied for the same price and with better tasting food. If only they&#39;d open one closer to the city..."

What I like about this place is the rotary. You can go and eat real quick and leave. If you like sushi you can get it pretty cheap too and if you go for maki it&#39;s still priced fairly. I also like how you can use the belly app here and use it for free plates and even gift cards.

One downside of having the rotary is I saw a kid with his family he dropped sushi on his table and put it back in the rotary. This is why I gave 4 stars, someone should have noticed this and removed it from the rotary. I couldn&#39;t have figured out which roll it was based on my seat but it&#39;s just not right. 

Overall, I do recommend this place and if you don&#39;t want to eat from the rotary you can still order the food at no additional charge which is nice.

I order the Chicago deep dish special, it was very good! I loved the crust, cheese, and the fresh tomatoes. Sauce is good, but had better. The  pizza was great, I can not complain. Before I return home. I will probably come by again. Customer service was awesome. Had to wait a little for the pizza, so the best thing to do is call the order in.

A Chicago style deep dish pizza. So we ordered a vegetarian pizza and a small sausage pizza from this joint. 

*Back story* We were once given a frozen small Lou Malnati pizza couple of years ago. One of our colleagues from Downers Grove had family visiting and got a few boxes for all us mid west migrants. It was very delicious and that was the reason behind trying this pizza out during our trip. 

We ordered delivery. Pizza was delivered within an hour and it was extremely hot to touch. The pizza was devoured by our hungry toddlers and family. We managed to complete both the pies in half an hour. The crust was a tad bit too crunchy/hard for my liking. I think Tony&#39;s Little Italy in Placentia, CA is better than this pizza&#39;s?"

I rate Lou Malnati&#39;s in Bolingbrook, IL a 4.5 but, will give a 4.0.

Solid, tasty pizza!  The thin, butter crust was a little bit more than I thought it would be compared to another Chicago deep dish eatery but, it works.  Pepperonis were on the top (and that&#39;s fine) and not blended  in like the other establishment I had tried that week.  Absolutely scrumptious cheese and spinach--also layered.  
All was tasty but, I was not completely wowwed that I&#39;d give a perfect rating. 

My family had picked up the deep dish pizza and brought it back home so I didn&#39;t get a chance to view the eatery itself.  When we return to Chicago, we will definitely return.  Perhaps the next slice would be the wow!! slice or slices.  Thanks LM!"

Pizza Hut&#39;s pizza was thicker than the pizza I got last night.  I ordered the personal pan Chicago style.  The waiter confirmed it was Chicago style and it was about 1/4 an inch thick...overcooked as well.  Now the people I was with ordered a small pizza and it was over an inch thick. So maybe it&#39;s just their personal pan pizzas.  Last time we went I got the thin crust and it was dry and overlooked also.  The salad was good with their house sweet onion. I might go back one more time to try a bigger size pizza.  If third time is not a charm it will be my last time there for pizza.

Ingredients are always fresh and copious amounts are placed on your pizza. Service is courteous and prompt  with fast friendly delivery.

The pricing of this establishment is essentially quite cost prohibitive and I only opt to order from there on special occasions when budget allows.

I ordered carry out, I picked it up and brought it home, very excited to dig into some great deep dish pizza. However, when I opened it, I was disappointed to see that whoever put the plastic cover to I guess keep it warmer had managed to pull the toppings completely off of one half the pizza and pulled them to the other side. I literally had half the pizza with crust and very minimal toppings on it. Needless to say, I won&#39;t be ordering from this location again.

Update: The Malnati&#39;s customer service team reached out to me and made it right by sending me a gift certificate for a free pizza. I certainly appreciate them doing it and will give them another shot at this location."

I would not be surprised to learn that wars have been fought  over the various kinds of pizza. On one side you would find the thin Quickly cooked New York style against  the deep dish Chicago style pizza.  On the different front you would find the fans of the mid western crispy crust pizza that may have originated around Saint Louis.   I avoid the whole argument by saying that all these Pizza&#39;s are different dishes under the general heading of Pizza and the best type is the kind want at the time.  This week, I was on a business trip to Bolingbrook , so I ordered a Delivery pizza from Luo Malnati&#39;s.  I just want to say it was a pretty life changing experience.  I can only judge the restaurant by the food and by the friendly way it was delivered.  I ordered fairly early knowing that these guys were pretty famous and it might take a while to get my pizza and they told me up front that it would be about an hour before i would get my delivery.  About  an hour later the delivery person showed up with my pizza.  It was piping hot and ready for me to eat.  The pizza itself was wonderful.   Close to a quarter inch of cheese covered the top of the delicious buttery crust  and the sweet Italian sausage on top of the cheese was meaty and perfectly seasoned.  Topping the sausage was a delightful tomato sauce that wasn&#39;t too sweet and wasn&#39;t too acidic. Sometimes, i find that tomato sauces can have too much acid.  I am usually not inclined to eat the outside crust or &#34;pizza bones&#34; as my family calls them. But the crust was so delicious i finished the whole slice with relish.  My stomach was full after the second piece but ate a third because the whole thing tasted so good.  My daughter lives in the north western Chicagoland and was familiar with Luo Malnati&#39;s.  Now that I have had one of their delightful pizzas, i&#39;ll be back."

I&#39;m all about New York style pizza. I wasn&#39;t even the hugest fan of deep dish after moving here. But I have to admit, Lou Malnati&#39;s made me a believer and now I have a hard time deciding if I like Lou&#39;s or my native pizza better. They&#39;re two completely different styles, but they&#39;re both awesome. Lou&#39;s has a thick, buttery crust and it&#39;s got the exact right amount of toppings. None of the other deep dish pizza places can even compare. My favorite toppings is the Giardiniera, it gives the pizza an awesome kick. I also love the garlic spinach. I do wish they had a pineapple pizza - but they do say all over their boxes that &#34;Lou doesn&#39;t do pineapple!&#34; Ah well, everything else makes up for it.

I&#39;ve only picked up orders from here, no delivery, but it&#39;s the Lou Malnati&#39;s quality you expect. I was so excited that they opened a location in Bolingbrook because before we had a little hike to Naperville to get this pizza.

This restaurant holds a special place in my heart; the first time I went to the Clubhouse was the day after my brother got married.
My favorites from the brunch buffet are the omelets that are cooked by a very nice Mexican man; he does it right in front of you, every time I go he always knows who I am, and says hi.  I also love the roast beef, shrimp, pastas and eggs benedict.  They have a big selection of desserts.
The service is always good.  The buffet prices are more than what I&#39;m used to for a buffet, but it doesn&#39;t hurt my wallet since I only go once every year or two.

The menu is standard fare for an &#34;American&#34; restaurant.  Large salads, steak, fish, chicken, etc.  The food is good, though a little expensive for something so typical.  The drinks are kind of pricey and the Bloody Mary was not spicy, as advertised.  I got one and was really disappointed.  Sigh.

The Clubhouse is a good place to go if you have a large group, want to meet friends, and want something slightly less expensive than the Greek place.

Portions were generous also, which made it more so like the famous chain. I ordered the salmon salad, which was a great healthy dinner option. I was very satisfied with my meal. The service could have been a little better, but everyone was nice and accommodating. My server was fairly new and just didn&#39;t know a lot about what she was doing. That being said, it was a nice solid pick of a restaurant at the oak brook mall!"

We had brunch on Sunday 11/13. This was my first time but my boyfriend has been here before. Great food and good service.  There was a group of ladies celebrating a birthday near us - they were pretty loud I mean way over the top. Some of the wait staff were even giving them looks.

Get the lamp chop if they has it as special.  
Lunch salad and lobster bisque are in good portion, fresh and tasty.  
The Sunday brunch is awesome.  Our favorite are the prime rib, crab crawl, oysters, banana walnut french toast.  This place is crowded so be sure to make reservation.  The staffs are well trained and professional.  Most have been there for a long time.  We are minority and always feel comfortable with the staffs there.

A $20 off appetizer / dessert deal from the &#34;Taste of Hope&#34; event was helpful encouragement, but I was also in the mood for a decent dinner when I went as well.

And a decent dinner it was. Sat at the bar as I was up for a drink or two - service there overall was pretty good and pleasant, though the food was a little slow to come out of the kitchen. Discovered a crab cake appetizer and figured that would be the best use for my freebie. I was right - one of the best crab cakes I&#39;ve had anywhere, just the right amount of sauce on the dish and cooked to a nice crispiness, yet was very moist when I dug in.

A great selection of entrees to choose from, but the Jambalaya is what caught my eye. Jambalaya is one of those dishes that I rarely if ever go &#34;looking for&#34;, but if I see it on a menu, I usually order it. Glad that I did - flavorful Andouille sausage, shrimp - without tails - and chicken cooked in Cajun spices. When delivered, it didn&#39;t look very large, but as I dug in, I discovered that it was a pretty hearty portion. 

One thing I did notice... an elderly couple came in around 8:45 and waited at the host stand, unattended. Finally after about five minutes, it appeared that they had come in with the intent of ordering dinner, but were turned away - too close to 9PM?  Not entirely certain of the situation as I did not hear the conversation, but if this was the case, that&#39;s not right. If it says 9 &#34;on the door&#34;, then that&#39;s what it should be."

It&#39;s not, far from it, actually. Went there for their Brunch. And for $35/person buffet, expected there to be some quality food. Extremely, mediocre, food is what I got. Definitely not worth the insane price tag. The English muffins the Eggs Benedict were on has the consistency of jerky. The seating arrangement was awful and clearly set up by an incompetent idiot. Our table of 7 had 3 seats backed into a corner, and a 4th extremely close to another table. So if any of those 4 people needed to get up, almost the whole table had to, for them to get out. The bus boys were not very attentive, every time we needed water we had to flag them down. For the ridiculous price they charge, they should do a much better job checking on patrons. Overall very frustrated and disappointed. Only way I&#39;m going back is if I get paid to go back."

Of course I am writing this review from my living room couch as i am still digesting my food from The Clubhouse. The Christmas brunch was my first time visiting the Clubhouse and I thought it was a great unconventional place to spend some of Christmas. 

Our waitress, was a little under the weather, so service wasn&#39;t a 10, but she did very well under the circumstances. She was very apologetic for some of the small issues during our meal, and I appreciated that. 

The food options were plentiful for both meat eaters and vegetarians, but more so for meat eaters.  They offered some pretty good salads, cheeses, chilled seafood, pastas, carving stations, breakfast foods, and many desserts. By many desserts, I really mean that there was almost every dessert you could ever want.  The whole spread was pretty impressive, but I would expect nothing less for almost $50 a person. Thumbs up to the Clubhouse for providing a wonderful Christmas brunch experience."

I&#39;ve been to The Clubhouse before for a private work event; the food was good and it was well executed, so it seemed like a good choice for us.

The Thanksgiving buffet menu is great; there&#39;s something for everyone (except maybe vegans). There were traditional sides and fixings, prime rib, ham, raw bar, pasta bar and much more. We weren&#39;t sure how many people went out for Thanksgiving, but at 4 the place was packed, without seeming chaotic.

We dined upstairs and I have no complaints. Serving dishes were frequently replenished. The choices were vast. The food quality was high. In other words, we wanted for nothing and left stuffed to the gills.

I&#39;d recommend The Clubhouse again for a holiday meal."

I usually base my ratings on my overall experience with the restaurant, but my most recent visit has really tarnished my view of The Clubhouse.

I came here on Memorial Day for my mother&#39;s 63rd birthday. The restaurant was empty when we arrived, and we were immediately seated. Our server, Nickolai, greeted us and told us about the specials. We ordered a lot of food and she provided great recommendations.

When the appetizers were brought out, half of them were cold. It was 4pm, at that time, and we hadn&#39;t eaten all day so we ate them cold. We did, however, inform our server that the some of the food was cold but we ate it because we were hungry. She didn&#39;t apologize, took our plates, made a face, and ROLLED her eyes! I&#39;m not hard to please. A simple &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34; would suffice, but we couldn&#39;t even get that. Instead she responded with a rude, unprofessional attitude.

We informed Nickolai that our appetizers were cold to assure that the rest of our food would be hot, not to make an aimless complaint. Our server proceeded to bring out cold soup and cold entrees. The vast majority of our food was COLD. We sent it back and asked to speak to the manager, Brett. 

Brett was really helpful and worked hard to enhance our experience. He hand delivered our hot food and threw in champagne with my mothers free birthday dessert. He also comped a good portion of the meal. When the food was hot, it was delicious! I had the Salmon BLT, which is a new addition to the menu. It is fantastic! 

Thanks to Brett, I had an OK experience. It was very kind of him to go out of his way to try to make things right, but I wish I received quality service without getting the manager involved."

Great place to eat, hello....... Middle of Oakbrook Mall.  

Only one bathroom on the first floor, strange for the size of the place.  If you want, climb a rather long staircase to go to a much larger bathroom upstairs... So do not wait till the last minute if you have to go... Ha.  

Service.. Pretty ok.  Not overly impressed, but not horrible neither.  

Not a bad option for OB Mall....."

When we arrived, we were promptly seated by the woman at the front (she wasn&#39;t very pleasant, but the server made up for it). We ordered some bubbly and our entrees. I ordered the Southwestern Chicken Wrap with French fries. It was delicious!!! My companions both ordered the fish tacos that came with different toppings and a Mexican style coleslaw and they had great things to say about it. The server was very prompt and checked in with us. He was very friendly and we didn&#39;t have to wait a long time for our beverages or meals.
I will say that the prices are a little higher than average for what you&#39;re ordering and based on conversations I had with others, I&#39;m not the only one that feels this way.
Regarding their food, they get 5 stars, but their prices and the women at the front bring their rating down to 4 stars since they can&#39;t be bothered on arrival or on our way out. I hope they improve on the first and last impressions."

I&#39;ve had the Filet Mignon as well which again was cooked perfectly (med rare) and melted in my mouth.  You can&#39;t go wrong ordering fish or steak here.

On weekends, they have a great brunch upstairs which is buffet style and I think around $25-30 a person. If you have a big enough appetite, it&#39;s worth it. But you can also sit downstairs and order off the regular menu. They have brunch specials like $4 mimosas."

My old job would give us gift cards to this restaurant. I&#39;ve never had a problem, Ive always been happy with my food, and their mojitos are AMAZING! 
For New Year&#39;s Eve last week my boyfriend and I decided to go here for NYE dinner. I worked until that 9 that night (damn healthcare industry) so I looked for a place near by that could accommodate us, last minute for a very late dinner. I came across the Clubhouse. I made my reservation online on their website. I had to make my reservation with s credit card and there was a warning that there would be a 25.00 charge for not showing up. I made our reservation for 10:00pm but we got there a little early. So we found a spot at the bar and had done drinks. My boyfriend had whiskey and I had a Raspberry mojito, it was fabulous! The right amount of everything in my drink. We were finally sent a text telling us that our table was ready and we were told to go upstairs and check in. We were taken to a nice little table. I had never been upstairs, had only been on the lower level, so I was impressed at how huge this place really is. 
For NYE they were offering a special menu and a 6 course dinner, which was affordable and the price was per couple. We decided not to go with the 6 course meal and I kind of regret it, not for myself but for my boyfriend. We ordered the scallops wrapped in bacon as an appetizer. Our appetizer was excellent! Nice size scallops, great flavor, they were served over a bed of greens. For my entree I ordered the shrimp and lobster risotto and my boyfriend ordered the grilled salmon. My meal was fantastic! The risotto was amazing, it had plenty of shrimp and my lobster was a decent size. The portion was big enough that I had leftovers. My boyfriends meal on the other hand was not do great. His salmon was drier than the desert. He kept dipping his pieces in the sauce that it came with but it was still dry. I didn&#39;t taste of but it looked dry, dehydrated piece of fish. We aren&#39;t ones to complain, so he ate what he could, his fish came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Both sides were good. At the end of the meal and after we paid we told the server that the fish was real dry, he asked if it was supposed to be that way and she said no. She described it as being very moist. Ok so they dropped the ball and over cooked it. At that point she couldn&#39;t do anything so she said next time let her know before. Ok no problem. Our server was ok, friendly enough, can&#39;t say she was attentive since she only checked on us once during our meal and it was at the end of our meal, can&#39;t blame her I think it was a busy night. 
For NYE they had a DJ playing and they were offering free champagne for the midnight toast. I thought that was pretty cool. After dinner we headed back downstairs and enjoyed people watching. We waited till midnight, had our champagne, danced a few songs and left. Fast forward 5 days and my boyfriend noticed 3 charges from the clubhouse. One for our pre dinner drinks at the bar, one for dinner and an extra charge of $100. We did not know where that charge came from. He called them and the manager wasn&#39;t in. He got a hold someone yesterday and they said they would look into it, and today he got a call and told him that they are reversing the charge. We don&#39;t know how it happened or why he was charged but that left a sour taste in our mouth. Probably won&#39;t be returning although that risotto was delicious!"

I talked a friend into coming here for lunch because I had a graving for chicken pot pie. How is this a favorite!? Three bites of chicken, zero peas, no sauce and nothing but mashed potatoes. Worst experience I&#39;ve ever had here.

Service wasn&#39;t much better. Waitress went to three different tables and refilled ice tea and then went off to get a customer&#39;s coat, fine...that&#39;s a good thing, if I had to wait another few minutes for her to come back and I still needed to flag her down for a refill Really?

We were on our own for the holiday and thought we would go somewhere fancy that had all of our must haves: prime rib, oysters, and a chocolate fountain.

We made reservations a week in advance and had to settle for 10AM as that and 5 PM were the only time slots left.  The holiday brunch was about $20 more expensive than their regular Sunday Brunch.  I didn&#39;t mind this because it was a holiday, but now looking at their regular brunch menu - it didn&#39;t have anything different on Easter to justify the premium price.  

I did really appreciate that they had two buffets out - one for each floor so that people dining upstairs didn&#39;t have to trek down that staircase to get to the food each time.  I will also say that they replenished the food frequently and almost everything was fantastic.  The only negatives for me were on the seafood table.  I am a huge seafood fan - so I was really looking forward to oysters and crab claws, but they were awful.  As others have said, they were obviously frozen and not fresh at all.  The oysters were not cleaned properly and after one bite of seafood from here - I stuck to the rest of the buffet.  The prime rib was awesome as well as the other cooked items.  The dessert station was great - but I wish that they would have had some labels to distinguish what the different cakes/pastries were.  

I will also say that our server was phenomenal.  Granted he didn&#39;t have to serve us any food, but he was super friendly and kept our table clean of old plates.  He was also great about refilling drinks.  It was a pretty good brunch overall, but I would have given more stars if the seafood were any good and if I weren&#39;t paying a premium for the same food I could have on any other Sunday."

They used to have these bone-in steaks that were just sublime. That&#39;s no longer on the menu. We have tried other dishes but they&#39;ve either been too dry or insipid in general.

I have to say, the process was really smooth. To be honest, I had called some other restaurants first and they would not take a party that large. The Clubhouse was great about it. They did ask for a credit card and said I would be charged if we cancelled day of, but that was fine. As soon as 3/4 of the party was there we were able to sit down. We sat upstairs and the place was decorated beautifully for the holidays. Many large groups were there as well. We had 2 servers for the table, which was awesome and they even offered to split checks. I was so surprised they did that! I had told everyone to bring cash since it was a large party but they did the checks with no problem. Our male waiter was a little rough around the edges and we felt like he was rushing us a bit. One of my friends arrived and still had her coat on and hadn&#39;t even sat down before he was handing her a drink of water. However, by the end of the night he was better and even took a few pictures of the group for us.

My friend and I started with the bruschetta, which was very good. I had the lobster bisque and wedge salad and both were awesome. My only complaint with the salad was that there was way too much dressing on it and the bottom part was soaked. I would get it again but dressing on the side most likely. A different friend and I shared the creme brulee for dessert, and while it wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had, it was decent and large enough to share. I didn&#39;t drink, but almost everyone else did and seemed to enjoy their drinks. People ordered all sorts of entees from the Ahi Tuna to the Chicken Picatta and everyone seemed to like their food. Our waitress did an awesome dessert presentation and almost everyone ended up ordering something. The desserts are huge and most come in half sizes as well. 

There is valet out front, but there was a line up to use it when we arrived and then it took a really long time to get our cars after because they went from 2 valets down to 1. I know that&#39;s not technically the restaurant, but I would recommend more valet employees during such a busy time of year.

Anyone that dines out with large groups knows that it can be a problem sometimes, but the Clubhouse did a great job accommodating us and we really enjoyed ourselves."

If you take one thing away from this, get the brunch buffet. They have the best prime rib it was so tender and delightful. Also they have basically everything you would want. The shellfish area had left something to be desired but was still very good dont get me wrong. The dessert table tho... do not miss the dessert table. Chocolate fountain,  the creme brulee... get out of here! The drink menu was moderately priced and very tastey. Also, the kids food game is super strong mac and cheese was very good. They have small pb&amp;js which are so cute. I will most definitely be returning."

Continuously our food was sent out cold; even after stating to our waitress Nikolai that our appetizers were cold, cold entrees were sent out. When making our waitress aware, she did not apologize, yet instead she made an annoyed face. After receiving our entrees cold, my party asked to speak to a manager, and the greeter Kim asked him loud and clear as he was approaching us, &#39;are you ready&#39;, as if talking to us was going to take extra energy or be a hassle. When making the waitress and server who brought out the food aware that our food was continuously cold, our concerns were not addressed and their attitudes were disingenuous. 

Our experience did not turn for the better until the manager Brett came over. He was very apologetic and addressed our concerns. This occasion was my mom&#39;s 63rd birthday, and it was not a joyous occasion.

If it were not for Brett, I feel as if our concerns and the lack of customer care would have continued to fall on deaf ears. 

I would have given this experience if possible zero stars, but because the manager took control of the situation I&#39;ll give it one. All of my prior experiences at The Clubhouse were superb, which is why I&#39;m even more disappointed. I&#39;ll just assume that since it was Memorial Day, maybe the staff just had a more relaxed attitude towards service excellence. 

I would like to point out, that despite being treated poorly, my party was polite and respectful towards the staff in verbalizing our concerns. I tend to always and try to give every establishment the best reviews if you would look at my Yelp history. Thanks Brett, for trying to turn the experience around! I appreciate the happy birthday dessert for my mom. I WOULD GIVE BRETT 5 STARS. Despite the poor service turnaround, we still tipped our waitress $20.00."

Drinks, I had a couple of Jack sours and they were terrific. Then we started with the garbage salad. Big enough for two and had lots of chicken. I then went for the $19 dollar vodka pasta. Seriously! It looked like the watery mess I would come up with when I didn&#39;t know how to cook. It was flavorless and swimming in sauce with boxed noodles. Now I looked over the menu prior to ordering and it seemed like they are going after the value conscious shopper at the mall. Everything was quite inexpensive, except what I ordered. But the burgers for $13 bucks seemed cheap for this location. That is what my buddy got and then couldn&#39;t get off of the pot the next day. I had the right choice on a bad menu. I got the key lime pie which looks like a small pie. Overly sweet and as my buddy said. It&#39;s Cool Whip on top. Yup! I could taste the plastic. Did I mention the service? Our server shot out of the gate and had a good stride. Til the couple next to us left and we were all alone in back of the stairs. We had to wave him down to get another drink. When he brought it to us he asked if we wanted dessert and walked away. After 10 minutes he came back with the check and asked if we were all set. Um! NO! I ordered desert and a drink. We got the keylime and no drink. When he came back after 15 minutes, we gave up on more alcohol and parted ways. If I would have known this before I would have sold the certificate at a loss and gone to Wildfire."

The coconut shrimp were large and came with quirky &#34;Styrofoam&#34; noodle thingies, as well as a tasty dipping sauce.  The lobster bisque was positively delicious.  Their breaded fish dish (can&#39;t remember what species it was) was nothing special, but the plate presentation was great and the redskin mashed potatoes were enjoyable.  My burger cost w-a-y too much, even though it was cooked perfectly to a medium-rare state.  The blue cheese fries (an extra $2) that accompanied it were dusted with red pepper flakes and tasted out of this world.

We didn&#39;t order booze or soft drinks, choosing to stick with water only, and the tab STILL came out to be ~$60 + tax/tip.  Probably the most expensive lunch I&#39;ve had up until this point in my life, but I suppose it was worth it......maybe?......ehhhh"

The Clubhouse was suggested for their good food. The food was good. 

What tainted the experience was the service. From the time we got there, before we could even irritate the server he had an attitude.  
He was rude and condescending.

Why a man who makes their living on tips is rude is beyond me.
The whole attitude ruined any goodness that the chef&#39;s put into the food.
It appeared that either the server did not want to be there 
      or he did not want us there.

I made a reservation weeks in advance because of the holiday and I&#39;m glad I did because this place was completely slammed. People from all walks of life come from miles around.

Robert S. recommended this place to me as a great date spot.  Ended up here on Feb. 15th.  It was so busy that the hostess told us it was totally booked, and there was only first come first serve tables in and around the bar.  I was able to find a couple seats at the bar. Ended up ordering all sorts of appetizers, chili and a seafood Cobb salad.  It was all great.  I don&#39;t even like chili, but the Prime Rib Chili here is amazing. It&#39;s a MUST try.  The calamari was great.  I really liked the sweet chili ginger sauce they use instead of the traditional tartar or marinara. And we basically fought over the last buffalo shrimp. They were that good.  And the bartender that served us our drinks and food was friendly, helpful and fast.

Second trip here was brunch with mom.  Check out my pictures.  That food was as tasty as it looked.  I couldn&#39;t find a single item that didn&#39;t taste perfectly prepared. Everything was served at the right temp, which is no small feat in a busy buffet.  Items were refreshed promptly, as were our drinks.  

I don&#39;t know for sure, but this may be the best brunch in the &#39;burbs(throws down the gauntlet)."

Yes, it definitely has its perks such as the decor. However, when my guests and i arrived we were not greeted in a friendly manner. The hostess did not even smile and seemed irritated. In fact, many of the workers did.  Our waitress was friendly but hardly came to the table. On to the food, we ordered the artichoke dip as an appetizer and, I must admit, it was the highlight of the entire meal. The cheese was perfectly melted into the artichoke and it was so so delicious. For my entree, I ordered the sea food cobb salad and thought it was okay. I&#39;m a salad queen and had way better salads in my days. My guests both ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and said they enjoyed it. At the end of the meal, we noticed the samples of desserts they had displayed.

My friend ordered a burger.  Nothing fancy.

After 25 minutes our waiter asked if we got our food.  Ummm... Nope.
 After30 minutes and our find did arrive, my salad had croutons on it.
They took it back to fix it.  
So my friend ate her meal while I sat there and vice versa.

I ordered the Tilapia last time and it was very good. The only part of the meal that was not up to the mark were the dense mashed potatoes. Other than that, the dining experience was pretty pleasant. You have to try their flavored lemonades! I ordered the peach lemonade and loved it.

As others have mentioned, the only drawback is mall parking on a busy weekend. I would recommend The Clubhouse to those who are looking for a good meal and great service at a classy spot in Oak Brook.

Decor is nice, but I think it&#39;s time for an update.  Food is pretty consistently good.  So at least you know that if you come here, you are in for a pretty decent meal.  Brunch is great here.  If you have any vegan peeps in your party,  more than likely your vegan peeps will order something off the menu instead of eating the brunch, you will have to be seated downstairs while the brunch is upstairs.  So if you have people in your party that have trouble walking, it&#39;s kind of a pain to go up and down.. even though there is an elevator... just something to keep in mind.  

Service is pretty consistent as well.  Everyone is nice, quick and efficient.  My most recent meal was just me and my daughter and our server was so nice to her and talked with her.  It&#39;s nice for her to get interaction like that from servers.  

I had the house salad.  it was great, but a tad over dressed.  Wish I had asked for the balsamic vinaigrette on the side.  Their mushroom soup is decadent and rich.  Glad I just had a cup vs. a bowl.  My daughter had the chicken and fries, these were great!  It&#39;s not the traditional flour breading, it&#39;s rice and it&#39;s really crispy and delicious.  They weren&#39;t greasy at all!!!  I live pretty close so it&#39;s nice to have a standby when you want to go somewhere a little nicer.  

Only con is that you have to deal with mall parking .. and during the holidays .. GOOD LUCK ... I am seriously opposed to valet parking (unless it&#39;s free) in the suburbs ... so that is really the only bad thing."

The Clubhouse is a super trendy place with super fantastic food. A bit on the pricey side, but the portions are big and the restaurant itself is very put together. I love coming here because I legit feel like I&#39;m ballin&#39;. All the while I can order gourmet American food from a menu that has countless options that are sure to satisfy my tastebuds. Of course I&#39;ve ventured their drink menu as well - love a good martini! Their Flirtini and Clubhouse Martini are my fave.

I&#39;ve been here for my friend&#39;s birthday and also to celebrate my own 21st (back in the day half a decade ago). It&#39;s a great accommodating spot for groups. They have tables downstairs (as well as a bar), upstairs and outside - the place is huge! Plus, the menu includes a ton of fan favorites so you&#39;re sure to please everyone!

I&#39;ve had a number of entrees here, but most recently I enjoyed the Seafood Cobb Salad and their famous Lobster Bisque. The salad was perfection. If you&#39;re a seafood lover like myself, you&#39;re in for a treat! One (huge) bowl holds these mouthwatering ingredients: Shrimp, jumbo lump crab meat, mixed greens, plum tomatoes, green onions, blue cheese crumbles, bacon, black olives, hard boiled egg, avocado and ranch dressing....PHEW! That. just. happened. AMAZE. The lobster bisque was not as spot on as the salad, but it was good. Not the best I&#39;ve had, but definitely still tasty!

Each week The Clubhouse also has different specials going on - so that&#39;s a good feeling for your wallet. The location is super convenient, perfect ending to a day of shopping :)

Final thought: If the entree you order doesn&#39;t come with fries, either get a side of them or steel from your friends plate. These fresh cut beauties won&#39;t disappoint."

We had a 7pm function to attend and did not arrive until 8pm! We did share the Valentine dinner, but did not have the dessert because we had run out of time and the dinner was bad. My steak was cooked too long, and my husband&#39;s potatoes were crunchy on top because they were obviously under the lights too long.

I have been here several times for casual dining. Our company has also used the restaurant for holiday parties. The staff members are attentive and the management team is obviously present and ready to direct and assist.

Today I ordered the vodka pasta with chicken and my guest ordered the salmon. She let me taste hers and it was delicious! Mine was great as well. The sauce was creamy and the pasta was cooked perfectly. 

When I ordered, I ordered the pasta with chicken, but it&#39;s possible I spoke too softly or the waitress didn&#39;t hear me. Anyway, something happened and the pasta came out with no chicken. One of the management team members came to check on us as soon as the food arrived and I mentioned that I ordered it with chicken and he immediately apologized, took the plate, and said it would be out very soon. The waitress also came over and took complete responsibility for the mistake and didn&#39;t make any excuses for herself or the kitchen. It was a very pleasant and customer service oriented way to handle the situation.

THEN when the new plate came out, the management team member said to save room for dessert because he&#39;d like to offer us one. This was not necessary, but quite indicative of how The Clubhouse takes care of their guests and corrects mistakes. So we did end up taking him up on the offer. The chocolate truffle cake with ice cream was to die for. Wow. A great end to a fantastic dining experience!"

They were polite and accommodating when I notified them that most of our group was running late (as they should be since it was mostly empty at 7pm on a Friday night).  My one friend who arrived on time and I sat at the bar and had awesome Moscow Mules and some beef tacos while we waited. The tacos were pretty mediocre, sort of reminded me of Taco Bell.  Anywho, on to dinner. We all ordered drinks and appetizers to start.  Once we placed our dinner orders, we pretty much never saw our server again, which means we never got a second cocktail.  I tried making eye contact with him several times with no luck. For dinner, I had the chicken and mushroom pasta which was full of fancy delicious mushrooms but a little light on the chicken.  All in all, this place was not thrilling by any stretch of the imagination, but could be a nice place to take your grandparents if the service was better,"

Our servers could not do enough for us, they were always available but never hovering.  We didn&#39;t have to ask for more water or coffee, they were right there.  Can&#39;t say enough good things about the experience.  My gratitude to the management and staff for making this event memorable.

My husband and I tend to come here on special date nights such as birthdays etc. So we usually splurge when we are here. Steaks are delicious. Salmon in the orange cream sauce makes me want to lick the plate. Shepherd&#39;s Pie is put so artistically on your plate. These are just a few good things to eat here.

I love that the service is usually spot on. If you are celebrating even the tiniest thing, you will probably get some type of free dessert with a &#34;Congrats on the Baby&#34; or &#34;Happy B-day&#34; written on the plate in chocolate. 

That being said, there are a few things that I don&#39;t exactly love about The Clubhouse. 
- The decor needs to be re-vamped in the worst way. Everything looks like it is from the early 90&#39;s and they haven&#39;t done anything since then. 
- The bathroom situation on the first floor is seriously a problem. ONE stall for men and ONE stall for women. I know you don&#39;t get seated on the first floor very often, but when you do you have to inevitably run upstairs to use the facilities. If you are pregnant or have kids, you know what a pain this could be.
- If you are in the mood for something easy like a sandwich, I wouldn&#39;t suggest ordering it from here. Way too expensive for a cold, deli meat sandwich. Ugh.
- While most servers are amazing here, there have been a few times that the servers seemed confused with food orders etc.
- There are many tables that are situated in horrible spots. Such as near the stairs, near the bathroom, near a walkway so there are constantly people walking 2 inches from your chair etc. 
- Their famous Lobster Bisque is like drinking hot cream with teeny tiny pieces of lobster. I&#39;d say pass on this and order the chili instead!

We also came here this past Valentine&#39;s day and decided to order off the pre-fixe menu. This came with a petit filet mignon as well as crab-stuffed shrimp. My husband ordered his medium and I ordered mine medium well. His came out rare and mine was burnt to a well done crisp. We unfortunately had to send both of ours back, when we got our steaks out the second time and they were correct. However, once our steaks were fixed our shrimps were cold. We didn&#39;t have the heart to send our food back a second time so we just dealt with it. But when you are paying over $100 on a meal, I think that is horrible. So just watch out for pre-fixe menus because you might not get the quality they normally turn out.

Overall I really enjoy this place. I will be coming back for the next special night out!"

AYCE Sunday brunch, likely one of the best I have been to recently. For the low price of 29.95 this is a top notch Sunday spread. The hot carving station includes slow roasted prime rib (better than a steak house) and turkey/ham. They make omelets to order. Other breakfast items include pancake, french toast with banana and walnuts, eggs, bacon etc. The highlighted items include the chicken picatta cooked to perfection and vodka pasta. They used to have a white fish dish as well. From the cold display there is smoked salmon, shrimp cocktail, and crab claws (small versions of rock crab claws). There is also a wide selection of salads and cheese spread. The dessert is top notch with a chocolate fountain and a wide selection of pastries. I will be back!

Pro: wide selection of Sunday brunch items, all you can eat crab claws (small but tasty), smoked salmon, chocolate fountain. All fresh and tasty

Cons: Pricy but worth it, make reservation of prepare for a long wait

Hidden gem:  Sign up for the really nice restaurant frequent diner club. You pay 25 dollars, but they give you back 25 dollar food credit. Also when you dine on Sunday you get double the points. Also on your anniversary of signing up you get 50 dollars in food credit also on your birthday 50 dollars as well. Good deal!"

My colleagues and I were looking for a place to eat and came across The Clubhouse. The restaurant is huge with 2 floors, and the decor reminded me of an upscale circus, like Cirque du Soleil. Looking around it looked very similar to a restaurant that used to be located inside South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, CA but closed down several years back. I asked the hostess and she confirmed that they indeed used to have a restaurant in California but this now was the only location.

We all had flown in earlier that day and were ready for a round of drinks. I settled on a Lemon Drop Martini. It was ok, but I&#39;ve had better. There just wasn&#39;t enough lemon flavor.

For a starter to my meal, I ordered a Wedge Salad (iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, red onion, bleu cheese crumbles, bleu cheese dressing). The salad was so good, very refreshing.

For my entree I ordered the Kobe Burger (8oz kobe beef burger, monterey jack cheese, mixed greens tossed in balsamic vinaigrette, tomato, caramelized onion, garlic aioli, brioche bun). I ordered the patty medium rare. It comes w/a choice of fresh cut fries or creamy coleslaw. I like coleslaw but since I was already getting a salad with my meal, I opted for a side of sweet potato fries. The burger was really good, 4 stars good. The patty was juicy &amp; temperature cooked to perfection, the bun was super soft and the flavors of all the toppings meshed well together.

A couple of us shared Creme Brulee for dessert. It was topped with a few pieces of strawberries &amp; blueberries and a dollop of whipped cream. We were both so disappointed with this dessert. The texture was so dense, almost like flan, and there wasn&#39;t much of a sugar topping. Fail!

Overall, my meal was A-OK!

Fun fact: Oak Brook is a small town with a population of only 7,937 (2011 census) and is home to the world headquarters of McDonald&#39;s, Ace Hardware, Blistex, and the non-profit organization Lions Clubs International."

The server was very attentive and I really enjoyed the ambiance. The bar area was pretty busy but the our booth tucked away and surprisingly quiet. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of parking! Many of the restaurants at Oakbrook Centre are tight on parking and require a valet, but The Clubhouse is has plenty of parking and I was able to park right up front. Definitely a plus!"

We each got a cup of lobster bisque, side salad (house with balsamic vinegrette and bleu cheese for me, caesar for hubby), 16 oz prime rib w/ rice and vegetables (asparagus for hubby, spinach for me), and shared a slice of chocolate cake for $99. We also got a beer and a side of bleu cheese fries ($7)... we did not know a &#34;side&#34; meant a huge table portion made for 4-5 people!!! But it was really good. We were both so full that we asked if we could get a lot of food boxed up, including my untouched prime rib. Two different people boxed up our prime ribs. When we got home, we realized both of them did not include the au jus sauce!!! Thus, we had to eat it them dry. =( This seems to be a common occurrence at the Clubhouse for us. We keep forgetting to ask but we think it&#39;s expected! If it comes with the meal at the restaurant, it should be boxed up as well. Anyway, the food was all yummy as usual!

13th visit: Crab and brie fondue and vodka pasta. YUM.

14th visit: Crab and brie fondue, vodka pasta, bleu cheese fries, and ribeye cooked medium rare. I did not enjoy the ribeye- it was too burnt on the outside. =("

They need to shut down for a week or so and rehab the entire place.  The chairs are all beat up, the carpeting on the cool spiral staircase is threadbare, and the huge funky lamps look dirty.

That said, I enjoy having lunch here.  Get the lobster bisque.  Seriously, get the lobster bisque.  The bar is fun but beware on Thursdays and Fridays it turns into cougar town.  I guess that could be fun too but I&#39;m not a 20 something year old male so I digress.

Pass on the Sunday brunch.  It is way too crowded, very loud, seating is cramped and for some reason, every large family in the Chicago area makes this their brunch destination.  It&#39;s hard to navigate the trek from your table to the buffet stations among tables with seating for 12-20 people.  The brunch buffet itself is OK but not great.  Since it&#39;s so crowded, the food doesn&#39;t get replenished as often as it should.  Carving station and omelette station are both decent but nothing other brunch places don&#39;t have.  I prefer Shaws for Sunday brunch over this place.

So go here for a cocktail and some soup.  Pass on the brunch."

They&#39;ve been open for a few years now and I&#39;m impressed with their ability to maintain consistent quality. Although I can&#39;t speak to any one dish in particular, every time I eat here I am impressed, full, happy, and glad I came.

I had high hopes for this place and wanted to really enjoy it. First, ambience and greeting was on par with Red Lobster, the noise level was off the charts and it felt chaotic and disorganized.  The first floor was open for lunch and several people were waiting for seating.  The buffet brunch was on the second level and we took an elevator up, were immediately seated in the window overlooking the parking lot, which wasn&#39;t the worst thing in the world but the sun beating down on us was unbearable,  Rather than moving to an area that was even noisier, we had them lower the shades, even though the wait person quipped &#34;you can always get a tan!&#34;  The buffet was explained with a run through of the variety of foods: omelette station, carving station, cold shellfish, hot entrees, breakfast staples and a dessert station.  Off we ran to the shellfish, hungry for oysters on the half shell, crab claws and poached shrimp, stopping to also grab some smoked salmon, cream cheeses and a half bagel.  

What can I say:  the oysters hadn&#39;t even been loosened from the shell, and tasted rancid...kiss of death.  The shrimp were well poached in the shell but had nasty black veins running up the backs...not cleaned... promising a foul and gritty bite.  The crab claws were freezer burned and still partially frozen and melting onto my plate, also inedible!  The smoked salmon was good, only success on the cold table.  Feeling disappointed I returned to the buffet trying to find some breakfast staples that I&#39;d enjoy.  The French toast, sausage and scrambled eggs sufficed.  But the salmon, although well cooked was definitely NOT FRESH!  The carving station had some tasteless roast beef.

Both times we returned to our table the old plates hadn&#39;t been cleared away and we had to wait, had to ask for utensils and more napkins that were gone,  I would not recommend this place at all for a $39.95 brunch. The coffee was insipid and I could have spent half that for breakfast at the pancake house and enjoyed it more! Plus I felt I was running the risk of eating rancid seafood!  Double yuk, and if I could I would give it no stars, better yet it owes me stars!  I couldn&#39;t wait to get out of this place! 

This morning my daughter who stayed home from work with diarrhea, and vomiting all night long, called the restaurant to inform them she&#39;d gotten sick.  Their comment, &#34;feel better!&#34;

Stay away!"

Brunch reservations were made for a recent Sunday.  Requested seating in the Club Room because it tends to be quieter and more relaxed.  Were being shown to a table in the main room where the buffet is set up and where you can barely hear the conversation.  When I informed the hostess of my request when making the reservation she took us to the worst. smallest table in the Club Room which was not even set up for service.  Asked if we could sit at a larger table, but was informed that she had no other ones available.  Apparently she has x-ray vision because she could see into all of the other rooms.  Attitude of the staff is terrible.  Most stand around looking self-important, but doing little to accommodate guests.  Sorry Clubhouse, but that was the last strike.

of TEA was extra.
 Also the dessert table was a mini version of what used to be. Overall, I would say that the Clubhouse food /buffet has become mediocre and overpriced and not worth the trip my friends and I took from Chicago."

I first came here for work in 2007, and it quickly jumped the list of favorite places in the suburbs. Between items I&#39;ve ordered and those I&#39;ve tried of others&#39;, the food is consistently fantastic with a rich flavor (but not too much so!).

Two words of advice: LOBSTER BISQUE. I&#39;ve had Lobster Bisque in Boston, at Gibson&#39;s, at other fine dining restaurants...nothing beats the Clubhouse&#39;s version. It is rich, creamy...and lobster-y :) It has a lobster flavor unlike any other soups I&#39;ve tried at other establishments, and it is consistent every time. 

More advice: Join the Frequent Diners club. It&#39;s $20, and you get a free dessert the day you buy it, and multiple deals throughout the year...$50 for your birthday and your anniversary month (anniversary of joining). 

I cannot literally list everything I&#39;ve had here, but I&#39;ll say my two favorites are the Carne Asada Cobb Salad, and the Tuscan Sliders. And if your menu choice comes with fries (or maybe even if it doesn&#39;t) order the blue cheese fries! Amazing.

Lastly - the brunch is a great deal also. Come hungry!"

The dessert table was fun and the chocolate fountain a treat since I dip bacon on it - Yummy. 

Our server was fantastic; he was polite, funny, and on top of our needs. 

The downside, I truly disliked the women at the front desk.  They were into themselves, rude, and snooty.  They were not paying attention to the needs of their guests as they were more interested in carrying on with their private conversations.  They were not helpful and one person suffices to do the job that all three were doing.  Disappointed, truly disappointed"

Or an investor. Or something. Is this true? I wonder how these types of arrangements even HAPPEN. Like did Kevin Costner wake up one day and say he wanted to own a chain of pretty good American cuisine restaurants nestled in upscale malls throughout the country? Seems weird. 

Anyway, in hopes that rumor is true, I&#39;m writing a Kevin Costner themed review of my recent evening at The Clubhouse. I apologize in advance.

It seemed like A PERFECT WORLD, having a Saturday night that both my husband and I were free. We had to run back to Oakbrook Mall to pick up a ring I&#39;d had repaired, so we decided to stop in to the Clubhouse for a late dinner. I assumed at 8:00PM we&#39;d get right in, but the hostess took our number and said she&#39;d text us when the table was ready. We didn&#39;t have THREE DAYS TO KILL, but luckily, 5 mins later, she called us over and we were seated. 

I ordered a glass of wine and the husband ordered a mojito. I&#39;d read a bunch of the reviews here and worried the service would be terrible, but our waiter was like a BODYGUARD - attentive, polite, and paced our experience well. We started with a crab and Brie fondue and I ordered a bowl of the lobster bisque - I guess you could say we ordered a veritable WATERWORLD of appetizers! The fondue was delicious but the bisque was unreal. Rich, decadent, flavorful, addictive. The flavor was complex and it was like DANCES WITH WOLVES on my tongue. I felt like I was in a FIELD OF DREAMS. Had I known I would like it so much, I would have just ordered soup and a salad, but alas, we pressed on to the main meal. I ordered a special - the dry aged ribeye steak sandwich. It was served open faced with mushrooms and melted cheese. It was a bit chewy but otherwise delicious, and served with a TIN CUP of fries. Husband ordered the chicken picatta which he enjoyed, though he thought the butter sauce was a little bit &#34;gloopy,&#34; he plowed through it like a MAN OF STEEL, so it certainly wasn&#39;t UNTOUCHABLE.

Though RUMOR HAS IT the desserts are great, we were way too full to even try them. The Clubhouse is a little expensive, not exactly a ROBIN HOOD type place. Two drinks, two appetizers, and two entrees was $100. 

The only thing I didn&#39;t love was that our waiter was a little condescending - when I ordered my sandwich medium rare, he explained to me that that meant a &#34;warm red center.&#34; Yes hello, I&#39;m 31 years old, I know what medium rare means. THE UPSIDE OF ANGER is that&#39;s the only time he did that (I think he saw that I was annoyed) so it wasn&#39;t a big deal - definitely not a HATFIELDS &amp; MCCOYS situation, but still.

I think we&#39;d come back to The Clubhouse, but not with frequency. The menu is a bit small and there are so many other great restaurants right there vying for your business. But if indeed Kevin Costner is a co-owner of this joint, he should be pleased with the quality and manner with which this place is run.

And if Kevin Costner ISNT a co-owner of The Clubhouse, I hope you enjoyed this non-sequitur extravaganza as much as I did."

My mom and sister had already been there before but it was a first time for the rest of us.  I was excited to try their meatloaf but they had a buffet for the holiday.  Darn.  (Sarcasm)  It was amazing.  I especially enjoyed the vodka pasta.  I didn&#39;t think anyone could do vodka pasta better then Maggiano&#39;s but this place came close.  For dessert they had this amazing, unbelievable cheesecake.  It had a layer of chocolate fudge on the bottom and carmel dripped over the top.  Since then I&#39;ve been trying to find a similar recipe on pinterest.  Everything was great, it was nice being able to try lots of things for one price.  My only suggestion would be to have smaller servings of the desserts during the buffet.  I wanted to try a little of everything but felt too guilty grabbing such large slices!  Luckily I was happy to eat off my family members&#39; plates."

Since I have a fairly large family that continues to grow we need a pretty large area to gather with multiple food options.  The Clubhouse certainly meets the needs.

On Sundays they offer a large buffet which allows the family members their choices.  Made to order omelets, pancakes, french toast seem to be big hits.  They do offer a number of lunch items and salads if you are looking for lighter items.

My parents always request a particular server and he has always been excellent.  I recommend the Sunday buffet if you have a large group with varying tastes.  I have not heard a complaint from any family member on quality taste or selection available."

Carole C. and I went for a 39.95 brunch to celebrate the holiday and new year. We were excited to try the seafood selection which ranged from oysters on the half shell, crab claws, shrimp and smoked salmon to the cooked variations of salmon. The cold seafood left way to be desired. Carole had the unfortunate experience of swallowing a rancid oyster as I was only lucky enough to taste it briefly before I spat it out. The shrimp, while large, were not cleaned and smelled weird and the claws were definitely frozen. I left a whole plate of food untouched except for that spat out oyster. Our server, Andrea, didn&#39;t seem too concerned that we were spitting out food or that we were seated at a tiny table by the windows with a lovely view of the parking lot. We would have happily moved, but the noise volume was so loud in all the other areas, we opted to take Andrea&#39;s advice and work on our tans. Yep, she actually told us that was an advantage of sitting there. After drinking weak coffee and a tolerable mimosa, we decided to enjoy the hot selections of French toast (probably best thing there), carved piece of beef with a flavorless au jus (makes me wonder if they are catering to the more affluent side of known for no-flavor Cracker Barrel) and scrambled eggs, sautéed salmon that was a bit too ripe in some sort of glaze and the sorriest eggs Benedict I&#39;ve ever tasted. Stuffed with carbs and defeated, as I just wanted to leave and was beating myself up as coming here was MY idea, we paid our $98 and left. 

But the Clubhouse was not done with me as only a few hours later, I became violently ill. Not to be TMI but things were coming out of both ends that looked so foreign, in my delirium I may have asked Carole to call Father Merrin. It was that trill. I was up all night making my bathroom my new bedroom and was repeatedly saying to myself &#39;the power of Christ compels you&#39; as I trudged back and forth. I even had to call off work as the rebuking crept into the next day and out of concern for others, called the restaurant to tell them I was sick. &#39;Get better&#39; being their response. No real concern for my well-being or offers to do anything. NOT that I&#39;d ever go back in life. Not the staff, Andrea, you reading this review, Ellen Barkin or Linda Blair could make me. 

Place was mobbed so I couldn&#39;t tell much about ambiance and the elevator that you take to get to the second floor...on the way out it smelled like the Exorcism started in there. Should have been a warning sign to get the holy water prepped for the thing most foul that was soon to appear..."

What lacks in storefront size, though, is certainly made up for in big crepes with big flavor!

The many crepe options come in a neatly folded package that can just as easily be taken on the run as enjoyed in the few seats (a couple tables and some bar seating) available. Craft sodas available in the small fridge in the corner, take your pick as your crepe is freshly made.

You can feel free to build-your-own crepe from a dazzling array of fillings, or simply choose one of the many delicious combos. In any case, the crepe comes out crisp at the edges and soft and warm as you get to the center (at the bottom as you go). The holder is cardboard that tears as you eat down the crepe, until at long last you reach the bottom epicenter of warm crepe and gooey cheese which ends your satisfying meal."

This little shop is a crepe lover&#39;s dream.  The signature crepes are creative and varied, ranging from dessert sweet to dinner savory.  The custom menu has so many ingredient options, you could make up just about anything.  This place is not to be missed for a change of pace, breakfast, lunch or dinner.

The only negative is that the shop is so small, it can really only seat about 7 people, max.  While they try to make up for this by serving most crepes in hand-held wrappings, some crepes cannot be eaten by hand and you need a plate, fork and knife.  The Crepe Suzette, for example, is served on a flat palette board, but two people each eating one at the same table would be cramped.  If it had more seating, my rating would be 5 stars.  Once the warm weather rolls around, though, and outside tables and seating are available, this is a 5 star joint."

The &#34;Paris&#34; crepe needed 3x more Brie and double the ham than was within. In the incarnation I received, I was basically eating mouthfuls of dough and my tastebuds could barely detect the super thin, sparse slices of cheese and meat nestled in the folds. It was a disappointment, especially at $8. With a lot more filling, it would have been gooey goodness. The second crepe I ordered was a holiday special that was evidently no longer on the menu (white chocolate, cherries and grand marnier) - the manager kindly offered to recreate it as best she could given she didn&#39;t have grand marnier. Her impromptu creation turned out terrific: sweet but not overly, lots of filling and creamy. I&#39;d love to see some simpler crepes on tap like a traditional Suzette and my favorite, lemon and sugar. In summation, the place needs some tweaks but it has potential and the staff is accommodating and seems adaptable to improvement."

The food is delicious. Very fresh ingredients, lots of organic options. You can order savory or sweet recommendations, or you can build your own crepe.  I have visited three times, and found the service extremely friendly. It is a small shop, with one chef at a time, so it can take a long time for them to make your crepe if there is anyone ahead of you. That is the only reason for taking away one star. If you have time to sit and relax and wait for your crepe, you should definitely check this place out. Very unique! My kids love it too and keep asking when we can go back. Also, the crepes are very filling. Before eating there, I wondered if they were worth the money. Totally! One is extremely filling.  So for $8-9, you&#39;re getting a whole meal."

She really took the time to get to know us. We are expecting a baby very soon and our dessert crepe she put on a wooden board with the baby&#39;s name on it and really decorated it nicely. It was so sweet and really unexpected. Downsides are it is a small establishment and if there are a few people in front of you, the turn around time for your crepe is a little longer.

This place is just fun and doesn&#39;t claim to be any more than it is. Unpretentious straight up divey fun. Not everyone&#39;s cup of tea but if you&#39;re looking for a dark spot to throw back some beers and hang out with the regulars, this spot is the place for you. Not glamorous or fancy, just a gold old fashioned dive bar. Kinda dingy, a little dank. This place isn&#39;t the ritz but it does make for a fun night of tipsy people watching. 

My friend and I came here for Cinco de Mayo. They had live music, cheap beer and tequila, and exceptional prices. We even wandered into the Latin dancing place a few doors down and had a great time.

The bar is full of regulars and the staff is loyal and friendly. Willing to grab or make you whatever drink you may want. They even grabbed us some cactus beads! Fiesta!"

Well, at least my 28 year old self thinks so. I&#39;ve definitely come to appreciate a good dive bar, so I was happy to have stumbled across Danny&#39;s Pub last weekend with my husband and parents.

We spent the afternoon hopping around a couple places for drinks and as the day turned into night, we were looking for someplace chill to go hangout. Our go-to dive is typically The Lantern downtown Naperville, but that place is actually pretty packed on a Saturday night. Plus, I&#39;m always in the mood to try somewhere new. Luckily, my Yelp app led me to Danny&#39;s!

The decor of this place is everything you can imagine a local pub to be. Nothing fancy, mix of tables, long bar, pool table... pretty standard. Our waitress was super nice and let us know of the domestic bucket special which was too cheap to pass up. We mixed and matched the 5 beers with Budweiser and Michelob Ultra and ended up sticking around for probably 3 buckets. My husband ended up ordering some wings which he seemed to enjoy.

We had a fun time hanging out and drinking at Danny&#39;s (without breaking the bank!). On a Saturday night it was lively, but not overly busy which was nice because we could actually sit down and hear each other talk! I will definitely be putting this pub in my bar repertoire moving forward."

First, anyone who knows me (or reads my reviews) can easily tell that I love exploring non-corporate, non-chain franchises and out-of-the-way places. While I am definitely a foodie, I am not a &#34;snobbie.&#34; And therein lies my issue with the girl tending bar I encountered during the day last week. 

I saw a sign saying &#34;Burger Heaven&#34; out front, so I wandered in, sat at the bar and got some info from the bartender about their burger deal. After I told her I was a foodie, she says &#34;Oh no - you&#39;re a snob! You&#39;re going to find a flaw with whatever we serve you.&#34; After I tell her I&#39;m not a snob, she says &#34;Oh, I think you are.&#34; And then: &#34;You can leave for all I care.&#34; Which I immediately did. 

I&#39;m guessing the bartender is not the owner - I wonder what they would think about her speaking to/pissing off new customers like that? 

Well Danny&#39;s, here&#39;s your dubious honor: I have never encountered anything like this in all my travels (here or abroad), and I&#39;m sharing this story about your place and your ridiculous bartender in the &#34;you won&#39;t believe this one&#34; category."

That was a few years back so some of the information in my review may no longer apply, but it&#39;s weird enough that I had to post.

My first trip to Danny&#39;s ended in me being thrown out. It was not for fighting. It was not for screaming or being rowdy. It was for swearing. I was kicked out of a fucking bar for swearing, in a conversational tone and volume, to a friend of mine. The bartender (which I believe is the owner&#39;s daughter) heard me and asked me not to swear, which seemed odd since we were sitting in a bar surrounded by adults, so I replied with a stunned &#34;...whathefuck?&#34; and out we went. I did wind up returning without incident, but it did not get much better.

This place is so heavy on regulars that it&#39;s almost depressing, and be prepared to wait for your drink until everyone in the first-name-basis club gets theirs. Danny&#39;s makes the classic mistake of pandering to the people that are there every day. Those people will be there every day regardless. What they need to do it attract new people, but they tend to do the opposite. Whatever.

Oh, and this is NOT, NOT, NOT a dive bar. It&#39;s nothing close to a dive bar. That&#39;s just a buzz word that gets casually attached to far too many places."

Sure, the &#34;trendy&#34; spots are fun when you&#39;re newly 21 and dressed to impress people you don&#39;t even know. But those days are long gone, and now the thought of going somewhere for a drink in jeans, a sweater, and no makeup on New Years Day is pretty exciting. 

Before our annual NYD dinner, the bf suggested we stop here for a Bloody Mary, which sounded fabulous. We made our way through the unplowed streets and inside the bar.

Once inside, we felt silly sitting at a booth since food was not on our agenda, so we took the last two open seats at the bar, opposite of the three youngsters (compared to us) slamming shots. The bartender came over to us immediately to take our older. The bf told her we&#39;d like some Bloody Mary&#39;s. She asked if we wanted regular or spicy; of course we picked spicy and she proceeded to make the drinks right in front of us. These Bloody&#39;s were garnished with three green olives, a large pickle spear, and of course a stick of celery. 

The Bloody was delicious, and the bartender certainly did a great job of making it spicy. I finished mine long before the bf was halfway through his. We probably would have stuck around for another, except for the fact that obnoxious rap music was playing (thanks to the young kids who kept feeding their money into the music player), which ruined the atmosphere. This wasn&#39;t your usual hip-hop/rap you hear on the radio and know some of the lyrics to, but gangsta rap, which leaves you wanting to kick a dog in the ass for no reason. Feeling agitated from the music, I couldn&#39;t wait to get out of there. We paid our tab and left to go grab dinner.

We&#39;ll probably go back, as this is the only bar within walking distance (something to consider for warmer months). I&#39;ve heard their food is pretty decent, so I&#39;ll probably give something a try next time. I just hope there&#39;s a nicer mix of music being played."

I really like the idea here that you can have a single serving order or the AYCE. I find myself never eating more than they give on a single serving, so to save a couple bucks never hurts. I also really enjoyed the &#34;chips&#34; instead of fries. They&#39;re roughly sliced potato chips that are chunky and unique. You can get fries too if you prefer.

They have cod in filet form. I prefer the log style, as the filet got lost in the batter and was almost too thin in spots and had no texture. The batter has a great flavor and is super puffy and crispy. Nice homemade flavor in the tarter and the coleslaw is off the hook. As Katie my wonderful waitress said... she can eat bowls of it. I concur and they give you a fair serving, but a monkey dish size is always a good thing, when it tastes this good. 

I&#39;ve been in over the years for their great lunch specials and a few years back even made it in for Tina&#39;s Karaoke Night. I don&#39;t drink, so the real lure of this spot doesn&#39;t shine. Never made it in for the live music either, so I have no real input there. As stated , my server Katie could not have been sweeter.

It&#39;s just a local bar in a strip mall (right next to the pawn shop). It was nice. And the prices were pretty reasonable. I think the highlight was the Killian&#39;s on tap.

Lets start off my stating the owner closed the kitchen at 8:00PM, even after I called to verify the kitchen being open later than this.
The bathroom was disgusting- it appeared that it has not been cleaned in weeks. My boyfriend said the mens bathroom was equally as disgusting- he even said he was afraid the urinal was going to fall off the wall
There was also an odor of some type of plumbing leak.

The best part is its one of those places where you go if you know everyone. Its like living in the show cheers. I ended up going because someone from work frequents the bar.

Made me think twice until i realized that was a joke to all of the people who had never been in... like me. There is always a drink special so I dont have to worry about breaking the bank on feeling good. 

A bonus perk... Free pool on the one table during the weekends. Also, karaoke with a cast of randoms on Thursday! I&#39;ll have to take a stroll back in there."

The UGLY (and there&#39;s a lot of it.): So I came in the place to try to pick up some food since I&#39;ve been to all the other places in the mini strip mall (I work down the street, and wanted to grab something new). I go into the dim lit place and sat at a table rather than sitting at the bar. The place has about 3-4 people in the place but it&#39;s pretty much dead for the size. I sit and wait....and wait....and wait for a menu. Finally, I get up and ask for 1 from the lady at the bar. She looks at me as if she were sizing me up for a fight. Really who does that? In the words of Chris Rock, &#34;I would never hit a woman...but I would shake the *$%?! out of her!&#34; Then she responds in a snobby tone, &#34;Yeah sure.&#34; With my right hand cocked back ready for an actual fight with this lady, I took the menu with my left. I was hesitant to ask for a drink since I already had this bad of service already, but I asked for a Miller Lite since it was on tap. She actually was quick with that. The beer for some reason tasted real flat and bitter. I mean Miller Lite isn&#39;t the greatest tasting beer, but I knew it shouldn&#39;t taste like that. For me that was it. You screwed up the service and now you screwed up the beer. I was already afraid to think of what the food would taste like. I left the rest of my beer at the bar and stormed out of the place. I went next door to Subway and grabbed a footlong and a cookie I believed I deserved for putting up with all that crap."

Although they were very friendly and the customer service was great, the food wasn&#39;t. They allow you to order items not on the menu from the past owners which was a huge plus, it just wasn&#39;t the same. They&#39;ve admitted they they have changed cooks, that is 100% the reason why the food is how it is. They used to provide with a basket of bread, they no longer do that. I ordered the flank steak and was probably the worst skirt steak I have I tried. And I love skirt steak.  It was not properly seasoned, lack of salt as well as their hash browns. Literally had no flavor. I will probably not be returning here"

I ordered the sweet potato hash skillet and was served a dish with roasted large chunks of under cooked sweet potatoes, onions, carrots, and roughly chopped red peppers. 

The roasted sweet potatoes were so under cooked I couldn&#39;t put the fork through them. (Note: the menu said the skillet comes with sweet potato hash - I was expecting smaller diced sweet potato that had been pan fried...)

When we told the waitress that the sweet potatoes were under cooked she was very nice and apologized but also mentioned &#34;yeah, they tend to under cooked the sweet potato - that&#39;s just how they make it&#34;.

The service was s-l-o-w. But, very polite and nice. Our waitress was great, whenever we eventually saw her. 

I think we will give this place another shot - but definitely steer clear of the sweet potato hash skillet... because it&#39;s actually a roasted root vegetable skillet."

The shopping centered is anchored by a wonderful family grocery store aptly named Family Foods.  The store and it&#39;s donuts is another review.  Next door to the store is a cafe named Sweet Potato Cafe.  Living up to it&#39;s name the cafe does offer almost everything sweet potatoes.  However, the key word in the last sentence is not sweet or potato, but the word everything, because everything we tried was wonderful.  

SPC offers vegetable and vegan offerings as well as meat.  It seems for a moment that the restaurant is trying to be all things to all patrons, and how often does that work? Well...let&#39;s find out, shall we?

I ordered an Aloha Burger which encouraged our waitress to do a little dance.  The burger is a half pound of angus with provolone, thick ham, onions, pineapple and barbeque sauce for 10 bucks.  This burger would stand up against Chicago&#39;s finest.  

Homemade dessert sounded intriguing, but we were about to be disappointed when there was no more death by chocolate cheesecake.  Would it be wrong to say the Bread Pudding was to die for? But it was...best I&#39;ve had outside New Orleans.  Some chefs, cooks and bakers know how to use basic elements and proper techniques instead of artificial flavoring to enhance taste.  It seems Cindy has the recipe and know how to deliver a genuine bread pudding.  

SPC has an extensive menu.  They are a breakfast and lunch place that now does dinner.  Beef stroganoff...how good can it be?  Let&#39;s find out, shall we?"

I ordered a side of corned beef hash (literally, nuked, not fried at all), a skillet (that I ordered no onions or jalepenos, and it had jalepenos, which I had to pick out, also no hot sauce was added on the side as requested), a co-worker ordered a sandwich without tapers (it came with tapers), we also ordered soup with extra cheese on it (and it had zero cheese) and we asked for lots of ketchup and got about 4-5 packets.

First, we were confused by the name... I was hoping that there would be more items with sweet potatoes... Hashbrowns, pancakes, crepes, something! Nope... Nada... So, what&#39;s the deal?!

We both felt like having the Country Fried Steak... I can&#39;t say that we were much impressed by it though. The breading was bland and the steak seemed more like a frozen patty. The eggs were really greasy. And I love my sausage gravy; I rate all breakfast places on how well they make their gravy... This was a lackluster gravy. It lacked seasoning and was strangely thick.

Our server wasn&#39;t very attentive. It was a little like going to a buffet. She stopped by twice. Once to give us drinks and take our order... Then once more to leave us the check. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place."

It&#39;s 8:30, I&#39;ve driven up and down 59 with a burger on my mind all I see is fast food and I know what it&#39;s gunna be like.....nothing to write home about. About to give up and settle for Burger King, I see the open sign at Sweet Potato Cafe. Siri tells me they close at 9 and I&#39;ve worked food service and hated to be that guy that&#39;s the reason the kitchen that&#39;s in the process of being cleaned has to get greasy again. So I asked if I have time for an order and they said of course. I&#39;m handed the menu and immediately look at the burgers. I go for the build your own with pretzel bun, Swiss cheese, mushrooms and bacon. I&#39;m offered beer battered fries which I&#39;ve never had anywhere so of course I&#39;m gunna try them, and then I&#39;m offered some soups, I decide for the sweet potato chipotle. Man oh man am I glad I decided to come in! The soup, perfect balance of sweet potato flavor with a subtle kick of heat that was just surprisingly delightful. Soon after I finish this the burger and fries come out. The burger is nearly overflowing with the mushrooms and bacon. I dressed it up with a lil mustard and ketchup, the provided pickles, tomatoes and lettuce and was ready to dig in. First bite? Tasted like I grilled it on my own grill in my back yard! Juicy and delicious! Man did that hit the spot! The fries were excellent too! At that point, my journey for a satisfying burger was over. Every bite was delicious. I almost ordered another one to go. Yes, it was that good. So my star rating just got boosted to 5. The service is great, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s jam packed in the morning or if your the last guy keeping them open, they are friendly and ready to make sure you enjoy your experience and your food. No matter what time of day, they have something on that menu that will satisfy and that is truly rare to be able to excel at at their level on any food service at any time of the day. I feel truly blessed to live just down the street! Keep up the great work guys! You&#39;re putting out some fantastic eats!



Prior review which kicked it up to 4 stars...I forget the date.

Came back in for the Cinnamon Swirl Pancakes. OMG, it is literally the best pancake I have ever eaten. Their pancakes are light, fluffy and flavorful to begin with but then somehowe they make a spiral in the pancakes and fill the seam with a delicious cinnamon and sugar concoction that when paired with the icing on top tastes amazingly like a pancake that would be produced in a Cinabon, except, they don&#39;t make them, SWEET POTATO CAFE however DOES!!!!

These were delicious. Hands down. The other special items they had on the board were very tempting! Portabello and Fried Green Tomato Benedicts, those were hard to pass on today, but I will certainly be back for more!

Keep up the great work!"

We arrived to find a full dining room (always a good sign). The hostess greeted us and we were immediately seated in a booth.

Sandy was our server and she was very pleasant. I ordered the Acapulco Skillet, which comes with scrambled eggs (I chose egg whites), Chorizo, onion, and jalapenos, topped with monterey jack cheese. M tried the Lumberjack Skillet, which has hash browns, corned beef hash,and a  melted blend of cheese. I opted for wheat toast and M chose white. We also shared a side of bacon.

Our food arrived sooner than I had expected. We dug in, and I was impressed. The chorizo was perfect; not overly greasy but not bone-dry. The hash browns were good, but we both agreed they could have been cooked a minute or so longer. M enjoyed his skillet; he didn&#39;t leave a scrap of food behind. I was surprised, as he usually doesn&#39;t order skillets and he was a bit apprehensive about ordering one at first.

What I noticed about SPC is how hardworking the employees are. Not one person stood around. Even the hostess would tuck in chairs at nearby tables if she wasn&#39;t tending to customers. I saw the owner walking around, putting down fresh coffee cups and wiping down tables. He didn&#39;t stand still once. I was impressed. 

Sweet Potato Cafe was a great find. M&#39;s only gripe is that they don&#39;t have alcohol so he couldn&#39;t get a Bloody Mary, but that isn&#39;t really a deal breaker. I did notice that while Sandy was great and kept coming by to refill our coffees, she didn&#39;t offer to refill our  near empty water carafe. Aside from that, I enjoyed the food at SPC and look forward to future visits."

The soup was hit and creamy with a decent amount of chicken which most cream of chicken soups seem to lack so that was a win. For my meal I got a cheese omelette that was large, but was lacking in abundance in cheese and moisture. Also when we went there was only one waitress which I&#39;m guessing isn&#39;t normal so I&#39;ll ignore the wait times as just a fluke. I think I&#39;ll give this place another try sometime.

The menu has a lot of traditional breakfast items to choose from and the food is generally good. Nothing is spectacular, but then, nothing is inedible. Service is alright, but nothing spectacular either. First, servers decide when you&#39;ve had enough coffee and it&#39;s time to leave. Not that anyone is waiting for your table...it&#39;s just time to get out of your seat. Dining with 2 friends I don&#39;t see often, it&#39;s nice to have a leisurely breakfast, except no one appraised our server. We didn&#39;t have fresh coffee for quite a while when realizing they want us to leave after an hour and 1/2 - so 10:30. Eggs are good and they know how to make a poached or basted or sunny side up egg. I didn&#39;t have any, but my friends pancakes looked good and he enjoyed them, as well as the steak and eggs. Two of us ordered toast, both of which were cold. Not the end of the world, but it&#39;s nice to have toasty toast instead of cold toast. Oh well. I could have done without the hash browns. They weren&#39;t awful, but they were salty, in fact, they were very, very salty. My friend who loves salt didn&#39;t say anything about the potatoes but did comment about the cold toast. All in all, the food here is 3 stars decent, maybe 3 1/2 to be exact. There&#39;s a lot of things on the menu, and maybe pancakes are a better option than toast!"

Nothing much seems to have changed on the inside though. Came here with some friends on their recomendation. I had the Acapulco (&#34;Mexican&#34;) skillet and my wife had her usual Belgium  Waffle.

Our server was a friendly enough young woman but when our food arrived the first thing I noticed was a large chip in my plate. Not just a little chip but a large clam shell chip on the side.  It didn&#39;t look like it was done recently, just an old plate but I thought that it shows quite a bit of disrespect to serve your customers food on a plate in this condition.  This dish should have been trashed. The restaurant was not well filled so I am sure they could not have given out all the good china already!  I did not want to make a scene in front of our friends who recommended the restaurant so I bit my tongue and proceeded to eat my meal without comment. Bad enough that this chip was mocking me as I was eating the skillet also did not fit squarely on the plate causing it to spin around like the tea cup ride at Six Flags. I must have looked quite comical tackling this breakfast. The food itself was unremarkable and looked like it was plated in a rush. The potatoes in the skillet were overcooked and gluey. Held together in a big old lump. My wife thought that her waffle was dry and not up to her expectations.

The coffee service stopped abruptly after our plates were removed. Although the restaurant was by no means full it seems we were no longer welcome to sit there and talk a bit. All in all I hope our friends do not ask us to come back but we have a good &#34;breakfast club&#34;  that likes to go out and try different restaurants."

The menu was expansive which initially concerned me, because usually that means horribly mediocre food, but that wasn&#39;t the case here. We each ordered different dishes and we were all very pleased with them. I also appreciated the availability of turkey/chicken breakfast meats.

I had never been to Warrenville Pancake House so I have no comparisons there. I went here for lunch using the Yelp $20 for $10 since I had never been here. I can&#39;t say it is even worth it when you have that.

My mother and her fiance invited me for lunch since they were nearby. When we went in it seemed... normal strip mall reatraunty? Sorry, I don&#39;t know that I have a better word to explain. I order a patty melt as I haven&#39;t had one in a while and was craving it. When I got it, I noticed right off the onions were raw onions, not fried like every other patty melt I have ever had. I get that a patty melt isn&#39;t a special advanced item, but to just take 2 pieces of bread, a peice of generic american cheese (It didn&#39;t even taste as good as Kraft) and throw some raw onions on it is lazy and laughable. I could a MUCH better one from Hardee&#39;s and spend far less money. Oh and the fries were standard bulk fries, no seasoning.

My mother ordered the meatfloaf which I can&#39;t really speak for, but she ate maybe 1/4 of it and stopped eatting. She said she would never order it again. My mother&#39;s fiance ordered crepes, he also didn&#39;t eat much of it and said it was very bland. Oh and they didn&#39;t even provide any syrup for the creepes, lazy waitress or poorly trained staff? I don&#39;t know, but she should have at least asked if he wanted any.

Sorry, I won&#39;t be returning, 0 out of 3 is not a good record for dishes served. No one in my party was ever slightly impressed."

The main problem is not getting what you ordered especially in carry out.  They offer to replace it but it usually is still wrong.

My family ordered cashew Chicken, mongolian beef, chicken fried rice, eggrolls, and crab rangoon.

The cashew Chicken and the beef were ok. I&#39;ve had others with more flavor. The friend rice has decent flavor, but could have used a splash of vegetables, as it was just rice and chicken, essentially. The egg rolls weren&#39;t very good. Just cabbage and white filling. No vegetables or mini shrimp.  Lastly, the rangoon weren&#39;t bad, they were crispy on the edges and soggy in the middle. Each of them had a lot of stuffing inside, so that was a plus.

The young woman who took our order was exceptionally nice. She engaged me and my girlfriend about the Univ. of Il, where all three of us attended (at different times). She still took our order and I appreciated her ability to multitask. We waited no more than 10-15 minutes for our food. I watched through the kitchen door as the cook prepared everything fresh (relatively. I think the chicken was pre-breaded). I was very pleased with their efficiency and was looking forward to getting home and trying them out. 

We ordered sweet and sour chicken, Szechuan chicken and a large shrimp fried rice (no eggs). It smelled amazing and was still pretty warm after a 5 minute drive home. It still looked appetizing after being unboxed. Alas, everything was mediocre at best, with the fried chicken being greasy and a little salty. The rice was pedestrian, not bad but not great. The Szechuan chicken was the best. It lacked chicken but they heaped on the veggies. 

HERE IS THE MAJOR ISSUE: within an hour of eating, my pregnant girlfriend suffered from loose bowels. I mean, it came like the running of the Bulls. I thought maybe it was something she had eaten earlier in the day, until I was awakened at 5am but the bubble guts. I sat on the thrown for a good 20 minutes, emptying my belly of Sun Wong. I don&#39;t know what they did, or what we have a digestive aversion to, but it did not go over well. My thought is the excessive grease...

prior to the main meal we had their nachos  and they were EXCELLENT...
add a great server and coffee  and this place hit the spot..

I was surprised to see also this place has a small slot  machine room to top it all of we went to put a 100 bucks in and try our luck  in was 6 spins later we got the bonus on the saberian tiger machine,, and picked up an extra 21 bucks,, so we cashed out and left ahead..

Meal was 60 including tip-  less 20 for the slot winnings..  Compared to a failed basils meal prior  we probably saved over 100 bucks  and found a new home to dine at before we honnor the sabbath of Yah..  check this place out

Irish skillet, pancakes and eggs Benny were good, nothing too special but just a standard good.
The French toast was not that great, what&#39;s funny is that I had made French toast a day before we left and mine tasted a lot better (I had someone 2nd that). 
The waitress didn&#39;t really seem to care about us too much, she wasn&#39;t rude but she wasn&#39;t friendly either.  Just kind of gave us our stuff and left, never smiled at us or anything.

The French Onion soup is the best I have ever had. This is really saying something because I have had it hundreds perhaps even a thousand times over the years. Surprisingly the cheese is not the star here. There is gobs of it and it is broiled to perfection, but I think a lesser quality than Gouda or Gruyere such as Swiss or provolone is mixed in and I&#39;m not sure Gouda or Gruyere are even present. Whatever is used the cheese works and the soup is still the best. For me the broth is the star in that it&#39;s not too rich or salty and features a ton of caramelized onions.    

Another standout is the mac and cheese and it is one of the best I have ever had. The menu claims it is only available on Friday, but our waitress said they could probably do it any day of the week. The quiche is available every day and while not the best ever very good and recommended.  A good selection of sides is available to complement the quiche or a sandwich such as fries, cole slaw, a cup of soup (which can be upgraded to a cup or even a bowl of the F.O.) or fruit. 

I&#39;m not wild about the atmosphere. It&#39;s family style laid out like a Denny&#39;s or some such similar restaurant. Ok it is nicer than Denny&#39;s (God I&#39;m SO embarrassed to admit I ever stepped foot in one), but that is still not saying much.

Medium sized parking lot and we had no problem finding a spot at all.

INTERIOR/ EXTERIOR
Display glass of cakes available right in front and the bar to the right of walking in! There are tables outside if you choose to sit out on a nice day. There are many tables inside and it looked busy upon our arrival for brunch. 

MENU
We were famished by the time we got to the restaurant. The party of three ordered a three piece Strawberry Crepe, Hawaiian Omelette, and the order of two eggs that came with a small fruit bowl and pancakes. The omelette was easily my favorite with bacon and pineapples inside. Everything else was delicious as well, though I did not like how the strawberries on top of the crepes were warm. However, I really liked the whip cream that came on the side!

SERVICE

The baked goods is the reason for my 2 star review they were store brought I saw because the tags were ripped off the container.  Not impressed. They do offer gluten free options and have a lot of  other choices for breakfast and lunch.

I live nearby, so my husband and I came here for breakfast one morning to &#34;celebrate&#34; national pancake day. I think it&#39;s safe to say I&#39;m always looking for a reason to celebrate!

With that being said, I ordered the 3 chocolate chip pancakes ($6.75), a side order of sausage links, and coffee. The pancakes were beautiful and it was a huge order. You have the option to get 5, but I&#39;d say the smaller order of 3 is more than enough. I took about half of that home. The chocolate chips were plentiful, but to me the cakes were just too dry. I ended up having to dowse them in syrup which was extra sugar I did not need to ingest.

Coffee was good and refilled I believe once. The sausage links were not my favorite. I can&#39;t quite pin point it but they almost tasted like chicken sausage.

Our waitress was really sweet, but it took her forever to come around for our order and then another long while for us to get our food. The kicker was that they weren&#39;t busy at all. I was just a little disappointed all around with our experience since I read such fabulous reviews.

Pomegranate offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so I&#39;ll have to stop by to give their extensive menu another try since I live right in the neighborhood."

We had to wait about 20 mins to be sat which is honestly fine with me I don&#39;t mind waiting on a Saturday morning, it&#39;s to be expected. However once we got sat, it was obvious the table was still very dirty. That&#39;s  unfortunate... I didn&#39;t come to bus my own table. There was a bunch of empty creamers, and empty sugar packets, and left over half empty table syrup and the tip still on the table and the table clearly hadn&#39;t been wiped down. But weirdly bout there were full ice waters on the table... At this point we could only assume it was left from the table before us and not actually new waters lol needless to say, we didn&#39;t take our chances with the gamble waters..
   Our waitress comes, grabs the trash we have collected for her at the end of our table and grabs her tip and asks for our drink orders, like a solid 5 mins later I get mine but my boyfriend didn&#39;t get his, she passes us about 8 times when we realize she clearly forgot there&#39;s a second person at this table that ordered a drink. So when she finally came to take our order he tries again to get his drink, she says sure and apologized. But still nothing lol our food comes out now,  30 mins later and he&#39;s like yea, can I get that milk yet? And she said sorry and ran back to get it. 
   Now to the food, I ordered the biscuit and gravy skillet with over medium eggs and he got the crows eggs Benedict (made with corned beef hash) and we got a side &#34;cup&#34; of fruit and a side of bacon. ( more like a tiny little 1/4 of a cup of fruit or 3 bucks! And bacon side, a whopping 4.25, for 3 slices of bacon, come on) mine was just &#34;okay&#34; I didn&#39;t eat the potato part, they were realllly cold, the only thing hot on my plate was just barely the gravy, everything was like room temperature though, and my eggs were definitely over easy not over medium which sucked. His, one of his poached eggs was already broken and it was all pretty sloppy, it takes 3 minutes to poach an egg, do it right, and sure as hell don&#39;t leave a broken one on a plate, I would if refired that in my kitchen, no question asked. All in all id say it was a pretty disappointing visit, could of been an &#34;off day&#34; but how many people really buy that excuse? Do it right or do it again. I know this isn&#39;t the city and maybe I have city standards, but I&#39;m just holding them up to their last performance when I visited, they were fantastic before, they should be even better now. Your only as good as your last plate. I doubt I&#39;ll be returning, there&#39;s other options for us to explore"

Great food, great place, great service, and customer-oriented owners. 

Based on Yelp reviews, we gave this place a try for breakfast on a Sat morning.  At first glance, this place is nicely set in a strip next to the road, and has a very nice home fell upon entry. We were promptly seated, but we definitely should have taken more time with the menu before ordering. While our breakfast was good, we didn&#39;t know about their specialties listed on a separate small blue menu on the table.  During our breakfast the owner dropped by to ensure everything was to our liking. Very nice experience. 

We were only in town for a day, my local family wanted to go out for dinner, and my wife and I wanted to see what else this place had to offer. Again, promptly seated, and our server, Donna, was just like a member of the family. She took care of us through the meal, nudging us to some really great food. My wife had the Reuben, I had the gyro, and my son had the Oreo pancakes. My gyro was good, my wife said the Reuben was great, but my son&#39;s pancakes were over the top!  Seriously, take a look at look at the picture.  Another family member had the turkey dinner, and again, awesome. Apparently, At the same time we ordered another large group ordered, causing a slight delay. Donna and the owner ensured we each received complimentary dessert, without us saying a word.  Seriously, the wait wasn&#39;t too bad, but everyone there seemed personally involved with ensuring we had a great experience.  If you&#39;ve read this far, good for you; however stop reading and give this place a try. I hope you have just as great of an experience."

The marscapone French toast is amazing and consists of 5 &#34;sandwiches&#34; of marscapone and blueberries between French toast slices.

I had a large, delicious, perfectly cooked omelet for breakfast. The ham and cheese were the perfect ratio to the light and fluffy eggs, the sides were nicely sized, and I had to leave some on my plate because I was so full. I am not a small man and leaving food on my plate for any meal is very, very rare.

For lunch I enjoyed the fried fish sandwich with some clam chowder. I&#39;m always looking for delicious fried fish and this was a really good sandwich. The bun was toasted perfectly, the fish cooked really nicely, and the tartar sauce was exactly what tartar sauce should be. (You&#39;d be surprised how many places try to be fancy with their tartar sauce and screw it up.)

Service was great too and I&#39;ll definitely be going back. I chatted with the owner for just a bit before I left the second time and told him how much I enjoyed the food and the restaurant itself. He was friendly, funny, and generally genial.

I will definitely be coming back to Pomegranate Restaurant and bringing friends. I definitely look forward to trying dinner some time!"

It was a large restaurant and they have an extensive menu. I ordered &#34;The French Orchard,&#34; 3 pieces of cinnamon spiral bread dipped in french toast batter with toppings. My wife ordered the California Omelette. The French Orchard was a lot smaller than I expected and was pretty plain. I was expecting a lot more flavor, sweetness, or something to excite me and it was pretty boring. I ended up eating quite a bit of my wife&#39;s omelette. My wife was underwhelmed by the omelette as well but I thought it tasted pretty good. 

The service was fine and food came out quick. There seemed to be a few regulars there that loved the place and were interacting with the staff. 

I was very torn on a 2 or 3 star review for this restaurant. We won&#39;t return because there are numerous other breakfast places around that taste a lot better and I am surprised to see the great reviews on this place. It wasn&#39;t awful but there are better options out there."

But there is one drawback that is really unfair and not right. My friend wanted a side order of scrambled eggs with her almond French toast. But there is no such thing as a side order of scrambled eggs. You have to buy the eggs breakfast which includes 2 eggs, hash browns and 2 pancakes. Which is a lot of food. But she ended up taking most of it home. 
Cheating your patrons to buy more is not the way to keep them coming back. I hope they change this. 
My portobello omelette was delicious. It&#39;s a lot of food. It comes with hash browns and 2 pancakes!! A lot of food for the price."

I can&#39;t believe that it took me this long to stumble upon it, however I&#39;m making up for it now. I&#39;ve been here 5 times in the past 2 weeks.

Their many variations of Eggs Benedict are eggseptional (sorry, I couldn&#39;t help myself), and they make all kinds of pancakes, crepes and waffles.  I asked if they offered Dutch Baby oven baked pancakes and, like almost every restaurant, they do not.  A few minutes later our server brought us one saying their cook wanted us to try one that he made for us anyway.  It was wonderful.   They really do go all out to please their customers.

If I had to come up with one complaint it would be that their portions are so large.  Try as hard as I can, I cannot finish the whole meal; I&#39;m forced to take some home for snacking later.  Yay!  

I&#39;m looking forward to dropping in for dinner soon (they are open Thursday,  Friday and Saturday for dinner) to try their prime rib.  One of their servers told us their prime rib is the best in the area and I have come to totally trust my new friends at Pomegranate."

I went with sweet and got the French Connection without walnuts. The French toast was perfectly cooked with a nice crust on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside. The apples were fresh and tasty and the caramel sauce was perfect -- no need for syrup on this dish!

My husband and our guest went with savory dishes: a chorizo omelette which was HUGE and the Mexican skillet (equally gigantic). Oh my goodness, I tried both and they were incredibly tasty!  I think my favorite dish of the meal was the Mexican skillet. The eggs over easy were perfectly cooked and mixed in so well with the rest of the dish to make it creamy. Also, the hash browns that came with the omelette were warm with a delightfully crispy outside. 

As for the service, it was incredibly quick, but almost too quick as if we were being rushed out. It wasn&#39;t busy, so I don&#39;t know why they would want to turn the tables so fast. Our water glasses were always full so I can say they were attentive.

(1) Outdoor Seating - Again, this place is a hidden gem behind the mall.  This means no heavy traffic to listen to while eating on the patio.  It is very serene and quiet, peaceful, which makes the outdoor experience all the better. 

(2) Fresh ingredients/Great Pancakes.  I know this may sound weird, but my omelet tasted like it was made with fresh eggs.  You can tell whether its fresh or from a carton. Also, not every breakfast place can make pancakes, but this place can! 

(3) Lastly, amazing coffee.  Usually breakfast places have average coffee.  This place has specialty latte&#39;s etc.  I order a Vanilla Latte and it had the right amount of Vanilla/Coffee balance, which means the coffee was not extremely strong. 

I will be back to this place very soon! Enjoy =))"

The food itself was decent. I had a Santa Fe omelet which was large, but wasn&#39;t nearly as flavorful as I would have liked and the salsa looked to be from a jar. On the plus side they brought the toast un-buttered which was a nice touch. All in all typical Midwestern cafe lots of food for a fair price."

It&#39;s a hidden gem, to say the least. As busy as this place was, we only encountered a 15 minute wait at 12:30 p.m. Parking can be a nightmare, though.

Our waitress came to take our drink order; we of course chose the Bloody Mary&#39;s. The garnishes weren&#39;t anything impressive; just a stalk of celery, a lime wedge, and two green olives on a spear. But the drink itself was fabulous.

We placed our orders; I stuck with my ol&#39; standby, but the fiance actually tried something new. I ordered the Tijuana Skillet, which had Chorizo sausage, jalapeno peppers, onions, salsa, cheddar cheese, and sour cream. I went with my usual eggs over easy and wheat toast.

M ordered the Mexican Fiesta Omelette, which is oven baked and had Chorizo Sausage, black olives, green onions, jalapenos, tomatoes, and jalapeno Jack cheese. He chose an english muffin in place of toast and opted for no tomatoes as he hates them.

Our food arrived in a timely manner. There&#39;s only one word to describe it: foodgasmic. I&#39;ve had tons of Mexican style skillets, but the one at Pomegranate is by far the best. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted to fresh. M was equally impressed with his huge omelette.

We were going to call it quits as we finished our meal, but our sneaky waitress managed to have us order another round of Bloody&#39;s before departing. Damn, she&#39;s good and she received a generous tip from us.

I&#39;ll definitely be returning in the future, as their vast menu has some rather tempting items, including a Bacon Waffle, Chocolate Chip pancakes, and Biscuits and Gravy.
Their lunch choices look good, too."

Although there were only people at three other tables in the entire restaurant, it took 40 minutes for my boyfriend and I to get our breakfast once we ordered. I&#39;m sorry, but anything over 20 minutes for an omelette and two eggs over-easy in an empty restaurant is unacceptable. Our waitress seemed much more interested in her other table while barely paying us any attention and stating that our food would be &#34;out in just a minute&#34; when in reality it was fifteen minutes later. Won&#39;t be going back soon."

The omelettes are huge, and come with a selection of other side items such as toast or pancakes. Every time I order an omelette I am extremely pleased with how it comes out of the kitchen. 

On one of my more recent visits, however, I decided to try something else. The eggs I got with it came out of the kitchen only lukewarm, which was a major disappointment as that was nearly half of the breakfast. I think this was probably a fluke, and due partially to a slightly inattentive server. 

That being said, because all of my other experiences here have been positive I would most certainly recommend as a breakfast location!"

I order the crepe sampler with eggs and bacon.  The single crepe was horrible, almost like it was deep fried in old grease from a carnival food truck.  It not only tasted horrible but looked bad too.  The bacon was weird, like it was fake. My friend also ordered a sampler but with pancakes, he said his scrambled eggs were pretty bad.  
The staff was friendly and they had a clean facility.

Overall, I will not be going back there. Not worth it at all."

Get the eggs benedict.  

And coffee.

And try not to order all of the the stuffed french toast, decadent pancakes, and ginormous omelets while you are scoping out the menu.

The service was excellent. The waitstaff were very attentive to me and especially my younger daughters. Their raspberry ice tea was a very memorable experience for my daughter (she had 3 of &#39;em!). In short, we did not have a bad dining experience.

Where this restaurant missed the mark were the attention to details that affect the customer experience. Before a container of pancake syrup with a meal, someone needs to ensure that the handle does not have syrup residue on it, leaving it for the customer (me) to discover for themselves. My denver omelette  was overcooked. Eggs are pretty difficult to mess up, but there should not be significant &#34;browning&#34; on an omelet. The last detail that stood out was the absence of kiddie cups with no-spill lids. My girls were provided standard 12oz insulated coffee cups for their apple juice and iced tea (too for a &#34;kid&#39;s size&#34; in my opinion&#34;). This was the first sit-down breakfast restaurant I&#39;ve eaten at which did not provide kiddie cups. Not a big deal for the childless, but significant for families with toddler and kids who are prone to accidentally knocking things over while dining.

...and thus my response &#34;meh&#34;"

My wife and I went in, impromptu, after reading the reviews here and being in the area. We walked n and were seated promptly by (who turned out to be) the owner. After sitting a few minutes and perusing the Greek inspired menu, the owner came over to ask if we had been helped yet. With a no response, I continued with a question... &#34;What&#39;s do you recommend?&#34; His eyes lit up as he asked if this was our first time. I responded yes, and his excitement to talk of the menu grew. This passion from the people running a restaurant is what makes one great. I asked about one of my Greek favorites, the souvlaki. He literally guaranteed it was the best I&#39;d ever had. Literally. He continued about the Greek chicken, one of my wife&#39;s favorites, and ended the conversation by offering to buy us cocktails, since it was our first time and all. WHAT?!?! Really? So we settled on the Greek chicken and the Souvlaki, and Saganaki to start us off. The saganaki was very good, large portion, and a uniquely creamy center. We loved it. The pork was tender and flavorful as was the pilaf. Too often, the pilaf is rice. I mean just rice. A filler of sorts. This was tender and flavorful, played nicely with the souvlaki. My wife&#39;s chicken was equally as amazing. Really really delicious, with no additional trimming needed. My wife is a trimmer, and believe me when I say that if you trimmed anything off this chicken it would just have been meat. White, tender, succulent meat. Although the portions were large, my wife and I let no challenge go unanswered. We forced every bit delicious bite down. Fully satisfied, we talked over the meal as the waitress approached. &#34;What would you like for dessert? It&#39;s on the owner, he insisted&#34;  Oh boy, another challenge? I thought. Well with the delicious selections of death by chocolate, strawberry cheesecake, carrot cake, etc... we couldn&#39;t resist, and didn&#39;t. We both had the cheesecake, said our thanks, and rolled out of there. I wish I knew the name of the owners (his wife was there too) as well as the waitress. Everyone who we had any dealings with us treated us as though we had trekked the scape for thousands of miles and landed on their doorstep tired, hungry, cold, and penniless. VERY gracious people. Thanks again to them, and we&#39;ll be back!!!"

My husband and I pretty much visit once a week.  Chris, the owner, always greets us with a smile, handshake and asks how we are.  He gets to know his patrons and is always visiting and making sure everything is good, when he&#39;s not running the register.  Very nice man and his wife is very nice, too!  We came in today to celebrate my mom&#39;s birthday and Chris came by to sing a little, tell a few jokes and made sure my mom received a HUGE piece of cake with a candle on it, for all of us to share.  So hospitable!

The restaurant is always clean and the service and food is consistently great.  We come here consistently and when we do, I see other regulars.  This is a &#34;come back to&#34; place.

I&#39;m the type of person that orders the same most of the time, so I can tell you a couple of things.  The ranch dressing is phenomenal!  I&#39;d put that stuff on just about anything.  I ordered the pecan/banana waffle, today and joked with the server that I&#39;d have ranch on the side.  Now, that&#39;s just gross.. and I was kidding, but that stuff is so good!

Their baked french onion soup is delicious, as well. I get a cup almost every time I&#39;m here.  The seasonings are a little bit different, which makes it so much more yummy than other restaurants.  I&#39;ve become an expert in peeling off the baked on cheese all around the cup! mmm mm mmmm mm!

I&#39;ve had their Prime Rib.. great, salads.. fresh and full, burgers.. good, sandwiches.. tasty, breakfasts.. awesome.  Nothing like one of their hot chocolates on a cold winter day.

BUT WAIT!! THERE&#39;S MORE!!  I&#39;m not even sure if it&#39;s a good idea to tell you..  ummm... debating.. debating.. debating....      ok..  They just put in 5 slot machines in a new addition about 2 weeks ago!  My mom and I had to check this out after lunch.  What a fun time!  I could have come home more of a winner, but I am a gambahol dummy.  I played on $40 for nearly 2 hours and left a little more than doubling my money.  Chris was so nice to have made us a couple of Pomegranate Mimosas, on the house, while we played.  I have never had one of their alcoholic beverages here, but wow.. it was so good!! Fruity and refreshing.  I want another one, right now! :)

Support this great, local business.. great people, great food... and now, fun slots!"

The wait for our food was pretty long especially for a weekday.  The service was below average and  the food was probably the worst brunch food I have had in this area.  I usually order the same dish no matter where I go (Mediterranean omelette with hash browns and specialty pancakes).  The omelette was pretty sad - way too much feta cheese.  The hash browns were not tasty at all.  The nutella &#34;crepe&#34; was a joke.  We were really looking forward to this place based off of the reviews but will not be back.  There are many better brunch places to go to.

That is indicative of the extreme service at Pomegranate.  The owner/manager stopping to check on satisfaction, frequent coffee refills,,it&#39;s all there.

And the extensive choices make ordering a difficult process.  This is the also the first time I&#39;ve ever ordered breakfast without oatmeal, even though they had THREE choices (including baked with fruit, which was fire-roasted).  I just could not resist the cinnamon swirl French toast with caramelized apples, raisins and pecans. I did order egg whites, scrambled, hoping to head off a sugar buzz and crash, but I&#39;m not optimistic about that.  

He had the ultimate restaurant challenge...chicken fried steak with eggs, pancakes, and hash browns.  He gave me a half pancake (to counteract my really sweet toast) and still left full and happy. 

And, as other reviewers mentioned, there is a patio for al fresco dining.  Wish we lived closer."

I wanted a mixed drink, so I studied the libations menu and chose one. They didn&#39;t have the makings. So I selected another. Same thing!  The third time out, our server helped me choose the pomegranate margarita. I suggested a price break, and they only took $1.50 off..."

The place has a traditional set of food to choose from for a breakfast/lunch place. I wish there were more Pomegranate options and I&#39;ll be sure to come back to see if there are!

Everyone was satisfied with their meal. We got the pomegranate waffle, stuffed French toast (SO MASSIVE), and gluten free option. My gluten intolerant friend was so  happy to try some gluten free options and the waitress was super accommodating again.

Owner makes it a point of checking in on his customers and I love they leave you with your own coffee pot. Their dinner options are something I need to explore.

My server was super sweet and Christy even stopped by and filled my cup of coffee. If your having a birthday, they have a waitress with an incredible voice and very cheerful. She almost got a standing ovation."

We&#39;re here at least twice a month.  I just realized that I never reviewed this place before.  And, it&#39;s really a staple in my lazy day dinning needs.

The owners are very nice and always keep us coming back for more.  They pride themselves on there great Yelp reviews.  That&#39;s how they get a lot of their business.

The staff remember your &#34;usual&#39;s&#34; after a few times coming in.  Which makes you feel like home.

They make their own ranch dressing and it&#39;s AMAZING!!! I&#39;ve asked them for some to take home too, and it really helped bring some life into my own salads. Also their Baked French Onion Soup is very unusual, has some extra spices that really set it apart from others.  If you get a chance try the Beef Stew too.

I don&#39;t think I ever had anything here that wasn&#39;t really good.

As soon as you walk in, you see all of their bakery fresh pies and cakes.  They always cut the pieces extra big too.

The other reviews talking about parking, I&#39;m not sure if I understand because there is always parking.  I&#39;ve come at all times of the day.  Sure, sometimes you might have to park on the side, but this was not a big deal at all.  Every parking spot seems to be pretty close to the same distance from the front door.  Maybe they had problems because of the snow or something, but I never did.

They even have a nice room for small banquets.  Would be a great place for showers, or a wedding rehearsal dinner."

I love going out for breakfast and Pomegranate did not disappoint. It&#39;s less than 10 minutes from the DuPage Children&#39;s Museum so it makes for a great stop for me and my son before heading to the museum. 

Service was so friendly from beginning to end. Family friendly and anticipated our needs quickly. High Chair, crayons, coloring pages...BOOM. the trifecta of toddler dining needs brought to us in a blink of an eye. And for the mom--a smile, friendly greeting and a coffee CARAFE offered immediately. The trifecta of busy mom&#39;s needs in the morning. 

The menu offers a nice array of selections from pancakes/waffles, omelets, skillets, french toast, crepes and egg specials. 

We opted for the silver dollar pancakes (which were much bigger than what I expected) the eggs Florentine Benedict and a side of sausage. I loved my eggs dish. The eggs were perfectly poached and the hollendaise was well-made. The spinach was also well-cooked and everything just came together wonderfully. My son has never met a pancake he didn&#39;t like but he did gobble these up and enjoyed them. The sausage was perfectly cooked as well and very tasty.  A very good meal at an affordable price. 

Just as a side, there&#39;s one waffle dish that offers a pomegranate sauce and because I love pomegranates, I asked if I could have a small taste of it and they were more than happy to bring me a small sample. It&#39;s mildly sweet and almost jam-like. It was pretty good with the taste of pancake I sampled from my son&#39;s plate. 

Great place. I&#39;d love to make it back soon. Clean digs. Comfy setting."

The owner, Chris is so nice. He really cares about his patrons and wants to make sure everyone who walks in the door has a positive experience. 

All their food is cooked to order. If you are in a time crunch, this may not be the place for you, but if you are looking for high quality, delicious food, then come on in! I have tried many menu items as I have been coming here for years (and haven&#39;t posted a review yet!!) and have yet to have anything less than spectacular!! Their ranch dressing is home made and is the best I&#39;ve ever had!

The food quality and quantity for the price is unbeatable. I always have enough for a second meal to take home. If you are able to split something with someone, I say do it. They&#39;ll even separate the plates for a buck and give you each full size sides. They will also customize just about anything, all you have to do is ask!

Tip: There is typically a longer wait to have brunch on the weekends. They recently put in a small waiting area towards the back and offer free coffee while you wait. They also put in a few slot machines, if that is your thing, to make the time pass!"

I usually will not give low markings even if our service was mediocre. However, Mediocre service would have been an improvement from what we received. From the moment we walked in, some dude cleaning the windows mumbled about someone will seat you-- and then we sat by the hostess desk for a full 30 seconds while the servers kinda just stared at us from the kitchen. Finally someone came over, glummest look I&#39;ve ever seen. No &#34;good morning&#34; or &#34;sorry for the wait&#34; or &#34;welcome&#34;. &#34;Two?&#34; Was all the server said and seated us at our table. 
After such an unceremonious introduction to the place I finally took a look around. I could have forgiven the tacky decorations of fake pomegranates if they hadn&#39;t been covered in dust. The wood on all the benches had grime stains and there was this wall with what I can only assume had some sort of decoration previously. Someone must have ripped whatever it was off the wall as there were all these spots on the wall of missing paint. 
Then our server cAme along and asked if we wanted coffee. We got a big canister of it at the table. Which while that could be nice in a n exceptionally busy restaurant. There were only a small handful of customers and it gave off more of an air of &#34;here! Serve yourself!&#34;  The server told me no favorites or specials. She merely motioned to a rather crumpled looking piece of paper at the opposite end of the table to let us know where the &#34;specials&#34; were. 

Each time the server came to our table she would &#34;talk&#34; to us while looking to her left or her right. No eye contact. No warmth. I have no idea what her issue was. She spoke with the couple behind us at length about their baby and it looked like a regular she paid attention to. 

When our food came-- I did not receive my toast and had to ask a different server if I could have toast. No butter on the hot toast when it came. 

The food was waaaaaaay better than the service. And I actually liked my skillet. 

But I was so distracted by the staff. Not to mention the manager who LOOMED around. A big scowl on his face. Lounging over the furniture and watching all of us eat. It was awful. 

My husband and I finally were so appalled we had to start laughing. It seriously was so weird! Especially from all the previously &#34;great&#34; reviews. Maybe staff later is better? I am not sure. 

I can only say this. Don&#39;t listen to all these other reviews of great promise. I would keep driving and find another restaurant. We will NOT be returning."

Food&#39;s delicious,  servers are awesome and go above and beyond. However, I went this passed weekend with my 3 year old and my mom, we sat in the patio. A gust of wind came from no where and 2 or 3 umbrellas  flew off of other tables, one heading straight for my daughter! Had it not been for another gentleman dining there, she probably would&#39;ve gotten hurt. None of the owners came out. My mom had to go in and ask if they were aware of what just happened and the lady said,  &#34;yea, I saw&#34;. That was it. No apologies,  nothing. She later came out with a bus boy to remove all of the umbrellas from the tables? And still said nothing! Once I went in to pay she mentioned wanting to apologize, I said she could of done more and made the other diners more comfortable as well. She walked away. Sad to say I won&#39;t be going back there for a very long time."

Pretty much everything I&#39;ve had from Pomegranite is good (with the exception of the coffee - the coffee is weak - and the &#34;thick-cut&#34; bacon is not thick by any stretch of the imagination.) BUT... don&#39;t let those things deter you. 

The breakfast is pretty much what I stick to despite the time of day, so I can tell you the pancakes, waffles and stuffed French toast dishes are all damn tasty. Their omelettes are approximately the size of a football - the Butcher Block is my favorite - and I&#39;ve never been disappointed. 

On Saturdays, the potato soup is the special, and it&#39;s RIDIC. We have gone just for the soup during winter when we&#39;ve had a craving. I&#39;m married to a chef, and he craves this soup like mad. So that says something. 

They get busy but there usually isn&#39;t much of a wait. Service is generally good - it was kind of hit-or-miss last year when we first started frequenting the place, but it&#39;s gotten significantly better since we started going several times a month. In fact, we&#39;ve been three times in the last week, and I think they recognize us now. 

Solid breakfast spot. But don&#39;t forget the soup!

Side note: The spicy Bloody Mary is actually pretty excellent. I&#39;m a fan."

I was going to have breakfast but then our server told us about the prime rib sandwich special.  I ordered that and my wife ordered the Pomegranate burger.  We started with chicken rice soup.  It was hot and very flavorful.  Obviously homemade.  When we had finished the soup the owner passed by and asked if we wanted more.  The sandwich and burger were both very good.

Our server was like being served by your favorite aunt.  She treated us like regulars even though this was our first visit.

The coffee is very disappointing which for me is a deal killer and unforgiveable.  It was watery, bland and if you go order tea!  It is not that difficult to brew a rich robust cup of coffee.  And then there&#39;s the eggs.  My eggs were over medium in the Popeye Skillet.  One if my eggs broke and the yolk was already oozing and congealed.  The dish was called &#34;Popeye&#34; because it had spinach.  Spinach was chiffonaded like basil and barely there.  And in this dish the bacon was in crispy shards throughout.  Not memorable!  My dining companion had a &#34;Benedict&#34; dish with hard poached eggs that were so hard they looked like walnuts!  There was a side of pancakes that needed just another half minute on the griddle to not taste gummy.  Many of the reviews rave about lunch... I can&#39;t speak on that, but I&#39;ll go elsewhere for my next breakfast.

On a positive note service was great, friendly and prompt."

This is a pretty sized restaurant. There were several people waiting in line before us, and the wait time was probably less than 10 minutes. I think the restaurant manager brought us to our seat which was in their private room. I like the fact that they opened up their private room to serve their customers..instead of making us wait. This other lady who was the hostess was going to make us wait even longer, but we&#39;re thankful the manager brought us to our table. 

I ordered one of their skillet dishes and my husband ordered some kind of breakfast item that I can&#39;t remember. My skillet was good. Nothing really can go wrong with a skillet. My husband liked his dish. He also ordered a side of chicken noodle soup which was yum. They serve Lavazza coffee. My husband had a cup. I had a glass of their homemade fresh squeeze OJ which was good. 

Our waitress was nice. Although majority of her tables were on the opposite end of the restaurant so we didn&#39;t get to see her much, but she does check in every now and then and told us that we can ask the other waitress if we need anything and she&#39;s trying her best to check in with us every now and then. She also left us a pitcher of coffee, but the waitress behind our table took our pitcher and fed it to her table of guests GRRR. We thought she would return it but she never did. Good thing my husband didn&#39;t want any  more coffee.

Overall it was a nice brunch place to eat!"

It&#39;s relatively good. The omelettes are alright, the skillets are very good, and I love the benedicts; the eggs have more or less been poached perfectly (I&#39;ve never had a hard-poached one). I&#39;m not a fan of the hash browns most of the time since they&#39;re not the shredded kind. There has been one time when the cheese in an omelette hadn&#39;t completely melted, but aside from that I haven&#39;t had any issues at all. 
For anyone that&#39;s gluten-free, they do have gluten-free pancakes and waffles and they&#39;re delicious! But it&#39;s safe to assume that there&#39;s a risk for cross-contamination since this isn&#39;t a dedicated gluten-free restaurant. I also recommend avoiding the hash browns since they do have gluten in them.

Everyone has always been very friendly, even when it&#39;s very busy, which seems to be rare at other places.

Overall, it&#39;s a very good restaurant, at the very least for breakfast."

I&#39;ve been many times and each time I go back I think, &#34;my past wonderful experience MUST have been a fluke because it can&#39;t possibly be that good again&#34; and then I&#39;m floored that it turns out even BETTER! 

Laurence (the owner and som) is absolutely fantastic! His palette is precise and he never settles. The wine selection is unmatched even when compared to some high end restaurants.  But to add another level of awesome sauce, Laurence might be the owner, but the staff -- from the bussers to the cooks to the wait staff -- know their jobs and perform them with precision and excellence. 

The first time I went we tried to order off the menu, and it turned into Candice and Laurence bringing us what they liked and the pairings they enjoyed the most. We were really spoiled that night. 

The next time we had Iris and we got the SAME treatment! We didn&#39;t even LOOK at the menus that night! We dined on absolute deliciousness and had some things we wouldn&#39;t have ever thought to order! Everything was spectacular and paired perfectly from their large wine selection. 

Each and every time we go back, without fail, (so far) we&#39;ve had the same treatment, the same excellence, and the same perfection! 

They have fun events, so check out their website too! I&#39;d recommend a reservation also, but the don&#39;t do online or open table, so call them."

I saw it initially on Check Please, and perhaps that was my biggest issue -- it created expectations that could not be fulfilled. 

I came hungry -- famished really -- and was hoping for a much bigger menu selection than it offered. I didn&#39;t realize that the menu was so limited. I know the name is &#34;Bread and Wine,&#34; so maybe it&#39;s my own stupidity, but I was hoping for a meal such as chicken or steak, that could give me a substantial amount of protein.

The ambiance wasn&#39;t as expected either -- very small inside area with a bar, a few plain wood tables and unimpressive chairs. 

So those were my disappointments. We almost walked out... But we were already seated, and I don&#39;t know the other downtown Geneva restaurants too well to know if there were any better or more of what I was looking for, so we decided to bite the bullet and see what it was like.

The service was fine, and the food itself was extremely good. My boyfriend and I shared a meat and a cheese tray, and I had the tomato and bacon soup. Great presentations, very tasty -- no complaints there. However, wine and a couple of cheese/meat plates would have been just the start of the meal I hoped to enjoy that evening. Since both of us are laying off the carbs, a sandwich would be unacceptable. I would have gotten a salad, but none of the three on my menu sounded too exciting.

So it is what it is! If you are looking for a low-key place to enjoy a few glasses of wine and some tapas-like bites to go with it, it&#39;s the perfect spot. Dessert there might be good too. But don&#39;t go expecting a full-out meal, because it isn&#39;t what this place is about."

There are even heat lamps for when the temps turn a bit cooler outside.  Since I knew this ahead of time I had been waiting to pay them a visit when the weather was decent on a weeknight because Geneva in general is just way too packed on Fri/Sat/Sun.  Last night the weather was perfect and even being a Thursday night the restaurant was busy on the patios (inside only had 1 couple dining there &amp; 1 at the bar). They squeeze plenty of tables on the patios &amp; in the dining room so when busy expect to be privy to the neighboring tables&#39; conversations.

Our server was Iris and she was perfectly pleasant and attentive as was the rest of the staff.  I  thought the prices were quite reasonable as well, especially in comparison to other trendy wine/small plates places.  The obviously have an extensive wine list and they also have about a dozen specialty cocktails and a dozen beers on the drink menu.  We shared the Spanish cheese plate, the Lamb Meatloaf Focaccia sandwich (conveniently cut in to 4 pieces) and the Crispy Duck Spinach Salad.  The cheeses and the salad were outstanding!  The Lamb Meatloaf sandwich, while tasty, could have used some arugula or other greens to dress it up a bit. The sandwich did come with preserved lemon on it (I&#39;m not sure what form it was in but you could definitely taste it and it was a very nice complement to the meat) and was supposed to have pomegranate molasses as well but we really didn&#39;t notice that part if it was there.  What we DID notice was the sandwich had cheese on it, I believe it was goat cheese, and this was not mentioned on the menu at all.  Not that we mind cheese, we love cheese and reading the menu I thought the sandwich would be better with it but I could see for some people who do not want dairy this would be an issue.  For us it was an added bonus.  Sharing those 3 items was perfect for the 2 of us along with our drinks as we don&#39;t normally eat big, heavy meals.

We had a hard time selecting what to try since so many things sounded delicious so we&#39;d definitely like to come back and try some other items."

Fantastic wine selection and a large variety of hot and cold small plates to sample. Don&#39;t be fooled though, its not just a wine bar; the food is phenomenal and the plates are quite large and filling. It&#39;s a smaller venue and reservations are highly recommended. Every member of the staff we interacted with was super friendly and helpful. 

We asked our waitress to recommend a Cab Sauv and she suggested a great one w/ the Obsidian Ridge. Oaky and on the drier side, we loved it!   

The bacon jam, blue cheese, and arugula crostini is killer. The bacon jam is pretty sweet and tasted exactly like pulled pork to me. The more bitter arugula and tart blue cheese nicely balanced the sweet flavors making these the perfect starter.

The duck salad was good but just not as memorable as the other 2 plates.  The crispy duck was kinda too crispy but overall the mix of duck, spinach, and fresh cherries worked really well.  The salad was quite large for us to split and nicely dressed. 

The cold roast beef sandwich was fantastic!  Best plate of the night. The beef was nice and rare, super juicy, and piled high. The bread was a little on the hard side but tasted great. The horseradish slaw wasn&#39;t too strongly flavored and worked perfectly with the beef and roasted onions."

My second visit is lunch to celebrate my birthday.   The host with the cute tie and I shared the same birthday :)
We sat at a tall table up front.  I am super impressed how this restaurant able to make simple dishes taste so good and memorable.  The grilled pastrami sandwiches and french onion soups were delicious (only$10 as lunch special).  You can taste the quality of each individual ingredient, including the mustard.  The mushroom tart with pastry top were served hot.  Everything was just well execution.

I saw it check please.  I was hoping for good food.  I order a pulled pork sandwich.  I only ate 1/4 of it the bread was cold.  And so was the meat.  If I am going to have pork it better be at least warmed up.  The  pulled pork sandwich had the slaw which was too tart for my liking.  My friend had the beef pie.  Ok it was a very small square dish with a crust on top of it.  How horrible if you are serving a pie make look like a pie or collect something else in the menu.  Or is a lazy way to make a pie.

The only good thing there was the French onion soup.  It was tasty and it was not salty at all.

We started off with the European cheese platter. The cheese platter was amazing! Our favorite was the Saint angel cheese nice and creamy loved it! Perfect combination with a crispy little baguette and some wine! 

My friend and I both had the cup of French onion soup with a half of the pastrami sandwich. It was amazing! The soup came out super fresh, and I&#39;m usually not a huge French onion soup girl but this was amazing finished the whole cup! The sand which was very delicious as well, had a nice combination of mustard, pickle, and the pastrami tasted homemade. My other girlfriend had half of the tomato bacon soup with half grilled cheese.

The hubs and I came here for some apps and wine and let me tell you, it was a darling little date. The restaurant is small and dimly lit. I&#39;m obsessed with their wine glasses because they&#39;re huge! I honestly can&#39;t remember what kind of wine I had, but it was red, full bodied and delicious. Our server was very knowledgeable when it came to wine, so he provided great suggestions.

The menu boasts options like sandwiches, soup, salad, charcuterie, cheese, small bites, flatbread, and of course dessert. Everything looked amazing. We ordered a couple small bites and a spread of their charcuterie. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s still on their menu, but we started with a spicy linguica sausage cassoulet with duck confit, pork, and apricots. WOW. Amazing. 

Following that we had the housemade lox with dill rye chip capers. I couldn&#39;t believe how much flavor was in such little bites!

To wrap this little preview of their menu up, we ordered a charcuterie board that included speck, Barolo salmi, and duck prosciutto. I mean, I&#39;m basically STILL dreaming of the duck prosciutto. Perfection.

The menu was a tad intimidating just because there were so many different items I&#39;ve never had before, so I&#39;m glad our server was an expert! It was such a fun date spent grazing over delicious bites that paired well with our wine. If you ask me, that&#39;s the way to dine here! I have heard excellent things about their other menu items though, so you better believe I&#39;ll be back.

Pro tip: They have delicious bread for sale, so grab a loaf before you go!"

A girlfriend and I came here after work for a drink, and so glad we landed here! We were actually planning on going to another location in downtown Geneva, but it turns out the location was open but didn&#39;t serve food until 6pm. One requirement for me when I&#39;m drinking....I must have some sort of munchies, so that original place was out. We walked a few blocks and found Preservation Bread and Wine, which had a great menu of small plates and unique drinks. 

I can&#39;t remember what drink I had, but it was a delicious mixed drink and STRONG! Typically I only have one drink, but I can handle two when going out with co-workers. This one? I had to eat more to take the buzz off before we parted ways for the evening! The mixed drink menu is small, but each drink that me and my girlfriend had were awesome!

Spinach &amp; Artichoke Bread Pudding - It sounds odd, but that&#39;s one of the reasons we ordered it! It&#39;s exactly what it sounds like.....savory bread pudding. It was an awesome take on spinach artichoke dip. I think the best part was the chunks of toasted feta that were sprinkled on top....mmm!

European Cheese Plate - love cheese plates ;) They are so yum! We couldn&#39;t choose, but our server gave us the suggestion of the european cheese plate. It had a great balance of cheeses, with my favorite being the saint angel cheese ;)

Charcuterie - we had some sort of charcuterie plate, but I can&#39;t remember which one we had (they have two). It was great with the cheese, but who can really screw up a plate of delicious meats?

This is a great place to have a glass of wine with friends to sit and relax ;)"

I love the crunchy brioche bread done to golden perfection featuring a blend of oouy gooey white cheeses.  The best thing to do is to get the creamy tomato bisque. This way you can dip the sandwich into the soup. It is amazing how they can elevate something as basic as a grilled cheese sandwich to a gourmet delicacy. My other favorite items are the mushroom tart and the short rib puff pastry. They could get away with using the same crust for both items, but I love how one is like a pie crust and the other a puff pastry. I also highly recommend the cheese boards and charcuterie. The cole slaw is one of the few items which is not to my liking. If you like ginger get the ginger martini. Even if it&#39;s a little chilly at the beginning or end of the season, don&#39;t be afraid to try the porch. It is fully enclosed and has heat. Please be aware the portion sizes are small plate. If you have a big appetite, it will be pricy but well worth it."

We each did the lunch special which was your choice of a sandwich and either french onion or potato leek soup. I ordered the grilled vegetable on focaccia sandwich, because I&#39;m pretty much a sucker for anything involving focaccia. My favorite part of the meal was the dessert - bread pudding. Probably the best bread pudding I&#39;ve ever had!

I live in downtown Chicago, so it was quite the trek getting to this place - but it was easily accessible by Metra. I didn&#39;t think it was anything spectacular, but I might stop in again if I&#39;m in the area. Service was excellent, so I added on an additional star for that."

More seating in the back, think four seasons add on patio room complete with wired patio seating.

We came for apps only but can&#39;t wait to try their short rib pot pie next time!  Menu&#39;s definitely small but the quality&#39;s there.  We ordered the Spanish charcuterie plate ($12) which came with speck, salami al barolo, and duck proscuitto.  It was a nice mix mild, rich, and textured meats.  Fell in love with the garnish of small mild peppers.

We also had the European cheese plate ($12) that included a soft Saint Angel from France, a mild Zamorano from Spain, and a stronger Balarina goat cheese from the Netherlands.  They again got creative with their garnish of picked watermelon rinds."

What a delightful lunch. The service was excellent, the food was great, even the people around us were so nice. 

This place is small, the front space seats 30. They are very conscience of seating people smartly. We came in, there was a table for 4 empty, and they asked for our name and number so they could text us when a two top opened up. 

We had the pork rillette, which was heavenly. It&#39;s a lovely rustic pate that, when done correctly, is devine. And this was!

I ordered the pastrami lunch special with baked french onion soup. The soup was so good, no overload of cheese, just a really great broth and very well done! The pastrami was not good. The pastrami was incredibly dry, as was the dill rye bread. Seriously hard to swallow. And no pastrami flavor, very disappointing.

My husband ordered the spicy linguica with duck confit cassoulet. I loved it!! damn good!!

The overall experience was really wonderful. We drove about an hour, and it was worth it. It was great and right next to my favorite Spice House!!"

Wednesday our favorite flatbread (Kale and bacon) is available. Simply the best flatbread I have ever tasted. Great deserts - try the pine nut tart when it is available.

If you haven&#39;t tried out one of their special wine dinners you are missing out on a great experience and value. We have attended 5 of the New&#39;s Year Eve&#39;s dinners and recommend them highly too.

I dined at Preservation Food and Wine alone for lunch today.  I have been attempting to limit carbs because of my diabetes, so I chose what I thought might be the friendliest plate -- weisswurst (thinking Oktoberfest), with spaetzle and beer cheese sauce.  I figured that I&#39;d a a bite or two of the luscious German noodles and then concentrate on what I felt might be two links of Bavarian sausages.  

The first warning occurred when the smallish restaurant began to smell like something was definitely burning.  Although my blood sugar was definitely on the low side, I wasn&#39;t otherwise in a huge hurry, but I still hoped silently that it wasn&#39;t my dish.  Afterall, who can burn weisswurst when properly braising them in a bit of water so that they can be eaten in the traditional manner?  Unfortunately, my server delivered the bad news to me that the cook/chef feared that she had overcooked (read burned) my delicately seasoned veal sausages.  BUT, she assured me, the cook/chef was going to start over. The second attempt, if it was indeed a fresh start, was dark brown and crusty. 

Not awfully long afterward, I received my $11.00 plate (not listed as &#34;small&#34; on the menu) with one burnt link of weisswurst snuggled next to something which resembled rabbit droppings.  OK, I&#39;m thinking, they lightly sauteed the spaetzle in brown butter or something equally as delectable.  Sadly, they were solid and rather chewy/crunchy but not in a good way.  

The owner approached me while I was eating to see how I was enjoying my food.  I always try to be positive, so I told him that even though I had lived in Germany, I had never tasted crunchy spaetzle.  He simply explained that they &#34;sauteed&#34; it.  I also commented that my expectations for the wurst were also based on the ritual eating of it in Bavaria.  I did not claim that this was the only way, however, and pretty much left it at that.  

We had a nice chat about the restaurant business.  He has always been very pleasant, and I will go back. As you can see by my previous review, I have had excellent experience(s) there and love their charcuterie and cheese boards.  The 4 friends I brought with me the last time all said that they would definitely return as well.  

I haven&#39;t decided whether I&#39;m off base on my culinary preferences, or whether whomever was in the kitchen today was slightly clueless."

After learning it was my first time, the lady at the next table offered some dining selections (which I took). My friend and I both took advantage of the lunch special, which for about $1 more, you can add a cup of soup or salad to your sandwich. We both got the smoked turkey/apple sandwiches. I got the tomato bacon soup, and my friend got the French onion soup. We both enjoyed the meal, then spent another hour or so walking around Geneva.

-The dulce bourbon drink was delicious and strong  ($11 and tiny, but hey this is geneva) 
-Interesting and intriguing menu, will likely return to try some of their cheese dishes/small plate items and other cocktails

The only negative was that my shrimp and chorizo baguette was disappointing. The amount of meat on it was so small, the chorizo was unusually chewy, and the baguette bread was too hard. Maybe baguettes just aren&#39;t my thing...

-The creative dishes were a major letdown. My lamb meatloaf sandwich was dry and had a huge kick of lemon that I was not a fan of. 
-Prices. I felt like I barely got any food for the almost $70 I ended up spending. It was like that Cheetos commercial where they unveil the steak dish and there isn&#39;t even a steak so they start eating a bunch of Cheetos. Only instead of Cheetos we stopped at Jewel and I got a steak and cheese burrito for a dollar."

Limited bar but everything is carefully chosen and works.  Space there is limited too, but that somehow works as well.    I love this place!   Real bistro atmosphere.  You can dress anyway you want and not feel out of place.    Ginger martini is an amazing concoction of theirs that will rock your world.   Everything on the menu is above and beyond what I expect...every time I go in.   

Consider me a Preservation cultist.  Just love the place, the owner, the help.  

Very convenient for commuters...steps from the train station.   You could miss this place easily and that would be a terrible mistake!

Music is really good their too, btw."

Good atmosphere and great cheese plates.   

+ The service is great, very friendly and helpful
+ European eating style (they do not rush you) 
+ Long amazing list of wines, by bottle and glass
+ Many small tasty plates offered 

- Space is limited, very small bar area
- Seating a bit tight (best to come early avoid dinner rush)
- Not very much privacy as the table are very close to each other

Call ahead for a reservation as there is only so much room once inside. :-)"

We have been trying to make time to have dinner her. Valentines Day was coming and we finally went. It was a pre-set dinner and wine paring. I generally don&#39;t care for this, but I was presently surprised. Everything was so fresh and of great quality. You could tell the moment the first dish was served.
The atmosphere was very relaxing and the staff was knowledge and friendly. We started with Endive Boats, they were perfect little salads that you ate with your hands. Dinner was Crispy chicken thighs cooked with olives and baby bell peppers. I can tell they seasoned the meal with fresh herbs, nothing from a bottle. It literally melted in your mouth. Dessert was Chocolate Bread pudding with fresh strawberries. Every course was pared with a different wine. The server explained what the wine was and why it was picked in the most un-pretentious manor. The picks were spot on. We can&#39;t wait to come back to order off the menu and try different dishes. I highly recommend this restaurant for a romantic date night, to a casual dinner with friends. Can not wait to return!"

We made a reservation and were seated quickly. Waters came quickly. Our server asked us if we had any questions and what our wine preferences were so she could help us choose. The reisling I got was killer (I&#39;m kicking myself for not writing the name down somewhere). My friend enjoyed both of her reds that she got. For her second glass our server brought her samples of two that she may like. 

We had the american cheese platter. All 3 cheeses where good, but the parmesan was just difficult to work with since it isn&#39;t soft. We also had the flat bread which was really good, but less olives would have been okay in my opinion. 

I forgot how quickly tabs can build at places like this. We hit 70 dollars total and probably could have stayed for more wine if we had unlimited wallets.

Overall, this was a great first time at this place. Looking forward to returning or finding other wine places similar to this."

I had heard that the food was &#34;small bites&#34; or tapas style and so when I would suggest it my husband would usually respond &#34;but I&#39;m too hungry.&#34; But finally we went and I am so glad we did.

First, it is tapas style, but it is filling. After a few plates, we were stuffed. Which was sad because there was so much more we wanted to try. The food is delicious. We had the Spanish charcuterie (amazing) and Cow Cheese plate (great, but nothing crazy exciting), the turkey, Apple and walnut sandwich (waitress suggested it as their top seller and I can see why - delicious), and the mushroom tart (to die for). The wine list is also fabulous but be prepared to plunk down some $$ for it. The seating area can be really tight, so go to the bathroom before you&#39;re seated and be prepared to be close to strangers.

Personally, I like ordering a cheese plate - they have a few - and one of the charcuterie selections. Ask a question about ANYTHING, and they will tell you whatever you want to know.

We were greeted by a man in a white linen shirt who led us to our table. He also came out a couple of times during our lunch to make sure everything was OK. Owner? Manager? Chef?

Our waitress was friendly and seemed to know the menu well; she took the time to explain things to us since this was our first visit. We chose the $10 lunch special (asparagus soup and sandwich) which was a decent price compared to other things on the menu. We tried two different sandwiches - the turkey and pastrami. Both were delicous. We were told that they smoke their own turkey and that they make the pastrami in the restaurant. We also ordered a buttercrunch citrus salad. It came in a tiny bowl (barely enough for one side serving) and the citrus consisted of a few microscopic pieces of grapefruit and orange. The photo on their web site is deceiving! And for $7.50, this salad was definitely a rip-off. Save your money and don&#39;t order this salad - unless you don&#39;t mind paying $7.50 for a few bites of lettuce.

We would like to go back to this place with some friends so we could taste some of the other offerings. After all, this place is more of a tapas or small plate place - food made for sharing. If you&#39;re REALLY hungry, you&#39;re going to be ordering a lot of little plates of food and spending way too much money."

After calling a few other hot spots in Geneva and unable to get a table there, we were pleased to book an early table for 3 at Preservation. 
Well, it must have been our lucky day that the other two places were booked because this was an experience!
First....upon walking in right at our scheduled time, we were promptly greeted by the owner who apologized that the table wasn&#39;t immediately ready and that they were working on a &#34;creative solution.&#34; We were seated within three minutes and the creative solution was a cozy table in the back dining room (enclosed patio) in which the third seat was a chair with the legs cut off to fit into its spot---so cute, we loved it!
They had an awesome selection of cheeses- many of which I&#39;d never heard of but luckily if you had any questions about anything the servers were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Most of the &#34;small plates&#34; are set up with about three or four different cheese and meat options fort about $10-$15 a pop- the plates have suggested groupings but you can design your own plate by picking anything that you want- that was super cool! Everything we tasted was totally delicious and beautifully plated. Do not miss the flatbread pizza!
All in all a bill for three ladies with  a few drinks a piece was a little over $100 w/o tip so definitely not a cheap place but I personally found it to be really reasonably priced for what this was- a wine bar essentially.  
My mother had the best time and we will be back to celebrate another holiday here- planning on bringing the men next time to see if they love it as much as we did!"

The cheese plate was good,  but nothing that exciting or new. Our plate was served with pickled watermelon and chopped beets.

The food is at a quality level that you would expect in the city with a creative offering.  Some other issues however, cast a cloud over our experience.  The wine list is extensive but too expensive.  Half bottles are the price of full bottles at other restaurants.  Glasses of wine are typically $10+.  Corkage fee is $25, essentially ruling out bringing in your own wine.  Overall price of our meal with a half bottle of wine came in at $85.  The restaurant facility is small and typically very loud.  There is a seating area in the rear of the restaurant that is best described as an all weather sun room.  Our feeling was that a $100 dinner should involve at least a table cloth.  Unfortunately the ambiance in this rear section is not much better than a fast food restaurant.

The atmosphere is cozy and dim; huddle up with your wine for a chat with your dining companion. 

Our waitress was efficient and very knowledgeable about the wines (I had questions about a couple of the reds, i.e. which would have a &#34;smoother&#34; finish -- she recommended one, but brought samples of two for me to try. The recommendation was the one I preferred.)

Preservation serves dishes tapas-style, so lots of little plates. 

We started with the European cheese plate (generous for two people); perhaps even more enjoyable than the cheeses were the watermelon rind pickles and beet-ginger chutney that offset them.

Their special that night was flatbread pizzas; when I first came in and was waiting for my companion, I&#39;d started talking with the people beside me, who&#39;d ordered the duck flatbread pizza and were raving about it. I must admit it would never occur to me to get this...but then my companion suggested we get it. The duck added a rich counterpoint to sweet caramelized onions and the crisp bread. An unusual dish. 

We also ordered the dish of macaroni and cheese, but this was a sort of strange excecution: large shells (say an inch), with the cheese sauce sort of underneath them, so the mass had to be mixed...it just didn&#39;t do it for me, though my companion (who had dined here before) had recommended it specially.

The mounting tapas plates were a bit challenging to arrange on our itty-bitty table, but our waitress swung by at convenient times to help relieve us.

Overall, there were some adventurous dishes, but I can&#39;t say it was the best tapas I have ever had. Still, good service, adventurous food and many more items on the menu. You can preserve this one in your memory as a possibility."

That&#39;s right, Preservation Bread &amp; Wine, you get a slow clap for being so awesome. What rich foods and defined wines you have?!?  My lamb meatloaf sandwich, coupled with a lovely medium bodied red wine, which by the way was randomly picked by our waiter- shout out to Alex, were delectable!  Equally important, the entire staff was courteous, prompt, and easy going! Seriously, you can&#39;t beat that!

As for the ambiance and atmosphere?  LOVE IT!  It&#39;s alright for small groups but  truly ideal for intimate dates or one-on-one get togethers with good friends!  This place does get crowded, but it has this charm that&#39;s makes it okay.

First, I know this makes me sound really douchey, but I had no idea there was this kind of stuff in out here. I&#39;m an urbanophile through and through, but I was amazed at how cute and dense downtown Geneva actually is.

This place could easily fit in any yuppie neighborhood of a major city. The cocktails are simple enough not to be pretentious, but still full of flavor. The food really shines, from the perfectly-smoky tomato-bacon soup (served with awesome homemade brioche) to the short rib pie, which is the staff favorite, for a good reason. And the service was prompt and friendly, which is not something I&#39;m accustomed to after two years on the west coast.

This was another excellent Yelp find by my wife, and I know I&#39;ll get a craving for it again the next time we&#39;re in Geneva...but with so many cute shops and restaurants there, we&#39;ll have to force ourselves to try something new!"

When i visit my bro in Geneva we always make a stop here. Its very tiny, so get there early if you want to snag a table. In nice weather they have a patio out back which provides additional room for seating..yay! 

Great wine selection and they do a good job with cocktails too (and i&#39;m a serious cocktail snob). What really keeps me coming back though is the food!

THe cheese and charcuterie plates are well executed. Very generous portions and I live the sides that accompany them (picked veg and such). My fav is the spanish charcuterie plate.

Also a big fan of lots of the small plates i&#39;ve eaten. Too many to list but one recent stand out was the falafel (who would have thought?) -the honey tiziki sauce is insane. If you live nearby or happen to find yourself in Geneva...come check this place out!"

My friend had  a glass of riesling and liked it and i had coffee, which was excellent.  We were too full for dessert but smelled the pies or tarts that the table next to us had and they smelled delicious. We also loved the screened in patio --it&#39;s a very cozy and modern atmosphere--can be a good date night place or just with friends or family.

We were visiting Geneva 2 years ago from out of town and were here on a Sunday and unfortunately Preservation was closed. Thankfully, this time, when we popped in for lunch on a Saturday, it was open. We were greeted by the owner, who was so friendly and upbeat and passionate about his food and wine. My husband (who is a vegetarian) and I split the grilled vegetable sandwich with a cup of squash soup, the mushroom tart and the spinach and artichoke bread pudding. All delicious! The only thing that was a little odd was the pine nut tart. Not bad, but just a weird combo of flavors for my liking. The bottle of white wine was excellent. My husband knows his wine and was so excited to see this bottle, which was unique and different and not easy to find. We will definitely come back here the next time we visit Geneva!!"

The meatloaf is cut thin so as not to be overbearing, then set on an almost pillowy light foccacia (which I also feared would be too heavy, but was perfect). The heartiness of the meatloaf was balanced delicately with the tanginess of a soft cheese and the bright sourness of preserved lemon.  

Can&#39;t wait to try another one in 2 weeks (have to come to Geneva from work)."

Needless to say, I came to Burrito Parrilla Mexicana starving. 

My fiancé and I both ordered 3 tacos a-la-carte. She ordered Al Pastor, and I ordered Lengua (tongue). Lengua is my go-to at a Mexican restaurant, and Al Pastor is hers. These tacos were fantastic! I ate three large tacos in about 4 bites. I was able to sample her taco as well, and it was just as tasty! 

Service was fast and friendly, and the tacos were affordable. The complimentary chips and salsa added a nice touch, and the salsa was outstanding! It was flavorful and packed a punch. However, it wasn&#39;t so spicy that I didn&#39;t enjoy it. 

I will definitely be returning to Burrito Parrilla Mexicana in the future!"

I seriously love good grilled chicken fajitas.  I often joke that &#34;they&#39;re my medicine,&#34; helping me cope with the world.  I&#39;m only half-joking, though.  I would probably be a horrible human being, if I didn&#39;t get good fajitas every so often.  The chicken fajitas here were excellent, with lots of perfectly-grilled veggies.  The fresh flour tortillas were perfect, as were all of the sides.  The portions were generous, but I still managed to pound down two glasses of their horchata (I like that their wasn&#39;t too sweet), and two more glasses of the virgin pina colada.  

There are plenty of other places to get a great fajita dinner, but the service here is above-and-beyond any of the other burrito places in the area that I&#39;ve tried thus far.  The restaurant has lots of seating, is very clean, and I enjoy the table service.  You&#39;d think that the extra amenities would put them out of the price range of many of their smaller competitors in the area, but the prices were very reasonable.  There are so many great places to eat in the Lombard area, but this is a clear contender for one of top 3 in the neighborhood.  I&#39;m looking forward to getting lunch or dinner here again - it&#39;s WAY cheaper than therapy, and probably more effective!"

What we did not like were the red salsas that came with our meal. There was a spicy and a mild and the spicy tasted worse. We threw those out. The churros were really good and soft.

The pineapple coconut is refreshing and really sweet and tropical. The horchata is on point, perfect amount of cinnamony flavor in the drink.

My al pastor tortas was decent, nothing too amazing. I would want to try the fajitas because I saw another customer eating it and it looked really yummy.

I got two al pastor tacos and a chicken taco. The chicken was dry so I would not recommend getting the chicken. 

While we waited for our orders, the waitress gives us free chips and salsa. One of my favorite parts about this place is the unlimited refill of horchata and pineapple coconut juice.

Their tacos are pretty good, as well, but the quesadillas are the stand out for me, obviously.

Burrito came with iceberg lettuce, refried beans, and pepper Jack cheese on top. The dinner option includes a side of rice and refried beans.

 In terms of portion size one is more than enough.  Burrito could barely fit into my hand. It is at least 4 inches in diameter and 6 inches long.

Food was served quick and server&#39;s were very responsive for a semi cheap fast food place.

I&#39;ve been here a couple times and now I know what my favorite dish is.  The Beef Nachos, which comes with tomato, lettuce, sour cream, guac, cheese and pico -- OMGGGGGGG yum!  I would def say this is the best Mexican food in the area.  It is very nice inside and clean mod decor.

I love that they give you salsa and chips while your waiting.  There is another green salsa in a squeeze bottle on the table that is very good if you mix with the salsa on the chips...I have it down to a science LOL.  The people who wait on you and at the register are very nice.  Even though it is fast food, you do not get this feeling when you are inside, which is nice compared to other Mexican cuisine restaurants around here."

But what I love the most is that the steak is chargrilled   So you don&#39;t get that greasy taste and pork doesn&#39;t mix with the steak because it&#39;s on a separate skewer.  I love the pineapple coconut juice they and to top it off their churros are off the chain with a delicious Carmel dipping sauce.

That is all.

In all seriousness, we used to live in the area but moved away a few years ago. In fact, this review is long overdue. We have yet to find a restaurant in our area whose horchata compares to Burrito&#39;s. We go directly to Burrito as soon as we are in town for our horchata fix. No joke. Other than the horchata (I&#39;m craving one now and our next to trip to Chicagoland isn&#39;t for many, many months, boohoo) we appreciate the friendly service and cleanliness of the restaurant.

Everything we&#39;ve had to eat has been fresh and all around great, the facility is appealing and clean, and the service is prompt and pleasant.

We used to come here a lot about a year ago. Due to busyness and a second child, life hasn&#39;t brought us this way as often lately. Today, we&#39;re back! Bottomless horchata, how I missed you. I&#39;m pretty sure I drink my entire day&#39;s worth of recommended calories each time we&#39;re here.

I like: the salsa, the stunning restroom, healthy kids meals under $5, and of course, ALLOFTHEFOOD! Seriously, you can&#39;t choose wrong.

I got a steak burrito, nachos and some horachta. The steak was way over done and could not of been drier. The burrito was wrapped poorly (which is a common complaint of mine). I had too many bites of only 1 ingredient. I would give the burrito just 2 stars.

The nachos were solid and the all you can drink horachta was good as well. I feel like I should give them another chance but I really felt like Taco Bell delivers a better burrito than them. 

To be honest, there&#39;s so many good mexican places in the area I would just skip this place..."

I really, really, really, really wanted to love Burrito. I&#39;ve had friends that have nothing but great things to say about it. But when we went, on a steamy Saturday afternoon in August, there was just nothing that great about it.

We tend to eat lunch really late on Saturdays. Like around 3-4 p.m. It&#39;s not that we sleep in and have breakfast late or anything, we just get so tied up in whatever we&#39;re doing in the daytime that we kind of put it off until we&#39;re starving and can&#39;t wait anymore.

So we hit Burrito, actually craving Chipotle, but this place was closer to our new house.

And we paid sit-down prices for what was really a Chipotle-style meal with some beans and rice as well as complimentery chips &amp; salsa. Meh.

My wife had chicken. I had the al pastor. They were both burritos. They were both dry as hell and pretty tasteless except for the hot sauce/salsa stuff we kept loading on them to choke the things down. I&#39;m sorry, but flavorless is just not my style. It was absolutely not worth the money we paid and I feel that we would have received a better value and better product had we just gone to Chipotle as we originally planned."

The manager who took our order was seriously delightful. It was 91 degrees and only getting hotter and I probably would have hurt his feelings if he acted like a jerk. He told us what was good, how we ordered and pretty much hooked us up.

The menu is small but they pretty much offer the standard Mexican fare with a meat, bean and cheese of your choosing. 

The burritos were 6.99$ and were a nice size. Lets just say, you won&#39;t walk away hungry. The guacamole was perfect. Well, almost perfect. It could have used a bit of lemon but seriously? Amazing. 

BEST FAJITA TACOS EVER. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;ve never insisted on FRESH cilantro on my tacos but these guys know what&#39;s up! I&#39;m still drooling over those tacos. Your choice of corn or flour tortillas as well.

They offer chips and salsa in private smaller bowls and unlimited refills. The salsa they offer is mild but he said he keeps the &#34;burn your a*s&#34; stuff in the back. (JK, I said that, but for real, in the back)

I came here several times between December-March and not a single complaint, five star experience all the way. Unfortunately, when I came again in July, much was left to be desired. I ordered a kids veggie burrito for my daughter. It came with fries. Fries? Why not beans or rice? Speaking of, no beans or rice in the burrito either. It was literally a few sticks of deliciously sautéed zucchini and peppers hidden amongst a big blob of cheese. What could have been amazing and healthy was gross and almost inedible. If I have one suggestion, cut back on the cheese a bit, add more veggies, throw in some black beans and plate it with some iceberg and tomato and a scoop of rice. On the plus side, some of the best horchata we have ever tried. I have had the breakfast which was great and the veggie enchiladas which were good.

I&#39;m literally getting hungry just writing this review.
We driven to Lombard about 6 times in the last 6 months just for this restaurant.

The steak tacos are to die for. Generally we crave steak tacos so we hadn&#39;t tried anything else... But on our last visit my fiance tried one chicken, one pork and one steak instead. The pork was delicious! It had the texture of duck confit - buttery, melt in your mouth awesomeness. And don&#39;t get me started on the wonderful housemade tortillas!

You get chips and salsa when you dine in. The tomato salsa has great flavor, and the salsa in the bottle has a barbeque flavor to it that is unique and delightful. We like to mix the two together.

Complete the meal with either their deliciously not-to-sweet horchata or pineapple juice concoction and you won&#39;t be disappointed.

I got the al pastor taco dinner.  The rice and beans were blah.  The tacos were OK, but I&#39;ve had much better. For what I ordered, I thought it a bit pricey.  

OK, so maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  I went back again yesterday and ordered the chicken enchiladas.  Again, everything was sort of tasteless and very Americanized.  Chipotle is much more flavorful and less expensive.  The one plus was the spicy salsa, which was very good, but then any good Mexican restaurant makes good salsa.

Sorry, two strikes is enough for me.  I&#39;m not planning to go back."

I&#39;m glad to see that it is finally getting a good customer base. Last time I went for lunch it was packed! 

The setup is fast food style. You order at the counter. I highly recommend the taco plates, especially with the onions and cilantro. You get a number, self-serve your drinks and find a seat. While waiting you get warm chips and salsa. The service is always quick, and most items cost around $7-$9. The food is always good quality, fast, and reasonably priced."

The ingredients are fresh and assembled to order. Orders are ready fairly quickly and reasonably priced. I like the tacos al pastor (though I always have to search for the pineapple), the lengua tacos, the chorizo tacos, and the carnitas tacos. I like that I can get my tacos with fresh cilantro and onions instead of cheese and (ugh) lettuce. There&#39;s a generous portion of meat on each taco, but it is underseasoned and sometimes dry. The rice and beans are bland so I no longer order a taco plate. 

Compared to many other local fast food and fast casual choices, I&#39;ll choose Burrito Parilla Mexicana&#39;s tacos because they&#39;re fresh and the restaurant is very clean. And I&#39;m swayed by the fact that Burrito Parrilla Mexicana is convenient to my home and the service is friendly.

I wanted a snack before a very large dinner and ordered the kids plate, which proved to be more than enough for me. When I&#39;m traveling I never eat at chain restaurants that I can visit at home. I learned this was a family owned restaurant that has several locations in Chicago. The quality of the food was very authentic and fresh. No grease, no guilt. They even have something I have not seen since Chi Chi&#39;s closed in the 90&#39;s--- Fried ice cream! Coconut Pineapple slushies. I want it so badly, but what will I do later when I have a 3 course dinner?   Guess I have to hit this again before going to the airport.. Very modern decor. Friendly service. Beautiful open kitchen.

I just returned home with completely the wrong order. When I called the store in an attempt to rectify the situation, I was met with defensiveness and hostility. I am holding the receipt, know what I ordered, and can clearly see what I have in front of me, which is wrong. 

The person on the phone said there was no manager, assistant manager, or owner who could be reached...what if an employee was injured, the power went out, there was a fire in the kitchen, etc. still no one. Adding insult to injury, I was also informed that they were closed for the night and there was not even a way to refund the order. So I guess half my family eats, and the other half goes hungry. 

When they get it right, the food is great. However, this isn&#39;t the first this has happened. So the gamble is no longer worth it. 

To the owners/management, please reevaluate those who represent your business to your customers. The fact that my family is essentially out $40 worth of food without any form of rectification, isn&#39;t just inconvenient, it feels a lot more like questionable business practices"

Anyways, I ordered the veggie fajitas, and it was delicious! !! An ample amount of food for the price. The veggies were delicious! The tortillas were soft. Honestly, it was all soo good.

I typically go for the burrito al pastor.  The burrito is about the size of my thigh, and they pile on the meat, cheese and guac if you ask for it (take that Chipotle, with your measly portion sizes).  I weighed the burrito after I got it home one night.  It weighed in at over a pound, and yes, I did eat the whole thing.  All this for around $8?  Awesome!

This is located on the northwest corner of 88/butterfield/highland.  Yes, that shitty intersection.  Nearby restaurants include the Patio, Pinched, etc.

As others have stated, this is kind of an upscale type of Mexican joint.  I like the food here.  It may not have the autheticity you expect at the typical dive, but it&#39;s still tasty and great for a lunch.  The prices are a tad on the higher side, but with the free chips and salsa, you can usually get by for lunch no problem.

The concept is similar to other quick service restaurants like Panera or Chipotle, but it takes a little longer so you order and then you get a number which you place at your table.  They have fountain drinks and horchata and a pineapple coconut drink.  

I usually get the torta.  Something about that sammich just hits the spot.  I like the slices of avocado and the other trimmings.  It doesn&#39;t come with rice and beans, so that could be good or bad depending on your interests."

Walking in, it looks like it could be a sibling of Chipotle but with partial table service. You order at the counter; pay;  they give you a number;  you get your drink self service style (and it&#39;s unlimited refills on Horchata--don&#39;t forget that!); find a seat;  a server will bring you chips and salsa;  and minutes later your food arrives.  Nice! 

I met Michele S for lunch as she knows what&#39;s what.  There basically tacos, burritos, tortas, mixed grill items and salads on the menu but you can customize it.  I ordered the al pastor burrito with lettuce, cheese and beans. With Horchata, my total was about 10bux. Not bad for a filling meal, made to order, fresh ingredients and unlimited Horchata!

The burrito was a very nice serving size and pretty yummy.  The meat was well made, not as flavorful as my favorite taco joint&#39;s al pastor, but for a fast foody type of place, I was pretty impressed. The salsas on the table were good too. I especially liked the smokier one, it added some good flavor to the burrito.

Location is probably why and the building looks very clean and new. 

I got the $7 steak burrito. Pretty average but the sauce is what stands out. They give you a deal red sauce with peppers and it&#39;s amazing. Also ask for pico De gallo and cilantro, they don&#39;t come standard on the burrito.  And also you have to try the white poblano sauce, it&#39;s spectacular.

right off the bat, it&#39;s very nice and inviting. service is walk-up, order, and grab a number-they bring your food out. the cashier was so nice! we told him that it was our first visit and he made great recommendations. he didn&#39;t just tell us 1 or two things that he liked, he asked us how hungry we were, what we were feeling, and made recommendations in every food category. I ordered a steak burrito and my wife ordered a mixed taco plate. they are very accommodating!  I asked if I could add tomatoes and he said of course and offered pico and rice with cilantro too!  

when you sit down, they bring out chips and salsa and are more than happy to bring you out other salsas to try too if you like a little more heat. the burrito was great!  my wife really liked the tacos, and said the al pastor was the best of the ones she tried. she also had carnitas and steak. the others were great but she liked the al pastor the best. the food was so fresh!  I didn&#39;t feel like I had a really heavy meal like Mexican food can make you feel sometimes. don&#39;t get me wrong, we got a lot if food and were very full, but we just didn&#39;t feel like we ate a big heavy dinner. we wrapped up our meal with some flan to-go and it was great. 

overall, a great experience, great food, and amazing value for the high-quality food we received. I am excited to try the salads and tortas in the future!"

I was with the fam so we decided to order a variety of items to see how things tasted.  We ordered one of the taco plates, a torta, and the carne asada.  The carnitas taco had a great flavor.  The ham and cheese torta was tasty (I know random, but the kiddies wanted it), bread wasn&#39;t too soft or too hard, ham wasn&#39;t too salty.  The carne asada was a good serving, I would have liked it to be a little less done.  The chips and salsa kept the kids happy until the food came.

It&#39;s definitely upscale, the food ranges from chipotle style burritos, which I had last time to carne asana, which I had this time.
The burrito I had was the al pastor.  It was a bit dry.  However it was well balanced between the meat, beans and rice more so than chipotle.  Also the price is a little better since you also get comped on the chips/salsa.  They gotta fix that dry meat problem.
Today I had the carne asada which is skirt steak: asked for med rare, got rare.  Not a big problem, better than over done.  Came with black beans, rice, pico de gallo and tortillas.  $15 is a bit much, probably worth $12-13 but it is what it is.  Flavor was excellent and I would get it again.
This place will be a winner if they correctly prep the meat fillings for the burrito/tacos and nail the steaks."

I dont regret getting the chilli paneer which was pretty good. The Paneer here is incredibly soft, like it was made on site which is rare and ironic for a south indian restaurant. My family loved the dosa so much they asked if they sell the batter separately. I had paneer makhani with some kind of paratha instead of naan. It was different, not horrible but more oil than I like to see in a makhani, really soft paneer which was great, gravy was good but had bay leaves and cloves  in it which is a southern thing.

I liked that their online ordering system, Beyond Menu, required selecting the heat level. I opted for Spicy and it was just right. Came with nice touches: fresh cilantro and sliced onion, hard-boiled egg, yogurt (use like sour cream to cool things down and add some creaminess at the same time), and some extra sauce. Meal was 10.95, and enough for two. I would order this again, and looking forward to trying their buffet (good way to try many of their dishes), which I was glad to see was still set up at when I was there though it was beyond the lunch rush."

The ambience wasn&#39;t particularly inviting. There was a very strong smell of non vegetarian food (fish specifically) as soon as we entered and the smell kept lingering in various proportions throughout our lunch experience as our vegetarian olfactory senses kept fighting it. 

The vegetarian options were very limited and taste-wise, forgettable. After filling our plates with the first round of entrees we waited for Naans.. and waited .. and waited some more.. They arrived after we started using the dosas (or mini uthapams) as substitutes for Naans and got half way thru our lunch. The waiter started avoiding the tables that were waiting or Naans and magically appeared only when they were ready. No apologies, no explanations!

The only things that were worth trying the mini uthapams and pakoras. Guess how I filled my stomach.

The deserts were very pale looking. The payasam was highly diluted and didn&#39;t taste anywhere closed to how it is supposed to. All in all, a very bad experience! Will not be back to Karaikudi."

The food which has Chettinad flavors from Southern parts of India was a very different experience for me having grown up on the rich North Indian food in India. But I just love the taste and flavors in the food which are so different yet so comforting(but that&#39;s also because I like hot and spicy food). It is a perfect meal especially on cool days. Whatever I have tasted so far has been extremely tasty. I would highly recommend anyone to try this place for the food than anything. It is a family run small and simple restaurant which has some great jewels on it&#39;s menu.  Recommended dishes for entree: VEG. KARA KUZHAMBU, KARAIKUDI CHICKEN, MUTTON SUKKA MASALA, ANY KOTHU PAROTTA, Appetizers: Gobi 65 or Chicken 65

P.S: they tend to not have some items on their menu many a times but understand they are a small restaurant and cannot keep changing their menus to highlight that. So please check with them before ordering if there are some dishes that are not available."

First the price of $12.95 was too high for a very mediocre choice of items. Secondly the food was not promptly replenished. The taste was OK. Rasam had too much tamarind to savor on its own. At same price there are lot of restaurants in the near by area with lot of choice and better taste. Not worth trying this place.

Veg dishes were as good as Non veg. If you visit or order please do order Kuttu paratha, it has both veg and chicken options. Lip smacking dishes..taste was just awsome. I would  definitely opt for a ordering catering option when i have  a chance.
We had many more options like Veg/Chicken biriyani, chicken curry, brinjol curry, kat mirchi. Yes The gobi manchurian was a hit too,

I don&#39;t have much knowledge about authentic Chettinad cuisine, however I found the food here to be pretty good and comparatively better than most south indian restaurants.

The rice dishes and curries were very well done and seemed healthier than regular restaurant food, however the Chutneys were very well done and add an extra zing to the palate.

I also found the catering really good value for what we paid for. We ended up with more food than needed, however the guests were happy to take home the remaining food. Some of the food showed up as lunch the next day in our office lunch room, which I took as a positive.

I haven&#39;t tried the sit-in restaurant and the non-vegetarian dishes yet, therefore the four stars. Will update and provide more details as I try them out."

I was so delighted to finally have a Chettinad eatery near home and wasted no time in getting there. 

Ambience - a small place which still seems to be struggling with publicity and demand. The restaurant was mostly empty at 7pm on a Saturday - doesnt bode well for the future. But otherwise the restaurant appearance and decor was clean and simple

Food - I ordered the goat biryani and chicken chettinad - was sorely disappointed. The food is nothing even remotely Chettinad - its Andhra cuisine at best. For instance, Chettinad biryani is never made from Basmati rice - this is mostly a northern selection. Tamil rice is mostly short grained Sona Masoori. Also the flavor penetration was similar to that of a Hyderabadi biryani - nothing like the Chettinad biryani where flavors run deep and throughout the biryani. The chicken chettinad was a pathetic imitation. The food was eatable and probably enjoyable if you didnt already know what to expect from Chettinad food - but I would recommend the restaurant get a genuine Chettinad chef. This doesnt even pass.

I may return but with much more timid expectations going forward"

I was in with my family, had the Tapiquena with cheese enchilada,  Chorizo taco, Tacquitos, and Enchilada dinner. EVERYTHING was delicious. Beans, Rice, Horchata was delicious. 

Fresh chips and Salsa, Green Chili and red tomato salsas. My mouth is watering thinking about it now. Mexican coke (real sugar) and Jarritos, ice cold. Also can&#39;s of coke, with glass of ice. I asked what Tamarind Jarrito tasted like, so the waiter shared his with me so I could try it.

I ordered carne asada tacos and al pastor tacos to go. Both types were delicious! They were piping hot of course because they were fresh. The meat was seasoned wonderfully, and their hot and mild salsas for the tacos had tons of flavor. The restaurant itself was decently sized and was clean.

The horchata is tasty, as are the burritos.  The inside is small and a bit cramped, but very clean.  It&#39;s definitely a tiny joint, but that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing.  

Everything just about is cooked to order, fresh and hot, and it&#39;s fantastic.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had anything bad here.  If you are hesitant and start with the burritos you won&#39;t go wrong.  A super large drink and one comes in under eight or nine bucks.  For a huge amount of food and drink, that&#39;s honestly the same price as fast food, and you get something far more delicious and fresh. 

If you&#39;re at Lewis and you&#39;ve never stopped by, skip the Taco Bell on Weber (blech) and head here.  You won&#39;t be sorry!"

One day I strolled in after they closed like an idiot but they let me in anyway, did not complain, and cooked our food and were ok about it, I still left early because I did not want to put them out of their way but they put no pressure on me at all.

Everyone enjoyed the food (my combo of filet mignon &amp; shrimp, onion soup, fried rice, seasoned veges &amp; a terrific ginger dipping sauce was flavorful &amp; cooked perfectly).

A very cool feature - the walls are lined with pics of guests all the way back to when they opened, in the 80&#39;s...oh the hair &amp; glasses!

I didn&#39;t rate 5 stars only because I&#39;m not a fan of carpet in a restaurant.

I will definitely come back again."

They sat us right away (we had a reservation). The waiter was attentive and friendly. The chef was fun and energetic which i was glad for. He paid special attention to my grandma which i was grateful for as i chose this place specifically because i thought it would keep her attention and be enjoyable for her.  She loved the show!

I almost always get the salmon teriyaki dinner ($16). The dinner includes a shrimp appetizer, soup, salad, vegetables, steamed rice and noodles. I like the fried rice (extra $1.50) and extra noodles ($3)---- so it can get pricey. The soup is just okay--- but the salad is amazing. I believe the ginger based salad dressing is made in house and the best I&#39;ve ever had. My other favorite thing here is their egg yolk sauce-- smooth, like butter except better. Don&#39;t be shy about asking for extra egg yolk sauce! It&#39;s supposedly goes over the shrimp appetizer but I ask them to smother my salmon as well (see pics under Cristina. F). 

Service is polite and efficient. The chefs are friendly/enthusiastic and are always a hit with my family/friends. This is our restaurant of choice for birthdays, graduations etc and the atmosphere is kid friendly. My little sister ordered her first Shirley Temple here, haha. 

They also have sushi on the menu-- which is okay-- I wouldn&#39;t go here for sushi. I guess we always order it in addition to our teriyaki entrees and it usually ends up being a mistake (read: too much food). 

I also recommend going during lunch for the great deals. Although, my only bad experience at Shogun was at lunch when they appeared understaffed so I guess ~you get what you pay for."

The lunch deals are pretty good for what you get. Usually during the lunch time the shows aren&#39;t as grand; but if you bring children with you the chefs will make the time to perform just so it&#39;s as grand as the dinner performances.

I&#39;ve read some of the reveiws complaining about portion sizes; and i&#39;ve never had a problem with that. I always end up with enough left overs for a complete lunch the next day.

You can taste the different flavors to the food between the cooks, but all the food is done great. I&#39;ve had hibachi from several local places (even the more expensive domo), and will always come back to shogun because they are truely the best."

I&#39;m a huge fan of another Japanese steakhouse where I used to live (in Florida), so it&#39;s going to be a tough feat to beat that one!  

Shogun&#39;s portions were smaller than I expected.  The interior is dated and I felt an little too close to the hot cook-top while I was seated.  The chef did a great job and was entertaining and the waitstaff were attentive and friendly.  Didn&#39;t get any dipping sauces.  Not sure if I&#39;d go back--there are a few others in the area I will try."

I have gone to this one alone for years and years and will continue to frequent it in the future. Although it is smaller compared to other hibachi places, I love it because it&#39;s not loud and it makes it more intimate and personal when I&#39;m with family and friends and I can actually hear them. The shows they do with the food are the typical hibachi shows, nothing special, but it&#39;s the people that work there that make it so great. They are so friendly and have always provided the best service. We used to come here for a friend&#39;s birthday every year and they always made it so special. They would bring her a free dessert and have everyone in the restaurant sing Happy Birthday. They would also take our picture with their Polaroid camera and post one picture on their wall at the front when you walk in and give one to us. They also signed the bottom which was really nice. You don&#39;t have to be a regular to receive this kind of treatment. They provide great service to anyone and everyone who walks through the door. The food is consistent and always delicious. They give just the right amount of food so you aren&#39;t overly stuffed or hungry for more. Sometimes hibachi places never get it right, but they hit the nail right on the head every time. If you are ever in the area, check it out. I can guarantee you will also become a regular like me!"

The portions seem MUCH smaller and when I leave here, I&#39;m never full like when I leave Domo and Japan 77. 

Their egg yolk topping is great but on several occasions we&#39;ve come and the soup before your meal is only broth with a few chives- nothing else. No mushroom, no onion, no tofu, no nothing. 

Also, I&#39;m pretty sure a pineapple dessert is supposed to come the lobster dinners but only once has it actually come to the table. 

On the plus side, they have coupons in the penny saver adds and the coupon books you get in the mail."

With that being said, the side dishes were sub-par, and the service was just insulting.  

I&#39;m a college student, and so I may not strike everyone as the type of person to tip well. However, I work hard and save my money to treat people I care about from time to time. This was one of those times. I called to make reservations, noting that it was my partner&#39;s birthday, to which the hostess graciously asked if I&#39;d like to do the &#34;Shogun Special, which costs, I think, like 5 or 10 dollars and we&#39;ll give her a pineapple dessert.&#34; Okay, I thought, why not embarrass her!  I give the hostess my name and time, and we&#39;re all set. Easy enough, if a little unprofessional.

As we walk into the restaurant, we&#39;re greeted by the management, who is very friendly. We walk up to the hostess, and I give her my name even though the restaurant isn&#39;t busy (in order to let them know the birthday girl is here!), but am waved off and smirked at by the younger waitress (my age) standing with the hostess behind the table.  Ok... 

We&#39;re seated with a family of 4, no problem at all, I understand at Hibachi that is what you do if you don&#39;t fill a table. The waitress takes our drink orders, and takes our orders, simple enough.

Soup comes out, and as a reviewer before says, it&#39;s quite bland with no onions or chives or tofu in it.. just a clear, bland broth with a couple noodles.  That&#39;s fine, I&#39;m not in the mood for miso as it is. 

Our salads come out with our appetizer, and sushi for the family across from us. The salad is a simple house dressing on top of iceberg lettuce with carrot strips spattered between.  The soft shell crab appetizer is quite delicious, crunchy and sitting on top of the same, not-so-great fake salad, the type you&#39;d get in an elementary cafeteria catered to children who don&#39;t care for the taste of vegetables. 

Here comes the next insult to me: the waitress goes to the family next to us, which is a mixed couple, and asks all of them if they would like chopsticks and refills. They say yes, and she hands them chopsticks, and walks off to refill their drinks. She looks at my date and me, and walks off. 

Our chef comes out, and is a very friendly guy named Andy. Andy does some really cool tricks, and cooks up our fried rice and shrimp appetizer that comes with all the dinners. They&#39;re good. The waitress comes back, and my date and I ask for chopsticks. I kid you not, she looks at me, sitting without my mommy, and asks, &#34;okay.. do you want like the kiddy ones? they&#39;re really easy to learn with.&#34; What. I keep my composure, and politely tell her that I think I can handle the normal ones.  Now, I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s Japanese hospitality at its finest, but I&#39;d appreciate being treated with some respect by a waitress, who happens to be working for a tip from me.  It&#39;d be one thing if she *forgot* to bring us fresh drinks throughout the night or to ask us if we&#39;d like chopsticks, but just because I&#39;m a fair skinned American doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m not competent enough to use chopsticks.

The rest of dinner proceeds.  Steaks are cooked just right, the lobster is seasoned superbly. The waitress brings out a pineapple dessert for the family, who was seated at the same time as us, and has the restaurant sing to the child. We were promptly brought our check without any recognition of my date&#39;s birthday.

I pride myself on tipping well. However, I reserve a generous tips for generous service, which I did not receive.  Come here for the main course, go somewhere else for the respect."

My family took me there when it first opened and most of the fox valley mall area was a corn field. It&#39;s really neat how the walls are covered with Polaroid pictures of former guests. Nice touch. If I had to recommend something off the menu it would be the steak and shrimp. If you decide to order the shrimp you MUST get the egg yoke on top. The flavor is through the roof. I&#39;ve tried all of these hibachi style restaurants in the area and this is by far the best tasting and most rewarding.

My boyfriend and all my friends always come here together. I&#39;ve celebrated everything here including my own birthday. But majority of the time I just come here whenever. I used to be a big fan of Benihana&#39;s until I discovered a cheaper version which was Domo 77 (also known as Japan 77 in Chicago). We all used to go to Domo 77 a lot. My newspaper staff was writing a review on Japanese steak houses and I wrote one on Kiku. One of my peers wrote about Shogun and I had never heard of it prior to the release of our paper.

I decided to try it out and was surprised. They are not only a lot cheaper than Benihana&#39;s, Domo 77 &amp; Kiku (I always pay around $13-18) They are also better!

Their french garlic is a lot better than any place I&#39;ve gone to. One of the chefs was even nice enough to tell me the recipe!

All the chefs have their different personalities, some are laid back and don&#39;t do much tricks while other spend a lot of time entertaining you.

This place is perfect for a group of just a date!"

Spending time with Family= Priceless
 
It was the heart of winter and I planned a quick visit to my family in the suburbs of Illinois. An excellent time to visit where the weather is extremely cold and the wind chill hits you sharply in the face. A great time where your face is so cold it burns until you are numb and where your toes are so frozen you can hardly move them. Yes. An excellent time to visit. 
 
Luckily, during this cold and blustery trip I was able to visit my aunt and uncle&#39;s restaurant. Located in Naperville (about 30 miles from Chicago) I was uber excited. Teppan style food is definitely the way to go in this freezing temperature. I&#39;ve had my share of Benihana&#39;s during my heyday, but Shogun is far from that. FAR. Better quality food, fresh ingredients, better service and most importantly delicious food. My favorites: the filet mignon, shrimp with egg yolk, and noodles (included in the dinner). 
 
An amazing time with family, great entertainment and great food! Who can go wrong with that? This is my favorite place to go when I&#39;m visiting the Midwest. The best place where I can see my family (literally) and a place for good eats. So, as I am back in Los Angeles, I droll as I write and only wish I can be back with my family soon. A wishful thought as I hope to see them again, because as we all know, spending time with family is.

We were really excited to get a babysitter and get out of the house.  We made reservations and showed usp on time.  As soon as we sat down they asked us to order before the other couple had even arrived!  Not 5 minutes later the other couple joined us and we placed a drink order.  The waitress then asked us to order again.  We informed her that we had only been inside the resteraunt 10 minutes and would like to start with sushi and then order dinner after.  They got us a sushi menu and asked us to order as soon as they handed it to us!  We asked for a minute... and thats exactly what they gave us.. a minute before they came back again and asked us to order.  We placed our sushi order and they demanded that we order our dinner at the same time.  We did, but told them we wanted the sushi to be our appetizer before the meal.  They did not care.  They brought us our soup before our sushi and started cooking our food at the same time.  We were bombarded with all our food at one time.  While we were still eating they asked us twice if we were done and needed a box.  They got us our bill immediatley and waited in front of us while we were looking it over.  They grabbed the bill as soon as we were done and came back immediately.  We had half a beer left (as we had no time to even enjoy one full drink during our dinner becasue they rushed us so much) and as we were trying to finish our drink the waitress told us that if we wanted to socialize and finish our drinks we needed to move to the waiting area so they could seat other guests!

My parents had found a really great teppan Japanese Steak House near them in St Charles - but the ownership changed... and unfortunately, so did the food.  It just wasn&#39;t quite as good, so my husband and I had really high hopes that Shogun would be a suitable replacement!

Lucky for us - it is definitely comparable!  It&#39;s definitely an old restaurant.  But, the decor is Polaroids of customers who shared their special occasion there!  We got to add a picture to the wall!  It is on the pricey side, so nice for a special night out.  The food was great, and the show was fun.  The chef was very entertaining, our kids loved most of it (the large fire ball to start the evening startled them both pretty good though.)

The noodle side was different than I&#39;ve had at other similar restaurants, usually fried rice is the standard, but it was good... and great for the kids!

Overall a really good experience - and we&#39;ll definitely go back!"
shogun-japanese-steak-house-naperville,Jason P.,dBwigbjjJUEgE-52Q7T8Qg,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,30,46,czPXpBg4bQHgOdlweBZ5uA,4.0,2009-11-11,"Three things keep this from being a 5 star review. 1) They only give you one sauce (a really tasty ginger sauce) with the meal, no matter what you order; 2) The decor is pretty tacky (wallpapered with faded Polaroids of past customers); and 3) The night we went (Saturday), they only had three chefs for the eight packed tables. 

We had reservations for 7pm on a Saturday night, and showed up about a quarter to. We were seated just about 7, which was fine, and then promptly brought our drinks and the soup course (pretty tasty). Before anyone had finished their soup, they brought out the salad (pretty bland). Upon finishing the soup and salad which had all arrived within 5 minutes of us being seated around the cooktop, we sat around for a while... almost 40 minutes worth of sitting. This night saw only three chefs rotating between the eight tables that, being a Saturday night, were packed with people (like us) watching the shows put on by those chefs at the other tables and wondering when it was going to be their turn. To be fair, there was a &#34;regular&#34; seated at our table who said it was the craziest he had ever seen it in there.

The routine performed by our chef was entertaining, but I have seen better. Coming more for the food though, I didn&#39;t really care about that, nor does that factor into my rating of this place. I ordered the steak and lobster, and was very pleased with that order. The chef overcooked both my steak and my wife&#39;s steak though (I ordered medium rare, she ordered medium well), but the lobster was done perfectly. As I mentioned above, we were offered only one sauce, the ginger, for all of our food. Now, I&#39;m no expert in the area, but I have been to three other teppan style restaurants, and at every other restaurant there were multiple sauces available (mustard based sauces, fruit based sauces, etc). Using the ginger sauce on everything (mushrooms, noodles, steak, shrimp, lobster) was a little like using ketchup at a steakhouse... I love ketchup, but certain situations call for certain condiments. 

Finally, the price was fairly reasonable. Less than $30 for my steak and lobster, and about $20 for my wife&#39;s steak and shrimp. We skipped the adult beverages this evening and ended up with a total bill, including tip, of about $70. 

I would definitely go back.

One more thing, sorry. People... leave your babies at home!!! Who the hell takes their babies to a restaurant where there is open flame and whirling knives less than three feet from your face? There were at least three or four high chairs scattered throughout this restaurant the night we went... if your kid is small enough to be in a high chair, they do not belong at a restaurant like this... come to think of it, they should be at home in bed! Come on, what kind of retard takes their toddler out to dinner after 7 at night to a place like this. They were still walking in when we were leaving at 8:30."

The restaurant is divided between a general waiting area/sushi bar, and the hibachi tables.  A little dark, and the carpet could stand to be replaced, but you don&#39;t eat off the carpet!  A neat thing is that posted all over the walls are pictures of previous guests that have celebrated birthdays, proms, anniversary&#39;s, and all other sorts of happy times there.  Some people might think its funky, but those people don&#39;t know how much the owners and staff truly enjoy being a part of your special moments, and how happy they are to cook for you.
My family has gone here too many times to count and I tell you we feel right at home.
The offerings isn&#39;t&#39; all that different from other options you may have been to, but the flavor and quality of meal is much better in my opinion.  Something that these guys have that most others do not is a stir-fried noodle course.  These are great and we typically order &#34;extra noodle&#34; along with fried rice when placing our table order.  Also we really enjoy the Garlic Shrimp, with its cripsy, garlicy, buttery breadcrumbs - MMmm.

Thank you, Tim H. for the great suggestion! This is a pretty good option for fast carry-out Chinese that is much better than the swill served up at the Panda Express down the road.

This is a relatively small establishment located in a strip plaza behind the Buona Beef.  Although mostly built to handle carry-out, (no delivery option as of yet) there are about five four-top tables for dine-in counter service guests.  The first thing you notice is how clean the place is.  The floors are clean, and there is a counter with a large carafe of tea and a cooler of water with cups lined up for both, and the kitchen is a relatively open area, so you can watch food being prepared if so inclined.  The kitchen is just a clean as the dining an waiting area.

We placed our order as walk-ins, but our food was ready in less than fifteen minutes.  We had wonton soup, pork fried rice, and a Mongolian beef dinner special (which came with fried rice and an egg roll.)  Prices are decent, and the orders were large portions, so it was a great value.  I have never met a wonton soup I didn&#39;t like, so that was fine here.  The rice was fresh, but I can&#39;t say I am a fan of the peas and carrots mix that was cooked in.  ( I guess it gave me a high school cafeteria kind of vibe.)  I had the remainder of the Mongolian beef special the next day, and it was definitely my favorite!  The sauce had a good spicy flavor, and it there was a perfect onion-to-beef ratio."

They refused to do anything at all claiming that they can&#39;t do anything because that&#39;s what the meal comes with. And if I wanted to change the lunch menu entree for a dinner instead, it would only come with white rice instead of fried and be $4 more expensive.

I must applaud the cook for using jumbo shrimp in their shrimp fried rice....almost all the places i&#39;ve gotten shrimp fried rice from had premature baby shrimp....yes PREMATURE baby shrimp...most places use these titty bitty annoying baby shrimp...you&#39;ll have to use a microscope to find one in a pile of rice..thats not that case at zen house......the shrimp here are built like chicken nuggets.....plump and juicy like Beyonce&#39;s thighs...

Another thing i noticed was that their fried had traces of scrambled eggs and mixed veges....it wasnt just bare fried rice loaded with soy sauce like the other places....its was decent.

i tried their kung pao and mongolian beef.....much more flavorful than the other places.....it didnt taste gooey and starchy....it didnt taste like straight up soy sauce....the sodium content was just right....the flavors were balanced enough....

SIMPLE 
BALANCED 
DECENT
PRICE APPROPRIATE


I like this place...no more china house and little china RUDENESS.....i live in romeoville but i&#39;ll rather drive to ZEN house...

GIVE IT A TRY...its not bad at all...i wish i could rate them 3.75 stars but i cant so a 4 star rating it is...."

You definitely get your money&#39;s worth with the lunch specials.  Food came exactly as ordered.  Quality of food was very good.  The only small complaint I might have was that it could have had more chicken.  There was plenty of rice and vegetables but the amount of chicken could have been better.  But for the price I am not going to complain.  The eggroll and crab rangoon that came with the special were both very good and not greasy at all.  Will definately be a regular here.

I got this menu delivered to my door and since I&#39;m new in the area, decided to give it a try.

It&#39;s pretty bad when a Chinese place messes up fried rice, but this was the saddest fried rice I&#39;ve ever seen.  Rice w/ soy sauce and a pea here and there, some really thin (looks like spaghetti!) strips of chicken....The crab rangoons were the smallest I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.

1: I wish they delivered, so so badly.
2: Be forewarned. If you get a dish spicy, prepare for spicy. My Vietnamese girlfriend dumps sriracha on everything like it&#39;s ketchup, and the spicy option on EAT24 had her in tears.

Those tears were also tears of joy, lol. Even though our noses were running, the heat had a lot of flavor. We kept going back bite after bite.

Was not that busy, 2 other tables of 4 but did see about 5 or 6 take outs come in. Our waitress was pretty good but did not seem that knowledgeable about the menu. Got the appetizer platter which was okay, and I know that crab rangoon is not a Thai thing, but was the best app on the platter. The app platter had several different sauces and what I would call &#34;little salads&#34; of cucumber and onion in different &#34;dressings&#34; Was tasty and fresh. 
We all eat family style, so we share all the dishes between us... we had the pad thai, which my wife thought was average, but I thought was 4 stars. The noodles seemed much smaller than I have had in the past. 
We also had panang curry with beef. The curry seemed much thicker that I am used to, but it was tasty. My son ordered the Thai sesame chicken.. not something I would order, but he liked it. Seemed like the chicken was tough.. not sure how chicken can be tough and chewy but it kinda was. We also had a vegetarian Thai fried rice. Was good, my vegetarian daughter liked it. 
Had leftover panang curry and fried rice... stirred it all up in a pan the next day... so damn good! 

Overall, the staff was super attentive... The  lady that came out with the waitress seemed to be the owner or the cook.. she was super cool and made sure we were taken care of. 
So overall.. was pretty good, but not outstanding, but one thing that really was a home run for me was the Tom Kha soup. I love that soup! and this version was outstanding!!! Will most likely go back for take out and get the soup and pad thai. 

Overall 4 stars.

Suggestions for 5 stars
Get a bus person on the staff. Table was kinda sticky and not very clean. 
The water glass I had seemed to not be that clean. Waitress poured warm water into my glass with little ice. I asked for more ice later and some lemon.. and was brought promptly. 
Train wait staff on the menu so they can explain the selections."

Lemongrass was completely underwhelming but Khao Suay is great in my book. In talking with the waitress they had to dial-back some of the heat on their dishes. So if that floats you&#39;re boat..and spice is you&#39;re game..talk with your server before ordering about the level.
I&#39;ve sampled about 35 different Thai places and this one rises to the top. Service has always been fantastic.
The Tom Kha (Coconut Lime Mushroom Soup) is simply to die for...with out without Chicken. Pad Sew Ewe... Great"

The cashier was very prompt and welcoming. Her friendly personality gave warmth to this cute establishment. Her patience was also something worth noting.

I ordered the tofu panang curry.  The texture of the tofu was just perfect.  There was no rubbery feeling to it.  The freshness of the ingredients was evident with every bite. The flavors were on point and I couldn&#39;t be any happier.

A hint of warning: we ordered both the noodles and rice at &#39;Hot&#39; level of spiciness and it was crazy.

It&#39;s good to know that there is a place that serves good Thai food close to my home.  Although the food was really good, there were a few small problems with the service.  We both ordered  the Thai Iced Coffee and though both of us ordered the medium, we were served our drinks in wildly differing glasses that seemed to be completely different in size to the naked eye.

The Finger Food is something not to be missed and is the perfect delightfully light and well balanced bite to start off a meal with.  Slightly acidic and just barely spicy  with a refreshing bit of cucumber it is the perfect palate clenser for a great meal. 

For my Entree I decided to go with the Pad Kee Mo.  Though it was quite a tasty dish I was slightly disappointed by the lack of spicyness.  When I see a little chili pepper next to what I select as a dish to eat I expect it to deliver a  bit of heat (especially in a Thai place).

When I looked it up and saw that it was down the street from my house, I was elated. After a week of  reading review after review, my steadfast dieting flew out the window. --I hadn&#39;t attempted Thai since I was served a gelatinous (jarred) mess at a downtown Naper Asian establishment last summer. I wasn&#39;t about to allow a little diet to stand in the way of at least a bite of massaman curry. Not when I &#39;d waited so long for a place like this.

I looked over the menu online and had a plan in mind for staying on track. However, I&#39;m afraid I wasn&#39;t the best date. I told him I was ordering the Tom Yum soup because it was clear broth. --fewer calories. I loved the soup. It didn&#39;t taste spicy at first sip (just sour), but created a nice steady burn at the back of the throat. My diet was still on track. But then his curry was placed in the middle of our tiny &#34;built for two&#34; table. No matter how much I stuffed myself with my clear broth, the curry just kept teasing me. I caved and ended up eating 1/2 of my soup and a 1/3 of his curry. On a cold night, and with so much time since I&#39;d had it last, it was like heroin for the soul. 

He also ordered green curry fried rice (my favorite). It had a nice curry subtlety with a peppery aftertaste. Would you think less of me if I admitted to eating it with a serving spoon? I didn&#39;t.... but I wanted to.  We&#39;ll just pretend it was carb and calorie free though.

I have a party to attend in 3 weeks and a leather skirt to wear, so no more Thai for me. Until then, I will longingly look at the menu and narrow down which items I will try next.  Only 21 more days."

Our server came over and asked if we were ready to order before we even had enough menus for everyone and before we were given water or had our drink order taken. We asked for another menu and a few minutes to decide. Eventually, I ordered the pad see ew lunch special. It came with a spring roll and cucumber salad which were ordinary but good. The pad see ew was pretty meh. It didn&#39;t have enough noodles or enough sauce. It was full of cabbage, which I don&#39;t recall being a key ingredient in the dish at all. But I&#39;m guessing cabbage is cheaper than noodles. I asked for hot sauce when my dish arrived but it never came.

Prices were a little bit high for the quality/quantity, but nothing crazy. (Yellow curry was $12 vs the $8-9 I&#39;ve come to find elsewhere). The big bummer was the service. Didn&#39;t get water for 10-15 minutes, and after waiting 25 minutes for the curry to come out, they gave us beef instead of tofu, so we sent it back. After about another 25-30 minutes we got our curry, which was delicious, but we were out of drinks etc and never got them refilled. After we were finished eating we waited another 15 minutes for our bill. This would have been pretty fine had it been a slammed dinner rush, but there were only 3 or 4 other customers in the entire restaurant. 

TLDR: Good food. Little pricey. Bad service."

It&#39;d been a long day to say the least so, admittedly, I was actually trying to get to McDonald&#39;s, but I missed the entrance. I turned into the Khao Suay Thai parking lot just to turn around, but the inside caught my eye. It was pretty packed in that tiny place and Thai food sounded a whole world better than whatever McDonald&#39;s would have churned out so I ventured in.

I didn&#39;t want to stay so I ordered take out. Look, I&#39;m a Thai noob, so I ordered the fish cakes and the Pad Thai with chicken. I know. Don&#39;t judge me. The (very friendly) server informed me it&#39;d be about 25 minutes so I went to the car &amp; took that time to finally call my mom back about scarves for winter or whatever.

25 minutes later I had a deliciously smelling plastic bag in hand. 10 minutes later I was home. 

Yo, the Pad Thai was amaze-balls. The sauce, the peanut crumbles, the perfectly cooked noodles, the fresh, crisp veggies... look, it was delish. And the fish cakes? Omg. Super crispy on the outside, almost creamy/tender/idek but an opposing texture that was yummy on the inside. And with just a touch of spice to kick it up.

This place is great. Check out the menu online, call in your order (or dine in, it looks super cute), and enjoy some pretty good Thai food. 

(Any suggestions on what I should order next would be super great!)"

At other restaurants we have leftovers but not here, the portion is just enough to satisfy. That may be viewed as a comment  on the value of the entrees as well. This is a fairly small dining room therefore they must charge enough per plate to cover the overhead and make a profit.

There are so many stellar reviews that I was ready to fall in love with what I had, but I honestly feel like it was good, not great. I ordered spring rolls and the red curry with beef, and it was pretty standard, as far as what I&#39;d expect. Spring rolls were nice and crisp, but pretty average, without anything exceptional going on. I liked the veggies in the curry, and the beef was the standard thinly sliced stuff without a ton of flavor. I will say that when I asked for spicy, I did get spicy, they&#39;re not afraid to amp it up when you ask. That was really nice. But at the end of the day, this struck me as just standard Thai food. Would I come back? Yes, absolutely, there&#39;s nothing bad going on. But I&#39;m not sure if it really distinguishes itself from any of the other Thai places I&#39;ve had in the area. Maybe it&#39;s unfair of me to expect epic 5 star Thai in Naperville...but I have to be true to my rating system and call this what it is. I&#39;ll probably be back, as I want to try a few more menu items - maybe I&#39;m just ordering the wrong thing?"

The food was decent and the price was fair. The portions seemed smaller than other Thai restaurants I&#39;d been to. The restaurant was clean; although, there was only a one stall bathroom that wasn&#39;t too stellar. We got a Thai iced tea, Vietnamese spring rolls, green curry, pad Thai, pad kee mao, pad see ew, pad woon sen, and sweet sticky rice with mango. The Thai iced tea was a little weak and the sweet stick rice with mango was a bit salty and out of season; however everything else was fine taste wise. The spicy level was also pretty accurate.

There were about a good 6-7 people at the front where all they were doing was chit chatting amongst each other.  I&#39;m guessing this is why it&#39;s slow in this particular Olive Garden.  You just get ignored. 

I decided to transfer to the bar and it&#39;s been five minutes and no one has greeted me still.  Amazing!  I wonder if their food is gonna be better than their attention span.  Out of five employees, two are working.  The other three are just standing talking or staring.  Yup!

Their saving grace was the person in charge of to go orders.  She was very organized and on point.  Her customer service was great and she was able to convince me to give her an awesome tip through her service.  

The other saving grace was the food.  I ordered chicken and shrimp carbonara, zoupa toscana, and grilled chicken flat bread.  Don&#39;t order the chicken flat bread to go.  It&#39;s not worth it.  It&#39;s cold by the time we got to it.  As for the carbonara, that was awesome!  The grilled taste of the shrimp was just to die for.  I was truly impressed that the food I ate came from that restaurant.  The cooks/chefs cooked this to perfection.  It wasn&#39;t salty, nor was a it overcooked.  The shrimp was at the right chewing texture, and the chicken was had great flavors to it.

I give the cooks 5 and overall customer service 1.  The person who gave me good service got a 5.  So, it&#39;s a 3."

I&#39;m not sure what it is about you that makes you so extraordinary, but you are the reason I had a delicious carb overload the other night. Thank you, and damn you.

Sincerely,

Sorry I&#39;m not sorry.

So yeah, this one time my hubbie was out of town for work and I was swamped with work myself. Grocery shopping was just not in the cards for a few days and I was craving some pasta on this chilly fall day. I remembered I had a Darden restaurant gift card, so I popped online to Olive Garden&#39;s website. Turns out you can order take out right online and it&#39;s super simple!

I definitely got a little carried away with my order, but I justified it by thinking it could be lunch/dinner for a few meals since I was avoiding taking the time to pick up groceries. With that being said, I ordered the spicy calamari, ($9.99), five cheese marinara dipping sauce for breadsticks ($3.49), braised beef &amp; tortellini ($15.49), and chicken &amp; gnocchi soup (which came with my meal). 

YEAH. Moral of the story, maybe don&#39;t make a carry out order when you&#39;re starving and stressed.

The website said my food would be ready in 45 minutes and it was there ready to go right when I arrived. The girl working take out orders up by the bar was super friendly and efficient. She double checked my order in front of me and made sure I had silverware and napkins. Here&#39;s the breakdown of my meal(s)...

Breadsticks: 5/5 - The main reason I will consider a meal at Olive Garden. I was given 3 breadsticks with the dip I ordered and another 4 with my meal. That&#39;s a lot.

Spicy calamari: 2/5 - Just enough spice. I wish the calamari was crunchier, it was a little too soggy for my liking. I did enjoy the two different sauces it came with though. FYI, not so great when re-heated.

Five cheese marinara dipping sauce: 5/5 - pretty straight forward, but cheesy and delicious. A great pair with the breadsticks.

Braised beef &amp; tortellini: 3/5 - the tortellini was awesome. They&#39;re huge and filled perfectly with asiago. The basil-marsala sauce and portobello mushrooms were good too, I just wish there was more of it. The slices of slow-braised beef were a little disappointing. I thought they would be more along the lines of meat that melted in your mouth along with the pasta, but they were just pieces of beef that seemed out of place.

Chicken &amp; gnocchi soup: 3/5 - Just okay. There wasn&#39;t much chicken, but the Italian dumplings and spinach were good. This soup wasn&#39;t as creamy as it should be though.

Everything reheated well as leftovers accept for the calamari, so maybe keep that in mind if you decide to go on a random Olive Garden binge like I did :)"

Very personable and attentive even though you can tell he was really busy.  The 4 stars is really because of the server :). Although don&#39;t get me wrong I actually love Olive Garden as a chain...probably the only one I really like.  The breadsticks and soups are very good and you can pretty much fill up on them and be full enough to just take your main entree home for leftovers.  The desserts are awesome...so good. My favs are zeppoli and the apple crostata.  The prices are just right and we usually don&#39;t have to wait in line too long.  I&#39;ve been to this particular Olive Garden soooo many times but for some reason this server really impressed me the most.  I really haven&#39;t had any complaints with the others but he is better.  Anyways giving 4 stars since I&#39;ve consistently had good food and it&#39;s about time I gave a review of this place.

Seems like this olive has a lot of young, unexperienced waiters and waitresses...hey, it&#39;s okay, you gotta start somewhere.

I know I know it&#39;s olive garden it&#39;s not a 5 star dining establishment. But really? Last time we went the waitress was so timid and had chewed off nailpolish which really freaked me out.

Other then that, the food is good. Meaning, If you are looking for a quick bite to eat before you shop until you drop, this is the kind of place."

The wait staff tries to earn larger tips by fawning all over their customers at the table, sometimes a little to much which is when it becomes annoying and causes me to leave a lower tip. Speaking of tips, Olive Garden is one of the restaurants that lists what a 10%, 15% ,20% tip is at the bottom of your bill. However, they are taking the entire price of the bill, INCLUDING SALES TAX, which we all know that YOU DON&#39;T TIP ON THE SALES TAX,, you TIP ONLY ON THE SUB-TOTAL OF THE BILL, before sales tax is added!"

Because of that, I&#39;ve discovered a couple of things on the menu that I like, and that I might actually crave if enough time passed: the mussels appetizer and the mushroom ravioli with the sun-dried tomato sauce.  The mussels are flavorful and usually cooked well, and I have to say--I think I might actually REALLY like the raviolis.

Otherwise, the pastas are bland and over-cooked, the sauces are bland and depthless, the soups are bland and boring, the salads are okay, the bread is decent, and the desserts are forgettable--literally, because I actually can&#39;t remember even one.  Thankfully, I&#39;ve found a couple of things that I enjoy, and I should also mention that my experience with the service here, so far, has been very good; a couple of times the service was a little slow, but it usually isn&#39;t, and it&#39;s always been friendly.  I feel, though, that I have to give two stars--and not three--because on the whole, the food there is pretty bad.

A few new dining options, including a small plates/Tapas section, are a much welcome addition to a typically ho-hum menu.  Our server was good, and when he asked if I wanted cheese on my food, I told him to &#39;cheese it up, my good sir.&#39;  My date gave me a look because he was putting cheese on an already-cheesy pasta dish, but I countered her disapproving stare with &#34;yo dawg, I heard you like cheese, so we put cheese on yo cheese&#34;.  Our sharp waiter picked up on the Xzibit meme, so kudos to him.

My Tour of Italy was good as per usual.  The salad didn&#39;t have any pepperoncini (those midsized green sport peppers), which are my favorite part of the whole damn thing.  It was nearing closing time @9:45pm so I didn&#39;t press for any dessert, but I know for a fact that their mini dolcini are both adorable and delicious.  Another solid outing at The OG."

Food is typical, mediocre Olive Garden fare. I recently went in after the construction on this building was complete. On a cold winter day, the soup, salad &amp; breadsticks lunch completely hit the spot.

There are definitely a ton of little kids which are usually crying or screaming or throwing food. 

I had remembered that the Italian Sodas (or French if you prefer like me) were delicious on a visit over this past summer. This last visit they handed me an Italian Soda with - maybe - one squirt of cherry syrup. It was basically colored soda water. *Sad Face* The waitress did correct this for me which was very much appreciated.

Overall, if there is a wait time, I will skip this place. Totally not worth the long wait times. But every now and then it&#39;s a good place to stop."

The only thing I found odd was the fact that the dining room was practically empty when we arrived and they told us the wait was about 15 minutes, maybe less- we were the only family in the wait area.  We took a seat and then a minute later they called my name like the wait area was crowded. They could have been going through a shift change, but it was just one of those moments that leave you confused without an explanation. It didn&#39;t bother us, we just found it a little funny. 

Our server was fantastic (I think her name was Lexi?!) and patient (we had our children with us) and  answered our questions about menu items knowledgeably.   The children&#39;s menu was good. My son liked building his own meal and the stickers and crayons kept my toddler busy. The bread sticks and drinks were continuously refilled and we didn&#39;t have to ask for anything. The food was delicious and overall the price wasn&#39;t as high as we were expecting for the four of us. Our dining experience was very pleasant.

We went and sat at the bar top. Which only has about 12 seats. A group of 4 girls had just gave the bartender their drink order as they waited for their table in the diningroom. Understanding the bartender was busy with that, we waited. Time went on, they got their drinks and the bartender proceeded to play with his closed out reciepts. He made eye contact with us, but proceeded to ask other at the bar if they needed anything. Not once did he say Hi, I&#39;ll be with you in a moment, NOTHING! Finally after 15 mins my husband said something to the bar back asking if we could get service. Hunter the bar back seemed nervous but helped us, even though it&#39;s not his job title. He was Great! Took great care of us for the rest of our evening. The &#34;Bartender&#34; if that&#39;s what you call this type of professional, never once looked or spoke to us. Although every other person who came to the bar top was greeted and acknowledged within moments. Even though we did recieve a glass of wine and appitizer on the house. Never once did the manager Jackie come by to apologize or make sure everything was ok. What a shame. 

Keep in mind I do work for a upscale restaurant in downtown Naperville. I understand the does and don&#39;t of the customer satisfaction &#34;guidelines&#34;. 
I understand busy times and I understand being overwhelmed. But what I do not understand is when a customer is nonexistent. He was more worried about closing out his previous reciepts and getting his tips, other then simply saying, &#34;I&#39;ll be with you in a moment!&#34; 

For &#34;this Bartender&#34;  and his actions. We will not return to this location and we will tell everyone we know our experience with him!

With each of the last 3 visits, the first thing we&#39;ve noticed is that the restaurant is really cold and uncomfortable. Wherever we sit, even far from the doors, there seem to be cold breezes which worsen throughout the meal. 

Heating, or lack there of, aside, our family seems to have a target for slow service, cold food, or incorrect food. We have had three different servers and I don&#39;t know if they are overworked or just really slow but we do not feel well taken care of. Although a server can&#39;t help a slow kitchen, it is very obvious that something is wrong when the server completely disappears from the floor and is nowhere to be seen for anything, including  the bill, drink refills, or orders to be placed. 

The first of our bad three visits included an over 30 minute wait for our food after we had received our soup/salads. When our food finally arrived, one of us received the wrong thing. The replacement amazingly only took a few minutes to arrive. The second visit netted one of us the wrong thing (spaghetti instead of cavatappi) and the spaghetti was soggy it was so overcooked. Our latest (and last) visit began with cold hot chocolate for two members of the group and ended with stone cold pasta for another member. The appetizers were tasty but pretty cold. With last night&#39;s meal, our server was gone for long periods of time and was quick to blame anyone but herself for the cold items. 

Each time, the kitchen was blamed, but when the food arrives completely cold, this seems more of a service issue than a kitchen issue. Also, the fact that the servers disappear for ages at a time is not a kitchen issue. When servers were aware of our dissatisfaction, we were offered free desserts but the manager never once approached us. I&#39;m not sure if management has changed recently, but the service we receive has definitely declined. Olive Garden was once decent place to eat for the money but is now a complete let down."

We were made to use the computer to pay, and if you choose to leave a tip, the lowest you can leave is 20%. The waitress didn&#39;t earn a 20% tip, but we didn&#39;t want to totally stiff her.

First, the &#34;unlimited&#34; food is served in a rather limited fashion.  My friend and I finished our first bowl of soup quickly and had to wait for our server to ask for a second bowl.  The soup, chicken &amp; gnocchi, barely had either of those ingredients in it.  It was mostly broth and shredded veggies.  The salad was fine, typical Olive Garden salad.  The breadsticks were hard (how is that possible before noon?), and we had to ask for more breadsticks.  You&#39;re running a lunch special, but the bread isn&#39;t fresh?  That&#39;s a red flag to me.

Our server was really slow on refilling our drinks.  I again had to ASK for a refill when my glass was noticeably empty.  He was friendly, but either didn&#39;t notice or ignored our need for more items.

I stopped going here years ago for pasta.  But now I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll go back for their soup, salad &amp; breadstick special either.  It took more than an hour to be served and I started to feel like a cow because I had to keep asking for things."

Needless to say, I didn&#39;t offer a tip.  Didn&#39;t their mothers ever tell them it&#39;s gauche to ask for money??

I arrived home 10 minutes later and the FOOD WAS COLD, STONE COLD.  I will never go back to that restaurant again, I&#39;ll spend an extra few minutes and try the one in Oswego.

An additional note:  for a restaurant with such a large population of older people, their driveway and parking was a mess -- full of ruts.  They could spend a few dollars and put salt out and then have it plowed.  Please!  We do it for our driveways, they could do it for theirs."

The ambiance is romantic, but not to the point where is not &#34;kid friendly&#34; like some fancy restaurants. You can&#39;t go wrong with the delicious and salad and bread sticks but my weakness as well as others is filling up to much on that. 

Ask for lunch portion sizes (although you can&#39;t get away with everything on the menu with that). Everything is delicious and cooked well on the menu!  I don&#39;t think they do reservations (which is not cool) so you will expect a long wait on a weekend night. The service is good, I feel like the servers know the menu well. They are very busy, so you probably won&#39;t always get the warmth you want. 

Going around at 5 for an early dinner is your best bet! It packs up fast after that. Also, Italian Garden beats Carrabbas and that other Italian Restaurant (next to Meijers) on Route 59."

Today, however, there was no wait time for a table (just for two people). Service was prompt and courteous by a bright, cheerful and attentive server named Kristina. It appears that the management has cleaned up their act since a less than positive experience two summers ago. This seems to be a very high traffic location ostensibly due its location on Route 59 near the myriad shopping venues.

I ordered a dish that did not include pasta and it was fine. The endless salad was welcome.

The place has been remodeled in the past year and one can still smell the paint.  It does look better. It does not look like they were able to do much to the men&#39;s bathroom. It has a goofy layout, but works. To do it well, they should tear the place down and put a new facility, like the one in Bolingbrook.

For me, Olive Garden is certainly not a first choice for dinner, but if you&#39;re looking for lunch above a fast food level experience, on the go, then it&#39;s fine. It can work for office get togethers, such as when someone is moving on, etc. However, I doubt that anyone with a thoughtful heart seriously plans Nonna Livia&#39;s 90th birthday celebration there.

So, give it a go.  They even have some gluten-free selections."

Olive Garden is like part of the fabric of Midwest Suburbia. Anyway, I hadn&#39;t been here since um.. elementary school, but my mom got a giftcard from work, so here we were. As I braced myself for another suburban chain restaurant with packaged crayons.. and yes, plastic grapes hanging from the ceiling (I&#39;m not sure who decided this would make it look classier??), I pretty much got what I expected.

Stuffed mushrooms swimming in butter and standard pasta dishes I could have made at home. The tortelloni with braised beef and portobello with a basil marsala sauce was not bad. And the &#34;side salad&#34; that comes with your meal is just HUGE. Also, I actually really like the marinara dip that comes with the calamari.

My husband and I went in for lunch around noon.  We were seated right away, and that was a big plus.  Our waitress (shoutout to Dana!!) came right away and discussed the drink specials.  She took our drink orders, and then asked us if we were on any kind of time constraint.  This was a big plus in my book because my husband DID need to get back to the office since he was only on his lunch break.  I though that was really thoughtful.

We ordered appetizer when you choose three from the list: We got the ravioli, calamari, and fried zucchini.  They came out fast, piping hot and delicious.  I ordered the Venetian Chicken w/ the pasta e fagioli soup, and my husband got the lasagna rollata w/ minestrone.  

Dana was really good about our breadstick and soup refills (woohoo!) and was really on top of the timing of when things came out and asking us if we were ready for certain courses or if we were ready for our soup--it was a nice change from other experiences at other restaurants I&#39;ve had where they just put in orders and bring them out whenever THEY feel like it.  We also ordered the apple crostada which was really good!

The hostess and waitress were both fantastic. My legs were having a particularly painful day, and the hostess offered to seat us closer to the door, and asked if we&#39;d like a booth so I could elevate my legs. The waitress made suggestions and anticipated our needs. 

We split an appetizer of the Smoked Mozzarella Fonduta with little toasted Tuscan bread slices. REALLY good. I could&#39;ve had a 2nd order. Salty, creamy, yum.

The big bowl of salad that you split when you order salad with your meal? Less than half-full. Not that we could even finish it. But I was still surprised. Maybe they&#39;re cutting costs? Would&#39;ve liked to see the prices reflect that, if so.

I had the new Four Cheese Sacchetti with Chicken. The 2 chicken breasts were average, not bad, but nothing special. The pasta was kinda dry, wish it&#39;d had more sauce on it. Tasty, otherwise.  My boyfriend had the Chicken Scampi and said he really liked it.  

No room for dessert, though I was happy to see they now have the option of the mini-desserts now.  Will have to go back and try some of the desserts!"

I knew more or less what to expect, but I still came because I had a gift card.

The food and setup is pretty standard - soup or salad comes with every entree.  The problem is that our waiter didn&#39;t bring a spoon for the soup or a bowl for the salad apart from the serving bowl.  He also didn&#39;t offer cheese to go with it.  By the time my wife had flagged the waiter down (he was hard to find) and gotten a spoon for the soup, the entrees were already there - and suspiciously fast.  I&#39;m not sure how they could have reheated the food so quickly.  The food was kind of floury/salty, and the waiter was &#34;creepy.&#34;  With that said, if I end up with another gift card, I will go back.  It can be worth the price - if it&#39;s subsidized."

Two and a half hours after we got there, our entrees arrived.  Well some of them.

We arrived and there were a few people there, which surprised me for a late Monday morning. Our server was very friendly.

Due to all the reviews I read about the portions being so huge, the hubby and I decided to share a skillet. The server was so kind to have the chef cook and split everything for us and we didn&#39;t even request it. We ordered the veggie skillet. My hubs felt it needed more veggies. The flavor was good the hash browns were terrific and they were my favorite part. The veggies were good as well as the eggs. We also each got a slice of cantaloupe and it was great.

We got pancakes for the side. The pancakes were delicious, light and fluffy. I didn&#39;t like the syrup though, the flavor tasted different.

I ordered the Nutella crepes, per our servers recommendation, they were topped with strawberries, bananas and whip cream and a tiny drizzle of Nutella. The crepes were a bit eggy tasting for me but the fruit was good. I do wish they put more Nutella as it was very scarse and the flavor did not shine through. 

Overall the food was decent, the prices were great, the service was excellnt. Was it the big hype everyone made it out to be? Not really. I didn&#39;t find anything about it to stand out above and beyond your typical breakfast place."

The restaurant is your typical breakfast place with booths and tables and a counter across the back of the restaurant.  The decor needs updating...it&#39;s outdated.  The menu has a lot of choices and so many different combos for skillets and omelettes.  My husband had the Eggs Benedict and I had the Health Nut omelette, which was an egg white omelette with turkey bacon, avocado, green onions and low-fat cheese served with salsa.  We both thought our food was good and portion size was generous.  Our server Jess was attentive and friendly.  She offered soup to go, which I think is the restaurant&#39;s practice.  Very nice touch.  I used the women&#39;s restroom before I left the restaurant, and it was not in the best shape..the floor was dirty and the wastebasket too full.  Nothing turns me off than a dirty bathroom.  However, the food and service was good and I would definitely go back."

The service, and the food, are always phenomenal. The owner, Niko, can be seen greeting guests, and ensuring that everyone is having the best experience possible. That is not something you see very often!

Free cantaloupe with every entree is a nice touch, and they will also sometimes give you a free bagged up soup to go! Every visit here is an amazing value. 

This place can sometimes be packed on the weekend, but that is a good problem to have in the restaurant business. We have never waited more than 10 minutes for a table, and service is always expedient. 

My wife and I will continue visiting this location until the day we pass from this earth (or until we move away!)

nikos-breakfast-club-romeoville,Angela P.,3lUkFxUQKeMUYH7-z_kmjg,"Aurora, IL",1,1,1,400,9,-Ld42SoLW3YpUPu_Xdfe6Q,3.0,2015-05-09,"Niko&#39;s is a small diner with lots of potential.  By potential, I&#39;d like to point out that hanging PAPER PLATES from the light fixtures, even if they are 4th of July themed, is grossly tacky.  Not to mention, it&#39;s early May.  But hey, if the food is fantastic, you go ahead and dangle whatever you want from the ceiling!

The best thing about Niko&#39;s is that they serve an inexpensive breakfast &amp; lunch menu.  I think all of the entrees were less than $10, and the portions are huge.  Don&#39;t be disillusioned - large portions don&#39;t make up for the fact that the food isn&#39;t great.  It&#39;s mediocre in many ways and not at all the 4.5 star rating that is reflected on Yelp.

I had the Monte Cristo, which was good, but could have been better if the French toast wasn&#39;t soggy.  I regretted not ordering the strawberry crepes, but if I had ordered those, would I have regretted not ordering the sandwich?  The sandwich was served with a mound of fries and a bowl of chicken noodle soup.  The soup was VERY salty.  My husband said his breakfast was good though.  Niko&#39;s could be better if they focused more on the quality of the food and less on the delivery of portion size.  

SIGH.  

&#39;MERICA.

The service was terrible.  So many reviews mention the owner, presumably Niko, walking around and greeting people.  Our SERVER didn&#39;t stop to say hello or take a proper drink order.  She stood at the next table and hollered, &#34;coffee?&#34; over her shoulder.  She served my husband a cup of coffee but didn&#39;t stop to ask what I wanted to drink.  They didn&#39;t stop to drop off water at the table either - which she later blamed on the bus boy but never acknowledged her own errors. 

When she returned with my husband&#39;s coffee, she quickly walked away.  When she came back to take our food order, I also asked for an iced tea.  She forgot my drink again when she delivered our food.  There wasn&#39;t even a quick &#34;sorry!&#34; to acknowledge us.  Not surprisingly, she dragged her feet with refills and didn&#39;t bother adding any ice to my ICED tea.

It wasn&#39;t busy when we arrived, we were seated immediately when we walked in, so this server appeared to buckle under no pressure at all.

The food and the price is the selling point here, so an A-OK 3 stars it is.  The service really needs improvement though.  I might go back to try those strawberry crepes or bananas foster waffles, but you&#39;re more likely to spot me and my pocketbook at a place I haven&#39;t tried yet before duplicating efforts at Niko&#39;s again."

However, this morning my food contained a little packet of whipped butter where someone removed the lid and then replaced it with clear tape, and then put the lid back over it.

That&#39;s my order and everything about it is perfect.  Do this and you essentially end up with a corned beef hash breakfast.  The strawberry OJ is great as well.   I go to this place all the time for breakfast, so why might you ask does it only get four stars?  The owner can be rather intense if it&#39;s crowded.  It&#39;s just common sense to express your anger out of the view of the public but come in here for breakfast on a weekend and he&#39;s bound to erupt on some poor waitress.

There are plenty of options on the menu and everything is of pretty good quality for breakfast. Part of me wishes this was a 24 hour denny&#39;s type of diner so I can enjoy some higher quality late night eats that this neighborhood needs."

I am there at least 3 or more times a week. I have never been disappointed with anything......the food and the staff are excellent. But it would seem someone named Vaughan J ( who is a women if you read some prior posts at other locations) has some issues with Niko&#39;s???? I have seen both Niko and his staff make &#34;things&#34; right with any customer who has food or service issues. Let&#39;s face it some people are very demanding and expect things to be perfect. Any business has issues beyond their control.
People calling in sick , unexpected crowds ( a good thing in the restaurant business) and demanding customers who would rather write a bad review on Yelp than talk with someone to make things right. I find Vaughan J&#39;s recent review on Niko&#39;s comical and totally incorrect. My advice to people who use Yelp to find a restaurant is.....go to Niko&#39;s Breakfast Club in Romeoville and you&#39;ll be happy you made the trip!"

This is my second weekend coming here as the first experience was really enjoyable I decided to come here again today. Niko was here greeting last Sunday, I observed him visit every table to ask how they enjoyed everything. Had I decided to review after the initial visit, i would have rated at minimum 4 stars being the wait was 20 minutes and the waiting area is very small, we were nearly touching and I&#39;m one for personal space. Now fast-forward to my visit this afternoon. I decided to take my mom for lunch it&#39;s just after 1pm and the place is not crowded, we were immediately seated mind you I&#39;m happy about this. I ordered the same thing I had last week. After a quick glance I took note that Niko was nowhere to be seen and with that my visit was pretty much the opposite of last weekend, granted I will likely not return. Thinking to myself is it when the &#34;boss&#34; is away the service is piss poor. I asked for a straw twice, mistakes happen I get it. I asked for no pork in my omelette and was served an omelette with ham, mistakes happen I get it. I returned the plate to the waitress and started eating my pancakes which were pretty good. Maybe I should have just ate those, paid, and left. Upon the rest of my food being served (again) I started eating my food and I was drawn to the heat of hot pepper on my tongue however nothing I ate should&#39;ve had pepper (omelette and hashbrowns).  I begin to examine the food and plate. Thinking to myself where did this heat come from as my mouth is literally on fire. I noticed there was food stuck to the side of plate, I wondered if the plate was in fact just not cleaned prior to the food being plated. Hopefully that wasn&#39;t the case but I sincerely wanted to located this heat that was burning my tongue. I spoke with the waitress about it and she stated the cook probably had my food too close to something else that was being cooked on the grill...mistakes happen but the restaurant was not crowded not even half full. I gave her my plate because at this point I couldn&#39;t eat anything else. Upon checking out, when asked how&#39;d I enjoy everything I informed the lady of what happened (mind you my mouth is still on fire) and she said I should have told them to fix it over. As I paid the bill I thought to myself...I should have waited a third time? Craziness. I decided to get this review over with while sitting in the parking lot. My tongue is still burning as I am not a fan of anything that hot especially when it&#39;s unexpected. My mom didn&#39;t finish her food, she said the bacon was salty and decided against a to go box. So much for our lunch outing prior to Mother&#39;s Day!"

I recently received their Clipper magazine promo in the mail which sparked my interest. Apparently they have been open for 5 years with a second location in Oaklawn.

I was greeted by the owner (Niko) immediately upon entering. He is sort of a funny guy calling everyone &#34;maestro&#34;. My server was a friendly gal quick on the coffee refills and also had a humorous side to her which was much appreciated. 

I ordered the Black &amp; Bleu Burger served with mushrooms, bacon and bleu cheese on a toasted bun. It was cooked just the way I requested (medium) served with a side of skin on fries. The side garnish was lettuce, tomato and onions as well as fruit. To be honest it was plentiful and includes your choice of soup or salad. All this for only $7.99.

Don&#39;t let their location in a strip mall fool you. They have quite the extensive menu ranging from fresh squeezed Strawberry-Orange Juice...YEAH I SAID IT...strawberry orange juice. As I glanced around the room I noticed omelettes, frittatas, scramblers, crepes, waffles, quesadillas, chopped salads and wraps. Lots going on here.

I will definitely be back to give their breakfast a try since that is what they are known for.

We&#39;ve been going to crispy waffle since we moved in last year to the Joliet area. It was okay for our breakfast once a week, but I wanted to try something new so I looked up so breakfast joints in the area and this had the best reviews. After visiting I understand why. This place is better, for so many reasons. First the wait staff here is super friendly and attentive.  Second the food is much better, and the portions are bigger. I think pricing is about the same, but you automatically get fresh fruit with your breakfast a Nikos included in the price. I&#39;m always ordering a side of fruit so that is a huge plus for me. The decor is like being at your grandma&#39;s house in the 80&#39;s. So many chickens! It&#39;s amusing to me though. I always notice something different. I think a modern upgrade to the decor would be nice, but I&#39;m not there for the scenery. The food is always great, the place is clean and the servers do a wonderful job. This is our new go-to place for breakfast."

Contrary to the pics posted online, this place is not as spacious as it seems. Everything about this place is BARE BONES and BLAND..the interior is bland and bare. The food is generic and bland. Tastes like grocery store pre-made food thrown together. Something is up with their eggs or their oil...This time, i ordered the meat lovers omelette called the &#34;Hungarian&#34; and it tasted ok....you would think that the flavors from the pieces of meat will enhance the omelette but that wasn&#39;t the case...i honestly could have made an omelette like that with MY EYES CLOSED in the comfort of my home....The pancakes were bare and far from enriched....tastes exactly like generic store brand pancake mix..no enhancements by the chef....they could have at least added some cinnamon, vanilla extract, or nutmeg to add some dimension to the pancakes...that wasnt the case either....if you have functional taste buds then this place will not WOW you....this is a small town mom and pop joint....you are better off going to ihop, dennys, or even tasty waffle which is 5 mins away....THAT skinny brunette cougar at the cash register needs to humble herself...."

Not just any potato pancakes either - they have to be the authentic made from grated till your knuckles bleed potatoes and then fried just right and serve them with applesauce and sour cream.  In my youth, I ate them at Al&#39;s Deli in Homewood, rip, and have been on a Grail like search for a new source ever since.

Imagine my delight when I happened upon a new spot for breakfast and my eyes fell upon The German Breakfast with, you guessed it, potato pancakes.  Ach du lieber, I was hoping for some liederhosen level of lip-smacking potato pancakes.

They arrived and the surface looked smooth, not a good sign.  It usually means they&#39;re made a mix or mashed potatoes.  I closed my eyes and tasted them and no yodels of delight, these were your disappointing, easy to find mediocre potato pancakes.  Sigh.

The eggs were fine, the English muffin was pre-buttered, which I hate when they assume that, but the bacon and orange juice were really good.  The man bussing the tables was a delight, super polite with a twinkle in his eye who seemed to genuinely like his job and his life.

As I left the waitress who took my check was complaining that she had to  perform cashiering duties plus her own job.  Not a great way to end my first visit there.

One day, one day I shall find my potato pancakes in the south suburbs and I&#39;ll never go hungry again!"

Con&#39;s - Not really a con, but the reality is that the dining area is very small.  The place is so popular that it can feel a little overwhelming when you walk in for the first time.  Your best bet is to phone in your order, arrive 15 minutes later, and walk in and walk out."

The cashier was nice and took my order correctly. I paid nearly $30 for just two three taco dinners and a half side of guac and chips. My order was to go and they did not provide utensils and napkins - I had to run back inside to fetch. I wouldn&#39;t be complaining about pricing if the food was actually edible. Here&#39;s a run down on the meal. 

* Tacos - dry tasteless corn tortillas, no authentic Mexican flavors

* Rice - just orangey rice, no authentic Mexican flavors

* Beans - just beans, no authentic Mexican flavors

* Guac - just mushed avocado, again ZERO authentic Mexican flavor 

This was a very underwhelming meal. I will not make an effort to return to determine if I received that one bad meal or not - mainly because of price and the extra effort needed to exit the parking lot."

The grease must have been airborne and adhered to our skin causing us to shine in the light.  It&#39;s a small price to pay for delicious food.  $2.49 for a taco, which is a little pricey.  You can have then in American style (with montery jack cheese, lettuce and tomato) or Mexican style (with onion and cilantro).  Besides tacos, they have the usual Mexican fare such as quesadillas, fajitas, burritos, enchiladas and tostada.  In addition, they offer  burgers and fries.  You can also get a large order of freshly made guacamole and chips for $8.  The $2 pina colada is mainly just pineapple juice and it&#39;s very sweet.

This was my first stop here and it impressed. When I drove up there were no cars in the parking lot and my first thought was damn another very well review place that shut down. Not so with this place. I spied the open sign and parked. 

The sit down portion is small maybe a dozen tables. The stars here are the food and service! I was greeted very warmly. I decided on the three taco (chicken) meal. $12 with a drink. Not bad considering. Well before I could sit a gentleman was bringing out warm salsa and chips! I could see the heat rising off of the chips and salsa. I thought sweet I love warm chips and salsa. BTW they were fantastic! I would go back and just eat chips and salsa if I could. Before I had down half a dozen chips my food was out and in front of me. See attached pic. I was amazed at the speed. Plus it looked damn good. Let me say I tried both sauces the green and red. Neither were overly hot both added to the meal and experience rather than sending me running for cold milk to put the fire out.

Over all the place is great. If your lucky enough to be close stop by and give them a try. They are close to me so if you see me say hello. I&#39;m sure by then I will have tried everything and be able to make suggestions."

My husband ordered his standard carne asada and said it was the best he&#39;s ever had. And he&#39;s done extensive research.

So not knowing we did and sat down. We asked the waitress for napkins and eating utensils she&#39;s like &#34;oh you&#39;re dining in, your order is getting prepped for take out 
*Rice has no flavor
*Enchiladas de Mole (NOT MOLE) plain red sauce(no flavor)
*Tacos are basic 
*Place was filled with smoke from the cooks. Our eyes were very irritated and couldn&#39;t eat comfortably. The place had no ventilation. Finally the waitress opened both doors to get some air.

I definitely do NOT recommend this place. Besides if the food is no flavor to basic imagine by the time you take it home to eat. Thumbs down!"

Black beans may not be authentic, but they sure are hard to come by at these tiny tacquerias.  Nevermind, Taco Madre has black beans, and they&#39;re served in crispy little tostada bowls!

The Al Pastor is sweeter than my other favorites in the area, but it&#39;s still fantastic!  Unlimited chips and salsa, including their suburb green/avocado sauce, and unlimited horchata sealed the deal for me.

The counter service is friendly, and there&#39;s plenty of seating.  They refilled our chips several times without us even having to ask.  Although Taco Madre is a little off the grid for me, it&#39;s still local and full of flavor."

 I would say they&#39;re more than just a take out place since there&#39;s few tables available to sit on and I was able to fit my family of 6 including myself and a car seat. It was still busy even on a Sunday late lunch. They have a lot more to offer than just their tacos, including Mexican favorites like enchiladas, burritos, rice and beans breakfast plates,  parilladas (grilled) offerings, sizzling plates, etc.

But I got my appetite set on tacos. So they do start off with warm salsa and chips (we got 3 refills), that&#39;s a plus for a hungry mob like my family. We ordered for Nachos Supreme for starters. This may sound funny but I would still pick Denny&#39;s version since the ground beef is too bland for my taste, what actually brought this dish to the ok level are the pickled jalapenos, mayo, and guac.

But the next round bumped this whole dining experience from ok to great! I got the taco al pastor, the marinade of spicy + sweet flavors married to the very tender meat, soooo good! I also ordered for the lengua (beef tongue) if you&#39;re a little adventurous. It does taste better than what it sounds and flavors of tiny pieces of steak is what it really taste like. This is common to tacquerias at least on my experience. Then we had the mahi-mahi tacos with whole slices of avocados and the red mayo dressing, wife loved it instantly. I&#39;m also impressed with how everything was presented on white rectangular flight plates, even the beans are on a small taco bowl, I bet the lemon wedges was also artistically placed. It felt like that our orders came out from a high end resto&#39;s kitchen. That really added the extra oomph to the presentation. They also have great service. The server was polite and prompt with our orders. The Manager even came over to check on how we&#39;re doing. I&#39;m a fan already and would definitely recommend if you&#39;re near the west burbs (Montgomery/Aurora area)."

We went camping in the Sugar Grove area on a weekend, and decided to give this place a try for dinner on Saturday. It is a small unassuming diner-like place where you order at the register. The service is very friendly and nice. Hubby ordered the veggie enchilada dinner and I ordered the grilled vegetable salad. We were served complimentary chips and warm salsa. We couldn&#39;t stop eating it - it was so freaking good! The food was served, and we were really surprised by the presentation - very good, fitting for a white table cloth restaurant - not what I was expecting here. The food was phenomenal - fresh ingredients, tasty and perfectly seasoned food. I wish they have a restaurant in the city somewhere - I would definitely be a regular patron there."

We had dinner there this evening it was our first time here.  To my surprise they were packed on a Thursday night!  The staff was friendly and once we got our table we received warm chips and salsa.  It was nice that for a change the salsa was warm but it tasted like it had too much tomato. I had the 2 taco dinner with al pastor and side of rice and pinto beans. It was pretty good it wasn&#39;t your usual greasy spoon type of joint. We also had beef burritos as well and my friend loved it! I&#39;ll defiantly try this place again especially for desert next time because they have fried ice cream and I need to have an empty belly!!

There&#39;s two types of dining out:  one is about the experience and the other is about the food. This one is all about the food. High-quality, very fresh, extra delicious. Steak tacos had all fresh ingredients and it was just a perfect balance of flavor and spiciness and crunch and freshness. Presentation was excellent. I believe it&#39;s important that food not only tastes delicious but looks delicious as it&#39;s served. Since you order at the front of the restaurant and the food is delivered to your table, I was not sure if tipping is appropriate. Any input on this would be welcome.
Highly recommended."

I went with one of the daily drink specials, the Paloma...Tequila, Sprite, and lime with salt. It was delicious. Got the horchata which was great but also loved the pina colada! We were served promptly, the food was super fresh. The salsa was warm and not too spicy. Started off with guacamole+chips which was great. I got the chicken enchilada dinner and the chicken was really moist unlike other places. The rice was awesome with bits of vegetables in it. The friend got steak tacos and the steak was cooked perfectly. A side of guacamole to start with which was very fresh as well. The waitress was very friendly as was the manager who came to check on us too.

The downfall? It has a small eating area, and too much noise from customers, cooks, along with music and tv. It is too small of space. Also the cooks were busy cooking fresh in the back and we could barely keep our eyes open so we can only assume it was because of the fresh cut onions. ??? We were ok halfway through, but at first couldn&#39;t stop laughing about it. The slot machines on the side lessen the class and it also would have been great to have outdoor seating...
  All in all its a good place to go to. The service and food are awesome and that will bring me back. I might get takeout though."

There was also a smoky red salsa and another greenish tomatillo salsa--both absolutely deelish. 

I ordered two fish and one shrimp taco --probably some of the best fish and shrimp tacos I have had. They don&#39;t put a slaw on theirs. It&#39;s covered in cheese, tomatoes and lettuce. The fish is not a heavy batter. It is a reddish color and lightly battered and deep fried.

Definitely worth checking out."

I came to the restaurant in 20 minutes, to pick up our food. I paid for the food, and sad and waited for almost an hour. I finally asked one of the waitresses, and she said, that they don&#39;t start cooking your food until you arrive. So what is the point of ordering ahead?

It took them an hour and a half, to give us our food, which was 6 tacos. The night I was in there they had messed up multiple people&#39;s orders.

It is a little pricey for the size of the meals, but if you dine-in, you get free chips and salsa and free refills on horchata.  I have never been to a restaurant that offers free horchata refills, so I didn&#39;t feel like I was jipped.    

Tip - if you order sides of sour cream and/or guacamole, make sure you specifically ask for it on the side if that&#39;s how you want it.  Otherwise, they will just bake it right into your burrito/enchilada, etc. The steak and ground beef are what to order!"

I eat a lot of Mexican food in a lot of areas because I drive everywhere in Chicagoland for my job.  And I&#39;m telling you, the pastor here is fantastic, top notch.  They make their food here with pride.  You can tell, because it is evident in their salsas.  I come here whenever I&#39;m in the area, and you should too."

I always have the fish tacos and they are tender flaky and not greasy.  My husband has the steak tacos and they aren&#39;t dry...very juicy!

I&#39;ve been trying to choose a favorite taco - the mahi mahi or the chilango (skirt steak, chorizo, bacon, melted cheese, jalapeno, onion, and cilantro) - but it is impossible to declare a winner. Just order one of each. 

I realize that it&#39;s a crime against authentic taco joints, but we have ordered the nachos supreme multiple times, and they are amazing. Judge me if you must. 

Chips and salsa are very good. All of the sauces are, too. It&#39;s the first taco restaurant I&#39;ve visited that has fountain Cokes. 

The service is friendly and efficient. The seating area is small, but we&#39;ve never had to wait long for a table. By the time our food is ready, we have always gotten a place to sit, even on a busy Saturday night or during a weekday lunch rush."

I&#39;ve had the chicken tacos (get them Mexican style) and the chili rellano. Their rice and beans are really good and their guacamole is fresh and tasty.

Good food. The restaurant is basically a good traditional mexican restaurant with an attempt at being trendy. The atmosphere is a bit gloomy, but the staff is super nice. 
I&#39;d give them four stars if their salsas were much better. They aren&#39;t spicy at all and a bit on the bland side. But the tacos are solid and well made."

1-10

The Place: Kinda off the side of the road behind the W.M. Parking lines need to be re-painted. Inside is very minimalist. You have a choice of Black, Grey or Stainless. I hope that a Menu or a Chalkboard with the basics is coming soon, because if there is a line, it&#39;s kinda hard to find the printed menus at the front of the line. That said, it&#39;s a taco place.... What do you think they have?!?! Location and de-core... 4

The Staff: Pretty cool and outgoing folks, very happy to accommodate you and very hospitable while you wait. I had a bunch of my minions with me and the gave them chips while we waited! Score! Gonna go 10 on staff!

The Food:
Tacos: I have had all of the tacos, the best was the Shrimp Taco and the Alpastor! 10

Torta: It was good, not a big avocado guy... 8

Nachos: .... This is a sticking point for me.... I HATE Yellow Gunk Nacho Cheese.... It&#39;s just oil that tastes like Yuck! Please change to real cheese and just melt it ever so slightly :-).  That said, it was a nice presentation and everything else was great! 6.... Good cheese will earn 4 more points! 

Rice: I&#39;ve said it on yelp before... I just don&#39;t like Spanish rice... It was ok... No rating since I&#39;m bias...

Beans: I love that the side comes in a little Chip Bowl, tasty and deliciousness... 10

Burrito: Normal solid Burrito 8

Chips and Salsa: Outstanding!!!! Well seasoned chips with very tasty Salsa, little on the warm side so beware. 11!

Pineapple coconut punch!!!: Killer!!! 10!

I look forward to seeing this place grow over the coming months! Great owners and food! Little help needed on De-core and ambiance, and a menu would be awesome :-)"

We&#39;e been there twice now, and the first time, we were blown away. This time was good too, but I have to be honest, they blew it with my carne asada. I asked for the steak medium well, and it was rare, or close to it. I think most people would have sent it back. I know they would have taken care of me if I&#39;d sent it back, but I don&#39;t mind it rare.  Rare just wasn&#39;t my preference this evening.  

On the plus side, the food quality and presentation are way above what I would have expected at a place like this. The price is reasonable, and the service is very very friendly. This place serves some of the best Mexican food I&#39;ve ever had. 

I was happy to hear they&#39;re expanding, with more seating. This place deserves all the success they seem to be having. In spite of the little issues I had, it&#39;s tops on my list for Mexican restaurants!"

The person who is supposed to take your order when you walk up to the register is also the same person who happens to be on the phone taking an order at the same time so you kind of just stand there until she&#39;s done with her call. 

The carnitas tacos are probably the best thing here along with their rice and beans. They are to die for! Chicken tacos are good. However, I&#39;m not the biggest fan of the weird seasoned salt they use on their chips and French fries. It&#39;s also a little pricy and doesn&#39;t have a lot of seating.

I also remember being very cold the last time we went. Might of been the fact that there are a lot of windows but I&#39;m sure turning up the heat a bit would&#39;ve helped. Everyone sitting around us were eating with their coats on."

Got that?)

I ordered the fish tacos. Based on this initial experience I&#39;ll be back. They were excellent. Perhaps not as good as the best I&#39;ve had in San Diego, but very, very good. Large pieces of fish, expertly fried and with fresh and tasty toppings plus several salsas available to dress them up with. Chips and salsa were also good.

They were very busy when I visited on a Sunday, mid-day, and so service was a tad slow but not to the extreme. Well worth the wait for some excellent fish tacos."

They actually have margaritas and beer, but you don&#39;t usually see anyone drinking much there, as they atmosphere is kinda blah.  They are talking about expanding the restaurant which would be a very GOOD thing.  They also need to fix the very huge pot-holes coming into their parking lot.  OH!

The manager, Isreal, greeted me with a smile and even gave me a few things to try out, on the house.   For that alone, I give this guy props.   He wants his taco joint to survive, and knows customer service comes first.

The service was absolutely incredible. Everyone there smiled and welcomed us and our waitress explained everything in detail when it came time to order and made sure to supply us with everything we needed.

The food, the food was by far the best steak i have ever had in my life! I ordered medium/rare and it was perfectly cooked with the meat still maintaining its juicy tender flavor. My wife had the filet mignon and i swear i have never tasted anything so good before in my life!

 The food is excellent, I am personally a fan of the Mary&#39;s Potatoes, but there are lots of great selections. Every time I have eaten there since, I have never been unhappy with my choice. The steak has always been cooked to the tempature I ordered, which doesn&#39;t always happen at every good steakhouse you go to. Price is about what you would expect for this type restaurant, not cheap, but not obnoxious either. Overall, I can say we put this on our &#34;let&#39;s go once every couple months&#34; list.

I have tried all of the different salads here and each one of them is bad. They all taste like coleslaw. Hate going here for a healthy lunch for that reason. Also, the lunch portions of the salads are HUGE and there is no one one person should/could finish one of the salads. It&#39;s wasteful to have them so large. Prices are also steep once you start adding protein to the salads. 
On the plus side, the other entrees (burgers, meatloaf, etc.) always look good. Service is usually OK. Bread is warm and good too, but I try to avoid going here for lunch."

It is very difficult to find &#39;city-worthy&#39; spots in the area but this rivals the best steakhouses in the city.  I always sit in the bar area and Ashley and Nikki take great care of their customers.  They also have a loyalty program, which I highly recommend.  They have some really amazing wines by the glass that you don&#39;t see many places.  They also have 50% off bottles on Sundays!  The chef here was one of the original Alinea guys so he obviously knows his stuff (and is quite friendly as well).  

They have amazing salads for lunch that you can add steak (or other proteins) to.  They make their own dressings and I absolutely love the lemon basil.  The steaks themselves are outstanding.  Well seasoned, cooked to a perfect medium rare, and moist every time.  The steak tartar is very good as well.  I love the ambiance, love the food, and love the staff!"

The server helped us pick a bottle of wine and made suggestions for appetizers. We followed his advice and he did not steer us wrong! We had the barbecue shrimp and a bottle of the boomtown merlot.

For dinner we both made our own surf and turf. My filet mignon was cooked beautifully and so was the ribeye. The only this is that one lobster tail was about half the size of another (thinner and smaller). I did appreciably the server separating the lobster meat from the tail table side. And Parmesan truffle fries were amazing!!!! And there were a lot of them. The spinach was also good but there was only enough for one of us and the same goes for the mashed potatoes. But there were delicious regardless!!!"

We come about every 2 months. We came here for Mothers Day. I want to say that we were skeptical coming for a holiday buffet. It has been our exprience with other higher end places that trying to keep up the quality on a buffet to the level of a ususal dinner night has left us disappointed. We were so delighted that this was not at all the case here. They did a fantastic job and quality was as perfect as usual. 

The service was top notch as always. The meal was well worth the price. The cocktail shrimp was excellent as was everthing else. Most of the food was dinner items which was great for us with plenty of meat, fish and vegatable choices but if you wanted breakfast there was freach toast which looked incredible at about 2 inches high, bacon, sausage and an omelet station. There was a carving station that had some of the best ham off the bone and beef tenderloin. Who does this? It was over the top great and you could cut it with a fork. What a great surprise from the rubbery roast beef many other places have on a buffet. They also had a fancy desert section ans get this ... a bananas foster station. And to top all of this off for an extra 10 bucks you could opt for bottomless bloddy mary&#39;s and mimosas&#39;s. This was by far the best buffett outside of one of the hight end ones in Las Vegas I have ever been at. We will be back here again and again and certainly for the next buffet chance."

The service was good, the hostess was friendly and the valet was fast. I had a review all ready for the food by the time we left. However, Sunday afternoon all 3 of us came down with violent cases of food poisoning. The only thing we had all eaten in the past 24 hours was the steak and salad at this restaurant. I know it&#39;s impossible to prove where you get it, but it has to have been either bad meat or lettuce that we ate Saturday night. I missed 2 days of work and my brother missed 2 days of school. It was really awful. My mom called to speak to a manager who apologized but basically didn&#39;t even offer to look into it or anything. When the only food the 3 of us ate in common was this dinner, it seems likely we got it here. Just a warning to others for the future."

Even though the prices are insanely high, the food and service are impeccable. I got the short ribs. They were tender and packed with amazing flavor. My boyfriend got the steak so I had to try a little and it was probably the best steak I have ever had in my life. We were there for a birthday and she ordered the bananas foster. The waitress actually cooked the bananas right in front of us. So if you are coming here, make sure to order that because not only is it tasty, but you get a show. In fact, the service at this place is so good, the manager walked around to make sure we were enjoying our visit. That is a mark of excellent service. 
The ambiance was also very nice. They have a wine cellar display which gives the dining experience a very upscale and intimate feel. The chairs are extremely comfortable, which always makes dining pleasurable, and they have big enough tables to comfortably eat your food without feeling like you are going to knock something over. Overall, this place is definitely worth going to once, and while I probably won&#39;t become a regular because of the cost, I will definitely pick this place for special occasions.

We went during the week and kind of late.  This is where having a really odd schedule comes in handy.  The restaurant was obviously winding down for the night and all I could think about is driving copious amounts of steak and sweet potato casserole into my mouth.  

I ordered the Bourbon Ribeye medium rare and my wife ordered a salad with the sweet potato casserole.  My steak came out cooked to perfection.  The flavor and quality of the steak was impressive.  I ordered one additional bacon wrapped BBQ shrimp to accompany my steak.  How could you go wrong with such a glorious combination?  

I did have a couple of bites of my wife&#39;s salad which was also excellent.  The sweet potato casserole was amazing!  There is a thin layer of chopped pecans protecting the sweet and savory orange deliciousness hiding just below.  This things is basically a dessert that could go with any meal at any time.  We struggled to save some to enjoy at home.  

Our server was friendly, helpful, and was just the right amount of accessible for us throughout the dinner.

So I&#39;m going to try this once more and hopefully I can convey the love I now feel for this restaurant.

--

Once upon a time in the kingdom of Willow Springs, a married couple got hungry. Too lazy to cook their own food, they turned to Yelp bookmarks to help decide on a place for dinner (because it would seem they couldn&#39;t possibly decide on a place that WASN&#39;T already bookmarked). 

&#34;Everything is the city is too far,&#34; one complained. 

&#34;I don&#39;t feel like pizza,&#34; the other grouched.

&#34;The place I really want to go closes in ten minutes.&#34;

&#34;I don&#39;t want junk. I might as well just cook something.&#34;

&#34;No, wait,&#34; the husband said, finally coming to a conclusion. &#34;I have it. Let&#39;s go to Eddie Merlot&#39;s.&#34; 

&#34;On a week night? I&#39;m going to have to get dressed up.&#34;

&#34;No, the lounge area has a really nice looking menu.&#34; He knew this from looking online. &#34;But you might want to...y&#39;know, put on pants.&#34;

So with pants on, the couple hopped in their chariot (okay, it was an SUV) and headed the few miles down the road to Eddie Merlot&#39;s...yes, on a week night.

When the couple arrived, they noticed a cute outdoor area with umbrella covered tables. Nice ones, not the type that advertise beer. But nobody was sitting there. It had been rather hot, but the sun was setting and the temperature was dropping faster than the wife&#39;s pants had when she arrived home. 

So bypassing the entire inside of the restaurant, or lounge area, they were seated in the cozy patio area, comfortably watching the sway of the trees and feeling the late summer breeze as the sun set in the west. 

Jim was their server for the evening, and he was training two other future servers. He was kind, attentive and gave helpful suggestions.

The couple ordered the meatloaf sliders, the escargot and the filet mignon potstickers (what?!). 

Potstickers: Absolutely stuffed with tender, melt-in-your mouth, buttery beef. Cooked medium rare and perfect. 

Escargot Bourguignon:
Not overcooked and rubbery at all. Perfect. Loved the flavor and the mushrooms complemented them nicely. Came with little puff pastries atop each one. Delicious.

Meatloaf Sliders:
Lovely beef. Kicky jalapeno pesto, and crispy onion straws.

The husband also ordered a martini, because, well, yum. And it was made with the good stuff. None of that bathtub gasoline swill they serve at lesser establishments (you know who you are). 

Fully satisfied with their choices, and full, but not too full, the couple happily perused the dessert menu. Being a steamy summer&#39;s night, everything seemed a bit heavy. And the husband was feeling particularly warm from the top notch alcohol in his martini. (Again, yum!)

When their eyes landed upon &#34;Eddie&#39;s Mixed Berries&#34; the couple was sold. Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries on vanilla ice cream? Oh yes. But that was only the tip of the iceberg.

Jim, the fantastic server, wheeled a black clothed cart out to the couple&#39;s table, and atop it sat a small burner, skillet and several dishes full of all things wonderful. He set to work making magic, melting butter and brown sugar, warming berries and mixing Bacardi Oakheart and raspberry liqueur, setting it aflame before delicately spooning it over two bowls of vanilla ice cream.

Their hearts could have stopped after the first bite, and they would have died happy. This concoction was the most magically delicious combination since (and before) Lucky Charms. Everything worked so well together and the taste was simply incredible. The husband&#39;s mouth waters even now thinking back to the wonderful dessert. 

And they lived happily ever after.

--

If I had half a complaint, it would be that Jim was a touch slower in returning to our table than I would&#39;ve liked. Perhaps he had many tables to serve inside in addition to ours, but I felt like we waited longer for things than we should have. Maybe it&#39;s because it was a week night and I wasn&#39;t really up for a leisurely dinner. I kind of wanted things faster. I considered giving only 4 stars due to that, but then I tasted the dessert and I wished I could give 6 stars. It was THAT. GOOD.

Prices at Eddie Merlot&#39;s are a bit steep. But we pretty much decided that this will be our special occasion restaurant from now on, and we look forward to returning and having a full meal instead of just the appetizers and desserts. 

See you soon, Jim! (and Eddie)"

Decor is beautiful, it&#39;s very pricey, the food is high quality &amp; delicious, but the service is only so-so...it really detracts from the experience. 

3ish star service. 
Totally underwhelmed by the quality of customer service at such an upscale restaurant. Expected friendly, attentive, nearly flawless service start to finish for the prices demanded by this restaurant. Host/hostesses are not very friendly. Waitstaff/hosts make errors on some very simple things. Have also had waiters who have condescending attitudes. 

4-5 star food. 
Quality is definitely there! Presentation is beautiful, and serving sizes are large. Most of the entrees do not come with a side, so you have to order them a la carte. The sides that we&#39;ve ordered a la carte have been delicious."

I was on a Monday (Birthday celebration), so it was very slow.  However, since the prices were not less, we should not receive less quality service or food.

We ordered the escargot.  It was perfect.  The puff pastry on top was incredible, light and airy.  It was perfect for sopping up the garlic butter.  The gorgonzola in the dish was not heavy.  You could taste it, but it melded with the butter and garlic so well.   The escargot, was not whole snails.  I had one that looked like a 1/2 inch by 1 inch piece of leather.  It tasted perfect.  I just never had sliced escargot.  I&#39;m guessing that Monday diners do not get the regular meal.  Once again, we pay the same price.

I did not know what the difference was between a prime ribeye steak and a prime rib.  Neither did our waitress.  I ordered the red Simi, and did not know they had a white Simi.  The waitress did not mention that and I got the white one.

I was not warned that the Bourbon sauce on the steak would cover the flavor of the steak.  It was very think and spicy.  I like the sauce, but I wanted to taste the meat.  My wife&#39;s steak without any sauce was delicious.  The steaks were cooked perfectly.  We had to ask for water and bread, and was already served our wine. and placed our appetizer and were eating our appetizers, so there was a lot of time that expired.   The busboy (don&#39;t like this word) went in the back to get our bread and came back out.  He told us that they just put it in the oven so it would be fresh.  Don&#39;t you do that when someone sits down?  The bread was also very good.  Who ever makes their breads and pastry, really has a lot of passion.

The salted caramel cupcake had no salted caramel.  It was a delicious devil&#39;s food cupcake.  The carrot cake was incredible.  Every flavor shined.  It clearly can feed four people.  

The manager was very attentive and pleasant.  Constantly removing our dirty plates and utensils and giving us fresh ones.  Although, he missed the bread and water too."

We decided to go on a weeknight to sit in the bar and watch the Bears game.  It was a mistake to watch the game because the Bears stink but our trip to Eddie Merlots was the best idea we had all week!

We made it just before Happy Hour ended which includes an assortment of cocktails for $5 and specially priced wines.  We landed on a bottle Cloudline Pinot Noir which was 1/2 price on the evening we went.  

We attempted to order a few items off the bar menu but both weren&#39;t availalbe (Filet Pot Stickers and Flatbreads)- which was a big disappointment and cost Eddie&#39;s a star for this visit.  Instead we decided on the Meatloaf Sliders and two of their famous side orders, Sweet Potato Gratin and Tempura Green Beans.  We enjoyed all three items immensely and the wine too.  Jeff our bartender for the evening was excellent as well.

Filet mignon pot stickers were great and ahi tuna wontons are a must have app wherever we go, weren&#39;t disappointed. Definitely have a lot more on the menu that I&#39;d love to come back and try.

Granted a casual dinner with my family, which included my parents turned more pricey than we were thinking of spending, i am glad we did because the night was perfect.  They have a children&#39;s menu, but surprisingly my daughter seemed to be the youngest around.  She was treated wonderfully.  She was even checked on by other workers possibly the maitre d to make sure she ate her mac and cheese and was told she would get a surprise if she finished it.  It was so nice to watch my daughter treated nicely at a pretty expensive restaurant.  Meal breakdown:

Bread - great, had a nice almost garlicky seasoning to it

Appetizer 
Sesame Calamari - so yummy and the sesame bowl is delightfully edible!  
French Onion Soup - the only disappointing part of the night.  It sounded so yummy with 5 types of onions, but it was kind of bitter.  A little salt fixed it, but I didn&#39;t want to have to add the salt. 

Salads
Cesar - same old yummy Cesar that you can get anywhere, the croutons were really great though

Main courses
Double Pork Chop - HUGE!!  Keep in mind that I am pretty full at this point.  I only ate about 1/4 of it, but it was cooked to my liking, the BBQ sauce was tasty, not too sweet and the mashed potatoes were great.

Steak Dinners - Can&#39;t really go into detail since I am not a red meat eater and didn&#39;t try it, but my parents raved about it.  

Pecan Crusted Trout - My hubby thought it was okay.  I tried it and it wasn&#39;t that spectacular.  He&#39;s a huge fan of pecans which is probably why he ordered it.  

Dessert - 
Red Velvet Cupcake - very good, and very homemade tasting which made it even better.  Very moist and it came with a cup of milk.. cute!

Crème brûlée - I am a sucker for this and will always order it.  It was just as good and yummy as I expected it to be.

It was a pricey night, over $300 plus several glasses of wine and a few beers, but definitely worth it, especially since service was excellent and they weren&#39;t snobby inside... especially since we weren&#39;t really dressed as well as the other patrons.  I didn&#39;t realize how fancy this place was, but nonetheless, we were treated so nicely.  Will be back!!"

The cheese burger I had was great- cooked rare just like I asked with lots of cheese. YUMMY!  The beer list was nice, with some unusual IPAs listed.  The bar tender came over to chat about the beer choices they offered.

However, I do think its not so nice to try to charge an EXTRA 2 bucks for fries AND 2 bucks for bacon when the burgers START at 11 bucks.  

Come on- fries should be included.  So a bacon cheese burger with fries starts 15 bucks here. 

Really? Please Eddie&#39;s, just include the fries. It&#39;s mean spirited to expect americans to eat potato chips with burgers! 

FREEDOM FOR FRIES!!!!!!!!!!"

They said their meals were excellent, but my filet, on the &#34;prix fixed&#34; menu which I ordered, &#34;rare&#34;, (a mistake as it was pretty raw), had the whole tendon attached underneath, and was almost impossible to cut.  At their listed prices, that is inexcusable, and I doubt we&#39;ll revisit the dining room.  The service, however, was truly a delight, and our waitress made the evening wonderful."

For an appetizer my guest and I tried the Calamari.  It was great! Not the best I&#39;ve had but still pretty damn good.  Super tender and not chewy at all; and it had the most interesting, almost tempura like batter that I have never experienced before with Calamari.

Wow what a Burger! I&#39;ve had about a handful of world class burgers and this now ranks at #1 for me.  This is no average burger, it is made with ground filet mignon/ribeye so as you can see it is made with the absolute best ingredients.  I ordered the Prime Burger with Bacon and cheddar cheese, and asked for it cooked medium.  It came out just how i wanted it and the bun complimented the burger to perfection.  Keep in mind this is a 14$ burger but you definitely get what you pay for.  Normally the Burger comes with a side of house made chips but my guest and I opted to add 2$ for the Parmesan truffle fries.  They were solid but nothing special; will probably just go with the chips next time that don&#39;t cost extra. For something on the healthier side we tried the Asparagus.  Honestly just tasted like boiled asparagus and had absolutely no seasoning on it from what i could tell.  It wasn&#39;t bad by any means but not worth the hefty price tag for just some veggies.  We were absolutely stuffed so we passed on the dessert, but i got to admit the table side bananas foster looked very tempting, next time...next time

Now for the service...Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the restaurant and the food, which was very respectable, professionalism at its finest at this point.  But throughout the whole meal he kept checking up on us a ridiculous amount of times and started making small talk/talking about the food/trying to get us to sign up for some Platinum Club that costs 25$?  I came here to have a relaxing evening and chat with my company but i&#39;m serious that the waiter literally kept talking to us more than me and my guest got to talk to each other.  If he could just take it down a notch it would have been great service but he was sooo over the top it was mind boggling.  And he would not stop pestering us about signing up for the platinum club (the workers here must get some benefits if customers sign up for the club).  It was like he was a car salesman it was ridiculous. It got to the point where he actually brought the manager over and once again both of them kept bothering us about signing up for this platinum club.  I&#39;m already spending alot of dough at your establishment and your going to keep bothering us about spending more money to sign up for some club!

Overall the food here is 5 stars and i will be back here without a doubt for a burger from time to time.  But at the same time my evening was  hampered by being constantly bothered by the wait staff trying to up-sell us (making it very hard to talk/enjoy the time with my company) i had to take the place down by one star.  Please guys just tone it down a bit please"

I have passed here quite a few times and went elsewhere when I was in the area. Except for the drive here, you would not know that you aren&#39;t dining in the city. 
Ambience, staff attention, presentation and quality food can all be found here. I actually had a better meal here than in some (obviously I&#39;m going to withhold names) city restaurants which was a pleasant surprise, once again because of the low reviews. 
Portions were generous and we had the BBQ shrimp, which was a hit, the bone in filet that had good flavor and was perfectly executed, added a couple of sides and topped off with a few excellent martinis. Was really a solid meal, will stop in when next in the area, even just for martinis in the bar."

My wife and I were in town on business and we were staying at a hotel down the street and really wanted a nice steak. The reviews were pretty good and since it was close we decided to check it out. I made reservations via opentable online since it was a Friday night. Making reservations was super easy. 

We arrived a few minutes early and were seated and not long after our waiter came to the table and spoke to us by name and since it was our first time, gave us a lil history about the place and told us about the specials and the different cuts of meats and fish. 

I decided to get the 7oz filet mignon and my wife got the 16oz bone in filet mignon. For sides we got the garlic mashed potatoes, roasted mushrooms and asparagus spears.

There was a slight issue with our dinner but our waiter was super informative and very attentive to our needs. He even comped us dessert because of the issue.

Now onto the food.. Both steaks were cooked to perfection and were the best steaks we have ever tasted! Being from Las Vegas, we have been to plenty of good steakhouses but nothing compares to this place! The sides were also amazing as well!

The place is pretty pricey but that&#39;s pretty standard for a nice steakhouse. Would definitely recommend to everyone to try it out! 

Totally wish they had a location in Vegas but if we ever go back to Chicago we will definitely be going back!"
eddie-merlots-burr-ridge-burr-ridge,Carol K.,ZYZNcugF3xUEGyLOVGiZ0Q,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,1235,107,cliJkLeGrff9eKDC-6aH3Q,4.0,2012-06-30,"Wow.  Obviously Eddie Merlot&#39;s does not have a lot of fans here on Yelp.  What gives, people?  

We went on a Friday night.  The bar was hopping with live entertainment (often tough to find out in the &#34;burbs&#34;!) which was a definite plus for this girl.  Lots of windows on the bar side which was also nice and added to the decor.

Speaking the the decor- I know some people feel it is dated but the rooms are actually quite lovely. Done in tones of burnt umber, beige and gold, the rooms are really something to look at.  I know this is a chain and that they all look the same way but the effect works.  Plush, upholstered chairs, floor to ceiling drapes in the side room to minimize noise (it is a bit loud in the main dining room as the noise seems to echo off the raised ceiling).  If you want a more intimate experience- ask to sit in the room with the fireplace.  My only complaint (and it&#39;s a personal pet peeve of mine) is that our table wobbled.  C&#39;mon.  If you are going for upscale dining- get the tables leveled.

Our server, Carly, was great.  She had lots of suggestions and told us her favs on the menu which is always appreciated.The menu is huge so wandering through all the choices is quite the task.  I could live without the raw steaks being brought to my table (I get that there is more marbling in a rib eye than a strip steak) but I guess that is part of the shtick of this place.

We started with a custom chosen seafood tower.  Now you can go with the two that they have identified, but we decided that we didn&#39;t want all of that.  Probably in the long run what we ordered cost more but it was exactly what we wanted.  Shrimp. lobster tail. crab meat, tuna tartar and a smattering of the two oysters of the day made a lovely presentation . . . . .although I could have lived without the dry ice making the whole thing look like a witches cauldron!.  And if you go- skip the tuna tartar- it is way over sauced and you lose the taste of the fresh tuna.

Our steaks were perfectly prepared and delicious.  I always order the same thing in steak houses just to make the comparison so this was one of the better NY strips that I have had.  Funny- I really wanted to order the meatloaf last night (yep- meatloaf in a steakhouse . . .go figure!)  but the NY strip always &#34;calls to me&#34; so that was the winner along with a side of crab legs.  So much food that I am lucky to have leftovers today.

Typical steakhouse in that the steaks come alone and the sides are separate.  We went with the Eddie&#39;s special potatoes which were potatoes with jalapenos and cheese (really, be still my heart!) and the sauteed spinach.

The service was excellent.  Carly and her team took excellent care of us, the busser made sure our water glasses were never empty and the plates were cleared at just the right time.  

There is complimentary valet parking (always makes me laugh as there is also a parking lot that you can just park yourself in but I guess that would deprive the valet of a tip).  This location is easy to get to as it is right off of I-55 and County Line Road.  Dinner for two with drinks ran about $220 which seemed reasonable to me given the quantity and quality of the food served. 

Interesting to me that this place has a bit of a reputation for being &#34;expensive&#34; and &#34;fancy&#34;.  I tried to get my assistant to schedule a work dinner here and her response was it cost too much so we ended up at Topaz which is just down the street but the prices seem similar to me.  As for fancy?  Wear what you like.  People were in everything from nice jeans to dresses.

The other thing to note is that Eddie Merlot&#39;s has a wide range of prices on their menu including several &#34;combinations&#34; like Steak Diane for 2 or the California meals that was a set menu for a set price which both seemed very reasonable to me so maybe they just need to get the word out about the range of offerings that they have.

All in all, a lovely evening of food, drinks and a little entertainment which for this girl who likes to &#34;play&#34; in the city was surprised to find in the &#34;burbs&#34;!"

Big delicious Caesar salad.  Incredible sweet potato side dish.  Outstanding bananas foster for dessert.  The entrees were good, as expected.  And I like that they give you your sauce on the side, rather than pouring it on the filter themselves, allowing you to control the portion. I AM THE MASTER OF MY SAUCE.

 Its on the pricey side, and won&#39;t be in the regular rotation.  But for a special event I&#39;d certainly recommend it."

I had two criteria for picking a place and Eddie Merlot&#39;s satisfied both.  They had last minute available reservations at the time we wanted and they also had a buffet.  Too bad I didn&#39;t have a third criteria - good food!  The selection of food was limited.  For example, the salad table had only one kind of salad - Caesar.  The hot food section was also pretty limited in choices.  The carving station had only filet mignon and ham.  One time the entire filet was twell done (embarassing for a steak place) but the ham was pretty tasty.  The omelet station was kind of a bust too.  I asked for one egg over easy and the &#34;chef&#34; clearly did not know how to make one!  Desserts were not impressive, very institutional in presentation and appearance, and no great shakes in terms of taste.

The only redeeming thing about the brunch was the service - every trip back from the brunch line was met with the old dishes removed, a freshly folded napkin and clean silverware.

We were greeted by very friendly hostesses and we were seated.  We ate at 6:00 p.m. on a Friday so one, the place was not busy and we were easily the youngest people in there by 20 years (I&#39;m in my early 40&#39;s).  

The decor made me think of  dining in Las Vegas, specifically, Bellagio.  Not that that&#39;s a bad thing, but rather, it seems stylishly overdone.  But, if the food is good, who cares what the decor is?

Yuliya, our waitress, could not have been nicer.  She helped us with recommendations and did not make us feel rushed.  I had the Venetian strip and my wife had the filet.  Both were good.  We split the Brussels sprouts and they were good.  We ordered the cheesecake which was both the best I&#39;ve ever had and the biggest piece I ever had. 

My wife didn&#39;t drink due to being pregnant but I had a very good rye Manhattan and a glass of port with dessert.  Our dessert was free as a gift for us being pregnant.  It was certainly a nice surprise.

I&#39;d like to come back here but the $25 coupon, free dessert, and only one of us drinking made our bill much lighter than it would be.  We spent about $72 and tipped generously due to the great service.

Is it the best steak place around?  No.  I reserve that for Golden Steer in Forest Park.  However, that place is nowhere near as ritzy as Eddie Merlot&#39;s.  Paying full price at Eddie Merlot&#39;s is an expensive evening out but the service, for us, more than made up for that."

Good food at very high prices. I&#39;d suggest eating at the bar and order appetizers to lower the costs.  Order the fried green beans - very good.

Decor is nice, certain seats are great for some romance points.  If you think you&#39;ll be back buy into the membership.  You&#39;ll get your money back and more.

All the seafood items are very good - no complaints."

My wife and I invited a great couple to join us. What an enjoyable evening! Sure, Eddie&#39;s is expensive, but we went there knowing it - it wasn&#39;t a surprise. The food was absolutely top notch! Mike, our server, was attentive and his humor was welcome. I commented to my friend that I had not had as enjoyable a night, awesome steaks, desserts, salads, and everything - in years!

Perhaps  my expectations were too high after hearing  many good reviews, but I found it to be highly overrated. Our server was personable and informative, but difficult to understand with his accent. Our oyster appetizer was excellent, but everything went downhill from there. Our Caesar salads contained overdressed romaine and I had barely touched my salad when our entrees appeared. I detest being rushed, especially in a &#34;high end restaurant&#34;. I ordered the sea bass and my husband order the bone-in bison ribeye, our intention was to share. My sea bass was small, dry and lacked flavor, for $37,  I expected much more. The ribeye was tasty but a bit tough. When asked about our food, my reply was &#39;it&#39;s just ok, I&#39;ve had much better.&#39; This brought the manager out (not my intention), he was over the top in wanting to please me (at one point kissed my hand, ugh!) and brought out the halibut special, which was better. Our server surprised us with a dessert, a chocolate cupcake, again rather boring. All in all, I&#39;ll never go back and will not recommend. 
Should have waited for a table at Hugo&#39;s or gone back to Perry&#39;s Steakhouse."

The five of us walked in at 5pm right after they opened.  There were maybe five or six tables seated in the restaurant.  The decor was eye catching but cookie cutter.  Almost seemed like they were trying to channel Vegas in some regards with the giant lamps and the stained glass.  I could tell that they did not spare any expense from the silver to the wine glasses, menu, bathrooms, etc.   Overall much much nicer than Max and Erma&#39;s!

The menu was extensive but the prices were way off.  This place was more expensive than the highest end Steak Houses in Chicago.  More expensive than Sullivan&#39;s or Maestros without the swagger or ambiance that big boys carry.  

Furthermore, we sat down at five ordered each course at the beginning, app, soup, salad, entree.  We waited 50 minutes for the app, and a half hour between the rest of the courses.  We ended up sitting there for three hours and twenty minutes on a Sunday evening in a half crowded restaurant.  

My steak tasted great although they didn&#39;t have the one I originally requested.  My mom ordered medium and it came out well done.  She was pretty upset with her entire birthday experience.  The Mac and Cheese, and the Eddie&#39;s potato sides were sub par, yet the Brussels sprouts and creamed spinach were excellent.  

The manager was attentive and tried to make amends, but after over three hours of a comedy of errors, there was little that he could do to rectify the situation.   

Bottom like, if I am going to pay $60 for a steak I will be going to stick with the Big League players and steer clear of Eddie Merlot&#39;s."

Space nice and service good but food just ok, especially for price. Steak and sea bass entrees were decent but nothing special and calamari, a house specialty supposedly, was some of the most rubbery I have ever eaten. Parmesan truffle fries very dry and need some sort of dipping sauce. Highlight was chopped salad but if a salad is highlight of a steakhouse meal, not saying much. Guess there isn&#39;t much else in the area but would rather drive to Perry&#39;s, wildfire, or Gibsons for a better meal."

weekend at Eddie Merlot&#39;s in Burr Ridge.  

Immediately upon entering Merlot&#39;s, one is visually astounded by the
upscale contemporary décor - the lighting is colorful and festive, the
stained glass pieces that hang from the ceiling are beautiful, the
chairs at each table are &#34;living room&#34; stuffed chairs, which
immediately makes you realize you will be comfortably seated in this
sophisticated arena.  Spacing of tables allows for easy movement around
the restaurant and is conducive to privacy in conversation.  Although
your eyes are roaming to take in all the beautiful décor, the main
attraction would have to be the floor-to-ceiling wine &#34;cellar&#34; encased
in glass, which takes up the back wall of the restaurant.  The &#34;cellar&#34;
offers you a rare view of the large selection of the wines that
Merlot&#39;s has to offer.

You are escorted to your table by one of several hostesses and your
wait staff magically appears within minutes.  Our waiter, Jaime, gave a
short overview of the steaks for which Merlot&#39;s is known, and when
asked, comfortably offered suggestions and comment on our selections.
For appetizers, presentation of the calamari was most notable as it is
served in an edible &#34;bowl&#34; made to look like an open clam/seashell.
Upon our waiter&#39;s recommendation, we also ordered the blue cheese
potato chips which were flavorful and delicious, but not heavy.
Merlot&#39;s offers several salads, one being a wedge, however, what set
Merlot&#39;s apart, was the offer of a maple apple cider vinaigrette, which
caused the taste buds to water.

For the steak lover, the bourbon marinated rib eye is a flavor
explosion, while the bone-in rib eye with gorgonzola literally melted
in the mouth. Sides are perfect for sharing, and the Eddie&#39;s potatoes
(diced potato with jalapeno in au gratin sauce) are a great enhancement
to any entrée and something apart from the everyday baked potato.  The
Brussels sprouts with cippollini onions and diced bacon would make a
veggie eater out of anyone.  They were a taste bonanza.  Each course is
brought to the table and served by wait staff and managers so that the
entire table is served at one time.

Eddie Merlot&#39;s is a fine dining experience geared for the diner who
wants to savor and enjoy each course with the perfect down time in
between.  General manager Jeff Stoltman and his staff are devoted to
making you feel pampered.  Merlot&#39;s is the perfect place for that
special occasion, even if that special occasion is simply because it&#39;s
a Saturday!"

Wow, it&#39;s not that often that I come out of a restaurant and say that the service was probably the best part of the night..... not that the food was bad, its just the service was fantastic.  Our waiter popped up out of no where at all the appropriate times!  

BEST OF ALL - Our waiter did not try to up-sell us on anything!  When was the last time you were at a restaurant and the waiter didn&#39;t push you for a 3rd glass of wine or an extra side dish or dessert?    We still spent over $150 (not including tip) for two people, but it was just very refreshing to NOT feel rushed into or out of our mean and NOT feel pushed into buying food we didn&#39;t want.   BRAVO.  

Minus one star because they were late by 10 mins on our reservation and the hostess was kind of rude.  

Oh yeah, even though the place reminded me of a las vegas steak house, it seemed to be full of the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s generation... (I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s a bad thing, just a different crowd vs. many of the downtown Chicago steak houses)"

For a Wednesday night, it was pretty full, which is a good sign. In a really cute area. Super nice when you walk in and the chairs at the table are super comfortable- I know kind of weird but they are like couch chairs- so great and different from other restaurants. great service and really great food and wine. Pricey but it&#39;s a nice restaurant so what would you expect.

Something I thought was interesting- we were sitting there and they were training someone and this new waiter was setting the table next to us and then had to have someone inspect.... the boss made him take 2 glasses back because they had fingerprints on them. So obviously they strive for great service!"

The food is always good. We usually have a variety of appetizers. The carpaccio is delicious. We also split the ahi tuna entree and have that as an app. The parmesan  truffle fries are not to be missed!
Why I decided to write this review though has to do with my outstanding experience. I was celebrating my birthday-nothing big. The reason we went there is for the bananas foster for dessert. When it came time to order that treat, the server informed us that they did not have any of the desserts with bananas because they were out!!! I was devastated. Then a manager stepped in-we joked that the grocery store is right across the street can&#39;t we get some bananas?? Before we knew it he actually went to the store brought back the bananas and the table had the delicious flaming bananas foster!! Very impressive and a great way to end my birthday. 
So go! Have a great time with great food and outstanding service!"

We made reservations online and were seated as soon as we sat down.  We were greeted by a lady who asked for our drink order.  We told her we needed another minute to decide and she informed us that our server would be back to take our order.  So we sat and waited. And waited....and then finally the manager (possibly?) came around to asked if we&#39;ve been helped.  I said no since it had been almost 10 minutes and no one had come back to take our order.  He gladly took our drink order.

A minute or two later, the server came by.  No introduction, no hello. All we got was &#34;Have you decided on your order yet?&#34; It was slightly frustrating since we could hear another server&#39;s interaction with the table next to us explaining the soup of the day, the seafood specials and giving his opinion on the menu items.  We got nothing.  It seemed that since we were a younger couple, our waitress didn&#39;t bother to make an effort to appreciate our business.

We ordered drinks and calamari (which came in an edible shell) and both were delicious.  The guy who brought the food was very friendly and explained what the different sauces were.  The rest of our dinner was also very tasty (filet mignon and the trio of medallions).  We also opted for desserts made tableside.  The waitress seemed to warm up to us a little more.

Overall the service could have been a lot better but the food was delicious.  Didn&#39;t really appreciate the waitress&#39;s attitude. Maybe we&#39;ll be back, but not anytime in the near future."

Eddie Merlots is a great experience. The service and staff is outstanding. We ordered the Chateaubriand and were disappointed by the cut and preparation. The thickness of the tenderloin piece used made it difficult for the Chef to properly cook it. The outside was hard crusted and extremely dry while the center was blood raw (no balance). Because of the shape and the crustiness, our server had some difficulty cutting and serving the portions. At over $90.00 for the meal, we were disappointed with the quality."

We arrived at 6 pm and were surprised that there were hardly any cars in the parking lot. All the other local restaurants nearby were almost full.

Upon entering, we were greeted with the strong smell of an open sewer! I had to stand there a moment and make surer I was smelling what I thought I was...then my wife asked &#34;do we really want to eat here?&#34; And we walked out.

We were seated in the bar next to the fireplace in one of the shorty tables with thick cushioned chairs. Made for a cozy night. We also had a shot at the TVs so we could keep up with the Hawks and their winning streak! Johnathon was our server and he kept us satisfied the whole evening. On the money, polite and knew his business. I started with the Ruffino pinot, that didn&#39;t last thru his next visit. We started with 6 west coast Rockefeller&#39;s and the famous smoking jumbo shrimp cocktail. Oh! I also switched to Crawford sb on our servers suggestion, which was a much better choice. The oysters Roc came out in short order. They were smokin hot and delicious!! Meaty, with just enough cheese and spinach that left them flavorful but not overpowering. I&#39;ve had the shrimp before and was looking forward to them. I thought we ordered two, one for each of us as I explained to Johnathan that I didn&#39;t want to share any of my food. No big deal as we kept covering the table for the duration. This was my only disappointment of the evening. One of the shrimp was Irish! It was like almost half the size of the others? And the sauce that was supposed to be thick and spicy with the horseradish, was watered down and weak! I kept dipping the shrimp into it to try to get it to stick. To no avail! Our server came back with another glass of that fine wine and we placed out entrees. Not before they brought out a Caesar salad. Wow! This is one of the best that I have had. The first anchovie I bit into didn&#39;t have much flavor. Then I got the second and the party in my mouth had begun! The croutons added nothing to texture of the salad as they were too large and flavorless. They should be an option delete for future meals. I had a taste for some comfort food and the beef bourguignon hit the spot! Button mushroom and chunks of meat in a thick brown gravy over a pile of mashed that made me do the happy dance. It came in a bowl, so Johnathan was a bit surprised that I wiped it clean with their oven fresh and crusty, soft in the middle loaves of bread. I finished the night off with a big hunk of cheese cake and a glass of Belle Meiomi. Fine dining brought to a comfortable level of outstanding service and pleasant atmosphere!"

This is definitely less stuffy, with more emphasis on wine and not the over-the-top gigantic portions.

Very large wine selection by glass and bottle.  For such a large list I would have hoped for either carafe option or maybe wine flights -- maybe they&#39;ll consider this someday.  By the glass (we weren&#39;t up for more) the choices were mostly $8-14, though you could have spent much more on reserve vintages.  

I had a very decent gazpacho, classically prepared, though a bit salty (I often think restaurant chefs over-salt).  Also shared a chopped salad which did well.

We weren&#39;t up for steak, but our neighbors&#39; plates looked good.  Instead, we had beef bourguignon and sesame crusted tuna sashimi (though it&#39;s not called that on the menu).  I wouldn&#39;t call Eddie Merlots a sushi destination, but my dinner was quite decent.  The beef was laid on a large helping of mashed potatoes.  I would have preferred more beef and less potatoes, but otherwise this was a good dish too.

We skipped desert, but were tempted by the carrot cake which again looked good at the next booth.

Our waiter Joseph was quite friendly, even chatty, which is a nice contrast to the Morton-style stuffiness.  I think we&#39;ll return if we get a steak craving.  (Maybe they&#39;ll create a $99 couples steak menu like Morton&#39;s had.  Hint!)"

The cheese and charcuterie selection was excellent - aside from the meat and cheese, the sauces and chips alone were exciting.  My filet was cooked perfectly and plated as I expected.

We dined there for Christmas Eve with 14 family members. I made the reservation when the restaurant first opened after Thanksgiving.

I also waited to try the restaurant because new restaurants have to iron out the kinks with food prep and help situations.

The valet, the coat check, the front reception were all accommodating with our group.  Our waiter and waitress were very professional.  Our drinks were well made. (Also,a little expensive when compared to other area restaurants but they
tasted so much better.  I had a Dewars Scotch old fashioned and it was the best I have had in a while.)
 
We ordered appetizers to start with the hot and cold fish platters.
OMG, the BEST fried calamari and the BEST BBQ Shrimp I have ever had!
I ordered the petite 6 oz. filet cooked medium with the side of lobster tail.  My husband had the New York strip.  Everyone&#39;s food appeared hot and delicious.  We ordered sides for the table to share.  The creamed spinach was a favorite, along with the hash browned potatoes which were crispy but not greasy or dry.

We were too full for dessert plus I had candy and cookies at the house for Christmas but the desserts appeared mountainous!  Red velvet cake, Carrot Cake, and Cheesecake looked absolutely scrumptious.  I would even entertain going around 10 pm for dessert and a cappaccino.

We returned the following week with another couple for New Year&#39;s Eve.  I ordered the exact same plate but ordered a crab cake appetizer and a chopped salad, which were superb.  My girlfriend had a cosmopolitan and she said it was perfectly made.

My only real complaint is that I feel the food is a tad expensive for what you receive.
I live in Burr Ridge and I am wondering if the prices will turn people away.  After all,
there are people that live in the area that can afford it.  But, are we stupid?  I think not.  So, a plea to Eddie Merlot&#39;s management would be to lower your prices on drinks and food.  Larger portions would not be necessary.  Just reduce the prices around 10%.

However, take into account that the 1) service is impeccable 2) drinks made to order are perfect 3) atmosphere is conducive for conversation and the acoustics are good.

We have been to other steak houses where we had to wait, even though we had a reservation. Also, the noise level can give me a headache in those &#34;other&#34; busy steak houses.  Eddie Merlot&#39;s was busy but was very comfortable and the atmosphere is wonderful.  The bar is beautiful, too.

Will I go back to Eddie Merlot&#39;s?  In a heartbeat.  I will give up eating out for a month just to dine there on a budget.  Yum and fun. Best fish and steak I have had prepared in a long time. I highly recommend this for a special occasion.   Happy dining!"

You can&#39;t charge prices on a par with Gibsons or just slightly under and supplement it with amateur service.  The food is average at best - nothing special, nothing makes it stand out.  The wait staff, greeters and even the bartenders are too inexperienced to make the dining experience anything more than average for most places and below average for a place that is priced as high as this.  I was being entertained by one of my vendors and were I the one paying for the meal, I would have asked for much better service than we were being given.

Eddie Merlots is worth every penny of the money for the &#34;cut of meat&#34; as a yelper put!
Vegas paaaa Gibsons is in the city and Oak brook so is tht any cheaper-Just sayin!
ok back to Eddies-which was formerly the Max and Erma&#39;s in Burr Rigde. WOWOh
WOW- It is a beautiful place with Decor lighting the seating,dining and Bar all deserve the 5 stars I am giving it. We have gone for Anniversary 2x,New Years Eve 2x ,Birthdays 4x and in general dining with friends business partners. While the decor may feel like you are in downtown chicago ----NOT VEGAS! the customer service is as impeccable as the cleanliness and food are.
In all those times i listed above and some I forgot to mention meeting g/fs in the bar for apps which are also yumme presentation is awesome! I have not had a bad meal or service in fact the food is even tastier every time we go. I find the consistency
of Eddie&#39;s to be tried and true.
Go see for you self it is the place to dine in the burbs! oh and what we have eaten
There prices arent only 55 as stated below!- sorry to be this way. I think if you want to rate it 3 then say something other then it was $55 very miss leading-to those of us who yelp around to see where we would like to go!
first they have cuts of filet for $27 on up to $80+for a full RACK of Lamb. the salads start at $7 and $8 dollars very reasonable! The salads are pretty good size portions we split them and it is more then enuff for 2. if you want a salad entree try Caeser which is in big tilted bowl a meal they are in themselves. Apps start anywhere from$3 which is a &#34;create your own melody&#34; upwards to$66 for Seafood Platter which is huge.
No I do not work for them in any way just find them one of the hidden secrets!

Our experience duplicated most everyone else&#39;s.  Here is my review:

Decor.  Very nice. Chairs were most comfortable.  Restroom clean.  No solar issue.  Parking very good.

Service.  Wendy the waitress was very good.  Water refill spot on.  Dish pick up non existent.  Rest of help just stands around, didn&#39;t do much for us. Two managers on duty, I guess.  One guy wearing a tie stopped at the table but didn&#39;t introduce himself, name or title.  Was he a manager?  Did he even work there?  He could have been another diner for all we knew.

Bar.  Mixed drinks good.  Wine not good.  This restaurant prides itself on its wine, we were served some horrible wine.  To me, this was the worst part.

Food. Sea Bass very good.  Italian Steak Very good.  Two rib eyes (their best steak) one OK the other so bad my guest left it on the plate uneaten.  Side dishes OK.

Dessert. Carrot cake excellent.  Ice cream and sorbet OK.

Price.  5 people, tip tax, out the door $540.00.

Conclusion.  Disappointing.  (And we are desperately looking for a nearby steak house to replace Morton&#39;s in Westchester that closed.)  As other people have pointed out, this restaurant just isn&#39;t worth it.  Our bill was too high but what was worse, our guests who didn&#39;t see the bill said they would not want to come back.

Sorry Eddie.  We really wanted to like your place but sadly, we did not."

Well for starters, our reservation was at 7:30.  I was finally served my salad at 9p.  Need I say more?  I will admit, the food was fab, really pretty damn good stuff here...but I must add, management needs to focus on service!!  I don&#39;t care how good your food is, if it takes an hour and a half to receive my salad, I&#39;ll never return.  In fact, we were surrounded by unhappy guests!  The manager was busy humoring a couple at the table next to us most of the night.  When I asked our server if they were short-staffed he said &#34;yes, busboys.&#34;  Well, that explains why, even though he&#39;s walked past our table plenty (along with other staffers and they are all careful NOT to make eye contact), this explains why my bread plate and our empty cocktail glasses still litter our immediate landscape.  ;)  At one point, our server (who shall remain nameless) said to my friend &#34;I know it seems like I&#39;ve been ignoring you all night, blah, blah, blah...&#34;  to which my friend said &#34;that&#39;s because you HAVE been ignoring us.&#34;  ;)  He then launched into a few minutes of flattery and it&#39;s like dude, nice attempt at salvaging your tip.  You judged this book by the wrong cover.  I hope that table with the two &#34;power couples&#34; (he practically licked all evening) stiffed him.  I&#39;m saving my next obscenely large tip for someone more deserving.  WAIT!  I should have started with the smell!  One reviewer said it smelled &#34;like sewer&#34; and those were my exact words!  Upon entering, it&#39;s like you&#39;re hit in the face with an odor of...sewage!  Ugh, def not appealing in the least.   2 stars ONLY for the food.  The service and that ODD odor were point deductions."

The service was excellent and best of all if you sit in the bar area the chairs are like recliners, they are so comfortable you will not want to get up and the wait staff will not rush you out. They will serve you for hours and make you feel at home. A bit pricey but the food, drinks, and service are up to par with there prices."

Again, I ordered the exact same drink I have (until April 15th, anyway, when I switch to Boodles and tonic) and again the tab was $14.14 for the drink plus tip.  So I&#39;m not going to stiff the bartender, so that&#39;s a $3 tip and I wind up with a $17 Manhattan.  I don&#39;t care where you are, that&#39;s a lot for a drink.  I had one at two of the swankiest bars/restaurants in Palm Beach just days before and even at the flippin&#39; Breakers Hotel the exact same drink was only $11.  I so sincerely want to like this place, and it&#39;s nice, but it&#39;s not THAT nice. Why can&#39;t they get their act together on pricing? Even their chef (ex of Alinea) is a top shelf guy, but...  Well, enough. I&#39;ve said my peace."

I was meeting a friend for lunch and she suggested Eddie Merlot&#39;s in Burr Ridge.  I told her I didn&#39;t think they did lunch but she said that someone had just dropped off a lunch menu at her workplace, so I agreed to meet her there.

First off, it is a beautifully done restaurant.  A little over the top with the decor, but I can appreciate the effort.  We got seats next to the fireplace and sat in the most comfortable restaurant chairs I have experienced in a long time. My friend ordered a combo of soup and flatbread... the french onion soup was the best (she let me try some) and they did an unusual take on a veggie flatbread with shaved brussel sprouts.  I had the BBQ, Bacon Wrapped shrimp with a side of tempura green beans.  There were only three shrimp, but they were HUGE and there was no upcharge to get the tempura beans (which came with a side of wasabi cream sauce).  We also got a complimentary Red velvet cupcake to finish the meal.  I had asked for a house glass of pinot noir too and when I looked over the bill, it was only $5.

This may be my new go-to lunch place. It&#39;s not diner cheap, but I&#39;&#39;ll pay a couple bucks more for this level of food and atmosphere.  It also wasn&#39;t that busy, but I have a feeling that is going to change once word gets out."

Had a couple hot dogs and fries, and if you&#39;ve ever had a great hot dog, like at Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s, there&#39;s no way you could like these. For Vienna dogs, they were surprisingly tasteless, and small. And, like many other reviewers here, my bun was dry and not steamed. I also didn&#39;t like the skinny &#34;shoestring&#34; fries that you need to eat with a fork. But at least they weren&#39;t greasy and soggy like I&#39;ve read about.

The fries that come with the platter are also decent too. 
This location is in a plaza off of county farm road and Geneva  behind the walgreens. 

There is plenty of parking here as well so fear not!

I&#39;m not going to review this joint on the hotdogs. It&#39;s a Chicago style Vienna beef hotdog. Can&#39;t really mess it up... 

The problem is pretty much everything else on the menu. I ordered the chicken sandwich. The chicken was paper thin, and they served it up on a hamburger bun. The flavor was good, but the sandwich alone won&#39;t fill you up. The same goes for the bbq beef. Poor quality, served up on a hamburger bun. I could have eaten three.  

The soup is garbage. The cream of chicken rice was like broth, and not much flavor.

My girlfriend had the gyro, it was very tasty. Problem was, they put about a half teaspoon of sauce on it. 

The kitchen staff is nice, but not very helpful. They are all teenagers who don&#39;t seem to care about what they&#39;re serving up. 

I would eat here again, but only if I&#39;m being lazy, and don&#39;t feel like driving a bit further for a better joint. 

Hotdog joints are a dime a dozen, and you need to bring the quality. It doesn&#39;t take much to drive down the road to another one."

I had learned of this place from a coworker at my last job, as she was quite the fan. I was curious as to why she knew about it and I hadn&#39;t, despite living in Wheaton for 17 years or so. After trying it a few times, I grew to like the place and their vast menu.

After having my Friday afternoon off and being out and about in the area, I realized I needed something to eat, and fast. I immediately decided on Steamers, as I enjoy hotdogs but my fiance does not. So I decided I would indulge without guilt.

I ordered the hot dog special with everything, which is a hot dog with fries. That doesn&#39;t include a drink, so I decided to order a small Sprite (they had Sierra Mist instead). Much like my last experience elsewhere ordering a hot dog, I was asked if I wanted celery salt, but also the obligatory &#34;sport peppers?&#34; I really, REALLY wish places would assume that if one wants &#34;everything&#34; on their dog, they DO want celery salt and hot peppers. I know they&#39;re just doing their job but.... I was slightly irritated. I blame it on my hunger pains.

No sooner than I paid for my order and sat down, it was ready.the lunch rush was long gone and only a couple of other diners were left. I chose a booth next to a window, and was about to sit down when they called out my order.  I grabbed my tray, sat down, and took a photo of the &#39;dog. 

My hot dog  was a bit overloaded, to say the least. I guess that&#39;s a good thing, however I&#39;m not a fan of having to dislocate my jaw in order to eat something. I picked the pickle, cucumbers, and tomatoes off and ate them separately in order to eat the hot dog. No big deal really, I suppose it could have been worse with the hot dog lacking in toppings. The hot dog itself was quite delicious as my buddy Dan B. could tell you, so I won&#39;t elaborate. The fries were good and crispy and not overly salted, but between them and the hot dog, I was still hungry afterward. Nonetheless, I ate every crumb and disposed of my trash.

Usually I only get a hot dog and fries when I stop in here, but I&#39;ve also had their  mini chicken tacos, which remind me of similar ones you can buy in your grocer&#39;s freezer. But, they&#39;re a bit cheaper so that&#39;s a-okay in my book. It gets the job done.

As I left, I turned around to say thanks and the gentleman waved and said &#34;No, thank YOU! Have a great weekend!&#34; All of the employees that work here are extremely friendly, and not once have I been given a &#39;tude. You gotta admire that.

Definitely give this place a chance if you&#39;re looking for a good hot dog/beef/burger joint and don&#39;t feel like dealing with the tourists that swamp Portillo&#39;s from open &#39;til close."

This is your typical burger and hot dog place. A grease joint, if you will. They have other specialties, but stick to one of those because they are good.

Those who&#39;ve seen my Scooby&#39;s review know I was pretty rough on them.  I make no apologies.  You might disagree.  You might say comparing Steamers to Scooby&#39;s is comparing apples to oranges.  Two different animals?  The better comparison would be to Smoke House in Wheaton?  No.  Not really.  Not at all.  The only differences I see?  Scooby&#39;s has drive-thru and promotes the hot dogs harder.  And Steamers will sell you a beer.  They&#39;re both old hot dog joints underneath.  They sell dogs and Italian beef and Italian sausage and burgers.  Steamers does a gyro plate.  Tony has the map of Greece stamped on his round little puss.  So he sells gyros.

Two observations:  Steamers prices are appreciably cheaper.  My beef sandwich, fries and medium diet pop cost nine bucks and change.  Try $12 for the same meal at Scooby&#39;s.  The Scooby&#39;s guys constantly grouch at their teenagers to get out and mop the dining area and clean the tables.  They make a loud show of barking that order.  Steamers is immaculate inside.  Cleaner than Scooby&#39;s.  I didn&#39;t hear anyone shouted at.  I did see a young man wiping down tables, collecting trays.  Tony, behind the counter, wasn&#39;t riding the kid.  No need.  He was doing his job.

Let&#39;s talk about Tony for a moment.  I sat and ate my Italian beef and watched him work.  He&#39;s out front with the line staff and misses nothing.  He greets folks with a friendly enough hello.  If someone wants a beer, he handles the bar sale.  He has one eye on the line.  One eye scanning the dining area.  He looks back over his shoulder to check the Mexican kitchen staff.  If the order line gets a little long he says (in a normal voice), &#34;You guys okay?&#34;  The idea being he&#39;s ready to jump in and help if he&#39;s needed.  Let&#39;s talk about his staff.  Pleasant looking young people.  He has a Help Wanted sign just as Scooby&#39;s does.  High turn-over business.  He wants his hires over 21 and &#34;responsible.&#34;  Seems reasonable enough.  He must be a decent judge of talent.  Staff seems normal.  Seems to work for him.  

I may be all wrong.  Tony looks like he runs a tight ship.  We know the guys at Scooby&#39;s run a tight ship.  A Captain Queeg style tight ship.  A Jimmy Cagney in Mister Roberts tight ship.  Maybe Tony is a tyrant behind the scenes.  Maybe he&#39;s exactly like the old guys at Scooby&#39;s.  Wouldn&#39;t be the first time I&#39;ve been fooled.  My gut tells me that isn&#39;t the case.  There&#39;s no place to hide at Steamers.  It&#39;s all out in the open, in public view.  The man isn&#39;t shouting.  Staff isn&#39;t shouting.  Both places are high volume lunch operations.  Probably about the same level of efficiency.  They differ in their corporate cultures.  The tone of behavior set by Tony is more sane, more grown-up.  You get the impression he treats employees like adults.  Probably until they prove otherwise.  Steamer&#39;s is Cheaper than Scooby&#39;s.  Steamers is cleaner that Scooby&#39;s.  Steamer&#39;s is friendlier than Scooby&#39;s.  That&#39;s all."

- hotdogs were a solid &#34;good&#34;.  Not the best I&#39;ve had, but far from poor.  I get mine with just salt, mustard, and sport peppers.  They put 3 peppers on each, which is cool.  The bun could have been steamed a bit more (it seemed - at least with my order - they were just taken right out of the box - dry.  But, I also had a 10 minute trip home so they could have lost their edge that way, too).  The dogs were good - could have had a bit more &#39;zest&#39; to them.  They were 2.69 each - which is 30 cents cheaper than the very over-priced Scooby&#39;s in West Chicago.  

- Beef - great.  Nice flavor to it.  A bit over $5.00 (still almost $2 cheaper than Scooby&#39;s beefs which are 7.00 before tax).  It could have been a bit larger, but overall I liked it.

- Service was good.  I was out of there within 5 minutes of placing my order, and it was semi-crowded.

I would return again...."

These places rarely reach Portillo&#39;s levels of bliss, but can always be counted on for some reasonably priced greasy goodness.  

Tony Steamers is no different.  This place is a Winfield standard, and anyone who played little league in the area knows it well (WIA anyone?).  Expect your full menu of dogs, burgers, gyros and sandwiches, with plenty of deep fried appetizers to go around.

Reasons to go:
1. They have arcade machines
2. The hotdog special comes with loads of fries, and is not to be missed
3. They serve beer on tap (by the glass or pitcher)
4. I may or may not be addicted to pizza puffs

Perfect place to take kids after a baseball or soccer game."

My husband and I were forced to eat at this place once a week for about two months since it was the closest option near a class we were attending.  We tried just about everything on thier menu, and were underwhelmed time and time again.  

I guess I wouldn&#39;t be as disenchanted, but they overcharge you for what you&#39;re getting.  For example, they charge around $5 for cheese curds, and you only get about 8 of them.  When I asked where the rest of our order was, they said you get 4 oz.  This place seriously nickel and dimes you for everything.  Want a refill on your soda?  That will cost you too - $.54.

My advice to you (if you have the time) - drive to Portillos where you pay the same, but get way better quality food, or check out Smoke House in Wheaton."

I decided to stop in having never visited before and was impressed by the size of the restaurant. There was a Monopoly Pinball Machine, and giant gumball machine and a few other coin operated machines in the corner. The place looked clean and had several TVs attached to the walls.

I placed my order for a hot dog with fries, my food was ready quickly and I was soon on my way. The hot dog I received look like it had just been used to pose for Vienna Beef promotional material, it seriously didn&#39;t look real. The hot dog came on a soft poppy seed bun. The first thing to note besides the picture perfect presentation of this item is the pickle. The pickle included was a thin pickle slice rather than a pickle spear, its taste was a bit on the sour side but overall complimented the hot dog nicely. The celery salt was visible on this dog, and it came with cucumbers which you only see occasionally on Chicago style hot dogs. The relish and onions were well applied and the sausage itself was well heated and tasted great. The only real problem here was that there was a tad too much mustard.

The fries included were straight and thin fries, they have a nice taste not too greasy and not too salty. Two other hot dog vendors I&#39;ve visited have extremely similar fries (Mickey&#39;s in Villa Park and Jimmy&#39;s Dog House in Westmont). I&#39;ve noticed this particular type of fry compliments hot dogs very well.

 I was very impressed with Tony Steamers hot dog, the attention detail in making it look almost exactly like a hot dog shown on a Vienna Beef poster was definitely noticed by me, and was quite a surprise. And it lived up to my expectations in terms of taste. The price was reasonable at under 6.00 for my hot dog, fries and an extra large pop. Overall I&#39;d recommend Tony&#39;s Steamer&#39;s and will definitely visit again in the future."

Now that Smoke House in Wheaton has decided to serve crap instead of food, Tony&#39;s is one of the few spots I can depend on for a true Midwestern icon.  Ironically, it&#39;s close to Happy House in We-go, which is also fantastic!!

It gets pretty crowded during lunch time. Customers must order at the counter and there&#39;s usually a substantial wait before you get your food (even if it&#39;s to go). So if you&#39;re in a hurry, this isn&#39;t the place to go.

The food quality here is great though. If you want to get your grease on, Steamers will be a big hit.

I highly recommend their Bacon Cheeseburgers: all of the burger&#39;s ingredients are fresh. The bacon is particularly well-cooked, you will find no flaccid bacon here.

The Italian Beef portions are generous portions to feed the obese Chicagoland suburbanites. The Beef tastes alright, but it just doesn&#39;t knock my socks off. I&#39;d suggest going elsewhere if you&#39;re in search of some great Beef. The verdict is the same for Chicago Dogs at Steamer&#39;s: they are underwhelming in taste. However, the quality of ingredients in their dogs is very high.

I love the fries here. They&#39;re always crispy, thin and freshly hot.

Your average Beef and hot dog place.  When I was young ruffian in the mean streets of Winfield I ate here 3 times a week (7 in the summer).  Eventually I learned how to drive and my love affair with Steamers was kinda out the window.

I recommend the combo.  Good beef, good sausage.  They&#39;ve gone up in price since the good ole days (Winfieldites see the pun I just made) but they&#39;re still affordable.

The person at the counter was friendly. The prices are very reasonable. I decided to try the jumbo hot dog special which came with fries- they wrap them together which I kind of feel makes the fries soggier. I was disappointed when I got to work to find that they had added mustard to my hot dog (I had specifically asked just for certain ingredients) and it was a TON of mustard- I had to use 7 of their little napkins! It still was pretty tasty but I was disappointed that it wasn&#39;t what I had asked for. I think I will give this place another try but it didn&#39;t stand out to me over other similar places.

They also have &#34;healthier&#34; fare like chicken sandwiches and wraps, but sometimes you get tired of eating healthy and just want some grease!

One thing that I found kind of unique here was that I didn&#39;t see any Diet Coke on tap!  They had other beverages and cans, but no DC from the fountain.  They did have beer and lots of tvs, so I might have to come here to watch some sports and escape the pandemonium at home!"

Food&#39;s been great.  But then I decided to go there this evening for dinner and pick up food for my son and I.  First there is a guy who comes in behind me, walks back into the kitchen and starts making my food I just ordered without washing his hands.  Second, the other guy back in the kitchen keeps scratching his head while he&#39;s working with the food.  No gloves on at all.  I ordered two hot dogs, with everything, no peppers and fries for me, and a jumbo gyro plate for my son.  14$  Not too shabby, but a little high, considering what I got back for food tonight.  Usually, the gyro meet is towering.  Not so tonight.  4 slices of meat off the gyro spit and about 3 onions, one half slice of tomato and what looked like a enough sauce to put on a french fry.  Then he makes me one hot dog.  The girl who took my order turned and said, &#34;you ordered two, right&#34;, I said, &#34;yes&#34;.   I get home and the second hot dog that he made out of my line of sight had nothing on it.  I only live a mile or so away from this place, and when I got home and opened up the bag and found all these issues with the food, I had to sit down and write this.  I tried to go to the website on the menu to contact the owner somehow, but the website is a dead link.  I think that Tony&#39;s not going to be in business much longer if he&#39;s leaving his evening shift to this bunch.  The other girl was all decked out like she was from Jersey Shore, playing with her hair and her iPhone, picking at her zebra painted nails and not even noticing that there were customers there.  

So, if the owner of this place would ever like to contact me, please do.  We won&#39;t be coming back there in the evenings at all.  Maybe during the day...but if I do come back during the day time, he&#39;s getting an earful.  I&#39;m just ticked off that I spent 14 bucks and didn&#39;t get what I ordered.  

Oh, and another thing the owner needs to know.  Tell your workers that if they want to make fun of the clientele in Spanish, behind the counter... that some of us English speaking people actually understand Spanish and all of the slang that goes with it.  It is not repeatable here and wasn&#39;t very nice.  And what he was saying to the underage teenage girls that were running the register, wasn&#39;t very nice either.  Do they realize that there are laws about that?

To sum up... careful in the evenings.  If you don&#39;t mind your food being made by some guys who don&#39;t wash their hands and don&#39;t make your food to order, so that when you open it up when you get home you get upset...then stay away from here in the evening.  Go during the day time only."

We had the thin crust pizza.  It had a nice flavorful sauce and they put on plenty of cheese.  Enough where sometimes it&#39;s a bit of a mess.  I&#39;m heartened enough by it that I look forward to trying their non-pizza stuff.

It might be my #2 pizza for the area, though I should retry some other places.

The day we went they seemed to be having problems, hopefully that&#39;ll clear up.  I ended up waiting about 15 minutes or so beyond the stated time."

We found this place on Seamless or GrubHub or something and gave it a shot. The pizza was delicious and delivered quickly.

The second time, however, was probably one of the most infuriating experiences. So, a little backstory. My fiance had just had surgery and was home by himself. We ordered a pizza online because neither of us felt like cooking. We set it up to be delivered at 6:30 PM because I wanted to make sure I was home so he would not have to go down the stairs. At 5:58 I had a missed call (I was in traffic so didn&#39;t answer.) Then I got another call - I pulled over to answer. This time, it was a manager named Kevin who said that the driver couldn&#39;t find our apartment so he was leaving and they didn&#39;t know if they&#39;d be able to deliver our food since we didn&#39;t answer the phone.

Well, the driver ended up going back, and here&#39;s where things get interesting. My fiance goes down stairs to pay this guy and the driver snaps at him about giving them the wrong address - we did this shit online and the confirmation had the correct address - my fiance pays him and as the driver gets into his car, he tells my fiance to &#34;fuck off&#34;

OHHHHH HELL NO. I&#39;m sorry but that is one of the most unprofessional, douchey things to say. At least close your door before you say something that rude. Both my fiance and I called to talk to a manger, and I spoke with Kevin who basically said there was nothing he was willing to do because they always have problems with that driver and he would have the owner contact my fiance. 

Lo &amp; behold, still haven&#39;t heard from anyone. I&#39;m not looking for free anything, just acknowledgement that this was shitty. Emailed the owner twice, still nothing.

Sad to say, but we will not be ordering from here again unless we can be promised that the douchebag driver will not be our delivery guy."

Their pizzas pretty good, little too much cheese and not enough sauce. The crust is passable, but it really doesn&#39;t have any flavor. 

Getting a slice is the way togo. Their &#34;Cheesy Beef&#34; or Sausage is the way togo. 

They make an Antipasto Salad that could kick Chuck Norris hairy a$$. Get it with Greek dressing and you&#39;re good to go.

I really liked the crust and the sauce was nice.  I have to agree with the other reviewers - there was a bit too much cheese in the middle of the pie.  The proportions just didn&#39;t work for me.  The crust pieces were good though.

This pizza tasted like any good frozen pizza from the grocery store. Flavorless cracker-like crust. Lots of cheese and canned generic tasting sauce. For $20, I expect a lot more. This wasn&#39;t horrible but I can&#39;t say it was good either. The price is why it&#39;s rated so low.

The first time we went it was great. I had the pastrami and it was great. My son is 2 and he had a mac and cheese. This place is great for kids. All kids are $1 and they even have mini utensils. 

The 2nd time I had the popcorn shrimp which again was very good. However, my wife had a salad. The first one was not edible for my wife so they exchanged it for another which was better but still not great. 

The most recent time I again had the pastrami which seemed to be missing the mustard it had the first time. My wife had the turkey and it was extremely salty and she didn&#39;t eat it. My son got the kids chicken tenders which tasted Ok but at least half of them were extremely over cooked. I tried to eat one and it was insanely hard and overcooked. Very sad our experiences turned bad :( I don&#39;t think we will return again Did the chef change? Did they just stop caring? Not sure.."

The server let us sit in the golf simulator booth and put the Bulls game on the big simulator screen. Was almost like a movie theater screen. Great choices of tap beer and my boys loved the thanksgiving sliders. I had the shrimp po boy. Great flavor profiles on both meals. Cottage fries are some of the best I have had. A little pricy however. Have been back 4 times and will continue to go. Never very crowded which appeals to me but maybe not to someone looking for some social interaction.

I went with a $20 Groupon, quite honestly not expecting much...I mean, its attached to a corporate/hotel type complex, thinking maybe it really just catered to a lunchtime crowd and hotel guests who would really eat anything. The place wasn&#39;t very happening when we arrived on a Friday night around 7pm, so my first thought naturally was &#34;Great we&#39;ll get reheated crap because the kitchen staff is being sent home.&#34;

It&#39;s a short but concise menu: sandwiches, a few hearty entrees, some pizzas, and apps. The appetizers cover a wide array (potato skins, beef/mushroom bites, tacos, wings), and we opted for the skins. You get three different kinds (buffalo chicken, steak/blue cheese, and another that I couldn&#39;t really figure out), so its good to share with another person. If you have more than one person, I wouldn&#39;t share, because you&#39;ll want to try all three. The potato was crispy and warm and had plentiful toppings. I would order this again, but would be interested to try the food truck tacos or beef/mushroom bites!

I ordered the Thanksgiving Sliders and hubz ordered the Skillet Cheeseburger. Both meals came out on a wood plank with awesome presentation (see picture). I&#39;m not always huge on sliders because I feel like you end up getting more bun than meat, but it worked really well for these. It was fresh carved turkey, cranberry sauce, a heaping pile of sage stuffing on each slider, and some kind of creamy, fruity mayo or cream cheese or sauce on the bottom. Whatever it was...It was thanksgiving in my mouth! The varying textures worked so well together. I was full after the first two and took the third one home (tasted just as good the next day). I would absolutely recommend these. Hubz really enjoyed his cheeseburger...it was cooked med-rare (just the way he liked it) and served with gooey cheese and on a pretzel bun. Both were served with their cottage fries (like really thick chip-fries) in a little basket, very delicious and not soggy at all (if you&#39;ve had the chip-fries at Quigley&#39;s in Naperville, you know what I&#39;m talking about when I say &#34;soggy&#34;). And to boot, both came with a little pickle jar! It had 4-5 different pickles in a tiny little Mason jar, how cute is that?!

For the size of the bar, it had some good beer options. I mean really, only 6 drafts, but they had the local options like Solemn Oath and Two Brothers, so I appreciate that. They also have some craft bottles and tall boys of the cheap stuff to match every flavor. They have some whiskeys there for the liquor folks, and a small menu of interesting mixed drinks to boot (something with mint and madagascar vanilla and cherry...hmmmm).

I can&#39;t wait to order the chili next time, and would love to try their pizza buffet over lunch someday. Other reviews have said that they have a &#34;creamier&#34; type of cheese, which leads me to believe its kind of like St. Louis style (aka IMO&#39;S), which I LOVE. If the open-faced turkey sandwich is as good as the sliders, I would definitely get that too, on a warm snowy day. And if you love stuffing, I&#39;d order up a side of their sage version of this. It was the perfect consistency and flavor. 

Also...after we arrived, the place filled up pretty quickly. I&#39;m glad this place is getting some business!"

They have a decent beer selection and a menu filled with tasty bar food. The Skillet Cheeseburger is fantastic and the fresh cut Cottage Fries are addictive. I have never seen them truly busy, so I wonder how long they will last. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the service can be slow at times, but I think this is partially due to the place not being very busy."

Had a Groupon so decided to give the place a try. we started with the rib tips as an app, which was the best part of the meal, but also led us to cancel another item. The rib tips were good, but very messy. You pretty much have to eat these with your hands. Sauce had a nice tang to it. The rib tips were garnished with cole slaw though, and the cole slow was kinda soggy and very salty. 

My sweetie had ordered a $5 side of cole slaw with his meal, and after we tasted the cole slaw garnish for the rib tips he cancelled that portion of his meal. He had an Italian beef that was very very average - many hot dog places offer better. He was able to sub mashed taters for cottage fries, and he did not care for them - lumpy taters and bland gravy.

I had the Thanksgiving sliders - too much sage dressing and not enough meat. Also, these sliders are dressed with a cranberry jam which was not good - much too tart. They should just use regular cranberry sauce instead. I ended up not eating much of the buns because that sour jam had soaked into them. I received cottage fries that would have been much better straight outta the frier.

Sandwiches were served with a small jar of pickles - unique and a nice touch. Unfortunately I enjoyed the pickles much more than the sandwich. 

Service - kinda slow, but that waas OK since we were looking to relax. 

I would maybe go back because I did have a hard time deciding between several options, and there were some daily specials that sounded interesting. But I would definitely would need another Groupon to entice me as it was just OK. Had I paid full price I would have been more disappointed."

I&#39;m sorry, but CityGate may have been a good idea in its time, but the economy has made the entire complex a great big fizzle.

It was quite surprising upon arriving to find that the TV&#39;s were on ESPN pre season football coverage instead of the PGA Championship. I asked if we could switch the TV&#39;s to the major championship golf. It took them around 10 minutes to change it. They did not know what channel it was on. 

I ordered Beef &amp; Mushroom Bites. The were 7/10. crispy somewhat flavorful.
My wide ordered the Thanksgiving Sliders. Those were 9/10. Great presentation and flavor. The turkey sliders went down nice and easy with the cranberry glaze. The fries were nice and crisp and came in a little basket.

The waitress was not familiar with the beers on top. She was unable to provide the name of a certain beer on tap only that it was an IPA. I had to find our from overhearing the bar tender about the exact name.

The food sounded good and it seemed like it could be a good place to have a family dinner with mostly adults but two little ones coming along.  I&#39;m glad I took the leap and visited here as were my sister, brother, and their spouses.

We visited last Sat night.  As we pulled up the restaurant looked to be pretty empty, which was fine by us, since we had the kiddos in tow.  I&#39;m always glad to visit places that are slightly less noisy with my nephews!  There were a few tables occupied in the seated area and a few more people in the bar area but that was it.  I&#39;m glad I read reviews before the visit or I would have been scared!

We were quickly seated and a waitress came and took our drink order. My sis and I had the Angry Orchard Elderflower ($4.25), my brother-in-law was thrilled to order a Schlitz, sister-in-law a Miller Light, and my brother a PBR.  We are a very classy group as you can tell!  Drinks were quickly delivered to the table along with water and our orders were taken.

I had the Skillet Cheese Burger for my dinner, it is a beef patty with Colby cheese on a Pretzel Roll.  If you know me, you know my obsession with Pretzel buns, so I was beyond thrilled to find this!  I ordered the burger medium and it was moist and well seasoned.  The burger comes with fries which are thick cut and sliced like a potato chip.  The fries were really good and I ate my share and a few of my nephew&#39;s too. 

Added bonus, kids meals are $1!  It was nice for my brother that it didn&#39;t cost $8-10 to feed a finicky 2  1/2 yr old.  Great idea and wished that more places adopted this!

I tried a few other bites of food from the family as well.  The food truck tacos were amazing, the pork was moist and well seasoned  The taco wasn&#39;t spicy at all and was a perfect appetizer portion to share.  My brother-in-law raved about his chili, he ordered a bowl and we all got a taste, it was very good and I can&#39;t wait to order it on a cold day this winter.  Finally, I got to try a few bites of the Sausage Pizza; the sausage was amazing, but there was an odd taste to the pizza.  I&#39;m not sure if it was the cheese or the sauce, but it had a bit of a tangy flavor kind of like cream cheese to it... I wasn&#39;t a big fan of that flavor but others at the table didn&#39;t mind it.

I would definitely recommend coming here for a few drinks and dinner.  I am kind of in love with the fact that the place was less than busy when we went... I&#39;m sure after everyone starts reading these Yelp reviews, people are going to get smart and visit in droves.  Can&#39;t wait to visit again!"

We did a small work event here and it was great. We ordered a bunch of pizzas and apps and then obviously had drinks with everything. Agree with the other reviewers...prices are very reasonable, it&#39;s a nice atmosphere, the staff was really cool, and the food was really quite tasty--it&#39;s nice to go to a pub and not get a frozen pizza but the REAL deal. 

To anyone from the pub who is reading this....you guys should do more marketing in the office buildings across the street. There is so much untapped (no pun intended) business over there.

We were informed that some of the beer was bottled, not on tap. That&#39;s fine, but at no point did the waitress ask us if we wanted a glass...we had to ask her twice. Through out our time, we had to ask for refills of beer and water....not a good sign. We then ordered food. The food was OK, no one got sick or complained it tasted funny, but it was definately nothing to write home about. Lastly, when our bill came, we asked to have it split 4 ways (4 couples), the waitress flat out told us &#34;no&#34;. So we all put our credit cards in the sleeve anyway. She charged us equal amounts 4 ways. so if our bill was $100.00, she charged $25.00 to each card. How is that fair? I&#39;m not sure if she was just stupid or what, but we ended up figuring out the math after the fact. (yay for knowing 3rd grade math!!) We will not be back."

The reviews looked good, so my husband, three year-old daughter, and I tried it out tonight.

The waitstaff was great and the food was excellent.  Bar food at its finest.  I had the veggie sandwich and my husband had the Thanksgiving sliders.  Each was served with homemade fries and pickles.  Yum!  The attention to detail and presentation of the food was great.  Our daughter had the chicken fingers, which were real meat.  She was also served homemade apple sauce, carrot sticks and a couple of the homemade fries.  Best of all, children under five eat for only $1.

We each splurged on a mixed drink, which were very tasty.  Prices were a bit high for the drinks, but it&#39;s a bar, so it&#39;s to be expected.  Prices on the food were reasonable. 

We moved out of Chicago about a year ago and truly miss the foodie experience that is so readily available there.  Tap In&#39;s food reminded us of Chicago and what we miss.  We will definitely be back.  Our biggest concern is its location- commercial property that was very quiet on a Saturday.  Please give this place a try so that it can stay in business!"

Decided to drop in on a Friday after work to see what they had to offer.  I thought with a name like  the Tap In Pub, there would be a lot if beer on tap.  No dice. Only 4 beers, but 3 of them are local breweries. (fyi:  tap-in is also a golf reference.  D&#39;oh!).  Had the Solemn Oath, which not many places carry and it was pretty tasty.  They also carry a large variety of bottled beer and do offer daily specials (Friday was a bucket of Coors Light gernades).  What they lack in draft beers, the bartender Melissa more than made up in personality (an angler, really?!?!?). They also offer a full bar, which was a surprise since the place us so small.   Beers seemed a little pricey, but it is in City Gate, so kinda expected that.  I was surprised by the pizza, which was actually pretty good.  They do have a separate dining area if you&#39;re looking for a sit down meal.  The menu consists of what I&#39;d call pub food.  The sandwiches looked good, but didn&#39;t try one. For a Friday after work, there weren&#39;t many people.  One large group and a couple at the bar.  A few others came in, but the place remained relatively quiet.  If you&#39;re looking for nice relaxing quiet place to wind down after a long week, this would be it.  Good food, a good bartender and a relaxed atmosphere."

We set at the bar and we ordered beer and food (pizza, burger and a side). The service was perfect but what really pleased us was the food. You can easily tell that the food was cooked with care and the materials were of high quality, despite the reasonable price.
The pizza was amazing and the white cheddar mac&amp;cheese side as well. 
The one downside is the ambient, a little sterile and uninviting, not very pub like but once you get your food delivered, you easily forget about it.
Can wait to go back and dine outside on a nice weather night.
Highly recommend this place."

Unlike most Yelp Egomaniac Morons, I sell food to restaurants so I know what it takes to succeed in this challenging biz. Only a few visits to this extremely friendly pub (I don&#39;t think you should review a business based one just one visit) and so far... spot on service, not to loud and amazing food and food presentation. I just had the Thanksgiving sliders and they were so unique and delicious. The fries/chips are so good and cruchy and the pickles were great as well. This is the type of place where the service, atmosphere and food are all so good that reasonable, nice and classy people don&#39;t even look at the prices.

We were not expecting much, as it is in an unassuming location.  We were surprised by the quality of the food.  I had the &#39;neck-down turkey&#39; which I would give a 9/10.  I asked for a side of the cranberry that came with the thanksgiving sliders on a whim and it really jazzed up the meal.  Others at the table had the Roast Beef dinner, also a delicious option (probably a 9 as well).  The Thanksgiving Sliders that my brother shared with his fiancé had an amazing presentation, with a really cool small basket that the potatoes came in and served on a cutting board.  The Chicago pizza was also surprisingly good, which is an homage to Chicago roast beef sandwiches and NOT traditional Chi-town deep dish.  Still, the crust was crisp and the toppings were generous.  Overall it was a great experience with a great Hawks victory.  Oh, and they also had the audio on for the game, which is a major plus.  We will definitely return."

Then that dream came true when I visited Yu&#39;s Bistro last night. 

Tucked away in an unassuming shopping center, you almost don&#39;t realize you&#39;re passing a restaurant until you spot it. But do yourself a favor, stop in and sample some of the amazing food. We tried out the potstickers, which were fresh, crispy and delicious, and we each had an order of pad thai. If you&#39;ve followed my reviews, you may be familiar with my frustration with a lack of good pad thai anywhere around. I finally found the best, and if that means driving to Naperville to have it each time a craving hits, then so be it! The food is full of flavor, with just the right amount of tang. It&#39;s perfect.

New owners took over the restaurant in November 2015, so they&#39;re slowly making changes to both the restaurant itself and the menu, bringing in more thai specialities and changing things up. 

But the thing about Yu&#39;s that&#39;s different from any other restaurant is the way you feel. It&#39;s like coming home to a place you didn&#39;t know you missed. The server/hostes, Nancy is the friendliest lady you&#39;ll ever meet. She greets you warmly and takes care of you throughout your meal, making sure you&#39;re comfortable and have everything you need. The owners come out and chat with you and really treat you with care. I&#39;ve never said this about an establishment before, but you can feel the love that was put into the restaurant and it really shines when the owners come out to visit. 

The decor is simple, but attractive and the dining room is spotless. They use paper on all the tables to keep things clean for each of the customers. The booths are very comfortable and roomy, but tall so there&#39;s also a sense of privacy. 

All in all, I look forward to visiting again and sampling more of the food. We played it safe last night, but now that we know we love it, we&#39;ll be back to try new things. Now that the construction on Route 59 is complete, it&#39;s easy to hop off I-88 and find your way to Yu&#39;s. In fact, let me know when you&#39;re going and I will meet &#34;Yu&#34; there."

Ambiance:- 3 out of 5
This is one of the better ratings for this restaurant but still just ok. The place is decorated jsut like your typical chinese restaurant.

Service:- 3 out of 5
Service is typical of your regular Chinese restaurant. Our server is helpful.and friendly, explained the menu and check back with us promptly when the food came.

Food: -2 out of 5
This is the coup de gras. We order the few dishes we use to order here, They spicy beef and maw, fish fillet stew, and Spicy Shichuan chicken. When the food came, we immediately notice the portion has been reduced. Well, no biggy, we understand....there&#39;s inflation and it&#39;s an business decision. But then when we eat our food, we felt the taste has completed changed and the flavor is not just not changed but they were not flavorful and to us it felt tlike all it is now was just spicy, now wait a second you said, its Shichuan food, it meant to be spicy. Yes but then again, it should maintain some flavor and standard as well, which we found are totally missing.

Bottomline: 
I will not come back and do not recommend this place to others. Other restaurant in town like the one just opened recently at west Naperville is probably a better choice.I&#39;m not endorsing other restaurant, just making a comparison.

It&#39;s a little bother sum that she didn&#39;t wash her hands prior to returning, knowing that we consume that food. 
Nevertheless, I looked through the menu and found the lunch special. I came 3mins before it ended, it was a sign. I got the garlic shrimp. Since it was a lunch special, it came with soup, a spring roll, and rice all for $10. 
The soup was great! I ordered the hot and soup-- not gonna lie, I wish it had a little bit of a kick to it, but nothing a little hot paste doesn&#39;t solve. The food finally arrived, and it was a large size portion. The spring roll was gross, do not recommend trying it!! The fried rice was good! And the garlic shrimp tasted more like shrimp in lobster sauce. It was very flavorful and had a great assortment of veggies. I wish it would have had more garlic in it. 

I will definitely be back to try something else on the menu. I think I may omit all the snow peas in the future."

Crispy Chicken in Garlic Sauce $11 - This dish was ok for me but might be good if you like just 1 ingredient (chicken).  The chicken pieces are breaded and deep fried and then covered in sauce.  I like to have other veggies with my protein.

I can only assume people where paid for rating this place a 4. Unless you eat out of a garbage dump, you cannot like this place. 

between the 4 of us we had Egg drop soup, and wonton. Everyone had the same tasteless soup. Basically bad campbells, with nothing else in it. I did have 1 wonton just tasteless. 

Next we all got the appetizers add on to the meals. You get a spring roll, fried shrimp, and crab rangoon. The springroll was just cabbage, no taste. The fried shrimp was just mush and tasteless. The crab rangoon was not the best I have ever had but the cream cheese was by far the best thing on the menu. 

I got the mongolian Beef. If your going to call it a beef dish you need to actually have more beef than onions. The beef and onions are cooked but that is it. No salt, pepper, garlic, oil, hot pepper, random sauce etc. No flavor can be used it this cooking. The others had Kung pao shrimp, and pork dish that also just had no flavor at all. The orange chicken did have flavor..... sugar.... lots of sugar... enough to kill a horse. 

On a side not my dish came with pork friend rice.Here is a thought if its pork fried rice you actually need to put pork in it!!! It was rice and soy sauce. No vegetables, pork, anything. 

please do not waste your time with this place."

The service was decent, the decor is ok, but the food was lackluster. The restaurant was oddly empty......as I&#39;ve read in other reviews. Also, the fish tank concerned me. It&#39;s a big tank with some large koi fish and it greets you as you walk in, but the water is filthy and murky. It&#39;s so murky, you can&#39;t see through it.......eeeeuuuu. So, as for the food, I&#39;m not even comparing them to Chinese restaurants that we frequent in Chicago, I&#39;m just comparing them to the Chinese restaurants in this suburban area......Katy&#39;s Dumplings, Chinese Kitchen, and etc. In our opinion, Yu&#39;s was basically a waste of money. 

We both got lunch specials which come with a veggie spring roll, soup, and fried or steamed rice. My husband had orange chicken and I had Mongolian beef. The veggie spring rolls just weren&#39;t very tasty and the duck sauce was not very flavorful. Our next course was soup. I had wonton and my husband had egg drop. The egg drop soup was awful.....and it had corn in it. My husband said that it tasted &#34;corny&#34;....which we&#39;ve never seen corn in egg drop soup before. The wonton soup was awful as well. The broth was flavorless and the wontons were small. Both of our soups were just hard to eat, so after 2-3 spoons, neither of us ate anymore soup. The spring rolls and soups were very low quality.  

The Mongolian beef was actually very good. It was the most flavorful dish we had. I saw that some other reviews were praising Yu&#39;s &#34;authentic&#34; dishes, so maybe the Mongolian beef falls into that category because it was really good. The orange chicken wasn&#39;t very good. It was fried chicken chunks and it was fried so hard that many of the pieces were hard to puncture with the fork. The fried rice was very average.

I cannot tell you which dishes we ordered other than the cumin lamb (my choice).

I have been here a couple of other times, so at least four total.  Yu&#39;s provides very good Chinese fare and I will certainly go back when I have a chance.  It is a little obscure, so if you go to the address be aware that you need to approach it from the east parking lots because there is no access from IL-59.  Another heads up, the times I have been there in the winter, it was cold inside, so dress warm.

Probably because of language barrier, it can be a little quirky, and by the way, my Mandarin Chinese is non-existent, so the blame is not on them.  Nevertheless things always seem to work out.  For lunch Ms T decided on eggrolls and sizzling rice soup and I chose Szechuan dumplings and Hot and sour soup.  When Ms T ordered the sizzling rice soup and egg roll, we were told this soup is for two.  The lady left, so, so much for my hot and sour soup and dumplings, but OK.  She brought the sizzling rice and two bowls.  The soup was OK for what it is, fairly bland but that is the nature of this soup.  The lady was right, there was plenty of soup for two.  Then she brought the egg rolls and THEN she asked me what I wanted.  This was a little strange.  Ms T had all of her food before I was asked what I wanted.  There was plenty of soup for two so I just ordered those dumplings that I like.  We still had soup left when my dumplings arrived, so I added them to my soup along with some of the chili sauce they were in and some hot mustard.  Now I had really good soup.  It is pretty common for me to do some &#34;cooking&#34; with soups at the table.  These dumplings are smothered in a good, oily chili sauce.  They are great as served, but are an awesome addition to soup.  

We have always had good meals at Yu&#39;s and while I have not kept immaculate records, I particularly like a beef (or was it pork?) dish with loads of jalapeno chiles.  They have a huge menu including things you normally find and things that you may not have seen.  If you go in cold weather, get some soup to warm you up."

This is our go-to Chinese spot. Sure, the food has taken a bit longer than normal to come out, but when it does its awesome, everything we&#39;ve gotten here. Even the soups are great, and I&#39;m picky in that arena. And last but not least, their prices are way under what you would expect for the quality and portion size. Yep, not everyone in there speaks English, but that&#39;s not an issue with me for what i get out of the place. Once again, this is our go-to place for Chinese. Give it a try."

It was just the right amount of spice (more on the spicy side), and it wasn&#39;t soggy at all, which I hate when I am eating dry chili chicken. 

Every once in awhile I notice inconsistency with the dish (quantity, chicken/chili ratio, etc.) which is why I&#39;m not giving it 5 stars."

Got the pot stickers, chicken with green bean, salt and pepper shrimp, beef chow fun,  white fish filet, wok fried tofu, and sesame sweet balls.  My daughter loves sesame balls and besides China Town we can never find it.  She loved them so that alone will make me come back.  But they surprisingly served a lot of meat with their meat dishes.  The tofu had a very good sweet basil sauce.  The string beans were nice and crisp. The shrimp was bigger with not a lot of breading which is good.  The beef chow fun and sole fish filet were made just the way I like them.  Everything was very tasty.  Gotta say it&#39;s just a tad more expensive than other Chinese restaurants but not overly that it would stop me from coming back.  The service was very efficient and we got our food very fast.

My husband unknowingly order an appetizer that he couldn&#39;t eat(not that it tasted bad) they so kindly took it off the bill(we didn&#39;t even request that).

We had been regulars at their Oakbrook restaurant for the last16 years.  Their customer service is outstanding and they instill their attention to detail and genuine friendliness in their staff too.
Although it is much farther for us, the ride was well worth it.  The menu is extensive and focuses on Szechuan dishes.  However they also serve some of my favorite Thai noodle dishes like Kao Soy, Pad Kee Mao and Pad Thai. We started out with chicken lettuce wraps, which could be a meal in itself.  In fact there are so many appetizer choices, the next time ( Yes, there will be a next time.) I am tempted to just order them. The salt and pepper. Japanese styled tofu are golden round pillows of softness with a crispy coating on the outside garnished with minced jalapeños, green peppers and onions.  Next was the Kao Soy that I had been craving with the two types of noodles and the yellow curry sauce I remembered so well.  My daughter ordered Pad Kee Mao, because she loves the crispy fried rice noodles.  The portions are large and so we had to prioritize what we would finish at the restaurant and what we would take home.  We settled on taking the two noodle dishes home, as they would reheat the best.  We finished off with the sesame rice balls.  Usually I am not a fan but these were made on site, were not overly sweet, nor greasy.
Mike and Nancy have applied for a liquor license but until it is approved, it is BYOB.  I would recommend people try Yu&#39;s Bistro.  The food is authentic and the service can&#39;t be beat!"

The scallops in garlic sauce themselves would be enough to keep me coming back for more.  I was expecting garlic butter covering some scallops with a heaping off veggies, but what I got was a heaping of scallops and tasty mushrooms in a unfamiliar but very tasty sauce that carried a garlic flavor!

The SO and I also tried the beef and beans (I can&#39;t remember the exact dish name) that almost tasted a little like dan-dan, but were simple and very tasty.

The meal came with a nice helping of well-cooked white rice and plenty of food, hot tea, and water.  The food was prepared very quickly and pretty close together - though in 2 separate trips.

The bill and prices are all reasonable and the restaurant was clean (despite a few non-obtrusive but un-bussed tables - see the next comment).  Definitely a place I have no problem dropping in to.

I can&#39;t complain per-say, but I did feel a bit bad for the one waitress (/owner I&#39;d guess).  She was working super hard to take care of the register, phone orders, 2 large family tables, 2 smaller tables, and our pair.  Basic things took a little longer because of that, but she was very helpful, and we never had to ask twice for anything.  This could be because it was late on a Sunday night, but I might think about calling your order in if you are in a rush.

No matter what though... GREAT food and I will be back!"

Most spicy dishes are pretty comparable between these two. The outstanding service in Yu&#39;s definitely beats Lao Sichuan.

There are a few usual items we order: Scallion Pancakes, Dry Stir Fried Green Beans , Dried Chili Diced Chicken, and a fish dish. We also loved the Fish head soup which requires to call ahead to order since it takes a longer time to prepare. Every time we ate here, they were able to deliver the same great quality dishes. 

The service was always really warm and attentive. The owner always stopped a few time to talk to us. She recommended  their new dishes, made sure we liked what we got, and just chitchatted a bit. Actually, you could let her know what you like or want to try, she might come up with something to surprise you.

The service is quick and friendly, and we almost always get a complimentary something! Owners have recently changed and I think the restaurant has been remodeled (floors), but decor is still casual and bright, not very fancy or overly stereotypical Chinese. My parents, husband, and I came here for dinner on Saturday night. I&#39;ve been craving soups a lot and generally order a single cup of hot &amp; sour soup when out with my husband since he&#39;s not a fan. But my parents are fans of soup so I tried to order a large bowl of H&amp;S soup but the waitress gave us a recommendation! I&#39;m generally wary of Chinese restaurant waitress recommendations (as I&#39;ve found it to be more of a this-inventory-needs-to-be-moved-asap type deal than a this-is-really-delicious thing). She told us that if we were going to order a large bowl of soup, we should go for a specialty soup since those are prepared to ordered whereas the H&amp;S soup is premade in a big vat and sits there all day. We decided to order the west lake beef soup. Great choice! There was enough soup for 2 bowls each (4 people). Not sure how much it was, probably a couple bucks more than the large H&amp;S soup but worth it!

We also ordered 2 appetizers: fu qi fei pian (i think it&#39;s this one on the menu -- &#34;SLICED BEEF &amp; MAW IN CHILI SAUCE&#34;. Luckily it was more beef than maw!!) and some sort of spicy bean jelly. Both were spicy and delicious. Portion size was great. We then ordered 2 dishes: stir fried spinach and kung pao beef. Generally we order one dish per person but the waitress insisted it was sufficient, and it was! We even had leftovers. Halfway through the meal she brought us complimentary fried pumpkin cakes. They were so good and chewy. The texture was kind of like pumpkin mochi, except they were breaded and fried. My husband doesn&#39;t like mochi so two for me, yay!

The restaurant was maybe 50% full on a late Saturday night, most,if not all, patrons were Chinese. Prices are a little cheaper here, but then again, husband and I are used to prices from a little more up north/east (Chef Pings, Yu&#39;s Mandarin, Asian Bistro). We will make it a point to dine at Yu&#39;s Bistro more often when visiting my parents in Naperville!

This place used to have dimsum on the weekends (under prior owners), but not sure if that&#39;s the case anymore. We forgot to ask. It&#39;s unfortunate if there is no more dimsum since the closest location would be in International Mall in Westmont."

The order came late and was wrong and missing an item.  30 minutes later the missing item added. The wrong dish wasn&#39;t replaced but a promise of &#34;we&#39;ll try again&#34; wasn&#39;t worth the wait. I could hear people eating at the tables complaining that their orders weren&#39;t complete.  Another person who had take out and came in just after I did still hadn&#39;t received his order.

Food wise you cannot go wrong. Shaved noodles were great with Beef. All of the soups are very tasty. Most of the food I got was because I told the staff what I like and they just made something, so I have no idea what the names were. Even the kids got some really good chicken that they loved. 

The ambiance is standard fare, nothing special.

Yu&#39;s has all of these items, but they also have 4 other pages of more unique dishes including a handwritten special menu that seems to change from time to time depending on what they have on hand and hotpots (love those).  

This particular visit, I was feeling dumplings.  I wasn&#39;t sure which ones to go with as Yu&#39;s has a few to choose from, but my waitress was happy to recommend Szechaun Dumplings seeing as I like things on the spicier side.

First visit: May 2014.  Ordered takeout on a Sunday evening.  Ready quickly.  We had crab rangoon, moo shu chicken, and combo lo mein.  Food was fairly good.  Price could have been a little less for how it tasted.

Second visit: August 16, 2014.  We were skeptical after reading all the negative reviews following the change in ownership.  Decided to try it just to see if they were true.  Our takeout order was ready in 15 minutes, so it didn&#39;t take an obscene amount of time like some reviewers said.  However, we were very disappointed with the food.  We ordered the exact same items we had in May: crab rangoon, moo shu chicken, and combo lo mein.

Crab rangoon: it&#39;s now dry, too hard, and pretty obvious they didn&#39;t make it in the restaurant.

Combo lo mein: SUPER greasy, very little meat.  Mostly noodles.  This dish actually made my husband ill shorty after eating it.

Moo shu chicken: the dish looked the same as it did in May, but we were given only about a tablespoon total of the sauce.  Plus, the sauce tasted way off, like soy sauce that had sugar mixed with it.

Unfortunately, we won&#39;t be going back again.  So disappointed after our more positive experience in May.  The Yelp reviewers were right: change in management = no longer the great Yu&#39;s."

The unfortunate thing is that this place keeps getting sold to different management / chefs and in a nut shell it is either a Feast Or Famine.  Still it remains to be one of the more authentic restaurants serving food in the area.

Over the years, the quality of food has consistently gone down.  It still stays good amount for the money but the taste has really been only a fraction of what it used to be.  

Btw, if you have a Mandarin speaking person with you, I have seen that it usually is better.  I would not think that it is because they are biased but it seems like they feel more comfortable asking specifics on how that dish needs to be flavored."

Party ordered Spring Rolls, Pot Stickers, Moo Shu Pork, Lamb, Kung Pow Chicken, Orange Chicken.

The Spring rolls and Pot Stickers were both drop dead boring.  No flavor inside the Pot Stickers or Spring Rolls.  Thankfully the sauces were okay.

I&#39;ve always maintained that a Chinese restaurant should always be able to prepare a decent Kung Pow or Orange Chicken.  Yu&#39;s failed miserably on both these dishes.  No flavor whatsoever combined with overcooked chicken.  Throwing red peppers on top at the end is not seasoning Kung Pow guys!  I had to bite into a red pepper and then use the heat for the next couple mouthfuls just to get a little taste.  Easily the worst Kung Pow I&#39;ve had in 40 years.

The Orange Chicken was also tasteless with almost no orange flavor anywhere.  The diner said they&#39;d had better at Panda Express!! Ouch.

The Lamb dish was okay, and had some flavor.

The Moo Shu Pork also was okay.

Didn&#39;t get the hot pot... probably should have given all the other reviews.

If you&#39;ve not had hot pot, think savory fondue broth, either veggie based or spicy chili based. You can choose both, with a divider.

Here&#39;s the list of what we got for the hot pot:
shrimp
lamb
2 types of mushroom - enoki and something else
napa cabbage
chinese spinach
thin vermicelli noodles
thick fresh pulled noodles 
squid
tofu skin looking thing
fish fillets

The sauce/pastes were pretty good - not too salty - but you could eat the food standalone too. By the end of the meal, you finish it off by spooning out some broth - so many rich flavors and nutrients mm. 

My fav was the fish fillets - v. tender."

We had sauteed fish fillet and stewed beef noodle soup.  The dishes were too salty for our taste.  The hostess was nice and offered up a complimentary egg drop soup.  The stewed beef noodle soup was mixed up as a beef tendon noodle soup, so they brought out a bowl of beef stew to correct the order.

Logistically, the restaurant is large and roomy and has very convenient parking off of Route 59 in both the front and back of the restaurant.  It might be logistically good for a big group dinner if that&#39;s in the offing for anyone.

Every time we come here, we&#39;re one of a few tables and it&#39;s so quiet. I don&#39;t know why this is since the food is really good and you get large portions. 

I am in love with the boiled fish here. Large pieces of tender white fish (cod?) are served in a spicy red chili oil with napa, celery, and scallions. It&#39;s comfortably spicy, not tongue-numbingly spicy, which is not enjoyable to me. 

I also really like their Szechuan string beans, sliced beef and maw in chili sauce, and dry chili chicken. 

Definitely a keeper. They also offer hot pot which I would like to try since it&#39;s the season for it now."

Upon entering the restaurant, the owner greeted my parents like old friends.  I had to ask my Dad how often they came here and he replied, &#34;Only every once in a while.&#34; lol  The woman was very friendly and the very epitome of &#34;front of the house&#34; personality (in a good way)!

Normally, at a Chinese restuarant we let my parents do the ordering since I&#39;m first generation, American-born Chinese and my parents can of course actually read the Chinese characters on the menu.  But this time they let the owner recommend some dishes, and I was surprised because they were the more &#34;Americanized&#34; dishes, not the traditional dishes they usually order for themselves.

We started with the szechaun beef jerky which was good and not as spicy as I thought it woudl be.  We had the honey walnut shrimp, which I typically don&#39;t like because this dish is usually too sweet for my taste.  But I enjoyed this version.  It was still sweet, but not too sweet.  And the shrimp were very good size.  We also had the orange chicken and pork fried rice, which were both exactly what you would expect.  They were above average, but again, it&#39;s orange chicken and pork fried rice.  We also had bbq pork shaved noodles which was really good.  The noodles were awesome!   And for veggies we had chicken and string beans, which was good and my favorite the Chinese version of collard greens in garlic sauce.  I don&#39;t really know what the veggie is, but it looks like collard greens, but not as leafy.  (I know total epic fail to my culture here! lol)  Regardless, they were awesome... fresh and not overcooked like I have found at other places.  Prices were very reasonable, and portions were generous.

And finally, the reason why Yu&#39;s got 5 stars instead of 4 stars, the owner got our son to eat all his veggies, as everytime she would come by, she would point out a veggie on his plate and said, &#34;You have to eat your veggies!&#34;  Love it!  As a &#34;prize&#34; for eating all his veggies, she gave us a plate of steamed pork dumplings on the house.  They were good and I&#39;m excited to come back both for dinner and also to try the dim sum they do on weekend mornings."

$20/pp for an absolutely delicious and filling hotpot experience, complete with the owner of the restaurant teaching you how to cook every single ingredient.

Haven&#39;t tried any of the other dishes, but given how good the hotpot was, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever get the chance to.

Get the $17/pp seafood hotpot on the back of the menu. It comes with spinach, cabbage, shrimp, fish, lamb, beef, chicken, noodles, tofu, fish balls, tripe.

In my opinion, the best ingredients were: tripe, fish balls, lamb, fish, beef, cabbage (in that order) cooked in the spicy broth.

We ended up ordering 5 spice beef, scallion pancakes, Szechuan string beans, basil tofu, chili beef, and dried chili chicken. All were winners and reasonably priced and service was top notch.

I was recommended the &#34;dumplings with red oil&#34; dish to start things of; terrible translation I know, but it was amazing. Oh, it is called Szechuan Won Ton. The dumplings are VERY soft, so picking them up is a skill that you must master. I would also try the Stir Fried Lamb with Scallion and the Dry Stir Fried Green Beans. Both are very flavorful and Szechuan-esque. Their beef stew noodle soup is very good, delectable and of course, spicy. If noodle soup is your thing, please also try the Triple Delight Wonton and the Chengdu Noodle Soup. Szechuan Hot and Spicy Fish Filet is a good seafood dish, but this is recommended for those who enjoy their food, obviously, hot and spicy. 

One of the drawbacks to this place is that it tends to get a little snug during busy hours; by snug I mean they try to fit as many people as they can into the restaurant. I tend to also try to get a booth because the chairs make me a bit nervous. 

Perks of the place. Location! It is on the southeast corner of New York/Aurora and Route 59, which is directly across from the Westfield Shopping Center (forever Fox Valley in my book). Great service! Seriously, the manager asks us how the meal was EACH TIME I hit this joint. 

I know I recommended mostly spicy dishes, but they DO have non-spicy dishes. On the authenticity meter on a scale of 1-10, I give this an 8.

I was sick of burgers and sandwiches and just stumbled upon this place on a Saturday late morning.

When I walked in, the place looked very quiet (perhaps only 4 occupied tables). I was a bit unsure but went ahead anyways. I ordered some szechuan dishes and noodles (can&#39;t remember what were they called - I just remembered lots of chilli oil) and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted! It wasn&#39;t as spicy as it looked and even my fiance (who tries to avoid spicy loved it) - the noodles were flavorful. The portions were just right (not too large), and they had a lot of authentic Chinese selection on the menu. Prices were OK too... there are some side-dishes that you can order at about $3-4, so you can mix-n-match (in case you just want a taste, and not stuff your face.)

I gave this 4 stars because the first impression wasn&#39;t much of an impression. Maybe it&#39;s the dim lighting, or lack of light coming in from outside that made the place look a little dull. Other than that, I&#39;d recommend coming here for the food."

When we told the waiter we had not ordered chicken with broccoli but rather chicken with black bean sauce they just added black bean sauce to the chicken with broccoli they originally brought out. Not tasty at all. The next time we went I ordered homestyle tofu, which had been my favorite dish. This time it tasted funny and I threw out the leftovers. The last straw is that a few nights ago I ordered vegetable fried rice for take out. It was bland, tasteless and barely edible.

Paul and Jennifer are outstanding owners.  This was the friendliest restaurant I have ever visited.  To tell you how invested they are in their customers, Jennifer personally walked an elderly patrons order out to her vehicle.

Actually, it was proximity to my location today (Lilacia Park) and the fact that my dad and I both wanted a sandwich for lunch. Shannon&#39;s Deli met both criteria, and we both ordered the Pastrami and Swiss (on grilled rye, since they didn&#39;t have an onion roll for Dad).

The hot pastrami was meaty and spicy, but I felt like the taste of the rye warred with it a bit; might have done better on a plainer roll. 

I upgraded from chips to fries for $1; good choice! Crispy outside, still potato-y inside, and adorned with flaky salt. 

The deli has two rooms, with some interesting furniture (note the table and stools with claw-and-ball feet) and several (gladly muted) TVs, and then beyond in the next room is Shannon&#39;s butcher shop; though closed, the sprightly lady behind the deli counter actually went to get something from there for a customer, so that&#39;s service!

Their menu isn&#39;t enormous, but there is a &#34;build your own sandwich&#34; section so you can always create something yourself if you see a gap. Right by the Metra (and near Lilacia Park!)"

Shannon&#39;s is awesome. They have a wide selection of items on their menu, and everything I&#39;ve tasted is delicious. I&#39;m a huge fan of their buffalo chicken - this item seems to be my habitual order lately! The reason the items can sometimes take a while is because they are made FRESH! The staff is always friendly and helpful. Prices are reasonable and the restaurant is always clean.

We were looking for a new place to try out for lunch and found this gem on Yelp.  After browsing through some reviews we decided to go there for lunch.  It&#39;s right by the Lombard train station in one of the dead end streets.  They have a huge seating area next to the ordering area.

The staff was friendly and was cracking jokes with all the customers. It made the atmosphere very friendly.  I couldn&#39;t choose between the corned beef and the pastrami, but the guy who was taking my order (I can&#39;t remember his name but he was a friendly guy) recommended the corned beef on rye.  It did not disappoint.  Got some chips to go along with the sandwich.  

They have burgers too, which I didn&#39;t expect.  My friend got one and he said it was delicious.

I&#39;ll definitely be back."

This little shop is becoming my go-to destination in Lombard for a quick bite to eat..  

I&#39;ve just been 4 times so far.  On the first visit I ordered a salad with steak and it was SO very good.  On the next visits I had a wrap sandwich with potato chips.  It was generous in size and very hearty and tasty.  On 2 subsequent visits I have had the cup of soup and half sandwich option.  

My personal opinion is that salt is often overused in restaurants but not at Shannon&#39;s. I have  actually found the soups and food in general to be a little unsalted, but not in a bad way.  I prefer to have to add a little sprinkle of salt."

We have been going to the meat market since it opened, and were thrilled to death when they opened the deli.  Now that it&#39;s expanded it&#39;s even better!  

Honestly - It&#39;s fantastic. Amazingly tasty sandwiches and soups.  And the orzo salad is TOTALLY awesome - the best side you can get. Sandwiches are VERY  generous - you can easily split.  So happy to have Shannon&#39;s in Lombard!!  We go nearly every weekend.

Like I said, everything we have had has been amazing (other than the Hot Steak - personally not a fan), but completely recommend the tuna, The Ham, and The Smoked.  Split them - they are huge!!  And the soups are consistently good too.  Just a REALLY solid place for lunch."

Near the the station there are a surprising number of places to choose from.  This may be downtown Lombard.  

Shannon&#39;s deli is a right across the the street from the &#39;to Chicago&#39; side of the tracks and stretches for a number of storefronts.  The deli is about the third door down.

Inside you&#39;ll find deli cases filled with salads and meats.  Behind the counter pandemonium.  

The tall, middle aged gentleman running the cash register had to be the owner.  He was barking orders, spilling sht, and generally barely keeping it together.  At one point, he ran from behind the counter and started yelling some dudes&#39; name (manuel?) over and over again.  Finally manuel showed up and he was told to do something urgently.

I ordered the meatball sandwich and a side salad which consisted of cucumbers, tomatoes, and cheese.  Both were really quite delicious.   

It was an amusing experience.  Too bad the owner didn&#39;t have an engish accent.

I arrived at 12:15 on a Saturday and was unable to get a spot on the street due to construction.  So I parked on the sidewalk behind a construction sign... Whatever!

I walked in and immediately realized just how small it was.  Maybe eight tables, many just two-tops.  It was75% full so I got in line not knowing if I would get a seat.  Ordering is a bit stressful as many of the popular sandwich places are, once it&#39;s your turn you know you have to be ready cuz there&#39;s ten people behind you.... Cursing each question you ask!

I ordered the Reuben (great reviews) and a cup of hearty beef soup.  After I paid I looked around and......YESSSSSS, one table left!.  Only problem (and probably the only reason it was open) was it was right next to the door!  BRRRRRRR!

So I waited a few seconds and a gentleman (later realized it was the owner) came from behind the counter carrying my soup.  I watched as he ran into another customer with the arm carrying my soup, my crackers fell to the floor, and he never broke stride.  He set my cracker less soup,that had spilled over the side of the cup filling the soup spoon full of brothy beef and soaking the napkin, in front of me without acknowledging a thing... Or replacing my crackers.   Not a great start.....
Soup was OK : B- (crackers might have been the missing ingredient....?)

Next came the Reuben.  Have to give credit where credit is due.... GOOD F-ING RUEBEN! A++. Really tasty corned beef, perfectly toasted rye bread, and 1,000 island dressing that could change your life!!

I spoke briefly with the owner who informed me that the were in the process of expanding into the adjacent space.  Good! They need it!!

I will eat here again and you should too!  Killer sandwich, and I&#39;m sure once they expand the chances of a beef broth, cracker calamity will be minimal!  Looking forward to upgrading my stars next visit!"

I&#39;ve probably had Shannon&#39;s 3 or 4 times in the past couple of years. Each time the food has been decent. It was solid don&#39;t get me wrong but nothing exactly has ever wowed me. More importantly the quality of food doesn&#39;t justify the cost. 

One thing that drives me nuts is that customer service here has been kind of terrible. I know they are busy and I don&#39;t expect them to especially cater to me but the frantic behavior by the lady behind the counter and her being so short with me, has turned me off this place.

This place is better than most chain sub places but the combination of the food, cost, and customer service certainly doesn&#39;t make this place worth it."

It was getting late and their website said they close at 7pm.  Amazingly, they had a Facebook feed on their website where they recently posted that they were opening until 8p that night.  How tech savy!!  That piece of info got me into those doors that night.  After my dinner here, I am happy to add to their 5-star streak.

The deli is adorable and is tucked away in one of the alleys in downtown Lombard.  Street parking is free and was easy to find.  There is both seating inside and outside.  The lady working here, I believe her name is Theresa, made us feel more than welcome.  She is enthusiastic and genuinely cares for the business and her customers.  What a delight to be at a place where the people are happy!

Shrimp Po Boy w/side was on special for $7.  Since it was towards the end of the day, some of the sides were almost gone and she threw in an extra side for us.  How sweet!  The sandwich looked and tasted amazing!  

Cobb Salad - $8 - Big salad, fresh and delicious!  The bacon on top was perfectly cooked.

Lisa had an appointment, so we arranged to meet at a forest preserve (on her way to work) for lunch and I would pick up the food at Shannon&#39;s. My first time there.

I know that Lisa would be happy with half a sandwich and chips or soup.... But she ends up with a foot long Club Sandwich, cup of Spicy Shrimp and Rice Soup AND a pasta salad (I&#39;m figuring she can take the rest to work for dinner) and a Chocolate Chip Cookie*

I got the Meatball Sub and French Fries and a Chocolate Chip Cookie.... and then I bought Lasagna for my sister in law and I to have for dinner..

Lisa thought the Club was great, good combo/quantity of fixings and really good soft and chewy bread, the pasta salad was tasty and the soup (a new one for Shannon&#39;s) was really delicious (not real spicy!)

Of course I loved my Meatball Sub, same great bread, meatballs with a really great texture.. everything just messy enough, cheese melted properly and a really tasty red sauce. The fries were pretty standard, they cook them more to the well done side, which I liked.. hot and crispy.. but not great fries, just good. I had the cookie with my coffee a little later, it was there.. and then it wasn&#39;t... I&#39;m thinking it was pretty darn good**

The Lasagna ($5.99) was delicious, baked it in the oven for about 25 minutes at 350, I wished that I had some red sauce to pour over it... I might ask about that next time (see about getting a side)

The lady at the counter couldn&#39;t have been more friendly. She has a great attitude and made the process fun. I was there after the lunch rush so there were only a few other people there. She seemed to know everyone and how they wanted their stuff. I half expected her to know my name, even though I&#39;d never been there before...

* Impulse control problem? or good planning? Lisa took one look at all of the food and handed the cookie to me and said &#34;Thanks, but I&#39;ll never be able to eat this too&#34;

** Due to the &#34;accidental&#34; over-purchase of cookies, I can now attest that  they are quite good (heavy on the chocolate!) as I forced myself to slowly savor the second one"

The fries were perfectly done- crispy, golden, hot, perfectly salted. Yep! That good! The owner was friendly and the outdoor seating was comfortable and relaxing. There was construction going on nearby but nothing that Shannon&#39;s Deli could have done to fix that.

The only negative I could give Shannon&#39;s was the average lemon bar. I might have high standards there, since I grew up eating the best lemon bars ever.

I met up with a friend on a gloriously warm Saturday and she suggested we come to Shannon&#39;s before hitting up Dairy Queen. Great idea!

It was busy, busy, busy, but we got our order in pretty quickly and managed to snag a table. The menu is on the wall but they also have printed versions you can grab at the register.

I ordered the veggie sandwich, and honestly, I should have gotten a half. It was two big halves, with awesome bread, cheese, lettuce, tomato, roasted red pepper and a pesto mayo. Kind of sloppy to eat but very tasty. I got chips on the side (and took them home) but you can also select fries (fairly basic frozen variety, but tasty) or one of their salads. Everything looked really good. They have a big variety of subs, hot sandwiches, hot dogs, burgers, chicken, wraps, soup, salads, etc. They ALSO have beer and wine, including local nanobrewery Flesk, which is awesome.

It did take a little while for our sandwiches to come out, but considering how busy it was -- and how many takeout orders there were -- it was unsurprising. Definitely call ahead if you&#39;re in a hurry and just want to pick something up.

The food was very good, and you better believe next time I need some lunch downtown I&#39;m coming here -- please ignore that spot across the street."

Great variety, fresh ingredients and superb service!  Couldn&#39;t ask for anything more.  There isn&#39;t much of a reason to come to downtown Lombard but Shannon&#39;s makes it worthwhile!

Amongst the four of us we had a chicken salad sandwich, Italian sub (the Vinny), a meatball sub and of course a hot dog for the little guy!  Everything was perfectly done right down to the hearty multi-grain bread for my chicken salad sandwich.  They even have ice cream for desert on a hot summer day.  It isn&#39;t fancy but they sure know how to do what they do really well!

Can&#39;t wait to go back!"

I ordered the turkey sandwich with a side of fruit. The fruit was the tastiest I&#39;ve had in a long time, I&#39;ve been craving it ever since. The sandwich was also really good, basic, but good. My brother got the pulled pork sandwich and said it was the best pulled pork he&#39;s ever had, which is saying a lot. 
I&#39;ll definitely be back to try more things off the menu, everything sounds delicious. 

Customer service is so-so. Workers seem a little stressed but did make us feel welcome once we sat down to eat. Thought about hacking a star off for the service but I loved the food so 5 stars it is."

The service was excellent and maybe a bit overwhelmed by our large group.  I had the Reuben sandwich which was delicious and I like that you can order 1/2 sandwiches.  I think most of our group had lukewarm comments about our other food which included multiple different sandwiches (including Italian beef, the Vinnie (an Italian sub), corned beef, tuna salad) and the steak salad.

The dog friendly status refers to the outside seating which consists of three tables on the sidewalk which is really quiet (U N L E S S  T H E R E  I S  A  T R A I N  G O I N G  B Y ! ! ! !)"

I skipped my normal BLT and I ordered the Veggie Sub. All of the subs come with a bag of chips which you can upgrade (tiny charge included). The sandwich was awesome. The bread and the ingredients were fresh. I usually don&#39;t order an all veggie sub but I&#39;m glad I did. 

I&#39;ve been back there twice more and Shannon&#39;s has now become my go-to sandwich place in Lombard. 

The prices are great, you get a full meal for what you pay for. If you aren&#39;t a huge eater, you can order a half sandwich. I do this as the subs and sandwiches are big enough where I cannot eat a full one. 

The staff is very friendly and the deli has always been clean.

Got a custom sandwich on the French bread (sub roll) and was pretty happy with it - beef, turkey, bacon, Swiss, Provolone, lettuce, tomato, cucumbers, mayo. Would ask for heavier mayo the next time. And maybe some mustard.

Shannon&#39;s Deli cute &#34;little&#34; shop that can probably hold quite a bit of traffic and even has a few tables for outdoor seating.  There is a public fridge with pasta, cheese, ribs, and other items for purchase along with a rack full of some jams / honey etc.  The real reason I came in was for the food.

The SO ordered a cobb salad and I ordered the special for the day - a shrimp po&#39; boy.  It was a little confusing as all of the other sandwiches are served / priced as a foot long with a 6 inch option and this was the opposite without mention on the board, but the price was still reasonable and this was not really a bother.  The cashier did mention it when I started to place our order.  I ordered red potato salad for my side.  The cashier noted there wasn&#39;t much left since it was the end of the day (even though it filled a side container), so she offered a second side for free!  The sides were great, the po&#39; boy was very tasty (though a bit messy).  I tried a few bites of my SO&#39;s salad which was good as well.  Portions were plenty and the food just tasted all around good.  The cookies on the counter looked fantastic too, but I knew I&#39;d be full.  I&#39;ll have to stop in for one or bring one home next time.

The cashier checked on us repeatedly, asked how we liked the food, and was very helpful the whole time.  When she was on the phone she was offering to bring food to the bar across the street and some other people had called in orders.  This is the kind of customer service that you can&#39;t pay for with money - you&#39;ve gotta pay for by coming back again (and again, and again).  We definitely will, and we&#39;ll be just as happy and full when we do!

On a side note - They own the butcher shop next door and Shannon&#39;s Irish pub in Glen Ellyn... so their experience must help.  I&#39;ll have to give them all a try!"

No sweet peppers available, the gravy was too salty and otherwise didn&#39;t have much taste, and the roll was very doughy.  I expected that the beef would be superior from a deli that charges $7.95 for the sandwich but it was just mediocre (to be fair, the $7.95 includes chips - fries are a dollar extra).  They automatically put cheese on the sandwich - in my opinion it should be available for an extra charge but not automatic since a traditional Chicago Italian Beef lover doesn&#39;t want it.  The fries were just OK, originally frozen like fries at most places.  The corn chowder soup (which I was overcharged for since the menu says it&#39;s $2.00 with a sandwich rather than the usual price of $2.69) was good."

On the one-block strip of Park Avenue that&#39;s between St. Charles Road and the Lombard train station, Shannon&#39;s Deli sits two doors down from Shannon&#39;s Butcher Shoppe. It took a while for the deli to open, and despite the quiet opening, it seems to be taking off. This will be the first of many good reviews, I&#39;m sure.

Shannon&#39;s Deli is still in the process of developing their total offering. Several chalkboards on the wall display entrees (without prices) that are not on the orange flier of a menu. A glass-lined case holds desserts of different prices and (perhaps) values, but I&#39;ve yet to offer the stomach space for such sweets.

When I see a new local eatery, my first couple of visits help me decide what&#39;s good to eat and what&#39;s to avoid. But there&#39;s a problem with that strategy here. I&#39;ve visited the deli four times, and I can&#39;t remember having anything that wasn&#39;t worth getting again. 

Today&#39;s visit with my wife was exceptional. We decided to split two sandwiches: pastrami sandwich and albacore tuna. Writing them together sounds gross, but we eat all of one sandwich before starting the other, because mixing them one bite at a time would not be very pleasant. Especially if you decide to down a bag of tasty jalapeno chips while waiting for entree.

My biggest, and possibly only, complaint is the cozy confines. You&#39;ll feel a chill when the door opens on a cold day. There are not many tables available, and if people are waiting in line to take their orders and go, it can feel a little claustrophobic. I&#39;m thinking of Yogi Berra&#39;s line about no one going to a certain restaurant because it&#39;s too crowded. 

We waited several minutes after the friendly and energetic Theresa took our orders for food to start arriving. My wife&#39;s turkey and rice soup came first, and she told me to take my spoonful immediately, for it would soon be gone. It was excellent. Tasty but not salty, hearty but not overly so. 

The pastrami on rye with spicy mustard was exactly what I wanted, with tender slices of pastrami of a good thickness. Served warm, it was as if my teeth wanted to keep nestled inside the sandwich. But it wasn&#39;t the better sandwich. I give that nod to the albacore tuna. I&#39;ve been wanting to get the tuna for a while, but was once talked out of it by Theresa in favor of the taco special. (Oh yeah, watch for the special. It&#39;s often the unexpected.) The albacore didn&#39;t disappoint. The hearty but soft bread melded with the tuna, lettuce and tomato in an appealing manner. The right amount of red onion was mixed with with the salad, giving it a good flavor without a bad effect on the noses nearby. My wife might disagree with me on the better sandwich - she used the word &#34;incredible&#34; to describe at least one of them - but why debate it? They both rock.

All of the Shannon&#39;s locations push their (burgundy pepper) hangar, a part of cow I&#39;ve never seen mentioned anywhere else. You can try it at the deli in a steak sandwich. I&#39;ve had the hangar from the butcher and didn&#39;t think it lived up to the hype, but I liked the steak sandwich from the deli on a prior visit, so what do I know?

Is Shannon&#39;s Deli the type of eatery that most hip downtowns have? Probably. Did downtown Lombard need it? Definitely. Once the rooftop is renovated into an outdoor patio (something that won&#39;t happen for a while, or so I&#39;ve been told) and I can enjoy a beer and a sammich while viewing the evolution of my downtown, I&#39;ll be a regular. As it stands, they know me by name and that&#39;s enough to keep me from becoming a stranger. 

I&#39;ve noticed that the Corner House carries some of their sandwiches in the grab-and-go case, and the Vino Cellar is considering carrying some of their cheeses to pair with glasses of wine. If other hip businesses are getting busy with the deli, why shouldn&#39;t you? Shannon&#39;s Deli deserves your patronage."

They are always busy and the sandwich specials are delicious. We always end up taking food home when we get the full orders. Over Valentine&#39;s Day they had a fantastic &#34;dinner at home&#34; special which came with two filets (it was incredibly tender and buttery almost), two twice baked potatoes, and four stuffed mushrooms...we added some asparagus to our meal and were absolutely stuffed. Shannon&#39;s also has a kid&#39;s menu which has the typical tenders/burgers on it, my 3 year old eats everything every time! They always have soups which has been great during this extremely cold winter... I can&#39;t wait until it is warmer out and will be able to walk over there for lunch. If you&#39;re looking to support a small business, this is definitely the place to go. I&#39;ve sent many a patron over their way and everyone always talks about how happy they were with their experiences. They also have a section of locally made marinades and other items for purchase, I love that they work to support other local businesses. Keep it up!"

Time of my visit: around lunch time

This was my first visit at this establishment.  It&#39;s not very big for sit ins lunches/dinners, but that&#39;s okay, most of places like that are intended to be that.  I came to the counter and the female owner took my order, she was extremely nice and upon me mentioning that it was my first time, she made a few recommendations.

I settled on half slab of ribs.  The wait was not long and the owner kept refilling my water promptly.  The ribs and fries came out fresh and hot!  The fries were well seasoned and surprisingly good (I usually don&#39;t care for the fries, fries are fries and my expectations are always low).

Now to the ribs, the ribs were awesome!  Top 2 in my book!  The right amount of bbq, the firmness of the ribs (not too firm to where it&#39;s hard to bite in or chew on, just a right amount of firmness).  I would say they were pretty delicious!

I should not have gotten a desert.  Overall a solid A!"

Not so. Their business is located in a small strip mall near Stratford Square Mall. Nice small cozy take out joint with a couple of tables, for those waiting for their food I imagine.

I had ordered a large thin crust pizza with sausage and ricotta along with a meatball sandwich late on a Saturday afternoon.

The order was hot and ready when I arrived. The people behind the counter were friendly. My disappointed only started when I came home and opened up the box.  I could tell by the edges of the crust that the pizza had been overcooked. Most of the outer crust had started to blacken.  The underside of the crust was dark brown dry and tough. I didn&#39;t mind that the top of the pizza was well done but that taste of crunchy burnt crust really doesn&#39;t go down well.

Crispy pizza...good. Crunchy dry burnt pizza...bad.

The meatball sandwich was average at best although I must say I am spoiled by family recipes.

Had this pizza been taken out five minutes or so earlier I may have been writing a better review. Given that this semi-burnt pizza was boxed up and given to a customer tells me that the business may not give top priority to the quality of their food."

The last time my family was there we ordered a lot of food. We were moving this day and hadn&#39;t eaten so we treated ourselves. We started with an order of the fried ravioli. They were freshly made and served with the homemade marinara sauce. The inside was still gooey, while the outside had a good crunch. We were served warm bread with an olive oil and basil dipping sauce.

We then ordered a Caesar salad to split. it looked like too much dressing, but ended up being amazing and full of flavor. Their dressing is homemade and you can taste he difference.

My sister ordered a small deep dish pepperoni pizza. The crust is by far the best part. Lots of cheese throughout the pizza. My dad ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were amazing with a rich flavor. My mom ordered the eggplant parmesan, the same thing she always gets. She loved her dish. I ordered the angel pasta with vodka sauce and a side of Italian sausage. My food was probably the worst and yet still amazing and full of flavor.

We each left with a to-go container and enough food for two meals each. Overall this restaurant is amazing and the workers truly want you to have a good family experience."

I had full slab of ribs with fries and &#34;coleslaw&#34;

The fries were pretty mushy and soft, definatly made from frozen, no salt added, very plain

The coleslaw, if i can even call it that was like a genric one you get from any grocey store not very flavorful. What was worse is that the portion size was about 2 fork fulls litterally. It came in a sauce container that you would use for like a side of ketchup or relish.

Lastly the ribs which is the only thing saving this place from a 1 star. It was juicy and fall off the bone, but lacked the flavor on the meat. They depended more on the sauce, it was very lightly added on and there was a container of it on the side too. The sauce was pretty good but was more vinagar than i would like to taste. ( i am not a big fan of vinagar is all)

Overall not a place i would go back to eat at, also this meal was $22"

Food came in a timely manner and was still nice and hot. Very disappointed though that no plastic ware, napkins, little salt packets, parmesan or hot pepper flakes came with our meal especially since part of our order was pasta which, obviously, needs to be eaten with a fork. Ended up having to run around to the restaurants in the hotel asking for utensils, napkins and salt. Having said that, the food was good just wish they had taken into consideration that when delivering an order to a hotel that their customer will most likely need these little extras."

It honestly looks OK inside, service was decent and I&#39;ve got a cheese pizza on a thin crust to go Got home and I want to taste it right away,  I thought that somehow I&#39;ve lost my taste buds from the time I&#39;ve gone out and came back so I&#39;ve tried something else, seems to be fine, back to pizza, it&#39;s plain, absolutely flavorless, I check out the crust, it&#39;s not what I&#39;ve envisioned when placing an order for thin one, it&#39;s thicker then sauce and cheese on the pizza. I really was hoping for more, what I&#39;ve got was some flavorless cheese on top of the most bland sauce I&#39;ve seen come out of a kitchen proclaiming to be Italian, all of that smeared on crust I find acceptable for panini and not pizza, not a fan at all."

My husband got the Muscles in the Arrabiata Sauce as an appetizer and just loved them. He also loved his spaghetti and meatballs that night and  for a few days after, the portions were huge so there were definitely left overs.  I had the Chicken Marsala which was delicious one of the best I have had. Although I was very sad because I left the remainder of my meal in the hotel refrigerator and forgot to bring it home, what a disappointment :( 

The service was wonderful as well, I had quite a few bags so they helped me to my car.  The only reason I cannot give them 5 stars is because I got back to the hotel after smelling the delicious food ready to eat it and there was no cutlery in the bag.  We had a hard time scavenging for some utensils and it was just torture smelling the food and not being able to eat it when we were starving :)"

They serve traditional Lithuanian cuisine. Now, I know no nothing about Lithuanian food, so consider that in reading this review. I had the Lithuanian Combo Platter to get a varied taste of the cuisine.  It included Kugelis (a thick potato pancake), Zeppelin (a meat-stuffed potato dumpling), a potato sausage and a Lithuanian sausage. The platter included sides of sauerkraut, sour cream and bacon bits. It was good, but different than anything I&#39;ve had before. My wife had the Lithuanian pork tenderloin which was lightly breaded and fried. It was topped with sautéed mushrooms, onions and cheese. It was served with mashed potatoes, a creamy mushroom sauce and mixed vegetables.  She enjoyed her meal. The service was polite and attentive.

To the side of the restaurant is a store where they sell  Lithuanian foods, magazines and other such items. While we dined, we noticed a number of people stopping in to pick up to-go orders. If you&#39;re in the western suburbs and looking for some Lithuanian cuisine, give Old Vilnius Café a try."

It&#39;s not hard finding Eastern European fare in Greater Chicago but in a city where the European scene is dominated by Polish and Ukrainian fare Lithuanian is a lesser known speciality that this place thrives on. There&#39;s an array of Lithuanian dishes such as Sausage, kugelis, and zeppelins but for those unfamiliar with Lithuanian food (and I&#39;ll be honest it can be a bit heavy) there&#39;s the better known polish dishes and also their schnitzel is super good.

Very easy to miss if you don&#39;t know about it. The interior was very cozy and the addition of a Lithuanian gift shop/store was a neat thing to find.
The food was delicious. I had the Lithuanian Combo plate which I recommend you have if this is your first time visiting here. It has a little bit of everything that is good. I also had the meat pockets (which were so yummy) and the fried bread with cheese and garlic blanket (this was so much better then I had been prepared for - do not pass this up). 
Their selection of unique beers and wine was also worth taking note of.
My only issue and the main reason I don&#39;t award this place five stars is the wait time. We waited much longer then I think was appropriate for our drinks and our main dishes (though the appetizers did show up promptly).
They seemed to be short staffed.
But for the food alone and the unique atmosphere this place was pleasantly surprising. I plan to visit again and hope my wait isn&#39;t nearly as long next time.

The small store front also contains a grocery and souvenir shop. In this review, I will attempt to highlight all aspects of this fascinating new addition to Darien. 

First, let&#39;s discuss the souvenir shop. When you enter Old Vilnius, you pretty much walk straight into it. The souvenir shop has tons of fascinating items: flying witches on broomsticks, Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Lenin glassware, wooden religious figures, beer steins, etc. The list goes on. Behind the souvenir shop is the grocery. There are various pastries being prepared fresh, I believe, and other Eastern European grocery items. You can even find books and DVDs here. It is a fun place to browse. You will find some odd and rare merchandise here. 

Now to the actual cafe. First of all, it is very small. There are only a handful of tables. The walls are painted to look like night. They are all black and what appears to be a church is painted on the wall. Very unique artwork. I ordered a huge Russian beer and the Lithuanian sausage platter. The Russian beer went down easy like a Miller. There was nothing special about it. It was just enormous. Also, I found the Lithuanian sausage too mild. It didn&#39;t taste like anything. It was a substantial sausage but it needed seasoning. Everything else was quite average as well. Perhaps Eastern European food is meant to be mild.

In any case, Old Vilnius is such an interesting place that I will return. Most likely, it will be to browse the oddities in the souvenir shop."

The prices may seem a bit high but wait till you see the portions.  You walk in, and the retail counter is first. No one really helps you, so you have to know to go to the restaurant side and wait to be seated there.  The place is small!

We headed over around 7:30pm on Saturday night.  There was a 20 minute wait so we headed to the bar in Mi Hacienda next door for a beer.  I purchased a $25 for $12 Groupon while we waited, score!  Our table was ready when we walked back over 20 minutes later.  The menu is extensive and we had a difficult time deciding!  We ordered the fried bread in warm cheese &amp; garlic sauce and 2 large Svyturys beers to start.  Think of the fried bread as large toasted croutons with a thick, melted garlic cheese on top.  A little heavy but absolute heaven.  The hubby and I decided to share 2 different combo plates in order to get a taste of everything.  We tried polish sausage, potato pancakes, sauerkraut, fried zeppelin, kugelis, &amp; potato sausage.  Everything was OUTSTANDING!  I think it&#39;s very easy for potato-based foods to be bland and heavy, but the food was FAR from that.

Our server was incredibly friendly and answered all of our questions.  I have to deduct 1 star because they were out of stuffed cabbage rolls for the evening.  I am a cabbage roll addict and was pretty disappointed.  But it gives us another reason to visit soon!"

Why? 

Because this once 4-star (according to my original review) restaurant has seriously declined over my past few visits, culminating in tonight&#39;s horrible meal. 

The service has slid to the point that you have to wait and wait and wait for your food, your drink refills, and ultimately your check. Tonight our soup and meal came out at the same time, so our food sat getting cold while we ate our soup.

I thought it was perhaps a singular occurrence last time we came, which is why we decided to try it again tonight. No. Clearly this establishment has gone downhill. 

My meal was burned to the point of being inedible. The kugelis was blackened on the top. Our server, Anda asked how it was and I told her it was awful. She offered to have the cook make me another, but I told her I didn&#39;t want another one. It was terrible.

I told her again how bad it was when she came to clear the mostly uneaten meal from the table. I was never offered something different, and when the bill came the burned food was on the bill. 

I told Anda how disappointed I was and she proceeded to argue with me that 1) that&#39;s how the food is supposed to be and 2) she offered to bring me something different, which, she didn&#39;t. She offered to bring me another kugelis. 

I am so disappointed in the decline of this establishment, especially to see that the staff simply doesn&#39;t seem to care about customer concerns, or in pleasing them. I was, what I&#39;d consider, a semi-regular customer. We came about once every few months. But from now on I will drive a little further and go to Grand Duke&#39;s on Harlem for Lithuanian food, where the food and service continue to be excellent.

EDIT: I am shocked to read another reviewer state that they are owned by the same family as Grand Duke&#39;s. The food is vastly different, and the service is so much better there."

The cabbage rolls were large but were room temperature when they were served.  The filling was OK but needed seasoning.  The tomato sauce was too sweet for our taste.  The Lithuanian pork tenderloin was covered in some cheese and mushroom glop.  I noticed a lot of dishes come with cheese and/or a creamy mushroom sauce.  We assumed this was traditional.

I have German/Polish blood in me, and I&#39;ve never shied away from a hearty meal. Then again, there might be cause to state I&#39;ve never shied away from ANY meal, but I digress. How is it Lithuanians aren&#39;t all 750 pounds? How do any Lithuanians live to any age past 35 without their hearts exploding in a Cholesterol rage? Do the Chefs have to join OPEC? I have never encountered such a wall of starch and grease like I did during today&#39;s throwdown at Vilnius. 
I don&#39;t know anything about Lithuanian eating habits, save for one of my high school chums was Lithuanian and his family et open-faced Ham Sandwiches for breakfast. (This was in the early sixties before gourmet eating was legal in the US). 
Maybe what I had today was the epitome of Litho fare. I don&#39;t know. The place was packed, and people were tucking in, that&#39;s for sure. All the plates that came out looked like what I had, and I ordered what the non-English-speaking waitron suggested. It also wasn&#39;t the most expensive thing on the menu, so I know I wasn&#39;t being grandstanded.
Lunch started with a Wild Mushroom soup that was delicious, and quite light, despite being described as a &#34;creamy&#34; soup. I had heard this place was a haven for Garlic, and as a strict aficionado of the &#34;stinking rose&#34;, I ordered what is purported to be the menu &#34;Garlic Bomb&#34;, the &#34;Fried Bread&#34;. What came out was a large dish of thick matchsticks of what appeared to be Pumpernickel, fried crisp in Garlic-infused oil. Over the top was some sort of mozzarella-type cheese. There was about a quarter-inch oil slick on the bottom of the dish, that did not look inviting. Here was the first &#34;Uh-Oh&#34;. Heating certain cheeses in a Microwave melts the cheese, but also effects a byproduct of gredue that slinks to the bottom of the cooking vessel. It&#39;s not appetizing. This plate was obviously the work of &#34;Chef Mike&#34;. Sampling the sticks &#34;up top&#34;, they were indeed chock full of the stinky stuff, and rich to the taste. A few bites in and I was done. That cloying feeling when you eat too much rich stuff was on the horizon, and I still had my Entree to go. I set the plate aside, and it appeared untouched, even though I had et my share.
The Entree (the &#34;Lithuanian Sampler&#34;) came, and it looked like a platter for 4. A hunk of Kugelis the size and shape of a building brick; a long, browned tube that was ostensibly &#34;Potatoe Sausage&#34;, alongside another short and squat grey sausage that had absolutely NO plate appeal, and a Litho specialty called a &#34;Zeppelin&#34;-which was again, a doughy white football that looked uncooked. A mound of dark Kraut rounded out the plate. Yes, and over EVERYTHING was sprinkled some pinkish meat  preparation that I could not identify.
What I DID identify was another off-putting oil slick at the bottom of the plate.
I sampled everything before me, and found none of it except the Kraut to have any discernible flavor whatsoever. The Kraut was greasy, and tasted reheated and old. There were also a LOT of whole Bay leaves that kept getting stuck in my teeth and resisted being chewed, I made a pile of them on the bread plate. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever left that much food on a plate in a restaurant. I didn&#39;t complain, because I had no reference as to whether this was actually a fine fine Litho Resto, or a Crime against cuisine. As I saw the same plate come out a number of times, and the folks accepting them were digging in, I figured I had just chosen wrong, and that&#39;s not the resto&#39;s fault. I asked for a few doggy boxes, and when I went to put the remainder of the Fried Bread in one, it tipped over and I saw the congealed mess at the bottom of the pile. Ug. Same thing as I dumped the remainder of the sampler plate in the box. I put both boxes in the provided plastic bag. 
I paid thirty dollars for this lunch. $30.05, to be exact. No Booze, No Coffee, No Dessert.
I contemplated this on the way out, as I was toting the bag that, if you told me contained a child&#39;s bowling ball, I would have believed you. It was that heavy.
I further contemplated the family what walked in and sat down opposite me. An older Mom and Dad of Bovine/Porcine proportions, and two gorgeous, young middle-aged daughters with slim, spectacular figures. I noticed the first thing they ordered was the fried bread. You do the math. 
And also-that Lithuanian friend who et the Ham Sarnies for Breakfast was a superstar in the locker room due to his enormous Penis. Another Math problem...
The service wasn&#39;t as lax as the reviews here would have you believe, it actually wasn&#39;t bad. Will I be back? A few bowls of the Mushroom soup would be a fine Lunch. There were also some straight meat dishes that looked good on the menu, so even though I&#39;m throwing only one star, I will prolly be back. 
Maybe.
Do they have Ham Sandwiches on the menu?"

This is some of the best-quality Lithuanian food in Chicagoland.  The quantities of food that you get are amazing for the price.  The only justifiable complaint that anyone can put forth is that the service is slow, which it is, and for good reason - everything is cooked from scratch to order!  How can you beat that?  People who are looking for eastern European &#34;fast food&#34; have their heads you know where.  This type of food simply CANNOT be prepared expediently.
Additionally, they have a cute shop that sells many hard-to-get eastern European goods and small gifts.
I will most certainly be back many times.  YUM!"

I&#39;m Polish/Russian, so have been exposed to a fair amount of Slavic food, but they had plenty of things that I&#39;ve never tried before, and they were all good. Particularly, the herring appetizer and dumpling soup got our meal off to a fantastic start. The 1/2 duck w/ sauerkraut and kugel was stellar, and the Stroganoff first rate (albeit the accompanying potatoes were a only just warm). The only disappointments was the chicken Kiev, which was actually dry.  We left feeling confident that anything on the menu that had the &#34;Vilnius&#34; logo next to it was going to be something special though.  Worth mentioning too that the decor, while simple was rather charming, and the service was terrific. Will take this over any of the other Slavic specialty places along 75th street *any* day!"

Checked this place out with my mom and was very happy. They have some lunch specials ranging from $5 - $7 that were of good portions. mom got some meat crepes that were very tasty. I ended up getting the fried Lithuanian platter consisting of Kugelis, potato-sausage and &#34;zeppelins&#34; which were fried potatoes topped with a bit of sausage. Everything I ordered was potato-based topped with bacon bits served with a side of sour-cream, but I didn&#39;t care. It was downright delicous. Probably not the healthiest thing to order, so for only an additional .99 I got a bowl of creamy tomato soup. I went home with plenty of leftovers. 
I liked the interior decor, dark, with a large wall mural of a castle in the night. Very Prussian-Germanic-Goth inspired. The women that worked there were all beautiful. 
IN ADDITION, Old Vilnius has a store/deli in the front where you can buy some Lithuanian-pride clothing, trinkets, books, dvds, and pretty much anything you can think of."

It became apparent after spending several minutes on the phone that they had availability for two of us.  We arrived a few minutes later and found the restaurant to be full except for one table that seated 5.  Nevertheless we were ushered by the waitress to have that table.  Once we sat down, a few minutes later another waitress arrived only to tell us that this table was reserved for a party of 5 and instructed us to get up to go back to the waiting area.  My wife and I just picked up our coats and walked straight out and never to come back again.  DO NOT SIT GUESTS DOWN ON A DINNER TABLE ONLY TO ASK THEM TO GO BACK AND WAIT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO GIVE THE TABLE TO ANOTHER LARGER PARTY.  Any restaurant that does that deserves negative criticism."

This is truly a rare find.  I hope that I don&#39;t go into a kugel coma.

Carry out from the deli area offers an affordable alternative to fast food, with the taste of mom and grandma&#39;s cooking.
The cabbage rolls w/mashed potatoes are enough for 2 people.  The  zeppelins are extremely filling and can be stretched to last for several days. The Polish platter is substantial.  Oh, the potato kugel, delish.  Tasty good choice for the price. Haven&#39;t been disappointed yet.

It&#39;s nothing like Grand Dukes as far as the atmosphere. This is a cafe, so the dining room is smaller, and nothing special. It also wasn&#39;t very warm inside, we had our coats on for most of the dinner. 

The menu options were pretty much the same as Grand Duke. The bread was not the ample assortment they give you at GD, it was just one type of rye. The sour cream was just regular sour cream and not the bacon sour cream. 

The Lithuanian combo platters were a hit and very good. Other dishes we ordered were: Pork Kabob, Pork Tenderloin and potato pancakes. 

The potato pancakes were really soggy and  just not very good. Pork tenderloin was really tasty. The pork Kabob was served on rice, the rice was really good however the meat was on the fatty side. 

Our waiter was really nice and attentive.   

I think I&#39;d go back with a Groupon or some coupon. It&#39;s nice that this location is closer to my house, so if I really have a taste for some kugilus I know where to go. If I want to make the dinner a special one I&#39;d much rather go to Grand Dukes."

All in all, a very cute place with friendly staff.    Our waiter was friendly and he was attentive.  I ordered the Lithuania platter and my husband the Polish platter.  Everything was really tasty with exception of the sauerkraut.  My husband and I both agreed that it was kind of bland. 

While waiting for our food order, I checked out the store.  They had all kinds of food items from Eastern Europe.  The deli had a nice selection of cheese and meats.  I am intrigued by cheese not from the US because you don&#39;t have to worry about Organic this way.  Cheese from Europe has strict rules about not using hormones like they do in the US.  So I may be back again to visit the deli.  They had some delicious pastries sitting on top of the deli counter too.

There were around 10 tables in there and was a good amount of space - much bigger than the area to eat at most Subway restaurants (to give you an idea).   they had 2 flat screen TVs on the walls.  Very nice European decor.   Very nice menus with some photos.

This space used to house a carpet store and I strongly suggest that they get rid of the industrial florescent lights.  The one over the checkout register (I will explain farther into this review) is blinding to 2 of the tables near the front window.

When you walk in, there is a checkout register.  That is because they sell Lithuanian products, including pre-made and frozen food.  As I said, there is a very small dining area with one table placed adjacent to, what I thought was, the kitchen swinging doors. Turns out, on the other side of the wall is a deli with all sorts of Lithuanian foods for sale.  The products for sale include used books, in Lithuanian, soccer jerseys, CDs, and a whole lot of other tchotchke.  Beware, all signage is written in Lithuanian.

Now, for the good stuff ~ the fresh, made to order food  After speaking with the manager, we learned there is a large Lithuanian population in the area and this place was very busy.  They, of course, ordered their food by calling the meal what it is, I needed the English translation but fully intend to work on my pronunciation.  Lenten specials include cod, salmon, smelt served hot, beautiful presentation, and mouth watering sides and sauces.  All employees were extremely polite, helpful, and very patient answering all our questions.  Suggestions made by our server were spot on and even my husband has a new favorite beer.  That&#39;s saying a lot considering we have dined at Bavarian Lodge, formerly known as Chef Paul, for over 20 years and anyone who drinks beer knows that place carries more beers than you could probably ever sample.  It all worked out because he was able to purchase the beer over on the deli side :)

They open at 10, for a late breakfast, 9 on week-ends, and serve lunch and dinner.

I had the Lithuanian Combo Plate and everything was excellent.  It was enough to feed two people and the price was around $13.

We arrived at about 6 for dinner and there were two tables left. There are only about 10 tables here so call ahead if you have a big group. We ordered drinks and also ordered potato pancakes as an appetizer. Very delicious, served with applesauce and sour cream. We ordered our food - my husband got the Lithuanian platter and I ordered the stuffed cabbage. Very large portions! We definitely have leftovers in the fridge. We saved room for honey cake, and we were so glad we did. It was so good - I would go there just for the cake. The service was a tiny bit slow, which is why I gave it the 4 star rating instead of the 5 star rating, but the food was amazing and very reasonable for the amount of food you get. We had an Amazon Local deal - $12 for $25 worth of food - so our bill came to $35 - which for two drinks, an appetizer, two huge entrees and two desserts was not bad at all. I cannot wait to go back and try more of the menu items!"

When we walked in I was surprised that this was also a store and deli more like a cultural center housed in a restaurant space. The eating area is small but very well put together, I could see this in downtown Chicago easily. Sat down for lunch and couldn&#39;t make up our mind, everything looked very interesting. Ordered the beet soup and two sampling platters to share. Wait staff is overly attentive (in a good way) and extremely polite; well belonging to a much higher scale restaurant. Food was new but very close to the German food I grew up on. The cabbage rolls stood out as a great part of the meal but all of the food items were great, the dumpling sampler had its merits as well as the mushroom schnitzel (sorry forgot the restaurant term). Most definitely not the place to go if you are on a diet but man was everything good. Not a bad bite in the meal. I will be going back when I feel the need for an excellent eating experience but must be shared with friends or you&#39;ll be taking half of it home in a doggy bag."

Great for hanging out with friends or listening to the live music that they often have. 
I&#39;ve been here so many times and I&#39;ve always enjoyed what I&#39;ve ordered. Their chips are a great starter. They always come out warm and the salsa tastes homemade and delicious. My favorite menu items are the enchiladas or the chicken tacos.

I ordered the battered cod fish tacos with refried beans and rice. Nice presentation of food: looks good enough to eat! Fish is crispy/fresh and not oily. It has good flavor even with the strong black beans. Every taste has its place. Also had a $2 taco...shredded beef...good! Ordered the warm apple empanada: seemingly prepared with a gelatin that actually was tasty. I enjoyed it.

Salsa was fresh and tasty. I dumped it in the beef taco.

Tacos al pastor lacked seasoning.  (Please! What&#39;s with the dearth of salt?) The tortillas used could be of better quality and thinner, since they&#39;ll be doubled for service.  The rice was okay. The beans were the best thing on the plate though, unsurprisingly, needed salt.

We sat indoors near the bar and a door that obviously opens, but it was closed on the day we were here.  There was a funky, musty smell in that corner.  We only had drinks and chips and salsa so that was fine.  Nothing outstanding, LOTS of staff running around.

There is a lower area at the end of the bar but we tried to sit there and the regular chairs were too low for comfort so I think this might be one of those misses for seating.  Can&#39;t address the dining area since we stayed only in the bar area."

The bartenders, Sarah and Nichole, are always quick and efficient, and, at the same time, very friendly and welcoming.

Facility is spotless and there is always ample tables and employees. You never have to wait long before your pleasantly greeted. We love sitting outside when the weather permits since the tables are spread out. I&#39;m a big fan of the chicken &amp; steak fajitas but I don&#39;t start there. Their queso fundido is some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. We drive from Chicago just to get our fill! Just writing this review makes my mouth water.

To wash it all down, their margaritas strongly poured and always made to order which I appreciate - there&#39;s nothing worst than a premixed margarita. We&#39;ve gone about a dozen times in the last year and it just simply isn&#39;t enough. Every time we come, Amy  (appears she runs the show there) treats us like  family.

This place has it all: from live music to an endless beer selection, perfectly cooked/seasoned authentic Mexican flavors and to top it all off, wonderful servers and staff.

I love the guac. They serve it in a giant tortilla chip bowl, basically, so you get like 5 extra chips&#39; worth of dippage without having to lose any precious guac. The guac itself is a nice mix of limey without being overpowering and overly salty. The chimichanga was my entree and it was rad. I don&#39;t normally enjoy black beans, but these black beans and rice sides for the entrees are straight bangin&#39;. My margarita was excellent, and I was blown away by the depth of the beer list. They didn&#39;t over indulge in any one brewery&#39;s beer. Nice and even across the board with A TON of variety. Our server was John and he was great. Very welcoming and accommodating. It would seem that this place has a lot going for it!!! Shouts out to John for treating my family so well on my dad&#39;s birthday."

But when my sister-in-law wondered if there was somewhere in Lemont where our party of 4+baby could dine al fresco, the memory that came to mind was of driving past the people happily clinking their drinks at Front Street Cantina.

Plus, I think our friendly upstairs neighbor works here in the kitchen.

Turns out we had a really pleasant Sunday evening dining experience. They&#39;d just wrapped up their open mic thing (something like 6-8pm on Sundays?), and we were readily hosted at the outdoor table of our choice.

Service was pretty good -- it took them a little longer than ideal for our food to come out, but they didn&#39;t mind getting us an extra basket of chips and salsa or two to tide us over. Ice water was refilled readily.

Food: my wife&#39;s chili was pretty spicy, but a good-sized bowl with great flavor for $5. I had probably among the best fish taco&#39;s that I&#39;ve had; probably have the guacamole sauce to thank for that. And my bro/sis-in-law seemed to enjoy their meals, as well. 

Their baby daughter liked when the christmas/string/fairy lights came on around us.

Minus .5 points for the server not asking me if I wanted my tacos soft- or crunchy-shelled, but we&#39;ll round up. Maybe she had something on her mind."

I have tried 3 different dishes and each is basically the same.  BLAND!  I guess I am jaded after having lived in Chicago very close to Pilsen where Excellent Mexican food is on every corner.  

The service we had last night was great!  New girl who was really working hard, but I had to return a glass of Sangria because it was undrinkable, my daughter got a burger and had one bite and went back to the chips and salsa, and my fajitas came home for me to fix.  

By the way, on a positive note, the salsa has improved from ketchup to maybe jarred grocery store quality.  I really wish the owners would take a field trip to some of the Mexican neighborhoods in the city to try quality, no frills, excellent Mexican food in order to have a grasp of what they should be serving."

The wife and I gave this place a try 3 times. 
The first time, the food was ok. I thought perhaps it was just the meal I ordered. 
(Although I got a combo plate.)

Then the second time I tried something different and I was starting to wonder if it was everything on a whole/ that didn&#39;t appeal to me. 
So I gave the place one last chance and that was the end of it. It was really not good at all. Nothing seemed close to authentic at all/
It all seemed very bland and just thrown together. I had some strange unknown spices that did not work well together.
I was very disappointed to say the least. As was the wife.

There are two dishes that I really like at Front Street, the steak campos tacos and the chili (which they give free bowls of during Bears games). I also occasionally go there for their fajita Thursday special, but it really is a lot of food and I can&#39;t finish it.

I&#39;ve also never had any incidents of bad service there even once in the many, many times I&#39;ve been there. 

Front Street&#39;s management goes to great lengths to keep their beer offerings current as well. They rotate their offerings frequently to feature interesting and local craft beers. 

I&#39;m pretty sure some of the lower reviews they&#39;ve received on here were when they first opened (when every restaurant goes through growing pains) or just isolated incidents and/or bad blood between a worker and patron (this really does happen, especially in a small town like Lemont)."

The head bus boy? He works so freaking hard and cleans the tables so fast. The sweet little brunette waitress? She is amazing.

The chips and salsa... the spicy salsa....AMAZING.

The female staff is hot too!! 

Whoever doesn&#39;t like this place doesn&#39;t like a good time and I MEAN this. The beer is good and cheap and the shots are priced well and the bar staff is lively. I go there to have a good meal and get a bit tipsy and it does the job. 

This is probably one of the best places to eat in Lemont.

When you go to front street you should go in expecting It is equivalent of like a PEPE&#39;s except it is waaaaay better then PEPE&#39;s. 

You do not go there expecting authentic food. Go there expecting Pepe&#39;s and you will be blown away."

The fact that dogs are welcomed and even served water is a good reason to go there in itself. It&#39;s more enjoyable knowing Fido isn&#39;t locked in his cage.  Food was better than expected going by some of the reviews. I had shrimp tacos and specified what I wanted on them. I got just that and they were pretty good. I was told the fresh ahi tuna salad was quite good as well. If you&#39;re expecting authentic Mexican it&#39;s not that.

It started out promising, and it looked like this was a good place to watch a Saturday afternoon Hawks game.  Let me start by saying the manager was very nice and apologetic for all our issues and the meal was on the house.  Every thing we ordered was wrong,  it started with the cocktails and continued with the meal where things were completely wrong,  redone, and wrong again. The waiter then argued with us, stating that was how we asked for it.  I asked for a second beer and when it came it was not what I was drinking, and when I inquired I was told it was my brand. I then asked another waiter who informed me the keg had run out of my beer and they had no more. So I guess they were just attempting to slip it by me and lie.

It&#39;s a modern bar and grill setup that serves Mexican style food spun in a way that people in the Lemont area will enjoy.  Period.  It&#39;s NOT an authentic taqueria serving street tacos by a Mexican mother that gets the official &#39;authentic&#39; stamp of approval.  Knowing that, this place is a nice addition to the ever growing downtown Lemont scene.  As a fan of Mexican cuisine, I&#39;m happy to have this place in the area.

If you are a lover of spice, anything labeled as spicy on the menu is actually mild.  Keep that in mind.  That&#39;s my one complaint about the menu, I wanted more heat.  From the chips and salsa to the guacamole to my tacos Mexicanos that had the little chile icon next to it on the menu, everything needed more heat.  I want my nose to run and my throat to feel that warmth while eating Mexican food.  It simply wasn&#39;t there.  The chips and salsa to start were decent.  It was your standard salsa and yes, you can find better elsewhere.  The guacamole is sort of prepared fresh.  My brother and I noted that there&#39;s no way they could prepare it that fast so I&#39;m guessing they make large batches ahead of time.  I prefer to see someone cutting the avocados to order but I&#39;m picky.

I asked for corn tortillas with my tacos mexicanos and really enjoyed them.  Streak topped with cilantro and onion, a squeeze of fresh lime and finished with their salsa verde, the flavor was wonderful.  I don&#39;t think anyone would be disappointed in ordering these.  And I was extremely happy with the rice.  Most Mexican places serve bland and boring rice but this place was a step up.  I actually finished the rice on my plate which surprised me.  The beans were decent.  Slightly chunky in texture which I liked though the flavor was more mild than expected.

On a Sunday this place was half full.  It&#39;s a new restaurant that&#39;s looking to expand their customer base.  With the food they serve, it won&#39;t be long before new customers make this place a regular stop.  I&#39;ll be back with the family."

As a prior poster mentioned, we were part of a large party that would dine on Cinco de Mayo.  As such, we called a week in advance to secure a reservation and confirm that the restaurant would be able to accommodate us.  The hostess explained that while the restaurant does not typically take reservations (contrary to what&#39;s posted on their website), since we were such a large party they would take our reservation.  We called again the day beforehand, May 4th, to confirm our reservation.  We were once again told that, even know the restaurant does not take reservations, they would do so for us.  They told us that we would have to wait a maximum of 30 minutes (which doesn&#39;t necessarily square with the idea of a reservation, but hey - it was Cinco de Mayo so we were willing to be flexible).  They told us to arrive promptly at 7pm to ensure minimal waiting times.

Our party was there promptly at 7pm, at which point the hostess on staff told us they could not honor our reservation.  The manager was then called over, who did not even have the decency to acknowledge us or speak to us directly, and confirmed that they were not going to honor our reservation.  No apologies, no offers to discount our meal.  They told us we would have to wait an hour to be seated.  

The wait ended up being closer to 75 minutes.  When we were finally seated, we were surprised to find that we were being placed at a table outside.  It was now 8:30 pm in early May in Chicago - someone please explain to me why this is an acceptable thing to do?  Particularly when the patio is exposed to the wind and there were no heat lamps or other ways to warm ourselves.  Most of us were not dressed for the weather as we were not anticipating eating outdoors, so we spent the next 2 hours alternately freezing our butts off and trying to shout at each other over the noise of the freight trains and screaming children who were running around unattended.  

The final kicker was when the server skipped over my husband and I when taking drink orders (still not sure why), which you can imagine did not go over well - by now we were in sore need of a drink.  

In the end, my husband and I paid $60 to sit at a cheap patio table in the freezing cold by the train tracks, eating mediocre food.  We would have been better off camping - at least then we might have been prepared for the elements.  

Shame on you Front Street Cantina.  With this kind of service you will not be in business long."

It seemed that one of the servers stole our table from someone else - which was a shame because the other server had to be better than the one we got.  She didn&#39;t know the specials, took our drink orders separately, (because my husband was using the restroom) and brought our bill before we asked - so I guess I was done, whether I wanted to be or not.
The food was bad, too.  The guac was grocery store variety, no heat, no spice, nothing special.  The salsa was a mix of chopped up tomatoes, nothing more.  My two tacos campos, one chicken, one steak, were really bad.  The meat seemed as if it was flat ironed on to the grill, because both sides of each piece of meat had a hardened crust on it.  My husband said there were no words to describe how bad his tamale was and that his burrito was edible.  Don&#39;t even get me started on the watery beans.  In a city that has a Mexican restaurant every few miles, my advice is to just keep on driving."

My first impression when we walked in was that the restaurant was not clean and  not managed well (we waited 5 minutes for a hostess to show up).  After sitting down, I confirmed the restaurant could have been cleaner.  Our waiter disappeared after taking our drink order; he showed up 15 minutes later -- only because I flagged him down and asked him to take our orders.  His response was that he forgot about us.  The food was poor.  My husband and I each ordered a combination platter (different combinations) and we agreed that all three items on our plates tasted the same.  You could not distinguish a taco from an enchilada, from a tamale, etc.  Plus, every item on the plate (except for the rice) had a large amount of cheese melted on top; I like cheese and expect it in Mexican food, but this was excessive (perhaps they are trying to cover up that the food is not good quality and does not taste good).

I will never return, nor could I recommend it.  There are too many other great Mexican restaurants in the city to bother with this place."

It&#39;s big with a large outdoor dining area, which is a plus, but the noise level inside can make conversation a challenge even when the place is half-full. Our server was Brittany, and she did a great job in seeing to the needs of our table of 12.  It was a Tuesday, so the house mojito was on special at $4, but I found it to be quite watery and flavorless. The summer special margarita was much better. As for the food, the reviewer who noted that this was Mexican cuisine tailored to a suburban audience was spot on. I ordered a combo plate w. a taco, chile relleno, and a tamale, but didn&#39;t notice until I was halfway through that the tamale had been left off. Oh well. I thought the prices were about average. On the whole, the food could benefit from a lot more heat, as the choices marked &#34;spicy&#34; were anything but. A passable meal, but we&#39;re in no hurry to go back."

We were quickly served the chips and salsa and the salsa was among the best I have had in a very long time.  Our server was very friendly and fairly attentive.  However, what was lacking was our main course.  My wife had the Chicken Fajita Burrito dinner and I had the Chicken Fajitas dinner.  Unfortunately, neither had any flavor.  Both tasted as though the chicken and vegetables were simply cooked in a skillet with water and without any type of seasoning (maybe the chef forgot).  Fajitas tend to be a dish that is not very consistent for whatever reason, even among the same restaurant.  In fact, I can only think of one restaurant were I have had the fajitas more than three or four times and it has been consistenly good--La Carretta in Merriville, IN.  But that place is a hike for me.  As for the Front Street Cantina, I wanted to like the place because it is not too far from my home and as I said, the salsa is excellent (although only the first basket of chips is complimentary, which I think they should reconsider).  If they did, I might revisit them for some cocktails and chips and salsa.  But, if you&#39;re not big on fajitas like me, try the place out and see what else they have to offer.  But, if you are a fan, beware that you might waste around $14."

Wanting Mexican food this evening, we ventured over to Front Street Cantina.  Not much good I can say about the place other than the waitress was friendly.  Room is not really inviting and while they have a huge patio space, we didn&#39;t want to sit outside.  I&#39;m not a huge fan of Mexican cooking so I ordered a taco salad.  I mean how can you go wrong?  Well the meat was tough and mealy and sour cream and guacamole cost extra when they generally are standard fare in most mexican restaurants.

After sitting there about 15 minutes we flagged a waitress who said that she would get someone. No one shows. I go back inside the restarant, I see the hostess, she acts surprised said she would get someone. No one comes. It is now 25 minutes since we were seated. We try to flag a waitress or the hostess but they dont even look over to our table. There are other numerous tables where people are sitting down and getting served immediately. We should have left already but it was a beautiful night. The table next to us just needed a fork and after numerous requests the customer went inside the restaurant and pulled one off a a table. He told us we should leave, that the food and service was awful. We get up to leave and and saw the hostess (short heavy set blond) and  I told here we were leaving.

Overall lunch is ok for the price, I wouldn&#39;t pay for dinner here
I didn&#39;t eat any of the American Chinese food (ie things you find on the lunch special menu of Chinese restaurants)
Half the seafood is fresh the other half is not fresh, ie smells fishy, be wary.
I am impressed with the selection of seafood though
Remember it&#39;s a buffet, the waiter will be by to clear tables, that&#39;s about it.

Fish in general - Fairly tasty and fresh, well cooked, and very moist
Red Snapper - watch out, this one has bones in it even though it doesn&#39;t look like it
Muscles - getting not so fresh, you can taste the fishiness, not good
Clams in Black bean sauce - yummy, I had quite a few of these
Chinese egg plant - this was super yummy, wish they broke down the skin a bit more as parts of that were a bit tough. It was sweet and savory at the same time
Beef and Tofu - decent, not the same flavor you get with it being cooked at home but it was decent
Salt and Pepper Calamari - not really salt and pepper at all, more like fried calamari, lacked in flavor and spice
Coconut Shrimp - not the best way to eat at a buffet but it was nice fried shrimp with a sweet coconut cream sauce. Nice and thick sauce. I liked it.
Steamed conch - moist soy sauced fish
Sushi - not the greatest selection and lots of rice, not very flavorful overall, the spicy mayo did add a bit of flavor but the contents weren&#39;t super flavorful
Sashimi - lots of not so fresh stuff on here, a lot of it smelled fishy as I ate it
Blackened white fish - this was actually quite good, it&#39;s near the grill, it&#39;s kinda like battered fish but done with a marinade so it&#39;s quite flavorful
Calamari - kinda fishy = not fresh 
Pot stickers = they were decent, though not memorable
Lobster = It was empty most of the time then I suddenly saw it as I was on my last trip for dessert so I grabbed a piece, it tasted fresh though a bit overcooked so not as tender as I would like but it was tender enough that I enjoyed it, a nice way to cap off my meal."

As long as the food is moderately warm, the trays are kept full,  and tastes better than a frozen chicken pot pie I am a happy camper. This is not a cheap buffet at $25 plus $3 for a soda. So when advertised all you can eat crab legs and lobster I expected butter to be coursing through my veins by the end of our trip. 

It was indeed the exact opposite. The food was COLD, and quite a bit of the selection could fuel a week&#39;s worth of nightmares.

In the hour we were there I saw no food taken off the buffet by staff. It was obviously past its holding time. 
I saw the crab and lobster refilled once during our visit. And to my dismay it was a total of 4 small lobsters that were gone in a heartbeat.

Also the folks that rave about the sushi, it isn&#39;t terrible but it is by no means good. They call it spicy mayo for a reason, not spicy miracle whip.

So to sum it up the food is gross, the floors are wet, and the lobster is a lie. 

Head over to Osaka grill for a decent buffet, and sushi ya in joliet for good sushi.

Avoid the trouble of going here, we will never be back."

I would not suggest the seafood. My husband loves shellfish and said the oysters were bland and couldn&#39;t finish the rest of his seafood. I tried some cod and there were bones in the fillet.

The sushi seems fresh and there is a large variety. They did not label the various rolls and I would prefer to know what I&#39;m putting in my mouth.

The staff was a bit awkward. They were clearly over staffed for a Sunday AM and the waiters stood around in silence staring. I also felt like the sushi chefs were staring intently at what I was selecting from the sushi buffet. My husband commented that the surfaces all seemed sticky. Gross.

Overall, I enjoy all you can eat sushi but feel like there are better places to go."

The food option were alright they had a while section to circle around and get food from. The sushi was very well prepared and fresh as I could taste while downing salmon sashimi. The lobster came out quiet often like every 20 min and since it was so less people I got so much lobster. Made it worth the price I paid in the end"

This place is located on route59 near New York ave in Naperville. It was originally tagged to open as Royal Buffet but not sure what happened or if someone else took over. First off the place is HUGE! There is a big private section along with table top seating. As I entered I noticed how big the place was and that there was a good number of Asian patrons. The buffet area is also huge! Food quality wise I would rate the quality slightly higher than your standard new China buffet fare. They do have a good selection of sushi, grilled items, and standard Chinese food. They had lobster in some type of sauce but the sign stated to only take 1 piece. It was pretty tasty and I wish I could have taken more. The guy sitting next to me took 2 platefuls. Not sure how he got away with that??

None of the food tasted funky alot of times when u go to a chinese buffet the food tastes funky or it has a weird odor because its not fresh. Some of the food was cold but it wasnt as bad as other buffets. The restaurant was clean like the floors tables n bathrooms which is a big plus. The service sucked they were just standing there not doin anything or being on the phone. The food was good but nothing made me be like wow this is the best food i ever had. That being said they do have a huge selection of food! If u want seafood for a bargain i think the price is a steel because u could get unlimited amount of crab legs, lobster, oysters which is more affordable then red lobster so if u want to save money instead of wasting it on red lobster i would rather come here. They also have a hibachi grill. If i wanna go to a buffer ill go to my neighborhood one but if i want crab legs ill for sure come here over red lobster

Issues: i think its way to expensive like for nothing being that amaizing i think its to pricy but its cheaper then red lobster n u get more crab legs

* food was good but there wasnt any standouts. Alot of the food is just boiled nothing wrong with that but i like flavor in my food

* its suppose to be a sushi place and the sushi selection aint that great. Its better hen ur neigborhood chinese buffet but still no stand outs all ur basic sushi items. One thing i like is they had alot of sashimi which i like. All the fish tasted fresh. One thing i wish they did was offer the spicy mayo because thats the best dipping sauce

* service wasnt that good they need more qualified professionals they were all just standing there staring at u which is really uncomfortable."

Food is not refilled after 9, but they&#39;re opened until 10 on Saturday...

Food selection is great, grilled, sushi, sashimi, stir fried, fried food, shrimp, lobsters, crabs, etc. it would be best if you tour the food first before start putting food on your plate. 

Taste:
The taste of food is okay. Lobsters are meaty, sauce on fish is tasty. But temperature of food needs improvement. Fish and steak are overcooked. Sushi is okay and has great selections. But the uniqueness and creativity of sushi rolls got lost among all the other food. Sashimi is great. Very fresh and tasty. 

Service:
Maybe it&#39;s because the traffic is slow, food was not replaced promptly. Some food on the plates are old and cold. 

The servers are not very attentive. I don&#39;t expect much from buffet servers, but they didn&#39;t really try to earn the obligatory 10% tip. Some of them were standing around their station joking around, instead of walking around to make sure people don&#39;t need anything. Took a while to refill tea pot. Couldn&#39;t track anybody down to get low sodium soy sauce (btw, they don&#39;t have any). Once it got busier, service picked up too.

We all kinda disappointed because there&#39;s not much choice and quality of food isn&#39;t that good. Salad bar is not fresh. Sushi bar isn&#39;t as good as Ginza&#39;s. And at 8 pm they stop serving steam lobster and other dishes. They close at 9:30 but at 8 pm they start serving stir fried lobster instead of steamed lobster. Those stir fried lobsters aren&#39;t fresh, the meat is soft and weird taste. And at 8:30 there were no new dishes coming out. Dessert is the worst cuz all the cake are dried and hard due to not covering it and leaving it out in the air for too long. 

All in all, nothing special. Usually, new buffets are good when they first open. But for the price and quality of food that Sumo is providing, I don&#39;t think it is worth to try. It&#39;s $24 per person before tax, tip and drink. So it will be about $30 per person on weekdays. Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll come back again."

It&#39;s a buffet, though, so you can skip the gross stuff.

I will probably end up coming back, because I can see this place being popular with people I work with.  At 12ish $ a person, it&#39;s a pretty good deal for lunch.  I am curious about the dinner offerings, but I would have to be very hungry to pay 23$ for mediocre buffet food.  When it comes down to it, I am just not a buffet person.

Why can&#39;t any of these joints stay lit?

Lying to myself that OF COURSE the food is &#34;up to date&#34;, and OF COURSE the no-see-um kitchens are clean, and OF COURSE that Sushi/Sashimi is &#34;perfectly fresh&#34;.
And all of this goes skidding directly into the bucket as the queasies take their toll.
This describes the last meal I had here at Sumo. The once-gloried hot dishes now appear haphazardly thrown onto the platters, The Korean short ribs are a symphony of grease.
The Crab Legs are anorexic. The boilerplate Chinese stuff is disgusting,
The Sushi is still edible, but it&#39;s like supermarket sushi. Close but no cigala. It&#39;ll do in a pinch, though if I&#39;m cruising anywhere near one of the AYCE &#34;real&#34; sushi joints, I ain&#39;t goin&#39; to Sumo.

I&#39;m really regret to walk in there for dinner. I was paying $32 for myself and I don&#39;t know what I just ate."

We have been to better ones. It was maybe an two hours before closing and all the food was basically gone. We thought they would make more fresh foods but they didn&#39;t. Everything was cold. When we went back for our second round the only thing that was fresh from the kitchen was french fries and fried rice. The dessert area was empty as well. The fruits were basically all gone. 

In my opinion, the inside of the buffet could of been better but it&#39;s still nice. It is clean but once it gets to closing time the floor gets dirty with food on the floor and they don&#39;t bother to clean up, so watch your step. The workers there are very kind; If you need anything they are willing to help. 

I will not be returning back. For the price of this buffet i can go somewhere else worth my money."

To me there is not much variety of other Chinese food. People mainly come here for the seafood . Do not come here if you do not love seafood because they charge $24 per person on weekday and $28 on weekend. Drinks are not included. They stock the lobster fairly quick. There lobster are fresh and yummy. Staffs are very friendly. I love their salad bar. I have never seen a Asian buffet with so many variety of cheese! The grill steaks are on point. Not too well done or too raw. 

Pretty long drive from Chicago. Might return in future :) Lost one star because I was excepting to have more variety like Royal Buffet and better deserts like they advertised on their website."

Other food was ok, maybe the best part were sushi, seaweed salad , fruits, and desserts. There were some bugs flying above the fruits which made me hesitate the 2nd go around. Place had about 5 other small tables filled around 7 something on a Wednesday evening. Maybe the lunch is better since it&#39;s half the price - which makes more sense considering the quality of the food. Wouldnt go again :/"

Not sure if they offer lobsters, stone crabs and jumbo scallops going forward, or just part of grand opening promo to entice new patrons.

Sushi chef&#39;s are generous with fish/roe portions, lots of sashimi&#39;s too (no need to throw away the rice on nigiri&#39;s)

Use promo code GO2016 to get 15% off the bill, excluding weekends &amp; holidays, good til Feb 29, 2016."

The place was full of patrons and almost all of them were Asian! Everybody seemed to really be enjoying their food, so we decided to stay despite the higher than expected price! Boy! That really was a good call! Fresh hot Lobster! Fresh fresh Sashimi! Baked Salmon! They have their act together here!!! Don&#39;t forget they have a Senior Discount!"

They have the smallest take out menu posted in their window with the price and don&#39;t tell or have it posted anywhere else until you get the bill at the end. Food was only ok. Nothing more than a regular china buffet really (where we usually spend half the price per person). Seafood is NOT the quality that I would pay this money for. Neither is the sushi. Most of the hot dishes were luke warm as well. Staff mostly stood around and talked even though plates had accumulated on our table and drinks were empty. Place was clean. Unfortunately, we won&#39;t be back."

Good section of food. Whitefish was outstanding. 
To our surprise while dinning for lunch they brought Lobster which was prepared Chinese style. 
Lamb Soup was delicious.
Sushi was very good, but the rolls had too much rice.

The Salad Bar which you can purchase alone is pretty basic, but had more choices than I expected to see. Spinach on the bar was really fresh.

Will try Dunn in the future where they offer Whole Lobsters.
This picky eater will be back."

Came on a Sunday for lunch and it was pretty empty. Decent sushi although the selection was a bit small , good seafood spread including lobster, crab, crawfish, oysters and clams. 

They were slow at replenishing the lobster plate and once it came out everyone jumped at getting a piece like a hawk. My husband ended up not getting a piece and so we split mine. we were there for 2 hours just periodically checking and still no luck. Overall Lunch for $24 pp was pricey, would try a different buffet next time."

Our bill was 78$ which wouldn&#39;t have been so bad if the food wasn&#39;t dry as the desert and room temp. If I&#39;m spending 80$ to go out to eat, I expect a better experience. 
Honey chicken, dry and hard. 
Noodles dry 
Broccoli beef, old. 

I gave up after that. 

My 5 year old liked the nuggets, they were hot. 
So yay for 80$ nuggets."

Not sure if it&#39;s the location or staffing issues. This was once great when it was Nagoya, then just went down to terminally mid-level dining. It&#39;s good when you have a craving. I save my addiction up for a month, and let it all out at a sushi buffet. I just haven&#39;t seen this place exceeding its level."

Unlimited lobster and crab. You have to wait a bit for the lobster as you can only get one at a time tho. 

Cons: 
Every platter of lobster they take out can serve around 7 people, with a server making sure each customer gets only one at a time. Takes around 10 minutes for the next platter to arrive. 

They apparently REQUIRE you to pay at least 10% for the tip. First time I&#39;ve seen this in any buffet, OR any other fancier restaurants for that matter. I&#39;d understand if we had a large party but we didn&#39;t. The way the server asked us for it was less than appropriate as well."

I think the best word to describe it is &#34;subpar&#34;.  Trust me, don&#39;t let the pretty new sign, and grand opening memorabilia fool ya.   It&#39;s WAY WAY WAY WAY overpriced for what you get.   Service was &#34;okay&#34; and the food was &#34;okay&#34;.  My girlfriend and I went for dinner and it was over $50 for the two of us.  The buffet on 75 in Woodridge easily tops this.  Trust me guys, save your money.  It&#39;s no wonder the place hasn&#39;t quite taken off yet."

It used to be another seafood buffet but my party and I had a very hard time remembering what the darn name was. I&#39;m honestly torn between a 3 and 4 stars, so perhaps a 3.5 would do. I love this place because they actually have stir fried crawfish (even though it was a little too spicy) instead of the ones that are just left on top of ice by the oysters.  The lobsters came out rapidly and there was even uni (sea urchin)!!! Now, they stingy out on the uni after a little bit which was disappointing because that was what was great about you guys compared to other seafood buffets! They also have this hibachi grill thing at the end where they cook meats and other things in front of you. I just hope they are consistent with the quality and efficiency of the delivery of food because most buffet places are usually less of those as they are opened longer."

Lots of low quality, mostly tasteless food. They did have some seafood options like shrimp, smalll snow crab legs and even some tiny under a pound lobsters that were cut in half netting a piece of meat about the size of your thumb.  Of course the lobster was served next to a sign saying one piece of lobster per trip &#34;No excuses&#34;.  I think they meant no exceptions, but I got the point.  Service was ok.  Our server was not friendly at all.  Not unfriendly or rude, just very matter of fact, &#34;Here&#39;s your drink&#34; attitude.  Even with the reduced weekday rate, our bill came to $101, pretty steep for what you get.  My advice is either go to a much cheaper Chinese buffet and save some money, or add some cash and go to a decent seafood place.  We won&#39;t be back."

I don&#39;t understand the other low ratings.  It was crowded.  They use top quality ingredients.  I hope this place can make it because seriously, I don&#39;t know how they can make money with what they charge.  At a regular sushi restaurant, a regular sashimi plate costs the same as this place! I think I have at least consumed $60 worth of sashimi last night.  Lol"
